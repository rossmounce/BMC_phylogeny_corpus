Abstract
Background: The enhancer (Eμ3') of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) of the channel catfish (Ictalurus
punctatus) has been well characterized. The functional core region consists of two variant Oct transcription factor
binding octamer motifs and one E-protein binding μE5 site. An orthologue to the Oct2 transcription factor has
previously been cloned in catfish and is a functionally active transcription factor. This study was undertaken to
clone and characterize the Oct1 transcription factor, which has also been shown to be important in driving
immunoglobulin gene transcription in mammals.
Results: An orthologue of Oct1, a POU family transcription factor, was cloned from a catfish macrophage cDNA
library. The inferred amino acid sequence of the catfish Oct1, when aligned with other vertebrate Oct1
sequences, revealed clear conservation of structure, with the POU specific subdomain of catfish Oct1 showing
96% identity to that of mouse Oct1. Expression of Oct1 was observed in clonal T and B cell lines and in all tissues
examined. Catfish Oct1, when transfected into both mammalian (mouse) and catfish B cell lines, unexpectedly
failed to drive transcription from three different octamer-containing reporter constructs. These contained a
trimer of octamer motifs, a fish VH promoter, and the core region of the catfish Eμ3' IGH enhancer, respectively.
This failure of catfish Oct1 to drive transcription was not rescued by human BOB.1, a co-activator of Oct
transcription factors that stimulates transcription driven by catfish Oct2. When co-transfected with catfish Oct2,
Oct1 reduced Oct2 driven transcriptional activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that catfish
Oct1 (native or expressed in vitro) bound both consensus and variant octamer motifs. Putative N- and C-terminal
activation domains of Oct1, when fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain and co-transfected with Gal4-dependent
reporter constructs were transcriptionally inactive, which may be due in part to a lack of residues associated with
activation domain function.
Conclusion: An orthologue to mammalian Oct1 has been found in the catfish. It is similar to mammalian Oct1
in structure and expression. However, these results indicate that the physiological functions of catfish Oct1 differ
from those of mammalian Oct1 and include negative regulation of transcription.

Background
The octamer motif (ATGCAAAT) and its reverse complement [1] are important cis-regulatory elements found in
transcriptional control regions of ubiquitously expressed
genes, such as histone H2B and small nuclear RNAs (U1,
U2, and U6), as well as cell-type specific genes, such as the
immunoglobulin (IG) heavy and light chain genes [2-4].
The Oct transcription factors, which bind octamer motifs,
are members of the POU (Pit, Oct, Unc) family of proteins
which are characterized by a bipartite DNA binding
domain. The binding domain consists of two subdomains, the POU specific (POUS) domain and the POU
homeodomain (POUH) that are joined by a linker region,
whose flexibility allows recognition of the cognate
octamer motif by binding to both faces of the DNA [5,6].
The POU proteins can be grouped, based on the structure
of their POU domains, into six or more classes [7,8] POU
transcription factors of Class II have been widely studied
in the vertebrates, and members of this class have also
been reported in ecdysozoan invertebrates such as Drosophila [9], and in the deuterostomate echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [10], and the urochordate
Oikopleura dioica [11]. In the vertebrates, Oct1 (which is
ubiquitously expressed) and Oct2 (which is expressed predominantly in B cells and the central nervous system) are
the most widely studied Class II POU transcription factors. Both Oct1 and Oct2 are essential transcription factors, with Oct1 gene knockout in mouse being embryonic
lethal [12] and Oct2 knockout resulting in death shortly
after birth [13].
While Oct1 is involved in directing the transcription of
both Pol II and Pol III genes, Oct2 was originally thought
to have a more restricted role, for example in controlling
IG gene transcription in B cells [14,15]. However, subsequent studies [13] suggested that Oct2 is redundant,
because Oct1 can also play a significant role in the transcription of mammalian IG genes. Depletion studies in
HeLa cells and BJA-B cells indicated that both Oct1 and
Oct2 could drive transcription from the IGH promoter in
either cell line and with nearly identical binding activity
[16]. In order to explain the evidence that transcription of
both ubiquitously expressed and cell type restricted genes
could be regulated by Oct1 or Oct2, the idea of a B cell
specific co-activator arose. The discovery of BOB.1 (OBF1 or OCA-B), a B cell specific co-activator of Oct1 and
Oct2 proteins, was thought to provide the answer [17-19].
However, thorough exploration of mouse B cell development and function in the absence of Oct1[20], Oct2 [13]
or BOB.1[21], or a combination of Oct2 and BOB.1[22],
showed surprisingly little effect on IGHM gene transcription. Some effects were noticed in the production of secondary isotypes (IGHG and IGHA) and in the formation
of germinal centers. Thus, although the details of the
mechanisms controlling the expression of IG genes in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/8

mammalian B-cells remain unclear, neither Oct1 nor
Oct2 are essential transcription factors for this function,
and the potential for comparative studies to shed light on
the essential and evolutionarily-conserved aspects of IG
gene transcription is considerable.
The channel catfish provides a system for studying the
transcriptional control of teleost IG genes, particularly
with respect to the heavy chain (IGH) locus where
octamer motifs and octamer-binding transcription factors
have been shown to play important roles [23]. Catfish
express only two classes of immunoglobulin (IGHM and
IGHD) and class switching by chromosomal recombination is absent [24-26]. A single enhancer, Eμ3', has been
found associated with the expressed IGHM1 and IGHD1
genes of the catfish [27,28] and is situated immediately 3'
of the IGHM1 gene. The core region of this enhancer consists of two variant (but fully functional) octamer motifs
and a μE5 site. It has been previously established that
octamer-binding transcription factors are important in
driving transcription from the catfish Eμ3' enhancer [23].
This situation in the catfish differs from what is seen with
the mammalian IGH locus, where the Eμ enhancer is
located 5' of the constant region gene cluster and contains
a single octamer motif, which is not within the core
enhancer [29,30]. Catfish Oct2 has been cloned and
shown to be expressed as two predominant isoforms,
Oct2α and β, derived from a single gene by alternative
RNA processing. Both catfish Oct2 isoforms are transcriptionally active [31], although the β isoform is a more
potent transactivator than Oct2α due to differences in the
C-terminal proline, serine, threonine rich activation
domains of the two isoforms [32]. While the role of catfish Oct2 in transcriptional control of the IGH locus of the
channel catfish is well understood, the functional significance of other Oct transcription factors has not yet been
determined. The study reported here was undertaken to
clone the catfish orthologue of Oct1, and to characterize
its expression and function in driving transcription of the
IGH locus in B cells.

Results
Identification of an Oct1 orthologue in channel catfish
A cDNA library from a catfish monocyte cell line (42TA)
was screened with a 32P-labeled probe for the POU
domain of catfish Oct2 (see Methods), and a full-length
clone with putative homology to vertebrate Oct1 was
identified. An amino acid sequence alignment of Oct1
genes can be found in Fig 1A. From the alignment a schematic of the inferred structure of catfish Oct1 was made
and is shown in Fig 1B. The amino acid alignment confirmed the high level of conservation within the POU specific domain and the POU homeodomain (96% and 78%
with the homologous mouse Oct1 domains, respectively).
The putative activation domains N- and C-terminal to the

constructs was tested.

Catfish Oct1 is widely expressed
Catfish Oct1 is widely expressed. RNA was isolated
from the catfish T cell line (G14D) and B cell line (1G8) as
well as catfish tissues (spleen, head kidney, trunk kidney,
brain, heart, gill, and intestine) and subjected to RT-PCR
analysis to detect Oct1 (top panel), as described in the Methods section. RT-PCR detection of the catfish actin transcript
is shown in the bottom panel.

POU domain also showed substantial sequence identity,
ranging between 36% and 46% in comparison with the
mouse and zebrafish Oct1 activation domains. A more
comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary relationships
of catfish Oct1 is shown in the phylogenetic tree of Fig 1C.
This demonstrates that the separation into Oct1 and Oct2
occurred early in vertebrate evolution, and that the invertebrate Oct genes form an outgroup and cannot be classified clearly as either Oct1 or Oct2 othologues [33].
Although isoforms of catfish Oct2 have easily been identified [31], analysis by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR of cDNA
from catfish B cell and T cell lines (see Methods) did not
identify any sequences of catfish Oct1 other than the one
originally isolated (Fig 1).
Catfish Oct1 is widely expressed
Ubiquitous expression in cells and tissues is one of the key
features that distinguishes mammalian Oct1 from the tissue-restricted Oct2. Therefore, the expression of catfish
Oct1 in clonal T and B cell lines and in a variety of tissues
was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig 2). The primers used in the
RT- PCR analysis were designed within the C-terminus of
the catfish Oct1 to distinguish the Oct1 gene from the two
isoforms of catfish Oct2. The primer sequences were not
found within the sequence for either isoform of catfish
Oct2 and NCBI blast search returned matches only to the
catfish Oct1 sequence. The cloned, catfish B and T cell
lines both expressed Oct1, as did all of the tissues examined, including spleen, head and trunk kidney, brain,
heart, gill and intestine. This pattern of widespread expres-

Transcriptional Activity of catfish Oct1
An Oct1 expression vector was co-transfected, with several
different reporter constructs, all of which contained
octamer motifs, into catfish B cell lines. Oct1 was, surprisingly, unable to drive transcription from an octamerdependent reporter that contains a trimer of octamer
motifs upstream of a minimal c-fos promoter, and which
is responsive to catfish Oct2 (Fig 3A). Whilst the transcription driven by the transfected Oct1 was actually found to
be significantly suppressive (p < .01) from the empty vector control, catfish Oct2, as predicted, induced transcription strongly. We considered the possibility that Oct1
requires a co-activator to function, and thus examined its
ability to act in concert with human BOB.1, a co-activator
of Oct transcription factors. BOB.1 has previously been
shown to activate transcription synergistically with catfish
Oct2 [34] but as shown in Fig 3B, human BOB.1 was unable to act synergistically with catfish Oct1. This was not
due to a lack of function of BOB.1, as it enhanced transcription (at a statistically significant level) from the
octamer-dependent reporter when transfected alone into
catfish B cells, presumably through interaction with the
endogenous Oct transcription factors. The interaction of
human BOB.1 with catfish Oct2 gave transcription that
was increased above the level seen with either BOB.1 or
Oct2 transfected alone (Fig 3B). Whilst this interactive
effect of BOB.1 on Oct2-driven transcription did not reach
statistical significance (p < 0.07), in a second series of
experiments (described below) this effect was confirmed
(see Fig 4B). The possibility that catfish Oct1 and Oct2
might act synergistically was tested in a series of co-transfection experiments. The results (Fig 3C) showed that the
transcriptional activation produced by catfish Oct2 was in
fact reduced (in a statistically significant manner) with
increasing amounts of co-transfected Oct1. In order to test
if the inability of catfish Oct1 to drive transcription was
reporter-dependent, its activity was tested on two other
physiologically-relevant reporter constructs. The ability of
catfish Oct1 to drive transcription from a reporter construct containing a minimal promoter and the core region
of the enhancer (Eμ3') of the catfish IGH locus was tested
in both mouse J558L plasmacytoma cells and in the catfish B cell line 1G8. The results show that this reporter,
while responsive to catfish Oct2, was unresponsive to
Oct1 both in mouse (Fig 4A) and catfish (Fig 4B) cells.
The activation by catfish Oct2 was statistically significant
(when compared to the reporter construct alone) activation by catfish Oct1 was not. When catfish Oct1 and
human BOB.1 were co-transfected, the level of transcrip-

tional activation was no higher than that seen with BOB.1
alone (Fig 4B), confirming the inability of catfish Oct1 to
interact positively with this co-activator. Co-transfection
of human BOB.1 with catfish Oct2 enhanced transcription to a statistically significant extent, supporting the
effect suggested by the results shown in Fig 3B. The activity
of catfish Oct1 was then tested with a third octamer-containing reporter construct, in which expression is driven
from a fish VH gene promoter that contains a single
octamer motif (Fig 4C). While this construct was highly
responsive to Oct2, it failed to respond to co-transfected
Oct1 (Fig 4C) and these results were also found to be statistically significant. Given these unexpected results, the
possibilities were next considered that catfish Oct1 was

either a) unable to bind to an octamer motif or b) if it
could bind to an octamer motif, it lacked functional activation domains.
In vitro expressed catfish Oct1 binds the octamer motif
In order to test the ability of catfish Oct1 to bind to the
octamer motif, catfish Oct2β and catfish Oct1 proteins
were produced by in vitro transcription and translation
and tested by EMSA for their ability to bind the native
octamer motif (ATGtAAAT) found within the catfish core
enhancer (Fig 5). The first two lanes of the gel shift show
the free probe (Fig 5A, Lane 1) and the TNT lysate (Fig 5A,
Lane 2) without the addition of any DNA as controls.
These results show that Oct1 bound to the octamer motif
(Fig 5A, Lane 3), and that the binding was specifically
inhibited by an excess of unlabeled octamer motif (Fig 5A,
Lane 4) but not by an excess of the octamer sequence that
had been scrambled (Fig 5A, Lane 5). Addition of the antibody to catfish Oct1 eliminated the shifted band (Fig 5A,
Lane 6), indicating that the observed shift was Oct1induced. The control (preimmunization bleed) serum did
not affect the observed shift (Fig 5A, Lane 7). The ability
of catfish Oct2β to bind to the native octamer motif was
confirmed by the results (shown in Fig 5B) which are similar to those observed with catfish Oct1. The in vitro synthesized proteins were checked for size by radiolabeling
with 35S methionine and analyzed on an SDS PAGE gel
(figure 5C). The sizes of the protein bands produced for
catfish Oct1 and Oct2β were consistent with the expected
sizes of the proteins, 65kDa for catfish Oct1 and 52kDa
for catfish Oct2β.
Octamer-binding transcription factors of catfish B cells
The ability of endogenous transcription factors expressed
in catfish B cells to bind the octamer motif was also tested
by EMSA. Nuclear extracts from the catfish 1G8 B cell line
generated complex patterns of shifted bands when tested
with a consensus octamer motif (Fig 6, Lane 1). However,
all the shifted bands were abolished by an excess of unlabeled octamer motif (Fig 6, Lane 2), but not by the addition of a scrambled octamer motif (Fig 6, Lane 3) and
interpretation of the banding pattern was made possible
using antisera specific to Oct1 and to Oct2. The uppermost shifted band is clearly attributable to Oct1, as seen
from the supershift of this band in the presence of antibody to Oct1 (Fig 6, Lanes 6, 7). Below this Oct1 shift is
an envelope of strong bands attributable to Oct2, as evidenced by their supershift with antibody to Oct2 (Fig 6,
Lanes 4, 7). Antibody to Oct2 failed to supershift a faint
band within this lower Oct2 envelope, but the combination of antibody to Oct1 and to Oct2 supershifted all
bands in the upper region of the gel (Fig 6, Lane 7). The
nature of the lower, diffuse bands observed in the EMSA
is not known, but they were not supershifted by the antibodies to either Oct1 or Oct2 (Fig 6, Lanes 4–7).

Catfish Oct1 lacks functional activation domains
The above results clearly demonstrate that catfish Oct1 is
capable of binding to the octamer motif. Thus, in order to
address the failure of catfish Oct1 to activate transcription,
the function of the N- and C-terminal putative activation
domains was tested. Expression constructs containing the
Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to Oct1 and Oct2 putative activation domains were generated, and tested by cotransfection with a reporter constructs containing Gal4
binding sites in the promoter region (Fig 7A, B). These
constructs were co-transfected into catfish B cells (the 1G8
cell line) and their ability to drive transcription from the
reporter construct is shown in Table 1. The negative con-

trols (Gal4 binding domain fused to nucleolin or to the
Oct1 POU domain) were inactive or suppressive, whereas
the positive control (Gal4 binding domain fused to the
VP16 activation domain) showed strong statistically significant activity. The C-terminal domain of the catfish
Oct2β isoform was also strongly active and statistically
significant, giving a greater than 300-fold stimulation of
expression. There was low activation (3-fold) seen with
the N-terminus of catfish Oct2β; this level of activity is
consistent with what has previously been reported and
nearly statistically significant with a p-value of .057[32].
However, in the case of catfish Oct1, both the C-terminal
and N-terminal domains are lacking in substantial activation ability (Table 1). While there was a slight activation
(2-fold) with the C terminal domain, this activation was
negligible and not statistically significant when compared
to that of the catfish Oct2β C-terminus. In the case of the
N-terminal domain of Oct1, it suppressed rather than
enhanced transcription, this suppression was also seen to
be significant from the DNA binding domain alone.
Examination of the Oct1 sequence alignment in Figure 1
shows the lack of several gln residues known to be important in the N-terminal activation domain of mammalian
Oct1[14,37,38]. Within the Gln1 region (Fig. 1A), which
is located in the human Oct1 sequence from amino acid
22–145, 52% of the gln residues found in the human
sequence are missing in catfish Oct1 and 68% are missing
in the zebrafish Oct1 sequence. In the Gln2 region (amino
acid 163–268 in human Oct1), 42% of the gln residues
are missing in the catfish and 58% are missing in the
zebrafish Oct1. The absence of these gln residues suggests
that teleost Oct1 may not possess the capability to act as a
transcriptional regulator. Further examination of the ser/
thr rich region [14,37] located from amino acid 441–560
in human Oct1 indicates a similar pattern, i.e. 67% and
69% of ser and thr residues present in the human
sequence are absent in the homologous regions of catfish
and zebrafish Oct1, respectively.

Discussion
The conclusion that the cloned catfish molecule identified
in this study is a homologue of Oct1 is supported by 4
observations. First, it shows well-conserved sequence similarity to other vertebrate Oct1 (especially in the POU
domain); secondly, in phylogenetic analyses it clusters to
the same tree branch as other vertebrate Oct1 sequences;
thirdly, it binds the octamer DNA sequence motif; and
fourthly, it shows the widespread pattern of expression
characteristic of vertebrate Oct1. In human and mouse
several isoforms of Oct1 have been isolated, arising from
alternative splicing involving the 21 expressed exons of
this gene, [35]. In contrast, examination of catfish macrophage and B cell lines by RT-PCR and RACE failed to identify any alternatively spliced isoforms of catfish Oct1.
However, EMSA analysis of endogenous octamer-binding

transcription factors (Fig 6) suggested the possibility that
an additional minor isoform of Oct1 might be expressed
in catfish B cells. It is possible a) that an Oct1 isoform may
be expressed at such a low level that the technique used
may have failed to detect its presence or b) the primers
designed for this study may have been placed in exons not
included in the transcript. Analysis of the teleost fish
genomes currently being sequenced revealed orthologues
of the Oct1 in the zebrafish Danio rerio,
(ENSDARG00000007996), the puffer fishes Takifugu
rubripes (NEWSINFRUG00000159819) and Tetraodon
nigroviridis (GSTENG00025967001), and the three-spined
stickleback
Gasterosteus
aculeatus
(ENSGACG00000003150). Interestingly, in only one of
these species, the stickleback is Oct1 reported to have
more than one transcript. Thus, despite the whole genome
duplication that occurred in teleost fishes, to date no evidence for more than a single Oct1 gene has been found.
While it is likely that only one Oct1 gene exists in the teleost fishes (including catfish) this question will not be
resolved until the sequencing and assembly of the teleost
genome sequences is completed
Although orthologues of Oct1 are present in the genomes
of four other teleost fish this study represents the first
examination of the function of a teleost Oct1 orthologue.
Contrary to our expectations, catfish Oct1 was clearly unable to activate transcription, even though it binds to the
octamer motif. This inability to drive transcription was
seen using three different octamer-containing reporter
constructs transfected into both mouse and catfish B cells.
Not only did the catfish Oct1 fail to activate transcription
from a reporter construct with a synthetic trimer of
octamer motifs in the promoter region, but it also failed
to activate transcription from two constructs driven by
physiologically-relevant octamer-containing elements; in
one case a complete fish VH promoter [36], and in the
other case the core region of the Eμ3' enhancer of the
channel catfish IGH locus [23]. In all cases, while the catfish Oct2 drove transcription from the reporter constructs
to a statistically significant level, catfish Oct1 did not.
Binding of both native and in vitro expressed catfish Oct1
was shown with both the consensus octamer motif
(ATGCAAAT) or the variant octamer motif (ATGtAAAT)
located within the core region of the catfish enhancer
Eμ3'. To dissect the molecular basis for the lack of transcriptional activation of catfish Oct1, a Gal4 fusion study
of the putative activation domains was undertaken. The
results of this study clearly demonstrate the lack of activity
of the putative activation domains in both the N- and Cterminus of the catfish Oct1 possibly associated with the
relative lack of residues known to be associated with activation domain function, i.e. gln residues in the N-terminal domain and ser and thr residues in the C-terminal
domain of catfish Oct 1. Co-transfection studies involving

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/8

catfish Oct1 and Oct2 suggested that catfish Oct1 could be
a negative regulator of transcription, in that it significantly
inhibited activation driven by Oct2. The mammalian coactivator BOB.1 has been shown to act synergistically with
both mammalian Oct1 and Oct2 to drive transcription
[19], and the possibility was considered that this co-activator might rescue the activation function of catfish Oct1.
However, while co-transfection studies confirmed that
human BOB.1 is capable of significantly enhancing transcriptional activation driven by catfish Oct2β (Figures 3
and 4 and [34]), BOB.1 did not confer transcriptional activation ability on catfish Oct1. The failure of BOB.1 and
catfish Oct1 to function in a synergistic manner could
result from impaired physical interaction between BOB.1
and catfish Oct1. However, the BOB.1/Oct interaction is
through the Oct POU domain [39] which is the most
highly conserved region of the catfish Oct1 molecule (Fig
1). All of the residues in the mammalian Oct1 POU
domains that are known to interact with BOB.1, including
Leu6, Glu7, Leu9, Glu10, Leu53, Asn54, Phe57, Met60
within the POUS domain and Lys55, Arg58, Ile59 within
the POUH domain [39] are conserved in catfish Oct1. This
suggests the possibility that catfish Oct1 might function in
concert with endogenous co-activators, such as a catfish
homologue of BOB.1. However, if this were the case, transcriptional activation by Oct1 expressing constructs transfected into catfish B cells would have been predicted.
These results suggest, collectively, a potential mechanism
of transcriptional control in the catfish IGH locus whereby
Oct1, as a negative regulator of transcription and Oct2, as
an activator of transcription compete for binding to the
octamer motifs found within the intronic enhancer (Eμ3')
and the VH promoters [27,40].
Mammalian Oct1 is involved in driving transcription
from both Pol II and Pol III promoters and also has a role
in recruiting basal transcription factors such as SNAPc
[41]. In addition, mammalian Oct1 demonstrates promoter-selective activation domains and its ability to drive
mRNA transcription can be weaker than that of Oct2
[14,42,43]. While mammalian Oct1 has not been
reported to act as a negative regulator of IG gene transcription, its very diverse functions in regulating the expression
of other genes include both positive and negative effects.
In the case of the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone
Receptor (GnRHR) gene, Oct1 has been shown to be capable of both activation and repression [44]. The POU
domain of Oct1 interacts with the silencing mediator for
retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), recruiting histone
deacetylases to the promoter and leading to transcriptional repression [45]. Two more recent studies have indicated additional roles for Oct1. Mouse embryo fibroblast
(MEF) cell lines depleted of Oct1 showed an arrest in Herpes simplex virus replication, due to a role for Oct1 in aiding viral assembly as well as a likely secondary role

high stringency with a 32P-labeled probe to the POU
domain of catfish Oct2 [31]. Two positive clones were
obtained and plaque purified. One of these contained a
full-length Oct1, and its sequence (GenBank
Acc#AJ000267) was determined from both strands by
primer-extension sequencing (Biomolecular Resource
Laboratory of the Medical University of South Carolina).
Isoforms of Oct1 were sought by 3'-RACE using forward
primers at positions 1–21 (G-1594); 540–569(G-2338);
547–567 (G-1595); 943–966 (G-2335); 1063–1083 (G1596); 1836–1856 (G-1597), by 5'-RACE using reverse
primers at positions 963–986 (G-2336); 1169–1195 (G2337) and by RT-PCR using these primers in appropriate
combination with reverse downstream primers at positions 615–635 (G-1598); 1206–1226 (G-1599) and
1836–1856 (G-1600). An additional reverse primer in the
3'UTR of the Oct1 clone, G-1593 (5'-AATAAAGTCTAAAGAGCGAGG-3') was also used.

affecting viral DNA replication [46]. A recent study of gene
expression has also indicated that Oct1 can act as a stress
sensor. Mouse fibroblasts deficient in Oct1 showed
altered expression in a variety of genes known to be
involved in the response to oxidative and metabolical
stress [47]. In both of these cases the DNA binding ability
of Oct1 is critical.

Conclusion
The study reported here is the first demonstration that an
Oct1 protein has an inhibitory effect on the transcriptional regulatory elements of IG genes. However, given
that mammalian Oct1 has multiple and diverse roles, it is
possible that Oct1 in teleosts has significantly different
roles from those seen in mammals, relating not only to
the transcription of genes but to the response to cellular
stress and viral infection.

Methods
Cloning and Sequence Determination of Catfish Oct1
A cDNA library was prepared in λ ZAPII (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA) from the 42TA catfish monocyte/macrophage
line [48]. Approximately 2.5 × 105 pfu were screened at

Phylogenetic Analysis
Sequence alignments were carried out using Clustal V in
the Megalign suite of programs (DNA Star, Madison, WI)
with PAM 250, gap length penalty of 10 and gap penalty
of 10. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses
were conducted using MEGA version 2.1 [49]. The neighbor joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree of Oct1 full-length
amino acid sequences was generated with 1000 bootstrap
replications. The following amino acid sequences (accession numbers) were used to generate the NJ tree. Catfish

(NM131438), Drosophila Oct2 (S80561), Drosophila Oct1
(S80559), and the Caenorhabditis. elegans homeobox protein (Z79757).
RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen, brain, heart, gill and intestine from catfish
and from the B lymphoblastoid cell line (1G8) and the Tcell lines (G14D) of the catfish using Trizol (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, San Diego, CA). The RNA was then
treated with DNase I by addition to RNAeasy mini-kit columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After elution from the columns 0.5 μL of ribonuclease inhibitor, 40u/μl (RNasin,
Promega, Madison, WI), was added to the RNA. First
strand synthesis was then completed using 4 μL of total
RNA, an oligo dT primer, and PowerScript Reverse Transcriptase (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The
concentration of cDNA was measured and diluted to 1 μg/
μL. A final concentration of 4 ng/μL was used in the PCR
reaction with Ex Taq polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan).
The PCR program was performed for 30 cycles and used

Reporter Constructs and Expression Vectors
Three octamer dependent reporter constructs were used.
1) a luciferase expressing construct, pGL3/Δ56/R#2,
which contains the core region of the catfish Eμ3'
enhancer upstream of the minimal c-fos promoter
(described in [50], 2) a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
expressing reporter, pO3-Δ56-CAT, with a trimer of
octamer motifs (ATGCAAAT) upstream of the minimal cfos promoter [31], and 3) a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expressing reporter, pFVH-CAT, with a complete
goldfish VH gene promoter [36]. The catfish Oct2β expression vector has been previously described [31]. The catfish
Oct1 was directionally cloned (using NotI and ApaI sites)
into the pRc/CMV expression vector. Coding sequences
were amplified by PCR (forward primer G-2203 – 5' AAG
GAA AAA AGC GGC CGC GGC ACC ATG GAG AAT GGA
ATA CAT GGA GTC C 3', reverse primer G-2179 – 5' TTT

sequence is shown in bold in the sense primer. The
human BOB.1 vector, expressed from pRc/CMV, was a

generous gift from P. Matthias (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Novartis Forschungsstiftung, Basel, Switzerland).
For the Gal4 fusion study the reporter construct pG5/CAT
was used [32]. This construct contains 5 Gal4 binding
sites, located upstream of a minimal TATA box promoter
and the CAT reporter gene. The expression constructs for
the fusion proteins containing the Gal4 DNA binding
domain (DBD) alone or with VP16; nucleolin; catfish
Oct2β N-terminus; and catfish Oct2β C-terminus have
previously been described [32]. The Gal4DBD-Oct1
domain fusion expression constructs were produced by
PCR and were directionally cloned into the Gal4DBD
expression construct with XbaI and BamHI restriction
enzyme sites. An internal stop codon was also included
prior to the BamHI site. All clones were checked by
sequencing before use to ensure the absence of PCRinduced mutations.

Cell Lines and DNA transfection
The catfish B lymphoblastoid cell line 1G8 and T cell line
G14D, and the mouse plasmacytoma cell line J558L were
maintained as previously described [50]. Transfections
were performed with an Electro Cell Manipulator 600
(BTX, San Diego, Ca) and 2-mm gap cuvettes (BTX) were
used. All cells were harvested during the logarithmic
growth phase and washed once in serum free media (45%
AIMV, 45% L15 and 10% deionized water for catfish cells
and RPMI-1640 for mouse cells) before resuspension in
serum free media prior to transfection. Immediately
before transfection 180 μL of cells (8 × 106 cells of 1G8
and 4 × 106 cells of J558L) were mixed with 20 μL of prepared DNA. Reporter construct (2.4 pM of pGL3/Δ56/
R#2), (3.2 pM of pFVH-CAT), (3.3 pM of pO3-Δ56-CAT)
and empty, Oct1, Oct2 or BOB.1 expression vectors (1.6
pM) were transfected into the cells. For competition studies 1 pM of Oct2 construct was transfected, and increasing
amounts of the Oct1 construct were added; 0.5 pM, 1 pM,
and 2 pM. For the Gal4 studies 3.95 pM of the pG5/CAT
reporter construct was used. For the expression constructs,
1.108 pM of Gal4-DBD alone, Gal4DBD bound to nucleolin, VP16, Oct2β N-Term, Oct2β C-term, Oct1 POU
domain, Oct1 N-term, Oct1 C-term was transfected into
the catfish 1G8 cell line. In all experiments 1 μg of a
Renilla luciferase construct with a CMV promoter (pRL/
CMV; Promega) was used as the transfection control.
Optimal transfection conditions were used as previously
described [23]. Briefly, 1G8 cells were harvested at a density of 3.6–4.0 × 106 cells/ml and were electroporated at
210 V, 1100 μF, and 48Ω. J558L cells were harvested at a
density of 0.8–1.0 × 106 cells/ml and electroporated at
130V, 1100 μF, and 48 Ω. All transfected cells were harvested 36–40 hours after electroporation and assessed for
expression of the reporter genes.
Luciferase Reporter Assay
Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-luciferase
reporter assay system (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Transfection
activity was normalized to the activity of the co-transfected Renilla luciferase, and the values were calculated as
mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's T-test assuming unequal variances.
CAT Assay
Cells were lysed in 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega)
and split into two 100 μl aliquots. One of the aliquots was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/8

used in the luciferase reporter assay as described above.
The second aliquot was heated at 60°C for 10 min. After
heating and centrifugation (16,100 × g for 2 min) the
supernatant was transferred into the CAT reaction mixture
containing 14C chloramphenicol, n-Butyryl CoA
(Promega) and water to a final volume of 125 μL. The
reactions were incubated at 37°C for 16 hours and then
terminated by the addition of mixed xylenes (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) to extract the modified chloramphenicol. The
extracted layer was then added to liquid scintillation fluid
and the radioactive product was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Assay results were normalized using the
luciferase assay results and the values were calculated as
mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's T-test assuming unequal variances.
Recombinant protein and antiserum production
The sequence encoding the C-terminal region of catfish
Oct1 was digested from the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) as an EcoRV fragment (taking advantage of restriction sites at position 1149–1154 in the Oct1 coding
sequence and in the multiple cloning site of the vector)
and ligated into the SmaI restriction site of the pQE30 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen) that contains an N-terminal (His)6 tag. The plasmid was transformed into the
Escherichia coli M15 strain (Qiagen) and grown at 37°C in
LB medium containing a final concentration of 100 μg/ml
ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and induced with 2 mM
IPTG (Sigma) 5 hours after reaching an OD600 of 0.7. The
bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml sonication buffer (1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), 6 M urea, 400 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4 pH
8.0) and lysed by freeze thawing. A 50% TALLON metal
affinity resin slurry (BD Biosciences Clontech) equilibrated with sonication buffer was used to purify the Histagged Oct1 C-terminal peptide. The eluted protein was
dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and subsequently lyophilized. The purified peptide was used to
immunize rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA)
using primary immunization with complete Freund's
adjuvant and boosting using incomplete Freund's adjuvant.

After annealing, the purity of the double-stranded DNA
was verified by gel electrophoresis on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (BioRad). The annealed probes
were labeled by a radioactive fill-in reaction using the
