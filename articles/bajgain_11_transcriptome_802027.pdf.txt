big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)

Abstract
Background: Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is one of the most widely distributed and ecologically important
shrub species in western North America. This species serves as a critical habitat and food resource for many
animals and invertebrates. Habitat loss due to a combination of disturbances followed by establishment of invasive
plant species is a serious threat to big sagebrush ecosystem sustainability. Lack of genomic data has limited our
understanding of the evolutionary history and ecological adaptation in this species. Here, we report on the
sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple
sequence repeat (SSR) markers in subspecies of big sagebrush.
Results: cDNA of A. tridentata sspp. tridentata and vaseyana were normalized and sequenced using the 454 GS FLX
Titanium pyrosequencing technology. Assembly of the reads resulted in 20,357 contig consensus sequences in ssp.
tridentata and 20,250 contigs in ssp. vaseyana. A BLASTx search against the non-redundant (NR) protein database
using 29,541 consensus sequences obtained from a combined assembly resulted in 21,436 sequences with
significant blast alignments (≤ 1e-15). A total of 20,952 SNPs and 119 polymorphic SSRs were detected between the
two subspecies. SNPs were validated through various methods including sequence capture. Validation of SNPs in
different individuals uncovered a high level of nucleotide variation in EST sequences. EST sequences of a third,
tetraploid subspecies (ssp. wyomingensis) obtained by Illumina sequencing were mapped to the consensus
sequences of the combined 454 EST assembly. Approximately one-third of the SNPs between sspp. tridentata and
vaseyana identified in the combined assembly were also polymorphic within the two geographically distant ssp.
wyomingensis samples.
Conclusion: We have produced a large EST dataset for Artemisia tridentata, which contains a large sample of the
big sagebrush leaf transcriptome. SNP mapping among the three subspecies suggest the origin of ssp.
wyomingensis via mixed ancestry. A large number of SNP and SSR markers provide the foundation for future
research to address questions in big sagebrush evolution, ecological genetics, and conservation using genomic
approaches.

Background
Artemisia (Asteraceae) is a widely distributed plant
genus that is predominantly found in temperate regions
of the northern hemisphere. Some species within this
genus are valued in medicine, cooking, and forage for
livestock [1,2]. Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is
recognized for its importance to ecosystem function. Big

sagebrush is one of the most abundant, widespread, and
ecologically important woody shrub species in the intermountain regions of western North America. This species contains three widespread subspecies (A. t. ssp.
tridentata, A. t. ssp. vaseyana, and A. t. ssp. wyomingensis) that occupy distinct habitats and two less common
subspecies (A. t. ssp. spiciformis and A. t. ssp. xericensis)
[3,4]. Prior to the Anglo-American settlement, big sagebrush was estimated to occupy up to 100 million ha of
the western United States, while contemporary estimates
have shown that the area has been reduced to

approximately 43 million ha [5]. Changes in land use
and disturbance regimes (e.g., conversion to agriculture,
overgrazing and wildfire frequencies) are major factors
in the degradation of these ecosystems. Such disturbances can lead to invasions by cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) and other weeds that fundamentally change the
wildfire frequency and severely reduce the frequency of
sagebrush in ecosystems where it historically dominated
[6,7]. Restoration of these ecosystems not only requires
replanting of big sagebrush, but the replanting should
be carried out with a basis of scientific knowledge. Early
efforts toward this goal have been made by Mahalovich
and McArthur [8], where the authors outline the importance of seed plantation by geographical distribution of
the subspecies. Restoration of sustainable populations
necessitates understanding of the local and landscape
level genetic structure of natural big sagebrush
populations.
Polyploidy and intra- and interspecific hybridization
are likely the important factors in big sagebrush adaptation and landscape dominance. Big sagebrush subspecies
occupy specific ecological niches: ssp. tridentata grows
in alluvial flats at elevation typically lower than 1800 m,
ssp. vaseyana is found in higher altitude uplands at elevations above 1660 m up to timberline, and ssp. wyomingensis occupies drier sites with shallow soils [9].
Subspecies wyomingensis is universally tetraploid,
whereas sspp. tridentata and vaseyana are typically
diploid; although both sspp. tridentata and vaseyana
also include tetraploid populations [4]. Hybridization
between ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana is common
under the appropriate ecological conditions. Hybridization among big sagebrush subspecies has been studied
using reciprocal transplants, showing that natural selection tends to limit the hybrids of sspp. tridentata and
vaseyana to a zone between the parental subspecies
habitat [9,10]. McArthur and Sanderson [4] suggest that
hybrid zones could be repositories of genetic variation
and gene exchange, and can influence the evolution of
big sagebrush.
Though widely acknowledged as an important shrub
of the intermountain ecosystem in western North America, limited DNA sequence data has been collected on
big sagebrush. A search for A. tridentata nucleotide
sequences in the NCBI database yielded less than 50
nucleotide sequences. As a genus, Artemisia has
approximately 3.8 million sequences (~823 Mbp) of
which 3.7 million reads are archived in the Sequence
Read Archive (SRA), from A. annua EST projects [2,11],
and an ongoing A. annua genome project [11]. A.
annua is a medicinal herb native to temperate Asia and
is not found in the western hemisphere. Sequences of A.
tridentata are needed to conduct research studies involving phylogenetics, population genetics, and ecological

genetics in North American big sagebrush populations.
Transcriptome sequencing and annotation, and marker
detection within big sagebrush EST sequences will provide a rapid means to satisfy these information needs
and set the stage for future studies.
In this study, we characterized the leaf transcriptome
of two big sagebrush subspecies, A.t. ssp. tridentata and
A.t. ssp. vaseyana and compared the resulting ESTs. We
also sequenced A. t. ssp. wyomingensis ESTs to assess
SNP distribution in this subspecies compared to sspp.
tridentata and vaseyana. Our objectives were to 1) identify and characterize a large number of expressed genes
in A. tridentata, 2) detect sequence differences within
and between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana that could
be used as markers to further our understanding of
adaptive, phenotypic variation within the species, and 3)
gain inference into the origins of the tetraploid A. t. ssp.
wyomingensis.

Results
EST sequencing, assembly, and characterization

We created two normalized cDNA libraries from leaf
tissues of two subspecies of A. tridentata: sspp. tridentata and vaseyana. Independent sequencing of these
cDNA libraries generated 823,392 sequence reads containing 332,578,737 bases of sequence from ssp. tridentata and 702,001 sequence reads containing 233,854,535
bases of sequence from ssp. vaseyana (Table 1). Assuming a limited amount of sequence divergence between
the two subspecies’ coding sequence, both sets of ESTs
were combined into a single, de novo assembly (Table
1). This assembly contained in 29,541 contigs and
275,866 singleton sequences. From the assembled contigs, ESTScan [12] predicted 25,998 (88%) protein coding open reading frames, of which 25,089 (96%) were
greater than 200 bp. Some contigs were assembled from
reads of a single subspecies. 2,381 contigs were exclusively composed of ssp. tridentata reads and 3,137

contigs were exclusively composed of only ssp. vaseyana
reads (Figure 1). EST read number ranged from 2 reads
to 3,161 reads in a contig, with a median of 23 EST
reads per contigs. Unless stated otherwise, the combined
assembly sequences were used for subsequent bioinformatic analyses. From the remaining, unassembled reads
(singletons), ESTScan predicted 136,305 (49.4%) protein
coding open reading frames, of which 112,028 (82.2%)
were greater than 200 bp.
Protein homologies between big sagebrush ESTs and
the NR protein database were identified using BLASTx.
Out of 29,541 assembled contig sequences, 21,436
sequences (72.6%) had significant alignments (≤1e-15 )
and out of 275,866 singleton sequences, 70,836
sequences (25.7%) had significant alignments (≤1e-15).
Of the contigs with BLASTx hits, 9,696 (45.2%)
sequences had their best blast alignment to Vitis vinifera
and 215 (7.3%) and 80 (0.27%) to Helianthus annus and
Lactuca sativa respectively, both of which are in the
Asteraceae. Only fifty-four (0.2%) contigs had their best
matches to Artemisia annua, owing to the limited number of Artemisia proteins (167) in the NR protein database. The NR BLAST results were utilized by Blast2GO
[13] to annotate the EST sequences with GO terms.
One or more GO IDs were assigned to 18,397 (62.3%)
contigs with a maximum of 21 GO IDs assigned to a
single sequence. The distributions of contigs in three,
non-mutually exclusive GO categories: biological process
(BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function
(MF) were well represented by a diverse set of putative
biological functions (Figure 2). In BP category, the most
abundant GO term was metabolic process (29.9%), followed by cellular process (21.8%), and unknown biological process (8.4%). In CC category, unknown cellular
component was the most abundant (32.5%), followed by
cell component (32.0%) and intracellular component
(25.3%). Similarly in the MF category, binding was the

most abundant category (32.1%), followed by catalytic
activity (19.7%), and transferase activity (16.8%). The
three groups (BP, CC and MF) are not mutually exclusive; therefore, some contigs were assigned gene ontologies in more than one type of category.
Comparison of the 29,541 contig sequences against
the Pfam-A domain database with an e-value cutoff at
1e-5 resulted in 15,812 contigs (53.5%) matching at least
one protein domain model. The distribution of the
domains ranged from a maximum of 13 domains
assigned to the same contig to a minimum of one
domain per contig (Additional File 1). The three most
common domains were the Protein kinase domain (Pkinase, Pfam ID: PF00069.18), followed by the Protein tyrosine kinase domain (Pkinase_Tyr, Pfam ID:
PF07714.10), and the RNA recognition motif domain
(RRF_1, Pfam ID: PF00076.15).
Genes associated with secondary metabolites synthesis in
A. tridentata

Big sagebrush leaves are known to synthesize and store
large quantities of terpenoids on the epidermal surfaces
of glandular leaf trichomes [14]. Therefore, a search was
conducted among the annotated contigs to identify
putative genes that code for enzymes involved in terpenoid synthesis via the Mevalonic acid (MVA) and 2-CMethyl-D-Erythritol-4-Phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic
pathways [2]. Most of the enzymes involved in these
pathways were detected in our annotated contig
sequences, and are presented in the additional materials
(Additional File 2). Coumarin derivatives are considered
as a tool for subspecies identification because big sagebrush subspecies differ in their amount of fluorescence
[15,16]. We also searched the annotated contigs for
enzymes involved in coumarin biosynthesis. Coumarins
in plants are derived via the phenylpropanoid pathway
from p-coumaroyl CoA [17,18]. At the top of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine lyase acts on the
substrate L-phenylalanine, and converts it to cinnamate
(often, trans-cinnamate) which is then oxidized to pcoumarate by the enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. The
enzyme 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA ligase then ligates an
S-CoA group to p-coumarate, forming p-coumaroyl
CoA. We were able to detect putative gene sequences
for these three main enzymes involved in coumarin
synthesis in our annotated contig dataset. Individual
tests of enzymatic substrates and products are needed to
confirm their roles in coumarin synthesis within big
sagebrush.
Discovery and frequency of SNPs in ESTs

A large number of resident SNPs were discovered within
the accessions examined in this study. A search for
SNPs yielded 59,093 ssp. tridentata (1 SNP/246 bp)

respectively.

SNPs with an average base coverage of 18 × and 61,028
ssp. vaseyana SNPs (1 SNP/207 bp) with an average
base coverage of 15×. These putative SNPs may represent a high level of heterozygosity that exists in big
sagebrush through its large effective population size and
its wind-pollinated reproductive strategy. Future segregation analysis would be needed to ascertain if these
putative SNPs are truly two alleles at a single locus or
an artifact of the sequencing and/or assembly process.
The individual assemblies contained many fewer SNPs
than detected in the combined assembly (135,310) prior
to filtering those SNPs that were not discriminatory
between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana (i.e. nearly
homogeneous within a single DNA source, but different
between the two DNA sources within a contig).
When only SNPs that were near homogenous (>90%)
within the two accessions were considered, a total of
20,952 SNPs were detected between the sspp. tridentata
and vaseyana when a threshold of 8 × coverage was
applied (average of 20 × coverage, Figure 3). The SNP
density in the EST sequences between subspecies was 1
SNP/1123 bp. The analysis showed that 8,598 (29%) of
the total consensus sequences contained at least one
SNP and SNPs per contig ranged from 4,037 contigs
with a single SNP to a single contig with 39 SNPs (Figure 4). We chose to exclude SNPs that were less that
90% homogeneous within either accession 1) to provide
a reduced set SNPs that could discriminate between the
two subspecies and 2) to allow for some degree of
sequencing error at the SNP position when there was
low sequence coverage. To estimate the effect of SNP
heterogeneity within a DNA source, SNPs were also
identified with a threshold of homogeneity for SNPs of
99%. This resulted in the detection of 18,173 SNPs indicating that 13% of the SNPs originally detected either
ssp. tridentata or ssp. vaseyana had more than one base
at that position albeit at a low frequency. These multiple
bases could be the result of heterozygosity, differential

expression of alleles, assembly error, or sequencing
error. Some of the contigs with high number of SNPs
(>13 SNPs) are likely artifacts of applying a single set of
assembly parameters to a set of heterogeneous genes
and splice forms - each with their own evolutionary history. Collectively, contigs with an abundance of SNPs
(>13) are best avoided in future population genetic studies, though individually each contig with a multitude of
SNPs might provide an interesting case study of gene or
gene family evolution. Contigs with a high number of
SNPs have been highlighted in Additional File 3 along
with metadata for each contig. Of 20,952 SNPs, 16,317
SNPs were distributed in the putative coding sequence
and 4,365 SNPs were in the 5’or 3’ untranslated regions.
Forty-two percent of the identified SNPs fit within the
20 to 30% range for minor allele frequency, 30% within
the 30 to 40% range and the remaining 28% within the
40 to 50% range. As expected, the transition mutations
(A/G or C/T) were the most abundant, outnumbering
the transversion mutations (A/T, C/A, G/C, G/T) by 3.4
× margin (Table 2). All SNP information of the combined assembly and the sequences with SNPs have been
deposited in dbSNP in Genbank. The SNPs are submitted under the handle UDALL_LAB (Genbank:
ss252842630 to ss252863866; build B133). Full contig
sequences are available upon request.

polymorphic SSRs were identified by counting differences in the numbers of repeat motifs during informatic
comparison of ssp. tridentata sequences to ssp.
vaseyana sequences. This resulted in detection of 119
polymorphic SSRs in 117 contigs between the two subspecies. Comparing these 119 SSR motif structures to
the SSR motif structures identified in individual assemblies, we observed that 111 (93%) SSRs in the combined
assembly were found to be identical to those in the individual assemblies and 8 (7%) had a different number of
repeats than detected in the individual assemblies.

Discovery and frequency of SSRs in ESTs

The individual and combined assemblies of ESTs were
used for the SSR analysis. The individual assembly analysis resulted in a total of 908 contigs containing 1,003
SSRs and 466 contigs containing 507 SSRs in ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana, respectively. Homopolymer
SSRs that are reported by default in MISA were not
reported because of known limitations of 454 sequencing chemistry. The occurrence and frequency of different SSR motif repeats in EST sequences of the two
subspecies were explored (Table 3). Although both subspecies have a similar number of reads, the frequency of
each type of SSR motif was almost doubled in ssp. tridentata compared to ssp. vaseyana (Figure 5). As might
be expected from data containing open reading frames,
the most common type of repeat was a trinucleotide
motif (74.7% in ssp. tridentata, 88% in ssp. vaseyana),
followed by a dinucleotide motif (18.5% in ssp. tridentata, 5.3% in ssp. vaseyana) and a hexanucleotide motif
(3% in ssp. tridentata, 4% in ssp. vaseyana; Table 3).
Repeat motifs unique to each subspecies were also
detected. Excluding the counts of SSRs in compound
formation, subspecies tridentata had 143 unique SSRs
and ssp. vaseyana had 51 unique SSRs, relative to each
other. The most dominant repeat motif overall is AC/
GT with a frequency of 15.15% (152 of 1,003) in ssp. tridentata, whereas the most dominant repeat motif in
both subspecies is ACC/GGT with a frequency of 13.4%
(134 of 1003 in ssp. tridentata) and 20.7% (105 of 507
in ssp. vaseyana). We were unable to detect any CG/GC
motif in either subspecies’ EST sequences. This could be
due to limitations of emPCR used by the 454 sequencing protocol. Additional details about di- and trinucleotide repeat motifs in both subspecies are listed in
Additional File 4.
In addition to MISA-detected SSRs, a custom Perl
script was used to identify putative polymorphic SSRs
between ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana in the combined assembly. Within an assembled contig, the

SNP and SSR validation

SNPs and SSRs found in the EST assembly were independently validated. SNPs between A. tridentata subspecies were directly validated using two different
experimental approaches: subsequent Sanger re-sequencing of cDNA amplicons (primers listed in Additional
File 5) and by re-sequencing targeted loci by sequence
capture. SNPs were not considered validated unless both
expected bases were identified in subsequent sequencing
efforts and a distinction was made between two different
types of validation. Validation Type 1 was where the two
different bases identified in the EST assembly were
detected at the SNP position (within individual, subspecies, or species). Validation Type 2 was where the two
different bases identified in the EST assembly were
detected at the SNP position and they were consistently
different between the two subspecies of A. tridentata, as
originally detected.
Subsequent Sanger re-sequencing of cDNA amplicons
was performed on the same individuals as used for EST
sequencing. Analysis of fragment sizes on agarose gel
confirmed amplification of all (15 loci) targeted with primers in both subspecies cDNA. Of these loci, 6 were
chosen for Sanger re-sequencing. Three SNPs were transitions (1 C↔T; 1 G↔A; 1 T↔C) and three were transversions (2 T↔G; 1 C↔G). The SNP base were
validated in cDNA from both subspecies for six of six

tridentata and A. t. ssp. Vaseyana.

SNPs (Type 1) and three of six (Type 2), confirming
their respective identification within the combined
assembly. In the EST assembly, coverage of the chosen
SNPs ranged from 9 to 27X and from 20% to 46% in
their minor allele frequency. There was no obvious relationship between the amount of EST coverage and SNP
validation in this small subset.
Re-sequencing targeted loci by sequence capture was
also used to validate SNPs in two distinct individuals of
ssp. tridentata and two distinct individuals of ssp.
vaseyana (results for each SNP are listed Additional File
6). 369 ESTs containing 572 discriminating SNPs
between the two subspecies were targeted for re-sequencing by sequence capture. These targets were selected
based on putative EST function (terpenoid and coumarin biosynthetic pathways) rather than SNP density,
thus some contigs had several more SNPs than others.
Reads obtained from sequence capture were mapped to
their respective reference targets (consensus sequences
of contigs from the combined assembly) resulting and
403 SNPs in 134 contigs had capture reads overlapping
their respective positions. Both SNP bases were detected
at 270 (67%) of the SNP positions (Type 1) and 218
(54%) of the SNP bases were polymorphic (Type 2)
between the two independent individuals of ssp. tridentata and two independent individuals of ssp. vaseyana
used for sequence capture. Of the 46% of the SNP positions that did not validate (Type 2), only a single type of
base was detected in these four individuals (monomorphic) and the base call always matched one of the
expected bases at the SNP. For these monomorphic
SNPs, additional sequence coverage of SNP likely would
not identify the ‘other’ base and change our interpretation because these SNPs had an average of 12.6
sequence coverage. 8% of the SNP positions had an
additional or third base at the SNP position of a single
read in these four individuals.
The low validation rates of SNPs (Type 1: 67% and
Type 2: 54%) derived from ESTs could be due to several

factors including different genotypes of individual plants,
allelic expression biases of sagebrush genes combined
with a moderate amount 454 EST sequencing, and
errors due to mapping reads to a non-sequenced genome. Different genotypes of individual plants could
explain the low SNP validation rate between subspecies.
For example, 38% and 10% of SNPs initially detected in
our EST assembly were polymorphic between the two
individuals of ssp. tridentata and polymorphic between
the two individuals of ssp. vaseyana, respectively. Individual genotypic differences could also explain the 67%
level of two-base detection at SNP positions (intra- or
inter-subspecies). Of the 403 SNP loci, 16-36% had both
bases in individual plants (i.e. putative heterozygotes).
Thus, it is not too surprising that the four individuals
sampled for validation were also coincidently homozygous for many SNPs found in ESTs of a ssp. tridentata
and in ESTs of a ssp. vaseyana individual, particularly if
either of the two originally EST-sampled individuals
contained a low frequency allele.
SSRs were validated by re-sequencing of Sanger amplicons, 15 loci were selected from the combined EST
assembly. Ten of the 15 primer pairs amplified loci in
leaf cDNA from both subspecies. Of these 10 loci, 5 loci
were selected for Sanger re-sequencing. Re-sequencing
of the selected PCR-amplified cDNA sequences confirmed the MISA-detected SSRs (Additional File 5). Variation in repeat length of the re-sequenced loci was
verified between subspecies in 3 of the 5 loci. Of these
three SSRs, (CTT)6 and (GCA)7 were bioinformatically
detected a priori as polymorphic, based on the Perl
script parameters, whereas (ATA)5 was not, suggesting
that the number of bioinformatically identified polymorphic SSRs was an underestimate of the number of
truly polymorphic SSRs. We expect that more SSR loci
likely exist but they were under the conservative thresholds used in our bioinformatic analysis. The sequence
capture experiment also validated a number of SSRs in
contig consensus sequences of the combined assembly.
Capture targets included 17 putative SSRs, of which 14
had overlapping reads from sequence capture. In every
instance, the presence of an SSR was confirmed. Of
these 17 SSRs, five SSRs were polymorphic in repeat
number, four SSRs contained SNP polymorphisms in
one or more repeats, and five SSRs did not have any
polymorphisms detected in the sequence capture reads.
Marker evaluation in genomic DNA

Because of our interest in marker utilization for population genetic studies in genomic DNA (as opposed to
ESTs), 15 SSR and 15 SNP primer pairs were evaluated
in big sagebrush genomic DNA. Genomic SSR loci were
also amplified from the same individuals using the same
primers used for SSR validation in cDNA. Fourteen

Approximately 2.5 million and 10.5 million Illumina
reads were obtained from the Montana and Utah ssp.
wyomingensis samples, respectively. After trimming the
5’ ends of the sequences to remove barcodes, the
sequences were aligned to the combined EST assembly
(obtained from 454 sequencing of normalized cDNA
libraries) as a sequence reference. In the Montana sample, the Illumina reads overlapped 695 SNP positions at
a depth of ≥ 20 × with 10% of the reads containing at
least one variant. At these SNP positions, both allelic
variants (matching the two diploid subspecies) were verified at 251 SNPs. The ssp. tridentata base matched at
138 additional SNP positions and the ssp. vaseyana base
matched at 306 other SNP positions. In the Utah sample, Illumina reads overlapped 1,039 SNP positions at a
depth of ≥ 20 × with 10% of the reads containing at
least one variant. At these SNP positions, both allelic
variants (matching the two diploid subspecies) were verified at 458 SNPs. The ssp. tridentata base matched 157
additional SNP positions and the ssp. vaseyana based
matched at 424 other SNPs positions. Verified SNPs
from the Montana sample were distributed among 484
contigs of the combined assembly, and verified SNPs

Directional selection in subspecies genes

To detect functional sequence diversity and diversifying
selection, putative exon sequences were compared
between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana. Comparison of
synonymous base substitutions (K s ) and non-synonymous base substitutions (Ka) between the two subspecies would suggest whether these sequences were
influenced by stabilizing or diversifying selection. The
distribution of the calculated Ka/Ks ratios for the contigs
was found to be ranging from 0.0132 to 6.4000; however
any Ka/Ks value greater than 2.5000 was discarded during the analysis assuming that such high values likely
resulted from alignment errors. The resultant distribution had a median of 0.2959 (standard deviation =
0.2627). A bootstrap analysis with 146,744 data points at
95% confidence level (a = 0.025) was also performed on
the Ka/Ks distribution, which resulted in 0.0791 as the
lower limit and 1.0880 as the upper limit of the confidence interval bracket. A histogram of the Ka/Ks distribution is shown (Figure 6). Following a method similar
to Novaes et al. [19], we further classified genes with
Ka/Ks < 0.15 to be under stabilizing selection, and Ka/Ks
between 0.50 and 2.50 for diversifying selection, and
compared the Ka/Ks distribution with the gene annotation results. This approach gave us 978 annotated contigs in stabilizing category and 923 annotated contigs in
diversifying category. In both categories, the distribution

Detection of allelic SNP variants in ssp. wyomingensis

from the Utah sample were distributed among 767 contigs. This variability of SNP detection is not surprising
as the leaf tissue samples for Illumina cDNA sequencing
were collected in different environments under different
conditions and the cDNA fragments were not normalized (like the diploid cDNAs) or modified in any way to
alter the association between gene expression levels and
number of reads per gene.

Frequency

(93%) SSR loci out of 15 SSR loci amplified in both
sspp. tridentata and vaseyana and 11 (73%) SSR loci out
of 15 SSR loci amplified in ssp. wyomingensis. These 11
primers pairs produced fragments of expected sizes in
all three subspecies. Re-sequencing of genomic DNA
amplicons for SSR validation was not performed, but we
expect that the amplified genomic DNA fragments also
contain the targeted SSRs.
Of the 15 SNP primer pairs, 11 (73%) amplified targeted loci in all three subspecies including the five loci
used for cDNA SNP validation. The genomic fragments
of these five loci were sequenced in two ssp. tridentata
individuals, three ssp. vaseyana individuals and two ssp.
wyomingensis individuals. For two loci, we observed that
both sspp. tridentata and vaseyana were homozygous at
each SNP allele (as expected from the combined assembly) while ssp. wyomingensis was dimorphic (i.e. contained both bases). In two different loci, ssp.
wyomingensis sequences contained a single variant
matching either ssp. tridentata or ssp. vaseyana variant.
The remaining SNP remained unconfirmed due to poor
Sanger sequencing results. Additional Sanger validation
of individual SNP loci would have been an overly laborious process since other sequencing methods exist for
validating larger numbers of SNPs (sequence capture
and Illumina re-sequencing). Instead of individually genotyping SNP additional loci, genotypic assessment of
ssp. wyomingensis at putative SNPs loci was determined
en masse using Illumina sequencing (see below).

Discussion
Previous reports of ESTs from non-model, yet ecologically and economically important organisms have been
successfully sequenced and annotated using next generation sequencing [19-21]. Here, we have used 454 nextgeneration sequencing to generate the first transcriptome sequence data for big sagebrush, a key ecological
species of the western North America. Similar to reports
of other efforts, the assembled ESTs of big sagebrush
were further analyzed to generate a functional characterization of the transcriptome and discover putative molecular markers (SSRs and SNPs). A surprisingly high
level of nucleotide diversity was also found within individual assemblies of ESTs from big sagebrush
accessions.
To generate a functional characterization of the big
sagebrush transcriptome, we compared the contigs and
singletons obtained from the combined assembly to peptides within the non-redundant protein database using
BLASTx. The low number of matches (54 contigs) to
Artemisia annua sequences is probably due to fewer
number of A. annua sequences available in the NR database compared to species such as Vitis vinifera. We
expect that the numbers of hits will substantially
increase with the eventual publication and annotation of
an A. annua and other Artemisia and Asteraceae genome sequences. A majority (69.8%) of the assembled
sequences did not align with any peptide in the NR
database, possibly indicating the presence of substantial
number of novel genes in A. tridentata transcriptome
and related taxa. Genes of unknown function are not
unexpected, as the discovery of novel genes has been
demonstrated in other EST sequencing projects within
non-agricultural plant families [2,22].
Many of the contigs and singleton ESTs identified in
this study are expected to have ecological and adaptive
relevance. Previous studies relating sagebrush biochemistry to mule deer feeding preference suggest strong correlation between the composition and concentration of
secondary metabolites, especially terpenoids, and mule
deer preference of sagebrush [23,24]. We were able to
identify many, but not all, of the genes coding enzymes
involved in MVA, MEP, and phenylpropenoid pathways.
The failure to detect all genes from these pathways
could be explained by a lack of transcriptome coverage
and/or by a lack of pathway documentation of these
specific genes [25]. The detection of major enzymes
involved in phenylpropanoid pathway in big sagebrush

Page 9 of 15

and variation within these pathways may aid in elucidating herbivore preferences and trade-offs between
defense responses.
Polymorphisms in A. tridentata ESTs

A large number of SNP and SSR markers were discovered and different subsets of SNPs were validated using
Sanger amplicon sequencing of cDNA and genomic
DNA, Illumina cDNA sequencing of ssp. wyomingensis,
and sequence capture. We verified (Type 1) six of six
tested SNPs using amplicon Sanger sequencing of individually selected PCR fragments. Additional verification
(Sanger sequencing of next-generation sequencing
results) was deemed unnecessary due to past experience
in Arabidopsis [26], Amaranth [27,28], and cotton
(Udall, personal communication) using this same conservative bioinformatic pipeline. These other studies verified 100% of 5 × more SNPs using Sanger resequencing of amplicons and demonstrated that they
segregated in mapping populations such that genetic
maps were reliably constructed. Similar to these other
studies, a small number of genotypes (2) were used for
SNP discovery in sagebrush ESTs. It was possible that
the two individuals selected for EST sequencing could
also represent minor alleles at a number of SNPs. Thus,
the SSRs and SNPs that we report here represent DNA
differences between individuals and differences between
subspecies.
In our efforts to describe SNPs in big sagebrush, we
have also quantified the number of SNPs that were due
to subspecies differences and those that were due to
individual differences. The high numbers of SNPs
between individuals, apparent in the individual assemblies (of two individuals), in the validation using ssp.
wyomingensis, and in the sequence capture assemblies
(of four individuals) suggested significant amounts of
nucleotide diversity between individual genomes of Artemisia. This evidence was supported by three findings. 1)
When discriminating SNPs between ssp. tridentata and
ssp. vaseyana were re-identified at a higher stringency
than 90% (at 99%), 13% of the SNPs were not detected
because of a single parameter requiring a degree of
homogeneity among residues originating from a single
DNA source. This suggests that both individuals used
for EST sequencing contained a high number of heterozygous loci. 2) Using Illumina sequencing, only 36% and
44% of the SNP positions had both alleles detected in
the ssp. wyomingesis samples respectively, where nearly
all of the SNP positions were at least represented by
one or the other allele. This indicated that both alleles
of a significant number of the SNPs exist in a third A.
tridentata subspecies, but a true polyploid hybrid of
these the two diploid subspecies would contain both
alleles of all SNPs. Thus, the ssp. wyomingensis samples

Bajgain et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:370
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/370

used here were likely derived from different diploids and
those individuals had significantly different genotypes
than those used for EST sequencing. 3) Using sequence
capture, only 54% of the 403 SNP positions were validated as discriminatory between ssp. tridentata and ssp.
vaseyana, but 67% of the SNP positions had both bases
detected. Thus, 13% of the sequence capture validated
SNP positions also appeared to be heterogeneous (two
nucleotides) within the collected individuals used for
sequence capture. Indeed, a significant number of SNPs
were found between individual plants within A. tridentata subspecies. Much of this nucleotide diversity at
initially identified SNP loci could be at heterozygous
loci, though we are careful not to describe it as such
until allelism between nucleotide residues is fully established through segregation analysis. Recall that these
EST sequences contain both coding and non-coding
sequence (particularly the 3’ UTR as the poly-A tail was
used for priming the cDNA synthesis). A high level of
nucleotide diversity in these coding and non-coding
sequences is certainly plausible considering the very
large effective population size of big sagebrush and
wind-pollination strategy [29].
Given the high level of heterozygosity due to the outcrossing nature of big sagebrush populations [29], we
expect that a large number of inter-subspecific SNPs
and intra-subspecific SNPs could be used in conducting
subspecies level association genetics studies. To date, little or no sequence of big sagebrush has been made publicly available, thus the SNPs reported here represent a
starting point for such future population genetic studies
of big sagebrush. While they may form the basis of
future molecular studies, caution is needed because
informative SNP comparisons will depend on the specific individuals selected for genetic analysis. Alternatively,
our study suggests that a sequenced based approach to
population genetics such as a population-wide genome
reduction strategy [28] or amplicon analysis should be
considered because of the expense required for assay
development and their potential use in few, specific A.
tridentata individuals. Such an approach would avoid
extrapolation of our putative SNPs specific to these individuals to a larger population of individuals (e.g. subspecies’ specific SNPs that were likely due to genetic
variation between individuals) by generating accessionspecific data for each newly sequenced accession. Implementation of such study among spatially distributed big
sagebrush populations would 1) enlighten our understanding of natural selection on genes and gene complexes controlling adaptive traits, and the evolution of
these trait-linked loci and 2) provide relatedness metrics
between natural populations of these subspecies and
their hybrid zones. Though we briefly touched on these
questions by using independent genotypes for SNP

Page 10 of 15

validation, these questions are out of the scope of this
particular study that aims to primarily characterize EST
sequences of big sagebrush and provide insight regarding the origins of ssp. wyomingensis.
Regarding the discovered SSRs, we were surprised to
find that all SSR repeat motif types detected were much
more abundant in ssp. tridentata compared to ssp.
vaseyana. The reduced levels of SSR in ssp. vaseyana
ESTs compared to ssp. tridentata could be due to differential gene expression since different loci were sampled
with our non-replicated experimental design. While
leaves from both plants were harvested at the same time
in common garden, phenological differences between
the subspecies might have caused differences in expression levels and thus, changes in the number and types
of detected SSRs. While gene expression could explain
some of the differences, many such EST-SSRs have been
found to be reliable molecular markers in other species
[22,30-33] and they represent hypothetical (i.e. testable)
genetic divergences between the subspecies.
Ka/Ks and gene evolution in big sagebrush

The ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana suggest
possible selection pressure resulting in the maintenance
of subspecies divergence, as similar trends have been
observed in various organisms [34-37]. Since natural
selection shapes phenotypes and genotypes in favor of
adapted traits, the Ka/Ks ratio of less than 1 for a large
number of contigs could be a result of either stabilizing
or diversifying selection within both subspecies, depending upon the magnitude of the ratio. Or if divergence
times are very recent, it could also be the hallmark of
purifying selection on the adapted common ancestor of
these two subspecies. For example, Contig_29840 (Ka/Ks
= 0.106) was annotated for ‘aquaporin’ protein. Considering that big sagebrush grows in variety of soils and
arid plains, valleys and foothills of mountains, the
importance of aquaporin proteins in water balance is
critical and the genes coding for aquaporin proteins
could have been under stabilizing selection. A formal
investigation of molecular evolution within these species
(with a proper outgroup) would place selection pressure
relative to species divergence.
Exploring the inter-subspecies hybridization hypothesis

Hybridization can be of great importance to the ecological adaptation and subsequent evolution of offspring
because of the novel genetic recombination and spatial
selection [38-40]. Generally, allopolyploid formation is
considered to have arisen through hybridization between
unreduced gametes [41-43]. Several studies have been
conducted on hybrid populations formed from A. t. ssp.
tridentata and A. t. ssp. vaseyana to investigate

Bajgain et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:370
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/370

hybridization events. Generally, these hybrid populations
are formed in a narrow zone between the two ecotypes
[29,44-47]. In this study, we did not select a tetraploid
ssp. wyomingensis along with diploid representatives of
its two neighboring ssp. tridentata and ssp. vaseyana
populations. Instead, selected ssp. tridentata and ssp.
vaseyana accessions were chosen for EST sequencing
based on penetrance of specific, subspecies morphological markers (i.e. trueness to type). Thus, variation at
SNP loci for the diploid-tetraploid comparison is a mixture of individual variation, variation within inter-mating
populations, and variation between subspecies in this
study. Based on the number of Illumina reads that actually did map to discriminating SNPs between sspp. tridentata and vaseyana, the tetraploid ssp. wyomingensis
samples appeared to contain both alleles for a large
number of loci (251/695 Montana; 458/1,039 Utah). The
presence of both alleles at approximately one-third of
the loci suggests that ssp. wyomingensis either originated
as an allotetraploid from a hybridization event of 2 n
gametes between sspp. tridentata and vaseyena or
formed as a autopolyploid from both diploid subspecies
with subsequent hybridization. Since allopolyploids have
been reported between diploids and tetraploids of ssp.
tridentata and ssp. vaseyena [9,29,46,48], a similar scenario is plausible for the origin of ssp. wyomingensis. A
focused genetic study within and between putative
hybrid zones of big sagebrush is needed to further elucidate the origins and reproducibility of hybridization processes involved in ssp. wyomingensis formation. If
tetraploid recurrence is a common feature of ssp. wyomingensis, perhaps only populations of ssp. tridentata
and ssp. vaseyana need active management during
environmental conversation of wildlands because a tetraploid hybrid between the two locally adapted accessions could be expected to form and repopulate
geographic zones between the diploid subspecies.

Conclusions
This study is the first of its kind to perform transcriptome sequencing of big sagebrush subspecies, generating
large selections of genetic resources (EST sequences,
SNP markers and microsatellites) for this ecologically
important group of range and forest plants. The EST
sequences were annotated to identify putative gene
functions, and select genes involved in putative terpenoid and coumarin synthesis were bioinformatically
identified. The distribution of SNPs among A. tridentata
subspecies and the estimation of depth and divergence
of mutations provide insights about the magnitude of
neutral divergence and natural selection between these
subspecies, and a foundation of sequence references for
future population genomic and functional genetic studies. The cost-effective, rapid and reliable way of

Page 11 of 15

obtaining nuclear sequences through transcriptome
sequencing also provided insights on gene divergence
and marker development in big sagebrush. Future studies integrating common garden, provenance and reciprocal transplantation of defined genetic stocks with this
genomic information will immeasurably add to our
understanding patterns of genes and their roles in adaptive traits among big sagebrush populations.

Methods
Plant materials and RNA extraction

Young leaves from two subspecies of big sagebrush, A.
tridentata ssp. tridentata and A. tridenata ssp.
vaseyana, were harvested from plants growing in USDA
Shrub Lab greenhouse in Provo, UT for 454-pyrosequencing (Additional File 5). The plants were grown
from seeds collected in their natural habitat near Park
Valley, UT. The leaves were flash frozen in liquid N 2
and stored in -80°C until further use. RNA extraction
was performed using approximately 0.1 g of frozen leaf
tissue, following a modified hot borate procedure [49].
The extracted RNA was analyzed for quality and quantified using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, CA) before using for cDNA synthesis.
cDNA library preparation for 454-pyrosequencing

cDNA was created using 1 μg of total RNA using the
SMART cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.,
Mountain View, CA), but the cDNA synthesis primer for
first strand synthesis was replaced by a modified oligo-dT
primer (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTCGCAGTCGGTACTTTTTTCTTTTTTV-3’) [50]. The poly-T
stretch in the primer is broken by inserting a Cytosine to
minimize the potential sequencing problems due to the presence of a long ploy-A homopolymer stretch. The cDNA
library was normalized using the Trimmer Kit (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia) to limit redundant sequencing of highly
expressed genes. We did not directly test normalization
values since so few transcripts were known for big sagebrush
prior to this report. The normalization control included with
the Trimmer Kit was reduced in copy number as expected.
Because this control was normalized as expected, we
assumed that a similar normalization of highly expressed
genes also occurred in our two sagebrush samples. Adaptors
ligation and single strand selection were done as described
in the GS FLX Titanium General Library Preparation Kit
(Roche, Branford, CT) with modifications. One half-plate
was sequenced for each subspecies at the Brigham Young
University DNA sequencing center, Provo, UT.
Illumina sequencing of A. t. ssp. wyomingensis and SNP
mapping

Leaves were harvested from two young A. t. ssp. wyomingensis plants growing in USDA Shrub Lab

Bajgain et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:370
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/370

greenhouse in Provo, UT. The plants were grown from
seeds collected in their natural habitat in two different
states - Montana and Utah. Geographic information on
sampled individuals is provided in Additional file 5. Tetraploid confirmation was conducted on a Partec PAII
flow cytometer. Leaves from each plant along with a
known A. tridentata ssp. tridentata diploid standard
were finely chopped in a buffer and then nuclei were
stained with DAPI solution (CyStain UV Precise P, Partec). Total RNA was harvested and quantified in the
same manner as mentioned above. The RNA was processed for sequencing following directions in the Illumina mRNA Sequencing Sample Prep Guide (part
#1004898 rev. D., Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA), with
the addition of custom barcoded adapters designed for
the paired-end sequencing process [51]. The quality of
the libraries was validated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The prepared libraries of the ssp. wyomingensis
individuals were multiplexed in approximately equal
concentrations and sequenced in two separate runs (one
single end 80 bp run, and a second paired end 80 bp
run) on the Illumina Genome Analyzer at the Oregon
State University Center for Gene Research and Biocomputing, Corvallis, OR. Pooled libraries were loaded onto
one lane of an Illumina Genome Analyzer II at 5 pM
concentration. Cluster generation and sequencing used
Illumina version 3.0 reagents, and image acquisition and
base calling used the Illumina pipeline version 1.5.
These Illumina sequences were used only to verify in
ssp. wyomingensis the SNP loci detected on the combined assembly of sspp. tridentata and vaseyana
obtained from 454 sequences.
Bowtie [52] was used to sort and align the Illumina
reads to the ‘reference’ combined assembly, with no
gaps and allowing a single base mismatch. The mismatch alignment results were compared to the SNPs
obtained from the combined assembly of two subspecies, and the output was parsed so that the SNPs were
covered by 1 or more ssp. wyomingensis reads. For confident SNP calling, we required only the SNPs covered
by coverage of 20 × or more be counted; and 10% of all
the reads overlapping a SNP were required to be of a
particular variant in order to avoid SNP detection that
could have resulted from sequencing errors.
EST sequence de novo assembly and annotation

A combined de novo assembly of the sequences from
both subspecies was performed using CLC Genomics
Workbench Version 3.7.1 (CLC bio, Cambridge, MA).
The sequence ends were trimmed to remove the barcodes added during library preparation, and any
sequence shorter than 50 bp was not included in building the assembly. The mismatch cost for the nucleotides
was set at 2 while both the insertion cost and deletion

Page 12 of 15

cost for nucleotides in the reads were set at 3. The
length fraction and the similarity of the sequences were
set at 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. Any conflicts among the
individual bases in the reads were resolved by voting for
the base with maximum number of repetitions. A minimum read length of 200 bp was set for an assembled
sequence to be counted as a contig. Identical parameters
were also used to create individual assemblies from both
subspecies. Homologies of the contigs and singletons
were identified by comparing against the NCBI NR protein database using BLASTx with cut-off e-value of 1e15
. The blast results were imported into Blast2GO Version 2.4.2 for mapping the consensus sequences into
GO terms. To summarize the distribution of the
sequences into GO terms of three main categories - biological processes, cellular components and molecular
functions, GO annotations were formatted for input into
the GOSlim program [53]. The consensus sequences
from combined assembly of both subspecies were also
searched against the Pfam-A database using the
HMMER software Version 3.0 [54]. Protein sequences
generated by ESTScan Version 2-2.1, using the Arabidopsis thaliana gene sequences as the reference matrix,
were used for this purpose.
Polymorphism detection

SNPs were identified between the subspecies using the
Perl script used by Maughan et al. [28]. For the nucleotides to be counted as a SNP, the following parameters
were required: 1) the coverage depth of the read at the
SNP was ≥ 8; 2) the minimum frequency of the minor
allele was 20%; and 3) within each possible nucleotide at
that SNP position, ≥ 90% of its bases at the SNP position are from a single subspecies (i.e. ’heterozygosity’ at
10%). For example, a G↔A SNP would be included in
the list of SNPs at coverage of 100×, if, out of 100
aligned sequences, 80 sequences came from one subspecies with at least 72 sequences calling for a G, and 20
sequences came from another subspecies with at least
18 sequences calling for an A at the SNP position. Primers for SNP validation were designed using Primer3
[55].
Perl script MISA (MIcroSAtellite identification tool,
[56]) was also used to identify SSRs in the assembled
consensus sequences. Motif repeats between di and
deca-units were searched for in the assembly of each
subspecies. For repetitive nucleotide stretches to be
counted as an SSR unit, di-nucleotide repeats had to be
present in frequency of 7 units, tri-nucleotide to octanucleotide repeats in frequency of 5 units and nonaand deca-nucleotide in frequency of 4 repeats. The
interruption distance among any type of compound SSR
units was set at 100 bp. Using the same parameters
used by MISA to detect SSRs in each subspecies dataset,

the program SSR locator [57] was used to detect SSRs
and design primers in the combined assembly of
sequences of both subspecies. An additional, custom
Perl script was written to bioinformatically distinguish
polymorphic SSR loci between the two subspecies (’true’
SSRs). An SSR would be counted as a polymorphic SSR
if an indel of the whole repeat motif and/or few bases in
the motif was detected in the consensus sequences of
each subspecies.
Polymorphism Validation

Sanger re-sequencing of both subspecies cDNA validated consensus sequences containing SNPs and the
SSRs. Fifteen putative SNP loci and SSR loci were randomly selected for PCR amplification. We selected 11
SNPs with transition mutation and 4 with transversion
mutations for PCR amplification followed by SNP validation by re-sequencing. For validation purpose, we
selected equal number of transitions and transversions
(3 each, 6 total). The SSR primers were designed to
amplify 4 di-, 5 tri-, and 4 tetra-, 1 penta- and 1 hexanucleotide SSRs of varying lengths. Two tetraploid ssp.
tridentata individuals, two diploid and one tetraploid
ssp. vaseyana individuals and two tetraploid ssp. wyomingensis individuals from geographically divergent
sources were used for SNP and SSR marker evaluation
in genomic DNA. Geographic information on these individuals is provided in Additional File 5. The following
settings were followed for PCR amplification of both
SNP and SSR loci: 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 × PCR buffer, 0.2
mM dNTPs, 0.6 μM of each primer, 1 U Taq polymerase and dH2O to a final reaction volume of 10 μl ran in
the following thermal profile: 94°C 3 min, 35 × (94°C 30
s, Tm depending upon the primers used 45 s, 72°C 1
min) and final extension of 72°C 10 min. PCR reactions
of both SNP loci and SSR loci were cleaned using Qiaquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and
then mixed with appropriate primers prior to sequencing. Fragments were sequenced with an ABI 3730xl
DNA analyzer at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI. The primers used for SNP
and SSR validation are listed in Additional File 5.
SNPs and SSRs were validated by sequencing 369
genes containing 572 SNPs in sspp. tridentata and
vaseyana using sequence capture. DNA extractions were
made of NVT-2 and UTT-2 (ssp. tridentata collected
from 39°29’22’’ 117°85’17’’ and 38°30’60’’ 109°38’76’’,
respectively) and UTV-1 and UTV-3 (ssp. vaseyana collected from 39°34’13’’ 111°52’21’’ and 38°34’13’’ 109°
21’73’’, respectively) RNA baits (120-mer) of the target
genes were synthesized after the contigs obtained from
the combined assembly. The DNA libraries for bait
hybridization were prepared using GS FLX Titanium
Rapid Library Preparation Kit (Roche, Branford, CT,

Page 13 of 15

USA). The baits were then hybridized to the library and
the capture sequences were prepared for 454-sequencing
following the MYselect protocol (MYcroarray, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA). The captured DNA libraries were
pooled and sequenced at the Brigham Young University
sequencing center, Provo, UT. Using 0.95 sequence
similarity, the capture reads were mapped to the reference contigs in order to place individual reads at previously called SNPs and SSRs using Genomics
Workbench 4 (CLCBio, Aarhus, Denmark). Custom Perl
scripts were used to assess SSR and SNP coverage and
validate the presence of SNP bases in distinct DNA
samples of sspp. tridentata and vaseyana.
Analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations

To find the changes in amino acid sequences due to single nucleotide mutations, we aligned sspp. tridentata
and vaseyana contigs that had their coding frame predicted using ESTScan. The proportion of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (Ka/Ks) was calculated
for each contig, following the Jukes-Cantor corrected
model of substitution using Bioperl modules [58]. We
however modified the Jukes-Cantor equation by adding
one unit to both non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions in order to obtain a valid Ka/Ks estimation in
instances where either type of substitution was absent.
Without this modification, we would have obtained Ka/
Ks value equal to zero for genes with no observed nonsynonymous substitutions, regardless of their Ks values.
Similarly, genes without any synonymous substitutions
would have undefined Ka/Ks.
