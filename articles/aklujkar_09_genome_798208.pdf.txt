Abstract
Background: The genome sequence of Geobacter metallireducens is the second to be completed
from the metal-respiring genus Geobacter, and is compared in this report to that of Geobacter
sulfurreducens in order to understand their metabolic, physiological and regulatory similarities and
differences.
Results: The experimentally observed greater metabolic versatility of G. metallireducens versus G.
sulfurreducens is borne out by the presence of more numerous genes for metabolism of organic
acids including acetate, propionate, and pyruvate. Although G. metallireducens lacks a dicarboxylic
acid transporter, it has acquired a second putative succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase
complex, suggesting that respiration of fumarate was important until recently in its evolutionary
history. Vestiges of the molybdate (ModE) regulon of G. sulfurreducens can be detected in G.
metallireducens, which has lost the global regulatory protein ModE but retained some putative
ModE-binding sites and multiplied certain genes of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Several
enzymes of amino acid metabolism are of different origin in the two species, but significant patterns
of gene organization are conserved. Whereas most Geobacteraceae are predicted to obtain
biosynthetic reducing equivalents from electron transfer pathways via a ferredoxin oxidoreductase,
G. metallireducens can derive them from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to
the evidence of greater metabolic versatility, the G. metallireducens genome is also remarkable for
the abundance of multicopy nucleotide sequences found in intergenic regions and even within
genes.
Conclusion: The genomic evidence suggests that metabolism, physiology and regulation of gene
expression in G. metallireducens may be dramatically different from other Geobacteraceae.

Background
Geobacter metallireducens is a member of the Geobacteraceae, a family of Fe(III)-respiring Delta-proteobacteria
that are of interest for their role in cycling of carbon and
metals in aquatic sediments and subsurface environments
as well as the bioremediation of organic- and metal-contaminated groundwater and the harvesting of electricity
from complex organic matter [1,2]. G. metallireducens is of
particular interest because it was the first microorganism
found to be capable of a number of novel anaerobic processes including: (1) conservation of energy to support
growth from the oxidation of organic compounds coupled to the reduction of Fe(III) or Mn(IV) [3,4]; (2) conversion of Fe(III) oxide to ultrafine-grained magnetite [3];
(3) anaerobic oxidation of an aromatic hydrocarbon
[5,6]; (4) reduction of U(VI) [7]; (5) use of humic substances as an electron acceptor [8]; (6) chemotaxis toward
metals [9]; (7) complete oxidation of organic compounds
to carbon dioxide with an electrode serving as the sole
electron acceptor ([10]; and (8) use of a poised electrode
as a direct electron donor [11]. Although the complete
genome sequence of the closely related Geobacter sulfurreducens is available [12] and can provide insights into some
of the common metabolic features of Geobacter species, G.
metallireducens and G. sulfurreducens are significantly different in many aspects of their physiology. G. sulfurreducens is known to use only four carbon sources: acetate,
formate, lactate (poorly) and pyruvate (only with hydrogen as electron donor), whereas G. metallireducens uses
acetate, benzaldehyde, benzoate, benzylalcohol, butanol,
butyrate, p-cresol, ethanol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, phydroxybenzoate, p-hydroxybenzylalcohol, isobutyrate,
isovalerate, phenol, propionate, propanol, pyruvate, toluene and valerate [2].
Therefore, in order to gain broader insight into the physiological diversity of Geobacter species, the genome of G.
metallireducens was sequenced and compared to that of
Geobacter sulfurreducens [12]. Both genome annotations
were manually curated with the addition, removal and
adjustment of hundreds of protein-coding genes and
other features. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted to
validate the findings, including homologs from the finished and unfinished genome sequences of more distantly
related Geobacteraceae. This paper presents insights into
the conserved and unique features of two Geobacter species, particularly the metabolic versatility of G. metallireducens and the numerous families of multicopy nucleotide
sequences in its genome, which suggest that regulation of
gene expression is very different in these two species.

Results and Discussion
Contents of the two genomes
The automated annotation of the G. metallireducens
genome identified 3518 protein-coding genes on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/109

chromosome of 3997420 bp and 13 genes on the plasmid
(designated pMET1) of 13762 bp. Manual curation added
59 protein-coding genes plus 56 pseudogenes to the chromosome and 4 genes to the plasmid. Ten of the chromosomal genes were reannotated as pseudogenes and
another 22 were removed from the annotation. In addition to the 58 RNA-coding genes in the automated annotation, manual curation identified 479 conserved
nucleotide sequence features. Likewise, to the 3446 protein-coding genes in the automated annotation of the G.
sulfurreducens genome [12], manual curation added 142
protein-coding genes and 19 pseudogenes. Five genes
were reannotated as pseudogenes and 103 genes were
removed from the annotation. In addition to the 55 RNAcoding genes in the automated annotation, manual curation identified 462 conserved nucleotide sequence features. Of the 3629 protein-coding genes and pseudogenes
in G. metallireducens, 2403 (66.2%) had one or more fulllength homologs in G. sulfurreducens.
The nucleotide composition of the 3563 intact proteincoding genes of G. metallireducens was determined in
order to identify some of those that were very recently
acquired. The average G+C content of the protein-coding
genes was 59.5%, with a standard deviation of 5.9%. Only
three genes had a G+C content more than two standard
deviations above the mean (> 71.2%), but 146 genes had
a G+C content more than two standard deviations below
the mean (< 47.7%), most of which lack homologs in G.
sulfurreducens and may be recent acquisitions (Additional
file 1: Table S1). Clusters of such genes (shaded in Additional file 1: Table S1) were often interrupted or flanked
by transposons with higher G+C content. The functions of
most of these genes cannot be assigned at present, but 23
of them are predicted to act in cell wall biogenesis.
Plasmid pMET1 of G. metallireducens consists of a series of
six predicted transcriptional units on one strand, tentatively attributed to the mobilization (Gmet_A3575Gmet_A3574-Gmet_A3573-Gmet_A3572-Gmet_A3643),
entry exclusion (Gmet_A3571), addiction (Gmet_A3570Gmet_A3579-Gmet_A3642), partition (Gmet_A3568Gmet_A3641), transposition (Gmet_A3567), and replication (Gmet_A3566-Gmet_A3565) functions of the plasmid, and one operon on the opposite strand, comprised
of three genes of unknown function (Gmet_A3576Gmet_A3577-Gmet_A3644). The predicted origin of replication, located 3' of the repA gene (Gmet_A3565),
includes four pairs of iterons and a set of six hairpins, suggesting that pMET1 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism, although it is significantly larger than most such
plasmids [13]. Among the fifteen other nucleotide
sequence features identified on the plasmid during manual curation was a palindromic putative autoregulatory
site (TTTGTTATACACGTATAACAAA) located 5' of the

addiction module. Other than the potential toxicity of the
addiction module, the impact of pMET1 on the physiology of G. metallireducens is unknown.
Metabolism of acetate and other carbon sources
Acetate is expected to be the key electron donor supporting Fe(III) reduction in aquatic sediments and subsurface
environments [14], and Geobacter species quickly become
the predominant bacterial species when acetate is injected
into subsurface environments to promote in situ bioremedation of uranium-contaminated groundwater [15,16].
Surprisingly, the initial activation of acetate by ligation
with coenzyme A (CoA) in G. sulfurreducens occurs by two
reversible pathways [17] (Figure 1), indicating that acetate
may be inefficiently utilized at low concentrations. These
two pathways are also present in G. metallireducens, along
with a third, irreversible reaction that may permit efficient
activation of acetate at low concentrations. The first pathway of acetate activation (Figure 1a) occurs through either
of two succinyl:acetate CoA-transferases that can convert
succinyl-CoA to succinate during oxidation of acetate by
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathway, in the same
capacity as succinyl-CoA synthetase but conserving energy
in the form of acetyl-CoA rather than GTP or ATP [17].
Microarray data from both species suggest that expression
of one succinyl:acetate CoA-transferase isoenzyme
(Gmet_1730 = GSU0174) is constant and expression of
the other (Gmet_3044 = GSU0490) is induced during acetate-fueled growth with electron acceptors other than sol-

species [20]. However, their substrate specificities may be
different because the G. metallireducens proteins and the
Clostridium proteins cluster phylogenetically with different CoA-transferases of Geobacter strain FRC-32 and Geobacter bemidjiensis (data not shown). The presence of these

uble Fe(III), such as Fe(III) oxides, nitrate, or fumarate (D.
Holmes, B. Postier, and R. Glaven, personal communications). The second pathway (Figure 1b) consists of two
steps: acetate kinase (Gmet_1034 = GSU2707) converts
acetate to acetyl-phosphate, which may be a global intracellular signal affecting various phosphorylation-dependent signalling systems, as in Escherichia coli [18]; and
phosphotransacetylase (Gmet_1035 = GSU2706) converts acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-CoA [17]. G. metallireducens possesses orthologs of the enzymes of both pathways
characterized in G. sulfurreducens [17], and also has an
acetyl-CoA synthetase (Gmet_2340, 42% identical to the
Bacillus subtilis enzyme [19]) for irreversible activation of
acetate to acetyl-CoA at the expense of two ATP (Figure
1c). Thus, Geobacteraceae such as G. metallireducens may be
better suited to metabolize acetate at the low concentrations naturally found in most soils and sediments.

CoA-transferases indicates that G. metallireducens has
evolved energy-efficient activation steps for some unidentified organic acid substrates that G. sulfurreducens cannot
utilize.
Numerous other enzymes of acyl-CoA metabolism are
predicted from the genome of G. metalllireducens but not
that of G. sulfurreducens (Additional file 2: Table S2),
including six gene clusters, three of which have been
linked to degradation of aromatic compounds that G. metallireducens can utilize [6,21-23] but G. sulfurreducens cannot [24]. All seven acyl-CoA synthetases of G.
sulfurreducens have orthologs in G. metallireducens, but the
latter also possesses acetyl-CoA synthetase, benzoate CoAligase (experimentally validated [23]), and seven other
acyl-CoA synthetases of unknown substrate specificity.
The G. metallireducens genome also includes eleven acylCoA dehydrogenases, three of which are specific for benzylsuccinyl-CoA (69% identical to the Thauera aromatica
enzyme [25]), glutaryl-CoA (experimentally validated
[26]) and isovaleryl-CoA (69% identical to the Solanum
tuberosum mitochondrial enzyme [27]), whereas none can
be identified in G. sulfurreducens. G. metallireducens also
has nine pairs of electron transfer flavoprotein genes
(seven of which are adjacent to genes encoding iron-sulfur
cluster-binding proteins) that are hypothesized to connect
acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the respiratory chain,
whereas G. sulfurreducens has only one. None of the seventeen enoyl-CoA hydratases of G. metallireducens is an
ortholog of GSU1377, the sole enoyl-CoA hydratase of G.
sulfurreducens. G. metallireducens also possesses eleven
acyl-CoA thioesterases, of which G. sulfurreducens has
orthologs of five plus the unique thioesterase GSU0196.
Of the ten acyl-CoA thiolases of G. metallireducens, only
Gmet_0144 has an ortholog (GSU3313) in G. sulfurreducens. BLAST searches and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that several of these enzymes of acyl-CoA
metabolism have close relatives in G. bemidjiensis, Geobacter FRC-32, Geobacter lovleyi and Geobacter uraniireducens, indicating that their absence from G. sulfurreducens is
due to gene loss, and that this apparent metabolic versatility is largely the result of expansion of enzyme families
within the genus Geobacter (data not shown). The ability
of G. metallireducens and other Geobacteraceae to utilize
carbon sources that G. sulfurreducens cannot utilize may be
due to stepwise breakdown of multicarbon organic acids
to simpler compounds by these enzymes.
Growth of G. metallireducens on butyrate may be attributed to reversible phosphorylation by either of two
butyrate kinases (Gmet_2106 and Gmet_2128), followed
by reversible CoA-ligation by phosphotransbutyrylase
(Gmet_2098), a pathway not present in G. sulfurreducens,
which cannot grow on butyrate [24]. These gene products
are 42â50% identical to the enzymes characterized in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/109

Clostridium beijerinckii and Clostridium acetobutylicum
[28,29].
An enzyme very similar to succinyl:acetate CoA-transferase is encoded by Gmet_1125 within the same operon
as methylisocitrate lyase (Gmet_1122), 2-methylcitrate
dehydratase (Gmet_1123), and a citrate synthase-related
protein hypothesized to be 2-methylcitrate synthase
(Gmet_1124) [30] (Figure 2a), all of which are absent in
G. sulfurreducens. This arrangement of genes, along with
the ability of G. metallireducens to utilize propionate as an
electron donor [31] whereas G. sulfurreducens cannot [24],
suggests that the Gmet_1125 protein could be a succinyl:propionate CoA-transferase that, together with the
other three products of the operon, would convert propionate (via propionyl-CoA) and oxaloacetate to pyruvate
and succinate (Figure 2b). Upon oxidation of succinate to
oxaloacetate through the TCA cycle and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the pathway would
be equivalent to the breakdown of propionate into six
electrons, one molecule of carbon dioxide, and acetate,
followed by the succinyl:acetate CoA-transferase reaction
(Figure 2b). In a phylogenetic tree, the hypothetical succinyl:propionate CoA-transferase Gmet_1125 and gene
Geob_0513 of Geobacter FRC-32, which is also capable of
growth with propionate as the sole electron donor and
carbon source (M. Aklujkar, unpublished), form a branch
adjacent to succinyl:acetate CoA-transferases of the genus
Geobacter (data not shown). In a similar manner, the
hypothetical 2-methylcitrate synthase Gmet_1124 and
gene Geob_0514 of Geobacter FRC-32 form a branch adjacent to citrate synthases of Geobacter species (data not
shown), consistent with the notion that these two enzyme
families could have recently evolved new members capable of converting propionate via propionyl-CoA to 2methylcitrate.
Gmet_0149 (GSU3448) is a homolog of acetate kinase
that does not contribute sufficient acetate kinase activity
to sustain growth of G. sulfurreducens [17] and has a closer
BLAST hit to propionate kinase of E. coli (40% identical
sequence) than to acetate kinase of E. coli. Although it
does not cluster phylogenetically with either of the E. coli
enzymes, its divergence from acetate kinase (Gmet_1034
= GSU2707) is older than the last common ancestor of the
Geobacteraceae (data not shown). This conserved gene
product remains to be characterized as a propionate
kinase or something else.
The proposed pathway for growth of G. metallireducens on
propionate (Figure 2) is contingent upon its experimentally established ability to grow on pyruvate [31]. G. sulfurreducens cannot utilize pyruvate as the carbon source
unless hydrogen is provided as an electron donor [17].

furreducens may be prevented by a strict requirement for
the succinyl:acetate CoA-transferase reaction (thermodynamically inhibited when acetyl-CoA exceeds acetate) to
complete the TCA cycle in the absence of detectable activity of succinyl-CoA synthetase (GSU1058-GSU1059)
[17]. With three sets of succinyl-CoA synthetase genes
(Gmet_0729-Gmet_0730, Gmet_2068-Gmet_2069, and
Gmet_2260-Gmet_2261), G. metallireducens may produce
enough activity to complete the TCA cycle.
G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens may interconvert
malate and pyruvate through a malate oxidoreductase
fused to a phosphotransacetylase-like putative regulatory
domain (maeB; Gmet_1637 = GSU1700), which is 51%

identical to the NADP+-dependent malic enzyme of E. coli
[32]. G. sulfurreducens has an additional malate oxidoreductase without this fusion (mleA; GSU2308) that is 53%
identical to an NAD+-dependent malic enzyme of B. subtilis [33], but G. metallireducens does not.
G. metallireducens possesses orthologous genes for all
three pathways that activate pyruvate or oxaloacetate to
phosphoenolpyruvate in G. sulfurreducens (Figure 3a):
phosphoenolpyruvate

identical) that has no homolog in G. sulfurreducens. In the
catabolic direction, in addition to pyruvate kinase
(Gmet_0122 = GSU3331) that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate plus ATP, G. metallireducens has a
homolog of E. coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
(Gmet_0304, 30% identical, also found in Geobacter FRC32) that may convert phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate irreversibly (Figure 3b) and contribute to the

bly in association with a co-transcribed b-type cytochrome
[35]. G. metallireducens has homologous genes
(Gmet_2397-Gmet_2395 = GSU1176-GSU1178), but is
unable to grow with fumarate as the terminal electron
acceptor unless transformed with a plasmid that expresses
the dicarboxylic acid exchange transporter gene dcuB of G.
sulfurreducens [35], which has homologues in Geobacter
FRC-32, G. bemidjiensis, G. lovleyi, and G. uraniireducens.
Surprisingly, G. metallireducens has acquired another putative succinate dehydrogenase or fumarate reductase complex (Gmet_0308-Gmet_0310), not found in other
Geobacteraceae, by lateral gene transfer from a relative of
the Chlorobiaceae (phylogenetic trees not shown), and
evolved it into a gene cluster that includes enzymes of central metabolism acquired from other sources (Figure 4).
Thus, G. metallireducens may have actually enhanced its
ability to respire fumarate before recently losing the requisite transporter.
Nitrate respiration and loss of the modE regulon from G.
metallireducens
G. metallireducens is able to respire nitrate [4], whereas G.
sulfurreducens cannot [24]. The nitrate reductase activity of
G. metallireducens is attributed to the narGYJI genes (Figure
5a; Gmet_0329-Gmet_0332), which are adjacent to the
narK-1 and narK-2 genes encoding a proton/nitrate symporter and a nitrate/nitrite antiporter (Gmet_0333 and
Gmet_0334, respectively) predicted according to homology with the two halves of narK in Paracoccus pantotrophus
[36]. A second narGYI cluster (Figure 5b; Gmet_1020 to
Gmet_1022) is missing a noncatalytic subunit (narJ), and
its expression has not been detected (B. Postier, personal
communication). The first gene of both operons encodes

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the moeA and moaA
gene families have repeatedly expanded in various Geobacteraceae (data not shown). G. sulfurreducens has a single
copy of each, but G. metallireducens has three closely
related isoenzymes, of which moeA-1 (Gmet_1038 =
GSU2703, 40% identical to the E. coli protein [39]) and
moaA-1 (Gmet_0301 = GSU3146, 36% identical to the E.
coli protein [40]) occupy a conserved location among
other genes of molybdopterin biosynthesis (Table 1, Figure 6). A possible reason for the expansion in G. metallireducens and other Geobacteraceae is a need to upregulate
molybdopterin biosynthesis for specific processes: moeA-2
and moaA-2 (Gmet_0336-Gmet_0337, 38% and 33%
identity to the E. coli proteins) may support nitrate reduction; moaA-3 (Gmet_2095, 35% identity to E. coli) may
function with nearby gene clusters for catabolism of benzoate [23] and p-cresol [22]; and moeA-3 (Gmet_1804,

a unique diheme c-type cytochrome (Gmet_0328 and
Gmet_1019), suggesting that the nitrate reductase may be
connected to other electron transfer components besides
the menaquinol pool, perhaps operating in reverse as a
nitrite oxidase. The product of the ppcF gene (Gmet_0335)
in the intact nar operon, which is related to a periplasmic
triheme c-type cytochrome involved in Fe(III) reduction
in G. sulfurreducens [37], may permit electron transfer to
the nitrate reductase from extracellular electron donors
such as humic substances [38] or graphite electrodes [11].
The final two genes of the intact nar operon (Gmet_0336Gmet_0337), encode the MoeA and MoaA enzymes
implicated in biosynthesis of bis-(molybdopterin guanine
dinucleotide)-molybdenum, an essential cofactor of the
nitrate reductase.

37% identity to E. coli) may aid growth on benzoate, during which it is upregulated [21]. G. metallireducens differs
from G. sulfurreducens in other aspects of molybdenum
assimilation as well (Table 1): notably, G. sulfurreducens
possesses a homolog of the moaE gene (GSU2699) encoding the large subunit of molybdopterin synthase, but lacks
homologs of the small subunit gene moaD and the molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase gene moeB, whereas G. metallireducens lacks a moaE homolog but possesses
homologs of moaD
(Gmet_1043) and moeB
(Gmet_1042). Comparison with the genomes of other
Geobacteraceae suggests that these differences are due to
loss of ancestral genes. How the nitrate reductase of G.
metallireducens can function with the molybdopterin synthase complex being apparently incomplete is unknown.
In G. sulfurreducens, putative binding sites for the molybdate-sensing ModE protein (GSU2964) have been identified by the ScanACE software [41,42] in several locations,
and the existence of a ModE regulon has been predicted
[43]. The genes in the predicted ModE regulon (Additional file 3: Table S3) include one of the two succinyl:acetate CoA-transferases, a glycine-specific tRNA (anticodon
CCC, corresponding to 26% of glycine codons), several
transport systems, and some nucleases. In G. metallireducens, there is no full-length modE gene, but a gene encoding the C-terminal molybdopterin-binding (MopI)
domain of ModE (Gmet_0511) is present in the same
location (Figure 6). Phylogenetic analysis shows that the
Gmet_0511 gene product is the closest known relative of
G. sulfurreducens ModE, and that it has evolved out of the
Geobacteraceae/Chlorobiaceae cluster of full-length ModE
proteins by loss of the N-terminal ModE-specific domain
(data not shown). The ScanACE software detected only
one of the ModE-binding sites of G. sulfurreducens at the
corresponding location in the G. metallireducens genome,

but some vestigial sites were apparent when other syntenous locations were visually inspected (Additional file 3:
Table S3), indicating that the ModE regulon once existed
in G. metallireducens, but recent loss of the ModE N-terminal domain is allowing the regulatory sites to disappear
gradually over the course of genome sequence evolution
due to the absence of selective pressure for these sites to
remain conserved. Thus, genes that may be controlled globally by ModE in G. sulfurreducens and other Geobacteraceae to optimize molybdenum cofactor-dependent
processes have recently acquired independence in G. metallireducens.
Amino acid biosynthesis and its regulation
The two genomes differ in several aspects of amino acid
biosynthesis and its regulation. To make aspartate from
oxaloacetate, a homolog of Bacillus circulans aspartate
aminotransferase [44] is present in G. metallireducens
(Gmet_2078; 65% identical), whereas a homolog of the
Sinorhizobium meliloti enzyme [45] is found in G. sulfurreducens (GSU1242; 52% identical). Both species possess
asparagine synthetase (Gmet_2172 = GSU1953 and
Gmet_2024, 30% and 24% identical to asnB of B. subtilis
[46]) and glutamine synthetase (Gmet_1352 = GSU1835,
61% identical to glnA of Fremyella diplosiphon [47]), as well
as an aspartyl/glutamyl-tRNA(Asn/Gln) amidotransferase
operon (Gmet_0076, Gmet_0075, Gmet_0073 =
GSU3383, GSU3381, GSU3380, 36â53% identical to the
homologous subunits in B. subtilis [48]) that includes
glutamine
synthetase
adenylyltransferase
(glnE;
Gmet_0071 = GSU3378). The G. sulfurreducens glnE gene
may be inactive due to a deletion of ~ 45 codons in the Cterminal domain.

For biosynthesis of lysine, threonine and methionine, G.
metallireducens and other Geobacteraceae possess a linked

G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens possess different genes for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis
G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens possess different genes for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. (a) G. sulfurreducens has the global regulator modE. (b) G. metallireducens has multiple copies of moeA, moaA, and mosC, and putative integration host factor binding sites (black stripes). Both genomes have conserved genes (dark grey) for molybdate transport
(modABC) and molybdopterin biosynthesis (moeA, moaCB, mobA-mobB, mosC) alongside tup genes for tungstate transport
(white), but neither genome has all the genes thought to be essential for bis-(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)-molybdenum
biosynthesis (light grey). See also Table 1.

pair of aspartate-4-semialdehyde dehydrogenase genes:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa-type Gmet_0603 (69% identity)
[49] and Mycobacterium bovis-type Gmet_0604 (47% identity) [50], but G. sulfurreducens has only the former
(GSU2878). A haloacid dehalogenase family protein
(Gmet_1630 = GSU1694) encoded between two genes of
the threonine biosynthesis pathway could be the enzyme
required to complete the pathway, a phosphoserine:homoserine phosphotransferase analogous to that of
P. aeruginosa [51], and may overlap functionally with the
unidentified phosphoserine phosphatase required to
complete the biosynthetic pathway of serine.
Conserved nucleotide sequences (possible promoters and
riboswitches) were identified on the 5' sides of several

biosynthetic operons (Table 2). The lysine biosynthesis
operon in G. sulfurreducens and other Geobacteraceae
begins with a P. aeruginosa-type meso-diaminopimelate
decarboxylase (GSU0158; 51% identity) [52], whereas G.
metallireducens has two isoenzymes in other locations
(Gmet_0219, 30% identical to the E. coli enzyme [53],
with homologs in a few Geobacteraceae; Gmet_2019, 31%
identical to the P. aeruginosa enzyme [52], unique to G.
metallireducens). The recently identified L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (dapL; Gmet_0213 =
GSU0162) [54] is co-transcribed with the dapAB genes
encoding the two preceding enzymes of lysine biosynthesis, but separated from them by a predicted short RNA element (Gmet_R1005 = GSU0160.1), also found in 23

other locations on the G. metallireducens chromosome
(Additional file 4: Figure S1, Additional file 5: Table S4).
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-responsive riboswitches
(Table 2) may regulate homoserine O-acetyltransferase
(Gmet_2783 = GSU2462, 45% identical to the Leptospira
meyeri enzyme [55]), the first dedicated enzyme of
methionine biosynthesis, and also two linked cystathionine-Î³-synthase/cystathionine-Î²-lyase genes (Gmet_0698
= GSU0944; Gmet_0699 = GSU0945, 49% and 51% identical to the Lactococcus lactis lyase [56,57]). Phylogenetic
analysis could not distinguish the synthase from the lyase
(data not shown), but their presence suggests that homocysteine can be made by transsulfuration of homoserine
with cysteine, and not only by the putative O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases (Gmet_0819 = GSU2425,
Gmet_2390 = GSU1183 and Gmet_1566, 47%, 56% and
38% identical to the Emericella nidulans enzyme [58],
respectively). In G. metallireducens, transsulfuration may
also be controlled by a GC-rich element between
Gmet_0698 and Gmet_0699, which contains four tandem repeats of the heptanucleotide GGGACCG and is
found in 49 intergenic and intragenic locations in the
genome (Additional file 6: Figure S2, Additional file 5:
Table S4).
The leucine pathway-specific leuA gene (2-isopropylmalate synthase; Gmet_1265 = GSU1906, 49% identical
to the E. coli enzyme [59]) may be controlled by feedback

inhibition through a T-box [60] predicted to form an antiterminator structure in response to uncharged leucinespecific tRNA having the GAG anticodon (Gmet_R0037 =
GSUR030) (Table 2), putatively the only tRNA capable of
recognizing 55% of leucine codons in G. metallireducens
and 48% in G. sulfurreducens (CTC and CTT).
There are three 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7phosphate (DAHP) synthase isoenzymes to catalyze the
first step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis: one similar
to aroF of E. coli (Gmet_2375 = GSU2291, 55% identity
[61], but with a P148T substitution incompatible with
feedback inhibition by tyrosine [62]) and two Thermotoga
maritima-type enzymes (Gmet_0024 = GSU3333;
Gmet_0346 = GSU3142, 51% and 46% identity [63],
respectively). As one chorismate mutase is fused to prephenate dehydratase (pheA; Gmet_0862 = GSU2608, 41%
identical to the Pseudomonas stutzeri fusion protein [64]),
the other (Gmet_1955 = GSU1828, 30% identical to the
chorismate mutase domain of the P. stutzeri fusion protein) may function predominantly in tyrosine biosynthesis, possibly regulated by the adjacent gene product
(Gmet_1956 = GSU1829) that resembles the phenylalanine/tyrosine-responsive domain of T. maritima DAHP
synthase [65]. Gmet_1956 orthologs phylogenetically
cluster with the regulatory domains of Gmet_0024
orthologs (data not shown), suggesting that Gmet_0024
may be a tyrosine-inhibited DAHP synthase and
Gmet_0346 may be inhibited by another end product

such as phenylalanine. A predicted short RNA element
(Gmet_R0069 = GSUR082, Table 2), found 5' of
Gmet_0346 and its orthologs in several Geobacteraceae,
may participate in regulation of this isoenzyme's expression.
In all non-Geobacteraceae that possess an indole-scavenging tryptophan synthase Î²2 protein, it is encoded apart
from the trp operon containing the trpAB1 genes for the Î±
(indole-producing) and Î²1 (indole-consuming) subunits
of tryptophan synthase [66]. In G. metallireducens and G.
sulfurreducens, however, the Î²2 gene trpB2 (Gmet_2493 =
GSU2379, 60% identical to the T. maritima protein [67])
is the penultimate gene of the predicted trp operon and
the trpB1 (Gmet_2482 = GSU2375, 66% identical to the
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus protein [68]) and trpA

(Gmet_2477 = GSU2371, 47% identical to the Azospirillum brasilense protein [69]) genes are separated from the 3'
end of the operon and from each other by three or more
intervening genes, most of which are not conserved
between the two genomes (not shown). Next to the trpB2
gene of G. metallireducens is one of 24 pairs of a conserved
nucleotide motif (Additional file 7: Figure S3, Additional
file 5: Table S4) hypothesized to bind an unidentified global regulator protein. Other, evolutionarily related paired
sites where another unidentified global regulator may
bind (Additional file 8: Figure S4, Additional file 5: Table
S4) are found in 21 locations. Between the proBA genes of
G. metallireducens, encoding the first two enzymes of proline biosynthesis (Gmet_3198-Gmet_3199 = GSU3212GSU3211, 41% and 45% identical to the E. coli enzymes
[70]), is one of eight pairs of predicted binding sites for yet

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:109

another unidentified global regulator (Additional file 9:
Figure S5, Additional file 5: Table S4). In G. sulfurreducens,
the space between proBA is occupied by a different conserved nucleotide sequence (not shown), found only in
four other places in the same genome. Overall, a comparison of the two genomes offers insight into unique features of amino acid biosynthesis and its regulation that
deserve further study.
Nucleotide metabolism
Differences in nucleotide metabolism were identified in
the two genomes. G. metallireducens has acquired a possibly redundant large subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (Gmet_0661, 50% identical to the P. aeruginosa
protein [71]) in addition to the ancestral gene
(Gmet_1774 = GSU1276, 65% identity to P. aeruginosa),
Both genomes encode a second putative thymidylate
kinase (Gmet_3250 = GSU3301) distantly related to all
others, in addition to the one found in other Geobacteraceae (Gmet_2318 = GSU2229, 41% identical to the E. coli
enzyme [72]). G. sulfurreducens has evidently lost the purT
gene product of G. metallireducens and several other Geobacteraceae (Gmet_3193, 58% identical to the E. coli
enzyme [73]), which incorporates formate directly into
purine nucleotides instead of using the folate-dependent
purN gene product (Gmet_1845 = GSU1759, 46% identical to the E. coli enzyme [74]).
Carbohydrate metabolism
Comparative genomics indicates that, similar to most
Geobacter species, G. metallireducens possesses two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
isoenzymes:
Gmet_1211 and Gmet_1946 (59% and 56% identical to
gluconeogenic GapB and glycolytic GapA of Corynebacterium glutamicum [75], respectively), but G. sulfurreducens
has an ortholog of only the latter (GSU1629). G. metallireducens also has a putative fructose 6-kinase (Gmet_2805,
39% identical to the E. coli enzyme [76]) that is not
present in G. sulfurreducens. Remarkably, G. metallireducens possesses two isoenzymes each of UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (Gmet_1486; Gmet_2329 = GSU2240, 50% and
54% identical to the A. brasilense enzyme [77]),
glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate
aminotransferase
(Gmet_1487; Gmet_0104 = GSU0270, 55% and 53%
identical to the Thermus thermophilus enzyme [78]), GDPmannose 4,6-dehydratase (Gmet_1488 = GSU0626;
Gmet_1311, 61% and 72% identical to the E. coli enzyme
[79]) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase
(Gmet_1489 = GSU2243, 61% identical to the E. coli
enzyme [80]; Gmet_1504, 39% identical to the Methanococcus maripaludis enzyme [81]). G. metallireducens has
evolved a gene cluster of the four enzyme activities
(Gmet_1486-Gmet_1489) from both ancestral gene
duplication and lateral gene transfer (data not shown).
The reason for this emphasis on interconversion of hex-

oses in G. metallireducens versus G. sulfurreducens is
unknown.
Unlike the genomes of G. sulfurreducens and most other
Geobacteraceae, which encode the enzymes of only the
non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway,
the G. metallireducens genome includes a cluster of oxidative pentose phosphate pathway enzyme genes: 6-phosphogluconolactonase (Gmet_2618, 30% identical to the
Pseudomonas putida enzyme [82]), glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (Gmet_2619, 50% identical to the Nostoc
punctiforme enzyme [83]), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gmet_2620, 36% identical to YqeC of B. subtilis [84]), along with two ribose-5-phosphate isomerase
isoenzymes (Gmet_2621 and Gmet_1604 = GSU1606,
39% and 44% identical to RpiB of E. coli [85]). Thus, G.
metallireducens apparently generates biosynthetic reducing
equivalents in the form of NADPH from carbohydrates.
The NADPH supply of G. sulfurreducens, in contrast, may
derive from the electron transfer chain via a ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (GSU3058-GSU3057, each 52%
identical to its Pyrococcus furiosus homolog [86]) that is
found in other Geobacteraceae, but not in G. metallireducens.
Both G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens may protect
themselves from desiccation by making trehalose from
glucose storage polymers via maltooligose in three steps
catalyzed by an alpha-amylase domain protein
(Gmet_3469 = GSU2361), maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (Gmet_3468 = GSU2360, 35% identical to the
Rhizobium leguminosarum enzyme [87]), and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (Gmet_3467 = GSU2358,
44% identical to the Arthrobacter strain Q36 enzyme [88]).
G. sulfurreducens, P. propionicus and G. lovleyi may also
make trehalose from glucose-6-phosphate by the sequential action of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (GSU2337,
containing a domain 37% identical to the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis enzyme [89]) and trehalose-6-phosphatase
(GSU2336, 29% identical to the E. coli enzyme [90]),
which are missing in G. metallireducens. Thus, G. sulfurreducens is capable of achieving osmotolerance without consuming carbohydrate storage polymers, but G.
metallireducens is not.
Biogenesis of c-type cytochromes and pili
The genome of G. metallireducens encodes 91 putative ctype cytochromes, of which 65 have homologs among the
103 c-type cytochromes of G. sulfurreducens. Of the c-type
cytochrome genes implicated in Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction in G. sulfurreducens, those conserved in G. metallireducens are macA (Gmet_3091 = GSU0466) [91-93] and ppcA
(Gmet_2902 = GSU0612) [37], whereas different c-type
cytochrome sequences are found in syntenous locations
where one would expect omcB and omcC (Gmet_0910 â

GSU2737; Gmet_0913 â  GSU2731) [94], and omcE
(Gmet_2896 â  GSU0618) [95]. The G. metallireducens
genome contains no genes homologous to omcS
(GSU2504) and omcT (GSU2503) [95], and only a paralog (Gmet_0155 = GSU2743) of omcF (GSU2432) [96].
This lack of conservation is being investigated further (J.
Butler, personal communication).
Notable differences between G. metallireducens and G. sulfurreducens are apparent in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes, in biosynthesis of the heme group, and in
reduction of disulfide bonds to allow covalent linkage to
heme. In addition to the membrane-peripheral protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase of G. sulfurreducens and other Geobacteraceae, encoded by the hemY gene (Gmet_3551 =
GSU0012, 38% identical to the Myxococcus xanthus
enzyme [97]), G. metallireducens has a membrane-integral
isoenzyme encoded by hemG (Gmet_2953, 43% identical
to the E. coli enzyme [98]), with a homolog in Geobacter
FRC-32. These two species also possess a putative
disulfide bond reduction system not found in G. sulfurreducens and other Geobacteraceae, comprised of DsbA,
DsbB, DsbE and DsbD homologs (Gmet_1380,
Gmet_1381, Gmet_1383, Gmet_1384), encoded in a
cluster alongside a two-component signalling system
(Gmet_1378-Gmet_1379),
an
arylsulfotransferase
(Gmet_1382), and a conserved protein of unknown function (Gmet_1385). Transcription of dsbA and dsbB is
diminished during growth on benzoate [21], and phylogenetic analysis indicates that these DsbA and DsbB proteins belong to subfamilies distinct from those that have
been characterized (R. Dutton, personal communication).
Located apart from this cluster, DsbC/DsbG (Gmet_2250)
of G. metallireducens has homologs in several Geobacteraceae, but not in G. sulfurreducens. However, CcdA/DsbD
(Gmet_2451 = GSU1322) is present in both. Thus, the
pathways of c-type cytochrome biogenesis may be significantly different in the two species and somehow linked to
the degradation of aromatic compounds by G. metallireducens.
In both G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens, there are
four c-type cytochrome biogenesis genes related to ResB of
B. subtilis [99], each predicted to be co-transcribed with a
gene encoding a ResC/HemX-like protein (hypothesized
to be a heme transporter with eight predicted transmembrane segments) [100] and several multiheme c-type cytochrome genes (Additional file 10: Table S5). One more
protein of the ResC/HemX-like family (Gmet_3232 =
GSU3283) is encoded among enzymes of heme biosynthesis in both genomes. These gene arrangements suggest
that each pair of c-type cytochrome biogenesis proteins
may be dedicated to the efficient expression of the cytochromes encoded nearby. Two of the pairs are orthologously conserved (Gmet_2901-Gmet_2900 = GSU0613-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/109

GSU0614; Gmet_0592..Gmet_0594 = GSU2891GSU2890); the other two pairs (Gmet_0572-Gmet_0573;
Gmet_0578-Gmet_0579;
GSU0704-GSU0705;
GSU2881.1-GSU2880), which appear to derive from
expansion of ancestral genes, may be relevant to the diversified c-type cytochrome repertoire of the two species.
Interestingly, three of these gene pairs in G. metallireducens
are arranged in proximity to each other in a cluster of ten
operons with the same coding DNA strand (Gmet_0571
to Gmet_0601), suggesting that their expression may be
co-ordinated by transcriptional readthrough (Additional
file 10: Table S5). The purposes of various pairs of c-type
cytochrome biogenesis proteins in Geobacteraceae remain
to be determined.
The pili of G. sulfurreducens have been implicated in electron transfer [101,102] and biofilm formation [103].
Most genes attributed to pilus biogenesis in G. sulfurreducens have orthologs in G. metallireducens, suggesting that
these roles of pili may be conserved. However, instead of
the ancestral pilY1 gene found in G. sulfurreducens
(GSU2038) and other Geobacteraceae, which may encode
a pilus tip-associated adhesive protein [104], G. metallireducens possesses a phylogenetically distinct pilY1 gene in
the same location (Gmet_0967; data not shown), surrounded by different genes of unknown function within a
cluster of pilus biogenesis genes. Therefore, it remains
possible that structural and functional differences
between the pili of the two species will be identified in
future.
Solute transport systems
Although the substrates of most solute transport systems
of G. metallireducens and G. sulfurreducens are unknown,
several features distinguish the two species (Additional
file 11: Table S6). One of two predicted GTP-dependent
Fe(II) transporters of the Geobacteraceae (feoB-1
Gmet_2444 = GSU1380), located next to the ferric uptake
regulator gene (fur Gmet_2445 = GSU1379), is present in
G. metallireducens; the other (feoB-2 GSU3268), with two
feoA genes on its 5' side (GSU3268.1, GSU3270) potentially encoding an essential cytosolic component of the
transport system [105], is not. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that the FeoB-2 proteins of Geobacteraceae are
closely related to the characterized Fe(II)-specific FeoB
proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis [106] and Campylobacter jejuni [107], whereas the FeoB-1 proteins of Geobacteraceae cluster apart from them (data not shown).
FeoB-1 proteins are not closely related to the manganesespecific FeoB of P. gingivalis [106] either, and so their substrate specificity cannot be assigned at present.

In G. metallireducens, duplicate kup genes, predicted to
encode low-affinity potassium/proton symporters, are
found in one place (Gmet_0038 = GSU3342; Gmet_0039

Page 13 of 22

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:109

= GSU2485, 29% and 31% identical to the E. coli protein
[108]), apart from the kdpABCDE genes (Gmet_2433Gmet_2437 = GSU2480-GSU2484, 38â49% identical to
the homologs in E. coli [109,110]) encoding an osmosensitive potassium-translocating ATPase complex. In G. sulfurreducens, one of these kup genes (GSU2485) is located
3' of the kdp gene cluster, apparently under control of an
osmosensitive riboswitch (GSU2484.1, sequence coordinates 2728254 to 2728393), and there is a third kup gene
(GSU2350, 49% identity to E. coli) not found in other
Geobacteraceae. G. sulfurreducens also has at least two
potassium/proton antiporters (GSU1203, 34% identical
to CvrA of Vibrio parahaemolyticus [111]; GSU2759, 31%
identical to KefB of E. coli [112]) and a sodium/proton
antiporter complex (mrpABCDEFG GSU2344-GSU2338,
29â48% identical to the homologs in B. subtilis [113])
that are not found in G. metallireducens. Three mechanosensitive ion channels are common to the two species
(Gmet_1942 = GSU1633; Gmet_2581 = GSU2316; and
Gmet_2522 = GSU2794); two more are unique to G. sulfurreducens (GSU1557; GSU1723). Thus, control of
monovalent cation homeostasis appears to be more complex in G. sulfurreducens.
Several heavy metal efflux pumps are conserved between
the two species, but their substrate specificity is uncertain.
Transporters present in G. sulfurreducens but not G. metallireducens include that for uracil (GSU0932, 48% identical
to the Bacillus caldolyticus protein [114]). Transporters
present in G. metallireducens but not G. sulfurreducens
include
those
for
nitrate/nitrite
(Gmet_0333Gmet_0334) and chromate (Gmet_2732-Gmet_2731),
which are each present as two paralogous genes rather
than gene fusions such as their homologs that have been
characterized in other bacteria [36,115].
Signalling, chemotaxis and global regulation
G. metallireducens possesses orthologs of the six sigma factors of RNA polymerase identified in G. sulfurreducens
(Table 3), as well as a seventh factor (Gmet_2792) not
found in other Geobacteraceae, related to the extracytoplasmic sigma-Z factor of B. subtilis [116]. Intriguingly, a particular anti-anti-sigma factor gene is frameshifted in both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/109

genomes: GSU1427 has frameshifts in the phosphatase
domain, resulting in an in-frame protein, whereas the
homologous Gmet_1229 is shifted out of frame in the
kinase domain. These differences imply that global regulatory networks may be different in the two species.
The G. metallireducens genome encodes 83 putative sensor
histidine kinases containing HATPase_c domains (Additional file 12: Table S7), of which 45 (54%) have
orthologs among the 95 such proteins of G. sulfurreducens.
There are 94 proteins with response receiver (REC)
domains in G. metallireducens (Additional file 12: Table
S7), out of which 66 (70%) have orthologs among the
110 such proteins of G. sulfurreducens. Twenty-seven of the
REC domain-containing proteins and another 101 genes
and four pseudogenes (Additional file 12: Table S7) were
predicted to be transcriptional regulators in G. metallireducens. There are 20 putative diguanylate cyclases containing
GGDEF domains, of which 16 (80%) have orthologs
among the 29 putative diguanylate cyclases of G. sulfurreducens (Additional file 13: Table S8). Overall, the portion
of the genome dedicated to signalling and transcriptional
regulation in G. metallireducens is slightly less than in G.
sulfurreducens, but still considerable and significantly different in content.
Several protein factors involved in chemotaxis-type signalling pathways are conserved between the two
genomes: G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens each
possess four or five CheA sensor kinases and ten CheY
response receivers, almost all of which are orthologous
pairs (Additional file 14: Table S9). In contrast, 17 of the
34 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) of G.
sulfurreducens have no full-length matches in G. metallireducens (Additional file 14: Table S9). Due to apparent
gene family expansion in G. sulfurreducens, its remaining
17 MCPs correspond to only 13 MCPs of G. metallireducens (Additional file 14: Table S9). The other five MCPs of
G. metallireducens lack full-length matches in other Geobacteraceae (Additional file 14: Table S9). Whereas G. sulfurreducens may use its closely related MCPs to fine-tune
its chemotactic responses, G. metallireducens may accomplish response modulation by having twice as many MCP

methyltransferases (CheR) and methylesterases (CheB) as
G. sulfurreducens (Additional file 14: Table S9).
Integration host factors (IHF) and histone-like (HU)
DNA-binding proteins are global regulators of gene
expression composed of two homologous proteins that
bend DNA in specific locations [117]. IHF/HU binding
sites are favoured by some mobile genetic elements for
insertion. The genome of G. metallireducens encodes
orthologs of the single HU protein, both IHF beta proteins, and one of two IHF alpha proteins of G. sulfurreducens (Table 4). Another HU gene and two additional IHF
alpha genes are present in G. metallireducens but not G. sulfurreducens (Table 4). Three sets of putative global regulatory elements unique to the G. metallireducens genome
(Additional files 7,8,9: Figures S3, S4 and S5, Additional
file 5: Table S4) may be recognized by different combinations of IHF/HU proteins. A fourth set found in G. metallireducens (Additional file 15: Figure S6, Additional file 5:
Table S4) is similar to multicopy sequences in many other
genomes. Two transposons (ISGme8 and ISGme9) were
found inserted near putative IHF/HU-binding sites of
Class 1 (Additional file 5: Table S4). No such putative global regulatory sequence elements were identified in G. sulfurreducens. However, pirin, a Fe(II)-binding protein that
associates with DNA in eukaryotic nuclei [118,119], is
present in G. sulfurreducens as GSU0825, but in G. metallireducens only as a frameshifted fragment, Gmet_3471.
These genetic differences indicate that the proteins that
decorate and bend the chromosome are very different in
the two species.
Although no quorum sensing through N-acylhomoserine
lactones (autoinducers) has ever been demonstrated for
any Geobacteraceae, this kind of signalling may be possible
for G. metallireducens because it possesses a LuxR family
transcriptional regulator with an autoinducer-binding
domain (Gmet_1513), and two divergently transcribed
genes with weak sequence similarity to autoinducer synthetases (Gmet_2037 and Gmet_2038). Both Gmet_2037
and Gmet_2038 have atypically low G+C content (Additional file 1: Table S1) and may have been recently
acquired by G. metallireducens. The presence of a conserved nucleotide sequence on the 5' side of Gmet_2037
and in 15 other locations on the chromosome (Additional
file 16: Figure S7, Additional file 5: Table S4) suggests that
Gmet_2037 may be an unusual autoinducer synthetase
that is regulated by a riboswitch rather than an autoinducer-binding protein. This conserved sequence is also
found on the 5' side of many genes (frequently c-type
cytochromes) in the genomes of G. sulfurreducens, G. uraniireducens, and P. propionicus, and overlaps with predicted
cyclic diguanylate-responsive riboswitches [120].
The genomes of G. metallireducens and G. sulfurreducens
differ in several other aspects of regulation. Nine pairs of

potential toxins and antitoxins were identified in the G.
metallireducens genome (Additional file 17: Table S10),
which may poison vital cellular processes in response to
stimuli that interfere with their autoregulation. Only one
of these was similar to one of the five potential toxin/antitoxin pairs of G. sulfurreducens. Both the CRISPR1 and
CRISPR2 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) loci of G. sulfurreducens, thought to encode
181 short RNAs that may provide immunity against infection by unidentified phage and plasmids [121,122], have
no parallel in G. metallireducens, which has CRISPR3 (also
found in G. uraniireducens) instead, encoding only twelve
putative short RNAs of more variable length and
unknown target specificity (Additional file 18: Table S11).
Another difference in RNA-level regulation is that a singlestranded RNA-specific nuclease of the barnase family
(Gmet_2616) and its putative cognate inhibitor of the
barstar family (Gmet_2617) are present in G. metallireducens but not G. sulfurreducens.
Several conserved nucleotide sequences were identified by
comparison of intergenic regions between the G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens genomes, and those that are
found in multiple copies (Additional file 19: Figure S8,
Additional file 5: Table S4) may give rise to short RNAs
with various regulatory or catalytic activities.

Conclusion
Inspection of the G. metallireducens genome indicates that
this species has many metabolic capabilities not present
in G. sulfurreducens, particularly with respect to the metabolism of organic acids. Many biosynthetic pathways and
regulatory features are conserved, but several putative global regulator-binding sites are unique to G. metallireducens. The complement of signalling proteins is
significantly different between the two genomes. Thus,
the genome of G. metallireducens provides valuable infor-

mation about conserved and variable aspects of metabolism, physiology and genetics of the Geobacteraceae.

Methods
Sequence analysis and annotation
The genome of G. metallireducens GS-15 [31] was
sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute from cosmid
and fosmid libraries. Two gene modeling programs â Critica (v1.05), and Glimmer (v2.13) â were run on both replicons [GenBank:NC007517, GenBank:NC007515],
using default settings that permit overlapping genes and
using ATG, GTG, and TTG as potential starts. The results
were combined, and a BLASTP search of the translations
vs. Genbank's non-redundant database (NR) was conducted. The alignment of the N-terminus of each gene
model vs. the best NR match was used to pick a preferred
gene model. If no BLAST match was returned, the longest
model was retained. Gene models that overlapped by
greater than 10% of their length were flagged for revision
or deletion, giving preference to genes with a BLAST
match. The revised gene/protein set was searched against
the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, PRIAM, Pfam, TIGRFam, Interpro, KEGG, and COGs databases, in addition to BLASTP
vs. NR. From these results, product assignments were
made. Initial criteria for automated functional assignment
set priority based on PRIAM, TIGRFam, Pfam, Interpro
profiles, pairwise BLAST vs. Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, KEGG,
and COG groups. tRNAs were annotated using tRNAscanSE (v1.23). rRNAs were annotated using a combination of
BLASTN and an rRNA-specific database. The srpRNA was
located using the SRPscan website. The rnpB and tmRNA
were located using the Rfam database and Infernal. Riboswitches and other noncoding RNAs predicted in the G. sulfurreducens genome [GenBank:NC00293] were retrieved
from the Rfam database [123] and used to annotate the
corresponding sequences in G. metallireducens.

Operon organization was predicted using the commercial
version of the FGENESB software (V. Solovyev and A.
Salamov, unpublished; Softberry, Inc; 2003â2007), with
sequence parameters estimated separately from the G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens genomes. Default
parameters were used in operon prediction, including
minimum ORF length of 100 bp.
Binding sites of the global regulator ModE (consensus
were predicted
using ScanACE software [41,42] using the algorithm of
Berg and von Hippel [124] and the footprinted matrix of
E. coli ModE-regulated sites from the Regulon DB database v 4.0 [125]. Functional annotations of transport proteins were evaluated by referring to TCDB http://
www.tcdb.org, and PORES http://garlic.mefos.hr/pores
was used to annotate porins. Transposase families were
assigned ISGme numbers for inclusion in the ISFinder
database http://www-is.biotoul.fr.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/109

Manual curation
The automated genome annotation of G. metallireducens
was queried with the protein BLAST algorithm [126] using
all predicted proteins in the automated annotation of the
G. sulfurreducens genome [12] to identify conserved genes
that aligned over their full lengths. The coordinates of
numerous genes in both genomes were adjusted according to the criteria of full-length alignment, plausible ribosome-binding sites, and minimal overlap between genes
on opposite DNA strands. The annotations of all other
genes in G. metallireducens were checked by BLAST
searches of NR. Discrepancies in functional annotation of
conserved genes between the two genomes were also
resolved by BLAST of NR and of the Swiss-Prot database.
All hypothetical proteins were checked for similarity to
previously identified domains, conservation among other
Geobacteraceae, and absence from species other than Geobacteraceae. Genes that had no protein-level homologs in
NR were checked (together with flanking intergenic
sequences) by translated nucleotide BLAST in all six reading frames, and by nucleotide BLAST to ensure that conserved protein-coding or nucleotide features had not been
missed. All intergenic regions of 120 bp or larger were also
checked, which led to the annotation of numerous conserved nucleotide sequences numbered as follows:
Gmet_R#### (for predicted RNAs and miscellaneous conserved sequences, a nonzero first digit indicating membership in a group of four or more sequences); Gmet_P####
(for conserved, putative regulatory sequences 5' of predicted operons, numbers corresponding to the first gene
of the operon); Gmet_I[1-4]## [A, B] (for the four classes
of putative global regulator binding sites, mostly found in
pairs); Gmet_H4## (for putative global regulatory elements consisting of four tandem heptanucleotide
repeats); and Gmet_C### (for the spacers of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats â CRISPR).
Newly added features in the G. sulfurreducens genome
were assigned unique numbers with decimal points
(GSU####.#) in accordance with earlier corrections.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of selected proteins was performed
on alignments generated using T-COFFEE [127], manually corrected in Mesquite [128]. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed by the neighbour-joining method using
Phylip software [129], with 500 bootstrap replications.
