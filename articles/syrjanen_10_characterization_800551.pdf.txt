Abstract
Background: The b-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) enzymes have been reported in a variety of organisms, but
their existence in animals has been unclear. The purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence
analysis to show that the b-CAs are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this
enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., Drosophila melanogaster.
Results: The novel b-CA gene, here named DmBCA, was identified from FlyBase, and its orthologs were searched
and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of b-CA sequences in 55 metazoan species.
The corresponding recombinant enzyme was produced in Sf9 insect cells, purified, kinetically characterized, and its
inhibition was investigated with a series of simple, inorganic anions. Holoenzyme molecular mass was defined by
dynamic light scattering analysis and gel filtration, and the results suggested that the holoenzyme is a dimer.
Double immunostaining confirmed predictions based on sequence analysis and localized DmBCA protein to
mitochondria. The enzyme showed high CO2 hydratase activity, with a kcat of 9.5 × 105 s-1 and a kcat/KM of 1.1 ×
108 M-1s-1. DmBCA was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used sulfonamide acetazolamide, with an inhibition
constant of 49 nM. It was moderately inhibited by halides, pseudohalides, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate
(KI values of 0.67 - 1.36 mM) and more potently by sulfamide (KI of 0.15 mM). Bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite and
phenylarsonic/boronic acids were much weaker inhibitors (KIs of 26.9 - 43.7 mM).
Conclusions: The Drosophila b-CA represents a highly active mitochondrial enzyme that is a potential model
enzyme for anti-parasitic drug development.

Background
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) catalyze the
reversible hydration of carbon dioxide according to the
following reaction: CO2 + H2O ↔ HCO3- + H+ [1]. CAs
are zinc-containing metalloenzymes, except for the ζ
form, which uses cadmium [2,3] as alternative metal
cofactor. Additionally g-CAs contain iron in vivo, at
least in anaerobic Archaea [4,5]. The reaction catalyzed
by CAs is crucial in the regulation of acid-base balance

in organisms. In addition, CAs participate in many other
physiological processes such as bone resorption in vertebrates, gluconeogenesis, production of body fluids, and
transport of CO2 and HCO3- to name but a few [1].
To date, five different classes of CAs have been identified: a, b, g, δ and ζ [6]. A previously known ε-CA class
[7] has been reclassified as a new type of b-CA based on
its crystallographic structure [8], which shows a fold
nearly identical to those of the archaeal cab-type [9] and
plant-type [10] b-CAs. In ζ-CA, the geometry of the
active site is nearly identical to that of b-CAs, and there
is also some similarity in the fold, which has led to the

suggestion that even ζ-CAs might represent a distantly
diverged subtype of b-CAs [3].
The ζ-CAs are found only in diatoms, and the δ-CAs in
diatoms and other marine phytoplankton, whereas the
three major classes (a, b and g) are widely distributed. gCA orthologs are present in Archaea, Bacteria and plants
[6,11] but have been secondarily lost in animals and
fungi [12] (M. Tolvanen, unpublished observation). The
a class is missing from Archaea (M. Tolvanen, unpublished observation) but is nearly ubiquitously present in
Bacteria and Eukarya, with the exception of Fungi, in
which only filamentous ascomycetes have a-CAs [12]. In
plants and animals, a-CAs exist as numerous isoforms.
For example, 16 and 15 a-CAs have been described in
non-primate mammals and primates including humans,
respectively [1,13]. b-CAs appear to be the class with the
widest distribution as they have been described in multiple lineages throughout the tree of life, including most
species belonging to the Archaea and Bacteria domains
and probably all species of plants and fungi among
Eukarya ([14] and M. Tolvanen, unpublished data).
b-CAs have also been characterized in a number of
human pathogens such as fungi/yeasts (e.g., Candida
albicans, Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [15-20] and bacteria (Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Haemophilus influenzae, Brucella suis etc.) [21-25], and their
inhibition profiles by various agents such as sulfonamides, anions, carboxylates and boronic acids have been
explored [15-24,26-30]. Given that b-CA genes appear to
be missing in invertebrates, novel antimicrobial compounds based on the inhibition of b-CAs from pathogenic organisms may soon become available.
Although b-CAs catalyze the same reaction as a-CAs
and other CA forms, important structural differences
between these classes exist. First, instead of functioning
as obligate monomers like most a-forms or trimers like
g-forms, b-CAs are found in many oligomerization
states. Crystal structures of dimeric, tetrameric and
octameric b-CAs have been reported [9,10,31]. In the
active site of b-CAs, the zinc atom is coordinated by
one histidine and two cysteine residues instead of three
histidine residues present in a-, g- and δ-CAs [32].
Despite this difference, b-class CAs basically share the
same molecular mechanism for reversible hydration of
carbon dioxide as a-class CAs [9]. b-CAs possess a
highly conserved dyad comprising an aspartate and an
arginine residue that seem to be crucial for the catalytic
mechanism since mutation of these residues severely
reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme [33]. The
aspartate makes a hydrogen bond with the Zn(II) coordinated water molecule, activating it for nucleophilic
attack of the CO2 molecule [29].

b-CAs have been reported in many photosynthetic
organisms, including plants and algae [6]. In plants,
b-class CAs are strongly expressed in both roots and
green tissues and are located in chloroplasts, cytoplasm
and mitochondria with isozyme-specific patterns [13,34].
The cytoplasmic and chloroplastic CAs are suggested to
be crucial in CO 2 accumulation and carbon fixation.
The green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also contains b-class CAs that are localized to mitochondria
[35]. In fungi like Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida
albicans, b-CAs have an important role in CO2 sensing
and, consequently, in the pathogenesis of these species
[36]. In addition, many fungal b-CAs have been shown
to be mitochondrial [12]. These and many other similar
findings confirm that b-CAs are physiologically important enzymes with variable localization and function like
a-CAs in vertebrates.
The presence of b-CAs in the animal kingdom has
been controversial or ignored due to the paucity and
poor quality of the available sequences [6,14]. Here we
show, however, that b-CAs are widespread among invertebrates. The aim of this study was to express, purify
and characterize a b-CA enzyme from fruit fly (D. melanogaster), a commonly used model organism in biological sciences. The recombinant enzyme was produced in
Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Along with the characterization of the first
arthropod b-CA, this study also describes its inhibition
profile with inorganic anions. These results might open
new strategies for developing novel anti-parasitic drugs
against common diseases like schistosomiasis and
malaria.

Results
Sequence analysis

We found b-CAs in all complete non-chordate animal
genomes and in almost all invertebrates with at least
20,000 EST sequences in the NCBI database, plus in
some with fewer sequences. We confirmed the existence
of b-CA sequences in Placozoa, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Arthropoda, and Annelida, and even
in many classes of Deuterostomia, namely in Hemichordata, Echinodermata, and Xenoturbellida. The only
major taxon of Protostomia with poor evidence for b-CA
is Mollusca, in which we found only one EST to match
55 residues in other b-CAs. Of special interest were
numerous pathogenic helminth species with complete bCA sequences or substantial fragments, namely, filariacausing Brugia malayi, mouse whipworm Trichuris
muris, dog hookworm Ancylostoma caninum, and the
flukes Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma sinensis.
In the case of chordates, the existence of a functional
b-CA is currently unclear. The genomes and NCBI EST

Syrjänen et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/28

sequence collections (as of 1st Oct, 2009) of Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi (tunicates) lack b-CA,
whereas we found two recognizable but incomplete bCA sequences in the genome of the cephalochordate
Branchiostoma floridae (of one locus from both haplotypes in the genome). The encoded proteins seem to
lack more than 60 residues at the N-terminus, including
the active site. In addition, there are two even less complete partial EST transcripts, GenBank BW824885 and
BW803919. The latter contains an unrelated sequence
in place of the active-site-containing exon. We can only
conclude that it remains an open question whether bCA in B. floridae is a pseudogene or an incompletely
sequenced active gene.
Our survey discovered and assembled 38 seemingly
complete and correct b-CA sequences from the genome
and sequence databases of 33 metazoan species, including improved gene models for sequences already in
sequence databases. Fragmentary b-CA sequences were
found in additional 22 species. Multiple sequence alignment of all animal b-CAs shows perfect conservation of
the known active site motifs CxDxR and HxxC and several other key residues. Figure 1 shows an alignment of
the first 120 residues of selected b-CA sequences,
including the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide and active site regions (See Table 1 for identification of species). Of the active-site residues indicated
below the alignment, two cysteines and one histidine are
zinc-binding residues. Additional files 1 and 2 show the
full alignment of the same sequences and of all of the
identified sequences, respectively. The phylogenetic tree
of the selected animal b-CA sequences is shown in Figure 2 (See Table 1 for identification of species). The tree
indicates that the duplication of b-CA genes in nematodes is specific for the nematode lineage. Out of the
two copies, the one labeled BCA2 is more strongly

conserved, as shown by shorter branches in the tree of
Figure 2 and in trees we made with all available
sequences. The placement of the b-CA from acorn
worm (S. kowalevskii, a hemichordate) seems contrary
to conventional invertebrate taxonomy, but since some
of the bootstrap values are under 50%, the tree is not
perfectly resolved outside the insect and nematode
blocks.
No b-CA sequences exist in vertebrate genomes. A
false positive is found in the X. tropicalis genome, scaffold_1719, which we attribute to bacterial contamination, since the b-CA sequence and every other gene in
this scaffold are highly similar (>80% identical) with
known genes of Pseudomonas-related bacteria.
All of the complete sequences are classified as b-CA
domains of type “BCA_CladeB” in the NCBI Conserved
Domain Database. All plant b-CAs are also classified as
BCA_CladeB domains, so animal b-CAs can well be said
to be “plant-type b-CAs”. There are also hundreds of
bacterial b-CA sequences of type “BCA_CladeB”, and
some of them cluster closest to animal sequences, and
some closest to plant sequences in phylogenetic trees
(data not shown).
Expression of b-CA in Sf9 insect cells

Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the b-CA gene
(DmBCA) obtained from D. melanogaster cDNA. The
amount of protein obtained from 500 ml of culture
supernatant was approximately 1 mg. According to
SDS-PAGE, the relative molecular mass of DmBCA was
approximately 28 and 27 kDa before and after thrombin
treatment, respectively (Figure 3).
Subcellular localization of DmBCA

When the collection of 38 complete animal b-CA
sequences was analyzed for subcellular targeting with

TargetP, 22 sequences were predicted to be mitochondrial, with low reliability, and most of the remaining
sequences were predicted to be cytoplasmic, again with
low reliability. The results from WolF PSORT, Secretome 2.0 and MitoProt II v. 1.101 also supported the
hypothesis that it is a mitochondrial enzyme, with a possibility for non-classical secretion (without a signal peptide) suggested by Secretome 2.0. A mitochondrial
targeting signal sequence is also predicted in the N-terminus (prediction lengths varying from 14 in MitoProt
to 49 in TargetP). Based on these findings, a DmBCAGFP construct was designed to study the subcellular
localization of the protein in Sf9 cells.
According to our experiments on the DmBCA-GFP
fusion protein, DmBCA is indeed a mitochondrial protein, supporting the predictions made by bioinformatic
tools. Figure 4A shows the DmBCA-GFP recombinant
protein in Sf9 insect cells in which the positive signal
was located in intracellular granular structures. Figure
4B shows the same cells labeled with a mitochondrial
marker, MitoTracker Red CMXros™. Figure 4C presents
an overlay of the previous panels, demonstrating the
colocalization of DmBCA-GFP and MitoTracker Red
CMXros™.

Catalytic activity and inhibition of DmBCA

DmBCA purified from Sf9 cells was kinetically analyzed
in the presence or absence of acetazolamide or inorganic
anions. The kinetic parameters of DmBCA (k cat and
k cat /K m ) were then compared with those of the thoroughly investigated CAs such as the cytosolic and ubiquitous human isozymes a-CA I (HCA I) and II (HCA
II), as well as the recently described fungal b-CAs, C.
neoformans Can2, C. albicans Nce103, S. cerevisiae CA
(ScCA) and C. glabrata CA (CgCA). All of these fungal
enzymes are orthologous to Nce103, a protein found in
all fungi/yeasts studied to date (Table 2).
One can appreciate from the data shown in Table 2
that DmBCA, similar to the other recently investigated
a- and b-CAs, possesses considerable CO 2 hydratase
activity. A kcat of 9.5 × 105 s -1 and a kcat /K m of 1.1 ×
108 M-1s-1 make DmBCA one the most efficient b-CA
described to date. Data from Table 2 also show that
DmBCA was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used
sulfonamide acetazolamide (5-acetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide), with an inhibition constant of 49
nM. Table 3 shows the DmBCA inhibition screening
data with anionic physiological species (such as chloride,
bicarbonate, sulfate, etc.) as well as other non-

physiological anions. Note that similar to other investigated a- and b-CAs, DmBCA has an inhibition profile
with anions characteristic only for this enzyme. Several
species such as bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite, perchlorate,
phenylboronic acid and phenylarsonic acid behaved as
weak inhibitors (K I s in the range of 22.4 - 200 mM),
whereas other anions inhibited the enzyme more
potently (e.g., cyanide, cyanate, and sulfamide, with inhibition constants in the range of 150 - 730 μM).
Dynamic light scattering and gel filtration analysis

The hydrodynamic diameters of the proteins were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). At a temperature range from 4°C to 37°C the hydrodynamic diameter

of DmBCA was 6.3 ± 0.8 nm and the diameter was
found to slightly increase during the heating. According
to the hydrodynamic diameter the average molecular
weight of DmBCA was estimated to be 48.9 kDa, the
lowest estimate being 35.4 kDa, and the highest 64.9
kDa (n = 30). When temperature was raised above 43°C
the hydrodynamic diameter of DmBCA started to clearly
increase and DmBCA had a transition state at temperature range 46-49°C, where large protein aggregates
appeared. This might be associated with protein
denaturation.
At the temperature range from 4°C to 37°C the hydrodynamic diameter of HCA II was 3.9 ± 0.6 nm leading
to estimated average molecular weight of 16.1 kDa, the

lowest estimate being 10.8 kDa, and the highest 22.8
kDa (n = 12). When HCA II was heated from 4°C to 43°
C there was a slight increase in hydrodynamic diameter.
However, no transition states were observed.
The estimated molecular weights determined by DLS
are in agreement with the values obtained by analytical
gel filtration which gave a molecular weight estimate for
DmBCA of 38.1 ± 3.0 kDa and for HCA II of 23.4 ± 4.0
kDa. The molecular weight of HCA II monomer is 29
kDa. Therefore, gel filtration analysis appears to underestimate the molecular size of CAs. Overall, DLS and
gel filtration analyses suggest dimeric state for DmBCA
whereas HCA II appears predominantly monomeric in
solution.

Discussion
In the present study, we identified and characterized a
novel b-CA enzyme (DmBCA) from an arthropod, D.
melanogaster. Although b-CAs have been previously
reported in Archaea and Bacteria domains, in addition
to plants and fungi in Eukarya, our results suggest the
widespread occurrence of at least a single-copy b-CA
gene among animal species distinct from chordates. The
loss of b-CA gene in the chordate lineage may have
occurred either in the last common ancestor of all chordates or in the last common ancestor of tunicates and
craniates. Whether cephalochordates have a functional
b-CA gene remains an unresolved question.
Using bioinformatic tools, we discovered a single b-CA
gene in most invertebrates with reasonable sequence

coverage. The exception is nematodes, which seem to
have two b-CA genes in their genomes. A very recent article [37] reported the cloning and characterization of C.
elegans b-CAs and the authors found that one of the two
isoforms, BCA-1, has no activity and does not work in
complementation assay. This might, however, be due to
incorrect sequence: the sequence they show for C. elegans
BCA-1 contains the coding sequence of the preceding
MTP18 gene fused to the b-CA reading frame. This
sequence is a result of an incorrect gene prediction which
has no support at the mRNA level and which remained in
WormBase and UniProt until May 2008, subsequently
corrected from our initiative. The previously fused

UniProt entry Q8T3C8 now represents only MTP18, and
a new entry BCA1_CAEEL contains the more plausible
BCA-1 sequence. Since C. elegans BCA-1 has all of the
active-site residues and is also well conserved in other
nematodes, we think it is probable that both isozymes in
nematodes would be functional b-CAs.
Our larger phylogenetic analysis (M. Tolvanen, unpublished data) and NCBI domain classification of animal bCAs clearly show them to be “plant-type” b-CAs. The
“plant-type” group also includes hundreds of bacterial bCAs, and this group contains plant/bacterial and animal/
bacterial subgroups. The presence of such polyphyletic
subgroups may indicate horizontal gene transfer, and
further investigations are underway to study this
phenomenon.
Fasseas et al. [37] state that the 3D structure of their
C. elegans b-CA models would resemble archaeal “cabtype” b-CAs, but we cannot agree with their conclusion.
In our eyes, the models are nearly identical to the pea
BCA (panel a in their Figure 2), and in our hands SwissModel http://swissmodel.expasy.org/ in fact chooses the
pea b-CA structure as a template for both insect and
nematode b-CAs.
In the recent paper by Fasseas et al. [37], the enzyme
activity of C. elegans Y116A8C.28 was reported to be
typical for b-CAs, with a kcat and kcat/Km of 2.77 × 104
s-1 and 6,383 × 105M-1s-1, respectively. These values are
significantly lower than the k cat of 9.5 × 10 5 s -1 , and
k cat /K m of 1.1 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 that we report here for
DmBCA. The enzymatic activity of DmBCA is one of
the highest reported so far for a b-CA, suggesting an
important physiological role for this enzyme.
Our studies with different anionic CA inhibitors did
not reveal specific inhibitors of DmBCA, which is in fact

Inhibition constants against isozymes HCA II (a-CA class), and the b-CAs

normal for such simple inorganic ions [38]. The inhibition profile of DmBCA was unique for this enzyme,
however, and differed significantly from other b-CAs
studied previously.
Indeed, fluoride, chloride, cyanate, cyanide and sulfamide showed submillimolar inhibitory activity against
DmBCA, with inhibition constants in the range of 150
μM - 970 μM. Another groups of anions, including bromide, iodide, thiocyanate, azide, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate showed inhibition constants close to 1
mM (KIs in the range of 1.01 - 1.36 mM), thus making
them weak DmBCA inhibitors. Other anions such as
bicarbonate, nitrate and nitrite, as well as the non-anionic species phenylboronic acid and phenylarsonic acid,
were much less effective inhibitors, with inhibition constants of 22.4 - 43.7 mM. It is interesting to note that
bicarbonate, a CA substrate, is a weak DmBCA inhibitor, but it appreciably inhibits the fungal enzymes
Nce103 (C. Albicans), ScCA and CgCA, with KIs in the
submillimolar range (of 86 μM - 0.78 mM). Even though
the low apparent K I value for bicarbonate could be a
reflection of allosteric inactivation of the enzyme
([39,40]), the value is still in the same range with the
other anion inhibitors, suggesting that their mechanism

Syrjänen et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/28

of inhibition might be quite similar. The present inhibition data may suggest a different physiological role for
DmBCA in the insect compared to the corresponding bCAs in fungal or yeast species studied previously. One
should also note that DmBCA has a completely different
inhibition profile not only compared to other b-CAs but
also compared to the highly investigated a-CA of
human origin, HCA II (Table 3).
Animal b-CAs constitute a separate subgroup in the
b-CA family according to our bioinformatic analysis.
Because the main target, b-CA, is present in many parasites and disease carrying vectors but absent in humans,
this discovery clearly carries the significant potential for
the design of parasite-specific b-CA inhibitors. Such
drugs would presumably combine high specificity with a
low incidence of side-effects in humans. These drugs
could, for example, provide novel opportunities to
restrict malaria propagation and to treat patients suffering from helminth infections.
Predictions of subcellular localization placed most, but
not all, animal b-CAs in the mitochondria. Our hypothesis is that all of them will be mitochondrial based on
three main reasons. First, we have direct experimental
evidence of mitochondrial localization of DmBCA. Second, all of the TargetP predictions were either mitochondrial or cytoplasmic, both with low-reliability.
Third, the neural network used in TargetP is trained
with human and Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins;
thus, it is perhaps not perfectly adjusted to detect the
signals in invertebrate mitochondrial transit peptides.
Because of this mitochondrial localization of animal bCAs, we speculate that the b-CA gene in chordates
might have been silenced and ultimately lost after the
emergence of mitochondrial a-CAs (CA V) to substitute
for this function. The presence of an active CA in mitochondria has been linked to maintaining fundamental
metabolic functions such as gluconeogenesis, ureagenesis and lipogenesis [1,41]. Although our experiments
were not focused on the role of the DmBCA enzyme, its
mitochondrial localization and high enzymatic activity
suggest that knockdown studies in D. melanogaster are
warranted to further investigate the physiological function of b-CAs in animals.
The expression of DmBCA has been studied at mRNA
level in two publicly available DNA microarray datasets.
In FlyAtlas (http://flyatlas.org/atlas.cgi?name=CG11967RA, [42]) expression levels in 17 adult and 8 larval D.
melanogaster tissues are given. The highest upregulated
values in adult are found in spermatheca (female), fat
body, and heart. In larval tissues (third instar) downregulated or average expression levels are seen for all tissues. A time course study published in FlyBase (http://
flybase.org/reports/FBgn0037646.html, under Microarray
data, Personal communications to FlyBase, Gaurav et al.

Page 8 of 13

2008), shows upregulated expression of DmBCA in early
larval stages and late in metamorphosis, but downregulated levels in embryonal, late larval, early metamorphosis, and adult stages. The specific temporal and tissue
patterns of expression suggest relevant functional and/or
physiological roles for DmBCA.

Conclusions
In conclusion, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) b-CA
(DmBCA) is an active mitochondrial enzyme for the
physiological reaction catalyzed by CAs, the hydration of
CO2 to bicarbonate and protons. It is inhibited by various inorganic anions, boronic/arsonic acids or sulfonamides. Mammals do not possess b-class CAs, but these
enzymes are widespread throughout the phylogenetic
tree, making them exciting new targets for parasitic
drug development. Indeed, b-CAs are found in many
pathogenic organisms and pathogen vectors of the animal kingdom, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes, the filariasis
vector Culex, Ancylostoma hookworms, Brugia filarial
nematodes, the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni and
the liver fluke Schistosoma sinensis. Because animalderived b-CAs probably have a different predicted structure compared to the b-CAs investigated so far in detail
from Archaea, plants, algae and fungi, as well as the aCAs, specific inhibitors against these enzymes could be
designed with minimal effect on human CAs and normal bacterial flora.
Methods
Bioinformatic analysis

Taking advantage of the known pea b-CA (UniProt
P17067) as an initial query, and subsequently the found
invertebrate b-CAs (D. melanogaster, AAF54311; C. elegans CAJ43916), the animal CA sequences were
retrieved from NCBI protein databases using Blast [43]
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and from complete
genomes at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site
http://genome.ucsc.edu using BLAT search algorithms
[44]. Hits were taken through iterated cycles of multiple
sequence alignment (ClustalW; [45]), evaluation and
revision. For revision, sequences with poorly matching
or missing regions were subjected to gene model generation with GeneWise ([46]; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/Wise2/), taking the genomic sequences from the
UCSC site. EST and mRNA sequence data from NCBI
were used to confirm gene models, sometimes to bridge
gaps or fill ends in the genomic sequences, and to discover and assemble b-CAs from less than genome-wide
sequenced organisms.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the multiple
sequence alignments using MEGA 4 [47]. Preliminary
Neighbour-Joining trees [48] were constructed with all

Syrjänen et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/28

sequences, and a representative set of 26 sequences was
then selected for a final tree, eliminating excessive insect
and nematode sequences and severely incomplete
sequences. The final tree was inferred using the Minimum evolution method [49] from a multiple sequence
alignment containing columns corresponding to positions 31 to 255 (of 255) of DmBCA. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates [50] was taken
to represent the evolutionary history of the analyzed
sequences. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch
lengths proportional to the evolutionary distances used
to infer the phylogenetic tree and rooted using the Cnidarian sequences as outgroup. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction
method and are presented in the units of the number of
amino acid substitutions per site. The minimum evolution tree was searched using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm [51] at a search level of 3. The
Neighbor-Joining algorithm [48] was used to generate
the initial tree. All positions containing alignment gaps
and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise
sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option).
Predictions of subcellular localization were made using
TargetP v1.1 ([52]; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/), Secretome 2.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
SecretomeP/, WolF PSORT, http://wolfpsort.org/ and
MitoProt II v. 1.101 http://ihg2.helmholtz-muenchen.de/
ihg/mitoprot.html. Conserved domain types were identified at the NCBI Conserved Domains Database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml.
Construction of recombinant baculoviruses

Two constructs were engineered to study functional
aspects of D. melanogaster b-CA (DmBCA). The first
one contained a GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein)
sequence fused C-terminally to the DmBCA cDNA for
detection of the recombinant protein with confocal
microscopy. The second construct contained a C-terminal histidine tag for protein purification. Both constructs contained full length b-CA gene, including the
proposed N-terminal signal sequence. BglII and XhoI
restriction sites and a thrombin cleavage site (for tag
removal) were introduced into both constructs.
Total RNA extracted from D. melanogaster S2 cells
(TRIzol® reagent and protocol, Invitrogen) was precipitated using sodium acetate at a final concentration of
100 mM and 100% ethanol. The solution was centrifuged at 13,000×g for 15 min at +4°C. The RNA sample
was washed once with 70% ethanol and recentrifuged in
the same manner. The sample was evaporated at room
temperature and then suspended in sterile water. Precipitated RNA was transcribed into cDNA using a First
strand cDNA Synthesis Kit #K1612 (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The DmBCA gene was identified and amplified from
cDNA by PCR using Phusion™ Hot Start High Fidelity
DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).
Sequence-specific primers were ordered from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). The forward primer was 5'ATGGAGCGTATTTTGAGGGGAATC-3' (F1), and the
reverse primer was 3'-CTACGAATAGAATCTTCTGACCTC-5' (R1). PCR was performed in a PTC 2000
thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA), and the
program consisted of a single 98°C denaturation step for
30 s, followed by 33 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for
10 s, annealing at 53°C for 15 s and extension at 72°C
for 25 s. A final extension was performed at 72°C for 5
min. The PCR product band was separated from the gel
and dissolved using Illustra™ GFX PCR DNA and GEL
Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Buckinghamshire, UK).
To engineer the DmBCA-GFP construct, the
sequences of DmBCA and GFP were first amplified
separately using sequence specific primers. The templates used for DmBCA and GFP were DmBCA gene
product obtained from cDNA and pEGFP-N1™ Vector
(Clontech), respectively. The constructs were then combined using PCR reactions whose R2 and F3 primer
sequences partly overlapped (bolded in the primer
sequences, see below). This allowed the ends of the PCR
products to recognize each other. The forward primer
used for DmBCA amplification was 5'- GGCCAGATCTATGGAGCGTATTTTGAGGGGA-3' (F2), and the
reverse primer was 5'-CACGGAACCACGGGGCACCAGCGAATAGAATCTTCTGACCTC-3' (R2). The
bolded sequence was designed to recognize the thrombin site and part of the GFP PCR product, while the
other half recognized the DmBCA PCR product.
The forward primer used for GFP amplification was
5'-TCGCTGGTGCCCCGTGGTTCCGTGAGCAAG
GGCGAGGAGCTG-3' (F3), and the reverse primer was
5'-CCGCTCGAGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3'
(R3). The bolded sequence in the F3 primer was
designed to recognize the thrombin site and part of the
DmBCA PCR product, while the other half recognized
the GFP PCR product. The PCR program was as follows: 98°C for 2 min; then 33 cycles of 98°C for 10 s,
55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and finally 72°C for 7
min.
Both PCR products were run on agarose gel, purified
and used as templates in the next PCR reaction. The
PCR program was as follows: 98°C for 2 min; then 33
cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 55°C for 15 s and 72°C for 40 s;
and finally 72°C for 8 min. The forward primer used in
this PCR was (F2), and the reverse primer was (R3). The
extra sequence overlaps at the 3' end of DmBCA and at
the 5' end of the GFP allowed these PCR products to
anneal to each other.

Syrjänen et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/28

The PCR product was run on an agarose gel, and
the obtained band was purified. pFastBac™ 1 plasmid
(Invitrogen) and the PCR product were digested at
+37°C overnight with BamHI and XhoI restriction
enzymes (New England Biolabs). The digested plasmid
and DmBCA-GFP construct were purified and then
ligated overnight at +4°C using T4 DNA ligase (New
England Biolabs). The ligated product was transformed
into TOP10 bacteria (Invitrogen). Overnight cultures
(8 ml) were made from these colonies, and plasmids
were purified using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit™
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing was performed to verify the validity of the DmBCA-GFP construct. The construction of baculoviral genomes
encoding the recombinant proteins has been described
previously [53].
For recombinant protein production, the DmBCA
gene construct with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag of six
histidines was constructed and cloned into the pFastBac1™ vector. The forward primer used in the initial
amplification of the DmBCA gene was (F2), and the
reverse primer was 5'- GCCCTCGAGTTAATGGTGGTGATGGTGGTGGGAACCACGGGGCACCAGCGAATAGAATCTTCTGACCTC -3' (R4). The latter
primer contains nucleotide repeats to create the polyhistidine tag (bolded in the primer sequence). The PCR
program was as follows: 98°C for 60 s; then 35 cycles of
98°C for 10 s, 66°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 60 s; and
finally 72°C for 5 min. Otherwise, the construct was
made essentially in the same way as the DmBCA-GFP
construct described above.
Study of the subcellular localization of DmBCA

A total of 100 μl of Sf9 insect cells (2 million cells/ml)
were infected with 10 μl of baculovirus stock. The cells
were kept at +27°C in incubator for three days in LabTek™ Chamber Slide™ System™ plates (Nunc). The
medium was then removed, and the cells were incubated in 600 μl of medium containing 100 nM Mitotracker Red CMXros™ (Invitrogen) for 20 minutes at
+27°C. The cells were washed three times with 600 μl
of medium and kept at +27°C in an incubator for two
hours. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for five minutes and washed
again with PBS. The cells were mounted in VectaShield® Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories), covered with cover slips and analyzed using a confocal
scanning laser microscope (Perkin Elmer-Cetus/Wallac
UltraView LCI system™) with two different wavelengths: 488 nm for GFP detection and 579 nm for
MitoTracker™. Image acquisition was performed with
an Andor iXon™ DV885 EMCCD camera and the
Andor iQ™ software (Andor).

Production and Purification of Recombinant Insect b-CA

The Sf9 insect cells were grown in HyQ SFX-Insect
serum-free cell culture medium (HyClone, Logan, UT)
in an orbital shaker at 27°C (125 rpm) for three days
after infection. Although much of the DmBCA was associated with the cell pellet, protein purification was performed after centrifugation (5000 × g, 20°C, 8 min)
from the supernatant and yielded highly pure DmBCA
protein for characterization. Purification was performed
using the Probond™ Purification System (Invitrogen)
under native binding conditions, with wash and elution
buffers made according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purification procedure per 500 ml of insect
cell medium was as follows: 1 liter of native binding
buffer and 25 ml of the nickel-chelating resin were
added to the medium, and the His-tagged protein was
then allowed to bind to the resin on a magnetic stirrer
at 25°C for 3 h. The resin was washed with 100 + 30 ml
of washing buffer (Invitrogen). The protein was then
eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM
NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0).
The purified DmBCA recombinant protein was transferred to a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using an
Amicon Ultracel™ - 10 k centrifugal filter device (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To
remove the His tag, the recombinant protein was treated
with 60 μl of resin-coupled thrombin (Thrombin CleanCleave KIT™, Sigma) per 1 mg of protein with gentle
shaking at 25°C for 1 h, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Protein concentration was determined
using the DC Protein Assay™ (Bio-Rad) with three different dilutions. Purified recombinant DmBCA proteins
were analyzed using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions. The gels were stained using the
Colloidal Blue Staining Kit™ (Invitrogen).
CA activity measurements

An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument was
used to assay the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration activity.
Phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mM) was used as an
indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557
nm, with 10 - 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) or Tris(pH 8.3) as
buffers and 20 mM Na2SO4 or 20 mM NaClO4 (for maintaining constant ionic strength), following the initial rates
of the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration reaction for a period
of 10 - 100 s. The CO2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to
17 mM for the determination of kinetic parameters and
inhibition constants. For each inhibitor at least six traces
of the initial 5-10% of the reaction were used to determine
the initial velocity. The uncatalyzed rates were determined
in the same manner and subtracted from the total
observed rates. Stock solutions of inhibitor (100 mM)

Syrjänen et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/11/28

were prepared in distilled-deionized water, and dilutions
up to 0.01 μM were made thereafter with distilleddeionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at room temperature prior
to the assay to allow for the formation of the E-I complex.
The inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear
least-squares methods using PRISM 3, whereas the kinetic
parameters for the uninhibited enzymes were obtained
from Lineweaver-Burk plots, each representing the mean
of at least three different determinations.
Kinetic measurements have been performed also with
m-cresol purple (as indicator) - bicine (as buffer) (data not
shown), and the results were the same (±5-10% of the
reported values, which is the error range of this method)
both for the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydration and for
the inhibition constants of anionic inhibitors investigated
here. Thus, the standard method reported in this paper is
reliable for the investigation of b-CAs (in addition to the
a-CAs) as reported by this group for several enzymes,
such as the three b-class enzymes from Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori and Brucella suis, and the
fungal class enzymes (for example [25]).
Dynamic light scattering analysis

The hydrodynamic diameters of the proteins were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using Zetasizer
ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, United
Kingdom). A 100 μl sample of DmBCA (200 μg/ml) in
elution buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO4 , 500 mM NaCl, 250
mM imidazole, pH 8.0) was analyzed. Human CA II
(HCA II) (180 μg/ml) in 0.1 M Tris, 0.4 M NaN3, 1 mM
benzamidine, 20% glycerol, pH 7.0 was analyzed to support the results of DmBCA analysis. The small molecules such as imidazole and glycerol of the elution
buffers seemed to dominate in the DLS analysis, since
most of the light scattering was from particles having
diameter smaller than one nm. Therefore, proteins were
exchanged to 50 mM Na2HPO4 pH 7.0 containing 100
mM NaCl using protein desalting spin columns (Pierce).
DLS analysis was then performed for 100 μl sample by
using temperature scanning mode where the temperature was raised from 4°C to 50°C at 3°C intervals. Sample was let to equilibrate to each measurement
temperature two minutes before data acquisition. For
DmBCA three parallel measurements were carried out
at each temperature and for HCA II only one measurement was performed at each temperature. The molecular weight of the protein was estimated from
hydrodynamic diameter using globular protein standard
curve provided by the manufacturer.
Analytical gel filtration

The molecular size of the protein in solution was
measured by size-exclusion chromatography using

Page 11 of 13

Superdex200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) connected to ÄKTA ™purifier-100 equipped with UV-900
monitor (GE Healthcare). The analysis was done using
50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 650 mM NaCl (pH 7.0) as mobile
phase. 20-30 μg protein was injected per run. All the
analyses were done with flow rate 0.3 ml/min, and
absorbencies at 280 nm and 205 nm were used to locate
the protein peaks in the chromatograms. Molecular
weight calibration curve was prepared by analyzing
gel filtration standard protein mixture containing thyroglobulin (670kDa), g-globulin (158kDa), ovalbumin
(44kDa), myoglobin (17kDa) and vitamin B12 (1,35kDa)
(Bio-Rad).
