Abstract
Background: The frequent occurrence of ferret badger-associated human rabies cases in southeast China
highlights the lack of laboratory-based surveillance and urges revisiting the potential importance of this animal in
rabies transmission. To determine if the ferret badgers actually contribute to human and dog rabies cases, and the
possible origin of the ferret badger-associated rabies in the region, an active rabies survey was conducted to
determine the frequency of rabies infection and seroprevalence in dogs and ferret badgers.
Methods: A retrospective survey on rabies epidemics was performed in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in
southeast China. The brain tissues from ferret badgers and dogs were assayed by fluorescent antibody test. Rabies
virus was isolated and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. The sera from ferret badgers and dogs were titrated
using rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA) test.
Results: The ferret badgers presented a higher percentage of rabies seroconversion than dogs did in the endemic
region, reaching a maximum of 95% in the collected samples. Nine ferret badger-associated rabies viruses were
isolated, sequenced, and were phylogenetically clustered as a separate group. Nucleotide sequence revealed
99.4-99.8% homology within the ferret badger isolates, and 83-89% homology to the dog isolates in the
nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes in the same rabies endemic regions.
Conclusions: Our data suggest ferret badger-associated rabies has likely formed as an independent enzootic
originating from dogs during the long-term rabies infestation in southeast China. The eventual role of FB rabies in
public health remains unclear. However, management of ferret badger bites, rabies awareness and control in the
related regions should be an immediate need.

Background
Rabies is caused by neurotropic viruses in the genus
Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, and is transmissible to
all mammals [1]. Dogs are the main hosts responsible
for human rabies in Africa, Latin Americas and Asia,
especially in China [2,3], where rabies is re-emerging as
a major public health threat, and its severity is only second to HIV and tuberculosis (TB) among all reportable
infectious diseases. From the annual ~3000 human
deaths, southeast China counts for most cases, with

more than 90% attributed to rabid dog bites [3]. Notably, both human population and dog density are high in
the region with low rabies vaccination coverage in dogs.
Given that the program of dog rabies elimination has
not been listed in the priority of governmental agenda,
it is possible that long term dog rabies enzootics will
lead to spillover events of dog-associated rabies into
wildlife species. In addition to rabies transmitted by
rabid dogs, other sources of rabies exposure to humans,
such as cats, ferret badgers (FB), and pigs, have been
continuously reported in China [4-8]. Interestingly, in
provinces like Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, the percentage of dog-associated human rabies is relatively low.
Meanwhile, up to 80% of the reported human rabies

cases were inferred to be caused by FB bites in some
districts in Zhejiang province from 1994 to 2004 [9].
Although rabies in badgers was previously recorded in
other countries [10,11], FB-associated human rabies has
never been reported except in China [12,13]. The frequent occurrence of FB-associated human rabies cases
in southeast China highlights the lack of laboratorybased surveillance and urges revisiting the potential
importance of this animal in rabies transmission. Nevertheless, management of such animal bites in humans
needs a clear guideline on post-exposure prophylaxis
(PEP) for rabies. Currently, FB trading and its meat consumption are common in the related areas, resulting in
a frequent source of FB bite to humans. Similar to
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks
through consumption of civet in south china, the close
and frequent contact of FB by humans could be an
important factor in human rabies cases in southeast
China.
To determine if the FB actually contributes to human
and dog rabies cases, and the possible origin of the FBassociated rabies in the region, we conducted an
expanded retrospective/prospective epidemiological survey, which encompassed both descriptive and molecular
epidemiological approaches.

Animal experiments related to this study were
approved by the Committee of Animal Welfare and
Ethics of Veterinary Research Institute, Academy of
Military Medical Sciences. Humane endpoints were used
throughout this study in accordance with the ethical
principles for in vivo studies. All animals including ferret badgers, dogs and mice that showed clinical signs of
infection were killed humanely. This study did not refer
to any issue of human ethics as only the epidemiological
data were collected and analyzed, and no sample was
collected from any healthy and contracted humans.
The FAT on brain specimens was performed according to methods described elsewhere [14]. Briefly, the
brain tissue impressions were made on slides. After air
drying, the slides were fixed with 80% acetone for 20
min. The FITC-conjugated anti-rabies virus nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies (made in Laboratory of Epidemiology, Veterinary Institute, Changchun, for routine
rabies diagnosis) was added and incubated for 40 min at
37ºC. After three-times’ wash using PBS buffer (0.01 M,
pH 7.4) -Tween-20 (0.1%), the slides were left to dry in
the air at ambient temperature, and observed under a
UV fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Corporation,
Germany) for typical rabies virus staining.

Methods
Epidemiological survey on FB-associated human rabies
cases

A retrospective survey on rabies epidemics was carried
out in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in southeast China. The data were collected and summarized
from the provincial CDC surveillance system and epidemiological records. Some information was obtained
verbally after interviewing animal traders or hunters in
the endemic areas. In human rabies cases and its potential association with FB transmission, we conducted a
preliminary investigation of FB population density, exposure frequency of sick FB to humans, and management
of rabies PEP after a FB bite.
FB and dog brain specimens and Fluorescent Antibody
Test (FAT)

Dead or live FB collected in fields and houses, and dogs
that had bitten people were sent by selected farmers to
the designated laboratories for diagnoses. The surveyed
mountainous areas were Huzhou, Hangzhou, Jinhua,
Quzhou, Lishui in Zhejiang province; Nanchang, Jingdezhen, Shangrao, Wuyuan in Jiangxi province; and
Huangshan, Xuancheng, Anqing, Jingxian in Anhui province. The animal heads were packed appropriately and
shipped to our laboratory under cold conditions. The
brains were removed by opening the skull under sterile
conditions.

For FAT positive specimens, the suspension of the sample was injected intracerebrally to 1-day-old suckling
mice (Kunming mice, Animal Core Laboratory, Changchun Institute of Biological Products) according to protocols described elsewhere [15]. The mice were
observed for ~28 days. The brain smear was made to
re-check for the presence of rabies virus antigen using
the FAT if the inoculated mice died from day 6 to 28.
Sequences of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes
and phylogenetic analysis

Total RNA of the infected FB brains were extracted
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The
nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes were
amplified by RT-PCR following the protocol described
by Nadin-Davis et al [16] using the total RNA with the
following primers. The positions of the primers were
referred against strain FJ009 (GenBank Acc. No.
FJ866836.1).

The TaKaRa (TaKaRa Corp Ltd, Dalian, China) was
the contracted company responsible for sequencing the
amplicons. We generated a phylogenetic tree using the
Neighbor-joining (NJ) method in MEGA 4 (MegAlign,
DNASTAR Software Suite, Version 7.1.0, Copyright
1989-2006, DNASTAR Inc.). The Bootstrap values were
calculated from 1,000 repeats using 70% as the cut-off.
Rabies virus (RV) neutralizing antibodies in dog and FB
serum samples

Serum samples were collected from the captured FBs
and dogs in our expanded surveyed areas. All the FBs
were alive and appeared healthy when the serum was
collected. Dog sera were from watchdogs belonging to
residents of different villages in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and
Anhui provinces. The method of titration of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA) by Fluorescent Antibody
Virus Neutralization (FAVN) test was described elsewhere [17]. Briefly, 3-fold serial dilutions of standard
serum (0.5 International Units, IU/ml) and test serum
samples were prepared in microplates in quadruplicate.
Fifty _μl of challenge rabies virus (CVS-11) containing
100 TCID50 was also added to each well. After 60 min
incubation at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator,
50 μl cell suspension containing 2 × 104 cells was added
to each well and the plates were incubated for 48 h at
37°C. After fixation at room temperature for 30 min in
80% acetone, the cell monolayers were stained by addition of FITC-conjugated anti-rabies nucleoprotein
monoclonal antibodies (Laboratory of Epidemiology,
Veterinary Institute, Changchun, China) to each well.
Staining was carried out in an incubator at 37°C for 30
min and fluorescence was observed by UV microscope
(Zeiss, Germany). Wells exhibiting no specific fluorescence were considered antibody positive. Neutralizing
antibody titers were calculated using the SpearmanKärber formula and expressed in IU/ml by comparison
with a reference serum (13.5 IU/ml, product of AFSSA,
France), 0.1 IU/ml is considered as the cut-off of seroconversion after rabies virus infection in both ferret badgers and dogs.

nocturnal behavior, but rabid FBs become excited, run
into residential areas, and will bite. In the case of hunters or occasional hunters, exposure to FB happened
almost every day. The FB bites in humans were usually
on the hands, feet, or occasionally on the arms, legs,
and very rarely upon the upper body.
The population density of FBs is unknown. Empirically,
hunters lay their traps according to the number of FB
tracks. On average, 2-5 tracks could be found within 80
Chinese acres (1 Chinese acre = 660 m2). The number of
FB is about 38-95 per km2. However, this rough estimation needs ecological support. In our investigation, there
was at least one hunter in almost every village. Seasonally, more than 1 FB was caught by a hunter per day.
Despite frequent contact with rabies- susceptible animals,
no hunters are aware of the potential danger of rabies
exposure. No PEP occurred after FB bites. Furthermore,
the hunters and farmers live in remote rural areas and
mountainous regions, and their income (1000 RMB or
less per month) cannot afford the high cost of PEP
(1300-2000 RMB) in China. Therefore, the recommendation of PEP is not only ignored, but also intentionally
neglected due to the associated costs.
FAT and MIT

In total, we collected 209 dead FB from our surveyed
regions, and 76 of 209 were partially decomposed when
the brains were removed for diagnosis. Eight of 209
brain samples were confirmed rabies positive using FAT
(3.8%), and RV was successfully isolated by MIT from
the samples. The rabies incubation period in 1-day-old
suckling mice was 7-12 days.
From the 56 brain samples we collected from live FBs
in Jiangxi, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, only 1 sample
was rabies positive by FAT (1.8%, 1/56). Since captured
and injured by the hunter, this positive animal did not
present obvious clinical signs of rabies before euthanized
for diagnosis. From the 15 dog brain samples collected
in the same regions, 2 were rabies positive by FAT
(13%, 2/15). All RVs from FAT positive samples were
successfully isolated by MIT.

Results

Rabies VNA in FB and dog serum samples

Epidemiological survey on FB-associated human rabies
cases and preliminary ecological investigation on FB
population

Fifty six serum samples were collected from live FBs in
the selected 3 provinces. The average rabies seroconversion rate was 69.6%, ranging from 0 (no neutralizing
antibody in all individuals) to 95% in different collections, and rabies VNA ranged from 0 to 2.6 IU/ml
(Table 2). In the 77 dog serum samples, the detectable
VNA was 18.2% (14/77), and the overall percentage of
VNA positive was relatively lower from dogs than the
samples from FBs (Table 3). Since no rabies vaccination
campaign has been performed in the FBs and dogs

Human rabies cases potentially associated with FB transmission were inferred retrospectively and prospectively
on the basis of exposure records (Table 1). The patients
included FB-hunters who capture and sell FBs, farmers
with occasional exposure to sick FBs, and residents who
were exposed to sick FBs in their yard or house. Healthy
FBs do not actively attack humans because of their

could be vaccinated occasionally due to the disease
awareness by the owners, the higher seroconversion in
the FBs is an interesting phenomenon.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

We compared RV N sequences from rabid FB isolates
with those in dogs from China, foxes from Europe/Middle East, dogs in Africa, and rabies vaccine strains from
Asia, Europe and the US (Figure 1). Dog RVs in China
were categorized into two groups. Group 1 compromises
RVs all across south and southeast China, and group 2
is formed by Chinese isolates distributed in Guizhou,
Jiangsu, Henan, Jilin provinces, and is closely related to
Asian and occidental vaccine strains, and cosmopolitan
dog RVs (Figure 1). In general, Chinese dog-associated
lineages shared nucleotide identity from 87 to 98% (Figure 1). Same phylogenetic pattern was reconstructed
using the G gene sequences (data not shown).
The FB RVs were segregated in an independent lineage (Figures 1). The nucleotide identity of FB isolates
with current south and southeast Chinese dog-related
lineages (from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hunan,
Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Yunnan, Henan) ranged from

*A rabies virus was isolated from the brain tissue of this ferret badger.

87 to 89% (94.5-98.8% homology by amino acid
sequence comparison). However, the intra-group identity in the 9 FB isolates only varied from 98.7 to 99.1%
(99.0-100% homology by amino acid sequences). A notable difference was detected on the G protein motif at
residual position 331-333 with Serine-Valine-Arginine
(S-V-R) in FB isolates. This motif has not been found in
any isolates from dogs in China and the corresponding
motif in dog isolates was Serine-Isoleucine-Arginine (SI-R), which does not exist in the FB isolates (using PV
as the reference sequence, GenBank Acc. No. M13215).

Discussion
The current reporting system of human rabies in China
covers two aspects. One is the statistical distribution status
of human rabies cases, which can be reviewed on governmental websites by authorized personnel only. The other
is the documented epidemiological data of each case available at local provincial CDCs. The establishment of this
system occurred after the lessons learned from the SARS
outbreaks. Although annual epidemiological data represented about 3,000 human rabies deaths during the last
five consecutive years, rabies is still not considered as a
priority in the China public health system.
Although FB-associated human rabies cases have been
reported in China [6,18,19], the actual number of
human cases remain unknown. In Africa, about 0.33%
rabies seroconversion was recorded in badger populations [10]. Rabies in such animals was detected in Africa
[10] and Europe [11], but was simulated in Great Britain
[20]. However, FB-associated human rabies has never
been reported except in southeast China. In our surveyed counties, where 69-80% of human rabies cases
were inferred to be caused by this animal species, such
epidemiological data lack laboratory-based diagnosis,
and may confuse the actual role of FB in the transmission of rabies to domestic dogs and humans. Therefore,
in this study, we conducted an active laboratory-based

rabies survey to determine the frequency of rabies virus
infection and seroprevalence in both dogs and FBs. The
percentage of RV infection was 3.8% (8/209) in dead
FBs, 1.8% (1/56) in live FBs and up to 13% (2/15) in
domestic dogs that had bitten people. Conversely,
apparently healthy FBs were found with a high percentage of rabies seroconversion (69.6%), whereas dogs
were only 18.2%. However, no rabies vaccination program has been performed in wildlife in China. The high
percentage of rabies seroconversion in FBs is an interesting discovery, and could be due to abortive rabies
infections in the population. Domestic dogs still are the
most affected species, and are the most likely source for
rabies transmission to humans and other animals in the
endemic region. Our data also suggest that FBs may not
be as susceptible to rabies as other carnivores.
In the 77 dog serum samples, the detectable VNA was
18.2% (14/77), and the overall percentage of VNA positive was relatively lower than the samples from FBs.
However, some of the VNA positive dogs had high
levels of antibodies with two reached 9.27 and 11.3 IU/
ml, respectively. We think the randomly collected serum
samples include those from vaccinated dogs due to
rabies awareness by the owners.
The consistent amino acid signatures along with the
phylogenetic findings in this report suggest that the FB
RV variant may be maintained as an independent
enzootic by local FB populations. Nonetheless, the origin
of FB RV has its root in south/southeast China dog RV
variants. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates a broad cocirculation of at least two major dog-related groups
throughout south/southeast China. Group 1 is relatively
distant to the FB lineage, and seems to act as a new
emergence. Group 2 is closely related to the FB lineage,
and connects to historical dog RVs circulating in the
late 1950s in China. As human populations in southeastern China are condensed and widely distributed in hills
and mountainous area, their contact with rabid FBs
could become a greater potential source of exposure to
RV. In some rabies endemic regions, illegal FB trade for
meat consumption increased the risks among hunters,
farmers, traders, slaughterers, and chefs. The awareness

of rabies should be a priority in the southeast populations at risk. Clearly PEP should be initiated after FB
bite, provided that timely post-mortem rabies diagnosis
of the biting animal is not feasible.
For eventual rabies control, China should implement
more effective rabies surveillance programs structured by
animal control units (where suspicious animals are seized,
euthanized and sampled) and a highly proficient rabies
diagnostics laboratory network at the governmental and
local levels to detect and characterize any rabies outbreaks
in any susceptible hosts. The circulation of a dog-related
RV variant in wildlife populations (in this case of FB) may
pose a severe delay and complicate the elimination of dog
and human rabies. With a low vaccination coverage and
high dog population density, the FB RV may potentially
return to the dog population, or vice versa. Thus, an integral rabies control program should be implemented, targeting both dog and FB populations, by using novel
vaccination strategies. Otherwise, the goal of controlling
animal rabies and eliminating human rabies by 2020 may
not be achievable (the aim set by ASEAN plus 3 rabies
conference).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated that FB rabies is likely
occurring as an independent enzootic that became
established in the FB populations from a dog RV variant
distributed in southeast/south China. The actual role of
FB rabies in public health remains unclear. However,
since potential rabies transmission from FB to humans
and dogs cannot be excluded, immediate rabies awareness should be altered. Standard PEP should be recommended once an exposure is confirmed by reliable
laboratory diagnostics. To meet the goal of elimination
of rabies in humans by 2020, China must strengthen its
rabies surveillance system and develop feasible strategies
and programs for vaccination of dogs and wildlife.
