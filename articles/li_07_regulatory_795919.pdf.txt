<p>A transcription factors in mouse brain.
bHLHcomprehensive regulatory module network of 15 bHLH transcription factors over 150 target genes in mouse brain has been constructed.</p>

Abstract
Background: The basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are important components of the
transcriptional regulatory network, controlling a variety of biological processes, especially the
development of the central nervous system. Until now, reports describing the regulatory network
of the bHLH transcription factor (TF) family have been scarce. In order to understand the
regulatory mechanisms of bHLH TFs in mouse brain, we inferred their regulatory network from
genome-wide gene expression profiles with the module networks method.
Results: A regulatory network comprising 15 important bHLH TFs and 153 target genes was
constructed. The network was divided into 28 modules based on expression profiles. A regulatorymotif search shows the complexity and diversity of the network. In addition, 26 cooperative bHLH
TF pairs were also detected in the network. This cooperation suggests possible physical
interactions or genetic regulation between TFs. Interestingly, some TFs in the network regulate
more than one module. A novel cross-repression between Neurod6 and Hey2 was identified,
which may control various functions in different brain regions. The presence of TF binding sites
(TFBSs) in the promoter regions of their target genes validates more than 70% of TF-target gene
pairs of the network. Literature mining provides additional support for five modules. More
importantly, the regulatory relationships among selected key components are all validated in
mutant mice.
Conclusion: Our network is reliable and very informative for understanding the role of bHLH TFs
in mouse brain development and function. It provides a framework for future experimental
analyses.

Background

Transcription factors (TFs) play pivotal roles in brain development by controlling the sequential generation of neurons
and glia from uncommitted progenitor cells [1]. However, little is known about how gene expression programs are differentially unfolded in various cell types. Recognition of specific
promoter sequences by transcriptional regulatory proteins is
one of the first steps in the initiation of gene expression programs [2-4]. Genome-wide expression profiles provide
important information about the transcriptional regulation of
various cellular and molecular processes. The basic/helixloop-helix (bHLH) proteins comprise a large TF family
involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes,
including cell proliferation, specification and differentiation
during neurogenesis [5]. The bHLH TFs are abundantly
expressed in the developing mouse brain [6], and many subfamilies of bHLH proteins, such as the HES, OLIG, NPAS and
NEUROD families, have been demonstrated to play crucial
roles in the development of the central nervous system [7-11].
The bHLH domain has two functionally distinct regions, the
basic region and the HLH region. The DNA-binding basic
region at the amino terminus of the bHLH domain (approximately 15 amino acids) has a high content of basic residues,
whereas the carboxy-terminal HLH region is formed by two
amphipathic helices separated by a loop region of variable
length [12]. bHLH proteins can be subdivided into six distinct
groups (A to F) in the animal system [5,13]. Briefly, group A
proteins bind to the E-box (CAGCTG) and have a distinctive
pattern of amino acids (XRX) at sites 5, 8, and 13; group B
proteins bind to the G-box (CACGTG) and have a 5-8-13 configuration of K/H-X-R; group C comprises bHLH proteins
that have the PAS domain, which bind to non-E-box sites
(NACGTG or NGCGTG); group D proteins lack the DNAbinding basic region; group E proteins contain a carboxy-terminal WRPW peptide that preferentially bind to N-boxes
(CACGCG or CACGAG); and group F comprises COE-bHLH
proteins [5,13,14].
At present, the increasing gene-expression profiles in public
databases provide us with opportunities to elucidate the possible transcriptional regulatory networks. Since the whole
regulatory network that controls mouse brain function is too
complex to be fully understood at the current time, we chose
to focus on the bHLH TFs and their related regulatory network, which have been shown to play important roles in
mouse brain development. A module network of bHLH TFs
was constructed from mining of genome-wide gene expression data and partially validated experimentally. This module
network may provide an initial platform for the future study
of transcriptional regulation of bHLH TFs in the development
and function of mouse brain.

Results
Construction of the regulatory network
The module networks procedure identifies modules of co-regulated genes, their regulators and the conditions under which
regulation occurs [15]. To construct the module network and
understand the regulatory mechanisms of bHLH TF in mouse
brain, we inferred a regulatory network from the gene expression data with the module networks method proposed by
Segal et al. [15].
To provide a convincing and inclusive network, 1,338 transcripts from the mouse genome, including 100 bHLH TFs,
were chosen as original candidate genes for constructing a
regulatory network from the genome-wide normalized gene
expression data [16], all of which have been proven to be
expressed in the mouse nervous system by gene cloning and
other expression assays [6,17,18]. As shown in Figure 1, we
selected 918 genes involving 61 bHLH TFs from the 1,338
candidate genes in the first selection step, which were
detected in at least one of 11 mouse brain tissues according to
the expression data [16]. These brain tissues included cerebellum, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, dorsal striatum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb,
trigeminal, dorsal root ganglia and pituitary. At the beginning, we tried to detect the interactions among different TF
families, but obtained unstable results since the number of
microarrays was limited to 22. Therefore, we decided to focus
on the regulatory relationships between the bHLH TF family
and their targets.
It is well known that recognition of binding sites (BSs) by TFs
is a prerequisite for the initiation of gene expression. Therefore, the promoter sequences of the 857 candidate target
genes (excluding the bHLH TFs) were extracted from the PromoSer database [19], including 1,000 bp upstream and 50 bp
downstream of each transcription start site. Of the 857 genes,
443 contained one or more reported BSs for bHLH proteins
and were further analyzed together with 61 bHLH TFs in the
second gene selection step (Figure 1). Here, BSs included both
the preferred BSs (E-box, G-box, non-E-box, N-box) of the
bHLH proteins of A to F groups and the experimentally confirmed BSs (TRANSFAC Professional 9.3) of bHLH proteins.
In the final selection process, both target genes and TFs with
expression levels below the average among the different brain
tissues were excluded and this yielded the final subset of 198
genes (Figure 1). This gene subset included 22 bHLH TFs and
was used to build a regulatory network of bHLH TFs in mouse
brain. As a result, the regulatory connections among 153 target genes and 15 bHLH TFs were discovered by the module
network approach. The remaining genes, 23 target genes and
seven bHLH TFs, were not considered here because no regulatory link among them was detected. With the aid of the
Pajek 1.15 program, a hierarchical scale-free network describing the regulations between TFs and their target genes was
drawn (Figure 2); this consists of 168 nodes (genes) and 339
directed connections. The nodes represent TFs or their target

genes, whereas the connections represent regulatory interactions. Every TF node has a large number of connections with
its target genes. The average number of target genes for each
TF is 22, with many target genes shared by more than one TF.
In the learned network, 26 coregulating TF pairs were also
detected. The hierarchical relationships between the TFs are
shown with red lines (Figure 2). Most common transcriptional regulatory motifs described previously were found in
the connections between TFs [20]. For example, Olig1-Hey2Npas4-Ascl1 constitutes a regulatory chain, and Olig1-Hey2Npas4-Idb2-Olig1 is a multi-component loop. Neurod6 forms
a single input structure by regulating Neurod1, Olig1, Myf6,
Hes3 and Tcf4. We found that only a few steps are necessary
to join any two TFs. This presumably facilitates the efficient
propagation and integration of signals [21].

For the most basic network motif (regulatory pattern), threenode and four-node motifs were detected with mfinder 1.2 in
the complete regulatory network [22]. Higher-order motifs
were too complex and not detected here. Six distinct threenode motifs and 66 four-node motifs were detected in the network. We applied a Z-score to quantify differences between
the network motifs of our regulatory network and 100 random networks. The motifs with a Z-score greater than 3 or
less than -3 are listed in Figure 3. The distribution of two
three-node motifs and seven four-node motifs in our network
are significantly different from their randomized counterparts. The network motifs describe how a single node is connected with its neighbours and demonstrate the complexity
and diversity of regulatory mechanisms. The network motifs,
in particular those listed in Figure 3, should play important
roles in performing sophisticated biological tasks.

Modules in the regulatory network

Module nomenclature

Our regulatory network comprises 28 modules (Table 1 and
Additional data file 1), with the number of target genes in each
module varying from 1 to 18. It is worth noting that co-regulating TF pairs or groups (more than two members) were also
detected in the module network (Table 1). For example, the
interaction between Id and Olig, inferred regulators in
module 21, have been reported in oligodendroglial differentiation [23]. We analyzed each of the inferred modules with
regard to a variety of affiliated data sources and evaluated the
validity of their regulatory programs.

To name the modules and investigate their molecular function, we calculated the hypergeometric functional enrichment
score among the modules (Table 1) based on the Gene Ontology (GO) database [24]. Only two modules represent functional enrichments of the utmost significance (Benjaminni
correction, P < 0.05). Most of the modules identified here are
too small to represent significant functional enrichments.
Diversity of molecular functions within these modules suggests, for example, that Neurod6 and Hey2 are TFs that modulate a wide spectrum of genes with diverse functions. Each

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R244

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/11/R244

Genome Biology 2007,

module was assigned a specific name based on the most
enriched (with the lowest P value) GO categories at layer 5.
The GO coherence of each module was measured to determine the percentage of genes in the module covered by the
GO category with the lowest P value (Table 1). For example,
module 15 is regulated by the co-regulating TFs Neurod6 and
Hey2 and is here named Cellular morphogenesis module
because cellular morphogenesis is the most significantly
enriched GO category in the module (P < 0.05). Consistent
with the module name, 60% of genes in this module play a
role in cellular morphogenesis.
In our constructed module network, a target gene can be clustered into only one module. But some TFs can regulate more
than one module under different conditions with the same or
different co-regulating TFs. For example, Neurod6 regulates
modules 10, 15, and 27 with its co-regulator Hey2, but it also
regulates module 2 with another co-regulator, Neurod1. We
named these TFs as multiple-module (MM) regulators.
Npas4 and Neurod6 are representatives of MM regulators,
regulating 8 and 11 modules, respectively (Additional data file
1).

Modules controlled by MM regulators Neurod6 and
Hey2
Another interesting point in our regulatory network is the
presence of co-regulating TF pairs. The most active co-regulating pair, Neurod6 and Hey2, simultaneously regulates
modules 10, 15, and 27, which display dissimilar expression
patterns (Figure 4a–c). Based on the most enriched GO categories, these three modules are involved in protein kinase
activator activity, cellular morphogenesis and morphogenesis
of embryonic epithelium, respectively. As shown in Figure 4,
the expression profiles of these three clusters in brain tissues
are different, but all of them are controlled by Neurod6 and
Hey2. These results support the previous report that Neurod6
modulates a wide spectrum of genes with diverse functions
[25].
The regulatory motifs of these three modules are feed-forward loops, in which the product of one TF gene regulates the
expression of a second TF gene, and both factors together regulate the expression of a third gene (target gene) [20]. In
these modules, Neurod6 can regulate target gene expression
either directly in some tissues or indirectly through first regulating Hey2 expression in other tissues (Figure 4d). Similarly, Hey2 regulates expression of target genes either directly
in some regions or indirectly in other regions through regulating Neurod6. Apparently, the mode (positive or negative) and
site (tissue) of gene regulation or co-regulation are different
in these three modules. The roles of these two TFs could be
reversed and their target genes could be altered in different
modules (Figure 4d). Interestingly, the regulatory relationships between Hey2 and Neurod6 in three modules are all
negatively correlated (Figure 4d). Based on their expression
profiles in three modules (Figure 4a–c), the expression of

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R244

Li et al. R244.7

Hey2 is apparently repressed in the frontal cortex, cerebral
cortex, hippocampus and dorsal striatum regions where
Neurod6 is expressed at a high level. Conversely, Neurod6 is
repressed in the olfactory bulb, trigeminal, dorsal root ganglia
and pituitary in which Hey2 is induced. Thus, we can clearly
observe opposite or complementary patterns of expression
for Neurod6 and Hey2 in various brain tissues. This phenomenon prompted us to propose that Neurod6 and Hey2 crossregulate each other's expression by switching their functions
in different brain regions. To confirm our hypothesis, we performed further analyses on their DNA-binding motifs and
sequences. It was found that both Hey2 and Neurod6 have a
Glu9/Arg12 pair, which has been confirmed by site-directed
mutagenesis experiments and crystal structures to constitute
the CANNTG recognition motif [26-29]. Moreover, the CANNTG motif is also found in both promoter regions of these two
TFs. The cross-repression between Neurod6 and Hey2 has
raised the possibility that they bind to the same target genes
and their expression is mutually cross-regulated at the same
time. As described above, the diversity of co-regulatory relationships between a pair of TFs allows them to have effects on
a variety of molecular activities.

Validity evaluation
It is well known that the binding of a TF to the promoter of its
target genes is a proof for the regulatory relationship. Sitedirected mutagenesis experiments and the crystal structures
of bHLH proteins have shown that the Glu9/Arg12 pair constitutes the CANNTG recognition motif. The critical Glu9
contacts the first CA in the DNA binding motif (DBM), and
the role of Arg12 is to fix and stabilize the position of Glu9
[26-29]. Multiple protein sequence alignments with Multalin
[30] showed that 12 TFs of the regulatory network have the
Glu9/Arg12 pair in the basic region (Additional data file 1), so
those proteins should have the CANNTG recognition motif.
Moreover, bHLH proteins of different groups have their own
DNA binding specificities [5,13]. All TFs in the network were
classified into groups from A to F in agreement with the
nomenclature and the evolutionary analysis [5,13]. Therefore,
the preferred DBMs of the bHLH TFs of different groups
could be predicted (Additional data file 1). Here we named the
predictive DBMs of the TFs as group-DBMs. In order to validate the relationships between bHLH TFs and their target
genes, we performed match analysis with the promoter
sequences of the respective target genes using experimentally
confirmed DBMs and the group-DBMs of bHLH TFs. The
experimentally confirmed DBMs include both that determined using TRANSFAC Professional 9.3 and the CANNTG
motif recognized by Glu9/Arg12 pair. The results show that
235 TF-target gene pairs are verified by experimentally confirmed DBMs, and 115 TF-target gene pairs are supported by
group-DBMs. In total, 71% of TF-target gene pairs (Figure 2),
distributed in most modules (27 of 28) in the network, are
validated by the match of BSs in the promoters. However, as
indicated in Figure 2, some TFs, such as Neurod6 and Olig1,
are highly supported by TFBSs, whereas other TFs, such as

Npas4 and Idb2, have little or no support. One reason could
be that some TFs, like Idb2, do not bind DNA and instead
function by interacting with other TFs [5]. Another possibility
could be that the promoter regions of the genes or the DNAbinding preference of the TFs we obtained have not been fully
determined.
As described above, 27 modules are supported by the match
of BSs. In order to obtain more support information, we performed literature data mining via PubMed from almost 16
million available articles. Literature data mining was used to
predict relationships between genes [31]. The concurrence of
an inferred regulator and one of its target genes in published
abstracts is evident for five of the modules (Table 1). The
absence of concurrence of two given genes may only reflect a
lack of publications [31].

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R244

Li et al. R244.9

To further test the regulatory relationships between Olig1 and
other predicted downstream targets, we compared the
expression of Zic1 and Tbr1 (module 11) in embryonic day 18.5
normal and Olig1 mutant brain. In E18.5 wild-type embryos,
Zic1 is specifically expressed in the ventral forebrain (Figure
6c), whereas Tbr1 expression is restricted to the cerebral cortex (Figure 6d). Expression of Olig1 was observed in both
regions, overlapping with those of Zic1 and Tbr1 (Figure 6a).
Consistent with our predicted regulatory relationship,
expression of both Zic1 and Tbr1 was downregulated in Olig1/- mutant brain (Figure 6g, h). In contrast, Wnt10b is not the
predicted downstream gene of Olig1, and its expression level
in the brain was not affected by the Olig1 mutation (Figure 6b,
f).

Discussion

Experimental tests
Recent studies in the spinal cord showed that Olig1 comprises
the combinatorial code for the subtype specification of neurons and glial cells (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes) together
with Olig2 [32], which is a target gene of Olig1 in the largest
module of the network. The regulatory module (Figure 5d)
shows that Olig1 positively regulates Olig2 in different brain
tissues. Otherwise, there are both direct (Olig1→Olig2) and
indirect regulatory paths (Olig1→Nuerod6→Mitf→Olig2)
connecting Olig1 and Olig2. An indirect connection would
presumably render Olig2 less sensitive to the inactivation of
Olig1while the directed connection would provide more
sensitivity.
To experimentally validate the regulatory relationship
between Olig1 and Olig2 in the largest module, we examined
the expression of Olig2 in the spinal cord of the Olig1 null
mutants at embryonic day 18.5. At this stage, Olig1 and Olig2
are primarily expressed in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage
[33-35]. Consistent with the concept that Olig2 is regulated
by Olig1, the expression of Olig2 in the mutant spinal cord is
significantly reduced (Figure 5a–c). From the results that
show that Olig2 is not completely absent in the spinal cord of
the Olig1 null mutants, we infer that the regulatory pathway
between Olig1 and Olig2 in the spinal cord is indirect. A previous study demonstrated that Olig1 influences Olig2 expression in brain [36]. A recent study indicated that Olig2
influences susceptibility to schizophrenia [37]. As a regulator
of Olig2, Olig1 could be considered as another candidate gene
for the susceptibility to schizophrenia.
In addition, recent studies showed that both Olig1 and TCF4
(module 26) are expressed in mature oligodendrocytes [38].
In E18.5 mouse embryos, a small number of TCF4-expressing
oligodendrocytes could be detected in the wild-type spinal
cord sections but not in the mutant spinal cord (Figure 5e, f).
This result is consistent with our prediction that Olig1 is a key
regulator of TCF4 expression in oligodendrocytes.

In this study, we have constructed a transcriptional regulatory network of bHLH TFs in mouse brain using microarray
data (gene expression profiles) and the module network
method. The Bayesian network method can be used to discover dependency structure between the observed variables,
and, therefore, this method is often used as an important
approach to infer molecular networks [39]. To some extent,
the module network method used in this work can be simply
viewed as a Bayesian network in which the variables in the
same module share common parameters. Module networks
out-perform Bayesian networks even though they are based
on the Bayesian network method [15]. Although other
approaches for inferring regulatory networks from gene
expression data or for identifying modules of co-regulated
genes and their shared cis-regulatory motifs have been
proposed [40-45], the module network can generate detailed
testable hypotheses concerning the role of specific regulators
and the conditions under which this regulation takes place.
Using the same approach, Segal et al. [15] accurately identified the module regulatory networks of S. cerevisiae with
2,355 genes from 173 microarrays [15]. In the gene-selection
process and DBM match analysis, we extracted only a 1,000
bp promoter; however, it is well documented that many neural promoters are much larger than 1 kb. Thus, it is possible
that some potential information could have been missed in
our analysis.
It is known that many other TF families also play pivotal roles
in brain development and it would be interesting and important to study interactions not only within but also between
families. However, the amount of public microarray data
from brain tissues greatly limits the number of TFs or genes
that could be studied in one network. In other words, with
limited microarray data, the inclusion of too many genes in a
single network could lead to unstable results. So, to maintain
the accuracy and robustness of the constructed network, a
certain ratio between the number of genes and microarrays
should be considered. Considering the limited number of
microarrays in this study and the robustness of the potential

inferred network, 198 genes with the greatest variance in their
levels of expression between different tissues were selected as
our final candidate genes in the regulatory network.
Since a relatively small number of TFs from a single family
and their target genes are included in this construction, the
resulting regulatory network (Figure 2) represents only a
small fraction of the whole genome regulatory network in
mouse brain. However, even with a limited amount of data
this small-scale network can reveal special regulatory features of bHLH TFs.
Most of the modules identified in our network are too small to
represent significant functional enrichments. However, the
largest module in the network, the Negative regulation of
metabolism module (module 19), is composed of three bHLH
transcription factors (Olig1, Neurod6, and Mitf) and their 18
target genes (Additional data file 1), whose diverse functions
did not lead to function enrichment at a significant level (P <
0.05). Although the genes in the network of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae determined directly from motif occurrences in
promoters had better GO coherence [46], the results in this
study suggest that genes regulated by the same TFs, and even
having similar expression profiles, could have diverse functions. In other words, for target genes, having shared TFs and
similar expression patterns does not necessarily indicate that
they have the same functions, but instead it suggests that the
various functions in the same module are coordinated. Thus,
further studies are required to place more emphasis on the
functional coordination of these genes.
Our network identified some MM regulators, as represented
by Npas4 and Neurod6, suggesting that they could be the core
elements of the network and have undoubted regulatory roles
in the development of mouse brain. This concept has been
substantiated by some recent reports. Npas4 belongs to group
C of the bHLH TF family, which features the DNA-recognition motif CACGAG. The Npas4 protein, also called limbicenhanced PAS protein (LE-PAS) or NXF, was identified in
mouse brain tissues independently by two research groups in
2004 [47,48]. At the same time, a novel Npsa4 signaling system was found that may be related to the mental retardation
of Down's syndrome [48]. Neurod6, also called Nex, Atoh2 or
Math2, is a member of the NEUROD family that is a critical
effector of the nerve growth factor pathway and is required in
vivo for terminal neuronal differentiation [49]. Transcriptional analysis revealed that Neurod6 modulates a wide spectrum of genes with diverse functions, many of which are key

downstream regulators of the nerve growth factor pathway
and critical to neuritogenesis [25]. Interestingly, the
homologs of four target genes of Neurod6 in rat (Chn1, Jag1,
Glud1 and Sort1) are also found in our regulatory network
and are scattered in four modules regulated by Neurod6. The
consistency between previous reports and our results provides additional support that the modules detected from our
network are tenable.
The cross-repression between the MM regulators Neurod6
and Hey2 was found from the gene expression profiles of
three modules. The cross-repression between TFs has been
widely identified during embryo development in animals. In
the early development stage of vertebrate spinal cord, homeodomain proteins convert a gradient of extracellular Shh signaling activity into discrete progenitor domains through
selective cross-repressive interactions between the complementary pairs of class I and class II homeodomain TFs that
adjoin the same progenitor domain boundary [50]. In the
developing brain, cross-repressive interactions between Otx2
and Gbx2 define the midbrain-hindbrain boundary [51] and
interactions between the homeodomain TFs Pax6 and Pax2
help to delineate the diencephalic-midbrain boundary [52].
Cross-repression between transcription factors have also
been implicated in regionalization in the embryonic mesoderm [53] and pituitary gland [54]. The same principle has
been described during the establishment of anteroposterior
polarity within the Drosophila embryo [55]. Thus, cross-regulatory interactions between transcription factors appear to
be a prevalent strategy for the regional allocation of cell fate.
It is possible that the cross-repression of the Neurod6 and
Hey2 pair in our network controls various functions related to
protein kinase activator activity, cellular morphogenesis and
morphogenesis of embryonic epithelium since they are the
regulators in those modules. However, the roles of Neurod6
and Hey2 in these biological processes, and how their interactions regulate brain development and specify the different
function identities in different brain regions, require further
investigations.

The expression of Wnt10b was similar between Olig1+/- and Olig1-/- (b, f). The Zic1 expression level was significantly reduced in Olig1-/- thalamus

least one of the following tissues: cerebellum; substantia
nigra; hypothalamus; frontal cortex, cerebral cortex; dorsal
striatum; hippocampus; olfactory bulb; trigeminal; dorsal
root ganglia; and pituitary. All values less than 20 in microarrays were clipped to 20. Log-medium transforms on the data
were performed according to the function Y = log2(X/
median). To limit the number of gene expression profiles, 198
genes with the greatest variance in their levels of expression
between different tissues were identified as candidate genes.

Construction of network
The software Genomica for creating a module network was
downloaded from Weizmann's webpage [57]. A module
network was created with default parameters. The whole regulatory network was drawn with Pajek 1.15, which is available
from [58,59]. We also used mfinder, a software tool for the
detection of network motifs. Its application and source code
are available from [60].

Method to compare a real metabolic network with
randomized ones
Following the scheme of Maslov and Sneppen [61], we
applied a Z-score to quantify the difference between a real
metabolic network and its randomized counterparts:

Z =

P − Pr
ΔPr

where P is the graph metric in the real network, and Pr and

Match of DNA-binding motif
The fasta sequences of the promoters, including 1,000 bp
upstream and 50 bp downstream of each transcription start
site, were extracted from the PromoSer database [62]. The
predicted binding sites of genes were obtained according to
the categories of TFs from groups A to F with the aid of the
existing nomenclature and phylogenetic analysis. Here, an
evolutionary tree was built using the neighbor-joining algorithm with MEGA version 3.0 [63]; 1,000 bootstrap replicates
were made with the same program to test the statistical reliability. The known DBMs were obtained from the database
TRANSFAC Professional 9.3 (updated on 2006.5.30) [64].
Multiple alignments of mouse bHLH protein sequences was
performed with Multalin using the default parameters
[30,65].

Enrichment for GO categories in modules
The enrichment for GO categories was analyzed using the tool
GOTM [66,67], which reports enrichment (hypergeometric P
value, Benjaminni correction) with respect to GO categories.

Literature data mining
Literature data mining was performed with the web-based
tool LitMiner [68]. LitMiner is a literature data mining tool
that is based on the annotation of key terms in article
abstracts present in PubMed [31]. This was followed by statistical co-citation analysis of annotated key terms in order to
predict relationships between annotated key terms. Gene
names of bHLH TFs in the network were used as key words in
the literature data mining.

ΔPr are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the
corresponding graph metric in the randomized ensemble.

Target gene expression studies in Olig1 mutants
The Olig1 mutant mouse line was generously provided by Dr
Charles Stiles's Lab at Harvard Medical School. Spinal cord
tissues at the thoracic level and brain tissues were isolated
from E18.5 mouse embryos and then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. Following fixation, tissues were transferred to 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered
saline overnight, embedded in Embedding Medium and then
sectioned (16 μm thickness) on a cryostat. Adjacent sections
from the wild-type and mutant embryos were subsequently
subjected to anti-Olig2 and anti-Tbr1 immunofluorescence
labeling, or in situ RNA hybridization with TCF4, Olig1,
Wnt10b and Zic1 riboprobes. In situ RNA hybridization and
immunofluorescent staining were performed as described
previously [69]. Three adjacent spinal cord sections from
three independent embryos were immunostained with antibodies. Positive cells containing nuclei in the entire spinal
cord sections were counted. Values were presented as mean ±
standard deviation. The differences in values were considered
to be significant at P < 0.05 by Student's t-test.
