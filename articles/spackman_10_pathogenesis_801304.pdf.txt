Abstract
Background: Avian influenza (AI) viruses infect numerous avian species, and low pathogenicity (LP) AI viruses of the
H7 subtype are typically reported to produce mild or subclinical infections in both wild aquatic birds and domestic
poultry. However relatively little work has been done to compare LPAI viruses from different avian species for their
ability to cause disease in domestic poultry under the same conditions. In this study twelve H7 LPAI virus isolates
from North America were each evaluated for their comparative pathogenesis in chickens, ducks, and turkeys.
Results: All 12 isolates were able to infect all three species at a dose of 106 50% egg infectious doses based on
seroconversion, although not all animals seroconverted with each isolate-species combination. The severity of
disease varied among isolate and species combinations, but there was a consistent trend for clinical disease to be
most severe in turkeys where all 12 isolates induced disease, and mortality was observed in turkeys exposed to 9
of the 12 viruses. Turkeys also shed virus by the oral and cloacal routes at significantly higher titers than either
ducks or chickens at numerous time points. Only 3 isolates induced observable clinical disease in ducks and only
6 isolates induced disease in chickens, which was generally very mild and did not result in mortality. Full genome
sequence was completed for all 12 isolates and some isolates did have features consistent with adaptation to
poultry (e.g. NA stalk deletions), however none of these features correlated with disease severity.
Conclusions: The data suggests that turkeys may be more susceptible to clinical disease from the H7 LPAI viruses
included in this study than either chickens or ducks. However the severity of disease and degree of virus shed was
not clearly correlated with any isolate or group of isolates, but relied on specific species and isolate combinations.

Background
Avian influenza (AI) virus causes one of the most economically important diseases of poultry worldwide. AI is classified by the world organization for animal health (OIE) into
two forms, low pathogenicity (LP) and high pathogenicity
(HP), based on virulence in chickens [1]. H7 is one of the
two most economically important AI virus subtypes
because historically all HP AI viruses have been either the
H7 or H5 subtype and it is among the most common subtypes in commercial poultry in the world [1,2]. In numerous cases the HP form mutated from a LPAI H7 (or H5)
virus that was circulating in chickens or turkeys [3-6].
However, not all H7 LPAI viruses become HP.

In the U.S., H7 AI viruses are sporadically recovered
from wild birds (WB) and commercial poultry. Many of
the outbreaks in commercial poultry [7-9] can be traced
to the live bird market (LBM) system of New York and
New Jersey where a single LP H7 genetic lineage persisted from 1994 to 2006 [10,11]. Few studies have
directly compared the pathogenesis of AI virus in the
three primary poultry species: chickens, ducks and turkeys. The aim of this work was to characterize the
pathogenesis of selected North American H7 LPAI virus
isolates from WB, commercial poultry, and the LBMs in
the three primary domestic poultry species; chickens,
ducks and turkeys.

nasal discharge, swollen sinuses as well as lethargy.
Turkeys were the only species where mortality was
observed, which ranged from 10-60% with 9 isolates
(Table 2). The turkeys that died had severe sinusitis
(a bacteriological examination was not conducted). Only
one isolate, CK/NY/30749, caused clinical disease in all
three species, although shed titers and clinical disease
was most severe in turkeys. At no time were clinical disease signs observed in any of the sham inoculated birds.
Microscopic lesions were consistent with what has
been previously reported for AI virus in chickens, ducks
and turkeys. Briefly, lesions observed in tissues from turkeys included viral tracheitis, cilial loss, heterophilic
cecitis, and heterophilic rhinitis in the nasal cavity. Patchy cilial loss in the trachea, heterophilic tracheitis, and
serositis of the kidney was observed in tissues from
ducks. Rare to minimal rhinitis and the presence of

scores (the mean of the maximum clinical scores for
each bird) ranged from 0 to 0.7 in chickens (Figure 1).
Disease was only observed in chickens with 6 isolates
(Figure 1) and not all chickens in these groups were
affected. Disease signs in chickens were primarily conjunctivitis and lacrimation, which generally occurred
from 2-4 days post infection. Only 3 isolates caused
observable clinical disease in ducks (CK/NY/30749, ML/
OH/421 and RT/DE/1538 (abbreviations defined in
table 1)). Mean maximum clinical disease scores for
ducks ranged from 0 to 0.5. The primary clinical sign
presented by ducks was nasal discharge at 2 days PI and
conjunctivitis. All 12 isolates caused observable clinical
disease in turkeys with mean maximum scores ranging
from 0.7 to 2.6, which were significantly higher than
chickens and ducks with 8 of the 12 viruses. Clinical
disease in turkeys included mild to severe conjunctivitis,

as rare focal heterophilic bronchitis was seen in tissues
from chickens.
Virus shed

At days 2 PI, oro-pharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (CL)
swabs from all species were positive for AI viruses by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qrRT-PCR) with the
exception of CL swabs from ducks and turkeys inoculated with ML/OH/421 (Figure 2). However, by day 4 PI
CL swabs from ML/OH/421 infected ducks and turkeys
were positive. The highest OP titers were observed 2-4
days PI, although in ducks, viral shed tended to peak at

2 days PI, whereas in chickens and turkeys, shed tended
to peak at 4 days PI. The highest mean OP titer for turkeys corresponds to a titer of 106.3 50% egg infectious
doses (EID50) with CK/NY/30749 at 2 days PI and GH/
MA/148081 at 4 days PI (Figure 2). The highest mean
OP titer from chickens was 105.8EID50 at 4 days PI with
CK/PA/9801289 (Figure 2) and the highest mean duck
OP titer was 104.9EID50 at 2 days PI with PT/MN/423.
Titers from CL swabs were consistently lower than OP
titers and were generally higher from ducks and turkeys
than from chickens with peak titers observed between
4-7 days PI. The highest CL shed titers were 103.8EID50
with RT/DE/1538 for turkeys at 7 days PI, 10 2.9 EID50
with TK/VA/67 at 7 days PI in chickens, and 105.1EID50
with PT/MN/423 at 4 days PI from ducks. Oral and CL
shed persisted ‘through 10 and 14 days PI with most
isolate and species combinations (Figure 2).
When comparing species for shed of all viruses collectively, turkeys shed significantly (p < 0.05) more virus
orally than either chickens or ducks at 2, 7 and 14 days
PI. At 4 days PI the amount of virus shed orally by both
chickens and turkeys was significantly higher than
ducks. Ten days PI OP viral shed by turkeys was significantly higher than chickens. The only statistically significant differences among species in CL shed for all viruses
collectively was at 14 days PI when turkeys shed higher
titers than either chickens or ducks. All sham inoculated
birds were negative for AI virus OP and CL shedding
throughout the experiment.

epithelium of a turkey exposed to TK/NY/4450 were
positive for AI virus staining. Avian influenza virus antigen was observed in macrophage in spleens from ducks

exposed to GH/MA/148081 or TK/VA/67, and both the
bronchus and spleen from ducks infected with PT/MN/
423 were positive. Staining of macrophage in the spleens
of AIV infected ducks has been reported before [12].
However it is not clear whether the virus is replicating or
whether the antigen is present from non-specific uptake
of the virus. The intestines and cecal tonsils of chickens
infected with CK/NJ/15086 or CK/NY/3112 were also
positive for AI virus antigen by immunohistochemical
staining.
Serology

At the termination of the experiments, 18-21 days PI,
blood was collected from surviving birds and AI virus
antibody was evaluated by commercial ELISA for all 3
species. All surviving turkeys except one exposed to CK/
MD/MinhMa had detectable AI virus antibody at termination (Table 3). All of the chickens seroconverted to all
isolates except PT/MN/423 (89%), CK/PA/9801289
(90%), ML/OH/421 (70%) and RT/DE/1538 (90%). The
proportion of ducks which serocoverted varied by isolate, and 100% of exposed ducks seroconverted to only
5 isolates, seroconversion to the remaining isolates were

between 20% (CK/NY/30749) and 90% (TK/NY/4450)
(Table 3).
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

Full genome sequence was generated for all 12 isolates
to evaluate their genetic diversity and origins. Genetic
diversity of the HA gene of domestic H7 isolates was
one criteria used to select the isolates for this study,
therefore the sequences of the HA genes of many of the
isolates used here have been previously reported [10,11].
Based on these reports and the known epidemiology of
the viruses, the H7 genes had been classified into 2
groups: 1). LBM and LBM-poultry, and 2). WB, which
contained one isolate from the LBM system CK/NY/
12273 (Figure 4). The isolates in this study have a range
of nucleotide (nt) identity of 91.1 to 98.9% among their
HA genes. Three proteolytic cleavage sites (PCS) were
observed among the 12 isolates, all of which are consistent with LPAIV (Table 1). Five isolates (CK/NY/30749,
GH/MA/148081, CK/MD/MinhMa, TK/VA/67, CK/PA/
9801289) have a deletion in HA1 from amino acid 230
to 238, which has been previously described as a feature
of the LBM lineage [10,11].

were found to be similar to other North American wild

All internal protein genes were similar to those of
other North American AI virus isolates, but showed
some phylogenetic diversity among the isolates (additional file 2). Among the M genes of the 12 isolates
there was 92.5 to 99.4% nt identity. Seven isolates had
subtype B NS gene (93.5 to 99.3% nt identity) and five
were subtype A (96.2 to 98.3% nt identity) (table 1). The
NP genes ranged in nt identity from 91.7 to 99.2%. The

five isolates (CK/NY/3112, CK/PA/9801289, GH/MA/
148081, TK/VA/67, and CK/MD/MinMa) from amino
acids 58 to 73, and one isolate, TK/NY/4450, had a stalk

95.0 to 97.7% nt identity. All N3 NA genes phylogenetically assort with other North American N3 genes

Discussion
Twelve H7 LPAI viruses were evaluated for their pathogenesis in chickens, ducks and turkeys. The general patterns of virus shed observed here; OP shed peak at 2-4
days PI and overall higher tittered OP than CL shed which
peaked later, at 4-7 days PI, is typical of LPAI virus infections in chickens and turkeys following respiratory inoculation [13]. Similarly, clinical signs, microscopic lesions,
and patterns of IHC staining were consistent with what
has been reported previously [13]. The comparison among
the species did show consistent differences among the species in disease severity and virus shed. Although there
were no statistically significant trends in disease severity
by virus isolate (although most of the genes in 9 of the 12
isolates were relatively closely related to each other) there
was a clear and significant trend for clinical disease to be
more severe in turkeys than in either chickens or ducks.
In turkeys the mean maximum clinical scores, which
included mortality, were significantly higher than those of
either chickens or ducks with 8 of 12 isolates. Mortality in
turkeys possibly had a secondary bacterial component,
which is typical in the field with respiratory viruses.
Importantly, mortality was not observed in the controls,
varied among the AIV isolates, and the birds which died
shed the highest virus titers, therefore it appears that AIV
was a critical factor for turkey mortality. Additionally, the
turkeys generally shed significantly more virus from both
the OP and CL routes at numerous time points. This suggests that turkeys may be more susceptible to disease from
LPAI virus than chickens or ducks. This is consistent with
a report by Tumpey et al. where turkeys were reported to
be more susceptible than chickens to LP H7N2 AIV from
the 2002 Shenandoah Valley outbreak [14]. In contrast,
Ladman et al. [15] reported that chickens were more susceptible to disease, when inoculated with LP H7N2 AI
viruses isolated from chickens when exposed by the conjunctival sac route.
Although all of the individual birds did not seroconvert, serology indicated that each of the species did

become infected at the dose administered and not all
birds that seroconverted developed disease. Ducks had
the lowest seroconversion rates, interestingly three of
the five isolates with 100% seroconversion rates were
the WB isolates. In contrast turkeys had the highest
rates of seroconversion, which correlated with the trend
for disease in turkeys to be more severe than in either
chickens or ducks. This suggests that virus dose may
have been a factor in disease development.
Also, consistent with the differences in disease severity
among the species, susceptibility studies have reported
the 50% bird infectious dose (BID50) for A/Turkey/VA/
158512/2002 H7N2, which was isolated from the same
outbreak as TK/VA/67, to be 10 2.8 EID 50 in chickens,
10 0.8 EID 50 in turkeys and 10 3.5 EID 50 in Pekin ducks
[16], indicating that it is best adapted to turkeys. In contrast the BID50 for ML/OH/421 has been determined to
be 10 6.6 EID 50 in chickens, and10 1.0 EID 50 in mallard
ducks (data not published). Interestingly, ML/OH/421

had some of the lowest shed titers of all the viruses in
all three species and was shed at the highest titers by
turkeys. Turkeys also had the highest clinical scores of
all three species with ML/OH/421. Importantly, it is
unknown how the chicken egg passage that was used to
propagate these viruses may affect adaptation to chickens and turkeys.
These results are similar to recent comparable studies
with 20 H5 subtype LPAIV viruses [17], where turkeys
were more susceptible to infection and disease, however
mortality was not observed with the H5 isolates.
Another comparable study with 16 H4, H6 and H9 subtype viruses [18] did not show differences in disease
between chickens and turkeys, but based on serology,
turkeys could be infected with more viruses that chickens. In contrast, taking into account data from Halvorson et al. [19] that showed that not all duck origin AI
viruses will readily transmit to turkeys, it is unclear
whether turkeys are more susceptible to infection with

Spackman et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:331
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/331

influenza or are just more susceptible to disease when
they do become infected.
The details of species susceptibility to LPAIV infection
and disease needs to be explored with reverse genetics
which can more definitively identify markers of host
restriction and virulence. Additionally, minimum infectious dose studies would be necessary to establish host
adaptation of the isolates. In the case of the wild bird
isolates one may conclude that the isolates are more
duck or shorebird adapted which seems to be supported
by the virus shed levels by different species in this
study. However, since numerous avian species are
housed in close proximity in the live-bird markets,
neither the exact host passage history nor the host adaptation can be inferred from the species of origin.
One practical implication of this is that infection
would likely be detected more easily in turkeys, whereas
sub-clinical infection may spread unnoticed until the
birds are tested prior to slaughter (currently 100% of
turkey and chicken flocks are tested for AI virus prior
to slaughter in the US).
Since both LPAI viruses and HPAI viruses are
reported to primarily cause sub-clinical disease in wild
mallard ducks, the induction of mild disease by LPAI
virus in Pekin ducks which are most closely related to
mallard ducks but which are bred for rapid growth, is
important for the commercial duck industry. It has been
reported that some Asian lineage H5N1 HPAI virus isolates can cause disease in ducks, but the severity of disease depends on duck age and species [20,21]. Twoweek old Pekin ducks, like what was used here, were
among the most susceptible to disease with the Asian
H5N1 HPAI virus [20].
To complement the clinical data and to provide a
more complete characterization of the isolates, full genome sequence was produced for all 12 isolates and a
basic analysis was conducted. In depth analysis of the
HA and NA genes of the H7N2 isolates has already
been reported [10,11]. There was no clear correlation
between gene constellation, or a particular gene and any
biological or pathogenic characteristic evaluated here.
Further work with reverse genetics would need to be
conducted to identify markers for species adaptation
and virulence.

Conclusions
Twelve LPAI viruses of the H7 subtype were evaluated
in chickens, turkeys, and ducks for clinical disease and
virus shed. All 12 viruses could infect all three species
at the dose of 10 6 EID 50 by the simulated respiratory
route based on seroconversion. Turkeys consistently
presented with the most severe disease and highest OP
and CL shed titers, which indicate that, broad breasted
white turkeys may be more susceptible to disease from

some LPAI virus than white leghorn chickens or Pekin
ducks.

Methods
Viruses

Twelve North American origin LPAI viruses were
selected to represent different H7 HA genetic groups,
different species of origin and different dates of origin
within the available H7 subtype domestic LPAI viruses
(Table 1). Viruses were propagated and titrated in 9 to
11 day-old embryonated chicken eggs by standard procedures [22].
Pathogenesis studies

Pathogenesis studies were conducted with specific
pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), broad breasted white turkeys (Meleagris
galopova) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus). Chickens were obtained at 2 weeks of age from a
commercial supplier of SPF animals (Charles-River SPAFAS, Franklin, CT) and were housed in isolators until
they were exposed to the virus at 4 weeks of age. There
are no sources of turkeys and ducks which are maintained as SPF or free from viral or bacterial respiratory
diseases therefore turkeys and ducks were obtained from
commercial hatcheries at hatch and were housed in isolators until they were exposed to virus at 2 weeks of
age. All birds were obtained from flocks with no antibody or prior exposure to AI virus. The birds were
housed in glove-port isolators (Allentown Caging, Allentown, NJ) with ad libitum access to feed and water
before and after exposure to the viruses. Ducks and turkeys were exposed to the virus at 2 weeks instead of 4
weeks of age to accommodate the larger size and faster
growth rates of these species in the animal facilities.
Since the immune systems of all three species at these
ages are considered to be relatively immature, this difference is not expected to impact species associated differences in susceptibility to LPAIV infection and disease.
Animals were cared for in accordance with established
humane procedures and biosecurity guidelines.
Thirteen to 15 of each species were inoculated with
106 EID50 per bird in 0.1 ml by the intrachoanal route.
The birds were monitored daily for clinical disease signs
which were scored as follows: 0 = no signs, 1 = mild
to moderate respiratory signs (mild depression in
ducks), 2 = moderate to severe (i.e. depressed, not eating, neurological signs), 3 = Dead. Oro-pharyngeal and
CL swabs were each collected at days 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14
post inoculation (PI) to evaluate virus shed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qr-RT-PCR). Three days PI, 3-5
birds from each group were euthanized and necropsied
to evaluate gross lesions. Tissues (heart, lung, pancreas/
duodemun, kidney, liver, ileum, jejunum, ceca, bursa,

Spackman et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:331

thymus, spleen, breast muscle, thigh muscle, brain, nasal
cavity, adrenal glands, cecal tonsils, trachea, and reproductive organs) were collected for microscopic evaluation. Serum was collected from ducks at 18 days PI and
from chickens and turkeys at 21 days PI to confirm
infection status.
qrRT-PCR

RNA was extracted with the MagMAX-96 Viral Isolation Kit (Ambion Inc. Austin, TX) with the KingFisher
(Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) magnetic particle processor in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted with a primer-probe set that targeted the matrix
gene as described previously [23] using the AB 7500
FAST (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) instrument
and the AgPathID (Ambion) one-step RT-PCR kit in
accordance with kit instructions. Standard curves for
virus quantification were established with RNA
extracted from dilutions of the same titrated stock of
the virus being evaluated.
Immunohistochemistry

Because of the sensitivity limitations of immunohisotochemical (IHC) staining for AI virus antigen, tissues
were only processed for IHC from birds with OP or CL
shed titers greater than 104EID50 2 days PI. Tissue sections were cut (4 μm thick) from paraffin-embedded tissue samples and mounted on charged glass slides
(Superfrost/Plus; Fisher Scientific). Deparaffinization,
antigen retrieval and blocking procedures have been
previously described [24]. A 1:2,000 dilution of a
mouse-derived monoclonal antibody (P13C11) specific
for a type A influenza virus nucleoprotein (developed at
Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, USDA) was
applied and allowed to incubate for 2 hours at 37°C.
The primary antibody was then detected by the application of biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody using a biotin-streptavidin detection system
(Supersensitive Multilink Immunodetection System, Biogenex). Fast Red TR (Biogenex) served as the substrate
chromagen, and hematoxylin was used as a counterstain.
Serology

Antibody collected at 18 (ducks) or 21 (chickens and
turkeys) days PI from surviving birds was used to confirm infection status. Sera were tested by commercial
ELISA (FlockCheck, IDEXX Inc., Westbrook ME). Sera
were tested at the manufacturer’s recommended dilution
of 1:500 and also at 1:100 and 1:50. The dilution of
1:100 was selected for final analysis because at this dilution there were no false-positives among the sera from
negative control birds and there appeared to be better
sensitivity.

Sequencing and Phylogenetic analysis

Full genome sequencing of all isolates was performed as
previously described [11]. Genbank accession numbers
for new sequence generated for this study are and previously reported sequences are provided in Additional
File 3. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using either
ClustalV or ClustalW (Lasergene 7.1, DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Trees were constructed with BEAST v. 1.4.8
[25] using HKY substitution, empirical base frequency,
Gamma heterogeneity, codon 2 partitions, relaxed lognormal clock, Yule Process tree prior with default
operators with UPGMA starting tree and MCMC length
of 106.
Statistical analysis

Mean maximum clinical scores were compared by poultry species for each isolate and virus shed was evaluated
by species for each day PI and swab type (OP or CL).
All comparisons were conducted with the Student’s Ttest and the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test if the normality test failed (Sigmaplot 11.0, Systat Inc. San Jose,
CA). All statistics were evaluated with a significance
threshold of p ≤ 0.05
