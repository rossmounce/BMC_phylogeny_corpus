Abstract

Conclusion: When compared with their closely related pathogenic E. coli relatives, the more
niche-limited Shigella strains appear to be losing genes at a significantly accelerated rate. A genomewide reduction in the effectiveness of purifying selection plays a role in creating this observed
difference. Our results demonstrate that differences in the effectiveness of selection contribute to
differences in rate of gene loss in facultative pathogenic bacteria. We discuss how the lifestyle and
pathogenicity of Shigella may alter the effectiveness of selection, thus influencing the rate of gene
loss.

is due to two types of reduction in purifying selection [2,4-6],
pathway-specific reduction and genome-wide reduction. In
pathway-specific reduction, specific functions that are carried
out by free-living bacteria may be provided to a certain extent
by the host of the pathogenic bacteria, or may not be needed
once a pathogen adapts to survival within a host. For this reason, purifying selection may be less effective in preventing the
loss of some genes involved in specific pathways that are no
longer as useful as they were in the free-living ancestor of the
pathogenic bacteria. In genome-wide reduction, population
size and structure may be different in pathogens compared

It was long thought that mutations in the sequences of individual genes are the strongest contributors to evolutionary
change. In recent years, evidence has accumulated showing
that the emergence of new strains of pathogenic bacteria can
be better explained by changes in the repertoire of genes
through gene acquisition and gene loss [1-3]. Obligate pathogens tend to lose a very high number of genes compared with
facultative pathogens, which, in turn, harbor a larger number
of pseudogenes than free-living bacteria [3]. It was postulated
that the observed increase in gene loss in obligate pathogens

Results: We examined in detail the rate of gene loss in two groups of facultative pathogenic
bacteria: pathogenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella. We show that Shigella strains are losing genes at
an accelerated rate relative to pathogenic E. coli. We demonstrate that a genome-wide reduction
in the effectiveness of selection contributes to the observed increase in the rate of gene loss in
Shigella.

deposited research

Background: Obligate pathogenic bacteria lose more genes relative to facultative pathogens,
which, in turn, lose more genes than free-living bacteria. It was suggested that the increased gene
loss in obligate pathogens may be due to a reduction in the effectiveness of purifying selection. Less
attention has been given to the causes of increased gene loss in facultative pathogens.

with free-living bacteria. Specifically, population size is likely
to be reduced in obligate pathogens. These differences may
influence the effectiveness of selection. For this reason, all
genes, independent of the pathways in which they are
involved, may be more readily lost in pathogens than in freeliving organisms. While these two sources of reduction in the
effectiveness of selection were previously described regarding
obligate pathogens, it is reasonable that they may also play a
role in determining the rate of gene loss in facultative
pathogens.
In addition to changes in the efficacy of purifying selection,
changes in the patterns of positive selection may also play a
role in determining gene loss. Specifically, the products of
some genes may be detrimental to pathogenicity and their
loss from a pathogen's genome may be adaptive [1]. For
instance, in Shigella, the loss of the cadA gene, encoding the
lysine decarboxylase, was shown to correlate with an increase
in pathogenicity [7-9]. Also, genes that encode cell-surface
determinants are sometimes adaptively lost from pathogen
genomes [1], presumably in order to avoid the restrictive
effects of the host immune response. This has been observed
in pathogens such as Shigella [10], Bordetella [11], and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [12].
In this study we examined the relationship between gene loss
and the effectiveness of selection in 12 fully sequenced facultative pathogenic Escherichia coli and Shigella strains. Different strains of pathogenic E. coli may infect a variety of
hosts and cause a number of intestinal as well as extra-intestinal diseases [13]. In contrast, all Shigella strains infect only
humans and closely related primates. They invade the cells of
infected individuals and cause a specific disease (Shigellosis,
or bacillary dysentery) [7,14,15]. Historically, Shigella and E.
coli have been classified as two distinct species. However,
more recent studies indicate that Shigella strains have been

http://genomebiology.com/content/8/8/R164

derived repeatedly from different branches of the E. coli
strain tree through independent acquisition of the pINV virulence plasmid [7,13-15].
Here, we examine gene loss along the branches of the E. coli/
Shigella strain tree and demonstrate a significantly accelerated rate of gene loss along the branches leading towards the
Shigella strains. We demonstrate that at least some of the variation observed in the rate of gene loss can be explained by a
genome-wide reduction in the effectiveness of purifying
selection along the Shigella branches of the tree.

Results
More E. coli K12 genes are absent from Shigella than
from other pathogenic E. coli strains
We compared the protein-coding gene repertoire of the wellannotated non-pathogenic lab strain E. coli K12 to that of the
six fully sequenced pathogenic E. coli strains and the six fully
sequenced Shigella strains. We examined whether each of the
4,183 protein-coding genes of E. coli K12 is present or absent
in each of the studied E. coli and Shigella strains. In order to
focus on gene loss, we eliminated from our examination genes
that are predicted to be horizontally transferred into E. coli
K12 [16]. We also wanted to minimize the number of cases in
which a gene is falsely annotated in E. coli K12. To this end,
we removed from consideration all genes that have no functional annotation in the E. coli annotation database, Ecogene
[17]. This left us with a dataset of 2,394 genes. It is immediately apparent that more E. coli K12 genes are absent from
Shigella strains than from E. coli strains (Table 1).

information

When analyzing the relationship between dS and the numbers of genes lost, we did not take codon-bias into account.
While dS should be less affected than dN by the strength of
purifying selection, for some codon-biased genes, synonymous mutations may also be under purifying selection. For
this reason, the average dS should be somewhat lowered by
purifying selection. As selection is weaker along the branches
leading towards the Shigella strains, dS should be less
affected by codon-bias, along the Shigella branches when
compared to the E. coli branches. Note that this is conserva-

interactions

The average dN along each branch correlates with gene loss
even more strongly than does the average dS (rspearman = 0.82,
P = 5.52e-6). Using Poisson regression models (see Materials
and methods) we show that dN adds information about the
rate of gene loss beyond that implicit in dS (LR = 620, df = 1,
P < 2 × 10-16). It thus appears that a reduced genome-wide
efficiency in selection may explain at least part of the acceleration observed in the rate of gene loss in Shigella.

refereed research

It is possible that the accelerated rate of gene loss along the
Shigella branches is due to a reduction in the effectiveness of
selection. In order to examine whether there is, indeed, a
reduction in the effectiveness of selection along the Shigella
branches, we plotted the average dN against the average dS of
each branch (Figure 3). If the effectiveness of selection is
reduced for the Shigella strains, we expect higher dN values
along a Shigella branch than along an E. coli branch for similar dS values. Indeed, a linear regression of dN on dS and the
branch type indicates that, for similar values of dS, dN values
tend to be higher along the Shigella branches (P = 0.0217).

It is reasonable to assume that the number of genes lost
increases over time. Since dS approximates evolutionary
time, it is not surprising that gene loss is positively correlated

compared to the E. coli branches.

reports

Of the E. coli K12 genes studied, 1,214 were found to be conserved in all the E. coli and Shigella strains considered and in
S. typhimurium. We aligned the sequences from all of these
1,214 genes separately. We ran the PAML Codeml program
[18] on these alignments using the 'all branch', free-ratio
model in order to estimate the rate of synonymous (dS) and
non-synonymous (dN) substitutions per site along each
branch of the tree. Average dS and dN values were then calculated for each branch of the tree. While single gene estimates
of dS and dN may be rather noisy, we averaged these values
across a large number of genes and, therefore, believe that the
average estimates we received are informative. Generally, the
average dS can be taken as a measure of the age of the branch,
while the average dN measures both time and the genomewide effectiveness of selection along a branch. As the strains
studied are very closely related, the dS values we calculated
are small. This indicates that saturation of dS values is not a
problem in this dataset.

with the average dS along a branch (rspearman = 0.79, P ≤ 3.41e5). However, differences in the age of the Shigella and E. coli
branches do not seem to fully explain the higher number of
genes lost along the Shigella branches. When the number of
genes lost along each branch is plotted against the average dS
(Figure 2) it appears that gene loss tends to occur at an accelerated rate along the branches leading towards Shigella
strains (red) compared with those leading toward E. coli
strains (blue). To test formally whether both dS and the type
of branch (Shigella versus E. coli) influence the rate of gene
loss, we used a Poisson regression model (see Materials and
methods). We modeled the number of genes lost along a
branch as a Poisson random variable, whose mean parameter
may depend on dS and on a binary strain indicator variable
that receives the value one if the branch leads towards a Shigella strain and the value zero if it leads towards a pathogenic
E. coli strain. We found that both dS and the strain indicator
variable are statistically significant (P < 2 × 10-16 for both variables). Furthermore, the regression coefficient correspond-

reviews

Since we removed from consideration those genes predicted
to have been horizontally transferred into E. coli K12, we
assume that for the remaining genes horizontal gene transfer
is negligible. We can thus postulate that if two bacteria, a and
b, share an immediate ancestor, Aa.b, and a gene is absent
from a but present in b, it was present in Aa.b and was lost on
the branch that connects Aa.b to a. Based on this we assessed
the most likely branches along which each gene was lost and
calculated the number of E. coli K12 genes lost along each
branch of the tree. Genes that were duplicated in E. coli K12
after it split from the other strains may be falsely annotated by
this scheme as having been lost in all of the other strains
examined. As the organisms examined are very close, we do
not expect to see many such cases. In addition, since such
genes will be counted as lost in all branches, they should not
affect our analysis, which is comparative by nature.

tree was constructed based on the alignment of the concatenated sequences of 100 genes that are conserved in all the
examined strains and that were selected at random (Materials
and methods). In order to further confirm the reliability of the
tree, we applied bootstrap analysis using 100 replicas (Materials and methods). The resulting tree is shown in Figure 1.
Constructing phylogenies for bacterial strains is complicated
by the frequent occurrence of horizontal gene transfer. We
sought to minimize this problem by excluding from our analysis those sequences that were predicted to be horizontally
transferred into E. coli K12. In addition, we used a large
number of concatenated gene sequences to build our tree.
Even if some of these genes were horizontally transferred into
some of the strains studied, we believe that this noise should
be diluted within our dataset. As can be seen in Figure 1, most
branches of the tree have very high bootstrap support.

similar amount of time the average dS should be higher in the
Shigella strains compared to the pathogenic E. coli strains.
Thus, we are likely to overestimate the age of the Shigella
branches and underestimate the rate of gene loss in the Shig-

gene loss in Shigella is thus likely to be even higher.

Fitting with this speculation, we found an anecdotal indication that the prpB gene, which encodes a phosphoprotein
phosphatase and has been implicated in the confinement of
Shigella to their limited niche [19], may have been lost in the
branch leading towards the EHEC-S. dysenteriae ancestor

interactions

One of the branches in the examined pathogenic E. coli/Shigella strain tree could not be easily classified as an E. coli or
Shigella branch. This is the branch that leads towards the
ancestor of the two enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)
strains (E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157:H7 EDL933) and the
Shigella dysenteriae strain. It is unclear whether this ancestor was a Shigella, an E. coli, or something in between. However, it is interesting to note that genes are lost along this
branch at a rate comparable to that of the Shigella branches
(Figure 2). The rate of gene loss observed along the branch
leading from this ancestor of EHEC and Shigella dyseneteriae towards the two EHEC strains fits with the slower rate
observed for E. coli branches (Figure 2). In contrast, the rate
along the branch leading from the same ancestor to S. dysenteriae is more fitting with that observed for other Shigella
branches (Figure 2). It is tempting to speculate that the ancestor of the EHEC strains and of S. dysenteriae was heading on
the evolutionary path toward becoming a Shigella. It is possible that one of its descendants then continued on the Shigella
pathway and became S. dysenteriae while another lost the
Shigella invasion plasmid and reverted back to a lower rate of
gene loss, which led to the evolution of the EHEC strains.

refereed research

In order to test this expectation, we calculated a pairwise dN/
dS for each gene in each of the E. coli and Shigella strains
against the reference sequence of the same gene from E. coli
K12. These dN/dS values were then normalized within each
strain by calculating a Z-score (see Materials and methods)
and an average was calculated for all the strains in which the
gene is present. Next, we divided the genes based on the
number of times they appear to have been lost along the E.
coli/Shigella strain tree (Table 2). In order to examine
whether genes that are lost more often have higher dN/dS
values in the strains in which they are conserved, we conducted one-tailed Mann-Whitney tests to compare each
group to the group that precedes it. For instance, we compared whether genes that are lost once evolve significantly
faster than genes that are never lost. The average dN/dS of
each group is higher than that of the group that precedes it
(Table 2) and this difference is statistically significant (P <
0.05) for all of the comparisons (Table 2).

which genes will be lost. If this is indeed the case and a reduction in selection occurs across the genome independently of
the function of genes, it is likely that the genes that will be
most readily lost are those that have been under weaker purifying selection.

tal gene transfer. Namely, when we constructed a phylogenetic tree of the E. coli strains based on the prpB sequence
(Figure 4a) we obtained a different tree than the consensus
tree that we obtain by analyzing the alignment of the concatenated sequences of 100 genes that were selected at random
(Figure 4b). While the difference in the maximum likelihood
scores of the two trees, given the prpB sequence data is at best
marginally statistically significant (P = 0.082 by the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [20]), it may still be of interest. The tree
in Figure 4b is more likely to represent the true phylogeny of
the E. coli strains. Thus, if the prpB sequence gives a different
tree, in which the EHEC strains are closer to E. coli UTI89
and E. coli APEC 01 than to the lab strains of E. coli, it may
indicate that prpB has been horizontally transferred.

Discussion

It has been suggested in the past that obligate pathogens lose
more genes than free-living organisms, due to differences in
the effectiveness of purifying selection [2-4]. Here we focus
on gene loss in facultative pathogenic E. coli and Shigella
strains. While Shigella are considered to be clones of E. coli
and have been derived repeatedly from different branches of
the E. coli tree [7,13-15], we show that they are losing genes at
an accelerated rate compared to other pathogenic E. coli
strains. We demonstrate that this accelerated rate of gene loss
can be partially explained by a genome-wide reduction in the
effectiveness of purifying selection on the branches leading
towards the Shigella strains. This genome-wide reduction in
purifying selection may be explained by differences in the
population structure and population size of Shigella compared with the other pathogenic E. coli strains. Shigella's only
natural hosts are humans, although it can infect other higher
primates as well [7]. In addition, it has been shown that as little as 200 Shigella cells are sufficient to cause dysentery [13].
It is possible that its limited host-range together with the relatively small dosage needed to cause infection lead to a

reduction in the effective population size of Shigella that, in
turn, leads to the observed reduction in the effectiveness of
selection
Our analysis demonstrates that differences in the genomewide effectiveness of purifying selection contribute significantly to the accelerated rate of gene loss in Shigella. In
addition, it is possible that some of the acceleration in the rate
of gene loss is attributable to a higher incidence of pathwayspecific reduction in purifying selection. Shigella are intracellular pathogens and as such occupy a very different niche than
most E. coli strains. This lifestyle may explain why Shigella
has no need for several of the pathways that are known to be
lost in several Shigella strains [7,13]. For instance, Shigella
does not biosynthesize flagella, due to its ability to utilize
actin-assisted motility in order to move intracellularly [7,21].
In addition, Shigella is more host-specific than the other
strains considered [7,13]. It appears that compared to the
other E. coli strains studied, Shigella may be more limited in
the niche it can occupy, which may explain why more pathways can be readily lost in Shigella.
It thus appears that the increased rate of gene loss in Shigella
may be the result of its increased host specificity. Previous
studies have also shown a link between host-specificity and
higher incidence gene loss: Normand et al. [22] studied
strains of the facultative plant symbiont Frankia and showed
that genome size in these bacteria reduces with an increase in
host specificity. An association between gene loss and
increase in host specificity was also demonstrated for facultatively pathogenic strains of Bordetella and Salmonella
[11,23]. Unlike other serovars of Salmonella, Salmonella
typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A are limited to infecting
only humans. Both serovars have a similar pahtogenicity phenotype [23]. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that while
both of these Salmonella serovars accumulated a large
amount of pseudogenes, the number of genes that have been

support our finding that following a reduction in host-range
much of the increase in gene loss is due to a reduction in the
effectiveness of purifying selection that is genome-wide

information

At the early stages of the process it may be possible for an
evolving Shigella strain to lose its invasion plasmid, gain
some genes back through horizontal gene transfer and revert
back to the E. coli phenotype. We show a possible example of
such a case. It appears that the ancestor of the two EHEC
strains and the S. dysenteriae strain was losing genes at a rate
comparable to that of Shigella. It is possible that this ancestral strain carried the invasion plasmid and was starting on
the evolutionary path to becoming a Shigella. While some of
its descendants may have continued to lose genes at an accelerated rate, resulting in the S. dysenteriae strain we see
today, others may have reverted back to the E. coli rate of
gene loss leading to the evolution of the EHEC strains. In the
case described above, the ancestor of EHEC and S. dysneteriae may have lost the prpB gene that seems to have been regained by horizontal gene transfer in the ancestor of the two

interactions

On the one hand, high niche specificity may lead to both
genome-wide and pathway specific reductions in the effectiveness of purifying selection, which, in turn, may lead to
accelerated gene loss. On the other hand, accelerated gene
loss may increase niche specificity as more and more functions are removed from the genome. This raises an interesting
chicken-egg type question: is reduction in the selection
against gene loss the result of the increased niche specificity
of Shigella, or is it its cause? It is possible that both are true
and that this is an autocatalytic process. After acquiring the
invasion plasmid that allows Shigella strains to invade
mucosal epithelium cells, some genes may be lost. This in
turn limits the possibility of a Shigella strain to renege on this
strategy and forces it to remain in the limited niche it now

occupies. Once Shigella occupies this limited niche, reduction
in purifying selection leads to an additional loss of genes at an
accelerated rate.

replicas that agree with each branch assignment is indicated. Unlike in the 'true' tree represented in Figure 1 and in (b), the prpB-tree shows the EHEC
strains, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 to be closer to E. coli UTI89 and E. coli APEC 01 than to the lab strains of E. coli. This may indicate that
the prpB was horizontally transferred into the EHEC strains.

EHEC strains. The prpB gene encodes a phosphoprotein
phosphatase that functions in signal transduction pathways
for the degradation of misfolded proteins [19]. A recent study
[19] has shown that prpB is extremely susceptible to loss in
Shigella strains. Of 58 strains examined, only 12 encoded an
intact prpB open reading frame. It was suggested that losing
the prp function limits the tolerance of the Shigella strains to
external stresses. This in turn may reduce the environmental
elasticity of Shigella and thus further limit the niche width for
these bacteria. While prpB is absent from 46 of 58 strains
examined by Li et al. [19] and is also absent from the 6 fully
sequenced Shigella strains used in this study, it is present in
all fully sequenced E. coli strains. It thus appears that in order
to revert back to the E. coli lifestyle, the ancestor of the EHEC
strains may have had to regain the prp function through horizontal gene transfer.
It would be interesting to learn whether there is a point of no
return after which a Shigella strain has lost so many genes
that it would no longer be able to regain enough functions to
escape niche limitation. If such a point of no return exists,
then the Shigella phenotype may represent an evolutionary
dead-end. While Shigella species evolve repeatedly from different strains of E. coli, it might be much harder for a Shigella
strain to give rise to a strain of E. coli.
Some cases of gene loss may be adaptive. For example, it has
been shown that lysine decarboxylation is detrimental to
Shigella pathogenicity and that the introduction of the cadA
gene encoding the lysine decarboxylase into Shigella flexneri
2a reduces its pathogenicity [8,9]. It thus appears that positive selection may act to remove the cadA gene from the
genomes of Shigella strains. It is, however, hard to estimate
the proportion of genes that have been lost due to positive
selection. Unless there is information regarding the fitness
effect of a specific gene loss event, it is not currently possible
to distinguish whether it was lost adaptively or whether it was
lost as the result of a reduction in purifying selection. To further complicate matters, cases of gene loss that are due to
reduction in purifying selection may lead to other gene loss
events that may be adaptive. For example, loss of flagellar
genes may occur in Shigella due to a pathway-specific reduction in purifying selection, as Shigella strains do not need
flagella for their motility. However, once the flagellar function
is lost, it may be adaptive to lose the master activator of the
flagellar pathway, as this will ensure that the remaining flagellar genes will not be expressed and energy will not be wasted
[21,24]. In addition, once the flagellar function is no longer
useful it may be adaptive to stop producing flagella completely due to the strong immunogenic properties of the flagellar apparatus.
It is important to note that in addition to reductions in the
effectiveness of purifying selection, positive selection may
also increase the average dN. It is very hard to distinguish
between the two sources of increase in dN, as both may act

http://genomebiology.com/content/8/8/R164

together. It is possible to attempt to estimate whether significantly more adaptations are occurring in Shigella by considering genes that have clearly been subject to positive selection
and have dN/dS values that are significantly higher than one.
If indeed positive selection is much stronger in all Shigella
strains compared to all E. coli strains, we may find more such
genes in Shigella than in other pathogenic E. coli strains.
Such an examination is far from conclusive as genes may be
under positive selection even if the ratio between dN and dS
is lower than one. Moreover, reduced effectiveness of purifying selection in Shigella may also increase the ratio of dN and
dS, which together with similar levels of positive selection
may lead to more genes in Shigella having dN/dS >> 1. Nevertheless, such an analysis may give some indication as to
whether positive selection is more abundant for Shigella.
Genes for which dN/dS is significantly higher than one are
rare in both E. coli and Shigella and their numbers do not
seem to differ much between Shigella and other pathogenic E.
coli. The Shigella strain with the most genes with dN/dS
larger than one (Shigella flexneri 2a) has 11 such genes while
the pathogenic E. coli strain with the most such genes (E. coli
O157:H7 EDL 933) has 8. Only 1 to 4 genes in each of the
examined Shigella strains have dN/dS values larger than 1.5.
The same is true for the other pathogenic E. coli strains.
While this indicates that not many more genes in Shigella are
under very strong positive selection than in other pathogenic
E. coli, it does not prove that positive selection does not affect
dN more strongly in Shigella. However, our finding that the
genes that are lost more readily are those that are less constrained in the organisms in which they are maintained points
towards reduced purifying selection playing a prominent role
in increasing gene loss.
A recent study [25] has attempted to test the rate of adaptive
evolution in enteric bacteria by applying a methodology based
on the McDonald-Kreitman test. The McDonald-Kreitman
test estimates adaptation by comparing the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms within a population
to the same ratio in substitutions that occur between species
[26]. Charlesworth et al. [25] examined six strains of E. coli
and six strains of Salmonella enterica and considered each
group of six strains to represent a separate species. They
counted differences between different E. coli strains as polymorphisms and differences between an E. coli strain and a
Salmonella strain as substitutions. Based on this they calculated the percentage of adaptive substitutions to be around
50%. The McDonald-Kreitman test and the methodologies
that were derived from it all rely on certain assumptions.
Among these is the assumption that the evolutionary process
is stationary [26]. We demonstrate that this key assumption
does not hold for all enteric bacteria, as we show that the
effectiveness of purifying selection is different for different
groups of enteric bacteria. For instance, if MacDonald-Kreitman tests utilize polymorphism levels in Shigella rather than
in E. coli, they would yield different estimates for the percentage of adaptive substitutions. It may thus be important to use

a variety of sources for polymorphism data to test for robustness of McDonald-Kreitman tests.

In order to study the rate of evolution of genes that are conserved in all the examined strains and of those that are conserved in only some of the strains, we followed the following
strategy: first, a pairwise dN/dS of all the genes conserved in
each of the 12 pathogenic bacteria was calculated against the
E. coli K12 corresponding sequences. We then normalized
these dN/dS values within each strain by calculating a Zscore:

Z ( gene, strain ) =

dN / dS ( gene, strain ) − dN / dS ( strain )
σ dN / dS ( strain)

Construction and comparison of phylogenetic trees
Of the 2,394 genes in our dataset, 1,214 are present in all the
pathogenic E. coli and Shigella strains as well as in S. typhimurium and can be aligned across their entire sequence to

information

As a final step, the normalized values of each gene in each of
the strains in which that gene was conserved were averaged
across strains. This resulted in each gene receiving a single
value that represents its rate of evolution in the bacteria in
which it is present.

interactions

Gene sequences for the 2,394 E. coli K12 genes were extracted
from GenBank version NC_000913.1 of the E. coli K12
genome, and annotations of the genes were extracted from
the Ecogene database [17]. The genomic sequences of E. coli

CFT073, E. coli 536, E. coli UTI89, Shigella flexneri 2a, Shigella flexneri 2a 2457T, Shigella flexneri 5 8401, Shigella sonnei Ss046, Shigella boydii Sb227, Shigella dysenteriae
Sd197, and Salmonella typhimurium LT2 were downloaded
from the NCBI ftp server [27]. As each genome project annotates the protein-coding genes within its genome using different methods and different thresholds, we did not wish to rely
on the annotations provided with the genome sequences.
Instead, we relied only on the more experimentally verified
annotation of E. coli K12 genes provided in the Ecogene database [17] and developed a methodology for detecting gene
absence in very closely related bacteria that does not rely on
the annotation of the other genomes: Each E. coli K12 protein-coding gene was compared at the DNA level to the complete genomic sequence of each of the 13 other bacteria using
a locally installed version of the FASTA program [28], and the
best hit and percentage identity were recorded for each

For each of the 2,394 genes in our dataset, we generated a
pairwise alignment between the sequence of the E. coli K12
gene and the corresponding sequence in each of the
pathogenic E. coli and Shigella strains in which this gene was
conserved (based on the results of the process described in
the previous section). Alignments were created using a locally
installed version of the FASTA program [28]. Based on these
alignments we calculated dN/dS for each sequence pair as
described in Nei and Gojobori [29].

In this study we examined the rates of gene loss in a relatively
large number of pathogenic E. coli and Shigella strains and
correlated them with the genome-wide effectiveness of purifying selection. We demonstrate that gene loss is accelerated
for Shigella compared to other pathogenic E. coli. Our results
show that this observed acceleration in the rate of gene loss is
attributable at least in part to a genome-wide reduction in
purifying selection. This study demonstrates that purifying
selection acts with different effectiveness in different facultative pathogens and that this difference affects the rate of gene
loss.

organism. If in a certain bacterium the best hit was conserved
across less than 40% of the E. coli K12 gene sequence, the
gene was marked as absent from that genome. If the best hit
was conserved across 40% or more of the E. coli K12 gene
sequence, the sequence corresponding to the E. coli K12 full
length gene was extracted from the bacterium genomic
sequence and translated. The translated sequence was then
examined for the presence of stop codons. If a stop codon
appeared in the sequence so that the final length of the translated protein was less than 80% of the E. coli K12 protein, the
gene was marked as absent from the genome. Genes for which
this was not the case were compared at the protein level to the
E. coli K12 corresponding protein sequences. If the best hit of
this comparison was conserved across less than 80% of the E.
coli K12 protein sequence, the gene was marked as absent
from the genome. Otherwise the gene was marked as present.
It is important to note that the examined strains are all clones
of E. coli and are thus extremely closely related to E. coli K12.
Thus, the sequences of orthologous genes in these strains are
highly similar. This makes the determination of a gene's
absence much more straight forward than for more distantly
related organisms.

Conclusion

comment

In this study we looked at two groups of very closely related
pathogens that are, in fact, all clones of E. coli. Even among
these two close groups we found significant differences in the
rate of gene loss that correlate with differences in population
structure, lifestyle and niche. It would be interesting to examine additional groups of pathogens to see whether there is a
gradient in the rate of gene loss that correlates with pathogenic lifestyle. This should fine-tune and quantify the claim
that pathogens lose genes at higher rates than free-living
organisms and may shed additional light on the forces that
determine the rates of gene loss and on its effect on
pathogenicity.

the E. coli K12 sequence in all of these organisms. From these
genes, we selected at random 100 genes. We concatenated the
sequences of these genes and aligned them using the slow and
accurate version of the ClustalW algorithm. We created 100
bootstrapping datasets from these alignments using the
Phylip package Seqboot program [30]. These datasets were
then used to construct 100 trees using the Phylip DNAml program [30], with S. typhimurium serving as an outgroup. The
trees were then consolidated using the Phylip Consense program [30]. The tree representing the phylogeny of the prpB
gene in the E. coli strains (Figure 4) was inferred using the
same programs. In order to estimate the significance of the
differences between trees we used the Shimodaira-Hasegawa
test [20,31] as implemented in Tree-puzzle 5.2 [32].

Calculating the average dN and dS along each branch
of the tree
The sequences of each of the 1,214 genes in our dataset that
are present in all the pathogenic E. coli and Shigella strains as
well as in S. typhimurium were aligned separately using the
slow and accurate version of the ClustalW algorithm. We ran
the PAML Codeml program [18] on these alignments using
the free-ratio model in order to estimate the rate of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) mutations, for each
gene, along each branch of the tree. Average dS and dN values
were then calculated for each branch of the tree.

(D(y; dS, dN) = -2log P(Y|dS, dN) for the extended model).
Under the null hypothesis that dN does not capture more
information about Y beyond dS, the likelihood ratio (or equivalently the reduction in deviance) follows a χ2 with df = 1.

We modeled the number of genes lost along a branch as a
Poisson random variable, whose mean parameter may
depend on dN, dS and whether the branch leads to E. coli or
Shigella strains. We examined various hypotheses using Poisson regression models, which were fitted using the glm function in R. The two types of branches are coded by an indicator
variable that is zero if the branch leads towards an E. coli
strain and is one if the branch leads towards a Shigella strain.

To test whether gene loss occurs at different rates along the
two types of branches adjusting for dS, we fitted the model:
E(Y) = f(β0 + β1dS + β2Ishigella)

where Y denotes the number of genes lost, f is the Poisson link
function [33], and IShigella is a binary indicator variable denoting whether the branch leads to an E. coli strain (IShigella = 0)
or to a Shigella strain (IShigella = 1). The one branch that leads
to mixed strains was omitted from all analyses. Testing
whether gene loss occurs at different rates along the two types
of branches amounts to testing the null hypothesis β2 = 0.
To test whether dN adds information about gene loss beyond
dS, we computed the likelihood ratio statistic for two nested
Poisson regression models. The null model is similar to equation 1 except that we adjusted for dS alone, while the extended
alternative model adjusts for both dS and dN. The log-likelihood of Y given dS (dS and dN for the extended model) can be
