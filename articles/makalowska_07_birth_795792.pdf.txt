Abstract
Background: Between five and fourteen per cent of genes in the vertebrate genomes do overlap
sharing some intronic and/or exonic sequence. It was observed that majority of these overlaps are
not conserved among vertebrate lineages. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to
explain gene overlap origination the evolutionary basis of these phenomenon are still not well
understood. Here, we present results of the comparative analysis of several vertebrate genomes.
The purpose of this study was to examine overlapping genes in the context of their evolution and
mechanisms leading to their origin.
Results: Based on the presence and arrangement of human overlapping genes orthologs in rodent
and fish genomes we developed 15 theoretical scenarios of overlapping genes evolution. Analysis
of these theoretical scenarios and close examination of genomic sequences revealed new
mechanisms leading to the overlaps evolution and confirmed that many of the vertebrate gene
overlaps are not conserved. This study also demonstrates that repetitive elements contribute to
the overlapping genes origination and, for the first time, that evolutionary events could lead to the
loss of an ancient overlap.
Conclusion: Birth as well as most probably death of gene overlaps occurred over the entire time
of vertebrate evolution and there wasn't any rapid origin or 'big bang' in the course of overlapping
genes evolution. The major forces in the gene overlaps origination are transposition and
exaptation. Our results also imply that origin of overlapping genes is not an issue of saving space
and contracting genomes size.

Background
3.2 billion base pairs of the human genome harbor about
23,000 protein coding genes. With the average size of a
gene equal to 48 kb, they cover approximately one third
of the genome. It seems that there's enough space in the
genome for each gene to be separated by a large distance.
Yet, between five and fourteen per cent of genes in the vertebrate genomes do overlap [1]. The unexpected abun-

dance of complementary pairs of sense/antisense
transcripts poses major challenges to achieve a comprehensive understanding of a gene structure and expression
at the genomic level. Studies of individual overlapping
gene pairs in eukaryotes have shown that they regulate
gene expression by different mechanisms such as genomic
imprinting [2], RNA interference and translational regulation [3], transcriptional interference [4], alternative splic-

ing [5], and X-inactivation [6]. Many genes involved in
overlaps are known to be involved in disease development, e.g. CACP gene is responsible for camptodactylyarthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome [7] or are
responsible for some important morphological features,
e.g. SLC24A5 is partially responsible for skin coloration
[8].
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain gene
overlap origination. For instance, Keese and Gibbs [9]
suggested that overlapping genes arise as a result of overprinting – a process of generating new genes from preexisting nucleotide sequences. This process supposedly took
place after divergence of mammals from birds and overlapping genes represent young, phylogeneticaly restricted
genes encoding proteins with diverse functions, and are
therefore specialized to the present life-style of the organism in which they are found. Shintani et al. [10] suggested
that the overlap between genes ACAT2 (acetyl-Coenzyme
A acetyltransferase 2) and TCP1 (t-complex 1) arose during the transition from therapsid reptiles to mammals in
one of two ways. In one scenario, one of genes was translocated and the rearrangement has been accompanied by
the loss of a part of the 3' UTR, including the polyadenylation signal, from one gene. By chance the 3' UTR of the
new neighbor on the opposite strand contained all the signals necessary for transcription termination so that the
translocated gene could continue to function. Alternatively, the two genes become neighbors through the rearrangement but at first did not overlap. Later, one of the
genes lost its original polyadenylation signal, but was able
to use a signal that happened to be present on the noncoding strand of the other gene. The ACAT2-TCP1 overlap
evolution was placed, similarily as in Keese and Gibbs
hypothesis, after the divergence of mammals from birds.
Dahary et al. [11] place the origin of most vertebrate overlaps much earlier. They found that human antisense genes
have largely conserved linkage in torafugu which may
imply that big fraction of human overlapping genes represents vertebrates' ancestral overlaps. However, our previous study of human and mouse overlapping genes
showed that even between closely related species overlaps
are not that well conserved [12]. Out of 255 cases in
which both members of the human overlapping gene pair
had mouse orthologs, only 95 were overlapping in both
species. In addition, significant fraction of these 95 gene
pairs show different overlap patterns in the two genomes.
Lack of the overlap conservation was also observed in
other studies [13-15].
Here we present results of the comparative analysis of
seven vertebrate genomes: human, chimpanzee, mouse,
rat, chicken, fugu, and zebrafish. This comparative study
shows that on one hand, many of the vertebrate gene
overlaps are not conserved and are lineage specific. On the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/193

other hand, this work reveals new, not published before,
cases of genes overlap conservation in vertebrates. We also
show new mechanisms of overlapping genes evolution
and demonstrate, for the first time, that evolutionary
events could not only lead to the new gene overlaps origin
but also to the loss of an ancient overlap. Therefore lack of
strong overlaps conservation between even closely related
species may result from the origin of a new, lineage specific overlap as well as from the loss of overlaps in many
lineages. Findings about evolutionary changes in the gene
structure and organization are very important in our quest
toward understanding genomes and genes expression.
Changes in the gene structures may lead to modifications
in the gene expression and expression correlation between
involved genes, which may further explain some differences between species such as discrepancies in the orthologous genes expression patterns [16].

Results
Conservation of overlaps in vertebrate genomes
Fraction of the overlapping genes in various vertebrates
differs significantly (Table 1). In tetrapoda over 10% of all
genes are involved in some type of overlap, while in fish
only 5–7%. The exception is the rat genome where only
4.87% of all genes are overlapping with another gene.
However, this is most likely due to the annotation incompleteness and not a specific feature of the rat genome.
Many rat genes do not have UTRs annotated and as we
learned from this and other studies [12,17,18] the majority of gene overlaps are in the UTR regions. Incomplete
annotations are likely to be responsible for some discrepancies between human and chimpanzee and could also be
true for fish genomes. Another possibility is that many
overlaps evolved after Actinopterigii diverged from Sacropterigii and most overlaps observed in these lineages arose
independently. Differences in overlapping genes frequencies between human and other species were tested using
chi-square test (Table 1). In all cases but mouse the chisquare is higher than critical value at α = 0.0005 and
therefore differences are statistically significant. For
mouse the difference is significant at α = 0.05.

Table 2 shows results of the analysis of overlap conservation, which indicate that sets of overlapping genes differ
between species. This demonstrates that many overlaps
are species or lineage specific and only a small fraction of
them are shared among vertebrates. Although some conserved overlaps are not observed due to missing data, we
can assume that this would affect both, species specific
and conserved overlaps in similar way and therefore the
proportions and the general picture are not affected. Similar disproportion in the sense-antisense transcripts abundance was also shown by Zhang et al. [19].

* excluding nested genes
Number of genes involved in overlaps is smaller than the number of overlaps multiplied by two since some genes are involved in more than one
overlap. Multiple genes may be nested in one host gene as well as a gene may be overlapping other genes on both ends as reported previously [12].
Differences in overlapping genes frequencies between human and other species were tested using chi-square test. In all cases but mouse the chisquare is higher than critical value at α = 0.0005 and therefore differences are statistically significant. For mouse the difference is significant at α =
0.05. However, no definite conclusions can be drawn by this test results since some differences may result from the annotation problems but not
real differences in the overlapping genes fraction.

Patterns of human overlapping genes evolution
Using Ensembl gene homology data [20] we identified
homologs of human overlapping genes in other species.
Out of 2,978 human genes involved in overlaps, 264 were
human specific and had no homologs in any other analyzed genome, including chimpanzee. Interestingly, we
couldn't find a rodent homolog for about 25% of human
overlapping genes, whereas genome wide comparison
shows that 89–90% of rat genes possess a single ortholog
in the human genome [21]. Similarly, it was observed that
25% of human genes do not have torafugu orthologs [22],
while our study shows that in the case of the overlapping
genes 46.17% of human genes lack a torafugu ortholog.
These results imply that a lot of genes involved in overlaps
are young, lineage specific genes and do not have
orthologs in other lineages. This supports the 'overprinting' hypothesis but is in sharp contrast to observation
made by Dahary et al. who based on comparison of the
human and torafugu genomes concluded that most

human overlaps are ancient [11]. However, their conclusion may be an artifact of the applied method, because
they analyzed only those human genes that have identifiable orthologs in the torafugu genome.
Based on the presence or absence of an ortholog in species
representing two other lineages, i.e. rodents and fish, we
divided human overlapping genes pairs into those that
have: both orthologs in both lineages (476 pairs); both
orthologs in rodents and only one in fish (279 pairs);
both orthologs in rodents and none in fish (111 gene
pairs); an ortholog of one gene only in both lineages (466
pairs); ortholog of one gene in rodents and none in fish
(200 pairs); and no orthologs in neither lineage (92
pairs). Next, we analyzed genomic arrangement in all
cases where both orthologs of human overlapping genes
were found. According to our results we divided gene pairs
into: overlapping (if they also overlap in particular species), neighboring (if they were not overlapping but

placed one next to each other without any gene between
them), and separated (if they were on different chromosomes, contigs or were separated by other genes).
Considering previously published major events leading to
the gene overlaps; genes rearrangements or transposition,
extension of genes by adoption of signals or new exons,
and new genes origination [9,10] we developed 15 theoretical scenarios of overlapping genes evolution (Figure
1). Results from the above analysis provide support for
every theoretical pattern of overlap evolution. Presented
examples, for each scenario, were carefully examined and
confirmed by the presence of cDNA and/or EST
sequences. Also, sequence analysis was performed to
ensure the missing orthologs are truly not present in a

given species or lack of overlaps is not resulting from
annotations problem. Our requirements here were very
conservative and each gene pair where there was disagreement between species from the same lineage was removed
from studies.
Mechanisms leading to gene overlaps
Gene overlaps evolve by a variety of mechanisms and not
by a single universal mechanism. Essentially, any mechanism that gives rise to a new gene, such as gene duplication or retroposition, may result in a gene overlap.
Alternative splicing represents another major source of
proteome diversity in mammals and origination of a new
splice form may lead to a gene overlap as well.

In the analyzed data, we found cases supporting all the
proposed hypotheses of gene overlap origination, i.e.
overprinting, a gene translocation, or adoption of a new
transcription termination signal (changing a gene structure in more general terms). Among identified human
overlapping genes in 115 cases both genes involved in the
overlap did not have the ortholog in neither rodent nor
fish lineage, in 64 cases one ortholog was present in
rodents and none in fish, and only in 68 cases both
orthologs were present in rodent and fish genomes. Figure
1 shows fifteen scenarios of overlapping gene evolution.
Patterns 7, 13, and 14 (Figure 1) fit exactly the overprinting hypothesis because they show human overlaps where
one of gene is an old gene present in all vertebrates and
the second gene is a young one not present in fish nor
rodents. Dan et al. [13] showed that a recently evolved
overlap between MINK and CHRNE genes resulted from
mutations in the polyadenlylation signal and acquisition
of a new downstream signal within a neighboring locus.
Evolutionary scenarios represented by models 2–6, 8, 9,
11, and 12 (Figure 1) indicate involvement of translocation and possible signal adoption in the overlapping
genes origin.
Although our models support published hypotheses we
should consider much broader range of events which
could lead to genes overlaps. Summarizing published
hypotheses in a more general way we can say that major
events playing a role in overlapping genes evolution are:
translocation (or transposition), change in the gene structure (extension of UTR would fall into this category), and
development of a new gene or a new splice variant.
Development of a new splice variant
Gene overlaps might not be conserved among species due
to different gene structures [12]. In addition to adopting a
new termination and an extension of the last exon, conversion of the previously unused genetic material in the
form of a new splicing variant may lead to the gene overlap. There are two possible scenarios, an additional splice
variant arises or the ancestral variant may be replaced by a
new one.

Developing a new, additional, splice variant may be considered as a special case of overprinting since the new
splice variant represents a new transcript. In fact, the case
described by Keese and Gibbs [9] falls into this category
because reported the new gene is just a new splice variant
of TRalpha (TRHA) gene. Comparative analysis of the
genomic region containing TRHA and NR1D1 (nuclear
receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1) genes revealed
that the overlap is conserved among placental mammals,
who have two splice variants of TRHA. Only one of these,
the one which does not overlap with NR1D1, was identified in marsupials and all non-mammalian lineages.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/193

Close examination of the genomic region alignments
showed that an insertion of new genetic material occurred
some time after divergence of placental mammals and this
inserted sequence was used for a new splice variant. This
finding disagrees with the overprinting hypothesis as a
new variant wasn't built from old existing material but
rather new genetic information, not present in other
genomes. However, we can not exclude possibility that
this genomic fragment wasn't lost in other genomes.
The same mechanism can be attributed to the origination
of ITFG3 (integrin alpha FG-GAP repeat containing 3) and
RGS11 (regulator of G-protein signalling 11) overlap in
primates. ITFG3 has two splice variants in primates and
one of them is overlapping at 3' end with RGS11 gene. Figure 2 shows genomic organization of both genes in
human; similar organization is observed in the chimpanzee and macaque genomes. In all non-primate species
only the non-overlapping (shorter) variant is present. To
exclude the possibility that the overlapping splice variant
was missed in annotations in non primate genomes we
investigated alignments of human and other genomes in
two genomic browsers, Ensemble and UCSC browser. In
both cases there was not a good alignment in the region
occupied by the primate specific exon. Similarly, search
against GenBank databases did not reveal any similarity
between proteins encoded by the overlapping exon and
any other non primate protein, genomic or EST sequence.
This clearly shows that overlapping splice variant of gene
encoding ITFG3 is lineage specific and arose recently after
divergence of primates.
Another example of primate specific overlap that resulted
from a new splice variant is a pair of genes THAP3, THAP
domain containing, apoptosis associated protein 3, and
DNAJC11, DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily C, member
11. Both THAP3 and DNAJC11 homologs were found in

a majority of analyzed vertebrate species: human,
macaque, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum,
and zebrafish. Interestingly, the THAP3 was missing in
chicken, frog, and tetraodon. We couldn't identify the
gene in these genomes by any standard comparative
methods including BLASTn and tBLASTn. However,
zebrafish is apparently not the only fish species THAP3
gene. EST sequences DT157701, DT154094, DT175180,
DT175179, and DT157700 from Pimephales promelas
show high similarity to zebrafish THAP3 protein (64–
77% identity) and likely represent THAP3 transcript. In
primates, THAP3 has two splice variants one of which
overlaps with DNAJC11. In all other species only one,
shorter variant is present and it is not overlapping with
DNAJC11. Comparative analysis of genomic sequences in
the region of the overlap shows that there is no conservation in this region and most likely the longer variant is primate specific. We also did not identify any EST sequence
which could show the presence of longer (overlapping)
variant in non primate vertebrates. This analysis led to
conclusion that longer splice variant of THAP3 and
THAP3-DNAJC11 overlap are primate specific.
Development of a new gene
The new splice variant origination seems to be one of the
most common events leading to the lineage specific overlaps. However, our data strongly suggest that this is not
the only case where we observe 'overprinting'. The powerful evidence that origination of new lineage specific genes
plays a big role in the evolution of overlapping genes
comes from data that many human genes do not have
orthologs in other lineages. It is known that the many of
human genes are not found in rodent [21], chicken [23]
or fish [22] genomes, so our result could just reflect these
findings. Interestingly, the fraction of human genes with
missing orthologs is higher for overlapping genes than
non-overlapping genes. Approximately 10% of human
genes are missing in mouse genome while 27% of human
overlapping genes are missing in mouse. Similarly, about
20% and 24% of human genes are not found in chicken
and torafugu but this fraction is much higher in our studies: 44.9% and 46.17% in chicken and torafugu, respectively.

A confirmation for new gene origination as a source of
gene overlap comes from the case of TMEM16C, transmembrane protein 16C, and MUC15, mucin 15; located
on 11p14.2-3. Human TMEM16C has 27 exons spanning
331,865 base pairs. Two splice variants of MUC15 are
embedded in the TMEM16C gene occupying introns 13
and 14 and overlapping, in the 3'UTR area, with exon 14
(Figure 3). Gene MUC15 is present only in mammalian
genomes and there is experimental evidence that it is overlapping with TMEM16C at least in primates, rodents and
cow. This gene is not present in any other lineages includ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/193

ing chicken, xenopus and zebrafish and alignment of
genomic sequences shows no conservation in areas covered by MUC15. However alignments at the protein level
show some traces of similarity in chicken in MUC15 exon
four of splice variant 2 and in xenopus in the same exon
four in part of exon three. We could not detect any similarity in zebrafish as well as in invertebrates. The MUC15
sequence appears to be specific for vertebrates only and
there are two possible evolutionary scenarios. In one, the
sequence was present in early chordates and in the process
of neutral mutation gained the coding potential which
was used to build a new gene in mammalian ancestor.
Another possibility is that this gene, was lost in majority
of lineages with traces left in few genomes, and was maintained only in mammals. At any rate TMEM16C and
MUC15 represent an overlap between an old gene
TMEM16C and a newer mammalian specific gene
(MUC15).
Changes in the gene structure
In the cases described above the gene overlap evolved
through the origin of a new, longer splice variant. In many
instances we observed a slightly different situation, a new
variant arose and replaced the ancient one, so the number
of variants was the same in analyzed lineages; however,
they differ in their genomic organization. Examples of
ACAT2-TCP1 [10] and MINK-CHRNE [13] overlaps are
simple cases of changes in the gene structure where the
most 3' exon was extended as a result of adopting the closest polyA signal after the original one was lost.

Example of BLZF1 gene (basic leucine zipper nuclear factor 1), overlapping at 3' end with the gene C1orf114
(open reading frame 114 on human chromosome 1, position 167603818–167663296) shows a more drastic shift
in the gene structure. This overlap exists in the human and
chimpanzee genomes but the two genes are neighbors,
and do not overlap in other mammals including opossum
where they are located on chromosome 2 about 6 kb
apart. A similar arrangement is observed in chicken (chromosome 1, 2 kb separation) and in Xenopus (the same

scaffold, 9 kb separation). Interestingly, in zebrafish these
two genes are located on different chromosomes – BLZF1
on chromosome 1 and a homolog of C1orf114 most
likely is located on chromosome 8. Although there's no
gene annotated in the cognate region, both human protein similarity and zebrafish EST alignments strongly suggest existence of the C1orf114 gene in this region. Figure
4 shows genomic organization of these overlapping genes
in human and mouse. Analysis of multiple alignments of
the region containing the last exon of BLZF1 in human
and corresponding region in other vertebrates revealed
that this fragment is not conserved among vertebrate lineages. Clearly there was an insertion in an ancient primate
genome; a fragment belonging to the last, primate specific, exon does not align with non-primate genomes.
Analysis of this fragment showed that the very 3' end of
human BLZF1 is occupied by AluS, an old primate specific
retroelement. Similarly, middle part of the last BLZF1
exon in mouse, contains rodent specific element B4A.
Apparently independent insertions of repetitive elements
occurred in both, primate and rodent, genomes and both
are associated with exonification and new splice variant
development.
Gene duplication and retrotransposition
Gene duplication is a common mechanism for the origin
of new genes [24,25]. Retrotransposition is an interesting
mechanism that allows a gene to move to a distant location on the same or different chromosome.
Retro(pseudo)genes are products of reverse transcription
of a spliced (mature) mRNA and they are characterized by
lack of introns, presence of polyA track, and flanking
direct repeats. Because they are copies of mature mRNAs,
they usually lack promoters and cannot be transcribed.
However, in some rare instances, after insertion near an
existing promoter or exaptation of anonymous sequence

as a promoter, they can gain transcriptional activity and
create a new functional gene [24,26].
An example of a new gene overlap due to formation of a
new gene origination comes from the ribosomal protein
RPS27 retrogene and TSPAN9 (tetraspanin 9, known also
as NET-5) gene. RPS27 has two intron-containing paralogs: RPS27 and RPS27L, and both of them gave rise to
multiple retrocopies in the human genome. We identified
24 retro(pseudo)genes of RPS27; ten of them are nested in
another gene. Although multiple RPS27 retrogenes can be
identified in other mammalian genomes, none of the
host-nested gene pairs are the same in the human and
rodent genomes. The aforementioned retrocopy of RPS27,
nested in the human tetraspanin 9 gene, has an intact
open reading frame and potentially encodes for 84 amino
acid protein 100% identical to the spliced version of the
gene on chromosome 1. We also identified two EST
sequences, AV763564 and CD386048 that are 99% identical to this gene and show weaker similarity to other
RPS27 genes, which may imply that this gene is expressed.
However, because of relatively low quality of EST
sequences, these results are not conclusive and further
analysis would be required to confirm expression of this
gene. This retrosequence is present in the human and
chimp genomes but missing from orthologous location in
macaque and all other vertebrates that we analyzed. This
confirms recent origin of the RPS27 retrosequence and
makes its expression assessment based on an intact ORF
impossible. However, this example demonstrates a potential route to new overlaps in the vertebrate genomes.
Loss of gene overlaps
While young gene overlaps can arise from new splice variants, ancient overlaps can disappear due to the loss of the
overlapping splice variant. In fact, we did observe such
cases in our dataset that showed that analysis of narrow
range of vertebrate or mammalian lineages may lead to
false conclusions due to incompleteness of the data. The
human NDEL1 gene coding for a thiol-activated peptidase
and MYH10 gene that codes for myosin heavy chain 10
reside on chromosome 17 and they overlap in primates
but not in rodents, chicken or fish. In primates there are
three splice variants of NDEL1 and only one is overlapping with MYH10. In mouse and rat only two non overlapping transcripts are present, and in chicken we observe
only one variant. The same variant as in chicken is present
in zebrafish, however NDEL1 and MYH10 genes are separated. In addition, in zebrafish NDEL1 has two copies representing the same splice variant, one located at
chromosome 12, position 35 35,318,946–35,338,461
and another located at chromosome 3 at position
56,442,046–56,469,437. MYH10 in zebrafish is on chromosome 6, position 5,082,544–5,106,092. Based on
these observations the most parsimonious explanation

would be that one of these genes was translocated after
fish divergence and later on the overlapping splice variant
arose in primates. However, when we looked at the
genomic arrangement of these genes in other species we
observed that the dog genome has all three primate's
splice variants. Further analysis showed that Xenopus has
even more, four splice variants, two of them confirmed by
cDNA and EST sequences and two predicted. One of the
predicted variants is overlapping with MYH10 and protein coded by this variant shows high similarity to protein
encoded by overlapping transcript observed in primates
and in dog. Analysis of all known vertebrate transcripts
and proteins encoded by them suggests that in a tetrapoda
ancestor genome there were at least three splice variants of
NDEL1. During the evolution one or two of them were
lost in most lineages. Only primates retained three variants and all of them are confirmed by EST or cDNA
sequences. In dog and Xenopus overlapping variant was
predicted but it is shorter than the one in primates and up
to date there is no experimental confirmation for its
expression. However, the analysis of proteins coded by
these variants (Figure 5) clearly shows that the overlapping splice variant in Xenopus is the same as the one in
dogs and primates. In zebrafish both copies of NDEL1
represent variant 1 that seems to be the most common in
vertebrate genomes. Variants of NDEL1 most probably
evolved at early chordates because only one is present in
Ciona intestinalis. Sequence divergence did not allow us to
establish which, if any, of three variants is shared with
Ciona intestinalis. Figure 6 shows the phylogenetic tree
with all analyzed species. Bars to the right represent splice
variants of NDEL1. The most likely mechanism of the variant loss in some lineages is a weakening of the splicing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/193

signal that leads to skipping of an exon. Similar effect can
be observed in case when the other exon acquires signal so
strong that dominates completely splicing and results in a
constitutive exon. Another possibility is that this transcript is using signals from L1 elements which are in its 3'
UTR. [27] These elements are in human sequence but are
partially or completely lost in other genomes. However,
more extensive analyses that would include some wet lab
experiments are required in order to determine what the
case is here.
Time of overlapping genes evolution
Equally important, to the mechanism leading to overlaps,
is the time when particular event occurred. Two widely
accepted hypotheses of vertebrate overlapping genes evolution [9,10] assume that explosion of gene overlaps
occurred in early mammals. On the contrary, Dahary et al.
[11] and Zhang et al. [19] suggested that most naturally
occurring anti-transcripts observed in human represent
ancient vertebrate gene overlaps. To answer this question,
we looked for evidence of putative gene overlap before
and after mammalian radiation. We studied cases where
the pattern of gene arrangement differs in fish and rodent,
i.e. two genes overlap in rodents but not in fish. As shown
in Figure 7, genes arrangement in the chicken genome in
some cases is similar to the one in rodents in other to the
one in fish. For example genes CIO32 and ASB6 overlap
in mammals only but genes RNF123 and GNPPB overlap
also in chicken. In another example gene pair UBAP1 and
KIF24 is overlapping in human but not overlapping,
although located next to each other, in rodents and
chicken. Only one of these genes, UBAP1 is present in
fish. On the other hand, genes RFESD and SPATA9 over-

lap in human but not in rodents where they are located
next to each other. In chicken, as well as in fish gene
SPATA9 is not found. This demonstrates that the events
leading to gene overlaps happened before and after mammalian radiation. The development of gene overlaps is a
long, continuous process, not a 'big bang' that happened
during a specific short period of vertebrate evolution. Also
examples discussed in previous sections showed that gene
overlaps were evolving at different stages of vertebrate
evolution and could arise in early chordates, early mammals, or just recently in primates and other mammalian
lineages.

Discussion
Although large scale studies of overlapping genes have
been available since 2002 we still do not understand how
these overlaps evolved and what, if any, is the functional

meaning of sharing the genomic locus between genes in
eukaryotic genomes. Results published so far show evidence for both, relatively new, lineage specific [9,10,13] as
well as conserved overlaps among vertebrate [11,19] and
even all eukaryotes [28] gene overlaps. However, none of
the papers, even those with gene overlaps origin hypotheses, fully explains this evolutionary phenomenon. This
study brings us a little closer to that goal and the major
conclusion is that there's no single mechanism responsible for the overlap origination. In principle, any mechanism of a new exon or a new gene origination may lead to
a gene overlap. In the light of presented results, we can
conclude that the major forces in the overlapping genes
evolution are transposition and exaptation – a process
that gives rise to new genes or new variants from preexisting nucleotide sequences. [29]. UTR extension in the
course of new polyA signal adoption [10,13] or new splice

variant development [9] are perfect examples of exaptation. Another type of exaptation is building a new gene
structure by adopting an inserted transposable element.
Transposable elements are known to contribute to host
gene regulation [30,31] or structure [32,33]. Our study on
BLZF1 and C1orf114 showed that transposable elements
also contribute to origin of a new class of genetic novelties, namely overlapping genes. The analyzed data also
provided evidence that new gene origination is truly

observed in the process of overlaps evolution supporting
even further hypothesis by Keese and Gibbs [9]. 'Overprinting' hypothesis was constructed based on the new
splice variant origination. Overlap between TMEM16C
and mammalian specific gene MUC15 showed that overlaps may involve pairs of an old ancient gene and a new
lineage specific gene. However, we cannot agree that this
is true for all vertebrate overlaps as hypothesized. In many

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:193

of analyzed gene pairs both genes were old and conserved
through eukaryotes.
Nevertheless, our study shows a number of gene overlaps
that are lineage specific and are not conserved among vertebrates which supports our earlier studies of overlaps in
human and mouse [12]. This is in a contradiction with the
study of Dahary et al. [11] on human and fugu genomes
that concludes that most human overlaps are ancient.
However, they analyzed only those human genes that
have identifiable orthologs in the fugu genome and therefore, young overlaps involving lineage specific genes were
excluded from the study by definition. Also, their judgment was based on cases of overlapping human genes that
were on average closer to each other in the fugu genome
then other genes, and not based on true conserved overlaps. So, some of the gene pairs in fugu although close one
to each other, are not necessary overlapping as is clear
from our analysis.
In summary, we should emphasize that overlapping genes
do not present any special case in regard to mechanisms
of evolution. Events like gene translocation or exaptation,
driving forces in genome evolution, are also common and
major mechanisms in gene overlaps origin. There wasn't
also any rapid origin or a 'big bang' of the overlapping
genes after the split of bird and mammal lineages as suggested by Keese and Gibbs [9], nor are most of the human
overlaps ancient as described by Dahary et al [11]. Birth as
well as most likely death of gene overlaps is a continue
process that occurred over the entire time of vertebrate
evolution, similarly like any other genes arose or die over
a long process of the eukaryotic genomes evolution [34].
Our results also imply that origin of overlapping genes is
not an issue of saving space and contracting genomes size.
Although there are some implications on functional
importance of overlapping genes, the present analysis
shows that most gene overlaps evolve stochastically, the
same way as other genomic features, and without any positive pressure on the overlap presence. If overlaps have
some functional meaning it is not a common case and
most likely this function evolved by chance as a consequence of new genes arrangement.
This study also demonstrates that in order to fully understand the evolution of overlapping genes one has to study
many genomes in minute details. Studies on a limited
number of species may lead to false conclusions as shown
in the case of NDEL1 and in many other cases we investigated during this study. Many gene pairs were moved
from one category to another as a result of detailed examination of annotations and additional analysis. This
shows that although human and other genomes are considered to be complete, their annotation is still far from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/193

final and in many cases cannot be trusted. Therefore, careful examination of any gene pair by a human expert followed by, in an ideal world, some wet-lab experiments is
a key to sound results. We are very well aware that the
present study did not solve all the questions regarding
overlapping genes evolution and their origins. However, it
did shed a light on how some of these overlaps evolved,
provided a strong confirmation for lineage specific overlaps, and delivered firsthand evidence of gene overlap loss
in the vertebrate lineage.

Methods
Sequence data
Assembled sequences and annotations of seven analyzed
genomes were downloaded from Ensembl [20] and stored
in a local mySQL database. We used following versions of
the genomes: human-24.34e (NCBI 34), chimp-24.1
(CHIMP 1), mouse-24.33 (NCBI m33), rat-24.3c (RGSC
3.1), chicken-24.1a (WASHUC 1), fugu-24.2c (FUGU
2.0), and zebrafish-24.4 (Zv 4).
Identification of the overlapping genes
For practical reasons, we applied an operational definition of a gene, as a part of the genomic region from the
beginning to the end of an annotated transcript. Any two
genes, defined as above, whose coordinates overlap and
are transcribed from the different DNA strand, are considered as overlapping.
Identification of orthologous genes and mapping
information
Orthology inference was done based on any two genomes
homology information provided in Ensembl. The set of
overlapping genes for a given species was always a starting
point for each orthology analysis. As a result seven by
seven orthology matrix was created. It is important to
stress that orthology relationship provided by Ensembl is
not a simple one-to-one relationship. Whenever lineage
specific gene duplication is detected one-to-many
orthologs are provided. In these cases, each of several
orthologs was checked for the overlaps. The detailed
description of the method is available at Ensembl webpage [35]. Additionally, we used conserved synteny information of the neighboring genes to enhance reliability of
the orthology inference. However, not all the genes have
had their orthologs listed. In these cases, we assumed that
a cognate gene is missing from a given genome.

The mapping information of each orthologous gene was
downloaded from the Ensemble. For each pair of overlapping genes in one genome, e.g. human, spatial relationship of their orthologs in the other six genomes was
checked based on existing annotation.

Extending neighboring but not overlapping genes
We mapped TIGR gene indices [36] to all neighboring but
not overlapping orthologs of human overlapping genes to
check for possible extensions. In each case, we extracted
genomic fragments containing a pair of neighboring
genes and BLAST [37] against corresponding TGI
sequences. Next we mapped transcripts to genomic fragments together with TGI sequences obtained from BLAST
search. Only sequences showing similarity over 98% and
fully aligning with the genomic fragment were used in
order to avoid false positive hits to repetitive elements and
ESTs from related genes. Results were stored in ASN.1 format and examined in Sequin [38].
Multiple alignments
MultiZ alignments of genomic sequences were obtained
from UCSC genome browser [39]. Protein multiple alignments were constructed using Clustalw [40].
