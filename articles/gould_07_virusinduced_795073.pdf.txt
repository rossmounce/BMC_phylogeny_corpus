Abstract
Background: The lower eudicot genus Aquilegia, commonly known as columbine, is currently the
subject of extensive genetic and genomic research aimed at developing this taxon as a new model
for the study of ecology and evolution. The ability to perform functional genetic analyses is a critical
component of this development process and ultimately has the potential to provide insight into the
genetic basis for the evolution of a wide array of traits that differentiate flowering plants. Aquilegia
is of particular interest due to both its recent evolutionary history, which involves a rapid adaptive
radiation, and its intermediate phylogenetic position between core eudicot (e.g., Arabidopsis) and
grass (e.g., Oryza) model species.
Results: Here we demonstrate the effective use of a reverse genetic technique, virus-induced gene
silencing (VIGS), to study gene function in this emerging model plant. Using Agrobacterium mediated
transfer of tobacco rattle virus (TRV) based vectors, we induce silencing of PHYTOENE
DESATURASE (AqPDS) in Aquilegia vulgaris seedlings, and ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE (AqANS) and
the B-class floral organ identity gene PISTILLATA in A. vulgaris flowers. For all of these genes, silencing
phenotypes are associated with consistent reduction in endogenous transcript levels. In addition,
we show that silencing of AqANS has no effect on overall floral morphology and is therefore a
suitable marker for the identification of silenced flowers in dual-locus silencing experiments.
Conclusion: Our results show that TRV-VIGS in Aquilegia vulgaris allows data to be rapidly
obtained and can be reproduced with effective survival and silencing rates. Furthermore, this
method can successfully be used to evaluate the function of early-acting developmental genes. In
the future, data derived from VIGS analyses will be combined with large-scale sequencing and
microarray experiments already underway in order to address both recent and ancient
evolutionary questions.

Background
The genus Aquilegia is comprised of approximately 70 species distributed across temperate areas of North America,
Europe, and Asia, with several ornamental varieties sold
commercially [1]. These species have undergone a very
recent and rapid adaptive radiation in response to biotic

and abiotic factors, resulting in low sequence variation
among species [2-4]. Thus, they are ideal for evolutionary
studies in that they display a wide range of ecological and
morphological diversity but retain high levels of crosscompatibility between species, allowing for genetic dissection of traits [5]. Aquilegia possesses a small diploid

genome (n = 7, 1C = 320–400 Mbp, S. Hodges, pers.
comm.), is self-fertile and reproduces regularly with high
fecundity. In addition, Aquilegia occupies an intermediate
phylogenetic position between core eudicot (e.g., Arabidopsis) and grass (e.g., Oryza) model species. Thus functional genetic analyses of physiological and
morphological adaptation in Aquilegia will be valuable in
making evolutionary comparisons across divergent
angiosperms. Many resources already exist to facilitate
research in this genus, including genetic maps of several
major quantitative trait loci [5], a fingerprinted BAC
library [6], and an annotated expressed sequence tag
(EST) database [7]. Most significantly, sequencing of the
entire Aquilegia genome will commence at the Joint
Genome Institute in 2007 [8]. To add to this growing
body of research, here we demonstrate effective use of a
rapid reverse genetic technique, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), in this emerging model plant.
VIGS is a method that utilizes the RNAi pathway in plants
to induce transient gene knock-down [9]. This process
begins with the Agrobacterium-mediated introduction of
modified virus-based cDNA constructs that also contain
fragments of endogenous gene sequences. Once expressed
in vivo, dsRNAs are generated from an encoded viral
polymerase as the virus replicates and spreads through the
plant (reviewed [10]). These dsRNAs are then targeted by
DICER-like enzymes and degraded into siRNA. In turn,
the siRNA molecules provide a template for degradation
of complimentary RNAs, including complimentary
endogenous mRNAs, by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Silencing persists until proliferation of viral
RNAs is overcome by the silencing response.
Induction of VIGS is a useful alternative to the often difficult and laborious process of generating stably transformed plants, and offers the ability to overcome
functional redundancy by suppressing all or most members of a gene family [11]. VIGS vectors have been developed from viral systems that affect many plant hosts
including many dicots (reviewed [10-12]) and several
monocots (barley [13] and wheat [14]). Here we demonstrate VIGS in the species Aquilegia vulgaris using vectors
based on the bipartite genome of the tobacco rattle virus
(TRV) (reviewed [9]). This system uses two vectors,
derived from binary transformation plasmids, which have
cDNAs encoding the TRV RNA1 (TRV1) and TRV RNA2
(TRV2) inserted into the T-DNA region [15]. Both vectors
contain a duplicated 35S promoter and a self-cleaving
ribozyme sequence to enable rapid generation of intact
viral transcripts (Figure 1). Genes essential for plant to
plant transmission of TRV through its nematode vector
[16] have been deleted from TRV2 [15]. The TRV system
has the advantage of being able to penetrate meristematic
cells [11] and overall causes mild viral symptoms in a

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/3/1/6

wide range of susceptible hosts [17]. Although TRV-VIGS
has primarily been used in the Solanaceae (tobacco [18]),
it has also been successfully applied in Arabidopsis [19]
and the lower eudicot Papaver (poppy [20]).
Here we have successfully produced TRV-VIGS of two phenotypic marker genes in Aquilegia: PHYTOENE DESATURASE (AqPDS) and ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE
(AqANS). Silencing of AqPDS results in decreased production of photoprotective carotenoid proteins and the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll pigments [21,22]. This
is easily detectable as a photobleaching phenotype in
chlorophyll-containing tissues. Silencing of AqANS
reduces conversion of colorless leucoanthocyanidins to
colored anthocyanidin [23] inhibiting development of
the purple wild-type flower color. We have compared
AqPDS silencing at two different developmental stages,
using RT-PCR to detect viral transcripts in silenced plants
and the simultaneous decrease in the relative expression
level of endogenous AqPDS transcript. Similarly we have
measured endogenous AqANS levels in silenced and unsilenced Aquilegia flowers. Finally, we have used TRV-VIGS
to simultaneously knock-down AqANS and a non-marker
locus, the floral developmental gene PISTILLATA [24,25],
in order to generate a homeotic floral phenotype. This
study demonstrates that VIGS will be a useful tool for analyzing a wide range of gene function in Aquilegia that can
now be combined with other genetic tools for functional
studies in this genus.

Results and Discussion
TRV-AqPDS-VIGS treatment of Aquilegia vulgaris
seedlings
In order to test the ability of TRV-based VIGS to promote
gene silencing in Aquilegia, we prepared a TRV2 construct
[9] containing a 441 bp fragment of AqPDS (Figure 1a).
This fragment was initially isolated from A. vulgaris cDNA
using degenerate primers and then re-amplified using
locus-specific primers for insertion into the TRV2 plasmid. As discussed above, VIGS-induced silencing of the
endogenous AqPDS locus should result in an easily recognizable photobleached phenotype. Although we tested
several methods for introducing the TRV1/2 plasmids,
including direct injection of roots and vegetative parts
(data not shown), only vacuum infiltration of seedlings
yielded strong and consistent silencing of AqPDS. Thus far
we have been successful in inducing TRV-VIGS in three
species, A. vulgaris,A. caerulea, and A. alpina, but for this
study we focused on A. vulgaris. TRV-VIGS treatment was
carried out on seedlings in two developmental stages:
those with 1–2 true leaves and those with 3–5 true leaves.
Cotyledon-stage seedlings were not used because initial
trials showed high rates of mortality. Groups of seedlings
were treated with the TRV1 and TRV2-AqPDS constructs or
with TRV1 and TRV2 (unmodified) as controls (Figure

1b). Four independent trials were performed for each
treatment.
Among 406 A. vulgaris seedlings treated with the AqPDS
silencing construct, survival rates were higher when plants
were treated at the 3–5 true leaf stage (64% survival) versus the 1–2 leaf stage (49% survival). Survival rates among
229 mock treated control plants were comparable to
experimentally treated ones in both groups (Table 1). In
terms of silencing response, a slightly higher frequency of
the VIGS phenotype was observed in the 1–2 leaf seedling

group (11.9% of treated plants) versus the 3–5 leaf group
(9.6%). No photobleaching was observed in the mock
treated control group (Table 1). Of the seedlings that
exhibited the photobleached VIGS phenotype, the extent
of silencing ranged from mild to strong, from leaves displaying a partial mosaic to those that were completely
white (Figure 2a). Many of the plants showing the strongest response exhibited persistent photobleaching of newly
arising leaves for up to four months (Figure 2b, c). These
plants did not maintain silencing through vernalization
treatment, however (data not shown).

In order to confirm that observed photobleaching was
due to infection with TRV1 and TRV2 as well as silencing
of the endogenous AqPDS locus, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR on all treatment groups, comparing
bleached and unbleached individuals (Figure 3 and Table
2). The presence of both TRV RNAs was detected in 100%
of sampled plants exhibiting a bleached phenotype and in
0% of untreated plants. Among sampled plants that were
treated with the silencing construct but that did not
exhibit a bleached phenotype, 96% showed no presence
of either TRV1 or TRV2. One plant in this group was positive for both RNAs indicating that infection had occurred
but did not produce silencing. In the mock treated control
group, 69% of plants showed no presence of either TRV1
or TRV2, and 31% showed the presence of both, which is
indicative of the approximate overall rate of uptake of
these constructs in A. vulgaris seedlings. We did not detect
only one of the viral RNAs in any of the samples.

3–4 months post-treatment with TRV2-AqPDS. Weakly photobleached leaves represent the first leaves that arose after
treatment. These leaves were maintained by the plant while
later arising leaves, which showed strong photobleaching,
senesced and were subsequently removed. The most recent
leaves, still exhibiting strong photobleaching, are present.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR supported the conclusion that
the observed photobleached phenotype was caused by a
reduction in the levels of endogenous AqPDS transcripts.
Lower relative levels of expression were detected in photobleached plants compared with both untreated plants
and mock treated plants from both seedling stages. In the
3–5 leaf seedling group, we detected an average 2.0 fold
reduction in AqPDS levels between TRV-VIGS treated
bleached seedlings and untreated seedlings. This difference was not statistically significant due to the high levels
of variation in the degree of photobleaching. Reduction of
AqPDS transcript levels in the 3–5 leaf group ranged from
no detectable reduction up to a 15-fold decrease in expression as compared with the average AqPDS level in
untreated seedlings. In the 1–2 leaf developmental stage
group there was an average 2.7 fold reduction in the
AqPDS level (Figure 4), which was much more consistent
and highly significant at p < 0.0005.
TRV-AqANS-VIGS treatment of adult Aquilegia vulgaris
plants
In order to test if VIGS can be used to create silencing phenotypes in Aquilegia flowers, we targeted the ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE (AqANS) gene in post-vernalization
(cold treated) plants. AqANS appears to be a single copy
locus in Aquilegia (S. Hodges, pers. comm., [26]). The
AqANS sequence was obtained from the recently compiled Aquilegia EST database and used to amplify and
clone a 440 bp fragment into the TRV2 vector (see Experimental Procedures). Adult plants with 15 or more leaves
were vernalized for 8 weeks at 4°C to induce flowering.
Two weeks after transfer to the greenhouse at 20°C, we
wounded each plant at the basal rosette and injected the
mix of Agrobacterium solutions into the wound with a needle-less syringe at weekly intervals. We also tested floral
dip-based methods [27] and vacuum infiltration of inflorescences, but, unlike the experiments with the seedlings,
we had more consistent success with the injection method
(data not shown). Two separate groups of plants were
treated with the injection technique for a total of 48 plants
treated with TRV1/TRV2-AqANS, 6 control plants treated
with TRV1/TRV2 (unmodified), and 4 plants left
untreated. Survival rates were 100% for both TRV treatment groups (one untreated plant expired of natural
causes during the experiment) and there were only occa-

sional instances of early floral senescence as a result of the
treatment. About 3–4 weeks after treatment, depending
on the speed of the onset of flowering, we observed a
range of floral silencing phenotypes (Figure 5) in 12.5%
of plants. In these plants, the number of AqANS-silenced
flowers per plant varied from as few as two to as many as
ten.
As with the AqPDS analysis, we collected tissue from a
range of treatments and silencing phenotypes in the
TRV2-AqANS silencing group. We conducted RT-PCR
analysis to determine the levels of endogenous AqANS
transcripts in the tissue and tested for the presence of

TRV1 and TRV2. We found that AqANS transcript levels in
white flowers were significantly reduced (p < 0.0005) an
average of 4.1 fold, with some flowers showing up to an
8.3 fold reduction. AqANS levels in mock treated and
treated but unsilenced flowers were both comparable to
levels in untreated flowers (Figures 6 and 7).
We did not detect TRV1 or TRV2 transcripts in any
untreated plants. We also did not detect any of these RNAs
in a sample of 6 mock treated plants. This is likely due to
the relatively low infection rate of the TRV2 and TRV1
constructs in adult plants. However, we did detect TRV1
and TRV2-AqANS transcripts in 78% of bleached tissue

of overall shape and size. Moreover, no variation from
wildtype was observed at the cell level (Figure 8), suggesting that AqANS is a useful marker for dual-locus floral
silencing experiments.

samples and we detected TRV1 in one treated unsilenced
sample (Table 3, Figure 6). The lack of detection of viral
transcripts in some of the silenced tissue samples likely
indicates the persistence of AqANS-silencing even after
TRV expression has been repressed. AqANS-silenced tissue
was collected primarily from fully mature flowers, typically two or more weeks following their first injection, and
hence some samples may have been collected after TRV
had been suppressed to undetectable levels by the silencing response. Overall, the data supports the conclusion
that the white floral phenotype was caused by introduction of the TRV1/TRV2-AqANS constructs during floral
development.
In several other taxa, loci in the anthocyanin synthesis
pathway have been used as markers for silenced tissue in
dual-locus silencing experiments (e.g., [28]). One important criterion for such a marker is that it does not have any
effect on other aspects of floral development. AqANS is a
good candidate in this context since it functions at a late
stage in anthocyanin production and, in comparative
studies, was frequently found to be down regulated in naturally white flowered species [26]. This may correlate with
a lower degree of functional pleiotropy for the locus. We,
therefore, carefully examined the morphology of AqANSsilenced flowers in order to assess the suitability of the
gene as a marker for floral silencing. All floral organ types
developed normally in AqANS-silenced flowers in terms

Dual TRV-AqANS-AqPI-VIGS treatment of adult
Aquilegia vulgaris plants
For TRV-VIGS to be a truly useful tool for functional analyses in Aquilegia, it not only has to be able to knock-down
marker genes such as AqANS but also reduce specific gene
transcript levels with the efficiency and correct timing
required to generate discernable mutant developmental
phenotypes. It would also be preferable if the method
were able to simultaneously silence both a marker gene
and an unrelated gene of interest. In order to test these
abilities of the TRV-VIGS system in Aquilegia, we treated a
group of 15 plants with TRV1 and a TRV2-AqPI-AqANS
construct (Figure 1). This TRV2 construct is designed to
silence both AqANS and Aquilegia PISTILLATA (AqPI), a
MADS box gene normally involved in petal and stamen
development [24,25]. Typical loss-of-function phenotypes for PI homologs include the homeotic transformation of petals into sepals and stamens into carpels
[25,29,30]. In Aquilegia, there is an additional organ that
may fall under the control of AqPI function, the novel
staminodium, which is positioned between the stamens
and carpels and represents a distinct fifth organ type
[31,32]. Dual silencing of AqANS and AqPI was successful
as demonstrated though both RT-PCR and homeotic floral phenotypes (Figures 9 and 10). Flowers showing white
sectors also exhibited coordinated transformation of petals to sepals and both stamens and staminodia to carpels
(Figure 9). This experiment shows that TRV-VIGS can be
used in Aquilegia to produce novel gene silencing phenotypes, even in loci that act early in meristem development.

Conclusion
Establishment of a new model species requires the development of a diverse array of genetic and genomic tools.
One critical component in this set of tools is the capacity
to perform targeted analyses of gene function. While we
are also pursuing the development of stable transformation techniques, the VIGS approach described here has a
number of advantages. Among these are the abilities to
target specific loci, obtain data with rapid turn around,
and potentially knock-down multiple targets that are
members of a gene family. In this study, we have demonstrated that TRV-VIGS is an effective tool for silencing gene
expression in A. vulgaris. To achieve silencing in seedlings,
vacuum infiltration with Agrobacterium appears to be the
most effective approach with 1–2 leaf seedlings showing
the strongest response. In addition, it appears that VIGS is
suitable for multiple species of Aquilegia, perhaps not surprising given its recent radiation [2-4], and can be applied
at several different stages of plant development, although

AqANS (useful for rapid identification of plants with the
strongest levels of silencing) and an unrelated gene of
interest can be silenced simultaneously in order to investigate developmental function. The addition of VIGS to
our growing set of resources for Aquilegia will further
advance its rise as an important new model system for the
study of evolutionary and ecological questions.

Generation of VIGS TRV2-AqPDS and TRV2-AqANS
constructs
Total RNA was extracted from Aquilegia vulgaris leaf tissue
using Plant RNA Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and mRNA was purified using Magnetite Oligo (dT)
Particles (Novagen (EMD), San Diego, CA). cDNA was
generated from 500 ng of mRNA using Superscript II
Reverse Transcriptase™ (Invitrogen). The AqPDS sequence
was isolated through PCR using degenerate primers from
conserved regions of the PDS gene (PDS-F: 5'-TGGAARGARCAYTCIATGATWTTTGCWATG-3' and PDS-R: 5'ACRACATGRTACTTIAVDATYTTWGCTTT-3', Figure 1).
The primary AqPDS fragment was then sequenced to confirm its identity [DQ923721] using BigDye Terminator®
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and re-amplified
using locus-specific primers with appended restriction
sites (PDS-F2-XbaI: 5'-GGTCTAGACAGCCGATTTGATTTCCCAGAT-3' and PDS-R3-BamH1: 5'-AAGGATCCGAGAATTGAGTCGGACTTCACC-3', Figure 1). The AqANS
sequence was obtained from the Aquilegia EST database
[DR946275 and DR946276], and primers were designed
to amplify a 440 bp fragment of the gene (ANS-F-Xba1: 5'GGTCTAGATTGGGATTGGAAGAAGAAAGGC-3'
and
ANS-R-BamH1:
5'-AAGGATCCATGTTGAGCAAATGTGCGA-3', Figure 1).

Both gene products were double digested with XbaI and
BamH1, as was the TRV2 vector, and ligated separately
using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA). The resulting constructs were transformed into heatshock competent E.coli (TOP10 cells, Invitrogen) and
plated on selective LB media containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Colonies were PCR screened for the presence of
the modified constructs using primers 156 F (5'-TTACTCAAGGAAGCACGATGAGC-3') and 156 R (5'-GAACCGTAGTTTAATGTCTTCGGG-3'), which span the multiple
cloning site in TRV2. Both constructs were then purified
(Fast-Plasmid Mini kit, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany)
and the identity of the final constructs was verified by
sequencing with the 156 F and 156 R primers and BigDye
Terminator®

soil and then stratified at 4°C for at least 3 weeks show the
best germination rates. Seeds germinate approximately 10
days after being removed from stratification. More mature
seed, stored for 6–8 months at 4°C, had higher germination rates than fresh seed or seed stored for 1–2 months.
Treatment of seed with gibberellic acid (GA) at varied concentrations did not improve germination of either fresh or
aged seed, however it has been previously reported that
seed stored at 20°C may have overall higher germination
rates and benefit from GA treatment [33]. Similar rates of
germination were observed for seeds planted in all-purpose nursery soil (Fafard 3 B Mix) versus a 1:1 mixture of
fine soil and vermiculite. For the TRV2-AqPDS-VIGS
experiment, A. vulgaris seeds (collected from the Harvard
University experimental garden) were soaked in distilled
water for 24 hours at room temperature and then planted
1/8 inch deep in soil. They were lightly watered, covered,
and stratified in the dark for 4 weeks at 4°C. After stratification, they were moved to a growth chamber at 20°C
under long days until germination was observed. For the
TRV2-AqANS-VIGS experiment, seedlings were transplanted and allowed to grow for 12 weeks or more, until
they had at least 15 leaves, and then vernalized for 8
weeks either outdoors in winter or in a growth chamber

on short days at 4°C. They were then removed to a 20°C
chamber and treated 1–2 weeks afterward.
Preparation of Agrobacterium
Electrocompetent cells of Agrobacterium strain GV3101
were prepared and transformed as described by Weigel
and Glazebrook (2002). Agrobacterium and unmodified
TRV vectors were kindly provided by S.P. Dinesh-Kumar,
Yale University. Transformation was achieved using 1 μL
of purified construct DNA per 50 μL competent cells
shocked at 2.4 kV using an ECM399 electroporator (BTX
Genetronics, San Diego, CA). After 1 hour incubation at
25°C, the cells were plated on selective media (50 μg/mL
kanamycin, 50 μg/mL gentamycin, and 25 μg/mL
rifampicin) and grown for 3–4 days at room temperature.
Colonies were PCR screened using primers 156 F and 156
R for the presence of TRV2-AqPDS or TRV2-AqANS. Glycerol stocks were made from single positive transformants.
Vacuum infiltration of TRV1 and TRV2-AqPDS constructs
into A. vulgaris

liquid cultures (50 μg/mL kanamycin, 50 μg/mL gentamycin, and 25 μg/mL rifampicin). Cultures were sequentially
inoculated into a final volume of 550 mL and grown for
72 hours with shaking at room temperature. The cultures
were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 10–15 minutes and each resuspended to an OD600 of approximately

2.0 in an infiltration buffer containing 10 mM MES (2-[Nmorpholino]ethanesulfonic acid), 200 μM acetosyringone (3'5'Dimethoxy-4'-hydroxyacetophenone), and 10
mM MgCl2. The solutions were then incubated at room
temperature for 3–4 hours.
Soil was removed from seedlings with 1–5 true leaves by
gently floating them in distilled water. They were then
immersed in a 1:1 mixture of the two Agrobacterium solutions with added 100 uL/L Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds,
Round Rock, TX) and infiltrated under vacuum for 2 minutes. For each batch, approximately 15 seedlings were
infiltrated per liter of bacterial mixture, with up to 126
seedlings treated per round. The seedlings were drained,
transplanted to fresh soil, covered with clear plastic for at
least 24 hours, and grown under long days (14 h light, 10
h dark). Over the course of four replicate experiments, a
total of 229 A. vulgaris seedlings were mock-treated with
TRV1 and the empty TRV2 construct, and 406 were treated
with TRV1 and the TRV2-AqPDS construct.

the TRV2-AqPI-AqANS construct.

Injection of TRV1 and TRV2-AqANS into adult A. vulgaris
plants
Transformed TRV1 and TRV2-AqANS Agrobacterium cultures were grown, resuspended, incubated, and combined
as described above for the vacuum infiltration procedure,
except cultures were only grown for 36 hrs to a volume of
50 mL. 1–2 weeks after adult plants were removed from
vernalization, a wound about 1 cm deep was made by
applying a clean razor blade to a small area at the base of
the basal rosette of each plant, where the leaf bases converge. Approximately 1 mL of Agrobacterium mix was
injected at the site with a needle-less 1 mL syringe.
Depending on the size of the plant and the number of
crowns (lateral rosettes), this was done at multiple sites.

The procedure was repeated at weekly intervals for 5–6
weeks with new injection sites created with each treatment.
RT-PCR analyses of viral transcripts and AqPDS
expression
Leaves were scored for phenotype 5–6 weeks post infiltration. Leaves exhibiting a range of silencing phenotypes
were collected and flash frozen at -80°C. Tissue was collected from a total of 96 plants (including untreated
plants). Total RNA was extracted from the tissue and purified using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). Each total RNA sample was DNAse treated to remove
residual genomic DNA and the concentration was
adjusted to 0.3 μg/μL. Three separate cDNA pools were
prepared for each RNA sample using 3.3 μL of DNasetreated RNA, Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and reverse primers specific for TRV1 (pYL156 R,
[20]), TRV2 (OYL198, [20]), or a poly-T primer [34]. A
total of 61 samples were PCR screened for the presence of
viral RNAs using primers pYL156F/R (for TRV2, [20]) and
OYL195/198 (for TRV1, [20]). To determine relative levels
of AqPDS expression, we first established the linear range
of amplification for ACTIN and AqPDS in our polyT
cDNA samples (25–29 cycles was optimal for ACTIN and
28–32 cycles for AqPDS) and then used semi-quantitative
RT-PCR analysis on cDNAs from 7 to 9 tissue samples per
seedling category for a total of 64 samples. ACTIN and
AqPDS were amplified in separate reactions (ACTIN for
27 cycles, AqPDS for 29 cycles). Primers for the ACTIN
control were ACT1/2 [20] and for AqPDS were PDS-F2 (5'CAGCCGATTTGATTTCCCAGATGTTCTTCCAGCAC-3')
and PDS-R4 (5'-AATCTCTTTCCACTCCTCGGGCAG-3')
(Figure 1). Note that due to the G/C rich sequence of the
R4 primer region, a longer F2 primer was necessary to
achieve comparable Tm values. PCR reactions were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing
0.5 mg/L ethidium bromide. DNA band intensities were
UV imaged on an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager at levels
below saturation and calibrated against a low DNA mass
ladder (Invitrogen) using AlphaEase FC imaging software
(Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). A subset of reactions
was repeated twice for accuracy and the final AqPDS/
ACTIN values were normalized to the lowest ratio.
RT-PCR analyses of viral transcripts and AqANS
expression
Floral tissue exhibiting a range of silencing was collected
and flash frozen at -80°C 1–2 weeks after the last injection
treatment. Tissue was collected from a total of 27 plants,
and 52 flowers (including untreated plants). Total RNA
was extracted from Aquilegia combined sepal and petal tissue
using Plant RNA Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA).). Each total RNA sample was DNAse treated to
remove residual genomic DNA. Three separate cDNA

http://www.plantmethods.com/content/3/1/6

pools were prepared for each RNA sample using 0.9 μg of
DNase-treated RNA, Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen), and reverse primers specific for TRV1
(pYL156R), TRV2 (OYL198) or the poly-T primer. A total
of 29 samples from 22 separate plants were PCR screened
for the presence of viral RNAs as described above.
To determine relative levels of AqANS expression, we first
established the linear range of amplification for ACTIN
and AqANS in our polyT cDNA samples, using cDNA
diluted 1:200 (30–38 cycles was optimal for ACTIN and
27–33 cycles was optimal for AqANS). We then performed
semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on cDNAs from 30 tissue samples (Figure 7). ACTIN and AqANS were amplified
in separate reactions (ACTIN for 34 cycles, AqANS for 31
cycles). Primers for the ACTIN control were ACT1/2, and
for AqANS were ANS-F2 (5'-AGTTCATTCCCAAGGAGTATGTGC-3') and ANS-R2 (5'-TACTTTTTACCCACTGACGGT-3') (Figure 1). ANS-F2 is outside of the TRV2AqANS insert region (to avoid detecting background plasmid ANS sequences), and the screen region also spans a
genomic intron to help avoid detection of any residual
genomic AqANS sequences (Figure 1). Similar to the
AqPDS analysis, PCR reactions were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/L ethidium bromide. DNA band intensities were UV imaged on
an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager at levels below saturation and calibrated against a low DNA mass ladder. A subset of reactions was repeated twice to test for precision and
improve accuracy, and the final AqANS/ACTIN values
were normalized to the lowest ratio.
Morphological characterization of TRV2-AqANS silenced
flowers
Floral organs showing strong silencing of AqANS were
identified based on their bright white color. Light photographs of dissected organs were prepared using a Kontron
Elektronik ProgRes 3012 digital camera mounted on a
Leica WILD M10 dissecting microscope (Harvard Imaging
Center). For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies,
dissected floral organs were fixed under vacuum in FAA
(50% ethanol, 4% formalin, and 5% glacial acetic acid)
and then transferred to 70% EtOH for storage. Before
imaging, organs were dehydrated through an ethyl alcohol series and critical point-dried with CO2 in a Tousimis/
Autosamdri-815 dryer. Material was mounted on aluminum stubs with carbon conductive adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA), sputtercoated with gold palladium in a Denton/Desk II, and
studied in a model Quanta 200 SEM (FEI company,
Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 5–20 kv.
