Abstract
Background: Identifying the regions associated with protein function is a singularly important task in the postgenomic era. Biological studies often identify functional enzyme residues by amino acid sequences, particularly
when related structural information is unavailable. In some cases of protein superfamilies, functional residues are
difficult to detect by current alignment tools or evolutionary strategies when phylogenetic relationships do not
parallel their protein functions. The solution proposed in this study is Feature Amplified Voting Algorithm with
Three-profile alignment (FAVAT). The core concept of FAVAT is to reveal the desired features of a target enzyme or
protein by voting on three different property groups aligned by three-profile alignment method. Functional
residues of a target protein can then be retrieved by FAVAT analysis. In this study, the amidohydrolase superfamily
was an interesting case for verifying the proposed approach because it contains divergent enzymes and proteins.
Results: The FAVAT was used to identify critical residues of mammalian imidase, a member of the amidohydrolase
superfamily. Members of this superfamily were first classified by their functional properties and sources of original
organisms. After FAVAT analysis, candidate residues were identified and compared to a bacterial hydantoinase in
which the crystal structure (1GKQ) has been fully elucidated. One modified lysine, three histidines and one
aspartate were found to participate in the coordination of metal ions in the active site. The FAVAT analysis also
redressed the misrecognition of metal coordinator Asp57 by the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) method.
Several other amino acid residues known to be related to the function or structure of mammalian imidase were
also identified.
Conclusions: The FAVAT is shown to predict functionally important amino acids in amidohydrolase superfamily.
This strategy effectively identifies functionally important residues by analyzing the discrepancy between the
sequence and functional properties of related proteins in a superfamily, and it should be applicable to other
protein families.

conservations, functional correlations and related
structures that belong to a protein/enzyme family or
superfamily. An enzyme superfamily is defined as a
group of proteins that share the same structural scaffold and that undergo fundamentally similar chemical
reactions [2]. Earlier studies [3-5] adopted various
pair-wise alignment and multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) methods to detect the conserved residues that
reveal functional roles in a set of sequences. Classical
sequence comparison tools such as FASTA [6],
BLAST [3], CLUSTALW [7], T-COFFEE [8] and

MUSCLE [9] can detect similarities in aligned
sequences and identify the conserved positions. These
positions are essential for further functional analysis.
Hierarchical analysis [10-12] is often used to select
the most desirable pattern of an alignment. Some protein groups with dissimilar sequences but substantial
structural fold similarity (hereinafter referred to as
remote homologues) have similar or related biochemical functions [13]. These proteins can be classified
into the same superfamily according to their biological properties. Due to their low overall similarity,
using alignment methods alone may not reveal the
amino acid residues that reflect their physicochemical
properties.
In addition to alignment methods, the most common strategy for predicting functional residues from
sequences is motif-based sequence analysis [14-17].
However, the motif-based approach often obtains
excessive false positives, which limits its use for analyzing a protein superfamily. Phylogenomic techniques
such as the evolutionary trace method of identifying
functionally important residues [18] use evolutionary
information to improve accuracy and are particularly
useful for large-scale analyses. This method automatically relates the results back to a given structure and
identifies key features structurally clustered around
substrate and dimmer interfaces [19-22]. This tool is
useful for analyzing protein or enzyme superfamilies
and for extracting functional information from
enzyme families or superfamilies when the phylogenetic tree or dendrogram approximates a functional
distribution.
This study employs a voting concept to search for
functional key residues in an enzyme superfamily. Voting or voting-like concepts are widely used in computing algorithms for various purposes. In computational
biological applications, voting concepts are often integrated with neural networks for protein clustering and
structure prediction [23]. Some theoretical analyses
[24-29] indicate that comparing three sequences is better than comparing two sequences because it increases
the alignment power needed to distinguish significant
matches. Likewise, aligning three groups provides more
information than aligning two groups does. Therefore,
we developed a Feature Amplified Voting Algorithm
with Three-profile alignment (FAVAT) according to the
observed sequence similarity and biochemical properties
of proteins in the amidohydrolase superfamily. The
FAVAT identifies the key residues by calculating a score
for each residue in a rat imidase. The functional residues of a rat imidase were identified and further confirmed by experimental references and available
structural information.

Results and discussion
Case study: Imidase-related proteins in amidohydrolase
superfamily

In this study, rat imidase was the target sequence, and
DRPs (Group II proteins) were classified into ~A proteins. Bacterial hydantoinases (Group III enzymes) were
classified as A proteins. Although Dihydroorotase, allantoinase and other amidohydrolases (Group IV) were also
classified as A proteins, they differ from the Group II
enzymes in their functional correlation to target
sequence (rat imidase). Following the above classification, the clustered sequences were subjected to FAVAT
analysis, and two sets of scores were obtained for each
residue of the target sequence. In the experiments,
Groups II, III and IV were aligned using the MUSCLE
tool adopted by the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) for protein database alignment.
Voting scores of imidase by FAVAT analysis

Figure 1 shows the FAVAT analysis results. The T-score
suggests the importance of each residue of the target
sequence (rat imidase) after accumulating the total voting scores (V-scores), each V-score is calculated from
the target sequence, an A protein sequence and a ~A
protein sequence. For each rat imidase residue, two sets
of T-scores were obtained from the Group II-Group III
votes and the Group II-Group IV votes. Ten amino
acids (Ala34, His67, His69, Ala134, Lys159, His248,
Met297, Arg302, Asp326 and His459) were further analyzed after merging the two sets of the higher T-scores
over 60. Table 1 summarizes the amino acid residues
selected by FAVAT and MSA analyses and their corresponding locations in two proteins with known crystal
structures [PDB:1GKQ, PDB:1KCX].
Comparison of FAVAT and MSA results

Biologists often use MSA to conjecture important residues of proteins or enzymes of interest among their
related sequences. Figure 2 shows the MSA fragments
of rat imidase, hamster dihydroorotase domain, yeast
allantoinase and Bacillus sp. D-hydantoinase. The MSA
analyses revealed that one aspartate and four histidines
were highly conserved. The results in Fig. 2 are consistent with data published previously [30-32].
In their studies [30-32], residues Asp57, His59, His61,
His183 and His239 were hypothesized to be critical
amino acids for the metal coordinators and function of
D-hydantoinase of Thermus sp. Notably, the study [33]
reported that a crystal structure of hydantoinase
(1GKQ), in which a carboxyl-lysine is responsible for
metal binding and is important for enzyme activity, was
not revealed by MSA analysis. Another residue, Asp57,
which was incorrectly identified as a metal coordinator

The possible functions of imidase amino acids selected
by FAVAT were further analyzed using 1GKQ and
1KCX, which are known structures of imidase related
proteins. The former is the crystal structure of a Dhydantoinase that represents an A protein (Group III) in
FAVAT analysis. The latter is the crystal structure of a
dihydropyrimidinase-related protein (CRMP1) that
represents a ~A protein (Group II) in FAVAT analysis.
Figure 3 shows their corresponding sequences and secondary structures. The similar b/a core structures were
observed in the wiring diagrams of 1GKQ and 1KCX.
The significant difference in these structures is that
1GKQ forms a typical (b/a)8 domain, but 1KCX does
not. The FAVAT-selected amino acids may reflect both
the structure feature and metal requirement that are
responsible for the different functions of the A and

core region.
Figure 4a is a topological view of the corresponding
FAVAT-selected amino acids in 1GKQ. Thermus sp. Dhydantoinase (1GKQ) contains two divalent metal ions
in active site (Fig. 4b). The central binuclear zinc center
is bridged by the carboxylated lysine residue (Kcx150)
and a hydroxide ion. Residues His59, His61, His183,
His239 and Asp315 correspond to the active site zinc
ion (Fig. 4b). The corresponding residues were conserved in other members of the amidohydrolase superfamily [36,37]. However, in CRMP1, four of the five
corresponding residues are diverse [38]. These residues
were all identified by FAVAT analysis. Other candidates
recognized by FAVAT analysis, Ala134, Arg302, Ala34,
Met297 and His459, were also found to reside in positions critical to protein function. The corresponding
residue of Ala134 in 1GKQ (Ala126), was located near
the active site (Fig. 4b). Residues Arg302 and Met297
(Arg292 and Met287 in 1GKQ, respectively) were
located at the helix-loop domain outside the (b/a)8 catalytic domain. This implies that they may be important
for maintaining structure or stabilizing the protein conformation (Fig. 4a). These preliminary findings merit
further detailed study.
Although the metal coordinators of imide-hydrolyzing
enzymes in this case study were dispersed sequentially,
almost all the known metal coordinators in 1GKQ were
identified by FAVAT except His 183 (His 192 for rat
imidase). This residue is conserved in CRMP1 but lacks
metal and amidohydrolytic activity. The role of this histidine needs further study. The major difference
between bacterial hydantoinase and mammalian imidase
is their metal content. The former contains two metal
ions while the later contains only one metal ion [39,40].
Fewer metal coordinators may be needed for mammalian imidase, and residue His 192 may not be required
as a coordinator of metal ions in rat imidase. A mammalian imidase was crystallized recently [41]. The difference between mammalian imidase and non-mammalian
imidase is expected to be clarified in the near future.

Conclusions
The FAVAT was developed to predict functionally
important amino acids in mammalian imidase. A Tscore was given to each residue of the target enzyme by
analyzing imidase-related proteins in the amidohydrolase
superfamily on the basis of their sequence-function relationships. Of the ten top T-score amino acids selected,
six (His67, His69, Lys159, His192, His248 and Asp326)
corresponded to metal coordination in D-hydantoinase.
The other four amino acids corresponded with positions
that were structurally important for forming quaternary
structures and secondary structures in 1GKQ. Residue

Asp57, which was misrecognized as a metal coordinator
in previous MSA analyses, was correctly recognized by
FAVAT. This study showed that analyzing the discrepancy between the sequence and functional properties
of related proteins in a superfamily is an effective
method of identifying functionally important residues.
This strategy should be applicable to other protein
families, and the authors expect to employ this strategy
for analyzing critical residues of viruses in future works.

Methods
Imidase and sequence clustering in the amidohydrolase
superfamily

Hydantoinase activity was first reported in plants and
animals [42,43] to hydrolyze hydantoin derivatives that
are not known as physiological metabolites. This enzymatic activity is useful for preparing optically pure
amino acids that are precursors for various antibiotics
[44]. Due to its industrial application, several hydantoinases have been studied and purified from microorganisms [45,46]. A dihydropyrimidinase (5, 6dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase) partially purified
from animal livers was shown to hydrolyze the physiological substrate dihydropyrimidine [47]. A detailed study
of a homogenous imide-hydrolyzing enzyme, imidase,
which was purified from rat, pig or fish livers [48-51],
revealed that it catalyzes a wide spectrum of substrates,
including dihydropyrimidines, hydantoins and other imides [52]. Despite the substrate spectra of hydantoinase
highly similar to imidase, these imide-hydrolyzing
enzymes from bacterial and mammalian sources reportedly have relatively low sequence similarity. Some mammals, flies and C. elegans, reveal proteins with high
sequence similarity to dihydropyrimidinase (or imidase).
These dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins (DRPs) may
be involved in cancer and neuron cells development, but
possess no imidase activity [53-55]. Additionally, other
enzymes revealed by the studies in evolution of the
metabolic pathway are also known to use mechanisms
similar to those observed in imidase [56,57]. These
enzymes include dihydroorotase, allantoinase, urease
and amidohydrolases, which originate in mammals,
plants and fungi [58]. All use distinct substrates that
contain similar imide functional groups.
All of the above enzymes can be classified into the
amidohydrolase superfamily according to their properties and structures [59]. In this superfamily, some proteins have similar sequences but divergent functions
whereas others have similar functions but low sequence
similarity. This phenomenon strongly suggests that only
a few critical amino acid residues in this superfamily are
needed for specific protein functions. Proteins in the
amidohydrolase superfamily can be grouped according
to their sequence similarity and biochemical properties,

and an effective strategy for analyzing these proteins
may yield valuable information.
A string search containing the rat imidase sequence
(Accession No.: NP_113893) yielded 156 protein
sequences of amidohydrolase superfamily were obtained
from the PIR database [60]. According to their sequence
similarity and functional properties, sequences were
further clustered into the following five groups
(Table 2): I. imidase (imide-hydrolyzing enzyme from
mammal); II. sequence-related proteins (dihydropyrimidinase-related proteins with 50% or higher sequence similarity to mammalian imidase but without imidase activity);
III. functionally identical enzymes (hydantoinase, or the
imide-hydrolyzing enzyme from bacteria with 30-40%
sequence similarity to mammalian imidase); IV. functionally-related enzymes (dihydroorotase, allantoinase, urease
and amidohydrolase with 25-48% sequence similarity to
mammalian imidase); and V. putative sequences (gene
products with unknown function) with 30% or higher
sequence similarity to mammalian imidase.
Observation and assumption

Table 2 shows the significant findings of the comparisons of sequence identity and functional properties of
the imidase-related proteins in the amidohydrolase
superfamily. Sequence-related proteins (Group II) had
no imidase activity even though the overall similarity of
sequences in this group was higher than 50% [61]. This
phenomenon implicated that key amino acid residues
for imidase activity have been altered or removed from
Group II proteins. In contrast, functionally identical
and functionally related enzymes (Group III and Group
IV, respectively) had lower sequence identity, but they
basically catalyzed the same reaction. For these
enzymes, few conserved residues should be needed to
provide a similar imidase function. The above observation implies a principle for classifying the sequence or
the functional divergent enzymes in a superfamily,
which may help to develop a feature amplified voting

algorithm for identifying key residues in a target protein. Biologists generally select a sequence of interest as
a target and perform BLAST analysis to recover related
protein sequences. By definition, a specific function or
property (e.g., substrate specificity) of a sequence of
interest can be used to cluster the related sequences
into different groups. For example, if property A is used
to classify these sequences, sequences with property A
should be classified into group A. Otherwise, the
sequence should be classified into group ~A. Based on
the classification of these three groups, a critical
assumption can be made. When the target sequence,
the A sequence and the ~A sequence belong to a protein superfamily, the conserved residues of the target
sequence and the A sequence should correlate to property A. However, the non-conserved residues of the target sequence and ~A sequence should also reflect the
negative correlation in property A. The intersection of
the residues provides important functional clues. Thus,
important residues can be found by comparing these
three property groups. Therefore, the three-profile
alignment method was developed to optimize the alignment of three groups so that key residues are then
revealed by voting algorithm. Figure 5 shows the
FAVAT flowchart that was developed to retrieve useful
information for these distinct groups. Analysis of the
imidase-related sequences in Table 2 indicated that,
within this superfamily, the degree of sequence similarity did not necessarily reflect the similarity in biochemical properties. This provides a good opportunity to
develop a novel method for extracting functional residues of a target enzyme. In this work, FAVAT was
used to examine each residue in mammalian imidase by
comparing other sequences in the amidohydrolase
superfamily. Given the limited structural information
about mammalian imidase, the analytical results of this
study should provide important clues for enzymologists
to perform further in-depth biochemical analyses of
these results.

Figure 5 Flowchart of FAVAT In this study, rat imidase was first aligned simultaneously to A proteins and ~A proteins to obtain voting scores
(V-scores) by voting algorithm based on BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. The V-scores for each vote were accumulated at the corresponding
residues in the target sequence and used to obtain a total score (T-score).

Algorithm

The FAVAT was performed in two steps. The first step
was to align the target enzyme, functionally identical
enzymes (A proteins) and sequence-related proteins (~A
proteins) using three-profile alignment. The three-profile alignment algorithm, which is based on the dynamic
programming three-way alignment approach [62,63],
was designed to align three profiles in a space. As in the
FAVAT pre-process, each profile can be generated by
multiple sequence alignment tools such as T-COFFEE,
HMMER [64] and MUSCLE.
Let P1, P2 and P3 be three profiles, and P1i, P2j and P3k
refer to the ith, jth and kth positions in P1, P2 and P3,
respectively, starting from 1. The symbol “-” denotes a
“gap” in the alignment. Scores for the alignment of two
columns are denoted by Sp(a, b). The scoring pair profiles P1-P2 are defined as follows:

m

Sp12(i, j) =

n

∑∑(W
a =1 b =1

a

× Wb × M ⎡ r1(a ,i) ⎤ ⎡ r2(b , j) ⎤
⎣
⎦⎣
⎦
m×n

)
,

where Sp12 is the score at the ith andjth columns on
P1 and P2, respectively. The P1 has m sequences, and P2
has n sequences. The W a and W b are the sequence
weights for sequence a in P 1 and sequence b in P 2 ,
respectively. The residue at ith column for sequence a
in P1 is denoted by r1(a,i). The M is the value of the substitute matrix for r 1(a,i) and r 2(b,j) . Many substitution
matrices, such as BLOSUM, have been proposed to
improve alignment accuracy [65]. Similarly, the definitions of scoring pair profiles P1-P3 and P2-P3 are similar
to those of pair profile P1-P2. Gap penalties are determined by gap opening (GOP) and gap extension (GEP)

Figure 6 Dynamic programming recursions for three-profile alignment with affine gap costs Scores for the alignment of two residue

GEP are fixed values at any residue position.

scores. The best score of the alignments with prefixes
P 1i , P 2j and P 3k is denoted by S(i, j, k) if the residues
(P1i, P2j, P3k) are aligned; G(i, j, k) is the best score given
that (P1i, P2j, -) is the last column of the partial alignment, and H(i, j, k) is the best score given that the last
column is of the form (P1i, -, -). E(i, j, k), F(i, j, k), I(i, j,
k) and J(i, j, k) are defined analogously. These quantities
clearly satisfy the recursions summarized in Fig. 6.
The next step after the alignment is to determine
whether amino acid residues critical for imidase activity
exist in target and A proteins but are absent in ~A proteins. In the second step, a voting score (V-score) is

given based on the previous assumption, and the Vscores are then summed in each comparison. In this
step, a substitution matrix (BLOSUM62) is used to give
V-score when each sequence of property A and ~A is
compared to the target sequence. The V-score is calculated as follows:
Vk(a,b) = M[tk, A(a,k)] – M[tk, ~A(b,k)],
where Vk(a,b) is the V-score at the kth residues on target sequence, sequence a in A proteins and sequence b
in ~A proteins. The A and ~A proteins have m and n

to obtain V-scores for the voting algorithm. (b) Example of FAVAT scoring. When three-profile alignment was performed in the target sequence,
the voting scores for A proteins and ~A proteins corresponded with the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. For example, residues for target
sequence, an A protein and a ~A protein were A, H and L, respectively. The V-score is -2 (A to H in BLOSUM62) - (-1) (A to L in BLOSUM62) = -1.

target sequence. The A(a,k) and ~A(b,k) are the kth residues on sequence a in A proteins and on sequence b in
~A proteins, respectively. The M[tk, A(a,k)] is the value
of the substitution matrix for t k and A (a,k) . Figure 7
shows the V-score calculation. The BLOSUM62 substitution matrix is generally used for protein or nucleic
acid sequence alignment. In the proposed algorithm,
each V-score is given and accumulated to a total score

(T-Score) until all sequences of property A and ~A are
compared. The T-Score is calculated as follows:
m

Tk =

n

∑∑ V

k(a ,b) ,

a =1 b =1

where Tk is the T-Score at the kth residue on target
sequence. The T-Score at each residue position is

Figure 8 FAVAT scoring example For the first position of the target sequence, four V-scores were calculated for L-L-Y, L-LY, L-K-Y and L-K-Y,
respectively. The T-score at each position is the sum of four V-scores, and the T-score (total score) for the first position of the target sequence is
4. After the normalization function, the final T-score is 52. When any gap existed at the position in one of three groups such as column 11, the
T-score for this position is zero.

obtained by adding m × n V-scores. The normalization
function is used to transform all T-scores into a range
from 0 to 100 in FAVAT. The normalization function is
as follows:
Tk =

Tk − Min(T )
× 100,
Max(T ) − Min(T )

where Max(T) and Min(T) are the maximum and
minimum scores of all T-scores, respectively. The details
of the FAVAT algorithm are shown below, and Fig. 8
presents an example of V-Score and T-Score calculations using FAVAT.
Algorithm FAVAT (t, P, Q);
Input: Target sequence t, a set of proteins P without
property A, a set of proteins Q with property A. P has p
sequences and Q has q sequences.
Ouput: The scores correspond to the residues of t
(high T-scores indicate potentially critical residues)
Begin

t[k] indicates the k-th residue of t.*/
2 fork <- 1 tommaxdo
3 ift[k] <> ‘-‘ then
4 /*T-score [k] indicates the potential importance of
the k-th residue of t. */
5 T-score[k] <- 0
6 max <- -∞
7 min <- ∞
8 fori <- 1 topdo
9 forj <- 1 toqdo
10 /*X and Y are used to store the k-th residue of this
i-th protein in P and this j-th protein in Q, respectively.
*/
11 (X,Y) = (P[i], Q[j], k-th)
12 /*Step 2: Find V-score[k] based on the BLOSUM62
substitution matrix.*/
13 V-score[k]<-BLOSUM62(t[k], Y)
14 V-score[k]<-V-score[k] + (-1) × BLOSUM62(t[k], X)
15 T-score[k] <- T-score[k] + V-score[k]
16 max <- MAX (max, T-score[k])
17 min <- MIN (min, T-score[k])
18 end if
19 fork <- 1 tommaxdo
20 T-score[k] = (T-score[k] – min/max – min) × 100
/*normalization*/
End
The novel feature of the FAVAT algorithm is its use
of the sequence and functional properties among target
sequence, ~A proteins and A proteins. When voting for
reliable critical residue candidates, three relations are
considered: the relation between target sequence and A

Page 11 of 13

proteins, the relation between target sequence and ~A
proteins and the relation between A proteins and ~A
proteins. To accurately identify the key residues, some
useful alignment tools with physicochemical properties,
such as T-COFFEE and HMMER, can be employed in
the FAVAT pre-process to align A and ~A proteins
separately (profiles). The appropriate alignments of A
and ~A proteins can enhance the accuracy of the resulting alignment to the target sequence, A and ~A proteins
by three-profile alignment. The most important residues
can then be found accurately from the resulting alignment using FAVAT. The FAVAT algorithm was
designed to account for the importance of alignmentbased voting skill by V-score function. The time complexity of FAVAT is O(mmax3), and mmax is the length
of the resulting alignment by three-profile alignment.
To reduce the time complexity of three-profile alignment method, this study developed a parallel version
implemented by the MPICH library. The time complexity for the parallel version is O(mmax3/p), where p is the
number of processors. After the voting process, the residue candidates obtain high T-scores. The uncritical candidates can be eliminated by advanced research.
