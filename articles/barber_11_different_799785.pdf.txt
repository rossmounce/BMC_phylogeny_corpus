Different processes lead to similar patterns: a test
of codivergence and the role of sea level and
climate changes in shaping a southern temperate
freshwater assemblage

Abstract
Background: Understanding how freshwater assemblages have been formed and maintained is a fundamental
goal in evolutionary and ecological disciplines. Here we use a historical approach to test the hypothesis of
codivergence in three clades of the Chilean freshwater species assemblage. Molecular studies of freshwater crabs
(Aegla: Aeglidae: Anomura) and catfish (Trichomycterus arealatus: Trichomycteridae: Teleostei) exhibited similar levels
of genetic divergences of mitochondrial lineages between species of crabs and phylogroups of the catfish,
suggesting a shared evolutionary history among the three clades in this species assemblage.
Results: A phylogeny was constructed for Trichomycterus areolatus under the following best-fit molecular models
of evolution GTR + I + R, HKY + I, and HKY for cytochrome b, growth hormone, and rag 1 respectively. A GTR + I
+ R model provided the best fit for both 28S and mitochondrial loci and was used to construct both Aegla
phylogenies. Three different diversification models were observed and the three groups arose during different time
periods, from 2.25 to 5.05 million years ago (Ma). Cladogenesis within Trichomycterus areolatus was initiated roughly
2.25 Ma (Late Pliocene - Early Pleistocene) some 1.7 - 2.8 million years after the basal divergences observed in both
Aegla clades. These results reject the hypothesis of codivergence.
Conclusions: The similar genetic distances between terminal sister-lineages observed in these select taxa from the
freshwater Chilean species assemblage were formed by different processes occurring over the last ~5.0 Ma.
Dramatic changes in historic sea levels documented in the region appear to have independently shaped the
evolutionary history of each group. Our study illustrates the important role that history plays in shaping a species
assemblage and argues against assuming similar patterns equal a shared evolutionary history.

Background
Understanding how species assemblages have been
formed and maintained is a central question in biology
[1-4]. Historical processes, such as river capture and climate change, likely played significant roles in driving the
formation of aquatic species assemblages [5-7], whereas
ecological processes may help maintain species interactions in co-occurring species if in fact those species are

interacting (i.e form a community). Understanding the
relative roles these two processes have had in shaping
species assemblages or communities is challenging [8]. A
logical first-step, especially in poorly studied regions, is
to apply historical methods to understand how past
events have shaped current patterns [9]. In this study we
apply comparative phylogeography and biogeography
methods [10,11] to test the hypotheses that historical
abiotic events are responsible for generating the pattern
of similar levels of genetic divergence recently observed
in two diverse taxa (three clades) that are codistributed
in freshwater systems of Chile.

rates. In addition, Late Pleistocene climate changes might
have altered cladogenic rates due to changes in stream
flow patterns and volume that altered the distribution of
these organisms.
Compared to the Northern Hemisphere, relatively few
phylogeographic or phylogenetic studies have been undertaken in southern latitudes, especially in temperate freshwater ecosystems [14]. However, phylogeographic and
phylogenetic studies of terrestrial and freshwater taxa in
Chile and Argentina [15,16] are beginning to provide
insights into the evolutionary history of this important
region. Because aquatic diversity in Chile is relatively
depauperate [17,18] examination of a few widespread can
provide important insights into the evolutionary history of
the region. For example, a phylogenetic study of freshwater crabs in the genus Aegla (Aeglidae: Anomura;
[19,20] and a phylogeographic study of the freshwater
catfish (Trichomycterus areolatus: Trichomycteridae: Teleostei; [13] discovered similar levels of model-corrected
genetic distance of mitochondrial lineages between Aegla
(cytochrome oxidase I and II genes: 1598 base pairs) and
Trichomycterus (cytochrome b: 1137 base pairs). For

Freshwater systems in Chile are biogeographically
unique and were likely impacted by changes in sea levels
(Figure 1). High gradient rivers originate in the Andes
Mountains (1000 - 7000 m above sea level) then flow
westward to the Pacific Ocean, a distance of only 100 220 km [12]. Currently, most Chilean rivers are quite isolated from each other with the most likely colonization
routes between them are across drainage divides or via
coastal seas [13]. Gene flow between drainages could
have occurred if rivers coalesced on the continental shelf
during historical periods of low sea levels. However, the
continental shelf is narrow, only 10 - 60 km, providing
limited opportunity for rivers to coalesce during lowered
sea levels [13]. We predict divergence between populations would occur when sea levels are high, because the
already restricted freshwater systems would have been
truncated even more, thereby facilitating genetic drift
and the accumulation of genetic divergence. In contrast,
incipient divergence would have been erased when
admixture occurred during lowered sea levels because
previously isolated populations were merged. Overall,
dramatic fluctuations in sea level should alter cladogenic

example, genetic distance between two rivers, Río Maipo
and Río Maule, are 2.6 - 2.8% and 2.0 - 2.8% in Aegla laevis and Trichomycterus areolatus respectively. In addition,
genetic distances between codistributed sister-lineages are
similar. For example, sister-clades (phylogroups: D + E:
Figure 2) in Trichomycterus areolatus and sister-taxa
Aegla bahamondei + A. occidentalis have overlapping
divergence values of 1.0 - 2.3% and 1.7% respectively. Two
codistributed phylogroups in Trichomycterus areolatus
(clades F + G) and within Aegla abtao have similar, but
non-overlapping, divergence values of 3.3 - 4.8% and 2.4 3.2% respectively (see [13] for further discussion). Similar
levels of genetic distance between contemporary lineages
suggest these taxa may have been influenced by the same
events. Finally both taxa are codistributed and often sympatric in the region suggesting both may have been similarly affected by the abiotic events that have shaped the
region [13,20-23].
In this study we test the hypothesis of codivergence
between Aegla species and Trichomycterus phylogroups.
In other words, are the same historical events documented in the region responsible for generating the nearly
identical levels of genetic divergence observed in these
taxa? Four major geological and climate events may have
played a role in shaping the evolutionary history of these
taxa. First, the establishment of freshwater systems in the
region that were precursors to current day drainages,
some nine million years ago (Ma), may have driven initial
lineage splitting [12,21]. Second, two dramatic fluctuations in sea-levels (~5.0 Ma and ~2.0 Ma: [24]) documented in the region might have altered cladogenic rates.
Finally, the relatively high amplitude climate oscillations
experienced during the last million years of the Pleistocene might have increased or decreased speciation rates
[25,26]. We generate specific predictions on the type of
diversification models expected based on the impact of
these abiotic events (Table 1). Furthermore we predict
that if these shared events shaped genetic patterns across
codistributed taxa, we expect to detect identical cladogenic rates and similar dates of lineage splitting in Aegla
and Trichomycterus. To this end we examine the fit of six
models of diversification to the catfish and crab phylogenies. In addition, we determined splitting times for major
nodes. We reject the hypothesis of codivergence if both
models of diversification and times of divergence differ
across taxa.

Results
Dates of cladogenic events

We found that our three taxonomic groups originated
during different time periods (Table 2 and Figure 2). Cladogenesis within Trichomycterus areolatus was initiated
roughly 2.25 Ma (Late Miocene - Early Pliocene) some

Page 3 of 9

1.7 - 2.8 million years after the basal divergences
observed in both Aegla clades. The 95% highest posterior
density (HPD) of the basal Aegla nodes are consistant
with episodes of increased sea levels documented at the
Bay of Tongoy, Chile (~ 4.2 - 5.0 Ma; [24]), whereas the
basal node of Trichomycterus areolatus emerge during a
time of decreased sea levels that occurred in the region
roughly 1.4 - 2.2 Ma [24]. Both crab phylogenies date to
the Pliocene with AeglaA basal divergence occurring
most recently (3.95 Ma), whereas AeglaB originated 5.05
Ma. Moreover, the majority of cladogenic events (15/19)
in the crab phylogenies date to the Pliocene or Early
Pleistocene (> 1 Ma). Only three cladogenic events,
(AeglaA: node H; AeglaB: node J and K) occurred during
the especially high amplitude climate cycles of the last 1
million years. All but one of the six cladogenic events in
Trichomycterus areolatus occurred during the Pleistocene, with two events consistent with the high amplitude
climate cycles of the last 1 Ma. Overall only five of the
twenty-five cladogenic events events occurred during the
last 1 Ma
Effective sample sizes for node estimates were over
500 (as were most parameters); thus, we assume the
results are from thoroughly sampled analyses. Models
selected using AIC for Trichomycterus areolatus were
GTR + I + R, HKY + I, and HKY for cyt-b, gh, and
rag1 respectively. The GTR + I + R model provided the
best fit for both 28S and mitochondrial loci for both of
the Aegla datasets. Nuclear mutation rates estimated
from the analyses are as follows: Trichomycterus areolatus (rag1 = 4.48 × 10-4 [2.34 × 10-4 - 6.79 × 10-4] and
gh = 1.24 × 10 -3 [7.41 × 10 -4 - 1.81 × 10 -3 ]), AeglaA
(28S = 1.63 × 10-3 [7.25 × 10 -4 - 2.58 × 10-3], AeglaB
(28S = 1.04 × 10-3 [5.38 × 10-4 - 1.60 × 10-3].
Diversification tests

The best-fitting model of diversification (Table 3) for
Trichomycterus was pure-birth (delta AICrc = 1.36, p =
0.21), whereas the logistic density dependent model provided the best fit for AeglaA (delta AICrc = 7.79, p =
0.02). A rate-variable birth-death (rvbd) model was the
best model for AeglaB (delta AICrc = 5.47, p = 0.03).

Discussion
This study was motivated by the observation of similar
levels of genetic distances between lineages in three
clades that are codistributed in freshwater systems of
Chile. Our goal was to determine if this pattern was the
result of codivergence driven by historical abiotic events.
We discuss the temporal origins of the three groups.
Then we discuss results of diversification tests and
mechanisms that are postulated to have shaped this
assemblage of freshwater taxa.

Temporal origins

Lineage splitting time (mean) estimates of basal nodes
vary considerably (2.18 - 4.50 Ma), suggesting different
processes generated initial cladogenesis (Table 2 and
Figure 2). The confidence intervals of the two crab
groups overlap considerably, suggesting similar temporal
origins. However, different models of cladogensis were
recovered for these two groups suggesting different processes have shaped these two groups (see next section).
The hypothesis that the original formation of river systems in the region some 9 Ma [12,21] played a role in
shaping this fauna is rejected. However the exceptionally
high sea levels that occurred from 5.0 to 4.2 Ma are
consistent with the origins of both Aegla clades (Table 2
and Figure 2; [24]). Cladogenesis within Trichomycterus
areolatus occurred relatively recently (~2.25 Ma) and is

consistent with a period of low sea levels. This time period is also consistent with the second set of cladogenic
events observed within AeglaB. The majority of cladogenic events within T. areolatus appear in the Pleistocene with the last two events dating to a period (< 1
Ma) of high amplitude climate oscillations (Table 2 and
Figure 2). Only three cladogenic events occurred during
the last 1 Ma in the two crab clades. The relatively few
cladogenic events observed during the last 1 Ma reject
the hypothesis that the especially high amplitude climate
cycles of this period played a significant role in driving
cladogensis within these taxa [26].
Models and mechanisms of cladogenesis

Three different models of diversification were supported
rejecting the hypothesis of codivergence among taxa. The
pure birth model of diversification best explains cladogenesis within Trichomycterus areolatus and suggests that the
rate initiated in this taxon was maintained throughout its
evolutionary history and argues against any significant
impact on rates by later sea-level changes or climate oscillations. A density-dependent model of declining diversification is the best explanation of cladogenesis in AeglaA.
Declines in diversification rates can occur for several
reasons, but are most notable in adaptive radiations
[27,28]. Speciation rates can decline as available niches
become filled with the accumulation of species [29] or if
an underparameterized model of molecular evolution is
employed [30]. The molecular models employed in this
study are relatively complex suggesting the rate decline is
not an artifact of the analysis. Alternatively, the rate
decline could be due to increased extinction rates.
To our knowledge, no empirical data exist on population
sizes in Aegla, thus we can only make broad assumptions

on the relative sizes of populations and their susceptibility
to extinction. The distributions of several species of Chilean Aegla are restricted to single or several adjoining river
system suggesting small populations [19]; Figure 1).
Restricted and fragmented distributions coupled with
small isolated populations in some species [16] suggest
that population sizes are small, possibly increasing the risk
of extinction [31]. In addition, population sizes, inferred
from estimates of genetic diversity, are low and declining
in one crab species, Aegla alacalufi [16].
Alternatively, especially high amplitude climate cycles
over the last one million years may have increased extinction. Only one lineage splitting event dates to the Late
Pleistocene (< 1 Ma) rejecting the hypothesis that this
period was a driver of speciation. Rather the decline in
diversification suggests that the Late Pleistocene climate
cycles, or the lowered sea levels of ~ 2 Ma, may have
inhibited speciation or increased extinction within
AeglaA. A phylogeographic study of Aegla alacalufi
recovered deeper divergence between non-glaciated
populations than between glaciated populations [16].
Many of the drainage systems inhabited by Chilean Aegla
species were covered at least partially by ice during the
last and presumably previous glacial cycles [13,16]. It is
likely then that repeated glacial cycles coupled with small
population sizes in many Aegla species inhibited diversification by increasing extinction rates.
The rate-variable model best explains diversification in
AeglaB and suggests that this clade experienced a more
dynamic evolutionary history than the other clades. That
is the onset of cladogenesis initiated approximately 5 Ma
were later altered by abiotic events. A second cluster of
cladogenic events begins 1.44 Ma (node H) which is a
time consistent with both lowered sea levels and the onset
of high amplitude glacial cycles, suggesting that these
these events increased diversification. Thus in contrast to
AeglaA and Trichomycterus areolatus this period is postulated to be a driver of cladogenesis in AeglaB.
Tests of codivergence

Historical approaches have been used extensively in the
study of codivergence in host-parasite systems [32]. For
example, the assumption that pattern equaled process in
hantavirus was assumed because the virus phylogeny
formed three primary clades that coincided with the

three rodent subfamilies that formed their hosts and the
fact that there is a high degree of host specificity in the
system [33]. However, [33] were able to reject the
hypothesis of codivergence between the hantavirus virus
and their mammalian hosts.
In this study historical methods were employed to
determine if abiotic events were possibly responsible for
driving diversification in these clades, which in turn
allows us to test the hypothesis of codivergence. The
observation of similar levels of genetic distance between
major lineags among these taxa suggests that they are
the result of either shared evolutionary or ecological
processes. Our study illustrates the important role that
history can play in shaping current patterns and argues
against assuming that the observation of similar patterns
among codistributed taxa equals a shared history [9]. It
remains to be determined how, if any, ecological interactions have shaped this species assemblage.
Employing phylogeographic and phylogenetic methods
to test hypotheses of codivergence among contemporary
faunas is an exciting and developing research area [34]. A
fundamental challenge in this endeavor will be choosing
methods that can tease apart complex evolutionary histories among taxa. In this paper we employed two different
methods to test the hypothesis of codivergence among our
three focal groups. Obviously there are some caveats with
these methods. For example, confidence intervals on divergence dates are wide and in some cases overlap multiple
abiotic events and divergence times from the other taxa.
Relying on this method alone would not have allowed us
to test our hypothesis. However, differences in timing of
lineage splitting combined with the fact that we observed
three taxon specific models of cladogenesis allows us to
reject the hypothesis of codivergence. Another potential
problem arises by using mutation rates that are not taxon
specific. This is an issue for most comparative molecular
studies due to the paucity of taxon specific rates. Because
mutation rates vary widely across taxa - vertebrates versus
invertebrates in our study - assuming a common rate is an
unacceptable solution. Finally we recognize our relatively
taxon poor phylogenies may make it difficult to rigorously
compare models of diversification [27,35]. For example
missing or undiscovered taxa could cause an increase,
decrease or shift in diversification rates. The previous phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies of these two taxa

Barber et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:343
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/343

did recover undescribed independently-evolving lineages
and these were included in this study. Despite these caveats
our study illustrates the potential to test codivergence
among codistributed fauna when multiple approaches are
employed [34,36-39]

Conclusions
Results from two different methodological approaches
reject the hypothesis of codivergence among our three focal
groups. Rather these representatives of the Chilean freshwater assemblage evolved through temporally-independent
processes. Although this freshwater fauna is relatively
depauperate additional taxa need to be studied to determine if this is a pervasive observation in freshwater systems
of Chile and how ecological interactions are currently operating on the entire species assemblage. This study illustrates
the importance of using historical methods to test hypotheses on how contemporary patterns have been formed and
cautions against assuming that congruent patterns are the
result of shared processes or ecological interactions alone.
Materials and methods
Chilean taxa and molecular data

The catfish Trichomycterus areolatus and 21 species of
Aegla crabs were studied from the southern temperate
freshwater river systems of Chile (Figure 1). Trichomycterus areolatus is an abundant and widespread freshwater
fish with broad ecological tolerances [13]. Data for Trichomycterus areolatus are the mitochondrial cytochrome b
gene (1137 base-pairs, [bp] GenBank accession numbers
FJ772091 - FJ772237) and two newly obtained nuclear loci
(growth hormone [1491 bp: JN186609 - JN186714] and
rag1 [992 bp: JN186409 - JN186531]) from 63 individuals
comprising seven clades [13]. Like the catfish, Chilean
Aegla crabs are widely distributed and occur in a variety of
freshwater habitats [23]. Two non-sister clades of mostly
Chilean Aegla species were examined [19,23]. The first
clade, hereafter referred to as AeglaA, includes nine taxa,
the second, AeglaB, consists of twelve taxa [23]. Molecular
data for Aegla consisted of the cytochrome oxidase I and
II genes (1598 bp: AY049985-050166) and the nuclear 28S
gene (3105 bp: AY595931 - AY595973, AY596092 AY596093), and 20 and 24 individuals from AeglaA and
AeglaB, respectively [19,20,23].
Phylogeny and dating

The best-fitting model of molecular evolution for each
locus was determined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in jModeltest [40]. A species tree and dates of
major nodes were estimated simultaneously using *BEAST
[41] as implemented in Beast 1.6.1 [42]. A Yule tree prior,
piecewise linear and constant-root population size model
and lognormal molecular clock were assumed. Analyses
were run 5.0 × 107 generations with a burn-in of 10% [43].

We assumed a mitochondrial mutation rate of 1.0 × 10-8
[44], and a range of 8.3 × 10-9- 1.3 × 10-8 [45,46] for Trichomycterus areolatus and Aegla, respectively. Mutation
rates for all nuclear markers were estimated, relative to the
mitochondrial rate, using a normal prior. Due to uncertainty in the appropriate outgroup a midpoint root was
used to root the Trichomycterus areolatus phylogeny [13].
Two individuals of Aegla papudo (cytochrome I:
AY050077 - AY050078; cytochrome II: AY050121AY050121; 28S: AY595929 - AY595930) were used to root
the Aegla phylogeny [19,20,23]. Mean divergence estimates
in millions of years and their 95% confidence intervals
were obtained for all nodes using TRACER v1.4 [47]. If
dates of major nodes or their confidence intervals overlap
with abiotic events (i.e., sea level changes; Table 1), we
assume those events may have been responsible for driving
divergence at those nodes [48].
Tests of diversification models

The hypothesis of codivergence predicts the same process
of cladogenesis should be observed across taxa. To this
end we evaluate the fit of six explicit models of diversification to each of the three phylogenies using a maximum
likelihood test implemented in LASER [49]. In general,
these models provide the means to determine if cladogenic
rates were altered (i.e. by abiotic events), or remained constant (no effect), during the phylogenetic history of each
group. If these taxa codiverged, due to shared historical
events, we expect each to have evolved under the same
model. The six models compared were: Yule pure-birth,
birth-death, logistic density-dependent, exponential density-dependent, Yule two-rate, and a rate-variable birthdeath model. These models capture expected patterns of
cladogenesis under various historical scenarios (Table 1).
For example, if changes in Pliocene sea levels altered rates,
we expect to observe an instantaneous shift in rates. Similarly, we would observe a shift in rates if Late Pleistocene
climate change increased lineage splitting. Under these
two scenarios, we expect to observe either a Yule two-rate
or rate-variable birth-death model. In contrast, if Late
Pleistocene climate change decreased diversification,
through increased extinction or decreased speciation, we
would expect to detect either a logistic or exponential density dependent model. Finally, constant models (Yule purebirth or birth-death) are the expected outcome if climate
and sea level changes had no impact on speciation rates
(pure-birth and birth-death models assume no extinction
has occurred). The best constant (RC) and best rate variable (RV) model were determined using (AIC). Delta
AICrc (= AICRC - AICRV) was used as a test statistic. Significance of each delta AICrc was determined using null
distributions derived from 5,000 trees simulated under a
constant birth-death (extinction = lineage splitting) model
(two-tailed alpha = 0.05, [49]).

Our objective in this study was to investigate processes
of cladogenesis in codistributed taxa with similar genetic
distances between evolutionarily distinct lineages. Unmack
et al [13] phylogeographic study of Trichomycterus areolatus recovered seven well-supported terminal clades with
little to no geographical overlap between them. These
clades had model-corrected sequence divergences between
them greater than many recognized species (> 2%: e.g.
[11,50]). These observations qualify the seven clades as
evolutionarily distinct lineages under several concepts
including evolutionarily significant units (ESU: [51]) and
the phylogenetic species concept [52]. Therefore, we
recognized each of the seven clades recovered in Trichomycterus areolatus as taxonomically equivalent to the currently recognized species as well as several recently
discovered lineages in Aegla.
