Abstract
Background: Comparative sequence analysis of complex loci such as resistance gene analog clusters allows
estimating the degree of sequence conservation and mechanisms of divergence at the intraspecies level. In
banana (Musa sp.), two diploid wild species Musa acuminata (A genome) and Musa balbisiana (B genome)
contribute to the polyploid genome of many cultivars. The M. balbisiana species is associated with vigour and
tolerance to pests and disease and little is known on the genome structure and haplotype diversity within this
species. Here, we compare two genomic sequences of 253 and 223 kb corresponding to two haplotypes of the
RGA08 resistance gene analog locus in M. balbisiana “Pisang Klutuk Wulung” (PKW).
Results: Sequence comparison revealed two regions of contrasting features. The first is a highly colinear gene-rich
region where the two haplotypes diverge only by single nucleotide polymorphisms and two repetitive element
insertions. The second corresponds to a large cluster of RGA08 genes, with 13 and 18 predicted RGA genes and
pseudogenes spread over 131 and 152 kb respectively on each haplotype. The RGA08 cluster is enriched in
repetitive element insertions, in duplicated non-coding intergenic sequences including low complexity regions and
shows structural variations between haplotypes. Although some allelic relationships are retained, a large diversity of
RGA08 genes occurs in this single M. balbisiana genotype, with several RGA08 paralogs specific to each haplotype.
The RGA08 gene family has evolved by mechanisms of unequal recombination, intragenic sequence exchange and
diversifying selection. An unequal recombination event taking place between duplicated non-coding intergenic
sequences resulted in a different RGA08 gene content between haplotypes pointing out the role of such
duplicated regions in the evolution of RGA clusters. Based on the synonymous substitution rate in coding
sequences, we estimated a 1 million year divergence time for these M. balbisiana haplotypes.
Conclusions: A large RGA08 gene cluster identified in wild banana corresponds to a highly variable genomic
region between haplotypes surrounded by conserved flanking regions. High level of sequence identity (70 to 99%)
of the genic and intergenic regions suggests a recent and rapid evolution of this cluster in M. balbisiana.

Background
Comparative genomics studies at the interspecies and
intraspecies levels have revealed the dynamics of genome
evolution and the plasticity of plant genomes. Within
monocotyledons, the grass species of the order Poales
have been extensively studied for their genome structure

and evolution [1], but little is known about monocotyledon plants outside this group. Musa species are giant
herbs from the order Zingiberales of the monocotyledon
group and comprise two important tropical crops,
banana and plantain. Two wild diploid Asian Musa species, M. acuminata Colla (A genome, 2n = 2x = 22) and
M. balbisiana Colla (B genome, 2n = 2x = 22) are at the
origin of most cultivated bananas. Intraspecific hybridizations within M. acuminata and interspecific hybridizations with M. balbisiana have resulted in various
combinations of the A and B genomes in different

cultivars. A majority of these cultivars are triploids with a
genome constitution of AAA (mostly dessert banana),
AAB (including plantains) and ABB [2]. Limited genetic
variation in the most economically important banana cultivars, which are clonally propagated sterile polyploids,
has resulted in a crop lacking resistance to some major
fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens and to several pests.
Wild M. balbisiana is native to South Asia with a geographical distribution ranging from India to south China
[3,4]. It grows in forest clearings and produces nonpulpy, non-edible bananas. Plants of this species are
immune to several diseases and pests such as Fusarium
wilt and Black leaf streak disease and represent excellent
sources of natural resistance [5,6]. The B genome is
used in breeding programs for its traits of vigour, of
cold resistance [7] and could also be interesting for tolerance to pests and pathogens. Recent studies involving
M. balbisiana plants prospected in China have shown
that significant genetic diversity exists in this species [8].
A better knowledge of the genome structure and diversity of M. balbisiana should help exploiting this
resource to increase the genetic basis of cultivated
bananas.
Genomic resources have been recently developed to
study the genome structure of Musa species. The size of
the haploid Musa genome is estimated as varying
between 560 to 600 Mb [9,10]. BAC (bacterial artificial
chromosome) libraries for M. acuminata [11,12] and
M. balbisiana [13] are available and analysis of BAC
end sequences from M. acuminata “Calcutta 4” determined a gene density of one per 6.4 kb, similar to that
of rice [14]. Further insight on the Musa genome structure was recently provided by the sequencing and analysis of 1.8 Mb from 17 BAC clones [15]. The 443
predicted genes revealed that Zingiberales genes share
GC content and distribution characteristics with Eudicot
and Poaceae genomes. Comparison with rice identified
traces of microsynteny that were retained in several
regions since the divergence of the Poales and Zingiberales at least 117 MYA. Comparisons of two genomic
regions representing 140 kb from M. acuminata and
M. balbisiana revealed a highly conserved genome
structure, and indicated that these genomes diverged
circa 4.6 Mya [15]. However, no data is yet available on
Musa intraspecies sequence diversity and divergence.
Resistance (R) genes encode proteins that indirectly or
directly detect specific pathogen avirulence genes products thus triggering a resistance response [16]. The largest class of R genes encodes proteins with a nucleotide
binding domain and leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRR proteins) associated at the N-terminal to a Toll/Interleukin1 Receptor (TIR) homologous region or to a coiled-coil
(CC) motif. NB-LRR encoding genes have been widely
studied in plant genomes [17-20]. Most of them are

organized in arrays of closely related genes resulting
from tandem duplication events. NB-LRR gene clusters
have been identified in several plant species, e.g. in lettuce [21], potato [22], rice [23,24], wheat [25] and common bean [26,27]. They can span from less than a
hundred Kb up to several megabases, as in the RGC2
locus in lettuce [21]. Within clusters, sequence exchange
through unequal crossing over or gene conversion leads
to the formation of new chimeric genes. In addition,
point mutations and diversifying selection result in the
creation and maintenance of novel R gene variants. Studies on the Rpp5 cluster in Arabidopsis, the R1 locus in
potato and the Rpg1-b locus in soybean have shown
reduced colinearity and differences in NB-LRR gene
numbers between haplotypes, likely due to unequal
crossing over between paralogs [22,28,29].
In banana species, around two hundred and fifty resistance gene analog (RGA) partial sequences have been
amplified using primers from conserved motifs of NBLRR genes [30-33]. Recent work identified the partial
MaRGA08 sequence from the wild diploid M. acuminata Calcutta 4 [33]. Used as a hybridization probe, this
sequence revealed the presence of a multigenic family
across three Musa genomes, including the wild diploid
M. balbisiana. Here, we have sequenced, annotated and
compared M. balbisiana “Pisang Klutuk Wulung”
(PKW) BAC clones showing high densities of this
NB-LRR RGA. These sequences corresponded to two
haplotypes of M. balbisiana which allowed us to study
intraspecific variation of this wild Musa species at the
molecular level. New Musa repetitive elements have
been identified, and the structure and evolution
mechanism of a large cluster of NB-LRR genes identified
in these sequences is revealed.

Results
Identification of two large clusters of the RGA08 locus in
M. balbisiana

The MaRGA08 sequence, previously amplified from
M. acuminata spp. burmannicoides Calcutta 4 (A genome) was used to screen a M. balbisiana “Pisang Klutuk
Wulung” (PKW) BAC library of 36864 clones, representing approximately a nine-fold coverage of the genome
[13,33]. Twenty two positive BAC clones were identified,
fingerprinted and grouped into two contigs of 14 and 8
BACs, respectively (Additional File 1: MaRGA08 BAC
fingerprints and contig assembly). Two BAC clones
(MbP026I06 and MbP032N20) were selected for sequencing because they covered most of the first contig and
contained all the MaRGA08 hybridization signals. Their
sequences showed a 25 kb long identical overlap and
were assembled into one contig of 253 366 bp (from
hereafter named B1 [EMBL:FN396606]). Based on similar
criteria, BAC clone MbP036B13 from the second contig

was chosen for sequencing and yielded a 223 694 bp
sequence (B2 [EMBL: FN396603]).
The specific features of each sequence are presented
in Table 1. Automatic and manually curated sequence
annotation predicted 39 and 37 genes and pseudogenes,
covering 50.4% and 47.9% (exons and introns, Table 1)
of the sequence on B1 and B2, respectively. This corresponds to an overall gene density of one gene per 6.3
kb, similar to the first estimates of gene density in Musa
[14] although slightly less dense than the average of one
gene per 4.2 kb found by [15]. Most of the predicted
genes correspond to one large cluster of NB-LRR genes
spread over 59% of each sequence in length. This indicates that we have identified two large RGA clusters
corresponding to the MaRGA08 probe.

had sizes corresponding to the mMaCIR341 sequences
on B1 and B2, while the progeny had either one or the
other band but not both and showed a 1:1 Mendelian
segregation ratio (c2 = 0.37) for this marker (Additional
File 2: Microsatellite mMaCIR341 segregation profile).
This strict segregation of the mMaCIR341 alleles in
PKW demonstrates that the B1 and B2 sequences are
allelic and represent two haplotypes of the same genetic
locus in M. balbisiana. FISH analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of M. balbisiana PKW, using either BAC
clone MbP036B13 or the RGA08 gene alone as a hybridization probe showed two signals potentially corresponding to one chromosome pair, thus supporting this
result (Additional File 3: Fluorescent in situ hybridization at the RGA08 locus of M. balbisiana).

Genetic mapping reveals two haplotypes of the RGA08
locus in M. balbisiana PKW

Conserved and divergent regions between the two RGA08
haplotypes

The B1 and B2 sequences could either correspond to
paralogous loci or to orthologous (allelic) regions. The
dot plot alignment of the two sequences showed two
different patterns: a highly colinear profile at both ends
of the sequences and a repetitive and more disrupted
pattern in the central part (Figure 1). The repetitive pattern corresponds to the RGA cluster in both sequences.
Within this region, colinear relationships are disrupted,
although sequence blocks do show colinearity. To test
the hypothesis of allelism of the two RGA08 loci, a perfect (CT)n microsatellite sequence, mMaCIR341, located
in the central region (Figure 1), was used as a marker
for genetic mapping on an F1 population of 67 triploid
hybrids derived from the interspecific cross between the
M. acuminata autotetraploid cv. IDN110 (4x, AAAA
genome) and M. balbisiana PKW (BB genome) [34].
The two amplification products from the PKW parent

To investigate the extent of sequence conservation and
divergence, we analysed and compared the sequence
structure of the two haplotypes. The B1 and B2
sequence overlap corresponds to 245 kb on B1 and 218
kb on B2 with two highly colinear regions flanking the
RGA cluster (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The first colinear
sequence stretch is 72.5 kb long and contains 10 genes
and four pseudogenes. It starts in the middle of a putative aspartate carbamoyltransferase gene which is complete on B1 and only partially covered in B2. Four of the
predicted genes have a putative assigned function based
on similarity with known proteins in the databases
(Additional File 4: Gene list of MbP032N20c and
MbP036B13 BACs), six genes encode hypothetical proteins highly conserved with rice predicted proteins and
only one gene encodes a hypothetical protein with no
corresponding hit in the databases. The remaining three

predicted coding sequences (CDS) correspond to fragments of genes. The only interruption in colinearity in
this region consists of two indels in predicted introns of
the chlorophyl synthase VTE2 gene (Figure 2). In B1,
the VTE2 gene has a 4.4 kb LTR retrotransposon insertion in intron eight and a 0.9 kb Musa repetitive
sequence in intron 10, both of which are absent from
B2. The second highly colinear region located at the end
of both sequences is 17.4 kb long and contains two predicted genes coding for a mitochondrial transcription
termination factor (MTERF) domain-containing protein
and a putative serine/threonine-protein kinase (B1
MbP032N20cg440; B2 MbP036B13g380, Figure 2 and
Additional File 4). In both colinear regions, the level of
sequence identity between the two haplotypes is very
high (99%). Syntenic relationships of B1 and B2 with the
rice and sorghum complete genomes were investigated
based on best hit (Additional File 4: Gene list of
MbP032N20c and MbP036B13 BACs) and phylogenetic
relationships (data not shown). A syntenic relationship
was predicted within the rice chromosome 6 and its
ortholog, the sorghum chromosome 10. This relationship is based on five of the predicted genes and should
be confirmed on a larger sequence scale when available.
None of the syntenic regions of rice and sorghum contains RGAs.
In between the B1 and B2 colinear regions, the RGA
cluster shows a size difference of approximately 21 kb
between the two haplotypes. This is not due to a

retrotransposon derivatives (LARD). This element shows
several hits to M. acuminata and M. balbisiana
sequences (Additional File 5: Musa RE similarity) but
not to sequences from other organisms, indicating a
new banana specific repetitive element. Target site
duplications flanking retroelements insertions have only
been found for four elements of the Clio, Mooz and
RE5 type and several LTR sequences were partially
deleted (Table 2). Truncated Clio and Mooz elements
(Table 2) were identified and in addition to the elements
described here, fragments of LTR retrotransposon coding sequences are also present on both haplotypes (unlabelled black boxes on Figure 2). This indicates that most
of the retroelements have been subject to deletions and
sequence rearrangements since their insertion.
The position of most retroelements is conserved, with
the exception of three of them which contribute to
sequence variation between the B1 and B2 haplotypes. A
copy of the Clio LARD element in the VTE2 gene of B1
is responsible for the first indel polymorphism in the B1
and B2 colinear region and within the RGA08 cluster,
one Mooz copy is only present on B1 and the RE5
element is only inserted into the B1 RGA08F-1 gene
(Figure 2).
No class II element (transposon) was identified, but
other repeat types were present in this region. In intron
10 of the VTE2-1 gene, an indel of 0.9 kb consists of a
sequence showing several hits only to Musa BAC clones.
This sequence is then clearly a banana repeat, although
no specific structure was identified. A particularly complex region, RE4 (near RGA08Q, Figure 2) was found
highly conserved on B1 and B2. This 4 kb region is ATrich with 30% of GC compared to the average 40% GC
content. It includes three tandem repetitions of 127 bp
and a fragment of a copia-type polyprotein. Fragments

difference in retroelement insertions as their density is
similar between haplotypes (Table 1) but rather to a differential expansion of the RGA family (see below). This
region also includes a C-terminal fragment of a DNAdirected RNA polymerase I largest subunit RPA1 gene
and several MTERF remnants and pseudogenes interspersed between RGA08 genes. Thus, sequence analysis
of the two M. balbisiana haplotypes showed that they
differ from each other by few relatively small indels corresponding to repetitive sequences and in the RGA gene
cluster by differential gene expansion.
Repetitive elements in the RGA08 region of M. balbisiana

Repetitive sequences are major contributors to genome
structure and evolution and are often responsible for
intra- and interspecies sequence variation [35,36]. Repetitive sequences identified here include transposable elements and simple sequence repeats (SSR) and represent
an overall 10% of each sequence. Transposable elements
are mostly present within the RGA clusters rather than
in the flanking regions (Table 1). Four types of transposable elements (RE1, Clio (RE2), Mooz (RE3) and RE5,
Table 2) have been detected using ab initio prediction
and similarity based methods. RE1, Mooz and RE5 have
a size ranging from 2.8 to 4.2 kb. They show sequence
similarity to plant Copia/Ty type of retroelements and
have high DNA sequence identity to Musa sequences
available in databases (Additional File 5: Musa RE similarity). Mooz and RE5 have long terminal repeats
(LTRs) of a relatively small size (Table 2) and partial or
disrupted predicted CDS. RE1 is a remnant copia-like
retroelement with a disrupted CDS and no detectable
LTRs. An additional repetitive element, Clio, has a 4441
bp size with LTRs of 382 bp and an internal domain
with no apparent coding capacity similar to large

LTR features (length, presence of TG and CA at their ends) and Target Site Duplication (TSD) were determined using LTR_FINDER followed by manual annotation.
For complete elements with clearly identified TSD and with LTR length exceeding the empirical limit of 300 bp, divergence time was calculated based on the
Kimura-2 parameter distance between LTRs with a substitution rate of 0.9 × 10-8 mutation per site per year. Stars indicate TE fragments. MY, million years.

of the RE4 region ranging from 470 bp up to 1 kb are
found at several locations within the RGA08 cluster
(seven on B1 and five on B2, Figure 2) close to RGA08
genes. On B1, adjacent to RE4, three tandem repeats of
162 bp are also present.
In addition, SSRs (i.e. dinucleotide up to hexanucleotide repeats) are very abundant, with 112 and 87 SSRs
in B1 and B2 respectively. Except for SSR loci that were
assigned to RGA coding sequences, and for which it is
difficult to find the real ortholog, most of the SSRs are
unambiguously found in both haplotypes with their
flanking sequences. Of these 75 common non-coding
SSRs, 31 are heterozygous, with differences in repeat
number varying from one to 46 repetitions.
A large RGA08 gene family

The most divergent region between the B1 and B2
haplotypes corresponds to the RGA08 cluster. A total
of 31 RGA sequences were identified, differing in number between haplotypes, with 18 present on B1 and 13
on B2 (Table 1). Sixteen are potentially complete genes
and the remaining 15 are fragments, pseudogenes or
remnants with frameshifts, in frame stop codons and
in one case a RE5 insertion (RGA08F-1). All the 31
genes belong to the same family as they share 81% of
nucleic identity in average (ranging between 65% and
99%). They also share an average of 89% sequence
identity with the MaRGA08 probe from M. acuminata
Calcutta 4. On both haplotypes, only one complete
RGA is predicted on the direct strand (RGA08G-1 and
RGA08G-2, Figure 2): it faces an RGA pseudogene on
the reverse strand in a tail-to-tail structure (RGA08H-1
and RGA08H-2) with less than 300 bp between stop
codons. Other predicted NB-LRR genes on the direct
strand are gene remnants (two on B1 and 1 on B2) all
showing the same tail-to-tail structure with another
inverted RGA remnant. This indicates a duplication of
a region containing this structure followed by loss of
sequence. All remaining RGA08 genes are predicted on
the reverse strand, indicating an expansion of the gene
family on this DNA strand. Sequences immediately
upstream and downstream the CDS of most RGA08
genes are highly conserved, suggesting recent duplication events.
The structural pattern of MTERF genes present in the
RGA08 cluster is also complex. On both haplotypes, one
complete copy of this gene with an identical structure of
seven exons, is present in the region flanking the RGA
cluster (Figure 2). Within the RGA cluster, six MTERF
pseudogenes and gene remnants are also present, interspersed with RGA08 sequences. This indicates common
duplication events affecting these sequences and resulting in the complex sequence organisation observed here.

Conserved allelic relationships between some RGA08
homologs

We compared the sequences of the RGA08 genes and
found that except for one case, the highest levels of
sequence identity observed were between RGA pairs
from the two haplotypes, thereby defining allelic relationships. The two pairs of RGAs in tail-to tail orientation (RGA08G-1/RGA08H-1 and RGA08G-2/RGA08H-2)
show 98 to 99% DNA sequence identity and are
embedded in a highly conserved syntenic region
between the two haplotypes. This region of 26 kb also
comprises a highly conserved RPA1 C-terminal remnant
and is flanked by two repetitive elements RE1 and Clio
which are present on both haplotypes (Figure 2). Two
other gene pairs (RGA08K-1 and RGA08K-2, RGA08P-1
and RGA08P-2) together with gene remnants RGA08Q1/RGA08Q-2 showed 99% sequence identity and therefore also correspond to allelic pairs. The highest level of
sequence identity between pairs was always between
genes from different haplotypes, with one exception:
RGA08I-1 and RGA08I-2 showed 98% sequence identity
to each other as well as to RGA08D-1, suggesting a
recent duplication of this gene in the B1 haplotype. The
pair RGA08D-1 and RGA08I-2 is present within a highly
conserved region between haplotypes which comprises
the MTERF1 pseudogene and the RGA08E-1/RGA08E-2
pair (95% sequence identity). This sequence block is in a
different position in B1 compared to B2 (Figure 2) due
to sequence rearrangements within the RGA08 cluster.
Finally, RGA08F-1 and RGA08S-2 share 95% identity in
their CDS but they are not in syntenic position and
they also differ by the RE5 LTR retroelement insertion
in RGA08F-1 which interrupts its coding sequence
(Figure 2). No clear allelic relationships could be found
for the remaining RGAs which are therefore considered
as paralogs.
Two clades of RGA08 genes are present at the RGA08
locus

The RGA08 genes encode predicted proteins with two
coiled-coil predicted motifs (Additional File 6: Prediction of coiled-coil motifs in RGA08) at the N-terminal
followed by an NB-ARC domain with all known conserved motifs (P-loop, RNBS-A, kinase-2, RNBS-B,
RNBS-C, GLPL, RNBS-D, MHD [17]) and a C-terminal
leucine-rich repeat domain with 15 LRR repeats for the
complete genes. No intron was predicted which is consistent with genome wide studies in Arabidopsis, grapevine and poplar which indicate that CC-NB-LRR genes
are generally encoded by a single exon [17,37]. Phylogenetic analysis identified two clades of RGA08 genes
(Figure 3). The first comprises all RGAs predicted on
the direct strand of both haplotypes, namely the two

complete genes of 3147 bp (RGA08G-1 and RGA08G-2)
and three remnants of 711 to 720 bp covering the NB
region (RGA08B-1, RGA08Q-1 and RGA08Q-2). These
remnants are more similar to each other than to the
complete RGA08G-1 and RGA08G-2, which indicates
that at least two duplicated genes of this clade were originally present in this region. The second clade comprises all RGAs predicted on the reverse DNA strand.
These genes have an average size of 3.2 kb (from 2793

to 3310 bp). Three remnants of these genes covering
the NB region have a size of 1026 to 1555 bp. A 70%
level of DNA sequence identity was observed between
clade one and clade two genes and their overall structure is highly conserved (Figure 3). One major difference
between the two clades is the presence of coding microsatellite sequences only in the LRR region of clade 2
RGA08 genes. The first microsatellite (TTC trinucleotide repeat) between LRR10 and LRR11 results in a

Baurens et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/149

polyserine tract which varies from three up to 16 amino
acids. The second microsatellite is a compound (GAT)n
(GCT)n(GAA)n motive at the 3′end of group 2 RGA
genes. The GAA triplet show the largest size expansion
(from four up to 21 repeats) resulting in a predicted
acidic coiled-coil domain (polyE, aspartic acid) for genes
showing a high number of repeats.
Evolution of the RGA08 cluster: intragenic and intergenic
recombination

Sequence exchange was previously shown to be a main
mechanism of R gene evolution [38,39]. Using the program RDP3.34 which integrates several modules for
detection of recombination and gene conversion events,
we investigated the degree of sequence exchange
between the RGA08 homologs. A total of 21 events (at
p < 0.05) were detected between RGA08 genes. These
sequence exchanges affected all RGA08 genes except for
the genes in tail-to-tail structure (RGA08G-1/RGA08H-1
and RGA08G-2/RGA08H-2).
Unequal recombination resulting in increase or decrease
in RGA numbers in one or the other haplotype also takes
place in the RGA08 cluster. One intragenic recombination
event was detected by the RDP program based on conserved sequence blocks between RGA08R and RGA08X
(Figure 4A). Manual inspection of the alignment of
RGA08R, RGA08X and RGA08W suggests that the actual
structure of the RGA08R remnant results from an unequal
recombination event between RGA08W and RGA08X
sequences likely resulting in the elimination of RGA08X
from B1. Other recombination events detected by RDP
could not lead to clear reconstruction of structural
changes affecting the RGA08 cluster. We therefore manually examined colinearity breakpoints between haplotypes
within the RGA08 cluster. In addition to the MTERF coding sequences present in the RGA08 cluster, a 1 kb intergenic sequence present at 2 kb upstream the start codon
of the complete MTERF gene is duplicated and conserved
(70 to 98% identity) within the RGA cluster at three and
two additional locations on B1 and B2 respectively (orange
boxes on Figure 2). Two of these 1 kb long sequences are
flanking the region carrying the RGA08L up to RGA08O
genes on B1 (Figure 2). Another copy is present between
the RGA08K and RGA08P genes on B2. Sequence alignment of these regions identified a shift of sequence identity levels between B1 and B2 within this intergenic
sequence (Figure 4B). This suggests that the absence of
the RGA08L to RGA08O region from the B2 halotype
could be due to an intergenic unequal recombination
event between duplicated non-coding sequences.
Diversifying selection

Sequence exchange is a major mechanism of RGA evolution but its possible homogenizing effect is counteracted

Page 8 of 16

by diversifying selection acting on specific residues of
CC-NB-LRR proteins [38]. We investigated the sites
under positive selection in the CC-NB region and
the LRR region of complete genes using the PAML package [40]. Two likelihood-ratio tests (M1a against M2a
and M7 against M8) indicated that sites were under
diversifying selection for the CC-NB (M7/M8, c2 = 145,
P < 0.001) and LRR data sets (M7/M8, c 2 = 246,
P < 0.001). The majority of positively selected sites (21
out of 40) were located in LRRs (Figure 3) and 14 of
them were solvent-exposed residues (x residues in the
LxxLxLxx motif) which are predicted to be involved in
effectors’ recognition in R proteins.
Expression of RGA08 genes

Six specific primer pairs were defined in divergent parts of
3′-untranslated regions to test whether the corresponding
RGA08 genes (i.e. RGA08E-1, RGA08G-1, RGA08K-1,
RGA08L-1, RGA08M-1, RGA08O-1, Figure 2) are expressed in planta. All tested genes were found expressed
in different tissues of M. balbisiana (Additional file 7:
Real-time qPCR analysis of RGA08 expression) indicating
that several members of the RGA08 cluster are expressed
and are thus potentially functional.
Divergence time of M. balbisiana haplotypes

To estimate the timing of evolution of the two M. balbisiana haplotypes, we calculated the extent of sequence
divergence between the conserved colinear sequences on
both sides of the RGA cluster. In addition to indels,
these sequences differ by single nucleotide polymorphisms with an overall nucleotide diversity of 0.95%.
Twelve complete predicted allelic pairs have been used
to calculate the ratio of synonymous mutation per
synonymous site according to [41]. On the 12.9 kb of
coding sequences (Additional File 8: Estimation of divergence time between PKW haplotypes), 27 synonymous
mutations were detected giving a p-distance of 0.0088.
This is lower than the value found between genes of
M. acuminata and M. balbisiana (ks = 0.04) which
diverged 4.6 MYA. Using the substitution rate that was
recently determined for banana coding sequences
(0.45 × 10-8 mutations per site per year; [15]), a divergence time of almost 1 MYA was obtained for M. balbisiana PKW haplotypes.
We have also calculated insertion times of complete
retroelements with TSDs and LTR sequences above 300
bp in length using the method of [42]. An evolution rate
double than the one determined for coding sequences
was used taking into account the more rapid evolution
of noncoding sequences [36]. Based on this, the Clio element located into the VTE2-1 gene has inserted 0.3
MYA (Table 2). This value indicates recent activities of
LTR retrotransposons in the M. balbisiana genome and

RGA08X and RGA08W results in the actual structure of the RGA08R sequence. The RDP software detected the region of sequence identity
between RGA08X and RGA08R and indicated a recombination breakpoint on RGA08X. Manual inspection of RGA08 sequence alignments indicated
RGA08W and RGA08X as likely parental sequences. The percent nucleotide identity of RGA08X (red curve) and RGA08W (blue curve) is plotted
along the sequence of RGA08R. A shift in sequence identity levels (black arrows) is observed indicating a putative recombination event. (B)
Unequal recombination mediated by duplicated 1 kb intergenic sequences (orange boxes). Intergenic sequences between RGA08K - RGA08L and

Percent of nucleotide identity between 1 kb intergenic sequences of B1 is plotted along the B2 sequence. High sequence identity is visible at

is coherent with an insertion of Clio into haplotype B1
rather than elimination from B2. A second Clio element
in syntenic position in the two haplotypes has inserted
in B1 around 1.2 MYA and thus possibly predates haplotype divergence. Its insertion time could not be confirmed in B2 due to rearrangements. Mooz elements
located on the left side of the RGA08 cluster are also in
syntenic position but their structure is complex with an
inversion and indels. However, the complete Mooz

element in B2 has inserted 2.2 MYA confirming presence of Mooz in the ancestral haplotype.

Discussion
Sequence divergence of M. balbisiana haplotypes

Despite the increasing number of genomic resources
developed for Musa species, no study has addressed the
question of haplotype divergence at the sequence level.
Molecular marker analyses have uncovered a large

Baurens et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/149

diversity among M. acuminata subspecies and also to
some extent in M. balbisiana [43,44]. Musa wild species
such as M. balbisiana are generally outcrossing even if
inbreeding is not totally excluded, due to potential
crosses between vegetative offspring. We have identified
two sequence haplotypes in wild M. balbisiana PKW in
the region of the RGA08 cluster which allowed us to
assess their degree of sequence divergence. The structure and divergence of sequence haplotypes have been
studied in different plant species including grasses such
as barley, wheat and maize and recently in poplar and
sugarbeet. They revealed a mosaic structure of conserved and non-conserved sequences at orthologous or
allelic regions [35,45-48]. The differences mostly affected
the intergenic space and were based on repetitive element insertions and indels of various sizes likely due to
unequal homologous recombination and illegitimate
recombination events. In maize, intraspecific comparisons have additionally showed a difference in gene content between inbred lines [49]. Here, two regions of
contrasting features were identified: the divergent
RGA08 gene cluster and the highly conserved non-RGA
region. In the latter, the gene content was fully conserved and the intergenic regions were also highly conserved. The two relatively small indels correspond to
5.8% of the colinear sequence indicating few rearrangements in the region flanking the RGA08 cluster. In rice,
indels account for 13% of genome divergence between
the indica and japonica subspecies [36], whereas in
poplar, indel rate was found to vary from 0.5 to 14.8%
of non aligning segments between four regions of poplar
haplotypes [47]. In terms of nucleotide diversity, our
values (0.95% based on the complete colinear region
and 0.34% for coding sequences) are very similar to
those in rice subspecies in overall substitution rate
(0.96%) and for genic regions (0.25% for coding
sequences) [36] and are lower than those observed in
maize (0.8% in coding sequences [50]) or sugarbeet
(5.14% overall, 0.96% for coding sequences [48]). Haplotype divergence rates might vary from one region of
the genome to the other as shown in poplar [47] where
sequence diversity varied from 0.32 to 1% in 320 kb
spread over four compared regions. We calculated
the nucleotide divergence at a second M. balbisiana
PKW locus (EPRV locus, [51]) and found there a value
of 0.25% overall nucleotide divergence (0.03% for coding
sequences). Thus, the degree of polymorphism observed
between these two haplotypes of M. balbisiana is
in the range of what was observed for intraspecies diversity in rice and in poplar but is lower than that found in
maize and sugarbeet. This degree of polymorphism is
compatible with the recent divergence time of 1MY
we calculated for these M. balbisiana haplotypes.

The role of repetitive elements

The repetitive fraction of plant genomes is highly variable and can constitute more than 50% of the genome
landscape as in some grass species [52]. In Musa, a proportion of 35% of repetitive sequences was estimated
based on BAC end sequences of M. acuminata Calcutta
4 [14]. The sequences analysed here showed a relatively
low repeat content of 10% in size. The proportion of
identified retroelements in the overall RGA08 region
corresponds to the average of 2.6 retrotransposons per
100 kb found in gene-rich Musa BAC clones [15]
although this value is possibly underestimated as many
Musa transposable elements are still unknown.
Transposable elements identified here all belong to
class I LTR retrotransposons. They showed an uneven
distribution, with the majority present within the RGA
gene cluster. It is difficult to know, however, if this difference in repeat distribution is a cause or a consequence of the RGA08 gene amplification process.
Estimation of insertion times of RE2/Clio and RE3/
Mooz retroelements (0.3 to 2.2 MY) indicates recent
insertions after the divergence of the Musa A and B
genomes, 4.5 MY ago. The presence of older remnants
of LTR retrotransposons and the fact that most elements identified here are disrupted in their sequences is
consistent with mechanisms of deletion affecting repetitive elements as previously described in other genomes
such as rice and Arabidopsis [53,54]. The recent RE2/
Clio insertion (0.3 MYA) contributed to haplotype
divergence in the non-RGA colinear region and reflects
very recent activity of this retrotransposon family in
Musa. Indel sequence variation between haplotypes was
due to repetitive sequences and suggests a major role of
repeats in the divergence of gene-rich regions of the
Musa genome.
Sequences presented here are particularly rich in SSRs,
when compared to available banana BAC end sequences
in which only one SSR was observed every 13 kb [14].
Density of SSRs in this locus is much higher, with an
average of one every 1.5 kb. A strong bias exists within
the RGA cluster, with one SSR every 1.1 Kb compared
to the flanking sequences with one SSR every 2.6 kb.
The high density of SSRs within the RGA cluster is due,
at least partly to the presence of coding microsatellites
within RGA08 genes.
RGA08 cluster evolution in M. balbisiana: the impact of
duplicated intergenic sequences

The RGA08 cluster is a member of the large R gene
clusters identified in plant genomes, with 13 and 18
CDS of the same gene family in less than 152 kb on
each haplotype. Large R gene clusters have been identified in several species such as common bean [26], at the

Baurens et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/149

tomato I2 locus (7 genes in 90 kb, [55]) and in lettuce
where the RGC2 gene family comprises 32 members
within 3 Mb [39]. Within the RGA08 cluster, drastic
changes have disrupted colinearity between haplotypes.
These include a difference in RGA08 gene number, in
repetitive elements and a reshuffling of whole sequence
blocks carrying RGA08 genes and fragments of MTERF
genes. Such features are similar to what was previously
described in other plants at R gene loci (e.g. [22]). One
specific feature here is the high level of sequence conservation of both genic (92% identity in average) and
intergenic (average 78% identity) sequences between
clade 2 paralogs which suggests recent duplication
events.
Two clades of genes coexist on the RGA08 cluster
with one clade showing a particularly large expansion
on one DNA strand. The two types of RGA08 genes
likely originated from the same ancestral sequence and
followed two different evolutionary paths. The actual
structure of the cluster and the presence of remnants in
tail-to-tail orientation suggest a possible model of evolution where a duplication of the ancestral RGA08
sequence was followed by an inversion and a differential
expansion on one DNA strand. The structure in tail-totail orientation was also likely duplicated then partially
deleted. It was frequently reported that repetitive elements are associated to R gene clusters [27,56] and the
presence of duplicated sequences such as the LTRs of
LTR retrotransposons could provide templates for
unequal recombination thus generating diversity at R
gene clusters. Despite the identification of several LTR
retrotransposons, we could not find evidence for their
involvement in unequal recombination events. This is
likely due to the fact that the complete retroelements
we identified are not highly duplicated within the cluster. One particular duplicated sequence, the RE4 region
contains remnants of a copia-like polyprotein. Fragments of RE4 have been found close to duplicated
RGA08 genes and although we could not demonstrate
such events, it is not excluded that this particular low
complexity region corresponds to an old repetitive
sequence involved in the duplication process of the
RGA08 clade 2 genes. In addition to RE4, three types of
sequences are found highly duplicated within the
RGA08 cluster: the RGA08 genes, fragments of the
MTERF gene and intergenic non-coding sequences of
varying sizes which were found conserved at different
positions. We could show that sequence exchange
occurred between RGA08 sequences. In addition, we
found strong indication that a duplicated non-coding
sequence with no specific features was likely involved in
an intergenic unequal recombination event resulting in
a large difference in RGA08 gene content between haplotypes. The RGA08 gene family thus likely evolved by

Page 11 of 16

mechanisms involving intragenic and intergenic unequal
recombination, resulting in a difference in size and
RGA08 gene content between haplotypes. In spite of
this, allelic relationships have been retained for some of
the RGA08 genes.
A particular feature of the RGA08 family is the differential expansion of coding microsatellites in the LRR
region encoding a polyserine and a poly-glutamic acid
motif. Such a feature has been described for the RGC2
gene family in lettuce [57] and the Hero nematode resistance gene in tomato [58]. Amongst Hero paralogs, the
functional gene showed the largest expansion of the
microsatellite. Currently the function of these motifs is
unknown, although their presence in R genes and RGAs
across different species suggests a potential functional
impact of such regions.
The RGA08 genes show all typical modes of evolution
of R gene clusters. Several of them are expressed,
encode potentially complete proteins, and positive selection has been identified on specific residues mostly in
LRR repeats. Such a large gene cluster with a likely
recent expansion could encode functional resistance
genes. Unfortunately, no resistance phenotype has yet
been mapped in Musa species. Markers derived from
the different RGA08 genes here identified could help in
targeting a specific disease resistance trait in Musa
species.

Conclusions
The comparative analysis of the sequence structure of
two recently diverged M. balbisiana haplotypes revealed
an overall high level of sequence conservation of generich regions but also identified recent activity of repetitive elements contributing to sequence divergence. In
addition, our analysis of the sequence organisation of
the RGA08 locus in wild banana has shown that within
one diploid genotype, considerable variation exists in
the number, sequence organisation, sequence polymorphism and mode of evolution of RGA genes. Larger
scale studies on different M. balbisiana genotypes are
required to better apprehend the haplotype divergence
and evolution in this species and help breeders in managing the integration of M. balbisiana in breeding programs. In addition, the whole genome sequence of M.
acuminata (A genome, http://www.cns.fr/spip/September-8th-2009-Banana-genome.html) will soon become
available which will allow further comparative studies of
the different Musa genomes.
Methods
BAC library screening, contig construction and BAC
sequencing

BAC library screening and hybridization were performed
as described by [33]. A contig construction was performed

Baurens et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/149

manually based on MaRGA08 hybridization profiles. Contigs were subsequently confirmed by FPC reconstruction
based on HindIII fingerprints using the following parameters: tolerance, 7; cutoff, 10e-12. BACs were sequenced
at 15 fold coverage and assembled using Phred-Phrap.
Automatically generated draft sequences were manually
curated using CONSED viewer. To ensure correct
sequence assembly, in silico fingerprints were compared to
BAC DNA fingerprints on pulse field gel electrophoresis
using several restriction endonucleases (HindIII, EcoRI,
SwaI, SfoI and BssHII).
Segregation analysis

Genetic mapping was performed on a population of 67
allotriploid hybrids (AAB) previously described in [34].
This population is derived from interspecific hybridization
of autotetraploid M. acuminata (IDN110 4x, AAAA) and
diploid M. balbisiana Pisang Klutuk Wulung (PKW). The
microsatellite mMaCIR341 was amplified by PCR with primer pair mMaCIR341-F (5’-TGAAGGAATCATCAAGCACAA-3)’ and mMaCIR341-R (5’- GGGAAAAATT
CAGCACTTGA-3)’ using 25 ng of plant DNA or 2 ng of
BAC DNA as template. PCR conditions were those
described for banana SSRs [59]. The 33P-labelled amplification products were resolved on polyacrylamide gels.
Dried gels were exposed overnight and autoradiographed
using a STORM 820 scanner (Amersham). Segregation
data were scored manually.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

FISH experiments were performed on root tips of greenhouse grown M. balbisiana PKW as described in [60].
MbP036B13 BAC DNA or PCR amplified RGA08 gene
were labelled with biotin using BioPrime DNA labelling
system (Invitrogen) and detected with Texas Red. The
hybridization was performed with 100ng of probe as
described in [60]. The chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI (4’.6-diamino-2-phenylindole).
Images were taken from a Leica DMRXA2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled Hamamatsu
Orca AG camera and Volocity acquisition software (Perkin Elmer).
Gene model prediction, sequence alignment and
comparison

Gene structures were predicted using the EuGène combiner release 3.2 [61] with rice-specific parameters that
integrate several evidences. Gene models were predicted
with ab initio gene finders, EuGèneIMM and Fgenesh
[62]. Translation starts and splice sites were predicted
by SpliceMachine [63]. Available monocotyledon ESTs
from EMBL were aligned on the genome using Sim4
[64]. Similarities to protein sequences were identified
using BLASTx (NCBI-BLASTALL) [65] on UniProt [66].

Polypeptide functions were also predicted by integrating
several evidences. Protein similarities were searched
using tBLASTn on translated monocotyledon ESTs and
BLASTp on UniProt. Protein domains were predicted
with InterproScan [67]. Clusters of orthologous genes
between the predicted polypeptides and the proteomes
of O. sativa (TIGR release 5.0) and S. bicolor (JGI
release 1.0) were also identified using the pipeline
GreenPhyl [68]. The predicted genes were manually
annotated using Artemis [69]. A gene is considered
complete if its coding sequence (CDS) is canonical and
matches significantly a known sequence in the public
databanks with coverage parameters Qcov and Scov
greater or equal to 0.8. Under these parameters, the
CDS is also predicted to be functional. If a gene contains mutations that could prevent correct expression
(i.e. missing start codon or stop codon, non canonical
splicing site, frameshift or in frame stop codon), it was
considered as a pseudogene. A polypeptide was annotated as a fragment if its coverage (Qcov) is inferior to
0.8 when comparing its length to the length of the
match with the best significant hit. We annotated a
gene as remnant if it is composed of a small fragment
(Qcov <0.3), more than three fragments (Qcov <0.5)
and/or if it has more than two mutations preventing
correct CDS expression. BAC sequence annotation is
available on a genome browser http://gnpannot.musagenomics.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/musa/. Sequence comparison between haplotypes was performed using dotplot
analysis [70]. Local alignments were performed using
BLASTn [65] and visualised with the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [69].
Identification and characterization of Musa repeats

Consensus of repetitive and transposable elements (RE,
TE) were first defined ab initio from the 66 Musa BACs
available in the databases, using the TEdenovo pipeline
of the REPET framework as described in [71]. Then,
repeats were predicted using an improved version of the
TEannot pipeline described in [72]. The candidate
regions for the presence of repeated elements on
MbP036B13 and MbP032N20c were subsequently analysed with LTR_FINDER [73]. TEs of MbP036B13 BAC
and MbP032N20c were then manually annotated using
Artemis [69] and the presence of LTRs was checked
using dotplot analysis of the sequence against itself.
Classification of characterized transposable elements
was performed based on BLASTx against REPET edition
of Repbase (repbase1302_aaSeq_cleaned_TE.fa). Insertion time of LTR retroelements was calculated for complete elements according to the formula T = K/(2r)
where T is the time of divergence, K is the number of
base substitution per site between LTR sequences, and r
is the substitution rate [42]. Nucleotide substitutions

Baurens et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:149
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/149

were calculated using MEGA release 4 [74] with the
Kimura 2-parameter substitution model. A rate of 9.10-9
mutations per site per year was used. This rate was 2fold higher than that determined for coding sequences
in banana based on the assumption that non-coding
sequences evolve more rapidly [36].
Divergence time of M. balbisiana allelic regions

Divergence time between two homologous protein-coding sequences was calculated according to the formula
T = pS/(2r) where T is the time of divergence, p S the
number of synonymous mutations per synonymous sites
between the two sequences and r the synonymous substitution rate. p S was determined using the Nei and
Gojobori method in MEGA4 [74]. The synonymous substitution rate of 4.5 per 10 9 years determined for
banana coding sequences [15] was used.
Analysis of the CC-NB-LRR genes

The 31 CC-NB-LRR coding nucleotide sequences were
aligned with MAFFT [75] and checked manually to verify that codon alignment corresponds to amino acid
alignment (Additional File 9: Sequence alignment of the
coding sequences of RGA08 genes). The maximum-likelihood tree was computed using aLRT-PhyML [76][77]
under the HKY85 substitution model. Instead of the
classical Felsenstein’s bootstrap, the approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) non-parametric branch support
based on a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure (SHlike branch support) was used.
The conserved motifs of NB-LRR proteins (P-loop,
RNBS-A, kinase-2, RNBS-B, RNBS-C, GLPL, RNBS-D,
MHD) were identified based on [17]. LRR repeats were
defined manually based on the consensus LxxLxxLxx
LxLxx(N/C/T)x(x)LxxIPxx where L is an aliphatic amino
acid and x is any amino acid [78]. Coiled-coil structure
was predicted by COILS http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html. Sequence exchange was evaluated
using the programs RDP, Geneconv [79] and Bootscan
[80], implemented in RDP version 3.34 [44] with defaults
parameters except for the Bootscan method where 200
bootstraps and a 90% cut-off value were used.
For the detection of positive selection, sites under
diversifying selection were investigated with the maximum likelihood program CODEML of the PAML package [81]. Sixteen complete genes were analyzed: ten
genes for the B1 haplotype (RGA08A, RGA08D,
RGA08G-1, RGA08I-1, RGA08J, RGA08K-1, RGA08L,
RGA08M, RGA08O and RGA08P) and six genes for the
B2 haplotype (RGA08T, RGA08U, RGA08G-2, RGA08I2, RGA08K-2 and RGA08X). As suggested by [17], the
alignment of the coding sequences was cut into two
parts: the CC-NB and the LRR, 30 amino acids beyond
the MHDL motif. The two trees were computed using

Page 13 of 16

PhyML. Two LRTs, M2a against M2a and M7 against
M8, were run for testing positive selection.
Expression analysis

Two micrograms of total RNA were extracted from different PKW tissues (fruit, flower, root, stem, and leaves)
using the hot borate method as described in [82]. RNA
was treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Charbonnières,
France) to remove possible contaminating genomic
DNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using AMV
reverse transcriptase enzymes (Promega, Charbonnières,
France) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was
performed to analyse mRNA accumulation using the
ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). All qPCR experiments
were performed as described by [83]. Six RGAs (i.e.
RGA08E-1, RGA08G-1, RGA08K-1, RGA08L, RGA08M,
RGA08O) were selected for expression analysis. Specific
primer pairs were designed in the predicted 3′UTR of
each selected gene. The specificity of PCR amplification
was examined by monitoring the dissociation curves
during qPCR reactions. The relative fold differences in
expression of each gene between samples were determined using the 2-ΔΔCt formula [84]. For each gene
and sample, analysis was performed in triplicate on two
independent RNA extracts. The MaACT (actin,
EF672732) gene was used as internal control to standardise the difference between template amounts and
expression level in the peel of green fruit was used as
calibrator.
