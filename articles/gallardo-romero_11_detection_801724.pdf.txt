Abstract
The prevalence of North American orthopoxviruses in nature is unknown and may be more difficult to ascertain
due to wide spread use of vaccinia virus recombinant vaccines in the wild. A real time PCR assay was developed
to allow for highly sensitive and specific detection of North American orthopoxvirus DNA in animal tissues and
bodily fluids. This method is based on the amplification of a 156 bp sequence within a myristylated protein, highly
conserved within the North American orthopoxviruses but distinct from orthologous genes present in other
orthopoxviruses. The analytical sensitivity was 1.1 fg for Volepox virus DNA, 1.99 fg for Skunkpox virus DNA, and 6.4
fg for Raccoonpox virus DNA with a 95% confidence interval. Our assay did not cross-react with other
orthopoxviruses or ten diverse representatives of the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily. This new assay showed more
sensitivity than tissue culture tests, and was capable of differentiating North American orthopoxviruses from other
members of Orthopoxvirus. Thus, our assay is a promising tool for highly sensitive and specific detection of North
American orthopoxviruses in the United States and abroad.
Keywords: orthopoxviruses, North American orthopoxviruses, myristylated protein, real time PCR

Background
The family Poxviridae is divided in two subfamilies:
Entomopoxvirinae, which infect insects, and Chordopoxvirinae, which infect vertebrates[1]. Genera of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae that may cause human
infections include Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus and Yatapoxvirus[1,2]. The genus Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) is the most relevant in terms of human
public health concerns and includes viruses that have
been associated with severe febrile, rash illness in
humans. Its members include: Variola virus, a solely
human pathogen and the etiological agent of smallpox
[2-4]; Monkeypox virus, a zoonotic disease that causes a
generalized rash similar to smallpox with up to 10%
case fatality rate[5]; Vaccinia virus (VACV), the smallpox vaccine which can produce generalized illness in
immunocompromised individuals[6]; and Cowpox virus,
another zoonotic disease which can cause generalized
illness in immunocompromised individuals[6,7]. In

immunocompetent individuals, infection with vaccinia
or cowpox viruses usually only results in localized rash
illness. The other viruses within this genus are not currently known to cause human disease.
The last few decades have seen the description of three
orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) from North America named
after the animal species in which they were originally isolated: Raccoonpox virus, Volepox virus, and Skunkpox
virus[8-11]. These OPXVs are collectively referred to as
North American OPXVs (NA OPXVs). Subsequent work
has determined that the NA OPXVs species are a monophyletic group that is the most genetically divergent
within the OPXV genus[11]. Raccoonpox virus (RCNV)
was isolated for the first time in Maryland, 1961, from
two out of 97 healthy looking raccoons (Procyon lotor).
In the same study, an orthopoxvirus seroprevalence rate
of 23% (22/92) was observed[8]. Volepox virus (VPXV)
was first isolated from a California vole (Microtus californicus) foot scab in 1985[12], and later from a Piñon
mouse (Peromyscus truei) scab in 1988[10], both in San
Mateo county, California. Skunkpox virus (SKPV) has
been isolated only once from an ill skunk in Washington
in 1978[11]. Few studies have been conducted regarding

the ecology, pathology and pathogenicity of these NA
OPXVs[9-14], but their prevalence and role as etiological
agents of potential zoonotic diseases remain unknown.
The development of a highly specific and sensitive
assay for detection of NA OPXVs is critical to the
understanding of NA OPXVs incidence and prevalence
in North American mammals. In addition, the effect of
NA OPXVs endemicity on the immunization of wildlife
populations against other infectious diseases, using
VACV vectored vaccines, is unknown. Orthopoxvirusvectored recombinant wildlife vaccines [e.g. rabies, plague[14-17]], could have the potential to recombine with
NA OPXVs in nature. The use of this assay will enable
detailed studies of NA OPXVs prevalence, pathology
and pathogenesis in their putative host species.
Additional studies using these specific determinations
of NA OPXVs prevalence and incidence rate will inform
subsequent studies evaluating the possible interference
of NA OPXVs disease and immunity, with disease control strategies in which orthopoxvirus-vectored vaccines
target the same susceptible wildlife species.

Methods
Alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction

Amino acid sequences of the G9R gene were aligned
using the ClustalW accessory in BioEdit (Figure 1) and
translated back into the original nucleotide sequence for
phylogenetic analysis. A heuristic tree search was carried
out in PAUP* 4.0b10 over 1000 replicates.
Bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 bootstrap
replicates of 1000 random addition sequence replicates
each. One of two most parsimonious trees is illustrated
in Figure 2.
Primer, probe design and assay conditions

We designed a real time PCR (rt-PCR) assay based on
TaqMan® chemistry and technology using the VPXV 086
gene, SKPV 086 gene and RCNV 070 gene (ortholog of
the VACV Copenhagen G9R). The targeted gene encodes
for the myristylated protein, which is an essential component for cell membrane fusion and entry[18]. The orthologous genes for all viruses included in this study were
aligned using BioEdit to pick the target area on the basis
of conservation and GC content. The primers G9R-NA
OPXV forward (5’YGG-ACC-RGG-AGG-TCT-TTCTGC-ATT 3’), G9R-NA OPXV reverse (5’TCT-GGCCAA-CAT-GAT-TCT-AAT-ACT-GCR-TC 3’), and
G9R-NA OPXV probe (5’FAM AG-GGA-ACG-VTAYAA-TGG-YAC-YGC-TCC-CAA-YTG-CTG-TCGCAC-TTT-BHQ1 3’) were designated to amplify a 156 bp
fragment from a highly conserved region of the gene
(Figure 1). Primers and probe were synthesized in the
Biotechnology Core facility (CDC, Atlanta, GA), utilizing
standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The nomenclature

Page 2 of 7

for the degenerated positions in the primers and probe
designed was based on IUPAC. The probe contained the
fluorophore (FAM) at the 5’ end and the black hole
quencher at the 3’ end. DNA amplification was carried
out using default rt-PCR thermal conditions for the
ABI7900 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, Ca), briefly:
one cycle of 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. PCR amplification is based on fluorescent emission after annealing/
elongation (60°C). The assay was performed in a final
volume of 25 ul per well containing 12.5 ul of TaqMan®
Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem, New Jersey, USA), 4.5 ul of deionized distilled water, 1 ul of each
forward and reverse primer at a concentration of 20 uM,
1 ul of probe at a concentration of 10 uM, and 5 ul of
template DNA.
Analytical sensitivity and specificity of G9R-NA OPXV rtPCR assay

A total of thirteen chordopoxviruses, which comprised
seven old world OPXVs, three NA OPXVs, and three
from different genera, were included to test the analytical specificity of the assay (Table 1). The latter three
included one Parapoxvirus, one Leporipoxvirus and one
Yatapoxvirus. All viruses in the panel (with the exception of the squirrel fibroma virus, which was a crude
cell culture extract), were propagated via cell culture
and purified by two sucrose cushions[19-21]. Total viral
DNA was extracted using Qiagen tissue kits on the
BioRobot® EZ1 workstation, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and later quantified by spectrophotometry using Qubit™ Quantitation Platform by
Invitrogen™. All viruses in the panel were serially
diluted with deionized distilled water until obtaining
appropriate working concentrations. To determine analytical specificity of our assay, the total DNA concentration was adjusted to 2 ng per 5 ul for all the thirteen
viruses in the panel, and the rt-PCR assay was run in
triplicate for each sample.
Analytical sensitivity was determined by using DNA of
the three NA OPXVs at seven different concentrations,
40 fg, 4 fg, 2 fg, 1 fg, 0.5 fg, 0.25 fg, and .125 fg/ul. The
rt-PCR for each concentration was run in 24 replicates.
A statistical probit analysis, a non-linear regression
model, using commercial software SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was done to determine the detection limit of each assay with 95% confidence.
Animal specimen collection and preparation

Peromyscus californicus (Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center, University of South Carolina) were infected intranasally with 10 ul of volepox virus at a concentration of
1.6 × 10 3 PFU or mock infected with 10 ul of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pre-screening of the animals

included evaluation of anti-VPXV and anti-VACV
immunoglobulin type G by modified ELISA with 1:100
dilution of animal serum, and orthopoxviral DNA in
EDTA blood, oral swab, ocular swab and anal swabs by
rt-PCR as previously described[22,23]. Specimens taken
from live animals (blood, oral swab, ocular swab, and
anal swab), and during necropsy (spleen, gonad, kidney,
submandibular lymph node, supradrenal gland, brain,
liver and lung) were performed/collected in accordance
with CDC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines under the approved protocol
2126 CARMOUC. In some animals, additional organs
were taken at necropsy if lesions or signs of disease
were observed (skin, tongue, bladder, intestine and/or
pancreas) (Table 2). A total of 187 samples, from different tissues and bodily fluids, were collected from animals
with clear signs of disease (for example: conjunctivitis,
ruffled hair, skin lesions, crusty noses, apathy and/or
swollen faces) on days 6, 7 and 8 post-infection as well as
45 tissue samples and bodily fluids from healthy, never
infected Peromyscus californicus. Swabs were hydrated
for 5 minutes with 400 ul of PBS, and transferred to
SETS tubes (Swab Extraction Tube System, Roche, Catalog No. 3315568). The SETS tubes were centrifuged in

the VWR Galaxy Mini centrifuge (6000 rpm) for 1 minute to collect the eluant for DNA extraction and cell culture. The tissue samples were suspended in 1 ml of PBS
and a sterile SPEX bead was added. The GenoGrinder
2000 (SPEX Sample Prep) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions to triturate the tissue for later cell
culture and DNA extraction using the Qiagen tissue kits
on the BioRobot ® EZ1 workstation, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Detection of viable OPXV in animal samples through
tissue cell culture techniques

BSC-40 cell monolayers (African green monkey kidney
cell line) were inoculated with 10-fold dilutions of sonicated tissue extract or swab elute. Infected cells were
incubated at 36°C in a 6% CO 2 atmosphere in semi
solid medium (RPMI + 1% Carboxymethylcellulose).
Cell infection was monitored microscopically by observation of OPXV specific cytopathic effect (CPE). At 48 h
post inoculation, cells were stained with crystal violet to
reveal plaques to determine the viral titer (PFU/ml). A
total of 187 putative positive, and 45 negative samples
were examined for the presence of viable virus by cell
culture isolation. These samples were also used for

Results
Analytical specificity of G9R-NA OPXV rt-PCR assay

The orthopoxviruses are all very closely related[11]. Yet
the NA OPXVs cluster into their own phylogenetic subclade, as shown in the alignment of the myristylated
protein ortholog (Figure 2). Our NA OPXV rt-PCR
assay was validated using at least one representative
strain of each species of OPXV as well as one strain
from the genera Parapoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus (Table 1). The assay consistently detected all
three NA OPXVs at 2 ng total DNA (equivalent to > 89 million virus genomes), with threshold cycle (Ct)
values ranging from 16 to 17(Table 1). The purity of
these viral preparations was verified using a real-time
PCR assay to detect contaminating cellular DNA (RNase
P), which did not cross-react with any of the NA
OPXVs DNA preparations (data not shown). The NA
OPXV rt-PCR assay demonstrated specificity for NA
OPXVs, not reacting with the other seven OPXVs or
three non-orthopoxvirus members of Chordopoxviridae
when tested at similar concentrations (Table 1).

PCR assay. The assay was least sensitive for RCNV;
DNA was detected in all 24 replicates down to 10 fg of
DNA (Table 3). For 5 fg of total DNA, 20 out of 24
replicates yielded positive results, and for 2.5 fg, five out
of 24 replicates were detected as positive. The assay
showed higher sensitivity for SKPV DNA, with positive
results in all 24 replicates down to 2.5 fg of total DNA
(Table 3). At 1.25 fg, 18 of 24 replicates were detected
as positive, and at 0.625 fg, eleven of 24 replicates were
positive. The assay proved its highest sensitivity for
VPXV DNA. All 24 replicates at concentrations as low
as 2.5 fg were detected (Table 3). At 1.25 fg of total
VPXV DNA, the assay detects 23 of the 24 replicates,
and at 0.625 fg, 19 of the replicates were positive. The
average Ct values from all positive samples are shown in

Table 3. Based on RNaseP assay results, we can confidently calculate the number of viral genomes detected
based on mass, since there was no detectable cellular
DNA contamination in our preparations. The statistical
analysis (probit) indicated that the assay is capable of
detecting with 95% confidence, 1.1 fg of VPXV DNA
(~5 genomes), 1.99 fg of SKPV DNA (~8 genomes) and
6.4 fg of RCNV total DNA (~29 genomes) under the
cycling conditions, primers and probes described (Figure
3).
Specificity and sensitivity of detection of NA OPXV DNA
in animal samples by rt-PCR

Analysis of all samples (blood, oral swab, ocular swab
and anal swabs) taken prior to infection tested negative
for OPXV DNA by rt-PCR, and anti-VPXV and antiVACV IgG by modified ELISA[22,23](data not included
in the assay evaluation). One hundred and eighty four
out of 187 specimens collected at days 6, 7 and 8 postinfection from different tissues and bodily fluids generated Ct values in the positive range (between 15 and 40)
for our NA OPXV rt-PCR assay, indicating the presence
of DNA specific for a NA OPXV (Table 2). Only three
anal swabs out of 13 taken were negative, and may contain levels of viral DNA under the detection threshold
for our assay (1.1 fg). All 45 samples from the naïve
(PBS mock infected) animals were negative by our G9RNA OPXV rt-PCR assay (Table 2).
Comparative detection of NA OPXV in animal samples
with cell culture versus rt-PCR

One hundred and seventy-eight samples out of a total of
184 rt-PCR positive samples demonstrated detectable
CPE in a single passage on BSC-40 cells. All these samples had a Ct values of 37 or below which, based on the
quantification from the standard curve, would equate to
a minimum of 45 genomes of VPXV DNA. Six samples
out of 184 rt-PCR positives with Ct values of 38 and
above were discordant with cell culture viability results;
in these samples no viable virus was detected and the

Page 6 of 7

estimated number of genomes is less than 45. All 45
samples from naïve animals were confirmed negative by
both rt-PCR and cell culture. When comparing cell culture with rt-PCR results, samples with Ct values equal
or lower than 37 were positive for VPXV growth, and
samples with Ct values 38 and above did not show evidence of viable VPXV.

Discussion
North American OPXVs have been detected previously
using the Low GC Pan-Pox standard end point PCR
assay[24]. However, the sensitivity of this standard PCR
assay is lower (~10,000 genome copies) and more time
intensive than our rt-PCR assay for the detection of NA
OPXVs (<30 genome copies). The G9R-NA OPXV assay
is a high throughput assay better suited for screening
proposes either in the field or laboratory experiments
that aim to detect low levels of NA OPXV DNA. The
assay presented here showed an analytical sensitivity of
1.1 fg of VPXV DNA, 1.99 fg of SKPV DNA and 6.4 fg
of RCNV DNA, which is equivalent to approximately
five, eight, and 29 viral genomes respectively. Our assay
also demonstrated high specificity, capable of discriminating all NA OPXVs from several other members of
the genus Orthopoxvirus and the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae. Since our assay does not cross-react with
VACV, it is possible to determine if wild animals are
potentially co-infected with a NA OPXV and a VACV
vector vaccine (ex. Rabies, plague). The presence of
more than one OPXV in the same individual may mask
the detection of the other virus when detection assays
are broadly reactive. The G9R-NA OPXV rt-PCR assay
will be useful for future studies on the efficacy of VACV
vector vaccines within wild animal populations where
NA OPXVs are endemic.
This rt-PCR assay may also offer great utility in confident detection of NA OPXVs DNA within tissues and
bodily fluid samples obtained from infected animals. Its
sensitivity and specificity significantly surpasses that of
tissue cell culture. Unlike tissue cell culture, our NA

OPXV rt-PCR assay is capable of quickly differentiating
between Eurasian OPXV and NA OPXV. Although tissue culture is still the only means to detect viable viral
particles, our assay demonstrates greater sensitivity than
tissue culture, most likely due to the ability to detect
viral DNA from damaged viral particles or DNA remnants. Previous OPXV studies done during the US monkeypox outbreak in 2003, also found rt-PCR assays to be
more sensitive than tissue culture analysis [22,25,26].
Our assay detected six samples as positive that did not
contain viable virus, possibly due to compromised integrity of the viral particle by either the animal immune
system or by an external factor during the sample collection or processing. A benefit of such a sensitive assay
is the ability to prove that animals were infected even
when viable virus is no longer present or viral isolation
is unable to be performed.

Conclusions
The sensitivity and specificity of this assay makes it a
highly useful tool for detecting NA OPXV in field studies as well as a monitoring tool in pathogenesis studies.
Our rt-PCR assay is a more sensitive, rapid and less
labor intensive method for the specific identification of
NA OPXV DNA within a sample, allowing prompt diagnosis of infection.
