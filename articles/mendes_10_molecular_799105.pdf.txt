Abstract
Background: Immune responses to parasites, which start with pathogen recognition, play a decisive role in the
control of the infection in mosquitoes. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are an important family of
pattern recognition receptors that are involved in the activation of these immune reactions. Pathogen pressure can
exert adaptive changes in host genes that are crucial components of the vector’s defence. The aim of this study
was to determine the molecular evolution of the three short PGRPs (PGRP-S1, PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3) in the two
main African malaria vectors - Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis.
Results: Genetic diversity of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis PGRP-S1, PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 was investigated in
samples collected from Mozambique and Tanzania. PGRP-S1 diversity was lower than for PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3.
PGRP-S1 was the only gene differentiated between the two species. All the comparisons made for PGRP-S1
showed significant P-values for Fst estimates and AMOVA confirming a clear separation between species. For PGRPS2 and PGRP-S3 genes it was not possible to group populations either by species or by geographic region.
Phylogenetic networks reinforced the results obtained by the AMOVA and Fst values. The ratio of nonsynonymous
substitutions (Ka)/synonymous substitutions (Ks) for the duplicate pair PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 was very similar and
lower than 1. The 3D model of the different proteins coded by these genes showed that amino acid substitutions
were concentrated at the periphery of the protein rather than at the peptidoglycan recognition site.
Conclusions: PGRP-S1 is less diverse and showed higher divergence between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis
regardless of geographic location. This probably relates to its location in the chromosome-X, while PGRP-S2 and
PGRP-S3, located in chromosome-2L, showed signs of autosomal introgression. The two short PGRP genes located
in the chromosome-2L were under purifying selection, which suggests functional constraints. Different types of
selection acting on PGRP-S1 and PGRP-S2 and S3 might be related to their different function and catalytic activity.

Background
Mosquito immune responses to Plasmodium play an
important role in the natural control of the infection
and are initiated when pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition
receptor (PRR) molecules [1]. Peptidoglycan recognition
proteins (PGRPs) are one family of PRR, which contain
a domain very similar to bacterial amidase. The Anopheles PGRPs can be divided into two different classes:

short and long. In Drosophila short PGRPs are small
extracellular proteins about 200 amino acids long and
18-20 kDa that are present in the hemolymph and cuticle. They are constitutively synthesized or induced
mainly in the fat-body and, to a lesser extent, also in the
epidermal cells, in the gut and in the hemocytes. Long
PGRPs, have long transcripts and are either intracellular
or membrane-spanning proteins, expressed mainly in
the hemocytes [1]. Seven PGRP genes are known in the
Anopheles gambiae genome [2]. Of these, three genes
code for the short PGRPs namely PGRP-S1, PGRP-S2
and PGRP-S3. Short-PGRP genes from An. gambiae differ in their structure, as PGRP-S2 and S3 have predicted

amidase activity while PGRP-S1 does not. The presence
of catalytic activity in Drosophila short-PGRPs determines its function. Drosophila has two noncatalytic
short-PGRPs, PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD, which are
involved in recognition of bacteria and activation of the
Toll pathway [3,4], while PGRP-SC1/2 have catalytic
activity and can specifically control the level of activation of the IMD signalling pathway [5]. Transcription
alteration of short-PGRPs in response to Plasmodium
infection [6] have been reported. However, the way
these molecules are involved in the response to the
parasite remains unknown. The most plausible explanation in view of recent findings [7,8] is that gut microbiota modulate mosquito response to Plasmodium.
PGRP genes form clusters in the genome suggesting
that they may have been originated by gene duplication
[9]. This phenomenon is also observed in other PRR,
like TEP-1, in which gene conversion plays a determinant role on their evolution [10]. The reasons why
duplications occur are diverse. Once a gene is duplicated, the new gene might degenerate into a pseudogene
due to recurrent deleterious mutations. However, if the
duplication is advantageous for the organism, the gene
might evolve new functions ("neofuntionalization”) since
the first copy maintains the original function. In addition duplicated genes can also have the same function
but which is partially or fully subdivided between them
("subfunctionalization”).
Molecular evolution of immune related genes is determined by their interaction with pathogens. In the present study we analysed patterns of evolution in three
short PGRPs of the malaria vectors An. gambiae and
Anopheles arabiensis, the main malaria vectors in subSahara Africa, and considered the type of selective pressure acting on them.

Results
Polymorphism and diversity

A total of 237 sequences were analysed, 146 from An.
gambiae (all identified as S-form) and 91 from An. arabiensis. Eighty eight sequences were obtained for PGRPS1 (genbank accession nos FJ821900 - FJ821987), 47 for
PGRP-S2 (genbank accession nos FJ821988 - FJ822034)
and 102 for PGRP-S3 (genbank accession nos FJ821798
- FJ821899). There were 15 An. gambiae and 18 An.
arabiensis for which all three genes were successfully
sequenced.
In the PGRP-S1 gene, a fragment of 1182 bp that
includes the coding region (552 bp) was amplified. For
this gene the nucleotide diversity (π) was higher for An.
arabiensis from Mozambique than in the other groups
especially in the 5’ upstream and 3’ downstream noncoding regions (0.013 and 0.023 respectively) (Table 1).
Overall nucleotide diversity was lower for PGRP-S1

(0.000-0.008) when compared to PGRP-S2 (0.009-0.022)
and PGRP-S3 (0.002-0.027).
A total of 1255 bp was amplified in the PGRP-S2
gene, which included the coding region (567 bp). In this
gene the π values varied between 0.007 and 0.014 in the
coding region and between 0.002 and 0.041 in the noncoding regions (Table 1). For PGRP-S3 gene a fragment
of 712 bp, that included the coding region (567 bp), was
amplified. The π values varied between 0.003 and 0.025
in the coding-region and between 0.000 and 0.043 in
the non-coding regions.
For the three genes the total number of segregating
sites was estimated for each geographic sample (Table
1). These were very similar in PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3
genes, and much higher than in PGRP-S1. The number
of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions was
always higher in PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 genes than in
PGRP-S1 and for those two genes synonymous changes
were always higher than nonsynonymous changes. This
is reflected in the πa /πs ratios that were always below
one (Table 1).
Species divergence and population differentiation

Species divergence and population differentiation were
calculated for each gene of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis from two different East-Africa locations, Tanzania and Mozambique.
For the PGRP-S1 gene all pairwise Fst estimates were
significant (p < 0.05). The lowest Fst estimates were
obtained in intraspecific comparisons, indicating that
differentiation was higher between species than between
geographic populations (Table 2). For the other two
genes within and between species Fst estimates were
lower but still significant in almost all comparisons
made (Table 2). Exceptions were for PGRP-S2 gene
between An. gambiae_Tanzania and An. gambiae_Mozambique; An. arabiensis_Tanzania and An. arabiensis_Mozambique and for PGRP-S3 gene between An.
arabiensis_Tanzania and An. gambiae_Mozambique.
To better understand the relationship between species
and geographic regions, a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed (Table 3). For
PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 genes most of the variation was
distributed within populations, but for PGRP-S1 the
remaining variation was distributed between species.
These results corroborate the previous analyses indicating that for this gene the major variation occurred
between species and not between different geographic
regions.
Phylogeny

The median-joining network based on the PGRP-S1
haplotypes showed a clear interspecific separation (Figure 1A). Each species presented one haplotype at a
higher frequency, 5-1_AM for An. arabiensis and

83C_GT for An. gambiae. Both were present in the 2
geographic regions and probably correspond to the
ancestral haplotype. For An. arabiensis the other 7 haplotypes were unique for each geographic sample. In An.
gambiae a lower number of haplotypes was found (5
versus 8) and a second haplotype was shared by the An.
gambiae - Mozambique and An. gambiae - Tanzania
populations.
The network based on the PGRP-S2 haplotypes (Figure 1B) showed a higher number of haplotypes when
compared to the PGRP-S1 network (26 versus 13), and
the separation between species was not as clear as in
the network of the PGRP-S1. There was a single high
frequency haplotype, 5-6_AM, that was shared by more
than one population and by both species. All the other
haplotypes were unique for each population and species,
and showed low frequency. All 13 low-frequency haplotypes specific of An. arabiensis were more closely
related in the network. For An. gambiae, 9 haplotypes
grouped together in the network but two (2-7_GM, 24_GM) were closer to An. arabiensis haplotypes.

The network based on PGRP-S3 haplotypes was the
most complex. As illustrated in Figure 1C, this network
presented a high number of haplotypes (N = 43). Most
of the haplotypes were unique, although 5 of them were
shared between species and three between geographic
populations within An. gambiae. No clear separation
was observed either between species or between geographic regions. A network based on pooled PGRP-S2
and PGRP-S3 haplotypes showed interspecific common
haplotypes between these two genes (Figure 2A), namely
the most frequent haplotype 2-7_GM and another 2 less
frequent (136I_AT and 128I_AT). All remaining haplotypes were exclusive.
Another network based on pooled An. gambiae and
An. arabiensis haplotypes (with sequences from both
genes) (Figure 2B) was made to evaluate if clustering
was predominately due to species or to homologous
loci, in order to infer for concerted evolution. In case of
concerted evolution we would expect that PGRP-S2 and
PGRP-S3 would be more similar within the same species
than to the homologous gene in the other species. This
was not observed suggesting that gene conversion
between PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 is not a major determinant of diversity of these genes.
Tests for selection

For the three short PGRPs genes, neutrality tests were
performed for each of the four populations separately.
The Tajima’s D test detected one gene, PGRP-S1, with
significant departure from neutrality in the An. gambiae-Tanzania population. For the other genes, the
results were consistent with neutral evolution (Table 1).
Similarly, in Fu & Li’s D and F tests only the PGRP-S1
gene showed a significant departure from neutrality for
An. gambiae-Tanzania population. Tests for departure
from neutrality can be affected by various factors such
as population expansion, which would result in negative
Tajima D values for all loci. However, since only one
gene displayed this pattern, population expansion is thus
unlikely
Synonymous (πs) and nonsynonymous (πa) nucleotide
diversity was calculated for each gene within each group
(Table 1) revealing values below one for PGRP-S2 and
PGRP-S3, suggesting purifying selection (Table 1). A
Fisher’s exact test of neutrality based on the number of
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between
sequence pairs of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis was
conducted in MEGA 4.1 [11] for each collection site. Pvalues were equal to one for the vast majority of pairwise comparisons confirming purifying selection (data
not shown). Evidence of purifying selection was also
confirmed by synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous
(Ka) divergence rates. Interspecific comparisons had Ka/
Ks ratios lower than one for the three genes, particularly

for PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3, which is compatible with
purifying selection (Table 4).
Protein diversity

There were 14 types of proteins present in our sample
[see Additional file 1: Figure S1] representing 168 individuals, six different protein sequences for PGRP-S2 and
PGRP-S3 and two that were shared by both genes. An.
arabiensis had more protein sequences at lower frequencies while the opposite was observed in An. gambiae. The most frequent proteins were those shared by
both species (protein type 5 and 7 for PGRP-S2 and 2,
4, 9 and 10 for PGRP-S3) [see Additional file 2: Table
S1].
The phylogenetic analysis using different methods
(Minimum Evolution, Maximum, Neighbor-Joining and
UPGMA, with or without an out group - PGRP-S1)
show the same structure (data not shown). An isolated
branch corresponding to PGRP-S3 type 2 was always
present and was the only one with a bootstrap confidence above 70% (Figure 3).
Sequences were allocated to each protein type [see
Additional file 3: Table S2] and protein types associated
to haplotypes in the network (Figure 2A) revealing that
the most isolated cluster of the network correspond to
protein type 2 while haplotypes clustered at the opposite
corner are associated with protein type 4.
In order to understand if different protein sequences
for PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 display different 3D configurations, proteins were modelled and visualized with the
Swiss-PdB viewer v. 4.0.1. [12-14]. The best fitting 3D
model for PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 was based on the
crystal structure of the human PGRP-Ia (2aphB). The
homology model shows the presence of three a helices,
five b strands and coils (Figure 4).
Amino acid substitutions were mainly present at the
periphery in coils. The exception was PGRP-S3 type 2
that presented 4 substitutions (Thr137Asn, Arg140Gln,
Asn141 Gln, Thr144Ser) in a2 helices and 1 in a3
helices (Thr185Asn). No mutations were present in the
b strands or at the recognition sites.

For PGRP-S1 there were 2 protein types, one corresponding to An. arabiensis and another to An. gambiae
[see Additional file 4: Figure S2]. The 3D model showed
that the amino acid substitutions between the species
were also observed at the a2 helices (data not shown).

Discussion
Nucleotide diversity estimated for the three short PGRP
genes was comparable with other studies made on
immune related genes of Drosophila and Anopheles
[15-19]. Cohuet et al. [20] analysed 72 immune related
genes of An. gambiae among them PGRP-S1. The
nucleotide diversity (π) found for this gene for An. gambiae S form was 0.008; twice as high as the maximum
value found in our study. This may relate to differences
in geographic location. Although differences were not
observed when we compared Mozambique and Tanzania a greater geographical separation could account for
differences in genetic diversity between East and West
African samples [20].
Some differences were found in the three genes studied: PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 revealed higher nucleotide
diversities when compared to PGRP-S1. With respect to
species divergence and population differentiation, once
again PGRP-S1 differed from the others. Fst values and
AMOVA indicated a clear separation between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis for PGRP-S1 gene, which was
not observed for the other genes. The phylogenetic networks reinforced the results obtained by the AMOVA
and Fst values. The different patterns observed between
the three genes may be due to their location on the genome. PGRP-S1 gene is located in the chromosome X
(within the Xag inversion) and PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3
are located in the chromosome 2L (within the 2La
inversion). An. gambiae and An. arabiensis display species-specific paracentric inversion arrangements Xag and
Xbcd, respectively at the chromosome X. This should
contribute to a higher differentiation between the two
species at this chromosome due to reduced recombination in the case of rare hybridization between the two
species. A recent study has shown that introgressed
alleles between An. arabiensis and An. gambiae in the
chromosome X were lost in two generations but introgressed alleles were not lost at loci located in the autosomic chromosome 2L [21]. This may explain the
higher genetic divergence between species found in
PGRP-S1 compared to the other two short PGRPs analysed. On the other hand, PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3
showed no clear separation between species suggesting
either retention of ancestral polymorphism or introgression between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis. Introgression of genes in autosomal chromosomes through rare
hybridisation between these two sibling species has been

Figure 3 Evolutionary relationships of the fourteen PGRP-S2/3 protein types. The evolutionary history was inferred using the NeighborJoining method. The bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1000 replicates. Tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same
units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson
correction method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Red dots represent PGRP-S2 proteins, blue dots
represent PGRP-S3 proteins and purple represent protein types shared by PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3.

demonstrated previously, particularly for chromosome
2L [21,22].
PRGP-S2 and PGRP-S3 are duplicated genes that are
physically close (ca 3 kb) at chromosome 2L http://
www.ensembl.org/Anopheles_gambiae and their coding
region have 95% homology. These two genes are both
considered functional, since the ratio Ka/Ks presents
values much lower than 0.5 [23] and seem to be under
purifying selection. This suggests subfunctionalization, i.
e., these genes share the same or very similar functions.

Neofunctionalization has been normally accepted has
the terminal fate of duplicated genes. However more
recently Gibson & Goldberg [24] suggest that this might
not be a dominant mechanism of protein evolution.
This agrees with the 3D models of the protein, where
substitutions were concentrated at the periphery (Figure
3), even for protein type 2 which was the most phylogenetically separated (Figure 2), while retaining the amidase/PGRP activity on both duplicate genes. Mammal
PGRPs are known to form dimmers [9] and in

Drosophila PGRP-SD interact with GNBP in order to
optimally activate the Toll pathway [25]. Amino acid
substitutions at non-catalytic sites that might be responsible for PRR-PRR interactions might favour the maintenance of slightly different proteins that interact
optimally with different peptidoglycans. An. gambiae
PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 function is not known but transcription profiles of Plasmodium falciparum infected
mosquitoes were down regulated in midgut and carcasses when compared with mosquitoes that had a
blood meal with a P. falciparum strain unable to produce gametocytes [6]. However, no differences were
observed in both expression profiles [6]. Once again
these results suggest similar function/regulation of these
genes.
We cannot determine with certainty when the duplication occurred, but since it is present in both species it
is likely that it happened before An. gambiae and An.
arabiensis split from a common ancestor. The higher
complexity of the haplotype network for PGRP-S3,
showing more diversity and a higher proportion of
shared haplotypes between species suggests that this
may be the ancestral gene from which PGRP-S2 may
have originated.
The results of selection tests showed that PGRP-S1
was the only gene presenting significant departures from
neutrality with negative values for Tajima’s D and Fu &
Li’s D and F. Negative D values indicate an excess of
low frequency mutations consistent with positive selection, however this can be due to effective population
size expansion. Ka/Ks ration for PGRP-S1 was also high
(Table 4) but this could be a result of a very small number of diverged sites and per se do not provide a strong
evidence of positive selection. For PGRP-S2 and PGRPS3, both tests presented a non-significant deviation from
neutrality. Ka/Ks ratio showed values much lower than
one, reflecting functional constrains on the encoded
proteins, i.e., this kind of selection contributes to the
elimination of amino acid variation. Therefore, these
results suggest that the PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 genes
are under purifying selection. This does not come as a
surprise as accumulating evidence suggests that the
majority of Anopheles immune related genes, studied so
far, are also under purifying selection (e.g. [26,27]).
Since PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 could be recently duplicated genes tests like Tajima’s D and Fu & Li’s D and F
provide limited information [28] and analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions should be
more informative. These analyses also point out to purifying selection as the driven force of short PGRPs evolution, in the same way as described for other PGRP genes
of An. gambiae [29] or Drosophila [29].
The different types of selection observed between
PGRP-S1 and PGRP-S2 and S3 might be a consequence

Page 9 of 12

of their function as PGRP-S1 does not have predicted
catalityc activity and is probably involved in recognition
and subsequent activation of an effector pathway, as
PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD in Drosophila [3,4]. While
PGRP-S2 and S3 would exert antimicrobial activity like
PGRP-SB1 in Drosophila [30] and/or modulate the
response as does Drosophila PGRP-SC1 and PGRP-SC2
[5]. Further, specificity-determining residues (Sdr) (Figure 4) will determine that distinct classes of peptidoglycans are recognized by different PGRPs: PGRP-S2 and S3
are predicted to bind MPP-Dap type peptidoglycans [31].
This does not explain why silencing of PGRP-S1 and
PGRP-S2/3 protects the mosquito from infection by Staphylococcus aureus, that displays Lys-type peptidoglycan,
but not from infection by Escherichia coli (Dap-type peptidoglycan) [32]. PGRP-S3 is expressed in response to gut
microbiota [33]. and microbiota can modulate the
response to Plasmodium by inducing mosquito basal
immunity, which is essential to control the infection.
Therefore pathogen specificity will indirectly determine
the faith of mosquito malaria infection and exert different
selection pressure on short PGRP coding genes.

Conclusions
The three Anopheles short PGRP genes studied are
involved in the recognition of pathogens. However, they
show different evolutionary pathways. PGRP-S1 gene is
located in the chromosome X while PGRP-S2 and
PGRP-S3 are located in chromosome 2L. This explains
why PGRP-S1 is less genetically diverse and shows
higher divergence between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis regardless of geographic location. On the contrary, PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 are more diverse and less
divergent due to autosomal introgression between An.
arabiensis and An. gambiae. Data indicated that PGRPS2 and PGRP-S3 are likely subject to purifying selection
consistent with their role in recognising conserved
PAMPs. The 3D model of the proteins showed that no
mutations were present at the cleft that forms the peptidoglycan binding groove, once again implying strong
evolutionary constrains probably because these proteins
need to maintain their PAMP recognition site unaltered,
while the periphery that interact with other molecules is
more prone to accumulate variation. The lower diversity
and apparently higher divergence between species for
the PGRP-S2 gene suggests that this is duplication from
PGRP-S3. Different types of selection acting on PGRPS1 and PGRP-S2 and S3 might be a consequence of
their different function and catalytic activity.
Methods
Mosquito sampling and collection methods

Samples of An. gambiae (82) and An. arabiensis (46)
genomic DNA were analysed from two areas in East

Mendes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/9

Africa: Mozambique and Tanzania. Mozambique samples were collected in Furvela (Inhambane province) in
February/April of 2004 using light traps and samples
from Tanzania were collected in Ifakara in 2000 using
also light traps [34]. Mosquitoes were kept dry in single
tubes with silica gel.
Dna extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from individual specimens
according to the protocol described by Ballinger-Crabtree et al. [35]. Species identification and determination
of An. gambiae molecular forms was carried out by PCR
as described in Fanello et al. [36].
Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing

The primers used to amplify PGRP-S1, PGRP-S2 and
PGRP-S3 genes were designed based on the sequences
annotated in the complete An. gambiae s.s. genome at
Ensembl (AGAP000536; AGAP006343; AGAP006342
respectively). Name, sequence and product length of
each pair of primers are represented in [see Additional
file 5: Table S3].
Nested PCRs were performed in a MyCycler™ Thermal
cycler (Biorad) with final reagent concentrations of 1×
reaction buffer, 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 200 μl dNTPs, 0.5 μl
of each primer and 1.25 U/μl of Taq DNA Polymerase
(Fermentas) for all reactions. PGRP-S1 1st nested PCR
cycle conditions were: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2
minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 45 seconds,
58°C for 60 seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes, with a final
extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. PGRP-S1 2nd nested
PCR cycle conditions were: initial denaturation at 95°C
for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 45 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 60 seconds and
a final extension of 72°C for 5 minutes.
PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 1st nested PCR cycle conditions were similar to those used for PGRP-S1 amplification except for the annealing that was performed at 60°
C. PGRP-S2 2nd nested PCR cycle conditions were: an
initial denaturation step at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed
by 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds
and 72°C for 60 seconds, with a final step of 72°C for 5
minutes. PGRP-S3 2 nd nested PCR cycle conditions
were similar to 1st nested but the annealing temperature
was 55°C.
PCR products were examined on a 2% agarose gel and
products of the expected length were sequenced in both
directions after purification with the SureClean Kit (Bioline) according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
Products were commercially sequenced by Macrogen,
Korea.
Genetic diversity and selection tests

Sequence alignments were performed using the BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.0.5.2 [37]. Basic
population genetic analyses and haplotype statistics were
performed in DnaSP version 4.50.1 [38]. For each

Page 10 of 12

population sequence diversity was quantified by nucleotide diversity (π). To test deviation from neutrality Tajima’s D test was performed. D is expected to be zero
under neutrality with constant population size; Fu & Li’s
D and F tests were also performed; these are similar to
Tajima’s D test. The main differences between these
tests concern the different estimators of the genetic
diversity used. The Tajima’s D test estimates the difference between h (total number of mutations that
occurred in the entire genealogy) and πn (average number of nucleotide differences between two sequences)
whereas in the Fu & Li’s D and F tests the difference
used is between the hi (numbers of mutations in internal branches) and he (numbers of mutations in external
branches) or between he and πn.
The tests referred above give little information in the
case of young genes [39]. Therefore the Ka/Ks ratio was
determined which compares the number of nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions and the number of synonymous (Ks) substitutions per site between DNA
sequences. Ka and Ks ratios were estimated by DnaSP
version 4.50.1 [38]. Ka/Ks ratios equal to one are
expected in genes under neutrality, Ka/Ks ratios less
than one indicates purifying selection and Ka/Ks ratios
higher than one indicate positive selection.
Protein diversity

Amino acid sequences were obtained using the BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.0.5.2 [37] and
aligned using the Clustal W program. Each protein
sequence was modelled using swissmodel at http://
swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/index.php. The best
fitting 3D model for PGRP-S2 and PGRP-S3 was based
on the crystal structure of the human PGRP-Ia
(2aphB) and for PGRP-S1 was based on Drosophila
PGRP-SA (1sxrB). Nonsynonymous mutations were
visualized on the models using the Swiss-PdB viewr v.
4.0.1. [14,13,12] in order to identify possible structural
alterations and if location was within protein activity
sites. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA
4.1 software [11].
Genetic structure and population differentiation

The genetic structure within and among An. gambiae
and An. arabiensis populations was examined with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [40]. The test was
performed considering each species as a distinct group.
Genetic differentiation between populations was estimated by sequence-based F statistics (Fst) according to
Hudson et al. [41]. Significance of Fst estimates was
assessed by pairwise genetic distances. These tests were
performed in Arlequin software version 3.11 [42].
Phylogenetic analysis

To better understand phylogenetic relationships between
intraspecific data, which normally consist in very similar
sequences, we connected haplotypes on a median-

based on default parameters.
