Abstract
Background: Dunaliella salina is the most important species of the genus for β-carotene
production. Several investigations have demonstrated that D. salina produces more than 10% dry
weight of pigment and that the species grows in salt saturated lagoons. High plasticity in the green
stage and the almost indistinguishable differences in the red phase make identification and
differentiation of species and ecotypes very difficult and time consuming.
Results: In this work, we applied our intron-sizing method to compare the 18S rDNA fingerprint
between D. salina (CCAP 19/18), D. salina/bardawil (UTEX LB2538) and β-carotene hyperproducing
strains of Dunaliella isolated from salt saturated lagoons in Baja, Mexico. All hyperproducer strains
reached β-carotene levels of about 10 pg/cell. Optical microscopy did not allow to differentiate
between these Dunaliella strains; however, 18S rDNA fingerprinting methodology allowed us to
differentiate D. salina from D. salina/bardawil.
Conclusion: In Baja Mexico we found D. salina and D. salina/bardawil species by using intron-sizingmethod. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Dunaliella 18S rDNA gene
sequences were analyzed with our methodology and extraordinary correlation was found with
experimental results.

Background
Dunaliella was originally described by Teodoresco 1905.
Since then, taxonomic studies among Dunaliella have
identified several new species. However, even today differentiation among halophilic and carotenogenic Dunaliella
species in both green and red stages is difficult and time
consuming. In addition, some strains and species in culture collections are misnamed and have given rise to
unnecessary strains and species names [1]. This confusion

of strains and species names makes comparison of results
by different authors difficult [2]. D. salina and D. salina/
bardawil are the only reported β-carotene hyperproducer
species of the genus (at least 10%), that grows in salt saturated lagoons [3]. However, a controversy still exists
about identification of D. salina/bardawil as different species of D. salina [2]. Molecular identification provides a
useful tool to distinguish between inter and intra-specific
morphologically similar species [4,5] and mixed popula-

tions [6,7]. Intra-species identification of community
members without cultivation, avoid some selective biases
associated with pure culture methods [8]. Specie-specific
oligonucleotides could be useful to identify either species
from culture collections or from natural environments
[9,10]. Slight phylogenetic and taxonomic differences in
Dunaliella species can conceal profound differences in
their potential for production of metabolites such as carotenoids [4]. To study these organisms one must discriminate them from their presumed non carotenogenic
congeners and from among species with similar morphological features [11].
D. salina strains have been found around the world (Australia, Chile, India, Israel, México, etc), however, D. salina/
bardawil classified by Dr. Ben-Amotz has not been
reported from other places than Bardawil lagoon. In this
work, using intron-sizing method, we demonstrated that
each hyperproducer species has an exclusive 18S rDNA
fingerprint profile. D. salina/bardawil species with the
same 18S rDNA fingerprint and same amount of β-carotene was found in salt saturated lagoons in Baja California
Mexico (Fig. 1). Non β-carotene hyperproducer species of
Dunaliella were easily discriminated with our methodology, even in the green stage, avoiding long cleaning, purification and growing process. The intron-sizing method
provides a novel and very powerful DNA-fingerprinting
technique to accomplish a specific, rapid and sensitive
identification of carotenogenic Dunaliella species. In this
work we demonstrated that auxiliary methods, such as the
one proposed, could be useful obtaining well characterized and certified international culture collection.

Results and discussion
Microscopic examination of Dunaliella salina 19/18 sample showed two different species of Dunaliella; one red
and one green. Molecular fingerprinting determination
using MA1–MA2 18S rDNA conserved primers from 19/
18 DNA sample, gave two PCR products: one band of
~2100 bp that belongs to β-carotene hyperproducer species of D. salina, and a second product of ~1700 bp from
Dunaliella species that never turns red (Fig. 2). These
results agree with microscopic determination where two
species of Dunaliella were observed (data not shown). Furthermore, using 19/18 DNA sample and DSs-MA2 specific
primers we obtained a PCR product of ~700 bp from red
species and no band from green species (Fig. 2). With
these results we established the fingerprinting profile of
19/18 β-carotene hyperproducer strain of D. salina as
(MA1–MA2 = ~2100 bp/DSs-MA2 = ~700 bp). Interestingly, the same fingerprinting was shown by D. salina
M84320 isolated from Chile and reported by Wilcox and
coworkers [12]. Furthermore, D. salina BCO2 strain isolated in Mexico, also presented the same 18S rDNA fingerprint [5,13] as did D. salina strain found in India by Raja

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/5

and coworkers [14]. A common characteristic from these
D. salina strains in addition to their fingerprinting profile
was their β-carotene hyperproduction capacity.
Taking into account that D. salina strains isolated from
different continents presented the same fingerprinting
profile and β-carotene levels, we can be assured that the
intron-sizing method developed by our group is trustworthy, rapid and sensitive, for specifically identifying these
hyperproducer strains of D. salina. We can conclude that
D. salina strains with the following fingerprinting profile
of MA1–MA2 = ~2100 bp and DSs-MA2 = ~700 bp,
belong to the same species, are distributed worldwide and
their β-carotene hyperproduction capacity is well conserved. Thus, in order to facilitate identification, we suggest a sub-classification calling these strains as "D. salina
var Teod".
On the other hand, both species classified as D. salina/
bardawil purchased from UTEX (LB2538) ten years ago
and Dunaliella strain isolated from Baja Mexico (this
work), turned red and reached 10% dry weight of β-carotene. In addition, both strains amplified a PCR product of
~2500 bp using MA1–MA2 primers (Fig. 3). Specific 18S
rDNA fingerprints showed a PCR product of ~1000 bp
using DBs-MA2 primers in both strains and no bands
were amplified with DSs-MA2 (Fig. 3). With these results
we established the fingerprinting profile of D. salina/
bardawil as MA1–MA2 = ~2500 bp/DBs-MA2 = ~1000 bp.
D. salina/bardawil species has not been reported from
other places than Bardawil lagoon. In this sense, a controversy still exists about the authenticity of D. salina/
bardawil as new species [2]. In addition, microscopic differentiation between D. salina and D. salina/bardawil species is difficult and time consuming. However,
molecularly, D. salina/bardawil has an exclusive fingerprinting profile of MA1–MA2 = ~2500 bp/DBs-MA2 =
~1000 bp, different from the one presented by "D. salina
var Teod" (MA1–MA2 = ~2100/DSs-MA2 = ~700). Certainly, more work must be done by taxonomic experts to
definitively classify D. salina/bardawil as "D. bardawil" or
as "D. salina var Bardal" or with another name. However,
our methodology works well to differentiate between the
two most important carotenogenic species of Dunaliella
and to make a rapid and precise identification of them.
Most importantly, this methodology is helpful in the
beginning of the isolation process even in the green stage.
This information is important both for commercial and
scientific applications.
Recently, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has initiated a D. salina genome sequencing
project (ID: 18607). In this sense, it is important to know
specific identity of target species, particularly if several
groups from several countries are involved in this ambi-

tious and time consuming task. Confidence knowing specific identity of target species can avoid wasting time and
money.
Additionally, demands for natural products are growing
in importance and β-carotene is not an exception [1,15].
Rapid and specific identification and certification of commercial strains or species can improve production yields
and help in the competitiveness by avoiding contamination with undesired species. Cross-contamination even
with other hyperproducer strains still can affect the productivity due different environmental and nutritional
conditions required for each strain. As an example, in May
of 2008 we purchased LB2538 strain from UTEX again,
but surprisingly, a fingerprinting profile of "D. salina var
Teod" was obtained (MA1–MA2 = ~2100, DSs-MA2 =
~700) instead of the fingerprinting profile of D. salina/

bardawil (MA1–MA2 = ~2500, DBs-MA2 = ~1000) which
we were expecting (data not shown).
Moreover, contamination with non hyperproducer strains
is more dangerous because these strains grow faster than
hyperproducers, due to the fact that there are no metabolic efforts required for β-carotene production. This was
the case for 19/18 samples where hyperproducer and non
hyperproducer species of Dunaliella were identified by our
fingerprinting methodology (Fig. 2).
D. salina 19/30 supposedly was the strain isolated by Dr.
Ben-Amotz (D. salina/bardawil), however PCR amplification with MA1–MA2 presented neither the ~2500 bp
product associated with the original D. salina/bardawil
species [11], nor the ~2100 bp amplification associated
with D. salina var Teod species. Nevertheless, the 19/30
strain amplified a PCR product of ~1700 bp using MA1–
MA2 conserved primers (Fig. 3) and the species itself
never turns red, indicating β-carotene is not hyperproduced by this strain. In addition, Gene Bank had reported
a 19/30 strain with ~1700 bp 18S rDNA gene size
(EF473749.1) and another 19/30 strain was reported with
~2100 bp 18S rDNA gene size (DQ447648.1). The first
report comes from Italy and the second comes from
France. This is another good example of cross-contamination that researchers and even certified cultured collection

banks can undergo, due to almost indistinguishable taxonomic characteristics between Dunaliella species.
Auxiliary methods like the one we are proposing could be
useful for characterizing and certifying international culture collections as well. Taxonomic characterization is
important to identify and differentiate species; however,
differentiation between subspecies, ecotypes or similar
species with taxonomy tools is a difficult and time consuming task and sometimes impossible. For this reason,
the 18S rDNA intron-sizing method proposed in this
work provides a novel and powerful DNA-fingerprinting
methodology to accomplish a specific, rapid and sensitive
identification of carotenogenic Dunaliella species.
On the other hand, D. salina LB1644 strain obtained from
UTEX did turn to red; however it produced only 1% dry
weight of β-carotene. LB1644 strain amplified a ~1700 bp
PCR product with MA1–MA2 conserved primers as
reported by our group [5] and recently by gene bank
(DQ009765.1), but did not amplify any band with DSsMA2 or DBs-MA2. All results; 18S rDNA gene size, fingerprinting profile and pigment production capacity, corroborated that LB1644 strain it is not "D. salina var Teod" n or
"D. salina/bardawil". In this case, more taxonomic and
molecular research must be done to identify this
Dunaliella specie. Absence of introns within 18S rDNA
gene is an inconvenience for Dunaliella species fingerprinting determination and identification. Fortunately, all
hyperproducer species known carry I or II introns within
the 18S rDNA gene. Gómez and González [4], have been
working with ITS sequences and some interesting results
have been presented that could help in primer design. In
addition, it seems to be the rule for hyperproducer species
of Dunaliella to have introns within 18S rDNA, thus "D.
salina var Teod" has I, D. salina/bardawil has II and D. parva
has II [11].
However, we did find a non carotenogenic strain in hypersaline environments that has two introns within the 18S
rDNA (data not shown). According to literature this strain
could be D. viridis. Gene Bank sequence analysis showed
a D. viridis strain (DQ009776) with an 18S rDNA gene
size of ~2500 bp approximately, which corresponds to the
size of the strain that we found. Species-specific primer
design must be done to molecularly characterize this
strain and, wheatear it is possible accomplish a fingerprint
profile of it.
Dunaliella gene bank sequence analysis
In the past four years there has been an explosion of 18S
rDNA gene sequence submissions at Gene Bank Data
Base. This sequence information is important to support
the intron-sizing method developed by our group and to
explain Dunaliellas differentiation and identification.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/5

Table 1 presents one species group of ~2500 bp which corresponds to Dunaliella species with two introns within the
18S rDNA gene. Interestingly, there are only one each of
D. parva, D. viridis and D. bardawil (salina/bardawil)
reported. It is important to remember that D. salina/
bardawil species from which we obtained the reported 18S
rDNA gene sequence was obtained from UTEX ten years
ago. BLAST comparison showed four species with enough
differences to distinguish between them and obtain an
exclusive fingerprinting profile for each one (data shown
only for D. salina/bardawil). D. parva β-carotene production capacity is at low levels. In addition, D. viridis does
not produce β-carotene but can grow in hypersaline environments. Unfortunately there is no report about β-carotene production from Dunaliella ABRII strain
(EU616729).
It would be very interesting to know its β-carotene production capacities, because this strain has its own fingerprinting profile, different from the ones presented by "D.
salina var Teod" and D. salina/bardawil (data not shown).
Table 1, also shows two other groups of Dunaliella strains
with an 18S rDNA gene size of ~2100 bp, indicating one
intron within the 18S rDNA gene. D. salina M84320 strain
from group I, reported by Wilcox and coworkers in 1992,
was used to design species-specific oligonucleotide (DSs),
due its β-carotene hyperproduction capacity [5]. The 18S
rDNA fingerprinting profile from M84320 was already
found in D. salina strains from around the world, and to
make its identification easier we call these strains "D.
salina var Teod" (data mentioned before). Furthermore, D.
salina var Teod strains hybridized 100% with DSs primer
[5'-GCAGGAGAGCTAATAGGA-3'] and hyperproduce βcarotene, data that corroborates and supports our fingerprinting results (data mentioned before).
In addition, DQ009777 strain from group I was reported
as D. bardawil, nevertheless this data disagrees with our
results for D. salina/bardawil where an 18S rDNA gene size
of ~2500 bp was found, instead of ~2100 bp as
DQ009777 had. In addition, this strain did not amplify
with the species-specific oligonucleotide (DBs) for D.
salina/bardawil, but amplified well with DSs specific primers to D. salina var Teod. However, DQ009777 strain
reported as D. bardawil by Buchheim is in agreement with
the result that we obtained from D. bardawil (LB2538)
strain obtained from UTEX in May of 2008. Nevertheless,
results obtained from β-carotene hyperproducer strains
isolated from hypersaline environments in Baja Mexico,
demonstrate that D. salina/bardawil with ~2500 bp 18S
rDNA gene size exist, amplify ~1000 bp PCR product with
DBs-MA2 and have an exclusive fingerprinting profile
(Fig. 3). These results are in agreement with fingerprinting
profile found to D. salina/bardawil (LB2538) obtained ten

years ago from UTEX. This comparison shows that D.
salina/bardawill from now it is not the same than 10 years
ago, in the culture collection bank.
On the other hand, even when D. salina (DQ324002)
group II strains have ~2100 bp 18S rDNA gene size as
group I had, they only hybridize 66% with DSs primer [5'GCtAcGtGAGAGCTAAgTAGGaAg-3'], change are shown in
subscript letters. Group II, therefore, belongs to a different

subgroup of "D. salina var Teod" strains. Unfortunately we
do not know if group II strains hyperproduce β-carotene.
In a personal communication Dr. Buchheim mentioned
that they also do not know about β-carotene production
capacity of these strains. It will be important to obtain
group II strains and test their β-carotene production
capacity. At this moment we know that group II Dunaliella
strains has a fingerprint of ~2100 bp with MA1–MA2 and
~750 bp with DSsII-MA2. DSsII (5-GAGAGCTAGCAGAG-

GGTAG-3) oligonucleotide was designed from a region
100% conserved among group II strains, using BLAST program from NCBI (data not shown).
Finally, Gene Bank BLAST analysis showed a group of
Dunaliella strains with ~1700 bp 18S rDNA gene size (data
not shown). However, these strains were not included for
group comparison because they do not have introns
within the 18S rDNA gene and do not produce β-carotene,
with the exception of the LB1644 Dunaliella strain. It is
important to remember that our fingerprint intron-sizing
method depends exclusively on introns within the 18S
rDNA gene.
Environmental strains
Morphological identification demonstrated that red environmental samples contained Dunaliella strains (data not
shown). Microscopic species differentiation was not possible due great visual similarities among Dunaliella species. Molecular characterization was carried out to obtain
18S rDNA fingerprinting profile from isolated strains.
Standard PCR protocol using 18S rDNA gene conserved
primers [5,11], was successfully utilized to amplify target
rDNA region from the isolated Dunaliella strains. Two different sizes of DNA products were found in PCR reactions,
using the same pair of conserved primers. Fragments
around ~2500 bp long were found in samples coming
from San Quintín B.C. In addition, fragments around
~2100 bp long were found in samples from La Salina (Fig.
4). In previous works, Wilcox and coworkers in 1992

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/5/1/5

demonstrated that microalgae strains with two introns
inside 18S rDNA have a gene size of ~2500 bp long. Additionally, the same work showed that strains with one
intron within the 18S rDNA have a gene size of ~2100 bp
long. In this sense, PCR products amplified from red
lagoons in Baja, Mexico, belong to D. salina/bardawil
(~2500 bp) and "D. salina var Teod" (~2100 bp) respectively [5,11].
PCR identification with 18S rDNA specific primers
To corroborate the presence of the most biotechnologically important Dunaliella species in isolated samples, a
standard PCR protocol was carried out with species-specific D. salina/bardawil (DBs-MA2) and "D. salina var Teod"
(DSs-MA2) primers. Because introns of the 18S rDNA
gene represent the highest sequence divergence in
Dunaliella [11,12], specific-primers were designed from
them. As we expected, using DBs-MA2 and DSs-MA2 pairs
of primers, two different DNA products were found in
PCR reactions. Fragments around 1000 bp long were
found in samples coming from San Quintín. These results
corroborates D. salina/bardawil presence in red environmental samples coming from this place (Fig. 4) On the
other hand, fragments around 700 bp long were found in
samples coming from La Salina, corroborating the presence of "D. salina var Teod" in the sample mentioned
above (Fig. 4). Results obtained with conserved and specific primers match and corroborate presences of D.
salina/bardawil and "D. salina var Teod" in the environmental samples.
Sequencing 18S rDNA genes
The PCR product of around 2500 bp coming from the San
Quintín sample using MA1–MA2 conserved primers was
sequenced and aligned. BLAST results indicated that D.
salina/bardawil reported (AF150905), matched 99% with
our sequence. In addition, a ~2100 bp long PCR product
amplified from the sample coming from La Salina was
sequenced and aligned. BLAST results corroborated "D.
salina var Teod" reported (M84320) matched 99% with
our sequence.

β-carotene quantification
Cell counts gave around 1–3 × 104 cells/ml in samples
analyzed using a Neubauer chamber. Salt saturation was
evident due to crystal precipitation. Red pigmentation was
observed with high intensity, indicating great amounts of
β-carotene (data not shown). Temperatures differed
according to locations, being cooler in the North part of
the Peninsula (20°C), than in the South (22°C). β-carotene quantification of the molecularly identified
Dunaliella strains was developed according to conditions
mentioned in materials and methods. β-carotene production reached almost same levels in all Dunaliella strains
analyzed (~10 pg/cell).

Conclusion
Using our intron-sizing method we demonstrated that "D.
salina var Teod" and D. salina/bardawil are two different
species of Dunaliella that could easily be differentiated by
size and sequence of the 18S rDNA gene (Fig. 5). These
two species of Dunaliella produce nearly same amounts
and profile of carotenoids, but they are difficult to distinguish phenotypically. More work in taxonomic identification must be done to classify D. salina/bardawil as D.
bardawil as "D. salina var Bardal" or with another name.
Table 1, shows three groups of Dunaliella strains. The first
group belongs to Dunaliella with two introns and approximately 2500 bp 18S rDNA gene size. Four strains had species-specific sequence differentiation between them and
as a consequence a species-specific fingerprinting profile
for each one (data shown only for D. salina/bardawil).
Table 1 also shows two groups of Dunaliella strains with
approximately 2100 bp 18S rDNA gene size. According to
our results strains with that size contain only one intron
within the 18S rDNA gene, and are classified as D. salina
strains. Group I D. salina strains (M84320 group) were
called "D. salina var Teod", because all strains share 100%
sequence conservation with DSs specific oligonucleotide,
growth on hypersaline environments and hyperproduce
β-carotene. In addition, these strains had been found
around the world and all share the same fingerprinting
profile (see results and discussion section).

A second subgroup of D. salina strains called group II
(DQ324002 group), was identified from Gene Bank
sequence analysis (data not shown). More work must be
done to known their β-carotene production capacity.
Additionally, even when strains of group II had the same
18S rDNA gene size, as group I did, they only maintain
66% sequence conservation with "D. salina var Teod" specific oligonucleotide (DSs).
On the other hand, D. salina/bardawil obtained ten years
ago from UTEX it is not the same strain found presently in
the culture collection bank. However, a D. salina/bardawil
strain with the original fingerprinting profile was found in
San Quintín, B.C. Mexico ten years ago and also during
this work.
It is important to point out that although culture collection banks may have some cross-contamination, as do
collections of some researchers around the world (results
and discussion), it is not our intention to point out cross
contamination or incorrect affiliation of Dunaliella species. Nevertheless, we want to provide an auxiliary
method for rapid, precise and specific identification of
Dunaliella species.
Since our first report in 2002 on differentiation of carotenogenic Dunaliella species by the introns sizing method
[11], we have refined, corroborated and deeply advanced
the molecular differentiation of Dunaliella species by the

fingerprinting profile method. Actually, it is the only
method that has been tested on both collection bank
strains as well as field samples, that allows proper identification of the physiologically plastic strains of Dunaliella
at the level of species.

Methods
Type strains
Dunaliella salina CCAP 19/18 sample was obtained from
Sams Research Services LTD, and it was originally isolated
from Hypersaline Brines, Hutt Lagoon, Western Australia.

Dunaliella salina/bardawil was obtained from UTEX
(LB2538) ten years ago. This strain was isolated from
Bardawil lagoon. A strain with the same 18S rDNA fingerprinting profile and β-carotene production capacity was
isolated from Baja California, Mexico [11].
D. salina 19/30 was obtained from sams algae collection.
This strain was isolated from Bardawil lagoon. D. salina
(LB1644) was obtained from UTEX.
Sample cells were used for morphological identification
as Dunaliella strains and for molecular characterization as
Dunaliella species. Cells were counted and harvested at
10,000 r.p.m. for 5 minutes. β-carotene production capacity of strains was evaluated by High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (data not shown).
Environmental strains
Two locations in Baja California peninsula of Mexico were
selected for water-sample collection (Fig. 1). Environmental samples were obtained using 50 ml plastic tubes from
red hypersaline waters between May and September 2006.
Red microalgae strains present in those samples were
morphologically identified as Dunaliella strains and then
were molecularly characterized. Sample cells were
counted and harvested at 10,000 r.p.m. for 5 minutes. βcarotene production capacity of strains was evaluated by
HPLC.
DNA purification and PCR amplifications
Isolation of chromosomal DNA from Dunaliella strains
was carried out by the method utilized for Escherichia coli
[16]. MA1 [5'-CGGGATCCGTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTC-3']
and MA2 [5-GGAATTCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACC-3'] conserved and DSs (D. salina) [5'-GCAGGAGAGCTAATAGGA-3']
and
DBs
(D.
salina/bardawil)
[5'GGGAGTCTTTTTCCACCT-3'] specific oligonucleotides,
were designed from 18S rDNA genes and were previously
reported by Olmos and coworkers [5,11]. In those works
exons were used to design MA1 and MA2 conserved primers. In addition, DSs and DBs specific primers were
designed from intron I, where most variable sequence is
contained. PCR reactions were carried out in a total vol-

ume of 100 μl containing 50 ng of chromosomal DNA in
TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer, pH 8 [16] and 200 ng MA1 and
MA2 conserved primers. The amplification was carried
out using 25 cycles in a GeneE thermocycler, with a Tm of
52°C to all reactions. One cycle consisted of 1 minute at
95°C, 1 minute at 52°C and 2 minute at 72°C. PCRs with
specific primers were combined with MA2 conserved
primer (DSs-MA2, DBs-MA2) and reactions were carried
out under same conditions.
Sequencing and alignment
MA1–MA2 PCR products from Dunaliella species were utilized to carry out a sequencing reactions, using previously
reported Seq1 (5'-GGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAG-3'), Seq2
(5'-CCGGGCATTTTTGTCTGG-3'), Seq3 (5'-CTGCCAGCACCTTATGAG-3'),
Seq4
(5'-GGGAGGATTGACAGATTG-3') and Seq5 (5'-GGAAGGAGAAGTCGTAAC-3')
primers. DNA sequences were imported to BLAST for
strains identification and to MegAlign program from
DNAStar, to search for phylogenetic relationship correlations between them. Dunaliella Gene Bank sequences
comparison analysis was carried out with BLAST program
using 18S rDNA genes with ~2500, ~2100 and ~1700 bp.

β-carotene purification and HPLC quantification
One ml samples were centrifuged at 10,000 r.p.m. for 5
minutes, supernatant was discarded, and pellets were
homogenized and disrupted in one ml of methanol. Samples were incubated on ice for one hour in the dark, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm 5 minutes, filtered and kept at 20°C until HPLC analysis.
Filtered samples and commercial standards were analyzed
with an 1100 Hewlett Packard HPLC, using a 5 μm reverse
phase 300SB-C18 Zorbax column 15 cm long, and 100%
isocratic methanol elution with 0.5 ml/minute flux,
throughout 25 minutes.
