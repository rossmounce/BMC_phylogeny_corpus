Abstract
Background: Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection might transmit viremic units into the public blood supply if
only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) testing is used for donor screening. Our aim was to evaluate the
prevalence of occult HBV infection among the HBsAg negative/antiHBc positive donations from a highly HIV
prevalent region of India.
Methods: A total of 729 HBsAg negative donor units were included in this study. Surface gene and precore region
were amplified by in house nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of occult HBV infection and surface gene was
analyzed after direct sequencing.
Results: A total of 220 (30.1%) HBsAg negative donors were antiHBc positive, of them 66 (30%) were HBV DNA
positive by NAT. HBV DNA positivity among 164 antiHBc only group, was 27.1% and among 40 antiHBs positive
group was 30.0%. HBV/D (93.3%) was predominant and prevalence of both HBV/C and HBV/A was 3.3%. Single or
multiple amino acids substitutions were found in 95% samples.
Conclusion: Thus, a considerable number of HBV infected donors remain undiagnosed, if only HBsAg is used for
screening. Addition of antiHBc testing for donor screening, although will lead to rejection of a large number of
donor units, will definitely eliminate HBV infected donations and help in reducing HBV transmission with its
potential consequences, especially among the immunocompromised population. The HBV genetic diversity found
in this donor population are in accordance with other parts of India.

Background
Detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in
blood is diagnostic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
In the blood bank, screening for HBsAg is carried out
routinely to detect HBV infection. Notably, donations
from donors in seroconversion stage, from chronic HBV
carriers with low circulating HBsAg level as well as

from donors infected with some mutant HBV, may not
be detected by the currently employed HBsAg assays.
Thus among the common blood borne virus infections
the risk of transfusion transmitted infection is highest
for HBV [1]. Use of sensitive molecular assays has led to
the detection of potentially infectious HBV DNA in the
liver, serum, or both, in individuals without detectable
HBsAg in circulation and has been termed “occult HBV
infection” (OBI). It has often been explained by low
levels of HBV DNA or mutations in the ‘a’ determinant

region, (which contains a dominant B-cell epitope for
anti HBs response), or undetectable HBsAg in circulation [2]. High frequencies of HBV DNA positivity have
been described among antiHBc only sera, when antiHBc
is the only seromarkers for HBV infection, in absence of
antiHBs or HBsAg [3].
India has an estimated, more than 40 million chronic
carriers [4]. Despite testing for HBsAg in blood donors,
transfusion-associated HBV continues to be a major
problem in India, especially among multiply transfused
patients [5]. In India, detection of HBV infection among
blood donors is carried out by HBsAg screening by
commercial enzyme immuno assay. However, this strategy has sometimes failed due to the presence of occult
HBV infection.
According to National AIDS control organization
(NACO) reports (2008) Ganjam district in Orissa,
southeastern India is amongst one of the highest HIV
prevalent districts of India. Although the route of transmission of HIV and HBV are the same, data on HBV
prevalence from southeastern Indian region is rare. Only
one study on HBV infection was reported from Orissa,
which deals with the prevalence of HBsAg among the
blood donors and reported 1.13% HBsAg positivity [6].
Occurrence of OBI varies in different parts of India
(from 0% in Chandigarh to 21% in Kolkata) [5,7-9]; but
it has not been assessed from highly HIV prevalent Ganjam district. Furthermore, occult HBV infection has
been linked at least in part to the genetic diversity of
the viral Strains [10]; but data on HBV variability in
blood donors from this region is not yet available.
Understanding HBV evolution and strain diversity in the
blood donor population could help to devise a better
screening strategy for blood donors and help in developing more efficient ELISA method [11].
HBV has been classified into nine serotypes, ayw
(ayw1, ayw2, ayw3 and ayw4), ayr, adw (adw2 and
adw4), adr, and eight genotypes from A to H on the
basis of complete genome and partial S gene sequence
analysis [12-15]. The genotype distribution pattern in
India is heterogeneous; HBV/D is the most predominant
genotype across the country. In northern India, HBV/A
and HBV/D are reportedly present in almost equal proportion [16], even though a recent study [17] showed a
predominance of HBV/D similar to that documented
from southern [18] and western [19] parts of India.
Interestingly, in eastern India, although HBV/D is predominant & HBV/A as well as HBV/C is also reported
in considerable proportion among blood donors [20,21].
In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of
anti-HBC positivity in blood donations from Berhampur.
Furthermore we also wanted to estimate the frequency
of HBV-DNA in antiHBc-positive donations and distributation of HBV genotype/subgenotype along with

mutations in S-gene region, to assess whether supplemental antiHBc testing may bring additional safety to
blood products.

Materials and methods
Study subjects

The Red Cross blood bank in the city of Behrampur is
the only blood bank in Ganjam district. It collects blood
units from voluntary blood donation camps covering the
most parts of the district. From December 2008 to July
2009, 729 HBsAg negative samples were collected from
the Red Cross blood bank, Berhampur, Ganjam in
Orissa for this study. The samples were from both
urban and rural areas.
Serological analysis

HBsAg (Biomerieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands), antiHBs
and antiHBc (Hepanostika anti-HBc Uni-Form, Biomerieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands) were tested by commercial ELISA. All the AntiHBc positive samples were
tested repeatedly and only those which have given
repeated positive result were considered as antiHBc
positive. Samples positive for either anti-HCV (OrthoClinical Diagnostics, NJ, USA) and/or antiHIV (Biomerieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands) were excluded from the
study. Sera from patients were stored at -80°C, and are
thawed once for serological examinations. The study
was approved by Institutional ethical committee.
Serum HBV DNA isolation, detection, sequencing,
quantification

An in house nucleic acid tests (NAT) to directly detect
the presence of HBV DNA using a combination of
amplification and detection techniques similar to HCV
RNA was employed [22]. HBV DNA isolation and
amplification by in house NAT were done from surface
region as described earlier [21,23]. Guidelines for avoiding false positive results [24] were followed strictly.
Samples repeatedly positive for HBV DNA by surface
gene amplification, were directly sequenced using Big
Dye Terminator mix and a model ABI PRISM 3100xl
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) as
described previously [21]. Viral load was measured by
using the real time Taqman PCR assay (Applied Biosystems SDS 7000, Foster City, USA) with lower detection
limit 102 copies [25].
Sequence analysis

The amino acids (aa 64-160) of the immunodominant
region of the 60 HBsAg (-) isolates were compared
with the reference sequences of each genotype. Genotypes/subgenotypes were ascertained as described by
Norder et al. (2004) [13] and Banerjee et al. (2006)
[20].

Results
Prevalence of occult infection

The demographic, serological and virological characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 729 (691 male, 38
female, mean age 33.3 ± 9.9) tested HBsAg negative
were included in the study. The majority of the blood
donors were males. Among them 220 (30.1%) were
found to be antiHBc positive, of whom 66 (30%) were
HBV DNA positive by nested PCR for surface region.
Among 220 antiHBc positive donors 40 (18.2%) were
antiHBs positive and 164 (74.5%) were anti-HBs negative. Among antiHBs positive donors, who are supposedly protected against HBV infection, 12/40 (30.0%)
were HBV DNA positive. Furthermore, a significantly
higher percentage of HBV DNA positivity (46.6%)
among younger age group (age = 18-25) donors was
observed (data not shown). When these samples were
further subjected to PCR amplification using primers for

precore region, only 23/65 (35.3%) samples were found
to be positive. Among the 66 HBV DNA positive samples, viral load could be estimated in 40 samples because
of insufficient samples. Most of the samples in which
HBV viral load could be estimated, have <104 copies/ml.
Genotype/Subgenotype Distributation

A total of 60 amplicons from the 66 HBV DNA positive
samples could be sequenced and analyzed for genotyping. Phylogenetic analysis showed three genotypes
(HBV/A, HBV/C, HBV/D) circulating in the study population (fig 1). HBV/D (94.3%) was predominant, in addition HBV/C (3.3%) and HBV/A (3.3%) (Table 1) was
also detected. HBV/D was highly divergent and distributed mainly in three sub genotypes, HBV/D1, HBV/D2
and HBV/D3. Subgenotype D3 was most frequent
among these occult HBV cases (n = 43). On the other
hand, only one subgenotype of genotype A (HBV/A1

(Aa)) and one subgenotype C (HBV/C1 (Cs)) was found.
HBV/A, subtype adw2 and HBV/D, subtype ayw2 and
ayw3 from the present study clustered with the genotype
A and D sequences previously reported from India.
Similar to Eastern India, genotype C isolates with adr
subtype from southeastern India clustered with HBV/Cs
subgroup found in South East Asian countries rather
than subgenotype Ce found in the Far East like China,
Japan, and Korea.
Amino acids substitutions in surface gene

Variability of surface gene in 60 HBsAg (-ve)/AntiHBc
(+ve) individuals were studied (aa 64-163). Among
HBsAg (-) samples, single or multiple amino acids substitutions were found in 57 of 60 samples (95.0%). The
most common amino acid substitution found within
MHL region was T125 M (42/45, 93.3%), mostly in
HBV/D3. Other substitutions at codon G71 D, L95 S,

M103I, P111L, S113A, S114P, T115I, T116P, S117G,
T118R, A128V, T127A and were also found. Moreover,
few novel substitutions, not reported previously, were
detected among HBsAg (-) samples. Subtype ayw3 was
more frequent than ayw2 among HBV/D samples. Subtype could not be ascertained in one genotype D
sequence (BB67) due to substitution present at 127
amino acid position.
A stop codon found in one sample in HBV/D with a
presence of single nucleotide substitution from thymidine (T) to adenosine (A) at 207th nucleotide (nucleotide position 362 from the unique Eco RI site) of the
HBsAg ORF. Deduced amino acid sequence of the corresponding substitution showed a change from TGT
(cysteine) to TGA (stop) at amino acid position 69 of
HBsAg. Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene revealed
that isolate is HBV/D, subgenotype D2 and subtype
ayw3.

Discussion
In India screening for HBsAg by ELISA is at present the
only mandatory test for detection of HBV infection in
blood donations. Several reports around the world
showed detection of HBV DNA in blood of HBsAgnegative individuals and suggested transmission of HBV
infection by blood transfusion from HBsAg negative
occult HBV carriers [26,27]. Thus, evaluation of other
HBV markers might reduce these risks.
Varying prevalence of antiHBc, a marker for exposure
to HBV infection, has been reported from different parts
of India; ranging between 8%-18% of total donor population. In the present study from Behrampur, Ganjam in
Orissa, about 30.1% of total donations (220 of 729) was
antiHBc positive indicating a very high rate of exposure
to HBV infection among the blood donors from this
region.
The Ganjam district in the state of Orissa in southeastern India records very high rate of migration in
search of livelihood. Among the 3.1 million people living
in 24 blocks in the district, people from 22 blocks
depend on migration for their income [28]. Here, the
men remain away from home for eight to nine months
at a stretch, in their sexually most active period [28].
This also leads to a number of women left in Ganjam
being involved in promiscuous habits [28]. This unusual
matrix puts migrants and their families at risk of sexually transmitted infections at various points [28]. Notably around 50 per cent of the HIV positive people in
Orissa are from Ganjam and most of them are migrant
labourers and there is high prevalence of HIV among
antenatal clinic attendees (3.25%), [28]. Thus, the high
rate of antiHBc prevalence, indicating exposure to HBVa sexually transmitted infection, among the blood
donors of Ganjam district is not unusual.
Prevalence of occult HBV infection was also high
among antiHBc positive donations from the present
study, 30% percent of antiHBc positive donations (66/
220) being HBV DNA positive. Furthermore, among the
220 antiHBc positive donations 40 were antiHBs positive
and are supposedly protected against HBV infection.
Notably, 12/40 (30.0%) of antiHBs positive donations
were HBV DNA positive, even one of them was with
viral load ≥104 copies/ml. Among the 164 antiHBc only
donors, 45 (27%) were HBV DNA positive (Table 1).
The higher proportion of OBI found among the younger
group (18-24 & 25-34) bears special significance as they
are in the sexually active group and might possibly be
related to the problem of frequent migration for livelihood. However, this requires further study.
The frequency of occult HBV infection varied considerably from different parts of the world according to the
prevalence of HBV in the population. Prevalence of OBI

Page 5 of 7

is high in high HBV prevalence zone of the world and
low in low HBV prevalence zone of the world. Studies
from other parts of India reported occult HBV infection
ranging from 21% in Kolkata (Eastern India), 20.87% in
New Delhi (Northern India) to 0% in Chandigarh
(Northwestern India) [7-9]. A study from Japan [29]
reported DNA positivity of 38% in 19 of 50 anti-HBc
reactive samples. While that from North America found
3.7%, HBV DNA positive among 107 anti-HBc positive/
anti-HBs negative samples [30]. Notably due to the low
viral load in majority of these samples, detection of OBI
required sensitive DNA amplification techniques.
There is increasing evidence that OBI is associated with
chronic liver disease and HCC [31,32], in addition to
being a source of transmission of HBV by blood transfusion or orthotropic liver transplantation [33]. Therefore,
the high rate of OBI among blood donors of Ganjam
district is of serious concern. As these donors have the
potential to transmit HBV contaminated blood through
the public blood supply even after donor screening for
HBsAg. Thus, our data indicates OBI as an emerging
infection hindering safety of blood transfusion in this
community. Ideally, HBsAg negative individuals who are
either antiHBc negative or those who are antiHBc positive/antiHBs positive/HBV DNA negative should be
selected as regular blood donors to minimize transmission due to occult hepatitis B infection. This will help in
the reduction of the transfusion associated transmission
due to OBI; but will increase the testing costs.
Routine blood donor screening for antiHBc has been
implemented in some countries resulting in a decrease
in the risk of post-transfusion HBV infection [30].
Hence, in our resource poor setting, inclusion of
antiHBc testing for donor screening will definitely
remove possible HBV infected donations. Thus though a
large number of donations will be rejected, but rejection
of these donations will be valuable in reducing the risk
of HBV transmission with its potential consequences,
particularly among immunocompromised recipients.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that although HBV/D
with subgenotype HBV/D2, HBV/D3 was predominant
among OBI cases in this population, HBV/Cs, HBV/Aa
and HBV/D1 were also present; this is in accordance
with previous reports from other parts of India
[20,21,34]. Interestingly, similar to eastern and northern
India HBV/D3 was predominant among OBI cases while
this subgenotype was mainly found among drug addicts
of Europe [35]. The most common amino acid substitution found within MHL region was T125 M (44/60),
T118V (11/60) and A128V (11/60) found in HBV/D2
and HBV/D3. A stop codon was found in HBV/D2 at
position 69th amino acid which results in a truncated
HBsAg gene lacking the total ‘a’ determinant region,

Panigrahi et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:204
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/204

which might be a reason for HBsAg negativity making
the surface gene nonfunctional. This mutation was previously documented in subgenotype D1 [36]. Only one
sample had M133T substitution in genotype HBV/D,
previously described to be associated with diagnostic
and vaccine failure [37]. None of the other substitutions
found were known to interfere in HBsAg assay. Consequently, a low HBV viral load seems the most likely
explanation for our HBsAg negative/DNA positive samples. Some of these had substitutions that also caused
amino acid mutations in the overlapping reverse transcriptase (RT) domain in the pol gene; therefore, the
typically low level of HBV DNA observed in occult HBV
infections, may be related to the mutation in RT domain
which in turn resulted in low level of protein synthesis,
as reported from eastern India [38].
In conclusion, our study underscores the high rate of
exposure of HBV to the blood donors of Behrampur,
Ganjam, a high HIV prevalent district of India. One in
every 11 blood donors who are HBsAg negative/
antiHBc-positive and one in every 3 antiHBc positive/
antiHBs positive donors, have OBI, with possibility of
transmission of HBV to transfusion recipients. Our
results suggest inclusion of antiHBc testing for donor
screening. Although addition of antiHBc testing, will
lead to rejection of a large number of donor units; it
will definitely eliminate HBV infected donations. This
will help in reducing transfusion associated transmission
due to OBI in this resource poor setting with its potential consequences, especially among the immunocompromised population. The significance of high rate of
OBI should be monitored by further studies to evaluate
the transmissibility and infectivity of OBI by blood
transfusion. These data might lead to improvements in
donor screening in the blood banks of India.
