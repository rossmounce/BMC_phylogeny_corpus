Abstract
Background: Pedomorphism is the retention of ancestrally juvenile traits by adults in a descendant taxon. Despite
its importance for evolutionary change, there are few examples of a molecular basis for this phenomenon.
Notothenioids represent one of the best described species flocks among marine fishes, but their diversity is
currently threatened by the rapidly changing Antarctic climate. Notothenioid evolutionary history is characterized
by parallel radiations from a benthic ancestor to pelagic predators, which was accompanied by the appearance of
several pedomorphic traits, including the reduction of skeletal mineralization that resulted in increased buoyancy.
Results: We compared craniofacial skeletal development in two pelagic notothenioids, Chaenocephalus aceratus
and Pleuragramma antarcticum, to that in a benthic species, Notothenia coriiceps, and two outgroups, the
threespine stickleback and the zebrafish. Relative to these other species, pelagic notothenioids exhibited a delay in
pharyngeal bone development, which was associated with discrete heterochronic shifts in skeletal gene expression
that were consistent with persistence of the chondrogenic program and a delay in the osteogenic program during
larval development. Morphological analysis also revealed a bias toward the development of anterior and ventral
elements of the notothenioid pharyngeal skeleton relative to dorsal and posterior elements.
Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that early shifts in the relative timing of craniofacial skeletal gene
expression may have had a significant impact on the adaptive radiation of Antarctic notothenioids into pelagic habitats.

Background
Antarctic notothenioids are endemic to the Southern
Ocean and probably evolved in situ from a sluggish,
benthic perciform species beginning 40-60 Mya in the
then temperate waters of the Antarctic continental shelf
[1]. With the opening of the Drake Passage (~34-30
Mya), the establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current, and a sharp drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, the Southern Ocean became thermally isolated, began to cool, and attained its present frigid
temperatures (-2 to +2°C) by the mid-Miocene (14-10
Mya) [1-8]. The rich, shallow-water, temperate fish
fauna characteristic of the late Eocene (38 Mya) became
largely extinct due to habitat destruction and changes in
trophic structure, thus freeing ecological niches into
which the notothenioids radiated [4].

The hallmark of the Antarctic notothenioid radiation
is the evolution of secondary pelagicism, which is prominent in the family Nototheniidae [1] and common in
the family Channichthyidae [9,10]. About 50% of
notothenioid species now either live in or actively
exploit pelagic habitats [11]. A significant obstacle facing
notothenioids as they radiated into pelagic habitats was
the ancestral absence of a swim bladder, the gas-filled
chamber that most teleosts use to maintain buoyancy.
In pelagic notothenioids, natural selection favored compensatory changes in the musculoskeletal system to
achieve neutral buoyancy, including the replacement of
densely mineralized bone with cartilage and connective
tissue, decreased bone mineralization, and the accumulation of lipid deposits in muscle and connective tissues.
Changes in habitat were also accompanied by the evolution of distinct oral jaw morphologies and body shapes
that accommodate shifts in diet and foraging behavior
[12,13]. Trophic evolution among notothenioids resulted
in two distinct pelagic ecotypes: true pelagics and

benthopelagics [13]. True pelagics spend most of their
time in the water column where they feed on microinvertebrates. They possess relatively short, protractile
jaws for suction feeding and have few, large oral teeth
arranged along a single tooth row (e.g., the Antarctic silverfish, Pleuragramma antarcticum). In contrast,
benthopelagics spend much of their time on or close to
the ocean floor but venture into the pelagic zone to forage on schools of small fish and macroinvertebrates.
Most benthopelagic notothenioids have non-protractile,
elongate jaws, a wide gape, and many, small oral teeth
(e.g., the blackfin icefish, Chaenocephalus aceratus).
This morphology enables benthopelagics to feed efficiently on krill and schools of small fishes by expanding
their buccal cavity, and overtaking and sifting large
mouthfuls of prey (e.g., ram feeding). Extant benthic
notothenioids preserve the ancestral condition, exhibiting robust skeletons and heavily fortified jaws bearing
several rows of large teeth (e.g., the yellowbelly rockcod,
Notothenia coriiceps).
Notothenioids achieved secondary pelagicism by pedomorphism, the retention of ancestrally juvenile traits by
adults in a descendant taxon [11]. Pedomorphism arises
from heterochronic processes that alter the schedule of
developmental events [14]. Striking examples of pedomorphic characters in pelagic and benthopelagic
notothenioids include delayed and reduced skeletal ossification, retention of the notochord, reduced numbers of
teeth and tooth rows, and reduction of the pterygoid
process of the palatoquadrate [13,15-17].
As a first step toward understanding the molecular
mechanisms that underlie skeletal reduction and morphological change in this group, we characterized early
craniofacial development in a true pelagic species, P.
antarcticum (family Nototheniidae), and a benthopelagic
species, C. aceratus (family Channichthyidae). We
describe shared derived aspects of craniofacial development in pelagic notothenioids that differ significantly
from those observed in a benthic notothenioid species,
N. coriiceps (family Nototheniidae), another percomorph
species, Gasterosteus aculeatus (threespine stickleback,
family Gasterosteidae), and a more distantly related outgroup, Danio rerio (zebrafish, family Cyprinidae). We
found that pelagic notothenioid larvae exhibit a delay in
osteogenic development, and that this heterochronic
shift is associated with altered gene expression, including delayed expression of the osteogenic markers, col1a1
and col10a1, and prolonged expression of the cartilage
differentiation gene, col2a1. These data provide a discrete molecular inroad into the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of this pedomorphic character. We also
show that other changes in the patterning of the
notothenioid trophic apparatus are due to apparent
shifts in the relative timing of development of particular

skeletal elements. These data are consistent with the
hypothesis that heterochronic shifts in early craniofacial
skeletal development have played significant roles in the
adaptive diversification of Antarctic notothenioids.

Results and Discussion
Development of skeletal mineralization is delayed in
Antarctic fish

Skeletal preparations were made of pelagic notothenioid
larvae beginning at developmental stages just before
hatching and continuing until just before yolk absorption and the onset of exogenous feeding (see Additional
file 1), and compared to those of the benthic notothenioid and outgroup species. The results showed that
pelagic notothenioid pharyngeal skeletons lack any
mineralized tissues at developmental stages during
which other species have begun to differentiate a wellformed bony skeleton (Fig. 1). Formation of mineralized
tissue was not detected using Alizarin red staining,
although developing cartilages had accumulated Alcianstaining cartilaginous material. We conclude that bone
mineralization is delayed in developing pelagic, osteopenic Antarctic notothenioid embryos relative to outgroup
fishes. To investigate the molecular genetic basis for this
delayed ossification, we cloned and examined the developmental expression of genes involved in skeletal matrix
formation.
Nucleotide sequence similarity and phylogenetic
reconstruction of collagen genes

To examine the expression of genes directing cartilage
and bone formation, we cloned notothenioid derived collagen genes specific for the development of cartilage
(col2a1) and bone (col1a1 and col10a1). The predicted
amino acid sequence similarities among fishes were similar for all three collagen genes, with highest identities
exhibited between the two notothenioids, the osteopenic
C. aceratus and the strongly mineralized N. coriiceps
(97%, 100%, and 95% for col1a1, col2a1b, and col10a1,
respectively), whereas the lowest identities were generally
found between fishes and tetrapod outgroups (chicken,
human). The exception to this pattern was col2a1b, in
which the D. rerio ortholog was the most highly divergent
sequence for all comparisons, including tetrapods. The
nucleotide sequences of col2a1b from Chaenocephalus
and Notothenia differed at only two of 219 positions, a
remarkably low rate of synonymous substitution in two
lineages thought to have separated approximately 24 Mya
[18]. Phylogenetic trees reflected accepted relationships
among fish species, with Danio the most distantly related
lineage to the Takifugu + (Gasterosteus + (Chaenocephalus +Notothenia) clade (Fig. 2A-C). D. rerio col2a1b
exhibited an exceptionally long branch relative to other
orthologs in this tree, reflecting accelerated amino acid
sequence divergence in this lineage.

Altered patterns of gene expression underlie reduced
mineralization in pelagic notothenioid larvae

We observed prolonged developmental expression of the
early cartilage marker col2a1 and reduced expression of
the later developmental markers col10a1 and col1a1 in
pelagic notothenioid larvae as compared to similarly
staged stickleback and zebrafish. By 11 and 5 days postfertilization (dpf), respectively, stickleback and zebrafish
larvae exhibited very little col2a1 expression in the pharyngeal skeleton (Fig. 3C and 3D). In contrast, both pelagic
notothenioid species exhibited strong expression of this
cartilage marker through extended periods of larval development (Fig. 3A and 3B). The hypertrophic cartilage marker, col10a1, is normally expressed in terminally

differentiated chondrocytes just before apoptosis and the
onset of endochondral ossification [19]. This marker was
discretely expressed throughout the pharyngeal skeleton
in stickleback and zebrafish (Fig. 3G and 3H) but was limited to the cleithrum (cl) of the pectoral girdle, and to the
upper and lower jaws (i.e., ectopterygoid, ept; Meckel's
cartilage, me) in pelagic notothenioids (Fig. 3E and 3F).
The osteoblast differentiation marker col1a1 was likewise
ubiquitously expressed throughout the pharyngeal skeleton in both stickleback and zebrafish larvae (Fig. 3K and
3L). The same marker was only weakly expressed in the
pharyngeal skeleton of the benthopelagic notothenioid, C.
aceratus, and was virtually absent from the pelagic species, P. antarcticum (Fig. 3I and 3J).

expression is relatively weak or absent in the notothenioids. The tree represents the evolutionary relationship among species. Abbreviations:

This pattern of delayed osteogenic gene expression
was also evident in sectioned specimens (Fig. 4). Pelagic
notothenioids exhibited strong col2a1 gene expression
throughout the ceratohyal cartilage (ch, Fig. 4A and
4D), whereas in similarly staged stickleback and zebrafish col2a1 expression was restricted to the proximal
and distal ends of this skeletal element (Fig. 4G and 4J).
Expression of col10a1 was absent from the ceratohyal
cartilage in notothenioid larvae (Fig. 4B and 4E), but
was strongly expressed in the putative hypertrophic
domain of the ceratohyal in stickleback and zebrafish
(Fig. 4H and 4K). Likewise, strong expression of col1a1
was observed in the perichondrium surrounding the ceratohyal cartilage in both stickleback and zebrafish (Fig.
4I and 4L), while only weak perichondrial col1a1 expression was observed in notothenioid larvae (Fig. 4C and
4F). Although only single representative staged specimens are presented here, the observed trends were consistent over extended periods of larval development. In

toto, these data are consistent with a delay in the osteogenic developmental program relative to the chondrogenic program in the two pelagic notothenioid species,
relative to the other fishes examined.
In contrast to the pharyngeal skeleton, the development of the appendicular skeleton was relatively conserved among fish species (Fig. 5). In all species
examined, col2a1 expression was observed in the scapulocoracoid (co), col10a1 was expressed in the cleithrum
(cl), and col1a1 expression was observed in the fin fold
(ff). The only notable difference among species was
strong expression of col10a1 in the endochondral disk
(ed) of C. aceratus (Fig. 5E). We did not observe expression of col10a1 in this tissue in the other species at any
stage, and expression of this marker appeared in the fins
of C. aceratus only at later stages of larval development.
The implications of potential novel gene expression in
the fins of certain notothenioid species are interesting
given the importance of fins in the adaptive radiation of

whereas col2a1 expression is restricted to the distal ends of the cartilage in both G. aculeatus (G) and D. rerio (J). The col10a1 gene is expressed
in hypertrophic chondrocytes in the ch in G. aculeatus (H) and D. rerio (K), whereas its expression is absent from the ch in P. antarcticum (B) and
C. aceratus (E). The col1a1 gene is weakly expressed in the periosteum around the ch of both P. antarcticum (C) and C. aceratus (F) relative to

this group [12], but the anatomical consequences of this
expression pattern are not yet known.
These data suggest a tradeoff between the chondrogenic and osteogenic programs during craniofacial (but
not appendicular) skeletal development. Skeletal development is highly conserved among vertebrates, and
pathways leading to either cartilage or bone formation
are tightly linked. Condensing cartilage progenitor cells
express sox9, which regulates col2a1 expression [20,21]
and is necessary and sufficient for cartilage differentiation [22-24]. Osteoprogenitor cells express runx2, which
modulates the expression of bone matrix genes including col1a1 and is necessary and sufficient for bone formation [23,25]. Both sox9 and runx2 can be expressed
in the same cells, and it is the relative amount of each
that specifies cell fate [23]. Runx2 binds to col10a1 and
ihh promoters [25] to activate their expression in terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes [19,26].
Secreted ihh stimulates surrounding perichondrial osteoblasts to secrete Pthrp [27], which diffuses back to prehypertrophic chondrocytes, binds to its receptor Pth1r,
and blocks further chondrocyte maturation. Thus, pedomorphic bone development and changes in collagen
gene expression patterns in pelagic notothenioid species
could be due to one or more mutations affecting these
regulatory genes.

In addition to early pattering mechanisms, evolved
bone loss in notothenioids might involve later developmental events. Bone development continues throughout
the life of an individual, through balanced processes of
bone growth and bone remodeling. Fish regulate skeletal
growth and remodeling in much the same way as other
vertebrates, through coordinated activities of bone forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone resorbing cells (osteoclasts) [28]. It is possible that decreased bone density in
notothenioids, which begins early in life, may be maintained later in development by modulating osteoblast
and osteoclast activities. Because osteoporosis in
humans results from an unfavorable balance between
bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by
osteoclasts, these considerations provide fertile ground
for future investigations.
Pedomorphosis in notothenioid skeletal patterning

Morphological analyses revealed several pedomorphic
traits in notothenioid species relative to stickleback and
zebrafish. The most conspicuous differences between
notothenioid and outgroup pharyngeal skeletons were
the absence of the pterygoid process of the palatoquadrate and the concomitant expansion of ventral cartilages. This was most pronounced in the benthopelagic
species C. aceratus, where the anterior and ventral pharyngeal cartilage elements (Meckel's cartilage and

the fin fold (ff) of all species. C. aceratus exhibits a unique pattern of col10a1 expression in the endochondral disk (ed) (E). Thus, gene expression
during fin development appears to be largely conserved among these species. The tree represents the evolutionary relationship among species.

ceratohyal) were well formed and elongated before any
other element appeared (see Additional file 1). This
developmental sequence is distinct from that observed
in both stickleback and zebrafish, where the palatoquadrate (dorsal element) forms almost simultaneously with
Meckel's cartilage (ventral element), followed soon after
by the ceratohyal [29]. The pterygoid process of the
palatoquadrate forms relatively late in zebrafish and
stickleback, after most of the other pharyngeal cartilages
have begun to develop, but is well formed at the beginning of larval development. In notothenioids, the pterygoid process is conspicuously absent throughout
extended periods of larval development, and in adults
this structure (i.e., ectopterygoid) is greatly reduced in
size [13].
Factors that pattern the pharyngeal skeleton along the
D-V axis have been well studied in a variety of models,
and include Endothelin (Edn), an important signaling
molecule for D-V patterning of the zebrafish pharyngeal

skeleton [30,31]. The edn1 gene is expressed in the ventral pharyngeal endoderm and is thought to signal
through hand2 to promote the development of ventral
arch structures (i.e., lower jaw), while inhibiting the
expression of bapx1 and eng2, which are expressed in
the dorsal pharyngeal pouch [30,32]. An enticing model
of notothenioid jaw development would predict that
over-expression of ventral factors (e.g., edn1) in the
pharyngeal endoderm leads to the attenuation of dorsal
signaling molecules, and the development of longer
lower jaws and reduced upper jaw elements. Alternatively, the observed attenuation of the dorsal pterygoid
process in notothenioids might be due to more localized
signals, such as those regulating stomodeal development.
In zebrafish, the pterygoid process develops from a subset of cranial neural crest cells that condense along the
dorsal ectoderm of the stomodeum, the presumptive
mouth opening [33]. Abrogation of Hedgehog signaling
at the developing midline disrupts the specification of

Albertson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/4

the stomodeum, and the condensation of cells fated to
become the pterygoid, suggesting that the stomodeum
may be a critical signaling center for pterygoid
development.
Notothenioid larvae were also distinguished from outgroup species by the conspicuous absence of the most
posterior pharyngeal cartilage, the fifth ceratobranchial
(cb5). This bilaterally paired element forms the pharyngeal ‘jaw’ in both percomorph (e.g., notothenioids and
stickleback) and cypriniform (e.g., zebrafish) fishes, bears
teeth, and is used to processes prey gathered by the oral
jaws. In most bony fishes, development of this cartilage
is accelerated; cb5 forms at the same time as cb3 and
before cb4, and is one of the first elements to be mineralized in the head [29]. In notothenioid adults, however,
cb5 is significantly reduced [34], which we show here to
be associated with a developmental delay in the formation of cb5. Notothenioid larvae possess only a rudimentary cb5 (Fig. 1), and it is the last pharyngeal cartilage to
form, well after the development of more anterior cb
cartilages. At the latest developmental stages examined,
only a few pharyngeal teeth had formed in C. aceratus
and N. coriiceps larvae, and no teeth had developed on
the oral or pharyngeal jaws of P. antarcticum larvae,
whereas comparably staged stickleback and zebrafish
possessed well-mineralized cb5s bearing several teeth
(Fig. 1). A-P patterning of the pharyngeal skeleton is
determined by nested, overlapping expression of various
hox genes [35-39], and it is possible that mis-expression
of posterior hox genes might play a role in the delayed
development of cb5 in notothenioid larvae. Alternatively,
the primary mechanism leading to the reduction of cb5
could be due to signals emanating from tissues surrounding hox-positive cranial neural crest cells, including the pharyngeal endoderm or adjacent mesoderm
[40-42]. Each of these hypotheses remains to be tested
in a more thorough analysis of A-P patterning of the
notothenioid pharyngeal skeleton.
Each notothenioid ecotype examined here exhibited
relatively elongated lower jaws, absent pterygoid processes, and reduced cb5s as larvae (Fig. 1), suggesting
that these traits were present in the common notothenioid ancestor and evolved independently from the bone
mineralization phenotype. The pterygoid process of the
palatoquadrate and the pharyngeal jaw play significant
roles in the collecting and processing of pelagic prey
[43-45]. The pterygoid process articulates with the maxilla and is predicted to play an important role during
jaw protrusion [43]. The observation that the ectopterygoid is one of the few bones in the head where an early
osteogenic program is retained in pelagic notothenioids
(e.g., col10a1 expression, Fig. 2), likely reflects the
importance for this bone during suction feeding. The
pharyngeal jaw is used for both the mastication and

Page 8 of 12

laceration of prey in fishes [45]. While pharyngeal mastication is likely not important for suction feeding
notothenioids [44], a reduced fifth ceratobranchial may
have affected the efficiency to which the pharyngeal
jaws are able process prey via laceration (e.g., the ability
to break down the exoskeleton of pelagic crustaceans
[45]). Whether a delay in the development of either of
these structures represents a developmental constraint
that has shaped patterns of diversification as nototheniods radiated to fill pelagic foraging niches remains an
open question.

Conclusions
Notothenioids dominate the near-shore habitat of Antarctica and are an important example of an adaptive
radiation in marine fishes [1,5,46]. While the ecological
and environmental shifts that have precipitated these
events are well understood, virtually nothing is known
about the molecular and developmental changes that
underlie adaptive variation in notothenioid feeding
architecture. We propose that salient aspects of the evolution of the notothenioid craniofacial skeleton can be
explained by discrete shifts in early developmental
genetic scheduling (Fig. 6).
A small but growing number of studies have described
heterochrony at the molecular level. The evolution and
development of the vertebrate limb, for example, provides several examples of developmental genetic heterochrony. Shifts in the relative timing of expression of Shh
in the zone of polarizing activity are correlated with
decreased digit number in lizards [47], while prolonged
Fgf8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge is correlated with the development of extra phalangeal elements
in dolphins [48]. Excellent opportunities to study genetic
heterochrony are also provided by naturally occurring
wing color mutations in butterflies [49], and by induced
mutations in C. elegans that affect developmental timing
[50]. Genetic heterochrony may also explain differential
expression of cone opsin genes in cichlid fishes, providing a potentially potent mechanism through which
visual sensitivities can evolve in this group [51]. In spite
of these putative exemplars the number of described
molecular mechanisms that underlie evolutionary
change by heterochrony are disproportionately small
given the prominence of this process in discussions of
morphological evolution [14]. Here we show that the
evolution of bone loss in Antarctic notothenioids can be
explained in part by the prolongation of the early chondrogenic developmental pathway through extended periods of larval development. These data offer a molecular
inroad into the larger signaling cascades that modulate
bone density, a trait that is linked to the adaptive radiation of Antarctic notothenioids [1,52]. In addition to the

Figure 6 Schematic illustration of notothenioid craniofacial evolution via heterochrony. Panel A summarizes results for the relative
patterns of each collagen gene expression during notothenioid larval skeletogenesis. Expression in G. aculeatus and D. rerio follows a typical
vertebrate pattern, with col2a1 expressed first in differentiating chondrocytes, followed by a down regulation of col2a1 and subsequent up
regulation of the bone markers, col10a1 and col1a1 (A, top panel). The notothenioid pattern is quite different, with sustained high levels of
col2a1 expression throughout later periods of larval development, expression of col10a1 limited to a small subset of elements, and weak col1a1
expression throughout the pharyngeal skeleton (A, bottom panel). The x-axis denotes developmental time starting just before chondrocyte
differentiation, and the y-axis represents relative (not quantitative) levels of collagen expression. Panels B and C depict a model for anteriorposterior and dorsal-ventral patterning of the pharyngeal skeleton. Compared to stickleback and zebrafish, the developmental program in
notothenioid species is shifted toward the ventral components (darkly shaded) of the anterior-most craniofacial elements (purple and blue). This
shift results in the development of rostral-caudally expanded Meckel's (purple) and ceratohyal (blue) cartilages, and reduced posterior cartilage
elements (i.e., fifth ceratobranchial cartilage, yellow).

mechanisms could provide insights into the development of human osteopenia and suggest effective therapies to prevent and/or treat this disease [53].

Methods
Collection and maintenance of fish species

A clutch of benthopelagic icefish embryos [keyed as
Chaenocephalus aceratus at ~3 months postfertilization
[54,55]] was collected near Brabant Island, Antarctica,
on June 27, 2001. Specimens were reared at -1.5°C in
the aquarium at Palmer Station Antarctica and sampled
daily for two months. Pleuragramma antarcticum
embryos and larvae were collected beneath the sea ice
in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in November, 2005 [56].
Notothenia coriiceps embryos were produced by in vitro

fertilization in June, 2008 and reared at Palmer Station
and at the University of Oregon. Unfortunately, relatively few N. coriiceps embryos survived through larval
stages, and insufficient numbers were available for in
situ hybridization analyses. Comparative staging of
notothenioid samples is described in Additional file 1.
Staged embryos were also collected from an anadromous population of the closely related threespine stickleback [57] and the distantly related zebrafish. Both of
these species were reared and bred at the University of
Oregon as described [58]. Experimental research conducted on these animals was performed according to
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees (IACUC) at Syracuse University
(#07-024) and the University of Oregon (#07-25A).

Skeletal terminology and preparations

Throughout this report we refer to the "craniofacial skeleton" and "pharyngeal bones", common anatomical
terms that are widely accepted and recognizable across
multiple disciplines. For clarity, it is worth pointing out
that by the craniofacial skeleton we are referring to the
entirety of the cranial skeleton (i.e., chondrocranium,
sphlanchnocranium and dermatocranium) [59], and by
pharyngeal bones we are referring to those bones
derived from the embryonic pharyngeal arches, including the mandibular and hyoid arches as well as posterior
gill arches. Cartilage and bone staining was performed
using the two-color acid-free protocol [60]. Samples
were micrographed with a Zeiss Axiocam digital imaging system mounted to an M2 Bio stereomicroscope
(Zeiss). Image processing used Adobe Photoshop CS4.
Cloning and phylogenetic reconstruction of
notothenioid collagen genes

Primers for genomic DNA amplification were based on
Gasterosteus aculeatus genomic assembly BROAD S1,
ENSEMBL version 49 http://www.ensembl.org/Gasterosteus_aculeatus/index.html. Primers were GACcol1a1F1/
R1 GTGGCGGATTTGACCTCGGATTCAT/CACCGC
TCTTCCAGTCAGGGTTGC, GACcol2a1F1/R1 AT
GTCGGCCTTCGCTGGTCTGG/ACTCGGGGTGGCA
CAGCTTCAGGT, and GACcol10a1F1/R1 CTAAG
GGAAACAAGGGAGATCAGG/GAAGCAATGAGGA
ACCCAGAGAA. Amplicon lengths were 238 bp, 220
bp, and 876 bp for col1a1, col2a1b, and col10a1, respectively. Genomic DNA from C. aceratus and from N. coriiceps was used as the PCR template.
PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels,
excised, and centrifuged at 14,000 g. Cloning was performed using 2 μl of the resulting supernatant and the
TOPO Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA
inserts of clones were sequenced by automated methods,
and nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acids
using Editseq (DNASTAR, INC., Madison). Predicted
amino acid sequences were aligned and 1,000 Neighborjoining bootstrap replicates performed using CLUSTALX 2.0 [61]. The bootstrap consensus tree was
viewed using Njplot [62].
In situ hybridization analysis

Whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses were performed as previously described [60]. Sense and antisense riboprobes were made from notothenioid clones.
Selected whole mount specimens were sectioned after in
situ hybridization using a vibrating microtome (Vibratome 1500, The Vibratome Company, St. Louis, MO).
After hybridization, embryos were transferred directly
into gelatin/albumin embedding solution [2.2 g gelatin
(TYPE B) in 450 ml PBS; 135 g chick egg albumin; 90 g
sucrose] for several minutes before transfer into molds

containing fresh embedding solution plus 2.5% glutaraldehyde fixative. The molds were covered with cellophane, and the samples allowed to harden overnight at
4°C. The following day blocks were cut, mounted to the
sectioning dish with super glue, and sectioned at 40 μm.
In situ hybridization was also performed on cryostatsectioned material. Fixed material was embedded in
1.5% agar and 5% sucrose and stored in 30% sucrose at
4°C overnight. Cryostat sections (16 μm) were cut,
transferred to Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus microscope
slides (Pittsburgh, PA), and stored at -20°C. Subsequent
steps followed closely the method for whole-mount in
situ hybridization.
