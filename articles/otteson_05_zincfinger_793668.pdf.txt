Abstract
Background: In the retina, many of the genes that encode components of the visual transduction
cascade and retinoid recycling are exclusively expressed in photoreceptor cells and show highly
stereotyped temporal and spatial expression patterns. Multiple transcriptional activators of
photoreceptor-specific genes have been identified, but little is known about negative regulation of
gene expression in the retina. We recently identified KLF15, a member of the Sp/Krüppel-like
Factor family of zinc-finger containing transcription factors, as an in vitro repressor of the promoters
of the photoreceptor-specific genes rhodopsin and IRBP/Rbp3. To gain further insight into the
mechanism of KLF15-mediated regulation of gene expression, we have characterized the binding
characteristics and specificity of KLF15's DNA binding domains and defined the KLF15 binding sites
in the rhodopsin and IRBP promoters.
Results: In EMSA and DNAseI footprinting assays, a KLF15-GST fusion protein containing the Cterminal zinc-finger domains (123 amino acids) showed zinc-dependent and sequence-specific
binding to a 9 bp consensus sequence containing a core CG/TCCCC. Both the bovine rhodopsin
and IRBP promoters contained multiple KLF15 binding sites that included the previously identified
CRS-1 and G-rich repressor elements. KLF15 binding sites were highly conserved between the
bovine, human, chimp and dog rhodopsin promoters, but less conserved in rodents. KLF15 reduced
luciferase expression by bRho130-luc (containing 4 KLF15 sites) and repressed promoter activation
by CRX (cone rod homeobox) and/or NRL (neural retina leucine zipper), although the magnitude
of the reduction was smaller than previously reported for a longer bRho225-luc (containing 6
KFL15 sites).
Conclusion: KLF15 binds to multiple 9 bp consensus sites in the Rhodospin and IRBP promoters
including the CRS-1 and G-rich repressor elements. Based on the known expression pattern of
KLF15 in non-photoreceptor cells, we hypothesize an in vivo role for KLF15 in repressing
photoreceptor-specific gene expression in the inner retina.

Background
Photoreceptors are the highly specialized sensory receptors of the retina and express a unique array of genes that
enable them to convert light energy into a neural signal.
Many of these genes, including those encoding components of the phototransduction cascade [e.g. rhodopsin
(Rho), transducin, arrestin, α– and β-phosphodiesterase
(PDE)] and those involved in retinoid recycling [e.g. interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP/RBP3)], are
expressed only in photoreceptor cells in the retina and in
a subset of cells in the pineal gland [1-5]. In addition,
these genes have highly stereotyped temporal and spatial
patterns of expression during retinal development [6-8]
that are transcriptionally regulated [7,9,10]. We are interested in understanding the transcriptional networks that
regulate photoreceptor-specific gene expression, not only
as a model for cell-specific gene regulation, but to gain
insight into the mechanisms that regulate photoreceptor
differentiation and neuro-degenerative retinal disease.
The proximal promoter regions of both Rho (-225 to +70
base pairs relative to the transcription start site) [11-13]
and IRBP (-123 to +18 bp) [6,14] are sufficient to drive
photoreceptor-specific expression of reporter genes in
transgenic mice. Using DNAse I protection assays, binding
sites for both retina-enriched and more widely expressed
proteins have been identified on these promoters [15-22]
and include both positive and negative regulatory elements [17-19,23-29]. Among the positive regulatory elements, Ret-1, BAT-1 and PCE-1 each contain a core ATTA
sequence that can be bound by homeodomain containing
transcription factors including CRX [30], RX/RAX [31],
ERX [32], QRX [33] and OTX2 [18,34]. Binding sites for
the basic-leucine zipper transcription factor NRL have
been identified in the promoters of rhodopsin [35,36] as
well as other photoreceptor-specific genes including arrestin [26] and the rod-specific α- and β-PDE [37,38]. Combinatorial effects by CRX and NRL result in synergistic
increases in Rho promoter activation in vitro that likely
contribute to the high levels of expression in rod photoreceptors in vivo [29,30,39] Both Crx and Nrl play key roles
in photoreceptor development and survival: in Crx knockout mice, rod photoreceptors fail to elaborate outer segments and degenerate and the mice lack detectible visual
function [40]; in Nrl knock-out mice, rod photoreceptors
apparently fail to differentiate (although there is an
increase in cone-like cells) and mice have severely reduced
visual function [41]. In addition, mutations in both CRX
and NRL have been identified in patients with a variety of
inherited retinal degenerative diseases including autosomal dominant and recessive retinitis pigmentosa, Leber
congenital amaurosis and cone-rod dystrophy [42-45].
Although transcriptional repression plays an important
role in development and cell fate determination in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/15

central nervous system and inappropriate de-repression of
gene expression can contribute to disease [46,47], relatively little is known about negative regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression. Negative regulatory
elements, including the CRS-1 site in the rhodopsin promoter [21] and the G-rich repressor in the IRBP promoter
[20] are bound by nuclear proteins present in both retinal
and non-retinal tissues, although the identities of the specific transcription factors have not been established. The
zinc-finger transcription factor MOK2 binds to sites in the
promoter and intron 1 of IRBP and represses transactivation of reporter constructs containing these elements in
vitro [48]. Other proteins interact with CRX (e.g. ATXN-7
[49] and BAF [50]) or NRL (e.g. FIZ-1 [51]) and can
reduce their ability to activate transcription, but these
appear to repress via protein/protein interactions rather
than binding directly to the promoter. We recently identified KLF15, a member of the Sp/KLF family of zinc-finger
containing transcription factors, as a repressor of both the
rhodopsin and IRBP promoters in vitro [52].
KLF15 is expressed in both retinal and non-retinal tissues
and, like other members of the Sp/KLF family, is characterized by the presence of three Krüppel-type zinc-finger
domains at the C-terminus [52-54]. Members of this gene
family have been characterized as regulators of both tissue-specific and ubiquitous genes and can function as
either transcriptional activators, repressors or both
depending on promoter context [55,56] KLF15 appears to
be bi-functional, as it represses the Rho and IRBP promoters [52] and the kidney-specific Clc-K1 and Clc-K2 promoters [53] but activates the Glut4 (glucose transporter 4)
promoter [54]. KLF1/EKLF [57,58], KLF8 [59] and KLF15
[54] all bind a core CACCC site in vitro, although this is
shorter than the 9 bp site predicted for a three zinc-finger
containing protein and is likely to provide only limited
specificity. To gain further insight into the mechanism of
KLF15-mediated regulation of gene expression, we have
characterized the binding characteristics and specificity of
KLF15 and defined the KLF15 binding sites in the Rho and
IRBP promoters.

Results
EMSA analysis of KLF15 binding
DNA binding properties of KLF15 were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using GSTtagged, human KLF15 fusion protein. Constructs for the
full-length KLF15 fusion protein expressed poorly in bacterial cells and yielded a highly degraded protein. Therefore, a recombinant fusion protein (KLF15-ZF) containing
the C-terminal 123 amino acids including the three C-terminal zinc-finger domains fused to GST was expressed
and purified from bacteria. Western blot of crude bacterial
lysates using anti-GST antibodies showed minor degradation of the fusion protein prior to purification; however,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/15

the majority of the protein recovered following affinity
purification consisted of intact KLF15-ZF fusion protein
(Fig. 1A).
Comparison of the proximal promoter regions showed
that the 29 bp fragment of the bovine Rho promoter
(bRho29) used as bait in the yeast one-hybrid assay that
identified KLF15 [52] shared high sequence identity with
the equivalent element from the human rhodopsin promoter (hRho29), differing by only 5 bp. In EMSA, KLF15ZF fusion protein shifted oligomers for both bRho29 (Fig.
1B) and hRho29 (Fig. 1C) and these could be supershifted
by addition of antibodies against KLF15 (generous gift of
S. Uchida [53]) (Fig. 1D) or GST (Fig. 1E). The lower
molecular weight band that was supershifted by the antiKLF15 but not by anti-GST antibodies most likely resulted
from low levels of protein that had lost the N-terminal,
GST-tag, but retained the C-terminus of the protein containing the DNA binding domain and the anti-KLF15
antibody recognition site.

Zinc dependence of KLF15 binding
The secondary structure of zinc-finger domains and as
well as their ability to bind DNA is dependent on the chelation of Zn+2 ions by Cys2-His2 residues within each zinc
finger [60,61]. To determine if DNA binding by KLF15-ZF
was in fact Zn+2 dependent, aliquots of the fusion protein
were diluted in EDTA to chelate divalent cations and subsequently added to binding reactions containing 32Plabeled bRho29 or hRho29 oligonucleotides. Increasing
concentrations of EDTA resulted in a dose-dependent
reduction in KLF15-ZF binding to bRho29 (Fig. 2A, B) or
to hRho29 (data not shown), with binding completely
eliminated when protein was prepared in 50 mM EDTA,
resulting in 20 mM EDTA in the final binding reaction.
DNA binding was reconstituted by addition of 5 mM
ZnCl2 (Fig. 2A) or ZnAcetate (data not shown), but not
MgCl2 (Fig. 2B) to the binding reactions. As an additional
test of cation specificity, we tested KLF15 binding activity
in the presence of EGTA, a chelator that preferentially
binds Ca+2. No loss of KLF15-ZF binding was observed in
the presence of up to 250 mM EGTA (Fig. 2C). It is interesting to note that the retina and other ocular tissues contain unusually high levels of zinc compared to other
tissues and zinc deficiency has been implicated with various retinopathies including macular degeneration, night
blindness and retinitis pigmentosa [62,63]. Chelation of
intracellular zinc can modulate conformation and DNA
binding activity of the zinc-finger transcription factor p53
in cultured cells [64,65]; therefore, physiological zinc
deficiencies could result in loss of DNA binding activity of
zinc-finger proteins in vivo.

ZnCl2 (mM) as indicated. B. Same as A, but with MgCl2. C. Same as A, but with EGTA and ZnCl2. The altered migration of the
unbound oligonucleotides is attributable to the salt effects of high concentrations of EGTA.

Sequence specificity of KLF15 binding
Sequence specificity of KLF15-ZF binding was examined
by EMSA using a series of unlabeled oligomers as competitors (Fig. 3). The addition of 250-fold excess of cold
bRho29 or hRho29 effectively competed with the radiolabeled bRho29 probe for KLF15 binding. We also tested
oligomers IRBP1 and IRBP2 that contained binding sites
for the zinc-finger transcription factor MOK2 and are
located in the promoter and intron 2 of IRBP respectively
[48]. Neither of these heterologous oligomers competed
with radiolabeled bRho29 (Fig. 3) or hRho29 probes
(data not shown).

To identify the specific bases within bRho29 and hRho29
that were critical for binding, we generated a series of
scanning oligomers, each containing a triplet of mutated
bases (Fig. 4A). Because an individual zinc-finger domain
typically binds to a DNA triplet, this approach was
selected to maximize the likelihood that the mutations
would disrupt protein/DNA interactions. Oligomers with
1 or more mutated bases within the central C-rich
sequence (bovine: ACG CCC CCA; human ACA CCC
CCA) had reduced ability to compete with the wild-type
bRho29 (Fig. 4B) or hRho29 (Fig. 4C), whereas oligomers
with mutations of any other triplet competed as well as
wild-type.
To test if there was binding activity in retinal proteins that
was specific to the KLF15 binding site, we performed

EMSA using a total retinal extract with either the wild-type
bRho29 oligo or the ∆10 oligo (see Fig. 4A) containing a
mutated KLF15 binding site (Fig. 5). With both the wildtype and mutant oligos, there were multiple shifted bands
observed, however mutation of the KLF15 binding site
eliminated several of the major bands. Bands that were
unique to the wild-type oligo were not abolished by the
addition of up to 200-fold excess of the ∆10 oligo as a
competitor, while those that were common to both were
reduced in intensity to near background levels. This is
consistent with our findings that ∆10 was unable to compete with the wild-type bRho29 for binding to the KLF15ZF fusion protein in competitive EMSA (Fig. 4B). We
observed that with the wild-type oligo, those bands that
were dependent on the presence of an intact KLF15 binding site showed the greatest intensity; in contrast, when
the KLF15 binding site was mutated, those bands that
were not dependent on the presence of the KLF15 binding
site were increased in intensity.
KLF15 binding sites in rhodopsin and IRBP promoters
DNAse I footprinting was used to identify KLF15 binding
sites in the bovine Rho and IRBP promoters. Using two
overlapping fragments of the bovine RPPR (-225 to + 70
bp and -315 to -31 bp) as templates, KLF15-ZF protected
six distinct sites (designated KR-a to KR-f) that were generally similar in their boundaries on both the forward and
reverse strands (Fig. 6 A–D). In the IRBP proximal promoter, KLF15 protected three sites (KI-a, KI-b, KI-c) on

both forward and reverse strands (Fig. 7A, B). Examination of the sequences protected by KLF15-ZF showed that
all contained extended C-rich or G-rich sequences (Fig.
10A), consistent with the site identified by competitive
EMSA. To identify a consensus binding site, we analyzed
the sequences of the C-rich strands of the nine KLF15 protected regions using Target Explorer software http://tran
tor.bioc.columbia.edu/Target_Explorer/[66]. Assuming a
60% AT, 40% GC content in the genome and a 9 bp binding site, we identified the top 4 matrices (Additional file:
1). All of the matrices included the site identified by competitive EMSA and, when used to evaluate the oligos
tested in competitive EMSA, could discriminate between
the strong competitors and weak/non-competitors.
Matrix 2 yielded the greatest difference between the scores
of competitors and non-competitors (Fig. 10). Possible
scores ranged from -17.45 to 10.65, with the scores for the
KLF15 protected sites ranging from 7.26 to 10.27. Oligos
that were good competitors in EMSA all contained at least
one binding site with a score > 5.68, whereas those that
were poor competitors had maximal scores < 4.06. Using

1/2 of the difference between these scores as a cutoff
(4.87), we analyzed the proximal promoters of rhodopsin
(Fig. 8A) and IRBP (Fig. 8B) from human, chimp, dog,
mouse and rat to identify potential KLF15 binding sites
(Fig. 8; see also Additional file: 1). These analyses showed
that the KR-a site was conserved across all mammalian
rhodopsin promoters analyzed, and the KR-d site was
present in all but the dog promoter, which contained an
additional KLF15 binding site immediately 5' to KR-e. The
other four KLF15 binding sites were conserved only in
non-rodents, although one novel binding site located 3'
to site KR-d was predicted in the mouse and rat promoters. In the IRBP promoters, KI-b and KI-c were conserved
in bovine, human, chimp and dog, with an additional site
predicted in the mouse promoter (5' to KI-a) and in
bovine and dog (5' to KI-c, outside of the region analyzed
by DNAse I footprinting).

Effects of KLF15 on a minimal bovine rhodopsin promoter
We previously reported that KLF15 repressed transactivation of bRho225-luc, a promoter-luciferase reporter construct containing -225 to +70 bp of the bovine rhodopsin
promoter [52] that contained the six KLF15 binding sites
identified in DNAse I footprinting analysis. A smaller fragment of the rhodopsin proximal promoter (-130 to +70 bp)
containing only four KLF15 binding sites, but lacking the
KR-e/CRS-1 and KR-f sites, is still sufficient to drive
expression of a reporter gene in primary cultures retinal
cells from chick [36]. Using a luciferase reporter construct
containing this smaller fragment of the rhodopsin promoter (bRho130-luc), the results of transient transfections of 293 cells were qualitatively similar to those
previously reported using the bRho225-luc construct:
KLF15 alone or in co-transfections with CRX and/or NRL
resulted in statistically significant decreases in luciferase
expression (Fig. 9). In co-transfections with CRX, high
concentrations of KLF15 were more effective at reducing
luciferase expression (Fig. 9B); in contrast, there was a relatively concentration-independent reduction (>50%) in
luciferase expression in co-transfections with NRL at all
concentrations of KLF15 tested (Fig. 9C). We compared
the results of promoter transactivation assays using
bRho130-luc with those previously obtained using
bRho225-luc [52] and found that luciferase expression in
transfections with KLF15 was consistently lower with
bRho225-luc than with bRho130-luc, with the differences
within the 95% confidence interval for KFL15+CRX (p =
0.0355) and within 90% confidence interval for KLF15
alone (p = 0.0879), KLF15+NRL (p = 0.0594) and
KLF15+CRX+NRL (p = 0.0894).

Discussion
We previously identified KLF15 as a transcriptional
repressor of the rhodopsin and IRBP promoters in vitro and
report here the characterization of KLF15's DNA binding

properties. For these analyses, we analyzed protein
binding specificity on bovine promoters using a truncated
human KLF15-GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal DNA binding domain, but lacking the N-terminal
repressor domain [52]. Since zinc-finger domains typically function as modular DNA binding motifs that can
bind their target sequences independently of other protein domains [67,68], the binding specificity of the truncated KLF15 fusion protein is predicted to be similar, if
not identical, to the full length protein. Previous studies
showed that recombinant GST fusion proteins containing
the full length human or rat KLF15 bound to an element
in the CLC-K1 promoter [53] and we found that our truncated KLF15 fusion protein also bound the same element
in EMSA (data not shown). The amino acid sequence of
the zinc finger domains of bovine KLF15 differs from

human, chimp, dog, mouse and rat at only a single amino
acid residue (isoleucine to valine) and the flanking
regions that were included in the KLF15-ZF fusion protein
differ at only 11 amino acid residues between human and
bovine KLF15. We would predict, therefore, that the DNA
binding specificity would show only minor differences (if
any) between these species. Supporting this prediction,
the human KLF15-GST fusion protein shifted oligos containing either the bovine or human KLF15 consensus site.
Using EMSA, we have confirmed that proteins present in
retinal extracts can bind specifically to the KLF15 binding
site. However, this result does not necessarily mean that
the observed binding activity is attributable to KLF15.
Other members of the KLF family recognize similar G/C
rich binding motifs [54,57-59] and MAZ (myc-associated
zinc-finger protein) can also recognize the KLF15 core

promoter elements. In EMSA, both retina-specific and
ubiquitous nuclear proteins bind a 20 bp probe (-55 to 36) containing the Ret-4 element (including the KR-b site)
in the rhodopsin promoter [24]. Interestingly, mutations in
the G-rich sequence within the Ret-4 element that would
be predicted to disrupt the KLF15 binding site eliminated
binding by the ubiquitously expressed proteins [24]. In
DNAse I footprinting assays of the bovine rhodopsin proximal promoter, nuclear extracts from bovine retina [21]
and from Y79 and WERI retinoblastoma cells [69] protected the BAT-1 (-103 to -84) site. Two additional sites
protected by bovine retinal proteins are Ret-1 (-138 to 126) and CRS-1 (-177 to -199) [16,20]. Three of these
sites correspond to sites protected by KLF15 in our DNAse
I footprinting, KR-6/Ret-4, KR-c/BAT-1 and KR-e/CRS-1.
In addition to being protected by nuclear proteins from
retinal extract, the CRS-1 site is protected by proteins
present in nuclear extracts from non-retinal tissues [21].
KLF15 is expressed in the multiple tissues including the
retina [52-54] and can repress rhodopsin promoter constructs in transient transfections [52]. Although we do not
yet know the relative importance of these different KLF15
binding sites in regulation of target gene expression in
vivo, our in vitro assays showed that KLF15 more effectively
repressed a rhodopsin promoter construct (bRho225) containing six KLF15 binding sites (including KR-e/CRS-1)
than a shorter promoter construct (bRho130) that contains only 4 (including the KR-b/Ret-4 and KR-c/BAT-1
sites), suggesting that both the proximal and distal sites
influence KLF15's repressor activity.

binding site [53]. Thus, it remains a distinct possibility
that, in addition to KLF15, there are other retinal proteins
that can recognize this site.
Several of the KLF15 binding sites that we identified in
DNAse I footprinting correspond to previously identified

The G-rich repressor element is located between -156 and
-70 bp in IRBP promoter and overlaps the KI-c binding
site for KLF15. Deletion of the G-rich element increases
reporter gene expression in retinoblastoma cells
[14,19,34] and results in inappropriate expression of GFP
reporter constructs in non-retinal tissues in Xenopus laevis
[28]. In DNAse I footprinting, this site is protected by proteins present in nuclear extracts from both retinoblastoma
WERI-Rb1 and non-retinal HeLa cells [18]. Based on the
ability of oligos containing the Sp1 consensus site to compete with the G-rich element in EMSA, it was proposed
that Sp1 or Sp1-related proteins bind this site in vivo [19].
KLF15 represses transactivation of an IRBP promoter construct in vitro, is expressed in both retinal and non-retinal
tissues, and is structurally and phylogenetically related to
the Sp family of transcription factors [52], making it an
attractive candidate to bind the G-rich repressor element
in vivo.
Potential KLF15 binding sites corresponding to the CRS-1
and G-rich sites are present in the bovine, human, chimp
and dog promoters. It was, however, somewhat surprising
that no consensus KLF15 binding sites were identified at
corresponding locations in the mouse or rat promoters. As

the zinc-finger domains are identical between these
species, it seems unlikely that the lack of identifiable binding sites at these locations reflects species-specific differences in KLF15's binding specificity. Although we cannot
formally exclude this possibility, there are several possible
alternative interpretations of this observation. The simplest explanation is that the location or number of KLF15
binding sites differs between species, possibly reflecting
the accumulation of mutations during evolution. A comparison of well characterized promoters of 51 genes found
substantial differences between human and mouse, with
32–40% of the binding sites identified in the human promoters containing sufficient sequence changes in the
mouse promoters to render them non-functional [70]. In
addition, despite our evidence showing that KLF15 binds
the CRS-1 and G-rich repressor elements in vitro, there
may be species-specific differences in the identity and/or
sequence specificity of the transcription factor(s) that
bind this site in vivo.
Changes in transcriptional regulation are thought to play
a significant role in generating phenotypic differences
between species [71] and there are clearly morphological
and developmental differences between cows, primates,
dogs and rodents. In the retina, differences include the
time course of embryonic/fetal development and cellular
differentiation, as well as the proportions and absolute

numbers of different neuronal subtypes (e.g. rods vs.
cones) present in the mature retina. Along with these morphological differences, there are species-specific variations
in the regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression. In the bovine retina, transcripts for rhodopsin, IRBP,
arrestin, rod α-transducin and rod α-PDE all begin to accumulate relatively late in retinal development, at the time
when the first outer segments are detected [7]. In contrast,
in mice and rats there is considerable variation in the
developmental stage when different photoreceptor-specific genes are first expressed [8,9,72]. Interestingly, the
CRS-1/KR-e site was initially proposed to play a role in
repressing premature rhodopsin expression during retinal
development, based on the observation that protection of
the CRS-1 site by fetal bovine retinal proteins diminishes
throughout development [21] in a temporal pattern that
is coordinated with increases in rhodopsin transcription
and mRNA accumulation [9]. Further emphasizing the
extent of the differences between species, a large scale
analysis of expressed genes in the mouse retina found that
out of nearly 2000 known genes that could be assigned
map locations in the mouse genome, 25% had no identifiable human ortholog [73]. Although the identification
and characterization of conserved genes and regulatory
mechanisms has provided significant contributions to our
understanding of retinal development and disease, there
are likely to be novel and potentially valuable insights

that can be obtained through comparative analysis of the
basis of species-specific differences.
Several KLF proteins have been shown to bind a core
CACCC element [57-59] and Gray and colleagues [54]

demonstrated that 5'-CACCC-3' is sufficient for KLF15
binding in EMSA. A single zinc finger typically makes contact with 3 adjacent bases [67] therefore the three zinc-fingers of KLF15 would be predicted to have a 9 bp binding
site, consistent with our EMSA results. We found that
Page 11 of 16

mutations outside of the 9 bp consensus site had no effect
on DNA binding in EMSA; however, when we used TargetExplorer to re-analyze the KLF15 protected sequences
identified in DNAse I footprinting, making no a priori
assumptions as to the actual size of the consensus binding
site, a longer 12–13 bp consensus sequence was identified. The functional significance of the extended consensus site is unclear, but it is interesting to note that the KRb, KR-c and KR-d sites respectively overlapped the Ret-4,
BAT-1 and Ret-1 sites, all containing known binding sites
for homeodomain containing proteins including CRX
[30,31]. The KR-b site is located at the 3' end of the Ret-4
site within a G-rich sequence is a binding site for nuclear
proteins present in both retinal and non-retinal tissues
[24]. The highly conserved KR-d site is within a GC-rich
sequence that functions to facilitate binding of retinal
nuclear proteins to the adjacent Ret-1 site [15]. One interpretation is that KLF15 binding sites are preferentially
located adjacent to binding sites for other transcription
factors, possibly CRX or other OTX-related factors. In
EMSA using total retinal proteins, mutation of the KLF15
binding site increased binding of some retinal proteins to
the ∆10 oligo, as shown by the increased intensity of
KLF15-independent bands (Fig. 5). As mutation of the
KLF15 binding site does not alter the core homeodomain
binding site present in these oligos, homeodomain proteins (e.g. CRX; RX/RAX; OTX2) present in retinal extracts
likely bind to both the wild-type and mutant oligos.
Although mutation of the KLF15 site may have inadvertently created a novel protein binding site, several of the
bands showing increased intensity with the ∆10 oligo
were also present using the wild-type bRho29 oligo, raising the possibility that occupancy of the KLF15 site can
affect protein/DNA interactions of other DNA binding
proteins. The proximity of KLF15 and CRX binding sites
and our findings that (1) KLF15 can repress transactivation of the rhodopsin promoter by CRX in vitro and (2)
both KFL15 and CRX are expressed in non-photoreceptor
cells in the inner nuclear layer [52] are consistent with a
possible in vivo role for KLF15 in repressing inappropriate
activation of the rhodopsin promoter by CRX in non-photoreceptor cells.
A similar correlation between KLF15 and CRX binding
sites was not observed in the IRBP promoter. However,
the KI-c site/G-rich repressor element in the bovine IRBP
promoter is adjacent to a CpG dinucleotide (-115) that
becomes hypomethylated specifically in retinal cells at the
time IRBP expression is first detected [74,75]. The G-rich
repressor element is bound by proteins present in non-retinal tissues where the CpG dinucleotide remains methylated; therefore, it is tempting to speculate that KLF15 may
participate in regulating methylation at this site. Other
KLF genes are known to regulate chromatin remodeling.
The transcriptional activator KLF1/EKLF recruits a SWI/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/15

SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex that is
thought to be involved in regulation of the locus control
region of the β-globin gene [76]. The transcriptional
repressor KLF14/BTEB3 interacts with a co-repressor
(mSin3A) and the histone deacetylase protein HDAC-1
though repressor domains within the N-terminus to
mediate transcriptional repression through chromatin
remodeling [77]. Interestingly, in our footprinting analysis of the rhodopsin promoter we observed several sites of
increased DNAse I hypersensitivity adjacent to KLF15 protected regions, possibly reflecting alterations in DNA configuration and potentially lending additional support for
involvement of KLF15 in chromatin remodeling.

Conclusion
The goal of these studies was to determine the binding
characteristics and specificity of KLF15 and define the
KLF15 binding sites in the Rho and IRBP promoters in
order to gain further insight into the mechanism of
KLF15-mediated regulation of retinal gene expression. We
found that KLF15 binds to multiple 9 bp consensus sites
in the rhodopsin and IRBP promoters including the previously identified CRS-1 and G-rich repressor elements. The
presence of multiple KLF15 binding sites suggests that
transcriptional repression is likely to play an important
role in regulation of photoreceptor-specific genes. Based
on the known expression of KLF15 in retinal and non-retinal tissues and the absence of KLF15 expression in photoreceptors, we hypothesize an in vivo role for KLF15 in
repressing photoreceptor-specific gene expression in nonphotoreceptor cells.

Methods
Protein isolation
To generate KLF15-ZF-GST, the 3' end of the human
KLF15 coding region (369 bp) and the stop codon was
amplified from pCRII-hKLF15 [52] using a combination
of Taq (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, California) and PFU
polymerase (Promega; Madison, WI), subcloned into the
BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX (Amersham/Pharmacia;
Piscataway, NJ) and confirmed by sequencing. KLF15-ZF
fusion protein with an N-terminal, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag was purified from whole cell lysates of
IPTG-induced (0.4 mM) E. coli (BL21S; Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, California) using sepharose 4B (Amersham/
Pharmacia; Piscataway, NJ) according to maunfacturer's
instructions. Purified protein was quantified using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (BCA; Sigma; St. Louis,
MO) and analyzed using standard 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot with anti-GST
antibodies (Amersham/Pharmacia; Piscataway, NJ)
diluted 1:8000.

methods were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Johns Hopkins University. For total protein
extracts, retinas were dissected from adult mice and placed
directly into ice cold PBS containing protease inhibitors
(CompleteMini Tablets, EDTA-free; Roche, Indianapolis,
IN), sonicated for 10–15 seconds (Setting 5, 50% Duty
Cycle) using a Branson Model 250 Sonifier (Branson
Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) with a micro-tip, quantified by BCA and stored at -80C.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
EMSA assays followed previously published protocols
[24,78] and used a binding buffer optimized for the
KLF15-ZF-GST fusion protein (4 mM HEPES, 5 mM
EGTA; 100 mM KCl, 0.25 mM ZnCl2; 0.02% NP40; 0.1 M
DTT; 4% glycerol). For analysis of Zn+2 specificity, ZnCl2
was eliminated from the binding buffer except as indicated. Probes with 5'-GG dinucleotide overhangs were
generated by annealing single-stranded oligos with their
reverse complement and end-labeled with 32P-dCTP using
Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (New England
Biolabs, Beverly MA). Cold competitors were end-filled
with Klenow using cold dCTP. Binding reactions were
incubated for 90 to 120 minutes on ice; for supershift
experiments antibodies against GST (Amersham/Pharmacia; Piscataway, NJ) or KLF15 C-terminal peptide [a generous gift of S. Uchida; [53]] were added after an initial 60
minute incubation. Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 5% non-denaturing gel, dried gels were
exposed to storage phosphor screens; peaks for each band
and DLU (Digital Light Units) for the areas under the
peaks were determined using Optiquant software (Packard Instruments). For each lane, the percent of oligo
shifted was calculated as [(DLU shifted band/ total DLU)
× 100]. For competition assays, "percent competed" was
calculated as the difference between the percent oligo
shifted without competitor and the percent oligo shifted
with competitor.
DNAse I footprint analysis
DNAse I footprinting followed previously published procedures [24,78] using 33P-end-labeled promoter fragments generated by PCR, KLF15-ZF-GST or GST fusion
proteins and EMSA binding buffer optimized for KLF15ZF. For bovine Rho promoter fragments, the template was
a plasmid containing the bovine upstream Rho promoter
(-2174 to +32 bp) [36]; for bovine IRBP promoter fragment (-300 to +132 bp), the template was a plasmid containing the corresponding region of the bovine IRBP
promoter [30]. Primers used for PCR amplification of promoter fragments were as follows: for bovine Rho (-225 to
+70 bp): forward: 5'-AGGCCTCTGCTCTTTCCC-3';
reverse: 5'-CGCCGGCGGCGCGAACCCG-3'; for bovine
Rho (-315 to -31 bp): forward: 5'-AGAGGGAAGT-

protein used varied from 16 to 250 ng per reaction and
DNAse I digestions were carried out at room temperature
for 1 minute.
Consensus sequence analysis
To identify consensus sequences for protein binding sites,
sequences protected in DNAse I footprinting were analyzed using Target Explorer http://trantor.bioc.colum
bia.edu/Target_Explorer/[66], a program that uses CONSENSUS (version 6c) and WCONSENSUS (version 5c) to
determine consensus patterns in unaligned sequences
using an algorithm based on a matrix representation of a
consensus pattern. WCONSENSUS determines the width
of the pattern being sought without a priori knowledge of
the length of the consensus sequence.
Transient transfections
Promoter transactivation assays used transient transfections of human embryonic kidney cells (293) with expression vectors, hKLF15-pcDNA3.1 [52], Crx-pcDNA3.1
[30], Nrl-pED (gift of A. Swaroop [35]) and luciferase
reporter plasmid bRho130-luc [36] following previously
published methods [30,52]. The total amount (µg) of
DNA in each plate was kept constant by addition of the
corresponding expression vector(s) lacking a cDNA insert.
Basal activity of each reporter construct in 293 cells was
defined as the relative luciferase expression in control
plates transfected with reporter constructs and "empty"
expression vectors. For each experiment, at least two independent transfections were performed on separate days,
and for each combination of expression vectors tested, at
least 4 DNA precipitates prepared with each precipitate
divided equally to transfect two plates for a total of≥8
transfections per condition.
Statistical analyses
For each condition the fold change in relative luciferase
relative to control transfections was calculated and analyzed as previously described [52]. Statistical analysis used
linear mixed models and comparisons of bRho130-luc
and bRho225-luc reporter constructs used Wilcoxon Two
Sample test (SAS; Cary, NC).
