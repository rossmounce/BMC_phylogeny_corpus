Abstract
Background: West Nile virus (WNV) has spread across North, Central, and South America since
its introduction in 1999. At the start of this spread, Florida was considered a potentially important
area with regards to transmission due to its geographic, climatological, and demographic
conditions. Curiously, the anticipated high levels of transmission or disease outbreaks have not
been observed. As other studies have predicted that the lack of intense WNV transmission is not
due to vector incompetence, we sought to evaluate the role of viral strain diversity in WNV
transmission in Florida. Therefore, a phylogentic analysis was carried out on several isolates
collected from three distinct locations in Florida.
Results: Contrasting with a positive control collected in Indian River County, Florida during 2003
that contains the original NY99 genotype with valanine at amino acid 159 of the envelope region,
all of the isolates collected in 2005 contain the WN02 genotype composed of a substation with
alanine at that position indicating the window of introduction of the WN02 genotype occurred
between 2003 and 2005. From the eight isolates collected in Duval, Indian River, and Manatee
Counties; there is also a silent nucleotide substitution that differentiates the isolates collected on
the Atlantic side of the state compared to the isolate collected on the Gulf side, which groups
closer to isolates from other locations near the Gulf.
Conclusion: As a whole, the Florida isolates contained numerous variable nucleotide and amino
acid sites from the reference sequences, as well as each other; indicating greater nucleotide
diversity within the Florida 2005 isolates than within other regions. Finally, a series of three amino
acid substitutions surrounding a set of histidines located in the envelope coding region that
hypothesized to play a role in conformational changes was found in the isolate collected in Indian
River County, perhaps changing the antigenicity of the homodimer. Taken together, these findings
expand our understanding of the temporal and spatial compartmentalization of West Nile virus
subtypes within North America.

Background
West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae and in particular, part of the Japanese encephalitis
serocomplex. It consists of a single-stranded positive-

sense RNA genome that is contained in a virion that is
approximately 50 nm in diameter [1]. The polyprotein
produced from the single open reading frame is subsequently processed into ten proteins, including three struc-

tural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane/membrane, and
envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A,
NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [1]. WNV infection in
vertebrates usually results in a minor or imperceptible
response, although it can occasionally develop into a
severe disease with central nervous system complications
leading to permanent disability or death [2]. Prior to
1999, WNV was isolated to the eastern hemisphere, occurring regularly in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe. Since
its introduction in 1999, WNV has spread throughout
North, Central, and South America [3]. The epicenter of
this introduction is considered the greater New York City
area and it has radiated out from there. The originally
introduced strain (designated NY99) was shown to be
genetically similar to a strain isolated during an outbreak
in Israel during 1998 [4] and was considered to be the
dominant variant circulating through North America until
2002. During that year, a variant arose (designated
WN02) which replaced the NY99 strain and has since
become widespread throughout North America [5]. It has
been suggested that the reason for this shift was due to the
ability of the WN02 strain to be transmitted after two
fewer days of extrinsic incubation compared to the NY99
strain, thereby giving it a competitive edge [6]. This shift
occurred during 2002 and 2003, which also coincided
with a peak in human cases of WNV infections [7], suggesting the importance of viral variant emergence.
As WNV has spread throughout North America, it has created occasional outbreaks corresponding to its arrival in
naïve populations. The large numbers of birds affected in
the initial introduction in the New York City area, in particular crows and a variety of exotic birds, were accompanied by WNV infection in humans and equines resulting
in fatalities [2,4,8,9]. As WNV continued to spread
throughout North America, the largest outbreak of meningitis or encephalitis ever recorded in the western hemisphere occurred in 2002 and 2003 and was directly
attributed to WNV [3]. Florida, with its sub-tropical and
tropical climate leading to the possibility for year-round
transmission, decreased extrinsic incubation period due
to increased temperatures, and transmission-competent
mosquito populations alongside major bird migratory
pathways and over wintering sites would appear to be fertile ground for major WNV outbreaks and diversification
[10]. Conversely, there has been little WNV activity in
Florida to date. The lack of WNV activity could be due to
anthropogenic reasons, such as the existence of stringent
mosquito control efforts already in place throughout the
majority of the state, such as impoundments and aerial
pesticide applications and the prevalence of climate control measures such as air conditioning and screening limiting human contact with infected mosquitoes [11].
Alternatively, this could possibly be due to the pressure of
St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), a native flavivirus,

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/106

competing with WNV [12]. It may be that there are greater
constraints on WNV movement and evolution in Florida
than previously thought.
Accordingly, we undertook a genotyping study of WNV
isolates from 2005 in Florida, as well as a previous isolate
provided to us as a positive control, which was collected
in 2003. In particular, we sequenced portions of the
genome encoding the envelope protein and the NS3/
NS4A region to compare our isolates to those collected
throughout the country and deposited in Genbank. The
region encoding the envelope protein was chosen due to
its likelihood of containing antigenically relevant mutations as it is likely to undergo selection pressures due to its
position on the outside of the viral capsid and subsequent
interactions with host immune systems. We were also
interested in determining whether or not our isolates contained a previously reported mutation in the envelope
region encoding for an amino acid substitution characteristic of the WN02 strain compared to the NY99 strain, a
shift from Val to Ala at amino acid 159 of the envelope
region encoded for by a U to C substitution at nucleic acid
position 1442. The NS3/NS4A region was chosen specifically for the high incidence of previously reported mutations in the NS3 region [13] and the importance of the
NS3 region on viral replication. The NS3 region encodes
for four proteins, including a serine protease involved in
cleaving the translated polyprotein, as well as a nucleotide
triphosphatase, a RNA 5'triphosphatase, and a helicase
involved with viral RNA replication.

Materials and methods
Mosquito pools were collected during the summer of
2005 from field sites in Duval, Indian River, and Manatee
counties in Florida [14]. These field sites were selected for
monitoring during the 2005 season based on WNV and
SLEV activity during the preceding two years. Manatee
County (27°34'25"N, 82°28'30"W), Indian River County
(27°34'27"N, 80°26'11 "W), and Duval County
(30°20'50 "N, 81°52'37 "W) each contained one trap site
with four traps and covered a wide geographic area. The
three field sites were comprised of a variety of ecosystems.
Duval County is a Florida scrub ecosystem, with variety of
pine trees and saw palmetto [15], while the Indian River
County and Manatee County sites are both temperate
hardwood forests [16]. The Indian River County site is a
Sabal palm hammock located near cultivated orange and
palm groves. The Manatee County site is a hardwood forest frequently inundated with standing water following a
rainfall event; though it is not wet enough to be considered a hydric hammock swamp [17].
Mosquitoes were captured using lard can traps baited with
a live chicken. The mosquitoes were then sorted by sex
and species into pools of up to 50 after being killed en

masse by freezing at -20°C. Once the pools of up to 50
mosquitoes were created, 900 μL of BA-1 diluent [18]
were added to each 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the mosquitoes along with 4.5 mm zinc-plated beads
(BB-caliber air gun shot). Samples were homogenized at
25 Hz for 3 min (TissueLyser; Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA)
and centrifuged at 4°C and 3,148 × g for 4 min. The resulting mosquito homogenate was used for initial screening
purposes via plaque assay and then resampled for confirmation and isolation for sequencing.
All 4009 pools created from mosquitoes collected during
the 2005 surveillance period were initially screened via
plaque assay and suspected positives reexamined via qRTPCR with WNV specific primers and probe using the
LightCycler® 480 system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
and Superscript™ III One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time TaqMan RT-PCR was carried out as described previously for
WNV [18,19]. Samples were amplified using the following operation guidelines: 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 2
min, 45 cycles of alternating temperatures of 95°C for 10
s and 60°C for 15 s, followed by 50°C for 30 s.
Upon confirmation of the positive pools (table 1), 100 μL
of the clarified supernatant from the positive mosquito
pool homogenate were passed once though Vero cells.
Half of the media was stored in a cryoprotective viral storage media (4% gelatin, sucrose 40%, BSA 4% in PBS pH
7.2) and frozen in vapor-phase LN2 and the other half of
the media was considered viral stock for further testing.
250 μL of the viral stocks were neutralized and RNA was
extracted according to the MagNA Pure Total NA extraction kit protocols (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
The subsequent RNA was eluted in a volume of 50 μL and
stored at -80°C. Later, the RNA was converted to cDNA
under standard thermocycling conditions using the
SuperScript™ One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum® Taq kit by
Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and our specific
sequencing primers (table 2). These primers were
designed to amplify overlapping sections of the genome

in their denoted sections. The envelope region was composed of two sections, after alignment and trimming, the
completed envelope section was from nucleotide positions 1081 to 2377. The NS3 region was composed of
three sections, after alignment and trimming, the completed NS3 region was from nucleotide positions 5124 to
6735.
The resulting cDNA was dye terminated with the GenomeLab™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing with Quick Start
Kit (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and sequenced
using a Beckman-Coulter CEQ8000 sequencer. The results
were analyzed using the CEQ sequence analysis software
to create consensus sequences which were then aligned
using GeneDoc™ software to create contiguous sequences
from the overlapping segments for use in phylogenetic
analysis. Several phylogenetic trees were computed using
MEGA 4: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software utilizing the maximum parsimony method with 500
bootstraps along with reference sequences from GenBank
(table 3). Nucleotide diversity was also calculated utilizing the MEGA 4: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software using the maximum composite likelihood
method with 1000 replicates.

Results
Our phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequence along
with the corresponding sequences from several other
strains obtained from GenBank showed that the isolates
from Florida were clustered mostly together with the
exception of isolate #967 (figure 1). This isolate was one
of six collected over a 58 day period beginning August the
23rd and ending September the 30th. This isolate appears
to be part of the 2002 North American clade, as defined
by Ebel et al. [5], yet it has two additional substitutions at
nucleotide positions 2209 and 2233 (both G to A) that
lead to two translated amino acid substitutions at 415
(Ala to Thr) and 423 (Asp to Asn) respectively.
Our phylogenetic analysis of the NS3/NS4A sequences
along with the corresponding sequences from several
other strains obtained from GenBank showed that our
isolates from Florida in 2005 grouped together, with the
exception of isolate #558 (figure 2). This was the only isolate obtained from Manatee County, which is located on
the Gulf (Western) coast of Florida, compared to the other
sites in Duval and Indian River Counties on the Atlantic
(Eastern) coast. Despite there being six positive pools collected in Duval county versus one each from Manatee and
Indian River counties, minimum infection rate values, as
calculated by Vitek et al., did not differ significantly geographically or temporally for this trapping period[14].
The Florida isolates contained numerous variable nucleotide and amino acid sites from the reference sequences,

as well as each other; however most of these were not phylogenetically informative nor encoded any amino acid
substitutions (table 4). This resulted in substantial distance calculations within the Florida 2005 isolates cohort.
These distances were notably greater than the distance calculations from all other regions combined, which encompassed greater geographic and temporal domains (table
5).
One silent nucleotide mutation caused the Manatee
County sample 558 to cluster with several of the reference
sequences that were also from the Gulf coast area or in the
western part of the country. These were two samples from

Georgia and three from Texas, as well as one from Arizona, one from Colorado, and two from New York from
2002 to 2004.
A cluster of amino acid substitutions was found in the
envelope of sample 2186, the single isolate from Indian
River County collected during 2005 during our surveillance efforts. This sample was isolated from a mosquito
pool collected on November 1st, which makes it the last
isolate collected during 2005. At three amino acid sites
towards the end of the envelope protein sequence, amino
acid residues 394, 397, and 400 were substituted from Asn
to Ile, Trp to Gly, and Ser to Phe; respectively. These resi-

dues are associated with a set of histidines at the base of
the envelope protein in domain III suggested to have a
role in envelope homodimer conformation (figure 3).

Discussion
Subsequent to our genetic analysis, it was apparent that all
of our field isolates from Florida in 2005 contained the
previously mentioned substitution at nucleotide position
1442 (U to C), which resulted in an amino acid substitution at E159 (Val to Ala). Interestingly, the WNV isolate
collected in Indian River County during 2003 (WNFL03p2-3) and supplied to us as our positive control did
not contain that particular mutation. This leads us to
believe that the timeframe for the introduction of the
North American clade containing the E159 substitution
into Florida was sometime between 2003 and 2005.

Furthermore, the 2005 isolates did not group with our
field positive control strain FL03p2-3, which appeared
more closely related to a cluster of isolates from Mexico,
Colorado, and Ohio based on NS3/NS4A phylogeny. This
could be the result of a difference in bird migration and
overwintering patterns, such as between groups of birds
flying along the eastern seaboard to overwinter in the Caribbean versus birds flying to the southeast to overwinter
or continue along the Gulf coast to sites in central and
South America [20].
In isolate 2186, the substitutions located immediately
preceding, in between, and behind a group of histidines in
Domain III of the envelope protein caught our attention.
Histidines located on the envelope protein have been
shown to be structurally conserved among Flaviviruses

[21]. They have also been hypothesized to play a role in
various conformational changes [22]. Of particular interest are the substitutions at 394 (Asp to Ile) and 400 (Ser to
Phe), as these changes swap two polar residues with two
nonpolar ones, perhaps leading to a change in the positioning of the neighboring histidines. Such a repositioning of these histidines could alter the conformation of the
envelope, perhaps changing the antigenicity of the
homodimer.
We also detected greater nucleotide diversity within the
Florida 2005 isolates than within other regions as a
whole, suggesting that conditions in Florida might still
encourage genotypic diversification, even if transmission

is low. In order to ascertain whether this was a phenomenon unique to Florida the mean genetic distances were
calculated for another subset of our sequences, samples
from the state of New York from 2001 to 2003 spanning
comparable geographic distances but over the course of
several years. Despite the larger temporal range in the
samples, we found the isolates from a single year in Florida to be more diverse (table 6).
In addition, to determine if this greater nucleotide diversity within Florida during 2005 was representative of an
increase in nucleotide diversity as a general trend for that
year, we included representative samples from the state of
Illinois collected in 2005 [23] to our mean genetic dis-

Florida 2005 isolates. In comparison, the cohort of isolates collected in Florida during 2005 had a mean genetic
distance of 0.0089 ± 0.0015, suggesting differing evolutionary constraints between these two regions.

Conclusion
Taken together, these findings expand our understanding
of the temporal and spatial compartmentalization of West
Nile virus subtypes within North America. It would
appear that the introduction of the North American clade
into Florida occurred sometime between 2003 and 2005.
The method of introduction may have a geographic or
migratory component, due to a similarity of the original
isolate to those from Ohio, Colorado, and Mexico that is
not seen with the isolates from 2005. Along with the
greater genetic diversity among the isolates collected in
2005 compared to those from larger geographic and temporal zones, an isolate was collected that contained several amino acid substitutions associated with histadine
residues located in biologically important areas of the
envelope protein. These findings confirm the need to continue to monitor and highlight the uniqueness of the
development of the West Nile virus in Florida.
