Abstract
Background: The Runt DNA binding domain (Runx) defines a metazoan family of sequencespecific transcription factors with essential roles in animal ontogeny and stem cell based
development. Depending on cis-regulatory context, Runx proteins mediate either transcriptional
activation or repression. In many contexts Runx-mediated repression is carried out by Groucho/
TLE, recruited to the transcriptional complex via a C-terminal WRPY sequence motif that is found
encoded in all heretofore known Runx genes.
Findings: Full-length Runx genes were identified in the recently sequenced genomes of
phylogenetically diverse metazoans, including placozoans and sponges, the most basally branching
members of that clade. No sequences with significant similarity to the Runt domain were found in
the genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, confirming that Runx is a metazoan
apomorphy. A contig assembled from genomic sequences of the haplosclerid demosponge
Amphimedon queenslandica was used to construct a model of the single Runx gene from that species,
AmqRunx, the veracity of which was confirmed by expressed sequences. The encoded sequence of
the Runx protein OscRunx from the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmella was also
obtained from assembled ESTs. Remarkably, a syntenic linkage between Runx and Supt3h, previously
reported in vertebrates, is conserved in A. queenslandica. Whereas OscRunx encodes a C-terminal
Groucho-recruitment motif, AmqRunx does not, although a Groucho homologue is found in the A.
queenslandica genome.
Conclusion: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that sponges are paraphyletic, and
suggest that Runx-WRPY mediated recruitment of Groucho to cis-regulatory sequences originated
in the ancestors of eumetazoans following their divergence from demosponges.

Findings
The Runt domain (Runx) is a highly conserved 128 amino
acid sequence motif that defines a metazoan family of
sequence-specific DNA binding proteins required for the
ontogeny of each of the animal species in which it has
been functionally studied, as well as for the regulation of
somatic stem cells and development of the lineages to
which they give rise [1-4]. Runx genes facilitate developmental coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation [1], integrating the transduction of multiple
signalling pathways [2] by nucleating the assembly of signal-responsive cis-regulatory modules [5]. Runx genes
have only been found in animals [6,7], suggesting that
they may have evolved in concert with metazoan systems
for developmental signalling.
All heretofore known Runx genes encode proteins that
bear at their C-terminus a WRPY sequence motif (or a
close variant thereof), which functions to recruit the
Groucho/TLE corepressor to the cis-regulatory system [812]. Runx-WRPY mediated recruitment of Groucho is relatively weak and controlled by cis-regulatory sequence
context [12,13]. Depending on such context, Runx proteins can also function as Groucho-independent repressors, as well as activators [8,14].
The purpose of this study was to extend our previous
investigation of the evolution of Runx genes [6] by analyzing and comparing several new Runx gene sequences collected from recently sequenced genomes of
lophotrochozoans and basally branching metazoans (see
Additional File 1 for detailed methods). Although cnidarian and sponge Runx genes were described in a recent
report [7], that study left open the question of whether the
sponge Runx proteins bear a C-terminal Groucho recruitment motif. To address that question we examined Runxencoding genomic and cDNA sequences from two
sponges (Amphimedon queenslandica and Oscarella carmela), and compared these to Runx sequences collected
from a phylogenetically broad sampling of other metazoan genomes, including that of the placozoan Trichoplax
adhaerens [15].
Runx is a metazoan synapomorphy that has undergone
independent duplications in a subset of triploblast lineages
Figure 1 depicts several representative examples of previously known [6,7] or newly revealed (Table 1) Runx genes
from across metazoan phylogeny, clustered according to
the phylogenetic topology obtained by Sperling et al. [16].
As recently shown by Sullivan et al. [7], Runx-encoding
sequences extend to the base of the metazoan family tree,
with single orthologues encoded in the genome of the
haplosclerid demosponge A. queenslandica and in
expressed sequence tags from the homoscleromorph
sponge O. carmela. Similarly, the anthozoan cnidarian

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/59

Nematostella vectensis and the placozoan Trichoplax adherens each have a single Runx gene, as do several triploblast
species, including the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae and
the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis among deuterostomes; the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans among ecdysozoans; and
the polychaete Capitella sp.I and the mollusk Lottia
gigantea among lophotrochozoans. In contrast, vertebrates, sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), dipteran
insects (Drosophila melanogaster), clitellate annelids
(Helobdella robusta), and planarians (Schmidtea mediterranea) each have two or more Runx genes.
Comparison of the gene architectures suggests that the
primordial Runx gene contained three introns, the first of
which interrupts the coding sequence of the Runt domain
(found in every representative except for the insect runt
orthologues), the second of which lies at the C-terminal
end of the Runt domain (found in all of the representatives except two, HrRunx2 and LgRunx, both from lophotrochozoans), and the third lying between the two exons
that encode the poorly conserved C-terminal sequence of
the protein (missing in three of the insect genes and one
of the leech genes; Fig. 1). This basic four-exon architecture is displayed by the demosponge, placozoan and
anthozoan Runx genes, and among the known triploblast
Runx genes, by the two sea urchin paralogues, the single
lancelet orthologue, and the two planarian paralogues.
Except for the additional intron within the sequence that
encodes the N-terminal half of the Runt domain in all the
vertebrate paralogues (Fig. 1), the basal architecture is
conserved in vertebrate Runx3, which supports previous
propositions for that gene being the most ancient of the
vertebrate paralogues [17]. The additional N-terminal
intron in Runx3, which is also found in each of the other
vertebrate Runx paralogues, is also found in the C. intestinalis orthologue (but not in the cephalochordate B. floridae), consistent with recent phylogenies that place
cephalochordates basal to {urochordates+vertebrates} in
the chordate lineage [18].
To confirm and extend previous analyses of Runx family
relations [6,7], we used our expanded Runx sequence
dataset to calculate trees by Bayesian, distance neighborjoining (NJ), and maximum likelihood (ML) methods.
The three trees have slightly different topologies; the Bayesian tree is shown in Figure 2A. All three analyses confidently support the branch separating the two sponge
Runx genes from eumetazoan genes. Additionally, the
protostome and chordate clades are recovered in all three
trees but the positions of cnidarian, placozoan, and echinoderm genes differ between analyses. While only the NJ
tree places echinoderms correctly inside a deuterostome
clade, this clade also erroneously includes cnidarian and
placozoan genes. Bayesian and ML analyses correctly
place the latter two genes at the base of the bilaterian clade

Figure 1 structure of Runx
Schematic (see previous page) genes from the major metazoan clades
Schematic structure of Runx genes from the major metazoan clades. Scale models of Runx genes described previously [6,7] from mouse (Mus musculus, Mm), sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis, Ci), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster, Dm), nematode
worm (Caenorhabditis elegans, Ce), and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis, Nv) are shown in comparison to new models
obtained from various recent genome projects (Table 1). The latter include Runx genes from lancelet (Branchiostoma floridae,
Bf), sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Sp, corrected; the arrow points to an intron that was previously missed [6,21]),
leech (Helobdella robusta, Hr), polychaete (Capitella sp. I, CspI), snail (Lottia gigantea) planarian (Schmidtea mediterranea, Sm), placozoan (Trichoplax adherens, Ta), and demosponge (Amphimedon queesnslandica, Amq). The Runt domain is shaded grey and
black, with the black box denoting the highly conserved exon encoding its C-terminal end. The C-terminal WRPY Grouchorecruitment motif is shaded Red. A hypothetical model of the homoscleromorph sponge Runx gene (Oscarella carmela, Osc) is
shown; although as yet there is no genomic sequence from which exon-intron structure of this gene can be inferred (as indicated by question marks), the predicted exonic coding sequences containing the Runt domain and C-terminal LWRPY are represented in assembled ESTs.

but wrongly group echinoderm genes with protostome
genes. Relationships within the protostomes are unclear
and none of the three analyses separates these genes into
lophotrochozoan and ecdysozoan clades. This may be
due to long-branch attraction between the Runx genes
from S. mediterranea, H. robusta, and C. elegans. Thus,
these genes were removed in a second set of analyses (Fig.
2B), where a lophotrochozoan clade and a clade comprising the four D. melanogaster genes are recovered in all
three trees. These analyses suggest that there was only one
Runx gene in the lineage between the metazoan and the
lophotrochozoan-ecdysozoan last common ancestors.
Hence, the multiple Runx genes present in some of the
animals in this study are most likely the products of independent duplications within each of the lineages [6] (Fig.
1, colored boxes; note that a second sea urchin Runx gene,
SpRunt-2, was recently found to be encoded in the sea
urchin genome [19,20], in contradiction to several previous reports [1,6,7,21]).
Previous reports have noted the absence of any Runx
homologues in sequenced genomes of unicellular organisms [6,7], including the choanoflagellate M. brevicolis
[22], a member of the Holozoa taxon that is most closely
related to Metazoa. We confirmed the absence of a Runx

sequence motif in the M. brevicolis genome using tBLASTn
searches. Thus, the Runt domain appears to have evolved
in concert with complex multicellularity in the animal
clade. Furthermore, unlike many other metazoan-specific
transcription factor classes [23], the Runx gene did not
duplicate in early animals, or even within some of the
bilaterian lineages.
AmqRunx lacks a Groucho recruitment motif
As reported previously [7], Runx genes are found in both
the haplosclerid demosponge A. queenslandica and the
homoscleromorph sponge O. carmela. Although genome
sequence is not yet available for the latter, a sequence
encoding a Runx protein was recovered from an assembly
of available ESTs. The predicted OscRunx protein terminates with the amino acid sequence WRPY (Fig. 3) [see
Additional File 2], the C-terminal Groucho-recruitment
motif found encoded in all heretofore known Runx genes
(Fig. 1). Note that there are vertebrate splice variants that
lack a C-terminal WRPY [24-26], and that one each of the
two leech and two planarian paralogues do not appear to
terminate in WRPY (Fig. 1) [see Additional File 2]. Thus,
some contexts have functional requirements for Runx protein isoforms lacking a C-terminal WRPY. Nevertheless,
all of the eumetazoan species depicted in Fig. 1 (as well as

the homoscleromorph sponge) encode at least one Runx
protein that terminates in WRPY or a close variant thereof.
A genomic sequence contig from A. queenslandica was predicted to encode a Runx gene with four exons, displaying
an architecture very similar to that of the placozoan and
cnidarian genes (Fig. 1) [7]. The predicted coding
sequence of AmqRunx is 1,566 bp with the Runt domain
contained within the first 474 bp. As is typical for Runx
proteins, the predicted C-terminal domain of AmqRunx
(amino acid residues 159–479) is enriched for proline
(12%), serine (16%), and threonine (7%) residues, a PST
enrichment similar to that previously reported for the Cterminal domain of NvRunx [7] and that displayed by the
C-terminal domain of OscRunx (Fig. 3). Surprisingly
however, the C-terminus of AmqRunx does not bear the
WRPY motif or any variant thereof (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
no open reading frames encoding WRPY were found
along the genomic contig in which AmqRunx is found. The
A. queenslandica genome does however encode a bona fide
Groucho homologue (Additional File 3 and unpublished
data), as well as several transcription factors that are predicted to interact with Groucho [12], including a hairy/
Hey homologue with a FRPW motif and a number of NK
class genes with an engrailed homology 1 (EH-1) motif
([27,28]; BMD, unpublished data).
The lack of a C-terminal WRPY motif in AmqRunx was verified by expressed sequence data. Based on alignment
with genomic DNA, EST sequence 2941805_1 was found
to encode the last 115 bp of the AmqRunx coding
sequence, the stop codon, and an additional 626 bp of 3'
UTR spanning two exons. In order to confirm that this EST
was transcribed from AmqRunx, oligonucleotide primers –
forward primer in the Runt domain and reverse primer in

the EST-encoded 3' UTR region – were used to amplify the
sequence both from A. queenslandica adult and embryonic
RNA. An amplicon of the correct size and sequence was
obtained (Additional File 4), thus confirming the veracity
of the AmqRunx gene prediction.
The contig bearing AmqRunx contains sequences predictive of additional genes flanking the Runx gene (Fig. 4),
which argues against the possibility that the AmqRunx
gene model is missing a C-terminal exon that might produce alternative splice variants. Moreover, the veracity of
the contig assembly is further supported by the remarkable fact that a syntenic relationship between Runx and
Supt3h, previously reported to exist in vertebrates [29] and
which we found also to exist in cnidarians (N. vectensis),
lancelets (B. floridae), and polychaetes (Capitella sp. I), is
conserved in the demosponge (Fig. 4).
Although homoscleromorph sponges are still commonly
grouped with demosponges in the phylum Porifera (Fig.
5A), this classification has been called into question, as
has the monophyly of sponges (and hence 'Porifera' as a
true phylum) [16]. The fact that AmqRunx lacks a C-terminal WRPY motif is consistent with the more recent proposition that sponges are paraphyletic [16,30], with
calcisponges and homoscleromorphs branching after
demosponges along the lineage leading to eumetazoans
(Fig. 5B). The conventional scenario, which holds that
sponges are monophyletic (Fig. 5A), would require that
several characters held in common between eumetazoans
and homoscleromorph sponges (i.e., acrosomes, true epithelia, and a C-terminal WRPY motif linked to Runx) be
either convergent homoplasies, or metazoan pleisiomorphies that were all lost in the demosponge lineage leading
to A. queenslandica. Although it is possible that the loss of

rubripes; [29]).

Scenarios for Runx-WRPY evolution mapped onto alternative metazoan phylogenies
Scenarios for Runx-WRPY evolution mapped onto alternative metazoan phylogenies. (A) Conventional phylogeny
wherein the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Amq) and the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela (Osc) are both
classified as demosponges within the phylum Porifera. This scenario suggests that the WRPY motif was lost in the demosponge
sub-lineage leading to Amq. (B) Alternative phylogeny wherein sponges are paraphyletic. In this tree homoscleromorphs are a
sister group of eumetazoans within Epitheliozoa [16], which would imply that Runx gained the WRPY motif in the ancestors of
the latter group following their divergence from demosponges, either prior to or after divergence from calcisponges.
multiple characters occurred within the demosponge lineage, it is unlikely that body plan simplification is in itself
sufficient to relax the selection pressure for maintaining
the Runx-WRPY linkage, as evidenced by its maintenance
in placozoans. The more parsimonious scenario is that the
C-terminal WRPY motif of Runx proteins, and presumably the consequent recruitment of Groucho to a subset of
Runx target cis-regulatory modules, originated in eumetazoan ancestors following their divergence from the
sponge lineage leading to A. queenslandica (Fig. 5B). An
interesting possibility is that the Runx associated WRPY
motif originated in Epitheliozoa {eumetazoans and
homoscleromorphs} [16], which would suggest that
Runx-WRPY mediated cis-regulatory recruitment of Groucho is functionally linked to the evolution and development of an epithelium. Testing this possibility awaits the
sequencing of a calcisponge Runx gene.
