Abstract
Background: It has recently been demonstrated that organism identifications can be recovered
from mass spectra using various methods including base-specific fragmentation of nucleic acids.
Because mass spectrometry is extremely rapid and widely available such techniques offer significant
advantages in some applications. A key element in favor of mass spectrometric analysis of RNA
fragmentation patterns is that a reference database for analysis of the results can be generated from
sequence information. In contrast to hybridization approaches, the genetic affinity of any unknown
isolate can in principle be determined within the context of all previously sequenced 16S rRNAs
without prior knowledge of what the organism is. In contrast to the original RNase T1 cataloging
method, when digestion products are analyzed by mass spectrometry, products with the same base
composition cannot be distinguished. Hence, it is possible that organisms that are not closely
related (having different underlying sequences) might be falsely identified by mass spectral
coincidence. We present a convenient spectral coincidence function for expressing the degree of
similarity (or distance) between any two mass-spectra. Trees constructed using this function are
consistent with those produced by direct comparison of primary sequences, demonstrating that
the inherent degeneracy in mass spectrometric analysis of RNA fragments does not preclude
correct organism identification.
Results: Neighbor-joining trees for important bacterial pathogens were generated using distances
based on mass spectrometric observables and the spectral coincidence function. These trees
demonstrate that most pathogens will be readily distinguished using mass spectrometric analyses
of RNA digestion products. A more detailed, genus-level analysis of pathogens and near relatives
was also performed, and it was found that assignments of genetic affinity were consistent with those
obtained by direct sequence comparisons. Finally, typical values of the coincidence between
organisms were also examined with regard to phylogenetic level and sequence variability.
Conclusion: Cluster analysis based on comparison of mass spectrometric observables using the
spectral coincidence function is an extremely useful tool for determining the genetic affinity of an
unknown bacterium. Additionally, fragmentation patterns can determine within hours if an
unknown isolate is potentially a known pathogen among thousands of possible organisms, and if so,
which one.

Background
Determinative bacteriology often relies on culture-based
methods involving time-consuming isolation, cultivation,
and characterization of phenotypic traits. While in a few
cases a rapid identification can be made using phenotypic
methods, the phylogenetic resolution of such methods is
usually quite low. Characterization of cells based on morphology, staining, and metabolic traits is often not discriminatory and can take days to weeks for unambiguous
identification [1-3]. Perhaps most importantly, many
pathogens are fastidious or even uncultivable under laboratory conditions, so that culture-based methods are not
applicable. Finally, such methods are labor-intensive, not
amenable to automation, and require extensive "handson" time and interpretation by the trained microbiologist.
In the "post-genome" era, molecular methods are rapidly
supplanting phenotypic characterization. Although a variety of nucleic acid based approaches are in use, most current bacterial diagnostic research is focused on
comparative sequencing of PCR-amplified genes, in situ
hybridization with labeled probes or molecular beacons,
and phylogenetic microarrays [4-11]. Methods that rely
on hybridization are effective at leveraging genomic information, but they typically face the significant drawback of
requiring construction of one or more probes based on a
priori knowledge of the genus or species that needs to be
detected. Complete or partial genomic sequencing
requires no such preliminary knowledge, but even the
fastest sequencing separations requiring minutes or hours
are time-consuming compared to mass spectrometry
[12,13]. In contrast to sequencing by capillary electrophoresis which requires a labeling step, as we will
describe, in vitro transcription and fragmentation reactions may be analyzed by rapid mass spectrometry, such
that the greatest gains in overall efficiency are had when
processing multiple samples.
Mass spectrometry for sequencing and compositional
characterization
A number of methods for characterization of nucleic acids
using mass spectrometric analysis have been proposed.
Among these, MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry is the
method of choice for measuring the mass of oligonucleotides, especially mixtures thereof. Employing this idea,
MALDI-TOF has been used for chain-termination
sequencing [14-18]. However, the maximum read length
so far demonstrated using such an approach is ~56 nucleotides [14]. Very high resolution measurement of PCR
product composition (~100 bp) using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance (ESIFTICR) for microbial identification has also been proposed [19,20]. Unfortunately, the resolution required for
unambiguous compositional assignment (+/- 1 ppm) of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/321

such large molecules requires instrumentation out of
reach for many laboratories. Given these limitations, it is
advantageous to introduce a fragmentation step, which
reduces the resolution requirements while retaining valuable information. In this regard, analysis of 16S rRNA
fragmentation patterns produced by RNase T1 was used
with great success to determine phylogenetic relationships
between bacteria (prior to the onset of modern sequencing technologies) [21-25]. Early studies suggest that
despite the information loss associated with compositional rather than sequential analysis of such fragments,
microbial identification based upon base-specific fragmentation patterns appears extremely promising [26-31].
In this paper, we compare genetic affinities deduced from
observable mass fragment spectra and phylogenies based
on complete 16S rRNA sequences of the same organisms
using neighbor-joining [32] to construct distance-based
trees. This approach allows us to examine the extent to
which unrelated organisms might be incorrectly identified
by mere coincidence of mass spectral patterns and to
determine the degree (i.e. family-, genus-, or species-level)
to which the genetic affinity of various organisms may be
resolved. Using a straightforward spectral comparison
metric, we derive distance matrices. Neighbor-joining
trees are then constructed to obtain insight into the limit
of resolution of the method when a single cleavage reaction is used. These in silico analyses were based on an
experimentally reasonable protocol: First, universal primers (appended with 5'-RNA polymerase promoters) are
used to amplify a homologous sequence region of the 16S
rDNA from the organism(s) in a sample. Next, the DNA
amplicons are transcribed to RNA and subjected to basespecific fragmentation. The mass of the resulting products
is then determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
Finally, measured masses are cataloged and compared to
mass databases derived from rRNA sequence databases to
determine the genetic affinity of the sample organism.
Comparison of mass spectra
In order to quantitatively inter-compare mass spectral
"fingerprints" produced by base-specific fragmentation,
we formulated the scalar- or inner-product defined by
equation 1. We define a scalar product (often referred to
as a 'dot-product') of two mass spectra as
N1 N2

〈 M, M′〉 = M • M′ ≡ M′∑ ∑ δ (mi − m′j )
i =1 j =1

(1)

where mi are the masses of each of the N1 individual fragments in the spectrum for species 1 and m'j are the masses
of each of the N2 fragments for species 2, and δ is the discrete (Kronecker) delta function defined as

δ (k) = ⎨

(2)

It can be easily verified that the following commutative,
distributive, and positive-definiteness conditions for an
inner-product are satisfied:
M1 • M2 = M2 • M1
(α1M1 + α 2 M2 ) • M3 = α1M1 • M3 + α 2 M2 • M3
M1 • M1 > 0 ∀ M1 ≠ [0]

( 3a-c )

Using this inner-product, we then define the following
metric or "coincidence function":

cij = c(Mi , Mj ) =

2 × Mi • Mj
(Mi • Mi ) + (Mj • Mj )

(4)

This function provides a normalized (i.e. between 0 and
1) representation of the extent to which two spectra are
similar. Using this metric, a coincidence (or similarity)
matrix, C with elements cij can be generated to tabulate the
degree of similarity between the fragment catalogs of
every pair of organisms. Likewise, a matrix of distances, D
with elements dij = (1 - cij) can be created, and used as
input to conventional cluster analysis algorithms.
Universal primers directed at bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA)
Since the early demonstration that phylogenetic information is obtainable from catalogs of RNase T1 digests of 16S
rRNA [21-25], comparison of 16S rRNA (or rDNA)
sequences has become the most widely used single molecular method to characterize the phylogenetic position or
genetic affinity of Bacteria and Archaea. Over 180,000
accessions containing partial or full rDNA sequences are
available from the Ribosomal Database Project (as of RDP
release 9.32, 72,540 sequences are of length 1200 nt or
more) [5].

Weisburg [33] and Lane [34] have previously reported
"universal" primers yielding PCR products from various
16S rDNA (or rRNA) sequence regions for a large fraction
of all known bacteria. When present, these primers yield
almost full coverage of the approximately 1,500 bp 16S
sequence, and have thus been used routinely for phylogenetic study. In addition to primer sequences shared by
many organisms, primer pairs yielding amplicons of ~500
bp or less are also of interest because the mass spectra
acquired from such shorter regions will have minimal
complexity. For example, transcription and subsequent
RNase T1 cleavage of a 400 bp amplicon will typically
yield only ~22–25 distinct RNA fragment masses [31].

Organisms of greatest interest
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) has prioritized research on a number of organisms categorized as "Category A, B, or C" pathogens for
the purposes of epidemic prevention and for biodefense
[35-37]. To examine to what extent mass spectrometric
methods might resolve these organisms from one another
(using the primer sets above) all the 16S rDNA sequences
of every bacterial strain listed in NIAID Categories A, B, or
C were downloaded. In some cases an entire genus such as
Salmonella, for example, is specified. Based on initial
experimental results, we expected to obtain at least genuslevel resolution and, in many cases, species-level resolution of bacteria using masses cataloged from just a single
cleavage reaction. Of course, since pathogenicity can arise
from minor genomic changes (presence of plasmid, a single gene, changes in regulation, etc.) even complete 16S
rRNA sequencing cannot always distinguish pathogenic
strains from non-pathogenic strains. For example, pathogenic strains of E. coli have the same rRNA sequence as
non-pathogenic strains. Thus, the best possible outcome
in these cases is to assign an unknown organism to a
genus or species whose members include pathogens.

With large databases of predicted mass-fragment catalogs
in hand (typically ~20–25 masses from a given "universally amplifiable" 16S rDNA sequence subregion), we calculated thousands of mass-spectral coincidences between
all catalogs using equation 4. We investigated the average
value of the coincidence function at different phylogenetic levels for a number of organism lineages and compared coincidence values to the average entropy of several
multi-sequence alignments. Finally, we used coincidence
values to generate distance matrices and these distances
were placed in a format acceptable for input into the
freely-available program MEGA 3.1 for generating neighbor-joining trees [38].

Results
Occurrence of the adjacent Weisburg and Lane primer
pairs
To ultimately obtain mass spectra of minimal complexity
while still retaining valuable information, we sought to
segment the analysis of 16S-derived fragment masses into
subregions of the gene. We therefore only investigated the
occurrence of immediately adjacent Weisburg or Lane
universal primers. Table 1 gives the sequences of the Weisburg and Lane primer sets tested, the occurrence of the
exact matches to the adjacent primer pairs, as well as the
average length of the predicted amplicon and standard
deviation. Though Lane described his primers in the context of reverse transcription, the sequences in Table 1 are
the literal search strings queried against the sense-strand
16S rDNA sequences as published in the RDP. While we
included all reported degeneracies in our search, we did

not account for any organisms which might have not
returned exact matches due to indeterminate bases in their
sequence. As can be seen, at least in this straightforward
analysis, the "Lane-AB" and "Lane-BC" amplicons (corresponding to positions 519 – 926 and 907 – 1406, respectively in E. coli 16S rDNA) are obtainable for ~80% of all
bacteria, and this can most likely be increased by employing conditions of "mismatch-tolerant" PCR.
Spectral coincidence vs. phylogenetic level and positional
entropy
Because mass-based identification, while rapid, involves
an inherent loss of sequence information (the fragments
AAUUCG and UUAACG, for example, have the same
mass) compared to both complete sequencing and 16S
rRNA cataloging, it is important to understand the extent
to which base-specific fragment patterns correlate with
complete 16S rRNA phylogenies at various phylogenetic

levels. Obviously two organisms with identical underlying sequences will have a mass spectral coincidence of 1.0.
To investigate how quickly this value falls off from 1.0 at
various levels of relatedness and to determine if the trend
is consistent within different lineages, we calculated the
average coincidence at the species- through phylum-levels
for a number of different organisms. Figure 1 shows representative results for organisms in the various phylogenetic groupings of the lineages of Escherichia coli and
Clostridium botulinum. RNase T1fragment masses derived
from only the "Lane-AB" universal amplicon were used
for the calculations; error bars are 1 standard deviation.
For instance, a species-level coincidence in Figure 1 is calculated from all "Lane-AB" amplifiable strains of a particular species; a genus-level from all species in the genus
containing that species, etc. Table 2 gives average coincidence values for E. coli, C. botulinum, and nine other
groups of organisms at the genus and species level. Based

on these results, it is clear that different groups of organisms will have varying degrees of spectral overlap at the
various phylogenetic levels. When compared to E. coli, it
is also clear from the larger standard deviations in the
coincidence values for Clostridium species and strains, that
the "Lane-AB" sequence region is likely more variable for
this organism. We therefore performed multiple sequence
alignments of the Lane-AB amplicon for ten organism
groupings from the lineages of the species in Table 2 and
calculated the average positional entropy (or uncertainty;
see Methods) as a measure of the variability within the
various groups of organisms. Figure 2 shows the average
value of the mass-spectral coincidence versus the average
positional entropy measured in the alignments. Following multiple sequence alignment, positional entropies
were calculated as described within BioEdit [39,40] using
default parameters. Briefly, the entropy calculation as
implemented in BioEdit gives a measure of uncertainty at
each position relative to other positions and is calculated
as H(l) = -∑f(b, l)ln(f(b, l)) where f(b, l) is the frequency
at which residue b is found at position l. The entropies at
each position in the alignment were then averaged for various organism groupings as a single measure of the variability of the sequence. As indicated by comparison of
Figures 1 and 2, the degree of coincidence or spectral overlap of base-specific fragmentation patterns correlates better with underlying sequence variability than the
somewhat more arbitrary (or at least lower resolution)
groupings or taxonomic names.

Generation of trees based on separate analysis of the
"Lane-AB" or "Lane-BC" RNase T1 mass catalogs
Based on the initial results above and the desire to create
a "universal" bacterial assay, we decided to limit further
analysis to fragment masses derived from only the "LaneAB" or "Lane-BC" amplicons. In a previous study, we
found fragment masses generated by RNase A to be less
distinguishing than those generated by RNase T1 (as one
might suspect due to less cleavage specificity) [31]. We
therefore maintained separate catalogs of G-specific fragment masses (as would be generated by RNase T1) for the
Lane-AB and Lane-BC amplicons and inter-compared
them using our coincidence function. Figure 3 shows a
neighbor-joining tree of all explicitly named NIAID Category A, B, or C bacterial pathogens as resolved by RNase
T1 fragmentation of a virtual transcript from the Lane-AB
amplicon and spectral distances derived by our coincidence function. Figure 3 indicates that all of the Category
ABC pathogens listed are resolved from each other at the
genus level by an RNase T1 mass spectrum of the Lane-AB
sequence region of 16S rRNA. Of course many of the near
phylogenetic neighbors to these pathogens were not
included in the analysis shown in Figure 3, so further
analysis of each of the presented clusters including nearneighbors is warranted.

Figure 4 shows the corresponding neighbor-joining tree of
the same pathogens and coincidence analysis of RNase T1
fragmentation of the Lane-BC amplicon. Note that while
in Figure 3, Salmonella enterica was poorly resolved from
S. typhi and S. typhimurium, fragmentation of the Lane-BC
sequence separates S. enterica from the other two species.
Likewise, analysis of the Lane-BC region improves resolu-

tion between Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus as
well as between Yersinia pestis and Y. entericolitica. On the
other hand, Brucella and Burkholderia species are better
separated by the Lane-AB sequence region.
To investigate more closely the extent to which the Category ABC pathogens might be resolved from their innocuous relatives using just a single base-specific cleavage
reaction, we used the methods described above to analyze
entire genera including pathogens of interest and their
close relatives. Figure 5 illustrates that 20 V. cholerae
strains can be distinguished based on an observable LaneAB RNase T1 fragmentation pattern in the context of 457
other "universally" amplifiable Vibrio strains. For clarity,
only V. choleraestrains are labeled by strain name in Figure
5. As can be seen, none of the 20 V. cholerae strains examined were found in branches containing any of the other
457 Vibrio species or strains under consideration. Figure 6
depicts a similar analysis of genus Clostridium in which
three pathogens of interest in this genus are labeled: C.
botulinum, C. difficile, and C. perfringens. Figure 6 shows

the "Lane-AB/RNase T1" mass fragment tree and the distribution of the three pathogens of interest. While C. difficile,
and C. perfringens cluster nicely relative to other strains, C.
botulinum is distributed throughout the tree indicating
that base-specific mass fragment analysis of the Lane-AB
amplicon may be ineffective in discriminating this organism from other Clostridia.

Discussion
Occurrence of universal primers
Since we did not account for sequences which may have
contained one or more indeterminate bases within the
primer substring, it is likely that the published primer
sequences occur in more strains than reported here. For
the purposes of a broad bacterial identification platform,
in practice, the primers will likely be employed under conditions of "permissive" PCR in which up to several mismatches will still result in a product, extending the
organism coverage of a primer pair by reduced stringency.
In any event, many other universally conserved sequences
have been proposed for phylogenetic positioning of bac-

teria [41] and the methods described here are certainly
amenable to various primer pairs. Indeed, for some applications it may be best to design custom primer pairs to
achieve the best possible resolution between target species.
Over-represented organisms
To some extent the standard deviations in coincidence (as
well as the averages themselves) presented in Figures 1
and 2 may be affected by the prevalence of certain "popular" strains or species in the RDP such as E. coli (represented by 80 accessions of length 1200 nt or longer).
Conversely, just as sequence-variability may be over-estimated due to a shortage of information on a particular
genus, so might the variation in mass-spectral coincidence. Although the coincidences at the genus-level for
Campylobacter and Clostridium stand out as lower than the
rest (see Table 2) no attempt was made to normalize the
presented coincidences by the number of times a species
was used in a calculation. Finally, the lower values of coincidence for the C.botulinum lineage, even at the specieslevel, helps to explain the difficulty in distinguishing that
organism from its near-neighbors.

Masses employed and isotopic distribution
Determination of RNA compositions is challenging
because of the small mass difference between U and C.
(The repeating G, A, U, and C monomer masses for RNA
are respectively: 345.2, 329.2, 306.2, and 305.2 with pair
wise differences 16, 39, 40, 23, 24, and 1 Da). In preliminary experimental work, we have routinely incorporated
amino-allyl uridine residues as a 100% substitute for natural U in RNA transcripts thereby increasing the 1 Da difference between U and C to 55 Da. Under 100% aminoallyl U (aaU) modification all the fragments are separated
by at least ~8 Da. This 8 Da difference is not attributable
to a single monomer difference in composition but rather
occurs when a C and one aaU residue in one fragment are
replaced by two As in a second fragment of otherwise
identical composition, e.g. fragment 1, AAUUCG =
2048.4 Da, and fragment 2, CUUUCG = 2056.4 Da. Thus,
incorporation of amino-allyl uridine will provide a significant increase in the resolving power of the mass spectrometric approach.

Those familiar with mass spectrometry of large biomolecules will also appreciate that isotopic distribution of the
molecular masses to be measured is an important consid-

Neighbor-joining tree of all explicitly named NIAID Category A, B, or C bacterial pathogens as resolved by
base-specific fragmentation of the "Lane-AB" amplicon and spectral distances derived from the presented
"coincidence function". Separation of some of the unresolved clusters may be improved by further mass spectrometric
analysis of the "Lane-BC" sequence region as illustrated in Figure 4.

Neighbor-joining tree of all explicitly named Category ABC bacterial pathogens as resolved by base-specific
fragmentation of the Lane-BC sequence region and the presented "coincidence function". Comparison to Figure
3 indicates improved resolution of certain taxa while Lane-AB mass fragments are more appropriate for separation of Brucella
and Burkholderia, for example.

Demonstration of successful clustering of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae among 477 members of the genus Vibrio by mass specDemonstration of successful clustering of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae among 477 members of the genus Vibrio
by mass spectrometric observables. The presented Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree is based on mass-spectral coincidence analysis of the Lane-AB 16S rDNA sequence region of the genus Vibrio. Only the names of 20 strains of the pathogen V.cholerae are
displayed out of 477 amplifiable Vibrio species or strains were used for generation of the NJ tree. The mass spectrometric
observable distances from near-neighbors presented may be used to determine the limit of discrimination for a given pathogen
and base-specific cleavage reaction.

discussions of these issues [31,42]. Experimentally, we
have found that isotopic distributions do not prevent
accurate organism identification, and use of average
masses gives very acceptable results. Finally, automated
spectral processing algorithms for "centroiding" vastly
reduce the complexity of observed spectra by placing an
idealized peak with a peak-width of zero at the center-ofmass of each major peak in the spectrum. We have therefore used average monomer masses in calculating all fragment masses, and amino-allyl U in place of natural U.
While the spectral coincidence values calculated here
would be the same regardless of the mass used for U,
experimentally, as discussed above, the use of amino-allyl
U in place of natural U facilitates resolution of fragments

with only a single U/C difference in composition (and
their underlying isotopic distributions).
In all cases, we assumed the RNase T1 digests to be complete. That is, no fragments containing an internal G-residue remained. In practice, significant incomplete
digestion due to secondary structure of RNA would be
readily recognizable because there would be many more
large fragments than expected. Such incomplete digestion
was never a problem in the original rRNA digest cataloging studies [21-25] and heavy masses that would be
symptomatic of incomplete digestion have not been
encountered in our experimental studies.
Although approximately 1% of bases in the naturally
occurring 16S rRNA are known to be post-transcription-

ally modified and therefore have unexpected masses, the
possible presence of such modified nucleotides was not
considered here, for several reasons. First, it is known that
very few modifications occur in the larger RNase fragments (length 9 or more) [43]. Second, the fragments that
contain the modifications and the modification itself are
typically highly conserved, and it would therefore be
straightforward to identify them and make the needed
mass adjustment. Finally, because in vitro transcription is
likely to be used to generate sufficient 16S rRNA to meet
the sensitivity limits of contemporary MALDI instruments, the actual samples will not contain the biological
modifications.
Using these methods then, we feel the trees presented are
reasonable representations of the theoretical limit of resolution of the method when all expected masses are
observed and no unexpected masses are observed, and the
nearest two masses in any observed spectrum are well
resolved.
Use of coincidence function with real spectra
The above discussion points out perhaps the most useful
aspect of the coincidence function and trees presented
here. The inner-product-based metric can be used to compare peak lists from real spectra to large predicted databases of fragments (and we have now routinely used this
to rapidly identify bacteria in less than 40 minutes beyond
the initial PCR step). Von Wintzingerode et al. described
comparison of base-specific fragmentation patterns
derived from Bordetella species against the patterns predicted by virtual fragmentation of 50 published 16S rDNA
sequences, including 13 sequences which were known to
be closely related [27]. Discriminating masses (those nondegenerate between the strains under consideration) were
compared and strains were typed by inspection. Lefmann,
et al. used similar methods to rank the identification of
mycobacteria [30]. Using the coincidence function
described herein with the following tolerance parameter

⎧ 1 | k |≤ tol
δ (k) = ⎨
⎩ 0 otherwise

( 2b )

we have successfully identified bacteria in the laboratory
by comparison of acquired fragment patterns to mass catalogs corresponding to over 47,000 rDNA sequences in a
rapid, automated, and quantitative fashion. In practice,
for mass calibration, an internal fragment common to all
reactions is generated from the reverse compliment of the
antisense primer. (This mass also serves as a confirmation
that the RNA transcription was full-length). In general,
such a single point calibration results in sufficient mass
accuracy that when the tol parameter is set to 1.0 Da or
less, correct organism identification is still obtained.

By repeated acquisition of spectra from known model
organisms, it should be possible to relate the fidelity of
real spectra (that is the number of expected and unexpected peaks observed) to the branch lengths calculated
by distance-based clustering methods such as neighborjoining. Low fidelity spectra will obviously limit organism-resolution, and branches beyond a certain threshold
distance would effectively be collapsed. Finally, the results
of such cluster analyses should help us to develop faster
reporting of organism identification when comparing
observed spectra to predicted mass catalogs. Comparison
of observed mass spectra to subsamples of mass catalogs
from smaller, mass-based organism clusters of the database
will speed our identification routines.

Conclusion
Cluster analysis based on mass spectrometric observables
is an extremely useful tool for examining the extent to
which specificity is preserved in rapid, mass-based assays
in comparison with results obtained using complete
sequences. The analysis also facilitates evaluation of the
relative utility of alternative choices of the region to be
amplified. In contrast to, for example, pair wise lists of
organisms which have matching or closely matching mass
spectra, the trees presented here provide a quick means for
visually assessing the resolution achieved using a particular sequence region and cleavage after a particular base.
These trees indicate that complete cleavage after just one
base using primer pairs that produce 20–30 informative
fragments should provide at least genus-level resolution
for most bacteria. This resolution can be readily improved
by analysis of a second 16S rRNA sequence region, transcription and fragmentation of the antisense strand, and/
or cleavage after an alternative base. (A number of methods have been described for generating RNA transcripts
which are mass-modified and RNA may be cleaved monospecifically after bases other than G [26,28,44]). For the
purposes of developing a broad-based "sentinel" bacterial
assay, this level of resolution may be acceptable, especially if a result is provided rapidly. In situations, for
example, in which an enriched unknown substance is presented, whether the rapid analysis indicates Bacillus
anthracis, B. cereus, or several other near phylogenetic
neighbors may be irrelevant to the near-term prophylactic
steps to be taken if an assay is sufficiently rapid. In the case
of clinical diagnostics and response, many antibiotics
have broad organism activity, so a rapid, genus-level diagnostic test will often be of higher resolution than actually
needed. Finally, the results of such cluster analyses should
help us to develop faster reporting of organism identification by serving as a template for database segmentation
when comparing observed spectra to large numbers of
predicted mass catalogs.

Methods
All 16S rDNA sequences used in this study were downloaded in FASTA format from the Ribosomal Database
Project, release 9.32. All downloaded sequences were
1200 nt or longer with all alignment gaps removed. For
many initial sequence manipulations of FASTA files, the
freely available program BioEdit was used [45]. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using the CLUSTALW algorithm [46] within BioEdit using the default gap
opening and gap extension penalties. The number of pair
wise distances for n organisms is n(n-1)/2. For groups
containing large numbers of organisms, such as the phylum Firmicutes, with over 20,000 sequences in the RDP,
this would lead to over 200 million pair wise distances.
Average coincidences were therefore calculated by taking
random samples of 200 sequences. For many other
groups of sequences, such as the explicitly named Category A, B, or C pathogens, only several hundred sequences
were typically involved. In these cases, the entire sequence
set was used for coincidence analysis or tree generation.
For the generation of Figure 2, following multiple
sequence alignments, positional entropies were calculated
as described within BioEdit [39,40] using default parameters. Briefly, entropy in BioEdit gives a measure of uncertainty at each position relative to other positions and is
calculated as H(l) = -∑f(b, l)ln(f(b, l)) where f(b, l) is the
frequency at which residue b is found at position l. The
resulting entropy values at each position in the alignment
of a particular phylogenetic grouping of sequences were
then averaged as a single measure of the variability of the
sequence region in the group.
The freely available program, Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis or "MEGA" v3.1 [38] was used to generate all neighbor-joining (NJ) trees presented. NJ trees were
generated using the default parameters and the MEGA 3.1
implementation of the NJ algorithm [32,47].
A suite of custom Linux shell scripts, C programs, and
Matlab/Octave functions were written under Linux 2.2.13
and used to create and analyze mass fragment databases.
Complete or partial unaligned sequences were downloaded in FASTA format and split into separate files with
unique identifier tags which were cross referenced in an
index. Each sequence file consisted of a single string composed of A's, G's, C's, and/or T's and was searched for the
existence of two (forward and reverse) primer strings. For
sequences which contained both strings, new strings representing the inter-primer regions (including the primer
sequences themselves) were placed along with the relative
position of the first primer into separate files which were
also cataloged by the unique identifiers. Next, these
"amplicons" were subject to base-specific cleavage after
every G residue, and the resulting sequence fragments
were used to compute a list of masses corresponding to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/321

those fragments. Finally, based on previous determination of the minimum informative length for a given fragment [31], the mass lists were "high-pass" filtered for
fragments which were 6-mers or longer, and the resultant
lists were cataloged in separate files using their unique
identifier tags.
In order to perform quantitative "distance" analysis based
on mass-fragment spectra, the mass lists generated above
were concatenated into a single file whose first column
contained integers representing the origin of the masses
and whose second column contained the corresponding
lists of masses. Octave (version 2.0.17) could then be used
to read this file and generate the square matrix representing the coincidence (using an implementation of the coincidence function introduced previously) between each
pair of mass spectra in the file. The resulting matrix was
manipulated into a vector which contained the corresponding distances (distance ≡ 1 – coincidence) and
which conformed to the structure required for the MEGA
3.1 input file. Additional Linux shell scripts then created a
MEGA-compatible file by generating the appropriate
header information, relating the unique identifiers back
to organism names, and attaching the distance output list.
From start to finish, the entire process can be accomplished automatically by specifying the name of a FASTA
formatted file containing sequence data, the desired forward and reverse primers for amplification, and the
desired nucleotide(s) for cleavage. The amplification
process includes the ability to accommodate arbitrary
degrees of primer degeneracy (for example by specifying
an 'N' in one of the primer strings), and the mass calculation can be tailored to include mass modified nucleotides,
for example, aminoallyl-U for uridine. For an input file
containing 220 bacterial 16S sequences (~2,000 bp each),
the entire process took just under 3 minutes on an older 1
GHz AMD Athlon (32-bit) personal computer with 512
MB of RAM. The same analysis of 403 complete viral
genomes (~10,000 bp each) took approximately 6 minutes.
