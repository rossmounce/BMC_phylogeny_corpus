Moult cycle specific differential gene expression
profiling of the crab Portunus pelagicus

Abstract
Background: Crustacean moulting is a complex process involving many regulatory pathways. A holistic approach
to examine differential gene expression profiles of transcripts relevant to the moulting process, across all moult
cycle stages, was used in this study. Custom cDNA microarrays were constructed for Portunus pelagicus. The
printed arrays contained 5000 transcripts derived from both the whole organism, and from individual organs such
as the brain, eyestalk, mandibular organ and Y-organ from all moult cycle stages.
Results: A total of 556 clones were sequenced from the cDNA libraries used to construct the arrays. These cDNAs
represented 175 singletons and 62 contigs, resulting in 237 unique putative genes. The gene sequences were
classified into the following biological functions: cuticular proteins associated with arthropod exoskeletons,
farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FaMeT), proteins belonging to the hemocyanin gene family, lectins, proteins
relevant to lipid metabolism, mitochondrial proteins, muscle related proteins, phenoloxidase activators and
ribosomal proteins. Moult cycle-related differential expression patterns were observed for many transcripts. Of
particular interest were those relating to the formation and hardening of the exoskeleton, and genes associated
with cell respiration and energy metabolism.
Conclusions: The expression data presented here provide a chronological depiction of the molecular events
associated with the biological changes that occur during the crustacean moult cycle. Tracing the temporal
expression patterns of a large variety of transcripts involved in the moult cycle of P. pelagicus can provide a greater
understanding of gene function, interaction, and regulation of both known and new genes with respect to the
moulting process.

Background
Moulting is a cyclic process that occurs in all arthropods, from insects to crustaceans, and is essential for
growth, reproduction and metamorphosis. The crustacean moult cycle encompasses the period between two
successive moults and has been subdivided into 4 major
stages; intermoult, pre-moult, ecdysis, and post-moult
[1]. The intermoult period is the longest stage of the
moult cycle, during which muscle regeneration and the
accumulation of energy reserves such as glycogen and
lipids occurs [2]. Pre-moult sees the atrophy of somatic
muscle, the resorption of the old exoskeleton, and the
formation of a new exoskeleton in preparation for the
onset of ecdysis [2]. Ecdysis, or the moult itself, involves

the shedding of the exoskeleton through a rapid uptake
of water from the environment, causing the exoskeleton
to rupture [2,3]. Further water uptake occurs during
post-moult facilitating the expansion of the new, still
soft, exoskeleton; this expansion is essential for the
growth of the animal. Exoskeletal hardening, via sclerotization and mineralisation, then takes place [4-6].
Moulting is regulated by an elaborate interplay of
hormones, including those which promote, and those
which negatively regulate moulting. Among the hormones involved in the induction of moulting are two
families of nonpeptidergic hormones: the steroids
(ecdysteroids), and the sesquiterpenoids (represented
mainly by insect juvenile hormone (JH) and crustacean
methyl farnesoate (MF)) [7,8]. Ecdysteroids initiate and
coordinate each moult, and are synthesised and secreted
by the Y-organs [2]. MF is synthesised by the mandibular organs, and has been implicated in the regulation of

crustacean morphogenesis [9,10], metamorphosis [11],
reproduction [12-15] and moulting [16]. MF has been
shown to directly stimulate the secretion of ecdysteroids
in Cancer magister Y-organs [16,17]. Additionally, the
duration of premoult was significantly reduced in the
prawn Penaeus setiferus that had been implanted with
mandibular organs from C. magister [18].
The negative regulatory centre in crustaceans is the
sinus gland/X-organ complex, a neurohaemal organ
located in the eyestalk [19-22]. The sinus gland/X-organ
complex is responsible for the synthesis and storage of a
number of inhibitory neuroendocrine hormones, including the moult-inhibiting hormone (MIH), mandibularorgan inhibiting hormone (MOIH) and crustacean
hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) [22]. The MIH of crustaceans continually inhibits ecdysteroid secretion by the
Y-organs whereby synthesis of ecdysteroids and subsequent moulting occur only after MIH secretion ceases
[21]. CHH, however, plays a multifunctional role as it is
central to carbohydrate metabolism, is involved in moult
regulation, reproduction, and osmoregulatory function
[23-25]. It has been shown to inhibit ecdysteroid synthesis within the Y-organs of Carcinus maenas (although
not as effectively as MIH) [26]. Furthermore, a synergistic action of suppression of ecdysteroid synthesis in the
Y-organ has also been observed to occur when MIH
and CHH are incubated together [27]. CHH receptors
have been found on Y-organ cells [28], suggesting a
physiologically relevant role for CHH in the regulation
of ecdysteroid synthesis. CHH has also been shown to
influence the iso-osmotic uptake of water during ecdysis, which facilitates body expansion enabling somatic
growth [3,25]. Regulation of MF synthesis is negatively
controlled by MOIH [29,30], and is thought to occur, in
part, through the inhibition of the enzyme farnesoic
acid O-methyltransferase (FaMeT) that catalyses the
final step in the MF biosynthetic pathway [31]. Eyestalk
ablation has traditionally been used to induce moulting.
This results in a reduction of circulating MIH and
therefore promotes the production of ecdysteroids.
However, while eyestalk ablation can be effective at
inducing moulting, it also leads to lethal ecdysis in some
species [32].
Moulting is a complex process that is affected by a
range of external and internal factors including temperature, photoperiod, nutritional state and eyestalk integrity. In order to explore the molecular events associated
with the moulting process, microarray technology has
been implemented to investigate differential gene
expression in Portunus pelagicus at various stages of the
moult cycle. Microarray technology offers the potential
to examine the expression patterns of many genes
simultaneously, thus gaining a more comprehensive
understanding of gene function, interaction, and

regulation. This has enabled both the assessment of
expression profiles of known genes, and the discovery of
new genes that play a role in the moult cycle of crustaceans. P. pelagicus (commonly known as the blue swimmer crab) was used as a model species to study
moulting as its life cycle has been closed at the Bribie
Island Research Centre (BIRC), eliminating the need for
wild caught animals.

Results
Overview of P. pelagicus EST sequence distribution

A total of 556 clones were sequenced from the cDNA
libraries used to construct the P. pelagicus cDNA
arrays. Prior to array printing, 160 of these were
sequenced in order to determine the quality of each
cDNA library. Factors such as sequence length and
redundancy were considered in the assessment. A 30%
redundancy of 16 S rRNA was determined in the initial
sequencing stage. The proportion of 16 S rRNA was
greatly reduced (from 30% to 3%) by screening the
libraries prior to printing the arrays, demonstrating the
successful removal of 16 S rRNA from the original
cDNA libraries. The majority of the sequencing however, was carried out subsequent to microarray analysis
to identify genes that demonstrated differential expression profiles across the moult cycle. 396 clones were
randomly selected from a list that displayed differential
expression (P ≤ 0.05) patterns between moult stages.
This approach enabled the identification of genes likely
to be involved in, and important for, crustacean moulting. The 556 cDNAs were assembled in Sequencher
based on sequence similarity; this resulted in 175 singletons and 62 contigs, representing 237 unique putative genes. Sequence annotation was via BLASTn,
BLASTx and Pfam domain analysis. The expressed
gene sequences were grouped according to the following biological functions: cuticular proteins associated
with arthropod exoskeletons, FaMeT, proteins belonging to the hemocyanin gene family (cryptocyanin,
hemocyanin and metallothionein), lectins (C-type lectin receptor, mannose-binding protein, glycoproteins,
mucin and a proline rich protein), proteins relevant to
lipid metabolism (fatty acid binding protein and diazepam binding inhibitor), mitochondrial proteins (ATP
synthase, cytochrome oxidases and NADH dehydrogenase), muscle related proteins (actin, myosin, and
thymosin), phenoloxidase (PO) activators (serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, antimicrobial
and clotting proteins), ribosomal proteins (including
translation and elongation factors), and other
sequences that did not fall into these groups. Unannotated transcripts, were so termed, because they displayed no significant sequence similarity with
sequences deposited in the NCBI database and were

Kuballa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:147

therefore not able to be annotated by BLAST analysis.
The percentage distribution of the 556 sequenced
cDNAs is depicted in Figure 1.
The largest group of transcripts depicted here (31%)
represents cDNAs that could not be annotated via the
GenBank database. Transcripts encoding mitochondrial
proteins such ATP synthase, cytochrome oxidases and
NADH dehydrogenase make up 24% of the total cDNAs
isolated in this study. Cuticular protein transcripts constitute 14%, while transcripts of the hemocyanin gene
family and those related to muscle function and development comprise 6% each, of the total cDNA population. Phenoloxidase (PO) activators such as serine
proteases, antimicrobial and clotting protein transcripts
contribute to 5% of all sequenced cDNAs. Other transcripts encoding diverse proteins not classified into the
other groups include ovary development-related protein,
opsin, ferritin, heat shock protein, tubulin, notch protein, arginine and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, and
transcripts that contained CT, GT or AC repeats, represent 5% of the total population. Lectins, such as the
C-type lectin receptor and mannose-binding protein, as

Page 3 of 18

well as ribosomal proteins, each contributed to 3% of all
sequenced cDNAs. Fatty acid binding protein and diazepam binding inhibitor transcripts, that are associated
with lipid metabolism, constitute 2% of the overall transcript population, while FaMeT transcripts represent the
smallest group that form 1% of all cDNAs sequenced
within the scope of this microarray study.
Gene expression profiles across the moult cycle of P.
pelagicus

Moult stage-specific differential gene expression analysis
was carried out on P. pelagicus crabs from the following
moult stages: post-moult, intermoult, early pre-moult,
late pre-moult and ecdysis, using custom prepared
P. pelagicus cDNA microarray slides. A loop design, in
which consecutive moult stages were compared via dual
channel microarray hybridisations, was employed for the
analysis (Figure 2). This format enabled the generation
of a time series plot of differentially expressed genes
across the moult cycle.
Analysis with GeneSpring using K-means clustering
revealed seven main subsets of transcripts that displayed

differential expression profiles across the moult cycle of
P. pelagicus. They were grouped into clusters labelled
A-G according to their expression patterns. Not all of
the 556 clones selected for sequencing fell into these
clusters and many of the transcripts associated with
these clusters were not sequenced.
The transcripts assigned to Cluster A are relatively
down-regulated at the time of moulting, expression subsequently increases at each consecutive stage, peaking in
early pre-moult then plateauing or declining slightly in
late pre-moult in preparation for ecdysis. In this subset,
four clusters (A1-A4) were deemed to have similar
expression profiles and hence collectively termed Cluster
A; this group is shown in Figure 3. Table 1 describes the
composition of Cluster A, referring to each individual
cluster respectively (A1-4). The largest proportion (46%)
of sequenced transcripts in Cluster A are of mitochondrial origin, 15% are metallothionein, 10% actin, 9%
myosin, 8% opsin, 4% ferritin, while ribosomal RNA and
elongation factor make up 2.5% each, hemocyanin, chitinase and a CT repeat sequence contribute to 1% of the
transcripts sequenced from Cluster A.
Cluster B consists of transcripts which are down-regulated in the moult and post-moult stages, expression
then increases dramatically in intermoult, remains high
in early pre-moult and begins to decline in late premoult. This group is depicted in Figure 3 where three
clusters (B1-B3) were deemed to have similar expression

profiles and hence collectively termed Cluster B. Table 2
describes the composition of Cluster B; each subset of
Cluster B is referred to individually. Hemocyanin makes
up 33% of the sequenced transcript population, cryptocyanin 23%, trypsin 15%, cathepsin 6%, chymotrypsin
5%, carcinin 3%, while fatty acid binding protein, dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, fumarase and arginine kinase
each make up 2%. Additionally 6% of the sequenced
transcripts remain unable to be annotated.
Cluster C is a relatively small group of transcripts (ten
in total), in which expression is down-regulated in the
moult and post-moult stages, increases substantially in
intermoult, then drops dramatically in early and late
pre-moult (Figure 3). Of the sequenced transcripts from
Cluster C, three are cuticle proteins (see Table 3 for
sequence IDs).
The transcript profile that is represented in Cluster D
displays expression that peaks in the post-moult stage,
decreases dramatically in the intermoult and early premoult stages, then begins to increase again in late premoult and ecdysis. Figure 3 depicts the four K-means
clustering maps that collectively make up Cluster D,
while Table 4 describes transcript identity and number.
The sequenced transcripts from Cluster D consist of
58% cuticle proteins, gastrolith protein and vermiform
cuticle protein each constitute 2%, while 38% were
unable to be annotated.
The group of transcripts represented in Cluster E display expression profiles which are relatively low during
the moult, post-moult and intermoult stages, then
increase in the early pre-moult stage and remain high in
late pre-moult. This group is depicted in Figure 3 where
two clusters (E1 & E2) were deemed to have similar
expression profiles and hence collectively termed Cluster
E. Table 5 describes the composition of Clusters E1 and
E2. In this cluster 31% of sequenced transcripts are fatty
acid binding proteins, carcinin and C-type lectin receptor each make up 25%, 13% are vermiform cuticle proteins and 6% of the sequenced transcript population is
clotting protein.
Cluster F is depicted in Figure 3 and features transcripts whose expression is highest in the moult and
post-moult stages, decreases substantially in the intermoult and early pre-moult stages then begins to
increase again in late pre-moult in preparation for ecdysis. Table 6 provides a description of the identity and
number of the total transcript population for Cluster F.
A high proportion of the sequenced cDNAs (38%) are
mannose-binding proteins, 23% are cuticle proteins, 8%
represent myosin, while 31% remain unannotated.
The expression profiles of the transcripts comprising
Cluster G show relatively low expression levels in the
moult stage, an increase to peak levels in the post-moult
and intermoult stages, then a dramatic decrease in the

individual organs such as the brain, eyestalk, MO and Yorgan from all moult cycle stages, was developed for this
study. By comparing the expression patterns of transcripts from each moult cycle stage it was possible to
identify genes with potential involvement in various
aspects of the moulting process.
Genisphere’s 3DNA dendrimer labeling technology,
which overcomes some difficulties associated with direct
or indirect labelling methods, was used in this study.
This technology allows the labelling of cDNA via a target capture sequence oligonucleotide rather than incorporating the fluorescent dye directly during cDNA
preparation, thus avoiding inefficient synthesis and
hybridization of the cDNA to the array that results from
the incorporation of fluorescent dye nucleotide conjugates into the reverse transcript. Additionally, the signal
generated from each message will be independent of
base composition or length of the transcript (Genisphere
3DNA Array 900MPX protocol).

The sequencing of 556 clones from two libraries
(whole crab and crab organ) generated from P. pelagicus, revealed that a significant portion of these cDNAs
(31%) could not be annotated via the GenBank database
(Figure 1). However, these transcripts may nevertheless
represent genes with a significant role in the process of
moulting in crustaceans, as they were isolated within
the scope of the moult cycle-related differential gene
expression analysis study.
Cellular energy requirements across the moult cycle

Transcripts representing mitochondrial proteins, such as
ATP synthase, cytochrome oxidase, and NADH dehydrogenase form the second largest group (24%) of
cDNAs isolated during this microarray study (Figure 1).
Such proteins are required for cellular energy homeostasis as they are a part of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain [33]. NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome c
oxidase are two of the three energy-transducing

Mitochondrial (including ATP synthase, cytochrome

(Figure 3 Table 1) which display an expression profile of
relatively low expression during ecdysis then a gradual
increase across the rest of the moult cycle generally
peaking in early pre-moult then decreasing slightly in
late pre-moult. The expression profile of these transcripts appears to reflect an increase in the energy
requirements of the animal as the moult cycle progresses. Lower levels of mitochondrial gene expression
at ecdysis suggests reduced energy requirements during
moulting, with a recovery in metabolic activity

appearing in the post-moult stage and returning to normal during interphase, reflected in the increase in mitochondrial gene expression observed in Cluster A.
Interestingly, studies into the ecdysteroid responsive
genes of Cherax quadricarinatus revealed that moult
induction through endocrine manipulation resulted in
differential expression of genes predominantly belonging
to a group known to be involved in metabolic functions
such as digestive enzymes, carbohydrate metabolism and
mitochondrial respiration [34]. These transcripts however, were down-regulated in pre-moult when compared
to control animals in intermoult, possibly indicating that
moult induction creates metabolic stress which may
impact on metabolic function. Hormonal effects of
mitochondrial transcription have also been reported in
mammals; thyroid hormones for example stimulate
mitochondrial activity as well as gene expression [35].
Moulting in crustaceans is under the hormonal control
of ecdysteroids, which in C. sapidus peak in pre-moult
and return to basal levels in the post-moult stage [36].
The results presented here reflect this pattern of hormonal stimulation of mitochondrial transcription, as the
moult cycle progresses in P. pelagicus, genes associated

with energy production including mitochondrial and
ribosomal transcripts, show an increase in expression
levels across consecutive stages of the moult cycle.
A similar expression profile occurs for further transcripts of ATP synthase, arginine kinase and fumerase
(found in Cluster B, Figure 3). These transcripts show
down-regulation in the moult and post-moult stages and
then an increase in expression levels in the intermoult
and pre-moult stages. Phosphagen kinases (which include
arginine kinase and creatine kinase) function in temporal
ATP buffering and in intracellular energy transport [37].
Phosphagen kinases are abundant in muscle, where they

maintain ATP homeostasis during muscle contraction
[38,39], in the gills which function in nitrogen excretion
and gas exchange [40] and in cell migration [41]. Interestingly, arginine kinase is the sole phosphagen kinase
found in arthropods [42]. The enzymatic activity of arginine kinase in C. maenas was found to vary significantly
according to tissue type with the highest levels observed
in the claw muscle [40]. Given the important role that
arginine kinase plays in energy production we postulate
that ATP buffering by arginine kinase may occur temporally as well as spatially in order to meet the fluctuating
metabolic requirements experienced across the moult

energy in the form of NADH in the mitochondria. The
expression profiles observed here for fumarase, suggest
that it could be important in meeting the high energy
demands of growth during the moult cycle.
Cuticular protein expression

Transcripts encoding cuticular proteins represent 14% of
the total cDNAs isolated in this microarray study. Several patterns of moult cycle differential expression were
observed for cuticular proteins, implying that each
group has a specific but varying function depending on
which stage of the moult cycle up-regulation is detected.
For instance a peak in expression during intermoult was
found to occur for cuticle proteins CUT7 and CUT8
(EF101999, EF102000) (Cluster C, Figure 3). This
expression pattern was also identified using an independent data analysis method, where up-regulation was
observed in intermoult when compared to both postmoult and early pre-moult [43], both of these transcripts
code for proteins that contain three cuticle_1 domains.
Proteins with the cuticle_1 domain are associated with
calcified cuticle in decapod crustaceans [44,45]. The specific up-regulation of these cuticle trancripts in the
intermoult phase indicates that formation and/or repair
of the exoskeleton may continue throughout the intermoult phase and that these genes operate separately to
those involved in the formation of new cuticle during
the pre- and post-moult stages. The largest proportion
of cuticle protein transcripts (31%) was found to occur

in Cluster D. The transcripts identified in this group
include P. pelagicus cuticle protein genes BD1
(EF102013), BD2 (EF102014), CUT1 (EF101993), CUT2
(EF101994), CUT3 (EF101995), CUT4 (EF101996),
CUT6 (EF101998), CUT12 (EF102004), CUT13
(EF102005), CB3 (EF102008), P. pelagicus vermiform
cuticle protein VER3-like (EF102020), and C. quadricarinatus gastrolith protein (GAP65) (EU551670). Here we
see an expression profile of up-regulation in the moult
and post-moult stages (peaking in post-moult) then a
sharp decline during intermoult and early pre-moult,
followed by a recovery in the late pre-moult stage.
GAP65 was found to be directly involved in the deposition of amorphous calcium carbonate in the gastroliths
of C. quadricarinatus [46]. Based on the expression profile observed for transcripts VER3 and GAP65 in Cluster
D, a role in the calcification of the crustacean cuticle
seems likely.
A similar pattern is seen in Cluster F which contains
13% cuticle protein transcripts, composed of P. pelagicus
cuticle protein BD2 (EF102014) and CBM (EF102017).
Transcripts with the abbreviation BD, code for proteins
with a PfamB_109992 domain [43] which has yet to be
annotated but has been isolated from the calcified cuticle of other crabs [44]. CUT transcripts, when translated, contain the protein domain cuticle_1, also
associated with calcified cuticle. CB transcripts, on the
other hand, code for proteins with a chitin_bind_4
domain. In addition to its chitin binding function, this
chitin binding domain also occurs in proteins which
have been demonstrated to function in calcification of
the crustacean exoskeleton [47,48]. CMB (chitin binding
Peritrophin-A domain) is another transcript group with
chitin binding abilities, prevalent in insects and involved
in the structural formation of the peritrophic membrane
(gut lining in arthropods) [49]; it has also been found in
penaeid prawns. Despite the differences in domain type,
and hence assumed functional difference, these transcripts follow a synergistic pattern of expression, which
displays up-regulation at ecdysis with a peak in postmoult. The high level of expression in post-moult
together with functional annotation suggest that these
genes are involved in the synthesis and hardening of the
post-moult crustacean cuticle. P. pelagicus cuticle protein CUT7 (EF101999) and CB4 (EF102009), observed
in Cluster G, present with a slightly different profile
where expression is highest in post-moult and intermoult, decreases dramatically in early pre-moult then
begins to increase again in late pre-moult. The incidence
of cuticular protein up-regulation in intermoult, when
compared to early pre-moult (Clusters C and G), is perhaps unexpected because the exoskeleton is considered
to be fully formed by the intermoult stage. This may
indicate a continued synthesis and/or repair of the

exoskeleton well into the intermoult period followed by
a down-regulation of cuticular protein expression in the
pre-moult period, in preparation for the degradation
and eventual shedding of the exoskeleton at ecdysis.
Stillman also reports a peak in transcript levels of certain cuticle protein genes in the middle of the moult
cycle [50].
Additionally, two transcripts that displayed similarity
to a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLa)
domain containing chitin binding protein from Drosophila (termed VER2 & 3) exhibited two different types
of expression profiles, VER2 in Cluster E and VER3 in
cluster D. The opposing expression profiles of Clusters
D and E (transcripts specific to D display transcripts
that show a decrease in expression in early pre-moult
when compared to intermoult, whereas Cluster E shows
expression that is low in intermoult and high in early
pre-moult), together with the specificity of the transcript
type identified in each cluster, suggests different physiological roles and modes of action for VER2 and VER3.
Differential expression of the hemocyanin gene family

Transcripts belonging to the hemocyanin gene family
represented 6% of all sequenced cDNAs (Figure 1);
these include hemocyanin, cryptocyanin and metallothionein. Moult cycle-related differential expression of

hemocyanin and cryptocyanin was evident in Cluster B
where high levels of expression are seen in the intermoult and pre-moult stages. Recent studies examining
global expression patterns of C. magister juveniles also
found differential expression patterns occurring across
developmental stages for both hemocyanin and cryptocycanin [50]. Hemocyanin is an oxygen transport protein that is found in the hemolymph of crustaceans [51].
In addition to its ability to reversibly bind oxygen,
hemocyanin also displays PO activity [52] which is
important to the sclerotization or hardening of the
newly synthesised cuticle [53]. Hemocyanin has been
located in the cuticle of the prawn Penaeus japonicus
during the intermoult and postmoult stages of the
moult cycle. Here the enzymatic activity of cuticular
hemocyanin was higher than that of hemocyanin derived
from the hemolymph [53]. Additionally, ecdysone
(arthropod moulting hormone) has been found to bind
to proteins within the crustacean hepatopancreas and
cuticle [54]. More recent studies on the tarantula,
suggest that this protein may be hemocyanin. The spider
hemocyanin was found to bind both ecdysone and
20-OH-ecdysone, albeit with low affinity which is
thought to be compensated for by its high concentration
[55]. The authors calculated that up to 75% of the
ecdysteroids can be transported by hemocyanin.

Kuballa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:147
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/147

Considering the important role hemocyanin is thought
to play in cuticle formation and ecdysone transport, the
high levels of hemocyanin gene expression observed in
the present study in both the intermoult and pre-moult
periods reflect the dual functionality of hemocyanin in
preparation for arthropod ecdysis.
Cryptocyanin is structurally related to hemocyanin
however it lacks the ability to bind oxygen [56]. Instead
cryptocyanin is involved in protein transport and in the
formation of the new exoskeleton in crustaceans [56,57].
The similarity in gene expression profiles of crytocyanin
and hemocyanin, together with their structural relatedness, suggests a similarity in function with respect to
cuticle synthesis, both through direct incorporation and
the potential transfer of other cuticular components.
Metallothionein on the other hand was up-regulated
gradually across the moult cycle (found in Cluster A,
Figure 3) where expression was lowest at ecdysis and
peaked in early pre-moult. This expression profile was
also observed for transcripts associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism such as ATP synthase,
cytochrome oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase. Metallothionein is a ubiquitous heavy metal-binding protein,
involved in copper homeostasis and detoxification [58].
Studies in C. sapidus have demonstrated the presence of
metallothionein in pre-moult crabs, suggesting that
metallothionein is required for the regulation of biologically available copper ions necessary for the oxygen binding properties of hemocyanin [58]. Crustacean
metallothionein has also been implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism by affecting mitochondrial
respiration. Investigations on H. americanus demonstrated that metallothionein is present in the intermembrane space of hepatopancreatic mitochondria and is able
to regulate the oxygen consumption of mitochondria in a
zinc-dependant manner [59]. The synchronous expression profile of metallothionein and several genes involved
in mitochondrial respiration, observed here in Cluster A,
support the hypothesis of a regulatory role for metallothionein in energy production. Metallothionein was
also found to exert a protective effect against the highly
reactive oxygen species generated by oxygen metabolism
in the presence of zinc [59]. Free zinc in quantities
equivalent to those tested when bound by metallothionein increased the levels of reactive oxygen species by
four fold. Crustaceans have been found to store considerable levels of metals such as calcium, copper and zinc in
the hepatopancreas during the pre-moult stage of the
moult cycle [60]; moreover induction of metallothionein
levels in the hepatopancreas occurs at high zinc concentrations [61]. The accumulation of zinc in the hepatopancreas during pre-moult, together with the role of zinc in
inducing oxidative stress, accentuates the requirement
for protective measures against free radical formation in

Page 11 of 18

this moult cycle stage. The peak of metallothionein
expression in pre-moult lends further support to the
implied role of metallothionein in metal detoxification
and energy metabolism.
Phenoloxidase activity

PO activators such as the serine proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsinogen, in addition to antimicrobial
and clotting proteins, made up 5% of the total distribution of sequenced cDNAs (Figure 1). Trypsin and chymotrypsin both displayed moult cycle related differential
expression in that they were highly up-regulated in
intermoult and pre-moult when compared to ecdysis
and post-moult (Cluster B, Figure 3). Trypsin is one of
the major digestive proteases secreted by the hepatopancreas [62], chymotrypsin also, is a serine protease
recently identified in the digestive systems of crustaceans [63]. Studies on Penaeus vannamei revealed that
mRNA expression of trypsin is at a maximum during
early premoult, then declines sharply in late premoult.
The specific activity of trypsin also followed this pattern,
suggesting the regulation of trypsin biosynthesis is, at
least in part, transcriptional and may be under the influence of ecdysteroid hormones [64]. Further research on
the midgut gland of P. vannamei showed that mRNA
expression of trypsin also differed across the moult cycle
[65]. They found a high level of trypsin expression in
intermoult, a peak in early pre-moult, followed by a
decline in late pre-moult with lowest levels in the postmoult stage; these figures correlate strongly with the
results from this study in P. pelagicus. Sanchez-Paz and
Garcia-Carreno suggested that this expression pattern
may be explained through feeding behaviour during the
moult cycle, as trypsin is a digestive enzyme and feeding
occurs mostly in the intermoult and pre-moult stages.
Interestingly, trypsin and chymotrypsin are the only two
digestive enzymes that were found to be differentially
expressed across the moult cycle in this study, presumably additional digestive enzymes would be up-regulated
if these expression profiles were due solely to feeding
behaviour. Perhaps a further explanation of trypsin and
chymotrypsin activity may be attributed to their roles in
the phenoloxidase (PO) cascade. The PO pathway has
typically been associated with immunity but is also
involved in important structural aspects of the crustacean cuticle such as melanisation and sclerotization
[6,66-68]. The PO cascade requires activation which is
achieved via several mechanisms including C-type lectins, and the proteases trypsin [69,70] and chymotrypsin
[71].
Trypsin and chymotrypsin expression correlates
strongly with hemocyanin expression (Cluster B), and
may be involved in activation of the PO pathway and
the stimulation of hemocyanin into an active

Kuballa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:147
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/147

phenoloxidase-like enzyme, that is associated with melanin synthesis and sclerotization in the newly developing
cuticle in P. pelagicus.
Genes involved in cuticle hardening

Lectins, which include the calcium dependant lectin
group (C-type lectin) receptor, mannose-binding protein, mucin and a proline rich protein, represent 3% of
the cDNAs isolated in this study (Figure 1). C-type lectin receptor transcripts followed the expression pattern
observed in Cluster E, with relatively low levels in
moult, post-moult and intermoult then an increase in
the pre-moult stages (Figure 3). Conversely, the mannose-binding protein (present in Cluster F) was highly
expressed at ecdysis and post-moult.
Glycoproteins, such as the mannose rich variety
found in the calcified cuticle of C. sapidus, have been
found to be associated with the regulation of biomineralisation [72]. Shafer and colleagues describe an alteration in the lectin-binding characteristics of mannose
rich glycoproteins at the time of onset of calcification.
Glycosylated cuticle proteins are thought to act as premoult inhibitors of calcification, deglycosylation of
these proteins occurs specifically after ecdysis likely
initiating the deposition of calcium [72,73]. In this
study both the C-type lectin receptor and the mannose-binding protein display significant moult cyclerelated differential expression. The C-type lectin receptor is up-regulated in the pre-moult stages, coinciding
with the formation of new cuticle, which must remain
uncalcified prior to moulting, while the mannose-binding protein is up-regulated in the moult and postmoult period. The temporally specific, and high levels
of, up-regulation of both of these genes have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of calcification
in the crustacean cuticle [74].
Lectins (carbohydrate binding proteins) are also
involved in immune function through the lectin-complement pathway, in which the mannose-binding lectin
recognises infectious agents and triggers PO activation
[75,76]. PO activity also plays a role in cuticle sclerotization [66] and melanisation [77]. The up-regulation of
mannose-binding protein observed here during periods
of cuticle hardening, coupled with its role in the activation of the PO cascade, suggest that it also participates
in the sclerotization of the crustacean exoskeleton.
Muscle formation

Muscle-related cDNAs such as actin, myosin and thymosin, constituted 6% of all the transcripts isolated during the moult cycle-related microarray experiments
(Figure 1). Differential expression of muscle-related
transcripts was observed across the moult cycle where a
gradual up-regulation of actin and myosin transcripts

Page 12 of 18

was observed between edcysis and the early pre-moult
stage (Cluster A, Figure 3). Actin possesses diverse cellular functions which include the provision of mechanical support in the cytoskeleton, the mechanism for
muscle contraction in muscle cells, and the binding of
ATP in the cytosol [78]. Myosins are a large family of
motor proteins that facilitate actin-based motility, via an
interaction with actin and the hydrolysis of ATP [79].
Muscle mass, particularly in the claws of large decapod
crustaceans, undergoes cyclic atrophy during pre-moult
followed by regeneration during the post-moult and
intermoult periods [2,80]. The up-regulation of actin
and myosin observed from moult through to early premoult is consistent with the observation that muscle
deposition and growth occur mainly in the intermoult
period.
Lipid metabolism

Transcripts encoding the lipid metabolism proteins diazepam-binding inhibitor and fatty acid binding protein
constituted 2% of all sequenced transcripts (Figure 1).
Fatty acid binding protein transcripts were found in
Cluster E, where an up-regulation is observed in
the pre-moult stages when compared to the rest of the
moult cycle. The fluctuation of lipid composition in the
hypodermal membrane of the exoskeleton has been
demonstrated in several crustacean species. Observations in C. pagurus show that the hypodermis increases
in lipid content just before secretion of the new exoskeleton begins in pre-moult [81]. Cuticular lipid levels in
C. sapidus have been shown to increase during premoult and peak dramatically post ecdysis before
returning to intermoult levels [82]. These cuticular
observations reflect the changes detected in the hemocytes of C. maenas which become loaded with lipid
prior to ecdysis. Hemocytes aggregate beneath the hypodermis and apparently transfer the lipid to the newly
forming cuticle [81]. Furthermore, fatty acid binding
proteins have been isolated from the hemocytes of the
crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and the prawn Penaeus
monodon [83]. The moult cycle-related changes to the
expression of fatty acid binding protein, demonstrated
here, may facilitate the deposition of lipids in the cuticle
of crustaceans.

Conclusions
Tracing the temporal expression patterns of genes
involved in the crustacean moult cycle provides a platform for gaining a greater understanding of gene function, interaction, and regulation with respect to the
moulting process. The expression data presented here
provide a chronological depiction of the molecular
events associated with the biological changes occurring
during the crustacean moult cycle.

Kuballa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:147
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/147

Transcripts associated with energy production, such as
mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, increased in expression as the moult cycle progressed. ATP synthase catalyses the synthesis of ATP (the fundamental means of
cell energy production) via a proton gradient [84] generated by cytochrome oxidases and NADH dehydrogenase
which are the proton translocating enzymes of the mitochondria [85]. Arginine kinase and fumerase are also
involved in cell metabolism and energy production,
where arginine kinase plays a role in the maintenance of
ATP levels in cells with fluctuating energy requirements
[37], while fumarase is a catalyst in the Krebs Cycle and
has also been associated with growth and development.
Here we find an increase in these metabolic transcripts
across consecutive stages of the moult cycle with a peak
in pre-moult. This may reflect greater physical and/or
biological activity in the animals in comparison to their
relative sedentary state after moulting occurs, and also
greater metabolic demands due to animal growth and
new cuticle formation.
A number of genes likely to play an important role in
the formation and hardening of the crustacean exoskeleton, such as cuticle proteins, PO activators, lectins, fatty
acid-binding proteins and members of the hemocyanin
family, have been identified by virtue of protein domain
annotation and differential gene expression data. These
genes display expression profiles specific to function
across the moult cycle. Temporal variation in expression
has even been observed between individual cuticular
protein transcripts containing the same protein domains
(such as chitin or calcium binding). This suggests a difference in functionality for each gene, indicating that
transcripts from a similar group may play a distinct and
different role in the formation of the crustacean
exoskeleton.
Glycosylation of cuticular proteins in the crustacean
exoskeleton has been implicated in the regulation of
cuticle calcification [73,86]. The recognition of glycosylation sites by mannose-binding lectins is also involved
in the activation of serine proteases, which in turn activates the PO cascade [76]. Considering the involvement
of POs in the sclerotization of the arthropod cuticle,
and the potential role of mannose binding protein in
the initiation of mineralisation, the specific up-regulation of mannose-binding protein exclusively during
these stages indicates that it plays an important role in
exoskeletal hardening. Additionally, transcripts potentially involved in the deposition of lipids in the newly
forming cuticle of crustaceans, were up-regulated in the
pre-moult stage of P. pelagicus.
A large diversity of genes representing many important biological functions related to moulting in crustaceans were able to annotated, and their expression
profiles mapped across consecutive stages of the moult

cycle of P. pelagicus in a time series manner. This
approach aims to enhance the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and regulating factors involved in the
moult cycle, and allows the identification of target genes
which may control important aspects of various stages
of the moult cycle.

Methods
Animal selection

P. pelagicus crabs were supplied by staff at the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Bribie Island Research Centre (BIRC). The crabs
were individually housed in a flowthrough system at an
ambient water temperature of 24°C, and fed a commercial diet (Ebistar, Higashimaru, Japan) twice daily. Two
size groups of crabs were used, small crabs of an average
carapace width of 4 cm, and larger crabs of an average
carapace width of 11 cm. All crabs were moult staged by
examination of pleopod paddles for epidermal retraction
and grouped into the following moult stages; moult
(shedding of the exoskeleton), post-moult (pliable exoskeleton), intermoult (hard exoskeleton with no evidence
of epidermal retraction) early and late stage pre-moult
(based on the extent of epidermal retraction) [87].
cDNA library construction

Two cDNA libraries were constructed using various
source tissues, selected in order to provide a diverse collection of transcripts, and representing a broad range of
tissue functions and physiological states in all moult
stages. One of the cDNA libraries was synthesised from
whole animals in order to obtain transcripts from each
tissue type. For this library, six small crabs, from each of
the following five moult stages; moult, post-moult, intermoult, early and late pre-moult stages, were selected,
snap frozen and individually ground under liquid nitrogen. The second cDNA library was derived from organs
previously identified as being important to the moult
cycle of crustaceans and served to enrich the array with
sequences particularly relevant to crustacean moulting.
The tissues represented in the P. pelagicus organ library
were brain, eyestalk, mandibular organ (MO) and Yorgan. These tissues were obtained from six anaesthetised large P. pelagicus crabs from each of moult, postmoult, intermoult, and early and late pre-moult stages,
and stored in RNA later (Ambion, Austin, USA).
Total RNA was purified from each sample using TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Concentration and purity of the RNA were determined
using a spectrophotometer (GeneQuant Pro, GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) with 260 and
280 nm readings. RNA quality was assessed for all samples by visualisation on a denaturing formaldehyde RNA

Kuballa et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:147
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/147

gel (protocol recommended by Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) and ethidium bromide staining. Each cDNA
library was constructed by pooling equal amounts of
total RNA from all moult cycle stages.
A commercial cDNA library synthesis system
(SMART cDNA library construction kit, Clonetech,
Mountain View, CA, USA) was used for the construction of each library according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Only the final cloning step was modified so
that instead of using the l TriplEx2 vector supplied
with the kit, the size fractionated cDNA was ligated into
pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, and transformed into
XL10 Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 80
clones, randomly selected from each library, were then
sequenced and analysed using BLAST http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ to determine transcript identity
and redundancy. The primer used for sequencing was
the 5’SMARTlibPCR primer (5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3’) a modification of the SMART IV
oligonucleotide supplied with the SMART cDNA library
construction kit (Clonetech).
Screening for redundant clones

Upon examination of the sequences of 160 clones, from
the cDNA libraries of both whole crab and crab organ,
redundancies for 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcripts were found to be as high as 30%. To remove 16
S rRNA carrying plasmids, all of the clones were first
screened for the 16 S rRNA sequence, using a colony
hybridisation method [88]. Briefly three probes, (500 bp,
344 bp and 300 bp in length) were designed from separate regions of the 16 S rRNA sequence. These probes
were PCR amplified and labelled with 32P, then hybridised to clones that had been fixed to nitrocellulose filters. Following an overnight incubation at 55°C in
hybridisation buffer (6xSSC and 1% SDS), the filters
were washed twice at 55°C in a solution of 6xSSC and
0.2% SDS for 30 min, sealed within plastic and exposed
onto autoradiography films (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) at
-70°C using intensifying screens. The films were then
developed according to supplier’s instructions.
Construction of custom P. pelagicus cDNA microarrays

5000 unsequenced clones, that had been pre-screened for
16 S rRNA, were randomly selected for spotting onto the
microarray slides. 2400 were selected from the whole
crab library and 2600 from the crab organ library. These
were grown overnight in LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The clones were sent to the AgGenomics (Bundoora, Vic, Australia) microarray printing facility. The
clones were PCR amplified using kit-supplied primers

Page 14 of 18

(Clontech) and contact-spotted (in duplicate) using pins,
onto amino silane coated glass slides, in a 50% DMSO
buffer. Known crab genes, that were identified at the
initial sequencing stage, such as actin (GenBank accession EF110528) cryptocyanin (EF102021), hemocyanin
(EF110534), metallothionein (EF110529), opsin
(EF110527) and ubiquitin (EF110526) were spotted onto
the arrays for use as controls. Genes specifically associated with the moulting process such as moult-inhibiting
hormone (MIH) (EF110524), crustacean hyperglycaemic
hormone (CHH) (EF110525) and FaMeT long isoform
(DQ085282) [89], were isolated separately from P. pelagicus through the design of gene specific primers and
spotted on to the arrays. In addition universal reference
RNA standard controls (Lucidea, GE Healthcare UK
Ltd.) were also spotted onto each array, as were negative
control spots of 50% DMSO (without cDNA). The cDNA
was bound to the slide surface by baking and UV
crosslinking.
Experimental Design

In order to identify differential gene expression across
moult stages, two consecutive moult stages were compared on each array in a dual colour (Cy3 and Cy5)
experiment. RNA samples (isolated from individual
crabs) were pooled across subjects in order to reduce
the effect of biological variation. A formula, that dictates
the total number of subjects and arrays required for the
pooled experiment to obtain gene expression estimates
and confidence intervals comparable to those obtained
from a non-pooled experiment [90], gave 90% confidence if nine subjects were pooled across a total of
three arrays. To this effect, equal amounts of total RNA
from three crabs in one moult stage, were pooled, and
compared against equal amounts of total RNA pooled
from three crabs in another moult stage, on one array.
This was repeated three times in total, the different
moult stages were labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 respectively.
Consecutive moult stages were compared in the following format; post-moult (Cy3) with intermoult (Cy5),
intermoult (Cy3) with early pre-moult (Cy5), early premoult (Cy3) with late pre-moult (Cy5), late pre-moult
(Cy3) with ecdysis (Cy5), and ecdysis (Cy3) with postmoult (Cy5). Figure 2 is a schematic diagram depicting
each set of moult stage comparisons.
Spatial variation within each array was addressed
through spot duplication. Two identical blocks of grids
consisting of each amplified cDNA and including the
controls described above were printed onto the left and
right sides of each horizontally orientated array, thus
affording spatial separation between duplicate spots, to
allow for the normalisation of potential hybridisation
anomalies.

Microarray Hybridisations

Nine small crabs (six of these were also used in the
above described whole crab cDNA library construction)
were snap frozen, individually ground under liquid
nitrogen and RNA was isolated from each ground crab
using TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The RNA was
DNase treated using RQ1 RNase free DNase (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as recommended
by the manufacturer. RNA quality was assessed by
visualisation on a denaturing formaldehyde RNA gel
(protocol recommended by Qiagen) using ethidium bromide staining. Concentration and purity of the RNA
were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260
nm and 280 nm using a spectrophotometer (GeneQuant
Pro). One microgram of Lucidea universal RNA control
(GE Healthcare) was added to 10 μg of pooled total
RNA for each moult stage sample, the RNA was converted to cDNA then labelled and hybridised to the
array using the 3DNA Array 900 MPX expression array
detection kit (Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, RNA
was reverse transcribed using a random primer combined with an oligo dT primer. The RNA was then
degraded and the cDNA tailed with dTTP followed by
ligation to a dendrimer-specific capture oligo (specific
for either Cy3 or Cy5). Microarray slides were denatured
prior to use by immersion in 95°C MilliQ water for 5
min, the slides were then transferred to 95% ethanol at
room temperature for 2 min. Slides were spun dry to
reduce streaking at 800 RPM for 2 min. The Cy3 and
Cy5 “tagged” cDNAs were combined and then hybridised to the array by overnight incubation in a humidity
chamber at 65°C using the kit supplied non-formamide
SDS-based buffer and a poly T based blocker, according
to the manufacturer’s specifications. The “tagged” cDNA
was washed with a series of three SSC-based buffers, the
first wash occurred at 65°C for 15 min, the other wash
steps were carried out at room temperature for 10 min
each. The slides were spun dry at 800 RPM for 2 minutes. Fluorescent 3DNA capture reagent (which carries
a sequence complementary to the Cy3 and Cy5 tag) was
then hybridised to the array using the SDS-based buffer
with added Anti-Fade reagent (inhibits photobleaching
of Cy5) at 65°C for four hrs. The fluorescent reagent
was then washed as described above for the cDNA
hybridisation.

create spot intensity reports, while CloneTracker (Biodiscovery Inc.) was used to generate gene ID mapping files
and assign gene identification. Final intensity reports
were retrieved as raw spot intensities in tab-delimited
files. The data set is deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database (accession no. GSE6997) at the
following site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.
Microarray data analysis was performed using GeneSpring GX 11.0 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The single colour workflow feature of GeneSpring GX was used in order to split the two channel
array into 2 single colour experiments to enable the analysis of multiple samples across different arrays. Using
the loop design depicted in Figure 2 a comparison across
the moult cycle was made by creating a ‘time series plot’
with each point representing a particular moult stage.
The two colour data was normalised using the robust
scatter plot smoother LOESS (also known as “LOWESS”
for locally-weighted regression and smoothing scatter
plots) [91]. For each chip, normalisation was applied to
the left and right sides separately (spatial positioning of
clones spotted in duplicate was in the format of two
grids located on the left and right side of each array
when orientated horizontally). Raw signals were thresholded to 1.0 and an additional normalisation using the
percentile shift algorithm to the 75 th percentile was
used. Since each feature is spotted onto an array in
duplicate, and three biological replicates are performed
per moult stage comparison, a standard error, a t-statistic, and t-distribution (P value) can be calculated for
each feature represented on the array. K-Means clustering was employed to group transcripts with similar
expression profiles together. The Euclidean distance
measure was used, which takes the standard sum of
squared distance between two entities.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

Data analysis

Following hybridisation experiments, clones that displayed
differential expression (P ≤ 0.05) patterns across moult
stages were sequenced. Overlapping sequences (contigs),
that likely represent the same cDNA, and clones without
sequence identity to other cDNAs (singletons) were identified by comparing all sequences against one another in
Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). The genes were annotated with the name of the
highest basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [92]
score from an analysis of GenBank entries by the BLASTx
and BLASTn procedures. Protein domains were identified
from the Pfam database [93], and InterProScan http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan.

Microarray slides were scanned using a white-light
ArrayWorx Biochip Reader (Applied Precision, LLC, Issaquah, Washington, USA). ImaGene (BioDiscovery Inc., El
Segundo, CA, USA) was then used to process images and
