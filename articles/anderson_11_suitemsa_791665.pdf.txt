SuiteMSA: visual tools for multiple sequence
alignment comparison and molecular sequence
simulation
Catherine L Anderson1, Cory L Strope2 and Etsuko N Moriyama2,3*

Abstract
Background: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a central role in nearly all bioinformatics and molecular
evolutionary applications. MSA reconstruction is thus one of the most heavily scrutinized bioinformatics fields.
Evaluating the quality of MSA reconstruction is often hindered by the lack of good reference MSAs. The use of
sequence evolution simulation can provide such reference MSAs. Furthermore, none of the MSA viewing/editing
programs currently available allows the user to make direct comparisons between two or more MSAs. Considering
the importance of MSA quality in a wide range of research, it is desirable if MSA assessment can be performed
more easily.
Results: We have developed SuiteMSA, a java-based application that provides unique MSA viewers. Users can
directly compare multiple MSAs and evaluate where the MSAs agree (are consistent) or disagree (are inconsistent).
Several alignment statistics are provided to assist such comparisons. SuiteMSA also includes a graphical phylogeny
editor/viewer as well as a graphical user interface for a sequence evolution simulator that can be used to construct
reference MSAs.
Conclusions: SuiteMSA provides researchers easy access to a sequence evolution simulator, reference alignments
generated by the simulator, and a series of tools to evaluate the performance of the MSA reconstruction programs.
It will help us improve the quality of MSAs, often the most important first steps of bioinformatics and other
biological research.

Background
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a central role
in nearly all bioinformatics and molecular evolutionary
applications. Be it to discover sequence structure and
motifs or to infer the evolutionary history among
sequences (phylogeny), the first step is to compare the
sequences by building MSAs. The process of building an
MSA is to infer homologous positions between the
input sequences and place gaps in the sequence in order
to align these homologous positions. These gaps represent evolutionary events of their own. Gaps (also called
indels) are caused by either insertions or deletions of
characters (nucleotides or amino acids) on a particular
lineage of sequences during the evolution. In this sense,

building an MSA is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the sequences involved.
Due to its significant impact on many bioinformatics
and molecular evolutionary analyses, MSA reconstruction is one of the most heavily scrutinized bioinformatics fields. Numerous MSA reconstruction methods
have been developed [1]. Assessment of MSAs, however,
is usually reserved for power users. Often regular users
simply run one MSA method and proceed directly to
the next analysis without examining the alignment output. Considering the importance of MSAs, it is desirable
if quality assessment of MSA methods can be performed
more easily and more intuitively by all researchers who
are interested in sequence analysis. There are a number
of programs available that generate, display, and/or let
users analyze MSAs such as SeaView [2], ClustalX2 [3],
Se-Al [4], Jalview [5], webPRANK [6], as well as MEGA
[7]. However, none of these programs allows the user to

make direct comparisons between two or more MSAs.
SinicView [8] can visualize multiple MSAs. Its use, however, is targeted for genome-scale nucleotide alignments,
and position-by-position comparison among MSAs is
not possible. As Morrison [9,10] also pointed out, visual
inspection of multiple MSAs would greatly help improve
the quality of MSAs and consequently the reconstruction of phylogenies.
Effective evaluation of MSA methods requires reference alignments. These are the MSAs that are considered
to represent the evolutionary history of the sequences
most accurately. The majority of currently available
benchmark MSA datasets are based on structural alignments of real sequences (e.g., PREFAB [11], OXBench
[12], HOMSTRAD [13], BAliBASE [14], SABmark [15],
also see Edgar [16] for some issues with these benchmark
datasets) where the actual evolutionary history is
unknown. Researchers, especially those very familiar with
their sequences, often adjust MSAs manually. This introduces several issues. There is no “standard” way to
adjust/improve an alignment. It is very time consuming
and alignments often cannot be fully resolved. A solution
to these issues is offered by Hillis [17]. He pointed to
sequence evolution simulation as an alternative method
to obtain reference MSAs and analyze MSA algorithms.
Sequence evolution simulation methods generate a set of
related nucleotide or amino acid sequences with a known
evolutionary history, i.e., providing a fully-resolved MSA.
The datasets generated by simulation, with various evolutionary parameter settings, are also useful for evaluating
the robustness, consistency, and efficiency of phylogenetic reconstruction based on different MSA methods.
The disadvantage of using simulated sequences, however,
is that the events during the simulated evolution are limited by the evolutionary models available in the simulators. One must thus choose an appropriate simulator
that can mimic the evolutionary history of the gene or
protein sequences he/she is interested in.
Many molecular evolution simulation programs are
currently available: e.g., INDELible [18], Rose [19],
DAWG [20], MySSP [21], SIMPROT [22], EvolveAGene3 [23], and indel-Seq-Gen version 2.1 (iSGv2.1)
[24]. Rose [19] has been used to generate IRMBASE 2
and DIRMBASE benchmark alignment datasets [25]. All
of these programs require several input files and run on
the command line. One exception is MySSP, which is
run from a simple graphical user interface (GUI). Of the
available simulation programs, iSGv2.1 is the most versatile and complex. It allows for subsequences or sites
to evolve with less stringent assumptions, i.e., relaxing
the assumption of the independent-and-identically-distributed sequence sites, which is prevalent in the field of
molecular evolution simulation. iSGv2.1 thus can generate more realistic protein and gene families [24]. Such

complex and more realistic simulation, however,
requires detailed input files and numerous options with
the command line.
We introduce SuiteMSA, a suite of graphical tools for
MSA comparison that also encapsulates the sequence
evolution simulation program, iSGv2.1. SuiteMSA offers
tools that allow for the direct comparison of multiple
MSAs. These tools assist researchers to visually pinpoint
the areas where alternative MSAs are inconsistent with
a reference MSA, which can be either an MSA obtained
from a benchmark MSA database, a manually curated
MSA, or a true MSA based on simulated sequences. Statistics to aid the quantitative comparisons of MSAs are
provided. SuiteMSA also allows users of any level to
perform simulation of biological sequence evolution.
With intuitive option panels users can quickly set up an
evolutionary model for simulation. After the simulation,
SuiteMSA displays and maps indel events to the true
MSA and also to the simulation guide tree. This
immediate feedback is useful in inspecting the simulated
datasets, allowing the user to choose the set of simulation parameters that is best able to produce datasets
with the desired features. Providing sequence simulation
as well as MSA assessment capability is educational in
understanding how various MSA methods work differently when biological sequences have different evolutionary properties.

Implementation
SuiteMSA is a java-based application that provides
unique MSA viewers (Figure 1). It can be used with any
MSA in fasta format. Individual alignments may be
viewed along with secondary structure (both for proteins
and RNAs) or transmembrane predictions. Users can
directly compare multiple MSAs and evaluate where the
MSAs agree (are consistent) or disagree (are inconsistent) visually as well as quantitatively based on several
statistics. SuiteMSA also allows visual inspection and
editing of phylogenies. Furthermore, it provides a GUI
for a sequence simulator, iSGv2.1. Once communication
is set up between SuiteMSA and iSGv2.1, parameters
can be configured and simulations can be launched
from SuiteMSA. A log tracks all simulations performed
recording the information including parameters used,
date and time stamps, error messages, and all communications with iSGv2.1. Once the simulation is done, the
true MSA and phylogeny with indel events mapped can
be displayed. Note that MSA viewers in SuiteMSA are
independent of the simulation program and do not
require the installation of iSGv2.1.
A case study: the lipocalin protein superfamily

We use multiple alignments and simulation of the
lipocalin superfamily proteins as a case study to

specific tool.

illustrate how the MSA comparison and simulation can
be done with SuiteMSA. Lipocalin proteins are a
family of small globular proteins often implicated in
allergic reactions, among other functions. Members of
the lipocalin superfamily have low sequence identity,
but share a common antiparallel beta-barrel conformation consisting of eight beta-strands, as well as a small
highly-conserved motif near the first beta-strand [26].
We obtained both the manually-adjusted MSA and
phylogeny reconstructed from 23 members of the lipocalin superfamily from Sánchez et al. [27]. Strope et al.
[28] used the same example to introduce iSGv1. We
will use this MSA and guide tree in this case study.
Figure 2A shows this MSA using the MSA Viewer
along with the display of the secondary structures predicted by PSIPRED [29] for each sequence. The 23
lipocalin protein sequences, the alignment and phylogeny, and the predicted secondary structures are available in Additional files 1, 2, 3, and 4.

MSA comparison

SuiteMSA offers two unique tools to compare MSAs:
MSA Comparator (Figure 2B) and Pixel Plot (Figure 3).
For both tools, MSAs are compared against the reference MSA (at the top). The blue and green bars shown
above MSAs in Figures 2B and 3 are the “selection bar”
for the reference MSA and the “range bar” for the alternative MSAs, respectively. The selection bar indicates
the selected region in the reference MSA. The range bar
for an alternative MSA indicates the range covered by
the characters selected in the reference MSA. This
makes the MSA comparison easy, visually depicting the
difference in alignment extension/compaction or
gappiness.
The MSA Comparator allows the user to perform a
fine-grained comparison between two alignments. Figure
2B compares the reference MSA of the lipocalin superfamily proteins (shown also in Figure 2A using the single alignment viewer, MSA Viewer) with the alignment

Figure 2 The MSA Viewer and MSA Comparator. The reference alignment of the lipocalin superfamily proteins is displayed using the MSA
Viewer (A). The secondary structures predicted by PSIPRED [29] are shown below the alignment. The information content [43] of each column
of the alignment is displayed at the bottom, which illustrates the level of conservation. The completely conserved positions in the motif
(positions 29 and 31; the motif region is indicated with the black bar) show the maximum information content (full-height bars). In the MSA
Comparator (B), the ClustalW2 alignment (shown as “Other alignment”) is compared against the “Reference” alignment. The blue selection bar,
which is set to cover 35 sites, is shown above the reference alignment. The green range bar above the ClustalW2 alignment shows the column
range that covers the characters selected in the reference alignment. The colored characters under the selection and range bars in the
alignments show the sequence positions either in agreement (consistent) in blue, or else in red. The consistent (blue) columns largely
correspond to the conserved motif (PROSITE motif PS00213). The column-wise Sum-of-Pairs Score (SPS) is shown between the two alignments.
The SPS, column scores including and excluding gap columns ("with gaps” and “no gaps”, respectively), and percent consistency for the
alignment are shown in the statistics bar at the top of the window.

Figure 3 The Pixel Plot. The Pixel Plot is used to compare the reference alignment of the lipocalin superfamily proteins (MSA 1) with MSAs
reconstructed by three methods: ClustalW2 v2.1 (MSA 2), MAFFT v6.843 (MSA 3), and MUSCLE v3.8.31 (MSA 4). The blue selection bar is shown
at the top of the reference alignment. The green range bar above each of the reconstructed alignments shows the column range that covers
the sequence positions selected in the reference alignment. The areas highlighted in magenta under the selection and range bars in the
alignments show the positions of the characters selected in the reference alignment.

reconstructed by ClustalW2 v2.1 [3]. Alignment positions under the selection and range bars are color-coded
for consistency with respect to the reference MSA.
Characters in consistently aligned columns are colored
blue, and those in columns inconsistently aligned are
colored red. In Figure 2B, for example, the highly conserved area surrounding the position 29 of the reference
alignment is consistent between the two MSAs and
colored blue, whereas after the position 40 the MSAs
are inconsistent and so colored in red. The column-wise
Sum-of-Pairs Score (SPS) [30] is also displayed using a
bar chart in Figure 2B, with maximum-height bars
shown for consistent columns (positions 26 - 39). The
SPS shows the degree of consistency per column
between the two alignments. For detailed description of
these measures see SuiteMSA user’s manual.

The Pixel Plot allows for a quick comparison between
multiple MSAs. As shown in Figure 3, each character in
the MSA is represented as a solid colored pixel and each
gap as a blank pixel. In Figure 3, the reference alignment
of the lipocalin superfamily proteins (at the top) is compared with the three MSAs reconstructed by ClustalW2
v2.1 [3], MAFFT v6.843 [31], and MUSCLE v3.8.31 [32].
The selected characters for the reference alignment
(MSA 1) under the blue selection bar and the corresponding characters for the reconstructed alignments
(MSAs 2-4) under the green range bars are colored in
magenta. This is the same area as selected in Figure 2B.
Sequence simulation

Simulating members of the lipocalin protein superfamily
represents a challenge for many simulators because (i)

Anderson et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/184

due to the short length of the lipocalin proteins, each of
the 19 subsequences (eight beta-strands, one alphahelix, and ten coil regions) has a strict length constraint
and (ii) all members of the family must contain the conserved motif (PROSITE PS00213 [33,34]) near the first
beta-strand. In this section, we set up options for
iSGv2.1 for the lipocalin family simulation. The parameters were chosen by the following procedure:
• The phylogeny reconstructed by Sánchez et al. [27]
was used as the simulation guide tree.
• The alignment presented in Sánchez et al. [27] was
used as the root MSA.
• We analyzed Sánchez et al.’s alignment using the
PROTTEST Web server [35-38] using the guide tree
topology. The model that best fit the data was the
WAG substitution matrix [39] with the Gamma distribution (alpha = 3.88). The amino acid frequencies
as well as the branch lengths for the phylogeny were
also estimated by PROTTEST.
• We estimated the indel parameters based on the
reference alignment and guide tree using the
lambda.pl program from the DAWG package [20].
The geometric distribution with the average length
of 6.97 as the length distribution model and the
indel probability of 0.0516702 per substitution were
returned. We assumed the maximum length of an
indel to be 20 amino acids.
SuiteMSA makes setting up the iSGv2.1 simulation

with all these options easily accessible through the GUI.
Parameters and support files are organized into four
panels based on their intuitive groupings: “Basic parameters”, “Advanced parameters”, “Edit guide tree file”,
and “Edit lineage file”. Figure 4A shows how we can set
the basic simulation parameters including the input/output file names and substitution models. Figure 4B shows
the advanced simulation parameters including the alpha
constant for the Gamma distribution and amino acid
frequencies.
The simulation guide tree must be provided in a guide
tree file in Newick format. The guide tree file also specifies other parameters including indel parameters. These
additional parameters can be set in the “Edit guide tree
file” panel (Figure 5). SuiteMSA also allows the input
guide tree to be modified using a graphic tree editor
(Figure 6). Editing the guide tree graphically, such as
changing the taxon labels, adding clade names, changing
branch lengths, adding/deleting taxa, or rotating clades,
provides immediate feedback ensuring the accuracy of
the changes made.
In the “Edit lineage file” panel, lineages (clades or subtrees) can be added or deleted, and lineage specifications
can be edited. In the panel shown in Figure 7A, we can
edit or add motif specifications through a regular
expression generator. Figure 7B illustrates a special use
of this regular expression generator to specify the subsequence-length “template”. The example includes constraints for 19 subsequences. See Strope et al. [24] for
the details of the use of templates. All support files used

“Advanced parameters” panel (B). In the “Basic parameters” panel, the guide tree file is set to “lipocalinSuperFamily.tree”. The file format, output
file name prefix, output files, as well as the sequence type and substitution model are set in this page. In the “Advanced parameters” page, the
lineage specification file, which contains the motifs to be applied to the simulation, is selected. The alpha constant for the Gamma distribution is
set to 3.88 and the amino acid frequencies are set as shown in this example.

are associated with iSGv2.1 simulation. Figure 8C illustrates the use of the Pixel Plot, which displays a wider
region of the same alignment with the blue selection bar
indicating the positions 257 - 281.
Graphical interface for MSA methods

To assist comparative studies of MSAs, SuiteMSA offers
GUIs for some MSA programs (Figure 9). To use this
function, the appropriate MSA programs need to be
installed. Once installed, the MSA programs can be run
and the resulted alignment viewed through SuiteMSA.
Currently, GUIs for ClustalW2 [3,40] and MUSCLE
[32,41] are available. We plan to expand our support for
other commonly used MSA methods (e.g., MAFFT [31])
in the future.

Figure 5 The “Edit guide tree file” panel. The guide tree file used
by iSGv2.1 contains the partition-specific parameters. Using the “Edit
guide tree file” panel users can set all necessary parameters
including the guide tree. In this example, the MSA-root file for the
lipocalin superfamily contains the alignment obtained from Sánchez
et al. [27]. Indel options are also set as shown. The guide tree can
be edited either by editing the tree in Newick format or by using
an interactive graphical display (see Figure 6).

for this example simulation are available in Additional
files 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Prior to running a simulation, SuiteMSA provides
error-checking for potential parameter conflicts. The
actual command line used to run iSGv2.1 with all necessary options is shown at the top of the iSG Simulator
window as illustrated in Figure 4. The simulation log
file saves the parameters used along with any messages
from iSGv2.1. This log can also be useful for retrieving
the saved iSGv2.1 command-line for a later use.
After a simulation is done, insertion and deletion
events can be tracked on the guide tree using the Phylogeny Viewer (Figure 8A) and in the true MSA using the
Alignment Viewer (Figure 8B). In these viewers, insertion and deletion events are shown in different colors:
insertion events in green and deletion events in yellow.
In the Alignment Viewer, where an insertion and a deletion event occur in the same location, the site is shown
in pink (e.g., positions 226 - 233 in Figure 8B). These
viewers can display any phylogeny and MSA in the
appropriate format (Newick format for phylogenies and
fasta format for MSAs). Note, however, that indel-event
mapping is only available when phylogenies or MSAs

Results and Discussion
As we described before, the performance of MSA methods can be examined against a reference MSA. A reference MSA can be obtained from a benchmark MSA
database or by manually-adjusting any MSA relying on
our own experience and knowledge on the sequences of
our interests. Or we can use a sequence simulator that
generates a “true” MSA based on the given evolutionary
model. In the previous section, we used the lipocalin
superfamily proteins as a case study, and showed how
we can simulate members of such a complex protein
family. Simulated protein sequences were aligned using
different MSA methods. In this section, as a further
example, we will briefly discuss how these reconstructed
MSAs are compared with the “true” MSA obtained from
the simulation as well as the manually adjusted alignment produced by Sánchez et al. [27].
In Figure 2B, Sánchez et al.’s alignment of lipocalin
proteins is used as the reference alignment (at the top)
and compared with the alignment reconstructed by
ClustalW2. In this alignment, the area containing the
PROSITE motif (positions 21 through 34 in the reference alignment) is mostly colored blue showing a high
degree of consistency. Note that the first five positions
of the motif are not consistent (shown in red) due to
the gaps inserted in the ClustalW2 MSA. The entire
motif region, however, maintains high SPS values. However, the characters in the positions 40 through 44 in
the reference alignment are scattered over 17 columns
in the ClustalW2 MSA and colored in red, with 0 or
very low SPS values. We expanded the comparison and
included MSAs reconstructed by MUSCLE and MAFFT
using the Pixel Plot. As shown in Figure 3, the three
methods show their MSAs (MSAs 2-4) consistent with
the reference MSA (MSA 1) at the left edge of the conserved motif region, indicated by the nearly straight
edge marked in magenta in all alignments. However,
there is a high degree of inconsistency in the

Figure 6 Editing the guide tree graphically. The graphical tree editor allows the user to change taxon names, change branch lengths, delete
or add taxa, rotate clades, and add clade names. In this example, a branch is chosen for its length to be changed.

Figure 7 Editing the lineage specification file. The lineage
specification file used by iSGv2.1 allows the users to specify motifs (A)
and templates (B) for different lineages (subtrees or clades). In this
example, the motif “Lipocalin prosite motif (PS00213)” is set for the “root”
lineage, which covers the entire guide tree. Another motif “template” is
used to provide the length constraints for 19 subsequences.

downstream section between the reference alignment
and reconstructed MSAs and even among the three
reconstructed MSAs.
Comparison against the true alignment based on
simulated lipocalin protein sequences showed the same
pattern (Figure 10): a high degree of consistency in the
area where the PROSITE motif is located (sites 258 270 of the reference MSA) and a high degree of inconsistency on the right-hand side of this area. In this reference alignment, we see many indel events immediately
preceding the PROSITE motif (the position 257 or
upstream). As Figures 8B and 8C show, this area
includes several insertions followed by deletions at the
same sites, resulting in gap-only columns in the reference alignment (colored in pink in Figure 8B). As
shown in Figure 10B, this area (~250 amino-acid sites in
the reference) has been compressed into 25 columns in
all three reconstructed MSAs (MSAs 2-4). While many
indel events are found in the region following the PROSITE motif (downstream of the position 270) in the
reference alignment, this region is again compressed in
all three reconstructed MSAs, although less so in the
MAFFT MSA. Regardless of the lengths and gappiness,
this area has been poorly reconstructed by the three
MSA programs. As a consequence of compressed

alignments, the three reconstructed MSAs are much
shorter than the reference MSA (Figure 10B; alignment
lengths are 873, 200, 306, and 214 amino acids for
MSAs 1-4, respectively). Löytynoja and Goldman [42]
pointed out that progressive alignment algorithms, used
in all of ClustalW2, MUSCLE, and MAFFT, tend to produce compacted alignments due to “collapsed insertion”
and “gap magnet” problems. The results shown in Figure 10B indicate that such compaction is particularly

pronounced in ClustalW2 and MUSCLE MSAs. Further
investigation is clearly necessary in order to choose better MSAs.

Conclusions
SuiteMSA provides unique MSA viewers, which allow
researchers to quickly identify inconsistencies among
MSAs reconstructed by different techniques. It assists in
performance evaluation of MSA methods. SuiteMSA also

allows users to perform sequence simulation. This further
assists comparative analysis of MSAs based on the “true”
reference alignment where insertion and deletion events
can be mapped individually onto both the guide tree and
the true MSA. SuiteMSA’s intuitive and user friendly GUI
allows for a quick learning curve in using the powerful
simulation program iSGv2.1. This provides an opportunity
to a wide range of researchers for setting up complex

simulation studies quickly and accurately. With the MSA
Viewer, MSA Comparator, Pixel Plot, as well as a graphical sequence simulator, the Phylogeny Viewer with graphical editing options, and the Alignment Viewer with indelevent tracking, SuiteMSA contributes a wide variety of
unique features to the field of multiple sequence alignment, sequence evolution simulation, and more general
bioinformatics research.
