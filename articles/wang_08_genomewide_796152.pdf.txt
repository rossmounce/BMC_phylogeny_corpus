Abstract
Background: Genes in the CCCH family encode zinc finger proteins containing the motif with
three cysteines and one histidine residues. They have been known to play important roles in RNA
processing as RNA-binding proteins in animals. To date, few plant CCCH proteins have been
studied functionally.
Results: In this study, a comprehensive computational analysis identified 68 and 67 CCCH family
genes in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. A complete overview of this gene family in Arabidopsis
was presented, including the gene structures, phylogeny, protein motifs, and chromosome
locations. In addition, a comparative analysis between these genes in Arabidopsis and rice was
performed. These results revealed that the CCCH families in Arabidopsis and rice were divided
into 11 and 8 subfamilies, respectively. The gene duplication contributed to the expansion of the
CCCH gene family in Arabidopsis genome. Expression studies indicated that CCCH proteins
exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Finally, evolutionary analysis
showed that one subfamily is higher plant specific. The expression profile indicated that most
members of this subfamily are regulated by abiotic or biotic stresses, suggesting that they could
have an effective role in stress tolerance.
Conclusion: Our comparative genomics analysis of CCCH genes and encoded proteins in two
model plant species provides the first step towards the functional dissection of this emerging family
of potential RNA-binding proteins.

Background
Transcription factors are important regulators of cellular
processes, and the complexity of living organisms necessitates a large number of transcription factors. The zinc finger motifs, which are classified based on the arrangement
of the zinc-binding amino acids, are present in many transcription factors and play critical roles in interactions with

other molecules [1,2]. A large amount of zinc-finger transcription factors are implicated in important biological
processes and many of them often share common characteristic to form a family. So far, several zinc finger families
have been found in plants, such as RING-finger, ERF,
WRKY, DOF and LIM family [3-8]. However, most of

them are identified as DNA-binding or protein-binding
proteins, fewer function as RNA-binding proteins.

information from the output of analysis programs and
other text files [37,38].

The CCCH zinc finger motif has been found in proteins
from organisms ranging from man to yeast [9-18]. The
CCCH proteins are a large family of zinc finger containing
C3H-type motifs and many evidences proved that they
may be RNA-binding proteins functioning in RNA
processing [19-21]. In mouse, tristetraprolin, a protein
containing two CCCH zinc fingers, binds directly to AUrich elements within the 3'-untranslated region of target
transcripts to facilitate mRNA degradation [22-25].
Zfp36l2, like its better-known relative TTP, is a mRNAbinding and destabilizing protein, functions in the physiological control of female fertility at the level of early
embryonic development [26]. The PIE-1 is an essential
regulator of Caenorhabditis elegans germ cell fate that segregates with the germ lineage by inhibition of transcription or activation of protein expression from maternal
RNAs [27]. Compared to animals, only a few of plant
CCCH proteins have been characterized functionally. In
Arabidopsis thaliana, HUA1 has been proved to be a RNAbinding protein and likely participates in a new regulatory
mechanism governing flower development [19].
AtCPSF30 encodes a small polypeptide which shares the
probable ortholog of the 30-kD subunit of the mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, and it
was shown to be nucleus-localized RNA-binding protein
that binds calmodulin [20]. PEI1 is an embryo-specific
CCCH zinc finger protein that plays an important role
during Arabidopsis embryogenesis, functioning primarily
in the apical domain of the embryo [28]. FES1 interacts
genetically with FRI and FRL1 to promote the winterannual habit of Arabidopsis and might be involved in the
processing of mRNA [29]. In rice (Oryza sativa), OsDOS is
a nuclear protein that delays leaf senescence by integrating
developmental cues to the jasmonate (JA) pathway [30].
It was also proposed to play a role in posttranscriptional
level by interacting with target RNA.

In this study, we wrote Perl program to search against the
entire genome of two species and performed a genomewide analysis of the CCCH gene family in Oryza sativa and
Arabidopsis. A total of 68 CCCH genes from Arabidopsis
and 67 from Oryza sativa were identified and most of them
have not been reported previously. Phylogenetic analyses
revealed that the CCCH families in Arabidopsis and Oryza
sativa were divided into 11 and 8 subfamilies, respectively.
Expression studies indicated that CCCH proteins exhibit a
variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Detailed analysis of the higher plant-specific subfamily IX of Arabidopsis revealed its involvement in
response to various stresses. Our genomics analysis provides the framework for future studies to dissect the function of this emerging family of potential RNA-binding
proteins.

Given the potential for CCCH proteins to function diverse
roles by associating with RNA and most of members containing CCCH motif remaining poorly understood, it was
of considerable interest to us to characterize the plant
CCCH gene family. The availability of the Arabidopsis and
Oryza sativa genome sequences allows the genome-wide
comparative analysis of gene families between monocot
and eudicot plants [31-35].
Perl is one of the most widely used programming languages for managing and manipulating life-science information [36]. Perl has been extremely successful for
connecting software applications together into sequence
analysis pipelines, converting file formats, and extracting

Results and discussion
Identification of genes coding for CCCH zinc finger protein
in Arabidopsis
The previous research revealed that CCCH zinc finger protein contained 1–6 copies of C3H-type zinc-finger motifs
characterized by three Cys and one His (Figure 1). Berg et
al. defined that the CCCH family is a group of zinc-finger
protein consisting of canonical C-X-C-X-C-X-H motif (CX6–14-C-X4–5-C-X3-H) [21]. Based on the different amino
acid spacing numbers between Cys and His in zinc finger
motif, we divided the family into 18 groups (Table 1). The
protein containing the motif within these groups was considered as a candidate member of CCCH family.

To uncover the entire family of genes coding for CCCH
zinc finger protein in Arabidopsis, we analyzed the proteome data with a program written by Perl (Figure 2, see
Additional file 1, 2, 3), in which a regular expression
(C\w{6,14}C\w{4,5}C\w{3}H) was used to search for
the CCCH motifs. Sequences that matched the criteria
within 18 groups could be easily detected by the program
and were considered as putative CCCH proteins.
In addition, to verify the reliability of our result, we performed multiple BLAST algorithms to search against the
corresponding data set using the known CCCH proteins
got from several database as our query (see Methods).
Another program written by Perl was used to parse the
results and exclude the redundant entries from the initial
data set.
The Perl program could identify all the amino acid
sequences included the ones which do not belong to
CCCH family. For instance, the sequences "CIRLEAYEDCIEYFVCLNGH" in AT5G15440 could be detected as a C-

Subsequently, we performed SMART and Pfam analysis to
find the putative CCCH protein sequences [39,40]. Seventy-nine proteins with typical CCCH motif encoded by
68 genes were detected from the original data, and five of

them,
AT1G19860,
AT2G16470,
AT2G33835,
AT3G51120 and AT5G12440, contained a predicted
CCCH motif with low confidence values. The proteins
which were not detected by SMART and Pfam were eliminated from our study. For AT3G51180, which could not
be detected by SMART and Pfam but has a sister gene in
genome duplication region and contains a C-X8-C-X5-CX3-H motif, was also considered as a member of CCCH
zinc-finger family. In addition, we wrote another program
to analyse the type of CCCH motifs based on the residue
number between the four conserved amino acids (see
Additional file 4 and 5). If a new motif was not referred in
the 18 groups, we modified our Perl program with the
new motif to search against the entire proteome again. For
instance, when a detected C-X8-C-X6-C-X3-H motif was
not mentioned by Berg et al., we rewrote new regular
expression for matching the sequences of this motif. After
verifying the reliability of the new motif in the protein by
SMART and Pfam, we added it to the CCCH family. The
motifs which were not mentioned by Berg et al. were also
listed in Table 1, making a total of 23 groups.
Community microarray data, Massively Parallel Signature
Sequencing searches, and ESTs database provided confirmative transcript information for all 68 genes (Table 2).
From the above evidences, no pseudogene was found
among the 68 genes. The CCCH genes were listed in Table
2 and their entry numbers were assigned according to the
order of CCCH genes appearing on the Arabidopsis chromosomes, from the short arm to the long arm, and from
chromosomes 1 to 5 (see Additional file 6).

proteins containing the catalytic triad Cys-His-Asn domain.
CCCH motifs that were not referred in the studies of Berg et al. [21].

genetic analysis of the 68 Arabidopsis protein sequences
to construct a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Although the
signature CCCH motif of the CCCH proteins is well conserved, the motif number of each protein and spacing
amino acids between adjacent CCCH zinc-finger motifs
are diverse, so it is difficult to make alignment using
CCCH motifs. Accordingly, an alignment of full-length
CCCH proteins was constructed using ClustalX and
refined manually [41]. A phylogenetic tree was generated
with the neighbor-joining method [42]. For statistical reliability, we conducted bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. The tree topologies are similar with different treebuilding methods except in deep nodes. From the values
obtained in the bootstrap analysis, it is apparent that the
phylogenetic relationship is unclear and the bootstrap values are low in deep nodes. Nevertheless, in outer clades,
the CCCH protein has better resolution, permitting subfamilies of proteins to be delimited. This phenomenon
was also observed in the analysis of the bHLH [43], Dof
[8], WRKY [44], and IQD [45] transcription factor families. Alternatively, it may be due to the divergence of the
CCCH motif, especially the diverse motif numbers and
spacing in the amino acid sequences between Cys and His
in each protein. We could not infer evolutionary relationships between the different subfamilies of CCCH proteins

because the internal nodes did not show high support. By
contrast, within each subfamily, the strong amino acid
sequence conservation is evident from the short branch
lengths at the tips of the tress, suggestive of strong evolutionary relationships among subfamily members.
Based on the statistical support of each branch, we divided
the Arabidopsis CCCH family into 11 subfamilies, which
was supported by more than 90% bootstrap value, designated I to XI (Figure 3). The genes with low bootstrap
value were not divided into subfamilies, and also were not
taken into consideration for further analysis. The genes
clustered pairwisely and supported by bootstrap value
1000 are mostly paralogous genes in Arabidopsis. Totally,
18 pairs of putative paralogous genes were found in Arabidopsis.
The analysis of protein motif and gene structure
To discover motifs shared among related proteins within
the family, we used MEME [46], which performs motif
searches in groups of related DNA or protein sequences.
The search was performed separately for each of the subfamilies of proteins. Moreover, SMART and Pfam were
used to annotate the motifs found by MEME. As expected,
the proteins within same subfamily exhibit the common

CCCH motifs, suggesting the major functional role of
CCCH motif in these proteins, although few motifs outside the CCCH domain were detected by MEME as well.
The schemes of the protein motifs of the individual members of the CCCH family clearly demonstrate structural
similarities among the proteins within one subfamily
(Figure 3). For example, the members of subfamily IV
contain tandem WD40 domains. All eleven members of
subfamily IX consist of three highly conserved tandem
motifs (C-X5-H-X4-C-X3-H, C-X7–8-C-X5-C-X3-H and C-X5C-X4-C-X3-H) and nine members of subfamily I contain
five C-X8-C-X5-C-X3-H zinc finger motifs. Furthermore,
twelve proteins contain well-defined RNA-binding
domain RRM or KH motifs suggesting their potential roles
involved in RNA binding [47].
The gene structures in terms of intron number and gene
length were also consistent with the phylogenetic subfamilies defined in Figure 3. Most members in same subfamilies had similar intron/exon structure. The fact that
they not only contain common motifs but also share very
similar intron/exon structure supports their close evolutionary relationship and membership in the same subfamily. Taken together, our results validate the
classification of the CCCH family genes of Arabidopsis.
Evolution and divergence of the CCCH family genes in
Arabidopsis
The Arabidopsis genome has undergone several rounds of
genome-wide duplication events, including polyploidy
[48,49], which has great impact on the amplification of
members of a gene family in the genome. To further investigate the relationship between the genetic divergence
within the CCCH family and gene duplication in Arabidopsis, the chromosomal location of each CCCH gene
was determined from the genomic sequences of Arabidopsis [50]. Based on the chromosomal location information provided by the NCBI [51] and TAIR [52], we
localized 68 CCCH genes in Arabidopsis chromosomes
and determined that the genes are distributed across all
five chromosomes (Figure 4). Relatively low densities of
CCCH genes were observed in some chromosomal
regions, including the top of chromosome 4, and the bottom of chromosome 1. Twenty-two genes were found in

previously identified duplicated segmental regions on
chromosomes that are the result of a polyploidy that
occurred around 24 to 40 million years ago, probably
close to the emergence of the crucifer family [53]. Another
seven gene pairs (AtC3H1 and AtC3H51, AtC3H8 and
AtC3H60, AtC3H12 and AtC3H28, AtC3H14 and
AtC3H15, AtC3H30 and AtC3H56, AtC3H46 and
AtC3H55, AtC3H59 and AtC3H62) were identified to
share common gene structure and zinc finger motif.
Although Blanc et al. did not include the seven gene pairs
as duplicated pair genes in recently duplicated segmental
chromosomes, the phylogenetic relationship and
sequence similarity suggest that they are closely related to
each other. Furthermore, AtC3H12 and AtC3H28 were
listed as duplicated genes in the segmental duplications
dataset maintained from TIGR. Therefore, they were considered to be putative duplicated genes (Figure 4). Consequently, about 53% of CCCH genes, which lie within
recently duplicated segmental chromosomes, have a clear
relative in these regions. Since the density of the duplicated genes in recently duplicated segmental chromosomes was reported to be 28.0% ± 7.8% [53], the
duplicated pairs of CCCH genes have been preferentially
retained compared with other genes. This finding is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that duplicated genes involved in signal transduction and
transcription are preferentially retained [54,55]. In summary, large-scale segmental duplication events appear to
have exclusively contributed to the current complexes of
the CCCH gene family.
In order to test whether CCCH family is ubiquitous in
other organisms, CCCH genes in moss were also identified. Although ESTs are incomplete, a preliminary examination using the BLAST program suggested that almost all
of the CCCH genes belonging to subfamily I, II, III, IV, V,
VI, VII, X and XI in Arabidopsis have corresponding
homologous members in moss. For subfamily VIII, since
only 3 members are present in Arabidopsis, it is difficult
to detect their corresponding homologous genes in the
incomplete EST database of moss. However, the subfamily IX, which contains 11 genes in Arabidopsis, is not
extracted in moss, suggesting that it is a particular sub-

family only belonging to advanced plants or arises from
the evolutionary process to adapt the circumstance.

Identification of CCCH genes in rice
Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world
and it has been used as a major model species in plant
(especially monocot) functional genomics research
because of its relatively small genome size and extensively
sequenced genome [32]. To explore the occurrence and
size of the CCCH gene family in rice, we wrote a Perl program to analyze the genome file of rice (ssp. japonica) got
from The TIGR Rice Genome Annotation Database and
Resource (see Additional file 7). Multiple BLAST searches
were also performed in several rice databases using the
typical CCCH protein sequence as the queries to validate
the primary results. After detecting the CCCH motifs by
SMART and Pfam, 67 CCCH genes were identified in rice
(Table 3, see Additional file 8). To determine their phylogenetic relationships, a phylogenetic tree was constructed
using the full length protein sequences. Like the CCCH
protein family in Arabidopsis, the phylogenetic analysis
reveals 8 subfamilies supported by high bootstrap values.
The members of same subfamily share the similar gene
structure and zinc finger motifs (see Additional file 9A).
We also detected two large subfamilies in the tree, in
which the members share the same characteristic with the
genes of corresponding subfamilies in Arabidopsis.
Unlike the Arabidopsis CCCH family, the distribution of
CCCH genes in the rice genome is clearly biased towards
the chromosomes 1 to 7 (see Additional file 10). Four
CCCH genes are each found on chromosomes 8, 9 and 12,
and only one gene, however, is present on chromosome
10 and 11, respectively. The topology of the phylogenetic
tree of rice CCCH genes indicates 13 pairs of putative
duplicated genes that are close paralogs (OsC3H2 and
OsC3H35, OsC3H5 and OsC3H6, OsC3H9 and
OsC3H39, OsC3H10 and OsC3H37, OsC3H14 and
OsC3H44, OsC3H19 and OsC3H32, OsC3H22 and
OsC3H23, OsC3H24 and OsC3H67, OsC3H38 and
OsC3H60, OsC3H40 and OsC3H49, OsC3H42 and
OsC3H43, OsC3H54 and OsC3H51, OsC3H63 and
OsC3H66). These genes represent 39% of the rice CCCH
gene family members and might have evolved from putative rice genome duplication events.

To explore the evolutionary history of the CCCH gene
family in greater detail and to testify our assumption
about subfamily IX, we searched publicly available
genomic and EST databases for all angiosperm species
represented in the TIGR Plant Gene Indices as well as for
the gymnosperm Pinus ssp. [56]. As expected, almost all of
the members in Arabidopsis have their counterparters in
these higher plants. These results suggest that the basis of
the phylogenetic topology of the CCCH family had

Comparative phylogenetic analyses of the CCCH genes in
Arabidopsis and rice
In order to evaluate the evolutionary relationship among
the CCCH proteins, we performed a phylogenetic analysis
based on the full-length amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis and rice. Because of the large number of taxa and
relatively small number of characters in full-length
sequences, the bootstrap values of internal nodes were
low, whereas the outer nodes had more credible bootstrap

values, allowing for clustering of the CCCH genes of Arabidopsis and rice into 20 subfamilies (see Additional file
9B). The tree topology, as well as the subfamily organization, resembled those from the rice and Arabidopsis individual trees. Eight subfamilies from Arabidopsis and rice
clustered together into the same branch in the combined
tree and 30 putative orthologs were identified in the tree
(see Additional file 9B), suggesting that an ancestral set of
CCCH genes already existed before the monocot-eudicot
divergence. Moreover, the paralogous genes of Arabidopsis and rice were already displayed as paralogs in the
respective trees.
Despite the differences in genome sizes between Arabidopsis and rice (125 Mb and 389 Mb respectively) and
encoded number of genes, the two plant species appear to
have a very similar number of genes encoding CCCH zincfinger proteins (68 and 67 putative numbers, respectively). Compared with other gene families in Arabidopsis
and rice, the CCCH gene family is one of the largest families in plant and includes diverse members with distinct
specificities. As shown in Figure 5, the proteins containing
C-X7–8-C-X5-C-X3-H motif constitute the largest groups in
the CCCH zinc-finger family. In Arabidopsis, 42 members
contain C-X7-C-X5-C-X3-H motif and 44 members contain
C-X8-C-X5-C-X3-H motif, while the number is 35 and 36
in rice, respectively, suggesting that C-X7–8-C-X5-C-X3-H
motif may be an ancestor of other CCCH motifs. In addition, five novel CCCH motifs beyond the 18 groups were
identified, including C-X4-C-X5-C-X3-H, C-X5-C-X4-C-X3H, C-X7-C-X6-C-X3-H, C-X8-C-X6-C-X3-H and C-X15-C-X5C-X3-H. Further experiments are required to determine
their binding activity to Zn2+ and biological functions.
To determine sequence features of these CCCH motifs, we
performed sequence alignments of 302 CCCH motifs
(152 from Arabidopsis and 150 from rice) using the Clustal X program [41]. The weblogo indicated that four (three
cysteines and one histidine) amino acids are completely
conserved among all the CCCH motifs and more than
75% of the CCCH motifs contain glycine and phenylalanine (Figure 6) [57]. In addition, the distributions of
conserved amino acids among the CCCH motifs of both
Arabidopsis and rice are similar. Given these characteristic
of verified protein sequences, we developed a new criteria
to objectively define those sequences to be considered as

CCCH motif. The CCCH proteins are characterized by one
to six C-X4–15-C-X4–6-C-X3-H motifs which are glycine-rich
and phenylalanine-rich sequences.
The expression pattern of CCCH genes in Arabidopsis and
rice
Since gene expression patterns can provide important
clues for gene function, we examined the expression of
Arabidopsis and rice CCCH genes in root, leaf, flower and
seed tissues using massively parallel signature sequencing
(MPSS) data and EST data of NCBI (Figure 7) [58,59]. In
Arabidopsis, expression profiles of 65 and 63 CCCH
genes were extracted from MPSS and EST databases,
respectively. After integrating two data together, we found
that most of the genes have a very broad expression spectrum, and only six genes (AtC3H9, AtC3H10, AtC3H28,
AtC3H51, AtC3H53 and AtC3H62) were not detected
from any specific tissue according to EST and MPSS data.
Except AtC3H53, five of these six genes were detected in
mix tissue of Arabidopsis from EST database. Furthermore, we also summarized the expression of rice CCCH
genes using the same methods. Expression of 57 rice
CCCH genes was detected from MPSS database, and 58
had matching ESTs. Thirteen CCCH genes in rice had no
tissue expression pattern, while eight of them contain corresponding ESTs and five (OsC3H21, OsC3H48,
OsC3H57, OsC3H58 and OsC3H64) without expression
information might be pseudogenes, or expressed at specific developmental stages or under special conditions.

By combining the EST and MPSS results together, we
found that the accumulation of CCCH gene transcripts
not only is associated with different tissues, but also the
expression pattern of each CCCH gene member differed.
According to expression profiles, CCCH genes can be classified into three groups. The largest group is the genes that
expressed in all tissues, including 33 genes in Arabidopsis
and 36 genes in rice, and the second group contains 18
Arabidopsis CCCH genes and 12 rice CCCH genes whose
expression were detected in the majority, but not all, of
the tissues. Interestingly, the third group includes 17
genes with very specific expression. AtC3H50 and
AtC3H68 are exclusively expressed in roots, while
AtC3H18, AtC3H35, AtC3H43, OsC3H36 and OsC3H39
in inflorescences, AtC3H45, OsC3H28 and OsC3H30 in

with specific expression patterns can be the focus of functional studies for their possible roles in specific tissues.
Because of the limitation of current information from
MPSS and EST databases, expression of some genes within
the tissues might not be detected. Further investigation of
spatial and developmental expression patterns will need
to be performed to obtain more detailed expression information.

OsC3H1 and OsC3H52 in seeds. When compared the
expression pattern of the AtC3H45, which could not be
detected by SMART and Pfam but contains a C-X8-C-X5-CX3-H motif, with its sister gene AtC3H68, we found that
they share different expression profiles with relatively low
level (AtC3H45 could be only detected in leaves, while
AtC3H68 is exclusively expressed in roots). In addition,
we examined the expression of other CCCH duplicated
gene pairs of both Arabidopsis and rice, and only 20 of 31
pairs (18 duplicated gene pairs in Arabidopsis and 13 in
rice) share the same expression pattern. These results are
consistent with the previous research by Blanc and Wolfe,
that the expression profiles of the two paralogs have
diverged in concert, forming two parallel networks, and
the expression of each gene is strongly correlated with the
other nonhomologous genes in its network but poorly
correlated with its paralog in the other network, suggesting functional diversification of the surviving duplicated
genes is a major feature of the long-term evolution of
polyploids [55].
Expression profiling within different tissues is only the
first step to understanding the function of CCCH genes.
Overall, the CCCH family members show diverse expression patterns. A majority of the CCCH genes are expressed
in all tissues tested, with various expression levels. It
might be a common character of large transcription factor
families, such as MYB family [60]. In addition, the genes

Characteristics of subfamily IX genes of Arabidopsis and
subfamily I genes of rice
Subfamily IX containing 11 members in Arabidopsis and
subfamily I containing 9 members in rice are the largest
CCCH subfamily in each species, respectively. All the proteins encoded by these 20 genes include two CCCH
motifs. With the exception of OsC3H10, OsC3H37 and
OsC3H52 in rice, the products of 17 genes commonly
contain two tandem consensus motifs, C-X7–8-C-X5-C-X3H and C-X5-C-X4-C-X3-H. In OsC3H10 and OsC3H37
proteins, the first zinc finger is replaced by a C-X10-C-X5C-X3-H motif, while in OsC3H52 the first zinc finger is CX15-C-X5-C-X3-H. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed
that all twenty members contain highly conserved C-X5-CX4-C-X3-H motif, which is a characteristic of these proteins. Additionally, putative consensus CHCH (C-X5-HX4-C-X3-H) motif was also observed in these 20 proteins,
implying that it may be a novel zinc finger motif and execute some biological functions (Figure 8A). Moreover, the
number of amino acids between the three motifs is invariable and all the 20 genes have no introns (Figure 3, see
Additional file 9A).

As shown in Figure 9A, phylogenetic analysis indicated
that the subfamily IX of Arabidopsis consists of two major
subgroups. Interestingly, with exception of two CCCH
motifs, ankyrin (ANK) repeat motif was also identified by
MEME search using amino acid sequences of all members
of subgroup 2 (Figure 8B). The ANK repeat motif is one of
the most common protein-protein interaction motifs in
nature, and it has been found in proteins of diverse function such as transcriptional initiators, ion transporters and
signal transducers [61-64]. The database search further
revealed that only six genes coding proteins with ANK
repeats and zinc finger domains in whole Arabidopsis
genome, five of them belong to CCCH subfamily IX. In
addition, to evaluate the evolutionary relationships
within the 20 genes, we performed a combined phylogenetic analysis of the 20 Arabidopsis and rice amino acid
sequences to obtain a joint tree. Three subgroups can be
observed from the combined tree (Figure 9B). In subgroup 1 of the combined tree, all nine genes of both Arabidopsis and rice contain the ANK domain. Surprisingly,
within each subgroup, the rice and Arabidopsis genes
appear closely related to genes of the same species, and
only one putative ortholog pairs (AtC3H66 and

OsC3H33) were identified in the combined tree. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that these genes
may go through a complex and extensive evolution in
each species after monocot-eudicot divergence.
Previous studies demonstrated that OsDOS, AtCPSF30
and HUA1 are nuclear-localized proteins [19,20,30]. The
database research with full-length protein sequences of
subfamily IX of Arabidopsis and subfamily I of rice suggested that all members are localized in the cell nucleus
(see Methods). In animal, TTP was shown to export from
the nucleus mediated by a Leucine-rich Nuclear Export
Signal (NES). To our knowledge, no Leucine-rich NES in
plant proteins has been identified. When we performed
our program using the developed widely accepted NES
consensus [LV]-x(2,3)-[LIVFM]-x(2,3)-L-x-[LIMTKD] to
detect 68 Arabidopsis CCCH proteins [65], 54 proteins
containing putative NES sequences were identified
including all of 11 members of subfamily IX (Figure 8C,
see Additional file 11 and 12). The result suggests that all
subfamily IX proteins of Arabidopsis may be nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins involved in signal transduction
events [66].

Recently, a few genes within these 20 genes have been
shown to play crucial roles in abiotic and/or biotic stressresponsive gene expression. OsDOS (LOC_Os01g09620)
was proved to be involved in JA pathway [30]. ZFAR1
(At2g40140) transcript was induced by Botrytis in inoculated Arabidopsis lines and zfar1 mutant was hypersensitive to ABA [67]. In order to better understand the
function of these genes, we firstly examined the expression of all the genes of subfamily IX of Arabidopsis in
response to multiple environmental stimuli by means of
microarray data available at Genevestigator site [68]. The
results revealed that all genes of subfamily IX were activated or suppressed by various stresses, including salt,
cold, mannitol, ABA, hypoxia and osmotic stress (Figure
10A). Secondly, we analyzed the expression of these 11
genes in Arabidopsis plants treated with drought (mannitol), salt, cold, and ABA by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure
10B, the RT-PCR results are in better agreement with the
microarray data, suggesting their involvement in abiotic
and/or biotic stress.

ment (ARE) have been determined [69]. Sequences alignment show that among 135 CCCH proteins in
Arabidopsis and rice, AtC3H14, AtC3H15, OsC3H9 and
OsC3H39 share high amino acid sequence identities with
TIS11D (Figure 11A). Like the TIS11D, each of these four
proteins contains two tandem (C-X8-C-X5-C-X3-H) CCCH
zinc fingers and a linker of 18 residues between the two
zinc finger motifs. In addition, many other residues are
strictly conserved. To obtain insights of the structure of
plant CCCH zinc finger, we have taken the coordinates of

the TIS11D CCCH domain complex and modelled the
structure of the interaction of the AtC3H14 (AT1G66810)
CCCH domain peptide with the RNA nonamer (5'-UUAUUUAUU-3'), using the Swiss-Model programs [70]. It is
apparent that the RNA-binding domain of the AtC3H14 is
likely to be identical in structure to that of TIS11D. Compared with the structure of TIS11D, the characteristic
KTEL(V) motif at the N-terminus of each zinc finger
domain provides a critical part of the RNA-binding surface; each motif forms two walls of a deep pocket that
accommodates the bases of U6 and U2 in fingers 1 and 2,
respectively (Figure 11B). The model illustrates the aromatic stack formed from U2-Phe293-A3, U4-Tyr287-U5,
U6-Phe255-A7 and U8-Tyr249-U9, which are essential for
high-affinity binding. Mutation within these critical
hydrophobic amino acids might make the domain abrogate RNA binding (Figure 11C). Further mutagenesis
experiments would be required to establish the contributions of these residues to binding affinity.
In mammals, some proteins containing tandem CCCH
domains, such as TTP and TIS11D, have been proved to
bind to the class II ARE in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs and promote their deadenylation
and degradation [71]. AREs are sequence elements of 50–
150 nt that are rich in adenosine and uridine bases. They
are located in the 3'-UTRs of many but not all mRNAs that
have a short half-life and have been identified by their
capacity to provoke degradation of the host mRNA by a
mechanism dependent on deadenylation. It has been estimated that 5–8% of human genes code for ARE-containing mRNAs, and the corresponding proteins perform a
variety of functions implicated in numerous transient biological processes [72]. Henceforth, only two plant CCCH
(HUA1 and AtCPSF30) proteins have been proved to have
the RNA-binding ability by experimental evidence. Extraction of ARE-containing mRNAs in 3'-UTR of Arabidopsis
genome was performed using Patmatch tools of TAIR. The
3'-UTRs were searched for the 13-bp pattern
WWWU(AUUUA)UUUW. Totally, we identified 200
genes containing 258 ARE in their 3'-UTR mRNA (see
Additional file 13). The potential relationship between
the plant CCCH proteins and the AU-rich mRNA need
been confirmed by experiment approaches in the future.

Conclusion
In this study, we developed a new method employed regular expression of Perl to identify the gene family. By this
method, 68 and 67 CCCH genes were identified in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively, and they formed 20 subfamilies that were supported by phylogeny, protein motifs
and intron/exon structures. Compared with other gene
families in rice and Arabidopsis, the CCCH gene family is
one of the largest families in plants. Gene duplication
analysis revealed that during the expansion of the CCCH

gene family, many subfamilies and subgroups have
evolved, resulting in a high level of functional divergence.
Most of the subfamilies/subgroups are present both in
Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that the appearance of
many of the genes in these species predates monocot/eudicot divergence. Members within a given subfamily/subgroup may have recent common evolutionary origins and
may possess common zinc finger motifs that have related
molecular functions. Available data supported the
hypothesis that CCCH genes in plants perform a variety of
functions in different tissues at multiple developmental
stages. The subfamily IX of Arabidopsis with many interesting characters was investigated in details, in which
members are shown to be involved in plant stress
responses. We then proposed that the genes of subfamily
IX possibly play roles as nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins involved in signal transduction events. Although the
function of most plant CCCH genes is unknown, the phylogenetic and expression analyses provide a solid foundation for future functional studies in both Arabidopsis and
rice. Overall, we have identified a novel zinc finger family
and results presented here can serve as useful information
for guiding future experimental work and understanding
the structure-function relationship of the members of the
CCCH gene family.

Methods
Identification of CCCH protein in Arabidopsis and rice
A preliminary search for CCCH proteins was performed
using a program written by Perl. This program could
search against the CCCH proteins with the regular expression in entire Arabidopsis and rice genome file which was
downloaded from the FTP of TAIR [52] and TIGR [73].
The regular expression (C\w{6,14}C\w{4,5}C\w{3}H)
was designed according to the previous studies. All of the
proteins which matched the expression would be considered as candidate CCCH proteins. The obtained protein
sequences were then examined for the CCCH motif using
the hidden Markov model of SMART/Pfam tool. The proteins without CCCH motif were eliminated from the datasets. The new type motif which was not referred by the
previous studies was used to modify the regular expression. The modified regular expression was used to retrieve
for another round of searching, and new results were
added to the original dataset.

Another approach of retrieving CCCH genes from database was employed. Multiple database searches were performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
algorithms BLASTP and TBLASTN with various published
CCCH proteins as query sequences and with the E-value
cutoff set as 1e-005. For Arabidopsis, the databases
searched included NCBI [51], DATF [74], MAtDB [75],
TAIR [52], and TIGR [73] and for rice, the databases
searched included NCBI [51], TIGR [76], Rice Genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/44

Database-japonica of the Rice Genome Research Program
[77] and The International Rice Genome Sequencing
Project (IRSGP) [78]. The redundant sequences with different identification numbers and the same chromosome
locus were removed from our data set.
The hits obtained from all the above methods were
pooled together and another program written by Perl was
performed to eliminate the redundant dataset. Some programs used in this research are listed in additional file (see
Additional file 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7).
Sequence properties of Arabidopsis and rice CCCH genes
The amino acid sequences of the CCCH proteins were
analyzed for physicochemical parameters (ProtParam)
and predicted subcellular localization (SubLoc v1.0) on
DBSubLoc [79]. MEME (Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation) was used to identify conserved
motif structures of CCCH protein sequences.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of CCCH sequences
Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were performed using ClustalX and were manually corrected. For
generating the phylogenetic tree, we used ClustalX (1.83)
and the neighbor-joining algorithm. Bootstrap analysis
with 1,000 replicates was used to evaluate the significance
of the nodes. Representations of the calculated trees were
constructed using TreeView. The phylogenetic trees of Figure 9 were constructed by neighbor-joining algorithms of
MEGA3.1. Bootstrapping was performed 1000 times to
obtain support values for each branch.
The location of CCCH genes on chromosomes
To determine the location of CCCH genes on Arabidopsis
chromosomes, Chromosome Map Tool at TAIR was used
[50]. Gene duplications and their presence on duplicated
chromosomal segments were investigated using "Paralogous in Arabidopsis" with the default parameters set to a
minimum threshold for paired proteins per block above 7
[80]. For rice, all the sequenced contigs of japonica cv Nipponbare have been physically constructed as pseudomolecules by the IRGSP, representing the 12 rice
chromosomes, and available in GenBank. Each of the rice
CCCH genes was positioned on these rice chromosome
pseudomolecules by the BLASTN search.
Other plant species
To identify members of the moss CCCH protein family,
multiple database searches were performed using the
stand-alone BLAST tools available on NCBI. The EST database of moss was obtained on the Physcomitrella EST
Project Web site [81], and then the file of results was
parsed by a program written by Perl. For CCCH members
of pine, the same method was used to search against the

Page 17 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:44

database got from NSF Genomics of Loblolly Pine Embryogenesis Project [56].
Expression analysis of CCCH genes
We used MPSS and EST data to detect the expression patterns of CCCH genes. The locus name of CCCH genes
were used to query the MPSS database containing the signature information of the CCCH genes. EST data came
from UniGene of NCBI, TIGR and TAIR. We also searched
the expression data of Arabidopsis CCCH genes in the
database of Genevestigator [68].
RT-PCR analysis
Plant tissues of Arabidopsis were harvested and ground in
liquid nitrogen. For reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR
analysis, total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA preparation was then treated with DNase
I. First strand synthesis of cDNA was performed by using
oligo (dT) primer and M-MLV RT (Promega). PCR products were fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing
ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light.
These experiments were independently replicated at least
three times under identical conditions. Details of primers
are listed in the Additional file 14.
Structure model
The model of complex of plant CCCH protein with the
RNA nonamer was constructed using the Swiss-Model
programs [70]. The final merged files was presented and
annotated with Swiss Pdb Viewer 3.7 and Rastop 2.2.
