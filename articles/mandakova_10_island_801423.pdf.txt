Island species radiation and karyotypic stasis in
Pachycladon allopolyploids
Terezie Mandáková1, Peter B Heenan2, Martin A Lysak1*

Abstract
Background: Pachycladon (Brassicaceae, tribe Camelineae) is a monophyletic genus of ten morphologically and
ecogeographically differentiated, and presumably allopolyploid species occurring in the South Island of New
Zealand and in Tasmania. All Pachycladon species possess ten chromosome pairs (2n = 20). The feasibility of
comparative chromosome painting (CCP) in crucifer species allows the origin and genome evolution in this genus
to be elucidated. We focus on the origin and genome evolution of Pachycladon as well as on its genomic
relationship to other crucifer species, particularly to the allopolyploid Australian Camelineae taxa. As species
radiation on islands is usually characterized by chromosomal stasis, i.e. uniformity of chromosome numbers/ploidy
levels, the role of major karyotypic reshuffling during the island adaptive and species radiation in Pachycladon is
investigated through whole-genome CCP analysis.
Results: The four analyzed Pachycladon species possess an identical karyotype structure. The consensual ancestral
karyotype is most likely common to all Pachycladon species and corroborates the monophyletic origin of the
genus evidenced by previous phylogenetic analyses. The ancestral Pachycladon karyotype (n = 10) originated
through an allopolyploidization event between two genomes structurally resembling the Ancestral Crucifer
Karyotype (ACK, n = 8). The primary allopolyploid (apparently with n = 16) has undergone genome reshuffling by
descending dysploidy toward n = 10. Chromosome “fusions” were mediated by inversions, translocations and
centromere inactivation/loss. Pachycladon chromosome 3 (PC3) resulted from insertional fusion, described in
grasses. The allopolyploid ancestor originated in Australia, from the same or closely related ACK-like parental
species as the Australian Camelineae allopolyploids. However, the two whole-genome duplication (WGD) events
were independent, with the Pachycladon WGD being significantly younger. The long-distance dispersal of the
diploidized Pachycladon ancestor to New Zealand was followed by the Pleistocene species radiation in alpine
habitats and characterized by karyotypic stasis.
Conclusions: Karyotypic stasis in Pachycladon suggests that the insular species radiation in this genus proceeded
through homoploid divergence rather than through species-specific gross chromosomal repatterning. The ancestral
Pachycladon genome originated in Australia through an allopolyploidization event involving two closely related
parental genomes, and spread to New Zealand by a long-distance dispersal. We argue that the chromosome
number decrease mediated by inter-genomic reshuffling (diploidization) could provide the Pachycladon
allopolyploid founder with an adaptive advantage to colonize montane/alpine habitats. The ancestral Pachycladon
karyotype remained stable during the Pleistocene adaptive radiation into ten different species.

Background
Multiple rounds of WGD events (both allopolyploidy
and autopolyploidy) cyclically increase the genetic diversity in vascular plants, and subsequently this is steadily

eroded by genomic fractionation toward diploid-like
genomes. Lineage-specific WGD events followed by genome repatterning and descending dysploidy toward
diploid-like genomes have been revealed in several
angiosperm groups and are probably best characterized
in grasses [1-5] and Brassicales [6-11]. Despite still scant
knowledge of the number and genealogical context
of ancient WGD episodes [12], c. 15% of speciation

events among extant angiosperms are associated with
polyploidy [13].
Polyploidy has also played a significant role in colonization and species radiation on islands. Multiple examples of long-distance dispersals of diploid progenitors or
polyploid founders followed by adaptive radiation are
documented on well-studied archipelagos (Canary
Islands, New Zealand, Hawaiian Islands) [14-17].
Remarkably, species radiation on islands is usually characterized by chromosomal stasis, i.e. uniformity of chromosome numbers/ploidy levels [15-17]. This means that
adaptive or species radiations proceed through homoploid divergence, rather than by changing the number of
linkage groups by dysploidy and/or polyploidy. The reasons for insular chromosomal stasis are most likely
complex and lineage-specific, albeit the young age of
radiating polyploid lines and the adaptive advantage of
successful polyploid founders and their descendants are
suspected as crucial factors. Although chromosomal stasis does not necessarily imply karyotypic stasis [17], only
a handful of reports deal with the evolution of whole
chromosome complements in island endemics. With the
exception of the Hawaiian silverswords (Asteraceae),
analyzed through inter-species crossing experiments and
meiotic chromosome pairing configurations [18], none
of the homoploid species complexes on islands has been
analyzed for whole-genome collinearity.
The genus Pachycladon (Brassicaceae) comprises nine
morphologically and ecologically diverse species in
mainly alpine habitats of the South Island of New Zealand, and a single species occurs in alpine habitats in
Tasmania [19,20]. The morphology of Pachycladon is so
diverse that prior to the genus being recircumscribed by
[21], species were also placed in Cheesemania and Ischnocarpus. Pachycladon is monophyletic [21-23], characterized by little genetic variation amongst species at a
variety of genetic loci [24], and the species are interfertile [25,26]. Furthermore, six Pachycladon species analyzed karyologically all have the same chromosome
number of 2n = 20 [27,28] and comparable genome
sizes (430 to 550 Mb [26,28]). Pachycladon is related to
Arabidopsis [21,23], with both these genera belonging to
the polyphyletic tribe Camelineae [29,30]. The close
relationship between these genera is underlined by the
generation of a sexually derived intergeneric hybrid
between A. thaliana and P. cheesemanii [31].
Based on chromosome counts and preliminary cytogenetic data, Pachycladon species were thought to have a
polyploid origin (M. Lysak and P. Heenan, unpublished
results). Indeed, an allopolyploid origin of the genus
during the Pleistocene between ~0.8 and 1.6 mya (million years ago) has been confirmed through identification of two paralogous copies of five single copy nuclear
genes [23]. Phylogenetic data of Joly et al. [23] suggested

Page 2 of 14

that one of the purported parents comes from the polyphyletic Camelineae or the genus Boechera (i.e. from
crucifer lineage I [29]), whereas the Brassica copy
from the crucifer lineage II. Our recent comparative
phylogenomic study of some allopolyploid Australian
Camelineae species (Ballantinia antipoda, 2n = 12;
Stenopetalum nutans, 2n = 8 and S. lineare, 2n = 10)
revealed their close phylogenetic affinity to Pachycladon
and other Camelineae taxa [10]. The ~6 to 9 million old
allopolyploid event in the ancestry of Australian genera
was found to be obscured by extensive chromosome
repaterrning leading to the extant diploid-like karyotypes (n = 4-6). Such concealed WGD episodes still
detectable by comparative genetic and cytogenetic analysis were classified as mesopolyploid [10]. Although both
recent studies [10,23] argued for an allopolyploid origin
of the New Zealand and Australian Camelineae genera,
the unknown genome structure of Pachycladon species
did not yet allow to elucidate the relationship between
the two polyploid Camelineae groups.
In the present paper comparative chromosome painting (CCP) has been applied to four Pachycladon species
(Pachycladon cheesemanii, P. enysii, P. exile, and
P. novae-zelandiae) that represent the morphological,
ecological and phylogenetic diversity of the genus
(Figure 1 and [21]), and for which genetic maps are not
available. Pachycladon enysii is a monocarpic, lanceolate
and serrate-leaved, stout terminal inflorescence species
of high altitude (975-2492 m) alpine greywacke rock;
P. novae-zelandiae is a polycarpic, lobed-leaved, lateral
inflorescence species of mid-altitude (1080-2031 m)

alpine schist rock; and P. chessemanii and P. exile are
polycarpic, heterophyllous, slender terminal inflorescence
and generalist species of high fertility rock such as limestone, schist, and volcanics and occur from near sea-level
to the alpine zone (10-1600 m altitude) [19]. We used
CCP to study the extent of chromosome collinearity
between the ten chromosomes of Pachycladon species
and the eight chromosomes of the theoretical Ancestral
Crucifer Karyotype (ACK [32,33]). Combining comparative cytogenetic data with already published accounts on
phylogenetics, biogeography, and ecology of the genus we
addressed (i) genome structure and evolution of Pachycladon species, (ii) the genome relationship to other crucifer species, particularly to the endemic Australian
Camelineae taxa, and (iii) the role of major karyotypic
reshuffling in the species radiation in the island setting.

Evolution of the ten Pachycladon chromosomes

Results

PC3 chromosome

Comparative structure of Pachycladon karyotypes

(Figure 4B). The origin of PC3 can be reconstructed as a
paracentric inversion of the block D on AK2 followed by
nested “fusion” of this chromosome into the (peri)centromere of AK3. The nested “fusion” required three or
four breakpoints: two at the chromosome termini of
AK2 and one or two at the centromere of AK3. One
breakpoint would presumably disrupt the AK3 centromere, whereas two breaks at pericentromeric regions of
the opposite arms would yield a dispensable minichromosome as a second translocation product.

The karyotype structure of four Pachycladon species (P.
cheesemanii, P. enysii, P. exile, and P. novae-zelandiae)
has been reconstructed by comparative chromosome
painting (CCP) (Figure 2). Considering the close phylogenetic relationship between Pachycladon and Arabidopsis [21,23], we assumed that both genera descended
from the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (ACK) with eight
ancestral chromosomes AK1 to AK8 [32,33]. Hence A.
thaliana BAC clones and contigs corresponding to the
24 conserved genomic blocks (GBs) of the ACK were
used as painting probes to identify collinear chromosome regions in Pachycladon species. The four
reconstructed karyotypes showed overall similarity, comprising seven (sub)metacentric (PC1, PC3, PC4, PC6 PC8, and PC10) and three acrocentric (PC2, PC5, and
PC9) chromosomes with the identical arrangement of
ancestral GBs (Figure 3). The structural uniformity of all
reconstructed karyotypes suggests that this structure is
the ancestral Pachycladon karyotype.
All 24 GBs were found to be duplicated within the
analyzed pachytene complements displaying regular
meiotic pairing (Figure 2 and 3). The Pachycladon karyotype comprises one AK chromosome (PC7), seven
AK-like chromosomes discernible within the composite
Pachycladon chromosomes (four chromosomes modified
by inversions), and 14 AK-like chromosome arms
(Figure 3 and Table 1). Thus, in total forty-three ancestral GBs (90%) remained intact and only five blocks
were split within one chromosome arm (block L on
PC5), between two arms of the same chromosome (W
on PC6), or between two different chromosomes (D to
PC1 and PC2, J to PC9 and PC10, R to PC4 and PC5).
Except chromosome PC7 resembling chromosome AK7,
all Pachycladon chromosomes originated through
“fusion” of two or three AK chromosomes (Figure 3).

We have reconstructed the origin of the nine “fusion”
chromosomes of the ancestral Pachycladon karyotype
using the minimal number of rearrangements and
assuming that the ten PC chromosomes originated from
the duplicated ACK (i.e. from 16 AK chromosomes).
PC1 and PC2 chromosomes

(Figure 4A). PC1 originated via a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes AK1 and AK2 with breakpoints in the (peri)centromeric region of AK1 (close to
block B) and in the block D of AK2. The second translocation product harbouring the AK1 centromere has
been involved in a subsequent reciprocal end-to-end
translocation with AK5, resulting in chromosome PC2.
As the four GBs (K-N) of AK5 have the ancestral position within PC2 chromosome, we infer an inactivation
and/or loss of the AK5 centromere.

PC4 and PC5 chromosomes

(Figure 4C). PC4 and PC5 were generated through the
reshuffling of ancestral chromosomes AK4 and AK6,
and AK4, AK5 and AK6, respectively. A pericentric
inversion (GBs O and P) transforming AK6 into a telocentric chromosome was followed by a reciprocal translocation between this chromosome and AK4. This
translocation joined the long arm of AK4 (block J) with
the AK6 telocentric (= PC4). The AK4-derived telocentric chromosome comprising only the centromere
and block I has undergone a reciprocal end-to-end
translocation with AK5. As the GB collinearity around
the AK5 centromere between blocks L and M remained
conserved, we inferred an inactivation and/or loss of
this centromere on PC5. A small reciprocal translocation between the bottom arm of PC4 (block R) and the
upper arm of PC5 occurred after the major reshuffling
steps. A paracentric inversion between GBs K and L on
PC5 could have occured before the origin of both PC
chromosomes or it is a later event.
PC6 chromosome

(Figure 4D). This chromosome most likely originated via
a reciprocal end-to-end translocation between AK6 and
AK8 and was probably followed by a concurrent or subsequent inactivation and/or loss of the AK8 centromere,
reflected by the ancestral position of blocks V and Wa

on PC6. This event was followed by a pericentric inversion with breakpoints in the (peri)centromeric region
(close to block Q) and within block W.
PC8 chromosome

(Figure 4E). PC8 originated via a reciprocal translocation
between AK7 and AK8, yielding the fusion PC8 chromosome and a meiotically unstable minichromosome
containing the centromere of AK8. The translocation
was preceded by a paracentric inversion on AK7 (block
S) and pericentric inversion on AK8 (block V).
PC9 and PC10 chromosomes

(Figure 4F). Chromosome PC9 originated through a
reciprocal translocation between AK1 and AK4 with
breakpoints in the AK1 pericentromere (close to block
B) and the proximal part of the bottom arm of AK4
(block J). The second translocation product (GBs C and
Jb, and the AK1 centromere) participated in a reciprocal
end-to-end translocation with AK3 which resulted in
the origin of PC10 and small acentric fragment. Ancestral arrangement of AK3-derived GBs suggests that the
AK3 centromere has been lost or inactivated.
The reconstructed chromosome origins are congruent
with the reduction of 16 ancestral chromosomes (centromeres) to only 10 in Pachycladon. Centromeres of
both homeologues of AK1, AK2, AK4, AK6 and AK7
remained functional, whereas six centromeres were lost
(Figure 3). The centromere of one AK3 homeologue was
eliminated due to the nested chromosome fusion, one
AK8 centromere was eliminated via symmetric translocation, and both AK5 centromeres and centromeres of
second homeologues of AK3 and AK8 were inactivated/
lost (Figure 4).
Out of the 33 breakpoints inferred for the origin of
ten Pachycladon chromosomes, 12 (36%) map to pericentromeric regions, 16 (49%) to telomeric regions,
whereas only five (15%) occurred within GBs (Figure 4A
to 4F).

Chromosome landmarks (heterochromatin, telomeres and
rDNA)

We have analyzed mitotic and pachytene chromosome
complements of the four Pachycladon species for the
distribution of heterochromatin domains, localization of
ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) and the Arabidopsis-type
telomere repeat (Figure 5). Except for prominent heterochromatin of pericentromeres and terminal nucleolus
organizing regions (NORs) (Figure 2), a single heterochromatic knob occurs in P. enysii and two knobs were
found in P. exile. Whereas two of the three knobs reside
within genomic blocks (B on PC1 in P. enysii, U on PC7
in P. exile), the knob on the bottom arm of PC10 in P.
exile is localized between blocks G and H, i.e. at the site
of presumably inactivated centromere of AK3 (Figure
4F). No heterochromatic domains were observed at the
sites of other presumably inactivated and/or lost paleocentromeres. The telomere (TTTAGGG)n repeat hybridized only to chromosome ends and no interstitial
telomeric signals were observed (data not shown).
Whereas the four species have a single 5S rDNA locus
at the same position, the number of terminal 45S rDNA
loci varies. P. novae-zelandiae has one, P. cheesemanii
and P. exile possess two, and P. enysii has three 45S
rDNA loci, with 45S locus on the upper arm of PC2
being common to all species (Figure 5). Thus, the crossspecies karyotypic stasis does not apply to the number
of terminal 45S rDNA loci.

Discussion
We have used comparative chromosome painting to
reconstruct karyotype structure and evolution in the
genus Pachycladon. Interestingly, our analysis showed
that the four analyzed species representing the phylogenetic, ecological and morphological diversity of the
genus possess an identical karyotype, which is also most
likely to be the ancestral karyotype of the genus
Pachycladon.
Chromosomal and karyotypic stasis in Pachycladon

The present study of four Pachycladon species is the
first whole-genome analysis of an island species radiation. Pachycladon species have uniformly ten chromosomes [27,28] and this infrageneric chromosomal stasis
has been now extended for karyotypic stasis. Overall
similar genome structures supported the monophyletic
origin of the genus [21-23] and allowed inference of the
ancestral Pachycladon karyotype whose structure
remained conserved in the extant species. Karyotypic
stasis revealed in Pachycladon clearly indicates that the
Pleistocene species radiation on the South Island of
New Zealand [19] was not associated with major chromosome rearrangements. The four karyotypes differ
only by the number of heterochromatic knobs and

NORs, without an apparent link to infrageneric phylogenetic relationships (Figure 1). Hence, the speciation proceeded through homoploid divergence from the
ancestral allopolyploid genome.
Perhaps with the exception of meiotic studies in the
Hawaiian silversword alliance [18] there is virtually no
data on karyotype evolution during island angiosperm
speciation. Hence, only the variation in chromosome
number/ploidy level can be discussed more extensively.
Several surveys of angiosperm chromosome numbers
showed the trend of chromosomal stasis during species
radiation on islands (see reviews by [15-17]). This tendency might appear paradoxical considering geographical isolation and a wealth of diverse insular
environments potentially promoting the origin of novel
chromosomal races and karyotypes. However, genomes
diverging on islands are under multiple constraints
determining chromosomal stasis or chromosomal variation. As self-evident factors influencing the insular species radiation and genomic stability are the age of
islands and their distance from the mainland, the number of colonization events, the incidence of polyploidy
and phylogenetic constraints. Colonizations followed by
adaptive radiation on (volcanic) islands represent often
relatively young evolutionary events and therefore many
island endemics represent monophyletic lineages comprising closely related species with uniform chromosome
numbers. Furthermore, it was concluded that chromosomal stasis vs. lability is under a strong phylogenetic constraint as some lineages (e.g. Asteraceae, Sideritis) seem
to be more prone to genome reshuffling than others
[15,16,34].
Generally the low incidence of polyploidy has been
claimed for island floras [16]. These estimates collated
prior to the era of indepth whole-genome analyses
revealing multiple whole-genome duplications of a different age (e.g., [7,12,10]) had to be, by definition, too
conservative. Recent studies suggest that colonization of
islands has been frequently associated with hybridization
and allopolyploidy (see [35,36] for examples). Allopolyploid ancestors originated either on continents and
spread to islands (e.g. the allopolyploid ancestor of the

Page 8 of 14

Hawaiian mints [37]) or diploid ancestors hybridize in
situ after long-distance dispersal (e.g. the New Zealand
and Australian Lepidium species [38]). The allopolyploidy-driven speciation on islands is frequently associated with chromosomal stasis as shown for the
Hawaiian flora with the high incidence of polyploidy (>
80% [15]).
Polyploidy is also a pronounced feature of the New
Zealand flora, with 72% of the species being polyploid in
families with 25 or more species [39]. Chromosomal features of New Zealand plants indicative of polyploidy are
the high number of species with even haploid numbers
and/or haploid numbers n = > 10-14 [40]. Many of the
polyploid genera that are like Pachycladon exhibiting
chromosomal stasis are species-rich and generally considered to be recent species radiations, often into mainly
alpine-montane habitats. They include, for example, Aciphylla (42 species, 2n = 22), Brachyglottis (30 species,
2n = 60), Chionochloa (22 species, 2n = 42), Gentianella
(40 species, 2n = 36), Epilobium (38 species, 2n = 36),
and Ourisia (20 species, 2n = 48) (data from [27]).
Chromosomal stasis is also observed in the few crucifer genera that have species radiations on islands. All
seven Parolinia species endemic to the Canary Islands
probably have 2n = 22 (4 species counted [41]), and
seven shrubby species of Descurainia endemic to the
Canary Islands share 2n = 14 [42]. Similarly, of nine
Diplotaxis species in the Cape Verde Islands, five have
2n = 26 [43]. Unfortunately, insufficient chromosomal
data are available for c. 40 Cardamine species endemic
to New Zealand (P. Heenan, unpublished data) as well
as for most crucifer genera endemic to Australia [41,44].
Pachycladon karyotype is derived from the duplicated
Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype

Our data suggest that the ancestral Pachycladon karyotype (n = 10) was derived from the duplicated Ancestral
Crucifer Karyotype (n = 8) through allopolyploidy. The
ACK was expected to be inferred as an ancestral genome of Pachycladon, as all of the Camelineae genomes
analyzed thus far have descended from the ACK (for
instance, Arabidopsis, Capsella, Turritis, and Neslia
[32,45,46], including the analyzed Australian Camelineae
species [10]). Furthermore, the karyotypes of Crucihimalaya and Transberingia, two genera often found as being
the closest relatives of Pachycladon [21,23], resemble the
ACK structure [10]. Similarly, the ACK was proposed as
an ancestral karyotype for tribes Boechereae and Cardamineae [[47], Mandáková and Lysak, unpublished data].
It is likely, therefore, that the ancestral Pachycladon
genome has been derived from the hybridization
between two ACK-like genomes. The primary allopolyploid had either the structure of duplicated ACK with n
= 16 or the participating genome(s) were reduced (n = 8

Mandáková et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:367
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/367

® n = 7-5?) prior to the hybridization event and the
allopolyploid had less than 16 chromosome pairs. The
fact that paralogous genomic blocks do not lay on
the same chromosome suggests that the modern Pachycladon chromosomes were reshuffled prior to the hybridization event, rather than due to homeologous
recombination between two ACK-like genomes within
the allopolyploid ancestor.
The ten composite Pachycladon chromosomes originated through inversions, reciprocal translocations and
centromere inactivation/loss events within the duplicated ACK complement (Figure 4). Chromosome
“fusions” were mediated by reciprocal translocations
with or without preceding para- and pericentric
inversions. These translocations yielded a “fusion” chromosome and (a)centric fragment as the second translocation product. Small acentric fragments and the
minichromosome harbouring one AK8 centromere were
meiotically unstable and eliminated. Whereas Robertsonian-like translocations eliminating one AK centromere
together with the minichromosome is a common
mechanism of the karyotype evolution in Brassicaceae
[32,48,49], asymmetric translocation events yielding
miniature acentric fragments and dicentric chromosomes with one AK centromere apparently inactivated
or removed by recombination were proposed for the
origin of composite chromosomes in the Australian
Camelineae species [10]. Centromere inactivation and/or
loss has been inferred on bottom (long) arms of four
Pachycladon chromosomes (PC2, PC5, PC6, and PC10)
based on the absence of ancestral centromeres and conserved organization of adjacent genomic blocks (Figure
3 and 4). The incidence of centromere inactivation in
Australian and New Zealand Camelineae species might
be tentatively related to the common ancestry of both
lineages and/or to the duplicated character of the allopolyploid ancestral genomes. Centromere inactivation of
AK4 can also be suggested for the origin of chromosome At2 in A. thaliana [32], and centromere inactivation of AK5 for the origin of Bst5 in Boechera stricta
[47] and chromosome AK4/5 in Neslia paniculata [32].
Nevertheless, an alternative mechanism of centromere
removal through subsequent paracentric and pericentric
inversions followed by a symmetric translocation (Figure
2C in [32]) is also plausible, though more breakpoints
have to be considered. A dicentric chromosome could
also be stabilized by intrachromosomal translocation,
with breakpoints in pericentromeric region of one of the
ancestral centromeres, followed by a loss of the resulting
centric fragment.
Chromosome PC3 originated probably through a
nested “fusion” of chromosome AK2 between chromosome arms of AK3. As both AK chromosomes within
PC3 possess the ancestral structure of genomic blocks

Page 9 of 14

(except inverted block D) translocation events with
breakpoints at chromosome termini of AK2 and centromere of AK3 seems to be the parsimonious scenario. In
grasses (Poaceae), insertional chromosome “fusion” has
been proposed as a general mechanism of descending
dysploidy [4,50], whereas in crucifers it can be suggested
only for the origin of chromosome AK2/5 in Hornungia
alpina [32]. Thus, Pachycladon chromosome PC3 is
most likely the first instance of reconstructed insertional
dysploidy in Brassicaceae. An alternative mechanism of
the PC3 origin via end-to-end reciprocal translocation
coupled with the elimination of the AK3 centromere
requires two more breakpoints.
Common origin of Pachycladon and Australian
Camelineae species?

Based on the phylogenetic analysis of Australian Camelineae taxa and Pachycladon species, [10] concluded that
both groups might originate from a very similar allopolyploid ancestor. Although the authors could not reject a
single origin of both lineages, they considered two successive allopolyploidization events as more likely, i.e. mesopolyploid Australian Camelineae species originated and
radiated in continental arid habitats before the mesopolyploid ancestor of Pachycladon. The present data corroborate this conclusion. Specifically, the two species groups
do not share any cytogenetic signature, i.e. a taxon/lineage-specific chromosome rearrangement, such as the rearranged AK8 homeologue shared by five Australian species
analyzed [10]. In the Australian species, any two paralogous GBs differ by the length and fluorescence intensity as
revealed by CCP [10]. This difference was either present
already in the hybridizing progenitors or was caused by
preferential fractionation of paralogous regions belonging
to only one subgenome [51]. In Pachycladon, two paralogous copies of all GBs cannot be distinguished upon CCP
analysis. Furthermore, higher chromosome number
in Pachycladon species (n = 10) than in the Australian
species (n = 4-7) implies a more recent origin and less
extensive diploidization in Pachycladon. Indeed, the significantly lower number of non-ancestral junctions of genomic blocks in Pachycladon compared to Ballantinia
antipoda and the two Stenopetalum species (Table 1 and
[10]) underlines the less extensive genome reshuffling in
Pachycladon. Also the number of split GBs in Pachycladon
(10%) is lower than in the Australian species (13% to 19%;
[10]). Interestingly, both groups do not differ substantially
by the number of preserved AK chromosomes, chromosome arms and GBs (Table 1). This comparison suggests
that the most recent steps of chromosome number reduction in the Australian Camelineae species have been
mediated by tandem end-to-end translocations followed
by centromere inactivation/loss, not disrupting the structure of AK-like chromosomes and chromosome arms.

Mandáková et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:367
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/367

Altogether, the differences in genome structure
between the mesopolyploid Australian and New Zealand
lineage indicate two successive WGD events involving
the same pool of parental species. The existence of the
progenitor species in Australia for a long period of time
is a credible assumption considering the remarkable stasis of the ACK and AK chromosomes across crucifer
lineages I and II [32,33,49]. Further research is needed
to elucidate if the ancient ACK-like karyotype could be
found in some not yet analyzed Australian crucifer species. Recurrent formation of allopolyploids from the
same or closely related parents has been documented, e.
g. in the North American allopolyploid species of Tragopogon [52], in Persicaria [53] or Arabidopsis kamchatica
[54], and also proven by the generating synthetic allopolyploids as Arabidopsis suecica [55], tobacco [56] or
Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus [57].
Although less likely, we cannot rule out that karyotypic change in the Australian Camelineae species and in
Pachycladon had significantly different dynamics. The
Australian Brassicaceae species exhibit a predominantly
annual growth habit [44] in comparison to the perennial
Pachycladon [21], and a more rapid rate of genome evolution could therefore be brought about with faster
nucleotide substitution rates that occur in many annuals
[58,59]. Perennials are thought to have greater chromosomal stasis than annuals [60,61]. Certainly the annuality could have accelerated genome reshuffling in the
Australian lineage. However, for Brassicaceae we have
insufficient data on large-scale genome evolution in relation to the life forms, reproduction systems and ecological factors, and as noted by [15] and [62] chromosomal
evolution is often stochastic and does not obey the
models.
Phylogeographic scenario of the origin of Pachycladon

Pachycladon is the only New Zealand genus from the
polyphyletic tribe Camelineae (other endemic crucifer
species belong to Cardamineae, Lepidieae, and Notothlaspideae), and therefore an in situ origin seems unlikely. The closest Camelineae relatives of Pachycladon
occur in Australia (e.g., Arabidella, Ballantinia, and Stenopetalum) and Eurasia/Beringia (e.g., Arabidopsis, Crucihimalaya, Transberingia) [10,23]. It seems more
plausible that the hybridization event giving rise to
Pachycladon has taken place on the Australian
continent.
There are strong taxonomic and biogeographic links
between Australia and New Zealand and dispersal across
the Tasman Sea can occur in both directions. Tasmania
and New Zealand have about 200 species in common
[63], and there are many genera in continental Australia
and New Zealand that have species that are closely
related (e.g., Aciphylla, Celmisia, Gentianella, Melicytus,

Page 10 of 14

and Ranunculus). For these shared genera, species diversity is often highest in New Zealand and the Australian
species are considered to be the result of westward dispersal from New Zealand and subsequent speciation
(e.g. [64,65]). Indeed, P. radicatum occurs in the Tasmanian mountains and is considered to have dispersed
there and diverged contemporaneously with the radiation of Pachycladon in New Zealand [21,22]. Other taxa
are also shared between the two countries, but these are
considered to have dispersed eastward from Australia to
New Zealand and include, for example, Craspedia [66],
Montigena [67], Poranthera [68], Scleranthus [69], and
Stylidiaceae [70]. This pattern of eastward dispersal
means it is plausible that Pachycladon could have originated in Australia and then subsequently dispersed to
New Zealand.
An alternative scenario of the origin of the Pachycladon allopolyploid ancestor in (eastern) Eurasia followed
by a later dispersal to New Zealand is unlikely and
incongruent with the close phylogenetic ties of Pachycladon to Australian Camelineae. Also, the origin of
Pachycladon and Australian crucifer species in New
Zealand is very unlikely, considering the diversity of
endemic Australian Brassicaceae taxa (15 genera and 65
species [44]).
Many of the Australian Camelineae are distributed in
the arid Eremaean Zone and/or the southeastern temperate biome [44], whereas in New Zealand Pachycladon
mainly occupies montane-alpine habitats. These three
environments have expanded in both Australia and New
Zealand during the Pliocene and Pleistocene and are
generally considered important drivers of species radiations (e.g. [71,72]). For the Australian Camelineae their
origin and diversification ~6 to 9 mya [10] is consistent
with other dated molecular phylogenies of a diverse
range of arid-adapted taxa [73]. These dated phylogenies
show the deepest divergences of taxa are consistent with
the beginning of the formation of the arid zone in the
mid-Miocene and that most arid-zone species lineages
date to the Pliocene or earlier. The molecular clock date
of 0.8 to 1.6 mya for the origin of Pachycladon [23] is
also consistent with its alpine distribution and habitats
in the Southern Alps in the South Island of New Zealand [19]. Uplift of the Southern Alps occurred over the
last 8 million years, but only reached a suitable height
to permanently support alpine plants during the
Pleistocene.
Reconstructed genome evolution corroborates the close
relationship of Pachycladon to Arabidopsis and other
Camelineae species

The phylogenetic position of Pachycladon has been
investigated repeatedly using various nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes [10,21,23]. All studies are

Mandáková et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:367
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/367

congruent in placing the genus into the crucifer lineage
I, within the polyphyletic tribe Camelineae [21,29,30,74].
Although the phylogenetic relationships within Camelineae are unclear, these studies have shown Transberingia and Crucihimalaya (Camelineae), Sphaerocardamum
(Halimolobeae), Physaria (Physarieae), and Boechera
(Boechereae) to be among the closest relatives of Pachycladon. Based on the analysis of five single-copy nuclear
genes, [23] showed that Pachycladon has an allopolyploid origin and that the two genomes were associated
with two divergent Brassicaceae lineages (lineage I and
II [29,75]). One putative parental genome was associated
with Camelineae sensu lato (and Boechereae) and the
second genome being related to Brassiceae, Sisymbrium,
Eutremeae, Thlaspideae, and remarkably also to Cardamineae on the chalcone synthase gene tree. This pattern
has been interpreted as the evidence of an inter-tribal
allopolyploidization event at the origin of Pachycladon.
A recent study using nuclear, mitochondrial and
chloroplast genes, as well as significantly increasing the
sampling of Australian Camelineae (in comparison to
that of [23]), has confirmed the allopolyploid origin of
Pachycladon and provides confidence that the two gene
paralogues that constitute Pachycladon are derived from
within lineage I [10]. Most importantly, this study has
disclosed the close relationship of Pachycladon to the
Australian genera Arabidella, Ballantinia, and Stenopetalum, and the maternal gene paralogues of Pachycladon
and these three genera clustered with Eurasian Camelineae (Arabidopsis, Capsella, Crucihimalaya, Olimarabidopsis, Transberingia) and North American Boechereae.
The position of the paternal gene copy was less evident,
but it was always embedded within lineage I, and therefore different from the study by [23]. Mandakova et al.
[10] and the present study convincingly show that the
Pachycladon ancestor orginated from hybridization
between a Camelineae species and either another species
of that tribe or a very closely related tribe of lineage I.
Future phylogenomic analyses of other Australian crucifer genera are likely to further resolve the parentage and
phylogenetic relationships of Pachycladon.

Conclusion
We have shown that the remarkable infrageneric morphological and ecological differentiation in Pachycladon
is characterized by the genome stability manifested as
chromosomal and karyotypic stasis. The monophyletic
Pachycladon species descended from a common allopolyploid ancestor (n = 10) through a whole-genome
duplication of the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype (n = 8)
and subsequent diploidization by descending dysploidy.
Furthermore, the present study and the phylogenetic
data of [10] clearly demonstrate the close relationship between the allopolyploid Pachycladon and the

Page 11 of 14

allopolyploid Australian Camelineae taxa. CCP data
demonstrate that both mesopolyploid groups most likely
originated from two different WGD events that involved
identical or very similar diploid parents. We argue that
the Pachycladon ancestor has its origin in Australia and
later dispersed to the South Island of New Zealand. The
endemic Australian and New Zealand Camelineae provide an excellent framework to examine the nature and
consequences of differently-aged WGD events within a
complex of closely related species.

Methods
Plant material

The four species of Pachycladon included in this study
represent the morphological and ecological diversity of
the genus [19]. Plants were cultivated in a glasshouse at
Landcare Research, Lincoln, New Zealand. All species
have known wild origins: P. cheesemanii (Bobs Cove,
Queenstown, Otago; 168°37’E, 47°08’S), P. enysii (Mount
Potts, Canterbury; 170°55’E, 43°30’S), P. exile (Awahokomo, Otago; 170°23E, 44°42’S), and P. novae-zelandiae
(Old Man Range, Otago; 169°12’E, 45°20’S).
Chromosome preparation

Entire inflorescences were fixed in ethanol:acetic acid
(3:1) fixative overnight and stored in 70% ethanol at -20°
C until use. Selected flower buds were rinsed in distilled
water and citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.8)
and incubated in an enzyme mix (0.3% cellulase, cytohelicase, and pectolyase; all Sigma) in citrate buffer at 37°C
for 3 h. Individual flower buds were disintegrated on a
microscopic slide by a needle in a drop of citrate buffer
and the suspension softened by adding 20 μL of 60%
acetic acid. The suspension was spread on a hot plate at
50°C for ~0.5 min. Chromosomes were fixed by adding
of ethanol:acetic acid (3:1, 100 μL) and dried with a hair
dryer. Suitable slides were postfixed in 4% formaldehyde
in distilled water for 10 min and air-dried.
DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

For CCP in P. exile, on average each third Arabidopsis
thaliana BAC clone was used to establish contigs corresponding to the 24 genomic blocks of the ACK [33]. For
the detail composition of the BAC contigs see [49].
After initial CCP experiments in P. exile, some BAC
contigs were split into smaller subcontigs to pinpoint
rearrangement of ancestral blocks. (Sub)conting characterizing chromosome rearrangements in P. exile were
used as CCP probes to reconstruct karyotypes of
P. cheesemanii, P. enysii and P. novae-zelandiae. The
A. thaliana BAC clone T15P10 (AF167571) containing
45 S rRNA genes was used for in situ localization of
NORs, and A. thaliana clone pCT4.2 (M65137), corresponding to a 500-bp 5 S rRNA repeat, was used for

Mandáková et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:367

localization of 5 S rDNA loci. The Arabidopsis-type telomere repeat (TTTAGGG)n was prepared according to
[76]. All DNA probes were labeled with biotin-dUTP,
digoxigenin-dUTP, or Cy3- dUTP by nick translation as
described by [49].

FISH

To remove cytoplasm prior to FISH, the slides were
treated with pepsin (0.1 mg/mL; Sigma) in 0.01 M HCl
for 10 min, postfixed in 4% formaldehyde in 2× SSC (1×
SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) for 10
min, and dehydrated in an ethanol series (70, 80, and
96%). Selected BAC clones were pooled and ethanol
precipitated. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μL of
hybridization mix (50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate in 2× SSC) per slide. The probe and chromosomes
were denatured together on a hot plate at 80°C for 2
min and incubated in a moist chamber at 37°C overnight. Posthybridization washing was performed in 20%
formamide in 2× SSC at 42°C. Detection of was as
described by [49]. Chromosomes were counterstained
with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/mL) in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence signals were
analyzed with an Olympus BX-61 epifluorescence
microscope and AxioCam CCD camera (Zeiss). Images
were acquired separately for all four fluorochromes
using appropriate excitation and emission filters (AHF
Analysentechnik). The four monochromatic images were
pseudocolored and merged using the Adobe Photoshop
CS2 software (Adobe Systems). Pachytene chromosomes
in Figure 2 were straightened using the plugin
‘Straighten Curved Objects’ [77] in ImageJ program
(National Institutes of Health).
