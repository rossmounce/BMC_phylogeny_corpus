Abstract
Background: Subtilisin-like serine proteases play an important role in pathogenic fungi during the penetration and
colonization of their hosts. In this study, we perform an evolutionary analysis of the subtilisin-like serine protease
genes of subphylum Pezizomycotina to find if there are similar pathogenic mechanisms among the pathogenic
fungi with different life styles, which utilize subtilisin-like serine proteases as virulence factors. Within
Pezizomycotina, nematode-trapping fungi are unique because they capture soil nematodes using specialized
trapping devices. Increasing evidence suggests subtilisin-like serine proteases from nematode-trapping fungi are
involved in the penetration and digestion of nematode cuticles. Here we also conduct positive selection analysis
on the subtilisin-like serine protease genes from nematode-trapping fungi.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of 189 subtilisin-like serine protease genes from Pezizomycotina suggests five
strongly-supported monophyletic clades. The subtilisin-like serine protease genes previously identified or presumed
as endocellular proteases were clustered into one clade and diverged the earliest in the phylogeny. In addition, the
cuticle-degrading protease genes from entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic fungi were clustered together,
indicating that they might have overlapping pathogenic mechanisms against insects and nematodes. Our
experimental bioassays supported this conclusion. Interestingly, although they both function as cuticle-degrading
proteases, the subtilisin-like serine protease genes from nematode-trapping fungi and nematode-parasitic fungi
were not grouped together in the phylogenetic tree. Our evolutionary analysis revealed evidence for positive
selection on the subtilisin-like serine protease genes of the nematode-trapping fungi.
Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the evolution of subtilisin-like serine protease genes in
Pezizomycotina. Pezizomycotina subtilisins most likely evolved from endocellular to extracellular proteases. The
entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic fungi likely share similar properties in parasitism. In addition, our data
provided better understanding about the duplications and subsequent functional divergence of subtilisin-like serine
protease genes in Pezizomycotina. The evidence of positive selection detected in the subtilisin-like serine protease
genes of nematode-trapping fungi in the present study suggests that the subtilisin-like serine proteases may have
played important roles during the evolution of pathogenicity of nematode-trapping fungi against nematodes.

Background
Subtilisin-like serine proteases play an important role in
the pathogenicity of pathogenic fungi. By using subtilisin-like serine proteases, pathogenic fungi disrupt the
physiological integrity of the hosts during penetration
and colonization [1,2]. Previous studies have suggested

that pathogenic fungi with different life styles utilize
subtilisin-like serine proteases as their virulence factor
[2-5]. Investigations into the similarities and differences
of pathogenic mechanisms among these pathogenic
fungi will significantly enhance our understanding of the
evolution of these genes.
Pezizomycotina, the largest subphylum of Ascomycota,
includes all filamentous, sporocarp-producing species.
These organisms have diverse ecological niches and life
styles [6]. A recent study based on six nuclear genes
divided Pezizomycotina into nine major clades [7].

Among them, nematode-trapping fungi, which are
conidial anamorphs of Orbiliomycetes and belong to
nematophagous fungi, are unique because they capture
free-livingsoil nematodes using trapping devices
(e.g. adhesive networks, constricting rings, adhesive columns, adhesive knobs and nonconstricting rings) [8,9].
In contrast, nematode-parasitic fungi, another group of
nematophagous fungi within Pezizomycotina, infect
nematodes mainly using extracellular enzymes (subtilisin-like serine protease, chitinase and etc.) [2,10]. Previous studies have suggested that subtilisin-like serine
proteases are involved in the penetration and the digestion of nematode cuticles [11-23]. However, only limited
studies have been done on the evolutionary pattern of
subtilisin-like serine protease genes in nematode-trapping fungi so far [10,11,17]. In view of this, we here
newly determined five subtilisin-like serine protease
genes from the nematode-trapping fungi. In conjunction
with the other Pezizomycotina sequences obtained from
previous studies and extensive database searching of
available genome assembly, we perform the most comprehensive investigation to date of subtilisin-like serine
protease genes in Pezizomycotina.

Results
New subtilisin-like serine protease genes from nematodetrapping fungi

Table 1 summarizes the sequence characterizations of
newly determined subtilisin-like serine protease genes
from five nematode-trapping fungi. The five sequences
range from 1176-bp to 1288-bp in length and all contain
an intron. The encoding genes of these five subtilisinlike serine proteases have been submitted to GenBank
(Accession nos. EF113088 - EF113092).
Generally, the subtilisin-like serine proteases from
nematode-trapping fungi, together with those from
nematode-parasitic fungi and entomopathogenic fungi,
were classified as cuticle-degrading proteases because
they were involved in the penetration and digestion of
nematode or insect cuticles [11-23]. Our analyses indicated that the subtilisin-like serine protease genes from
nematode-trapping fungi shared a high degree of
sequence similarity to those from nematode-parasitic

fungi and entomopathogenic fungi. As seen from Figure
1, these subtilisin-like serine protease genes share a prepro-peptide structure. The signal peptides consisted of
15-21 amino acids. The potential catalytic triad residues
(His, Asp and Ser) and the substrate-binding S1 pocket
(Ser-Leu-Gly-Gly and Ala-Ala-Gly) were all conserved
among these sequences. Moreover, two cysteines which
contribute to the stability of the tertiary structure of
proteases [24] were also conserved.
Phylogenetic analyses

Using various tree-building methods, our phylogenetic
analyses based on a total of 189 subtilisin-like serine
protease genes using various tree-building methods consistently showed five strongly-supported monophyletic
clades. These clades are designated as A-E in the trees
(Figure 2; Additional files 1, 2 and 3).
Our phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) clustered the cuticledegrading protease genes from entomopathogenic and
nematode-parasitic fungi into clade A with the exclusion
of nematode-trapping fungi (BS = 81). The genes from
nematode-trapping fungi all grouped into clade D (BS =
99). Clade B contained the subtilisin-like serine protease
genes from fungi causing dermatosis in humans and animals. Clade E comprised sequences from four classes of
Pezizomycotina (Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes), as well as vacuolar
protease genes [5,25-28], indicating the possible endocellular origin of these proteases.
Although the inconsistent relationships among the five
clades were produced in our phylogenetic analyses, the
earliest divergence of Clade E was strongly supported in
all tree topologies (Figure 2; Additional files 1, 2 and 3).
The alternative tree topologies, in which Clade E was
not the basal clade in the phylogeny, were all found to
be significantly worse than our tree (P < 0.05).
Signatures of positive selection in the nematode-trapping
fungi

One of the intriguing findings in our study is evidence
of positive selection in the nematode-trapping fungi.

Figure 3 Phylogeny based on subtilisin-like serine protease genes from nematode-trapping fungi used for ML analysis in PAML and
Bn-Bs. Maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian tree reconstructions of the subtilisin-like serine
protease gene sequences of clade D presented similar overall topologies. The bootstrap values of each branch for different methodologies are
indicated (Bayesian/ML/NJ/MP). The symbol (*) indicates distinct topological arrangements. The thick branches indicate the branch with a
significant LRT in the PAML branch analysis. After calculation using Bn-Bs, only branch f (Z = 3.66320) was significant.

of the subtilisin-like serine protease genes of nematodetrapping fungi presented similar overall topologies
(Figure 3). Six branches (designated as a-f) showed signs
of significant positive selection in all four tree topologies
(Figure 3; Additional file 4). After Bonferroni correction
for multiple testing, we found that likelihood ratio tests
(LRT) were still significant in three branches (branch b,
e and f) in all tree topologies (Figure 3; Additional file
4). Several positively selected residues were also identified for these branches with high posterior probabilities
(see Additional file 4). Bonferroni correction in PAML
analyses may be insufficient because this correction
lacks statistical power [29]. We also measured the patterns of selection pressures among nematode-trapping
fungal genes using the Bn-Bs program, a relatively conservative method. The analysis using the Bn-Bs program
also revealed that dN was significantly greater than dS

for branch f, the ancestor branch of nematode-trapping
fungi (Z = 3.66320; Figure 3).
In sum, the results showed for the first time that positive selection might have acted on the subtilisin-like serine protease genes in nematode-trapping fungi, at least
in the early stage of their evolution.
Functional Bioassays
The infection of insects and nematodes with
entomopathogenic fungi and nematode-parasitic fungi

One of the interesting results inferred from our phylogenetic analysis was the clustering of the cuticle-degrading
protease genes from entomopathogenic and nematodeparasitic fungi. This result suggested that entomopathogenic fungi might have nematode-parasitic activities,
and nematode-parasitic fungi might have entomopathogenic activities. To test this hypothesis, functional assays

were conducted to determine whether the nematodeparasitic fungi could infect insects, and whether the
entomopathogenic fungi could infect nematodes. Specifically, the entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic
fungi (Table 2) were tested on their potential to infect
the eggs of both the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne
sp. and the potato tuber moth Phthorimaea opercullella.
The phytopathogenic fungus Nigrospora oryzae was
used as the negative control.
Our bioassay result on the eggs of the root-knot
nematode Meloidogyne sp. indicated that all eight entomopathogenic or nematode-parasitic fungi could infect
the eggs of the root-knot nematode (Figure 4). As seen
from the histogram of Figure 4-II, the infection rate of
these eight fungi ranged from 73% to 100% after 1 week,
while the phytopathogenic fungus N. oryzae couldn’t
infect any egg.
The bioassay on the eggs of P. opercullella indicated
that all eight entomopathogenic or nematode-parasitic
fungi could infect the eggs of the potato tuber moth
(Figure 5). After 3 days of co-incubation, the juveniles
hatched from the eggs. Five days later, the infection
rates of the eight entomopathogenic or nematode-parasitic fungi were obtained and they ranged from 80% to
100% (Figure 5-II). For the negative control, all the
potato tuber moth eggs hatched into juveniles within 5
days (Figure 5-I-I).
In sum, our bioassay results indicated that entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic fungi could infect
both nematode and insect eggs, thus supporting the
inference from the phylogenetic analyses.
Effects of the subtilisin-like serine protease PSP-3 on the
nematode and insect eggs

Subtilisin-like serine proteases are known to play a key
role during penetration of nematode or insect cuticles
[2,10]. In the study of Bonants et al., the subtilisin-like
serine protease PSP-3 of nematode-parasitic fungus

Paecilomyces lilacinus was found to be involved in the
infection of P. lilacinus against the eggs of the root-knot
nematode Meloidogyne hapla [30].
Based on our bioassay results, we hypothesize that the
subtilisin-like serine proteases secreted by entomopathogenic or nematode-parasitic fungi should be able to
digest both the nematode and insect eggs. We therefore
purified PSP-3 from P. lilacinus to test its ability to
digest the nematode and insect eggs. As expected, our
bioassay results showed that the amount of protein
released into the supernatant in the protease treatment
group (treatment a) was significantly higher than those
with no protease (treatment b) or denatured protease
(treatment c) (Figure 6; Additional file 5). After incubation with active subtilisin-like serine proteases, the eggshell of the root-knot nematode and the potato tuber
moth were partially degraded, and some eggs were
deformed (data not show), suggesting that the subtilisinlike serine protease produced by P. lilacinus degraded
protein components of both nematode and insect eggs.

Discussion and Conclusions
Our study provides new insights into the evolution of
subtilisin-like serine protease genes in Pezizomycotina.
First, our phylogenetic results suggest that Pezizomycotina subtilisin-like serine proteases most likely evolved
from endocellular to extracellular proteases. As seen
from the tree, the subtilisin-like serine protease genes of
Pezizomycotina previously identified or presumed to be
endocellular proteases [5,25-28] were clustered into
Clade E and diverged the earliest in the phylogeny. In
contrast, most of those previously identified or presumed as extracellular proteases clustered into the other
clades and diverged later. In addition, the protease
(GenBank no. XM_001385908) from the outgroup
Pichia stipitis was assumed as an endocellular protease
[31], supporting the endocellular to extracellular

transition during the evolution of Pezizomycotina subtilisin-like serine proteases. The evolution from endocellular to extracellular enzymes might have facilitated
pathogenic fungi to utilize these enzymes as virulence
factor to colonize their hosts.
Second, our phylogenetic results and functional bioassays suggested that the entomopathogenic and nematode-parasitic fungi shared similar properties in
parasitism. Previous studies indicated that the nematode-parasitic fungi could infect nematodes while the
entomopathogenic fungi could parasitize other insects
[8,32]. The grouping of the cuticle-degrading protease
genes of these two groups of fungi led us to believe that
they might have overlapping pathogenic mechanisms
against both insects and nematodes. Further experimental bioassay showing that the entomopathogenic and
nematode-parasitic fungi could infect both nematode
and insect eggs supported this hypothesis (Figure 4 and
5). Moreover, the subtilisin-like serine protease PSP-3
produced by nematode-parasitic fungus P. lilacinus was
observed to have the ability to digest the eggs of nematodes and insects (Figure 6; Additional file 5). Our finding enriches the known fungal resources for the
microbial control of both types of pests.
Third, our data provide further understanding about
the duplications and subsequent functional divergence
of subtilisin-like serine protease genes in Pezizomycotina. Previous studies have shown that gene duplications
occurred in subtilisin-like serine protease genes of
pathogenic fungi and that such duplications might have
played an essential role in pathogenicity and contributed

to their increased adaptability, host range, and/or survived in various ecological habitats outside the host of
these fungi [33].
From our phylogenetic tree, we found that frequent
gene duplication events have occurred in many pathogenic fungi. For example, there were 9 paralogous subtilisin-like serine protease genes in Metarhizium
anisopliae. Four of them, including PR1A, PR1B, PR1I
and PR1G, clustered into Clade A with the other cuticle-degrading protease genes known to serve as important virulence factors during fungal penetration of
nematode or insect cuticles [13-17,19]. These four genes
most likely perform essential functions during the infection of hosts. In comparison, PR1J, PR1D, PR1E and
PR1F of M. anisopliae fell into Clade C, indicating that
they might have diverged to perform different as yet
uncharacterized functions. Our results are different from
previous inferences suggesting that PR1A was a key
virulence factor during degradation of insect cuticles,
while all the other PR1’s were of only a minor contributor to cuticle degradation [25,34].
In the dermatophytic fungus Arthroderma benhamiae,
there are 7 subtilisin-like serine protease genes (SUB1-7)
[35]. Our phylogenetic tree clustered 6 of them in Clade
B. The only exception was SUB2, which is grouped into
Clade C. This result is consistent with the phylogeny of
Jousson et al. [35]. They hypothesized that SUB2 was
the most ancestral, while the other SUBs were dermatophyte-specific and might have emerged more recently
through successive gene duplication events. In addition,
they speculated that SUB3 and SUB4 were key virulence

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:68
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/68

proteases of dermatophytes and playing important role
in invasion of human or animal keratinised tissues [35].
From our analysis, the key virulence protease genes of
dermatophytic fungi and nematophagous/entomopathogenic fungi were placed in different clades, suggesting
that there were probably different pathogenic mechanisms between mammalian pathogens and nematode/
insect pathogens.
Fourth, our evolutionary analysis revealed signatures
of positive selection acting on the subtilisin-like serine
protease genes of the nematode-trapping fungi, suggesting that the subtilisin-like serine protease genes might
have played important roles during the evolution of
pathogenicity of nematode-trapping fungi against nematodes. Although they both belonged to the cuticledegrading proteases, the subtilisin-like serine protease
genes from nematode-trapping fungi and nematodeparasitic fungi were not grouped together. This result
supports earlier findings based on smaller data sets
[10,11,17]. Since nematode-parasitic fungi do not produce trapping devices, they likely rely mainly on the
extracellular enzymes (including subtilisin-like serine
protease) as virulence factors to penetrate and digest
nematode cuticles. In contrast, by virtue of synergistic
interactions of extracellular enzymes and trapping
devices, the nematode-trapping fungi can immobilize
and penetrate nematodes within a few hours [2,10].
Therefore, the subtilisin-like serine proteases of nematode-trapping fungi might experience special selective
pressure resulted from the co-evolution of trapping
structures and proteolytic enzymes. Interestingly, our
evolutionary analysis demonstrated evidence of positive
selection acting on the cuticle-degrading protease genes
in nematode-trapping fungi, at least during the early
stage of its evolution. We hypothesize that the subtilisin-like serine protease genes may have played important roles during the evolution of pathogenicity of
nematode-trapping fungi against nematodes. In addition,
the potentially adaptive amino acid replacements discovered by our analysis will provide valuable information
for functional analysis in future studies.

Genomic DNA extraction

The five nematode-trapping fungi were cultured in the
PL-4 liquid medium on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 28°
C for 1 week [36]. Their mycelia were then filtered on a
nylon mesh and genomic DNA was isolated using the E.
Z.N.A.@ Fungal DNA Mini kits (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc.
USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Primers design and cloning of subtilisin-like serine
protease genes

Degenerate primers (NP, NR, and P246) (Table 3) were
designed based on previously reported six subtilisin-like
serine protease genes from nematode-trapping fungi
Arthrobotrys oligospora (GenBank no. X94121), Arthrobotrys conoides (GenBank no. AY859782), Monacrosporium microscaphoides (GenBank no. AY841167),
Monacrosporium cystosporum (GenBank no. AY859780),
Monacrosporium elegans (GenBank no. AY859781) and
Dactylella varietas (GenBank no. DQ531603). NP and
NR were used to amplify the full-length genes of subtilisin-like serine proteases from A. musiformis and A. yunnanensis, while P246 and NR were used to amplify the
3’-end fragment of the genes from M. coelobrochum, M.
psychrophilum and D. shizishanna. The primers
1480TSPN (N = 1, 2, 3) and 22TSPN (Table 3), which

followed by 35 cycles with 95°C for 40 s, 51°C for 40 s,
and 72°C for 1.5 min. After the last cycle, the reaction
mixture was maintained at 72°C for 10 min for a final
extension step.
Sequencing and sequence analysis

The amplified products were electrophoresed on 1%
agarose gels to check for fragment size and purity. All
the PCR products were purified using the DNA fragment purification kit ver 2.0 (Takara, Japan) and subcloned into the vector pMD18-T (Takara, Japan).
Escherichia coli strain DH5a was used as a host for
transformation and cloning. It was grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37°C. Ten positive colonies were
selected for sequencing from each strain. The plasmids
were sequenced in both directions on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, USA). Sequence assembly was performed using the SeqMan software (DNA
Star software package, DNASTAR, Inc. USA) and DNAman software package (Version 5.2.2, Lynnon Biosoft,
Canada). Signal sequence was predicted using SignalP
[37]http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. Protein
molecular masses were determined online with ProtParam tools http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html,
and N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted by
NetNGlyc http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/.
Subtilisin-like serine protease genes from the other
Pezizomycotina species

The amino acid sequences of each protease characterized as members of the subtilisin-like family were
retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [38] using BLASTX [39]. MEROPS and
UniProtKB (UniProt Knowledgebase) protein sequence
database were also screened to iteratively search all
known and predicted subtilisin-like serine protease
genes, making sure that all available subtilisin-like serine
protease genes of Pezizomycotina were included in the
analyses. A total of nearly 500 subtilisin-like serine protease genes representing five of nine classes in Pezizomycotina, including Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes,
Leotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes and Orbiliomycetes,
were obtained. In addition, five subtilisin-like serine protease genes from fungi in the Saccharomycotina were
downloaded and used as outgroups. The partial
sequences and those with unusual lengths (<200 aa or
>700 aa) in Pezizomycotina were removed from the analysis, yielding 287 sequences.
The amino acids sequences of the 287 genes were
aligned using Clustal X version 1.83 [40] with default
parameters. Several sequences with ambiguously aligned
regions around the three active catalytic residues (AspHis-Ser) and those with identical sequences but different
accession numbers were eliminated in the analysis,

Page 10 of 14

yielding 189 subtilisin-like sequences in the final dataset.
The Gblocks program http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks.html[41,42] was applied to extract
conserved regions that contain more reliable phylogenetic signals. An alignment consisting of 229 amino acid
positions was obtained.
Phylogenetic analysis

Four tree-building methods were performed for phylogenetic reconstructions. The maximum parsimony (MP)
tree with heuristic search was constructed using
PAUP*4.0b8 [43], and maximum likelihood (ML) tree
with the best-fit model (WAG+I+G) was constructed
using PHYML version 2.4.4 [44]. The best-fit model of
protein evolution was selected by ProtTest http://darwin.uvigo.es[45]. In addition, the program MEGA 4.1
[46,47] was used to construct a neighbor joining (NJ)
tree [48] and MrBayes 3.1.2 [49] was used to perform
Bayesian analysis. Bayesian analysis started with randomly generated trees and four Markov chains under
default heating values were ran for 2 × 106 generations,
with sampling at intervals of 100 generations. To ensure
that these analyses were not trapped in local optima, the
dataset was run three times independently. We determined the burn-in period by checking for likelihood
stability.
To test for nodal reliabilities, bootstrap (BS) analysis
[50] for MP (1,000 replicates), ML (100 replicates) and
NJ (1,000 replicates) was applied. Bayesian posterior
probabilities (PP) from the 50% majority-rule consensus
tree were calculated to provide the estimates of nodal
support in Bayesian phylogenies.
Testing the inconsistency of tree topologies

AU-test [51], SH-test [52] and KH-test [53] were performed using CONSEL version 0.1 h [54] with site-wise
log-likelihoods calculated by Tree-Puzzle 5.1 [55] to
assess the inconsistency of tree topologies.
Detecting positive selection in nematode-trapping fungi

Positive selection has been considered a major force
in forming new motifs or functions in proteins [56].
The non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio ω
(dN/dS) provides an indication of the change in selective pressures. A dN/dS ratio = 1, <1, and >1 indicates neutral evolution, purifying selection, and
positive selection on the protein involved, respectively. In this study, CODEML program of the PAML
package [57,58] and the Bn-Bs software http://www.
bio.psu.edu/People/Faculty/Nei/Lab/software.htm[59]
were implemented to detect signatures of positive
selection in nematode-trapping fungi. The multiply
aligned data are available as supplementary material
(see Additional file 6).

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:68
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/68

The Bn-Bs software implements a modified method
from the original [60] by taking into account the transition bias for estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along the branches of a given tree.
Here, one-tailed Z test was performed.
Considering that positive selection may act in very
short episodes during the evolution of a protein [61]
and affect only a few sites along a few lineages in the
phylogeny, the “branch-site” model, which allows ω
ratios to vary both among lineages of interest and
amino acid sites, was considered here in codon-based
likelihood analysis using the PAML software [57,58]. We
used the branch-site Model A as a stringent test to
identify the sites under positive selection along the
lineages of interest [62] and each model was run twice.
All the possible tree topologies were used here.
The infection of insects and nematodes with
entomopathogenic fungi and nematode-parasitic fungi

For bioassays against the root-knot nematode, nine
selected fungi (Table 2) were cultivated in 9 sterile
Water Agar (WA) media (15 g agar in 1 L deionized
water) at room temperature (10-25°C) separately, until
each agar medium surface was colonized by the fungus.
Then a suspension of nematode eggs (ca. 400 eggs) was
added onto the fungal culture and the mixture was then
kept at the room temperature. In order to keep the eggs
moisturized, a 200 μL sterile M9 buffer (Na2HPO4 6 g,
KH2PO4 3 g, NaCl 0.5 g, NH4Cl 1 g, deionized water to
1 L) was added daily. After 5 days, each culture was
observed daily with the Olympus BX51 microscope
(Japan) and counted the infected eggs 3 times each day.
The criterion of infection was that the root-knot nematode eggs were failed to hatch and the fungal mycelia
were seen growing from the eggs, while none could be
seen in the negative control. All assays were repeated 3
times and each replicates lasted a week.
For bioassays against the potato tuber moth, a fungal
culture with 6 mm in diameter was inoculated onto the
center of a WA medium. Then exactly 30 insect eggs
were put on the periphery of the fungal culture and
incubated at room temperature. From 3 days onward,
each culture was observed daily and counted the
infected eggs 3 times each day. The criterion of infection was that the potato tuber moth eggs were failed to
hatch and the fungal mycelia were seen growing from
the eggs. All assays were repeated 3 times and each
replicate lasted for 1 week.
Effects of the subtilisin-like serine protease PSP-3 on the
nematode and insect eggs

The subtilisin-like serine protease PSP-3 produced by
the nematophagous fungus P. lilacinus was tested for its
ability to degrade the eggs of the root-knot nematode

Page 11 of 14

Meloidogyne sp. and potato tuber moth P. opercullella.
The protease PSP-3 was purified following the procedures described by Bonants et al. [30].
The following experiment design was used: (treatment
a). nematode (a1) or insect (a2) eggs, protease (1,000
μg/mL, 0.2 U/mL, dissolved in potassium phosphate
buffer) 10 μL, toluene (as an antiseptic) 3 μL, potassium
phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L) 137 μL; (treatment b).
nematode (b1) or insect (b2) eggs, toluene 3 μL, potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L) 147 μL; (treatment
c). nematode (c1) or insect (c2) eggs, denatured protease
(1,000 μg/mL, 0.2 U/mL, dissolved in potassium phosphate buffer and then denatured by boiling for 30 min)
10 μL, toluene 3 μL, potassium phosphate buffer (0.1
mol/L) 137 μL; and (d). toluene 3 μL, potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L) 147 μL. Protein concentration
was measured using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250
according to Bradford [63], with bovine serum albumin
(25-400 μg/mL) as the standard. One unit of protease
was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1
mg tyrosine/min at 25°C. For the nematode assay, ca.
1700 eggs were used in each treatment. For the insect
assay, exactly 30 eggs were used. All the treatments
were shaken at Speed 3 on the mixer (Cole-Parmer,
USA) at 25°C. Every 24 h, each treatment was precipitated and a 20 μL- supernatant was collected to measure
the amount of protein concentration using casein as
substrate. The supernatant from treatment (d) was used
as the negative control. Whole assay was repeated 3
times. After checking the data with the KolmogorovSmirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test [64-66], we found
the data from each treatment are approximated a normal distribution (P ≥ 0.05) (see Additional file 7). Statistics analyses were then carried out using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS 14.0. Moreover,
the LSD-test was also used for pairwise comparisons
among the three treatments (see Additional file 5). A P
value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.

model analysis for cuticle-degrading protease genes from
nematode-trapping fungi. The branch-site model analysis using
CODEML program of the PAML package [57,58] was used to detect
