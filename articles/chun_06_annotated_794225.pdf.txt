Abstract
Background: Biologists are becoming increasingly aware that the interaction of animals, including humans, with their
coevolved bacterial partners is essential for health. This growing awareness has been a driving force for the development
of models for the study of beneficial animal-bacterial interactions. In the squid-vibrio model, symbiotic Vibrio fischeri
induce dramatic developmental changes in the light organ of host Euprymna scolopes over the first hours to days of their
partnership. We report here the creation of a juvenile light-organ specific EST database.
Results: We generated eleven cDNA libraries from the light organ of E. scolopes at developmentally significant time
points with and without colonization by V. fischeri. Single pass 3' sequencing efforts generated 42,564 expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) of which 35,421 passed our quality criteria and were then clustered via the UIcluster program into 13,962
nonredundant sequences. The cDNA clones representing these nonredundant sequences were sequenced from the 5'

end of the vector and 58% of these resulting sequences overlapped significantly with the associated 3' sequence to
generate 8,067 contigs with an average sequence length of 1,065 bp. All sequences were annotated with BLASTX (Evalue < -03) and Gene Ontology (GO).
Conclusion: Both the number of ESTs generated from each library and GO categorizations are reflective of the activity
state of the light organ during these early stages of symbiosis. Future analyses of the sequences identified in these libraries
promise to provide valuable information not only about pathways involved in colonization and early development of the
squid light organ, but also about pathways conserved in response to bacterial colonization across the animal kingdom.

Background
The study of the interactions of animals with their beneficial or mutualistic bacterial partners is a frontier field with
a vast array of largely unanswered questions. A major subset of such associations, e.g., those of mammals, comprises the horizontally transmitted partnerships, i.e.,
associations in which the host and symbiont population
or community re-establishes the relationship with each
new host generation [1]. For this specific array of partnerships, some principal questions include: how are the bacterial partners harvested from the environment? In
associations with consortia of bacteria, who are the naturally coevolved symbionts, or residents, and who are the
'tourists'? What factors mediate partner recognition and
specificity? How do the partners impact one anothers'
developmental programs? How is stability of the association achieved so that the bacterial partners are not eliminated nor are they allowed to overgrow host tissues? What
are the principal similarities and differences in the mechanisms underlying beneficial and pathogenic interactions?
Biologists know little about beneficial animal-bacterial
relationships principally because of technological impediments, many of which have been alleviated by advances
in molecular biology and biotechnology. These technological breakthroughs have poised the community of biologists to address the above-mentioned questions.
Specifically, large-scale sequencing efforts are allowing
biologists to define the communities associated with particular animal species (e.g., [2-6]), and development of
such methods as microarray analyses are enabling biologists to determine host and symbiont responses under
natural and experimental conditions [6,7].
In addition to these technological advances, the development of powerful models for the study of animal-bacterial
interactions has been essential. As in developmental biology, the study of a wide variety of models will shed light
on evolutionarily conserved mechanisms as well as the
basis of diversity. To this end, two principal, complementary model types are under investigation: those using
germ-free or gnotobiotic animals and binary associations.
Most notably for the former, Gordon and coworkers have
been experimentally manipulating germ-free, gnotobiotic

and 'conventionalized' (provided with their normal
microbiota) zebrafish and mice to characterize interactions with their microbial partners [6,8]. These studies
have revealed that the diverse community of microbiota
in the vertebrate gut has profound effects on the gene
expression, anatomy and physiology of the host animals
(see e.g., [9,10]). Binary associations, i.e., those composed
on one host species and a population of one microbial
species, occur most often in invertebrate animals and offer
relatively simple experimental systems for the study of
animal-microbe relationships [11-13].
The association between the Hawaiian sepiolid squid
Euprymna scolopes and its luminous bacterial partner Vibrio
fischeri is a binary model system that has been under
investigation for the last fifteen years (for review see [13]).
The relationship, in which the symbiont lives extracellularly in crypts of the light organ, begins in the hours after
the juvenile host hatches from the egg. During embryogenesis, the host develops a nascent light organ that promotes specific colonization by V. fischeri (Fig. 1). Once
light organ tissues have been colonized, development of
the partners is induced (Fig. 2). The bacterial symbiont
triggers an elaborate developmental program in the host
animal that leads to the transformation of the organ from
an anatomy, physiology and biochemistry that promotes
infection to one that fosters the functioning of the mature,
bioluminescent organ. Likewise, the bacterial partner
transforms its biology from that characteristic of its niche
in the bacterioplankton to that of its niche as a luminous
bacterial symbiont.
In developing the squid-vibrio model, researchers in the
field have sought not only to describe the nature of the
system, from both the host and symbiont sides of the
association, but also to apply new tools, as they became
available, for its study. Specifically, early efforts resulted in
the development of genetics in the bacterial symbiont
[14] and, more recently, the annotated sequence of the V.
fischeri genome has become available [15]. The collaborative work presented here describes the first efforts to generate bioinformatics tools for the host side of the squidvibrio association. Our goal was to define a representative
set of host genes expressed in the juvenile light organ during the early developmental stages. To this end, we generPage 2 of 10

cant time points in the squid-vibrio system. This approach
has been successfully used in the past to identify the set of
transcribed genes specific to an organ or tissue of a particular organism (see e.g., [16-20]). The generation of these
resources paves the way for an in-depth examination of
the influence of symbiosis in host gene expression in the
squid-vibrio system.

Results
A total of 11 cDNA libraries (Table 1) were generated from
5 pools of squid light organ RNA, containing clones with
insert sizes ranging from 0.35 to 2.5 kb and an average
length of ~1 kb. From these cDNA libraries, sequencing
generated a total of 42,564 3' EST sequences with an average sequence length of 692 bp and an average phred value
of 39.7. An overall novelty of greater than 45% remained
throughout the sequencing phases of the non-normalized, normalized and subtracted libraries (Fig. 3).

Of the 42,564 ESTs generated, 35,421 ESTs satisfied the
quality criteria (see Materials and Methods). From the
sequences that passed the quality criteria 97% (34,249)
contained a polyadenylation tail. Of those sequences with
a polyadenylation tail, 63% (21,439) contained a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA or
ATTAAA), and another 15% (5,157) contained an alternative polyadenylation signal sequence[21]. In silico comparison of these 42,564 ESTs to sequences from the V.
fischeri genome showed no sequence similarity, suggesting neither contaminating V. fischeri sequence nor evidence for horizontal gene transfer.
These 35,421 ESTs were divided into 13,962 unique clusters using the UIcluster program. One sequence from each
cluster was chosen to be a part of a nonredundant set of
ESTs. Within this set of clusters, 13,441 contained at least
one sequence with a polyadenylation tail and 8,806 of
these also contained a polyadenylation signal sequence.
Five prime sequences with an average length of 683 bp
were generated from these nonredundant representative
sequences from each cluster. Of these sequences, 58%
(8,067) of 13,962 ESTs contained sufficient overlapping
paired 3' and 5' sequences to form contigs with an average
sequence length of 1,065 bp. These contigs were used in
place of the individual 3' and 5' sequences in further analyses when available. Representative 3' and 5' sequences
from the final non-redundant set of ESTs were deposited
in the dbEST division of GenBank.
The BLAST annotation of the nonredundant set (13,962
ESTs) showed that 70% (9,728) had a significant hit to a
protein in the NCBI nonredundant protein database with
an E-value threshold of e-03 (Fig. 4). Of these significant
hits, 62% (6,061) hit an annotated known protein, 29%
(2,793) hit a hypothetical protein and 9% (874) hit an

The time points chosen for cDNA library construction
The time points chosen for cDNA library construction. The diagram illustrates when, in the context of the symbiontinduced developmental program of the host light organ and major milestones in V. fischeri colonization, tissues for library construction were dissected from juvenile animals. As the symbionts aggregate, migrate into host tissues and take up residence in
the light organ crypts, they induce the diagrammed series of developmental changes in the various components of the organ.
Most of these changes, including the irreversible loss of the SCE, which doesn't culminate until 96 hours, are triggered by or
around 12 hours following first exposure to environmental V. fischeri. In addition, around 12 hours, the symbionts usually fully
colonize the crypt spaces and their growth is attenuated and luminescence induced. By 48 hours, significant changes in the proteome occur (Lemus and McFall-Ngai, 2000). In addition, mutants of V. fischeri incapable of persisting in the light organ lose the
ability to colonize the organ beginning at around 48 hours.

unknown protein. Of the remaining 30% without a significant BLAST hit, nearly half, 46% (1,963), may represent
novel sequences because there was no hit to the nonredundant database.
Using the DAVID program, GO terms for biological process, molecular function and cellular component were
associated with 75% (4,527) of the 6,061 ESTs that hit
with an annotated protein in the NCBI database (Fig. 4
and see Additional files 1, 2 and 3). Of these 4,527 ESTs,
78% (3,512) have an associated biological process
description, 90% (4,071) have an associated molecular

function description, and 65% (2,960) have an associated
cellular component description.
Of the 13,962 ESTs, the largest number of ESTs (3,039)
was found to be specific to the 48-h symbiotic library and
this number is nearly twice the number found to be specific from any other library (1,311 specific to the hatchling
library, 1,381 specific to the 12-h aposymbiotic library,
1,314 specific to the 48-h aposymbiotic library, and 1,699
specific to the 12-h symbiotic library). In addition, 29%
(4,006) of the 13,962 ESTs are sequences derived from
only aposymbiotic libraries (1,311 from hatchling librar-

Novel gene discovery
Novel gene discovery. Large increases in sequence contributions are evident from each set of libraries, which are illustrated as follows: sequences from 5 non-normalized libraries
(approximately the first 10,000 ESTs); sequences from 5 normalized libraries (approximately from 10,000 to 30,000
ESTs); and sequences from pooled, subtracted libraries (after
30,000 ESTs) (Table 1). Novelty rates, calculated as the ratio
of the total number of clusters identified over the total
number of ESTs generated, were 39%, 54%, and 75%, for the
non-normalized, normalized and subtracted libraries, after

known protein, 23% (1,720) with a hypothetical protein,
and 7% (523) with an unknown protein at an E-value
threshold of e-03. Of the singleton clusters, 16% (1,221)
do not have a BLAST hit and may be novel. In the set of
clusters containing more than 1 EST, 52% (3,271) are
associated with a known protein, 17% (1,073) hit with a
hypothetical protein, and 6% (351) match with an
unknown protein at an E-value threshold of e-03. Of the
remaining 45% (6,323) of clusters containing two or
more ESTs, 12% (742) do not have a BLAST hit. Although
most of these clusters are represented by two or three
ESTs, more than a quarter are composed of at least four
ESTs with one cluster of 57 ESTs.
The similarity of E. scolopes sequences to those of three
animals that are commonly studied but distantly related
to E. scolopes, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans, were determined using a BLASTbased analysis with an E-value threshold of e-50. The goal
of this analysis was to perform a comparative genomic
analysis through identification of orthologous genes. This
is an alternate strategy which is based on gene content as
opposed to a traditional molecular phylogeny analysis
which is based on gene sequence. We evaluated several
genes using the PHYLIP package (data not shown) with
indeterminate results[22]. The results of these analyses
indicate the squid ESTs have the greatest number of genes
with similarity only to H. sapiens genes with 1.30% (342)
of the 26,309 annotated human sequences, compared to
0.22% (40) of the 18,289 annotated sequences reported
in D. melanogaster and 0.03% (6) of the 22,215 annotated
sequences reported in C. elegans (see Additional file 4).
These data show a higher number of squid genes homologous to a deuterostome chordate, H. sapiens, than to two
members of the Ecdysozoa, the arthropod D. melanogaster
and the nematode C. elegans.
To assess characteristics of the untranslated region and
codon usage, a BLAST search was performed between the

ing sequence. Of the nine least frequently used codons six
are exclusively composed of G's and C's. These codons
were significantly under-used ranging in prevalence from
0.5% – 0.75%. However, the codon GGC, occurs at a frequency of 1.3%, and the codon GCC, occurs at a frequency of 1.6%, and due to the increased prevalence,
these two codons are considered significant outliers.

Discussion
In this report, we characterize 13,962 nonredundant EST
sequences generated from eleven cDNA libraries derived
from pools of juvenile E. scolopes light organs, which were
collected at developmentally significant time points with
and without colonization by V. fischeri. These nonredundant sequences were: 1) characterized, 2) annotated, and
3) analyzed for novelty within each condition.

contained a BLAST hit of at least e-40 with a stop consistent with the carboxy terminus of at least one protein (+/5 AA). This same analysis estimated an average 3' UTR
length of 227 bp. This estimate is conservative as genes
with a UTR longer than the average contig length of 1,065
bp may not have a BLAST hit. These same UTR predictions
were used to estimate the GC content in the coding
sequence compared to the untranslated sequence. A bias
in GC content was observed between the coding and noncoding sequence from 31.5% GC in the predicted untranslated sequence to 42.4% GC content in the predicted cod-

UniGene sets of over 40,000 unique transcripts have been
reported for vertebrate chordates. However, among the
invertebrate chordates and other invertebrates, they are
most often less than half that size, ranging from approximately 6,000 to 15,000 unique transcripts. Based on clustering analysis, which estimates the number of transcripts
present in the organism, the E. scolopes nonredundant EST
set containing 13,962 clusters is in the same range as that
of other invertebrates represented in the UniGene database. It is interesting to note, that the UniGene database
reports unique sets as composites of all reported EST
sequences, i.e., it is not organ specific, thus, the E. scolopes
nonredundant set is relatively large for an organ specific
library and may indicate a substantially larger transcriptome than has previously been reported for other invertebrates. A comparison of the EST clusters derived from the
eleven squid light organ libraries showed that the largest
number of unique clusters is associated with the 48-h
symbiotic condition. This increase in transcriptional
diversity is supported by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of standing stock protein
in the developing squid light organ, which showed that
differences in light organ protein profiles in response to V.
fischeri colonization are not easily detectable until 48
hours post-inoculation [23].
Sequencing of the eleven squid light organ cDNA libraries
resulted in ESTs of similar length and quality to sequences
generated from previously constructed cDNA libraries
[16-18,24]. The predicted 3'-UTR length of 227 bp is
shorter than the 411 bp 3'-UTR length found for orthologous human and rat genes [25]. This may be explained, at
least in part, by the occurrence of A-rich sequences within
the 3' UTRs of a significant fraction of E. scolopes transcripts. This hypothesis is based on the fact that 22% of
the squid ESTs do not contain a recognizable polyadenylation signal sequence within 30 bases from the 3' end

tail, which suggests that such ESTs might result from internal oligo-dT priming during first-strand cDNA synthesis.
BLASTX annotation of these 13,962 sequences identified
a number of genes encoding proteins known to be important in the squid light organ for both development and
symbiosis, such as: reflectin [26], actin [27], myeloperoxidase [28], aldehyde dehydrogenase [29] and nitric oxide
synthase [30]. The identification of genes in the EST database known to play a significant role in the squid light
organ serves as a proof-of-concept, suggesting that the
additional sequences provided by the construction of the
database will be invaluable for the identification of pathways involved in the early development of the squid light
organ and its colonization by V. fischeri. For example, this
EST library has already played an integral role in the discovery of elements of the NF-kB pathway in the host squid
[31].
Previous work on the E. scolopes – V. fischeri system has
shown that the light organ is undergoing a rapid morphogenesis in response to signals from both the external environment and colonizing V. fischeri in these early hours of
the symbiosis (Fig. 2)[13]. The numbers of ESTs in each
library as well as Gene Ontology (GO) descriptions of
annotated ESTs are reflective of the active state of the
organ during these early developmental stages. Specifically, categories overrepresented included those involved
with signal transduction, cell membrane, development
and morphogenesis. Expression of genes in these categories is not surprising in light of the fact that the host squid
and the bacterial symbiont signal to one another through
their cell surfaces, an activity that leads to the dramatic
remodeling of host tissues. EST sequences often reflect the
function of tissue from which the cDNA library was
derived. To determine if the patterns of genes expressed in
these cDNA libraries are unique to the squid light organ,
we compared our results with that of the nonredundant
EST database derived from the developing rat heart [17].
The squid light organ database is dominated by signal
transduction (67%) and membrane-associated proteins
(49%), whereas the database of the rat heart is dominated
by cell growth and maintenance (63%) and intracellular
activities (70%). Thus, in a broad sense, the content of
these databases appear to mirror the physiological state of
these organs.

Conclusion
This EST library is the first effort to generate a bioinformatics tool for the host side of the squid-vibrio association. This tool will allow us use this powerful binary
model to ask specific questions to elucidate basic host
responses to bacterial colonization in vivo, offering a
complement to the more complex associations of vertebrates and the microbiota associated with their mucosa.

Finally, the creation of a light organ-specific spotted
microarray using this EST library will pave the way for the
study of broad scale changes in host gene expression that
underlie the dramatic developmental program of this
symbiosis.

Methods
Animal maintenance and tissue preparation
Adult E. scolopes and egg clutches produced by female
adults were maintained at the Kewalo Marine Laboratory
as previously described [32]. Approximately 1,500 light
organs were collected in RNALater (Ambion) for the eventual production of cDNA libraries from juvenile squid in
five conditions: hatchling, 12-h aposymbiotic, 12-h symbiotic, 48-h aposymbiotic, and 48-h symbiotic animals.
All animals were hatched into Hawaiian offshore seawater
(HOSW), which does not contain enough V. fischeri cells
to result in light organ colonization, but does contain
other bacteria (at 105-106 cells/ml) that naturally occur in
the waters off of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. All light
organs were dissected from animals, which had been
anesthetized for ~2 min in 2% ethanol and HSOW, within
1 h before and after the time point specified for each condition, except for the hatchling condition, for which all
dissections occurred within 1 h post-hatching.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted from light organs in RNALater
(Ambion) using Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL, Rockville,
MD). Total RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry
and the quality was determined by 2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from
total RNA samples using oligo-(dT)-cellulose chromatography.

The method used for the construction of directionally
cloned cDNA libraries [33,34] includes a column chromatography step that is aimed at eliminating unwanted DNA
fragments (primers and adaptors) and short cDNAs (e.g.,
those consisting exclusively of poly(A) tail). Although
aware of the possibility of excluding cDNAs derived from
genuine short transcripts, this step has proven important
to minimize generation of nuisance ESTs in large-scale
sequencing projects.
cDNA libraries
DNase-treated poly-(A)+ samples were used to create 11
cDNA libraries: 5 start (non-normalized), 5 normalized
and 1 subtracted. For each library, cDNA was primed with
the following oligo (dT) primer, [TGTTACCATTCTGATGTTGGAGCGGCCGC-N[6–10]-T[18]]. Each primer contained a NotI restriction site for directional cloning and
one of 11 unique library tags of 6 to 10 nucleotides (N [6–
10]), which identifies the condition of origin (Table 1)
[35]. Double-stranded cDNA was ligated to EcoRI adap-

tors [5'-AATTGGCACGAGG-3', 3'-GCCGTGCTCC-5'],
digested with NotI, and directionally cloned into the
phagemid vector pT7T3-Pac as described in [17]. Each
library comprised several times more recombinants than
the expected number of transcripts from the RNA populations utilized, and thus can be treated as if they had the
same number of primary recombinants.
Sequencing, analysis and clustering
Di-deoxy terminator sequencing was performed from the
3' end of the cDNA clones using M13 forward (5'-GTTTTCCCAGTCAC-3') primers in a 96-well format via cycle
sequencing with dRhodamine dye terminator chemistry
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After thermal
cycling, sequencing reactions were processed and analyzed on an ABI-377 or an ABI-3700 capillary sequencer
as described in [36].

After data capture on the ABI sequencers, the chromatographs are transferred to a centralized server. From there,
the sequences were processed as outlined below and
placed into our local file-system. Nucleotide sequences
and per-base quality values were extracted from the ABIgenerated chromatograph files (SCF files) using the
Phred-base-calling program and evaluated for 3 features:
1) overall sequence quality (Phred q-score >25); 2) percent of sequence (in nt) over q20 > 50%, and 3) the quality-trimmed EST insert length of more than 100 bp
[37,38].
ESTprep [39] and RepeatMasker (Smit and Green, unpublished data) programs were used to assess the presence of
the following EST features: vector cloning site, restriction
site, polyadenylation tail and signal sequence, library tag,
and potential contaminating sequences from Escherichia
coli, V. fischeri and vector as described in [17,40]. Local
clustering of the ESTs was performed using the sequencebased clustering program UIcluster [41], allowing
matches based on both the forward and reverse complements. A representative sequence was selected from each
cluster based on best sequence quality, as described
above, resulting in a unigene set containing 13,962 ESTs.
Each of the cDNA clones in the unigene set was sequenced
from the 5' end using the same protocol described above
with the exception of using the M13 reverse primer (5'AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3') instead of the
M13 forward primer. The 3' and 5' sequences were assembled into a consensus contig using default settings of the
Phred program when sufficient quality sequence existed.
3' and 5' sequences generated as a part of this research
were submitted to dbEST division of GenBank at National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under
accession numbers ranging from Genbank:DW251302 to
Genbank:DW286722[42].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/154

Sequence annotation
Each of the 13,962 ESTs were compared against the six
nonredundant peptide sequence databases (GenBank
CDS translations, RefSeq Proteins, PDB, SwissProt, PIR,
and PRF) available on NCBI using a BLAST-based analysis
program (BLASTX), which translates each EST sequence in
six reading frames prior to each query. BLAST analyses
against peptide sequences provide the largest number of
hits in comparison to nucleotide sequences because peptide analyses allow for nucleotide sequence divergence
among species. Default BLASTX parameters were used
including a maximum expectation (E)-value of 10.
Because of the low abundance of sequence data from
organisms in the sub-kingdom containing mollusks (i.e.,
Lophotrochozoa) available in NCBI's database, we chose
a high E-value threshold to reveal as many potential
matches to our squid EST sequences as possible, i.e.,
sequence annotation was performed using an E-value
threshold of e-03 to determine significance. Sequences
were first annotated based on a significant hit to an annotated protein. If no hit to an annotated protein occurred,
then sequences were annotated as a 'significant' or a 'nonsignificant' 'unknown' (match to a predicted protein
sequence from a cDNA or other nondescriptive term) or
'hypothetical' (match to a hypothetical protein). Finally, if
the result of the BLAST analysis showed no significant hits
to any protein in the NCBI nonredundant database,
sequences were annotated as 'no significant hit'. The gene
name and a unique identifier (i.e., GI number, Accession
Number, Entrez gene ID, Genepept accession) were collected from the NCBI web site for each chosen BLAST hit.
Putative functions and product information, such as Gene
Ontology (GO) for each unique identifier matching an
annotated protein was determined with the Database for
Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) [43]. Annotated ESTs were categorized based on
the terms in each of the standard GO categories, specifically biological process (BP), molecular function (MF)
and cellular component (CC).
