Lentivirus infection of wild rhesus macaques (Macaca
mulatta) and langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) from forests of Rajasthan was suspected based on testing of simian
plasma samples by commercial HIV-1 WB in 1998.
Though simians have a religious connotation in India,
aggressive monkey bites are frequently reported from
urban and rural areas due to habitat fragmentation of wild
simians. Blood samples from 34 feral rhesus macaques
and 9 langurs were collected recently from forests of
Rajasthan. Plasma samples were tested using monoclonal
antibody against capsid proteins of SIVmac (p27) and
HIV-1 (p24). Mitochondrial gene analyses confirmed the
species of origin. Integrated provirus was detected by AluLTR amplification. Lentiviral genes, gag, pol, env, nef, vif,
vpr and LTR were amplified and sequenced. Viral load
assay was performed independently. Virus purified from
simian plasma by ultracentrifugation was used to infect
human PBMC, H9 (CD4+, CXCR4+) and U87 (CD4+,
CCR5+) cell lines. Virus replication in vitro was detected
by p24 antigen capture ELISA and microscopic syncytia
formation. Phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences
demonstrated intriguing homology to subtype B HIV-1
rather than any known SIV. Significant sequence divergence from HXB2 existed in different regions of viral genome except for conserved pol (RT) region, ruling out
inadvertent laboratory contamination. Serological activity
was observed against HIV-1 p24 but not SIVmac p27.
Reverse transmission of subtype B HIV-1, which is transmitted in north India from infected humans to feral
simians due to bleeding monkey bite followed by horizontal spread of the infection in troops of wild simians is
proposed.
