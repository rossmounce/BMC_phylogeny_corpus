Abstract
Background: Soluble guanylyl cyclases (SGCs) are dimeric enzymes that transduce signals
downstream of nitric oxide (NO) in animals. They sense NO by means of a heme moiety that is
bound to their N-terminal extensions.
Results: Using sequence profile searches we show that the N-terminal extensions of the SGCs
contain two globular domains. The first of these, the HNOB (Heme NO Binding) domain, is a
predominantly α-helical domain and binds heme via a covalent linkage to histidine. Versions lacking
this conserved histidine and are likely to interact with heme non-covalently. We detected HNOB
domains in several bacterial lineages, where they occur fused to methyl accepting domains of
chemotaxis receptors or as standalone proteins. The standalone forms are encoded by predicted
operons that also contain genes for two component signaling systems and GGDEF-type nucleotide
cyclases. The second domain, the HNOB associated (HNOBA) domain occurs between the HNOB
and the cyclase domains in the animal SGCs. The HNOBA domain is also detected in bacteria and
is always encoded by a gene, which occurs in the neighborhood of a gene for a HNOB domain.
Conclusion: The HNOB domain is predicted to function as a heme-dependent sensor for gaseous
ligands, and transduce diverse downstream signals, in both bacteria and animals. The HNOBA
domain functionally interacts with the HNOB domain, and possibly binds a ligand, either in
cooperation, or independently of the latter domain. Phyletic profiles and phylogenetic analysis
suggest that the HNOB and HNOBA domains were acquired by the animal lineage via lateral
transfer from a bacterial source.

Background
Binding and recognizing diverse small molecules is a central aspect of signal transduction mechanisms in all cellular life forms. A variety of environmental small molecules,
namely, nutrients, xenobiotics and first messengers are
recognized by cells, with the help of specialized protein
sensors on their surfaces [1,2]. Additionally cells also use
protein-bound small molecules, such as FAD, cinnamic
acid, tetrapyrroles and heme as sensors of photons and

the ambient redox states [3,4]. Within cells, small molecules, such as cyclic nucleotides, are used as intracellular
messengers to transduce signals arising from a variety of
stimuli [1,2]. Over the past few years a combination of
protein sequence analysis and biochemical studies have
revealed several unifying principles that govern the recognition of small molecules by cells [4–9]. A significant
component of small molecule-protein interactions is mediated via a relatively small set of ancient conserved

protein domains that bind their ligands using specialized
pockets [4,10]. Certain protein folds have given rise to
several large superfamilies of ligand-binding domains.
These include the PAS-like fold, which is the scaffold of
the PAS [11,12], GAF [13], and probably the CACHE [14]
superfamilies, and the ACT-like fold, which is seen in
ACT, ferredoxin and related ligand-binding domains
[4,15]. Identification of such conserved domains has, often, improved our understanding of the general structural
and biochemical features that underlie protein-small molecule interactions.
Typically, these small molecule-binding domains
(SMBDs) are combined, within the same polypeptide, to
a number of conserved domains that are directly involved
in signal transduction. These include enzymatic domains
such as nucleotide cyclases, histidine and serine/threonine kinases, cNMP phosphodiesterases, receiver domains and several different kinds of ATPases [3,4]. Noncatalytic domains, like DNA- or RNA-binding modules
(eg. the helix-turn-helix domains), methyl-accepting domains, and FHA domains that bind phosphorylated peptides, are also often fused to SMBDs [3,4].
The soluble guanylyl cyclases are important signaling
molecules in animals that transduce signals mediated by
the gaseous first messenger, nitric oxide [16–19]. In animals, NO functions as a neurotransmitter both in the central and peripheral nervous system. NO is released by a
cell through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
on its substrate, the amino acid arginine [20]. NO diffuses
through the neighboring cells and elicits its functions by
activating a soluble guanylyl cyclase (SGC) that synthesizes cGMP using GTP as a substrate [16,18]. The animal
SGCs are dimeric enzymes comprised of two homologous
subunits, α and β. The sequence similarity between these
subunits extends throughout their entire length, and they
contain a long extension N-terminal to the cNMP generating catalytic domain. The N-terminal region of the β subunit forms a covalent link with heme via a histidine
(H105 in human SGC1β) [21]. Though the porphyrin is
identical to that found in hemoglobin, it only binds NO
and carbon monoxide, and not oxygen, even though O2 is
present at much higher concentrations within the cell
[22,23]. This ligand specificity of the NO binding domain
of animal SGCs is very similar to bacterial cytochrome c'
that likewise binds only NO and CO [24]. The N-terminal
region of the α subunit has been shown to bind certain
synthetic pyrazolopyridine ligands, which act as potents
NO-independent agonists of cyclase activity [25,26].
Using sensitive sequence profile analysis we show that the
heme-binding domain of the animal SGCs defines a novel
family of ligand binding domains that are also widely distributed in bacteria. The SGCs also contain a second glob-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/5

ular domain situated in between the heme-binding and
cyclase domains. We show that this domain is also present
in the bacteria, and present evidence that these two domains are likely to function together both in eukaryotes
and bacteria, and activate a diverse set of downstream
signals.

Results and Discussion
Identification of the HNOB and HNOBA domains
Though both the α and β subunits of SGCs are homologous throughout their entire length, only the β subunit
contains the critical heme-binding residue. As this long
homologous N-terminal extension of SGC subunits does
not map to any previously characterized domains, we
sought to investigate its provenance through sequence
analysis methods. The length and conservation pattern of
the N-terminal domain suggested that the N-terminal extension of the SGCs is likely to comprise of two globular
domains in the least. This conjecture was also supported
by an analysis of sequence complexity of the polypeptide
using the SEG program [27].

A PSI-BLAST search was initiated with the conserved Nterminal extension of the SGC (human SGC1β, gi:
4504215, region 1–360), using an inclusion threshold of
.01, and compositional bias based statistics to eliminate
false positives arising due to peculiarities of sequence
composition. Both the N- and the C-terminal parts of this
extension gave several distinct hits to different bacterial
proteins, supporting the presence of two distinct globular
domains in this extension. Based on these hits we divided
the extension into N- and C-terminal parts and initiated
separate PSI-BLAST searches with them. Searches with the
N-terminal part of the extension gave significant hits to
bacterial proteins of the length 180–195 residues within
the first 3 iterations (eg. Mdge1313 from Microbulbifer degradans is detected with an expect-value (e) of 10-4 in the
first iteration). This region of similarity encompasses the
entire length of these bacterial proteins, and includes the
heme-liganding histidine of the SGC β subunits, and is
likely to define a distinct globular domain. In order to
probe this domain further we isolated this region from
SGC1β (1–185) and seeded a PSI-BLAST search that was
run to convergence. At convergence, this search detected,
in addition to the soluble guanylyl cyclases from the animals, several bacterial proteins, including certain methylaccepting chemotaxis receptors from bacteria such as Desulfovibrio and Clostridium. Transitive searches initiated
with the small bacterial proteins that entirely correspond
to the N-terminal-most domain of the SGCs also recovered the same set of proteins as observed in the earlier
search, with e <.01. These observations suggest that the Nterminal-most domain of the SGCs is evolutionarily mobile: it occurs in several distinct contexts with other domains in the same polypeptide, or in a stand-alone form.

PSI-BLAST searches initiated with the C-terminal part of
the SGC-specific extension (the region in between the
above-detected N-terminal-most domain, and the C-terminal cyclase domain; human SGC1β, region: 200–370)
recovered homologous regions from all other animal soluble guanylyl cyclases, and, additionally, N-terminal regions of histidine kinases from Nostoc and Anabaena
species (eg. gi: 17229771, e = 10-4 in iteration 1) and a diguanylate cyclase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (gi:
22958462 e = 10-3 in iteration 3). The region of similarity
shared by these bacterial proteins and animal SGCs encompassed more-or-less the entire middle region, which
is present between the two other globular domains. Reciprocal searches with the corresponding region from the cyanobacterial histidine kinases recovered the animal SGCs,
thereby confirming the evolutionary relationship between
these regions. These observations suggest that the middle
region of the animal SGCs defines a second evolutionarily
mobile globular domain that is shared with several distinct bacterial proteins.

Because the middle domain of the SGCs is always associated with the HNOB domains (see below), we named it
the HNOBA (HNOBAssociated) domain. A multiple
alignment of this domain revealed, that unlike the HNOB
domain, it is likely to adopt an α + β fold with segregated
α and β domains (Fig. 2). Its core contains 5 conserved
strands, followed, at the extreme C-terminus, by a long helix that is likely to form a coiled-coil linker region involved in dimerization (Fig. 2). Within the core the first
two strands are predicted to form a β-hairpin followed by
a helical region, which in turn is followed by 3 consecutive strands and single α-helix. A similar secondary structure pattern is also observed in several other ligandbinding domains such as the PAS, GAF, profilin and probably even the CACHE domains [10]. Sequence-structure
threading using the 3DPSSM method detected the PAS domain (Photoactive yellow protein PDB: 1drm) with marginally significant scores (.5, 50–70% probability of
correct fold prediction). This suggests that the HNOBA
domain could potentially contain a PAS-like fold.

A multiple alignment of the N-terminal-most domain of
the SGCs and its bacterial homologs was prepared using
the T_coffee program and adjusted manually based on the
PSI-BLAST HSPs (Fig. 1). The multiple aligment shows
that the heme-binding histidine of the SGC-β subunits is
contained within this domain. We accordingly termed
this domain the HNOB (Heme-Nitric Oxide Binding) domain. The histidine is predicted to be positioned next to
the N-terminus of an α-helix, and is conserved throughout this superfamily, with the exception of α-subunits of
the SGCs (Fig. 1) and two bacterial versions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Magnetococcus species. Though SGC
α-subunits lack the histidine, the region encompassing
the HNOB domain in human SGC1α has been shown to
be important for functional heme binding by the dimeric
enzyme [28]. Hence, in addition to covalent heme binding, HNOB domains may also interact with it non-covalently. The N-terminal part of the domain contains a
universally conserved acidic residue that may play a critical role creating the local environment for NO selectivity.
The rest of the sequence conservation maps mainly to the
cores of secondary structure elements and some well conserved turns (Fig. 1). Secondary structure prediction
shows that the HNOB domain is likely to adopt a predominantly α-helical fold with a few interspersed extended elements. Further, the predicted trans-membrane
topologies of HNOB domain proteins suggest an intracellular localization for all occurrences of this domain. However, neither direct comparisons, nor sequence-structure
threading revealed any relationship with the two other
well-characterized α-helical heme-binding domains,
namely globin and cytochrome C. Hence, it is likely that
the HNOB domain adopts a structure distinct from these
domains.

All versions of the HNOBA domain, except one from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, contain a conserved histidine between the core region and the long C-terminal α-helix that
links it to a kinase or cyclase domain (Fig. 2). However,
studies on the SGCs suggest no evidence for a second covalent heme-binding site, implying that this histidine
could have some other function. Interestingly, binding
studies on a synthetic pyrazolopyridine SGC agonist, BAY
41–2272 have suggested a role for the region 236–290 of
the human SGC1 α-subunit in interacting with this ligand
[25,26]. Though actual cross-linking occurred with
cysteine residues situated just N-terminal to the HNOBA
domain, it is likely that the rest of domain is involved in
contact with the ligand. This may suggest the possibility of
the HNOBA domain binding some, as yet unknown, endogenous ligand. In such a scenario it could participate in
allosteric regulation of the SGCs, similar to the GAF domains of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases [6,13].
Evolutionary history, domain architectures, and gene
neighborhoods of the HNOB and HNOBA domain
proteins
The HNOB domain is found in various bacterial lineages
such as cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and low GC Grampositive bacteria. It is entirely absent in all archaeal proteomes available to date, and amidst the eukaryotes is
only detectable in the animal lineage. In bacteria, the
HNOB domain proteins display two principal architectures. They may occur as stand-alone proteins, entirely
composed of the HNOB domain, in several bacterial lineages (Fig. 3). In the low GC Gram-positive bacteria and
Desulfovibrio desulfuricans they occur in combination with
the methyl accepting chemotaxis receptor proteins, with
or without the HAMP domain [29,30]. Additionally, in

Multiple Sequence Alignment of the HNOB domain. The multiple sequence alignment was constructed using T-Coffee
after parsing high-scoring pairs from PSI-BLAST search results. The PHD-secondary structure is shown above the alignment
with E representing a β strand, and H an α-helix (uppercase is for predictions with >82% accuracy while lower case denotes
predictions with >72% accuracy). The 90% consensus shown below the alignment was derived using the following amino acid

Figure 2
Multiple alignment of the HNOBA domain. The figure is presented using the same conventions as figure 1. The coloring
was based on a 95% consensus with the same color code as in Figure 1. The positive subset of polar amino acids (+: HKR) is
colored pink. The conserved histidine at the C-terminus of the HNOBA domain is indicated by an asterisk. The linker helix at
the C-terminus is distinguished from the core of the HNOBA domain by a marking on top of the alignment.

Magnetococcus, a HNOB domain is fused, at its C-terminus, to an uncharacterized conserved globular domain
(Fig. 3). In animals the HNOB domain always occurs in
the N-terminal extension of SGCs. The phyletic pattern of
the HNOB domain suggests that it was most probably acquired early in the evolution of the animal lineage, via lateral transfer from a bacterial source. In order to test this
further, we used a multiple alignment of the HNOB domain (Fig. 1) to construct phylogenetic trees with the
neighbor joining, least squares and maximum-likelihood
methods. A consensus tree for the HNOB domain superfamily shows that the animal versions form a strong
monophyletic group (Fig. 3). Within the animals, there is
a small lineage specific expansion in the nematode lineage. SGCs with distinct α and β subunits appear to have
emerged in the coelomate lineage after its divergence from
the nematode lineage. In bacteria, the HNOB domains occurring in the chemotaxis receptors form a well-supported
monophyletic group, while the remaining standalone
forms are paraphyletic (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the solo versions from Nostoc and Anabaena species group strongly

with the animal SGC clade, supporting the origin of the
latter forms via horizontal transfer from a bacterial source
(Rell BP support 80%, 10000 replicates).
Genes, whose products closely interact with each other in
macromolecular complexes or biochemical pathways, often cluster together in prokaryotic genomes. These cofunctional gene clusters or operons often provide contextual information that may throw light on the functions of
uncharacterized proteins [31,32]. In order to obtain a better understanding of the HNOB domains, we analyzed the
neighborhoods of the genes encoding them in bacteria.
Genes encoding practically all the solo versions of the
HNOB domain occur in the same predicted operon as a
histidine kinase or a GGDEF domain (diguanylate cyclase) [33–35]. In some cases these operons also encode receiver domain proteins of the two component systems,
PP2C phosphatases or cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterases (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the histidine kinases from the
two cyanobacteria, and the GGDEF domain protein from
Rhodobacter, which co-occur with solo HNOB domain

Figure 3
Phylogenetic tree, domain architectures and gene neighborhoods of proteins containing HNOB domains. Internal branches with RELL Bootstrap support >80% are indicated with red circles. Selected gene neighborhoods of HNOB
domain proteins that provide contextual functional information are shown as box-arrows (The gene neighborhoods were
determined as explained in the methods). The HNOB domain encoding genes are all colored dark orange, while other genes in
the predicted operons are colored differently to match with the product they encode. All genes encoding proteins with a standalone HNOB domain are marked with red asterisks. Additionally, domain architectures are shown for all multidomain proteins with a HNOB domain and the products of their gene neighbors (latter are the indicated by green arrows). The globular
domains are drawn approximately to scale, but low complexity linker regions are not shown (indicated by the "//"). Protein
domain names generally follow accepted abbreviations. Additional domain abbreviations: TM: Transmembrane, MA: Methyl
accepting chemotaxis receptor domain, HD-GYP: predicted cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterase of the HD hydrolase superfamily, PP2C: PP2C-like phosphatase domain, HPT – Histidine Phosphotransfer domain, Receiver: Receiver domain of the two
component system, alpha-CRD is a previously, unidentified α-helical receptor domain, with conserved aspartates, that is found
in several prokaryotic chemotaxis receptors. C-helix: Conserved linker helix present at the C-terminus of the HNOBA
domain. Gene names and species abbreviations are as in figure 1.

proteins contain HNOBA domains at their extreme N-terminus (Fig. 3). Thus, even in the bacteria, the HNOBA domain always appears to function in association with the
HNOB domain. Given that these cyanobacterial HNOB
proteins are also the closest bacterial relatives of the
animal HNOB domains, it appears likely that the animal
lineage acquired a related assemblage of HNOB and
HNOBA domain as a single piece. Thus, the HNOB and

HNOBA domains resemble functionally similar CACHE
and CHASE domains, which have also been acquired by
certain eukaryotic lineages via lateral transfer from bacteria [14,36,37]. A phylogenetic analysis of the guanylyl cyclase domains of the animal SGCs shows that their closest
relatives are cyclases from various bacteria such cyanobacteria, and Leptospira (data not shown). Taken together,
these observations support a potential bacterial origin for

these components of the nitric oxide signaling pathway.
This is also consistent with the presence of orthologs of
the animal NO synthases in several bacteria [38,39].
The co-occurrence of the HNOB and the HNOBA domains in either the same protein or proteins encoded by
the same operon suggests a strong functional interaction
between them. Studies on the human SGC1 suggest that
the synthetic pyrazolopyridine ligand binds at site distinct
from NO and heme, but requires the heme-binding site
for its action [25,26]. This could imply a synergy or cooperation between these domains in heme interation and cyclase activation. Majority of the bacterial HNOB domain
proteins are predicted to covalently bind heme. Those versions that lack the heme-binding histidine might either
non-covalently interact with heme, as in the case of the
SGC α-subunits, or bind some other unknown ligand.
They are likely to function as sensors of diffusible gaseous
ligands that activate at least three distinct, downstream
signaling pathways: namely phosphotransfer through the
two-component systems, methyl ester-dependent chemotactic response and cyclic nucleotide signaling through the
diguanylate cyclases/phosphodiesterases. However, further experimental studies would be required to determine
if they function as NO or CO sensors, like the animal proteins, or as oxygen sensors.

Conclusions
Using sequence profile searches we identify two conserved
domains in the N-terminal extensions of the soluble guanylyl cyclases from animals. One of these, the HNOB domain, contains the heme-binding site of the SGCs and
defines a family of small-molecule binding domains exclusively occurring in animals and bacteria. In bacteria the
HNOB domain occurs either as a standalone version or
fused to the HAMP and methyl accepting domains of
chemotaxis receptors. The bacterial solo versions co-occur
in predicted operons encoding genes for two component
systems and diguanylate cyclases or phosphodiesterases,
and are likely to transmit signals to these downstream
molecules. The second conserved domain of SGCs, the
HNOBA domain is always associated with the HNOB domain either in the same polypeptide or in polypeptide encoded by neighboring genes in an operon. It is predicted
to adopt an α + β fold that is possibly related to the PASlike fold. The HNOB and HNOBA domains are likely to
function synergistically or cooperatively. The latter may
either cooperate in binding heme or might bind distinct
ligands.
The phyletic pattern of these domains, and phylogenetic
analysis of the HNOB domain suggest that the animal versions were probably acquired through lateral transfer
from a bacterial source. Identification of the HNOB and
HNOBA domains could help in further investigations of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/5

the SGCs that are critical components of the nitric oxide
signaling pathway in animals. Furthermore, investigating
their role in bacteria, such as Vibrio cholerae, could be important in understanding the sensory mechanisms of human pathogens.

Methods
The non-redundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda) was searched using the BLASTP and PSI-BLAST
programs [40]. Profile searches using the PSI-BLAST program were conducted either with a single sequence or an
alignment used as the query, with a profile inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01, and were iterated
until convergence. Multiple alignments were constructed
using the T_Coffee program [41], followed by manual
correction based on the PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment
as the input for the JPRED and PHD programs [42–44].
Preliminary clustering of proteins was done using the
BLASTCLUST program with empirically determined
length and score threshold cut off values (For
documentation see ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/README.bcl). Previously known, conserved domains were identified using PSI-BLAST derived profiles for
them, with the RPS-BLAST program [45]. Sequence-structure threading was performed using the 3DPSSM server
http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/. Gene neighborhoods were obtained by isolating all conserved genes, in
the neighborhood of the gene under consideration, which
showed a separation of less than 70 nucleotides between
their termini. Genes fulfilling this criterion and occurring
in the same direction were considered likely to form
operons.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor
joining or least square method followed by local rearrangements using the maximum likelihood algorithm to
predict the most likely tree. The robustness of tree topology was assessed with 10,000 Resampling of Estimated Log
Likelihoods (RELL) bootstrap replicates. The MOLPHY
and Phylip software packages were used for phylogenetic
analyses [46,47].
