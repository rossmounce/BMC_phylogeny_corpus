When Indian crabs were not yet Asian biogeographic evidence for Eocene proximity of
India and Southeast Asia
Sebastian Klaus1*, Christoph D Schubart2, Bruno Streit1, Markus Pfenninger1,3

Abstract
Background: The faunal and floral relationship of northward-drifting India with its neighboring continents is of
general biogeographic interest as an important driver of regional biodiversity. However, direct biogeographic
connectivity of India and Southeast Asia during the Cenozoic remains largely unexplored. We investigate timing,
direction and mechanisms of faunal exchange between India and Southeast Asia, based on a molecular phylogeny,
molecular clock-derived time estimates and biogeographic reconstructions of the Asian freshwater crab family
Gecarcinucidae.
Results: Although the Gecarcinucidae are not an element of an ancient Gondwana fauna, their subfamily
Gecarcinucinae, and probably also the Liotelphusinae, evolved on the Indian Subcontinent and subsequently
dispersed to Southeast Asia. Estimated by a model testing approach, this dispersal event took place during the
Middle Eocene, and thus before the final collision of India and the Tibet-part of Eurasia.
Conclusions: We postulate that the India and Southeast Asia were close enough for exchange of freshwater
organisms during the Middle Eocene, before the final Indian-Eurasian collision. Our data support geological models
that assume the Indian plate having tracked along Southeast Asia during its move northwards.

Background
The Indian Subcontinent has a biogeographic key position between Africa, Madagascar and Eurasia. It has
been involved in faunal exchange between the continents during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene by
either serving as a biotic ferry for a Gondwana fauna
[1-4], or as a target [5-7], stepping-stone [8,9] or source
[8,10] for dispersal. For all biogeographic scenarios
involving the Indian Subcontinent, the assumed geological setting is of major importance; especially the time of
fragmentation of Eastern Gondwana, the position of
Greater India on its move northwards relative to
the adjacent continents, and the timing of the IndianEurasian collision.
The standard geological view dates the IndianEurasian collision to the Paleocene/Early Eocene at 5055 Ma [11-13]. However, there is stringent evidence

from both geological data and plate modeling
approaches for a much later collision around 35 Ma,
preceded by collision with an intraoceanic island arc
around 55 Ma [14-17]. Ali and Aitchison [17] presented
two hypotheses on the location of India during its
Eocene northward movement. The first is based on the
motion path of the Indian Subcontinent according to
Schettino and Scotese [18] and assumes India in an isolated position until final contact with Tibet (Fig. 1B).
The second hypothesis, using the motion path of Acton
[19], reconstructs India in close proximity to Southeast
Asia from Eocene to Oligocene, possibly tracking along
Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and Burma, and allowing
terrestrial connections (Fig. 1A). Depending on which of
the two geological models fits better to the actual Indian
motion path, one should expect different biogeographic
and phylogenetic patterns as both models allow different
spatial and temporal dispersal pathways. In particular,
the geological history should be reflected by taxa with
limited marine dispersal capabilities, e.g., terrestrial nonvolant or limnic organisms.

Freshwater crabs are considered to be good indicators
of zoogeographic patterns [20]. Their ontogeny is completely independent from the marine realm, and they
are thought to be drainage basin specific [21,22].
Although freshwater crabs can to some extent be saltwater tolerant under laboratory conditions [23] and may
incidently have surmounted shorter marine passages by
rafting [24], there is no evidence for transoceanic longdistance dispersal of freshwater crabs [25,26].
The palaeotropic freshwater crab family Gecarcinucidae occurs from the Indian Subcontinent to Australia,
including tropical East Asia, the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos, the Moluccas and New Guinea [9,24].
This distribution pattern makes the Gecarcinucidae a
well suited model taxon to estimate timing, direction,
and possible mechanisms of faunal exchange between
Southeast Asia and India during the Cenozoic.
We construct a robust molecular phylogeny of the
Gecarcinucidae, provide molecular clock estimates and
use these data to reconstruct ancestral ranges. Specifically, we test the fit of the respective biological data to
the recently developed geological models of the IndianEurasian collision.

Results

these lineages have low support and differ between both
of our phylogenetic approaches. The Maximum Likelihood analysis supports the sister group relationship of
the genus Parathelphusa with the Malesian-Australian
group (in line with Klaus et al. [24]). Monophyletic and
well supported are two subfamilies, the Liotelphusinae
and the Parathelphusinae, while the third subfamily
Gecarcinucinae is paraphyletic (Fig. 2).
The time estimate for the root of the Gecarcinucidae
ranges from the Oligocene to the Cretaceous with a
95% highest posterior density credibility interval (HPD)
of 66.51-29.23 Ma. For biogeographic inference of the
early evolution of the Gecarcinucidae, two nodes are of
major importance: the most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) of the Liotelphusinae (95% HPD 46.63-16.85
Ma) and the MRCA of the Parathelphusinae (95% HPD
49.78-22.42 Ma), as at these nodes Indian and Southeast
Asian species split. The divergence time estimation for
both nodes shows a large 95% credibility interval. Therefore, we tested different temporal models that assume
divergence before, during or after the final Indian-Eurasian collision around 35 Ma. A Middle Eocene origin
for the MRCA of both Parathelphusinae and Liotelphusinae is strongly supported, thus most likely predating
the final Indian-Eurasian collision (Table 1).

0.1 Phylogenetic analyses and molecular clock estimates

The inferred phylogenetic topology of the Gecarcinucidae is congruent in all deeper splits to a previously published phylogeny [24]. Also our Maximum Likelihood
and Bayesian analyses do not conflict at the basal splits
within the Gecarcinucidae. Within the subfamily Parathelphusinae our analyses retrieve the lineages identified
by Klaus et al. [24], although the relationship between

The reconstruction of the ancestral range of the Gecarcinucidae according to the Bayesian inference of ancestral character states (BayesTraits) remains equivocal.
However, none of the present ancestral area reconstructions of the BayesTraits analysis has support over alternative reconstructions (log10 Bayes factor < 0.48). This

Testing of the temporal models with different time constraints in million years for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the subfamilies
Parathelphusinae (Para) and Liotelphusinae (Liot). The first three models (first row) constrain the age of both MRCAs before, during and after the assumed final
collision of India and Eurasia; the next four models assume different ages for the MRCA of Parathelphusinae and Liotelphusinae, i.e., either before or during
collision of plates, or during and after this event. The natural logarithm of the models posterior probabilities and its standard error, and the common logarithm
of the Bayes factor between models are given. Models in the left column are tested against the models in the first row (* substantial, ** strong, *** very strong
support for one model over another). The first model, constraining the MRCA of both subfamilies into the Middle Eocene (45 Ma), i.e., before the final IndianEurasian collision, is superior to all other models.

points out the necessity to test the significance of the
favoured reconstruction when using this method for
biogeographic purposes. Also dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) does not assign the root of the Gecarcinucidae unequivocally to one area, but assumes a
widespread range comprising both India and Southeast
Asia.
Therefore, we also applied a likelihood approach to
geographic range evolution based on dispersal, extinction and cladogenesis (DEC-model) to investigate if dispersal from India or from Southeast Asia can better
explain the present range patterns. Of the three different
dispersal-models calculated (Table 2), the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Akaike weight support the
HI!A-model (allowing only dispersal from India to Asia)
with a dispersal rate of 3.90 × 10 -3 and an extinction
rate of 3.19 × 10-4. Thus, dispersal from India to Southeast Asia gives the best explanation of the present data.
The resulting reconstruction is shown in Fig. 2.
The Indian Subcontinent consistently emerges in all
three biogeographic methods as the most likely ancestral
area of the MRCA of the subfamilies Gecarcinucinae
and Parathelphusinae. The Indian range is retained
throughout the paraphyletic Gecarcinucinae and passed
over to the Parathelphusinae, with the latter reaching
Southeast Asia only once. Within this parathelphusine
Southeast Asian clade a complex pattern of range evolution is reconstructed, with several transitions of the
Wallace Line.
For the MRCA of the Liotelphusinae the ancestral
range with the best likelihood value (according to the
DEC-model) comprises both Indian and Southeast Asian
areas (relative probability: 0.67). The Indian area is lost
in the ancestor of Lepidothelphusa cognetti, whereas the
Indian-Southeast Asian area was retained in the Liotelphusinae until the divergence of the genus Liotelphusa
(95% HPD 10.79-34.30 Ma). In contrast, DIVA reconstructs an Asian MRCA and secondary dispersal to
India followed by vicariance.

Discussion
In agreement with previous results [9,27], the present
data reject an early Gondwana distribution for the

Model

Different dispersal models for the Gecarcinucidae that were tested in
Lagrange to investigate the direction of faunal exchange between India and
Southeast Asia. Given are the global maximum likelihood at the root node,
the AIC, and the Akaike weight (w) of the respective dispersal models. The H0

Gecarcinucidae, both concerning tree topology and time
estimates. The Gondwana hypothesis for the Old World
freshwater crabs does not hold against the freshwater
crab fossil record (being not older than Oligocene/Miocene [28,29]), and is not in accordance with divergence
time estimates [27] and phylogenetic reconstructions
that do not reflect the break up of Eastern Gondwana
[9,24,27]. Moreover, the initial separation of western
(South America and Africa) and eastern Gondwana predates the first fossils of heterotreme marine brachyurans
by approximately 50 million years.
The hypothesis of an African origin of the Gecarcinucidae can not be validated with the present data. The
presumed dispersal to the Indian Subcontinent via
Madagascar and the Seychelles Bank during Oligocene
low sea level [9] can be rejected as the Gecarcinucidae
do not nest within a paraphyletic African Potamonautidae; in contrast, the freshwater crabs of Madagascar and
the Seychelles are monophyletic with the Potamonautidae. Also the estimated divergence times of the most
basal splits within the Gecarcinucidae are likely to predate the Oligocene. Nevertheless, the age of separation
between East African Deckenia mitis and Seychellum
alluaudi from the Seychelles (95% HPD 26.88-8.08 Ma)
and the age of the deepest split within the potamonautid
subfamily Deckeniinae (95% HPD 48.54-19.29 Ma) do
not conflict with the hypothesis of these Oligocene stepping stones. These could have enabled independent
colonization of Madagascar and the Seychelles from
Africa, as it was already proposed for amphibians and
cichlid fishes [30,31], and is additionally supported by
the reconstruction of Paleogene ocean currents [32].
The age of the root of the present phylogeny, and the
estimated age of the Gecarcinucidae fit very well into
the period of intensive brachyuran radiation, i.e., Upper
Cretaceous to Early Eocene, that is apparent from the
fossil record [33]. We hypothesize that during this time
span the marine ancestor of the Old World freshwater
crabs might have invaded the limnic habitat from the
ancient Tethys Ocean. According to our biogeographic
reconstruction, at least for the clade [Gecarcinucinae +
Parathelphusinae], this transition occurred most likely at
the shores of the Indian Subcontinent.
The results of the temporal model testing indicate that
the separation of Indian and Southeast Asian species
within the subfamily Parathelphusinae more likely
occurred in the Middle Eocene than in the Oligocene,
and according to the biogeographic reconstructions, the
Indian subcontinent was by far more likely the area of
origin for both Gecarcinucinae and Parathelphusinae
than Southeast Asia. Provided that the final collision of
India and the Tibet-part of Eurasia took place in the
Late Eocene [16], we must either assume that gecarcinucid freshwater crabs surmounted a marine barrier to

Klaus et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/287

reach Southeast Asia, or that a land connection between
India and Southeast Asia existed. As transoceanic long
distance dispersal of freshwater crabs appears highly
unlikely [25,26], we conclude that India and Southeast
Asia were at least very close. An early to Middle Eocene
exchange of freshwater organisms is best explained by
the Indian motion path of Acton [17,19] which implies
direct contact of plates and probably would allow terrestrial connections (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the position of
the Indian Subcontinent based on Schettino and Scotese
[17,18] hypothesizes an open marine strait of about 500
km between the Indian plate and Eurasia (Fig. 1B). In
fact, the exact position of western Southeast Asia during
the Eocene, decisive for the present considerations, is
not definitively solved and could be placed slightly eastward (J.R. Ali, pers. comm.). As in the Parathelphusinae,
a Middle Eocene age for the MRCA of the Liotelphusinae is the preferred model, also predating the IndianEurasian collision. According to the DEC-model of
range evolution the MRCA inhabited both Indian and
Southeast Asian areas, while DIVA and the BayesTraits
analysis favours a Southeast Asian origin (with the reservation that the latter is not superior to alternative
reconstructions, see above). Several scenarios could
explain this pattern: The liotelphusine ancestor could
have had a widespread range comprising India and
Southeast Asia during the Middle Eocene, as reconstructed in Lagrange. This would fit to the geological
model that assumes contiguity of the Indian plate and
Southeast Asia during that time. Alternatively, early
diverging Indian representatives are not sampled in the
present data set or could have gone extinct, raising the
possibility that the ancestor of the genus Liotelphusa
dispersed back to the Indian Subcontinent after the final
Indian-Asian collision. Also, an independent colonization of the freshwater habitat can not be excluded with
certainty. To solve the history of this subfamily with
confidence, a larger sampling of the enigmatic Indian
liotelphusine species will be necessary. Eocene faunal
exchange between India and Southeast Asia could not
only be facilitated by the paleogeographic proximity of
the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia, but also
favored by equal climatic conditions. As indicated by
coal deposits, both areas most probably have been dominated by closed-canopy megathermal rain forests during
the Early Eocene, and displayed an everwet tropical climate [8,34]. This Indian-Southeast Asian moist corridor
was already assumed to enable dispersal of Indian floral
elements into Southeast Asia, corroborated by palynological evidence [8,34,35].
Several Asian faunal or floral elements are claimed to
be Gondwana relics, entering Asia via the northwards
drifting Indian Subcontinent, i.e., the ‘’out-of-India’ scenario [2,4,36]. These comprise ranoid and hyloid frogs

Page 5 of 9

[37,38], gymnophionans [39,40], agamid lizards [41],
cichlids [42], aplocheiloid fishes [43], the Asian arowana
[44], Crypteroniaceae [45] and Dipterocarpaceae [46,47].
In contrast, we present here for the first time evidence
that the Gecarcinucidae, a taxon that is definitely not a
Gondwana element, originated on the Indian Subcontinent, at least with the subfamily Gecarcinucidae, and
dispersed into Southeast Asia during the Middle
Eocene.
The early range evolution of gecarcinucid freshwater
crabs exemplifies that the recently developed geological
models of the Indian-Eurasian convergence are generally
in accordance with biogeography [17]. Very likely this
direct Eocene biotic exchange between India and Southeast Asia, possibly in both directions, accounts for the
distribution patterns of a large set of organisms and
probably contributed profoundly to the vast biodiversity
of present South and Southeast Asia.

Conclusions
The Asian freshwater crab family Gecarcinucidae most
probably originated on the Indian Subcontinent and dispersed secondarily into Southeast Asia. Within the subfamilies Gecarcinucinae and Liotelphusinae Indian and
Southeast Asian species split in the Middle Eocene,
before the final Indian-Eurasian collision. We postulate
that the Indian plate and Southeast Asia were close
enough for exchange of freshwater organisms during
that period. Our data support geological models that
assume the Indian plate having tracked along Southeast
Asia during its move northwards.
Methods
0.3 Phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating

Gene sequences of the nuclear encoded histone H3 gene
and the partial mitochondrial 16 S rDNA were retrieved
from Genbank and originated from previous studies on
the phylogeny of the Gecarcinucidae (AM234635,
AM234637, AM234640, AM234641, AM234651,
AM234653, AM292919[9]), (FM180114-FM180181,
FM178885-FM178951[24]); and the African Potamonautidae (AY042249[21]), (AY803554, AY803710,
AY803690, AY919081, AY919086-AY919088, AY919126,
AY919129, AY919132, AY919135[27]).
Our study includes 57 gecarcinucid species of 31 genera. These genera (55% of the gecarcinucid genus-level
diversity) cover 60% of the currently recognized gecarcinucid species. As a sub-sample of the mitochondrial
data given by Klaus et al. [24], the present study
includes representatives of all gecarcinucid clades covering their whole range (Fig. 3). Only East Asian species
are not included. However, these are closely related with
the Southeast Asian genera Sayamia and Siamthelphusa
that are included here [24].

encoding of the biogeographic analyses (yellow: India; red: Southeast Asia; green: Philippines; blue: Wallacea, New Guinea, Australia). Numbers
correspond to the numbering of specimens in Fig. 2. For five specimens, originating from older collections or from the aquarium trade, only
approximate locations are known, and thus are not shown here.

As outgroups we included species of the other two
Old World freshwater crab families, the Eurasian-North
African Potamidae and the African-Madagascan Potamonautidae. Sequences were separated in two partitions,
one for the H3 gene (318 bp) and one for the 16 S
rDNA (558 bp), resulting in a total sequence length of
875 bp. Alignment was done with ClustalW [48] as
implemented in the software BioEdit 7.0.9.0 [49] and
adjusted manually.
A maximum likelihood analysis was conducted in the
software RaxML 7.0.3 [50] with the alignment partitioned for the 16 S rDNA gene and all three codon
positions of the H3 gene. A GTR+I+gamma model of
sequence evolution was used for the final maximum
likelihood search, as suggested by the AIC in jModelTest 0.1.1 [51], while for rapid bootstrapping (103 replicates) CAT approximation of rate heterogeneity is
implemented in RaxML [52]. For Bayesian phylogenetic
analysis and estimation of divergence times both partitions were unlinked and analysed in the software
BEAST 1.5.2 [53]. After a preliminary series of test runs,
the following models showed to fit best to the data: a
relaxed, uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model
[54], a Yule tree prior, and a GTR+I+gamma model of
sequence evolution. We ran the Markov chain for 108
generations, sampling 106 trees and discarding the first
105 as burn-in. Convergence of the Markov chain was
investigated with Tracer 1.5 [55].
To estimate divergence times we conducted two Bayesian analyses under the above conditions, one with fossil

calibration points and one with a discrete rate of evolution for the 16 S rDNA. We used three fossil calibration
points: the oldest known potamid Potamon quenstedti
found in South Germany, that we assume to be closer
related to the Mediterranean Potamon fluviatile than to
the Near East Potamon persicum (node P. fluviatile - P.
persicum; c. 16.5 Ma [29]), a fossil of Potamonautes that
was assigned to P. niloticus (node P. niloticus - Platythelphusa armata; 6 Ma [56]) and a claw fragment
from the Siwalik beds in northern India related to the
genus Sartoriana [29]. As the fossil site is situated
within the range of extant S. spinigera, and far from S.
blanfordi occurring in Pakistan (Balochistan) and Afghanistan, we assume a closer relationship with S. spinigera
(node S. spinigera - S. blanfordi; Gecarcinucidae, 2.5 Ma
[29]). To incorporate temporal uncertainty and expecting the MRCA at the respective nodes to predate the
fossils, we assumed a gamma-distribution for the calibration points with the respective age as lower cut-off
value and shape parameters of 4.0, 2.0 and 3.0 respectively. These different values for the shape parameter
reflect different degrees of uncertainty of the exact age
and taxonomic assignment of the fossils. Although the
values have to be chosen arbitrarily, this approach is
considered to be much more reliable than assuming a
uniform or normal prior probability distribution for the
nodes’ ages [57]. The default value (1.0) for the scale
factor was used.
We compared the results with the second analysis
using a discretized relaxed molecular clock model

Klaus et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/287

(uncorrelated lognormal) with a rate of evolution for the
16 S rDNA partition of 0.88% per Ma (10% SD). This
rate was calibrated for Jamaican sesarmids based on the
closure of the Isthmus of Panama [58]. We calculated
the Bayes factor between the calibrated and the discretized molecular clock model. The Bayes factor is the
ratio of the marginal likelihoods between two hypotheses, whereby the marginal likelihoods are here estimated in Tracer. A common logarithm of the Bayes
factor (log10 BF) larger than 0.48 indicates substantial,
over 1.00 strong and above 1.48 very strong support for
the respective hypothesis [59]. The comparison of the
two hypotheses strongly supports the calibrated model
of sequence evolution (log 10 BF 1.69), thus giving an
independent confirmation of the adequateness of the
used fossil calibration points. The sesarmid rate of 16 S
rDNA evolution (0.88% per Ma) nevertheless falls within
the 95% HPD credibility interval of the 16 S rDNA rate
of the calibrated model (0.64%-1.42% per Ma; mean
value 1.02% per Ma). The 95% HPD of the rate of histone H3 is 0.12-0.26% per Ma with a mean of 0.19%.
0.4 Biogeographic analyses

To reconstruct ancestral ranges the maximum clade
credibility tree inferred by the fossil calibrated model of
Bayesian inference was used as phylogenetic input for
DIVA and the DEC-model. The Bayesian approach was
conducted with 10 3 post-burn-in trees to account for
uncertainty in phylogenetic reconstruction. The gecarcinucid species were assigned to one of four discrete geographic areas: (a) the Indian Subcontinent, (b) Southeast
Asia, including the Larger Sunda Islands that are situated on the continental shelf, (c) the Philippines, and (d)
the gecarcinucid range east of the Wallace Line (Figs. 2
and 3). We did not take into account the distribution
data of the outgroups, the potamoid families Potamidae
and Potamonautidae. We have a fundamental reservation against inclusion of these to infer gecarcinucid biogeography. As long as the marine relatives of the
Potamoidea remain unknown we can not exclude independent colonization of the limnic habitat by each potamoid family and consequent paraphyly of the
Potamoidea. Thus we removed for the subsequent biogeographic analyses the outgroup taxa from the maximum clade credibility tree in Mesquite 2.72 [60].
Dispersal-vicariance analysis as implemented in the
software DIVA [61] was conducted with maximally 103
alternative reconstructions kept at each node and the
maximum number of ancestral areas left unconstrained.
We are aware of the pitfalls and limitations of eventbased biogeographic methods and consider this analysis
as explorative [62,63]. We further analysed the data with
a Bayesian approach to character evolution in BayesTraits
multistate [64]. We let the analysis run for 5 × 10 7

Page 7 of 9

generations, sampling 5 × 104 generations and discarding
the first 5 × 103 samples as burn-in. To specify the range
of values used to seed the prior distribution, we applied
an exponential hyperprior with the mean from 0 to 80
and a rate deviation value of 0.1, resulting in a mean
acceptance rate of 33.4% (SD = 8.6). We examined at
each node if there is support for one area over another:
we constrained the ancestral state of the node to one
area and compared the harmonic means (an estimator of
marginal likelihoods) between runs under different constraints by calculating the Bayes factor between them. As
harmonic means can be unstable we repeated each run
five times. To test for the direction of gecarcinucid dispersal we applied a parametric DEC approach [65,66] as
implemented in the software Lagrange vers. 20091004
[67]. We calculated three models of gecarcinucid range
evolution: an unconstrained hypothesis (H 0 ), a model
with only dispersal from India to Asia enabled (HI!A),
and a third model allowing only dispersal from Asia to
India (HA!I). We compared the resulting global maximum likelihoods at the root node and the AIC and
Akaike weight between models (Table 2). For all three
analyses the root age was set to the mean root age (47.23
Ma), adjacency of India with the Philippine range and the
area East of the Wallace Line was restricted, and the rate
parameters for dispersal and extinction were estimated
by Lagrange.
0.5 Timing of the Indian-Southeast Asian faunal exchange

To approximate the timing of faunal exchange between
India and Southeast, and to investigate if Indian and
Southeast Asian species split before, during or after the
final collision of India and Eurasia, we applied a model
testing approach [59]. We set different time constraints
for the basal nodes of the subfamilies Liotelphusinae
and Parathelphusinae (where Indian and Southeast
Asian species separate) and tested several hypotheses
against each other: an Oligocene (25 Ma), Late Eocene
(35 Ma) and Middle Eocene (45 Ma) age of the liotelphusine and parathelphusine MRCA. In addition, we
calculated four models with the MRCAs of both subfamilies constrained to different ages, addressing the possibility that the two splits were not contemporaneous:
before and during continental collision (45 and 35 Ma)
and during and after this event (35 and 25 Ma). Not all
theoretically possible combinations of time constraints
could be calculated, as the initial tree likelihood in the
Bayesian analyses dropped to zero (indicating that the
respective prior model assumptions strongly contradict
the data). We assumed a standard deviation of 20% to
account for general temporal uncertainty. These time
constraints (45, 35 and 25 Ma) fall within the 95% HPD
credibility interval of the nodes’ age estimates of the
unconstrained analysis, and correspond to the time

points for which paleogeographical reconstructions are
given by Ali and Aitchison [17]. The constrained Bayesian analyses were conducted as described previously
applying the calibrated relaxed molecular clock model.
To evaluate the different hypotheses we calculated the
Bayes factor between them in Tracer (Table 1).
