Dynamic distribution patterns of ribosomal DNA
and chromosomal evolution in Paphiopedilum,
a lady’s slipper orchid
Tianying Lan and Victor A Albert*

Abstract
Background: Paphiopedilum is a horticulturally and ecologically important genus of ca. 80 species of lady’s slipper
orchids native to Southeast Asia. These plants have long been of interest regarding their chromosomal evolution,
which involves a progressive aneuploid series based on either fission or fusion of centromeres. Chromosome
number is positively correlated with genome size, so rearrangement processes must include either insertion or
deletion of DNA segments. We have conducted Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) studies using 5S and 25S
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probes to survey for rearrangements, duplications, and phylogenetically-correlated variation
within Paphiopedilum. We further studied sequence variation of the non-transcribed spacers of 5S rDNA (5S-NTS) to
examine their complex duplication history, including the possibility that concerted evolutionary forces may
homogenize diversity.
Results: 5S and 25S rDNA loci among Paphiopedilum species, representing all key phylogenetic lineages, exhibit a
considerable diversity that correlates well with recognized evolutionary groups. 25S rDNA signals range from 2
(representing 1 locus) to 9, the latter representing hemizygosity. 5S loci display extensive structural variation, and
show from 2 specific signals to many, both major and minor and highly dispersed. The dispersed signals mainly
occur at centromeric and subtelomeric positions, which are hotspots for chromosomal breakpoints. Phylogenetic
analysis of cloned 5S rDNA non-transcribed spacer (5S-NTS) sequences showed evidence for both ancient and
recent post-speciation duplication events, as well as interlocus and intralocus diversity.
Conclusions: Paphiopedilum species display many chromosomal rearrangements - for example, duplications,
translocations, and inversions - but only weak concerted evolutionary forces among highly duplicated 5S arrays,
which suggests that double-strand break repair processes are dynamic and ongoing. These results make the genus
a model system for the study of complex chromosomal evolution in plants.

Background
Paphiopedilum, a genus of approximately 80 species indigenous to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia, is
among the most widely grown and hybridized of all orchids. Species of Paphiopedilum are also ecologically important narrow endemics in various mainland and island
habitats, which range from montane rainforest to seaside
cliffs [1]. Karyological studies of Paphiopedilum have
revealed considerable chromosomal variation, which ranges
from 2n = 26 to 2n = 42, in aneuploid increments suggestive of centric fission [2]. Basic molecular phylogenetic

information on the genus is available [3]. Subgenus
Parvisepalum, which is sister to the rest of the genus, has
2n = 26 metacentric chromosomes, whereas the type subgenus Paphiopedilum includes both clades of 2n = 26 species and two distinct lineages of species that bear greater
than 26 chromosomes, with the number of telocentrics
equal to twice the number of metacentrics that ostensibly
split [3]. Haploid genome size is extremely large in these
orchids, ranging from 16.1 to 35.1 megabases (Mb) [4].
Chromosome number has been shown to be positively correlated with genome size [4], so rearrangement processes
must include either insertion or deletion of DNA segments.
General issues in plant chromosomal evolution
include the contribution of rearrangements to genome

structure and size. Rearrangement processes involve
double-strand break repair, which occurs frequently at
hotspots in pericentromeric and telomeric regions [5,6].
Gene duplications may be caused by unequal crossing
over, retrotransposition, or genome duplication [7]. Tandem repeats duplication or segmental duplication is one
of the possible outcomes of unequal crossing over [7,8].
These phenomena may be investigated empirically
through use of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
(FISH) on highly repetitive DNA loci subject to concerted evolution, such as the 18S-5.8S-25S (45S) and 5S
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays, which may show duplication or evidence for rearrangement-producing heterologous recombination [9]. Infrageneric comparative
rDNA FISH analyses, in which mobility and patterning
have been systematically investigated as species-specific
karyotype markers, are common in the literature
[10-14]. We use such analyses here to document chromosomal dynamics in Paphiopedilum. FISH has been
applied previously to Paphiopedilum, but in a limited
manner only, and especially in hybrids [15,16].
Both 45S and 5S rDNAs in plants are characterized by
intergenic spacers. 5S rDNA non-transcribed spacer (5SNTS) sequences have seen some use as phylogenetic markers [17-21]. However, most studies of 5S-NTS to-date
have employed direct sequencing of PCR products, and
there is evidence that the NTS both within and among
arrays can show polymorphism. We have cloned 5S-NTS
segments in Paphiopedilum in order to study past and
ongoing gene duplication events and the possibility of
gene conversion both within arrays and among duplicated
loci.
We briefly report distribution patterns of rDNA signals
from a phylogenetic systematic perspective [22] according
to accepted section-level classification. We do not aim to
provide complete karyotypic comparisons, nor a full cytotaxonomic treatment; rather, we concern ourselves with
demonstrable evidence for dynamic rearrangements during the evolution of Paphiopedilum. 5S-NTS sequence
data are also compared with a phylogenetic hypothesis in
order to ascertain duplication history of paralogs.

Section Parvisepalum

Section Parvisepalum is the sister group of all other
Paphiopedilum species (Figure 1). Two to four 25S
rDNA signals are apparent (Figure 2) among 2n = 26
chromosomes, with two signals most parsimoniously
interpretable as the basal condition since this state is
shared by the outgroup genera Mexipedium and Phragmipedium (unpublished data; [23]). With 2 signals being

the inferred primitive condition, rearrangement by duplication is observed in Paphiopedilum armeniacum,
P. emersonii and P. hangianum, which have more loci. 5S
rDNA patterns are stable, showing 2 subtelomeric signals
that are usually closely linked with one pair of 25S signals
(Table 1). In P. delenatii, translocation of either the 5S or
25S rDNA locus has occurred. This phenomenon is also
seen in P. malipoense, with its two chromosomes that
show hemizygous 25S and 5S rDNA signals, respectively.
Section Concoloria

Species of section Concoloria show two 25S and 5S signals
(Table 1), each on separate chromosomes (2n = 26 total),
similarly to Paphiopedilum delenatii of section Parvisepalum, except in that the 5S signals are interstitially instead
of subtelomerically placed (Figure 3).
Section Cochlopetalum

Section Cochlopetalum displays an aneuploid number of
chromosomes, the telocentrics of which have been suggested to descend via centric fission from 25 diploid
metacentrics [2]. According to phylogenetic relationships
known at present (Figure 1), and the centric fission
hypothesis, sections Cochlopetalum and Barbata (with
telocentrics descended from 26 diploid metacentrics)
have evolved aneuploid increase independently. All four
species studied here have two telomeric 25S rDNA signals, and 4 major 5S rDNA signals (Figure 4; Table 1).

same chromosome in the 2n = 34 species P. moquettianum (Figure 4B) and P. victoria-regina (Figure 4D).
Section Paphiopedilum

All 5 species of section Paphiopedilum studied show two
25S signals in the telomeric region (Figure 5; Table 1). All
species, which are 2n = 26 except for P. druryi (Figure 5E)
at 2n = 30, show at least 2 specific 5S rDNA bands, as
many as 6, and numerous dispersed signals in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions. In all but P. druryi the
major signals are closely linked with the 25S arrays. In
P. druryi, 4 of the major signals appear to be located on
different arms and on morphologically different chromosomes that may only be partly homologous (this condition
was observed in at least 4 cells).
Sections Coryopedilum and Pardalopetalum

In current phylogenetic results, section Pardalopetalum is
derived within section Coryopedilum (Figure 1); as such,
they will be discussed together here. Together, the Coryopedilum/Pardalopetalum clade, all species having 2n = 26,
is the most dynamic in Paphiopedilum regarding chromosomal rearrangements (Figure 6, 7; Table 1). 25S signals
vary from 2 to 9, the latter showing hemizygosity. Signals

Page 6 of 15

in all species except Paphiopedilum lowii (Figure 7A),
P. adductum (Figure 6E) and P. randsii (Figure 6F) are
telomeric. 1-4 subtelomeric 25S signals were observed
in P. lowii, P. adductum and P. randsii. In P. supardii
(Figure 6G), one hemizygous chromosome has telomeric
25S signals on each arm. P. adductum also shows 25S
hemizygosity, and both this species and P. supardii show
the maximum number of signals. Species of the Coryopedilum/Pardalopetalum group show at least 4 major 5S
rDNA signals (up to 8 in P. parishii (Figure 7B)) and multiple dispersed repeats in pericentromeric and centromeric
regions. In the Pardalopetalum group, all species show at
least 2 strong (up to 5) 5S bands located on one chromosome. Close linkage with 25S occurs throughout the
group, other than in P. sanderianum (Figure 6A), either
with major or minor 5S bands, and appearing in different
placements along chromosome arms.
Section Barbata

Species of section Barbata, which have 2n = 28-42 and the
largest genome sizes, show constancy in 25S rDNA distribution, with 2 telomeric signals (Figure 8; Table 1). Major
5S signals number 2-4, and extremely few dispersed

repeats were observed. Most 5S loci are not centromeric,
whereas telomeric, subtelomeric, pericentromeric, and
interstitial placements are observed. Only Paphiopedilum
curtisii (Figure 8G) and P. hennisianum(Figure 8B) have
two major 5S signals, and the first species shows no dispersed repeats. P. sukhakulii (Figure 8C), P. venustum

(Figure 8F) and P. wardii (Figure 8A) show linked 5S signals. Only in P. venustum is close linkage of 25S and 5S
observed, and then only involving a minor 5S band.
Because Barbata is the most derived section in the genus
(Figure 1), either its species have lost 25S and 5S rDNA
loci, since Cochlopetalum, Paphiopedilum, Coryopedilum,

and Pardalopetalum usually have more, or the species of
the latter sections have increased the number of rDNA
loci independently given the low number in sections Parvisepalum and Concoloria.
Diversity of 5S ribosomal DNA non-transcribed spacer
sequences

We investigated duplication history correlated with the
dynamic rearrangements observed in 5S rDNA loci. In
order to survey sequence variation in 5S-NTS, random
clones, 7 (Paphiopedilum niveum) or 8 (all others) per

species, were sequenced (Additional file 1). Only a few
clones were identical to each other (2 sequences from
P. acmodontum, 2 from P. henryanum, 2 from P. hirsutissimum, 2 from P. stonei, 4 from P. dayanum, 4 from
P. malipoense, and one sequence each of P. stonei and
P. supardii). Sequences of 5S-NTS ranged from 283 bp
(P. micranthum 1) to 455 bp (P. bellatulum 5). Given
extensive sequence divergence of 5S-NTS and our desire
not to manually adjust alignment [24], an objective alignment was accomplished using MAFFT and default settings.

phylogenetic relationships, were assessed in order to estimate the strength of gene conversion and the extent of
paralogy, respectively. Numbers of polymorphic sites within
species positively correlated with minimum numbers of

visible 5S signals (P < 0.01, R^2 = 0.21; Figure 9), suggesting
that interlocus gene conversion is relatively weak. A phylogenetic tree outgroup-rooted using Phragmipedium besseae

versus the remainder of the genus. The single tree of maximum likelihood is shown (as a phylogram, Additional
file 2), as is the majority-rule consensus tree based on
100 bootstrap replicates (Additional file 3). Some large species-specific clades were observed, as well as some sectionspecific clades. Overall, however, the phylogenetic tree was
poorly representative of phylogenetic relationships due to
extensive duplication of 5S loci.

Discussion
Variation in numbers and chromosomal locations of rDNA

Variation in numbers and distribution patterns of rDNA
loci among related species is commonly observed in
many different plant genera, including Brassicaceae [10],
Cyperaceae [11], Asteraceae [25,26], Leguminosae [27],
Pinus [28], and Rosaceae [14]. Plants typically show
some degree of conservatism of rDNA repeat duplication, such that when multiple loci do appear, species are
commonly polyploid relatives of diploids. There is no
evidence at all, however, for polyploidy in Paphiopedilum, where the only chromosome number differences
are aneuploid, in a series reflective of centric fission or
fusion.
In general, FISH patterns of 25S rDNA loci are
reported to be more polymorphic than those of the 5S
rDNA [12-14,26,28-32]. Conversely, in all sections of
Paphiopedilum, except for Parvisepalum and Concoloria,
5S rDNA sites showed much more variability both in
number and physical location than did 25S rDNA sites.
The most parsimonious ancestral number of 25S
rDNA sites in Paphiopedilum is two, based on outgroup
comparison to the genera Mexipedium and Phragmipedium (unpublished results; [3,22]). Duplication of 25S
rDNA sites was observed only in three of the seven sections of Paphiopedilum: Parvisepalum (2n = 26),

Page 10 of 15

Coryopedilum (2n = 26) and Pardalopetalum (2n = 26)
(Table 1). The physical positions of 25S rDNA loci are
relatively conservative. In most Paphiopedilum species
we analyzed, 25S rDNA signals are located in terminal
chromosome positions. Variation was only observed in
three species, Paphiopedilum adductum, P. randsii and
P. lowii, which showed 1-4 subtelomeric 25S rDNA signals (Figures 6E, F and 7A, respectively). The ancestral
number of 5S rDNA sites, again by outgroup comparison, is 2 (unpublished results from Mexipedium and
Phragmipedium), and is only observed in sections Parvisepalum and Concoloria. Massive duplication and amplification of 5S rDNA loci, leading to large-scale
polymorphism of numbers, sizes and physical positions
of signals, was found prevalent in the remaining five
sections. The numbers and distribution of rDNA loci
vary widely among plants; however, usually less than
one-third of chromosomes display either 45S rDNA or
5S rDNA [13]. It is therefore noteworthy that in some
lineages of Paphiopedilum, up to 24 of the 26 chromosomes bear at least one rDNA locus, and a single chromosome can bear up to five major 5S rDNA loci.
Apparently, there is no strong correlation between the
increase in the number of rDNA sites and the increase in
the number of chromosomes or genome size. A similar
situation has also been described in many other diploid
species, e.g. the diploid lineage of Brassicaceae [10],
Cyperaceae [11,12], Iris [13], and Rosaceae [14]. The
massive duplication of rDNA loci in Paphiopedilum sections Cochlopetalum, Paphiopedilum, Coryopedilum and
Pardalopetalum could partly contribute to the increase
of genome size. Perhaps paradoxically, species with the
smallest (P. exul; section Paphiopedilum) and largest
(P. dianthum; section Pardalopetalum) haploid genome
sizes are both members of groups that show considerable
25S and 5S locus duplication in our FISH experiments.
These two species differ more than two-fold in genome
size, 16.1 to 35.1 Mb, respectively [33]. If we assume that
the number of distinct genes among Paphiopedilum species is roughly constant, this would suggest that genome
size increase is primarily due to repetitive element amplification, but that since rDNA duplication is associated
with both smaller and larger genomes in the genus, size
differences may be more logically traceable to other repetitive DNAs, such as mobile elements. However, a possible tendency for elimination of rDNA loci was found in
section Barbata, which has the greatest average genome
sizes and chromosome numbers [4]. The number of 25S
rDNA loci in Barbata remains two through all the species we studied, while the distribution pattern of 5S
rDNA is less dispersed than its sister group, Coryopedilum plus Pardalopetalum. Due to the derived phylogenetic position of section Barbata (Figure 1), it is most
parsimonious to conclude that unique chromosomal

Lan and Albert BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:126
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/126

conditions seen in the group would be similarly derived
(autapomorphic). As such, centric fission in Barbata
appears to be associated with loss of rDNA loci, while in
other systems, centric fission has led to rDNA gains [34].
Elimination of rDNA loci during chromosomal evolution
has been documented in, e.g., Brassicaceae and Rosaceae
[10,14]. The mechanism that accounts for such loss of
rDNA loci, however, remains unclear. A presumed evolutionary loss of abundant terminal nucleolar organizing
regions (NOR) in Arabidopsis has been hypothesized to
be the consequence of an ancient fusion event [35]. In
the case of section Barbata, additional traceable chromosome markers are needed to provide further evidence
that chromosomal rearrangements are related to rDNA
loss.
A combination of different mechanisms causes high
mobility of rDNA

Different mechanisms have been postulated to account
for the mobility and polymorphism of numbers, sizes and
positions of rDNA sites, such as transposon-mediated
transpositional events [36-38], and chromosome rearrangements (translocation, inversion, duplication, deletion)
caused by homologous or non-homologous unequal
crossing-over and gene conversion [9,28,30,36]. These
processes could act alone or in combination, and they do
not necessarily imply changes in overall chromosome
morphology [31,34].
The great degree of 5S repeat dispersion seen in sections
Cochlopetalum, Paphiopedilum, Coryopedilum and Pardalopetalum has, to our knowledge, only been observed in
the monocots Alstroemeria, Tulipa, and Iris [13,39,40].
The original seeding of rDNA repeats to ectopic locations
in the genome could be the result of transposable element
activity or perhaps incorporation of array segments into
breakpoints as part of non-homologous end joining during
DNA repair. Indeed, some of the signals we observed may
be pseudogenes transported within the genomes by retroelements, therefore leading to the false interpretation that
we are visualizing entire and active rDNA arrays. Both
subtelomeric and pericentromeric regions are well known
as hot spots of breakpoints and are also enriched for TEs
[5,6]. Considering the abundant minor loci we observed in
these regions, a contribution of transpositions to the dispersed distribution pattern is tenable, and TEs containing
5S rDNA-derived sequences have in fact been observed in
many plants [41] and animals [42]. It is nonetheless possible that due to the similarity of rDNA arrays, chromosomal rearrangement could be induced via heterologous
recombination, and in turn, rearrangement could generate
repeated sequences through unequal crossovers. After
generation of a novel locus, in situ amplification cycles via
rearrangement could lead to the origin of FISH-detectable
loci. Furthermore, hemizygous 5S rDNA sites have been

Page 11 of 15

widely observed in many Paphiopedilum species. A double-strand break occurring in a hemizygous region would
increase the probability of causing other rearrangements,
owing to the absence of a homologous template for its
repair [5]. The lack of dispersed repeats in the basalmost
section Parvisepalum may reflect either a lack of seeding
events or slow amplification processes that do not yield
hybridization-visible arrays. However, in the case of 5S
rDNA, there is in fact strong evidence for NTS sequence
diversity, which could either be accounted for by the presence or small loci below the FISH detection limit or perhaps by considerable within-array diversity. One future
experimental approach to determine whether considerable
intra-array diversity indeed exists would be to perform
FISH using 5S-NTS-specific probes.
Diversification of 25S rDNA distribution patterns is also
observed in Paphiopedilum, but the numbers of loci and
degree of dispersion is much lower than for 5S rDNA.
Therefore, 5S rDNA might be more frequently seeded by
TEs via transpositional events, or, amplification or maintenance of 5S rDNA loci via rearrangement could be more
effective and tolerated during the chromosome evolution
process. The different evolutionary tendencies between
25S and 5S rDNA might be caused by their function and
sequence divergence or localization in distinct nuclear
compartments [43].
5S-NTS sequences highlight interlocus and intralocus
diversity and weak concerted evolutionary forces

Previous studies of other angiosperm species have suggested that intralocus 5S rDNA diversity occurs. Withinarray 5S rDNA diversity appears very likely in Paphiopedilum as well, since many species (e.g., all Parvisepalum and
Concoloria) have only one observable 5S locus. For example, 6 species of section Parvisepalum are represented in
our phylogenetic analysis by 6-8 distinct sequence variants.
These 5S-NTS variants can be concluded to occur within
at least partial arrays, pseudogenized or not, since the
amplified pieces include sections of 5S rDNA at their 5’
and 3’ ends. Recent within-species duplication events may
be indicated by single-species clades of 5S-NTS sequences,
such as P. dayanum, P. lowii, P. sangii, but these could
just as well indicate within-array variation, as single-species clades of Parvisepalum (e.g., P. malipoense) and Concoloria (P. bellatulum) most likely do. In many cases, it
can be readily seen that duplication of 5S loci has occurred
prior to speciation, for example, within Coryopedilum (a
large group of sequences representing P. sanderianum,
P. stonei, and P. supardii; similarly also within a group of
P. adductum and P. randsii sequences). In some cases,
ancient duplications must be much older than the major
phylogenetic groups of Paphiopedilum, since, for example,
P. delenatii shares sequence variants similar to other
Parvisepalum species yet has at least one other variant

Lan and Albert BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:126
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/126

that is more similar to sequences from all other sections.
We investigated the possibility of contamination regarding
this finding, but discovered similar repeats across 8
distinct P. delenatii accessions (results not shown).
Another explanation for multispecies clades, e.g., within
well-defined groups such as Parvisepalum could be
ancient hybridization.
We observed that increasing within-species 5S NTS
sequence diversity correlates with increasing minimum
numbers of visible 5S rDNA loci in Paphiopedilum
(Figure 9); therefore we infer that interlocus concerted
evolution is weak within the genus. Our conclusion
concurs with previous findings in many plant genera,
such as Gossypium [17], Triticum [18], Chenopodium
[19], Nicotiana [20] and Pinus [27]. So far, to our
knowledge, noticeable interlocus concerted evolution
of 5S rDNA arrays has not been demonstrated in
plants.
The best supported hypothesis to explain weak homogenization forces on 5S rDNA arrays is that the chromosomal location of rDNA arrays has a substantial impact
on interlocus concerted evolution [17,20,44-47]. Arrays
located in subtelomeric regions are thought to undergo
stronger interlocus homogenization forces than ones
located in proximal regions. Potential evidence was
observed in section Barbata, in which all of six species
studied possess two 5S loci. These six species can be
categorized into two groups according to the locations of
5S loci. One group harboring proximal 5S loci includes
P. wardii, P. dayanum, P. venustum and P. acmodontum,
while the other group harboring subtelomeric 5S loci
includes P. purpuratum and P. sangii (Figure 8; Table 1).
Considering that all six species are closely related and
possess the same number of loci, it can be logically
assumed that the difference in sequence polymorphism
between the two groups is caused by the different locations of the 5S loci. The fact that the average number of
polymorphic sites in the proximal-loci group (151.5) is
18% more than that in the subtelomeric-loci group (128),
indicates that proximally located loci seem less homogenized than the subtelomerically located loci.
Additionally, we found that not only interlocus but also
intralocus concerted evolution is also influenced by chromosomal localization. In section Concoloria, two closely
related species, P. bellatulum and P. niveum, both have
one 5S locus, but with different localizations. The difference in sequence polymorphism between the two species
may be caused by the different locations of the 5S loci.
P. niveum, which has a pericentromeric locus, showed
1.68 - fold more polymorphic sites than P. bellatulum,
which has a subtelomeric locus (Table 1).
It is well-known that meiotic homologous recombination has been largely suppressed in pericentromeric and

Page 12 of 15

centromeric regions. Unequal crossovers between sister
chromatids and gene conversion documented in the centromeres of many organisms have been postulated as the
major homogenization force for tandem repeats located
in these areas [48-52]. A plausible explanation for this
has been proposed previously: if unequal crossover events
between rDNAs of two chromosomes occurred in the
proximal region to centromeres, this may result in the
exchange of not only a fraction of the rDNA but also the
centromeres themselves. Such an event is more likely to
have significantly greater negative consequences to the
organism than if the event occurred in the subtelomeric
region, which then might result in exchange of telomeres
[17,47]; loss of centromeres would prohibit cell division,
whereas loss of telomeres might not restrict mitosis or
meiosis. As such, centromerically-located rDNA arrays
are expected to show weaker homogenization forces,
since fewer individuals with unequal crossovers in this
region are expected to survive. In contrast, the subtelomeric region is characterized by a higher rate of interchromosomal exchange [5], thus stronger concerted
evolutionary forces could be expected in this region.
All species of section Parvisepalum, as with P. bellatulum, have subtelomeric 5S loci, some of which are closely
linked with 25S loci. If 5S localization correlates significantly with homogenization, as with 25S, which is always
telomeric-subtelomerically located, we should expect subtelomeric 5S repeats to show decreased sequence diversity
due to stronger concerted evolutionary forces. However,
this is not the case, since variation in the number of polymorphic sites is not significantly different by section (with
or without Pardalopetalum included in Coryopedilum; single factor ANOVA P = 0.06 and 0.1, respectively). We
therefore infer that localization of the 5S rDNA arrays only
partially contributes to the weak concerted evolution
observed in Paphiopedilum.
There are several other hypothesized mechanisms that
could lead to the weak concerted evolutionary force on 5S
rDNA arrays. For example, ongoing chromosomal rearrangement such as insertion, deletion, or transposition could
occur within arrays too frequently for interlocus concerted
evolution to be effective. Another possibility is that concerted evolutionary processes homogenize 5S rDNA arrays
at rates lower than the rate of speciation, thus novel mutations cannot be fixed or removed and high levels of intralocus polymorphism are expected within arrays [17].
Additionally, the base composition and secondary structure
of rDNA sequences may also affect the rate of concerted
evolution [53]. It is unknown whether weak concerted evolutionary forces are shared by other Paphiopedilum tandem
repeats, or if this is characteristic of 5S rDNA arrays only.
This issue can be elucidated by further studies on other
tandem repeats, such as 25S rDNA arrays.

Conclusions
Paphiopedilum species display many chromosomal rearrangements - for example, duplications, translocations,
and inversions - but only weak concerted evolutionary
forces among highly duplicated 5S arrays, which suggests
that double-strand break repair processes are dynamic and
ongoing. These results make the genus a model system for
the study of complex chromosomal evolution in plants.
Methods
Plant materials

Thirty-seven species of the Paphiopedilum genus covering
all seven sections were analyzed in this study. Information
on the species and sections is provided in Table 1. Actively
growing roots were used for chromosome preparation,
while leaves were used for genomic DNA extraction.

10 min. Fluorescence signal was detected using antiDigoxigenin-Rhodamine conjugate (Roche) and streptavidin-fluorescein conjugate (Invitrogen). The preparations
were mounted and counterstained in Vectashield containing 1.5 μg/ml DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
(Vector Laboratories). Images were taken by a Zeiss
AxioCam MRm black-and-white CCD camera on a Zeiss
Imager. Z1 fluorescence microscope and then processed
uniformly using Zeiss AxioVision software. FISH signals
were false-colored, and DAPI fluorescence was left in
gray-tone.
PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing

Root tips were pre-treated with 0.004 M 8-hydroxyquinoline for 4-6 h at 10°C, and fixed in freshly prepared fixative
(3:1 ethanol: acetic acid) for 48 h at 10°C. The fixed root
tips were then rinsed thoroughly with tap water and
macerated in an enzyme mixture containing 2% cellulase
(Onozuka R-10, Rpi) and 1% pectolyase (Aspergillus japonicus Y-23, MP) at 37°C for 30 min. After re-fixation in
fixative for 15 min, the meristematic cells were squashed
in a drop of 45% acetic acid under a coverslip (22 ×
22 mm) on a microscope slide. Slides were then dipped
into liquid nitrogen and air dried after the coverslips were
carefully removed by a blade.

Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves using
Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini kit. The 5S-NTS region was
amplified by PCR using the universal degenerate primers:
5’-TGGGAAGTCCTYGTGTTGCA-3’ and 5’-KTMGYGC
TGGTATGATCGCA-3’ [56]. Touchdown amplification
was performed as follows: an initial step at 94°C for 5 min,
followed by 10 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, annealing for
1 min (start at 60°C, and decreased by 1°C per cycle), and
72°C for 1 min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for
1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, the final step at 72°C was
extended to 10 min. After gel purification using QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), PCR products were ligated
into pDrive Cloning vector and transformed into QIAGEN
EZ competent cells (Qiagen PCR Cloning kit). Recombinant clones were screened by colony direct PCR method
and were sequenced 7-8 clones per each species using T7
(5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3’) primer.

Probe labelling and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

Data analysis

25S rDNA, a 2.3-kb ClaI subclones of the 25S rDNA coding region of Arabidopsis thaliana [54] and 5S rDNA
(pTa794) [55]were used as probes. 25S rDNA was labelled
with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) and 5S rDNA was labelled
with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche), all by nick translation
method using the kit from Roche. The hybridization buffer
consisted of 50% deionized formamide, 2 × SSC, 50 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10% dextran sulfate and
sheared salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) in 100 × excess
of labeled probes. The 25S and 5S rDNA probes were
mixed to a final concentration of about 2 ng/μl and then
denatured at 94°C for 10 min before being used. Slides
with metaphase spreads were treated with 70% deionized
formamide in 2 × SSC at 70°C for 2 min. Denatured
probes in hybridization buffer were then applied to the
slides, which were incubated at 37°C for 10 h in a humid
chamber. Post-hybridization washes and immunodetection
were carried out in an automated in situ hybridization
instrument, the InsituPro VSi (Intavis Bionanalytical
Instruments). The slides were washed in 2 × SSC at room
temperature for 5 min and twice in 2 ×SSC at 50°C for

Sequences were aligned using the MAFFT (Multiple
Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) web server at
the European Bioinformatics Institute [57]. Default parameters were used: gap opening penalty = 1.53, gap
extension penalty = 0.123, tree rebuilding number = 1,
maxiterate = 0, and perform FFTS = localpair. The
sequence alignment is available as a supplementary
FASTA file (Additional file 4).
Within-species 5S-NTS polymorphism was estimated,
based on the aforementioned multiple alignment, using
DnaSP version 5.10.01 [58]. The relationship between
numbers of polymorphic sites and minimum numbers
of visible 5S rDNA signals was investigated using linear
regression analysis (in Microsoft Excel).
Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using maximum likelihood optimization available through the
RaxML BlackBox web server [59] running RaxML version
7.2.8 [60]. Default settings were used. The 8 Phragmipedium besseae sequences were indicated as the outgroup.
RaxML was called using the following commands:
