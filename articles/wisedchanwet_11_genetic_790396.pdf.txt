Abstract
A one year active surveillance program for influenza A viruses among avian species in a live-bird market (LBM) in
Bangkok, Thailand was conducted in 2009. Out of 970 samples collected, influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 (n = 2)
and H4N9 (n = 1) were isolated from healthy Muscovy ducks. All three viruses were characterized by whole
genome sequencing with subsequent phylogenetic analysis and genetic comparison. Phylogenetic analysis of all
eight viral genes showed that the viruses clustered in the Eurasian lineage of influenza A viruses. Genetic analysis
showed that H4N6 and H4N9 viruses display low pathogenic avian influenza characteristics. The HA cleavage site
and receptor binding sites were conserved and resembled to LPAI viruses. This study is the first to report isolation
of H4N6 and H4N9 viruses from birds in LBM in Thailand and shows the genetic diversity of the viruses circulating
in the LBM. In addition, co-infection of H4N6 and H4N9 in the same Muscovy duck was observed.
Findings
Live-bird markets (LBMs) are the places where wild
birds, pet birds, meat birds and domestic poultry are
sold to households. In Asia including Thailand, due to
the cultural preference of consuming freshly slaughtered
poultry, LBMs are located in both suburban areas and
center of the communities. In the markets, thousands of
birds from different sources are sold in wire stacked
cages containing densely packed and mixed bird populations. These conditions provide excellent environments
for animal to animal and animal to human influenza
virus transmissions and may result in an outbreak of
influenza A virus in both animals [1,2] and humans
[3,4]. Therefore, LBMs are considered a major source of
influenza A virus dissemination and potential influenza
A virus reassortment [5,6].
Up to date, many studies on influenza A in LBMs
from various countries have been reported. During
2000-2001, 6 subtypes (9 genotypes) of low-pathogenic
avian influenza (LPAI) were identified in LBMs in

China [7]. Apart from Asian countries, in the US, H5N2
low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses have been
isolated from LBMs in several states in the 80 s [8]. In
Thailand, only one study of influenza A viruses recovered from LBMs has ever been reported [9]. In that
study, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1
viruses were isolated from both bird carcasses and
healthy birds during the 2006-2007 LBM and local food
market (LFM) surveillance program. The findings suggested that animal movement from H5N1 outbreak
areas may introduce the virus into the markets and play
an important role in emergence or re-emergence of
influenza A in animals in Thailand [9]. Since LBMs play
an important role in the dissemination of avian influenza virus, active surveillance of influenza A virus in
LBMs is important in order to develop an early warning
system and implement prevention and control strategies
for influenza A outbreaks. In this study, a one year
active surveillance program for influenza A viruses
among avian species in LBM from Bangkok, Thailand
was conducted in 2009. Influenza A subtypes, H4N6
(n = 2) and H4N9 (n = 1), were isolated from healthy
Muscovy ducks. Interestingly, co-infection of H4N6 and
H4N9 in the same Muscovy duck was also observed.

Whole genome sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and
genetic analysis of the viruses were performed. This
study highlights the first LPAI subtypes H4N6 and
H4N9 ever reported in poultry from Thailand.
During January to December 2009, a 12-month LBM
surveillance program was carried out in LBM in Bangkok, Thailand. The LBM was visited monthly and
approximately 40 samples (chicken and ducks) per market were collected at each sampling. In total, 970 samples (485 oropharyngeal and 485 cloacal swabs) were
collected from 485 animals (chicken = 214, ducks =
271) from LBM located in the center of Bangkok. All
swab samples were subjected to virus isolation by using
embryonated egg inoculation according to WHO/OIE

recommendations. Allantoic fluid from egg inoculation
was tested for Hemagglutination (HA) titer using 1%
chicken red blood cells. Samples testing positive for HA
test were subjected for influenza A virus identification
and subtyping. To identify influenza A virus, real-timeRT-PCR specific for the influenza A virus matrix (M)
gene was performed as previously described [10]. To
subtype influenza A virus, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR
subtyping were performed. RT-PCR was performed by
using primers specific for each subtype of influenza A
virus [11,12]. In this study, 3 samples collected in June,
2009 were identified as influenza A virus subtype H4N6
(n = 2) and H4N9 (n = 1) while 16 samples collected in
November, 2009 were identified as H10N3. On the

BMCMC analysis were performed for confirming tree topology (Bootstrap, posterior probability). The H4N6 and H4N9 influenza viruses

other hand, all other samples were negative for influenza
A virus. Interestingly, two influenza A subtypes, H4N6
(CU-LM1983) and H4N9 (CU-LM1984), were isolated
from oropharyngeal (CU-LM1983) and cloacal (CULM1984) swabs of the same duck. Both H4 subtypes
have never been reported in Thailand.
After subtyping, whole genome sequencing was
performed by using newly designed primers for each
gene of influenza A subtypes, H4N6 and H4N9. The
whole genome sequences of influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 (n = 2) and H4N9 (n = 1) were submitted to the GenBank database with accession
numbers as follows: A/Muscovy Duck/Thailand/CULM1973/09(H4N6) (CY062545-52), A/Muscovy
Duck/Thailand/CU-LM1983/09(H4N6)(CY06255360), and A/Muscovy Duck/Thailand/CU-LM1984/09
(H4N9)(CY062561-68).

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA 4.1
program (Tempe, AZ, USA) with neighbor-joining
method with Kimura 2-parameter. Nucleotide sequences
of H4N6 (n = 24) and N9 (n = 30) representing different
geographic locations, host species and Eurasian/North
American lineages were included for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA)
gene showed that the H4 gene can be divided into 2
major lineages, the Eurasian and North American,
respectively (Figure 1). The HA genes of both H4N6
and H4N9 viruses from Thailand were grouped into the
Eurasian lineage. As for the Neuraminidase (NA) gene,
phylogenetic analysis of N6 and N9 showed that both
NA subtypes also clustered in the Eurasian lineage
(Figure 2 and Figure 3). Phylogenetic analyses of the
remaining 6 internal genes of the H4N6 and H4N9
influenza viruses were also conducted. The results

showed that all internal genes clustered in the Eurasian
lineage, similar to both HA and NA genes (Additional
file 1 Fig S1). The results from phylogenetic analysis
indicated that both H4N6 and H4N9 recovered from
Thailand contain all gene segments derived from avian
influenza A viruses of the Eurasian lineage. This may be
due to the specific non-overlapping flight paths of wild

and migratory birds between the Pacific and North
American regions.
To genetically analyze the viruses, the nucleotide similarities of each gene of both subtypes H4N6 and H4N9
were generated by using nucleotide BLAST program
available at GenBank database. Nucleotide sequences
and deduced amino acids of each gene of H4N6 and

Wisedchanwet et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:131

H4N9 viruses were aligned and compared by using the
MegAlign program (DNASTAR). Sequence homologies
of each gene of the H4N6 and H4N9 influenza A viruses
with highest nucleotide identities to reference influenza
A strains are shown in Table 1. The results showed that
both H4N6 viruses (CU-LM 1973 and CU-LM 1983)
and H4N9 (CU-LM 1984) display the most pronounced
nucleotide identities to avian influenza viruses of the
Eurasian lineage. The HA gene of all 3 viruses shows
the highest nucleotide similarity to A/duck/Taiwan/
wb1104/2006(H4N6) at 97%. The NA gene of both N6
and N9 subtypes has the highest nucleotide similarity to
A/duck/Eastern China/01/2007 (H4N6) and A/duck/
Mongolia/119/2008(H7N9), respectively. H4N6 (CULM1983) and H4N9 (CU-LM1984) are highly similar in
their HA gene (99.6%) and 6 internal genes (PB2, PB1,
PA, NP, NS, M) (98.4-100%), while the NA genes of
CU-LM1983(N6) and CU-LM1984(N9) show only 38.1%
nucleotide identity (64.6% amino acid identity) because
of subtype differences. This finding may suggest that co-

Page 5 of 8

infection with H4N6 and H4N9 occurred in the same
host. It is possible that the H4N9 virus has resulted
from reassortment of the H4N6 backbone and the NA
gene (N9) from a separate unknown HA influenza A
virus subtype (H?N9).
The deduced amino acids of the H4 gene of influenza
A isolates were aligned and compared with those of
reference H4N6 and H4N9 viruses representing the Eurasian and North American lineages published at the
GenBank database using the MegAlign program. Our
result showed that amino acids at the HA cleavage site
in the Thai H4N6 and H4N9 viruses are âPEKASRâ,
similar to most avian isolates in the Eurasian lineage,
while those of the North American lineage including
ruddy turnstone (NJ/47/85), mallard (ALB/49/95) and
swine (ONT/1911-1/99) isolates are âPEKATRâ
(Table 2)[13] The HA cleavage site pattern of both Thai
H4N6 and H4N9 indicates low pathogenic characteristics of influenza A viruses. It has been known that addition of multiple amino acids at the cleavage site such as

Arginine (R) and Lysine (K) may turn LPAI into HPAI
[14]. However, to further confirm virus pathogenicity,
an intravenous pathogenicity index test (IVPI) should be
performed [15]. Amino acids at receptor binding sites
(HA98,153,155,183,190, 194,195 (H3 numbering system)) were also analyzed (Table 2). In this study, the
amino acids of Thai H4N6 and H4N9 at positions
224-229 and 134-138 were âRGQSGRâ and âGKSGAâ,

respectively. It is noteworthy that the receptor binding
sites of H4N6 and H4N9 especially, Q226 and G228 are
similar to all H4N6 in both Eurasian and North American lineages suggesting that these viruses would preferentially bind to 2,3 linked sialic acid receptors
predominant in avian species [16]. One H4N6 virus
from swine (A/Swine/Ontario/01911-1/99) contains
amino acid changes at positions 226 (Q226L) and 228

Wisedchanwet et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:131

(G228S) indicating high affinity of the virus to SA
2,6Gal receptors which are dominant in mammalian
species [13,16]. N-linked glycosylation sites of the H4
gene were also analyzed. Three N-linked glycosylation
sites in HA1 and one glycosylation site in HA2 were
observed in Thai H4 viruses (Figure 4). It should be
noted that one glycosylation site in HA1 of Thai H4
influenza A isolates was absent due to the amino acid
changes N2D resulting in loss of glycosylation ability
[17]. Thai H4N6 and H4N9 contain less N-linked glycosylation sites than the viruses described in a previous
report [17]. Previous studies reported that an absent of
N-liked glycosylation site of HA protein would altered
biological functions of the virus [18,19].
The influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 and H4N9
found in LBMs can be a potential risk to birds and
humans. The viruses were shed in feces and contaminated the wire stack cages in LBM. This setting provides
an appropriate condition for virus transmission among
birds kept in the cage nearby or below [20]. Consequently, a small outbreak of influenza A viruses H4N6
and H4N9 in the birds in LBM can occur. Fortunately,
the H4N6 and H4N9 viruses circulating in this LBM are
of low virulence and hardly capable of infecting humans.
However, if HPAI or newly reassorted viruses with high
virulence circulate in the markets in the future, this
would pose a threat to vendors, consumers and people

Page 7 of 8

who enter the markets. For example, in China, HPAI
H5N1 infection was reported in one patient who had
visited LBMs. The study showed that LBM can be a
potential source of HPAI in a local community and
infection of humans can occur not only by direct but
also by indirect contact [4].
The public should be made aware of the significance of
the influenza viruses, the hosts, the environment and
potential virus reassortment especially in LBMs. Examples
of influenza prevention and control strategies in the LBM
include 1) creating a rest day to interrupt the LBMâs flow
system, which could significantly reduce the occurrence of
the virus in LBMs [21], 2) disinfection of fomites in LBMs
as the presence of influenza A virus in fomites has been
documented [22], 3) educational campaigns, vendors
should be informed on how to protect themselves from
influenza A virus infection. Since surveillance of influenza
A virus in LBMs can serve as a good early warning system
[6], influenza A viruses isolated in LBMs can reflect the
status and the diversity of the viruses circulating in local
communities. Continuous influenza A virus surveillance in
LBMs should be performed in order to understand the
epidemiology of influenza A virus in LBMs and to monitor
influenza virus evolution.
In conclusion, influenza A virus subtypes H4N6 and
H4N9 were isolated from ducks in a live bird market in
Bangkok, Thailand. Both H4N6 and H4N9 subtypes

recovered from ducks had never been reported in Thailand. Whole genome sequences of the viruses were
determined and submitted to the respective databases.
Phylogenetic analysis of H4N6 and H4N9 viruses
showed that gene segments of the viruses were derived
from the Eurasian linage. Genetic analysis of the viruses
also showed that the viruses display low pathogenic
characteristics, with amino acids specific to avian influenza viruses.

Thai H4N6 and H4N9 viruses and other H4N6 and H4N9 influenza A
viruses. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining
algorithm. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and posterior
probability from BMCMC analysis were performed for confirming tree
topology (Bootstrap, posterior probability). The H4N6 and H4N9 influenza
viruses characterized in the study are present in triangle.
