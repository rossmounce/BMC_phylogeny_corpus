Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the Midas
cichlid fish pharyngeal jaw and its relevance in
adaptive radiation
Moritz Muschick1,2, Marta Barluenga1,3, Walter Salzburger1,2 and Axel Meyer1*

Abstract
Background: Phenotypic evolution and its role in the diversification of organisms is a central topic in evolutionary
biology. A neglected factor during the modern evolutionary synthesis, adaptive phenotypic plasticity, more recently
attracted the attention of many evolutionary biologists and is now recognized as an important ingredient in both
population persistence and diversification. The traits and directions in which an ancestral source population
displays phenotypic plasticity might partly determine the trajectories in morphospace, which are accessible for an
adaptive radiation, starting from the colonization of a novel environment. In the case of repeated colonizations of
similar environments from the same source population this “flexible stem” hypothesis predicts similar phenotypes
to arise in repeated subsequent radiations. The Midas Cichlid (Amphilophus spp.) in Nicaragua has radiated in
parallel in several crater-lakes seeded by populations originating from the Nicaraguan Great Lakes. Here, we tested
phenotypic plasticity in the pharyngeal jaw of Midas Cichlids. The pharyngeal jaw apparatus of cichlids, a second
set of jaws functionally decoupled from the oral ones, is known to mediate ecological specialization and often
differs strongly between sister-species.
Results: We performed a common garden experiment raising three groups of Midas cichlids on food differing in
hardness and calcium content. Analyzing the lower pharyngeal jaw-bones we find significant differences between
diet groups qualitatively resembling the differences found between specialized species. Observed differences in
pharyngeal jaw expression between groups were attributable to the diet’s mechanical resistance, whereas surplus
calcium in the diet was not found to be of importance.
Conclusions: The pharyngeal jaw apparatus of Midas Cichlids can be expressed plastically if stimulated
mechanically during feeding. Since this trait is commonly differentiated - among other traits - between Midas
Cichlid species, its plasticity might be an important factor in Midas Cichlid speciation. The prevalence of pharyngeal
jaw differentiation across the Cichlidae further suggests that adaptive phenotypic plasticity in this trait could play
an important role in cichlid speciation in general. We discuss several possibilities how the adaptive radiation of
Midas Cichlids might have been influenced in this respect.

Background
Adaptive radiations arise through the rapid divergence of
an ancestral species into a multitude of morphologically
and ecologically differentiated taxa [1]. This process is
assumed to be driven by divergent natural selection and
ecological speciation where the adaptation to different
niches eventually results in the evolution of reproductive

isolation [2]. For example, specialization to certain food
resources might lead to divergent habitat preferences,
which in turn might isolate the populations reproductively
[reviewed in [3]]. Specialization in diet is usually accompanied by morphological adaptations facilitating resource
exploitation as has been shown in some textbook examples of adaptive radiation, e.g. the Darwin finches on the
Galapagos Islands [4], the cichlid fishes in East African
lakes [5-7], or the cosmopolitan tiger beetles [8].
Often, adaptive radiations are triggered by an altered
adaptive landscape providing opportunity to invade

previously not encountered ecological niches (e.g. after
colonization of a new environment) or not accessible
niches (e.g. after evolution of a ‘key innovation’) [9,10].
Recent studies showed that these adaptive peak shifts
might happen rapidly [reviewed in [11]], and raise the
question of how the adaptive morphological change
drives the shift from one peak to another on the adaptive surface [12,13]. Mutation in coding and regulatory
sequences and selection might not be sufficient to
explain the rapidity of ecological adaptation seen in
some instances [14]. Adaptation from standing genetic
variation is also not likely to apply to all cases of adaptive radiations, particularly those with only a small number of founders [15]. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity
might play a key role allowing populations to enter the
‘realm of attraction’ of a new adaptive peak, in which
genetic assimilation occurs through directional selection
favoring genotypes that produce even more extreme
phenotypes than what would be possible by plastic
response of the ancestral genotype alone [16,17]. Baldwin discussed this topic already in 1896 and described it
as ‘a new factor in evolution’ [18,19]. Although its
importance meanwhile became evident, phenotypic plasticity and genetic assimilation were dismissed as being
unimportant during the modern evolutionary synthesis
[20]. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in
these phenomena [21-25], but the link to diversification
is still little explored and under debate [26-28]. Not
many investigations of phenotypic plasticity in model
systems for speciation research, such as cichlid fishes,
have been attempted (but see [29-33]).
The Neotropical Midas Cichlid species complex
(Amphilophus spp.), is recognized among evolutionary
biologists for its rapid phenotypic diversification and
speciation [6,34]. This species complex has its center of
its distribution in Nicaragua, and is comprised of an
array of very young species that inhabit both the large
Nicaraguan lakes, and several volcanic crater-lakes that
contain small scale adaptive radiations [35,36]. The large
Nicaraguan lakes, characterized by relatively turbid and
shallow waters, have repeatedly acted as source populations for the colonization of nearby crater-lakes newly
formed in the calderas of extinguished volcanoes. In
these lakes the Midas cichlids encountered novel environmental conditions - i.e. presence of deeper zones and
clearer water - and speciated in situ [34,35,37-41]. Crater-lake species have separated along depth and benthiclimnetic axes [34,35], with the open water column
apparently being the first novel habitat invaded. Also,
the Midas cichlid species have differentiated in their
trophic adaptations. Usage of food sources like stonewort, Aufwuchs, evasive invertebrate prey, fish or snails
differs species-specifically [39]. The Midas cichlids species, as well as other Neotropical and Old World

Page 2 of 12

cichlids, often differ in the relative degree of hypertrophy of a second set of jaws in the throat - the pharyngeal jaw - derived from branchial arch components and
important for food mastication [reviewed in [42]]. Specialization for feeding on hard-shelled prey like snails,
mussels, or crustaceans (durophagy) through this hypertrophy of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus (PJA) has been
found to be a common axis of differentiation in craterlake Midas cichlids as well as in other cichlid groups
[5,31,32,34,42-44]. Its frequency and independency of
acquisition across the phylogenetic tree suggests an
important role of this adaptation in cichlid speciation
[[5], [30], reviewed in [42]]
The Midas cichlid species in the crater lakes are often
well differentiated in the trophic apparatus and only a
few thousand years old [34-37]. The trophic polymorphism in the Midas crater-lake species could be derived
from standing genetic variation, since the polymorphism
is present in the large lakes, too [31,32,38,41]. However,
the probably limited number of colonizing individuals
would render a scenario of the evolution of trait divergence subsequent to colonization also plausible. This
scenario is arguably more likely for remote crater-lakes
with a monophyletic Midas cichlid assemblage, e.g. Lake
Apoyo (see [34]). A plausible scenario could be that the
divergence in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus in the crater
lake Midas cichlid species might have been initiated by
phenotypic plasticity in the ancestor. Reproductive isolation might then have occurred via habitat isolation
through the heterogeneous distribution of snails in
Nicaragua’s volcanic crater-lakes, where densities appear
to be dependent on depth and substrate type [45]. During times of low food availability otherwise opportunistic
individuals adapted for durophagy might confine to
areas of high snail density and thereby encounter mates
non-randomly in respect to their pharyngeal jaw type
[31,32,46,47]. If the ancestor of derived species was phenotypically plastic in ecologically relevant traits, this
plasticity might have triggered the diversification. The
“flexible stem” model, proposed by West-Eberhard [23],
predicts that the directions in phenotypic space in
which plasticity is expressed influence the trajectories of
phenotypic evolution via genetic accommodation, similar to evolution along “genetic lines of least resistance”
[48]. Therefore, it also predicts the outcomes of adaptive
radiations seeded by the same ancestor and evolving in
similar environments to be similar in terms of their phenotype composition.
In several cichlid fish species (family Cichlidae), plasticity in different traits has been demonstrated: Meyer
experimentally induced changes in the oral jaw morphology in the Neotropical cichlid Parachromis managuensis by feeding different diets [30], a similar
procedure was followed by Bouton and coworkers using

Muschick et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/116

the African cichlid Neochromis greenwoodi [49]. The
Lake Victoria cichlid Haplochromis pyrrhocephalus was
almost driven to extinction by the upsurge of the introduced, predatory Nile perch in the 1980s, but was able
to adapt morphologically to the new environmental conditions of high predatory pressure and eutrophication in
only two decades [50]. It has been interpreted that the
speed and complexity of these morphological changes
relied on a joined action of phenotypic plasticity and
genetic change. The molluscivorous Astatoreochromis
alluaudi naturally exhibits molariform pharyngeal jaws
(i.e. stout, broad and strong jaw-bones with wide and
flat teeth) [51]. However, when raised on soft artificial
food under laboratory conditions [52], in natural conditions in lakes not inhabited by snails [51], or in lakes
inhabited by snails but also with a molluscivorous competitor present [53], they develop less stout pharyngeal
jaws with cuspid teeth (papilliform).
Specializations matter most during ecological “crunch
times”, when resource availability is low and opportunistic feeding is precluded [42,46]. The ability to exploit
resources then at all or more efficiently than other species can, matters for the individual’s survival. But specializations come with a trade-off. The specialization of
being able to feed on particular diets especially efficiently often comes at the cost of being much less efficient when dealing with alternative diets. Apparently,
such a trade-off exists in the Neotropical Midas Cichlid
(Amphilophus cf. citrinellus) between two different types
of pharyngeal jaws, molariform and papilliform. Individuals with papilliform lower pharyngeal jaws are more
effective when dealing with soft food items [54]. Individuals with molariform jaws, on the other hand, can
crack larger and harder snail shells and do this faster
than papilliform individuals [54].
These cases of phenotypic plasticity, the basis of lacustrine cichlid radiations on trophic specialization
[44,55,56] and the possible causal linkage of plasticity
and diversification [23,30,31,57] call for examination of
adaptive phenotypic plasticity in trophic traits in an
adaptive radiation of cichlids comprising species differentiated in these traits. The lower pharyngeal jaw (LPJ)
might constitute ‘an ideal component of cichlid trophic
morphology’ to be investigated in this respect [43]. Preferably, the case in study should have a known and
young history, involve colonization of new habitats and
tests for plasticity in the ancestral or similar to the
ancestral source population.
Here, we tested in a common garden experiment the
developmental plasticity of the lower pharyngeal jaw of
Amphilophus citrinellus (Günther, 1864) exposed to diets
differing in hardness. Earlier work [31] had suggested
that the species in this species complex are phenotypically plastic and that the abundance of molariform fish

Page 3 of 12

correlates with the abundance of their major prey item,
hard-shelled snails.
The experiment was performed on a laboratory stock
derived from the crater Lake Masaya, which was bred in
captivity for several decades. Although Lake Masaya is a
volcanic crater-lake, its A. citrinellus population is very
close to the populations of the Lake Nicaragua - which
is probably the ancestral source population of most crater-lake radiations - in terms of body shape [35] and
phylogenetic relationships [36]. Furthermore, it has been
suggested that Lake Masaya might have been colonized
as recently as 450 years ago [58].
We investigated whether the development of pharyngeal jaws differed between three types of diets: (1) intact
snails with shell, (2) peeled snails without shell, and (3)
finely ground up whole snails frozen in pellets, from
which fish could nibble off the thawed, soft outer layer
when those were given into the water. We aimed to verify whether a hard diet could induce changes in the
pharyngeal jaw of the fish, and whether the generation
of robust pharyngeal jaws with stout teeth (molariform
jaws) was determined by higher calcium content in the
diet, or by mechanical stimulation of the jaws when
crushing hard food items.
Our study finds that diet can induce changes on the
trophic apparatus of the Midas cichlids, and that this
changes are related to the mechanical stimulation of the
jaws.

Results
Geometric morphometric analyses

The shape of the lower pharyngeal jaw differed significantly between the fish raised on a diet ‘with shell’ and
the other two groups of fish as revealed by permutation
testing of Procrustes distances (Table 1). The morphological differentiation measured by Procrustes distance
was significant and similarly large between the ‘with
shell’ and the two other groups (0.0175 and 0.0135,
respectively). The distance between ‘ground’ and ‘no
shell’ was considerably smaller (0.0067) and not significant. Depicting the between group changes along discriminant functions by warped outline drawings revealed
that shape was altered most in functionally relevant
regions of the LPJ, namely the posterior horns. In the
‘with shell’ group the horns (represented by landmarks

and jaws were generally shorter along the anterior-posterior axis (Figure 1). Additionally, the posterior outline
(represented by landmarks 3, 4 and 5) was less concave
in the ‘with shell’ group as in the other groups. In the
‘ground’ group the posterior outline was as well less
concave as in the ‘no shell’ group and the horns were
directed outward slightly more, but horn width was
smaller. The relative overlap on the first two principal
components of shape variation between the treatment
groups is illustrated in Figure 2.
Analyses of weights and lengths

Taking body weight as proxy for ontogenetic stage and
correcting for it, measures not covered by the geometric
morphometric shape analysis were investigated. The LPJ
weight showed significant differences between groups
with ‘no shell’ having the lightest, ‘with shell’ having the
heaviest and ‘ground’ having intermediate jaws. The

centroid size, i.e. the scaling factor from the size-removing step in the alignment of landmark configurations,
was found to differ significantly between the ‘shell’ and
the ‘no shell’ group and between the ‘shell’ and the
‘ground’ group. Differences were not significant between
the ‘ground’ and the ‘no shell’ group (Table 2). The
dimension not assessed by centroid size, the jaw height,
showed no group differentiation if fish body weight was
taken as covariate, but showed strong group differentiation when corrected for LPJ weight instead. In that case,
the ‘no shell’ group had the highest, the ‘with shell’
group the most slender and the ‘ground’ group intermediate jaws relative to jaw weight. This points to an
increase in bone density, moderate with high calcium
diet and strong when mechanical impact acted also on
the jaws during feeding.
The weight of the heavier of the fish’s two largest otoliths - the sagittae - using fish body weight as covariate
in an analysis of covariance, did not differ in the two

‘no shell’ group (Table 2; Figure 3). Correcting for LPJ
weight, the ‘with shell’ group had significantly lower
relative sagitta weight, while ‘ground’ and ‘no shell’ did
not differ (Table 2; Figure 3).

Discussion
Phenotypic plasticity has been hypothesized to be able
to promote divergence only if it is not complete, i.e. sufficient to achieve the same fitness as if the trait was
expressed constitutively [20]. A plastic response would
be adaptive if it shifts the phenotype in the direction of

a new peak on the adaptive surface, and non-adaptive or
maladaptive responses to stressful environments would
place the phenotype away from any optimum [59]. Here,
we were able to induce an adaptive plastic response in
the LPJ of A. citrinellus by feeding different diets. It
qualitatively resembles interspecies differences found in
nature, although less pronounced.
In our common garden experiment, the changes
induced on the fish exposed to a hard shell diet - i.e.
horns of the LPJ pointing more outwards, posterior outline less concave, LPJ relatively heavier and possibly
increased bone density - mirror those identified as

adaptations for mollusk crushing in several other cichlid
sister-species pairs [42,43],very closely related species in
the Midas cichlid complex in several crater lakes [34,37]
and in constitutively expressed [60] or induced [61] phenotypes in other species. The expression of a relatively
hypertrophied pharyngeal jaw due to durophagy resembling adaptations found in specialized molluscivorous
fish, and the result that hypertrophication is much
weaker when fish are fed with high-calcium, low-impact
diet leads to the conclusion that the observed phenotypic plasticity is indeed adaptive. The trade-off in feeding
performance between different phenotypes further evidences the adaptive nature of plasticity in this trait [54].

A surprising finding is that LPJ height did not differ
between the experimental groups, since along this
dimension divergence is commonly found in non-molluscivorous/molluscivorous species pairs [53]. A possible
explanation would be that this trait behaves allometrically with larger and older molariform fishes expressing
more re-growing molars thickening the LPJ. A longer
common garden experiment might reveal plasticity in
this trait as well. An alternative is that LPJ height is simply not plastic, and its evolution is solely governed by
mutation and selection that might bring about developmental constraints. Structural constraints and the lack
of phenotypic accommodation would be a possible
explanation as well. Under this scenario, an increase in
LPJ height would not be possible due to prohibitive spatial demands.
Several findings suggest that no specific and adaptive
shape difference was induced by a high-calcium diet
alone. Only small differences in shape were observed
between ‘no shell’ and ‘ground’ groups, and those differences did not resemble known adaptations for durophagy. Furthermore, the comparisons including otolith
weight show that calcium allocation is strongly biased
towards the LPJ in the ‘with shell’ group but not in the
‘ground’ group. There, it appears to affect the skeleton
evenly as indicated by the group comparison for sagittae
weight when correcting for LPJ weight. This corroborates the finding that the mechanical impact on the LPJ
during feeding triggers increased calcium allocation
towards the jaw and suggests that a high-calcium diet
leads to an unspecific increase in calcium deposition.
The sagittae, as well as the other otoliths, grow in small
increments throughout the fish’s life [62] and their
weight is considered to reflect weight of the individual
and availability of calcium during its life. However, Ichii
and Mugiya [63] showed that fish raised on a calcium
depleted diet did not show different bone densities after
a period of 58 days, but were able to substitute the lacking dietary input of calcium by increasing uptake through
the gills from the water. Farrell and Campana [64]
observed that environmental availability of calcium does
not affect its deposition on the otolith. These studies
have background levels of calcium in both, supplied diet
and water, which might differ from levels in our experiment, involve different species and their experiments
were conducted significantly shorter. These differences in
experimental setup might explain why in our study an
effect of calcium availability on bone and otolith growth
was observed as opposed to the other studies.
The effects of the mechanical impact were strong
enough to exceed anticipated effects of a higher availability of calcium in the ‘ground’ diet due to facilitated
uptake of minerals from the readily processed shells.

during mastication, and Hoogerhoud [53] reports snail
shell pieces to pass the digestive tract of cichlids apparently unharmed. Such observations might explain the
slight and non-significant shift towards relatively heavier
otoliths in ‘ground’ fish when accounted for body
weight. Several studies on phenotypic plasticity express
concerns about the influence of diet quality on developmental differences between treatment groups, so that
detrimental effects of a low-quality diet might be mistaken for (adaptive) phenotypic plasticity [33,47,65,66].
Here, we addressed these concerns with our feeding
regime. Specifically, we are able to show that induced
differences were not due to a lack of calcium in the diet.
Even though the studied individuals descended from an
inbred line, which has not been subject to artificial
selection favoring plasticity in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, ability to express this trait plastically persisted.
This suggests that the plasticity of the LPJ in A. citrinellus might not be a trait under selection itself, but more
likely an instance of a hidden reaction norm [20].

Similarly to the Midas Cichlid, other cichlid species
show PJA adaptable or adapted to durophagy: in Neotropical cichlids non-molluscivorous and molluscivorous
species, having papilliform and molariform LPJs respectively, often represent closely related sister species pairs
[43]. The same trajectory of divergence has been found
between trophic morphs of the same species, Herichthys
minckleyi, occurring in the Cuatro Ciénegas basin, Mexico. Along the same axis allometric changes happen during the ontogeny of the Mayan Cichlid Cichlasoma
urophthalmus, introduced in Southern Florida [67]. The
presence of hypertrophied pharyngeal jaws is not
restricted to cichlids, or even to freshwater fishes: members of the marine families Sciaenidae, Haemulidae and
Carangidae express a similar type of PJA, allowing them
to feed on hard-shelled prey. The phylogenetic relationship to species with non-hypertrophied pharyngeal jaws
can be close, e.g. congeneric, in these cases as well [68].
The number of cases of closely related species or
trophic morphs of a single species exhibiting such

Muschick et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/116

divergent morphologies, as well as their phylogenetic
dispersal, is astonishing. This trajectory in morphospace
might be similarly important as the well-known deepbodied vs. elongated body trajectory found in many
benthic-limnetic fish species pairs (e.g. [69-71], and
those reviewed in [72]). Both phenotypic contrasts are
usually accompanied by extensive diet and/or habitat
preference differences, respectively. Such ecological
diversification has been shown to be a major factor in
empirically studied speciation events and its importance
in speciation is well supported by theoretical models
[34,73-75]. In the Midas Cichlid species complex, ecological diversification has been shown to occur along both
axes, even in correlation [31], and probably led to speciation in several cases [34].
Phenotypic plasticity and rates of diversification

The importance of phenotypic plasticity in population
divergence and speciation gained increasing attention in
the last years [22,23,26,33,47,57,76-81]. Both studies
focusing on single species and studies within a larger
comparative framework investigated this link: Nylin &
Wahlberg found support for a ‘plasticity scenario’ for
the diversification of nymphaline butterflies during the
Tertiary and argued that herbivorous taxa able to
occupy several niches were more likely to diversify along
with the angiosperm radiation [82]. In coastal San Diego
a population of montane dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis, Aves) was able to establish itself due to an adaptive plastic response in reproductive effort [83]. A recent
review by Pfennig et al. [57] summarizes theoretical and
empirical studies and diagnoses an important, but largely underappreciated, role of phenotypic plasticity in
speciation and adaptive radiation. Comparing sister
clade pairs - with one clade being known to include
cases of resource polyphenism, while the other does not
- Pfennig and McGee found evidence that resource
polyphenism is associated with greater species richness
in fishes and amphibians [28].
The role of phenotypic plasticity in population divergence appears to be at least twofold: (1) plasticity
increases the probability of population persistence after
colonization of a new environment, thus making its split
from the ancestral population more likely [83,84], and
(2) plasticity provides means of conquering other peaks
on the adaptive landscape, possibly leading to assortative
mating and speciation with parallel outcomes in
repeated cases [12,14,17,23,33].
Theoretical investigations support these predictions.
Probability of population persistence increases with
plasticity while being dependent on the amount of
environmental change and the costliness of plasticity
[85]. At a moderate rate of environmental change and if
plasticity is costly, high levels of plasticity are expected

Page 8 of 12

to lead to an increased probability of extinction while
an intermediate level improves the ability of persistence
[85]. Access to novel ecological niches is improved
because an increase in epigenetic variability does facilitate the circumvention of adaptive valleys and smoothes
the fitness landscape [13,86,87]. Using numerical simulations Thibert-Plante and Hendry [26] find plasticity to
commence reduction in gene flow between populations
in contrasting environments. To do so, plasticity must
occur before dispersal but could then lead to reproductive isolation even prior to any adaptive genetic
divergence.
Our demonstration of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in
the LPJ of A. cf. citrinellus suggests that this could be a
crucial factor in ecological speciation and adaptive radiation in the repeated Amphilophus crater-lake radiations
and possibly in other cichlid clades as well [30,31]. The
results of our experiment support the “flexible stem”
hypothesis, in that the induced differences between
treatment groups - more robust LPJs in the ‘with-shell’
group, less robust LPJs in groups fed soft food - resemble between-species differences in crater-lake radiations.
However, we did not test for plasticity in the ancestor
itself, nor in fish derived from the large Nicaraguan
Lakes, but in a stock derived from Lake Masaya. The
different history might have caused an alteration of the
plastic response in experimental groups compared to
the real ancestor. But since there is a considerable
chance of the Lake Masaya A. citrinellus population
being very young and since plasticity here seems not be
lost easily (at least not over several generations), we suggest that our results endorse the “flexible stem” hypothesis for the Midas Cichlid assemblage. Because the
induced plasticity does not reach the extent of morphological divergence found between species in nature we
conclude, that the expectations from the “adaptive surface model” are fulfilled as well.
In which way exactly phenotypic plasticity and genetic
accommodation in the pharyngeal jaw might abet diversification in the Amphilophus species complex remains
speculative. A direct influence on the formation of
reproductive isolation might be given through enhancement of habitat preference. If individuals expressing the
same type of pharyngeal jaw have a higher chance of
mating with each other, and gene flow between groups
is hampered strongly enough, population subdivision
might be initiated. The heterogeneous distribution of
snails, if it is stable over time and patches are sufficiently large, might be the basis for habitat preference
by jaw type. Alternatively, the hypothesized function of
the pharyngeal jaw apparatus in sound production, e.g.
during courtship, might bring about assortative mating
according to jaw type if female sound preference is
divergent as well [88].

Muschick et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/116

However, even if phenotypic plasticity is less important in sympatric speciation scenarios it might still influence diversification in allopatry [reviewed in [89]]. By
augmenting the probability of population persistence
after colonization of a new environment, e.g. a craterlake, and the possibility of genetic accommodation of
plastic trait changes the likelihood of allopatric speciation between ancestral source population and the new
colonizing population is increased. It remains unclear,
whether or not the repeated endemic radiations of
Midas cichlids in Nicaraguan crater-lakes are facilitated
by phenotypic plasticity in the pharyngeal jaw or if the
constitutively expressed differences in jaw shape
between species are a secondary result of speciation driven by other factors. The best documented case of an
in-crater-lake diversification, the origination of the
Arrow cichlid Amphilophus zaliosus in Lake Apoyo,
seems to have been driven by diverging habitat preferences with differences in pharyngeal jaw shape being
probably secondary [34]. However, in other, less-well
documented cases the hypothesis that adaptations in the
pharyngeal jaw apparatus triggered divergence remains
valid, but would need to be further investigated.

Conclusions
We demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in the pharyngeal jaw of the cichlid fish Amphilophus citrinellus that
is due not to differences in nutritional composition of
the diet, but brought about largely by the mode of feeding. This finding might suggest that plasticity plays an
important role in diversification.
Future research on how a plastic reaction in one trait
could impact the expression of other traits through correlated plastic responses might contribute to the understanding of parallelisms so often encountered in nature.
For example, it seems the papilliform pharyngeal jaw
type is correlated with fusiform limnetic body shape
whereas the molariform jaw type is correlated with deeper, benthic body shape [31]. The extent to which this
‘integration of plastic responses’ [81] is determined, and
by which factors, still remains to be elucidated. Also,
what role a stage of fixed polymorphism plays in the
process of diversification, whether it is an intermediate
step [42] or a ‘dead-end’, remains to be investigated.
How adaptive phenotypic plasticity is mediated genetically is another important issue. In cichlids, the family
of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is known to be
involved in shaping bones of the oral and pharyngeal
jaws [90] and might constitute good candidates, along
with respective transcription factors and ligands, for the
elucidation of the genetics of phenotypic plasticity in
the PJA.
Cichlids, are a prime system for speciation research
and have an important trophic trait expressed plastically,

Page 9 of 12

and therefore constitute a cogent group for investigating
the role of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in diversification. Research combining experimental and field studies
with modern tools of analysis, such as sensitive group
assignment methods or gene expression quantification,
will be most rewarding avenues of research to elucidate
the link between plasticity and speciation

Methods
Common garden experiment

We divided fry of a single Amphilophus citrinellus brood
from an inbred line into three similarly sized groups and
fed them on diets differing in mechanical durability and
calcium content. The three study groups of 30 A. citrinellus individuals each were kept under standardized laboratory conditions with 12 h daylight for a period of six
month. The fish stock used (AM-stock at the University
of Konstanz) derives from Lake Masaya, a volcanic crater-lake in Nicaragua. Originally, these fish came from
the Berkeley stocks of George Barlow who gave some of
these fish to the Steinhard Aquarium in San Francisco. In
2001 fish from there were brought to Konstanz and are
the stock of A. cf. citrinellus that were used in these
experiments. This fish stock has been bred in captivity on
soft artificial food for several decades. Moreover, in Lake
Masaya no snails occur and neither are cichlids with
molariform pharyngeal jaws reported [54,91].
The fish groups were raised on different diets: (1) Melanoides tuberculata snails, laboratory grown, with intact
bodies and intact or slightly damaged shells (in case the
snail was deemed too large), (2) snail bodies, where the
shells were manually removed, and (3) M. tuberculata
with shell but ground to fine paste using mortar and pestle, which was given frozen in pieces to large to be swallowed as a whole. Food amount was adjusted to match
group’s estimated size gain. Fish were kept in one large
tank (1.8 × 0.5 × 0.5 meter, 450 l) and perforated walls
allowed water exchange between the compartments containing the three experimental groups. To counteract
position bias, we swapped groups between compartments
several times throughout the experiment.
Measurements & analyses

Fishes were sacrificed and weighed, and standard and
total length were recorded. We excised LPJs and sagittae, and cleaned and dried them. LPJs and otoliths were
weighed to the nearest milligram. LPJs were scanned on
a standard desktop scanner. Coordinates of 8 landmarks
were recorded for each LPJ using tpsDig 2.11 ([92], for
landmark positions see Figure 1). Landmarks represented homologous, defined locations on the jaws outline. Their positioning followed Klingenberg et al. [93]
with the exception of their landmarks 5 and 6 - instead
the anterior tip was covered by our landmark 8.

Muschick et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/116

Otherwise landmark position were the same, though differently numbered. Landmark arrangements were procrustes aligned, i.e. their positional, rotational and size
information was removed from the dataset. However,
size information was recorded in centroid size and was
used for joint analysis with other data. Since the LPJ is a
symmetrical structure we extracted the symmetric component of shape variation using MorphoJ [94]. We conducted discriminant function analyses (DFA) for each
pair of groups to produce Figure 1. A canonical variates
analyses (CVA) using residuals of a pooled-within-dietgroups regression on body weight (Ln) yielded mean
shape distances and their significance levels were
assessed by permutation testing (10.000 permutations).
Fish body weight, LPJ weight, height, and centroid
size, and otolith weight were evaluated via analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and group-pairwise differences of
residuals means were assessed for significance using
Tukey’s honest significant difference-test. All these measures were Ln transformed prior to analysis. For otoliths
the weight of the heavier sagitta was used, to minimize
influence of preparation damage.
All statistical tests on length and weight data were
performed using the R statistical environment [95].
