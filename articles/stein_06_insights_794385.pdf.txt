Abstract
Background: In the time since we presented the first molecular evolutionary study of the ErbB
family of receptors and the EGF family of ligands, there has been a dramatic increase in genomic
sequences available. We have utilized this greatly expanded data set in this study of the ErbB family
of receptors and their ligands.
Results: In our previous analysis we postulated that EGF family ligands could be characterized by
the presence of a splice site in the coding region between the fourth and fifth cysteines of the EGF
module and the placement of that module near the transmembrane domain. The recent
identification of several new ligands for the ErbB receptors supports this characterization of an
ErbB ligand; further, applying this characterization to available sequences suggests additional
potential ligands for these receptors, the EGF modules from previously identified proteins:
interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan-2, the alpha and beta subunit of meprin A, and mucins 3,
4, 12, and 17. The newly available sequences have caused some reorganizations of relationships
among the ErbB ligand family, but they add support to the previous conclusion that three gene
duplication events gave rise to the present family of four ErbB receptors among the tetrapods.
Conclusion: This study provides strong support for the hypothesis that the presence of an easily
identifiable sequence motif can distinguish EGF family ligands from other EGF-like modules and
reveals several potential new EGF family ligands. It also raises interesting questions about the
evolution of ErbB2 and ErbB3: Does ErbB2 in teleosts function differently from ErbB2 in tetrapods
in terms of ligand binding and intramolecular tethering? When did ErbB3 lose kinase activity, and
what is the functional significance of the divergence of its kinase domain among teleosts?

Background
The ErbB family of receptors is a diverse set of Type I
receptor tyrosine kinases ubiquitously distributed
throughout the animal kingdom. In vertebrates there are
four family members, ErbB 1/EGF receptor, ErbB2/neu/
HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4, while in invertebrates only one receptor has been identified. The verte-

brate ligands are more numerous and varied than the
receptors and include, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, heparin-binding epidermal
growth factor, amphiregulin, betacellulin, epiregulin, epigen, neuregulin 1–4, tomoregulin/TMEFF 1–2, and neuroglycan-C. In invertebrates, one ligand has been
identified in Caenorhabditis, lin-3, while four ligands have

been identified in Drosophila, vein, gurken, spitz, and
keren.
We previously carried out an evolutionary analysis of the
ErbB receptor and ligands [1], which was based on a more
limited sequence data set than is currently available. In
our analysis the order of gene duplications leading to the
four mammalian receptors was supported by the known
functions and interactions of the receptors, while the segregation of the mammalian ligands into EGF receptor ligands and ErbB3/ErbB4 ligands mirrored the receptor
segregation. In addition, sequence comparison between
different species and receptors suggested regions of the
receptors that might lead to specific differences in function between the four different receptors.
Recent genomic sequencing from a variety of species
should allow for a substantial expansion of the previous
analysis, which focused mainly on the mammalian and
specifically the human receptors. The completed or partial
genomic sequences from zebrafish, fugu, tetraodon, xenopus, and chicken among other species, allow for the examination of sequence variation of additional branches of
the vertebrates beyond the mammalian lineage and how
these different branches compare to each other. Comparison of these additional sequences confirms our previous
description of the gene duplication events for the receptors, while the additional ligands generate a more populated ligand tree that yields new perspectives about
receptor specificity.

Results and discussion
Ligands
Our earlier analysis suggested that EGF family ligands
could be distinguished from non-ligand EGF motifs based
on the presence of a splice site between the fourth and
fifth cysteines within the six cysteine EGF-module and the
placement of this module in close proximity to the transmembrane region of the potential ligand [1]. Since our
last analysis, several new ligands have been identified.
One of these ligands, identified from a mouse keratinocyte expressed sequence tag library, has been termed epigen
[2]. The EGF-module occurs prior to a putative transmembrane region and examination of its chromosomal location indicates a splice site between the fourth and fifth
cysteines. Two other ligands are very similar and have
been called either tomoregulin 1 and 2 or TMEFF (transmembrane with an egf and two follistatin domains) 2 and
1 [3,4]. Both of these ligands also have the proposed
splice site and location relative to a putative transmembrane region. A report suggested that the EGF-module
from neuroglycan-C is a ligand for ErbB3 [5] and it has the
proposed splice site and location relative to a putative
transmembrane region. The chicken homologue to neuroglycan-C, CALEB, is noted in the databank to be chicken

EGF (accession # CAA70459), but was first identified as a
neural member of the EGF family and was shown to be
associated with glial and neuronal tissues [6]. In the invertebrates, keren was identified in Drosophila as a close
homologue to the previously identified spitz [7]. Of the
newly discovered ligands, only keren, like its extensively
characterized homologue spitz, does not have the proposed splice site, which likely reflects the general reduction of introns in the Drosophila genome.
In addition to the previously described ligands and the
newly described ligands, this study has also identified
additional EGF modules in previously described proteins
that have the splice site between the fourth and fifth
cysteines and are near putative transmembrane domains.
These modules occur in mucin 3, 4, 12, and 17, meprin 1α
and 1β, and interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2.
Only one of these proteins, mucin 4, has been directly
implicated in the activity of the ErbB receptor family. It
has been shown that mucin 4 down regulates the signaling ability of ErbB2, though not as a secreted ligand, but
as a membrane bound protein [8]. Whether the other candidate ligands that we have identified act as direct ErbB
receptor ligands or are capable of modulating their activity remains to be determined.
These ligands and other previously identified ligands used
in the evolutionary analyses are shown in Table 1. There
are several interesting points about the identified ligands
and the species that are represented. The putative invertebrate ligand, argos, which was thought to be an antagonist, was omitted from this analysis since it was found to
act not on the receptor, but by interacting with ligand to
carry out its antagonistic activity [9]. The ligand spitz was
found in several invertebrate species in addition to Drosophila and in these species spitz had the splice site
between the fourth and fifth cysteines, unlike spitz from
Drosophila. The newly identified keren that is highly
homologous to spitz was only found in Drosophila and G.
morsitans, though interestingly no spitz was identified in
G. morsitans. This does not prove that it does not exist,
simply that it was not found via homology (BLAST [10])
searches. In addition, gurken, without the splice site, was
found only in Drosophila; whereas vein was found in several additional invertebrates, with the splice site present in
all species including Drosophila.
ErbB family ligands are generally proteolytic cleavage
products from diverse multidomain transmembrane proteins, with only the EGF module conserved across this
large family of ligands. It is for this reason that the analysis
was carried out only on the conserved EGF module from
each of these diverse ligand precursors. A potential downside of this approach is the loss of the statistical power of
longer sequences. To address this potential problem, sev-

eral trees were constructed using neighbor-joining methods with several different methods for the distance
calculations. Inclusion of all the ligands yielded vastly different trees for the different methods; as a result, we examined the invertebrate and vertebrate ligand phylogenies
independently. The invertebrate tree (Fig. 1) exhibits several interesting features. The tree supports the hypothesis
that one ligand, represented by Caenorhabditis lin-3,
diverged into the multiple ligands found in the other

invertebrates. The strong sequence similarity between
non-Drosophila and Drosophila invertebrate spitz is in
agreement with spitz being the predominant EGF receptor
ligand in Drosophila growth and development [11,12].
Interestingly, the function of keren in Drosophila is still
unclear. At the other end of the tree is the secreted ligand
vein that exhibits more sequence variability between species than does spitz. Similar ligands were found in species
in addition to Drosophila, but it remains to be seen if vein

from these species is also a secreted ligand. The divergence
of vein, the absence of gurken in other invertebrates, and
the closely related spitz and keren suggest interesting
branch points in developmental evolution of the invertebrates.
The vertebrate ligands and potential ligands in Table 1
were used to construct consensus sequences (Fig. 2). The
conservation observed within each ligand for the canoni-

cal ErbB3/ErbB4 ligands is generally higher than the conservation observed within each ligand for the canonical
EGF receptor ligands. How does the extent of conservation translate into function or survivability, since a higher
conservation rate would suggest less tolerance for mutations? Examination of mice that have been made null for
some of the ligands shows that only NRG1 is embryonic
lethal with cardiac and nerve defects [13]. There are two
ligands, HB-EGF and NRG2, the absence of which results

Consensus sequences for the mammalian ligands
Consensus sequences for the mammalian ligands. Alignment was generated in ClustalX [60]. To minimize errors in amino acid
sequence from the DNA sequences used in the analysis, a conserved residue was called conserved if it was in at least 75% of
the sequences for an individual ligand. In the alignment, gaps are denoted by a dash (-) and non-conserved residues are indicated by an X. Reverse text (white text on black background) denotes residues that are at least 75% conserved among the different ligands, with grey shaded text (black text on grey background) denoting residues that are different at these conserved
positions. Shown for comparison at the bottom is the sequence of human EGF and numbering for the mature ligand.
in postnatal lethality [14-16], while knockouts of BTC
[14], AR [17], EGF [17], EPR [18,19], TGFα [20,21], NGC
[22], and the triple null AR/EGF/TGFα [17] are all nonlethal, at least under laboratory conditions. TGFα and
NGC are the only ligands tested so far that are highly conserved but when absent are not lethal. In NGC null mice
the defects were in synaptic transmission and the females
exhibit a decrease in caring for their litters [22]; these
defects could result in decreased survival outside of the
laboratory environment. Mice null for TGFα do not display any deficit in fertility or lactation [20,21]. The high
degree of conservation of TGFα is not due to a low
number of sequences used to derive the consensus
sequence or the 75% cutoff used to minimize the effect of
sequencing errors, so the absence of a profound effect of a
knockout of TGFα is surprising. One possibility is that
TGFα mutations may have effects on viability of either the

parent or offspring that are not apparent in the controlled
laboratory environment.
An unrooted tree with the labeled ligand family branches
is shown in Figure 3. There are some differences in the tree
depending on the method of generating the tree; however,
certain features persist regardless of the method of analysis. Generally the tree segregates into EGF receptor ligands
and ErbB3/ErbB4 ligands as seen previously [1], with
NGC segregating with IMP2 and the mucins. The specific
placement of epigen within the EGF receptor ligand
branch depends on the method of generating the tree,
while the other newly identified ligand, NGC, segregates
with IMP2 and the mucins near the split between the EGF
receptor and ErbB3/ErbB4 ligands, interesting considering
the characterization of NGC as only binding to ErbB3 [5].
The two tomoregulins segregate together on what appears

of ligands relative to each other were comparable. Similar trees were generated using the Phylip [62] group of programs.

to be the EGF receptor portion of the tree (Fig. 3); however, an initial characterization of tomoregulin1 suggested
that it was able to stimulate only ErbB4 [4]. This placement might be due to the method of analysis in constructing the tree, yet the different methods of generating the
tree yielded the same placement of TR1 and TR2 near the
BTC/TGFα pair. One interesting feature of the tomoregulins is a histidine prior to the sixth cysteine that is an
arginine in all the other proteins that have been verified as
a ligand (Fig. 2), which might alter its receptor interaction
in an unknown way. Interestingly, one of the additional
putative ligands identified in this study, IMP2, also has a
histidine at this position, while another, MUC12, has a
threonine, and three others, MEP2α, MUC4, and MUC17
are variable at this position.
There are several additional features of the tree that are
worth noting. One is the placement of the viral ligands
within the tree. The orthopox ligands segregate with the
EGF/EPR pair, avipox segregates with AR/HB-EGF, while
the leporipox, yatapox, and capripox ligands segregate
with NRG4. This segregation mirrors the ligand binding
properties of the shope fibroma and myxoma growth factors (leporipox) that were found to bind to ErbB3 in the
presence of ErbB2, though the shope fibroma growth factor was also able to bind to ErbB1, while vaccinia growth
factor (orthopox) bound to ErbB1 [23]. The variola
growth factor (orthopox) was also found to only interact
with ErbB1 [24]. The different positions and binding specificities of the viral ligands raise questions of viral evolution, specifically with regard to viral hosts and reservoirs
and when the different viruses acquired the different ligands. Additionally, the sequence analysis and tree generation suggests that the proteins termed muc3 for rat and
mouse in NCBI (AAB83956 and AAH46639, respectively,
but there are multiple accession numbers for mouse) are
actually muc17 as has been detected in the automated
protein screens for mouse (XP_355711). In addition the
teleost amphibian mucins 3, 12, and 17 segregate separately from the rest of the mucins 3, 12, and 17. The
branching pattern of these three mucins is comparable to
a recent analysis of mucin phylogeny using different
domains from the mucins [25].
Another feature of the tree is the apparent pairing of the
ligands, suggestive of gene duplication events. Within the
EGF receptor ligand branches these pairs include TR1/
TR2, TGFα/BTC, AR/HB-EGF, and EPR/EGF. One interesting point about these apparent gene duplications is the
differential receptor specificity for binding within each
pair (Table 1). With the exception of the tomoregulins,
which do not appear to follow this pattern, within each
pair one is more specific for the EGF receptor (TGFα, AR,
and EGF), while the other has a broader receptor specificity (BTC, HB-EGF, and EPR). Although, the functional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/79

significance of this apparent cross-specificity between ligand pairs is still unclear, it is suggestive of co-evolution of
the ligands and receptors and the retained interdependent
function after gene duplication in this family of receptors
and ligands.
Some of the pairs that branch identically in the different
trees are TGFα/BTC, AR/HB-EGF, NGC/IMP2 and TR1/
TR2. While other pairs also segregate together, they do not
have as high as similarity in the different trees as these
pairs do. The branching patterns of the different pairs suggest different evolutionary pathways of the ligand pairs,
and the different patterns might suggest different functions in the various species. The TGFα/BTC pair exhibits a
simple branch with TGFα from all species examined on
one side of the branch point and BTC from all species
examined on the other side of the branch point, suggesting that the duplication event occurred prior to divergence
of the vertebrate species examined (data not shown). This
branching pattern is also seen for the NGC/IMP2 pair. The
AR/HB-EGF branching exhibits a particularly interesting
branching pattern (Fig. 4A). For this pair, the apparent teleost AR homologue, AHP, is actually more similar to HBEGF than AR and branches off first. There are several possible explanations for this tree form that depend on differential sequences of gene duplications and speciation. The
main point from any of the potential orders of gene duplications is that there is no direct homologue to tetrapod AR
in teleosts, and conversely, there is no direct AHP homologue in tetrapods.
The TR1/TR2 pair has a different branching pattern (Fig.
4B), with both ligands in the teleost lineage segregating
together and both tetrapod ligands segregating together.
This pattern of branching could suggest independent gene
duplications after the divergence of the two lineages or
one gene duplication event that created the two ligands
that then diverged with the divergence of the teleosts and
tetrapods. It is noteworthy that the sequences labeled TR2
in the teleost lineage are two residues shorter than teleost
and tetrapod TR1 and tetrapod TR2, which are the same
length (Fig. 4C), supporting a difference in the requirement for sequence constancy between the two lineages,
but it is unclear how this relates to the potential gene
duplication events. In this comparison there are only
sequences from teleosts and tetrapods, inclusion of
sequences from additional orders might help differentiate
these different possibilities. These different patterns of ligand evolution for the AR/HB-EGF and TR1/TR2 pairs
argue against the indiscriminate extrapolation of function
that the ligand might have in teleosts to its function in
higher vertebrates, though this does not preclude a ligand
from divergent lineages from having similar functions.

Detailed trees for the AR/HB-EGF and TR1/TR2 pairs. (A) The AR/HB-EGF pair from the tree in Fig. 3. HB-EGF exists in both
teleosts and tetrapods, but there is no teleost AR, while the teleosts do have a second sequence labeled AHP, which is slightly
more similar to HB-EGF than to AR. (B) The TR1/TR2 pair from the tree in Fig. 3. This tree shows an additional duplication
pattern with both TR1 and TR2 forms in the teleosts segregating together. This tree is complicated by the different ligand
length for TR2 in the teleosts compared to the rest of the ligands on this branch. The difference in length does suggest an alteration in the sequence requirement for TR2 in the teleosts. (C) Tomoregulin 1 and 2 sequences from human and zebrafish.
These sequences are representative of the sequences from other species. TR2 is two amino acids shorter in the zebrafish than
the other sequences. Reverse text (white text on black background) denotes residues that are at least 75% conserved between
the four ligands, with grey shaded text (black text on grey background) denoting residues that are different at these conserved
positions.

Receptors
Unlike the ligands, no new members of the ErbB receptor
family have been identified since our earlier analysis [1],
only receptors from additional species. A list of the species
for each of the four receptors used in the following analyses is given in Table 2. Figure 5 shows the consensus
sequences for teleosts and tetrapods of the four vertebrate
receptor subtypes for the extracellular domain through
the kinase domain. The C-terminal regions were omitted
because they are highly divergent among the different
receptors, though they were included in the construction
of trees for the receptors (Fig. 6). As for the ligands, several
methods were used to construct unrooted trees for the
receptors, but unlike the ligand trees, there is no significant difference in the trees from the different methods
used, and all methods yield a tree similar to that previously constructed [1]. The additional sequences used to
construct this tree support the notion that three gene
duplication events generated the four receptors seen in
vertebrates (Fig. 6). The first gene duplication generated
ErbB1/ErbB2 and ErbB3/ErbB4 precursors. The presence
of one receptor in the deuterostome invertebrate C. intestinalis supports the placement and the timing of the two
large scale gene duplication events in the early divergence
of the vertebrates [26,27]. The ErbB1/ErbB2 and ErbB3/
ErbB4 precursors each underwent a second gene duplication event to generate the four receptors present in vertebrates. In addition, both ErbB3 and ErbB4 underwent an
additional round of gene duplication in the teleosts, as
evidenced by the two copies of each of these receptors
[28]. These gene duplication events raise issues about the
functional interactions of the four tetrapod receptors. It is
known that the receptors undergo heterodimerization
and that this heterodimerization is functionally relevant,
suggesting that conservation of the ability to form functional heterodimers must have played a role in the evolution of the current receptors with their interdependent
functions. ErbB3 has an inactive kinase [29,30], but it is
still required for functional development [31,32]. ErbB2
has no known ligand, but it still functions as a dimerization partner [33,34]. The conservation within each of
these two receptors across species supports the functional
importance for the differences between receptor subtypes,
but the differences within receptor subtypes across species
(discussed below) raise questions as to when these functional differences might have arisen. Further investigation
of the function of the receptors in various species should
yield insights into the question of when these functional
differences arose.

The availability of two crystal structures with different ligands [35,36] aids in an initial analysis of co-evolution of
ligands and receptors. This analysis is complicated by the
fact that the two ligands within the dimer do not interact
in an identical manner with each receptor monomer. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/79

will focus on several residues within the receptor that
interact with ligand in both structures, Tyr45, Glu90,
Val350, Asp355, Phe357, and Gln384 (Fig. 5, residues
labeled ^; EGF receptor numbering). A summary of the
amino acids in these positions in the different receptor
classes is in Table 3. In the crystal structures, Tyr45 interacts with Arg22 in TGFα or with Met21 or Ile23 in EGF
depending on the monomer within the dimer (for EGF
numbering see Figure 2). Arg22 and Met21 are the equivalent positions in the two ligands, but the differences in
the residue from EGF (Met21 or Ile23) that interacts with
the same residue in the receptor (Tyr45) highlight the
malleability of the ligand-receptor interaction. The amino
acid at position 90 in the receptor is mainly Glu and is in
close proximity to Lys28 in EGF or Lys29 in TGFα, which
are equivalent residues. While it may appear straightforward to consider the favorable ionic interaction between
these oppositely charged residues, the Lys at this position
is not conserved and in some instances in EGF it is a Ser.
Previous mutagenic analysis of this residue has shown
that while this ionic interaction between oppositely
charged residues is not required for ligand binding, it does
contribute to ligand affinity [37]; however, it is unclear
how the specific residue present at this position within a
given species affects binding. The hydrophobic Val at
position 350 of the receptor interacts with Leu15 of EGF
or Phe17 of TGFα, which are equivalent residues, but the
hydrophobicity of the residue at receptor position 350 is
not maintained across receptors. The amino acid at receptor position 355 is almost completely conserved as Asp,
while it is Asn in ErbB2 from zebrafish, mouse, and
golden hamster. This residue contacts Arg41 in EGF or
Arg42 in TGFα, which are equivalent residues. This residue in the known ligands is also almost invariant, differing from Arg only in the tomoregulins where it is either
Tyr, Gln, or His. In human EGF, mutation of Arg41 to His
results in a decrease in binding; however, the observed
decrease in affinity may not simply be due to a change in
the interaction of this residue with Asp355 in the receptor,
because this mutation also perturbs the secondary structure of human EGF [38]. Such structural effects of amino
acid substitution could explain how TR1 and TR2 segregate with the canonical EGF receptor ligands (Fig. 3), but
bind to ErbB4 [4]. The amino acid at receptor position
357, which is typically aromatic, interacts with Tyr13 in
EGF or Phe15 in TGFα, which are equivalent residues.
This residue is either Tyr or Phe across the ligands, except
for TR2 in two teleosts where it is Ser. The typically polar
amino acid at receptor position 384 interacts with Gln43
and Arg45 in EGF or with Glu44 in TGFα. Gln43 of EGF
and Glu44 of TGFα are equivalent residues and are highly
conserved within each ligand, though not necessary
between ligands. These residues point to the similar binding mode of the two ligands, but it is unclear how the
potential differences in binding might lead to differences

Consensus sequences for the teleost and tetrapod ErbB receptors
Consensus sequences for the teleost and tetrapod ErbB receptors. The alignment was generated in ClustalX [60]. To minimize
errors in amino acid sequence from the DNA sequences used in the analysis, a conserved residue was called conserved if it
was in 75% of the sequences. In the alignment, gaps are denoted by a dash (-) and non-conserved residues are indicated by an
X. Reverse text (white text on black background) denotes residues that are at least 75% conserved between the different ligands, with grey shaded text (black text on grey background) denoting residues that are different at these conserved positions.
The color bars along the top denote different subdomains within the receptor: red, subdomain I; magenta, subdomain II; green,
subdomain III; cyan, subdomain IV; yellow, transmembrane; blue, intracellular juxtamembrane domain; and orange, kinase
domain. The sequences start at the beginning of the second exon, and the residue numbers are for the human receptors. The
regions or residues of interest are: (A) extended regions that are not well conserved in ErbB2 sequences; (B) extracellular juxtamembrane region that is alternatively spliced in ErbB4 yielding a long and short form; (C) the one glycosylation site that is
conserved in the four receptors; (D) regions in the kinase domain where ErbB3 differs relative to the other three receptors,
corresponding to the C-helix (D1) and the activation loop (D2); (E) the C-terminal portion of the kinase domain that has
receptor-specific sequences and has been shown to be involved in mediating high affinity binding; (#) residue involved in subdomain II-subdomain II interactions in the receptor dimer and subdomain II-subdomain IV interactions in the tethered receptor
monomer; (&) and (*) residues involved in subdomain II-subdomain II interactions in the receptor dimer; (+) residues involved
in subdomain II-subdomain IV interactions in the tethered receptor monomer; and (^) residues that interact with ligand.

protein sequences in MEGA version 3.1 [61]. Shown are the bootstrap percentages for the split between invertebrate and vertebrate receptors. Similar trees were generated using different methods of distance correction. The invertebrate receptors
lead into the vertebrate receptors separating ErbB3 and ErbB4 from EGF receptor and ErbB2. This structure suggests three
gene duplication events, depicted by the filled circles, the first generating EGF receptor/ErbB2 and ErbB3/ErbB4 progenitors.
Two more gene duplication events generated the four receptors seen in the vertebrates.

amphibians, suggesting that this insert occurred after the
divergence of the amphibians and amniotes. It is not clear
what role this insert might have in the loss of ligand binding, but it raises the question of whether the teleost or
amphibian ErbB2 receptor is capable of binding ligand or
whether it functions similarly to the mammalian receptor,
as a dimerization partner without ligand.

In our previous analysis we noted the high conservation
(~90% identity) between individual ErbB2 receptor
sequences with two regions having less overall identity
[1]. Both of these less conserved regions align with
sequences in the EGF receptor that are in close proximity
to bound ligand [35,36,39,40]. The addition of sequences
from more diverse species does not yield new insights into
the unconserved region located at the subdomain III-subdomain IV junction (Fig. 5, labeled A2), but does yield
more insight into the region located in subdomain I (Fig.
5, labeled A1). This unconserved region, compared to the
other three receptors, was noted as an insert in ErbB2.
Interestingly, this insert does not occur in the teleosts or

The extracellular juxtamembrane region of ErbB4 also
exhibits differences among species. In mammals this
region exhibits alternative splicing [41] generating a long
form and a short form (the long form is shown in Fig. 5,
labeled B). There is a functional difference between the
two isoforms, with the long form susceptible to inducible
proteolytic cleavage, while the short form is insensitive to
cleavage [41,42]. Interestingly, only the short form is

present in teleosts. The presence of the long form of ErbB4
in the tetrapods suggests an additional function or regulation of the ErbB4 receptor in tetrapods that is not present
in teleosts.
It was noted previously that only one N-linked glycosylation site (N599, EGF receptor numbering) was conserved
among all of the vertebrate receptors [1]. Examination of
the additional vertebrate receptor sequences currently
available shows that all of these vertebrate sequences,
except for the EGF receptor from X. tropicalis, contain this
glycosylation site (Fig. 5, labeled C). It is unknown what
role this glycosylation site might play in receptor maturation or function.
Since our previous analysis, the solution of crystal structures of the extracellular domains from the receptors [4347] suggested a mechanism of ligand binding and receptor dimerization in which an intramolecular tether stabilizes the unliganded monomeric receptor and release of
the tether allows a structural rearrangement permitting
high affinity ligand binding and receptor dimerization
[48]. There are three main extracellular regions of the ErbB
receptors that are involved in either tether formation or
dimerization. Two regions are in the dimerization arm of
subdomain II. One region in subdomain II is involved in
both interactions; it makes contact with the second region
in subdomain II from another monomer to form the
dimer or with subdomain IV from the same monomer to
form the tether. The residues in subdomain II of one monomer that are involved in interacting with the opposing
subdomain II from a second monomer are Tyr246,
Pro248, and Tyr251 (Fig. 5, residues labeled # (246) and
& (248, 251); EGF receptor numbering). Tyr246 is conserved in all vertebrate receptors, while the amino acid at
position 248 is Pro in EGF receptor, ErbB4, and teleost
ErbB2, Lys in ErbB3, and predominantly Thr in ErbB2
from tetrapods. The amino acid at position 251 is Tyr in
tetrapod EGF receptor, His in teleost EGF receptor, and
Phe in ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. These three residues
interact with several residues in the other monomer that
include, Phe230, Phe263, Ala265, Tyr275, Cys283, and
Arg285 (Fig. 5, residues labeled *; EGF receptor numbering). Positions 230 and 283 are invariant, while position
263 and 275 are either Phe or Tyr; 263 is Phe in EGF receptor and ErbB2, Tyr in ErbB4 and tetrapod ErbB3, and
either Phe or Tyr in teleost ErbB3, while 275 is Tyr in EGF
receptor and ErbB2 and Phe in ErbB3 and ErbB4. The
amino acid at position 265 is Ala in EGF receptor, ErbB2,
and ErbB4, while it is Gly in tetrapod ErbB3 and Ser in teleost ErbB3. Position 285 is Arg in EGF receptor, tetrapod
ErbB3, and ErbB4, Leu in ErbB2 (except for zebrafish
where it is Met), and Ser in teleost ErbB3 (except for one
version in tetraodon where it is Arg). This pattern of
amino acids at the positions that mediate the interaction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/79

between the two monomers most likely reflects the different preferences for homo- and heterodimerization. ErbB2
and ErbB3 exhibit little to no homodimerization; differences at these sites may contribute to the inability of these
receptors to homodimerize.
The tether is formed by the intramolecular interactions
between subdomain II and subdomain IV. The residues
involved in this interaction are Tyr246, Asp563, His566,
and Lys585 (Fig. 5, residues labeled #, +; EGF receptor
numbering). Tyr246 is the same residue involved in the
dimer interface discussed above. The amino acids at positions 563 and 585 are invariantly Asp and Lys, respectively, while 566 is His in EGF receptor and tetrapod
ErbB3, Phe in teleost ErbB2, variable in tetrapod ErbB2,
His or Tyr in teleost ErbB3, and Asn in ErbB4. The high
conservation of these residues suggests that tether formation occurs in all receptors, with the possible exception of
tetrapod ErbB2. The potential lack of tether formation in
tetrapod ErbB2 is consistent with the crystal structure
obtained for ErbB2, which is in an untethered monomeric, but dimer-competent conformation. The observed
conservation in teleost ErbB2 of residues involved in
tether formation raises the question as to whether it has
the ability to form the tether and therefore functions differently than tetrapod ErbB2. This issue was raised earlier
in consideration of the insert present in the ligand binding region of tetrapod ErbB2 but not in teleost ErbB2.
Mutagenic analyses of the receptor have shown that tether
formation is important in ligand affinity [43,49,50]. It has
recently been shown that the extent of tethering of the
monomeric receptor can be measured with an antibody
(m806) that recognizes a sequence in the EGF receptor
that is not accessible in either the tethered monomeric
state or the dimeric state [51]. In addition, alteration of
the sugar moieties affects the tethered state, with a
decrease in oligosaccharide processing present in mutant
or overexpressed receptors leading to an increase in the
amount of untethered receptor [52]. This suggests a
potential role of receptor processing in receptor signaling.
Recently, it was shown that in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells there is incomplete glycosylation at Asn579
(EGF receptor numbering) [53], a site that is conserved
only in tetrapod EGF receptor (Fig. 5, residue labeled %).
Mutagenesis of this consensus glycosylation site
(Asn579Gln) showed that the receptor without glycosylation at this site was more untethered than wt EGF receptor
and had altered ligand binding, suggesting that the tethered receptor is stabilized by the presence of the N-linked
oligosaccharides at this site [54]. This might suggest that
compared to the other receptors in the family, the tetrapod EGF receptors may have acquired an additional
method of regulating signaling by modulating the extent
of intramolecular tethering by glycosylation at Asn579.

The other regions previously highlighted fall within the
kinase region of the receptors. We noted a lack of conservation in two regions within the kinase domain of the
human receptors that correspond to the C-helix and activation loop (Fig. 5, labeled D1 and D2, respectively).
Comparison of these regions from the additional species
in this study supports the lack of conservation between
receptor subtypes and points to additional receptor subtype differences in these regions. For the EGF receptor,
ErbB2, and ErbB4 there is complete conservation of
sequences in the C-helix (Fig. 5, labeled D1) within each
receptor; while the teleost ErbB3 sequences have very little
conservation and the tetrapod ErbB3 sequences have
nearly complete conservation. Within this region the consensus sequences from ErbB3 vary greatly from those of
the other three receptors; the other three receptor subtypes
are over 50% identical. Similar to the C-helix, the region
in the activation loop exhibits high conservation within
each receptor subtype, except for ErbB3 from teleosts,
with ErbB3 sharing very little identity with the other
receptors (Fig. 5, labeled D2).

region would suggest that they may have another important functional role.

The remaining region of the kinase domain that we previously examined corresponds to the c-terminal portion of
the kinase domain. What was observed was not a lack of
conservation within this domain, but what appeared to be
receptor subtype specific differences in particular residues
in this region (Fig. 5, labeled E). The present analysis supports the identification of these residues and extends this
region further into the kinase domain. The intracellular
portion of the receptors that has been reported to mediate
high affinity binding [55-57] corresponds to this region in
the kinase domain. It was thought that this region was
involved in either direct protein interactions with the
other kinase domain within the dimer or that this interaction was mediated by an accessory protein.

Insight into the functioning of the ErbB receptors is
gained by taking into account the evolution of the receptors. The additional receptor sequences used in this analysis support the previous conclusion that three gene
duplication events led to the present set of four receptors
in the tetrapods. The additional sequences also raise interesting questions about when ErbB2 lost its ligand binding
capability and the role that it plays as a dimerization partner. Examination of residues involved in ligand recognition supports a general model of ligand binding, but x-ray
crystal structures of ErbB3 and ErbB4 with bound ligands
are needed to address whether the ErbB3/ErbB4 ligands
bind similarly to their receptors and how subtle differences in ligand binding lead to differences in receptor signaling.

Recently, a direct protein-protein interaction for this Cterminal region in kinase activation was found [58].
Instead of forming a symmetric interaction that leads to
kinase activation an asymmetric interaction was found in
which only one of the kinase domains in the dimer is
thought to be active at any one time. This asymmetric
dimer occurs via the C-terminal region of one kinase that
interacts with the C-helix and juxtamembrane region of
the other kinase leading to the activation of this kinase
within the dimer. These results elegantly explain certain
characteristics of the ErbB receptor family, specifically the
presence of the ligand-less dimerization partner ErbB2
and the kinase inactive, but functional ErbB3. While these
results support the difference in the ErbB3 sequence in the
C-helix compared to the other three receptors (Fig. 5, D1),
the results do not explain the high conservation of these
residues in tetrapod ErbB3. If this region is not needed for
kinase activation, the high conservation of residues in this

Conclusion
Examination of the ErbB receptor family and their ligands
from both biochemical and evolutionary viewpoints
yields insights into the functioning of the receptor and ligand families. The additional ligand sequences that have
become available since our earlier analysis [1] support our
characterization of an ErbB receptor ligand by the presence of a splice site in the coding region for the fourth and
fifth cysteines and the placement of the EGF module near
the transmembrane domain. These criteria were used to
identify several potential new ErbB ligands in previously
identified proteins. Except for the newly identified
tomoregulins (which lack the conserved Arg before the
sixth cysteine) the ligands segregate into canonical EGF
receptor ligands and ErbB3/ErbB4 ligands. Except for the
placement of the tomoregulins, this branching pattern is
suggestive of an interesting co-evolution of the ligands
and receptors.

Methods
Protein sequences were obtained from GenBank at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information, Ensembl,
TIGR, or other public databases. Sequences were identified via Blast [10] searches utilizing full length receptors
or EGF modules. For the ligands, only the EGF module
was used because across the ligands this is the only conserved domain. These searches yielded a variety of
sequences depending on the database being searched.
Where these searches yielded predicted genes, comparisons of these genes to the human sequences were carried
out to verify that the predicted genes were complete. This
was especially important for receptor searches, since the
automated gene predications can skip exons, especially
short ones. The skipped exons were then identified in the
parental DNA (contig, scaffold, or higher order sequence
compilation) and these were then used to construct full

length DNA sequences. Where only locations in the
parental DNA were found, GENSCAN [59] was used to
identify exons and splice sites. If in this procedure any
exons were missed, the same procedure described above
was carried out to obtain full length DNA sequences. The
quality of the sequences used ranged from cDNA and est
sequences up to at least 7X genomic coverage. This leads
to the potential that proteins used in the analysis will have
a certain error rate inversely proportional to the quality of
the sequencing data. All DNA sequences (see Additional
file 1 for accession numbers) were converted to amino
acid sequences for subsequent analyses. Consensus
sequences were derived by comparing the sequences at
individual positions and calling that position conserved if
the percentage of the most likely amino acid occurred
above the desired threshold. In defining a consensus
sequence, a residue only had to be in 75% of the
sequences to take into account the potential errors in the
sequences. The use of the 75% cutoff balances the potential for calling a residue conserved when it really is not
against calling a residue not conserved due to poor
sequence quality when it is conserved. Protein alignments
were carried out using ClustalX [60] with no adjustment
of the default parameters. Bootstrapping (500 replicates)
was carried out using MEGA (version 3.1) [61] or the
Phylip group of programs (version 3.5) [62] using neighbor-joining or minimum evolution methods and several
models of amino acid substitution, including poisson correction and Jones, Taylor & Thornton (JTT). Several methods of analysis were carried out to minimize any potential
problems of carrying out a phylogenic analysis on the
short EGF module used in these analyses, though this
does not guarantee the accuracy of the obtained trees.
