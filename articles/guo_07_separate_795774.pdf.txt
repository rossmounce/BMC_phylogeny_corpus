Abstract
Background: The nucleotide compositional asymmetry between the leading and lagging strands
in bacterial genomes has been the subject of intensive study in the past few years. It is interesting
to mention that almost all bacterial genomes exhibit the same kind of base asymmetry. This work
aims to investigate the strand biases in Chlamydia muridarum genome and show the potential of the
Z curve method for quantitatively differentiating genes on the leading and lagging strands.
Results: The occurrence frequencies of bases of protein-coding genes in C. muridarum genome
were analyzed by the Z curve method. It was found that genes located on the two strands of
replication have distinct base usages in C. muridarum genome. According to their positions in the
9-D space spanned by the variables u1 – u9 of the Z curve method, K-means clustering algorithm
can assign about 94% of genes to the correct strands, which is a few percent higher than those
correctly classified by K-means based on the RSCU. The base usage and codon usage analyses show
that genes on the leading strand have more G than C and more T than A, particularly at the third
codon position. For genes on the lagging strand the biases is reverse. The y component of the Z
curves for the complete chromosome sequences show that the excess of G over C and T over A
are more remarkable in C. muridarum genome than in other bacterial genomes without separating
base and/or codon usages. Furthermore, for the genomes of Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema
pallidum, Chlamydia muridarum and Chlamydia trachomatis, in which distinct base and/or codon
usages have been observed, closer phylogenetic distance is found compared with other bacterial
genomes.
Conclusion: The nature of the strand biases of base composition in C. muridarum is similar to that
in most other bacterial genomes. However, the base composition asymmetry between the leading
and lagging strands in C. muridarum is more significant than that in other bacteria. It's supposed that
the remarkable strand biases of G/C and T/A are responsible for the appearance of separate base
or codon usages in C. muridarum. On the other hand, the closer phylogenetic distance among the
four bacterial genomes with separate base and/or codon usages is necessary rather than occasional.
It's also shown that the Z curve method may be more sensitive than RSCU when being used to
quantitatively analyze DNA sequences.

Background
The compositional asymmetry between the leading and
lagging strands in bacterial genomes has been the subject
of intensive study in the past few years [1-11]. It is interesting that almost all bacterial genomes exhibit the same
kind of asymmetry [3,5,8,9] i.e., there is an excess of
nucleotides G relative to C in the leading strand and of C
to G in the lagging strand, which is frequently accompanied by an abundance of T over A in the leading strand
[3,8-11]. There is not a relationship between base composition biases and genomic G+C contents [1,3,8]. The
excesses of G relative to C and T relative to A can be generally measured by GC skew and AT skew, which are given
by (G-C)/(G+C) and (A-T)/A+T), respectively [1]. The GC
skew (and AT skew) has (have) been used to map or relocate the replication origins of many bacteria such as Mycoplasma genitalium [12], Treponema pallidum [13] and
Borrelia burgdoreferi [14]. Several plausible explanations
have been proposed that account for the biases in base
composition, which have been partly summarized in four
recent papers [5,7-9]. It seems that the cytosine deamination theory enjoys the most attention among the theories
aimed at explaining strand biases [6,9]. The deamination
of cytosine leads to the formation of uracil. In normal circumstance in vivo, cytosine is effectively protected against
deamination because of the Watson-Crick base paring [6].
But the rate of cytosine deamination increases 140 times
when the DNA is single-stranded [15,16]. If the resulting
uracil is not replaced with cytosine, C to T mutation
occurs. During the process of replication, the leading
strand is more exposed in the single-stranded state [17].
Therefore, the C to T mutation occurs more frequently in
the leading stand than in the lagging strand and the
excesses of G(C) relative to C(G) and T(A) relative to A(T)
are formed in the leading(lagging) strand.
The single base biases may propagate into higher-order
biases in a correlated way, thereby changing the relative
frequencies of codons and even amino acids of genes and
encoded proteins in each of the replicating strands [9].
Salzberg et al. observed the oligomer skews in about a
dozen of bacterial genomes [4]. Rocha et al. observed
compositional asymmetry between the genes located on
the leading and lagging strands at the level of codons and
amino acids [18]. Mcinerney showed that genes in B. burgdoreferi have two significantly different codon usages,
depending on whether the gene is transcribed on the leading or lagging strand of replication [19]. Strand-specific
codon usage bias was not a new observation, but for the
first time it could be shown that the codon usage of the
genes in both strands of replication was separate [19].
Frank and Lobry suggested that the separate codon usages
observed in B. burgdoreferi may be an exceptional case [6].
Interestingly, the separate codon usages of the genes tran-

scribed on the two strands was also observed in T. pallidum and C. trachomatis, respectively [20,21].
The complete genome sequence of Chlamydia muridarum
has been reported [22]. In this paper, we show that C.
muridarum genes have two separate base usages (or nucleotide compositions at three codon positions) depending
on whether the gene is transcribed on the leading or lagging strand, using the Z curve and CA methods (Different
from [19-21], where CA of RSCU was carried out). There
is also significant difference between the codon usage of
the genes encoded on the two strands. The difference
between the y component of the Z curves for C. muridarum
and E. coli chromosome sequences may be advantageous
to understand the appearance of the separate base usages
in C. muridarum.

Results and discussion
(1) Strand-specific base usage biases revealed using CA of
u1 – u9
For each of the 909 genes in C. muridarum, the nine variables u1 – u9 were calculated, which correspond to a point
in a 9-D space. In order to visualize the distribution of
mapping points in the 9-D space, project them onto a 2D plane spanned by the first and second principal axes
using the CA method. The first and second principal axes
account for 28.0% and 23.8% of the total inertia of the 9D space, respectively. And no other axes account for more
than 12%. Figure 1 shows the position of the genes on the
2-D principal plane. As can be seen, all the genes are separated into two distinct clusters with little overlap, which
indicate the genes in the two clusters have different base
usage.

On inspection, it was found that the two groups correspond to the genes that are transcribed either in the leading strand or in the lagging strand, respectively. According
to the locations of the origin and termination of replication determined using GC skew [22], 498 genes are
located on the leading strand and the other 411 ones are
located on the lagging strand. The genes transcribed in the
leading and lagging strands are denoted by open crosses
and open circles, respectively, in Figure 1. This phenomenon, i.e., separate base usages of the genes in the two
strands of replication, is similar to the separate codon
usages observed previously in B. burgdorferi [19], T. pallidum [20] and C. trachomatis [21], where CA of RSCU was
used instead of CA of the variables u1 – u9. The base usage
of the genes in the two strands is listed in Table 1. As we
can see, the genes in the leading strand have a large excess
of G to C and a little excess of T to A, particularly at the
third codon position. While for the lagging strand, contrary case occurs. This observation agrees with the universal pattern of strand compositional asymmetry that
appears in almost all the bacterial genomes. The cause of

axes using the correspondence analysis of the nine variables
u1 – u9 for 909 genes of the C. muridarum genome. The genes
transcribed on the leading strand are denoted by crosses,
whereas the genes located on the lagging strand are denoted
by open circles. The partition between the two categories of
points in the plot shows that the genes located on the two
strands of replication have separate base usages.

the strand compositional asymmetry is attributable to the
disparity in the mutational bias (or the superimposition
of a differential mutation rate and a differential correction/repair rate, as suggested by some researchers)
between the leading and lagging strands. Among those
theories aimed at explaining the strand biases, the cytosine deamination theory enjoys the most attention [6,9].
It should be noted that for the genes in the leading strand,
the frequencies of G is less than that of C at the second
codon position, which is contrary to the case at the other
two codon positions. This may indicate the selection for
efficient translation or possibly selection at the level of
amino acid composition [23].

(2) Using the K-means clustering of u1 – u9 to differentiate
quantitatively genes in the two strands of replication
To differentiate quantitatively genes in the leading and
lagging strands according to their positions in the 9-D
space spanned by the variables u1 – u9, K-means clustering
is employed based on the nine variables u1 – u9. It is obvious that the number of classes K is assigned to be 2. Consequently, 852 of the 909 C. muridarum genes are
clustered into the right classes, i.e., about 94% of the
genes have base usage typical of their own strand. The
other 57 are wrongly clustered. Among them, 18 belong
to leading strand and 39 belong to lagging strand. As mentioned above, in B. burgdorferi, T. pallidum and C. trachomatis genomes, separate codon usages of the genes in the
two strands of replication has been observed by other
researchers using CA of RSCU. Here we tackle this issue
using the Z curve method. For each genome, the nine variables u1 – u9 are calculated for each gene. Then K-means
clustering is employed based on u1 – u9 and the results are
listed in Table 2. As we can see, for B. burgdorferi, T. pallidum and C. trachomatis genomes, 96.9%, 89.5% and
93.3% of the genes are assigned to the correct strand,
respectively. From Table 2, it's also found that there are
more genes located on the leading strand than in the lagging strand, which has been observed previously by many
other researchers [3].
(3) Codon usage bias
The individual base biases may propagate into higherorder biases in a correlated way, thereby changing the relative frequencies of codons and even amino acids of genes
and encoded proteins in each of the replicating strands
[9]. The cumulative codon usage for the genes located on
the two strands of replication in C. muridarum is shown in
Table 3. The total numbers of codons in the leading and
lagging strands are 177130 and 146226 respectively. Chisquared test of RSCU is carried out to evaluate the difference in codon usage between the two classes of genes. Significance is examined at the 5% level (x2 value of 3.841).
Among 59 codons, 54 are found to be significantly different in leading strand versus lagging strand genes. The
codons are marked with << (the frequency in leading
strand is larger than that in lagging strand) or >> (the frequency in lagging strand is larger than that in leadding

strand). The 29 codons used more frequently in the leading strand are G-ending or T-ending, except TTA, ATA and
AGA. Only one of the 25 codons used more frequently in
the lagging strand is neither C-ending nor A-ending. The
outlier is CTT.
If K-means clustering is applied based on RSCU, then
842(842/909 = 92.6%) C. muridarum genes will be
assigned to the correct strands. The ratio is a little lower
than using the variables u1 – u9 of the Z curve method.
Similar result is observed for B. burgdorferi, T. pallidum and
C. trachomatis genomes. This may indicate that the Z curve
method is more sensitive than RSCU when being used to
quantitatively analyze the DNA sequences.
(4) Why do the separate base usages (or codon usages)
appear in some special genomes while not in other
genomes?
To our knowledge, the similar phenomenon, separate
base usages or codon usages of the genes located on the
leading and lagging strands has been observed in four bacterial genomes, B. burgdorferi, T. pallidum, C. trachomatis
and C. muridarum. In this section, we do not focus on the
underlying mechanism of the strand mutation biases,
which lead to the compositional asymmetry in turn. We
only want to give a possible clue about why the separate
codon or base usage appears in special genomes and not
in other genomes. The nature of the strand biases at the
level of base composition is the same in almost all the
bacterial genomes. But only several genomes have been
reported of the separate base or codon usages. These four
species have very different genome G+C contents, respectively, 28.6% (Borrelia burgdorferi), 40.3% (Chlamydia
muridarum),41.3%
(Chlamydia
trachomatis)
and
52.8%(Treponema pallidum). The common features of
these four genomes are discussed in the following.

Firstly, from the genome sequence, perhaps we can find
some clues related to the appearance of the separate

codon or base usage of the genes in the two strands of replication. To achieve this aim, the y components of the Z
curves of the complete chromosme sequences for Borrelia
burgdorferi, Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia trachomatis,
Treponema pallidum and E. coli K12 are investigated.
According to equation (1), the y component curve represents the plus of cumulative excess of G over C and T over
A. Due to this feature, the y component curve has been
used to successfully map the replication origin and termination for a recently sequenced archaea Methanoasarcina
mazei [24]. To allow convenient observation and direct
comparison among different genomes, the first base of the
chromosome sequence is shifted to the origin of replication for each genome in this study. In Figure 2(a), the y
component curves for four genomes with separate codon
or base usage being observed are shown. On the other
hand, the y component curve for E. coli K12 genome is
shown in Figure 2(b). The separate base or codon usages
of the genes in the two strands of replication is not
observed in E. coli K12, though the G/C and T/A strand
composition biases exist, too. Both the curves in Figure
2(a) and in Figure 2(b) are linear symmetry, which shows
the composition variation along the leading and lagging
strands are basically complementary. Consequently, only
the left half of each curve studied is adequate. The left half
of each curve is an approximate line with steady climb
along the DNA sequence. Let k denote the variation rate of
y component with the increase of base step. In fact, k is
equal to (G-C+T-A)/(G+C+T+A). Roughly calculating
from Figure 2, the k values for two spirochetes (B. burgdorferi and T. pallidum) and two Chlamydiae (C. muridarum
and C. trachomatis) are about 0.1 and 0.07, respectively.
However, the value of k for E. coli K-12 is less than 0.02.
Generally speaking, the k values for other bacterial
genomes are nearly equal to or less than that for E. coli K12 genome. The difference of the k values among the four
genomes and E. coli K-12 indicates that there are much
more GC and TA strand biases in the chromosome
sequences in the four bacteria than in other species. Then

it would be reasonable to propose that the remarkable
strand biases of GC and TA cause the appearance of separate codon or base usage in special bacterial genomes.

Furthermore, from the phylogenetic point of view, the
four genomes have the closer phylogenetic distance than
that with other class (or order). Borrelia burgdorferi and
Treponema pallidum belong to spirochaetes family. On the
other hand, Chlamydia muridarum and Chlamydia trachomatis belong to Chlamydia genera. According to Wolf et al.
[25] and Qi et al. [26], Spirochetes and chlamydiae are
grouped together in the evolutional tree. We would like to
believe that the closer phylogenetic distance among the
four genomes is necessary rather than occasional.

It's shown that protein-coding genes in C. muridarum
genome have two separate and significantly different base
(and codon) usages, depending on whether the gene is
transcribed on the leading or lagging strand of replication.
According to their positions in the 9-D space spanned by
the variables u1 – u9 of the Z curve method, K-means clustering algorithm can classify about 94% of the genes into
the correct strands, which is a few percent higher than
those correctly classified by K-means of RSCU. The
remarkable strand biases of G/C and T/A are supposed to
be responsible for the appearance of separate base or
codon usages in C. muridarum. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi, T. pallidum, C. muridarum and C. trachomatis have
closer phlygenetic distance than that with other class (or
order), in which the separate base and/or codon usages
have been observed.

(a) The y components of the Z curves for B. burgdorferi, T.
pallidum, C. trachomatis and C. muridarum genomes. (b) The y
component of the Z curve for E. coli K-12 genome. Comparing (a) with (b) and putting emphasis on the coordinate values, it is found that the y component increases or decreases
much slower along the DNA sequence for E. coli genome than
that for the other four genomes. Note that the y component
of the Z curve represents the plus of cumulative excess of G
over C and T over A. Therefore, there are remarkable
excess of G over C and T over A in the four bacterial
genomes.

The database
The C. muridarum genome DNA sequence and the annotation information were downloaded from GenBank ftp
site [27]. 909 protein-coding genes are listed in the annotation. GC skew with a non-overlapping sliding window
of 1000 bp was used to determine the origin and termination of replication, as described by Read et al. [22]. Consequently, the origin was assumed to lie before gene
TC0001, whereas the termination between genes TC0438
and TC0439.
The Z curve
The Z curve is a 3-D space curve constituting the unique
representation of a given DNA sequence in the sense that
for the curve and sequence each can be uniquely reconstructed from the other [28]. Denoting the cumulative
occurring numbers of the bases A, C, G and T in a DNA
sequence read from the 5' to the 3'-end by An, Cn, Gn and
Tn, respectively, we defined the Z curve in the following.
The Z curve consists of a series of nodes Pn, where n = 1, 2,

..., N, whose coordinates are denoted by xn, yn and zn. It
was shown [28] that:

xn
yn

= ( A n + Gn ) − (Cn + Tn ) ≡ R n − Yn
= ( A n + Cn ) − (Gn + Tn ) ≡ Mn − K n

zn

= ( A n + Tn ) − (Cn + Gn ) ≡ Wn − Sn
n = 0,1, 2,..., N , xn , yn , zn ∈ [− N , N],

where A0 = C0 = G0 = T0 = 0 and hence x0 = y0 = z0 = 0. Here
R, Y, M, K, W, and S represent the bases of puRine, pYrimidine, aMino, Keto, Weak hydrogen bonds and Strong
hydrogen bonds, respectively, according to the Recommendation 1984 by the NC-IUB [29]. The connection of
the nodes P0 (P0 = 0), P1, P2, ..., until PN one by one
sequentially by straight lines is called the Z curve for the
DNA sequences inspected.
The Z curve offers an intuitive and convenient approach to
study DNA sequences. By viewing the Z curve, some overall and local features of the sequence can be detected in a
perceivable way. Furthermore, the phase-specific Z curve
derived from the Z curve can be used for studying the
nucleotide compositions in DNA fragments or [30,31]
distinguishing the coding regions from the non-coding
ones [32-34].
The phase-specific Z curve
Suppose that the occurrence frequencies of the bases A, C,
G and T at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions in a gene
are denoted by ai, ci, gi and ti, respectively, where i = 1, 2,
3. On the basis of the Z curve theory [28], ai, ci, gi and ti are
mapped onto a point in a 3-D space Vi with the coordinates

xi

= (ai + gi ) − (ci + t i ),

yi
zi

= (ai + ci ) − ( gi + t i ),
= (ai + t i ) − (ci + gi ),
i = 1, 2, 3, xi , yi , zi ∈ [−1,1].

K-means Clustering method
K-means clustering method [37] is adopted to differentiate quantitatively the leading and lagging strand genes
according to their positions in the 9-D space (spanned by
the variables u1 – u9) and 59-D space (spanned by RSCU
values of codons, excluding three stop codons and the
codons encoding for Met and Trp). K-means is a statistical
method used to cluster data set into the given K classes
based on the similarity of the elements. The idea in this
method is to find a clustering (or grouping) of the observations so as to minimize the total within-cluster sums of
squares. In this case, it sequentially processes each observation and reassigns it to another cluster if doing so results
in a decrease in the total within-cluster sums of squares
(referring to [37] for the details).

Then, each gene may be represented by a point or a vector
in a 9-D space V, where V = V1 ⊕ V2 ⊕ V3, here the symbol
⊕ denotes the direct-sum of two subspaces. The nine components u1 – u9 of the space V are defined as follows

u1 = x1 , u2 = y1 , u3 = z1 ,
u4 = x2 , u5 = y2 , u6 = z2 ,
u7 = x3 , u8 = y3 , u9 = z3 .

Correspondence analysis
Correspondence analysis (CA) is a classical technique to
reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming
to a new set of variables (the principal components) to
summarize the feature of the data [35]. The new set of variables is derived from the linear combination of the original variables. The first principal axis is chosen to
maximize the standard deviation of the derived variable
and the second principal axis is the direction to maximize
the standard deviation among directions un-correlated
with the first, and so forth. For details about this method,
refer to [36].

We thank the anonymous reviewers for valuable suggestions. We also
thank Professor Chun-Ting Zhang for carefully reading the manuscript and
