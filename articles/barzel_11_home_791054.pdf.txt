Home and away- the evolutionary dynamics of
homing endonucleases
Adi Barzel1,2*, Uri Obolski3, Johann Peter Gogarten4, Martin Kupiec1 and Lilach Hadany3

Abstract
Background: Homing endonucleases (HEases) are a large and diverse group of site-specific DNAases. They reside
within self-splicing introns and inteins, and promote their horizontal dissemination. In recent years, HEases have
been the focus of extensive research due to their promising potential use in gene targeting procedures for the
treatment of genetic diseases and for the genetic engineering of crop, animal models and cell lines.
Results: Using mathematical analysis and computational modeling, we present here a novel account for the
evolution and population dynamics of HEase genes (HEGs). We describe HEGs as paradoxical selfish elements
whose long-term persistence in a single population relies on low transmission rates and a positive correlation
between transmission efficiency and toxicity.
Conclusion: Plausible conditions allow HEGs to sustain at high frequency through long evolutionary periods, with
the endonuclease frequency being either at equilibrium or periodically oscillating. The predictions of our model
may prove important not only for evolutionary theory but also for gene therapy and bio-engineering applications
of HEases.

Background
Self-splicing introns and inteins are genetic elements that
are transcribed as part of genes; they remove themselves
from the transcript before translation (introns) or from
the translated protein (inteins) [1,2]. Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are molecular parasites that are frequently encoded as open reading frames on class I introns,
or as part of inteins [3]. The recognition site of these
HEases is so large that they cleave a genome only in one
or very few places. This has prompted attempts to use
HEases in gene therapy and in the genetic engineering of
large and complex genomes [4-6]. HEases have been
designed to target disease-associated genes, such as XPC
[7] and RAG1 [8], to induce targeted integration in cell
lines [9,10], and for targeted mutagenesis in crop [11]. In
the natural host, a HEase promotes the horizontal propagation of its respective intron/intein into an intron-less or
intein-less allele by cleaving the vacant allele to induce
double strand break repair by homologous recombination
(HR). The finding that the HEases encoded in inteins and

introns belong to different endonuclease families [12,13]
reveals that the unions between HEGs and self-splicing
elements occurred several times, possibly because both
HEases and introns/inteins evolved to target similar sites
[14]. This union between self-splicing elements and endonucleases created molecular parasites, which have to be
regarded as distinct evolutionary units, and whose fate is
intertwined but separate from the fate of the host protein
and the host organism [15]. The life cycle of inteins/
introns with HEGs has been described by the homing
cycle [16,17]. The homing cycle addresses the following
dilemma: if the HEase is very successful, after a short
phase of super-Mendelian inheritance, the HEase targets
in all members of the population will be occupied by a
HEG; however, once the HEase has ran out of substrate,
its activity is no longer under purifying selection; the HEG
begins a decay process, resulting in self-splicing elements
that lost the ability to home. At the end of this decay process are class I introns that do not encode HEases, and
mini inteins, i.e., inteins without a HEase domain. Once
the dysfunctional HEG is fixed in the population (through
drift or by the selective disadvantage conveyed by the
active HEase), the splicing element can be deleted, thus
returning the homing cycle to its beginning. In case of

introns, the precise deletion may occur via a processed
mRNA intermediate [18,19]. Inteins can only be eliminated by random precise deletion, which may be very rare.
A precise deletion likely is required to retain a functional
host protein, because inteins and class I introns are found
in the most conserved parts of conserved proteins, and an
imprecise deletion likely would yield a non-functional
protein [20].
Support and discrepancies encountered by the homing
cycle model

The homing cycle is based on fixation within and transfer
between populations [16,17,21]; however, the homing
cycle usually was evaluated on the basis of transfer
between species. The transfer of HEG containing inteins
and introns across species boundaries is revealed through
the high sequence similarity of these molecular parasites
found in distantly related organisms [17,22,23]. In many
instances, where closely related organisms were sampled,
the phylogeny of the HEG was found not to agree with
the phylogeny of the host [15,16,24-26]. This confirms
the inter-species transfer of HEG containing elements, in
agreement with the homing cycle model as formulated
for species.
However, some recent findings suggest that HEGs can
persist in a single species over very long periods of time.
For example, molecular parasites with functional HEGs
were found in the apparently asexual amoeba Naegleria
[27], and the PRP8 intein with HEG persisted over long
periods in euascomycetes ([21] provide an estimate of over
500 million years) under purifying selection [28] and without any evidence for their horizontal transfer. Gogarten
and Hilario [21] discuss three possible explanations for the
long term persistence of HEG containing molecular parasites: (a) the molecular parasites may have acquired a function that provides an adaptive advantage to the host, (b)
the homing cycle could operate on a subpopulation level
in a spatially distributed inhomogeneous population, (c)
the super-Mendelian inheritance may be balanced by
selective disadvantages that the HEase and the self-splicing
element confer to the host organism. For the latter case
Yahara et al. [29] showed that stable equilibria can exist,
in which all three types of homing sites coexist in a wellmixed population but only under the highly unlikely
assumption that the reduction in fitness resulting from
carrying a dysfunctional HEase is higher than the reduction in fitness due to the functional HEase. For more realistic conditions, when the cost of the functional HEase is
higher than the cost of the dysfunctional HEase, only periodic solutions were reported by [29] that are similar to a
typical Lotka-Volterra type predator-prey system [30] with
the trajectory following the phases of the homing cycle
(invasion, fixation, decay, complete loss; however, the fixation phase does not go to completion, and reinvasion

occurs from within the population). Under these conditions and for the parameter choices analyzed by Yahara
et al. [29] the average frequency of alleles with functional
HEG is low, often verging on extinction during each cycle
of the trajectory. This finding is in conflict with the observation that functional HEGs are often sampled from
natural populations, suggesting high frequency.
We therefore decided to explore more thoroughly the
possibility of long-term persistence of functional HEGs
at high frequency. Using analytical and simulation
approaches, we study the behavior of an iterative model
that simulates allele frequencies of HEGs in randomly
interbreeding populations. We report on conditions that
allow for the long-term persistence of functional HEGs
at high frequency, and we explore the parameter choices
under which the persistence of HEGs at high frequency
is dynamically stable and evolutionarily stable. We find
that, for the range of parameters analyzed, a HEG can
persist at high frequency if the effective homing frequency per generation is low, which can be accomplished either through low homing efficiency, or
through low frequency of sexual recombination. We
also find that an internal equilibrium can be reached
with the HEG being at a high frequency, if the self-splicing sequence in which it resides is to some extent
toxic. Finally, we find that for these solutions to be evolutionarily stable, in the sense of [31], requires a positive
correlation between the homing frequency and the fitness cost of the HEG, an assumption that we discuss
and regard as biologically plausible.
We note that the relative fitness of the three alleles in
competition represents an incarnation of the rock-paperscissors game (Figure 1). In pair-wise competition the
three alleles form a circular inequality. Given previous
explorations of similar non-transitive interaction systems
(e.g., [32]), the finding of stable and evolutionarily stable
equilibria in a spatially homogenous implementation of
the rock-paper-scissors game is surprising and may be
relevant for the field of game theory.

Results
Model

Our model aims to describe the evolutionary dynamics of
HEGs in populations of organisms engaging in genetic
exchange. We assume that mating and genetic exchange
are random, that generations are discrete and non-overlapping and that selection acts at the haploid stage. We
assume the population is large enough to neglect the effect
of genetic drift, and allow no gene flow into or out of the
population. All organisms in the population are considered
isogenic apart from a single gene with three different
alleles: X - an allele harboring no insertion sequence; Y an allele harboring an intron or an intein but no functional
HEG; and Z - an allele harboring an intron or an intein

Figure 1 A Molecular Rock-Paper-Scissors game: The relationships between carriers of the X, Y and Z alleles are descried through
three inequalities (I, II, III). (I) Z outcompetes X because of the activity of the homing endonuclease during sex (with probability hm), (II) Y
beats Z, and (III) X beats Y because of the decrease in relative fitness associated with the homing ability (parameter t) and with the splicing
element (parameter s). The central arrows depict the serial succession of the state of a particular homing endonuclease target site: The empty
target site (X) is converted to Z through invasion by the homing endonuclease; the homing endonuclease in a Z allele can undergo mutation to
become a Y allele with a dysfunctional homing endonuclease, which provides immunity to invasion by Z. Finally, a precise deletion of the
intein/intron can restore the empty target site.

encoding for a functional HE. The frequencies of the X, Y
and Z alleles are designated x, y and z respectively, with
x + y + z = 1.
We assume that a homing endonuclease can degenerate at a rate u per generation - converting a Z allele to a
Y allele (Additional file 1, Table S1 also showing respective notation in [29] to allow comparison of the two
models). The reciprocal conversion is neglected. Unlike
the endonuclease activity, a complete degeneration of the
splicing function is detrimental for the organism because
it impairs the function of the host gene. Modeling the
inactivation of the HEG by a single rate constant is a simplification; more subtle changes in either splicing or
cleaving efficiency are considered in detail below. The
model allows both the Z and the Y alleles to undergo

precise elimination at a rate v per generation, giving rise
to an X allele. The X allele can in turn be converted to a
Z allele only through homing. We assume that nonHEase induced gene conversion is globally reciprocal and
hence negligible. For the same reason, we allow no X to
Y conversion. In our model, v is taken to be much smaller than u. Precise intron erasure can occur by gene conversion between a genomic Y or Z allele and the cDNA
of its transcript [18,19], or through gene duplication
through an mRNA intermediate. Complete intein abolition may be rarer because it relies on serendipitous precise deletion. The effect of homing on the Z- and X-allele
frequencies is determined by two parameters: m - the
rate of mating or horizontal gene transfer per generation
and h - the probability of homing in a diploid carrying an

X allele and a Z allele (or the rate of homing in a merodiploid carrying a genomic X allele and an exogenous Z
allele). We note that the factors h and m do not occur
independently of each other in our equations, and that
the product hm is a measure of the flux from Z to X
being proportional to x*z. Finally, we assume that the
insertion sequences may have an effect on the fitness of
the organism. We define the relative fitness of an organism carrying an X allele to be 1. An organism carrying a
Y allele has fitness 1-s, and an organism with a Z allele
has fitness 1-s-t, with s and t being non-negative and
small.
While homing endonucleases are usually considered to
be molecular parasites, they may at some point in evolution become beneficial to their host[21,33,34], which
would translate to t < 0 in our nomenclature. Clearly, an
allele that increases fitness of its carriers can be driven
into fixation. A striking example is the HO endonuclease
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is an evolutionary
derivative of a HEG that has acquired an essential role in
the yeast mating type switch[35]. During its domestication
process, HO has lost its ability for super-Mendelian inheritance. In particular, it is not coded within an intron or an
active intein and is not flanked by homologies to its target
site. Here we are interested in the evolutionary persistence
of homing endonuclease parasites as such. We are interested in the persistence of the homing ability and its linkage to intron/intein mobility. We therefore chose to put
aside the case of t < 0 in order to focus on the tri-partite
dynamic between two symbiotic parasites (intron and
HEG) and their host that takes place for t ≥ 0 values. We
define t to be the toxicity of the homing activity of the
endonuclease, which is assumed to have a non-negative
value, as is also assumed for the fitness cost of the insertion sequence (s).
We study the above model analytically and numerically
to find and describe the parameter sets allowing the evolutionary persistence of homing endonucleases (Z alleles).
We derived a set of three recursive functions describing
the X, Y and Z allele frequencies at the n+1th generation
given their frequencies at the nth generation for a given
parameter set {u, v, h, m, s, t} (see derivation in additional
file 2, Table S2). The symbol W stands for the average fitness of the population W = x + (1-s)y + (1-s-t)z:
xn+1 =

This interplay between the alleles allows the HEG to
be maintained in a population, if the frequency of the
three alleles reaches either equilibrium (e.g. Figure 2a)
or periodic oscillations (e.g. Figure 2b). Notably, when
equilibrium is reached, it is often reached as the damping of oscillations, and in finite populations it is sensitive to stochastic perturbations to an extent discussed
below.
In contrast to previous reports [29], we find a plausible range of parameters that allows all three alleles to be
maintained at an internal equilibrium with the HEG (Z
allele) being at high frequency (e.g. Figure 2A). The

conditions and inter-dependencies between the parameters that define this range can be discerned from an
analysis of the equilibrium equations: x n+1 = x n and,
y n+1 = y n (and therefore also z n+1 = z n ). The analysis
leads to some non-trivial, perhaps even surprising, conclusions demonstrating the uniqueness of the evolutionary dynamics of homing endonucleases.

E.g. zeq > 0.5 ⇒ t ≤ s + 2v.
Analytical bound 3

For an internal equilibrium to be maintained with the
Z allele being at high frequency, both the Y and the Z
alleles must have a reduced fitness with respect to the X
allele. In particular, because the parameter s must be
larger than or equal to a non-negligible positive number:
yeq
u (1 − t) (1 − v) − v
xeq
. In other words, the insertion

sequence must be toxic in order for the HEG to reach
high equilibrium frequency.

For an internal equilibrium to be maintained with the
Z allele being at high frequency, the transmission rate
of the HEG must be low (albeit, above a positive
threshold). In particular, the product hm must be
smaller than or equal to the small number:
v
s+2
u
t+
,. We note that selection of

various Z alleles in the presence of empty target sites
(i.e. high x) would favor high homing ability, at least
until specificity is optimal and any further increase in
homing ability is accompanied by increased toxicity
(see below). Therefore, we would expect to find homing endonucleases persisting at high equilibrium levels
only in organisms characterized by low rates of genetic
exchange (low mating and or low recombination rates).

Comparison with the Yahara model

We and Yahara et al. [29] have used similar models with
similar goals and reached strikingly different conclusions. Yahara et al. found stable internal equilibria to be
possible only under the condition that the decrease in
fitness resulting from carrying a dysfunctional HEase is
higher than the decrease in fitness due to the functional
HEase. Otherwise, they have identified only periodic
solutions. In contrast, we found a significant and biologically plausible range of parameters allowing for stable

Barzel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:324
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/324

equilibria to be maintained, all under the assumption
that functional HEase decreases fitness more than dysfunctional HEase (namely, 0 < t). When we take a parameter set leading to stable equilibrium in our model
and input it into the Yahara model we do find a stable
equilibrium there as well (e.g. additional file 6, Figure
S1). We assume that Yahara et al. were unable to detect
the parameter range allowing for equilibrium because
they only included mutation in their calculations when
looking for equilibrium with z = 1. When searching for
internal equilibria, Yahara et al. acted under the explicit
assumption that mutation was a destabilizing factor,
therefore neglecting it altogether. In contrast, we have
shown that a positive mutation rate can facilitate the
establishment of a stable equilibrium. Moreover, the Z
equilibrium frequency in Additional file 6, Figure S1 is
low (z ≈ 0.092) because the parameter choice adheres to
the Yahara restriction (1-s) 2 = 1-s-t (b 2 = a in their
notation). When we allow s and t to be independent,
stable internal equilibria with high Z frequency are readily detected (See Additional file 7, Figure S2). In summary, the difference between the conclusions made by
Yahara and us does not result from model differences
(see Additional file 1, Table S1), but rather from the fact
that Yahara et al. did not explore the parameter space
exhaustively.
Computer simulation

To further elucidate the conditions facilitating the preservation of the Z allele we carried out a systematic sampling
of the parameter space. For each parameter set we used a
deterministic computer simulation starting with an initial
population consisting almost entirely of X alleles, a miniscule proportion of Z alleles (10-4) and no Y alleles. These
starting conditions best model actual populations being
invaded by HEGs. We stopped the simulation once equilibrium of allele frequencies has been reached. Equilibrium
was assumed if the last 10,000 generations had a standard
deviation, which was no more than 10-5. Additionally, if
frequency of the HEG went under 0.001 after having been
over 0.01, the frequency of z was given the value zero (to
avoid cases which are likely to be stochastically eliminated
in a finite population). In case no stable equilibrium was
reached, we plot the average frequency of Z in the last 104
of 106 generations. Our results are presented as phase diagrams depicting the evolutionary fate of the Z allele on
color scale as a function of its homing ability and toxicity
(e.g. Figure 3). For each phase diagram we sampled 104
different parameter sets by crossing 100 different choices
for the value of the product hm with 100 different choices
for the value of s. Different relations between s and t were
selected for each phase diagram as indicated, while u = 104
and v = 10-6 were taken to be constant and equal in all
phase diagrams.

Page 6 of 13

The sub-space of parameter choices leading to stable
allele frequency equilibria is bordered in our phase diagrams by a solid black line (Figure 3). Importantly, the
phase diagrams demonstrate that analytical bounds 1-3,
allowing high equilibrium frequency of the Z allele, are
tight, i.e. for almost any parameter set obeying these
conditions, the homing endonuclease will indeed reach a
high equilibrium frequency. Moreover, the conditions
allowing the Z allele to reach a high average frequency
in a limit cycle are a natural extension of the conditions
allowing it to have high equilibrium frequency:
1. Analytical bound 1 states that the insertion sequence
must be detrimental (s > 0) for an internal equilibrium to
be reached where the Z allele has a high frequency. Our
phase diagrams illustrate that s > 0 is furthermore a prerequisite for the Z allele to reach a high average frequency.
This condition is biologically plausible. Even if the intein
or intron has optimized its splicing activity, the insertion
sequence still bears with it the burden of replicating, transcribing and in the case of inteins also translating, hundreds of superfluous nucleotides.
2. Analytical bound 2 states that the endonuclease
activity cannot be significantly more toxic than the insertion sequence per se (t < ≈ s) for an internal equilibrium
to be reached where the Z allele has a high frequency.
Our phase diagrams demonstrate a clear trend for higher
average z values to be associated with a lower t/s ratio
(compare Figure 3a, b and 3c).
3. Analytical bound 3 states that an internal equilibrium with a high frequency of z is possible only when
the product hm is low, but not too low, so that hm > ≈ s
+t. For this reason, the values of hm are presented in the
phase diagrams as products of s+t. In congruence with
analytical bound 3, our phase diagrams demonstrate that
high average frequencies of the Z allele are possible only
when s + t < ≈hm < 2(s+t). Low rates of genetic exchange
are therefore necessary for long term HEG persistence.
Model predictions for finite populations

Our analysis so far assumed an infinite population. For
finite populations, genetic drift may delay, restrict or preclude the damping of the initial oscillatory dynamic (e.g.
Figure 4 and Additional file 8, Figure S3). When the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are smaller
than 1 but the eigenvalues do have imaginary parts (as is
typically the case in our stable area), a deterministic system approaches equilibrium through oscillations (e.g. Figure 2), and a finite population would exhibit some
oscillations around equilibrium. When the absolute value
of the complex eigenvalue is very close to 1, the oscillations decay slowly. Then the question is the rate of oscillations decay versus the strength of the perturbations
resulting from random sampling. In particular, when the
population is relatively small, so that drift results in

significant perturbations, the system does not converge to
equilibrium and sustains oscillations (e.g. Additional file 8,
Figure S3 A). In larger populations convergence to near
equilibrium does happen (e.g. Figure 4 and Additional file
8, Figure S3 B-D). This finding is in congruence with the
abundance of HEGs in unicellular organisms, which have
a larger characteristic population size (≥ 107 [36-39]).
Evolutionary stability

The dynamic stability of an allele frequency equilibrium is
not sufficient to guarantee the long term persistence of a
HEG in a real population [31]. This is because alleles with
different homing ability and different toxicity do arise by
mutation, threatening to disturb any status quo. Therefore,
we set out to explore the stability of equilibria with high z
values with respect to invasions by alleles with different
attributes in order to discern the conditions rendering a
homing endonuclease evolutionarily stable.
1. Invasions by Z’ alleles with different homing ability (h’)
and/or different homing related toxicity (t’)

All other parameters being equal, any mutation in a Z
allele giving rise to a Z’ allele having a higher specificity
should prevail (i.e., any Z’ allele with (h’ > h and t’ ≤ t) OR
(h’ ≥ h and t’ < t))). A particular Z’ may have a higher
equilibrium value or a higher oscillation average than did
Z, but if such invasions of Z alleles with higher specificity
are repeated, eventually they might lead to the fixation of
the HEG allele and to its subsequent degeneration. This
destructive scenario is avoided, if we assume that when
maximal specificity is obtained then the homing ability is
at its biological upper bound and the toxicity is at its biological lower bound. Evolutionary stability of Z is made
possible for a broader range of h and t values under the
biologically plausible assumption that once a threshold
specificity is obtained, (A) any possible rise in potency “h”
is accompanied by a rise in toxicity “t"; and vice versa: (B)
any possible decrease in t is accompanied by a decrease in
h (Figure 5A and 5B). We note that conditions A) and B)
may conflict for moderate values of h and t. Therefore, we
expect to find internal equilibria where the Z allele has a

high frequency, if the toxicity or homing ability of the
HEG is near the respective biological bounds.
2. Invasions by Y’ or Z’ alleles with lower intron/intein
related toxicity (s’)

A mutation in a Y allele can give rise to a Y’ allele with a
lower toxicity s’ < s. However Y’ may not invade because Y
is constantly regenerated by HEG degeneration. On the
other hand, if the mutation reducing s to s’ takes place in
a Z allele (a mutation in the splicing motif of the HEG
containing intron/intein) then the resulting Z’ allele and
its degenerated form Y’ are expected to win over Z and Y
respectively. As before, Z’ may have a higher equilibrium
value or higher oscillation average than did Z, but if such
invasions are allowed to repeat till s = 0 they will eventually lead to the fixation of a HEG allele and to its subsequent degeneration. Therefore, allele equilibrium with a
high Z frequency is evolutionarily stable only if the s parameter is at its physical lower bound, and only if the order
of magnitude of this lower bound is not in itself lower
than the order of magnitude of u. Again, this is biologically
plausible. The insertion sequence still bears with it the
burden of replicating, transcribing and, in the case of
inteins, also translating, hundreds of superfluous basepairs.
3. Invasions by an X allele with lower homing
susceptibility

From the host perspective, evading the HEG parasite
might carry a fitness benefit. A mutation in an X allele
occurring at the target site of the endonuclease can give
rise to an X’ allele with respect to which the Z allele has
a reduced homing ability (h’). Under some circumstances,
an invasion of this type may even increase the ultimate
frequency of Z by preventing its fixation. However, if
such invasions are repeated they will eventually lead to
s+t
the product hm being lower than
, pre(1 − u) (1 − v)
cluding the establishment of any equilibrium with z > 0
(analytical bound 3). To secure the long term stability of
the HEG, any reduction in the susceptibility of the empty

binomial sampling in a population of size N = 106,107 or 108 (A-C, respectively). The parameters used: s = 0.01, t = 0.001, hm = 0.0123, u = 10-4
and v = 10-6, are identical to those in Figure 2a and result in a stable equilibrium in the deterministic model.

allele for homing must be accompanied by a large
enough reduction in the fitness of the empty allele (h’ < h
⇒ fitness of X = 1-r’ where r’ > 0) (Figure 6). This idea
has valid biological support: Type I introns and inteins in
general, and with HEGs in particular, are almost always
found inserted in conserved sites of essential genes [40].
As a result of this pivotal location, if the host tries to
evade the homing endonuclease parasite by changing
nucleotides at the target site, then the host has to pay
the cost associated with altering a highly conserved
motif. Recently, in relation to HEG usage in gene therapy,
we showed that HEG target conservation allows
some HEases to specifically cleave human loci of medical
interest [5].

Discussion
Support for the model

At least in some HEG families, HEGs have persisted over
long evolutionary periods (up to 500 million years [21])
under purifying selection and without any evidence for
their horizontal transfer [27,28]. This is in conflict with the
idea of frequent HEG elimination and re-invasion [16,17]
and also in conflict with the notion of oscillating HEG frequency nearing extinction at every cycle [29]. It is instead

suggestive of a balancing evolutionary mechanism, keeping
the HEG-containing allele at high frequency although it is
usually associated with no fitness advantage for the host.
Direct evidence for our rock-paper-scissors model is
scarce. However, some indirect data imply that our predictions are valid. Vos and Didelot [41] compared recombination rates (Corresponding roughly to the hm values in our
model) in varied bacterial and archaeal species. All marine
bacteria surveyed (M. aeruginosa, M. chthonoplastes, P. shigelloides, P. ubique, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus)
were characterized by high recombination rates with the
exception of Microcoleus chtonoplastes. M. chtonoplastes is
also the only one of these species known to encode a HEG
(in the RIR1-2 intein). Amongst Eukaryotes, yeasts are particularly abundant with HEGs. Several studies indicate that
sex is yeast is indeed rare (as low as 1 out-crossing event in
50,000 generations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus [42] and as low as 1 sexual cycle in
1000 generations in S. paradoxus [37]) Finally, HEGs are
widespread in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Both of
these endosymbionts are notorious for their low rates of
genetic exchange [43,44].
Our analysis of finite populations exemplified how
genetic drift can sometime prevent the stabilization of

allele-frequency oscillations, endangering the long term
persistence of the HEG. The phenomenon is especially
pronounce in populations of smaller size, which may in
part explain the prevalence of HEG in unicellular organisms characterized by large population sizes[36-39].

Our prediction that some toxicity of the insertion
sequence is inevitable is supported by the positive correlation found between gene compactness and gene
expression [45-47]. We further predict that for long
term HEG persistence at high levels the toxicity of the

sequence to which homing is more difficult, as a function of the parameters of X’: the reduced homing ability (h’) and the cost to the
host (r). The colors correspond to the average Z frequency in the last 104 of 106 generations, u = 10-4, v = 10-6, and the rest of the parameters

endonuclease must not be higher than the toxicity of
the insertion sequence per se. Indeed, HEases were
shown to possess exquisite specificity. For example, the
I-SceI HEase from the mitochondria of the budding
yeast Sacharomyces cerevisiae (genome size ~8.5*104 bp)
has an extremely narrow and predictable range of cleavage sites in the human genome [48] (genome size
~3*109 bp) and little if any toxicity in human cells and
live mice [6,49]. Last, the importance and hence the
conservation of intron and intein insertion sites, as predicted by our model, have been repeatedly documented
[20].
Finally, according to our model, certain HEGs might be
stable in the short term but not in the long term, in the
sense that particular mutants that might lead to extinction
of the HEG can invade the population. In these cases the
long term pattern of HEG evolution might be that of the
homing cycle [21], but orders of magnitude slower.
Possible applications for the predictions of the model

It is interesting to assess our model not only from the
perspective of evolutionary biology, but also in terms of
the relevance of its predictions to gene therapy and
genetic engineering.
HEases may have very long target sites [3]. However,
given the degeneracy in target recognition [50], the

question remains whether many HEases, selected to
cleave small genomes of microbes, mitochondria and
chloroplasts would turn out to have a multitude of targets in the human genome and therefore would be
highly toxic. While most parasites (e.g. viruses) can balance their toxicity with their ability to propagate and
therefore could bear significant toxicity to their natural
host, the same is not true for HEases. The Rock-PaperScissors model we put forward asserts that the toxicity
of the HEase cannot be balanced by its ability to propagate but that in fact this toxicity is bound by the toxicity
of the intron or intein (see analytical bound 2). We
therefore expect the toxicity of the HEG to be extremely
low in its natural host, possibly implying reduced toxicity in human cells.
Finally, our analysis of the evolutionary stability of
HEG alleles in the face of X’ invasions is of importance
for future applications of HEases. We asserted that Z can
persist only if the reduction in homing ability associated
with the X’ allele is accompanied by a substantial fitness
cost. In other words, a HEase must base its target specificity on conserved base pairs that are crucial for the host.
The HEase target specificity, being the range of nucleotide sequences it can cleave, is highly predictable based
on knowledge of the degree of conservation of individual
sites along the target [24,51-54]. Furthermore, Because

Barzel et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:324
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/324

HEGs reside within introns or inteins found in conserved
motifs, finding a HEase target in the human genome may
often not be a random event but rather a result of evolutionary motif conservation from the HEG hosting
microbe to humans[5].
Our model of HEG population dynamics delineates
the under-recognized complexity of the evolution of
selfish elements. A better understanding of these fascinating molecular parasites could pave the way for their
wide application in gene therapy and bio-engineering.

Conclusions
We provide for the first time a plausible account for the
evolutionary preservation of HEGs. Admittedly, our model
is a simplification in that it assumes a large homogenous
mixed population, non-overlapping generations, selection
acting only at the haploid stage and more. However, even
under these simplified conditions, we find solutions in
which the active HEG can persist at high frequency over
long periods of time. This is in agreement with the fact
that HEGs are readily sampled from natural populations
of varied organisms [3]. Furthermore, our analysis delineates the conditions allowing long term HEG persistence.
In particular we find that long-lasting high frequencies of
the Z allele are possible only if the population is characterized by low rates of genetic exchange, if the insertion
sequence is to some extent toxic, if the endonuclease
activity is not significantly more toxic than the insertion
sequence per se, and if the target site is important for the
survival of the host.
When the first indications for long-term persistence of
functional HEGs in populations were uncovered, one
explanation was to assume spatially distributed, inhomogeneous populations, as was suggested for other biological non-transitive competition networks [32,55]. Here
we have shown that, perhaps surprisingly, spatial inhomogeneity is not a prerequisite for long-term persistence
of HEGs at high penetrance. We determined conditions
that are compatible with long-term HEG persistence,
and we find that these conditions are met in populations
that show a high frequency of HEGs.
