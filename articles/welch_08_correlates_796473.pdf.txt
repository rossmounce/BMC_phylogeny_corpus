Abstract
Background: Rates of molecular evolution in different lineages can vary widely, and some of this
variation might be predictable from aspects of species' biology. Investigating such predictable rate
variation can help us to understand the causes of molecular evolution, and could also help to
improve molecular dating methods. Here we present a comprehensive study of the life history
correlates of substitution rate variation across the mammals, comparing results for mitochondrial
and nuclear loci, and for synonymous and non-synonymous sites. We use phylogenetic comparative
methods, refined to take into account the special nature of substitution rate data. Particular
attention is paid to the widespread correlations between the components of mammalian life
history, which can complicate the interpretation of results.
Results: We find that mitochondrial synonymous substitution rates, estimated from the 9 longest
mitochondrial genes, show strong negative correlations with body mass and with maximum
recorded lifespan. But lifespan is the sole variable to remain after multiple regression and model
simplification. Nuclear synonymous substitution rates, estimated from 6 genes, show strong
negative correlations with body mass and generation time, and a strong positive correlation with
fecundity. In contrast to the mitochondrial results, the same trends are evident in rates of
nonsynonymous substitution.
Conclusion: A substantial proportion of variation in mammalian substitution rates can be
explained by aspects of their life history, implying that molecular and life history evolution are
closely interlinked in this group. The strength and consistency of the nuclear body mass effect
suggests that molecular dating studies may have been systematically misled, but also that methods
could be improved by incorporating the finding as a priori information. Mitochondrial synonymous
rates also show the body mass effect, but for apparently quite different reasons, and the strength
of the relationship with maximum lifespan provides support for the hypothesis that mtDNA
damage is causally linked to aging.

Background
There is now a great deal of evidence that rates of DNA
substitution can vary widely between closely related lineages [1-3], and while some of this variation is erratic and
locus-specific, trends also apply consistently across many
loci [2,4-7]. There is also increasing evidence, particularly
in vertebrates, that some of this lineage-specific rate variation may be predictable from aspects of a species' biology
[8-17]. Uncovering this predictable rate variation is an
important part of understanding the causes of molecular
evolution [18]. It may also bring practical benefits,
because variation in the rate of substitution complicates
the production of dated molecular phylogenies, which are
increasingly relied upon in diverse areas of biology. If reliable correlates of rate variation can be identified, this
information could be exploited to improve molecular dating methods [15,16,19,20].
The present study investigates the causes and correlates of
lineage-specific rate variation in mammalian protein coding sequences. Mammals were chosen because of the unrivalled availability of relevant data: mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA sequences, life-history records and comprehensive phylogenetic information [21,22]. In addition,
the timings of ordinal and higher-level radiations of the
mammals have been controversial, and systematic change
in substitution rates has been proposed as an explanation
of disagreements between molecular and palaeontological dating approaches [23-27].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/53

phylogenetically independent contrasts [33,34], combined with new procedures for establishing a minimum
comparison depth [37].
Another difficulty, particularly acute for mammals, stems
from the widespread correlations between all aspects of
their life histories and wider biology; these include not
just strong and ubiquitous allometries, but also strong
correlations between traits after correction for body size
[22,38-40]. These colinearities make regression analyses
particularly difficult to interpret, because a significant
result can always be plausibly attributed to some absent
variable covarying with the predictor. For example, many
comparative studies of mammalian aging have been criticised for failing to take into account the covariation of
lifespan with body mass [13,41,42]. Here, the problem of
covarying life history traits is mitigated by including, in a
single multiple regression analysis, most of the correlates
of vertebrate rate variation that have been identified or
hypothesised in the literature. Specifically, the variables
included are body mass [13,14,20,28], which has often
been used as a proxy for basal metabolic rate
[11,15,17,43-45],
organismal
generation
time
[8,9,14,28], fecundity [10,46], and maximum recorded
lifespan [13,32,41]. These variables are defined in detail
below, and an assessment of the various causal hypotheses with which they have been associated follows in the
discussion.

Results
Many previous studies have tested for correlates of mammalian rate variation [5,6,14,15,17,28-32], but no clear
consensus has emerged. One problem is that negative
findings have been difficult to interpret because of issues
surrounding statistical power in the comparative study of
substitution rates. In some cases, sample size was inflated
artificially by a failure to correct for phylogenetic nonindependence. This means that single instances of evolutionary change can be counted multiple times, and this
can increase both false positive and false negative error
rates [33,34]. Even studies that did take shared ancestry
into account, e.g. [14], did not always use appropriate statistical methods or diagnostic tests of the parametric
assumptions, and this too can yield misleading results
[35,36]. The question of statistical power is particularly
vexed in the study of substitution rates, because rates cannot be measured directly, but must be inferred from DNA
sequence data. For short sequences, or short periods of
divergence, a small number of substitutions can make a
large difference to the rate inferred, making the estimates
very noisy [16,37]. Accordingly, there is often a trade-off
between the number of data points in an analysis, and the
accuracy with which each data point estimates a change in
rate. In the present study, we address these problems by
using large multi-gene alignments, and the method of

Mitochondrial rates
The single variable regressions, summarised in Table 1,
show that of the four variables tested, body mass and
maximum lifespan are individually significant predictors
of mitochondrial synonymous substitution rates: Species
with greater mass, or longer lifespan tend to have slower
rates of synonymous substitution. The significant regressions are plotted in Figure 1a–d, together with their associated raw cross-species plots, which show closely similar
trends. A multiple regression analysis, including pairs
with measurements for all four predictor traits, shows that
only maximum lifespan remains significant (Table 2).
Furthermore, model simplification shows that lifespan
alone explains almost as much variation as does the fourpredictor model (Table 2). Table 3 contains results for the
larger subset of points for which lifespan and body mass
measurements were available (i.e., including those pairs
lacking fecundity or generation time data). Again, maximum lifespan was found to be the sole significant predictor. Diagnostic tests identified the sperm whale pair, Kogia
breviceps-Physeter catodon, as a weak outlier, and excluding
this pair increases the r2 to levels matching those in Table
2. (It is possible that the outlying nature of this point
reflects the recognised difficulties obtaining accurate
measurements of maximum lifespan for cetaceans: [47].)

To check for consistency across the major superordinal
groups, we carried out separate analyses for the three
clades with sufficient comparisons, namely Metatheria
(marsupials), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Carnivora,
Perissodactyla, Chiroptera, and some former Insectivora)
and Euarchontoglires (Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Scandentia, Dermoptera and Primates) [see Additional file 1]. For
both Metatheria and Laurasiatheria, results for all traits
are closely consistent with each other, and with the complete data set (for example, for body mass we have
Metatheria: n = 11, slope = -0.06, r2= 0.22; Laurasiatheria:
n = 21, slope = -0.11, r2= 0.24). For the Euarchontoglires,
by contrast, lifespan, fecundity and generation time had
slopes close to zero, and no visible trend in the raw crossspecies plots. Furthermore, in this group synonymous
rates actually appear to increase with body mass (Figure
1e–f), albeit with a non-significant regression (Euarchontoglires: n = 10, slope = 0.10, r2= 0.25, p = 0.12). Accordingly, we repeated the full analyses with the
Euarchontoglires excluded. For the two-variable regression (Table 3), results were not robust, with neither predictor reaching significance for the 27 remaining pairs,
but both reaching significance when the outlying sperm
whale pair was excluded (Table 3). However, for the subset of pairs with all variables measured, maximum
lifespan was again identified as the sole significant predictor (Table 2). Excluding Euarchontoglires also led to r2
values that were much higher in both cases (Tables 2, 3).
In stark contrast to results for synonymous substitutions,
mitochondrial nonsynonymous rates show no trend with

any of the predictor variables (Tables 1 and 2). This
applied equally to the independent comparisons, and to
the raw cross-species plots (not shown).
Nuclear rates
Plots for the nuclear synonymous data set are shown in
Figure 2. Table 1 shows that body mass, generation time
and fecundity are all significant predictors of nuclear synonymous rates. Lifespan, by contrast, shows no trend, but
this is attributable to two clear outliers, appearing as such
in both the diagnostic tests of the regressions (Fig. 2c) and
in the raw cross-species scatter-plots (Fig. 2d). (The two
small values are for Cynocephalus variegatus, the malayan
flying lemur, and Amblysomus hottentotus, the hottentot
golden mole). Removing these two outlying points makes
maximum lifespan, too, a significant predictor of synonymous rates (Table 1). Of course, these outliers could represent true biological variation, but problems with
maximum recorded lifespan as a statistic make measurement error particularly likely in this case [13,22,47,48].
(For example, recorded lifespan can only increase with
new observations, and so is strongly dependent on the
number of animals sampled; a species' suitability for captivity will also have an important influence.) If outliers are
excluded, then for each of the predictors, r2 values are
much higher than for the mitochondrial data set, even
when corrections for reduced sample size are made. Furthermore, and again in contrast to the mitochondrial
results, all effects apply consistently to Laurasiatheria and
Euarchontoglires (the nuclear data set contains no
Metatheria).

The multiple regression results for the nuclear data (Table
2) are unfortunately difficult to interpret. Model simplification leads to a model with generation time and fecundity remaining. But neither coefficient is individually
significant, and model fit is poor in several respects (for
example, the Shapiro-Wilks test shows significant departures from normality). More telling are the two-variable
regressions with body mass and lifespan (Table 3). For
nuclear rates, body mass is found to be the superior predictor, whether or not the outlying lifespan values are
excluded, and, in either case, lifespan drops out in model
simplification. This is the opposite result to that obtained
for the mitochondrial data set (Table 3).
Finally, and again in direct contrast to the mitochondrial
results, for the nuclear data set the same trends are
observed for both synonymous and non-synonymous
rates (Tables 1, 2, 3). While the non-synonymous data are
noisier, with generation time and longevity effects not
reaching individual significance, the slopes of the regressions are very similar (Table 1), and body mass is again
favoured over maximum lifespan in multiple regression
(Table 3).

Discussion
It is often possible to attribute an apparent change in the
rate of substitution to some other factor, such as misspecification of the substitution model, inaccurate divergence
dates, changes in base composition, or a transient and
locus-specific burst of adaptive changes. But the identification of significant predictors of rates, within the framework of phylogenetically independent comparisons
(Table 1; Figures 1, 2), is difficult to reconcile with any of
these explanations, and argues strongly that changes of
substitution rate are frequent and substantial within the
mammals. Conversely, the various sources of error inherent in the estimation of rates makes it probable that the r2

values estimated here – high as they are – are systematic
underestimates of the true relationship between rate and
trait. (Specifically, rate differs from traits such as body
mass, in that it must be estimated from the number of
substitutions accrued stochastically over a period of time,
which must in turn be estimated from comparison of
sequence data, and all of these factors can obscure the true
relationship between trait and rate [37].)
Implications for molecular dating
From the perspective of molecular phylogenetics, the
strength and consistency of the body size effect across our
nuclear data set is of particular interest: If such an effect

applies, concerted changes in the average body size of a
clade over time can create systematic biases in the molecular date estimates for that clade, even if variable-rate dating methods are used [16,19,49]. The same biases can
apply in the absence of concerted body size change, if
larger or smaller taxa are over-represented in the data sampled. For these reasons, if there was a concerted increase
in mammalian size between the late Cretaceous and early
Tertiary, or if larger mammals have been disproportionately sampled, then molecular date estimates of the ordinal level radiation of mammals could have been
systematically misled [16,23-26]. While the widespread
rate variation presents a problem for molecular dating, the
identification of robust predictors of rate gives grounds
for optimism. In particular, body size is both widely sampled for extant species, and can be estimated for extinct or
ancestral taxa from their fossil record. Consequently, this
information could be used to improve future molecular
dating methods, allowing the development of "corrected
molecular clocks", or empirically informed priors for
Bayesian approaches [15,19,20].
Mitochondrial rate variation, and mitochondrial theories
of aging
For the mitochondrial data set, maximum lifespan was
found to be the strongest predictor of synonymous rate
(Table 1), and was the sole significant predictor in multiple regressions (Tables 2, 3). This implies that the mitochondrial body size effect, e.g., [14] can be attributed
solely to the correlation of mammalian body mass and
lifespan [13,39-41]. In contrast, for the nuclear data set,
maximum lifespan dropped out of the model in favour of
body mass – even when outlying lifespan values were
removed (Tables 1, 2, 3). Together, these findings support
the longstanding, though still controversial, theory that
mitochondrial DNA damage is causally linked to aging
[17,50-54]. The possibility that this link is causal is
strengthened, ironically, by the many problems with maximum recorded lifespan as a statistic [13,47,48]. It has
been shown many times that maximum lifespan is a poor
proxy for typical longevity in the wild, with the two quantities differing substantially and unpredictably in many
cases [55,56]. As such, maximum recorded lifespan relates
only weakly to the realised life histories on which selection can act [39,40,57].

A link between mtDNA damage and mammalian aging
also has some direct experimental support. Premature
aging has been reported in mice expressing defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase [58-60], and an extension of
youthful lifespan shown to result from the over-expression
of mitochondrially-targeted catalase, but not of nuclear-targeted catalase [61]. However, there are also reports that
mitochondrial point mutations have no effect on mouse
lifespan [62,63]. These latter results might be consistent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/53

with recent modifications of the mitochondrial theory of
aging, implicating mtDNA deletions rather than point
mutations [51,52,54], and consistent with our results if the
two types of DNA damage are highly correlated in nature.
Although the precise mechanisms linking mtDNA damage to senescence are much disputed, most theories implicate Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): Mitochondria are the
major site of ROS production, and mtDNA a major site of
oxidative damage [50-52]. ROS production is an inevitable by-product of aerobic metabolism, and this raises the
possibility that the true determinant of substitution rates
is basal metabolic rate (BMR) [11,15,43,64]. BMR was not
included in the present study, but there are several reasons
to believe that its inclusion would not have altered our
conclusions. First, the correlation of BMR with body mass
is particularly strong in mammals [44,65], making it very
unlikely that lifespan would be identified as a better predictor than body size if BMR were the true causal factor.
Second, the mechanistic basis of the metabolic rate
hypothesis is doubtful, both because the basal rate is a
poor measure of total energy metabolism [65], and
because mammalian metabolism can be decoupled from
ROS production by various means [45,65,66]. Nuclear
DNA, where the body mass effect is strongest (Tables 1
and 3), also appears to be protected from mitochondrially-generated ROS [67]. Third, there is some evidence
that mtDNA damage can accelerate aging without increasing oxidative stress [59,60]. Finally, previous analyses of
substitution rates have not identified BMR as a significant
predictor when body size was also included in the model
[12,14,45].
Particularly revealing case studies come from species
whose ecologies have led to departures from the mammalian norm. For example, the naked mole rat, particularly
long-lived and metabolically slow for its size, shows peculiarly low levels of anti-oxidative defences, and correspondingly high levels of oxidative damage in its nuclear
DNA [68], but this might be attributable, paradoxically, to
reduced levels of ROS production in the mitochondria,
implying reduced levels mtDNA damage [68,69]. Just
such a situation appears to explain the greater longevity of
birds compared to mammals [52]. It would also be of
great interest to compare patterns of rate variation in Chiroptera, a group not well represented in the present study
[17,47,48,57,70].
A final puzzling aspect of the mitochondrial results is the
anomalous patterns shown by the Euarchontoglires – the
group that contains both rodents and primates, and so all
of the most highly studied mammalian models. For this
superordinal group, synonymous rate appears to increase
with body mass (Fig. 1e–f), and shows no trend with
lifespan. One possible explanation is that these results

Page 7 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:53

reflect the confounding influence of weak purifying selection. Theory has shown that, if certain assumptions hold,
we can expect a negative correlation between the mutation rate per year, and the fixation probability of weakly
deleterious mutants [18,28,71]. For example, if species
with higher mutation rates also have larger populations,
then the increased efficacy of purifying selection could
lead to a reduction in the rate of substitution due to
genetic drift. It is possible that weak purifying selection
acts on mitochondrial synonymous sites in mammals
[72], and there is also some evidence that the positive relationship between mutation rate and population size does
hold [73]. This effect is likely to be dampened by the complete linkage of mitochondrial DNA, which weakens the
dependence of substitution rate on population size
[71,74], but typical mammalian populations may be
small enough for drift-based effects to remain important
[75]. Furthermore, when linkage is tight, a negative correlation between mutation rate and the fixation probability
could still hold, if populations with higher mutation rates
per year, also have higher rates of adaptive substitution
per generation [71].
The hypothetical explanation given above remains incomplete, however, because it remains unclear why effects
counteracting the variation in mutation rates should be so
much stronger in the Euarchontoglires than in the other
major mammalian groups.
Nuclear rate variation and mammalian life history
Compared to the mitochondrial data, our nuclear data set
is smaller in every respect, and particularly in terms of the
fraction of the genome sampled. However, for the loci
studied, the influence of life history on substitution rate
appears to be even more pervasive.

For example, in common with previous studies, no successful predictor was found for mitochondrial non-synonymous changes [5,14,30], but our nuclear results were
similar for both classes of site (Tables 1, 2, 3). The nuclear
results contrast with some previous empirical studies
[14,29], and also contradict theoretical predictions, mentioned above, that the evolution of selected sites should be
relatively immune to variation in life history [71]. We cannot know whether our nuclear data set is representative, in
this respect, of nuclear loci in general, but examination of
the dN/dS ratios yields no evidence that levels of selective
constraint are anomalous (values for the 32 lineages in the
main data set range from 0.046 to 0.200 [see Additional file
1], which can be compared to results from complete
genomes of primates and rodents [76]). Furthermore, the
theoretical predictions rely on assumptions that are
unlikely to hold at all loci (e.g., the influence of population
size on levels of selective constraint may be slight for highly
leptokurtic distributions of selective effects [18]). Our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/53

results are also consistent with observations that a substantial component of nuclear nonsynonymous rate variation
in mammals is lineage-specific [2], and with the strong correlation between nuclear dS and dN [7] (for contrasting patterns in mitochondrial sequences, see [2,5,72]).
Results for our nuclear loci also contrast with the mitochondrial patterns in terms of the relative success the individual predictors. A strong effect of lifespan on nuclear
rates can be discounted, but no single other factor was
unambiguously favoured (Table 2). Nevertheless, the contrast between the two sets of results allows us to draw some
tentative conclusions about various causal hypotheses.
For example, the argument for body mass as a true causal
factor stems from evidence that larger bodied mammals
suffer increased risk of cancer [13,42], and that this might
select for increased DNA repair [13,41,77]. But this
hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with the comparative
weakness of the body size effect in mtDNA, where links
between mutation and carcinogenesis are well established
[62,77]. In contrast, the success of generation time as a
predictor of nuclear, but not mitochondrial rates, might
reflect differences in the biology of the two genomes. In
particular, germline mosaicism [78], where a large fraction of nuclear mutations appear in just one or two meiotic divisions, is certain to strengthen the correlation
between generation time and mutation rate per year;
while the replication of mtDNA is potentially decoupled
from cell division [72], weakening such a dependency.
A more perplexing result is the apparent increase in
nuclear rates with fecundity. Non-significant for mitochondrial rates, this predictor has an r2 of around 50% for
both classes of nuclear site (Table 1). It has been hypothesised that increases in fecundity might entail an increased
mutation rate [46], or reflect increased variance in offspring viability, and so lower effective population size
[79]. But given the limited variation in mammalian fecundity, it is unlikely that either of these explanations could
explain our results [22,80]. A third intriguing possibility
views germline mutation rate as an integral part of life history strategy [22,39,40], suggesting that species with fewer
offspring should invest more heavily in each, implying a
selective pressure to lower germline mutation rates [10].

Conclusion
We have presented a comprehensive study of substitution
rate variation in protein-coding sequences across the
mammals, and shown that for mitochondrial synonymous sites, and for both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in 6 nuclear loci, a substantial fraction of the
between-lineage rate variation can be explained by aspects
of life history.

The results imply that molecular dating studies of mammalian evolution might have been misled, particularly if
there was a systematic change in the life history of the
clade. However, future methods could exploit results presented here, incorporating measurements of body size as a
priori information about the substitution rates to be
inferred.
While both mitochondrial and nuclear rates show an
inverse correlation with body mass, the results differ in
important respects, implying that the causal mechanisms
are quite different in the two sets of loci. The success of
maximum lifespan as a predictor of mitochondrial rates,
and its comparative failure to predict nuclear rates, provides support for theories linking mtDNA damage to
aging. Causal interpretation of the nuclear results is more
difficult, but one conclusion is clear. Molecular change
may be decoupled from phenotypic change in the sense
that many changes in germline DNA may lead to vanishingly small changes in phenotype [18,28], but mammalian molecular evolution is nevertheless a part of life
history evolution, and the treatment of germline mutation
rates as a component of life history deserves further attention.

Methods
Genetic data
All genetic sequence data were obtained from GenBank
[81], and aligned by eye using Se-Al [82]. Accession Numbers are listed in the Data Supplement [Additional file 1],
and alignments are available on request.

For the mitochondrial dataset, the 9 longest protein-coding
genes (ATP6, COI, COII, COIII, CYTB, ND1, ND2, ND4,
ND5) were aligned for 160 mammalian species. (The four
short genes, less comprehensively sampled, were excluded
to increase taxonomic coverage.) The resulting data set
allowed us to choose at least one comparison pair from the
monotremes, from 5 of the 7 marsupial orders, and from
13 of the 19 'molecular consensus' placental orders [21].
The absent orders were small, containing just 100 species in
total, of which half are Afrosoricida.
For the nuclear data set, there was a clear tradeoff between
alignment length and taxonomic coverage. We chose a
data set consisting of partial coding sequences from 6
nuclear loci, which were available for 58 species. This data
set allowed us to choose pairs only for the Eutheria, but 16
of their 19 orders were represented. Genes and approximate sequence lengths are ADRB2 ~830 bp; ATP7A ~680
bp; BDNF ~590 bp; CNR1 ~1000 bp; EDG1 ~980 bp;
RAG2 ~740 bp. In addition to annotated sequences,
BLAST searches were carried out on genomic contigs from
Echinops telfairi (lesser hedgehog tenrec) and Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat; Lindblad-Toh, K., J. L. Chang, S.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/53

Gnerre, M. Clamp, and E. S. Lander, unpublished), confirming orthology by reciprocal BLAST.
Life history data
In most cases, the life history data were taken from the
PanTHERIA database of mammalian life history and ecology (K. E. Jones, J. Bielby, A. Purvis, D. Orme, A. Teacher,
J. L. Gittleman, R. Grenyer, et al. unpublished; [22]). Body
mass measurements were the unique median of adult (or
age unspecified) mass, of males and females, based on the
GLM equation ln(body mass) = species + sex. For two Chiropterans in the mitochondrial data set (Rhinolophus
monoceros and Chalinolobus tuberculatus) this value was
extrapolated from head-body length. Our measure of
fecundity was the product of litter size, and litters per year.
Litter size is the full median of offspring number born per
litter per female, counted before birth, at birth, or after
birth, based on the GLM equation ln(litter size) = species
+ litter size definition. Litters per year is the full median of
the number of litters per female per year for non-captive
individuals. Maximum lifespan was simply the maximum
recorded adult age from a wild or captive individual. To
supplement the PanTHERIA data, we obtained additional
measurements from the database AnAge (Build 9, Feb.
2006; [83]), which contains values from multiple recent
compilations from the literature. Our preferred proxy of
generation time was the unique median of age at first
birth. Values from the PanTHERIA database were supplemented by equivalent data from the compilation of
Wooton [84]. Because coverage remained insufficient for
a robust analysis, we also included some measurements
where generation time was defined as age at sexual maturity plus gestation period [14], with values obtained from
the AnAge database (Build 9, Feb. 2006; [83]).
Choice of phylogenetically independent comparison pairs
For the comparative analysis, phylogenetically-independent sister pairs were chosen from the recent species-level
supertree of all mammals [21,26]. Comparisons between
reconstructed states at internodes [33] were not included,
as these are problematic in the comparative study of substitution rates [see Additional file 2]. For three comparisons, no suitable outgroup was available, and so
molecular branch lengths were estimated from a split
along one of the lineages, rather than from the pair's common ancestor, making the pair paraphyletic with respect
to another pair. In each case the distance of the chosen
node from the common ancestor of the pair was small
compared to the total divergence between the pair. Nevertheless, in all three cases, rate estimates were corrected to
take into account the different time periods represented
by the two molecular branch lengths. Repeating analyses
with these pairs excluded was found to make little difference to the results (not shown).

Branch length estimation
Nonsynonymous and synonymous molecular branch
lengths for each pair were estimated via maximum likelihood, using the codon-based substitution model of Goldman and Yang [85,86]. Both the overall substitution rate
and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes
were allowed to take branch-specific values, and so estimating branch lengths for the complete tree risks overparameterisation. Furthermore, whole-tree estimation can
be unreliable if nuisance parameters, such as base composition, vary across groups. For these reasons, the data were
split into small groups of 3–8 related species, and branch
lengths estimated separately for these small subtrees. For
both nuclear and mitochondrial data sets, results reported
here are for concatenated multi-locus alignments. Analyses were also carried out for individual loci, and for a lineage-effect component of rate variation, estimated via the
method of Smith and Eyre-Walker [2,4], but as results did
not differ qualitatively from those obtained by the simpler
method of concatenating the sequences, they are not
reported further. In a few cases, one or more branches of
a subtree showed signs of saturation, but the relevant pairs
fit the same trends as the remainder of the data set, implying that signal was present in the sequence data, and so
they were not excluded from the analyses.

Full details of the comparison pairs, the molecular branch
lengths, and life history measurements are included in the
Data Supplement [Additional file 1].
Statistical tests
The independent comparisons were analysed with multiple regression, forcing all regression lines through the origin [34,35]. For results to be valid, it is important to meet
the assumptions of the parametric test, and this typically
involves transforming the trait measurements, and standardising comparisons to account for their different periods of divergence [33]. For this purpose, estimated
divergence dates were taken from [26]. (An advantage of
the use of sister pairs is that the dates were required solely
for this purpose, and have no effect on the estimated differences in log rates.) To assess the standardisations and
transformations used, we employed standard regression
diagnostics, and customised tests [35,36]. These methods
were extended to solve the special problems posed by substitution rate data [37]. The extended methods use patterns in the contrast variance to define a minimum depth
below which comparison pairs were excluded [see Additional file 2]. In this way, we hoped to prevent the strength
of any effect being masked by stochastic noise in the substitution process [1,4,18]. All statistical tests were implemented in R [87].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/53

estimated divergence dates. These plots were solely illustrative, but they allowed us to include taxa excluded from
the independent contrasts analysis, either because of missing life-history data for one member of the pair, or
because of the diagnostic tests.
