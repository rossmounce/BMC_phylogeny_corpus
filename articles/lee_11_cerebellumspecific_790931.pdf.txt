intact coding potential

Abstract
Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), including murine leukemia virus (MuLV) type-ERVs (MuLV-ERVs), are
presumed to occupy ~10% of the mouse genome. In this study, following the identification of a full-length MuLVERV by in silico survey of the C57BL/6J mouse genome, its distribution in different mouse strains and expression
characteristics were investigated.
Results: Application of a set of ERV mining protocols identified a MuLV-ERV locus with full coding potential on
chromosome 8 (named ERVmch8). It appears that ERVmch8 shares the same genomic locus with a replicationincompetent MuLV-ERV, called Emv2; however, it was not confirmed due to a lack of relevant annotation and
Emv2 sequence information. The ERVmch8 sequence was more prevalent in laboratory strains compared to wildderived strains. Among 16 different tissues of ~12 week-old female C57BL/6J mice, brain homogenate was the only
tissue with evident expression of ERVmch8. Further ERVmch8 expression analysis in six different brain compartments
and four peripheral neuronal tissues of C57BL/6J mice revealed no significant expression except for the cerebellum
in which the ERVmch8 locus’ low methylation status was unique compared to the other brain compartments. The
ERVmch8 locus was found to be surrounded by genes associated with neuronal development and/or inflammation.
Interestingly, cerebellum-specific ERVmch8 expression was age-dependent with almost no expression at 2 weeks and
a plateau at 6 weeks.
Conclusions: The ecotropic ERVmch8 locus on the C57BL/6J mouse genome was relatively undermethylated in the
cerebellum, and its expression was cerebellum-specific and age-dependent.

Background
The concept of “endogenous” retroviruses (ERVs), which
are inherited to subsequent generations by Mendelian
order, was introduced following the discovery of three
variants of ERVs in the genomes of laboratory mice and
domestic fowls: murine leukemia virus (MuLV), mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV), and avian leukosis
virus [1,2]. ERVs are a family of long-terminal repeat
(LTR) retrotransposons, and they occupy ~10% of the
mouse genome [3,4]. In conjunction with the ERV
population data accumulated from studies during the
last few decades, the current mouse genome database
renders an in-depth and systematic cataloguing of ERVs
and other transposable and/or repetitive elements [4,5].

Mouse ERVs are segregated into three different classes
(class I, II, III) based on the phylogenetic relatedness of
their reverse transcriptase codons [6]. Class I (e.g.,
MuLV-type ERVs [MuLV-ERVs]), class II (e.g., MMTVtype ERVs), and class III ERVs represent ~0.7%, ~3%,
and ~5.4% of the mouse genome, respectively.
Some studies have shed an initial light into the biological properties of mouse ERVs. Rowe et al. reported
that activation of recombinant MuLV-ERVs is linked to
the onset of thymic lymphomagenesis [7]. In addition, it
has been demonstrated that extended culturing of
embryonic cells derived from certain mouse strains,
such as AKR mice, resulted in the de novo production
and release of MuLV-type ERVs [8,9]. Recent studies
have suggested that the envelope gene products of ERVs
participate in various pathophysiologic processes, such
as placental morphogenesis in mice and demyelination

of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis patients [10,11].
Our laboratory reported that stress signals elicited from
injury and/or infection activate certain ERVs, and lipopolysaccharide treatment differentially induces the production and release of ERV virions from mouse primary
lymphocytes of various origins and at different developmental stages [12-14]. Furthermore, it was observed that
ERV expression patterns in mice are directly linked to
ERV-, cell-, and/or tissue-type [14,15].
In this study, using a combination of different ERV
mining protocols, a full-length MuLV-ERV locus with
an intact coding potential was identified from the
C57BL/6J mouse genome. The genomic distribution of
this ERV in different mouse strains and its expression
characteristics in various tissues, including different
brain compartments, were investigated.

Results
Identification of a full-length MuLV-ERV locus on
chromosome 8 of the C57BL/6J mouse genome

In our previous study, a stretch of 40 nucleotides at the
junction of the envelope gene and 3’ LTR of an

Page 2 of 10

unknown LTR retrotransposon was serendipitously
identified during a genome-wide mining of MuLV-ERVs
(Figure 1A) (unpublished). Using the 40 nucleotide
sequence as an in silico probe, a combination of search
programs, mainly NCBI BLASTN and BLASTP, was
used to mine new ERV loci in the C57BL/6J mouse genome. Putative ERV loci identified from this mining
experiment were subjected to an initial screening by an
open reading frame (ORF) analysis and alignment
against known ERVs. One putative full-length (8,728
nucleotides) MuLV-ERV was mapped on chromosome 8
(named “ERVmch8“), and it was determined to retain the
intact coding potential for all three retroviral polypeptides (gag [537 amino acids], pro-pol [1,196 amino
acids], and env [669 amino acids]) essential for virion
assembly and replication (Figure 1B, C). In addition,
there were two identical LTRs of 523 nucleotides, a
tRNAProline primer binding site, and an N-tropic motif
in p30 of the gag gene on the ERVmch8 locus [16]. Phylogenetic analyses using three reference MuLV-ERVs
(Emv1, MelRV, and NeRV), which share high sequence
similarities with ERVmch8, revealed that ERVmch8 retains

motif, coding sequences [gag, pro-pol, and env], and LTR structure) of ERVmch8 are indicated on the proviral line drawing. The chromosome 8
ideogram was adopted and modified from the NCBI mouse genome database.

one polymorphic cluster in the gag gene (Figure 2)
[17-19]. According to previous reports, it appears that
ERVmch8 shares the same genomic locus with another
MuLV-ERV, called Emv2; however, this was not successfully confirmed because of an absence of relevant annotation and sequence information in the NCBI databases
[20-22].

ERV mch8 . Interestingly, the evident expression of
ERV mch8 was detected only in the cerebellum (Figure
4C). This cerebellum-specific pattern probably explains
the variable expression levels of ERVmch8 in the brain
homogenates processed from the half brains of three
different mice, which may not represent the cerebellum
proportionally (Figure 4A).

Distribution of the ERVmch8 sequence in the genomes of
laboratory and wild-derived mouse strains

Age-dependent regulation of the expression of ERVmch8
in the cerebellum

To determine the distribution of the ERVmch8 sequence
in the genomes of laboratory and wild-derived mouse
strains, genomic DNA samples isolated from 57 different strains were subjected to PCR genotyping using a
primer set specific for the ERVmch8 sequence. The bands
of the expected size were amplified in the vast majority
of laboratory mouse strains, such as AKR/J and C3H/
HeJ; conversely, they were present in only a limited
number of wild-derived strains, such as MOLC/RkJ,
MOLD/RkJ, and MOLF/EiJ (Figure 3A). The ERVmch8
sequence was not amplified in the pahari/Ei and caroli/
EiJ strains, which are among the phylogenetically oldest
wild-derived strains. Interestingly, the size and intensity
of the bands, presumed to be amplified from the
ERVmch8 sequences, were slightly variable depending on
the mouse strain, suggesting polymorphisms in the
sequences and/or copy numbers. Forty-seven of the 57
mouse strains were then mapped on Petkov et al.’s phylogenetic tree, which was established based on the profile of a set of single nucleotide polymorphism markers
spanning the entire mouse genome, and is divided into
seven distinct groups (Figure 3B) [23]. Interestingly, 16
of the 19 mouse strains mapped in Group 7 did not
have evident amplification, whereas nine of the 11 in
Group 1 as well as seven of eight in Group 4 had the
expected bands (Figure 3).

In this study, we examined whether the cerebellum-specific expression of ERVmch8 is developmentally regulated
using six different brain compartments (cerebral cortex,
corpus callosum, brain stem, cerebellum, hippocampus,
and olfactory bulb) from eight different age groups of
female C57BL/6J mice, ranging from ~2 to ~29 weeksold. No substantial expression of ERVmch8 was noted in
the cerebellum until four weeks of age, and the expression plateaued at ~6 weeks of age (Figure 5). In contrast, there was no evident expression of ERVmch8 in the
other brain compartments in all age groups examined.
This finding suggests that the cerebellum-specific
expression of ERVmch8 is age-dependent and potentially
linked to the development of the cerebellum.

Brain-specific ERVmch8 expression

We then examined the expression pattern of ERVmch8 in
a set of 16 selected tissues from female C57BL/6J mice
(~12 weeks-old). No significant levels of expression
were observed in any tissues examined except for the
brain homogenates (Figure 4A). It needs to be noted
that the brain homogenates were prepared using half of
a brain from each animal. The findings from this experiment led us to speculate that the expression of the
ERVmch8 might be specific for certain compartment(s) of
the brain and other neuronal tissues. In addition to the
six discrete compartments of the brain (cerebral cortex,
corpus callosum, brain stem, cerebellum, hippocampus,
and olfactory bulb), cervical and lumbar spinal cords,
optic nerve, and trigeminal ganglia were separately collected from female C57BL/6J mice (~12 weeks-old) (Figure 4B) and were examined for the expression of

Protein coding sequences neighboring the ERVmch8 locus

The transcription regulatory elements residing on the
ERV sequences may participate in modulating the
expression of neighboring protein coding sequences
[24,25]. The genomic regions surrounding the ERVmch8
locus, 100 Kb upstream and 100 Kb downstream, were
surveyed for annotated protein coding sequences on
both strands. A total of eight protein coding sequences
were identified: Spire2 (actin organizer), Tcf25 (transcription factor 25), Mc1r (melanocortin-1 receptor),
Tubb3 (tubulin-b3), Def8 (differentially expressed in
FDCP 8), Afg3l1 (ATPase family gene 3-like 1), Dbndd1
(dysbindin domain containing 1), and Gas8 (growth
arrest specific 8) (Figure 6). Interestingly, the majority of
these protein coding sequences were characterized to be
associated with neuronal development and/or inflammation [26-31]. For example, Tubb3 and Spire2 are
involved in processes responsible for brain development,
while Mc1r plays a role in brain inflammation [32,33].
Further studies may confirm the possibility that
ERVmch8 participates in the transcriptional control of
some of these neighboring protein coding sequences.
Unique methylation profile of the ERVmch8 locus in the
cerebellum in comparison to the other brain
compartments

In this study, we attempted to determine whether the
cerebellum-specific expression of ERVmch8 is linked to
the methylation status of its cytosine residues. The

five other brain compartments (brain stem, cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb)
from ~12 week-old C57BL/6J mice. At numerous
nucleotide positions for both strands, a significantly

higher frequency of cytosine to thymine conversion was
observed in the cerebellum in comparison to the rest of
the brain compartments (Figure 7A). The cerebellum
also had a unique profile of no conversion of cytosines
in comparison to the other brain compartments. In the
cerebellum, the number of nucleotide positions with a
significant conversion frequency (red half-circle) was

the converted sequences isolated from the brain stem
were grouped into two small branches for each strand.
The findings from these experiments suggest that the
methylation profile of the ERVmch8 locus in the cerebellum is unique. Importantly, the number of unmethylated
cytosine residues in the cerebellum was significantly
higher compared to the rest of the brain compartments,
which may be closely linked to the cerebellum-specific
ERVmch8 expression.

substantially higher than the positions with a significant
no conversion frequency (blue half-circle): plus strand
(46 conversion positions vs. 23 no conversion positions)
and minus strand (75 conversion positions vs. 63 no
conversion positions). In addition, the average number
of converted cytosine residues, thus unmethylated, in
the ERV mch8 sequences isolated from the cerebellum
was significantly higher (P < 0.01) compared to the rest
of the brain compartments (Figure 7B). Furthermore,
phylogenetic evaluation of the differentially converted
ERVmch8 sequences was performed to compare the cytosine to thymine conversion profiles of the cerebellum
and the other brain compartments (Figure 7C). Interestingly, the converted sequences isolated from the cerebellum formed a distinct branch for each strand: one
branch had all seven plus strand sequences, and another
branch contained all 12 minus strand sequences. Also,

Discussion
Most characterized members of the C57BL/6J ERV
population exist as multiple copies in the genome. A
survey in this study identified only a single copy of an
ecotropic ERV (ERVmch8) in the C57BL/6J mouse genome, and it is not currently annotated in the NCBI
database (Build 37.1, as of November 12, 2010).
ERVmch8 (8,728 nucleotides) shares a greater than 98%
nucleotide sequence homology with the melanomaassociated retrovirus (MelARV), which was localized
on chromosome 7 of the B16 melanoma cell line
derived from the C57BL/6 mouse strain [18]. According to the results obtained from the env polypeptide
alignment against MelARV, it appears that ERV mch8
harbors an ecotropic tropism trait. Pothlichet et al.
reported that a single locus on chromosome 8-qE1 was
mapped using the MelARV env sequence as a query
and presumed that MelARV originated from the Emv2
locus, which is reported to be the only ecotropic ERV
found in normal C57BL/6 cells [17,34]. Contrary to
this report, the ERV mch8 locus, which has ~98%
nucleotide sequence homology with MelARV, was
mapped on the chromosome 8-qE1 junction, based on
survey results using NCBI BLAST. In addition, Emv2
is located/annotated at 67.0 cM, ~11.4 cM upstream of
the ERVmch8 locus (~78.4 cM), according to a survey
of the NCBI map viewer [21,35]http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/projects/mapview. Thus, it is probable that

Figure 7 Cerebellum-specific methylation pattern of the ERVmch8 locus. A. The cytosine methylation profile of ERVmch8 in the cerebellum
was compared to the methylation profile of an amalgamation of other brain compartments (cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, brain stem,
hippocampus, and olfactory bulb). In particular, significant difference in the frequency of cytosine to thymine conversion (red half-circle) or in the
frequency of no conversion (blue half-circle) in the cerebellum in comparison to the rest of the brain compartments is presented on both plus
and minus strands. Open half-circle indicates no significant difference in the conversion frequency. Gray box identifies CpG dinucleotides. Start
sites of U3 and R are indicated with an arrow. Plus strand cytosine residues of the ERVmch8 (minus strand of the chromosome orientation) are
indicated by upward circles and minus strand with downward circles. B. The average number of converted cytosine residues in the ERVmch8
sequences isolated from the cerebellum was compared to the other brain compartments; values are summarized in a table and presented as a
bar graph. N (number of sequences analyzed). C. Phylogenetic evaluation of the differentially converted ERVmch8 sequences was performed to
compare the cytosine to thymine conversion profiles of the cerebellum and the other brain compartments. The bar on the left side of the tree
represents the length of a nucleotide substitution per 100 residues.

ERVmch8, but not Emv2, is the probable progenitor of
MelARV, if any. Unexpectedly, we were unable to
retrieve the nucleotide sequence, which is presumed to
be the Emv2 provirus, from the Emv2 locus annotated
in the NCBI C57BL/6J mouse genome (Build 37.1, as
of November 12, 2010) and MGI (MGI_4.4 as of
November 19, 2010) databases. Further, we were
unsuccessful in locating the Emv2 proviral sequence,
either partial or full, using the keyword, “Emv2”, in the
NCBI Nucleotide database. However, it is still a possibility that ERVmch8 shares the same locus on chromosome 8-qE1 region with Emv2 with an assumption that

the NCBI annotation information regarding the Emv2
locus needs to be revised.
Analysis of the distribution of the ERVmch8 sequence
among various mouse strains demonstrated that a
majority of strains in Groups 1 and 4 of the phylogenetic tree, which was developed by Petkov et al., harbor
the proviral sequence in their genome. Within Group 1,
which consists of mostly laboratory strains, including
BALB/cJ and C3H, all except for the SF/CamEiJ and
CE/J strains had evident amplification of the ERV mch8
sequence. The C57L/J strain in Group 4, which also
contains the C57BL/6J strain, did not have the ERVmch8

Lee et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:82
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/82

sequence amplified, and this finding is consistent with
the description from the Jackson Laboratory that “C57L/
J mice carry no detectable endogenous ecotropic MuLV
DNA sequences”. On the contrary, there was no amplification of the ERVmch8 sequence in the vast majority (16
of 19) of Group 7, which is comprised of wild-derived
strains. Interestingly, a unique branch of three strains
(MOLC/RkJ, MOLD/RkJ, and MOLF/EiJ) in Group 7,
which had the ERV mch8 sequence amplified, were
derived by independent pairings of Mus musculus
molossinus mice originating from Fukuoka, Japan (JAX®
NOTES Issue 456 and JAX Mice Database, Jackson
Laboratory). The SPRET/EiJ mice, also from Group 7
and derived from wild mice caught in Puerto Real,
Spain (JAX Mice Database, Jackson Laboratory), had no
ERV mch8 sequence amplified. These findings suggest
that the ERVmch8 sequence is present in wild mice originating only from certain geographic regions.
The unique methylation profile, in particular, the high
number of converted cytosines in a segment of the
ERV mch8 sequence of the cerebellum (~12 week-old
mice) in comparison to the other brain compartments,
may explain, at least in part, the cerebellum-specific
expression of the ERVmch8 locus. Active transcription of
this full-length MuLV-ERV (ERV mch8 ), presumed to
retain the ecotropic tropism trait, from the age of five to
six weeks may lead to a series of potential short-term
and long-term events: 1) persistent expression of gag,
pol, and env polypeptides, and their potential contribution to the biology of the cerebellum, 2) assembly of
virus particles with ecotropic tropism followed by their
release, and 3) very low-level, if any, infection (due to
presumed to be poor replication-competency) of neighboring and/or distant cells expressing relevant receptor
(s) during the course of the relatively long lifespan of
brain cells [36].

Conclusions
The key finding of this study that ERVmch8 expression is
cerebellum-specific and age-dependent suggests that the
expression of ERV mch8 is linked to the biology of the
cerebellum. A set of further experiments is needed to
unveil the detailed mechanisms controlling the cerebellum-specific and age-dependent expression of ERVmch8.
In addition, a full investigation into the roles of ERVmch8
in the biology of the cerebellum and potentially other
tissues is warranted.

Committee of the University of California, Davis. Three
mice from each age group were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation or cervical dislocation followed by harvesting of
different sets of tissues depending on the age groups.
Certain brain samples were dissected further into their
separate compartments and all tissue samples were
snap-frozen.
Genotyping PCR

Genomic DNA samples from 57 different inbred mouse
strains (both laboratory and wild-derived) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
Maine). Genotyping PCR was performed using 100 ng

sequence using Taq polymerase from Qiagen (Valencia,
CA) and a set of primers; UM1: 5’-GAA GTT GAA
AAG TCC ATC ACT AA-3’ and UM3: 5’-TCT GGG
TCT CTT GAA ACT GT-3’.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from the tissue samples using
an RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (for brain tissues) or
RNeasy Mini Kit (for non-brain tissues) from Qiagen.
cDNAs were synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA
using a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
A region near the 3’-end of the ERVmch8 transcript was
amplified by PCR using the UM1 and UM3 primer set

~12 weeks-old mice using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). For the conversion of unmethylated cytosines to
uracils/thymines, 2 μg of genomic DNA from each sample was treated with bisulfite using a Methyl Detector
Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). PCR was performed
using Taq polymerase (Qiagen), 7.5 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA, and a set of primers; UM1 (see above) and

ERV mining, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic
analyses

The National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) BLASTN and BLASTP programs were alternately used for mining new ERVs from the C57BL/6J
mouse genome database with a 40 nucleotide probe,
which was serendipitously identified in our previous
study (unpublished). Alignment and phylogenetic analyses of the DNA, including the bisulfite-converted
DNA clones, and protein sequences were performed
using the MegAlign program from DNASTAR (Madison, WI).
Statistical analyses

The significance of differences in the C to T conversion
rate at individual cytosine residue positions (plus and
minus strands) was evaluated by Fisher’s Exact probability test. The differences in the number of converted
cytosine residues in the ERVmch8 sequence between the
cerebellum and the other five brain compartments were
evaluated by a Student’s t-test. P values of less than 0.05
were determined to be significant.
