Abstract
Background: HIV-1 infected patients for whom standard gp160 phenotypic tropism testing failed are currently
excluded from co-receptor antagonist treatment. To provide patients with maximal treatment options, massively
parallel sequencing of the envelope V3 domain, in combination with tropism prediction tools, was evaluated as an
alternative tropism determination strategy. Plasma samples from twelve HIV-1 infected individuals with failing
phenotyping results were available. The samples were submitted to massive parallel sequencing and to
confirmatory recombinant phenotyping using a fraction of the gp120 domain.
Results: A cut-off for sequence reads interpretation of 5 to10 times the sequencing error rate (0.2%) was
implemented. On average, each sample contained 7 different V3 haplotypes. V3 haplotypes were submitted to
tropism prediction algorithms, and 4/14 samples returned with presence of a dual/mixed (D/M) tropic virus,
respectively at 3%, 10%, 11%, and 95% of the viral quasispecies. V3 tropism prediction was confirmed by gp120
phenotyping, except for two out of 4 D/M predicted viruses (with 3 and 95%) which were phenotypically R5-tropic.
In the first case, the result was discordant due to the limit of detection for the phenotyping technology, while in
the latter case the prediction algorithms were not computing the viral tropism correctly.
Conclusions: Although only demonstrated on a limited set of samples, the potential of the combined use of
“deep sequencing + prediction algorithms” in cases where routine gp160 phenotype testing cannot be employed
was illustrated. While good concordance was observed between gp120 phenotyping and prediction of R5-tropic
virus, the results suggest that accurate prediction of X4-tropic virus would require further algorithm development.

Background
The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are the
main co-receptors for entry of HIV-1 into target cells
[1,2]. Maraviroc (Selzentry/Celsentri, Pfizer, NY) is a
chemokine co-receptor antagonist, designed to prevent
HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-cells by blocking the CCR5
co-receptor. Since the drug is only effective in individuals exclusively harboring CCR5-tropic (R5) virus, viral
tropism has to be determined before the initiation of
maraviroc treatment. Currently, the only clinically validated tropism test is the Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences, CA). It has recently been replaced by the

Enhanced Sensitivity Trofile Assay (ESTA), which
detects minority CXCR4-using (X4) viruses with higher
sensitivity in clinical specimens [3]. However, the use of
this type of phenotypic assays has several limitations:
(i) the need to perform these assays in a centralized lab;
(ii) the limited amplification success rate of gp120
(Virco tropism assay) or gp160 (Trofile assay) envelope
gene, and (iii) the relatively long turn-around times,
high cost, and requirement for large fresh specimen.
There is an ongoing search for alternatives [4-6], most
commonly relying on the amplification of the V3
domain of gp120, which is the major determinant for
viral tropism [7,8]. Prediction of co-receptor usage
based on V3 sequences using bioinformatics tools could
be a good alternative for phenotypic tropism testing in

routine clinical practice [9-11]. However, due to the lack
of sensitivity of standard sequencing methods, the use of
predictions based on population sequencing may be
misleading. Massively parallel sequencing technologies
allow sensitive, quantitative, and clonal analysis of
sequence variability. When combined with genotypic
prediction tools, they could become a sensitive alternative to phenotypic assays.

Results
Assay performance

The assay principle is based on parallel reverse transcription and amplification of seven viral RNA aliquots,
followed by pooling of the obtained amplicons which
are subsequently sequenced. In order to illustrate that
the approach of pooling replicates could reduce the
founder effect of the RT-PCR procedure, we sequenced
four samples with high viral load (>4 log 10 ) from

Page 2 of 6

unrelated clinical cases without amplicon pooling. Each
independent RT-PCR reaction was sequenced separately
and analyzed for quasispecies variability (Figure 1). To
exclude variability due to technical error and not to
viral genetic variability, we selected a cut-off of 1% (total
read number > 5,000) or 50 reads (less than 5,000 reads
in total), thereby discarding all variability at lower read
frequencies. Using these stringent criteria, it was
assumed that the observed haplotypes represent true
viral variants, and not sequencing errors. Analysis of the
data lead to several conclusions: i) the representation of
specific haplotypes varies considerably among the seven
replicates (Figure 1: see ranges of the boxes; e.g., range
for sample A-V3-H2 from 6 to 407 reads - details in
Figure 1 legend; range for sample D-V3-H1 from 141 to
719 reads; ii) on average, the 1% or 50-read limit retains
the top 90 ± 3% of reads; iii) expressing an haplotype
percentage is most probably more balanced if derived

q1: 65,5, median: 137, q3: 206,9, and max: 470; total number of reads: 1157.

from pooling approach; and iii) for a given sequence the
same tropism prediction was retrieved independent
from PCR conditions, but the quantity was found to be
variable from one experiment to the other.
In conclusion, the range of haplotypes reads per samples varied considerably dependent on the RT-PCR
experiment, and therefore the results demonstrate that
pooling of multiple parallel independent amplification
reactions reduces intra-assay variability. The average
result of seven pooled reactions provides a more reliable
quantification of each of the quasispecies. Therefore,
this 7× repeat protocol was used as standard protocol.
Tropism testing on clinical samples using deep
sequencing

A total of 14 clinical samples from 12 different HAART
failing individuals were available. Despite the clinical
need for alternative drug regimens, maraviroc was not a
treatment option because routine phenotypic tropism
testing failed, thereby excluding these patients from coreceptor antagonist based regimens.
HIV-1 V3 GS-FLX sequencing of the clinical samples
yielded an average of 12,698 ± 3,604 reads (range 3,370
to 19,626) per sample (Additional file 1: Overview
Results). Since the viral load ranged from 3.2 to 5.81
log 10 , and the experiments started with 256 μl of

Page 3 of 6

plasma, a theoretical maximum of 396 up to 161,414
individual viral RNA copies was included in the reactions. In the current experimental set-up, with an average of 12,698 ± 3,604 reads, an oversampling ratio of ~1
would be obtained in samples with an original viral load
of 4.7 log10. (or 50,000 cp/ml = 12,500 copies in 256 μl).
Taking these calculations into account, the oversampling
sizes in our experiments were ranging from 0.1 to 31.5.
These are obvious consequences of the sample original
viral load levels (Additional file 1: Overview Results).
The number of independent V3-loop haplotypes
detected in these isolates depended on the sequence
read number cut-off used (Additional file 1: Overview
Results). If the cut-off of 50 reads was applied, a 7 ± 3
haplotypes were detected on average, while a 1% read
cut-off reduced the average to 5 ± 3 haplotypes. Increasing the cut off can have a reducing effect on the number
of X4 haplotypes (sample 11 and 12, Additional file 1:
Overview Results). The number of haplotypes reaching
10% was on average 2, further reduced to 1 (exceptionally 2) haplotype above 25%.
Haplotype sequences from all patients were submitted
to PSSM tropism prediction tool (Additional file 1:
Overview Results, Figure 2). In samples 1 - 10 only R5tropic haplotypes were observed. X4-tropic haplotypes
were detected - with increasing prevalence - in samples

11 to 14. While in sample 11 and 12 the X4-tropic
viruses were divided over two haplotypes each individually accounting for less than 10% of the population, this
was not the case for sample 13 (one haplotype reached
10%), and also not for sample 14 for which all haplotypes (minor and major) were predicted to be X4-tropic
by PSSM.
All haplotypes were also analyzed by the G2P prediction tool. Identical prediction outcomes as for PSSM
were obtained for all, except for three X4-PSSM predicted minority haplotypes in sample 14 that were predicted to be R5-tropic in G2P, accounting in total for
4% of the population.
Tropism testing on clinical samples using VTA

In order to verify the genotypic tropism predictions, a
population tropism phenotyping test was performed on
each sample, using a smaller fragment (NH2-V4 region)
than the gp160 domain [12]. VTA was able to detect
the presence of X4 virus in 2/4 samples with predicted
X4 virus (D/M in Additional file 1: Overview Results).
The 2 discordant samples (sample 11 and 14; Additional
file 1: Overview Results) belonged to subtype C. Further
analysis of the X4-predicted data from the PSSM algorithm showed percentile values (= value between 0 and
1, and indicating whether the sample resembles similar
sequences in the training data-set) of more than 0.95,
indicating that they did not resemble an algorithmknown V3 sequence, and therefore the limited reliability
of the prediction might have been the explanation of the
discordant result.

Discussion
Samples might fail phenotypic tropism testing due to
difficulties in amplification of the large envelope gene
(sample degradation or low viremia), fitness problems or
low infectivity of the recombinant virus. Our results
demonstrate the potential use of massively parallel
sequencing in cases where routine phenotype testing
could not be employed. While the Trofile phenotyping
assay is currently the only diagnostic tool for enrollment
of patients in maraviroc-containing drug regimens, alternative ‘genotypic’ approaches should be considered and
validated in clinical settings. It needs to be stated that
other phenotyping approaches (e.g. shorter fragments
like gp120) might be able to provide results where the
Trofile assay fails, but these phenotyping technologies
are not the most attractive options for routine clinical
use because, in principle, they suffer from the same limitations (cost, turn-around time, centralized lab services).
On the other hand, second generation sequencing technologies are opening new diagnostic avenues, but there
are still some unresolved challenges associated to i) the
methods (sample shipment, extraction, amplification and

Page 4 of 6

pooling, sequence alignments and interpretations), ii)
the availability of the final product in a reproducible
and standardized way, and iii) the cost per sample.
Clinical isolates can harbour multiple or just one
major haplotype. In Figure 1, sample A and B show 4
haplotypes, each representing over 10% of the reads,
while other clinical samples have only one major haplotype (e.g., sample D-V3-H1 represents 64% of all reads).
The same observation was also illustrated in Additional
file 1: Overview Results, where a range of 1 to 4 major
haplotypes can be observed (cut-off dependent). Less
sensitive sequencing technologies (Sanger approaches)
are in general able to detect the major haplotypes, but
not the minor ones, nor the linkage with other mutations. In this study, 4 samples with predicted X4-tropic
haplotypes were found, an observation that would otherwise remain undetected. Using massively parallel
sequencing technologies, the minor variants as well as
haplotypes are detected and their relevance to the clinical aspects can be studied.
Using a standardized protocol in combination with a
variable viral load between the different samples results
unavoidably in under- or oversampling of the viral quasispecies pool. Despite this range in sample viral load,
the number of haplotypes is rather constant. For example: sample 12 has an oversampling size of 0.1, while the
amount of haplotypes with more than 50 reads was limited to 5, while sample 1 shows a high oversampling
rate (31.5) and 9 haplotypes were present. The current
analysis was based on V3 amino acid sequences, and not
on nucleotide variability in gp120. Phylogenetic analysis
of the gp120 nucleic acid variability could be used to
evaluate the quantity of resampling (identical nucleotide
sequences are most likely derived from the same founder virus). The present study, however, suggests that, at
the amino acid level, there is a limited quasispecies
variability for V3 and only a few haplotypes are relevant
at a certain time in the life cycle of the virus.
Viruses from 4/12 patients who were HAART failing
individuals were predicted as X4 tropic by V3 genotype
prediction, of which 2 were confirmed by VTA. Given
the treatment-experience and subsequent treatment failure, the number of patients harbouring CXCR4-using
viruses in this study was relatively low. In addition, 2/3
subtype C viruses in this study were predicted as X4
virus, which is also different from previous reports
where less X4 tropic virus was found in clade C. Based
on these observations, it is likely that the set of clinical
isolates is too limited to make strong conclusions on X4
prevalence in treatment failures or in clade C virus.
The discordant result between the phenotypic assay
and the prediction tool observed for sample 11 and 14
illustrates the limitations of the approach. The clinical
decision on the use of co-receptor antagonists is mainly

Vandenbroucke et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2010, 7:4
http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/7/1/4

driven on detecting the presence of X4-tropic virus,
therefore these discordances are hampering the usefulness of the prediction tools. With future availability of
correlative tropism genotype-phenotype databases
enriched with X4-tropic virus, it is anticipated that these
prediction technologies will become more accurate. For
the other 12 samples in this study, the prediction algorithms were in line with the gp120 phenotype.

Conclusions
It was shown that that massively parallel sequencing
technologies allow a sensitive and quantitative analysis
of V3 loop variability, and might represent an alternative
for phenotypic tropism assays when combined with
accurate prediction tools. However, since the application
was illustrated on only a small set of samples, the clinical utility of deep sequencing-V3 prediction described in
this manuscript requires further evaluation before using
this protocol for patient treatment decisions. If confirmed, this will be beneficial for patients for whom phenotypic tropism test results could not be obtained and
who were therefore unable to consider CCR5 antagonists as part of their antiretroviral drug regimen.

of barcode sequences to the primers allowed the simultaneous processing of amplicons originating from multiple individuals, enlarging the number of reads obtained
per sequencing experiment [13]. To maximize the number of input templates and to minimize variation due to
PCR drift, the RNA derived from 256 μl of plasma was
divided in 7 aliquots, and 7 parallel RT-PCR reactions
were performed [14,15]. Barcoded amplicons were
pooled equimolarly and sequenced on the GS-FLX
instrument according to the manufacturer’s amplicon
sequencing protocol (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT,
USA).
Tropism prediction

The V3 loop sequences were aligned using a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) and translated to amino acids
for tropism prediction using two different algorithms.
Viral tropism was predicted based on the V3 loop
sequence using the PSSM algorithm http://indra.mullins.
microbiol.washington.edu/webpssm/ and the geno2pheno prediction algorithm http://coreceptor.bioinf.mpiinf.mpg.de/index.php[16] with a false positive rate of 5%.
Sequence error characterization

Methods
Patients samples

In the context of a larger study evaluating new diagnostic procedures for tropism determination (Vandekerckhove L. et al., in preparation), a set of clinical
specimens from twelve HIV-1 infected individuals failing
HAART therapy and also failing in the Trofile assay
became available for massively parallel sequencing
(Additional file 1: Overview Results). Two follow-up
samples were available from two of the patients (samples 1 and 2 are related to the same patient, and 3 and
4 are related to another one), collected within a threemonth interval in absence of changes in treatment regimen. The samples belonged to seven different viral subtypes, determined in the protease-reverse transcriptase
region (B (n = 4), C (n = 3), G (n = 3), AE (n = 1), A1
(n = 1), A/AG (n = 1) and 19_cpx (n = 1)). Three viral
load (VL) groups (3 < VL <4 log10 (n = 5), 4 < VL < 5
log10 (n = 8) and VL > 5 log10 (n = 1)) were represented
in the cohort (Additional file 1: Overview Results).
For assay validation purposes, four unrelated plasma
samples with viral load > 4 log 10 were obtained from
the Virco R&D sample repository.
V3 loop massively parallel sequencing

Viral RNA was extracted from 256 μl of plasma (BioRobot MDx, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), reverse transcribed
to cDNA, and the V3 loop was amplified in a nested
PCR using barcoded primers (HXB2 positions: forward
primer 6986-7012, reverse primer 7520-7540). Addition

The frequency and distribution of errors introduced
during V3 amplification and GS-FLX sequencing was
assessed by analyzing data from amplicon sequencing of
2 plasmids in duplicate. All changes relative to the published sequence detected were considered to be technical artefacts. An amplicon (in duplicate) covering the
V3-region of HIV was created from plasmid pHXB2
[GenBank:K03455] and pYK-JRSCF [GenBank:
AY426126]. V3 amplicons were sequenced using the
Standard GS-FLX amplicon sequencing protocol. The
error rate was defined as the number of errors divided
by the total number of expected bases. Homopolymeric
regions were defined as regions containing repeats of
three or more identical bases and the flanking non-identical bases. Data were retrieved from the Amplicon Variant Analysis software (Roche) with an average coverage
of 20.000 reads per position. An overall error rate of
0.10% and 0.08% was obtained for pHXB2 and pYKJRCSF, respectively. In addition, the error rate was elevated in homopolymeric regions: 0.13% versus 0.07% in
non-homopolymeric regions. Of the observed errors,
deletions (~40%) and insertions (~33%) were the most
frequent error types, followed by substitutions (~26%).
These errors were not evenly distributed: homopolymeric regions contained more deletions than non-homopolymeric regions, while the latter contained more
insertions and substitutions. The maximum substitution
error rate per base position was 0.13%, transitions from
A to G were most common, but also T to C, G to C,
and C to G were frequently seen. A similarity was noted

Vandenbroucke et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2010, 7:4
http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/7/1/4

in frequency errors between duplicates, whereas differences between the two plasmids could be explained by
sequence context. It is safe to state that viral variability
can be reliably differentiated from procedural/experimental errors in a range of 5- to 10- fold higher. Therefore, mutations were accepted as real variants when
present at a frequency above 1% of the total number of
reads. In cases when the total number of reads was falling below 5,000, a fixed cut-off of 50 reads is used.
Phenotyping of the NH2-V4 region using the Virco
Tropism Assay (VTA)

Phenotyping was performed as described [12]. Briefly,
NH2-V4 gp120 amplicons were generated by one-step
RT-PCR using primers Env-6210F and Env-R3. NH2-V4
gp120 amplicons were purified, and cloned into
pHXB2D-ΔNH 2 -V4-eGFP by in vitro recombination
using the In-Fusion™ Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech-Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). Recombination mixes were transformed into MAX Efficiency®
Stbl2™ cells (Invitrogen), and recombinant plasmids
were purified and transfected into 293T cells using the
Amaxa nucleofection technology (Amaxa Biosystems,
Cologne, Germany). Transfected cells were cultured for
48 h after which recombinant virus stocks were harvested. 100 μl recombinant virus stock was added to
U87-CD4, U87-CD4-CXCR4 and U87-CD4-CCR5 cells.
After five days, infection was evaluated by eGFP expression analysis using an argon laser-scanning microscope.
