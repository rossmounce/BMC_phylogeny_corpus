<p>Interactions between microbial
Microbial community interactions communities are revealed using a network of lateral gene transfer events.</p>

Abstract
Background: Determining the habitat range for various microbes is not a simple, straightforward
matter, as habitats interlace, microbes move between habitats, and microbial communities change
over time. In this study, we explore an approach using the history of lateral gene transfer recorded
in microbial genomes to begin to answer two key questions: where have you been and who have
you been with?
Results: All currently sequenced microbial genomes were surveyed to identify pairs of taxa that
share a transposase that is likely to have been acquired through lateral gene transfer. A microbial
interaction network including almost 800 organisms was then derived from these connections.
Although the majority of the connections are between closely related organisms with the same or
overlapping habitat assignments, numerous examples were found of cross-habitat and crossphylum connections.
Conclusions: We present a large-scale study of the distributions of transposases across phylogeny
and habitat, and find a significant correlation between habitat and transposase connections. We
observed cases where phylogenetic boundaries are traversed, especially when organisms share
habitats; this suggests that the potential exists for genetic material to move laterally between
diverse groups via bridging connections. The results presented here also suggest that the complex
dynamics of microbial ecology may be traceable in the microbial genomes.

Background

Microbes dominate the planet, inhabiting a wide range of
environments, including many previously thought to be too
extreme or inhospitable for life. Identifying the habitat(s)
occupied by a particular microbial organism is not a straightforward task. Often the initial habitat assignment stems from
where the organism was first isolated, which may not be its
only, or even its preferred, habitat. This is an increasingly frequent occurrence as more microbial species are being identi-

fied from metagenomic samples such as soil [1]. Furthermore,
given the anthropocentric perspective of microbiology, it is
not surprising that many bacteria have been associated with
their location in the human body, even if this pathogenic
phase constitutes only one part of their life cycle. For example, highly versatile, opportunistic pathogens in the Pseudomonas family are found in a wide range of habitats (for
example, [2]), not only in humans or other hosts. Add to this
the wide dispersal of microbes by physical processes [3,4] and

the variation over time of the microbial community at one
location, and the task becomes ever more complex.
Here we explore a new approach to study the interaction
between microbes in various habitats based on the cohabitation history recorded in each microbe's genome. Rarely is one
species found alone in its local environment. Even in highly
specialized niches, such as acid mine drainage, the biofilms
present are populated by more than one species [5]. Studies
of other environments such as farm soil [1] and the termite
gut [6] suggest a diversity that is difficult to capture even with
large-scale metagenomic sequencing projects. This diversity
creates opportunities for an organism to interact with a multitude of closely or distantly related neighbors in numerous
ways, including possible lateral gene transfer (LGT) [7].
Since we cannot directly observe these interactions, we must
use sequence data as proxy. For this purpose, we chose transposases that transfer both within and between genomes via
paired insertion sequences (ISs) [8-10]. Transposases are
potentially transferred laterally more frequently than many
other genes, based on the low levels of divergence [11] compared to other genes. A further advantage of transposases
over other protein-coding genes is lower degree of selection
effects such as conservation, recombination [12], adaptive
radiation [13] or counter-selection [14]. All of these issues
make it difficult to track their movement between species and
to determine whether they are laterally transferred or not.
Transposase sequences, on the other hand, are under selective pressure to retain their ability to move between organisms, and tend to be removed from the genome if this ability
is lost. Thus, they are well suited to provide a recent historical
record of LGT events between microbes due to their mobility.

ure 1, for instance, we see that Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica share members of three transposase families;
IS1, IS3 and IS1400. We then connect these nodes by a single
edge, representing the shared transposases. In this fashion,
we gradually build the network and connect additional taxa.
Each of the steps involved in forming the network is detailed
below. Ultimately, the result is a large network of 774 taxa
from 13 bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal phyla (Table S1 in
Additional data file 1), connected by one or more transposase
families. Figure 2 is a collection of representatives of three
groups of organisms that have been extensively studied in
microbiology; the E. coli group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and various Bacillus strains. This figure is a subset of the full
network for the purpose of illustrating specific concepts in
this work.

Transposase genomic context and vertical inheritance
A transposase may be shared between two taxa as the result
of two distinct mechanisms: LGT and vertical inheritance.
Sometimes, both mechanisms are involved, as when recently
diverged species retain transposases that had been acquired
by a common ancestor through LGT. In this study, we focus
on transposase co-occurrences that most likely arose through
recent acquisition by LGT. In order to distinguish between cooccurrences resulting from these two processes, we compared
the genomic regions adjacent to the transposases within both
taxa. Conservation of those regions would be a clear indication that these transposases were inherited from a common
ancestor.

Illustration of concept

Transposases located within the same gene neighborhood
(see Materials and methods) accounted for 5,641 co-occurrences between 685 taxa, while those residing in differing
neighborhoods provided 5,159 co-occurrences involving 774
taxa. Transposase pairs with a conserved genomic context
also have a higher average amino acid sequence identity (95.2
± 5.5% versus 89.5 ± 6.3% for pairs in differing locations),
further supporting our premise that these co-occurrences
reflect recent divergence within a vertical lineage. Therefore,
only those pairs within different gene neighborhoods were
included in the microbial social network and analyzed further. This strategy minimizes, but cannot completely rule out,
the possibility of vertical inheritance in closely related taxa.
The observed non-conservation of the surrounding regions
could have resulted from various combinations of events,
including transposase relocation and/or loss in either or both
species. Furthermore, we tested and confirmed the efficiency
of the neighborhood approach in minimizing the effects of
vertical inheritance by collapsing strains belonging to the
same genus and habitat (see Materials and methods).

The complexities of transposase connections between taxa
are best visualized as a network. Figure 1 illustrates the basic
concepts of how this network was created. First, we represent
each taxa as a node (circles) in the network. Second, we color
the nodes corresponding to the habitat annotation. Finally,
we search for any shared transposases between taxa. In Fig-

The distributions of sequence identities of shared transposases in conserved and non-conserved neighborhoods are
also strikingly different (Figure 3). There is a sharp drop in
sequence identity for the conserved neighborhood set from
the 98-100% category to the remaining categories. This short

We analyzed the distribution of transposases among all
sequenced microbial genomes, focusing on shared transposases that were most likely acquired by LGT. From these
connections, we constructed a microbial interaction network
including nearly 800 organisms. Since LGT between two taxa
implies a shared habitat at the time of transfer, or alternatively the presence of a vector of transmission, these connections provide a means for evaluating current habitat
assignments. Furthermore, connections between distant taxa
were of particular interest, as they imply that the obstacles
limiting transfer of genetic material across large phylogenetic
distances can be overcome.

half-life of (most probably) clonal transposases suggests that
there is little or no selection for these sequences in the
genome. For the shared transposases in non-conserved
neighborhoods, high-identity transposases are less common.
This is generally consistent with the premise that these
shared transposases are not clonal; that is, they are drawn
from a population of transposases with a certain degree of
sequence variation.

We used two measures of phylogenetic distance; one based on
16S RNA calculated using PHYLIP [15], and one based on the
average amino acid identity (AAI) of a set of 31 marker genes
used for tree reconstruction [16]. The average protein identity
is more sensitive than 16S identity when comparing closely
related taxa [17]. The latter method is suitable for this study
since the metrics are directly comparable to transposase identity, and since there are many closely related taxa.

Transposase identity versus phylogenetic distance

Using the first measure, sequence identity is observed to
decrease with increasing phylogenic distance for low to
medium phylogenetic distances (<40). The correlation coefficient is weak, but negative (-0.067), and the average transposase identity is 89.5 ± 6.3%. For large phylogenetic
distances, such as that between the Bacteria and the Archaea
(>80) the average transposase identity is 89.7 ± 7.8%. Thus,
the negative correlation coefficient reflects the presence of
many very closely related taxa that share transposases with
high sequence identity, rather than a tendency for distant
taxa to have dissimilar transposases. As a control, we also

For genes transmitted by vertical inheritance, sequence identity decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between
organisms. Since genes acquired through lateral transfer do
not follow this pattern, we investigated how the level of
sequence identity of our selected shared transposases correlates with the phylogenic distance between their source taxa.
In the case of multiple shared transposases, we considered
the highest identity.

studied the correlation between phylogenetic distance and
transposase similarity for the transposases in conserved
neighborhoods and found a stronger correlation at -0.11. This
supports the notion that the transposases that are not in conserved neighborhoods are not primarily results of vertical
inheritance. This decoupling of phylogenic distance from
sequence identity again suggests that some, if not most, of the
shared transposases that were not found in conserved neighborhoods were acquired by lateral transfer.

Since the 31 marker genes are most likely not a result of lateral transfer, we can compare the average identity of our
transposases to the distribution of total AAI to indicate the
degree of transfer into the unconserved neighborhoods. The
average transposase identity in unconserved neighborhoods
is significantly (t-test, P < 10-3) higher than the AAI of the
marker genes (81.6 ± 15.7%), suggesting that it is reasonable
to assume that the majority of transposases are results of lateral transfer and not vertical inheritance.

Using the second measure, we find an even clearer case of a
stronger correlation between transposases in conserved
neighborhoods and phylogenic distance. The correlation
coefficient in non-conserved neighborhoods was 0.145 versus
0.385 in conserved neighborhoods (Figure 4). Additionally,
the average AAI between taxa with shared transposases in
conserved neighborhoods is higher at 93%, significantly (ttest, P < 10-3) higher than 82% in the non-conserved set. This
again suggests that by discarding connections where transposases are in conserved neighborhoods, we reduce the effect
of vertical transfer of transposases.

Shared transposases within shared habitats
Most of the taxa included in this study are associated with a
habitat. The four most common habitats in the Genomes
OnLine Database (GOLD) [18] are host, marine, soil, and
aquatic; combined they constitute 1,302 of the 1,858 habitat
assignments in the full Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)
database [19]. Most of the other habitats can be classified as
subtypes of these four super-habitats (Table S2 in Additional
data file 1). For instance, bacteria categorized as intestinal
flora would also fall within the host super-habitat. Microbes
found to be viable in multiple habitats can be assigned to
more than one super-habitat.

Comparison of transposase connection protein identity for pairs in conserved neighborhoods (blue) versus non-conserved neighborhoods (red). The
sharp drop-off in identity for pairs in conserved neighborhoods suggests a rapid loss of transposases, while the lower identity for pairs in non-conserved
neighborhoods suggests an acquisition of transposases from a diverse population of transposases.

Most taxa that share a transposase are found to also share a
habitat (Table S3a in Additional data file 1). In Figure 2 for
instance, item 1 is an example of an intra-habitat connection,
where E. coli strains within the same habitat share transposases. Specifically, 41% of all transposase connections
occur between organisms with identical habitat assignments,
significantly (P < 10-3) more than the 22% expected if we were
to randomly pick connections from the network. Likewise,
partially overlapping habitats account for 25% of the total,
also significantly (P < 10-3) more than the 19% expected from
random processes. Over-representation of both of these
groups suggests, perhaps not surprisingly, that a shared habitat facilitates lateral transfer of transposases between
microbes, and that microbes found in more than one habitat
have the opportunity to exchange with microbes in each of
those habitats. These patterns persist also when the transposase identity cutoff is increased to 90% (Table S3b in Additional data file 1).
While the picture is not completely clear, the transposase cooccurrence data suggest that taxa assigned to the host habitat

transfer transposase genes more often than do taxa assigned
to other habitats (1,552 connections versus the expected 921,
P < 10-3). Several factors likely contribute to this. First, for
many pathogens and symbionts, the host habitat is not their
only habitat. They can also live outside their hosts in a secondary environment where they have the opportunity to
interact with the members of a different microbial community. For instance, green algae in the Great Lakes have been
found to harbor several enterobacterial pathogens [20] that
may at some point again return to the host environment. This
alternation between host and external environment could
have occurred repeatedly, thus providing repeated opportunities for transposase transfer to/from different organisms
within these bacterial lineages. Second, some bacteria have
been shown to regulate the rate of transposition in response
to stress, increasing the frequency when the genomic alterations resulting from transposition may prove advantageous
[21]. Thus, it may be that pathogens, with their perennial
need to adapt to host defenses and antibiotics, employ more
frequent IS and transposase exchange.

Cross-habitat connections

Host-aquatic connections

Of particular interest, 35% of the transposase co-occurrences
are found in taxa that are not known to share any habitats.
These connections that bridge between different habitats are
discussed in the following sections. In some cases, the specific
transposases are reported. For other cases, an extensive list of
transposase connections is provided in Additional data file 2.
In Figure 2, item 2 signifies a cross-habitat connection
between Bacillus cereus (soil) and E. coli (host), and Bacillus
thuringiensis (host, soil) with B. cereus (soil).

We find 97 instances where transposases are shared between
organisms assigned to the host and aquatic habitats. Just as
the host-soil connections discussed above are dominated by
Burkholderia species, host-aquatic connections are dominated by 6 Vibrio cholera strains annotated as aquatic. These
strains connect with E. coli strains (IS5 and others), the Wolbachia endosymbiont (IS4), and the Firmicute Staphylococcus aureus (IS5). Three of them connect to Providencia
stuartii (IS605), suggesting a recent transfer, either when or
shortly after those V. cholera strains diverged. Although V.
cholera is annotated as aquatic, none of the strains were
found to share transposases with any other aquatic species.
Since it is a known pathogen ([29] and references therein)
and the causative agent of cholera, infection of a human host
could provide the opportunity to interact with host species
such as E. coli. The connection to Wolbachia is especially
interesting, as Drosophila is a host for V. cholera infection
[30] as well as for the Wolbachia endosymbiont. Hence, as
with B. pseudomallei previously, our observations indicate
that V. cholera should be assigned to the host habitat, as well
as to aquatic.

Soil-aquatic connections
We observed 27 instances where transposase connections
link a microbe annotated as soil with one annotated as
aquatic. In at least some cases, these observations suggest
that the current annotations are incomplete. For example,
despite their differing annotations, Acidovorax (soil) and
Bordetella (aquatic) strains have been observed together in
arctic soil [22]. We also found connections (specifically IS4
transposases) between Bordetella (aquatic) and Pseudomonas (typically soil and/or host) strains with non-overlapping annotated habitats, but both Bordetella and
Pseudomonas strains have been observed in community
shifts within a bioreactor processing industrial wastewater
[23]. We note that the aquatic and soil habitats have many
opportunities to overlap as rainwater moves through land on
its way to the oceans (for example, in agricultural runoff,
floodplains).

Host-soil connections
There are 414 co-occurrences connecting microbes assigned
to host with those assigned to soil. Of these, 70 connections
are between Burkholderia species and thus may simply be
cases of vertical transmission followed by rearrangements
and/or deletions. Those species annotated as host include
Burkholderia enocepacia, Burkholderia cepacia, and Burkholderia mallei, those as soil are primarily Burkholderia
pseudomallei strains. Although B. pseudomallei is observed
in rice paddies [24], we suggest that it should also be classified as host since it has been linked to diseases such as melioidosis in humans. Further support for such a host habitat
assignment comes from its observed connections to other
pathogens outside the Burkholderia family (for example,
Shigella dysenteriae, via ISSfl2, ISSfl4 and other transposases), connections that are more difficult to dismiss as
vertical inheritance. We also see transposases shared between
more distant taxa that are not known pathogens. E. coli
strains share transposases (COG3547) with Burkholderia
thailandensis and Burkholderia vietnamiensis, Ralstonia
solanacearum, and the even more distant B. cereus. With the
exception of strain O157:H7, the E. coli strains are non-pathogenic; the other four also are not known pathogens, although
some of their close relatives are [25-27]. While it is unlikely
that these microbes come into regular contact with each other
within hosts, it is plausible that they may interact outside of
hosts, for instance in agricultural manure [28] or waste water.

Host-marine connections
Transposases are shared between host and marine species in
159 cases. Since fecal contamination of marine environments
is known to occur [31,32], it is not surprising to see connections involving host organisms such as E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Yersinia pestis. However, the host organisms
also include symbionts that reside in plant root nodules, such
as Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium species. Interestingly, the
soil species Sinorhizobium medicae and Sinorhizobium
meliloti also connect to marine species, although not to the
same targets as Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium.

Soil-marine connections
There are 48 co-occurrences between soil and marine organisms. The pattern here is similar to that observed for hostmarine connections in that they both involve organisms
related to soil and agriculture. The organisms annotated as
soil include the nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium and
Bradyrhizobium, both of which are found in plant root nodules, thus suggesting that they, like Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium, should be assigned to host. Also annotated as
soil is Paracoccus denitrificans, a nitrogen-oxidizing bacterium often found in soil sludge.

Aquatic-marine connections
The majority of the 152 connections between marine and
aquatic organisms are found to occur between aquatic V.
cholera and marine Shewanella or between the Photobacterium and Vibrio genera within the Vibrionaceae family. It is
difficult to draw a clear line of demarcation between these
two, often contiguous habitats that are distinguished by their
salinity, temperature and nutrients. V. cholera strains, for
instance, can be found in coastal regions [33] that form an

indistinct interface between aquatic and marine. This situation may be reflected in the number of closely related groups
whose annotations span the aquatic and marine environments, such as the Vibrionaceae, the Cyanothece, and the
Rhodobacteraceae (Roseobacter and Dinoroseobacter).

not surprising since the sequenced genomes available are
heavily biased toward that group.
There is a tendency for these connecting taxa to share the
same or similar environments. For example, the actinobacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, annotated as host, connects to 15 Proteobacteria, 14 of which are found in host or
host-related environments. Likewise, cross-connections
between Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are seen mostly
between host species. For instance, Proteobacteria link to the
following Firmicutes, all of which are annotated as host:
Clostridium bolteae ATCC BAA-613, Clostridium ramosum
DSM 1402, Clostridium scindens ATCC 35704, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325, and Streptococcus
strains. An intriguing exception involves the soil Firmicute B.
cereus ATCC 10987, which not only connects to enterobacterial species, most of which are annotated as host, but also to
Beggiatoa sp. and Desulfotalea psychrophila, both of which
are annotated as marine. It is not clear, however, if any environment promotes cross-phylum connections more than any
other, due to the bias towards sequencing organisms from
certain environments such as host.

Organisms annotated as viable in several habitats are likely to
be versatile enough to adapt to changing conditions as well as
diverse environments, thus having the opportunity to interact
with more different microbial communities. To test this supposition, we analyzed the transposase connections of all the
organisms in our network that are annotated as aquatic-hostsoil. These organisms belong to only ten genera: Chromobacterium, Citrobacter, Clostridium, Klebsiella, Mycobacterium,
Novosphingobium,
Pseudomonas,
Ralstonia,
Salmonella, and Yersinia. Collectively, they have 908 connections to organisms outside this group. Of these 908, 772
involve enterobacterial species (Klebsiella, Salmonella, Yersinia) and, with few exceptions, connect to host organisms.
Thus, despite their generalist annotation, most of them are
not found to interact often with organisms outside the host
habitat. There are exceptions, including the pathogen Ralstonia pickettii with diverse connections that range from the soil
bacterium Arthrobacter aurescens to the host and soil Burkholderia species and even to a eukaryote pathogen, Plasmodium yoelii. Similarly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa shares
transposases with a variety of soil and host bacteria, and also
one marine bacterium (Photobacterium sp. SKA34). Nevertheless, it appears that a generalist annotation does not, in
itself, imply a wide range of interactions.

One example of a cross-phylum connection not involving a
Proteobacterium is provided by Fusobacterium nucleatum,
which connects to the Firmicutes Clostridium perfringens
and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. All three share the host
habitat, and C. perfringens is also noted as soil. Other examples can be found within the Cyanobacteria, where Synechococcus sp. WH 7805 (marine) connects to several Shewanella
species (marine) and to Vibrio species (aquatic).

Cross-phylum connections

Bridging connections

Transposases tend to be constrained to specific phylogenetic
groups (Table S4a,b in Additional data file 1). Indeed, 91% of
the shared transposases observed in this study are shared
between members of the same phylum. This may reflect a
lower frequency of cross-phylum transfers due to the obstacles posed by increasingly divergent genome arrangements,
DNA polymerases, or genomic nucleotide bias. Furthermore,
since we included only the reciprocal best hits with at least
80% identity, it is likely that we have selected for more recent
transfers. The ISFinder resource [34,35] contains detailed
information about the distribution of various IS families,
including those with lower levels of identity. It is likely that
this resource will reveal transposase connections that are
below our detection levels, extending the network. In Figure
2, we observe a cross-phylum connection at item 3 between B.
cereus and E. coli, and also to P. aeruginosa.

In characterizing our microbial social network, we also identified those taxa that do not share a transposase but that are
connected via a third 'bridge' taxon. For example, suppose
that taxa A and C have no transposases in common, but A
shares a transposase with B and C shares a different transposase with B. Taxon B is thus the bridge connecting taxa A
and C. From this we infer that B has shared a habitat with A
at some time in the past, and likewise with C. Furthermore, as
a result of this bridge, there exists a possibility of gene flow
between A and C via B. Item 4 in Figure 2 shows E. coli B171
as a bridge between B. cereus ATCC 10987 and P. aeruginosa
2192.

In our study of high-identity transposases, we observe 448
co-occurrences between members of different phyla. Of these,
441 involve connections linking Proteobacteria with Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, or the eukaryote Apicomplexa. This prevalence of proteobacterial connections is

We tallied the number of two-paths for which each taxon
serves as the bridge between two taxa that are not directly
connected. The 30 species with the highest scores are ranked
(Table S5 in Additional data file 1). The top three are the soil
bacterium B. cereus, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae
SP19-BS75 (host) and B. vietnamiensis G4 (soil). The first
marine and aquatic species are ranked 11th and 12th, respectively. There is no apparent correlation between the number
of bridging connections and the number of habitat annotations a species may have. The highest ranking generalist

(annotated as soil, aquatic and host) is P. aeruginosa PA7 at
position 22.
The microbes that have the greatest impact on the social network are not necessarily those with the highest number of
connections, either direct or bridging. Bacteria such as Shigella, Escherichia, and Salmonella have many connections,
but most of them are within the Enterobacteriaceae and thus
do little to expand the network. More significant are those
that bridge between different groups or families, such as
Streptococcus and Staphylococcus that bridge between the
Firmicutes and the large clusters of Proteobacteria within the
host habitat.

Discussion

Some instances of the multiplicity of microbial interactions,
either between or within habitats, have been observed
directly, but, to the best of our knowledge, our network of
shared transposases is the first large-scale attempt to use
genomic records to infer genetic interactions shared between
organisms. By identifying pairs of taxa that share a transposase that was likely acquired by LGT, we generated a microbial interaction network including almost 800 organisms.
The results suggest a tendency to transmit transposases and
their associated ISs most frequently to other organisms
within the same habitat.
The primary source of potential error in our analyses stems
from including transposase pairs that were acquired by vertical inheritance, most likely in closely related taxa. However,
this source of error was reduced by excluding transposase
pairs that resided in conserved genomic neighborhoods. Furthermore, the analysis identified many connections between
distantly related taxa that have no recent common ancestor.
The results are inevitably biased due to the limited number of
sequenced microbial genomes and their skewed selection.
Since we are far from having genome sequences representative of the complete tree of life, it is likely that many interesting organisms and habitat types are missing from this study.
Some of these organisms may serve as vectors of transmission
between those studied in this work. With an increasing rate of
sequencing, many of these gaps will no doubt be resolved.
In addition to the connections between taxa with shared habitats, we also observe connections between taxa found in
physically different environments. These observations are
consistent with findings from microbial ecology and suggest
that there is a degree of mixing of microbes between environments, although probably not to the extent that 'everything is
everywhere' [36], since transposases are most often shared
within their environment. In some cases, this microbial relocation can be attributed to well-documented mechanisms (for
example, the lifecycle of V. cholera, the movement of agricultural drainage water). Other, less obvious instances merit further investigation.

Hooper et al. R45.9

These data suggest that a number of microbes annotated as
host should be re-annotated to reflect their cyclical movement between, and adaptation to, a host and an external environment. For that purpose we suggest a new category: hostexternal cycle - for example, host-soil cycle for pathogens who
spend parts of their natural life cycle in a soil environment.
Numerous examples of this can be found among the host-soil
cross-connections, including the enterobacterial pathogens
that cycle between animal intestines and soil. Likewise, V.
cholera exemplifies this cycling between host and marine
environments. Adoption of this new habitat category would
not only acknowledge that many pathogens periodically
change environments, but would also distinguish between
obligate and non-obligate pathogens and parasites. (Since
very few shared transposase connections were found among
obligate pathogens, this group is largely absent from the network observed in this study.)
Distantly related taxa with shared transposases tend to have
similar habitat annotations. Notably, all connections over
very great phylogenetic distances, such as between the Proteobacteria and the Apicomplexa, involve pathogens or parasites. This suggests that frequent and/or intimate cohabitation may be necessary to facilitate transmissions that
are less likely given the large differences in the genomic structure, nucleotide bias, regulatory mechanisms, DNA polymerases, and so on, between the two organisms.

Conclusions

This analysis of the transposase LGT history recorded in
microbial genomes expands our vision of the microbial world
in several ways. First, we see that current habitat annotations
can be too restrictive and thus fail to represent the full extent
of a microbe's habitat, and we also suggest refinements to the
pathogens in particular. Second, we see that microbes who
naturally traverse different habitats, such as many of the
pathogens, also share transposases with microbes from the
various environments. Therefore, it is likely that they may
also import other DNA, including protein-coding genes, from
its secondary environment. Third, it suggests that the impact
of LGT could be more far-reaching than previously thought,
since gene acquisitions are not limited to the immediate
vicinity, but can be drawn from different environments.
Fourth, this is a tentative survey into a molecular basis for
microbial ecology, an area that has not received much attention so far and that hopefully will expand in the future with
more sequenced genomes and metagenomes.

Materials and methods
Identifying transposase co-occurrences
The IMG database [19] is the most comprehensive database of
microbial genomes, with over 800 finished and draft
genomes as of this writing. For this study, we used BLAST
[37] to compare all genomes against each other and to iden-

tify cases where both BLAST reciprocal best amino acid hits
belonged to one of the 26 clusters of orthologous genes
(COGs) [38] annotated as transposases. The use of reciprocal
best hits ensures that we select the most similar transposases
between each pair of taxa, which is useful given the mobility
of these sequences. The threshold for sequence identity was
set at 80%. Frequently, there are more than one transposase
connecting two taxa. In this case, we retain the transposase
with the highest identity, which would suggest the most
recent transposition. Furthermore, to avoid selecting fragments or short, local alignments, we set a bit score [37] cutoff
at 80. This corresponds to an e-value of <10-20 given a database size of over 4 million sequences in IMG. An extensive list
of all transposase connections, along with details of individual transposase connections and their e-values are provided
in Additional data file 2.
Of particular interest are connections that bridge between
distant taxa or distinct habitats. For example, suppose that
transposase T1 occurs frequently in bacterial group A,
whereas transposase T2 is found in a distant bacterial group,
group B. If one organism in group B also contains transposase
T1, it could serve as a bridge to indirectly connect the other
members of group B with group A. In graph theory, this is
known as a two-path, where two nodes (in this case, two taxa)
are not connected directly, but only via a third node (taxon).
Two-paths are easily found using adjacency matrices. In the
adjacency matrix A, Aij = 1 when there is a direct connection
between nodes ni and nj. If we set the second Markov transition step X = AA', then Xij = 0 and Aij > 0 when ni and nj are
connected exclusively by a two-path.

Interaction graphs
The complex network of transposase co-occurrences can be
represented as a graph of nodes and edges, where taxa are
represented as nodes and shared transposases are represented as connecting edges. From the BLAST reciprocal best
hits, we created a co-occurrence graph with N = 774 nodes
and E = 5,159 edges, as well as analogous graphs for subsets
selected by habitat. To compare the appearance of transposase networks with networks of genes that are presumed to
be much less mobile, we created networks of genes associated
with transcription (category K) and three COGs from other
less conserved functions (categories P, E and R, associated
with transport and general predictions). We found that genes
coding for essential functions, such as polymerases, formed
very compact networks, where almost every taxa is connected
to each other. Conversely, less conserved genes (in this case
ion transport) rarely find connections outside their host at a
threshold of 80% identity. If they do, it is very often to a
closely related organism. The tranposase network can span
large phylogenetic distances, although miss connections with
much more closely related organisms, setting it apart from
networks of polymerases and less conserved genes.

Graph data in the Medusa [39] format are provided as Additional data file 3 for visualization of the transposase network.
The network is also provided in raw text format as Additional
data file 4. Information and references for all isolate genomes
used in this study can be found at IMG [40].

Gene neighborhoods and phylogenetic distance
Gene neighborhoods were defined as a stretch of protein coding sequences with intergenic distances less than or equal to
300 bp. When two transposases in two taxa were found in the
equivalent neighborhoods, we assumed a high likelihood of
vertical inheritance, and the transposase connection was
removed from this study. Details of the methodology used to
determine gene neighborhoods are available at the IMG website [40].
We used the program DNADIST in the PHYLIP package using
the Kimura substitution model on the 16S RNA sequence
alignment. The alignment is the subset of sequences from the
database SILVA [41] corresponding to the genomes in our
study. The AAI for the 31 marker genes [16] were calculated
analogously to the transposase identity above.

Effects of closely related taxa
Since the corpus of sequenced genomes is biased towards certain genuses, it is conceivable that this bias is also reflected in
the transposase connection study. For instance, we have multiple strains of E. coli, S. enterica, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae and several others. When several members of a genus all
share the same habitat, then the presence of inherited transposases may skew the habitat cross-connection towards
same-habitat connections. Although the problem of inherited
transposases has been addressed by removing connections
between transposases in conserved neighborhoods, an additional control is to remove superfluous closely related organisms from the network and study the habitat connections. For
this purpose, we collapsed genomes within the same genus
and habitat (for instance E. coli K12 and O157:H7) into a representative node and recalculated the connection scores. We
found that the patterns of connections (Table S6 in Additional
data file 1) were largely consistent with the case where
genomes are not collapsed by genus (Table S3a in Additional
data file 1). As before, within-habitats are overrepresented
(observed, 552; expected, 329; P < 10-3). This suggests that
transposases more often spread within a habitat than
between habitats regardless of sequencing biases, and also
supports the removal of connections between transposases in
conserved neighborhoods as an efficient method of reducing
effects of vertical transposase inheritance.
