Abstract
In the present study, a genotype 4 HEV strain was identified in the fecal specimen from a seven
months old infant with no symptom of hepatitis in Shanghai Children's hospital. The full capsid
protein gene (ORF2) sequence of this strain was determined by RT-PCR method. Sequence analysis
based on the full ORF2 sequence indicated that this HEV strain shared the highest sequence identity
(97.6%) with another human HEV strain isolated from a Japanese patient who was infected by
genotype 4 HEV during traveling in Shanghai. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this genotype 4
HEV was phylogenetically far from the genotype 4 HEV strain that was commonly prevalent in
Shanghai swine group, suggesting that this strain may not come from swine group and not involved
in zoonotic transmission in this area.

Findings
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a member of the genus Hepevirus, is a non-enveloped virus with a positive-stranded
RNA genome approximately 7.2 kb in length [1]. It is a
major cause of acute epidemic and sporadic viral hepatitis
in several developing countries. The infection is believed
to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route, usually through
contaminated drinking water. HEV isolates were divided
into four distinct genotypes according to sequence and
phylogenetic analyses. Genotype 1 was previously
believed to only infect humans, but reportedly detected
from a pig in Cambodia recently [2]. Genotype 2 has only

been identified in humans in Mexico and Africa (Nigeria,
Chad). Genotype 3 is prevalent in swine herds and
humans all over the world. Genotype 4 HEV was first
detected in humans in 1993 [3] and is mainly distributed
in China, Japan, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Genotype
4 HEV has a wide host range, being prevalent in humans,
swine, and some other animals. These four types of virus
are thought to comprise a single serotype [4]. Hepatitis E
was first recognized in China after a large epidemic in the
south part of Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region [5].
Since 2000, genotype 4 HEV has become the dominant
cause of hepatitis E disease in China [6].

Hepatitis E is usually self-limiting and its clinical illness is
usually mild, though fulminant hepatic failure occurs in
some cases. The disease is characterized by a high attack
rate among young adults and particularly severe illness
among pregnant women [5]. To our knowledge, no report
so far indicates that infants have been infected by HEV in
China and this is the first report that HEV infected the
infant that was younger than one year old.
From Feb to Aug, 2008, 236 fecal samples were collected
from 236 infants younger than 2 year old in Shanghai
Children's Hospital, these infants were sent to the hospital because they had abnormal feces appearance for several days. All the samples were converted to 10% (w/v)
suspensions in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.2–7.4) immediately
following the sampling. Total RNA was extracted from
100 ul suspension of each sample by using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The viral RNA was finally dissolved in 20
μl RNase-free water. The primers used for HEV sequence
amplification in this study were those previously
described in reference [7]. The PCR products were analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel. The expected DNA band specific for the HEV was excised from the gel, purified with
the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction kit (Axygen, USA) and
cloned into pMD T-Vector (TaKaRa, Japan). Both strands
of the inserted DNA amplicons were sequenced in a DNA
analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer; Invitrogen, USA). Standard precautions were used for all procedures to reduce the possibility of sample contamination
and RNA degradation.
The detection results indicated one specimen from a seven
months old infant was positive for HEV RNA. Sequence
analysis based on the partial ORF2 sequence suggested
that this HEV strain belonged to genotype 4. Then we
determined the full-length nucleotide sequence of ORF2
of this strain using 3 sets of nested primers designed
according the Chinese genotype 4 HEV isolates:
EU366959, EF570133, and AB197674. The full ORF2
sequence was submitted to GenBank with the accession
no.: FJ373295, and named Sh-hu-et1. The ORF2 of this
isolate contain 2025 nt, and encodes a potential 674 aa
polypeptide.
In order to investigate the evolutionary relationship of the
HEV isolate in this study with other Chinese genotype 4
isolates, sequences were aligned using ClustaX v1.8 or
MegAlign program in the DNASTAR software package.
Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Mega 4 software http://www.megasoftware.net/. Ten Chinese genotype 4 HEV strains with complete genome available in
GenBank (including both swine and human original isolates) were used as references in the analysis; their GenBank accession numbers and source of origin are showed

in Fig. 1. Sequence analysis (Fig. 2) based on full OFR2
sequences indicated the isolate in the present study shared
87.2–97.6% identities with the other Chinese genotype 4
HEV isolates referenced here, and the highest sequence
identity (97.6%) with another Shanghai HEV strain
(AB197674) isolated from a Japanese patient who was
reportedly infected during traveling in Shanghai of China
[8]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolate determined in this study closely clustered with other 3 Chinese
genotype 4 HEV strains from human (Fig. 1), forming a
subgroup. Interestingly, though the 4 HEV strains in this
subgroup come from three geologically far regions:
Shanghai (eastern China), Xi'an (western China) and
Guangxing (southern China), they shared more than 90%
nucleotide homologue with each other, suggesting they
may come from a common ancestor isolate. Recent
reports suggested that genotype 4 HEV isolates that prevalent in Shanghai humans showed phylogenetically close
relationship with those swine genotype 4 HEV isolates
commonly prevalent in Shanghai swine populations
[9,10], suggesting that zoonotic transmission of genotype
4 HEV between human and swine populations was
involved in this area. However, the isolate, Sh-hu-et1, in
the current study and the other two previous Shanghai
human isolates (AB197674, and AB369688) were phylogenetically far from the swine genotype 4 HEV isolate
(EF570133) (Fig. 1) which was reported to be commonly
prevalent in Shanghai swine groups [11], suggesting that
some HEV strains that prevalent in Shanghai humans may
not come from swine and didn't participate in zoonotic
transmission. Further investigating research in swine
groups should be aimed to determined the whether this
genotype 4 HEV strain is prevalent in Shanghai swine or
not.
HEV paly an important role in acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis in Asia and Africa. Although HEV
infection is frequent in young adults aged 15–20 years, it
is uncommon in children and usually asymptomatic and
anicteric [12]. Many reports indicated that anti-HEV IgG
could be detected in serum of children [13], but few cases
showed HEV RNA positive. In the present study, we
detected HEV RNA in the fecal sample from a seven
months old infant and this infant showed no clinical
symptom of hepatitis, which suggested that infants may
be sub-clinically infected by HEV.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our study showed that a genotype 4 HEV
strain infected a seven months old infant with no symptom of hepatitis in Shanghai Children's hospital.
Sequence analysis based on the full ORF2 sequence indicated that this HEV strain shared the highest sequence
identity with another human HEV strain isolated from a
Japanese patient who was infected by genotype 4 HEV

showed that this genotype 4 HEV was phylogenetically far
from the genotype 4 HEV strain that was commonly prevalent in Shanghai swine group, suggesting that this strain
