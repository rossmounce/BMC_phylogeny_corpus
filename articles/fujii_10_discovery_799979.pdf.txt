Discovery of global genomic re-organization
based on comparison of two newly sequenced
rice mitochondrial genomes with cytoplasmic
male sterility-related genes

Abstract
Background: Plant mitochondrial genomes are known for their complexity, and there is abundant evidence
demonstrating that this organelle is important for plant sexual reproduction. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a
phenomenon caused by incompatibility between the nucleus and mitochondria that has been discovered in
various plant species. As the exact sequence of steps leading to CMS has not yet been revealed, efforts should be
made to elucidate the factors underlying the mechanism of this important trait for crop breeding.
Results: Two CMS mitochondrial genomes, LD-CMS, derived from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica (434,735 bp), and
CW-CMS, derived from Oryza rufipogon Griff. (559,045 bp), were newly sequenced in this study. Compared to the
previously sequenced Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) mitochondrial genome, the presence of 54 out of
56 protein-encoding genes (including pseudo-genes), 22 tRNA genes (including pseudo-tRNAs), and three rRNA
genes was conserved. Two other genes were not present in the CW-CMS mitochondrial genome, and one of them
was present as part of the newly identified chimeric ORF, CW-orf307. At least 12 genomic recombination events
were predicted between the LD-CMS mitochondrial genome and Nipponbare, and 15 between the CW-CMS
genome and Nipponbare, and novel genetic structures were formed by these genomic rearrangements in the two
CMS lines. At least one of the genomic rearrangements was completely unique to each CMS line and not present
in 69 rice cultivars or 9 accessions of O. rufipogon.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate novel mitochondrial genomic rearrangements that are unique in CMS
cytoplasm, and one of the genes that is unique in the CW mitochondrial genome, CW-orf307, appeared to be the
candidate most likely responsible for the CW-CMS event. Genomic rearrangements were dynamic in the CMS lines
in comparison with those of rice cultivars, suggesting that ‘death’ and possible ‘birth’ processes of the CMS genes
occurred during the breeding history of rice.

Background
In contrast to the compact structure of the human
mitochondrial genome (13 genes in approximately 17
kb), higher plant mitochondria are extremely complex
in their constitution, and their process of evolution is
enigmatic. In addition, although animal mitochondrial
genomes are relatively conserved in size, from Homo
sapiens to Mus musculus, the genomic content of plant

mitochondria is highly divergent, ranging from an estimated 200 to 2,400 kb [1]. The conservation of simple
circular mitochondrial DNA that is seen in animals is
even in doubt in plants, and a number of studies have
predicted that the genetic information of plant mitochondria is partitioned into subgenomes [2]. Finally, in
addition to the 13 housekeeping genes also found in animals, plants contain numerous open reading flames
(ORFs) with unknown functions as well as genes with
known functions, such as ribosomal protein subunitencoding genes, that are not observed in the animal
genomes. Although most of these ORFs are considered

to be non-functional and suppressed during development, some studies have reported that several ORFs are
transcribed [3]. These mysteries of the mitochondria are
certainly intriguing in view of the co-evolution of
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. To date, seven
mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced from plant
species: four from dicot species, Arabidopsis thaliana
[4], Beta vulgaris [3,5], Brassica napus [6], and Nicotiana tabacum [7], and three from monocot species,
Oryza sativa [8,9], Zea mays [10,11], and Triticum aestivum [12]. These studies have shown that plant mitochondrial genomes are actually divergent in their noncoding sequences and even in their gene-coding regions;
for instance, the presence of ribosomal protein subunitencoding genes is known to be quite inconsistent
among species [2,13].
Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited male sterile trait, and a significant amount of evidence indicates that this phenomenon stems from
alteration of the mitochondrial genome [14,15]. In many
cases, the product of the unique gene structure in the
CMS mitochondrial genome, consisting of a chimeric
structure of endogenous gene fragments and an alien
sequence, has been demonstrated to be associated with
the mitochondrial inner membrane [16-19]. Most of
these mitochondrial CMS-associated genes (MCAG) are
thought to form a pore within the membrane and,
although the details of the mechanism from pore-forming to CMS occurrence have not been fully elucidated, it
is speculated that MCAGs are responsible for CMS.
Since CMS is often associated with cytoplasmic substitutions, such as successive backcrossing of distantly related
strains, CMS is the key phenomenon that may shed some
light on plant mitochondrial-nuclear interactions.
Studies of the CMS mitochondrial genomes in B. vulgaris [3] and Z. mays [11] revealed the presence of several large recombination events compared to normal
cytoplasm. Satoh et al. [3] sequenced the Owen-CMS
mitochondrial genome in sugar beet, and a comparison
with the non-CMS mitochondria revealed the existence
of several CMS-specific ORFs generated by the genomic
rearrangements. PreSatp6 was later determined to be
the best candidate for MCAG, and the gene products of
PreSatp6 were localized in the mitochondrial inner
membrane in the form of a homo-oligomer [18]. Allen
et al. [11] sequenced five distinct mitochondrial genomes in maize and detected massive genomic recombinations among the lines. Even two of the normal
cytoplasms which were sequenced, NA and NB, were
significantly dissimilar to each other, and it was estimated that there were 16 genomic rearrangements
between the lines. They reported that genome sizes of
the lines ranged from 535,825 bp in CMS-T to 739,719
bp in CMS-C [11].

The 490,520-bp mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza
sativa L.) japonica cultivar Nipponbare was sequenced,
and 53 protein-encoding genes, 17 tRNA genes, and 3
rRNA genes were predicted [8]. When the existence of
the master circle was assumed, at least three large duplications (>10,000 bp) were found, and portions of plastid
and nuclear sequences were frequently inserted, making
the genome even more complex. The mitochondrial
genome of the indica strain 93-11 was also assembled,
and it was predicted to possess 491,515-bp nucleotides
[9]. At the same time, the 490,673-bp mitochondrial
genome was assembled for the strain PA64S carrying
japonica cytoplasm. A total of 96 SNPs and 25 Indels
were predicted between 93-11 and PA64S, but the differences in their overall genomic structures were rather
conservative, in comparison to the report that the
sequence arrangements of two normal cytoplasms from
maize were never in parallel [11].
Based on this background, our intention was to determine whether the characteristics of CMS mitochondrial
sequences of rice are comparable with those of maize or
sugar beet. In rice, more than 60 types of CMS have
been reported (see [20] or [21] for reviews); however,
the mitochondrial sequence has not yet been revealed
for any CMS rice. In this study, we employed two independent CMS lines, LD-CMS and CW-CMS, derived
from the Burmese strain Lead rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp.
indica) and from the Chinese wild rice strain W1
(Oryza rufipogon Griff.), respectively. Using the Nipponbare mitochondrial sequence as a reference, we chose
the high-throughput pyrosequencing method to gather
information about the rice CMS mitochondrial genomes.
A number of genomic rearrangement events were
detected between the two CMS mitochondria in comparison with that of Nipponbare.

Results
Sequence assemblies and assessment of genomic
arrangements in CW-CMS and LD-CMS mitochondrial
genomes

The CW-CMS mitochondrial genome was assembled to
559,045-bp single circular sequences, whereas the LDCMS mitochondrial genome was predicted to have
434,735 bp when the master circle was hypothesized.
When compared with the previously assembled Nipponbare (490,669 bp), PA64S (490,673 bp), and 93-11
(491,515 bp) [9] genomes, the sequence length of the
two CMS lines differed greatly (Table 1). Thus, we
speculated that the predicted mitochondrial genomic
organization of the CMS lines is quite inconsistent with
that of the known cultivars. We plotted the syntenic
regions via the bl2seq algorithm using the Nipponbare
sequence, excluding three large (>10,000 bp) duplicated
regions (Figure 1). When the entire Nipponbare

sequence including duplicated regions (Nipponbare fulllength) was plotted against its truncated version (Nipponbare w/o dup.), we detected the presence of three
large redundant regions in the same positions where we
deleted duplications. However, when we plotted the
sequences from the two CMS lines to the same reference genome (Nipponbare w/o dup.), we found that the
syntenic regions were largely discrepant in their genomic positions (Figure 1). In comparison with Nipponbare, which has three large duplications (>10,000 bp),
we predicted five duplications in the CW-CMS genome
and one in the LD-CMS genome (Table 1, Figure 1).
This feature is consistent with the observation in maize
mitochondrial comparative sequence analysis that the
large duplications accounted for most of the genome
size increases in mitochondria [11], and the largest genome (CW-CMS: 559,045 bp) outnumbered the smallest

genome (LD-CMS: 434,735 bp) in large duplication
events. The number of recombination events was at
least 15-fold higher in the CW-CMS genome compared
to Nipponbare and at least 12-fold higher in the
LD-CMS genome. The hypothetical master circle of
CMS mitochondrial genomes is displayed in Figure 2.
Comparison of nucleotide sequences in genic regions

We compared nucleotide sequences among five mitochondrial genomes: Nipponbare, PA64S, 93-11, and the
two CMS lines. First, 56 protein-encoding genes (including pseudo-genes), 22 tRNA genes (including pseudotRNA), and three rRNA genes found in Nipponbare
were searched in the other genomes (list in Additional
file 1, Table 2, Table 3). Including genes of unknown
functions and ribosomal protein subunits, the appearances of the majority of the genes were constant among

310 amino acids with a recombination event at the
sequence corresponding to its N-terminal region in the
LD-CMS genome (LD-orf310, Figure 3).
We found four non-synonymous mutations in the
CW-CMS genome (Table 2). Two point mutations caused
a single amino acid change from arginine to glycine
(R144G) in rps1 in the CW-CMS genome (Table 2). For
rps2, two point mutations caused two amino acid changes,
K183N and F184Y (Table 2). On the other hand, no
amino acid changes were detected in the protein encoded
by the LD-CMS genome in comparison to that of Nipponbare (Table 2), other than the 6-bp deletion in the pseudorps14 gene-like structure similarly observed in CW. The
presence and the sequences of the electron chain subunitencoding genes, nad, cob, cox, and atp, were completely
conserved among the CMS lines and Nipponbare.

the five genomes. An exception was found for two ORFs
which were missing from the CW-CMS genome. Due to
the N-terminal deletion, the orf152b found in Nipponbare was shortened to an ORF of 92 amino acids in
the CW-CMS genome (Table 3, Figure 3). Only the
N-terminus 294 bp sequences of orf288 were present in
CW-CMS (CW-orf307), whereas the orf288-like
sequence was present but elongated to an ORF encoding

As the genomic arrangements of the CMS lines and
the previously sequenced cultivars were quite divergent
(Figure 1), alignment of the whole genomes to detect
SNPs or InDels was difficult. Thus, we decided to analyze
96 SNPs, 25 InDels, and three segmental sequence variations (SSV) detected by comparing 93-11 and PA64S in
the study by Tian et al. [9]. The genotypes in the sequence
variations are summarized in Additional files 2 and 3. Of
the non-redundant 70 SNPs, only 59 SNPs were detectable
in the CW-CMS and LD-CMS genomes, due to genomic
deletions (Additional file 2). All of the SNP genotypes in
the CW-CMS and LD-CMS genomes were the same
(Additional file 2). Approximately 57% of the SNP genotypes were the same as those shared by the two japonica
genomes (designated j); 14.3% were shared with the indica
strain 93-11, 8.3% with PA64S (p), 2.9% with SNPs shared
by 93-11 and Nipponbare (9/n), and 1.4% were unique to
the two CMS genomes.
Non-redundant InDels and SSVs were also surveyed
and, in parallel to the SNPs, the genotypes of the two
CMS lines were completely identical (Additional file 3).
Approximately 81% of the genotypes in the CMS lines
were equal to japonica type, whereas 14.8% were equal
to 93-11 type. One InDel was highly variable, and we
were able to distinguish all lines in this region except
for the CMS lines (InDel 200488, Additional file 3).
From the above results, the CMS genomes were rather
close to japonica genomes when only the nucleotide
sequences were taken into consideration. Overall, the
sequence variations that we could detect between the
two CMS lines encompassed: the elongation of orf288
into orf310 in the LD-CMS genome, whereas orf288 was
lost from the CW-CMS genome; the absence of orf152b
from the CW-CMS genome; and mutations in rps1 and
rps2 (Figure 3, Additional file 2). Direct sequence comparison of the syntenic regions of the CW-CMS and

LD-CMS mitochondrial genomes revealed 43 SNPs and
InDels in total. Comparison of the syntenic regions of
the CW-CMS and Nipponbare genome revealed 206
SNPs and IndDels, although it is possible in this case
that some of these differences may result from the different sequencing technologies employed. Thus the two
CMS genomes were relatively similar to one another in
comparison to the other mitochondrial genomes. The
phylogenetic relationship estimated from all SNPs of
both genic and non-genic regions is displayed as a dendrogram in Additional file 4.
Gene structures unique in CMS lines

Similar to the studies that reported CMS-specific gene
structures in the CMS mitochondrial genome of other
species [3,11], we also found DNA rearrangements generating several CMS-specific structures. We previously
identified a B-atp6-orf79-like structure in the LD-CMS
mitochondrial genome, L-atp6-orf79 [22]. orf79 is the
strongest MCAG candidate in BT-CMS rice [23-26].
Pyrosequencing enabled us to analyze the surrounding
region of L-atp6-orf79 (Figure 3C). L-atp6-orf79 was on
the long syntenic atp6 region with Nipponbare, but
6,881-bp alien sequences were inserted immediately
after atp6 (Figure 3C). The insertion of 6,881 bp
resulted in the generation of orf79. We have yet to
determine the origin of the insertion sequences, but at
least we were able to determine that the sequence was
not present in Nipponbare, PA64S, 93-11, or the CWCMS line. The L-atp6-orf79 transcripts are co-transcribed in the CMS line and the inter-genic region of
the transcripts is cleaved by the action of the fertility
restorer gene Rf1 [22]. The precise expression analysis

of this L-atp6-orf79 locus was conducted in our previous study [22].
CW-CMS-specific genomic structures were found in
the region around the rpl5 locus with exclusive genomic
recombination involving the orf288 locus (Figure 4A). In
Nipponbare, rpl5 was located upstream of atp1, 8.9 kb
apart from it. In contrast, in the CW-CMS genome, the
promoter region of rpl5 was substituted with other
genomic regions by homologous recombination (Figure
4A). This recombination resulted in the insertion of
nucleotides for 75 amino acids at the N-terminus of
rps2, but the insertion was not considered to affect the
rpl5 ORF structure because of the stop codon between
partial rps2 and rpl5 (Figure 4B). Full-length rps2 was
found in another location in the CW-CMS genome
(data not shown).
A rather interesting finding was the fate of the region
around the atp1 locus because it was involved in the
generation of the chimeric ORF gene, which was comprised of multiple recombination events (Figure 4A).
The upstream region of atp1 was fused to a 294-bp
sequence of orf288 corresponding to its N-terminal
region (Figure 4A), and it was further followed by
1,369-bp unknown sequences and finally linked to the
trnR region which is 26.0 kb away from atp1 in Nipponbare (Figure 4A). The 1,369-bp unknown sequence
found in this locus was not found in the Nipponbare,
PA64S, 93-11, or LD-CMS genomes, although some of
its fragments showed 85% similarity to orf224 (Figure 5).
As we stated previously, a part of orf288 was present in
this region but the full-length copy was not present.
The newly identified gene in this locus, possibly encoding a protein of 307 amino acids, was designated as

region shortened the ORF to a length of 92 amino acids in the CW-CMS genome. (B) Structures of orf288. Nucleotide extension at the
N-terminal region seen in the LD-CMS genome caused the generation of a novel ORF predicted to encode a 310-amino-acid polypeptide

the CW-CMS genome. (C) The 6,881-bp alien sequence insertion in the downstream region of atp6 in the LD-CMS genome.

sequencing the lambda clones covering these regions
(data not shown).
Genomic structures unique in CMS lines

In order to evaluate the uniqueness of these genomic
structures, distribution of the LD- and CW-specific
structures and genes was surveyed in the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS, Japan) global rice
core collection consisting of 69 accessions of worldwide
cultivars [27]. This rice collection retains 90% of RFLP
alleles detected in about 300 accessions selected based
on the passport data from the whole rice collection
(about 30,000 accessions) maintained at the NIAS Genebank [28]. Nine wild rice strains (O. rufipogon), which
had previously been reported to carry a CMS cytoplasm
[29], were also included in this study, so that 78 accessions were tested in total. Six primers able to amplify

the contig linkage regions (described precisely in the
Methods) unique in the two CMS lines in comparison
with Nipponbare were used to detect each amplicon by
PCR. Table 4 summarizes the results of PCR amplification and accessions were categorized into 12 mitochondrial haplogroups (A to L). No amplicon was observed
in any of the accessions using primer pairs CW_02 or
LD_24 (Table 4). Thus, the genomic rearrangement
detected by primer pair CW_02, which corresponds to
the region between the atp1 and rrn26 or rps3 genes in
CW-CMS (Figure 2), and the rearrangement detected by
the primer pair LD_24, which corresponds to the region
between cox1 and trnR in LD-CMS (Figure 2), were
completely unique to each CMS line. The range of the
proportion of the accessions with amplification by four
other primer pairs (CW_19, LD_12, LD_29, LD_30) was
3.8 - 21.8%. Similar to the genomic structure detected
by primer pair CW_02, CW-orf307 was solely present in
the CW-CMS line (Table 4). Excluding two O. rufipogon

accessions (W1086 and W1092, Additional file 5), the
presence of the atp6-orf79 structure was completely
linked with the amplification pattern of LD_12, as
expected from the closeness of the two regions (Table
4). Lastly, distribution of the orf288-like gene in rice
accessions was assessed, as the gene was not present in
the CW-CMS genome (Figure 3, Table 4). Thirty-five
accessions carried the orf288-like structure, whereas no
amplification was observed in the other lines.
Expression analysis of genes involved in the
recombination events

We investigated whether the genes involved in the
recombination to generate the chimeric CW-orf307 locus
were affected in terms of their expression patterns. As a
result, cox1, orf284, orf165, atp1, cox2, trnR, rpl5, and
rps2 were expressed in the CW-CMS calli (Additional file
6), whereas the orf224 transcripts were extensively
reduced in the CW-CMS line (Additional file 6). Due to
the recombination event with rps2, rpl5 probably
acquired a new promoter and, as a result, transcript elongation of rpl5 occurred (Figure 4B, Additional file 6).
For CW-orf307, the regions that do not include partial
orf288 were used as probes (probes 1-3, Figure 6). We
detected a faint band in Taichung 65, the japonica
nuclear donor for the CW-CMS line, using probe 1.
The detection of this slight signal in Taichung 65 might
have occurred via the orf224-like region in probe 1 and
the two regions showing more than 85% identity with
orf224 (Figure 5). On the other hand, we detected a
CW-mitochondria-specific RNA expression using probes
2 and 3, suggesting that the downstream regions of
CW-orf307 were co-transcribed (Figure 6). Although we

checked to see if the presence of the gametophytic
restorer gene, Rf17 for CW-CMS, would have any effects
on the transcript regulation of CW-orf307 in anthers, no
differences in transcript patterns were observed between
a CMS line and a CW-restorer line, CWR, carrying Rf17
and CW-cytoplasm (Figure 6C).

Discussion
We obtained the entire mitochondrial genome
sequences of two rice CMS lines of distinct origin. The
master circle of the CW-CMS mitochondrial genome
was predicted to contain 559,045 bp, whereas that of
the LD-CMS genome had 434,735 bp. From a comparison with the recently assembled Nipponbare (japonica),
PA64S (japonica), and 93-11 (indica) mitochondrial
sequences [9], we found that the CMS genomes were
exclusively rearranged (Figure 1). Based on the novel
genomic rearrangements and unique ORFs discovered
in this study, the mitochondrial haplogroups of the rice
cultivars were divided into at least 12 groups (Table 4).
It is highly likely that several mitochondrial genomic
rearrangements occurred during rice breeding; apparently some rearrangements had deleted the CMS-specific genomic structures (Table 4). For instance, the
strongest MCAG candidate of CW-CMS, CW-orf307,
was absent from all of the other strains tested (Table 4,
Additional file 5). The gene product of CW-orf307 was
predicted to be strongly hydrophobic by SOSUI [30],
which is consistent with the characteristics of previously
known MCAG products [16-19]. Although we failed to
detect a transcriptional alteration of CW-orf307 in the
presence of Rf17, it is still possible that Rf17 could
be related to translational regulation of CW-orf307. The

presence of orf79 was observed in seven cultivars and in
most of the O. rufipogon accessions that were previously
reported to carry CMS cytoplasm [29], but orf79 was
lost from the other cultivars presumably during rice
breeding history (Table 4). The reason we speculate that
orf79 was “lost” from majority of cultivars is because O.
rufipogon genomes are generally considered as the
ancestors of O. sativa cultivars.
The complete copies of orf152b and orf288 predicted in
the Nipponbare genome were not present in the CWCMS mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, a copy of
orf224 was present in the CW-CMS genome, but its
expression was unexpectedly suppressed (Additional file
6), possibly due to alteration of the transcriptional efficiency by the SNP 26 bp upstream of the initiation codon
ATG or the two-nucleotide substitutions within the coding region (Table 2). As orf152b and orf288 were expressed
in Nipponbare (S.F. and K.T. unpublished data), as was

orf224 in this study (Additional file 6), we hypothesize that
these ORFs are genes. Therefore, the genetic functions of
orf152b, orf288, and orf224 were apparently missing or
knocked down in the CW-CMS mitochondrial genome.
Among these genes, the introduction of orf288 in the cultivars seemingly occurred during the rice breeding process.
In fact, orf288 was present in only 35 accessions out of the
69 ‘core-collection’ cultivars and in no accessions from
O. rufipogon, indicating that the acquirement of orf288 at
least had definitely occurred during the breeding history
(Additional file 5). The absence of orf288 in approximately
half of the cultivars indicates that this gene is obviously
not necessary for pollen fertility. Thus the possibility that
a loss of function of orf288 in the CW-CMS line is causing
CMS is not likely, because again absence of orf288 apparently does not induce male sterility in such cultivars lacking orf288. Whether orf288 itself can be directly involved
in CMS is still an open question, but it may be postulated

Fujii et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/209

that the presence of orf288 has contributed to the evolution of a new chimeric CMS gene as a segment of approximately 70 amino acids of orf288 is identical to cox2 (data
not shown), persuading us that orf288 is a chimeric gene.
Therefore, we conclude that compelling evidence of the
‘death’ of MCAG via genomic rearrangements during cultivation was demonstrated in this study and, contrarily,
that the generation of genes such as orf288 may be part of
the ‘birth’ process. The ‘death’ idea is also supported by
the fact that the atp6-orf79-like structure was lost from a
large proportion of the cultivars (Additional file 5).
The actual mechanism underlying the process of
MCAG is considered to be substoichiometric shifting
(SSS), which involves the idea that the copy numbers of
multipartite mitochondrial genomic molecules (subgenomes) change over generations [31,32]. Interactive
recombinations between repeat regions within subgenomes create novel genomic rearrangements, and these
novel subgenomes may be present in low copy numbers
at first, but they can proliferate and become the majority
in subsequent generations by SSS [33]. It has actually
been proven that the knockdown of the homologue of
the Escherichia coli mismatch repair component in
tomato and tobacco unsuppressed the mitochondrial
recombination events, and that it eventually caused artificial CMS possibly intermediated by SSS [34]. Therefore, quantitative measurement of the genomic
rearrangements we found in the above experiments
should provide us with a clearer picture of how the evolution of MCAG took place during rice breeding.
A CMS genome determination study of sugar beet
reported a few CMS-specific chimeric structures, other
than the best MCAG candidate, preSatp6 [3,18]. Maize
CMS sequencing detected one chimeric ORF other than
MCAG T-urf13 in CMS-T; none were detected other
than the best MCAG candidate orf77 in CMS-S; and
none were detected in CMS-C under the 70-amino-acid
cut-off criterion [11]. Whether this is meaningful or not,
we found 480 ORFs in the Nipponbare genome, 591 in
the CW-CMS genome, and 456 in the LD-CMS genome,
using the same 70-amino-acid cut-off criterion. Out of
the ones that were not present in Nipponbare, none
except for the ones we listed (CW-orf307 and LD-orf79)
contained a significant portion of the other known genes.
Whether any one of these kinds of ORFs is actually
related to CMS is still unknown, and it should be emphasized again that Nipponbare as well contains genes that
were not described as related to known mitochondrial
biological processes but are actually transcribed. The
transcribed proportion of these predicted ORFs is undetermined but, based on our current knowledge, detection
of any protein products of these genes has not yet been
reported [35,36].

Page 11 of 15

On the other hand, the generation and maintenance of
a novel chimeric ORF may be allowed by the presence of
certain nuclear genes. Possible candidates of such
nuclear-encoded genes are pentatricopeptide repeat
(PPR)-motif containing genes as discussed below. PPRs
are now undoubtedly considered to be involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation events, mostly in plant
organelles [37-40]. In higher plant species 400 to 600
PPR genes are encoded, and there is concrete evidence
demonstrating that orthologous PPR pairs exist between
rice and Arabidopsis [39]. Most of the Rf genes (nuclearencoded genes responsible for fertility restoration of
CMS) identified to date have been demonstrated to
encode a PPR protein [25,41-48]. PPRs encoded by Rf
genes (Rf-PPR) are exceptional because they are not conserved among the species [39]; they are curiously present
as heavily duplicated clusters of Rf-PPR-like genes in the
genome. This feature resembles that of diversifying selection acting on the evolution of the disease resistance R
genes [49]. There have been a few implications that RfPPRs are actually positively selected [50,51]. One perspective involves the expectation that some Rf-PPR-like
genes may be responsible for preventing protein accumulations from certain predicted ORFs that are transcribed
but untranslated [40]. There has been no concrete evidence demonstrating that the evolution of Rf-PPRs is
related to the generation of novel ORFs in mitochondria;
however, there certainly must be a selective constraint to
the diversifying selection of the Rf-PPRs, in the same
manner as there are pathogens restricting the evolution
of the R genes. Our current study suggested that rice
mitochondrial genomic rearrangement is an on-going
event, and it seems quite reasonable to consider that frequent novel ORF generation as a consequence is the driving force of Rf-PPR diversification.

Conclusion
We have shown that the mitochondrial genomes of the
two CMS lines are greatly reorganized in comparison
with that of Nipponbare. There appear to be a few genomic structures that are relevant to CMS, and finding
these structures within rice cultivars and wild accessions
provided us with the idea that genomic recombination
events during rice breeding history diminished these
unique genomic structures of CMS and, on the other
hand, presumably gave rise to novel ORFs.
Methods
Plant materials

The origins of two independent rice CMS lines, LDCMS and CW-CMS, were described in our previous studies [22,52]. LD-CMS is derived from the Burmese cultivar Lead rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) [53], and

Fujii et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/209

CW-CMS originates from the Chinese wild rice strain
W1 (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) [54]. The nuclear donor
maintainer line Taichung 65 (japonica) was used as the
control for the RNA expression experiment. The development of a restorer line for CW-CMS, CWR, carrying
the fertility restorer gene Rf17 which functions in a
gametophytic manner [52], was described in our previous studies [52,55]. The NIAS global rice core collection [27] was obtained from the National Institute of
Agrobiological Sciences Genebank (Tsukuba, Japan).
O. rufipogon accessions were obtained from the National
Institute of Genetics (Mishima, Japan).
Mitochondrial DNA extraction

Mitochondria were purified on sucrose gradients, as
described by Tanaka et al. [56]. The DNeasy plant mini
kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract
DNA from the mitochondrial fraction.
Sequence assembly

Pyrosequencing was conducted on the GS-FLX system
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in TaKaRa-Bio (Otsu, Japan).
We obtained 15,965,332-bp nucleotides for the CWCMS genome and 15,020,464-bp nucleotides for the
LD-CMS genome. Sequences were assembled to the
average of 5,123-bp-long 824 contigs for the CW-CMS
genome, and 4,966-bp-long 1,188 contigs for the LDCMS genome, using the GS De Novo Assembler Software (Roche). The average sequence depth, which was
defined as the sum of redundancies of each base divided
by the length of the respective contig, was 41.74 for the
CW-CMS genome and 44.75 for the LD-CMS genome.
As many turning points and false linkages were considered, these contigs were manually assembled by the following criteria. (1) The depth of the bridging contigs
had to be over 15, as bridging contigs with a depth
under 15 often linked ‘dead-end’ contigs that were only
linked to one another. Also, bridging contigs with a
depth under 15 frequently linked fragments that were
considered to be nuclear contaminants. (2) ‘Dead-end’
contigs were ignored. In addition, depth values of these
‘dead-end’ contigs (<15) were lower than those of nondead-end contigs (>15). (3) Contigs that matched 100%
with the Nipponbare or 93-11 nuclear genomic
sequences were ignored as they were considered to be
nuclear contaminants and, as in the case of ‘dead-end’
contigs, depth values of these contigs were always under
15. (4) Plasmid-like sequences, corresponding to B1, B2,
B3, and B4 reported to be present in rice mitochondria
[57,58], were deposited to DDBJ (under accession nos.
AB523794 to AB523802), but they were not analyzed in
this study. Their characteristics will be presented elsewhere in detail.

Page 12 of 15

These criteria left us with 19 contigs with an average
length of 17,877 bp for the CW-CMS genome, and 24
contigs with an average length of 14,828 bp for the LDCMS genome. Following these steps, the candidate linkage of the contigs was validated by PCR analysis (Additional file 7, and see Additional file 8 for the primer
sets). Based on the linkage information of the contigs
confirmed as well by PCR analysis (depicted in Additional files 9 and 10), master circles were developed for
each genome by a ‘parsimonious’ method, so that each
contig appeared at least once to construct the smallest
genome. For the CW mitochondrial genome, there were
eight alternative master circle patterns, and 64 patterns
for the LD genome. In this paper, one pattern of the
master circle was chosen for brevity of presentation
(Additional file 11).
The BLASTN program in NCBI tools [59] was used
to assign these contigs to the reference Nipponbare
mitochondrial genome (DQ167400; described in [9]),
and BLASTN was also used to eliminate nuclear
genomic contaminations for the above criteria. Handling of the sequences was performed by Sequencher
v4.2.2 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Harbor, Minnesota). The Genomematcher v1.2 program
[60] was used to plot the sequenced genomes with
the reference Nipponbare genome by bl2seq. To avoid
the possibility of detecting duplicated regions more
than twice, the Nipponbare genome without large
duplicated regions (>10,000 bp) synthesized for this
study was referenced. Annotated sequences were
deposited to DDBJ under accession nos. [DDBJ:
AP011076] for CW-CMS and [DDBJ:AP011077] for
LD-CMS.
Sequence comparison

Known mitochondrial genes in Nipponbare were
BLASTN searched in the CW-CMS and LD-CMS genomes, and SNPs and Indels were detected. ORFs were
attached to the newly sequenced genomes by the est2
genome program included in the EMBOSS v6.0.0 package [61]. Fifty-six protein-encoding genes (including
pseudo-genes), 22 tRNA genes (including pseudo-tRNA)
and three rRNA genes analyzed in this study are listed
in Additional file 1. To obtain information for the genes
that are not present in the Nipponbare genome, gene
predictions were performed using the ORF Finder program [59] and Genemark.hmm for the Prokaryotes v2.4
program [62]. Six-frame-translation was performed
using the getorf software included in the EMBOSS
v6.0.0 package [61]. Since MCAG found in rice BTCMS mitochondria genome encoded a protein of 79
amino acids, the ORFs predicted to encode peptides
shorter than 70 amino acids were ignored.

Fujii et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:209

Information on SNPs and InDels among Nipponbare,
PA64S (DQ167807), and 93-11 (DQ167399) was
obtained from the study by Tian et al. [9]. We considered it difficult to directly compare the pyrosequence
data obtained in this study to that of the sequences
obtained by shotgun sequencing in Tian et al. [9]
because differences in sequence accuracies between the
two strategies might be significant. Thus, instead,
known SNPs and InDels in 93-11 vs PA64S [9] were
surveyed in LD-CMS and CW-CMS genomes. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial genomes were performed using RAxML v 7.04 [63].
Construction and screening of the lambda library

The lambda library was constructed from total DNA isolated from the leaves of CWR, carrying CW cytoplasm, by
the CTAB method [64]. DNA partially digested by Sau3AI
(TaKaRa-Bio) was ligated into lGEM-11 XhoI half-site
arms (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) using Ligation high
(TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and packaged using Gigapack
III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, California)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Lambda clones
were screened using the probes synthesized from PCR and
primer pairs 5’-AGTACCAAAAGCTGCCTCTG-3’ and
5’-TTTCCCCCTCATCTTTTAGC-3’ for the rpl5 region,
and 5’-GCATGATGATCCGATAATC-3’ and 5’TAGGTTCGTTATCAGCGG-3’ for the CW-orf307
region, respectively. Inserts in isolated clones were subcloned into pBluescript SK- after digestion by BamHI,
SacI, SalI, or XbaI (Takara-Bio, Otsu, Japan), and
sequenced by the CEQ 8000 Genetic analysis system
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California). As a result of
sequencing 20,513 bp, two mismatches were detected in
comparison with pyrosequencing, thus the accuracy of
pyrosequencing was estimated as 99.99%.
Expression analysis

Mitochondrial RNA was extracted from calli using
the typical phenol/chloroform RNA isolation method.
For anthers at the tricellular pollen stage, total RNA
was extracted using the same method. Mitochondrial
RNA (2.5 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel
after denaturation by formamide treatment and transferred to a nylon membrane. Primers used to design
probes for northern hybridization are listed in Additional file 1.
