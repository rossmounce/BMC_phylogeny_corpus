Virulence of Newcastle disease virus: what is
known so far?
Jos CFM Dortmans1,2*, Guus Koch1, Peter JM Rottier2 and Ben PH Peeters1

Abstract
In the last decade many studies have been performed on the virulence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). This is
mainly due to the development of reverse genetics systems which made it possible to genetically modify NDV and
to investigate the contribution of individual genes and genome regions to its virulence. However, the available
information is scattered and a comprehensive overview of the factors and conditions determining NDV virulence is
lacking. This review summarises, compares and discusses the available literature and shows that virulence of NDV is
a complex trait determined by multiple genetic factors.

1. Introduction
The virulence of a virus is determined by multiple
genetic factors. These may involve its tissue or organ
tropism, its ability to deal with the host’s immune system and/or its efficacy of replication. In the literature
the definition of a virulence factor or virulence determinant is not always clear-cut. Thus, many studies concluded that if a genetic mutation in a gene or a
complete knock out of the gene function results in an
attenuated phenotype, this particular gene or amino acid
sequence is a virulence determinant. However, some
proteins or protein domains are involved in basic replication processes, making them essential for virus reproduction. Hence, the terms “virulence factor” and

“virulence determinant” should be used with care. Our
definition of a virulence determinant is: a naturally
occurring genetic difference between strains of the same
species that is responsible for their difference in virulence. However, nowadays reverse genetics allows the
genetic modification of viral genomes almost at will and
as a consequence the effects of genetic modifications
that have not been encountered in nature can also be
studied. Indeed, these techniques have resulted in much
more detailed information on the involvement of viral
genes and proteins in the virus life cycle and consequently on their contribution to virulence. Therefore, it
is arguable whether a particular “artificial” genetic difference still meets the above mentioned definition of a
virulence determinant. Similar effects may occur in nature but may be countered by other factors or may be
too subtle to be determined by the particular test used
to measure differences in virulence.
Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important
infectious diseases of poultry. It is distributed worldwide
and has the potential to cause large economic losses in
the poultry industry [1,2]. Its causative agent is Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a virus that is able to infect
over 240 species of birds and which spreads primarily
through direct contact between infected and healthy
birds [3]. The first outbreaks of ND in Java, Indonesia,
and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, were reported during the mid-1920s [4,5]. Within a few years ND had
spread throughout the world and became endemic in
many countries [2].

NDV occurs in the field as a variety of strains which
differ extensively in the organ systems that they affect
and in the severity of the symptoms that they produce
in infected birds. Based on the severity of the disease in
chickens, NDV has been classified into three pathotypes:
lentogenic, mesogenic and velogenic. Lentogenic NDV
strains cause subclinical infection with mild respiratory
or enteric disease and are considered low-virulent.
Mesogenic NDV strains are of intermediate virulence
causing respiratory infection with moderate mortality (<
10%), while velogenic NDV strains are highly virulent
causing mortality rates up to 100% [6]. Velogenic strains
are further classified into viscerotropic velogenic and
neurotropic velogenic strains. Viscerotropic velogenic
strains produce lethal haemorrhagic lesions in the viscera, whereas neurotropic velogenic strains cause neurological and respiratory disorders [1,7]. The study of
virulence and the identification of viral determinants of
disease severity is important because an understanding
of the mechanisms underlying the outcome of infection
may enable a more effective prophylactic or therapeutic
approach for viral diseases.

2. Determination of NDV virulence
Low virulent NDV strains need the addition of exogenous trypsin to spread from cell to cell and to form syncytia in cell culture monolayers, whereas virulent strains
do not [8,9]. Therefore, it was already suggested that the
NDV plaque size correlates with virulence [10,11]. However, other studies have shown that the plaque size is
highly dependent on the use of certain viral mutants,
strains and cell types, and that it cannot be considered
as a reliable marker for viral virulence, leaving the study
of this crucial biological feature unfortunately to the
realm of animal experimentation [12-16].
Useful in vivo tests for the assessment of virulence are
the mean death time (MDT) in embryonated chicken
eggs [17], the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) in
six-week-old chickens [18] and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in one-day-old chickens [19].
Although in most cases the MDT and the IVPI may
give a useful indication of virulence, they are considered
to be imprecise, particularly when used to assess viruses
isolated from hosts other than chickens [18,20,21]. Consequently, these assays are not considered sufficiently
reliable for the characterization of NDV isolates in case
of a suspected outbreak [19,22].
The generally accepted method to measure the virulence of NDV strains is the ICPI [19], because of its
established accuracy and sensitivity [18]. The variation
in virulence of different NDV isolates is reflected in the
index which ranges from 0.0 (avirulent viruses) to 2.0.
(high virulent viruses). Although useful for the sake of
defining virus virulence for control purposes, the use of

Page 2 of 11

the ICPI for virulence determination for research goals
may be criticized, particularly because intracerebral
inoculation is obviously an unnatural way of infection.
Indeed, in some cases phenotypic differences observed
after intracerebral infection were not observed when the
natural infection route was used [23-25]. It should also
be noted, that some differences may exist in the execution of the test. In some studies non-standard amounts
of inoculum were used for the ICPI [26-28]. In these
particular studies 103 plaque forming units (PFU) were
used per chicken, which is probably much less than the
amount of virus in the inoculum prescribed by the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and EU
guidelines that consists of a 1 to 10 dilution of allantoic
fluid with an haemagglutination (HA) titre of at least 24
[19]. Nevertheless, despite these discrepancies the ICPI
test in general is a reliable and reproducible test providing a good indication of the relative virulence of different viruses.

3. Newcastle disease virus
NDV is a paramyxovirus and viruses from this family
are enveloped, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA
viruses, which - together with the Pneumovirinae - constitute the family of Paramyxoviridae [29]. NDV, or
avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1), is classified in
the genus Avulavirus of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae
[29]. NDV viruses belong to one serotype and there are
two classes [30]. The genome of class I viruses consists
of 15 198 nucleotides (nt) and the genome of class II
viruses consists of 15 186 or 15 192 nt. [30]. The genome contains six open reading frames (ORF) which
encode the nucleoprotein (NP), the phosphoprotein (P),
the matrix protein (M), the fusion protein (F), the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the large protein
(L). At least one additional, non-structural protein (V)
and possibly a second one (W), are generated by RNA
editing during P gene transcription [31].
Virus infection is initiated by attachment of the virion
to the surface of the target cell. Binding of the viral HN
glycoprotein to sialic acid-containing cell surface proteins, which serve as receptors, triggers the F proteinpromoted fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma
membrane of the host cell through a pH-independent
mechanism, similar to other paramyxoviruses [32]. The
viral nucleocapsid or ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP)
contains the RNA genome encapsidated with NP and
associated with the polymerase complex composed of
the P and L proteins. After entry, the viral nucleocapsid
dissociates from the M protein and is released into the
cytoplasm. Subsequently, the polymerase complex transcribes the viral genomic RNA to produce the mRNAs
that are required for the synthesis of the viral proteins.
Binding of the polymerase complex to the nucleocapsid

Dortmans et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:122
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/122

is mediated by the P protein, whereas the catalytic activities are functions of the L protein [33-37].
The switch from transcription to genome replication
takes place when sufficient amounts of viral protein
have accumulated. The polymerase complex is responsible for the synthesis of full-length plus-strand antigenomic RNA, which in turn serves as the template for
synthesis of minus-strand genomic RNA. Viral nucleocapsids are then assembled by association of NP with
the newly formed genomic RNA and with the polymerase complex. All components of the virus particle are
transported to the plasma membrane where they are
assembled under the direction of the M protein. Virions
are released from the cell by a process of budding
(reviewed in [38]). Finally, the neuraminidase activity of
the HN protein facilitates the detachment of the virus
from the cell and removes sialic acid residues from progeny virus particles to prevent self-aggregation [32,39].
The genome of negative-strand RNA viruses is exclusively present in viral particles in the form of the RNP;
naked viral RNA is not infectious. However, the development of reverse genetics for negative-strand RNA
viruses has allowed the production of infectious virus
from cloned cDNAs and has made genetic modification
possible (reviewed in [40] and [41]). Currently, reverse
genetics systems for NDV are available for the lentogenic strains LaSota [42-44] Hitchner B1 [45] and
AV324/96 [46], the mesogenic strains Beaudette C [47]
and Anhinga [48] and the velogenic strains Herts/33
[49], ZJ1 [50] and RecP05 [51]. It should be noted that
most rescued viruses are less virulent than the parental
wild-type virus from which they were derived. This
observation might be explained by genomic bottlenecks
during the cloning process that result in loss of genomic
variability and viral population fitness [52,53]. Nevertheless, the availability of a reverse genetics system for
NDV as well as for other viruses has provided essential
information and tools to study the molecular mechanism of viral replication and pathogenesis in great detail.

4. Viral entry proteins: major virulence
determinants
Entry of many enveloped viruses, including NDV, into
host cells often requires the activation of viral fusion
glycoproteins through cleavage by intracellular or extracellular proteases. It has been shown that viral glycoprotein activation is often mediated by proteases
recognizing either monobasic or multi-basic cleavage
sites [54]. In the early days, virulence studies were performed after exposing NDV strains to mutagens in
order to induce differences in the functionality of certain proteins. As a result, the mutants gained or lost the
ability to form plaques in cell culture and had a shorter
or extended MDT in embryonated chicken eggs [55,56].

Page 3 of 11

Extensive in vitro studies of Nagai et al. [57,58] showed
that in all studied NDV strains, virulence in chickens
correlated with cleavage of the F protein of the virus.
Cleavage of the precursor glycoprotein F0 into F1 and
F2 by host cell proteases is essential for progeny virus to
become infective [9,55,58,59]. Lentogenic viruses have a
monobasic amino acid motif at the F cleavage site, 112GR/K-Q-G-R↓L117, and are cleaved extracellularly by trypsin-like proteases found in the respiratory and intestinal
tract. Mesogenic and velogenic strains have a multibasic amino acid motif at the F cleavage site, 112R/G/KR-Q/K-K/R-R↓F117 and can be cleaved intracellularly by
ubiquitous furin-like proteases [58,60,61]. This results in
a systemic infection that is often fatal. Thus, viral replication in the animal is dependent on proteolytic activation of the virus, as predicted from the previous studies
in cell culture and chick embryos [59]. It could be concluded that the amino acid sequence at the F protein
cleavage site is a major determinant of NDV virulence
[58,61].
Consistently, studies with recombinant NDVs generated by means of reverse genetics showed that the virulence increased significantly when the cleavage site of a
lentogenic strain was converted into that of a velogenic
strain [43,62,63]. In these studies the ICPI increased
from 0.00-0.01 to 1.12-1.28 (Table 1). Furthermore, the
ICPI of velogenic NDV strain ZJ1 could be decreased
from 1.89 to 0.13 by changing 3 nucleotides in the genome sequence that specifies the cleavage site [64]. Also
a single amino acid change, Q114R, in the cleavage site
resulted in a decrease in the ICPI index [65]. However,
there are observations indicating that the ICPI does not
always correlate with the severity of clinical disease in

adult chickens inoculated via a natural route of infection. In one study, for example, 4-week-old chickens
were inoculated intraconjunctivally with the recombinant NDV strain NDFLtag, a derivative of the lentogenic
LaSota strain, containing a velogenic cleavage site.
When compared with the lentogenic strain only a small
effect of the mutation on the pathogenesis in chickens
was observed [25]. This study and the observation that
the ICPI value of viruses of lentogenic origin containing
an artificial velogenic cleavage site is not as high as that
of the velogenic strains from which the cleavage site was
derived [43,62,63] suggests that there must be other factors that contribute to virulence and to the extent of
clinical disease.
Several studies have shown that the consequences of
an infection are not solely determined by the presence
of a multi-basic cleavage site motif in the viral fusion
protein. A recent study with an avirulent avian paramyxovirus serotype 2 (APMV-2) virus showed that this virus
does not require exogenous protease supplementation
for growth in cell culture. In addition, recombinant
APMV-2 viruses in which the cleavage site was replaced
by that of APMV serotypes 1 to 9 gained in cleavability,
replication and syncytium formation in infected cells,
but remained avirulent for chickens [66]. Also, a recombinant NDV LaSota virus (NDFLtag), containing a velogenic cleavage site motif, showed an increase in
virulence after one passage in chicken brain as determined by an increase in ICPI from 1.3 to 1.7, while
sequence analysis of the entire F gene did not show any
mutations [67]. Furthermore, some pigeon derived NDV
strains, the so-called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1
(PPMV-1), cause minimal disease despite their F proteins having a multiple basic amino acid sequence. However, they do have a virulence potential in chickens that
can emerge upon serial passages in these animals
[68-71]. Sequence analysis of such passaged viruses
showed that the F protein sequence had not changed
and could thus not explain the increase in virulence
[69,71,72]. This observation has been confirmed using
an infectious cDNA clone of PPMV-1 strain AV324 to
prove that the low virulence for both chickens and
pigeons [46,73] is an inherent property of this particular
virus and is not due to the virus preparation actually
consisting of a mixture of low- and high-virulent variants. Furthermore, replacement of the F gene of a virulent NDV strain by that of a non-virulent PPMV-1
strain and vice versa did not affect the virulence of the
recipient viruses (Table 1), indicating that the non-virulent phenotype of the PPMV-1 strain must be determined by other factors [46].
The HN protein is responsible for the attachment of
virus particles to sialic acid-containing receptors on cell
surfaces and for triggering the fusion activity of the F

Page 4 of 11

protein during entry of the virus into the host cell. In
addition it acts as a neuraminidase, removing sialic acid
from progeny virus particles to prevent viral self-aggregation [32]. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of
NDV HN genes has demonstrated that there are three
different HN genotypes resulting in proteins of 571, 577
or 616 aa. The HN protein of 616 aa was detected in
some lentogenic strains and appears to be a precursor
that needs to be processed into biologically active HN
by proteolytic removal of a small glycosylated C-terminal fragment [57,58,74-76]. Because the F and HN proteins are closely associated in the virion membrane and
in view of the correlation between proteolytic activation
of the F protein and viral virulence, it was suggested
that processing of this HN precursor might also affect
virulence. However, a study investigating the effect of
the length of the HN open reading frame on virulence
could not show any correlation [63].
Several reverse genetics studies have addressed the
contribution of HN to virulence either by exchanging
genes between strains, by mutating the glycosylation
sites, or by mutating specific residues. The results of
these studies are, however, not always in agreement and
are therefore not conclusive as to the contribution of
HN to virulence. In one of these experiments, a recombinant LaSota virus containing the HN protein of the
mesogenic Beaudette C strain showed a significant
increase in virulence, changing the pathotype of the
recombinant virus from lentogenic to mesogenic [27]. In
contrast, another study with exactly the same recombinants could not confirm the results of the MDT and
ICPI tests, as shown in Table 2[24]. However, this study
did show a decrease in IVPI caused by the HN protein
when comparing rBC(HN) L with its parent rBC and
confirmed the suggestion that the HN protein determines tissue tropism [27]. This also confirmed findings
of a previous study in which the HN protein of the low
virulent LaSota virus was substituted by that of the velogenic strain Herts or by an HN chimera consisting of
the stem region of strain Herts HN and the globular
head of that of LaSota, or vice versa [49]. Whereas the
ICPI of the resulting recombinants, NDFLtag(HN) H ,
NDFLtag(HN) LH and NDFLtag(HN) HL (Table 2), did
not differ from the parent strain NDFLtag, these recombinants did show a significant increase in IVPI value,
suggesting that both the stem region and globular head
of the HN protein are involved in determining virus
tropism and virulence. The same conclusion could be
drawn from a study in which the same chimeric HN
genes were used to replace the HN gene of the virulent
Herts strain (Table 2).
A similar approach was used by Estevez et al. who
created chimeras by exchanging the HN gene of a mesogenic strain by that of a neurotropic or viscerotropic

velogenic virus [48]. Introduction of such an HN gene in
the NDV Anhinga backbone failed to increase virulence
from a mesogenic to a velogenic pathotype when introduced via the ocular infection route in both day-old and
4-week-old chickens [77]. Both studies suggested that
NDV virulence is determined multigenically.
In a recent study the role was investigated of the F
and HN proteins of two phenotypically contrasting
viruses: the moderately virulent NDV virus Beaudette C
and the avirulent virus APMV-2 [78]. By simultaneously
exchanging the F and HN ectodomains between these
viruses it was shown that the two contrasting phenotypes correlated with the origin of the F and HN ectodomains when analysed for replication in vitro,
syncytium formation, MDT, ICPI, and replication and
tropism in 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens. The
authors concluded that these ectodomains together
determine cell fusion, tropism, and virulence phenotypes
of NDV and APMV-2. Furthermore, the regions of HN
that are critical for the species-specific phenotypes
include the cytoplasmic tail and stalk domain, but not
the globular head domain.

A key amino acid that showed its importance for the
biological activity of the HN protein is residue Y526,
which is near the sialic acid binding site in the globular
head region. Mutation Y526Q resulted in a decrease in
viral haemadsorption activity, neuraminidase activity and
fusion activity. Furthermore, this mutation had an attenuating effect on the growth kinetics in cell culture, mean
death time and the ICPI value [79]. On the other hand, a
recent report showed that although a single amino acid
substitution I192M, affects both fusion and neuraminidase
activity, it had no effect on the virus pathotype [80].
In many cases proper glycosylation of viral proteins is
important for their correct function in the virus life
cycle [81]. Modification of HN’s N-linked glycosylation
sites has been shown to decrease NDV virulence [28].
Since most of the glycosylation sites in the NDV HN
protein are well conserved, they seem to play an important role in the biological function of the protein.

5. Immune evasion and virulence
The interferon (IFN) system is the first line of host
defence against virus infection. Interferons induce an

antiviral state that can inhibit virus replication and control virus spread. Paramyxoviruses have evolved
mechanisms to escape or prevent both IFN production
and IFN responsive signal transduction to evade or
antagonize the innate immune response of its host
[82-84]. Many paramyxovirus IFN evasion activities are
mediated by the virus-encoded V protein, which is conserved in the genera of the Paramyxovirinae, with the
exception of human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1), which lacks an intact V ORF [85]. The NDV V protein is derived from the polycistronic P gene, which is
edited during transcription by inserting one or two G
residues at the conserved editing locus (AAAAAGGG),
thereby generating altogether three P-gene-derived
mRNA species. The mRNAs encode the open reading
frame (ORF) of P (unedited), the V ORF (+1 frameshift),
and the W ORF (+2 frameshift) [31,86]. The IFNantagonist activity of NDV and many other paramyxoviruses has been mapped to the cysteine-rich C-terminal
domain of the V protein [26,87,88], which is highly conserved among several paramyxoviruses [82-84].
A recent study showed that the V protein of the mesogenic Beaudette C strain exhibits a greater antagonistic
effect on IFN induction in vitro than that of the lentogenic LaSota strain. This might correlate with their different virulence properties in vivo [89]. Previous studies
using recombinant NDV that lacked the expression of
the V protein already suggested that this protein plays an
important role in virulence (Table 3). Its contribution to
NDV virulence was demonstrated in chickens [24,26]
and embryonated chicken eggs [90,91]. Furthermore, its
function was investigated in cell culture [26,87,90,91].
NDV mutants that completely or partially lack the V protein or that contain a mutated V protein show severe
growth impairment in vitro, while their replication in
embryonated chicken eggs is age-dependent [26,90,91].
Probably, a reduction in growth of mutant viruses in
older embryonated eggs is due to maturation of the host

innate immune system and, most likely, the inability of
the mutant viruses to counteract the IFN response,
which is better developed in older embryos [92].
It has been shown that viruses with mutated V proteins, in contrast to their parent viruses, are unable to
degrade the STAT1 protein [26], which is an important
element of the interferon signalling pathway [93].
Furthermore, in vitro experiments have shown that
these viruses have an increased rate of apoptosis [91]. In
addition, in vivo studies showed that the apoptotic rates
corresponded to the severity of the clinicopathological
disease of different strains [94]. The results obtained in
studies on the V protein of NDV are in agreement with
in vivo studies of measles virus and Sendai virus pathogenesis, which showed that deletion of the V protein
attenuates viral virulence [95,96].
No studies have been published in which the V genes
have been exchanged between different NDV strains, as
has for instance been done for the F, HN, or L genes. In
an unpublished study, the V proteins of the low virulent
LaSota virus and the highly virulent Herts virus were
compared by expressing them in a V-negative Herts
backbone with an intact P ORF. The V genes were
inserted between the P and M ORFs. No differences in
ICPI value between the two recombinants were observed
(M. Tacken, O. de Leeuw and L. Cornelissen, personal
communication). Altogether, the studies mentioned
clearly indicate that the V protein is essential for survival and replication of the virus in its host. However,
more studies, especially using the natural infection
route, must be performed to examine whether the V
protein is also involved in determining differences in
virulence between NDV strains.

6. Replication and virulence
A correlation between virulence and the efficiency of
viral replication has been observed for many viruses.
Although not fully understood, it is quite conceivable
that higher levels of viral replication result in more virus
production which may overwhelm the host immune
response, hence causing enhanced pathogenesis. It has
been reported for NDV that reduced levels of RNA
synthesis are associated with reduced virulence [97]. For
several other paramyxoviruses such as measles virus
[98,99], respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza
virus [100,101], virus attenuation has been associated
with mutations in components of the replication complex. For influenza virus the viral polymerase proteins
PB2 and PA are known to contribute to virulence
[102-105]. In addition, transcriptional and translation
control signals may also modulate virulence by controlling protein expression as has, for instance, been
described for vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus,
canine distemper virus and NDV [12,106-111].

The involvement of the NP, P and L replication proteins in NDV virulence has been examined by generating
chimeric viruses in which genes were exchanged between
strains of different pathotypes [13,112]. In one of these
studies a recombinant Beaudette C virus containing the L
gene of strain LaSota was shown to replicate to higher
levels both in vitro and in vivo and to be slightly more
virulent than its parental virus in one-day-old chickens
(Table 4). However, no effect was found for the NP and P
proteins [112]. In contrast, in our own study all three
proteins that make up the viral replication complex (NP,
P and L) were found to play a significant role in determining the virulence of NDV [13]. By simultaneously
exchanging all genes for the replication proteins between
strains Herts and AV324, the virulent Herts virus became
significantly attenuated, whereas the low virulent AV324
became much more virulent (Table 4). This was also consistent with in vitro studies, which showed that the replication proteins of Herts are more active than those of
AV324. However, the role of the individual replication
proteins remained less conclusive. One possible explanation is that the individual Herts replication proteins are
inherently more active but that optimal activity is dependent on the presence of the cognate interaction partners.
This feature has also been previously observed for the

and L proteins and virulence.

recovered influenza 1918 virus, where the gene segments
show a synergistic effect [113]. Another possible explanation might be that the proteins of the two investigated
viruses originate from two distinct phylogenetic lineages
[114] that are less compatible.
We studied the adaptation of a PPMV-1 strain to
chickens during brain passage. After five passages 3
mutations became dominant in the virus population,
two in the L protein (N1564S and V1694E) and one in
the P protein (N37D) [115]. These mutations resulted in
more efficient replication both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that virulence of PPMV-1 for chickens is directly
related to the efficiency of virus replication. Further
investigations will be needed to unravel the exact
mechanisms of viral transcription, replication and hostinteraction and their effect on virulence.
The viral matrix (M) protein has been identified as
another regulator involved in viral replication. While the
M protein is considered to be the central organizer of viral
morphogenesis and budding [32], it has also been found
to interact with the replication complex and to thereby
affect viral transcription and/or replication, as has been
shown for rhabdoviruses and some paramyxoviruses
[116-121]. With NP as its most likely binding partner
[120,122], the M protein associates with the nucleocapsid
[116-118]. Upon viral entry of the target cell, the nucleocapsid dissociates from the M protein and is released into
the cytoplasm where transcription can occur. The interaction of M with the nucleocapsid might affect transcription
and consequently may have an effect on replication.
Furthermore, it is known that the M protein traffics
between the cytoplasm and the nucleus during the viral
infection cycle [38,123]. It has been suggested that the presence of M in the nucleus may result in the inhibition of
host cell functions [124,125], although this has not yet
been confirmed for NDV. Replacement of the M protein
in strain Herts by that of strain AV324 significantly
decreased the ICPI value, however, the opposite was not
the case, as shown in Table 5[13].

transcription and translation. In measles virus and
canine distemper virus, the long 3’UTR of M and
5’UTR of F play important roles in replication and
virulence of the virus [111,126]. A 6 nt insert in the
5’UTR of the NP gene divides the NDV class II viruses
into two groups, namely one with a genome length of
15 186 nt and another with a genome length of 15 192
nt [30]. The fact that both groups harbour pathogenic
viruses suggests that this 6 nt insert does not play a
major role in virulence.
Deletion of the entire 5’UTR of the HN gene was
shown to affect transcription and translation of the HN
mRNA and thereby virulence [109]. Furthermore, each
UTR seems to be specific for a particular position on
the genome and for its associated gene [108].
The sizes of the intergenic sequences (IGSs), i.e. the
number of nucleotides between the transcription endbox and transcription start-box, of consecutive genes
of NDV vary from a single nt for the first three gene
boundaries to 31 nt for the F-HN and 47 nt for the
HN-L boundaries, respectively. A study has shown that
although NDV can tolerate an IGS length of at least
365 nt, the extended lengths of IGSs down-regulated
the transcription of the downstream gene. Furthermore, all viruses that had extended or decreased IGS
lengths were attenuated in embryonated chicken eggs,
day-old chicks and 6-week-old chickens [12]. While it
is clear that the above described genetic modifications
have an effect on virulence, it is questionable whether
the genomic regions and sequences involved also play
a role in determining differences in virulence between
naturally occurring NDV strains. The sizes of the IGSs
and UTRs of NDV are conserved whereas the nucleotide sequence of these regions may vary to some
extent, which is not unexpected for non-coding
regions.

8. Concluding remarks
More and more studies illustrate that virulence is a
complex trait that is determined by multiple genetic factors. For NDV, the multi-basic amino acid cleavage
motif in the F protein is an absolute prerequisite for
virulence. In addition, other factors are critically
involved in determining virulence, as shown in this
review and summarised in Figure 1. However, we must
note that the contribution of these factors to virulence
may be dependent on the particular virus strain used.
For instance, the use of the atypical PPMV-1 strain
AV324 has revealed significant effects of the viral replication machinery on virulence. These effects would have
been much more difficult to show when using a velogenic strain in which the contribution of the replication
complex is probably relatively low compared to that of
the F protein cleavage site. Another point to consider is

proteins to virulence based on a compilation of the data
shown in Tables 1 to 5. The error bars show standard deviations.

the use of the ICPI as a readout parameter of virulence.
As argued above, this test uses an artificial inoculation
route and as a consequence it may be questioned
whether the results obtained with this test are always
relevant for the natural situation. Although this test is
often compulsory to determine whether an isolate is
virulent or not, its sensitivity may be insufficient to
detect subtle differences in virulence.
Many questions still remain concerning the molecular
mechanisms used by NDV to regulate tropism, transcription and translation, interference with the host
defence machinery, and how they affect virulence.
Nevertheless, the studies summarised in this review
have contributed significantly to our understanding of
the biology of NDV and can serve as an important
guide for future research on the molecular principles
that determine its virulence.
