Abstract
Background: The facultative, intracellular bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a
serious infectious disease of humans and animals. We identified and categorized tandem repeat arrays and their
distribution throughout the genome of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 in order to develop a genetic typing method for B.
pseudomallei. We then screened 104 of the potentially polymorphic loci across a diverse panel of 31 isolates including B.
pseudomallei, B. mallei and B. thailandensis in order to identify loci with varying degrees of polymorphism. A subset of these
tandem repeat arrays were subsequently developed into a multiple-locus VNTR analysis to examine 66 B. pseudomallei
and 21 B. mallei isolates from around the world, as well as 95 lineages from a serial transfer experiment encompassing
~18,000 generations.
Results: B. pseudomallei contains a preponderance of tandem repeat loci throughout its genome, many of which are
duplicated elsewhere in the genome. The majority of these loci are composed of repeat motif lengths of 6 to 9 bp with
4 to 10 repeat units and are predominately located in intergenic regions of the genome. Across geographically diverse B.
pseudomallei and B.mallei isolates, the 32 VNTR loci displayed between 7 and 28 alleles, with Nei's diversity values ranging
from 0.47 and 0.94. Mutation rates for these loci are comparable (>10-5 per locus per generation) to that of the most
diverse tandemly repeated regions found in other less diverse bacteria.

Conclusion: The frequency, location and duplicate nature of tandemly repeated regions within the B. pseudomallei
genome indicate that these tandem repeat regions may play a role in generating and maintaining adaptive genomic
variation. Multiple-locus VNTR analysis revealed extensive diversity within the global isolate set containing B. pseudomallei
and B. mallei, and it detected genotypic differences within clonal lineages of both species that were identical using previous
typing methods. Given the health threat to humans and livestock and the potential for B. pseudomallei to be released
intentionally, MLVA could prove to be an important tool for fine-scale epidemiological or forensic tracking of this
increasingly important environmental pathogen.

Background
The environmental saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei
is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease endemic to
tropical regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.
Symptoms range in severity from fatal sepsis and acute
community-acquired pneumonia to benign and localized
abscesses. Infection in humans and animals generally
occurs through direct contact of open wounds or abrasions with contaminated water and soil, by ingestion of
contaminated drinking water, or inhalation of infectious
aerosols. Melioidosis is a serious public health threat in
Thailand and northern Australia, where it is associated
with a case fatality rate of approximately 50 and 20%,
respectively [1]. In addition, B. pseudomallei has recently
attracted attention as a potential biological weapon, and
is listed as a Category B biothreat agent by the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2].
The close genetic relationship of B. pseudomallei to B. mallei has previously been demonstrated by DNA hybridization studies [3]. More recently, studies have revealed that
B. mallei is a clonal lineage of B. pseudomallei, and its
recent evolutionary divergence is marked by gene deletions and intra-chromosomal rearrangements [4-7]. B.
mallei, the etiologic agent of glanders, is an obligate parasite of the family Equidae, but can also infect humans
through direct contact with infected animals [8] or occupational exposure [9]. Glanders was once a globally distributed disease, but is currently predominant only in the
Middle East, Africa, Asia and Central and South America.
Due to its highly infectious nature and ability to infect via
aerosol, it was used as a biological weapon during World
War I and World War II [10,11]. It is also listed as a Category B biothreat agent by the CDC [2].
Due to the severe nature of melioidosis, the molecular
epidemiology of B. pseudomallei has been investigated
using various DNA restriction-based methods, including
Pulse Field Gel Electorphoresis (PFGE) [12,13] and
ribotyping [14,15]. PFGE has the ability to resolve potentially polymorphic, large DNA restriction fragments,
while ribotyping uses restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with rRNA genes [16]. Although
both of these methods have been successful in the epidemiological tracking of pathogens [17], their technical

nature can make large datasets more difficult to handle.
Also, neither method is easily standardized for transfer
throughout the scientific and public health community,
and can often lack discriminatory power among closely
related isolates within a species or between closely related
species [18].
Other procedures that have been used for molecular typing of B. pseudomallei involve PCR, such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [19,20] and multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) [6]. RAPD detects differences in
genomes by amplifying segments of unknown DNA.
Drawbacks to this technique include the presence/
absence binary nature of the data and the difficulty in
reproducing banding patterns between reactions (attributed to PCR artifacts). MLST uses concatenated nucleotide
sequences from seven housekeeping genes, that are
assumed to be selectively neutral or under purifying selection [21]. This method provides nucleotide data for multiple haplotypes, is easily amenable to phylogenetic
analyses and can be standardized across laboratories. The
MLST scheme developed for B. pseudomallei is also applicable to B. mallei and B. thailandensis. However, MLST can
be time consuming and expensive, and most importantly
lacks discriminatory power within closely related B. pseudomallei isolates and among the vast majority of B. mallei
isolates, which are all close genetic relatives [6].
Recently, a reliable PCR-based method using variablenumber tandem repeat (VNTR) loci has become a popular
tool for the molecular typing of pathogens [18,22-25]. A
VNTR locus consists of tandemly repeated sequences of
DNA that vary in copy number, creating PCR amplicon
size polymorphisms that are easily detected with gel electrophoresis. Due to increased mutation rates when compared to other regions of DNA and their multi-allelic
nature, VNTRs allow superior discrimination between
closely related isolates. These loci have been successfully
implemented for forensic, epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses of bacterial pathogens with low genetic
diversity, such as Bacillus anthracis, F. tularensis, and Y. pestis [23,26-30].
Due to the success of VNTR typing in other pathogens, the
primary objective of this study was to develop a high-resPage 2 of 20

olution VNTR typing system for B. pseudomallei that is suitable for epidemiological, forensic, phylogenetic and
population genetic studies. Thus the first task for this
study was to characterize tandem repeat loci, including
their distribution and frequency within the B. pseudomallei
genome. Additionally, in order to develop a comprehensive multiple-locus VNTR typing system that utilizes loci
with varying degrees of polymorphism, the second task
was to screen loci that were characteristic of the tandem
repeat loci throughout the genome and examine levels of
polymorphism. Finally, in order to understand the effects
that mechanisms such as recombination and mutation
have on generating the high levels of diversity observed in
this pathogen, it was essential to examine the mutation
rates for the non-duplicated VNTR loci chosen for the typing system, as well as a representative sample of the duplicated tandem repeat regions. Furthermore, the estimation
of mutation rates will allow for future epidemiological
studies that model the transmission of melioidosis in natural populations, similar to published studies on plague
[26].
In this manuscript we describe a multiple-locus VNTR
analysis (MLVA) genotyping system in which 32 independent, tandemly inserted repeated motifs identified in
the B. pseudomallei K96243 genome are amplified using
fluorescently labeled primers in multiplexed PCRs and
separated using capillary electrophoresis. These loci were
highly polymorphic across a globally distributed set of 66
B. pseudomallei and 21 B. mallei isolates, as well as a few
very closely related B. pseudomallei isolates from an outbreak event and two individual patients.

Results
Tandem repeats within the Burkholderia pseudomallei
genome
We observed that in comparison to other bacterial pathogens with similarly sized genomes, such as Bacillus anthracis Ames and Yersinia pestis CO92, the Burkholderia
pseudomallei K96243 genome harbors a relatively large
number of tandem repeat arrays (Figure 1). The large
(4,074,542 bp) chromosome of B. pseudomallei contains
285 (69.9 arrays/Mbp) while the small (3,173,005 bp)
chromosome contains 324 (102.1 arrays/Mbp) tandem
repeat arrays (Table 1). In contrast, the Y. pestis genome
contains only 174 arrays and B. anthracis contains just 66
arrays, at densities of 37.4 arrays/Mb interval and 12.6
arrays/Mb, respectively. In B. pseudomallei, tandem repeat
motif sizes on both chromosomes ranged from 3 to 16 bp
with copy numbers ranging from 4 to 21 units (Figure 2,
A1 and A2). Non-triplet repeat motifs were more common in intragenic regions than inside genes (Figure 2, B1
and B2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/23

Distribution and location of tandem repeats
A χ2 goodness-of-fit test of the "observed" B. pseudomallei
tandem repeat distribution to an "expected" Poisson distribution was significant for both the large (p < 0.001) and
small chromosomes (p < 0.001) using 10 Kb intervals
(Figure 3). The non-random observed distributions for
both chromosomes are consistent with a clustered
arrangement of arrays throughout both chromosomes.
Additionally, the majority of the tandem repeats were
found in intergenic regions of the chromosomes: 74.7%
(n = 213) tandem repeats on the large chromosome and
68.2% (n = 221) on the small chromosome. However, a
portion of these arrays (28.1% on the large chromosome
and 35.2% on the small chromosome) were found inside
or within 40 base pairs upstream of predicted ORFs (Table
1). Longer arrays (≥ 11 repeat units), including even those
with triplet motifs, tended not to be found inside predicted protein coding regions on the large chromosome
(Figure 2A1). Conversely, on the small chromosome,
longer arrays with triplet repeat motifs were found in both
inter- and intragenic locations in almost equal numbers
(Figure 2A2). It was also observed that four-fold more
degenerate arrays were found on the small chromosome
than on the large, and the majority of these degenerate
arrays were located inside coding regions (Figure 2A1, and
2A2).

We found that 36.3% of the total number of tandem
repeat arrays on both chromosomes of B. pseudomallei are
duplicated, at least partially (≥ 20 bp and ≥ 80% similarity), in other locations on either chromosome (Table 1).
Most of these duplications were found in intergenic
regions of the chromosomes and involved the repeat
motif only and not the flanking sequences. The majority
of duplicated tandem repeats on the large chromosome
were, in fact, duplicated on the small chromosome, rather
than on the large chromosome. In contrast, arrays duplicated on the small chromosome were found in equal
numbers on both chromosomes (Table 1). Additionally,
total array lengths were typically longer for duplicated
tandem arrays. For example, 104 of the 108 duplicated
arrays on the large chromosome, and 112 of the 114
duplicated arrays on the small chromosomes are larger
than 200 bp, with the largest almost 6000 bp in size. It
was observed that repeat regions that contained more
than 20 repeat copies were found to be duplicated in
some fashion, and repeat motifs of six and seven bp were
more often duplicated than not (Figure 2).
MLVA development
In order to develop a MLVA system for B. pseudomallei, a
variety of array sizes were screened, from 2 bp repeat motif
by 7 repeat copy unit (i.e. 2 × 7) to degenerate repeat
arrays greater than 500 bp but less than 1000 bp, for a
total of 104 VNTR loci. We also screened both intra- and

intergenically located arrays. Criteria used for including
loci in the MLVA system were 1) variation within the
screening panel (see Methods), either within the globally
distributed or locally distributed outbreak sets, 2) robust
(> 80% success) PCR amplification, and 3) highly discrete
PCR amplicon sizes (minimal partial repeat differences),
based upon locus repeat unit motif. Thirty-two loci met
the above three criteria and were chosen for MLVA development (Tables 2 and 3).
B. pseudomallei and B. mallei genetic relationships
The 32-locus MLVA system was used to characterize 66 B.
pseudomallei and 21 B. mallei isolates from diverse geographic locations (Table 4). These loci provide high levels
of discrimination among different isolates of B. pseudomallei, with the number of alleles ranging between 7 to 28,
and Nei's diversity values between 0.47 and 0.94 across all
B. pseudomallei and B. mallei isolates (Table 3). Furthermore, the MLVA loci amplified equally well in both B.
pseudomallei and closely related B. mallei strains, and
showed variation between and among the two closely
related species. MLVA loci did not PCR amplify in the
more genetically distant B. thailandensis and B. cepacia.

Analysis of allelic variation at 23 loci using a Neighbor
Joining distance algorithm revealed 62 genotypes among
the 66 B. pseudomallei isolates and 19 genotypes among
the 21 B. mallei isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of these
VNTR data provided an extremely high level of strain discrimination even within B. pseudomallei isolates from single melioidosis patients (Patient 465 and chronic lung
patient) and within isolates from a single B. pseudomallei
outbreak focus in Australia (Goat Farms 1 and 2) (Figure
4). The average pairwise genetic distance was 0.86 for B.
pseudomallei, and 0.61 for B. mallei.
A phylogram depicting this analysis indicates four highly
diverse major clusters among the two Burkholderia sp.,
although there is less than 50% bootstrap support for
these branches (Figure 4). These major clusters did not
reveal any noticeable geographic or temporal relation-

ships, with isolates from the same country or the same
time period occurring in all groups. However, there are
many instances in which the relationships between
closely related isolates demonstrate clear geographic correlations with solid statistical support (Figure 4). Additionally, the tree indicates that overall, B. pseudomallei is
much more diverse than B. mallei, although this could be
due to the less geographically diverse nature of the B. mallei isolates. The tree clearly shows that the B. mallei isolates
form a monophyletic group derived from a B. pseudomallei
ancestor. The split between B. mallei and B. pseudomallei is
supported by two MLVA loci (3564 k and 2445 k) that
contain multiple alleles specific to B. mallei.
A comparison of a subset of isolates to other typing methods revealed that MLVA is much more discriminating
between closely related isolates. MLST data for 37 of the
66 B. pseudomallei and four of the 21 B. mallei isolates used
in this study were obtained from the online database [31].
A comparison of MLST and MLVA for these 37 B. pseudomallei isolates revealed seven instances where MLST
sequence types were identical between isolates, while
MLVA genotypes were different in all but two of these
instances (Figure 4). Of particular note was the single
MLST genotype for B. mallei and the multiple MLVA genotypes for the same isolates (n = 4). Additionally, a
ribotyping study revealed three genotypes for seven of the
B. mallei isolates (T2, T4, T5, T7, T9, GB5, GB6), while
MLVA identified unique genotypes for every isolate [32].
Mutation rates of tandem repeats
Parallel serial passages experiments (PSPE) from a single
B. pseudomallei isolate resulted in estimated ~18,000 generations of growth from which lineages were analyzed for
variation in all MLVA loci. Mutational events were
observed in 12 VNTR loci; the number and type of mutations observed are shown in Table 5. We observed comparable numbers of mutations for loci on each
chromosome. There was a noticeable trend towards single
repeat mutations (p = 0.0001) as well as bias towards
insertion mutations (p = 0.0736) (Table 5). No discerna-

Figure 1
Linear repeat array distribution of B. anthracis, Y. pestis and B. pseudomallei chromosomes. Nucleic acid repeat
region "icicle" plots were generated with DNAStar GeneQuest software (Madison, WI). The horizontal scale indicates the linear position in base pairs along the respective chromosomes from the start position of the GenBank FASTA file sequence. The
scale bar to the right of each icicle plot indicates 10 possible repeat sequence combinations as found by the GeneQuest software. The overall length, or number of possible repeat combinations of each icicle, is a measure of the size of the repeated
sequence array found at that position. In general, the longer the icicle, the larger the repeat array. Note that both perfect and
degenerate repeat arrays are found and displayed by GeneQuest, as indicated by the arrows and notes in panel C. The number
of arrays/Mbp and total arrays are all repeat regions found by the software package Tandem Repeats Finder larger than 30 bp
and with an internal similarity greater than or equal to 80%.

repeat motifs were not determined.

ble pattern was observed between loci that had mutations
and those without mutations with respect to array size,
repeat motif GC %, and/or amplification characteristics.
The number of successful lineage PCR amplifications for
the mutating MLVA loci ranged from 75–95 (out of 95
possible), averaging 90.25 ± 5.7; while those from the
non-mutating loci ranged from 82–95, averaging 92.25 ±
3.1 (data not shown). (The basis of these failures is under
investigation, but all mutation rates were corrected appropriately for these missing data.) We observed an average of
1.67 mutations per locus, and mutation rates for individual loci ranged from 5.3 × 10-5 to l.7 × 10-4. The combined
mutation rate across all 32 loci was 1.113 × 10-3, which

represents a discrimination power estimator for this
MLVA typing system (Table 5). It is similar to the Y. pestis
MLVA system rate and greater than the E. coli rate.
We also examined mutation rates for 17 tandem repeat
loci, not included in the final MLVA system, containing
arrays found to be duplicated in up to four different locations within and/or between chromosomes (Table 6). In
contrast to the MLVA loci, all duplicated loci screened
consisted of either six or seven bp repeat motifs, as these
were most commonly found with larger duplicated
regions in the K96243 strain. Also, while the number of
mutations for the duplicated arrays was equal to the

MLVA loci, there were more mutations observed for large
chromosome loci than small chromosome loci. Additionally, there was a nonsignificant trend towards multiple
repeat mutations (p = 0.5127), as well as, a nominally significant trend towards deletion mutations (p = 0.0495)
(Table 6). The multiple repeat mutations ranged from 2 to
6 repeat units. Two of the duplicated loci (1558 k and
3851 k), had less than 50% PCR amplification. Highly
unpredictable PCR amplification was seen with three loci
(3166 k, 1343 k and 2646 k). These PCR failures could be
due to the difficult nature of PCR in a high GC organism
such as B. psuedomallei, or could be indicative of loss of
priming sites due to recombination. The PCR amplification success rates for the remaining loci were comparable
to the MLVA loci. The duplicated loci averaged 2.6 mutations/locus, and combined mutation rate for 15 duplicated tandem repeat loci was also comparable to the nonduplicated MLVA loci, at 1.23 × 10-3 for ~18,000 generations.

Discussion
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a distinctive microbial pathogen due to its ability to survive and exploit a wide variety
of environmental conditions, as well as, the opportunistic
infection of animals. It can cause mild, chronic, or rapidly
progressing and potentially fatal disease states in a range
of animal hosts [33], and it has a demonstrated ability
invade the cells of other eukaryotic organisms such as
fungi and amoeba [34,35]. It has been known to survive
extreme environmental conditions for long periods of
time, including nutrient starvation [36], and chlorine concentrations generally recognized as sufficient for potable
water treatment [37]. This level of environmental flexibility and pathogenic potential may require the B. pseudomallei genome to be highly plastic in order to quickly adapt
to different environments. Indeed, while the large chromosome primarily harbors genes essential for growth, the
small chromosome contains more diverse genes that are
primarily involved in survival and/or exploiting variable

or contingent environmental conditions. Consequently, it
is not biologically surprising that numerous genetic typing methodologies [6,14,15,22], including the MLVA system reported here, find very high levels of genetic diversity
within this organism. The high level of genetic diversity
and host flexibility of the organism suggest enhanced
mechanisms for generating and maintaining adaptive variation through processes such as selection, recombination
and mutation.

the potential for phase variation during the infection cycle
and may be a mechanism to avoid host defenses [5,42].
Thus, given the similarity of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei,
the unusually high number of tandem repeat loci in B.
pseudomallei, as well as their non-random arrangement, as
indicated by a deviation from the expected Poisson distribution (Figure 3), may indicate that coding and non-coding genomic regions use different molecular mechanisms
to adapt to different selective pressures.

The unusually high number of tandem repeats in B. pseudomallei (compared to other pathogenic bacteria with similarly sized genomes such as B. anthracis and Y. pestis, and
other bacteria of similar GC content [5]) is indicative of
potentially high genomic diversity which, in turn, may
facilitate rapid genomic adaptation to a variable environment. While the majority of large VNTRs in B. pseudomallei
are located intergenically and thus may have no direct
phenotypic effect, it has been observed in other bacteria
that such loci, when upstream of genes, can alter important biological functions through mechanisms such as
transcriptional regulation and amino acid changes [3841]. Within coding regions we observed fewer tandem
repeat arrays. The majority of these tandem arrays contain
repeat units in multiples of three, which indicates the
potential for adaptive variation. For example, Nierman et
al. [5] observed variation in triplet repeat unit simple
sequence repeat (SSR) loci that are located inside four
genes coding for surface or putative virulence proteins in
B. mallei and B. pseudomallei. A subsequent serial passage
experiment of B. mallei through several mammalian hosts
revealed indels in seven intragenic SSR loci, five of which
caused frameshift mutations, while the other two were triplet repeats that only added or removed amino acids from
the encoded protein [42]. This variation is consistent with

In addition to the large number of tandem repeats in B.
pseudomallei, there was a prevalence of duplicated tandem
repeats throughout the genome. In B. pseudomallei, 37.9%
of tandem repeats in the large chromosome and 35.2% of
tandem repeats in the small chromosome are found to be
duplicated, at least in part, at other intra- and inter-chromosomal locations. Moreover, a serial passage experiment revealed that the duplicated loci show a contrasting
trend towards deletions, as well as an increased frequency
of multiple repeat changes in comparably sized repeat
arrays, while displaying comparable mutation rates to
non-duplicated loci; which is in contrast to the lack of bias
in Y. pestis [43]. This suggests that the repeat regions
within B. pseudomallei may facilitate large scale genomic
rearrangements through recombination rather than slipstrand mispairing [44]. Although this has not been specifically studied in B. pseudomallei, it has been suggested that
SSRs in Mycoplasma genomes may in fact facilitate
genomic rearrangements via recombination [45], and that
long tracts of tandem repeats may facilitate gene transfer
[46]. Conversely, tandem repeats may not directly cause
recombination, but rather be associated with regions that
are prone to recombination for other reasons. Since
recombination frequency is affected by the length of the
homology between two loci [47] which in turn is control-

led by slip strand repair, the observed tandem repeat patterns could represent an interesting interaction between
slip strand expansion and recombination.
During in vitro passage, mutation events were observed in
multiple B. pseudomallei VNTR loci suggesting similar
mutation rates at many loci. The MLVA combined mutation rate reported in this study is 1.113 × 10-3 mutations/
generation, compared to combined MLVA rates in E. coli
and Y. pestis rates of 6.4 × 10-4 and 1.1 × 10-3 mutations/
generation (respectively) [26,43,48]. The combined rate
is, hence, comparable to those previously observed in E.
coli and Y. pestis and offers similar subtyping discriminatory power. These rate calculations are dependent upon
accurate estimation of the population growth parameters
during serial passage and this may be particularly problematic for B. pseudomallei, which forms highly mucoid
colonies. Experimental serial passage studies in E. coli and
Y. pestis have previously identified a positive correlation
between the in vitro mutation rate and natural locus diversity. This correlation was not detected in B. pseudomallei
(analysis not shown) and it is not immediately obvious
what differs between these pathogens. Perhaps due the
much larger number of VNTR loci in B. pseudomallei, the
current study was based upon an overwhelming number

of equally and highly mutable loci, which are not commonly present in other genomes. In other words, the
marker loci in E. coli and Y. pestis MLVA systems are stratified by their mutability but in the Burkholderia MLVA we
may examining a number loci that are equally mutable.
Thus, there is no correlation with array size. Another interesting difference is in the mutation products, where the
majority (19:1) were single repeat changes. This bias was
greater than observed in the E. coli and Y. pestis studies
where the single-repeat mutational products were about
80% of the total observed. The lack of more two and three
repeat changes needs to be explored in a larger in vitro
population to see if this trend repeats reality in this particular genome.
Here we present a rapid PCR-based MLVA typing system
using 32 independent VNTR loci. Although the initial
development of a MLVA system in this organism was complicated by the quantity and duplicated nature of repeated
regions found in B. pseudomallei and inconsistencies of the
allelic size variation in comparison to the repeat unit size,
we found 23 markers that were useful for phylogenetic
analysis due to high diversity levels, minimal partial
repeat differences and amplification success. An additional nine loci, while demonstrating some partial repeat

sizes, are very useful for even finer scale resolution of
closely related B. pseudomallei and B. mallei isolates from
outbreak situations [49]. While no specific effort was
made to design the MLVA primers specific to B. mallei, all
B. mallei isolates tested amplified well at every locus, as
expected given the phylogenetic relationship of the two
species [6]. Conversely, B. thailandensis and B. cepacia did
not amplify well in any of the loci, indicating that the
MLVA loci primers will not support amplification in more
distantly related bacterial species, although this has not
been explicitly tested. Thus, this MLVA system represents
a reliable method of identifying B. pseudomallei as well as
B. mallei strains. Furthermore, this typing method is an
easily transferable approach to high-resolution molecular
typing analysis using low levels of crudely isolated DNA.
The unique size and fluorescent label of each allele, as
well as automated sizing software, allows for easy classification of each VNTR allele, and capillary electrophoresis
significantly reduces run time.
Due to the relative effects of convergent evolution,
reversal mutations, recombination, gene duplications and
suggested horizontal gene transfer within Burkholderia
pseudomallei, phylogenetic hypotheses have been difficult
to establish. For example, neither MLST [6] nor MLVA are
able to resolve the deeper relationships among distantly
related B. pseudomallei isolates, as illustrated by the poor
bootstrap support for deeper branches (Figure 4) and similar levels of consistency for a subset of the same isolates
(~0.63) (data not shown). This lack of resolution results
in the absence of a geographic correlation within basal
clades, although more derived clades do demonstrate geographic associations between isolates (Figure 4). In comparison, an analysis of Thai and Australian isolates using
MLST exhibited no overlap between sequence types for
the two countries [50]. However, phylogenetic analysis of
these data lacks strong bootstrap values to support this
geographic differentiation. Also, the analysis of historical
isolates of B. pseudomallei using MLST reveals an overlapping sequence type between Australia and Thailand environmental isolates, and does not support the genetic
distinction of isolates from Australia [51]. Thus, phylogenetic hypotheses using both MLVA and MLST data are difficult to establish with isolates that are geographically and
temporally distant.
The present typing system targets VNTR loci over a wide
range of diversity levels and consequently provides resolution between B. pseudomallei and B. mallei, while still providing high levels of discrimination between closely
related isolates due to the high variability of tandem
repeat loci in these bacterial pathogens. Whereas a
number of typing methodologies such as PFGE, ribotyping, RAPDs and MLST have detected differences between
isolates, their resolving power among very closely related

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/23

isolates is less than MLVA [6,14,15,19]. For example,
while MLST analysis provided only a single unique genotype for the B. mallei cluster, MLVA further resolved the B.
mallei group into individual genotypes, even among very
closely related isolates from Turkey with the same
ribotype [32]. Additionally, B. pseudomallei isolates with
the same sequence type often had different MLVA genotypes (Figure 4). This type of high resolution genotyping
can define patterns of mutation within very closely related
isolates from an outbreak, which can then be used for generating phylogenetic hypotheses [49].
A recent study by Liu et al. (2006) used six VNTR loci to
differentiate B. pseudomallei isolates from an outbreak in
Singapore [22]. Four of the six loci used were characterized in the present MLVA study. Two of these loci are
included in this MLVA (Table 2), but the other two loci
were found to be duplicated within the genome, and consequently were not included in MLVA development. This
six-locus MLVA offered insight into the epidemiology of
B. pseudomallei in Singapore, but presented limitations
due to the lack of resolution inherent in agarose gel electrophoresis. Given the partial repeat sizes (as small as 3
bp) seen with capillary electrophoresis, it is doubtful that
all alleles for these loci were detectable using agarose gels,
and thus levels of diversity were underestimated. Additionally, because two of the VNTR loci that were used are
duplicated within the genome, they are not recommended
for phylogenetic analysis due to the confounding phylogenetic effects of gene duplication and associated possibilities for independent evolutionary trajectories.

Conclusion
In summary, the findings of this study suggest that the
prevalence and location of tandemly repeated regions
within the B. pseudomallei genome may generate and
maintain adaptive variation in this bacterial pathogen.
The intragenically located repeat regions, found twice as
frequently on the "contingency-oriented" small chromosome [4], may provide for rapid changes in gene function.
Duplicated repeat regions may facilitate genomic rearrangements which can lead to altered gene regulation.
While the mutation rates of individual repeat regions do
not appear to be enhanced over those in other organisms,
the sheer number of these regions, some of which are
quite large, provides great potential for genetic variation
within this species.
Epidemiological characterization is important in any
pathogen, but most especially for those that are emerging
as global pathogens that may be exploited for biological
terrorism, such as B. pseudomallei. While no typing system
for B. pseudomallei can currently be used to reliably establish deep phylogeneic relationships, the B. pseudomallei-B.

presented here, are important for facilitating the increasingly important epidemiological and phylogenetic characterization of emerging pathogens.

B. thailandensis isolate (ATCC 700388). B. pseudomallei
stains in the screening panel included 15 closely related
isolates from two different outbreaks in northern Australia [49], and 14 geographically diverse isolates from
seven different countries (Table 4). This tiered screening
panel allowed us to identify loci with varying degrees of
polymorphism.

Methods
DNA preparation
DNA for 66 B. pseudomallei and 21 B. mallei isolates was
obtained from different institutions which used different
extraction methods such as Dneasy (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) [52] and phenol/chloroform extraction [32] and
quantified using a Pico Green quantification kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a minifluorometer (Turner
Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). DNA was then normalized
to100 pg/μL for VNTR screening. Isolates for the global
panel were selected to represent a wide variety of isolates
in terms of geographic distribution, host source and date
of isolation (Table 4).
VNTR identification
The complete genome sequence of Burkholderia pseudomallei strain K96243 was obtained from the National Center
for Biotechnology Information [GenBank: NC_006350,
NC_006351] and screened for potentially polymorphic
repetitive sequences that were comprised of ≥ dinucleotide repeats, 4 copies and a total array size of 30 bp using
GeneQuest (Lasergene, Inc., Madison, WI) and Tandem
Repeats Finder [53]. Primers flanking repeat sequences
were designed using Primer Express (Lasergene, Inc., Madison, Wis.).

To assess the variability of repeated regions among a globally distributed set of isolates and to develop a comprehensive typing system for this organism, 104 repeated
regions (48 from the large chromosome, 56 from the
small) were targeted for analysis and subsequent incorporation into a multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) system. These VNTR loci were selected based upon PCR
amplicon size, array size, locus duplication, and proximity to other arrays. Loci resulting in small PCR fragment
sizes (<1000 bp) were favored since such loci amplified
better than larger regions, and are best suited for analytical
platforms. Arrays with fewer than five copies of a motif
were not selected for screening. Loci that were duplicated,
either within or between chromosomes were also eliminated since multiple alleles would confuse a typing system. Lastly, repeat regions in close proximity (<1000 bp)
to other repeat regions were avoided to preserve locus
independence. Loci were not excluded based on their intra
or intergenic location. The 104 candidate loci were examined for robust amplification and polymorphism across a
screening panel which was comprised of 29 B. pseudomallei isolates, one B. mallei isolate (ATCC 10399), and one

VNTR screening using universal tail PCR and genotype
analysis
A high throughput five dye Universal Tail amplification
and labeling methodology, developed for use in the low
GC (x = 35%) bacterium B. anthracis [54], was used to
screen the chosen repeat region loci for variation among a
combination of 29 diverse and closely related B. pseudomallei isolates. The optimal Tm for labeling sequences
in B. anthracis is 55°C, however due to the high G-C (x =
68.12%) content of the B. pseudomallei genome, all PCR
reactions were performed at a Tm of 72°C.

The UT PCR labeling protocol provides for fluorescent
labeling of any PCR amplicon with only four universal
fluorescently labeled oligonucleotiodes. The fluorescently
labeled universal primer is complimentary to a universal
tailed primer sequence on the 5' end of the target specific
forward primer (FAM = ACCCAACTGAATAGAGAGC,
NED = ATCGACTGTGTTAGGTCAC, PET = CTGTCCTTACCTCAATCTC and VIC = ACGCACTTGACTTGTCTTC).
This method significantly reduces the cost of initial
screening by not having to order labeled primers for each
locus.
PCR amplifications were performed using MJ Research
96-well DNA engines equipped with hot bonnets (BioRad, Waltham, MA). Reaction volumes equaled 10 μL and
contained the following: 10× Hot Master Taq buffer with
Mg2+ (Brinkmann-Eppendorf, Westbury, New York), 200
μM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), 5 μM tailed primer, 50 μM untailed primer, 50 μM
fluorescently labeled universal primer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1U Hot Master Taq DNA Polymerase (Brinkmann-Eppendorf, Westbury, New York) and
double-distilled H20. After an initial denaturation step at
94°C for 2 min, 30 cycles of touchdown PCR were performed (denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing for 30
sec with an 0.5°C/cycle decrement at 72°C, and an extension at 72°C for 30 sec) followed by 20 cycles of regular
PCR (94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec),
followed by a final extension step for 5 min at 72°C. Negative controls, containing all the components except DNA
templates, were included in parallel. PCR samples were
stored at -20°C until genotyped.
PCR amplicons were diluted with double-distilled H20
based upon their universal tail sequence (FAM and NED

1:50, PET 1:10 and VIC 1:5) and mixed in equal amounts
to provide relatively equal fluorescent signals from each
locus during subsequent electrophoresis on an Applied
Biosystems 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Size polymorphisms were subsequently
analyzed and scored using GeneScan and Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
MLVA PCR and genotype analysis
Primers for 32 polymorphic VNTR loci were redesigned
with fluorescently labeled forward primers, and optimized for 11 multiplex PCR reactions across B. mallei
ATCC 10399 and the 14 globally diverse B. pseudomallei
isolates used in the initial screening panel (Table 4). These
isolates were chosen to increase future amplification success across an array of genetically diverse isolates. MLVA
reaction primers (Table 2) were designed to provide
uniquely labeled or sized amplicons for every allele at all
32 VNTR loci. PCR amplification of all loci was routinely
accomplished using 11 reactions, which were pooled into
nine electrophoretic runs.

All reactions contained a final concentration of 1× PCR
buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.08 units Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), 1.2 M Betaine (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St.
Louis, MO), double-distilled H20, 1 μL of template DNA
(~100 pg/μL) and the appropriate primer concentrations
for each multiplex PCR (Table 1) for a total volume of 10
μL. Thirteen VNTR loci required the inclusion of a nonfluorescently labeled forward primer in order to decrease
the amount of fluorescent amplicon, and thus obtain relatively equal fluorescent signals from each amplicon in
the multiplex mix (Table 2). In cases where low DNA
quantity affected multiplex PCR results, loci were amplified individually using the same concentrations above
and 0.2 μM of both forward and reverse primers.
All PCR reactions were performed in MJ Research 96-well
DNA engines equipped with hot bonnets (Bio-Rad,
Waltham, MA). PCR reactions underwent an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of PCR were performed (denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing for 30
sec at 68°C, and an extension at 72°C for 30 sec) followed
by a final extension step for 5 min at 72°C. Negative controls, containing all the components except DNA templates, were included in parallel. PCR samples were stored
at -20°C until genotyped.
PCR products for all multiplex mixes were diluted 1:100
with double-distilled H20 and then mixed 1:1 with a 3:1
ratio of formamide to NAU Liz 1007 fluorescently labeled
size standard. The PCR products were electrophorectically
analyzed with an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA
sequencer (Foster City, CA). Amplicons were scored using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/23

the ABI software program GeneMapper and genotyped
according to predetermined allele sizes. An independent
party has verified all sizes presented.
Mutation rate determination
A parallel serial passage experiment used to determine
VNTR mutation rates began with a single isolated colony
of the Bp9905-1902 strain (T = 0). Bp9905-1902 was a
human clinical isolate obtained from the Arizona Department of Health. This colony was dispersed in nutrient
broth and then used to start 95 independent clonal lineages by streaking for single colonies on 24 quartered
plates. Each lineage was then serially passed 10 times over
a 10 day period by streaking a single colony from the previous passage. DNA was extracted from all 95 T = 10 lineages by using an in-house phenol chloroform extraction
protocol. PCR for each locus was performed using the universal tail VNTR screening method described above. Mutational events were then visualized using GeneMapper
software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Using viable plate counts, the number of generations (doublings)
per colony was determined to be ~19.93 (log2 of the average colony size in cells), which corresponded to a total of
1.81 × 104 generations in the entire experiment (19.93
generations/colony × 10 passages × 91.03 average analyzed lineages/marker), allowing the detection of mutation rates of 10 -4 or greater (Table 1). For estimation of
cell doubling see discussion and supplemental information in Girard and Wagner et al. [26,24].
Statistical analyses
Data from 23 loci that displayed greater than 85% amplification success were used to generate an arbitrarily rooted
distance-based phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor Joining algorithm in PAUP 4.0 b10 [55]. In order to estimate
confidence levels for the analysis, a full heuristic bootstrapping analysis was conducted using a random generator seed for 2000 replicates. Individual marker diversity
(D) was calculated as equal to 1-∑ (allele frequency)2 and
based solely upon allele frequencies in the 87 isolates
shown here (Table 1). A χ2 goodness-of-fit test was performed in 10 Kb intervals in order to examine the
observed distribution against an expected Poisson distribution for both the large and small chromosomes.
