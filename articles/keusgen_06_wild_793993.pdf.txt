Abstract
Background: Hitherto available sources from literature mentioned several wild growing Allium
species as "edible" or "medicinally used" but without any further specification.
Methods: New data were gained during recent research missions: Allium plants were collected and
shown to the local population which was asked for names and usage of these plants.
Results: Information was collected about current medical applications of sixteen wild species, nine
of which belong to different sections of Allium subgenus Melanocrommyum. These plants are used
against headache, cold, and stomach problems, and are mostly applied fresh or after boiling.
Conclusion: Close taxonomic relatives of the common onion were used similar to cultivated
onion species, but medical use like garlic was mostly reported for species taxonomically not related
to garlic.

Background
About 200 different Allium species were reported for the
mountainous regions of Middle and South-West Asia [1].
The use of especially tasteful and curative members of this
family has a long tradition in several Asian populations
with apparently deep historical roots. This assumption
might be illustrated by the fact that also people living in
urban areas since generations know how to prepare special dishes from particular plants. They are buying the
required plant material at local markets where it is sold by
rural providers which collected it in the wild. Also ancient
reports about common onion (Allium cepa L.) and garlic

(A. sativum L.) are coming out of this area bearing antique
civilizations. While wild ancestors of the worldwide most
important cultivated Allium species could not be identified yet without doubt, genetically and phylogenetically
most closely related plants are exclusively distributed in
this part of Asia [2].
The economically most important Allium crop species
(common onion and garlic) are worldwide used as spices,
vegetables, and medicinal plants. Traditionally, they play
a very important role in the daily diet also in Asia. Here
they can be seen under cultivation in every home garden.

Figure 1
Sample figure title
Sample figure title. Young plants of common onion are frequently eaten as greens and sold on nearly every local market
(photo taken in Dushanbe, Tajikistan).

This holds also true for the territories of Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan where young fresh plants (Fig. 1) and dry
bulbs are offered at every local market and are generally
also used as medicinal plants. A rather recent review [3]
described the wide spectrum of medical properties of both
crop species.
Besides theses two cultivated species, also a number of
wild species are collected and eaten by the local population [4] but separate references to medical applications
are rarely given [5,6]. Most literature sources mention
only that particular species were eaten, emit a characteristic smell like onion or garlic, or are used as spice or medicinal plants without presenting further details. Sometimes
the use of wild Allium species is described as 'used as common onion'. Again, this description is very diffuse und
means, that some parts of the plant can be either used as
vegetable, spice, or herbal drug. Also a differentiation
between true vegetable plants and spicy vegetables (e.g.,
leek A. porrum L. in Europe and North America) is rarely
given.
Detailed information is not even supplied for widely used
species. An exception is the dissertation of Umarov [7]. In
Tajikistan and in some parts of neighbouring countries
where related tribes settled, leaves of A. rosenbachianum
auct. – this name is used in some scientific literature for A.
rosenbachianum (Fig. 2) in a strict sense as well as for A.
rosenorum (Fig. 3) – are extensively used for traditional
dishes. According to literature [8,9], this species is applied

as spice and as vegetable as ingredient of soups. In the
1980ies during botanical expeditions, one of the authors
(RMF) was repeatedly informed by local people that these
leaves, which do not own any special taste, are often collected and eaten because consumption "refreshes the
body after the winter period". Thus, the reported use as
spice needs confirmation or exclusion.
Another example for confusing reports in literature is
related to A. stipitatum. Information about the use of this
species is in accordance for both countries that only young
bulbs were pickled and highly esteemed as spicy vegetable
[6,10]. A medicinal use was not reported yet but could not
be surely excluded. Wild species listed above can be
obtained at local markets throughout.
Sensoric properties as well as health benefits of Allium species can be related to a broad variety of secondary metabolites of these plants. Most important are sulphur
compounds, which are typically alk(en)yl sulphoxides of
the amino acid cysteine. If plant material is damaged, the
enzyme alliinase comes in contact with cysteine sulphoxides like methiin, alliin, isoalliin, and propiin, and a
broad variety of biologically active compounds is formed
[3]. Variations in the combination and concentration of
enzymatically formed sulphur compounds result in species- and group-specific taste and smell. Also the health
benefit of Allium species can be deduced from sulphur
components. If the concentration of sulphur compounds
is rather low, species were often used as vegetable giving a

very mild taste after cocking. Species with a high sulphur
content like garlic were mainly used as spice and/or
medicinal plant.

collecting new data, which follows another strategy to
minimize error sources. The currently available results are
presented below.

Besides sulphur compounds, also saponins were reported
for a number of Allium species and may also contribute to
the health benefits of these plants [3]. Sugars, typically
fructose, are responsible for the sweet taste of a number of
Allium species, mostly related to A. cepa. Moreover, phenolic compounds were detected in this genus and must be
considered as bioactive compounds, too.

Methods

Not one of these publications mentioned in Table 1 gives
any reference about the scientific background of the data
and presented vouchers (photographs, herbarium specimens, or other stored material) or described identification
of the plants. Therefore, a research project was initiated for

Information was gained during joined research missions
with the local cooperation partners in 2003, 2004, and
2005. In the areas of interest, at first fresh plant material
was collected and then shown to the native population of
this region (mountainous areas of the Republics of
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, mainly belonging to the Hissar
mountain range and the Pamir). Because of strict ethnological rules, only male person were asked, but these often
showed plant material to further members of the family,
also female persons. People were interviewed in their
native language. Because of significant migrations during
the time of the former Soviet Union, results were not

related to specific ethnological sub-populations. Also,
results were not related to the age of interviewed persons,
but in most cases they had an age of about 50 to 60 years
and were often recommended by rural communities as
experts for traditionally used plants. People were asked
about the local name and whether they are using these
plants, and if so, which part is taken, for what purpose,
and how is it prepared and stored.
Afterwards, the presented plant material was transferred
to the national living Allium collections of Tajikistan in
Dushanbe (curator: Prof. Dr. H. Hisoriev, accessions
beginning with '6'), or of Uzbekistan in Tashkent (curator:
Dr. F. Khassanov, accessions beginning with '4'), resp., for

further cultivation, documentation, and taxonomic determination. In Tashkent and Dushanbe also voucher specimens of the accessions are deposited. Duplicates of some
accessions were also transferred to the Taxonomic Allium
Reference Collection of the Institute of Plant Genetics and
Crop Plant Research (IPK), Gatersleben, Germany, to be
re-determined if necessary. All data concerning collecting,
cultivation, and questioning the native population were
assembled in an electronic database.
If possible, results from interviews were compared with
data available from literature as indicated in Table 1. It
must be noticed, that most literature data do lack an
unambiguous botanical description of plant material.

Discussion
Results
The obtained data confirm that a remarkable number of
wild Allium species is collected for consumption by Uzbek
and Tajik people. Inside the visited countries, no further
differentiation into ethnic groups was done. Several species are only used as vegetable and/or spice plants. They
have special importance in rural areas during springtime
when vegetables cannot be bought in the shops or are too
expensive, and the garden plots do not give yield yet. Such
species will be not considered here, because investigations
are ongoing. Other wild Allium species are eaten due to a

Three wild Allium species growing in Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan (A. oschaninii, A. pskemense, A. praemixtum) are
closely related to common onion. They are traditionally
collected and used as spice like common onion, but only
A. oschaninii and A. pskemense are also medicinally
applied. Thus, we can confirm reports about the use of A.
oschaninii in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan [4,6,8,10]. We can
also verify that A. pskemense is sometimes grown in home
gardens in Uzbekistan (Fig. 4) for usage like common
onion and as medicinal plant.

Another sample figure title. Allium pskemense (left) and common onion (right) are jointly grown in a home garden near
Tashkent (Uzbekistan).

Although the only species of subgenus Allium mentioned
in Tab. 1 (A. filidens) is taxonomically rather distantly
related to garlic, but it is medically used in a similar manner. This kind of medical applications also holds true for
two species from the rhizomatous section Campanulata
and for four species from the bulbous subgenus
Melanocrommyum. This usage is apparently not strictly
related to the content of the cysteine sulphoxide alliin
('mother compound' of the active principle), which is
high in garlic, A. filidens, A. barsczewskii, and A. jodanthum,
but very low in the species of subgenus Melanocrommyum
shown in Tab. 1 [11]. Further studies will show whether
other related compounds not determined yet or completely different chemical compounds might be the reason for this usage.

Allium komarowii (Fig. 5) owns obviously a rather strong
medical activity, because it is used as anabolic drug for
horses [12]. Also this kind of activity could not be correlated to high cysteine sulphoxide contents [11], but this
species contains a conspicuous red dye, which is chemically a sulphurpyrrol [13]. The purified substance showed
a strong antioxidative effect but contribution to the health
benefit of the entire plant is not clear until now.
Special dishes, which are much esteemed for strong tonic
properties, are prepared from the leaves of three species of
the subgenus Melanocrommyum: A. motor, A. rosenbachianum, and A. rosenorum. According to our information,
these dishes are explicitly consumed because of the tonic
property. Also these plants contain the above mentioned

contain only traces of cysteine sulphoxides [11]. Thus, we
must conclude that other substances must be responsible
for the differing usages also in this case.
Application against scurvy was only reported in the literature for A. talassicum and is not confirmed by own data. It
can be assumed that this disease has lost importance
because of a better general diet and availability of modern
pharmaceuticals for treatment.
The wild Allium species listed above are mainly applied
fresh or after boiling of mostly dried material (Tab. 1).
Fumigation (A. fedschenkoanum) and alcoholic extraction
(A. jodanthum) were only once reported.
In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, most of the wild species
shown in Tab. 1 are not simply used instead of common
onion and garlic, but are very specifically applied. This
fact may illustrate that collection and application of wild
Allium species reflects an apparently rather ancient tradition. Several people interviewed during our expeditions
underlined that often a certain plant is used by only a part
of population living in a specific area, or when commonly
applied species are missing in this area. The knowledge of
wild Allium species was also not observed throughout a
local population. Some persons questioned even did
know nothing about any wild Allium species.
Because the interviews were not always successful and our
research missions did not cover the whole territories of
both countries, the presented data may only incompletely
reflect the existing knowledge in Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, we were able to find evidence
that several Allium species mentioned in literature as "edible plants" without detailed specification were utilized for
medical applications. Certainly some more edible wild
Allium species than mentioned in Tab. 1 are also medically applied. Additional investigations seem to be essentially necessary.

as medicine. However, young bulbs of A. suworowii are
