Abstract
Background: The genus Mantella, endemic poison frogs of Madagascar with 16 described species,
are known in the field of international pet trade and entered under the CITES control for the last
four years. The phylogeny and phylogeography of this genus have been recently subject of study for
conservation purposes. Here we report on the studies of the phylogeography of the Mantella
cowani group using a fragment of 453 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 195
individuals from 21 localities. This group is represented by five forms: M. cowani, a critically
endangered species, a vulnerable species, M. haraldmeieri, and the non-threatened M. baroni, M. aff.
baroni, and M. nigricans.
Results: The Bayesian phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses revealed the presence of
three separated haplotype clades: (1) M. baroni, M. aff. baroni, M. nigricans, and putative hybrids of
M. cowani and M. baroni, (2) M. cowani and putative hybrids of M. cowani and M. baroni, and (3) M.
haraldmeieri. The putative hybrids were collected from sites where M. cowani and M. baroni live in
sympatry.
Conclusion: These results suggest (a) a probable hybridization between M. cowani and M. baroni,
(b) a lack of genetic differentiation between M. baroni/M. aff. baroni and M. nigricans, (c) evidence of
recent gene-flow between the northern (M. nigricans), eastern (M. baroni), and south-eastern (M.
aff. baroni) forms of distinct coloration, and (d) the existence of at least three units for conservation
in the Mantella cowani group.

Background
Madagascar, the fourth largest island of the world, is a

hotspot for biodiversity that deserves the highest priority
for conservation [1]. Currently, 233 amphibian species

Frontiers in Zoology 2007, 4:1

are known from this island [2]. All of the native taxa are
endemic at the level of species, and all but one also at the
level of genera [3-5]. Madagascar has so far been spared
from one of the causes of the global decline of amphibians [5], the diseases due to dangerous pathogens, especially chytrid fungal infections [6-8]. However, the island
is not safe from range contractions and extinctions due to
habitat destruction and overexploitation of live specimens for the pet trade [5,9-14].
The poison frogs from Madagascar, Mantella, form one of
the Malagasy endemic genera of amphibians. This genus
contains 16 described species divided into six groups
based on morphological and genetic criteria [15]. The
genus holds the record in terms of Malagasy amphibians
present in the pet trade (>230,000 individuals over 10
years 1994–2003) [16]. Species of Mantella are now
included in the appendix II of the Convention on the
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and
the commerce is thereby better regulated [16].
Genetic analyses to understand phylogeny and phylogeography of the genus Mantella, to solve problems in taxonomy, and to provide a basis for conservation actions to
better protect species belonging to this genus are recent
and are leading to more and more surprising new discoveries. Initial allozyme studies of a restricted number of
taxa unveiled the existence of three lineages among the
species from central-eastern rainforests: (1) Mantella
baroni and M. cowani, (2) M. madagascariensis and M. pulchra, and (3) M. aurantiaca, M. crocea and M. milotympanum [17], and led to a revised classification of the genus
[15]. The use of karyological methods provided some
additional hints on the phylogeny of the genus [18], but
it were mainly recent studies based on molecular analyses
using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences that
provided progressively more precise information. In
2002, the use of the 16S rRNA marker in an attempt to
elucidate the origin and evolution of the aposematic coloration of frogs in this genus permitted to find clades
largely congruent [19] with the species groups defined by
Vences et al. [15,17]: the Mantella madagascariensis group
(M. aurantiaca, M. crocea, M. madagascariensis, M. milotympanum, M. pulchra), the Mantella cowani group (M. baroni,
M. cowani, M. haraldmeieri, M. nigricans), the Mantella
bernhardi group (M. bernhardi), the Mantella betsileo group
(M. betsileo, M. sp. aff. betsileo, M. expectata, M. viridis) and
the Mantella laevigata group (M. laevigata). Later, in 2004,
the use of four different genetic markers (16S rRNA, 12S
rRNA, cytochrome b and rhodopsin) confirmed this species-group division and revealed that M. milotympanum
and M. crocea have a high degree of mitochondrial haplotype sharing, confirming doubts about the species validity
of M. milotympanum and indicating independent evolution of bright orange pattern in M. milotympanum and M.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1742-9994/4/1

aurantiaca [20]. Chiari et al. in 2004 [21] then used
nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b, Rag-1 and Rag-2) to investigate the evolution of
coloration and the phylogeographic relationships of the
species belonging to the Mantella madagascariensis group.
This study strongly confirmed the existence of haplotype
sharing between M. milotympanum and M. crocea and gave
new insights into the phylogenetic relationships of the
genus Mantella. Sequences of cytochrome b were also used
to study the phylogeography of M. bernhardi and revealed
two distinct clades corresponding to geographically isolated populations [22].
Besides the Mantella madagascariensis and M. bernhardi
groups, phylogeographic studies have also been carried
out on the M. cowani group [23]. This group is likely to be
monophyletic [19,20] and includes five species according
to Vences et al. (1999) [15]: M. cowani, which is listed in
the IUCN Red List as critically endangered due to small
range distribution and anthropogenic pressure [5,14,15],
M. baroni and M. nigricans, both non threatened species,
M. haraldmeieri, a vulnerable species from the extreme
south-east, and Mantella sp. aff. baroni from the southeastern Andringitra region which has been recognized as
possibly distinct form by Vences et al. [15] but not formally named. Members of the M. cowani group are characterized by light (mostly yellow or red) flank blotches of
variable extension (also found in M. madagascariensis
group and M. bernhardi) and single click calls (exclusive to
this group).
Cytochrome b-based phylogeographic data by Chiari et al.
[23] were limited to two of these five species: Mantella
cowani and M. baroni. Sequences of these two species
formed separate haplotype networks, with haplotype
sharing at one locality of their sympatric occurrence. Most
intriguing, and strongly deviating from patterns found for
instance in Mantella bernhardi [22], within both mitochondrial networks, specimens from different localities
shared identical haplotypes, even those from the most distant sample sites of M. baroni; although most populations
were characterized by a rather high haplotype diversity, no
haplotype clades exclusive to geographical regions were
observed.
In the present study, we provide a phylogeographic analyses that extends to all five species of the Mantella cowani
group as recognized by Vences et al. [15]. We provide the
first population-level molecular data of Mantella sp. aff.
baroni, M. haraldmeieri and M. nigricans, and add numerous additional specimens and localities for M. baroni and
M. cowani (figure 1; Table 1). Our results corroborate the
status of M. cowani and M. haraldmeieri as distinct evolutionary lineages. However, the new data provide no evidence for differentiation among M. baroni, M. sp. aff.

baroni and M. nigricans and no genetic signature of geographic differentiation within these forms, providing the
first evidence for an amphibian with ongoing or recent
gene flow between populations occurring across most of
Madagascar's eastern rainforests.

Results
The total dataset consisted of 195 individual sequences of
453 bp that were distributed among 82 distinct haplotypes (of which 70 unique to single individuals) divided
into three separated haplotype networks (figure 2). One
network with 68 haplotypes (Mbn1 – Mbn68) from a
total of 145 individuals includes sequences of M. nigricans, M. baroni, and M. aff. baroni, plus three putative
hybrids between M. baroni and M. cowani. The second network includes eleven haplotypes (Mc1 – Mc11) from 44
individuals belonging to Mantella cowani, and from five
putative hybrids between M. baroni and M. cowani. The
third haplotype network includes three haplotypes (Mh1–
Mh3) from six individuals, all belonging to Mantella haraldmeieri. Connecting the separate networks required distances of, respectively, 14, 16 and 26 steps between the
first and second, first and third, and second and third networks. The M. baroni-nigricans network shows one common haplotype (Mbn1; frequency = 36%) including
specimens of M. baroni and M. nigricans from all localities
except Mantady (Table 2). Two individuals of M. cowani
(two "putative hybrids") from Farimazava were also
included in this haplotype network differing from the
most common haplotype (Mbn1) by one and two mutations. Three out of seven individuals of M. nigricans from
Marojejy and one out of five of M. nigricans from
Andranomenabe share the common haplotype Mbn1.
The maximum distance of M. nigricans noticed from this
common haplotype is four mutations. The second network includes individuals of M. cowani (and putative
hybrids between this species and M. baroni) with one
common haplotype (Mc1; frequency = 65%). The individuals of M. cowani included in this network were representative of all the sampled localities, while it also contains
one specimen initially identified as M. baroni from SouthAmpasimpotsy and three M. baroni from Farimazava.
Hence, these four individuals of M. baroni are to be considered as a posteriori hybrids (cf. definitions in [23]). The
M. haraldmeieri (mh) network is separated from all other
species and no indication for hybridization of this with
any other species was detected.
The partitioned and non-partitioned Bayesian analyses
gave a consensus tree in which three clades were recovered
(not shown). One internally paraphyletic clade, supported by 36% posterior probability for the non partitioned analyses and 72% for the partitioned analyses,
included individuals of Mantella baroni, M. aff. baroni, M.
cowani/baroni hybrids, and Mantella nigricans, with inter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1742-9994/4/1

nal nodes supported by low posterior probability. Monophyletic groups containing all specimens of Mantella
cowani and M. haraldmeieri, respectively, were recovered
(with some hybrid specimens of M. baroni in the M. cowani clade) as monophyletic groups supported by 100%
posterior probabilities, but these clades were nested
within a clade containing sequences of M. baroni and M.
nigricans.

Discussion
The cytochrome b marker has been shown to be a good
marker to identify species and hybridization phenomena
[24] and to highlight genetically isolated populations
[22]. Our results using the cytochrome b marker confirm
the results of Chiari et al. [23] on the probable hybridization between M. cowani and M. baroni which, however, in
general appear to be well separated species by morphology and ecology [15,23], with an uncorrected pairwise
distance of about 3.5% among most of their cytochrome
b haplotypes, and a clustering of these haplotypes in two
unconnected networks. This distance appears to be in a
similar order of magnitude as that between other closely
related Mantella species, e.g., M. aurantiaca, M. crocea and
M. madagascariensis (4.5–5.3%[20]).
However, the situation may be different in the case of M.
baroni, M. sp. aff. baroni from Andringitra, and M. nigricans. The cytochrome b sequences used here were unable
to provide any indication of genetic differentiation
between these three forms, which indeed all share their
most common haplotype. The structure of network 1 in
figure 2 suggests that there is a high level of gene flow
between these three forms. An example is offered by specimens of M. nigricans from Andranomenabe and M. baroni
from Vohiparara, which shared one haplotype (Mbn3; see
Table 2 and figure 2), in addition to the common haplotype Mbn1 that is present in all localities in these taxa.
The haplotypes sequenced from individuals of M. aff.
baroni from Andringitra (Korokoto) do not present any
significant differentiation from the most common haplotype Mbn1 in the M. baroni/nigricans network (maximum
1 mutation). This indicates that despite the larger extent of
yellow colour in these specimens [15], they are not likely
to represent a distinct taxonomical unit.
Mantella baroni and M. nigricans show very constant differences in colour pattern, such as the total absence of red or
orange colour on the hind limbs of M. nigricans. The localities of these two taxa that were sampled in the present
study are totally separated (with a minimum distance of
more than 400 km from each other) which excludes a scenario of occasional hybridization. The occurrence of specimens possibly intermediate between M. nigricans and M.
baroni from Folohy and from the Zahamena Reserve,

within the sampling gap of our study, was mentioned by
Vences et al. [15], but the available specimens from
voucher collections had largely faded colour patterns and
could not be attributed to either species with certainty.
The contact zone of these two forms could be around
these sites but more sampling in the vast area between
Masoala and Moramanga is suggested to better resolve
this question.

green or yellowish colour on the dorsum) is also observed
[15], confirming that in some cases conspecific Mantella
specimens may bear different colour patterns. However,
we propose not to formalize these taxonomic changes
before they are confirmed by analyses of nuclear markers,
and before a more stable and complete framework of
Mantella systematics can emerge from a comprehensive
analyses.

However, in general terms, the absence of a geographical
structure in the haplotype differentiation of the M. baroni/
M. nigricans complex over its distribution area indicates
that these frogs have colonized their entire range very
recently, and/or that gene flow between their populations
is an ongoing or at least very recent phenomenon. In turn,
the data would favour the hypothesis that chromatic differences between M. nigricans and M. baroni may have
evolved by disruptive selective pressures and not just by
genetic drift in the context of historical barriers to gene
flow between a northern and southern population group,
although such barriers may have evaded the resolution of
our mitochondrial analyses if they had been too recent
(post-Pleistocene) in age.

In terms of conservation, M. baroni, M. sp. aff. baroni and
M. nigricans could be seen as a single unit of conservation
based on the mitochondrial marker we used. However, it
is necessary to consider the chromatic differences (of possible adaptive value) before issuing precise recommendations. In fact, different populations (or in this case
different colour forms) within a species could justify specific conservation measures to preserve their genetic, ecological, and/or morphological diversity. Different
definitions of conservation units have been proposed
according to the parameters used to define them. From an
initially broader concept of evolutionary significant unit
(ESU) including ecological and genetic data, a more
molecular based concept is currently mostly used (see Box
1 in [25]). However, since no ESU concepts can universally be applied, a more comprehensive adaptive evolutionary conservation (AEC) concept has been proposed
[26]. The aim of the AEC concept is to preserve the evolutionary potential, thus the adaptive variance within a species (indicated under the AEC concept as ecological and or
morphological as well as genetic differences) [26], which

Taxonomically, our results suggest that M. nigricans may
be best seen as the northern colour morph of M. baroni,
similar to Mantella crocea and M. milotympanum [21].
Indeed, in Mantella nigricans and M. sp. aff. baroni, a certain chromatic differentiation between individuals of the
same population (mainly regarding the extent of brown,

might be applicable to the three forms currently defined
as M. baroni, M. nigricans and M. aff. baroni (from Andringitra).
The hybridization mentioned in Chiari et al. [23] between
M. baroni and M. cowani is confirmed by our study, with a
slightly shorter cytochrome b fragment but using more
samples. Hybridization is a recognized phenomenon in
amphibians as mentioned by numerous authors [27-29].
However, the use of nuclear marker is necessary to clearly
assess the presence of hybridization between the two
above mentioned species and exclude the alternative scenario of ancient haplotype sharing by incomplete lineage
sorting. The present study extends records of hybridization between these two species to the locality of South
Ampasimpotsy, very close to Farimazava where this phenomenon has been recorded before [23]. At these sites,
the hybridization detectable at the mitochondrial level
appears to affect up to 10% of the population of M. cowani. As observed by Andreone et al. [5], M. cowani deserves
a special attention in terms of conservation strategy.
Before 2004 this species provided a non negligible income
for the pet trade [5,16]. For this purpose, we suggest: (1)
in situ breeding programs, where parts of the original habitat are protected and promoted to stabilize the populations and in the long term possibly allow a sustainable
harvesting, as described by Vines et al. [28] and (2) the

constitution of new protected areas as mentioned in Chiari et al. [23].
The isolated network 3 shown in figure 2, with distances
of respectively 14 and 26 mutations to M. baroni/nigricans
and M. cowani, confirms that M. haraldmeieri is a separated
unit both for considerations of taxonomy and conservation.
In conclusion, the cytochrome b data presented here,
referring to a mitochondrial gene inherited maternally,
alone do not provide a fully conclusive resolution of the
taxonomy and evolutionary history of the Mantella cowani
group. However, several important new conclusions can
be drawn: (a) In the group, there are three main lineages,
corresponding to M. cowani, M. haraldmeieri, and M.
baroni/aff. baroni/nigricans, and probably these three lineages should be considered each as species in a future
revised classification, (b) in the M. baroni/aff. baroni/nigricans lineage, ongoing or recent gene flow, or a very recent
colonization history, led to the absence of geographic
structure in the haplotype distributions, with the most
common haplotype Mbn1 being universally present in
populations that are almost 1000 km apart. Future studies
should focus on the inclusion of nuclear markers and on
closing the geographic gaps between the populations of

antantely, to be meaningfully able to apply formal tests of
phylogeographic scenarios.

Methods
Sampling
Samples were collected from July 2003 to April 2004 at
eleven localities and included all the four nominal species
of the Mantella cowani group as well as M. sp. aff. baroni
from Andringitra as defined by Vences et al. [15]. Tissues
of many individuals were obtained by toe clipping, a
method that is known to allow high survival rates for the
released individuals (>98%) [30]. Samples were preserved
in 99% ethanol. Representative specimens from the new
localities were collected and preserved as voucher specimen in the collection of the Département de Biologie Animale of the Faculty of Sciences of Antananarivo, partly
after skinning them for analyses of alkaloids; from these
specimens, larger tissue samples of femur muscle were
taken. The newly collected samples (season 2003–2004)
came from two localities of M. nigricans, one locality of M.
haraldmeieri, seven localities of Mantella baroni and one
locality where M. baroni and M. cowani live in sympatry
(Table 1). Among the new collecting sites, only one (Farimazava) had already been sampled before [23]; three
additional sequences of M. cowani are here added from
this locality.

The new sequences were combined with sequences from a
previous study [23] corresponding to individuals from
twelve populations: four populations of M. cowani and
eight populations of M. baroni with the one locality (Farimazava) of sympatry. As in Chiari et al. [23], two putative
hybrids between M. cowani and M. baroni were included in
our study, defined as individuals with an orange-yellowish coloration, more extended lateral spots (versus small
and rounded spots in M. cowani), residual of cephalic
lines (clearly delimited in M. baroni and lacking in M. cowani) and presence of yellowish shading on tibiae (versus
red bands in M. cowani and black-orange patterned tibiae
in M. baroni. Table 1 summarizes the localities, the species
and the sample size of each species used in this study. The
map of the localities of each species is presented in figure
1.
Laboratory techniques
Total genomic DNA was extracted from the tissue samples
or toe clips using proteinase K digestion (1 mg/ml concentration) followed by a standard salt extraction protocol
[31]. We used the primers Cytb-c 5'-CTACTGGTTGTCCTCCGATTCATGT-3' (forward) and CBJ10933 5'-TATGTTCTACCATGAGGACAAATATC-3' (reverse) [32] to
amplify one part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
of about 600 bp. PCRs were performed in 25.6 μl reactions using 1 μl of genomic DNA, 0.8 μl of each 10 μmol
primer, 2 μl of total dNTP 4 mM, 1 μl additional 25 mmol

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1742-9994/4/1

MgCl2, 2.5 μl 10× NH4 superTaq PCR buffer (HT Biotechnology), 0.25 μl of 5 u/μl iTaq DNA Polymerase (HT Biotechnology) and 17.25 μl of water. PCR conditions were
performed with an initial denaturation step at 94°C for
90 seconds; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing
temperature of 53°C for 45 seconds followed by 30 seconds at 72°C; and a final extension of 10:00 min at 72°C.
PCR products were loaded on 1% agarose gels, stained
with ethidium bromide, and visualised on a "Gel Doc"
system (Syngene). Products were purified using QIAquick
spin columns (Qiagen) prior to cycle sequencing. A 10 μl
sequencing reaction included 1 μl of template, 1.75 μl of
5× sequencing buffer (BigDye Terminator Sequencing
buffer, Applied Biosystems), 1 μl of 10 μmol primer
(Cytb-c or CBJ), 0.5 μl of ABI sequence mix (BigDye Terminator V1.1 Sequencing Standard, Applied Biosystems)
and 5.75 μl of water. The sequence reaction was performed as follows: 3:00 min preheating at 90°C, 24 cycles
of 30 seconds at 96°C, 15 seconds at 50°C and 4:00 min
at 60°C, final extension 4 min at 60°C. Sequence data collection and visualisation were performed on an ABI 3100
or an ABI 3730 automated sequencer at the sequencing
facility of the Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam.
Analysis techniques
The sequences were checked and aligned using the software Sequence Navigator (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers DQ889341–DQ889429). The program Collapse v3.1
[33] was used to merge sequences into haplotypes. Modeltest version 3.7 [34,35] was used in conjunction with
PAUP*, version 4.0b10 [37] to estimate the best fitting
models for our complete dataset and for each partition
corresponding to the different codon positions of the
cytochrome b gene. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the following models of sequence evolution
were determined: (1) for the first codon positions, a TrNef
model with a proportion of invariable sites of 0 and equal
rates for all sites; (2) for the second codon positions, a F81
model with a proportion of invariable sites of 0 and equal
rates for all sites; (3) for the third codon position, a GTR
model with a proportion of invariable sites of 0 and equal
rates for all sites; (4) for the complete dataset, a GTR
model with a proportion of invariable sites of 0 and variable sites distributed according to a gamma distribution
shape parameter of 0.3438. Bayesian phylogenetic inference using the program MrBayes 3.1.1. [36] was carried
out with substitution settings adjusted according to these
substitution models, and with four chains with the default
heating values, 1,000,000 generations, saving the tree at
every tenth generation and discarding the initial 10,000
trees as burn-in. We ran both partitioned and non partitioned analyses, both of which yielded almost identical
results. Mantella aurantiaca was used as the outgroup.

Haplotype networks were constructed using the TCS software package [38], which employs the method of Templeton et al. [39]. It calculates the number of mutational
steps by which pairwise haplotypes differ and computes
the probability of parsimony [39] for pairwise differences
until the probability exceeds 0.95.
