Abstract
Background: Hsp-90 from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is unique in that it fails
to bind to the specific Hsp-90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA). Here we surveyed 24 different freeliving or parasitic nematodes with the aim of determining whether C. elegans Hsp-90 was the
exception or the norm amongst the nematodes. We combined these data with codon evolution
models in an attempt to identify whether hsp-90 from GA-binding and non-binding species has
evolved under different evolutionary constraints.
Results: We show that GA-binding is associated with life history: free-living nematodes and those
parasitic species with free-living larval stages failed to bind GA. In contrast, obligate parasites and
those worms in which the free-living stage in the environment is enclosed within a resistant egg,
possess a GA-binding Hsp-90. We analysed Hsp-90 sequences from fifteen nematode species to
determine whether nematode hsp-90s have undergone adaptive evolution that influences GAbinding. Our data provide evidence of rapid diversifying selection in the evolution of the hsp-90
gene along three separate lineages, and identified a number of residues showing significant evidence
of adaptive evolution. However, we were unable to prove that the selection observed is correlated
with the ability to bind geldanamycin or not.
Conclusion: Hsp-90 is a multi-functional protein and the rapid evolution of the hsp-90 gene
presumably correlates with other key cellular functions. Factors other than primary amino acid
sequence may influence the ability of Hsp-90 to bind to geldanamycin.

Background
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) is essential in all eukaryotes because of its role in chaperoning proteins such as
kinases, growth factors and other signal transduction proteins [1]. As knock out of hsp-90 is generally lethal, specific
inhibitors have been important for defining the cellular
functions of Hsp-90. Of these, the best characterised is

geldanamycin (GA) a naturally occurring ansamycin compound produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus [2]. The
mode of action of GA is well documented and the crystal
structure of yeast Hsp-90 complexed to GA has been
solved [3]. Most eukaryotic Hsp-90s are susceptible to
inhibition with GA and will bind the drug in pull-down
assays using GA linked to a solid support [4]. The excep-

tion to this rule is Hsp-90 (DAF-21) from the free-living
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce), which fails to bind
to GA in pull-down assays [5] and which shows no apparent ill-effect when maintained on a lawn of S. hygroscopicus. In contrast GA binds to Hsp-90 from the parasitic
nematode Brugia pahangi (Bp) and is lethal to all life cycle
stages [6]. The inability of Ce-Hsp-90 to bind GA was proposed to represent an example of adaptive evolution, as
both C. elegans and the Streptomyces species that synthesizes GA are soil dwelling and so may share the same ecological niche [5]. In this study we adopted an integrated
approach to investigating the possibility that nematode
hsp-90s may have undergone adaptive evolution that
influences GA-binding. We surveyed Hsp-90 from a range
of free-living or parasitic nematodes for their ability to
bind GA, and combined these data with statistical methods to compare substitution rates using maximum likelihood (ML) models of codon evolution [7,8], in an
attempt to identify if significant evidence for adaptive
diversifying evolution (dN/dS >1) relating to GA-binding
exists. Specifically we investigated whether hsp-90 from
GA-binding nematodes has evolved under differing evolutionary constraints compared to non-GA binding nematode species

While free-living nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis species, often exhibit relatively simple life histories developing from egg to adult in one environment, parasitic
species display a huge diversity in life cycles. Some parasitic species are transmitted direct from host to host and
many of these have a free-living stage within the environment (e.g. the Trichostrongyles), while others, such as the
filarial nematodes are obligate parasites. These worms
have no free-living stages and are transmitted from host to
host by the bite of an infected intermediate host, such as
a mosquito. Likewise, the clade I species Trichinella spiralis is permanently parasitic and transmitted by ingestion
of infected tissue. In this study, we set out to investigate
whether the life history of a species was correlated with
the ability of Hsp-90 to bind GA by analysing an additional twenty-four species of free-living or parasitic nematode, belonging to four of the five clades. These data were
combined with an analysis of hsp-90 DNA sequences
from a range of nematode species, in an attempt to determine whether the hsp-90 genes of GA-binding nematodes
have significantly different ratios of non-synonomous
(amino acid-changing) to synonomous (amino acidretaining) nucleotide substitutions compared to nonbinding species.

Nematodes are an extensive group of animals that have
evolved to colonise most ecological niches. Many nematodes are important parasites of humans, domestic animals and plants and are responsible for considerable
economic losses worldwide [9]. Since the sequencing of
the C. elegans genome, the genomes of several additional
free-living nematodes have been sequenced, including
two other species of Caenorhabditis (briggsae and remanei)
and Pristionchus pacificus [10], a species that associates
with beetles. Draft genome sequences are available for C.
brenneri and japonica, and for the parasitic species
Trichinella spiralis [11], Brugia malayi [12], Haemonchus
contortus http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/H_contortus/
and Meloidogyne hapla [13] and incognita [14], plant parasitic nematodes. Furthermore, sequencing projects are
planned for several other important parasitic species
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/. In addition EST projects have provided an abundance of
sequence information on the phylum [15]. A phylogeny
of the nematodes based on the small subunit ribosomal
DNA sequences has been proposed [16] in which the
nematodes are divided into five clades. Each of these
clades contain parasitic species, suggesting that parasitism
has arisen on multiple occasions during the evolution of
the phylum. C. elegans is grouped in clade V, along with
many important parasites of veterinary significance, while
the filarial nematode Brugia malayi lies in clade III, as do
some important ascarid parasites of humans and animals.

Results
GA pull-down assays
The ability of nematode Hsp-90 to bind to GA was
assessed using a standard pull-down procedure in which
GA bound to a solid support was used to select Hsp-90
from worm extract. The presence of Hsp-90 in the pulldown was assessed by immuno-blotting. Prior to use in
pull-down experiments, extracts of each worm were
probed with an anti-B. pahangi Hsp-90 antibody or with
AC88, a monoclonal antibody to Hsp-90, to confirm that
Hsp-90 could be detected on a blot. Extracts of three species failed to react with either antibody over a range of
antibody concentrations and exposure times: Trichinella
spiralis, Trichuris muris and Anguillicolla crassus. In addition, extracts of adult worms of Haemonchus contortus did
not react with either antibody, despite the inclusion of
hsp-90 sequences in the Haemonchus EST database with
reasonable overlap to the 3' end of Bp-Hsp-90 that was
used to make the antibody [6]. Extracts of adult Haemonchus were prepared in the presence of an additional protease inhibitor (E44) or directly by boiling in SDS-PAGE
sample cocktail. Only when worms were extracted directly
into sample cocktail could Hsp-90 be detected, suggesting
that the aqueous extract may be subject to proteolytic degradation. In contrast, a soluble extract of the L3 stage
reacted well with the Brugia antibody and was used in subsequent pull-down assays.

Nine clade V nematodes were tested in the GA pull-down
assay, five of which were free-living. These included C. ele-

gans N2, C. elegans JT6130, a daf-21 mutant which carries
a point mutation in hsp-90 (E292 to K), conferring a temperature-sensitive dauer-constitutive phenotype [17],
Caenorhabditis briggsae (result not shown), Oscheia tipulae
and Pristionchus pacificus. In addition four parasitic species
were tested: Teladorsagia circumcincta, Nippostrongylus brasilensis, Heligmosomoides polygyrus and H. contortus. Hsp-90
from all clade V species reacted positively with the antiBrugia Hsp-90 antibody (Figure 1, panels a and c), but
none bound to GA in the pull-down assay, whether from
free-living or parasitic species (see Figure 1, panels b and
d). Blots were exposed for extended periods of time but no
positive reaction was observed, while the control B.
pahangi lysate always yielded a strong positive result. A
similar picture was observed with clade IV species, where
Hsp-90 from Strongyloides ratti, two species of the plant
parasite Globodera and the free-living Panagrellus redivivus
all failed to bind GA (data not shown). For clade III nematodes, the situation was more diverse with Hsp-90 from
all five filarial worms tested B. pahangi, Acanthocheilonema
viteae, Dirofilaria immitis, Onchocerca ochengi and Litomosoides sigmondontis (result not shown) binding to GA (Figure 2, panel c). Hsp-90 from three ascarid species
(Toxocara cati, Ascaris suum and Parascaris equorum) also
bound to GA, but Hsp-90 from the related anisakids (Anisakis simplex and Pseudoterranova decipens) did not (Figure
2, panel d, lanes 9 & 10) while A. crassus failed to react
with either antibody (Figure 2 panel c, lane 11). Where a
positive signal was obtained in the pull-down assay,
experiments were repeated in the presence of excess GA to
block free binding sites. In all cases free GA blocked bind-

a

Two species belonging to clade I were tested, T. muris and
T. spiralis but neither reacted with the anti-Hsp-90 antibodies. For these species and for A. crassus, GA pull-down
assays were analysed by Coomassie Blue staining. For T.
spiralis only, the GA pull-down assay revealed a band of
approximately 83 kDa that was not present using control
beads. The binding to GA beads of the protein isolated
from the T. spiralis extract was competed by pre-incubation of the extract with excess free GA. The band was
excised from the gel, digested with trypsin and subjected
to mass spectrometry at the Sir Henry Wellcome Functional Genomics Unit, University of Glasgow. MASCOT
searches revealed multiple peptide hits to Hsp-90 from a
variety of species with a high degree of significance (P <
0.05). Thus T. spiralis Hsp-90 binds to GA, while the GAbinding status of A. crassus and T. muris Hsp-90 remains
uncertain. Table 1 summarises the data from the GA pulldown experiments.
Bioinformatic analysis of nematode hsp-90s
Hsp-90 sequences from a variety of GA-binding and nonbinding species of nematode were either retrieved from
public databases or were cloned and sequenced as
described in Methods. An alignment of the predicted
amino acid sequences is given in supplementary data [see
Additional file 1] and highlights the degree of conservation of Hsp-90, particularly over the N-terminal ATPbinding domain. Table 2 shows the pairwise similarity

analyses described below. Full genomic and cDNA
sequences were available for six species, C. elegans, C.
briggsae, P. pacificus, H. contortus, B. pahangi, and T. spiralis
allowing the comparison of hsp-90 gene structure between
the different species. Exon-intron boundaries were
mapped by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences
and are shown graphically [see Additional file 2]. Three
introns are present in C. elegans and C. briggsae and the
position of each is conserved. These are also perfectly conserved with those of H. contortus (equivalent to introns 1,
5 and 8 of Hc-hsp-90), although here the Hc-hsp-90 gene
contains a total of eight introns. B. pahangi contains the
largest numbers of introns (eleven), the position of three
of which are conserved with H. contortus. A single intron
(number 8 in Hc-hsp-90) is conserved in five of the six species analysed, the exception being T. spiralis.
Identifying sites and lineages subject to adaptive evolution
For the gene-wide analysis, using either set of nested models of codon evolution (M1/M2 or M7/M8) did not identify any evidence of positive selection that was consistent
across the phylogenetic tree (see Table 3). However, using
the branch-sites methods which allow evolutionary rates
to vary across the tree did show some interesting findings.
Three branches showed significant evidence of adaptive
evolution (dN/dS > 1) after Bonferroni correction (see
Figure 3, labelled A, B, C). Along each of these branches,
sites were detected with posterior probabilities > 0.95 of
belonging to a dN/dS > 1 class (see Table 4). Along branch
A (LRT of dN/dS > 1, p < 0.01) a single site 659S was identified (amino acid positions correspond to full length B.
pahangi Hsp-90 AJ005785). On branch B (LRT of dN/dS
> 1, p < 0.05), three sites with dN/dS > 1, 297S, 373S and

464S, were detected. On branch C, nine sites were
detected 21S, 29S, 165V, 312S, 458S, 472Q, 485A, 525S
and 584S. Importantly ten of these thirteen sites are serine
residues which when examined are perfectly or largely
conserved across all species in the alignment [see Additional file 1]. The identification of these ten sites as dN/dS
> 1 results from the serine being encoded by either codons
TCn or AGy. As the codon model of evolution assumes
that mutations within a codon are independent, the
change from TCn-AGy is parsimoniously interpreted as
two separate non-synonymous substitutions (Z. Yang personal communication): e.g. TCC (Ser)->ACC (Thr)->AGC
(Ser). The biological interpretation of these results suggests that the conservation of serine at these positions is
functionally important and that this may be evidence for
divergent evolution with rapid convergence back to the
functionally stable serine residue. However, this cannot
be proven by comparison of the extant species available to
us and these sites are not considered further here. The
remaining codons 165V, 472Q and 485A are inferred to
be evolving rapidly along the lineage separating the plant
parasitic nematodes from the animal parasitic and freeliving species studied (branch C, Figure 3). Site 472Q is
located in the middle region of the Hsp-90 protein and
the codon is a conserved cysteine in the four plant parasitic nematodes and glutamine in all other species tested.
Site 485A is also located in the middle region of the protein and is glutamine in the plant parasitic species and
alanine in all other species. Only a single site, 165V, is predicted to be evolving under positive selection and is also
located in the N terminal GA binding region of Hsp-90.
Site 165V is a valine residue in the GA-binding species (L.
sigmodontis, B. pahangi, A. sum and T. cati) but also in

the non-GA binding P. pacificus and H. contortus. The
residue is a phenylalanine in C. elegans and tyrosine in
other Caenorhabditids analysed. To determine if these
initial findings are consistent with the theory that GAbinding is associated with rapid diversifying evolution of
the hsp-90 gene, we used a modified branch-site approach
[18] to a priori separate the phylogenetic tree into two
groups, GA-binders (B. pahangi, L. sigmodontis, A. suum
and T. cati) vs non-GA-binders. Repeating the branch-sites
analysis failed to provide significant evidence to suggest
that an elevated dN/dS ratio associated with adaptive evolution was present in either of the two groups (see Table
5).

Discussion
The results of our analysis of Hsp-90 from a range of parasitic and free-living nematodes has revealed an interest-

ing heterogeneity in the ability to bind GA. None of the
free-living species tested, nor any of the parasitic species
which have free-living larval stages in the environment
bound to GA. These included animal parasites belonging
to clade IV, such as Strongyloides, and those such as
Haemonchus and Nippostrongylus belonging to clade V.
These parasites are generally gut-dwelling and are transmitted between hosts when eggs, passed out in the faeces
of the infected animal, hatch to release free-living larval
stages. Following a period of development in the environment, the L3 stage infects a new host. The plant parasites
tested, Globodera spp., also failed to bind GA. These are
commonly known as potato cyst nematodes, and live in
the soil where the infective second-stage juvenile worms
(J2) attack the roots of susceptible plants. A cyst containing eggs is formed from the body of the dead female worm
and under appropriate conditions these will hatch to

to feed and eventually develop into adults.
The clade III nematodes analysed produced an interesting
dichotomy in results, containing both GA-binding and
non-binding species. Hsp-90 from the five filarial parasites assayed bound to GA; filarial worms are obligate parasites, transmitted between hosts by the bite of an infected
intermediate host, such as mosquitoes or other arthropods. In keeping with this result, Hsp-90 from another
obligate parasite T. spiralis also bound GA. T. spiralis is a
clade I species commonly transmitted via ingestion of

infected muscle containing the encysted L1 stages. Thus
neither filarial worms nor T. spiralis have free-living stages
in the environment.
The clade III Ascarid parasites also provided an intriguing
comparison, as those worms which bound GA (Toxocara,
Ascaris and Parascaris) all have free-living stages outside
the host, but are enclosed within a thick impermeable eggshell while in the environment. Transmission to the new
host is by ingestion of the egg containing the infective
larva or via a paratenic host (in some species such as Toxocara). Interestingly, in the original report on the isolation

of GA [2], the in vivo efficacy of GA against the mouse pinworm Syphacia obvelata is recorded, suggesting that this
parasite may also express a GA-binding Hsp-90. In keeping with this observation, pinworms belong to clade III
(Oxyuroids) and are transmitted by ingestion of a resistant egg containing the infective larval stage.
Two of the three clade III species associated with the
marine environment (Anisakis and Pseudoterranova) failed
to bind GA. Both parasites have complex life cycles involving one or more intermediate and/or paratenic hosts. The
free-living larval stages are ingested by marine crustaceans, which are then eaten by fish, which are subsequently ingested by marine mammals such as seals
(Pseudoterranova) or cetaceans (Anisakis). A. crassus
belongs to the superfamily Dracunuloidea and parasitises
the swim bladder of eels, but also has a free-swimming
larval stage. As extracts of A. crassus (and T. muris) failed to
react with either antibody, the GA-binding status of these
species remains unresolved. An additional proviso of our
data is that in some cases, larval stages were analysed and
it is possible that larval and adult worms may display different GA-binding characteristics.
Our data suggest that differences in the ability of nematode Hsp-90 to bind to GA are correlated with particular
life histories. Only obligate parasites or those which have
free-living stages in the environment enclosed within a
protective egg-shell possess a GA-binding Hsp-90, while
Hsp-90 from free-living nematodes or from those parasitic species that have free-living larval stages in the environment do not bind GA. The adaptive evolution
hypothesis would argue that organisms sharing the same
niche as the GA-producing Streptomyces should fail to bind
GA and the results from the pull-down experiments

broadly support this hypothesis. In order to further
explore this theory, we analysed hsp-90 sequences from
fifteen different species of nematode in an attempt to
identify codons that have undergone adaptive Darwinian
evolution within the GA-resistant species. The results of
these analyses provided strong evidence for rapid adaptive
evolution along three separate lineages and identified a
number of residues showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution. However, the model suggests that ten of
the thirteen codons identified as sites of adaptive evolution had undergone at least two separate non-synonomous substitutions resulting in the conservation of a
serine residue, implying that these sites may be critical for
Hsp90 function. In mammalian Hsp-90 and , both serine and threonine residues are known to be targets of
phosphorylation [19,20], a modification that is essential
for some functions of Hsp-90 [21,22]. Of the remaining
three residues (165V, 472Q and 485A) showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution (posterior probability
> 0.95 of dN/dS > 1), only a single site, 165V, was located
in the amino terminal section of the Hsp-90 protein,
known to be the position of GA binding. However, variation at this site does not differentiate between GA-binding
and non-GA binding species. The residue is a valine in the
GA binding species, but also in the non-GA binding species P. pacificus and H. contortus. Comparison of the amino
acid sequences of Hsp-90 from GA-binding species and
non-binding species identified only four amino acid positions that are conserved within either the GA-binding or
the non-binding species, but that differ between the
groups. These are: K259 (K GA-binders, T non-binders),
F447 (F GA-binders, Y non-binders), F475 (F GA-binders,
Y non-binders), V624 (V GA-binders, I non-binders) (all
amino acid positions correspond to full length B. pahangi
Hsp-90 [Genbank:AJ005785]). However, none of these

substitutions reside in the N terminal region. Comparison
of each of these positions in Brugia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which binds GA [23], shows that the equivalent
amino acids in yeast are conserved with the non-GA-binding nematode species. Thus whilst evidence for rapid
diversifying selection exists in the evolution of the hsp-90
gene (as evidenced by the significance of the branch-site
tests) and most likely occurred early in nematode divergence, we have been unable to prove with confidence that
the selection seen correlates with a change in the GA-binding function of Hsp-90. As Hsp-90 is a multi-functional
protein in eukaryotic cells, the observed rapid evolution
of the hsp-90 gene likely correlates with some other key
function, rather than the ability to bind GA.
In S. cerevisiae, point mutations in hsp-90 alter the sensitivity to GA and to Radicicol, an alternative inhibitor of Hsp90 function [23]; e.g. A587T and T101I are hypersensitive
to GA, with T22I, G313S and E381K showing a lesser
effect. However, additional factors are also known to
influence sensitivity to GA in yeast, including the presence
of co-chaperones such as Sti1p (mammalian Hop) and
Sba1p (mammalian p23). Yeast deficient in Sti1p or
Sba1p show increased sensitivity to GA [23,24]. C. elegans
expresses homologues of both co-chaperones [25] and a
recent study identified STI-1 as an Hsp-90 interacting protein in C. elegans [26]. However, whether sti-1 null animals have an altered response to GA has yet to be
explored.
While analysis of daf-21 mutants and RNAi studies in C.
elegans clearly show that Hsp-90 is essential in the worm,
C. elegans is not susceptible to GA and, indeed, in the
micro-environment of a Petri dish, can grow perfectly well

when fed on a culture of S. hygroscopicus [5]. However, it
remains unclear whether C. elegans would interact with
the GA-producing S. hygroscopicus in the environment.
Although both organisms may be present in the soil,
whether they share the same spatial and temporal niches
is unknown. Indeed, the ecology of C. elegans in the wild
is not well understood, despite its extensive use in the laboratory [27]. Although C. elegans can be found in soil, it
appears that the predominant stage observed in the wild
is the dauer larvae, typically found in organic-rich environments such as compost, or in association with invertebrates such as snails and isopods [28]. Dauer stages are
resistant and non-feeding and the natural food source of
C. elegans in the wild is unknown. C. elegans possesses a
sensitive chemosensory system that, at least in the laboratory setting, allows the worm to differentiate between bacterial food sources and potential pathogens [29]. Thus in
the environment, worms could potentially avoid bacteria
producing noxious compounds.
Many Hsp90 inhibitors are natural compounds produced
by micro-organisms and recent studies have provided an
intriguing insight into the mechanisms by which the
organisms that produce Hsp90 inhibitors can themselves
survive. For example, in the yeast Humicola fuscoatra,
which produces Radicicol, a single conserved amino acid
substitution (L33I) in Hsp-90, is sufficient to alter the
binding of Radicicol, without influencing the ability to
bind ATP or GA [30]. Here, a leucine to isoleucine substitution alters the size of the hydrophobic drug-binding
pocket increasing the binding of H2O molecules and
hydration of the drug. Such findings serve to emphasise
that very subtle alterations in amino acid residues can
have major implications on drug binding efficacy and

highlight the importance of understanding the structural
basis of drug binding, which is not always apparent from
analysis of DNA sequences.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that C. elegans Hsp-90 is not
unique in its low affinity for GA; despite a relatively high
level of sequence conservation, nematode Hsp-90s show
functional diversity in relation to GA-binding. The ability
to bind to GA is associated with the life history of a species; free-living nematodes and those parasitic species
which have a free-living larval stage in the environment
do not bind GA, while obligate parasites or those parasitic
species which have free-living stages enclosed within a
resistant egg, do bind GA. As S. hygroscopicus, the microorganism that synthesizes GA, is found in soil, and as
Hsp-90 is an essential molecule in all eukaryotes, these
observations could be consistent with adaptive evolution
of hsp-90 sequences. Analysis of hsp-90 sequences from fifteen different nematode species provided evidence of
rapid diversifying selection along three separate branches.
However, the selection observed did not correlate with the
ability to bind GA or not.

Methods
Worm material
The following species of free-living nematode were used
C. elegans N2 strain, C. elegans strain JT6130, which carries
a point mutation in daf-21 (hsp-90), Caenorhabditis
briggsae, Oscheia tipulae, Pristionchus pacificus (all clade V,
obtained from the C. elegans Genetics Center) and Panagrellus redivivus (clade IV). Parasitic species analysed
included Trichinella spiralis and Trichuris muris (both clade
I), and the following clade III species: Brugia pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis, Onchocerca ochengi, Acanthocheilonema
viteae, Litomosoides sigmondontis, Toxocara cati, Ascaris
suum, Parascaris equorum, Anisakis simplex, Pseudoterranova
decipens and Anguillicola crassus. Clade IV species included
Strongyloides ratti, Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida.
Clade V species included Nippostrongylus brasilensis, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Teleodorsagia circumcincta and
Haemonchus contortus. Mixed life cycle stages were used for
all the free-living nematodes while for parasitic species,
usage was determined by the availability of particular life
cycle stages; in most cases adult males and females were
analysed with the following exceptions: Globodera sp. J2
stages; H. contortus, L3; T. spiralis L1 muscle stage larvae; A.
simplex and P. decipens L3. S. ratti adults were free-living
rather than parasitic females [31] and for O. ochengi only
male worms were used.
Maintenance of nematodes
C. elegans N2 strain, C. briggsae, O. tipulae and P. pacificus
were maintained at 20°C on NGM plates with OP50 as a
bacterial food source [32]. Worms were washed off plates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/254

with M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 ml
1 M MgSO4 in 1 litre ddH2O) and collected by centrifugation. P. redivivus worms were maintained at room temperature on plates containing an oat-based medium. The
cooked oats were poured into plates and the worms
placed on the surface. As their population blooms, the
worms move onto the lid, from where they can be collected by rinsing the lids with M9 buffer. Worms were
then washed several times in M9 buffer by centrifugation.
Adult stages of all parasitic species were obtained from
their respective hosts and frozen as soon as possible at 80°C. As no signal on a western blot could be obtained
using anti- Hsp-90 antibodies to probe extracts of adult H.
contortus, L3 of this species were obtained by harvesting
eggs from infected sheep faeces and allowing these to
develop [33]. For Globodera species, cysts were rehydrated
in tap water for several days and then hatched in tomato
root exudate (kindly provided by J. Jones, Scottish Plant
Breeding Institute, Invergowrie). Cysts were checked daily
for hatched J2 stages. These were removed by pipetting,
washed in ddH20 and purified from debris by flotation on
60% sucrose. For T. spiralis, muscle-stage larvae (L1) were
obtained by digestion of infected mouse muscle using
standard methods [34]. Larval stages (L3) of A. simplex
and P. decipens were obtained from infected fish.
Preparation of worm lysates
Lysates of worms were prepared in ice-cold TNES buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA,
1% Igepal CA-630). Protease inhibitors were added prior
to use (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche
Diagnostics). Worms were ground to a fine powder using
a pestle and mortar containing liquid Nitrogen. Extracts
were resuspended in 1.0 ml TNES, the mortar was washed
out with 0.5 ml TNES, and the extract was pelleted at
14000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was
retained and assayed for protein concentration at OD 595
nm using the Bio-Rad Protein assay. Lysates of D. immitis
and O. ochengi were prepared using a small glass homogeniser containing 100 l of ice-cold TNES and the supernatant processed as described above.
Preparation of GA solid support and binding assay
1 mg GA (InvivoGen) was derivatised using 1,6-hexanediamine to yield 17-hexamethylenediamine-17 demethoxygeldanamycin [4]. After aqueous extraction, the mixture
was dried under nitrogen then re-dissolved in 400 l of
DMSO. The product was incubated with 400 l of washed
Affi-Beads (Bio-Rad) for 4 h in the dark at room temperature. Beads were washed in TNES and then were rocked
overnight at 4°C in 1.0 ml of ethanolamine (1 M, pH 8.3)
to block residual binding sites. Prior to use, beads were
blocked in 1% BSA in TNES for 1 h at room temperature.
Control beads were incubated with DMSO alone.

300-500 g of total protein in a volume of 300 l was
mixed with 50 l packed volume of GA or control beads
for 2.5 hours at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively
in TNES by centrifugation and bound proteins were eluted
by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample cocktail (0.125 M Tris,
pH 6.8, 0.2 M dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol,
0.042% bromophenol blue). Aliquots of the input fraction and protein eluted from control and GA beads were
run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and analysed by western blotting. Blots were probed with a 1:5000 dilution of an antibody raised to a C-terminal fragment of recombinant B.
pahangi Hsp-90, as detailed previously [6], followed by
1:10000 dilution of HRP-labelled anti-rabbit IgG
(Sigma). Bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence using the Super Signal ® West Pico Kit (Thermo Scientific). If no signal or only a weak signal was observed,
blots were repeated using the AC88 Hsp-90 monoclonal
antibody (a kind gift of D. Toft) as the primary antibody
at 1:500 dilution followed by anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at
1:10000. AC88 recognises an epitope in the C-terminus of
Hsp-90 and reacts with Hsp-90 from many different
organisms. In all experiments, a lysate of B. pahangi was
used as a positive control. The specificity of GA binding
was determined in subsequent experiments by pre-incubating worm extracts with 20 M GA prior to incubation
with the GA beads.
Sequence and bioinformatic analysis
hsp-90 sequences from B. pahangi [GenBank:AJ005785],
H. glycines [GenBank:AF461150], M. hapla [GenBank:AAT35588], C. elegans [GenBank:C47E8.5] and C.
briggsae [GenBank:CBG040560] were obtained from the
NCBI. C. brenneri, C. japonica and C. remanei hsp-90
sequences were obtained by carrying out a tBLASTn search
at http://www.nematode.net using the Ce-DAF-21 amino
acid sequence to retrieve full length cDNA sequences for
each Caenorhabditis species.

The full-length sequence of T. spiralis hsp-90 was identified
by a tBLASTn search of the available genome sequence at
http://www.genome.wustl.edu with the Ce-DAF-21
amino acid sequence. A significant match was obtained to
contig 9.2, the sequence of which was obtained from Amy
Yu at Washington University School of Medicine. For P.
pacificus, the full-length hsp-90 sequence was obtained by
tBLASTn search of the sequence available at http://
www.pristionchus.org using the Ce-DAF-21 amino acid
sequence, resulting in the retrieval of contig 4.9. For
Trichinella and Pristionchus, intron and exon sites were
identified using Genewise in EXPASY, allowing assembly
of the full-length predicted cDNA sequence. For H. contortus, the hsp-90 sequence was assembled by carrying out a
tBLASTn search at http://www.sanger.ac.uk using the CeDAF-21 amino acid sequence to retrieve contig _0076156,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/254

as detailed previously [35]. The sequence was submitted
to GenBank [GenBank:FJ717747].
For A. suum a partial hsp-90 sequence was obtained by carrying out a tBLASTn search at http://www.nematode.net
using the Ce-DAF-21 amino acid sequence and retrieving
EST sequence kj94a07.y1, which contained 768 bp of 5' A.
suum Hsp-90 sequence. A primer was designed to the 5'
end of the gene, 5'-ATGTCTGAGCAACAGCCTGAAGGA3' and used in combination with a series of degenerate
primers, designed over the conserved MEEVD region, to
amplify the full length hsp-90 coding sequence from adult
A. suum cDNA. One 3' degenerate primer was more successful than others and was used in all subsequent reactions, 5'-ANTCNACNTCNTCCATNCGNGANGC-3'. Full
length A. suum hsp-90 was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced by automated DNA sequencing
using vector and gene specific primers (MWG Biotech)
and assigned an accession number [GenBank:FJ824589].
For L. sigmodontis and T. canis partial hsp-90 sequences
were obtained by carrying out a tBLASTn search at http://
www.ebi.ac.uk using the Bp-HSP-90 amino acid sequence.
A 721 bp EST was retrieved which contained 676 bp of 3'
L. sigmodontis hsp-90 sequence. As the 5' sequence was
missing, an SL1 primer was used (5'-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGA-3') along with a primer designed to the 3'
end of the L. sigmodontis sequence, 5'-TTAATCAACTTCTTCCATCCTCG-3'. The full length L. sigmodontis hsp-90
was amplified from adult L. sigmondontis cDNA, cloned
into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen), sequenced as above and
assigned an accession number [GenBank:FJ824588].
For T. canis, an EST of 647 bp was identified containing
the 5' region of the gene. As the only biological material
available was from the sister species T. cati, PCR was carried out using a primer designed to the 5' end of the T.
canis
hsp-90
sequence
(5'-ATGTCCGAGTTTCAACAACAACCAG-3') together with the degenerate 3'
primer described previously (see above) on cDNA
extracted from adult T. cati worms. The full-length T. cati
hsp-90 was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen),
sequenced as above and assigned an accession number
[GenBank:FJ824590]. All sequences were compiled from
multiple reads in both directions and line-ups and annotations were carried out using Contig express and Vector
NTI.
Partial hsp-90 sequences of X. index (1325 bp), G. pallida
(685 bp) and G. rostochiensis (1394 bp) were obtained by
carrying out a tBLASTn search at http://www.ebi.ac.uk or
http://www.nematode.net using the Bp-HSP-90 amino
acid sequence. For those species for which both fulllength cDNA and genomic hsp-90 sequences were available, intron/exon boundaries were identified in genomic

DNA sequences using Genewise in EXPASY and their positions mapped onto cDNA sequences.
Identifying sites and lineages subject to adaptive evolution
Peptide sequences were generated from translated nucleotide sequences of hsp-90 from seventeen species of nematode C. remanei, C. briggsae, C. brenneri, C. elegans, C.
japonica, P. pacificus, H. contortus, L. sigmodontis, B.
pahangi, A. suum, T. cati, M. hapla, Heterodera glycines, G.
pallida, G. rostochiensis, T. spiralis and Xiphinema index.
These were aligned using Prank [36] and the aligned peptide sequence was back translated to generate an aligned
nucleotide sequence. A phylogenetic tree, generated with
phyML [37] under the HKY substitution model [38], was
used as the starting phylogeny for the codeML program of
the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood
(PAML) suite [39]. A phylogenetic tree generated under
the M0 model inferred that branches leading to two of the
species, T. spiralis and X. index, exhibited much larger
divergence (> 3 substitutions per codon). To avoid potential problems of saturation at high divergence these species were removed from further analyses. Sequences from
the remaining fifteen species were realigned with Prank
and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was again
generated using phyML. To determine if evidence for
adaptive evolution (dN/dS >1) exists in these sequences,
three tests of selection were conducted to compare the
ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions
(dN/dS). (1) Site analysis using a likelihood ratio test (LRT)
to compare the codeML nested models M1/M2 and M7/
M8 which assume a uniform evolutionary rate across all
branches of the tree [40,41]. (2) Branch-sites methods,
which allow for differential rates of evolution across different lineages [7,8]. Using the branch-sites methods each
individual branch was analysed. (3) Species were also
grouped into GA-binders or non-binders and compared
using the branch-sites method, as such comparisons can
improve the power of analysis if the underlying biological
assumption to group the branches is sound [18]. In all
cases multiple independent runs of the CodeML program
were conducted (minimum triplicate) to ensure convergence of maximum likelihood estimates of parameters.
Where multiple tests were conducted, the type I error rate
was controlled by Bonferroni correction [42] (See Table
3). Hsp-90 amino acid sequences from nematode species
used in the bioinformatic analysis were also aligned using
ClustalW [43] and coloured using the default residue
groupings of CHROMA [44].
