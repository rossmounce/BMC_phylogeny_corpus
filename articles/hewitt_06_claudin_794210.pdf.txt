Abstract
Background: The claudin (CLDN) genes encode a family of proteins important in tight junction
formation and function. Recently, it has become apparent that CLDN gene expression is frequently
altered in several human cancers. However, the exact patterns of CLDN expression in various
cancers is unknown, as only a limited number of CLDN genes have been investigated in a few
tumors.
Methods: We identified all the human CLDN genes from Genbank and we used the large public
SAGE database to ascertain the gene expression of all 21 CLDN in 266 normal and neoplastic
tissues. Using real-time RT-PCR, we also surveyed a subset of 13 CLDN genes in 24 normal and 24
neoplastic tissues.
Results: We show that claudins represent a family of highly related proteins, with claudin-16, and
-23 being the most different from the others. From in silico analysis and RT-PCR data, we find that
most claudin genes appear decreased in cancer, while CLDN3, CLDN4, and CLDN7 are elevated in
several malignancies such as those originating from the pancreas, bladder, thyroid, fallopian tubes,
ovary, stomach, colon, breast, uterus, and the prostate. Interestingly, CLDN5 is highly expressed in
vascular endothelial cells, providing a possible target for antiangiogenic therapy. CLDN18 might
represent a biomarker for gastric cancer.
Conclusion: Our study confirms previously known CLDN gene expression patterns and identifies
new ones, which may have applications in the detection, prognosis and therapy of several human
cancers. In particular we identify several malignancies that express CLDN3 and CLDN4. These
cancers may represent ideal candidates for a novel therapy being developed based on CPE, a toxin
that specifically binds claudin-3 and claudin-4.

Background
The claudin family consists of approximately 23 proteins
that are essential for the formation of tight junctions (TJs)
in epithelial and endothelial cells [1]. TJs have crucial
roles in the control of paracellular transport and in the
maintenance of cell polarity. It is thought that various
claudin family members can confer different properties to

epithelial cell permeability and account for some of the
selective variability of different barriers [1]. Indeed, most
tissues express multiple claudins, which can interact in
both homotypic and heterotypic fashion to form the tight
junction strands. The exact combination of claudin proteins within a given tissue is thought to determine the
selectivity and strength of the tight junctions. UnderscorPage 1 of 8

ing the critical roles of claudin proteins are recent observations that germline mutation in these genes can lead to
various familial diseases, such as neonatal sclerosing
cholangitis (CLDN1) [2], nonsyndromic recessive deafness (CLDN14) [3], and familial hypomagnesaemia
(CLDN16)[4].
Recent gene expression profiling analyses have shown that
claudin gene expression is frequently altered in various
cancers (reviewed in [5,6]). For example, CLDN3, and
CLDN4 have been found frequently up-regulated in ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors [7-11]. CLDN7
has been found downregulated in breast and head and
neck cancer, but elevated in stomach cancer [12,13].
CLDN1 is typically downregulated in various cancers, but
has also been reported to be elevated. The picture that
emerges suggests that claudin expression is altered in several human tumors. Specifically, CLDN1,3,4,5,7,10,16
have been found altered in various cancers [5]. The overexpression of these proteins in cancer (which typically
lose their TJs) is unexpected but may be related to roles
that are unrelated to TJ formation [5]. Indeed, recent work
suggests that claudins may be involved in survival and
invasion of cancer cells [12,14,15].
Regardless of their exact functions in cancer cells, claudin
protein expression may have significant clinical relevance
[5,6]. For example, claudin-1 expression has been shown
to have prognostic value in colon cancer [16], claudin-18
in gastric cancer [17], and claudin-10 in hepatocellular
carcinoma [18]. In addition, because claudins are surface
proteins, they may represent useful target for various therapeutic strategies. Of particular interest, in the possible
use of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) as a novel
chemotherapeutic compound. CPE is a natural ligand for
claudin-3 and -4 proteins, and binding of the toxin to
these claudins leads to a rapid cytolysis of the cells [19].
Recent preclinical studies have suggested that CPE may be
effective against claudin-3 and -4-expressing malignancies
[8,9,11,20].
Unfortunately, the exact patterns of expression of the various claudins in different cancers and normal tissues are
not well known. To date, only a few of the claudin proteins have been investigated in a relatively limited number
of cancers. In this report, we use the vast amount of data
present in the public SAGE database to create a claudin
gene expression profile of all the known claudin genes, in
a large number of tissues. We then survey a subset of these
claudin genes using real-time RT-PCR in a panel of normal and neoplastic tissues. Our study confirms previous
claudin gene expression patterns and identifies new ones,
which may potentially be of clinical use for various cancers.

Methods
Claudin homology and phylogenetic tree
21 human claudin genes and corresponding proteins
sequences were identified and downloaded from GenBank. The ClustalW software (with the Blosum62 matrix)
was used to produce a multiple sequence alignment of all
these human claudin protein sequences and the Jalview
software was then used to visualize the results [21]. A phylogenetic tree of the claudin proteins was produced with
ClustalW. The clustalW phylogenetic calculations are
based on the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei
[22].
In silico analysis of claudin gene expression
Mining of the SAGE Genie database [23] for libraries that
expressed GAPDH or ACTB yielded a total of 266 SAGE
libraries with at least some level of expression of these
control genes. These libraries were then examined for the
expression of all 21 human CLDN genes that we identified. SAGE data for both normal and cancerous tissues
was exported to an excel spreadsheet, and expression levels converted to tags per 200,000 (the complete dataset is
available as additional file 1). The dChip software http://
www.dchip.org program was then used to visualize this
data, assigning darker shades of red to higher number of
tags.
Real-time RT-PCR of claudin family members
A total of 48 cDNA preparations from various normal and
neoplastic tissues (24 each) were purchased from Biochains (Hayward, CA). The GeneAmp 7300 Sequence
Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems) was used for
detecting RT-PCR products in real-time with the SYBR
Green I assay, as previously described [24]. The primers
for
the
various
CLDN
genes
(CLDN1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,16,18) and the control
GAPDH were designed to cross intron-exon boundaries to
distinguish PCR products generated from genomic versus
cDNA template. For CLDN genes lacking introns, realtime RT-PCR was performed by the polyA cDNA-specific
RT-PCR method [25]. The primer sequences are available
online as additional file 2.

Each PCR reaction was optimized to ensure that a single
band of the appropriate size was amplified and that no
bands corresponding to genomic DNA amplification or
primer-dimer pairs were present. The PCR cycling conditions were performed for all samples as follows: 50°C, 2
minutes for AmpErase UNG incubation, 95°C, 10 minutes for AmpliTaq Gold activation, and 40 cycles for the
melting (95°C, 15 seconds) and annealing/extension
(60°C for 1 minute) steps. PCR reactions for each template were done in duplicate in 96-well plates.

The comparative CT method (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to determine relative quantitation
of gene expression for each CLDN gene compared to the
GAPDH control. First, the CT values from GAPDH reactions were averaged for each duplicate. Next, the relative
difference between GAPDH and each duplicate was calculated as previously described [24]. The final values were
then averaged for each duplicate set, and used in the
dChip analysis. Clustering of the CLDN genes was performed with distances based on 1-rank correlation and
the centroid linkage method.

Results
The claudin family of proteins
As a starting point for our analyses, we identified 21 different human claudin proteins in the GenBank database.
Alignment of these 21 sequences using ClustalW shows
that most of the claudin proteins are extremely similar,
especially in the membrane-spanning regions (Figure 1A).
Notable exceptions are claudin-16, which contains a 66 aa
extension at the N-terminus, claudin-18, which has an
extension in the second extracellular loop, and claudin-23
with a longer C-terminal tail. A phylogenetic tree was also
generated to better identify similar members of the family.
Overall, the tree demonstrated that the claudins constitute
highly related family of proteins, with claudin-16, and -23
being the most different from the others (Figure 1B).
Claudin-6 and -9 are the most similar, followed by claudin-3 and -4, and claudin-1 and -7.
In silico analysis of CLDN expression in 266 tissues
Because serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) measures absolute levels of transcripts, cross-comparison of
SAGE data is possible across experiments and laboratories
[26]. The SAGE Genie database has been developed to
allow in silico analysis of gene expression and comparison
of transcript levels in a large number of normal and diseased tissues [23]. Using the SAGE Genie database, we
extracted gene expression data for all 21 human claudins
across 266 tissues (Figure 2 and additional file 1). Some
of these genes, such as CLDN1,2,3,4,5,7,11,12, and 15 are
expressed in a large number of different tissues. In contrast, other claudins, such as CLDN14,16,17,20, and 22
have much more restricted expression patterns. CLDN17,
for example, was found expressed in only one SAGE
library (normal kidney), at low levels. CLDN20 was only
found in 3 cancer libraries total (a chondrosarcoma, a
brain cancer, and a liver tumor). Similarly, CLDN22 was
only found in 2 breast cancer libraries and one brain
astrocytoma library. On the other hand, CLDN3,4, and 7
were highly expressed in most normal epithelial cells as
well as their corresponding neoplasias. Further analysis
suggested that these claudins are frequently elevated in
cancer. For example, CLDN3 was elevated in tumors of the
lung, prostate, breast, kidney, and ovary compared to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/186

their normal counterparts. Similarly, CLDN4 was elevated
in tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, pancreas, and
ovary. CLDN7 was elevated in cancers of the thyroid, lung,
stomach, pancreas, liver, kidney, and ovary. Interestingly,
CLDN6 was frequently expressed in embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) but generally not in other tissues. CLDN7 was the
only other CLDN expressed at significant level in ESCs.
CLDN18 expression seemed to be mostly restricted to the
stomach and the lungs. Vascular endothelial cells
expressed CLDN5 at high levels, suggesting a new target
for antiangiogenic therapy. Brain had distinctive claudin
expression profiles, with CLDN3,4 and 7, expressed at low
levels but CLDN2 and CLDN5 very highly expressed. This
pattern was opposite to what we observed in epithelial
cells. CLDN12 was the most widely expressed gene and
appeared expressed constitutively in most tissues.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis of CLDN expression
In order to validate and extend the in silico results
obtained with the SAGE Genie database, we performed
real-time RT-PCR analysis on a subset of CLDN genes (13
genes total) to survey gene expression in several tissues.
Gene-specific
primers
for
CLDN1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,16,18 were designed and
optimized. These CLDN genes were chosen because they
were expressed at detectable levels in several tissues and
represented a wide variety of different expression patterns
as suggested by the SAGE database analysis. A total of 24
normal tissues and 24 tumors were surveyed for CLDN
expression (Figure 3). Using this technique, we find that
the various normal tissues express a wide variety of CLDN
genes (Figure 3A). For example, the kidney expresses high
levels of CLDN10 and CLDN12, but also expresses some
levels of all the other CLDN genes tested (with the exception of CLDN18). Clustering of CDLN genes showed a
tight association of CLDN3,4,7 in terms of their expression patterns, suggesting a coordinate regulation of these
genes. The CLDN3,4,7 cluster was found expressed at high
levels in normal pancreas, salivary gland, kidney, adrenal
gland, small intestine, colon, and thyroid. Examination of
the tumor samples revealed that the diversity of CLDN
expression was decreased in these samples (Figure 3B).
Except for the CLDN3,4,7 cluster, which was also present
and often elevated in tumors, the other CLDNs appeared
to be expressed at relatively low levels. CLDN3,4,7 were
expressed in tumors of the pancreas, bladder, thyroid, fallopian tubes, ovary, stomach, colon, breast, uterus, and
prostate. Because of the low number of samples examined, this survey doe not represent an exhaustive analysis
of CLDN gene expression in various tissues but rather an
initial study of tissue specificity. However, the similarity
in the gene expression patterns identified through this survey and previously known patterns (for CLDN3 and 4, for
example) is striking. Additional studies with several

Figureanalysis of claudin gene expression in various normal and neoplastic tissues
In silico 2
In silico analysis of claudin gene expression in various normal and neoplastic tissues. 266 SAGE libraries were examined for the
expression of all 21 CLDN genes using SAGE Genie [23]. SAGE data was compiled from both normal and cancerous tissue, and
analyzed using dChip software http://www.dchip.org program, which assigned darker shades of red to higher number of tags.
GAPDH and ACTN levels were also analyzed as controls. While some CLDN genes are ubiquitously expressed, others exhibit
highly tissue specific patterns. A detailed spreadsheet of the data is available as supplementary information.

other clinical parameters will be necessary.

Discussion

Our data also reveal claudin expression patterns that were
not previously known and that may have clinical implications. According to our data, gastric cells (both normal
and neoplastic) express high levels of CLDN18, while
other tissues do not express this gene. Interestingly, a
recent study shows that claudin-18 is highly expressed in
normal gastric cells and that this high expression is
retained in approximately half the gastric tumors [17].
Because of its highly restricted pattern, claudin-18 may
therefore represent a useful target for therapy of gastric
cancer, especially in those tumors that maintain high levels of this gene. Claudin-18 is likely involved in TJ formation in normal gastric cells, while cancer cells, which
typically do not form TJ's, may have a more available form
of claudin-18. Therefore cancer cells may be more sensi-

Alterations in the expression levels of tight junction proteins, especially claudins, continue to be reported in several cancers. However, an overall view of claudin gene
expression in normal and cancer tissues has been lacking.
In this report, we first use the large public SAGE database
to investigate claudin expression of the 21 human CLDN
genes we have identified in GenBank. We find that, while
some CLDN genes are ubiquitously expressed, the majority of these genes exhibit a very restricted expression pattern. CLDN14,16,17,19,20, and 22, for example, are
found in only a few rare libraries. Others such as
CLDN3,4,5,7,11, and 12 are much more widely expressed.
Our analysis allows for the identification of general
expression patterns, such as the high expression of

tive to therapy involving the targeting of this molecule.
We also find that CLDN5 is not generally expressed in epithelial tissues but is expressed at high levels in all vascular
endothelial cell libraries analyzed. Although also
expressed in the brain, CLDN5 may represent a target for
antiangiogenic therapy, especially if using compounds
that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.
Our RT-PCR experiments provide a more quantitative
look at claudin gene expression in several normal and
neoplastic tissues. It is important to note that these RTPCR investigations do not represent an exhaustive study
of CLDN gene expression, but rather a survey of expression in a large number of different human tissues. Followup studies on multiple samples for these different malignancies will be necessary to clearly establish the extent
and levels of expression of claudins in these tissues. However, it is important to note that the patterns of gene
expression obtained by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 3)
closely mirrors the in silico findings using the SAGE Genie
database (Figure 2). For example, the CLDN3 and CLDN4
expression patterns are consistent between the two analyses (as described above). In addition, we also observe high
correspondence in the two approaches when examining
CLDN5 expression, which appears to be especially high in
normal brain and brain cancer. Interestingly, when clustering our RT-PCR data for gene expression patterns, we
find CLDN3,4,7 are very similar in their expression, suggesting coordinate regulation. The fact that the
CLDN3,4,7 cluster is present in both normal and tumors
suggests that the mechanisms that lead to the coordinated
expression of claudins in normal cells is conserved in
tumor cells, although it may be inappropriately activated
in cancer. It will certainly be interesting to elucidate the
mechanisms that lead to the inappropriate activation of
these genes.
Our in silico and RT-PCR results are consistent with
numerous previous reports showing that CLDN3 and
CLDN4 are overexpressed in breast [11], ovarian [7], and
prostate tumors [9]. In addition, our data showing overexpression of CLDN4 in pancreatic cancer is also in agreement with previous reports [8,27]. The finding of
expression of these claudins in other tumors, such as bladder, thyroid, fallopian tubes, stomach, colon, and uterus,
is novel and warrants further investigation. CPE-based
therapy, which specifically targets cells expressing claudin-3 or claudin-4 [8,9,11,20], may be worth exploring in
these malignancies as well. The fact that CLDN3, and
CLDN4 are expressed in several normal tissues (Figure 3A)
certainly suggests that systemic administration of CPE
may have significant toxic effects. However, the therapeutic index of this compound will depend on the level of upregulation in the various tumors under study and the
mode of administration. In ovarian cancer, for example,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/186

where both CLDN3 and CLDN4 are highly up regulated
and where intraperitoneal therapy is possible, CPE treatment is certainly an interesting possibility.
In this report we study the expression of the CLDN genes
at the mRNA level, but it will obviously be essential to validate these findings at the protein level when all the antibodies are available, as posttranslational mechanisms
have been shown to regulate claudin protein levels and
localization [5]. In addition, it will be important to investigate the various claudins studied here for their potential
clinical use in cancer therapy and diagnosis. With over 20
known members, many of which, as we show in this
report, exhibit high tissue-specific expression and deregulation in various cancers, the claudin family of membrane
proteins may represent ideal targets for cancer diagnosis
and therapy.

Conclusion
Systematic analysis of CLDN gene expression using in silico and RT-PCR approaches demonstrate a wide range of
expression patterns among the various claudins in human
cancer. CLDN3, CLDN4, and CLDN7 are elevated in several malignancies such as those originating from the pancreas, bladder, thyroid, fallopian tubes, ovary, stomach,
colon, breast, uterus, and the prostate. These cancers are
thus ideal candidates for a for a novel therapy being developed based on CPE, a toxin that specifically binds claudin-3 and claudin-4. CLDN18 is specifically expressed in
gastric cells and may represent a marker for gastric tumors.
CLDN5 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells,
providing a possible target for antiangiogenic therapy.
Overall, a better knowledge of claudin expression in normal and neoplastic tissues may provide new opportunities
for the detection, prognosis and therapy of several human
cancers.
