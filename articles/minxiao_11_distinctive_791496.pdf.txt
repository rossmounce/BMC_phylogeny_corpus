Distinctive mitochondrial genome of Calanoid
copepod Calanus sinicus with multiple large
non-coding regions and reshuffled gene order:
Useful molecular markers for phylogenetic and
population studies
Wang Minxiao1,2†, Sun Song1*, Li Chaolun1†, Shen Xin3

Abstract
Background: Copepods are highly diverse and abundant, resulting in extensive ecological radiation in marine
ecosystems. Calanus sinicus dominates continental shelf waters in the northwest Pacific Ocean and plays an
important role in the local ecosystem by linking primary production to higher trophic levels. A lack of effective
molecular markers has hindered phylogenetic and population genetic studies concerning copepods. As they are
genome-level informative, mitochondrial DNA sequences can be used as markers for population genetic studies
and phylogenetic studies.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of C. sinicus is distinct from other arthropods owing to the concurrence of
multiple non-coding regions and a reshuffled gene arrangement. Further particularities in the mitogenome of
C. sinicus include low A + T-content, symmetrical nucleotide composition between strands, abbreviated stop
codons for several PCGs and extended lengths of the genes atp6 and atp8 relative to other copepods. The
monophyletic Copepoda should be placed within the Vericrustacea. The close affinity between Cyclopoida and
Poecilostomatoida suggests reassigning the latter as subordinate to the former. Monophyly of Maxillopoda is
rejected. Within the alignment of 11 C. sinicus mitogenomes, there are 397 variable sites harbouring three ‘hotspot’
variable sites and three microsatellite loci.
Conclusion: The occurrence of the circular subgenomic fragment during laboratory assays suggests that special
caution should be taken when sequencing mitogenomes using long PCR. Such a phenomenon may provide
additional evidence of mitochondrial DNA recombination, which appears to have been a prerequisite for shaping
the present mitochondrial profile of C. sinicus during its evolution. The lack of synapomorphic gene arrangements
among copepods has cast doubt on the utility of gene order as a useful molecular marker for deep phylogenetic
analysis. However, mitochondrial genomic sequences have been valuable markers for resolving phylogenetic issues
concerning copepods. The variable site maps of C. sinicus mitogenomes provide a solid foundation for population
genetic studies.

Background
Copepods play an important role in the aquatic ecosystem and are highly diverse. They comprise a multitude
of taxa including 200 families, 1,650 genera and 11,500
species [1], although this estimation may represent only
15% of the actual number [2]. Copepods have successfully colonized almost all aquatic regimes and have
developed diverse life styles [3]. Therefore, phylogenetic
studies are required to develop a complete biodiversity
inventory of the group, which will enable the question
of how copepods have acquired such diversity over time
to be investigated.
Several incompatible classification schemes have been
proposed for copepods on the basis of morphological
characteristics [4]. Since the incorporation of copepods
as a monophyletic group in 1859, phylogenetic studies
have focused on the natural relationships between the
incorporated orders, Calanoida, Cyclopoida, Gellyelloida,
Harpacticoida, Misophrioida, Monstrilloida, Mormonilloida, Platycopioida, Poecilostomatoida and Siphonostomatoida [3]. Dussart (1984) classified Calanoida and
Poecilostomatoida together in the lineage CyclopinidaeOithonidae-(Poecilostomatoida-Calanoida) [5] while
other researchers have classified the Calanoida outside
Podoplea, at the relative basal position [3,6]. Kabata,
Marcotte and Boxshall hypothesised that Poecilostomatoida is the sister group to Cyclopoida. However, other
studies have placed Poecilostomatoida and Siphonostomatoida within close phylogenetic affinity [3,6].
Recently, Boxshall reassigned Poecilostomatoida as a
suborder of Cyclopoida [7]. The relationships among
copepods and other subgroups of Pancrustacea have yet
to be elucidated with 11 alternative sister group hypotheses being proposed for the taxon [8]. The recent
ambiguous status of copepod phylogenetic research is
due at least in part to the limited diagnostic morphological characteristics, difficulty in accessing morphological homology and a poor fossil record.
In metazoans, the mitochondrial genome is usually a
circular, double-stranded DNA molecule (mtDNA),
which spans a general length of 16 kb but can vary from
14 to 48 kb. The gene content is conserved with 37
genes: 13 protein-encoding genes, two ribosomal RNA
genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and one or more
non-coding region(s) containing signals for transcription
and replication of the mtDNA [9]. Several advantages
including accelerated substitution rates, (almost) unambiguous orthology and being genome-level informative
[10,11] have allowed the mitochondrial genome to be
widely used for population studies [12,13], phylogeography [12,14] and phylogenetic relationships at various
taxonomic levels across animal taxa, particularly in
arthropods [15-17]. Furthermore, extensive intraspecific
polymorphism in the non-coding regions facilitates

studies at population level [17]. However, there is little
information concerning the structure and genetic polymorphism of the non-coding regions in crustaceans.
Despite the vast diversity of copepods, few mitochondrial genomes have been charted. Taxon sampling has
been biased to certain orders including Harpacticoida:
Tigriopus japonicus [18,19], Tigriopus californicus [14];
Siphonostomatoida: Lepeophtheirus salmonis [20] and
Cyclopoida: Paracyclopina nana [21]. More mitochondrial genomes with increased taxon coverage are
required to resolve several issues concerning copepod
phylogeny including its phylogenetic position within
Pancrustacea and the relationship of its component
orders. Calanus sinicus (Copepoda: Calanoida) dominates continental shelf waters in the northwest Pacific
Ocean, linking primary production and the larvae and
juveniles of fishes [22]. Given its ecological importance,
C. sinicus is one of the target species in the China-GLOBEC program. Despite this status, there is little information concerning the population genetics of this species
owing to the lack of suitable genetic markers. This study
presents a near complete mitochondrial genome of
C. sinicus, which represents the first member of the
Calanoida. The gene order of C. sinicus was compared
with other copepods to identify the evolution of the
mitochondrial genomes in this group. Combining the
new mitogenome and previously published mitogenomes
from arthropods, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis was
carried out to investigate the relationships between several orders in Copepoda and their positions within Pancrustacea. In addition, intraspecific polymorphisms of
major loci in 11 C. sinicus mitogenomes from four
populations were compared to screen potential markers
for population studies.

Results and Discussion
Genome Organization

A long-PCR-based genome sequencing protocol was
adopted for animal mtDNAs. However, this technique
failed to amplify a fragment containing partial noncoding regions and two tRNA genes. Several unknown
factors including gene rearrangement, notable base composition bias, an extended length of GC-rich tract,
highly repeated regions and stable secondary structures
could terminate the movement of the polymerase and
therefore complicate the recovery of mitogenomes from
copepods using this technique [19,21,23].
The 20,460 bp assembled contig (Figure 1, Table 1)
comprised all but two tRNA genes (trnR and trnC), and
included 13 protein coding genes (cox1-3, nad1-6,
nad4L, atp6, atp8 and cytb), two rRNA genes (rrnS and
rrnL) and 20 tRNA genes. In addition, one of the long
non-coding regions (LNR) between trnH and trnA was
proposed as a control region (CR) on the basis of the

secondary structure motifs identified. The majority of
metazoan mitogenomes contain two abutting gene
blocks, nad4/nad4L and rrnS/rrnL. However, these are
separated in copepods. The 35 genes were located in
three clusters interleaved by long non-coding regions
(LNR1, LNR3 and LNR5). Unlike Tigriopus sp. [14],
mitochondrial genes were encoded on both strands in
C. sinicus, and the minority (rrnL, trnV, trnD, trnT,
nad4L, nad5, trnH, trnA, trnY, nad3, nad4, trnK, nad2,
atp8 and atp6) were identified on the H-strand (as
defined by molecular weight). Of the 20 tRNA genes, 17

were arranged in three main clusters, V-D-T-S2, F-I and
A-F-Y-E-Q-L1-P-M-K-W-S1-N, reading clockwise. Compactness is a characteristic feature of mitochondrial genomes [10] and there were small gene overlaps at three
gene borders. The largest overlap was identified between
trnY and trnE, with a length of five nucleotides.
Base Composition and Codon Usage

The H-strand in the C. sinicus mitogenome comprises
32.1% A, 19.1% C, 19.3% G and 29.6% T. As presented
in Table 1, the overall A + T content of C. sinicus is

relatively low (61.7%) in comparison with other crustaceans, but within the range for copepods, a minimum of
60.4% in T. japonicus to a maximum of 70.8% in
P. nana (Additional file 1). The same trend was
observed in the protein coding genes (PCGs, 60.3%) and
non-coding sequences (58.2%), which were lower than
those in the majority of crustaceans. The A + T content
of structural RNA genes was much richer, being 72.3%
and 72.2% for tRNA and rRNA genes, respectively,
which is comparable with other crustaceans.
Metazoan mitogenomes normally bear a clear strand
asymmetry in terms of nucleotide composition owing to

asymmetric deamination of A and C nucleotides on
each strand during replication and/or transcription processes [24]. However, there are approximately equal
numbers of each complementary nucleotide pair in
C. sinicus. When measured as AT- and GC-skews ((A
%-T%)/(A% + T%) and (G%-C%)/(G% + C%)), the result
is close to equality (0.00521) for the former and only
moderately positive (0.0405) for the latter. Similar
results have been reported in other copepods (Additional file 1; P. nana: AT-skew = -0.0457, GC-skew =
0.0598; S. polycolpus: AT-skew = -0.0389, GC-skew =
0.0102). In contrast to the whole genome, an anti-A

skewness was apparent for all PCGs (-0.177; with a
range between -0.318 for nad3 to -0.109 for nad5)
regardless of the strand on which they were encoded,
while adenines were slightly preferred in all rRNA genes
(0.0125 for rrnL and 0.0369 for rrnS). As demonstrated
in Table 1 and Additional file 1, over-representation of
guanines emerges in rRNA and tRNA genes. PCGs
represent either neutral (cytb and nad1), negative (nad4,
nad2, atp8 and atp6) or positive GC-skewness. Interestingly, all negative GC-skewed genes clustered in a gene
block carrying the same transcriptional polarization,
possibly because of an inversion or transcriptional polarization of the gene block.
To elucidate possible mechanisms that have shaped
present-day nucleotide compositional strand asymmetry
in the lineage, the GC-skewnesses for individual PCGs
of copepods were compared with those of Limulus polyphemus (Figure 2). The strand asymmetric profiles of
Copepods differed significantly from those of L. polyphemus in most PCGs. This suggests a global reversal of the
skewness as a possible synapomorphy in the group,
probably due to an ancestral inversion of the control
region. However, specific nucleotide asymmetric profiles
can be identified in all genes with the exception of cox2
and nad3, possibly because of a shift in the transcriptional polarization of the genes. The 3rd position of the
PCGs is less constrained, and they tend to accumulate
nucleotide skewness more quickly, making them more
likely to be at equilibrium. The opposite results for the
skewness at different codons in several genes could be
evidence for their recent inversions. Therefore, a

Page 5 of 20

complex series of rearrangement events may have
occurred in this lineage.
The pattern of codon usage in the C. sinicus mitogenome was studied (Additional file 2). A preference for
AT-rich codons was identified in C. sinicus, as is the
case in mitochondrial PCGs of other arthropods. For
example, the most frequently used codons are UUU(F)
(63 codons per 1000 codons), followed by AUU(I) (54
codons per 1000 codons) and then AUA(M) (49 codons
per 1000 codons). Among copepods, the A + T content
of the overall mitogenome is highly correlated with the
corresponding values in degenerate synonymous sites of
protein coding genes (R2 = 0.9918). The A + T-content
of the 3rd codon positions (62.6%) in C. sinicus, which is
only slightly higher than that in T. japonicus, is lower
than that in most other crustaceans.
Protein coding genes

More than one reasonable start codon can be predicted
for several genes. Therefore, start codons were selected
from the candidates following criteria to avoid large
overlaps between genes and to keep a conserved length
with other crustaceans. There are a total of 11,137
nucleotides encoding 13 protein coding genes in C. sinicus, which are at least 147 nt longer than other copepod
mitogenomes. The genes atp6 and atp8 are heavily truncated in other copepods but maintain the regular size in
C. sinicus, predominantly contributing to the elongation
of mitochondrial PCGs. Each of the 13 protein-coding
genes in C. sinicus start with a typical initiation codon

abbreviated as outlined in the abbreviations section.

for atp8, cox2, nad3 and nad5-6, and ATG for the
remainder. Previous studies have reported several atypical initiation codons for cox1 in arthropods [25]. However, the copepods studied to date possess a regular
start codon (ATA) for cox1.
The majority of the 13 protein coding genes terminate
with the conventional stop codons TAG or TAA, but
nad1 and nad5 have truncated stop codons (TA) adjacent to a downstream tRNA gene. The presence of
incomplete stop codons is common in metazoan mitogenomes, and the shortened stop codons are likely to be
completed via post-transcriptional polyadenylation [26].
In view of the clear saturated mutation at the nucleotide
level, the amino acids of PCGs were compared among
copepods. As illustrated in Table 2, the overall amino acid
divergences among the copepods was particularly high,
ranging from 0.238 in cox1 to 0.768 in nad4L. In general,
genes encoding proteins for complex I (nad1-6, nad4L) of
the electron transport chain were less conserved than
others. Altered mutation rates and relatively relaxed selective constraints [27] are the two possible factors responsible for elevated divergence in mitochondrial genes for
complex I. However, NADH genes are dispersed within
mitogenomes of copepods. Therefore, it is unlikely that
several NADH genes would possess altered mutation rates

Five copepods, the PCGs of which have been entirely determined, were
selected for interspecific analysis. For the PCGs, divergence of amino acid was
compared for the interspecific analyses, and the nucleotide divergence was
outlined for the intraspecific comparisons. Ratios of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions for the 13 PCGs were compared. Genes were
labelled as outlined in the abbreviations section. DB and ωB: p-distance and

with the same trend, simultaneously. The latter interpretation seems most plausible. Structural or functional constraints at the protein level can lead to locus-specific
selective pressures acting on mitochondrial genomes, giving rise to a higher divergence in some PCGs.
To examine the evolutionary forces acting on the
mitochondrial PCGs of copepods, rates of non-synonymous substitution (dN) versus synonymous substitution
(dS) were determined. The observed dN/dS ratios
(Table 2) were consistently lower than one, increasing
from 0.0026 for cytb to 0.0926 for nad1. This indicates
a strong purifying selection within this lineage. Values
of dN/dS for genes of sparse polymorphism (cox1-3,
cytb) were generally lower, in agreement with the idea
that highly divergent genes are normally subjected to
less selective pressure.
Ribosomal RNA genes

In the mitogenome of C. sinicus, the 16S ribosomal
RNA (rrnL) and 12S ribosomal RNA (rrnS) genes are
located between trnV/LNR1 and trnG/nad6, respectively. In arthropods, the rRNA genes are normally adjacent on the same strand, interleaved by a single trnV.
However, the two genes are distantly separated on either
strand in C. sinicus, which is rare in metazoans. Examples of the arrangement are mainly found in the primary
lineages [28]. The size of rrnS and rrnL genes in C. sinicus were calculated to be 654 bp and 1,139 bp, respectively, on the basis of the alignment and comparison of
their counterparts in N. cristatus. These lengths are
similar to those of P. nana, but longer than corresponding lengths of other copepods. Consistent with PCGs,
the two rRNA genes were determined to be highly
divergent, with values of 0.405 and 0.409 for rrnS and
rrnL, respectively (Table 2). The secondary structure of
rrnS (Figure 3) was proposed on the basis of the model
of Gutell [29], and rrnL (Figure 4) of the model of De
Rijk et al. [30]. In accordance with their phylogenetic
relationships, the secondary structures of C. sinicus
rRNAs resembled those of crustacean [31] (Daphnia
pulex) more closely than those of insect (Drosophila
yakuba, secondary structures obtained from The European ribosomal RNA database [32]).
Compared with the insect D. yakuba, several compound helixes degenerate into a single one in the crustacean rrnS secondary structures. Both crustaceans lack
helixes 8, 12, 39 and 41 whereas the counterparts are
present in D. yakuba. All helixes present in D. pulex are
shared by C. sinicus with the exception of helix 1. However, most loops and linking sequences between helixes
are somewhat reduced, leading to a much shorter rrnS
in C. sinicus. The alignment of rrnS genes for copepods
indicates that 5’ sequences upstream of helix 32 are
more variable.

addition, the compound Helix D13/D14 is replaced by
one stem-loop, and Helix H3 is absent in C. sinicus. The
greatest sequence conservation was at the 3’ end from
Helix G2 to H2, consistent with the idea that this region
is the main component of the transferase centre [36].
Transfer RNA genes

C. sinicus. Inferred nucleotide bonds are illustrated by lines. The
secondary structure was based on the model of Gutell (1994).

In terms of rrnL, upstream sequences of helix C1 were
too ambitious to align. High diversity in this region has
been reported in several species [33-35], where some or
all helixes are truncated [33,35]. Helix G13, present in
D. yakuba, is absent in C. sinicus and D. pulex. In

Though only partially sequenced, 20 of the 22 mitochondrial tRNA genes have been identified in the
C. sinicus mitogenome on the basis of their potential
cloverleaf structures and anti-codons (Table 1, Figure 5).
Four tRNA genes overlap with one to five shared
nucleotides. The extreme example was identified at the
junction between trnY and trnE. The overlapped portions can be repaired by a post-transcriptional editing
process [36]. Gene lengths (57 to 68 nucleotides) and
anti-codon usage are comparable with those generally
observed in arthropods. However, trnK and trnS1
(AGN) utilize TTT and TCT rather than the more common CTT and GCT. Such substitutions on wobble positions can be found in other invertebrate mitogenomes
[37]. As in other metazoans, anti-codons occasionally
diverge from the most commonly used codons in degenerate codon families. For example, the most frequently
used codon (AUA) for Met contradicts the corresponding anti-codon (AUG).
Complete cloverleaf structures containing the TΨC
stem (mostly 3-5 bp) and loop (3-7 nt), variable loop,
anti-codon stem (5 bp) and loop (7 nt), DHU (mostly
3-4 bp) stem and loop (highly variable from 3 to 10 nt),
and the acceptor stem (7 bp), can be predicted for 19
tRNAs, whereas the DHU arm is absent in trnS2 (UCN).
In addition, the DHU arm for another trnS1 (AGN) is
highly reduced, leaving a short stem (2 nt) and a small
loop (3 nt). Degenerative or unpaired DHU arms in trnS
are considered to be a common condition in arthropods
[38], and particularly in copepods [18,20]. As for other
arthropods, the anti-codon is preceded by a uracil and
followed by a purine in C. sinicus. Deviating from the
canonical mitochondrial tRNAs with four nucleotides in
the variable loops, 5 nt variable loops were identified in
trnI and trnS1 (AGN), and 3 nt variable loops were
identified in trnS2 (UCN).
Non-coding sequences

Figure 4 The inferred secondary structure of the rrnL of
C. sinicus. Inferred nucleotide bonds are illustrated by lines. Helix
numbering follows that of De Rijk et al. (1997).

Within the fragment determined, there were 6,270 bp
non-coding sequences in total (approximate 30% of
complete sequence) distributed among 23 intergenic
regions. Six long non-coding regions larger than 100 bp
were identified between atp6 and rrnL (LNR1; >2,959
bp; not sequenced completely), cox1 and nad4L (LNR2;
128 bp), trnH and trnA (LNR3; 1,770 bp), nad3 and
cox3 (LNR4; 102 bp), cox3 and nad4 (LNR5; 762 bp),
and nad2 and atp8 (LNR6; 172 bp). Six additional non-

their corresponding amino acids. Each structural element is illustrated in trnW and trnY. Canonical cloverleaf structures are assumed in all tRNAs,
with the exception of trnS2 (UCN).

coding regions larger than 30 bp were discovered. The
mitogenome of C. sinicus is one of the largest among
arthropods owing to the prevalence and enlargement of
non-coding regions. The concurrence of numerous large
non-coding regions is unusual [39]. Because of the

deletional bias, large inactive regions tend to be eliminated from mitogenomes so that they become economical [40]. Intergenic spacers are normally limited in
number and size. As far as crustaceans are concerned,
most mitochondrial genomes reported so far possess a

Minxiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/73

single long non-coding region. Exceptions to this
include Speleonectes tulumensis, Hutchinsoniella macracantha [41] and Geothelphusa dehaani [34]. The largest
non-coding sequences, rather than CRs, are usually
smaller than 40 bp [34]. To elucidate the origin of multiple non-coding regions, BLAST analysis was conducted
on LNRs. With the exception of LNR2, in which a 26 bp
stretch similar to other crustacean rrnS was screened,
the BLAST analysis revealed that the LNRs of C. sinicus
shared no significant similarities to any known
sequences. Therefore, independent origins and evolutionary processes are likely to have given rise to the various non-coding regions.
Generally, large non-coding sequences act as control
regions to initiate and/or regulate mitochondrial transcription and replication. However, functions of multiple
heterologous non-coding regions are difficult to predict.
AT-richness is broadly accepted as a characteristic for
the identification of CRs. However, various cases have
been reported [25], and appear to be common in copepods. Of five copepods, three possess equal (L. salmonis
[20]) or lower (T. japonicus [18] and T. californicus
[14]) A + T-contents in their control regions. Relatively
lower AT-contents are present in C. sinicus LNRs with
the exception of LNR2 (68.0%). Although conserved
sequence blocks (CSBs) are common in control regions
of metazoans [26,42], such conservative properties
among copepods were not detected. Therefore, the control regions were screened on the basis of the secondary
structure motifs.
Several secondary structure motifs commonly found in
control regions of arthropods [42-45] were identified in
LNR3 including: (1) a poly-T stretch 360 bp to the 3’
end of LNR3; (2) a hairpin structure (Additional file 3)
on the L-strand 140 bp downstream of the poly-T
stretch; (3) conserved sequences at the lateral ends of
the hairpin structure; and (4) a microsatellite locus following the hairpin structure with “AT” as the core
repeat (14-28 repetitions). These motifs make LNR3 the
most likely candidate for the mitochondrial control
region. However, hairpin structures were identified in
other LNRs, which could be related to the mode of regulation of replication and transcription. Considering the
extreme complexity of the non-coding sequences in C.
sinicus, more comparative and functional analyses are
required to elucidate their exact roles during mitochondrial metabolism.
Mitochondrial gene order

In addition to the multiplication of LNRs, a notably
shuffled gene order was present. Similar features were
identified in a nonbilaterian species, Nemateleotris magnifica [46], but are rare in bilaterians [10]. Mitochondrial gene order rearrangements are common among

Page 9 of 20

crustaceans, particularly in copepods [19,21,23,25]. In
the case of C. sinicus, the mitochondrial genome is
heavily rearranged. Compared with other mitogenomes
in the MITOME database (http://www.mitome.info),
C. sinicus has a unique gene order. Comparison of the
C. sinicus mitogenome to the ground pattern for arthropod mitogenomes [47] (Figure 6) revealed that the mitogenome was reshuffled. Translocations were identified
for all tRNA genes in the mitogenome of C. sinicus.
Among 36 gene boundaries, only two adjoining atp6atp8 and nad6-cytb were retained. Moreover, 12 genes
(34.2%) have developed a contrary transcriptional polarization: trnD, atp6, atp8, nad3, trnA and nad2 inverted
from the L-strand to the H-strand, whereas trnF, trnP,
nad1, trnK, rrnS and trnQ were shifted from the Hstrand to the L-strand.
In accordance with the high rate of sequence divergence between lineages, scrambled gene orders were
observed among copepods. Large-scale gene rearrangements were identified within the family Calanidae [23].
Owing to the small size and special secondary structures, tRNA genes are more mobile, and account for
most translocations in crustaceans [25,34]. To avoid
confusion initiated by reversal translocations of tRNA
genes, the discussion of gene order is restricted to the
protein-coding and rRNA genes (Figure 6). Complete
reshuffling can be found in all copepod mitogenomes,
leading to a divergent pattern of gene order in this
group.
Translocations involving protein coding or rRNA
genes are rare in metazoans [10]. Such dramatic rearrangement of genes in copepods challenges the view of
conservation of mitochondrial gene order, as suggested
by unusual gene translocations in molluscs [48,49].
When pairwise gene orders of copepods are compared,
there are few common intervals (0 to 40) indicated by
results from CREx [50]; exceptions are two siphonostomatoid species belonging to the family Caligidae
(Additional file 4). No conserved synteny is shared by
the copepod samples studied here, questioning their
homologous status. The similarities of gene order within
the family Calanidae and between the orders were compared, with no significant differences being identified.
Therefore, the phylogenetic signal may be diluted by frequent gene rearrangements within the lineage. The lack
of unambiguous synapomorphic gene arrangements in
copepods precludes their use in phylogenetic analysis
concerning Copepoda.
With regard to the rearrangement of mitochondrial
genes, two major categories of mechanisms have been
advanced: (1) tandem duplication followed by random
or non-random deletion of excess genes [51,52]; and (2)
non-homologous recombination [53,54]. The first scenario is improbable in view of the presence of inversion

or the absence of a conserved synteny. Consequently,
involvement of non-homologous recombination, which
can invoke translocation and inversion, may be required.
To date, there is no direct evidence of mitochondrial
DNA recombination in copepods. However, new evidence supporting recombination is emerging in invertebrates including molluscs [55], nematodes [56] and
arthropods [35]. Furthermore, the problematic circular
subgenomic fragment identified in C. sinicus may provide
additional insights concerning mitochondrial DNA
recombination in copepods.
Technical problems during laboratory work

During the experiments an 18.6 kb DNA sequence was
amplified, with reverse complementarity in its 505 bp
long lateral ends. Such a covalent sequence, which

represents a circular DNA molecule, is normally considered as a marker for the achievement of mitochondrial
sequencing. However, the 4.5 kb fragment at the 3’ end
of the sequence was incomplete, with several mitochondrial elements being absent (see Methods section for
details). Extended sequences were successfully determined with step-out PCRs [57], and verified by LongPCR. Therefore, the circular molecule was confirmed to
be a sub-genomic fragment nested within the complete
mtDNA (circular subgenomic fragment). The occurrence
of the problematic circular subgenomic fragment could
be explained by the following scenarios: First, the 4.5 kb
fragment could be nuclear copies of mitochondrial fragments (NUMTs) [58]. NUMTs are normally composed
of fragmented copies shorter than 4 kb [59,60]. Pseudogenes provide another notorious characteristic for the

Minxiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/73

NUMTs [60]. However, sequences of the coding genes
in this problematic fragment compare favourably with
the counterparts obtained from the cDNA templates.
Indel and nonsense mutations were not present. Therefore, because the sequences of coding genes in the
4.5 kb fragment are almost identical to those obtained
from reverse transcriptase PCR (unpublished data), with
only three substitutions in the 1372 nucleotides being
compared, this first scenario is unlikely.
Second, the 4.5 kb fragment could be an artefact of
PCR jumping when site-specific lesions exist or initial
copies in the template are few [61]. Fresh materials were
used for the amplification to reduce the possibility of
PCR jumping as breaks in the template would give rise
to the bouncing of primers. Unfortunately, abnormal
nucleotides or stable stem-and-loop structures in the
unidentified regions may have acted in a similar manner
to breaks, causing the extending primer to jump to
another template during PCR.
Finally, the circular subgenomic fragment could be the
product of mitochondrial DNA recombination. Recombination is normally absent in mitochondrial genomes of
metazoans, but convincing evidence for this process has
emerged [56,58,62,63]. A defined feature of recombination
is the breakage and rejoining of participating DNA strands
[53]. According to Lunt’s recombination model, subgenomic circular molecules with the same gene organizations but smaller in size could be generated during
recombination. The erroneous fragment mentioned above
is consistent with Lunt’s model [53], suggesting that
recombination occurred. The results highlight the possibility of mitochondrial DNA recombination in copepods.
Such puzzles may be common to all copepod studies
and caution should be applied when using long PCR
technology to define complete mitochondrial genomes.
Additional long PCRs are required to confirm whether
the mitochondrial genome sequence is complete.
Phylogenetic analysis

Homogeneity of the stationary frequencies across the
tree is a baseline for current phylogenetic models.
Therefore, amino acid alignments were used for inference of phylogeny as they are more homogenous among
different lineages than nucleotide content [64]. As presented in Figures 7 and 8, monophyly of Pancrustacea
and most of its high-level subtaxa including the classes
Collembola, Diplura, Insecta and Malacostraca, and the
subclasses Copepoda and Cirripedia, were supported
irrespective of the model and method applied. Bootstrap
support values (BP) from maximum likelihood (ML)
analyses were usually lower in the current analysis, suggesting that the phylogenetic signal was weak or that a
competing artificial signal was present. ML analyses are
believed to be vulnerable to several factors including

Page 11 of 20

lineage-specific evolutionary rate heterogeneities and
nucleotide compositional heterogeneities, which can
impede the recovery of phylogenetic signals [16,64].
Hence, this study concentrated on the topology recovered by Bayesian inference (BI), but included ML trees.
Monophyly of copepods was well resolved in the results
and in a former mitochondrial phylogenetic inference
with expanded out-group sampling (Additional file 5).
Consensus has been reached for the monophyly of Copepoda on the basis of morphological and molecular evidence [3,4,65], whereas the phylogenetic relationships
among component orders are still controversial. As far as
the phylogenetic relationships among copepods are concerned, congruent results were obtained from different
analyses during the current research (Figure 9). Harpacticoida (T. japonicus ) and monophyletic Siphonostomatoida ( L. salmonis and C. clemensi) grouped together,
with the cluster containing Poecilostomatoida ( S. polycolpus) and Cyclopoida ( P. nana ) as their sister clade.
The grouping of the four orders, excluding Calanoida,
confirms the monophyly of Podoplea, which is characteristically tagged by the podoplean tagmosis [3]. The basal
splitting of Copepoda separated Calanoida from Podoplea, reflecting the primary status of Calanoida within
copepods. With regard to inter-ordinal phylogenetic relationships within Podoplea, Huys et al. proposed an early
split between MCG-Clade (Misophrioida, Cyclopoida and
Gelyelloida) and MHPSM-Clade (Mormonilloida, Harpacticoida, Poecilostomatoida, Siphonostomatoida and
Monstrilloida), where Poecilostomatoida and Cyclopoida
separated into distinct lineages soon after Podoplea was
formed [3,4,6,65]. However, similar to the results from
Huys, based on 18S rRNA [66], Cyclopoida and Poecilostomatoida exhibited closer affinity in this study, supporting Boxshall’s hypothesis to reunite Poecilostomatoida
into Cyclopoida. This view is gaining support from several independent analyses [7,67]. Accordingly, the present
results support the hypotheses for (outgroups, Calanoida,
((Cyclopoida, Poecilostomatoida), (Harpacticoida,
Siphonostomatoida)).
The position of Copepoda within Pancrustacea is still
unclear; the present analyses produced conflicting results
using different methods. The uncertainty regarding the
position of Copepoda within Pancrustacea is in part due
to heterogeneity in evolutionary rates and nucleotide
compositions within the lineage [64], and may be exacerbated by the derived nature of copepod mitochondrial
sequences. Considering that copepods possess notably
biased nucleotide compositional profiles, the recovery of
the phylogenetic signal may be impeded by lineage-specific compositional heterogeneity. However, exclusion of
strand-biased amino acids does not change the relative
position of Copepoda (Figure 8), indicating that heterogeneous nucleotide composition may not play a key role in

misleading phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, accelerated substation rates of copepods do mask and erode
phylogenetic signals by attracting long-branched taxa
together. One example concerns the previously wellaccepted monophyletic group Branchiopoda [27,65],
which was resolved polyphyletically by clustering A. franciscana with copepods in the original and balanced dataset under the mtArt model. However, analyses performed
with only characters carrying a moderate evolutionary
rate or with the CAT + mtArt, which has been confirmed
as an effective model to overcome the effects of Long
Branch Attraction (LBA) [68], consistently resolved a
monophyletic Branchiopoda clade. Consequently, a possible LBA artefact could be introduced by the accelerated
rate of evolution of the mitochondrial genomes of the
sampled copepods and branchiopod. Therefore, the clustering of A. franciscana and copepods was regarded as a
phylogenetic artefact due to the LBA rather than a sister
grouping.

Minxiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/73

As for the position of Copepoda, four possible sister
groups have been proposed in the present study (Figure 8):
(1) Oligostraca including Ostracoda, Pentastomida, Branchiura [69], (2) Oligostraca plus Remipedia under the
model of mtArt and (3) Branchiopoda, (4) Branchiopoda
plus Malacostraca under the model of CAT + mtArt. It
should be noted that by inspecting branch lengths, Copepoda, Oligostraca and Remipedia are rapidly evolving
lineages. A decrease in support (PP = 0.37) for the close
affinity of Oligostraca and Copepoda was observed in
mtArt trees with the moderate-rate sites. Therefore, their
grouping may be misleading owing to the artefact concerning the LBA, as the mtArt model is vulnerable to LBA
artefacts. Consequently, although only moderately supported (PP from 0.66 to 0.76), the results obtained with
the CAT + mtArt model, in which Copepoda was clustered in the monophyletic clade Vericrustacea, which joins
Malacostraca, Branchiopoda, Thecostraca and Copepoda,
are accepted in the present study. These results are compatible with a previous phylogenetic analysis based on
nuclear protein-coding sequences [69].
The relationships among pancrustacean lineages are
highly unstable, but several interesting findings resolved
using various methods are noted. A monophyletic origin
of Pancrustacea (Figures 7 and 8) is strongly supported
by the current analyses, as recovered by a number of
molecular studies on the bases of sequence data
[16,65,70] or mitochondrial gene orders [71]. In accordance with other mitochondrial studies [72], monophyly
of Hexapoda and Crustacea was rejected in the present
study, although relationships among the component
lineages remain unstable. However, it is noteworthy that
the affinity of Insecta and Collembola was resolved
under the model of CAT + mtArt, while the grouping
of Collembola with Diplura was recovered under the
model of mtArt using only moderate-rate sites. These
results prevent the rejection of the monophyly of Hexapoda on the basis of mitochondrial genomic data alone.
Contradictory conclusions from mitochondrial
sequences and nuclear sequences [69,70,73] mean that
the monophyly of Hexapoda and Crustacea are open
questions. Traditional but controversial Maxillopoda
was resolved paraphyletic/polyphyletic in the present
analyses, where it can be sub-divided into three groups
including Copepoda, Cirripedia and Pentastomida plus
Branchiura. This division of Maxillopoda is in agreement with recent studies based on combined data of
18S rRNA and two mitochondrial markers [65], and
nuclear protein-coding genes [69].
Intraspecific sequence variability and its utility for
population genetic analysis

The major loci were scanned on the basis of the alignment of 11 mitogenomes from four populations for

Page 14 of 20

proper molecular markers. No evidence for recombination in the mitogenome of C. sinicus was detected.
Within the 16,670 bp alignment [GenBank: HQ619228HQ619237] there were a total of 397 variable sites
including 295 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
comprising 191 nucleotide substitutions and 104 insertion/deletion polymorphic sites, in addition to three
microsatellite motifs. A sliding-window analysis was performed to map the distribution of variable sites among
11 individuals in DNAsp [74] (Figure 10). The mean frequency of the variable sites was relatively low (approximately 0.024). LNR3, harbouring two microsatellite
motifs, was most variable, while nad4L was the most
conserved with no changed sites. The “hotspots” bearing
the highest frequency of variable sites were bases 1121612260 with 226 variable sites in 1045 bases (1 in 4.6),
1848-2235 with 22 variable sites in 388 bases (1 in 17.6),
and 649-862 with 10 variable sites in 214 bases (1 in
21.4). The former corresponds to LNR3, and the others
span LNR1 and upstream of rrnL. The gene encoding
cox1 is used wildly as molecular marker for analysis at
the population level [13]. However, a 752 bp stretch
spanning 4016-4767, which is located in the gene of
cox1, has no variable site. The results revealed the conserved nature of cox1 and eliminated the possibility of
its utility in population genetics for C. sinicus. Constant
phylogenetic signals, which distinguish haplotype
groups, were detected in the hyper-variable regions
(unpublished data), underpinning their utility for population analysis.
Non-coding regions are most variable, followed by
PCGs and rRNA genes, with tRNA genes being the
most conserved (Table 2). No deletions or insertions
were identified in the coding regions. Of the 191
nucleotide substitutions, 50.2% were identified as parsimony informative. A distinct bias for nucleotide transitions over transversions was evident, with 87%
substitutions being transitions.
Of the 55 SNPs in PCGs, only 18 can give rise to
amino acid substitutions. The majority of the SNPs
(62.1%) are located in wobble codon positions. Only
14.0% were identified in second positions, all of which
lead to amino acid substitutions. Among PCGs, nad6 is
most divergent (0.00333). As presented in Table 2,
intraspecific dN/dS ratios were either zero or at relatively high levels, ranging from 0.157 for atp6 to 0.914
for nad4. The overall intraspecific dN/dS ratio was 4.14
times larger than the counterpart between species,
which is compatible with a nearly neutral model in
which most amino acid substitutions are slightly deleterious [75].
In terms of the 11 nucleotide substitutions in structural RNA genes, seven were situated in stems and the
remainder in loops. Three substitutions in stems

induced deterioration of stem connections. However,
they were all present at lateral margins, indicating little
influence on the overall secondary structures. As mentioned above, such mis-pairing is considered to be
restored during transcription.
In addition to substitution and indel variations, three
microsatellite motifs were identified at regions from
bases 11492 to 11504, 11645 to 11756 and 13066 to
13095. “TCC” unit is the core repeat for the first motif,
while “TA” acts as a core repeat for the others. The second microsatellite is most variable with repeat numbers
from 10 to 56. With additional subtle sequence variations within the motif, the 11 sequenced microsatellite
loci can be sub-divided into seven alleles.

Conclusions
This study presents the first nearly complete mitochondrial genome of a Calanoida species. The circular subgenomic fragment obtained invoked caution when
analyzing the mitogenome of copepods using long PCR
technology, and may offer additional evidence for mitochondrial recombination.

Although the contents and lengths of individual genes
are similar to other arthropods, the mitogenome of C.
sinicus, one of the largest mtDNAs in crustaceans, is
enlarged by the prevalence and extended length of noncoding regions. The concurrence of multiple non-coding
regions and reshuffled gene arrangement results in the
mitochondrial genome of C. sinicus being remarkably
distinctive from other arthropods. Mitochondrial DNA
recombination may have played an important role in
shaping the present mitochondrial profile of C. sinicus.
The lack of synapomorphic gene arrangements among
copepods raises questions concerning the use of gene
order as a useful molecular marker for deep phylogenetic analysis.
Recovery of the phylogenetic signal in mitochondrial
genomes may be affected a variety of reconstruction
artefacts including lineage-specific heterogeneities for
nucleotide composition and evolutionary rate. In particular, the LBA artefact influenced the results during
analysis. Several methods were designed to reduce the
dilution effect of the reconstruction artefacts. Although
unstable, some inspiring congruent results were noticed

Minxiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:73

in the analyses. Monophyly of copepods and the basal
split between Calanoida and Podoplea were successfully
resolved. The close affinity between Cyclopoida and
Poecilostomatoida in the present study supports Boxshall in reassigning the latter subordinate to the former.
Copepoda was clustered within the monophyletic clade
Vericrustacea, although relationships among the lineages
remain ambiguous. Falsification of Maxillopoda was
confirmed by unveiling its paraphyletic/polyphyletic
nature. However, owing to the limited phylogenetic signals in the mitochondrial data sets, no consensus concerning relationships among pancrustacean lineages was
reached.
Within the 16,670 bp alignment there are a total of
397 variable sites. Indel variations are present in noncoding regions and transitions dominate the nucleotide
substitutions. Three “hot-spots”, particularly the hypervariable microsatellite locus in LNRs, provide rich polymorphisms for population studies.

Methods
Sample Collection and DNA Extraction

C. sinicus for mitogenome characterization were
collected from the Yellow Sea (35.9N, 122.9E) with a
500 μm mesh zooplankton net during a summer cruise
in 2006. The samples were preserved at -80°C pending
DNA extraction. To compare the intraspecific polymorphism pattern of different loci among populations,
C. sinicus from Yangtze estuary (28.6N, 122.1E; 4 individuals), North Yellow Sea (38.7N, 120.7E; 3 individuals)
and Korea (36.9N, 126.3E; 3 individuals) were selected.
Fifty individuals of C. sinicus from the same population (the Yellow Sea) were pooled to prepare a DNA
template for mitogenome sequencing. To avoid the
potential influence of nuclear DNA sequences on mitochondrial origin, crude mitochondria were roughly separated from cell debris and nuclei using differential
centrifugation with a commercial tissue mitochondria
isolation kit (Beyotime, C3606). mtDNA was extracted
using the DIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For
intraspecific comparison, genome DNA was extracted
individually.
PCR amplification and sequencing

Partial sequences of the genes atp6, cytb, nad4 and rrnS
were determined using the primers presented in additional file 6. On the basis of the sequence data obtained,
long PCR primers (Additional file 6) were designed to
amplify the entire C. sinicus mitogenome. Two PCR
fragments with lengths of 3.8 kb and 11 kb were successfully amplified with the combination of primer
cs_cytbF1 plus cs_16sR1 and primer cytbf3 plus
cs_nad4f. PCR reactions were performed using a

Page 16 of 20

Mastercycler Pro gradient machine (Eppendorf) in a
50 μl system containing 30 pmol of each primer, 3 nmol
of each dNTP, 1.5 units of LA taq polymerase and
approximately 20 ng of mtDNA template in 1X La taq
buffer supplied by Takara. The cycle profile was initiated
with a denaturation step of 94°C for 3 min, followed by
33 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 58°C for 30 s, 68°C for 1
min/1 kb, and terminated with a final extension cycle of
72°C for 10 min. The product was purified with an E.Z.
N.A. gel extraction kit (Omega) and sequenced directly
by the primer walking approach (Additional file 6).
Additional primers facing outward were designed from
both ends of the contig. A 4.5 kb fragment, with which
all contigs could be cyclized, was amplified. However,
the absence of atp6 in the amplicon made the results
unreliable. Illegality of the fragment was confirmed by
failure of amplification with primers from dubious
regions.
Step-out PCR techniques [57] were applied for the
remaining mitogenome in two directions, with the primers targeting lateral margins. Despite repeated
attempts, the amplification terminated in certain regions
on both sides. PCR products smaller than 5 kb were
sequenced directly. Some short PCR fragments were
also cloned using PMD-18T (Takara) vector before
sequencing when they were unable to be sequenced
directly. The 11 kb PCR product was sheared into small
fragments of 1-3 kb using HydroShear (Genomic Solutions), and then cloned with PUC19 vector (Fermentas)
after being end-repaired with T4 DNA polymerase
(NEB) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty
clones were sequenced with an ABI 3730 sequencer
from Biosune (Shanghai) company.
On the basis of the mitogenome sequences obtained,
four primer combinations from relatively conserved
regions were designed for screening polymorphism loci
in the C. sinicus mitogenome. Fragments of 1.1 kb to
9.5 kb in length from 10 individuals were sequenced
using the methods described above. Base calling was
performed with phred, and the reads were assembled in
phrap with default parameters [76,77]. All assembled
sequences were manually verified with the aid of
CONSED to remove misassembles [78]. The nearly
complete mitochondrial genome of C. sinicus has been
deposited in GenBank with the accession number [GenBank: GU355641].
Sequence analysis and annotation

DNA sequences were analyzed using the software package Lasergene ver. 7.1.0 (DNASTAR, Inc. Madison) and
Vector NTI Advance 9 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Locations of protein coding genes were preliminarily identified by the ORFs finding method from GeneQuest,
followed by BLAST searching on GenBank datasets. The

Minxiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/73

locations were refined using multiple alignments to
other crustacean nucleotide sequences. tRNA genes
were identified by their proposed cloverleaf secondary
structure and anti-codon sequences using tRNAscanSE1.21 [79] and ARWEN [80] with relaxed settings, and
confirmed manually. Two rRNA genes were determined
by comparing with other annotated crustacean mitogenomes, and reconfirmed using their secondary structures.
Inferred rRNA sequences were aligned with other crustaceans, whose secondary structures have been launched
(rrnS and rrnL obtained from the rRNA database:
http://www.psb.ugent.be/rRNA/index.html) by means of
the program DCSE [81]. The program RnaViz 2 [82]
was used to draw secondary structures of tRNAs and
rRNAs. Secondary structures of the putative control
region, according to the model for arthropods [25], were
estimated using UNAfold [83]. Gene divergence and
synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in
the protein coding genes were calculated with DnaSP
4.0 and PAML 4.3 [84].
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

In addition to the complete mitochondrial genome of
C. sinicus presented here, mitogenome sequences of
another 105 arthropods were retrieved from GenBank.
Information concerning phylogenetic position, gene
order, nucleotides and amino acids of individual genes,
and sizes of mitogenomes, was extracted from the combined datasets using purpose-built perl scripts (Additional file 7). To avoid artefacts due to asymmetric
nucleotide composition, the nucleotide content of a concatenated sequence of PCGs from the initial dataset were
compared. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed with contents of component nucleotides as variables (Additional file 8). The results were used as a guide
for sampling taxa with relatively homologous nucleotide
compositions. The nucleotide composition and strand
asymmetry of some maxillopods are not as balanced, but
they were included for complete taxon coverage. A sample containing 36 species including three copepods was
selected. Amino acid sequences of individual proteins
were aligned using Probalign under the default settings
for protein [85]. atp8 was not included as it was absent
from some taxa sampled. A dataset (Original dataset) of
2646 amino acids with posterior probabilities above five
was accepted for the subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
To explore the signal in the dataset and clarify the placement of Copepoda, two additional datasets were introduced. For the first dataset (Balanced dataset), only
proteins whose nucleotide composition was not significantly strand-biased were included. Since too-rapidly and
too-slowly evolving sites may affect phylogenetic analysis
[64], another dataset (moderate-rate dataset) was constructed by removing classes of rapidly and slowly

Page 17 of 20

evolving sites using the slow-fast approach [64,86], in
which sites were partitioned into quartiles and only those
from the two internal ones were accepted.
To understand phylogenetic relationships among
copepods, two smaller datasets were built (Original and
Balanced datasets). These datasets consisted of six copepods whose complete mitochondrial genomes have been
(almost) entirely determined, in addition to two branchiopods and two maxillopods as out-groups. For the
intraspecific sequence variability analysis, reads from
another 10 individuals were assembled and manually
aligned in BioEdit (North Carolina State University, NC)
using the C. sinicus mitogenome as a template. Alignment was performed on individual genes with sequences
from other copepods using Probalign to estimate
sequence divergence of various loci.
According to preliminary analysis, the CAT + MtArt
model and MtArt model fit the data best and were
selected for further analysis. Bayesian analyses were carried out using MrBayes (MtArt model) and PhyloBayes
(CAT + MtArt model), with an among-site rate variation
under a gamma distribution using four activated categories. Two independent MCMC chains were run simultaneously to determine whether the searching reached
stabilization, and were stopped when all chains converged (maxdiff less than 0.2, but in most of the cases
less than 0.1 for PhyloBayes; standard deviation [SD] of
split frequencies lower than 0.01 for MrBayes). If not,
runs were continued until more than 5000 sample points
were available per run. The ML analysis was carried out
with PHYML 3.0 with 200 bootstrap replicates.
