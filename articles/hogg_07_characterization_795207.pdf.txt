Background

Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative bacterium that
colonizes the human nasopharynx and is also etiologically

associated with a spectrum of acute and chronic diseases.
There are six recognized capsular serotypes (a-f), but the
majority of clinical strains are unencapsulated and are

information

Conclusion: A finite supragenome model was developed to explain the distribution of genes
among strains. The model predicts that the NTHi supragenome contains between 4,425 and 6,052
genes with most uncertainty regarding the number of rare genes, those that have a frequency of
<0.1 among strains; collectively, these results support the DGH.

interactions

Results: We derived high depth genomic coverage of nine nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae
(NTHi) clinical isolates, bringing to 13 the number of sequenced NTHi genomes. Clustering
identified 2,786 genes, of which 1,461 were common to all strains, with each of the remaining 1,328
found in a subset of strains; the number of clusters ranged from 1,686 to 1,878 per strain. Genic
differences of between 96 and 585 were identified per strain pair. Comparisons of each of the
NTHi strains with the Rd strain revealed between 107 and 158 insertions and 100 and 213
deletions per genome. The mean insertion and deletion sizes were 1,356 and 1,020 base-pairs,
respectively, with mean maximum insertions and deletions of 26,977 and 37,299 base-pairs. This
relatively large number of small rearrangements among strains is in keeping with what is known
about the transformation mechanisms in this naturally competent pathogen.

refereed research

Background: The distributed genome hypothesis (DGH) posits that chronic bacterial pathogens
utilize polyclonal infection and reassortment of genic characters to ensure persistence in the face
of adaptive host defenses. Studies based on random sequencing of multiple strain libraries suggested
that free-living bacterial species possess a supragenome that is much larger than the genome of any
single bacterium.

referred to as nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi). The type b
polysaccharide capsular variants (Hib) are associated with
invasive disease, particularly meningitis; however, the introduction of a highly effective vaccine has nearly eliminated this
pathogen from developed countries. Recent studies have
demonstrated that the NTHi form biofilms on the respiratory
mucosa of humans and other mammals and it has been
hypothesized that this contributes to the chronicity of these
infections [1,2]. They are the most frequently detected pathogens associated with both the acute and chronic forms of otitis media (OM) [3] and also are recognized as a seed pathogen
in a wide range of chronic polymicrobial infections of the respiratory mucosa, including the cystic fibrosis lung, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheobronchitis, rhinosinusitis, and mastoiditis [4,5].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R103

terization of the H. influenzae supragenome is a prerequisite
to addressing these issues. In this regard we have sequenced
the genomes of 11 clinical NTHi isolates, 2 by standard clonebased Sanger sequencing and 9 using the new 454-based
pyrosequencing technology. This dataset, combined with the
published genomic sequences of Rd and R2866, constitutes
the largest set of genomic data collected for H. influenzae to
date - the first step towards a characterization of the full complement of genes that collectively define the H. influenzae
supragenome. In this paper we present a global comparative
analysis that characterizes the distribution of genetic diversity among the strains.

Results
DNA sequence data

The NTHi are naturally transformable and their genomes
demonstrate a high degree of plasticity among strains [4,611]. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that
approximately 10% of the genes possessed by each clinically
isolated strain are novel with respect to the reference strain
Rd KW20 and that the distribution of these genes among the
strains is non-uniform [11]. Polyclonal NTHi populations
have been associated with chronic disease as well as with
nasopharyngeal carriage [4,12], while other researchers have
observed in situ horizontal gene transfer in diseased patients
[7,8,13]. The twin observations that the NTHi form biofilms
during chronic infections and that these infections are often
polyclonal suggests that multiple unique strains are co-localized within an environment demonstrated to support greatly
elevated rates of horizontal gene transfer [14-18]. These circumstantial evidences suggest that a genetically diverse population may be important to the fitness of H. influenzae as a
human pathogen and that continuous horizontal gene transfer among co-colonizing strains is the mechanism that generates the diversity observed in the population. It has been
hypothesized that this microbial diversity generation is the
counterpoint to the adaptive immune response of the mammalian host [19]. The distributed genome hypothesis (DGH)
states that the full complement of genes available to a pathogenic bacterial species exists in a 'supragenome' pool that is
not contained by any particular strain, but is available
through a genically diverse population of naturally transformable bacterial strains. The distributed genome is not a
phenomenon isolated to H. influenzae; comparative genomic
studies in other bacterial pathogens, including pneumococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have demonstrated even
greater degrees of genomic plasticity among clinical strains
[20,21]. Moreover, evolutionary studies have demonstrated
that pneumococcus uses competence and transformation as a
pathogenic mechanism [22-24].
Testing of the DGH and its predictions will provide insight
into clinically relevant problems, such as antibiotic resistance, chronic biofilm disease, and serotype-diverse species,
which readily adapt to standard vaccinations. Further charac-

Table 1 lists the 12 H. influenzae clinical strains and the reference strain Rd, a largely non-pathogenic strain, used in the
comparative genomic studies described herein, their NCBI
locus tags, the location where the sequencing was performed,
and their clinical origins. Nine of the clinical strains were
sequenced using 454 LifeSciences novel pyrosequencing
technology [25]. The number of sequencing runs, the extent
of genomic coverage, and the number of contigs resulting
from first and in some cases second pass assemblies are tabulated (Table 2).

Determination of gene clustering parameters
Gene clustering parameters for the grouping of homologs
were empirically determined by minimizing the change in the
number of clusters per change in the parameters (Figure 1).
We hypothesize that this minimum point coincides with the
best estimate threshold for distinguishing true orthologs
from functionally distinct homologs. Some homologs will be
more similar than 70%, while some orthologs will be more
divergent than 70%, but as a uniform criterion, the threshold
is optimized. Visual inspection of the clusters reveals that
most clusters are reasonable. Mosaic genes were particularly
difficult to cluster due to high levels of rearrangement. In the
remainder of the paper, genes in the same cluster are considered to be the same gene.

Enumeration of gene clusters and genic relationships
among NTHi strains
We identified 2,786 gene clusters among the 13 strains (Table
3). Of these, 52% were found in every strain (core genes) and
19% were found in only a single strain (unique genes). The
remaining 29% of genes were found in some combination of
two or more strains, but not all (distributed genes; Figure 2).
The number of clusters found per strain varied from 1,686 in
PittEE to 1,878 in PittII (Table 4). All strains possessed some
unique genes not seen in any of the other strains. A pair-wise
comparison was performed among all possible strain pairs,
which determined the mean number of genic differences
between any two strains was 395 with a standard deviation of
94 (Figure 3). This analysis also identified minimal and max-

A dendrogram based on non-core genic differences (Figure
4a) demonstrates the diversity in the NTHi population. A typical strain differs from its nearest neighbor by more than 200
genes. The strains collected from otitis media with effusion
(OME) patients at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh (designated as Pitt strains) show that a genetically diverse population can be isolated contemporaneously from a single
geographic location from patients with similar indications. In
contrast, two pairs of strains, PittEE/R2846 and PittII/
R2866 are relatively similar despite geographically distinct
points of isolation. Interestingly, the laboratory strain Rd

imal genic differences of 81 and 577, respectively, for the
strain pairs 2866:PittII and 2866:PittAA. The number of coding sequences identified per genome by AMIgene did not correlate strongly with genome size. This is likely due to the
presence of split open reading frames (ORFs) in the 454
sequenced genomes as an analysis of the 4 completed
genomes showed a linear relationship between gene number
and genome size with an R2 = 0.910. In contrast, the correlation between total gene clusters and genome size is 0.86,
implying that the number of distinct genes found on the
genome is linearly related to the genome size.

The topology of the trees is significantly different, both in
terms of pairwise groupings and overall structure.
The identified number of new genes and core genes found per
addition of each genome (as determined by incremental clustering of the 13 strains) shows an exponentially decaying
trend in both cases (Figures 5 and 6). Qualitative inspection
suggests a diminishing return on new genes found in future
sequences, though it is expected that approximately 40 new
gene clusters will be found in each of the next few genomes
that are sequenced. The number of core genes appears to
trend towards a horizontal asymptote near 1,450 genes. A
quantitative analysis of these results is developed below in the
section 'Mathematical development of a finite supragenome

A histogram of gene clusters observed in exactly N of 13 H. influenzae
strains compared to the expected number of genes estimated by the
supragenome model (trained on all 13 strains). Over 1,400 genes were
observed in all 13 strains, indicating that there is a common core set of
genes. Distributed genes appear in variable numbers of strains, from 1 to
12. Overall, the model fits the data well, though it underestimated the
number of genes observed once and overestimated the number of genes
observed twice.

Whole genome alignments reinforce the great
diversity observed among gene clusters
Whole genome alignments were generated between Rd and
each of the 12 clinical strains to quantify genomic insertions
and deletions independently of gene identification (Table 5).
On average, each of the clinical strains had 127 genomic insertions (>90 base-pairs (bp) in length) that did not correspond
to any Rd KW20 sequence. Similarly, each clinical strain contained, on average, 147 genomic deletions (>90 bp) when
compared to the Rd KW20 strain. The average total length of
non-matching sequences between the 12 clinical strains and
Rd was 321 kb, approximately 18% of the genome. The quantity of non-matching sequences reasonably accounts for the
average of 390 genic differences between strain pairs. Figure
7 shows a genomic region in which two different forms of an
insert, homologous to the plasmid ICEhin, have integrated
into the same site of two different genomes, but which is
wholly absent from the other strains in the alignment. Similarly, a 40 kb contiguous region in Rd shows extensive deletional diversity among seven of the clinical strains, with only
two of the clinical strains demonstrating the same local
genomic organization (Figure 8). Interestingly, the two
strains, PittAA and PittEE, that are similar in this region are
highly divergent overall (Figure 3). Genic diversity also exists
on a smaller scale. Figure 9 displays a 20 kb region from 7

information

The comparative genomic data presented above are supportive of the DGH and reinforces the concept that, at the species
level, there is an H. influenzae supragenome that is much
larger than the genome of any single individual strain, and
hence many strains must be sequenced to generate an accurate picture of the species supragenome. Among the questions we may ask about the supragenome, the most obvious is,
how many strains must be sequenced to observe the entire (or
nearly all) of the supragenome?. The problem is similar to
determining the read coverage necessary to sequence an
entire individual genome using a random shotgun library
approach. Lander-Waterman statistics provide an answer in
the latter case by using the assumption that reads are independently and randomly sampled from the genome with
equal probability. Previously, Tettelin et al. [27] developed a

interactions

The codon usage of each gene cluster was compared to the
typical H. influenzae codon usage pattern by the epsilonscore calculated by CodeSquare [26]. A low epsilon score indicates that a gene's codon usage is similar to typical patterns of
the organism, while a high score indicates atypical codon
usage. Since the epsilon score is partially dependent on the
length of a coding sequence, all scores were normalized by
length. The average normalized score is 0 and low values continue to indicate typical codon usage. Figure 12 is a scatter
plot of the normalized epsilon scores versus the number of
strains in which the gene was found. The range of normalized
epsilon values is similar for core, distributed, and unique
genes, though the median values are slightly higher for distributed and unique genes (Tables 6 and 7). The Mann Whitney U-test was employed to determine the significance of this
difference. To eliminate any remaining length bias, only
genes with lengths of 200-300 amino acids were analyzed.
The median normalized-epsilon value of core genes is signifi-

Phage insertion is a common origin of genomic diversity. The
influence of phage was quantified by a homology search
between all gene clusters and the NCBI NT database. A gene
cluster was said to be 'phage associated' if one of the top ten
significant matches was annotated as a sequence of phage origin. Overall, 9.3% of gene clusters were phage associated. The
distribution of these genes is not uniform among core and
non-core genes. Only 0.3% of core genes were phage associated, while 14.6% and 25.8% of distributed and unique genes,
respectively, were phage associated (Table 8).

Global genomic alignments of PittEE against R2846 and
R2866 were performed (Figures 10 and 11). PittEE and
R2846 are very similar at the global level and this is reinforced by the gene cluster analysis, which revealed only 96
genic differences. In contrast, R2866 has a large inversion
and several large insertions and deletions with respect to PittEE. This diversity at the global level corresponds to the 377
genic differences identified between these two strains by cluster analysis (Figure 3). Global alignments were not visualized
for most strains since the ordering of the contigs had not been
determined.

genes, and as a consequence, these non-core genes are more
likely to have foreign origins. Interestingly, there is no significant difference between distributed and unique genes and
most of these non-core genes display typical H. influenzae
codon usage.

A pairwise genic comparison of 12 NTHi strains of H. influenzae and the reference strain Rd KW20
Figure 3
A pairwise genic comparison of 12 NTHi strains of H. influenzae and the reference strain Rd KW20. The comparison of two strains is found at the
intersection of the row and column corresponding to the respective strains. Strains are compared based on the number of genes shared between the pair,
the number of genes found in one strain but not the other, and the number of shared genes that are unique to that pair of strains. A typical pair of strains
differs by 395 genes. Similar pairs of strains are shaded in yellow, while divergent strains are shaded orange.

supragenome model for S. agalactiae that, like LanderWaterman statistics, is based on the assumption that contingency genes are independently sampled from the supragenome with equal probability, except in the case of rare genes,
which are modeled as unique events that appear only once in
the entire global population. The model requires four parameters: the number of core genes, the number of contingency
genes, the probability of finding a contingency gene, and the
expected number of 'unique' genes found per strain. This
model predicted that the supragenome of S. agalactiae is infi-

nite in size (that is, the expected number of unique genes
found in each strain is non-zero). While the model is an
insightful attack on the problem, we question the assumption
that contingency genes are sampled in the population with
equal probability. It is important to compare the existing
model against a new model that does not rely on this assumption.
The Supragenome is represented here by a generative model
that emits genomes according to a set of probabilistic rules.

However, we do not know the true gene class, so we must consider a mixture of binomial probabilities:

The complete model is depicted in plate notation in Figure 13.
'Z' is the hidden class variable in which zn corresponds to the
class of gene n. 'X' is the observed gene variable, where xn,s
corresponds to the presence or absence of gene n in strain s.
The outer plate represents the supragenome, while the inner

The remaining parameters, N and πk, are selected under a
maximum likelihood scheme. Suppose that |S| genomes have
been sequenced and a particular gene from class k was
observed in n of the |S| strains. The probability of this observation is given by a binomial probability since this result is the
sum of independent Bernoulli variables. As a function of πk
and N, the probability is given by:

refereed research

The true population frequencies are, in general, unknown.
Therefore, population frequencies are also treated in a probabilistic fashion. It is assumed that there are K discrete
classes of genes. Each class k has an associated population
frequency, μk. All genes in class k will have population frequency μk. Each of the N genes is assigned to a class according
to a probability distribution given by the vector π, where πk is
the probability that a gene is assigned to class k. Conceptually,
πk is the percentage of genes in the supragenome that have
population frequency μk. The assignment of a gene to a class
is independent of all other gene assignments.

plate represents instances of specific genomes. The model
requires 2 × K + 2 parameters: N, K, a mixture coefficient πk
for each class, and a Bernoulli probability μk for each class.
The number of gene classes, K, and their associated Bernoulli
probabilities, μk, are fixed in advance. Care must be taken to
choose classes that represent low and high population frequencies. Seven classes were selected for this study (K = 7)
with associated probabilities μ = <0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9,
1.0>. The class with probability 1.00 represents 'core' genes
that appear in all strains.

deposited research

The supragenome contains N genes that are modeled as Bernoulli random variables with 'success' probabilities that correspond to the population frequency of each gene. A genome
is generated by observing the Bernoulli variables: a gene is
present if the corresponding trial is a success and otherwise
absent. Each gene variable is assumed to be independent of
all other genes. This assumption is sometimes violated in real
H. influenzae genomes. For example, genomic islands are
sets of genes that are not independent. However, we proceed
with this assumption since it significantly reduces the complexity of the model and is reasonable in many cases.

Plotting of relationships among the sequenced NTHi strains by gene sharing and multi-locus sequence typing. (a) A dendrogram based on genic differences
among the 13 strains of H. influenzae. While several pairs of strains appear to be closely related, there is not a well-defined clade structure. The
dendrogram was generated using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method [44-46]. The number on each branch
corresponds to the number of genic differences from the previous branch point. (b) A dendrogram based on sequence alignments of the seven MLST loci.
The tree was built using the maximum likelihood method implemented in fastDNAml. The number on each branch corresponds to the number of point
mutations per kilobase from the previous branch point. The topologies of the genic and MLST based trees are different. Most notably, strains PittEE and
R2846 are closely related in the genic dendrogram, but are separated in the MLST dendrogram. In other instances, such as PittII and R2866, the strains are
closely related in both trees.

Codon usage of genes is quantified by a normalized epsilon score [26].
Low epsilon scores indicate that a gene's codon usage is similar to the
typical H. influenzae codon usage pattern. The range of epsilon scores is
similar for all three classes of genes: unique, distributed and core.
However, the median scores are significantly different among the classes.
The observation that the distributions for non-core genes overlap with the
core genes suggests that many of the non-core genes have been evolving in
the same pool with the core genes.

observed trend. Figure 2 compares the best-fit gene distribution (based on 8 strain models) to the observed distribution of
genes found in exactly N of 13 strains. Overall, the predicted
trends follow the observed distribution; however, the predictions were too low for genes seen in 1 of 13 strains, and too
high for genes seen in 2 of 13 strains. This bias may be due to
the small sample size (eight strains) used to train the supragenome model. Predictions for genes seen in four to seven
strains were also somewhat lower than observed.

Altogether, the above results show that the supragenome
model generates reasonable predictions for the average properties of the supragenome. To obtain improved predictions,
the model was re-trained on all 13 strains. The supragenome
class distribution for the extended model is shown in Figure
14. The results are similar to the model trained on 8 strains,
except that the class with population frequency 0.01 is now
predicted to contain 2,609 genes, while the 0.10 frequency
class was reduced in size to 590 genes. This large change is
due to improved resolution of rare genes in the 13 strain training set. The model now predicts 5,230 genes, with a 1/100
likelihood interval ranging from 4,425 to 6,052 (Table 9).
Nearly all of the increase over the eight strain model is due to
the class of rarest genes. Of these genes, 1,437 are core genes,
594 are contingency genes with population frequency >0.1,

Number of strains which contain gene

The supragenome model predicted an average of 1,776 genes
per strain with a standard deviation of 14 genes. Of the 13
strains, the average number of genes was 1,793 with a standard deviation of 62 genes. The model predicted an average of
373 different genes when comparing any two strains with a
standard deviation of 17 genes. Among the 13 sequenced
strains, the average was 395 with a standard deviation of 91
genes. In both cases the model predication for average was
reasonable, while the standard deviation was underestimated
by about four-fold. This suggests that the assumptions used
for the supragenome model may omit important sources of
variation. Genomic islands and other genes that appear
together in the genome likely contribute to the total variance.

information

Among the 13 strains examined, 539 unique genes were identified. Our model predicts that most of these 'unique' genes
are derived from a pool of approximately 3,000+ low frequency genes. Of these, 25% demonstrate sequence homology
to phage genes. The codon usage of these genes is often typical, but more likely than core and distributed genes to diverge
from H. influenzae patterns. The origin and importance of the
remaining 75% of the unique genes is unclear. Since these

genes have not been enriched in the population by positive
selection, it is uncertain whether these genes correspond to a
functional role in H. influenzae; however, previous studies
have demonstrated that 100% of the unique genes examined
are expressed as RNA transcripts [11]. It is possible that high
levels of horizontal gene transfer between organisms in the H.
influenzae environmental niche results in a number of
uncommon genes stranded at any particular time point in any
given strain. Evolutionary processes will remove genes not
providing a selective advantage over time, but this may be a
slow process in comparison to the acquisition of genes by horizontal gene transfer. In other words, evolutionary processes
may be unable to 'empty the trash' quickly enough to eliminate all non-useful genes simultaneously. The energetics pen-

other H. influenzae strains. Genes in the core genome are
more likely to display typical H. influenzae codon usage patterns and are rarely homologous to phage-related genes. In
contrast, the distributed genes and unique genes are more
likely to display atypical codon usage patterns for H. influenzae and are more likely to share homology with phage and
other bacterial species, but still the majority of these non-core
genes possess codon usage statistics similar to core genes. In
fact, out of a total of 736 distributed genes observed among
the 13 strains, less than 15% displayed any significant phage
homology. Hence, the core genome is wholly specific to H.
influenzae, while non-core H. influenzae-specific genes are
likely mixed with genes of foreign origin. The subset of contingency genes with typical codon usage patterns and without
phage homology will be important candidates for functional
studies.

alty imposed by a single non-useful gene is likely to be small,
yet the cumulative effect of many such genes could be significant. A balance between the rate of gene acquisition by HGT
and negative selection due to energetics is a likely mechanism
contributing to the maintenance of the overall genome size. It
is also possible that many of these unique genes are recent
functional additions to the NTHi supragenome, but have not
yet had time to become widely dispersed. There are a number
of environmental factors that have been profoundly altered
over the past half century that could account for this, including widespread antibiotic usage and high density human daycare for infants, which results in much higher rates of
polymicrobial respiratory infections.
Our clustering methods were designed to minimize bias due
to frame shifts and assembly gaps. Nonetheless, the number
of clusters identified with these methods may contain some
such bias. Sequencing errors may induce frame shifts that
split a gene into two fragments. Clusters of orthologous genes
(COGs) is a common method for identifying gene orthologs
across a wide range of species. The COG method is able to discriminate between closely related paralogs by using only bidirection best homology matches (BBH) while constructing
clusters [28,29]. Since the COG method requires BBH, if a
split ORF is present, only one of the fragments will cluster
with the full length gene. This results in orphaned 'genes',
which inflate the number of gene clusters observed. To
resolve this issue, we implemented a less restrictive clustering
algorithm that uses uni-direction homology matches above a
minimum sequence identity and a minimum fraction of the
length of the shorter gene. Furthermore, six-frame gapped
translations are used during homology searches to minimize
the impact of sequencing errors. The disadvantage of our
approach is that paralogs may cluster together if the sequence
identity is above the threshold. However, since the genes
under consideration are from the same species, the orthologs
are expected to be highly homologous in comparison to paralogs.
Accurate clustering depends on careful selection of parameters. We started with the observation that sequence identity
among orthologs is higher, on average, than among paralogs.
To find the best parameters, we examined a plot of the
number of clusters as a function of the parameters (Figure 1).
In the case of the identity parameter, a low threshold will
cause all paralogs to group together, which results in a small
number of clusters. As the threshold increases, the number of
clusters increases as paralogs are segregated into distinct
ortholog classes. When the threshold passes the peak of the
paralog distribution, the rate at which clusters split is
reduced. But, as the threshold increases further, ortholog
clusters begin to split, and the number of clusters increases
more rapidly. At 100% identity threshold, all but the most
highly conserved orthologous clusters have been split apart.
Figure 1 reveals an inflection point in the region between 60%
and 70% identity where the slope is decreasing and then

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R103

starts to increase. The inflection point suggests that an identity threshold of 70% defines the best partition between paralogs and orthologs. Analogous reasoning was employed in
determining the match length threshold.
Another bias may be introduced by the use of unfinished
genomes in this study. Despite assembly gaps, the likelihood
that an entire gene is missing from the sequence is low due to
the high coverage (>25×, on average) generated by the 454
sequencing method. Lander-Waterman statistics predict that
more than 99.9% of each genome was sequenced. Most gaps
are due, therefore, not to missing sequences but rather the
difficulty of assembling repeat sequences. On average, 1,769
gene clusters were found per completed genome versus 1,804
for unfinished genomes. This difference is most likely due to
real genomic differences as supported by metabolomic studies (data not shown), but in the worst case the difference is an
upper bound on the error.
An important consequence of our supragenome model is that
the observed diversity among the H. influenzae strains can be
adequately explained by a finite model. This contrasts with
conclusions drawn from models built for the pathogen S. agalactiae [27]. Our study does not contradict previous analysis,
but emphasizes that conclusions are dependent on modeling
assumptions and the species in question. While it is tempting
to assume the supragenome of a naturally transformable species draws from the nearly infinite pool of genomic diversity
found in nature, several factors make it likely the pool is quite
restricted. The first barrier is environment. In the case of H.
influenzae, only species that co-habitate in the human respiratory mucosa are available for genetic exchange on a regular
basis. The second barrier is a set of mechanistic restrictions
built into the transformation system. Uptake of DNA is
enriched by the presence of uptake signal sequences, which
are commonly present in H. influenzae genomic DNA but are
not common in other species [30,31]. After uptake, sequence
homology is necessary for efficient incorporation of DNA into
the chromosome via homologous recombination. Consequently, most HGT events among H. influenzae are expected
to derive from its own population and to a lesser degree from
genetically similar species residing in the same environmental niche. Our model predicts a pool of rare genes in the range
of approximately 2,700 genes - this may reflect the number of
genes available to the organism from genetically similar species living in the same environmental niche. This reasoning
does not exclude the potential importance of rare HGT events
between distantly related species on an evolutionary timescale.
While a global analysis of the supragenome is important, the
ultimate goal is an understanding of the phenotypes associated with individual genes and combinations of genes and
how these contribute to the process of disease. The sequence
data obtained from this study will serve as a valuable tool in
this endeavor. The collection of genes identified here will be

Partial genomic assembly of 454-based genomic
sequences
The 454-assembled PittEE strain genomic contigs were scaffolded against all four of the completed H. influenzae
genomes using Nucmer [34], which indicated the greatest
similarity to strain 86-028NP. Using a maximum parsimony
approach, the PittEE genome was reduced to 12 contigs by a
combination of: sequencing PCR amplicons targeted to fill
gaps between neighboring contigs, as inferred by the scaffolding; and sequencing a 4 kb clone library and searching for
clones that spanned gaps in the 454 sequence. Gap closure
experiments were designed by a custom Perl script, and PCR
primers were designed by Primer3 [35]. Similarly, PittAA was
reduced to 47 contigs by sequencing of PCR amplicons generated following scaffolding. Clones and PCR amplicons were
assembled along with 454 contigs by a modified PhredPhrap-Consed pipeline where 454 contigs were converted to
PHD format files and input to Phrap as long reads [36-39].

Gene identification

DNA sequencing

Coding sequences for all 13 strains, including those previously annotated, were identified by the AMIgene microbial
gene finder adjusted to low-GC parameters and trained on the
Rd KW20 genome [40]. AMIgene builds three Markov models to identify coding sequences with different codon usage
statistics. This provides increased sensitivity for genes of possible foreign origin. Prior to gene calling, all contigs were artificially

using
a

(NNNNNCATTCCATTCATTAATTAATTAATGAATGAATGNNNNN) that provided start and stop codons in all six reading frames, permitting the identification of genes that extend

Complete or nearly complete genomic sequences of 11 unique
clinical strains of H. influenzae were generated and used in
comparative genomic analyses with the two published NTHi
genomes [32,33] in the development of a supragenome
model. Genomic sequence of nine clinically isolated NTHi
strains was generated at The Center for Genomic Sciences by
the 454 Life Sciences GS-20 sequencer using standard protocols [25]. Strains were sequenced to a depth of 16×, or greater,
and assembled de novo by the 454 Newbler assembler to 81
contigs, on average. Lander-Waterman statistics predict that
greater than 99.9% of each genome was sequenced. Regions
of duplicated sequence caused most of the assembly gaps.
Informal comparison between high-quality Sanger reads and
454 data suggest an error rate of less than 1 in 1,000 bases.
Most base call errors are single base insertions or deletions in
homonucleotide repeats that can result in frame-shift artifacts. The other two clinical NTHi isolates (R2846 and
R2866) included in the comparison were sequenced at the
University of Washington Genome Center (Alice Erwin, personal communication). The complete genomic sequences of
H. influenzae strain Rd KW20 and 86-028NP and the incomplete sequences of strains R2846 and R2866 were accessed
through the Microbial Genomes Database of NCBI.

reports

The results reported herein provide evidence of a significant
population-based supragenome among clinical strains of the
NTHi, as well as substantive support for the DGH. The observation that, on average, every clinical strain varies from every
other clinical strain by the presence or absence of over 300
genetic loci is highly suggestive that there is enormous heterogeneity among NTHi strains with respect to their pathogenic
potential. These findings point the way toward future studies
in which statistical genetic approaches could be brought to
bear on the identification of associations between particular
sets of genes within the supragenome, and the discrete clinical disease phenotypes of the individual strains. As these
genic association data become available, it should be possible
to develop next-generation molecular diagnostics to help with
the prediction of disease treatment and outcome based upon
the particular infecting population.

and covered at least 70% of the shorter gene (a detailed discussion of parameter selection is found in the supplementary
materials at [42]). The asymmetric length criterion was chosen to insure that fragmented genes would cluster with the
full length version of the gene. A side-effect of this criterion is
that multi-domain proteins may fuse with proteins that are
composed of a subset of those domains. Significant fasta
matches between genes and genomic sequence were used to
identify sequence conservation between a gene cluster and a
strain. In the event of a significant match (70% identity/70%
length), the matching genome was considered to possess the
gene cluster for purposes of quantifying the number of strains
that contain the gene cluster. See supplementary materials
for a comparison of our clustering methods and the COG
method [42].
Multi-alignments were generated for each cluster using poa
(partial order alignment) in order to visually and computationally verify the integrity of the clusters [43]. If the multialignment of a cluster was less than 120 bp in length, the cluster was filtered as a likely false-positive gene. Finally, an
attempt was made to split false clusters formed by multidomain proteins by searching for point of partition in the
multi-alignment that divided the majority of genes into two
non-overlapping sets. The algorithm was implemented using
a custom Perl script.

Insertion-deletion analysis
Inserted and deleted genomic sequence, in comparison to the
Rd KW20 genome, was identified by maximal sequence
matching performed by Nucmer [34] with the settings -maxmatch -l 16 -o. Non-matching sequence was identified and
quantified by a custom Perl script.

Multistrain local sequence alignments
Multistrain local sequence alignments against reference
sequences (86-028NP or Rd KW20) were generated using
BLASTn [51] by querying the reference sequence against a
database containing the genomic sequence of all 13 strains.
Alignments were then visualized using BioPerl scripts. By the
nature of this alignment procedure, sequence that is present
only in non-reference strains is not visualized. Gene annotations for reference strains were obtained from GenBank.

Phage homology analysis
Phage derived gene clusters were identified by selecting a representative sequence from each gene cluster to use as a
BLASTx query against the NCBI NR (non-redundant) protein
database. GenBank records of the top ten significant protein
matches with e-value >1e-8 were queried for the keyword
'phage'. If the keyword was identified among the matches, the
gene cluster was flagged as 'phage derived'.

Codon usage analysis
Phylogenetic tree building
Two types of dendrograms were generated and compared. A
gene possession-based phylogenetic tree of the 13 NTHi
strains was constructed by defining the distance between a
pair of genomes i and k to be:

∑ gn,i − gn,k
n

where gn,i = 1 if gene n is present in strain i and 0 otherwise.
The strains were clustered based on the distance metric by the
unweighted group average method implemented in the
Phylip package [44-46]. A tree was also generated using
sequence alignments of seven housekeeping genes used in
multi-locus sequence typing [47]. The tree was constructed
using the maximum likelihood method implemented in
fastDNAml as part of the Phylip package [48,49].

Whole genome alignment
Whole genome alignments were generated by Nucmer and
visualized by Mummerplot [34]. MUMmer parameters were
set to -maxmatch -l 16 -o. The order of PittEE contigs was
inferred from optical restriction fragment maps generated by
Opgen (Madison, WI, USA) [50]. Whole genome alignments
were not built for most strains since the ordering of the contigs was not determined.

The codon usage of a representative sequence from each cluster was analyzed by CodeSquare using Rd KW20 mean codon
usage as a reference [26]. The epsilon statistic reported by
CodeSquare was normalized for ORF length dependence
using a best-fit power function for the mean and variance (as
a function of length). Gene clusters were divided into three
categories: core (gene found in all 13 strains), contingency (212 strains), and unique (1 strain). To minimize length bias,
codon usage analyses were limited to genes with lengths
between 200 and 300 amino acids. Significant differences in
the median epsilon statistic were calculated using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.
