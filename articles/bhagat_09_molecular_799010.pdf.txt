Abstract
Background: Yersinia enterocolitica, an important food- and water-borne enteric pathogen is
represented by six biovars viz. 1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Despite the lack of recognized virulence
determinants, some biovar 1A strains have been reported to produce disease symptoms
resembling that produced by known pathogenic biovars (1B, 2-5). It is therefore imperative to
identify determinants that might contribute to the pathogenicity of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A
strains. Y. enterocolitica invariably produces urease and the role of this enzyme in the virulence of
biovar 1B and biovar 4 strains has been reported recently. The objective of this work was to study
genetic organization of the urease (ure) gene complex of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A, biochemical
characterization of the urease, and the survival of these strains under acidic conditions in vitro.
Results: The ure gene complex (ureABCEFGD) of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A included three
structural and four accessory genes, which were contiguous and was flanked by a urea transport
(yut) gene on the 3' side. Differences were identified in ure gene complex of biovar 1A strain
compared to biovar 1B and 4 strains. This included a smaller ureB gene and larger intergenic regions
between the structural genes. The crude urease preparation exhibited optimal pH and temperature
of 5.5 and 65°C respectively, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 1.7 ± 0.4 mM urea and
Vmax of 7.29 ± 0.42 μmol of ammonia released/min/mg protein. The urease activity was dependent
on growth temperature and growth phase of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A, and the presence of nickel
in the medium. The molecular mass of the enzyme was > 545 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.2.
The number of viable Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A decreased significantly when incubated at pH 2.5
for 2 h. However, no such decrease was observed at this pH in the presence of urea.
Conclusions: The ure gene cluster of biovar 1A strains though similar to biovar 1B and 4 strains,
exhibited important differences. The study also showed the ability of biovar 1A strains of Y.
enterocolitica to survive at highly acidic pH in vitro in the presence of urea.

Background
Yersinia enterocolitica, an important food- and water-borne
human enteropathogen is known to cause a variety of gastrointestinal problems. Most commonly, it causes acute

diarrhea, terminal ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis
[1]. Long-term sequelae following infection include reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum [1]. Blood transfusion associated septicemia due to Y. enterocolitica has been

reported to have high mortality [2]. Currently, Y. enterocolitica is represented by six biovars (1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
and more than 30 distinct serovars. The virulence of
known pathogenic biovars namely 1B and 2-5 is attributed to pYV (plasmid for Yersinia virulence) plasmid [3]
and chromosomally borne virulence factors [4].
The biovar 1A strains however lack pYV plasmid and have
generally been regarded as avirulent. But several clinical,
epidemiological and experimental evidences indicate
their potential pathogenicity [5]. Some biovar 1A strains
have been reported to produce disease symptoms resembling that produced by pathogenic biovars [6,7]. These
have been implicated in nosocomial [8] and food-borne
[9] outbreaks and isolated from extra-intestinal sites [10].
The biovar 1A strains also invade epithelial cells [11,12],
resist killing by macrophages [13] and carry virulenceassociated genes such as ystB (enterotoxin), inv (invasin),
myfA (fimbriae), hreP (subtilisin/kexin-like protease) and
tccC (insecticidal-toxin like complex) [5,14]. In the past,
enterotoxin has been thought to be the only major virulence factor produced by biovar 1A strains. Recently insecticidal-toxin complex [15] and flagella [16] have been
identified as virulence factors of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A
strains. However the exact mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis by biovar 1A strains remains unclear and
there is need to investigate the role of other putative virulence factors.
Urease (urea amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.5) has been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of many bacteria
such as Helicobacter pylori, Proteus mirabilis and Brucella
abortus [17-19]. Y. enterocolitica invariably produces urease
which has been reported to enable biovar 1B and biovar 4
strains to survive in the acidic environment of the stomach [20,21]. However, the role of urease in the survival of
biovar 1A strains has not been investigated. The objective
of this study was to determine the genetic organization of
urease (ure) gene cluster, factors affecting urease activity,
and the survival of biovar 1A strain of Y. enterocolitica in
acidic pH in vitro.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A (serovar O:6,30) isolated from
the stools of a diarrheic patient and deposited with Yersinia National Reference Laboratory and WHO Collaborating Center, Pasteur Institute (Paris) under reference
number IP27403 was used to characterize ure gene complex and the enzyme urease. The details of other Y. enterocolitica strains used in this study namely serovars, source
of isolation, country of origin, reference laboratory accession numbers and clonal groups have been reported previously [22]. Y. enterocolitica 8081 (bioserovar 1B/O:8)
was obtained from M. Skurnik (Haartman Institute, Hel-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/262

sinki, Finland). Y. enterocolitica IP26329 (bioserovar 2/
O:9), IP26249 (bioserovar 2/O:5,27), and IP134 (bioserovar 4/O:3) were obtained from E. Carniel (Yersinia
National Reference Laboratory and WHO Collaborating
Center, Pasteur Institute, France). All strains were grown
overnight at 28°C in Luria broth (HiMedia, Mumbai,
India).
DNA extraction, primers and Polymerase Chain Reaction
Genomic DNA was isolated from overnight grown cultures using DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen GmbH) as reported
earlier [14].

Urease gene sequences of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1B and
biovar 4 with GenBank accession numbers L24101[23]
and Z18865[24] respectively were used to design primers
U1 and U2 using PrimerSelect 5.03 software (DNASTAR
Inc., Madison, USA) such that the structural genes (ureA,
ureB, ureC) may be amplified as one amplicon. As these
primers failed to consistently amplify the ureABC region
of biovar 1A strains, primers for amplification of each of
the structural genes separately were designed from the following sequences in the database (accession numbers are
given in parentheses): Y. enterocolitica biovar 1B (L24101,
AM286415), Y. enterocolitica biovar 4 (Z18865), Y. aldovae
(AY363680), Y. bercovieri (AY363681), Y. frederiksenii
(AY363682), Y. intermedia (AY363683), Y. kristensenii
(AY363684), Y. mollaretii (AY363685), Y. rohdei
(AY363686), Y. pestis (AE017042, AL590842, AE009952,
pseudotuberculosis
(U40842,
AF095636) and Y.
BX936398). These sequences were also used to design
primers for ure accessory (ureE, ureF, ureG, ureD) and urea
transport (yut) genes. The most conserved regions for each
of the genes were identified using MegAlign (DNASTAR)
or ClustalW version 1.83 (accessible at http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/clustalW).
Primer pairs - ureA1-ureA2 (for ureA), ureB1-ureB2 (for
ureB), ureC1-ureC2 (for ureC), ureCE1-ureCE2 (for ureCureE and ureE), ureF1-ureF2 (for ureF), ureG1-ureG2 (for
ureG), ureD1-ureD2 (for ureD) and yut1-yut2 (for yut)
were designed from the conserved regions (Fig. 1) with
PrimerSelect software. The sequences of the amplicons
thus obtained (with strain IP27403) were used subsequently to design primers for the intergenic regions and a
remaining part of the ureC gene. The intergenic regions
between ureA-ureB, ureB-ureC, ureE-ureF, ureF-ureG and
ureD-yut were amplified using primer pairs - ureAB1ureAB2, ureBC1-ureBC2, ureE1-ureE2, ureFG1-ureFG2
and ureD3-ureD4 respectively and part of ureC gene by
ureC3-ureC4. As ureD could not be amplified in biovar 1A
strain with ureD1-ureD2, another primer pair ureG1ureD2 was used for amplification of the ureG-ureD intergenic region and ureD gene. The primers were synthesized

from Microsynth or Sigma Genosys. The details of the
PCR primers and the target genes are given in Table 1.
PCRs for ure structural and accessory genes, intergenic
regions and the yut gene were performed using a thermal
cycler (MyCycler, Bio-Rad). The 25 μl PCR reaction mixture contained 100 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 μl of 10 × Taq
buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 μl of 2 mM dNTP,
25 pmol of each primer, and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(New England BioLabs). The details of the conditions
used for amplification are given in Table 1. After amplification, 10 μl of the PCR product was resolved in 2% agarose gel in 1 × Tris-acetate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(TAE) buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0) at 70 V for 2 h. The gels were stained with
ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and photographed under
UV-transillumination in a gel documentation system
(Bio-Rad, CA). The 1 kb and 100 bp DNA ladders (New
England BioLabs) served as molecular size markers.
Sequencing of PCR amplicons, ORF analysis and
phylogenetic relationships
The PCR amplicons obtained above using the genomic
DNA of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A (strain IP27403) were
extracted, purified using QIAquick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly in one or both directions
(Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland or LabIndia, Gurgaon,
India). The sequences were analyzed, edited and compiled using Editseq and MegAlign of DNASTAR. Homology searches for nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences were carried out by BLASTN and BLASTP
respectively. The multiple nucleotide and protein
sequence alignments were performed by MegAlign or
ClustalW. The percent identity and similarity were calculated using MatGAT 2.02 [25]. The theoretical molecular
weight and isoelectric point (pI) of urease structural and
accessory proteins were determined by EditSeq (DNASTAR).

The open reading frames (ORFs) in the compiled ure gene
cluster were identified using GeneMark [26], GeneMark.hmm [27], FGENESB [28] and the NCBI ORF finder
[29] programs. All ORFs were checked further for homology to known protein sequences using BLASTX.
The relationship of urease structural and accessory protein
sequences of biovar 1A strain of Y. enterocolitica to
sequences available in GenBank were determined by constructing phylogenetic trees with the program MEGA 4.0
using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Bootstrap value for
each node of the tree was calculated over 1,000 replicate
trees.

PCR-Restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) of urease genes
Primer pairs ureAB3-ureAB4 and ureC1-ureC4 were
designed to amplify the 1,004 bp and 1,727 bp of ureAB
and ureC genes respectively (Fig. 1). The biovar 1A strains
were chosen such that each belonged to a different serovar, country, source of isolation, REP/ERIC-type [22] and
VNTR01-type [30]. The PCR amplicon of ureAB was
digested with HaeIII and Sau96I while that of ureC was
digested with RsaI and Sau96I. The choice of the restriction enzymes was based on in silico restriction of the
expected amplicons such that DNA fragments were amenable to separation by gel electrophoresis. Restriction
enzymes were from New England BioLabs (RsaI and
HaeIII) or Bangalore Genei (Sau96I). Ten microlitre of
amplified DNA was digested with 2.5 U (HaeIII and
Sau96I) or 5 U (RsaI) of restriction enzyme using appropriate buffer recommended by the manufacturer, in a total
volume of 25 μl at 37°C overnight. The digested products
were separated by electrophoresis in 2.5% agarose gel at
50 V for 5 h in TAE buffer. 100 bp ladder (New England
BioLabs) was used as the molecular size standard. The gel
was stained with ethidium bromide and examined under
UV transillumination.
Growth and preparation of cell free extract
Y. enterocolitica strain IP27403 was grown overnight at
28°C in 20 ml LB medium with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells
were collected by centrifugation (9,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C),
washed twice, and resuspended to 1.5 × 108 CFU/ml
equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard (A600 = 0.1). These
were diluted to 1.0 × 106 CFU/ml and 50 μl of this suspension was inoculated into 50 ml of fresh LB medium, and
incubated further (28°C, shaking at 200 rpm). Samples
were withdrawn at different time intervals up to 78 h and
diluted in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). 0.1
ml of the appropriate dilution was plated, in triplicate, on
Luria agar and incubated overnight at 28°C. The number
of viable bacteria was recorded at different intervals and
CFU/ml was calculated. The log10CFU/ml was plotted
against incubation time (in h).

For preparing lysate, cells grown in 50 ml LB medium
were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice and resuspended in 2.5 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
7.0). Cells were disrupted by sonication with three cycles
(2 s "pulse on" and 2 s "pulse off" for 2 min) at 25%
intensity with Vibra-Cell (Sonics). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to obtain cell-free
extract. The supernatant was transferred to pre-chilled
microcentrifuge tubes and used immediately for determination of urease activity. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford [31] method using bovine serum
albumin (Sigma) as standard.

using a spectrophotometer (UV-1700 Pharmaspec; Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, Md.).
Assays were carried out in triplicate and the amount of the
ammonia released per minute was determined. The quantity of ammonia (in nmol) released was calculated from
the calibration curve obtained from appropriate dilutions
of freshly prepared NH4Cl solution, which was determined to be linear between 20-500 nmol. Data are presented as specific activity of urease, defined as μmol of
NH3/min/mg of protein. Stated values are the mean ±
standard deviation of triplicate determinations.
Biochemical characterization
The optimum pH for urease was determined by measuring activity at pH 1.5 to 7.5. The assays were carried out in
20 mM sodium phosphate (for pH 1.5, 2.5, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5,
7.0 and 7.5) and 100 mM citrate (for pH 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and
5.5) buffers. The optimum temperature for urease was
determined by incubating the extract containing enzyme
with substrate at different temperatures (18-75°C) in the
phenol-hypochlorite assay described above. The kinetic
data (Km and Vmax) of urease were calculated from
Lineweaver-Burk plot of the initial rate of hydrolysis of
urea in citrate buffer (100 mM, pH 5.5). To determine the
effect of growth temperature and growth phase on urease
activity, extracts were prepared from cells grown in shaking at 28°C and 37°C in LB medium for different time
intervals. To determine the effect of urea and nickel on
production of urease, medium was supplemented with
urea (16.7 mM) or NiCl2 (up to 200 μM).
Native and SDS PAGE
Cell-free extracts from different biovars of Y. enterocolitica
were electrophoresed on non-denaturing polyacrylamide
gel [33]. Briefly, extract containing ca. 100 μg of protein
was mixed with 1× tracking dye and loaded on 5% resolving gel in 380 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) with 4% stacking gel
in 63 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) in a mini-Protein III apparatus (Bio-Rad). Samples were electrophoresed with TrisGlycine (pH 8.4) as the running buffer at 70 V for 2 h at
4°C. The gel was removed and equilibrated with 5-10
changes of solution containing 0.02% cresol red and 0.1%
EDTA until the entire gel turned yellow. After draining the
solution, gel was flooded with 1.5% (w/v) solution of
urea. The pink bands of urease were recorded by scanning
(UMAX Astra 3600). Urease from jack bean (Sigma) was
used as the marker.

SDS-PAGE was performed as per standard protocol [34].
Briefly, extract containing 25 μg of protein was boiled in
reducing Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 12%
polyacrylamide gel.

Isoelectric focusing (IEF)
IEF of the cell extract was carried out in 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 2% ampholyte of pH 3-10 (Biolyte
Ampholyte, Bio-Rad). 3-5 μl of extract containing ca. 2025 μg of protein was loaded on the gel and focused at 4°C
using a Mini IEF cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After focusing, the gel was equilibrated with a solution containing 0.02% cresol red and
0.1% EDTA. Urease bands were visualized by superimposing the gel with Whatman No. 1 filter paper presaturated
with cresol red-EDTA solution containing 1.5% urea. Urease appeared as pink band against a yellow background.
Broad range IEF standard with pI 4.45-9.6 (Bio-Rad) was
used as the pI marker to determine the isoelectric point of
the urease.
Survival of Y. enterocolitica in acidic pH in vitro
The in vitro survival of Y. enterocolitica was performed by
slight modification of the method reported earlier [35].
Briefly, ten microlitre of the bacterial suspension was
added to 1 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate (for pH 2.5
and 7.0) or 100 mM citrate (for pH 4.0) buffer with or
without 3.4 mM urea in 0.6% NaCl, and prewarmed to
37°C to give an initial count of ca. 7.0 log10CFU/ml. The
contents were mixed and incubated with shaking at 37°C
for 2 h. At the end of the incubation, samples were
removed and diluted serially in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). 0.1 ml of an appropriate dilution
was plated on LB agar to determine CFU/ml. At conclusion of each assay, the pH of the buffer was recorded. All
assays were repeated at least thrice on separate occasions.
Statistical analysis
The mean and the standard deviation for each data set
were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2003 software
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.). Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t test (Sigma Stat
version 3.5). p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Nucleotide sequence accession number
The nucleotide sequence data of ure gene complex and the
yut gene reported in this paper have been deposited in
GenBank database under accession numbers DQ350880
and EU527335 respectively.

Results
Characterization of urease genes
Primers U1 and U2 were designed to amplify the ure structural (ureA, ureB, ureC) genes of Y. enterocolitica. Although
amplification was obtained with biovar 1B, 2 and 4
strains, these primers did not consistently amplify the ure
structural genes of biovar 1A strains. Thus, new primers
were designed to amplify each of the ure structural and
accessory (ureE, ureF, ureG, ureD) genes separately, and the
intergenic regions so as to encompass the entire urease

gene cluster of biovar 1A strain. Amplicons of expected
sizes were obtained for all genes except ureB and the intergenic regions namely ureA-ureB, ureB-ureC and ureC-ureE
(Table 1). The sequences thus obtained were analyzed for
homology with sequences available in databases, edited
and combined to obtain 7,180 bp sequence of ure gene
cluster of biovar 1A strain (See Additional file 1 for ure
gene cluster sequence).
Seven ORFs were identified in the ure gene cluster of Y.
enterocolitica biovar 1A strain and designated as ureA, ureB,
ureC, ureE, ureF, ureG and ureD (Fig. 1) as in the ure gene
complex of Y. enterocolitica 8081 (biovar 1B, accession
number AM286415). As with Y. enterocolitica 8081, yut
gene which encodes a urea transport protein was present
downstream of the ure gene cluster. All ORFs had ATG as
the start codon except ureG where the start codon was
GTG. These ORFs were preceded by ribosome-binding
consensus sequence. Although ure gene cluster of biovar
1A strain was broadly similar to that of biovar 1B and bio-

var 4 strains, differences were identified. These were smaller ureB gene and ureA-ureB intergenic region and
larger ureB-ureC and ureC-ureE intergenic regions in biovar 1A strain (Table 2). The size of ureB gene of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A was identical to ureB of Y. aldovae, Y.
bercovieri, Y. intermedia, Y. mollaretii and exhibited higher
nucleotide sequence identity to these species than to Y.
enterocolitica biovar 1B or 4. The stop codon of ureG overlapped with the start codon of ureD gene. The G + C content of the urease gene cluster was 49.76% which was
typical of Y. enterocolitica with G + C content of 47.27%.
The comparison of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A ure genes
and the deduced amino acid sequences with that of Yersinia spp. and other bacteria are given in Tables 2 and 3
respectively. Besides Yersinia species, the homologies of
ure genes (upto 76% identity) and their deduced amino
acid sequences (upto 86% identity and 95% similarity)
were significant with ureases from Photorhabdus luminescens and Edwardsiella ictaluri. The UreA, UreC and UreG

proteins were most conserved among Yersinia spp. The
estimated molecular weights, in Da, of the protein subunits were 11,048 (UreA), 15,854 (UreB), 61,026 (UreC),
25,507 (UreE), 25,040 (UreF), 24,181 (UreG) and 36,592
(UreD) (Table 3).
Phylogenetic analysis of urease structural and accessory
proteins of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A showed clustering
with members of gamma-proteobacteria such as P. luminescens and E. ictaluri along with Yersinia spp. (See Additional files 2 and 3). These protein sequences were also
related closely to members of alpha-proteobacteria like
Methylobacterium chloromethanicum, M. extorquens, M. populi and Brucella spp. but were related distantly to other
members of gamma-proteobacteria like Klebsiella aerogenes, P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli.
PCR-RFLP of ure genes
The regions constituting the structural genes namely
ureAB and ureC were amplified in several Y. enterocolitica
biovar 1A strains using primer pairs AB3-AB4 and C1-C4
respectively. Restriction digestion of ureAB region with
HaeIII and Sau96I resulted in almost identical patterns
among all biovar 1A strains (See Additional file 4). But,

differences were clearly evident in restriction profiles of
ureC digested with RsaI and Sau96I (Fig. 2). With RsaI,
strains belonging to clonal group A exhibited profile different from that of clonal group B strains. Thus, it may be
inferred that sequence of urease gene in clonal group A
strains is different from that of clonal group B strains.
The HaeIII and Sau96I restriction profiles of ureAB of biovar 1B, 2 and 4 strains were distinct from that of biovar 1A
strains (See Additional file 4). As with ureAB, restriction
patterns of ureC for these biovars were also quite distinct
from biovar 1A strains (data not shown).
Biochemical characterization
The crude extract of urease of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A
strain was active over a pH range of 4.0-7.0. The maximum activity was observed at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3a). The
enzyme was quite heat-stable as urease activity was
recorded up to 65°C but decreased progressively at higher
temperature (Fig. 3b). The optimum temperature for urease activity was 65°C (Fig. 3b). The urease exhibited
Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km and Vmax of 1.74 ± 0.4
mM urea and 7.29 ± 0.42 μmol of ammonia released/
min/mg of protein respectively (data not shown).

other lanes. For clonal groups refer to [22].

Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A grown at 28°C (optimum temperature for growth) exhibited higher urease activity than
that grown at 37°C (Fig. 3c). Irrespective of the growth
temperature, stationary phase cells showed higher activity
(Fig. 3c). The supplementation of growth medium (Luria
broth) with 16.7 mM urea did not show significant difference in urease activity. However, supplementation with
nickel chloride resulted in ca. 10-fold increase in the activity. 1 μM NiCl2 was sufficient to induce urease activity as
no significant increase in the activity was observed with
further increase in concentration up to 200 μM (See Additional file 5).

On native PAGE, urease was observed as two bands with
the major band having molecular weight > 545 kDa and a
slowly-developing band above it (Fig. 4). The electrophoretic mobility of urease of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A
strain was shown to be different from that of biovar 1B, 2
and 4 strains though similar to the Y. intermedia urease.
The isoelectric point of the crude extract urease was 5.2.
Survival of Y. enterocolitica in vitro
The ability of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strain to survive at
pH 2.5, 4.0 and 7.0 in vitro was investigated. Strains
belonging to other biovars were also studied concurrently.

urease 3 characterization of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A
Biochemical
Biochemical characterization of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A urease. (a) optimal pH for urease activity (b) effect
of temperature on urease activity and (c) effect of growth
phase and growth temperature on urease production;
growth curve of biovar 1A strain grown at 28°C is also
shown. Data points represent mean of triplicate determinations. The error bars indicate standard deviation.

The biovar 1A strain survived at pH 4.0 and 7.0 for 2 h
without significant differences in their viable counts (Fig.
5). However, no viable cells were recovered after 2 h at pH
2.5. In fact, the decrease in the viable counts at this pH
was evident even within 5 min of incubation. The addition of 3.4 mM urea at pH 2.5 was sufficient to increase
the survival of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A equivalent to that
observed at pH 4.0 and 7.0. Similar results were observed
for other biovars also. The pH of the assay medium at the
end of experiment was same as that at the start, suggesting
that increased survival of Y. enterocolitica was not due to
any significant change in the pH.

Discussion
The ure gene cluster of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strain
included three structural (ureA, ureB, ureC) and four (ureE,
ureF, ureG, ureD) accessory genes. The yut gene, which is
required for transport of urea was present downstream of
this cluster. Thus, the organization (ureABCEFGD) of ure

the two enzymes. UreE consisted of histidine-rich motif at
carboxy terminus as in UreE of K. aerogenes, B. abortus,
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, E. ictaluri and Synechococcus [19,36,39,43,44]. A P-loop motif (GPVGSGKT), which
contains ATP and GTP binding sites [45] and probably
provides energy for Ni activation [46] was present at the
amino terminus (positions 19-26) of UreG.

been reported for other species such as Streptococcus salivarius, Synechococcus sp. WH7805, and B. abortus ure-2
operon [19,38,39]. However, important differences were
observed compared to urease genes of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1B and biovar 4 strains. These included differences in
the size of ureB gene and the intergenic regions. Also, the
restriction profiles of ure structural genes of biovar 1A
strains were different from that of biovars 1B, 2 and 4.
These observations indicated that RFLP of urease genes
may be used to study the epidemiology of Y. enterocolitica.
The amino acid residues in the urease structural proteins
namely UreA (γ subunit), UreB (β subunit) and UreC (α
subunit) that are reported to have functional significance
in K. aerogenes urease [40] were also conserved in Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A. The crystallographic [41] and genetic
[40] analysis of K. aerogenes urease has shown that four
histidine residues (His-134, -136, -246 and -272), an
aspartate (Asp-360) and a carbamylated lysine (Lys-217)
of UreC are involved in nickel metallocenter binding. All
these amino acids were conserved at positions His-139, 141, -251, -277; Asp-365 and Lys-222 in UreC of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A. Histidine residues in the α-subunit of
K. aerogenes shown to be important for substrate binding
(His-219) and catalysis (His-320) are present at positions
224 and 325 in α-subunit of biovar 1A [40]. The urease
active-site consensus sequence (MVCHHLD) [42] deviated by two residues (MVCHNLN) in biovar 1A strain.
Amino acid residues with functional significance including His-97 (UreA) and His-39, -41 (UreB) [40] were also

A pH optimum in the acidic range for urease produced by
a neutrophile like Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A was similar to
that reported for Y. enterocolitica biovars 1B and 4, and
Morganella morganii [35,47]. Ureases with optima in the
acidic range reportedly carried a phenylalanine seven residues towards N-terminus, and an asparagine one residue
toward the C-terminus, from the catalytic site [35]. Both
these residues are also present at respective positions in
UreC of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A. The maximal activity of
urease at 65°C by Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A has also been
reported for other bacteria [44]. A low Km of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A urease as in biovar 4 strains [47], indicated
its high affinity for urea. This suggested that the enzyme
might function quite normally in the gut despite low concentrations (1.7-3.4 mM) of the urea available there. Also,
consistent with our observation, organisms which produce urease with low Km have been reported to possess
urea transport (yut) gene as seen in S. salivarius, Lactobacillus fermentum, Bacillus sp. strain TB-90 and B. suis [48].
The cultural conditions which affected production of urease by Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A included growth phase,
growth temperature and availability of nickel ions. The
expression of bacterial ureases is known to be either constitutive or induced by factors like low nitrogen, urea or
pH [49]. The maximal urease activity during stationary
phase of the growth and at 28°C as observed for Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strain was consistent with that of biovar
4 strains [47]. In Y. enterocolitica, several other virulence
factors such as invasin, Myf fibrillae and enterotoxin have
also been reported to be regulated by growth phase and
the growth temperature [50]. A 10-fold increase in urease
activity following supplementation of growth medium
with nickel was not accompanied by increase in the
expression of urease structural proteins suggesting that
increased activity was probably due to the activation of
pre-existing apoenzyme. Nickel has been reported to regulate both expression and activity of urease in H. pylori
[51]. In silico analysis of whole genome of Y. enterocolitica
8081 (biovar 1B) revealed two systems (ureH and ynt) for
transport of nickel. It would be interesting to determine

the role of multiple nickel transport genes in urease activity and its regulation in Y. enterocolitica.
The Mw of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A urease as assessed
from native PAGE was > 545 kDa. The molecular mass of
urease is known to vary from as low as 130 kDa in B. suis
[52] to as high as 620 kDa in Providencia rettgeri or > 700
kDa in M. morganii [53]. The difference in the molecular
mass of urease of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A vis-à-vis Y. enterocolitica biovar 1B and biovar 4 seems to be due to difference in the size of UreB (β-subunit), which is smaller in
the former and thus may account for its lower molecular
mass. The isoelectric point (pI) of 5.2 of biovar 1A urease
was close to that reported for Proteus penneri (pI = 5.1) and
H. pylori (pI = 5.9) urease [33,54]. No data on molecular
mass and isoelectric point of ureases produced by Y. enterocolitica strains belonging to other biovars has been
reported.
The ability of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strains to survive
at pH 2.5 in vitro in the presence of 3.4 mM urea implicated urease in their survival. This suggested the possible
role urease might play in the survival of Y. enterocolitica
biovar 1A under acidic conditions in the gut. However,
this needs to be confirmed by comparison of wild type
strain with an isogenic urease mutant. The role of urease
in survival during transit through gut has been reported
for B. suis, B. abortus, H. pylori and E. ictaluri
[18,19,36,55,56]. Interestingly, the biovar 1A strains have
also been reported to resist killing, and survive within
macrophages [13]. It would therefore be worthwhile to
determine the role urease may play in the survival of Y.
enterocolitica biovar 1A strains in the acidic environment
of phagolysosomes.

Conclusions
The ure gene cluster of Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A though
broadly similar to that of biovar 1B and biovar 4 strains
showed differences in structural (ureB) genes and the
intergenic regions thereof. The kinetic data indicated that
urease produced by Y. enterocolitica biovar 1A strain would
be active at low concentration of urea typically present in
the gut. The ability of biovar 1A strain to survive at acidic
pH in the presence of urea suggested that urease might
play role in their survival in the gut. This however needs
to be corroborated using ure isogenic mutants.
