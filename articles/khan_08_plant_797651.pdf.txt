Abstract
Background: Endophytic fungi are known plant symbionts. They produce a variety of beneficial metabolites for plant
growth and survival, as well as defend their hosts from attack of certain pathogens. Coastal dunes are nutrient deficient
and offer harsh, saline environment for the existing flora and fauna. Endophytic fungi may play an important role in plant
survival by enhancing nutrient uptake and producing growth-promoting metabolites such as gibberellins and auxins. We
screened roots of Ixeris repenes (L.) A. Gray, a common dune plant, for the isolation of gibberellin secreting endophytic
fungi.
Results: We isolated 15 endophytic fungi from the roots of Ixeris repenes and screened them for growth promoting
secondary metabolites. The fungal isolate IR-3-3 gave maximum plant growth when applied to waito-c rice and Atriplex
gemelinii seedlings. Analysis of the culture filtrate of IR-3-3 showed the presence of physiologically active gibberellins,
GA1, GA3, GA4 and GA7 (1.95 ng/ml, 3.83 ng/ml, 6.03 ng/ml and 2.35 ng/ml, respectively) along with other physiologically
inactive GA5, GA9, GA12, GA15, GA19, GA20 and, GA24. The plant growth promotion and gibberellin producing capacity
of IR-3-3 was much higher than the wild type Gibberella fujikuroi, which was taken as control during present study. GA5,
a precursor of bioactive GA3 was reported for the first time in fungi. The fungal isolate IR-3-3 was identified as a new
strain of Penicillium citrinum (named as P. citrinum KACC43900) through phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA sequence.
Conclusion: Isolation of new strain of Penicillium citrinum from the sand dune flora is interesting as information on the
presence of Pencillium species in coastal sand dunes is limited. The plant growth promoting ability of this fungal strain may
help in conservation and revegetation of the rapidly eroding sand dune flora. Penicillium citrinum is already known for
producing mycotoxin citrinin and cellulose digesting enzymes like cellulase and endoglucanase, as well as xylulase.
Gibberellins producing ability of this fungus and the discovery about the presence of GA5 will open new aspects of
research and investigations.

Background
Gibberellins (GAs) is a family of diterpenoid plant hormones, first detected in 1930s from culture filtrates of Gibberella fujikuroi, a known pathogen of rice plants [1,2]. In
1956, GA was isolated and identified as plant hormone
from the extracts of higher plants [3]. GA appear to be
involved in every aspect of plant growth and development, but their most typical (and spectacular) property is
the enhancement of stem growth [4]. GA may modify the
sex expression of flowers, induce the parthenocarpic
development of fruit and delay senescence. They obviate
the need for exposure to red light in the germination of
seeds and spores, and the need for vernalisation in the
growth of bulbs and tubers. They are associated with the
breaking of winter dormancy and stimulate the formation
of hydrolytic enzymes in germinating cereal grain [5].
Currently 136 GAs have been identified, while 12 fungi,
pathogenic and non-pathogenic, associated with plants
and/or soil has been reported as GA producers [6,7].
Endophytic fungi have been found to colonize the roots
of plants [8] and have usually been defined as those fungi
growing asymptomatically within the tissues of their host
plants, excluding pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizae
[9,10]. This relationship is subjected to change and
replacement by other endophytes depending on environmental conditions [11] and host requirement. Fungal
endophytes of roots can therefore be defined as those
fungi located within apparently healthy, functional root
tissues at the moment of sample collection [8]. Unlike
mycorrhizal fungi, endophytes reside entirely within host
tissues and may emerge during host senescence [12].
Endophytes have been shown to confer fitness benefits to
host plants including tolerance to herbivory, heat, salt,
disease, and drought, and increased below- and aboveground biomass [8,13-17]. Endophytic colonization may
also improve the ecological adaptability of the host by
enhancing tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses [11,18].
Penicillium citrinum has been reported as common endophytic fungus of cereal plants like wheat and soybean. It
had been isolated from different environmental conditions, ranging from permafrost sediments to agricultural
fields and forest soils. It is most vigorously studied laboratory taxon that gained importance after discovery of
well-known mycotoxin citrinin. Currently it is being
explored for different secondary metabolites it can produce and their associated benefits [19-23].
Sand dunes in coastal regions of South Korea are being
destroyed due to anthropogenic disturbances such as military action as well as beach construction and recreational
activities. The intensity of artificial activities had affected
the speed and efficiency of their conservation and revegetation [24,25]. We investigated root endophytic fungi of
sand-dune flora for GAs production as such work had not
been carried out in the past. This paper report screening of

Ixeris repens, a common plant of sandy beaches across East
Asian countries [25,26] for plant growth promoting
metabolites by root endophytic fungi.

Results
Screening for plant growth promoting activity of fungal
metabolites on waito-c rice
Fifteen endophytic fungi were isolated from roots of Ixeris
repens, collected from sand dune at Pohang beach, Korean
peninsula. The fungal culture filtrates were applied on
waito-c rice seedlings and the length of seedlings was
checked after one week of fungal culture filtrate application. Out of 15 isolated fungi, 2 fungal isolates considerably promoted shoot lengths of rice seedlings. The fungal
isolate IR-3-3 gave maximum plant and shoot length of
22.35 cm and 12.60 cm respectively, while culture filtrate
of IR-10-3 gave plant height of 17.75 cm and shoot length
of 7.1 cm. The plant and shoot growth promotion by G.
fujikuroi was much lower than IR-3-3, which was thus
selected for further investigation (Figure 1).
Bioassy of IR-3-3 for plant growth promoting activity on
Atriplex gemelinii
Since the growth rate of sand dune plants are much
slower, shoot lengths of Atriplex gemelinii seedlings treated
with IR-3-3 culture filtrate were measured after 15 days of
culture filtrate application. The growth promoting capacity of IR-3-3 was compared with the results obtained from
the application of culture filtrate of wild type G. fujikuroi
and Czapek broth, separately. Since Czapek medium contain nutrients, its control was used to observe possibility
of nutrients effect on shoot elongation. Shoot length of
IR-3-3 culture filtrate treated seedlings was 3.6 cm, which
was higher than that of G. fujikuroi culture filtrate (3.1 cm)
and Czapek broth (2.0 cm) treated seedlings (Figure 2).
Analyses of culture filtrate of IR-3-3 for the presence of
gibberellins
Gibberellins analysis showed the presence of GA1 (1.95
ng/ml), GA3(3.83 ng/ml), GA4 (6.03 ng/ml), GA5 (0.365
ng/ml), GA7 (2.35 ng/ml), GA9 (0.65 ng/ml), GA12 (0.11
ng/ml), GA15 0.72 ng/ml), GA19 (0.67 ng/ml), GA20 (0.30
ng/ml) and GA24 (1.40 ng/ml) in culture filtrate of IR-3-3.
Among them, GA1, GA3, GA4 and GA7 are physiologically
active GAs (See Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 for GC-MS SIM
spectra of these GA). Fungal isolate IR-3-3 showed higher
GAs productivity than wild type G. fujikuroi (see Figure 3).
Important finding was the detection of GA5 in the culture
filtrates of fungal isolate IR-3-3 and wild type G. fujikuroi
(See Additional files 5 and 6 for GC-MS SIM spectra of this
GA).
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis of fungal isolate IR-3-3 was carried out by distance tree construction. We aligned ITS1
sequences of available P. citrinum through BLAST

conducted in 3 replicates; standard deviation from means was calculated using MS-EXCEL. Whole plant lengths as well as shoot
lengths were increased after 7 days of treatment with culture filtrate. Culture filtrates of IR-3-3 caused shoot elongation more
than that by G fujikuroi (Control III), but whole plant length was about same for both indicating little or no effect of filtrate on
root elongation.

sequence using ClustalW and a neighbour joining tree was
constructed from 22 (21 references and 1 clone) aligned
sequences. A. fumigatus was used as an out group for tree
rooting. The fungal isolate IR-3-3 gave 95% bootstrap support for a monoclade of P. citrinum strains (1000 bootstrap replications), thus suggesting IR-3-3 as a new strain
of P. citrinum (Figure 4).

Discussion

fungal strains were determined through a primary screening experiment on waito-c rice seedlings. Use of rice seedlings is beneficial as they easily grow under controlled and
sterilized conditions, hydroponically, using autoclaved
water-agar media. Since this media is devoid of any nutrient, the sole effect of culture filtrate can easily be estimated. Waito-c rice is a known dwarf rice cultivar with
reduced GA biosynthesis. Treatment of its seeds with uniconazol, a GA biosynthesis retardant, further suppresses
the endogenous GAs production by blocking its biosynthesis pathway in the plant. Shoot elongation of these
seedlings can be easily attributed to the activity of plant
growth promoting secondary metabolites from fungal culture filtrates [27,28]. The microbial extracts had been and
will continue to be a productive source of biologically
active compounds [8]. Screening of microbial secondary
metabolites is an established method for the identification of novel and biologically active molecules [29-32].

Endophytic fungi form mutualistic interactions with their
host, the relationship therefore being beneficial for both
partners [8]. Mutualism frequently leads to enhanced
growth of the host. In current study, the presence of plant
growth promoting metabolites in culture filtrates of our

The plant growth promoting capacity of fungal secondary
metabolites was confirmed by conducting a bioassay
experiment on seedlings of Atriplex gemelinii, a commonly
occurring plant of sandy shores in China, Japan and Korea

On the basis of sequence homology and phylogenetic
analysis, isolate IR-3-3 was thus identified as a new strain
of P. citrinum. The ITS1 sequence of this strain has been
submitted to GenBank database [GenBank: EU821333].
The fungal isolate was deposited to the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC) and was allotted no.
KACC43900. The IR-3-3 was thus named as P. citrinum
KACC43900.

Effect of IR-3-3 culture filtrate on Atriplex gemelinii seedlings after 15 days of application
Effect of IR-3-3 culture filtrate on Atriplex gemelinii seedlings after 15 days of application. The experiment was performed in 3 replicates; standard deviation from means was calculated using MS-EXCEL. Shoot lengths of seedlings were
increased after 15 days of culture filtrate treatment. IR-3-3 culture filtrate treated seedlings showed increased shoot lengths
than those by wild type G fujikuroi indicating possibility of GAs production as secondary metabolite by the strain.
[26]. Seeds of this plant did not exhibit dormancy, and
germinate by soaking in water in a week time. Being duneplant, it showed adaptation to nutrient deficiency, growing in hydroponic media (0.8% water-agar) without any
supply of nutrient solution. Although germination is
rapid in these plants, but they possess slow growth rate
(0.5 m annually), therefore the seedling length was much
lower than those of rice. However, considerable increase
in its shoot lengths was observed, when treated with IR-33 as compared to control. Current findings confirmed the
previous reports of shoot length promotion by fungal culture filtrate application [27,28].
GA analysis of the culture filtrates of IR-3-3 and G.
fujikuroi showed that bioactive GA production capacity of
IR-3-3 was much higher than wild type G. fujikuroi, which
narrates the significance of this newly isolated fungal
strain. The discovery of GA5 in the culture filtrates of both
IR-3-3 and G. fujikuroi will lead to the modification of fungal GA biosynthesis pathway by providing the missing
links for GA biosynthesis in fungi. Gibberellins were analyzed with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GCMS), which is a useful tool because of its ability to analyze

highly complex mixtures and to detect compounds of different classes simultaneously. GC-MS techniques have
been used in clinical medicine and were only recently
introduced in plant research [30,33,34]. Recently,
advances of mass spectrometry in food-related research
[35] and aroma analysis [36] have been reported. Phytohormones quantification by GC-MS-SIM is well established and most reliable technique in ongoing
investigations worldwide [27,28,37-39]. The major
advantage of GC-MS is its unbiased character. In comparison with non-MS detection based chromatographic techniques (HPLC-DAD, GC-FID), where only compounds
targeted by a special analytical protocol are found, GC-MS
analysis can result in interesting and unexpected new
knowledge about a particular extract [40]. Quantitative
analysis is done by acquiring compound-specific molecular ions in selected ion monitoring (SIM) to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MS experiment [41].
Approximately 70â80,000 species of fungi exists [42].
Due to possible existence of different morpho/biotypes of
fungi within single species, traditional morphological and
biochemical methods are not considered reliable for iden-

tification [31]. On the other hand, DNA sequence analysis
methods are objective, reproducible and rapid means of
identification, and thus gaining importance and have
commonly been used to identify non sporulating endophytes [43-45]. We used 5.8S gene and flanking ITS1/4
regions for fungal identification. It is because highly conserved 5.8S gene is suitable for higher taxanomic level
analysis while highly variable ITS regions are useful for
analysis at lower taxanomic levels [42,46,47]. Constructing phylogenetic tree is crucial in molecular identification,
since BLAST search alone cannot overcome possibilities of
statistical errors. Bootstrap consensus is applied to the
constructed tree so as to read maximum sequence replications. Neighbour joining tree with bootstrapping gave us
a clear picture for identifying fungal isolate IR-3-3. It is
because more than 100 BLAST hits belonged to Penicillium
genera, thus strongly recommending our isolate as a
member of this group. Although many phylogenetic trees
exist and are used for analysis, neighbour-joining method
has been designated most reliable tree construction
method especially when dealing with closely related
strains under varying rates of evolution [48,49].

plants. Under environmental stress condition like that of
coastal zones, waterlogged and barren lands with few
plants, the endophytic fungi with extraordinary metabolites might be isolated and identified, and their metabolites can be used for human and environmental benefits.
Further studies with P. citrinum KACC43900 regarding
characterization of GAs encoding genes and optimization
of GAs production media are suggested.

The root samples were washed with tap water to remove
sand particles and other debris, treated with Tween 80

From our study we can conclude that root endophytic

solution and surface sterilized using perchloric acid (1%)
solution. The surface sterilized roots were then cut into
0.5 cm pieces in laminar flow hood, cultured on Hagem
media plates and, incubated at 25Â°C until emergence of
fungi from inside of root pieces [53,54]. The isolated pure
cultures of root fungi were stored on PDA plates and
slants. Effectiveness of surface sterilization procedure was
determined by imprinting sterilized root pieces on Hagem
plates. Absence of any microbial growth on imprinted
plates after 4â7 days of incubation were considered
enough for effective surface sterilization of roots.
Screening of fungal culture filtrate for plant growth
promoting metabolites on rice
The culture filtrate of fungal isolate was bioassayd on
waito-c rice seedlings for the presence of plant growth promoting metabolites. For this purpose, the fungal isolate
was grown in Czapek broth medium, on a shaking incubator for 7 days at 30Â°C and 120 rpm. Forty ml of culture
fluid was harvested through centrifugation at 5000 Ã g at
4Â°C for 15 min. The harvested pellet and supernatant
were immediately stored at -70Â°C and later lyophilized.
The lyophilized supernatant was mixed with 1 ml autoclaved distilled water. Surface sterilized seeds [55] were
incubated overnight with Uniconazol (Sumitomo Heavy
Chemical Co. Ltd., Takarazuka, Japan), 20 ppm (in autoclaved distilled water), to further minimize activity of seed
coat gibberellins. The treated seeds were washed thoroughly and soaked in autoclaved distilled water until radical emergence. The young seedlings were transplanted in
glass tubes containing 0.8% water-agar medium and
grown in a growth chamber. A 10 Î¼l of supernatant solution of fungal culture filtrate was applied on apical meristem of rice seedlings at two leaves stage. The shoot and
plant length was observed after a week of culture filtrate
application and compared with waito-c rice seedlings
treated either with distilled water or culture filtrate of G.
fujikuroi.
Bioassay on Atriplex gemelinii
The surface sterilized seeds [55] of Atriplex gemelinii were
treated with uniconazol and then soaked in autoclaved
distilled water for germination. The two leaves stage seedlings were treated with culture filtrate (10 ul) of fungal
strain IR-3-3. The shoot lengths were recorded after 15
days and compared with control treatments.
Extraction and quantification of gibberellins
Fungal gibberellins (GAs) were extracted from culture filtrates after 7 days of incubation in Czapek broth according to an established protocol [56]. Extracted GAs were
subjected to reverse-phase C18-HPLC. The GAs were chromatographed on a 3.9 Ã 300 mm Î¼ Bondapak, C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) and eluted at 1.5
ml min-1 with the following gradient: 0 to 5 min, isocratic

28% MeOH in 1% aqueous acetic acid; 5 to 35 min, linear
gradient from 28 to 86% MeOH; 35 to 36 min, 86 to
100% MeOH; 36 to 40 min, isocratic 100% MeOH. Up to
forty fractions of 1.5 ml each were collected. The fractions
were then prepared for gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) with selected ion monitoring (SIM)
(6890N network GC system, and 5973 network mass
selective detector; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA,
USA). For each GA, 1 Î¼l of sample was injected in a 30 m
Ã 0.25 mm (i.d.), 0.25 Î¼m film thickness DB-1 capillary
column (J & W Scientific Co., Folsom, CA, USA). The GC
oven temperature was programmed for a 1 min hold at
60Â°C, then to rise at 15Â°C min-1 to 200Â°C followed by
5Â°C min-1 to 285Â°C. Helium carrier gas was maintained at
a head pressure of 30 kPa. The GC was directly interfaced
to a Mass Selective Detector with an interface and source
temperature of 280Â°C, an ionizing voltage of 70 eV and a
dwell time of 100 ms. Full scan mode (the first trial), three
major ions of the supplemented [2H2] GAs internal standards (obtained from Prof. Lewis N. Mander, Australian
National University, Canberra, Australia) and the fungal
gibberellins were monitored simultaneously. The retention time was determined using hydrocarbon standards to
calculate the KRI (Kovats Retention Index) value, while
the GAs quantification was based on peak area ratios of
non-deuterated (extracted) GAs to deuterated GAs.
Genomic DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis
An efficient method was developed for the isolation of
genomic DNA from endophytic fungi, because usual
CTAB extraction method and mycelial grinding was causing DNA shearing. Rich mycelial culture was obtained by
growing fungus in Czapek culture broth (supplemented
with 1% glucose and peptone) for 7 days on rotary shaking incubator (120 rpm and 28Â°C), and lyophilized for
24 hrs. A 0.5 g of lyophilized sample was broken carefully
in 2 ml eppendorf, with blunt end spatula or glass rod.
Double volume of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL, pH8.0;
10 mM EDTA; 1% SDS) containing 1% of 2- mercaptoethanol was added. The mixture was vortexed briefly (30 sec)
to obtain homogeneity and left to incubate for 2 hr in
water bath set at 55Â°C. 250 Î¼l/ml of pre-heated 4% CTAB
extraction buffer was added to lysed cells mixture and
incubated further at 65Â°C for 1 hr. Chloroform extraction
followed by iso-propanol precipitation yielded condensed strand of nucleic acid, which was cleaned from
RNA using 10 ul of RNase A for 2 hr of incubation at
37Â°C. The isolated DNA was suspended in 50 ul of autoclaved deionized distilled water and tested for purity and
quantity by agarose gel electrophoresis.
PCR and identification
Fungal isolate was identified by sequencing internal transcribed region (ITS) of 18S rDNA, using universal primers
ITS-1 (5'-TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G-3') and ITS-4

(5'-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3'). A 25 Î¼l of PCR
mixture contained 2.5 Î¼l of dNTPs and Ex-Taq buffer, 2 Î¼l
of each primer, 0.5 Î¼l of DNA sample, and 0.2 Î¼l of Ex-Taq
polymerase. Rest volume was adjusted with 15.3 Î¼l of
autoclaved deionized distilled water. The reaction cycle
consisted of 2 min of initial denaturation at 95Â°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec denaturation time (95Â°C), 60
sec of annealing (55Â°C) and 30 sec of extension (72Â°C),
and a final extension time of 5 min at 72Â°C. The resultant
product was gene cleaned using Nucleogen gene clean kit,
ligated in T-vector using Takara Perfect T-cloning kit, and
then inserted into DHÎ± E. coli mutant cells (RBC) by overnight incubation (37Â°C). Plasmids with inserts were
extracted using SolGent Plasmid mini-prep kit, and
sequenced.

Phylogenetic analysis
The BLAST search program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST/ was used to look for nucleotide sequence homology for 18S ITS (1/4) region for fungi. The obtained
sequences were aligned by ClustalW using MEGA version
4.0 software [57], and the neighbor-joining tree was generated using same software. Bootstrap replication (1000
replications) was used for a statistical support for the
nodes in the phylogenetic tree.
