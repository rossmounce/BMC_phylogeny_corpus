Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic position of Bryozoa is one of the most controversial issues in metazoan
phylogeny. In an attempt to address this issue, the first bryozoan mitochondrial genome from Flustrellidra
hispida (Gymnolaemata, Ctenostomata) was recently sequenced and characterized. Unfortunately, it has
extensive gene translocation and extremely reduced size. In addition, the phylogenies obtained from the
result were conflicting, so they failed to assign a reliable phylogenetic position to Bryozoa or to clarify
lophophorate phylogeny. Thus, it is necessary to characterize further mitochondrial genomes from slowlyevolving bryozoans to obtain a more credible lophophorate phylogeny.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genome (15,433 bp) of Bugula neritina (Bryozoa, Gymnolaemata,
Cheilostomata), one of the most widely distributed cheliostome bryozoans, is sequenced. This second
bryozoan mitochondrial genome contains the set of 37 components generally observed in other
metazoans, differing from that of F. hispida (Bryozoa, Gymnolaemata, Ctenostomata), which has only 36
components with loss of tRNAser(ucn) genes. The B. neritina mitochondrial genome possesses 27 multiple
noncoding regions. The gene order is more similar to those of the two remaining lophophorate phyla
(Brachiopoda and Phoronida) and a chiton Katharina tunicate than to that of F. hispida. Phylogenetic analyses
based on the nucleotide sequences or amino acid residues of 12 protein-coding genes showed consistently
that, within the Lophotrochozoa, the monophyly of the bryozoan class Gymnolaemata (B. neritina and F.
hispida) was strongly supported and the bryozoan clade was grouped with brachiopods. Echiura appeared
as a subtaxon of Annelida, and Entoprocta as a sister taxon of Phoronida. The clade of Bryozoa +
Brachiopoda was clustered with either the clade of Annelida-Echiura or that of Phoronida + Entoprocta.
Conclusion: This study presents the complete mitochondrial genome of a cheliostome bryozoan, B.
neritina. The phylogenetic analyses suggest a close relationship between Bryozoa and Brachiopoda within
the Lophotrochozoa. However, the sister group of Bryozoa + Brachiopoda is still ambiguous, although it
has some attractions with Annelida-Echiura or Phoronida + Entoprocta. If the latter is a true phylogeny,
lophophorate monophyly including Entoprocta is supported. Consequently, the present results imply that
Brachiozoa (= Brachiopoda + Phoronida) and the recently-resurrected Bryozoa concept comprising
Ectoprocta and Entoprocta may be refuted.

Background
Bryozoans (ectoprocts), also known as "moss animals",
are aquatic organisms that mostly live in colonies of interconnected individuals. They usually encrust rocky surfaces, shells or algae. They are an ecologically important
group, with the marine species forming a dominant component of benthic subtidal marine communities. This
group is also economically important because it is a major
component of both marine and freshwater biofouling,
and evolutionarily important as a long-living phylum
with a good fossil record [1]. The phylum is currently
reported to contain 4000 extant species. However, it is
likely that more than twice that number are currently in
existence [2,3], with new taxa being described annually.
Together with the Brachiopoda and Phoronida, Bryozoa
have been classified as "Lophophorata" because they possess a similar suspension feeding apparatus, the lophophore, which is a horseshoe-shaped structure that
surrounds the mouth and has ciliated tentacles [4-8].
However, lophophorate phylogeny remains one of the
most controversial issues in metazoan animal phylogeny
because they display an amalgam of deuterostome and
protostome features. The "Lophophorata" have been classified as deuterostomes on the basis of morphological and
larval features [9-13]. On the other hand, molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that the lophophorates have
some affinities with mollusks and annelids within the
protostomes [14-21].
Lophophorate phylogenies that have been reconstructed
with mitochondrial protein-coding genes and nuclear
ribosomal DNAs have failed to resolve the detailed relationships among the lophophorates and other related
metazoan phyla [15,17,22-24]. Most studies of complete
mitochondrial genomes have focused on chordate and
arthropod phylogenies because only a few mitochondrial
genomes from lophotrochozoan phyla have been determined to date. So far, complete lophotrochozoan mitochondrial genome sequences have been published for 94
species from 12 phyla, including 45 mollusks, 8 annelids,
3 brachiopods, 1 bryozoan, 1 phoronid (nearly complete), 2 entoprocts, 28 platyheminths, 1 nemertean
(nearly complete), 1 rotifer, 2 chaetognaths, 1 acanthocephalan and 1 echiuran. If the mollusk data are
excluded, only 49 mitochondrial genomes have been
sequenced from the huge protostome group (the Lophotrochozoa) so far.
Complete mitochondrial genomes have been characterized from a variety of metazoan phyla so that nucleotide,
amino acid and gene order data can be used to resolve
their phylogenetic relationships. Mitochondrial genomes
are generally conserved in terms of gene components
(usually 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes
and 22 transfer RNA genes) [25], and a number of studies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/167

have taken advantage of the various levels of phylogenetic
information offered by mitochondrial genomes to solve
systematic and evolutionary questions over a broad taxonomic range [26,27].
Mitochondrial protein-coding genes have recently been
used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of lophophorates [28]. The results show that the phylum Brachiopoda (an articulate brachiopod, Terebratulina retusa)
belongs to the lophotrochozoan protostomes and that
Brachiopoda have a close relationship with Molluska and
Annelida within the monophyletic clade, Lophotrochozoa. The second lophophorate phylum, Phoronida (Phoronis architecta), has also been placed within the
Lophotrochozoa. Phoronis has the almost same gene
arrangement as the chiton, Katharina tunicata (Molluska,
Polyplacophora) [29]. Phylogenies based on most of the
molecular data strongly suggest that two lophophorate
phyla, Brachiopoda and Phoronida, are closely related to
each other (called Phoronizoa or Brachiozoa), and they
appear to be sister groups of mollusks and annelids within
the Lophotrochozoa [11,30].
In an attempt to address the phylogenetic position of bryozoans in metazoan phylogeny, the first mitochondrial
genome from a ctenostome bryozoan, Flustrellidra hispida
(Flustrellidridae), was recently sequenced and characterized. However, F. hispida exhibits a number of peculiar
features, such as extensive translocation of gene components including protein-coding and tRNA genes, and
extremely reduced size. Phylogenetic trees inferred from
the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of its proteincoding genes were mutually conflicting, so the phylogenetic position of F. hispida was not assigned. Thus, it is
necessary to sequence additional mitochondrial genomes
from more representative and widely-distributed bryozoans in order to address the issue of the phylogenetic
position of bryozoans on the basis of mitochondrial
genome information.
In this paper, to address whether or not lophophorates are
a monophyletic group and to examine the exact phylogenetic position of Bryozoa, we describe the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Bugula neritina (Bryozoa,
Gymnolaemata, Cheilostomata), one of the most widelydistributed cheliostome bryozoans. The result is compared with the F. hispida sequence. We also explore the
following: the monophyly of the class Gymnolaemata,
the phylogenetic implication of the gene orders in lophophorate mitochondrial genomes, the secondary structures
of extremely multiplied noncoding regions, etc.

Results and discussion
Genome organization
The mitochondrial genome sequence of Bugula neritina is
15,433 bp long and consists of 13 protein-coding genes

(cox1-3, nad1-nad6, nad4L, atp6, atp8 and cob), two rRNA
genes for the small and large subunits (rrnS and rrnL), and
22 tRNA genes, as is typical of the animal mitochondrial
genomes published so far (Fig. 1). The A+T content of the
entire mitochondrial genome of B. neritina is 70.0%.
Interestingly, we found 27 multiplied noncoding regions
(NC1-27). All the protein-coding and rRNA genes and 17
of the tRNA genes are transcribed in the same strand in B.
neritina; the other five tRNAs are [trnL(cun), trnA, trnE,
trnY and trnV], (Fig. 1). The first bryozoan mitochondrial
genome reported from F. hispida [31] has only 36 gene
components because trnS(ucn) is absent, it is relatively
short (13,026 bp), and the A+T content is lower (59.4%).
In contrast, B. neritina has features that are more typical of
metazoan mitochondrial genomes in general in terms of
the number of gene components, whole genome size and
A+T content.
Extreme multiplication of noncoding region
Strikingly, the B. neritina mitochondrial genome contains
27 multiplied noncoding regions: 16 noncoding regions
(NC1-NC16) larger than 10 bp (Table 1 and Fig. 2A) and
11 smaller (Table 1). The total length of the 16 noncoding
regions larger than 10 bp is 864 bp. Three of them â NC3
(271 bp) between trnA and trnK, NC4 (246 bp) between
trnK and rrnS and NC10 (68 bp) between trnY and cox1 â
could be candidate origins of replication. trnK, one of the
five tRNA genes transcribed on the light strand, is located
between NC3 and NC4. The placement of trnK between
these two possible control regions is likely to have
occurred very recently and independently only in the specific evolutionary lineage of B. neritina, since it has never
been found in any other metazoan. The remaining 13
noncoding regions (NC1-NC2, NC5-NC9, NC11-NC16)
total 279 bp in length and are dispersed throughout the
whole genome, ranging from 12 to 36 bp in size (Table 1
and Fig. 2A). In addition, 11 small intergenic gaps (< 10
bp) were identified between some gene components
(Table 1).

Most metazoan mitochondrial genomes reported so far
possess only a single major noncoding region, which is
thought to be involved in the regulation of transcription
and the control of DNA replication [32,33]. In general,
possible control regions possess characteristic features
such as high A+T contents, hairpin-loop structures, repeat
motifs, etc. [25,34]. In B. neritina, there are three possible
control regions (NC3, NC4 and NC10). Their A+T contents are 78.6% in NC3, 78.1% in NC4 and 79.4% in
NC10, all of which are much higher than the 70.0% of the
mitochondrial genome as a whole. In NC3, NC4 and
NC10, we found some hairpin-loop structures that might
be related to the mode of regulation of replication and
transcription (Fig. 2B). NC3 and NC4 possess no characteristic repeat motifs but have extensive poly "A" and poly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/167

"C" tracts (136 "A" and 12 "C" in NC3 and 122 "A" and
36 "C" in NC4), as often observed in mitochondrial control regions in other metazoans [25,34]. Intriguingly,
NC10 (12 A, 15 C, 2 G and 37 T) includes at least nine
"CTT" repeats with a short helix consisting of a 5-base-pair
stem and a 3-nt loop (Fig. 2B). Despite its short length (68
bp), the existence of "CTT" repeats and a hairpin-loop
may suggest that NC10 is important in regulating mitochondrial replication and transcription. In addition to
these, NC1 between trnW and trnL(cun) has a helix with a
5-bp stem [additional file 1].
Such multiple noncoding regions are rare in metazoan
mitochondrial genomes. The other bryozoan sequenced,
F. hispida, has 17 noncoding regions, ranging in size from
1 to 195 bp (506 bp in total). Among these, two possible
control regions were observed between trnC and trnG
(195 bp) and between cox2 and trnD (114 bp), which are
separated by cox2-trnG [31]. The mollusk Loligo bleekeri
(Cephalopoda; [35]) has 19 noncoding regions longer
than 10 bp. Three of these 19 are 515 bp, 507 bp and 509
bp long, and their sequences are nearly identical, suggesting that all three originated from a single, large, ancestral
noncoding region. In Lampsilis ornata (Bivalvia; [36]), 28
noncoding regions were found, ranging from 2 to 282 bp
in size. Of these, only one large noncoding region (136 bp
long) has an increased A+T content (76.8%), so it is a possible control region. Since no such extreme multiplication
of noncoding regions has been observed in any other
bivalve or cephalopod mollusk including Katharina tunicata, it is likely that the extreme multiplication of noncoding regions is a homoplasious characteristic, occurring
independently in the lineages of L. bleekeri, L. ornata and
B. neritina.
Comparative analysis of gene arrangements
Unlike other metazoan mitochondrial genomes in which
genes are encoded on both strands, all the protein-coding
and rRNA genes and 17 of the tRNA genes â the exceptions being the five tRNA genes trnL(cun), trnA, trnE, trnY
and trnV â are transcribed from the same strand in B. neritina (Fig. 1 and Table 1). In F. hispida, one protein-coding
gene (cox2), one ribosomal RNA gene (rrnL) and four
tRNA genes (trnG, trnC, trnL(uur), trnV and trnV) are
reversed. Such a single-strand-dependent transcription
tendency has been reported for 137 among the 1428
metazoan species in 23 phyla for which complete or
nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences have
been determined to date (Dec. 17, 2008). Except for six
tunicates (Deuterostomia, Urochordata), all the remaining 131 cases were from protostomes or primitive metazoan
groups:
83
protostomes
including
62
lophotrochozoans and 17 nematodes, and 48 primitive
metazoans including 29 cnidarians and 19 poriferans, the
most primitive metazoan groups (Table 2). The single-

order. On the other hand, only 5 translocations from a
brachiopod, T. retusa, and 6 translocations with 1 inversion from a phoronid, P. architecta, would produce the
gene arrangement of B. neritina; therefore, the gene
arrangement in T. retusa is most similar to that of B. neritina. The B. neritina gene arrangement could be obtained
from that of T. retusa by only five translocation events
(rrnS/rrnL, nad3/nad2, cox2, nad1 and nad6) with no inversions. The phoronid gene arrangement was identical to
that of Katharina with only one exception, a difference in
the position of atp6.

A circular map of the complete mitochondrial
genome of a bryozoan Bugula neritina (GenBank
accession number AY690838). Protein and rRNA genes
are abbreviated as follows: atp6 and atp8 (genes for ATPase
subunits 6 and 8), cox1-cox3 (genes for cytochrome C oxidase subunits I-III), cob (gene for apocytochrome b), nad1nad6 and nad4L (genes for NADH dehydrogenase subunits
1â6 and 4L), and rrnS and rrnL (genes for 12S and 16S
rRNAs). All 22 tRNA genes are located among protein- and/
or tRNA-coding genes. The tRNA genes are named using single-letter amino acid abbreviations, with the exception of
those coding for leucine and serine, which are named L1 for
the tRNALeu(CUN) (anticodon TAG) gene, L2 for the tRNALeu(UUR) (anticodon TAA) gene, S1 for the tRNASer(AGN) (anticodon GCT) gene and S2 for the tRNASer(UCN) (anticodon
TGA) gene. The arrows indicate the orientations of the gene
components. The three slashed regions corresponding to
NC3, NC4 and NC10 may be related to the mode of regulation of mitochondrial replication and transcription.

strand dependence of transcription might be a plesiomorphic, ancestral characteristic because such a tendency
appears in 48 out of 59 primitive metazoans (81.4%) such
as Cnidaria and Porifera (Table 2).
The arrangements of the protein-coding and rRNA genes
were compared among two bryozoans (B. neritina and F.
hispidia), a brachiopod (T. retusa), a phoronid (P. architecta) and a polyplachophoran (K. tunicata) (Fig. 3). The
overall gene arrangement in B. neritina was quite different
from those in other metazoans published so far. Compared to the F. hispida sequence, B. neritina needed 6 local
translocations and 1 inversion to have the same gene

Nucleotide composition and codon usage
As shown in Table 3, the overall A+T content of the B. neritina mitochondrial genome is 70.0% (+ strand: A =
37.7%; C = 17.6%; G = 12.4%; T = 32.3%), which is typical of the base compositions of metazoan mitochondrial
genomes. However, it is unusual in comparison to those
of other bryozoans and brachiopods; it is much higher
than those of F. hispida (59.4%) and of three brachiopods,
T. retusa (57.2%), T. transversa (59.1%) and L. rubellus
(58.3%).

Table 3 shows the AT- and CG-skews of each of the 13 protein-coding and 2 ribosomal RNA genes and of the whole
genome (total) in B. neritina mitochondria. The results
show no marked bias in nucleotide composition. The ATskew is positive for 11 genes and negative for five on the
(+) strand. The CG-skew for all 15 genes on the (+) strand
is positive. This means that the B. neritina mitochondrial
genome has no biased nucleotide composition. As shown
in [additional files 2 and 3], the other bryozoan, F. hispida,
has no biased nucleotide composition either. In contrast,
the AT-skews of 12 genes in T. transversa and L. rubellus
and the CG-skews of nine genes in all three brachiopods
seem clearly biased.
The codon usage pattern of the B. neritina mitochondrial
protein-coding genes is shown in Table 4. There is a clear
preference for A+T-rich codons; the five most frequently
used codons are UUA (300 times) for leucine, AUA (281)
for methionine, AUU (237) for isoleucine, UUU (178) for
phenylalanine and AAA (144) for lysine. Compared to
other lophotrochozoans, the B. neritina mitochondrial
genome showed a strong bias to A+T codons with dramatically lower G+C content. The anticodon nucleotides in B.
neritina were completely identical to those of the brachiopod Laqueus rubellus [37] and the annelid Lumbricus terrestris [38] except for trnL(cun) and trnY. However, two
anticodons â UUU in trnK and UCU in trnS(agn) â in B.
neritina were different from those used in most other
metazoans. The tRNA anticodon corresponding to the
codon AGN for serine is UCU, as in nematode mitochondrial genomes, but in most other metazoan mitochondrial genomes such as those of platyhelminthes,

mollusks, Drosophila and echinoderms, the serine tRNA
anticodon is GCU rather than UCU [25,38].
Transfer RNA genes
The B. neritina mitochondrial genome contains 22 typical
tRNA genes interspersed between the 2 rRNA and 13 protein-coding genes. This result differs from that of F. hispidia, which has only 21 tRNA genes because of the two
serine tRNA genes, trnS(agn) and trnS(ucn), trnS(ucn) is
absent [31]. If we obtain more bryozoan mitochondrial
genome data, it might be possible to provide reasonable
evolutionary interpretations through further comparative

analyses with respect to the absence/presence of
trnS(ucn). Thirteen of the 22 inferred B. neritina mitochondrial tRNAs have uniform features that are invariant
in typical cloverleaf-shaped secondary structures with a 7bp amino-acyl arm, 5-bp anticodon stem and 4-bp variable loop (Fig. 4). Two tRNAs [tRNACys, and tRNATyr] have
no DHU arm or TÏC arm. The TÏC arm and variable loop
are replaced by a single TV loop. In four tRNAs [tRNAGln,
tRNALeu(uur), tRNASer(agn) and tRNASer(ucn)], the DHU arms
are replaced by a loop. The unpaired DHU arm in
tRNASer(agn) has been considered a typical feature of animal mitochondrial genomes [25]. tRNASer(ucn) with an

unpaired DHU arm has also been reported for some protostomes: 2 nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans and Ascaris
suum [39]), 3 mollusks (1 chiton K. tunicata [40], 2 pulmonates Cepaea nemoralis and Euhadra herklotsi [41]), 2
brachiopods (T. transversa and L. rubellus [37,42]) and 1
annelid (Lumbricus terrestris [38]). We also found loss of
the DHU arm from tRNACys in the brachiopod L. rubellus,
as in B. neritina.
Regardless of formation of a stable DHU arm, the first of
2 nts separating the amino-acyl stem from the DHU arm

region is "T" in 14 tRNAs and the second is "A" in 19
tRNAs, and 1 nt separating the DHU arm region from the
anticodon stem is "A" in 13 tRNAs. The 2 bp preceding the
anticodon are always pyrimidines, with two exceptions â
'GU' in tRNALeu(cun) and 'AA' in tRNATyr â and the 1 nt
nearest the anticodon is "T" in 21 cases, the exception
being 'A' in tRNATyr. The nt immediately after the anticodon is always a purine ["A" in 20 tRNAs] with two exceptions â tRNAGlu and tRNATyr have "U" in the same
position. Among the 18 tRNAs that form a stable TÏC

drial tRNAs were observed in 15 tRNAs, 5-nt variable arms
in 2 tRNAs, tRNAAsp and tRNASer(agn), and 6-nt variable
arms in tRNAGlu. The inferred anticodons for 20 tRNAs in
B. neritina were the same as those in the other bryozoan,
F. hispida (Fig. 4), but anomalies were detected in two
tRNAs: tRNATyr with AUA instead of GUA, and tRNALeu(cun) with GAG instead of UAG. The former has been
reported for a few metazoans such as the predatory mite
Metaseiulus occidentalis [43] and a onychophoran, Epiperipatus biolleyi [44], but the latter has never previously been
reported for any metazoan. The tRNALeu(cun) with GAG
may be considered an interesting feature unique to B. neritina. However, further experimental studies are needed to
determine whether if it is a truly unique characteristic of
B. neritina, or whether it results from a simple error in
deducing the anticodon of tRNALeu(cun) from the nucleotide sequence of trnL(cun).
Ribosomal RNA genes
The two rRNA genes are generally separated by at least one
gene (trnV in most of cases). In B. neritina, rrnS and rrnL

are separated by trnN instead of trnV; trnV is located
between trnR and trnQ. Assuming that the rRNA genes
occupy all the available space between the adjacent genes,
rrnS and rrnL are approximately 840 bp and 1,327 bp in
length, respectively. The A+T contents of rrnS (69.1%) and
rrnL (69.2%) are similar to the 70.0% of the whole mitochondrial genome. The total size (2,176 bp) of the B. neritina mitochondrial rRNAs was greater than those of the
bryozoan F. hispida (1323 bp), 3 brachiopods (T. transversa, 1876 bp; L. rubellus, 1910 bp; T. retusa, 2057 bp), 2
annelids (P. dumerilii, 1962 bp; L. terrestris, 2030 bp) and
a polyplacophoran mollusk K. tunicata (2101 bp), but less
than those of a bivalve, Mytilis edulis (2189 bp), and a
cephalopod, L. bleekeri (2312 bp).
Phylogenetic position of bryozoans and lophophorate
phylogeny
As shown in Fig. 5 and [additional files 4, 5, 6], the first
step of phylogenetic analysis (ML and BI) was performed
on the basis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences
of 12 protein-coding genes in 42 metazoa (Table 5), in

Comparison of arrangement of the mitochondrial protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes for 2 bryozoans, 1
brachiopod, 1 phoronid and 1 polyplacophoran. Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes are designated by their abbreviations as shown in Fig. 1. Each gene map commences from cox3 and is oriented so that the gene is transcribed from left to
right. The rearrangements that are needed to inter-convert the pair of maps are shown, disregarding tRNA genes in which
shared gene arrangements are indicated. A circular arrow indicates inversion of a single gene or a block consisting of more
than two genes. Dramatic differences were found in tRNA gene positions, but they are not depicted because they are highly
complex.

order to explore the phylogenetic position of bryozoans
and lophophorate phylogeny within the Lophotrochozoa. All four trees showed that the two bryozoans (B. neritina and F. hispida) formed a strong monophyletic group
(BP 100% in MLaa (Fig. 5) and MLnt [additional file 4], and
BPP 1.0 in BIaa [additional file 5] and BInt [additional file
6]). No tree supported lophophorate monophyly, except
for the MLaa tree in Fig. 5, in which lophophorates including Entoprocta are grouped together with a weak node
confidence value (BP 40%). The sister group of the bryozoan clade appeared to be brachiopods (BP 88 in MLaa, BP
48 in MLnt and BPP 0.86 in BInt), except that the BIaa tree
clustered Bryozoa with Phoronida [additional file 5]. As
shown in Fig. 5 and [additional files 4, 5, 6], owing to possibly long-branch attraction artifacts (in particular, Nematoda and Platyhelminthes), all resultant ML and BI trees
regardless of the data types employed showed unexpected
groupings with extremely low node confidence values. In
addition, phylogenetic trees inferred from nucleotide
sequence data [additional files 4 and 6] had relatively
lower node confidence values especially in deep branches.
Amino acid-based trees (Fig. 5 and [additional file 5])
showed relatively higher node confidences in deep

branches than the nucleotide-based trees [additional files
4 and 6].
To resolve the problem of long-branch attraction, 2 nematodes and 3 platyhelminths were excluded from the first
data set for the second-round phylogenetic analyses. The
ML and BI trees newly obtained with the reduced data set,
including 37 taxa comprising 35 protostomes (20 lophotrochzoans and 10 ecdysozoans), 5 deuterostomes and 2
primitive metazoans (outgroup taxa) were improved,
robust and reliable with higher nodal support values.
Within the Lophotrochozoa, all four trees (Fig. 6) showed
that the monophylies of the two bryozoans (B. neritina
and F. hispida) and the three brachiopods (T. transversa,
L. rubellus, T. retusa) were strongly supported with strong
nodal supports (BP 100% in MLaa and MLnt and BPP 1.0
in BIaa and BInt). In all four trees shown in Fig. 6, the
strong monophyletic bryozoan clade, within the Lophotrochozoa, was grouped with a monophyletic brachiopod
clade (BP 88% and 59% in MLaa and MLnt and BPP 1.0
and 0.98 in BIaa and BInt, respectively). The clade of Bryozoa + Brachiopoda was grouped with the clade of Annelida including Echiura as a subtaxon (BP 90% and 49% in

MLaa and MLnt and BPP 0.99 and 0.98 in BIaa and BInt,
respectively). P. psamophila (Phoronida) was clustered
with Entoprocta in MLaa (BP 77%) and BIaa(BPP 0.90),
which is consistent with the result of Yokobori et al. [45]
based on mitochondrial protein-coding genes. In contrast, P. psamophila was grouped with a chiton, K. tunicate, in MLaa (BP 51%) and BIaa (BPP 0.97). This
indicates that the phylogenetic positions of Phoronida,

Entoprocta and K. tunicata are still ambiguous. No tree in
Fig. 6 supports lophophorate monophyly.
The results of the present phylogenetic analyses revealed
that lophophorates are placed with mollusks and annelids
as members of a monophyletic lophotrochozoan group.
This is consistent with evidence from 18S rRNA
[15,17,46], Hox genes [20], Na/K ATPase Î±-subunit [47]

and molecular data [14-18,29]. Therefore, it strongly suggests that the long-held view inferred from morphological
data [10] that deuterostomes have affinity with Bryozoa
and the other two lophophorates should be refuted.
Recent reports on lophophorate phylogeny based on SSU
rRNA gene sequences [24,48] coincide with the present
result in that lophophorates are unambiguously affiliated
with protostomes rather than deuterostomes.
Contrary to the present findings, which cluster Bryozoa
with Brachiopoda, some previous SSU rRNA-based results
have shown that brachiopods and phoronids (called the
subphylum 'Phoroniformea', 'Brachiozoa' or 'Poronozoa') form a separate clade from the bryozoans and even
suggest that phoronids may be members of the inarticulate brachiopods [11,15,17,19,21,23,30,48,49]. However,
the present trees did not show the Brachiozoa grouping at
all.
To clarify the statistical support for each grouping such as
the monophylies of Brachiozoa, Lophophorata, the oldconcept Bryozoa (comprising Entoprocta and Ectoprocta)
[50,51] and the sister group Bryozoa + Brachiopoda, we
performed tree topology tests (Table 6). The results indicate that on the basis of statistical probability, the sister
group of Bryozoa + Brachiopoda could be the AnnelidaEchiura or the Phoronida + Entoprocta clade. If the latter
is a true phylogeny, lophophorate monophyly including
Entoprocta may be supported. The tree topology test is
likely to indicate that Brachiozoa (= Brachiopoda + Phoronida) and the recently reinstated old-concept Bryozoa
may be refuted, but according to the present data the sister
group of Bryozoa is Brachiopoda (Table 6).
Despite intensive phylogenetic analyses, phylogenetic
relationships among lophotrochozoan members including lophophorates and others unfortunately remain
unclear because there are conflicts among the phylogenetic trees reconstructed by different tree-making methods, with different data types and with different taxon
samplings (Figs. 5 and 6 and [additional files 4, 5, 6]). The
phylogeny signal of mitochondrial genome nucleotides
and/or amino acids alone may be unable to resolve what
may have been a relatively rapid radiation during the
Cambrian [52,53]. Recently, to overcome such limitations, huge EST data sets from a number of metazoans
have been employed to resolve metazoan phylogeny [49].
The results still left the phylogenetic position of bryozoans unclear, and lophophorates did not form a monophyletic group. Further more intensive studies seem to be
necessary to resolve the exact phylogenetic position of the
bryozoans and to examine the question of lophophorate
monophyly.

Conclusion
This study presents the complete mitochondrial genome
of a cheliostome bryozoan, B. neritina. Comparison of the
orders of the protein-coding genes showed the possibility
that three lophophorates are closely related, including K.
tunicata. The present phylogenetic analyses suggest the
probable relationships ((Bryozoa, Brachiopoda), Annelida-Echiura), or ((Bryozoa, Brachiopoda), (Phoronida,
Entoprocta)), but the phylogenetic position of phoronids
is still ambiguous. Consequently, the results seem to
imply that the three lophophorate members did not form
a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic trees and this
possibility was also refuted statistically. However, according to the tree topology test, lophophorate monophyly
including Entoprocta â ((Bryozoa, Brachiopoda), (Phoronida, Entoprocta)) â was not refuted. In addition, Brachiozoa (= Brachiopoda + Phoronida) and the recentlyreinstated old-concept Bryozoa may be refuted, but
according to the present data the sister group of Bryozoa
is Brachiopoda (Table 6). However, because only a few
samples of lophophorates were used here and there were
some conflicts among the resultant trees, it is better to
postpone a final decision on the phylogenetic position of
bryozoans and on lophophorate phylogeny. Until more
mitochondrial genomes become available and until we
know more about the evolution of these organelle
genomes, we may not come to any conclusion with
respect to the monophyly or polyphyly of the lophophorates.

Methods
Specimen collection and DNA extraction
Bugula neritina (Bryozoa) was collected at Cheonsuman,
Taean Gun, Chungnam Province, Korea. Total genomic
DNA was extracted using a DNeasy tissue kit (QIAGEN
Co., Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol.
PCR amplification and cloning
The entire Bugula mitochondrial genome was amplified
by two kinds of overlapping polymerase chain reactions
(PCR). The PCR strategy was as follows: the ca. 2.5 kb fragment from cox1 to rrnL was amplified with previously
reported universal primers, 16SA (5'-CGC CTG TTT ATC
AAA AAC AT-3'; [54]) and HCO2198 (5'-TAA ACT TCA
GGG TGA CCA AA AAA -3'; [55]). From the newlysequenced ca. 2.5-kb sequences, the following two Bugulaspecific primers were designed to amplify the remaining
part (ca. 13.5 kb) of the mitochondrial genome: bnCOI
(5'-AGC CAT TTT CTC TTT ACA CCT TGC-3') and bn16S
(5'-TCA CTA CAA ACT CTA CAG GGT CTT-3').

The 2.5-kb PCR product was directly ligated to the pGEM
T-easy vector (Promega), and the 13.5-kb PCR product

was digested with PstI, generating four fragments (approximately 0.9, 2.7, 2.7 and 7 kb). The two internal PstIrestricted fragments (0.9 kb and 2.7 kb) were ligated into
PstI-digested pUC19 vector and both the end fragments
(2.7 kb and 7 kb) with A-tailings were ligated into the
modified, PstI-digested pGEM T-easy vector (Promega
Co.). All ligates were cloned with Escherichia coli DH5Î±
strain. Correct recombinants were selected by the blue/
white colony selection method using X-gal and IPTG.
Plasmid DNAs were purified using an AtmanBio Plasmid
Miniprep Kit (Takara Co., Japan).
Sequencing and sequence analysis
The purified plasmid DNA was sequenced using a primer
walking method with the ABI PRISM BigDye terminator
system and analyzed on an ABI3700 model automatic
sequencer (Genotech Co., Korea). DNA sequences were
analyzed using GeneJockey II, Version 1.6 (BIOSOFT Inc.,
Cambridge, UK). Thirteen mitochondrial protein-coding

genes were initially identified by a BLAST comparison
with other animal mitochondrial genomes, with start
codons inferred as eligible in-frame start codons corresponding at least to the extent of alignment that does not
overlap the upstream gene. Protein gene termini were
inferred to be at the first in-frame stop codon unless this
was located within the sequence of a downstream gene.
Otherwise, a truncated stop codon (T or TA) adjacent to
the beginning of the downstream gene was designated the
termination codon, assuming that it could be completed
by polyadenylation after transcript cleavage [56]. Ribosomal RNAs were identified by a BLAST search. A preliminary screening for tRNA genes was carried out using
tRNAscan-SE, version 1.1 [57]. The tRNA genes that were
not identified in this way were visually identified by
inspection of anticodon sequences and their proposed
cloverleaf secondary structures [58]. The sequence data
obtained here are available from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank
under accession number AY690838.

Phylogenetic analysis
For the first step in the present phylogenetic analyses, we
employed 40 protostomes and deuterostomes as ingroup
taxa and 2 primitive metazoans as outgroup taxa, as listed
in Table 5. When we selected the taxa for the present analyses, we tried to include all the lophotrochzoans for which
complete mitochondrial genomes had already been
sequenced. Some representative and/or slowly-evolving
ecdysozoans and deuterostomes were included as reference taxa. All mitochondrial genome sequences obtained
from members of the phyla Bryozoa (2 species), Brachiopoda (3), Phoronida (1), Echiura (1) and Entoprocta (2)
were used here. However, since complete mitochondrial
genome sequences from a number of members of the
phyla Molluska (45), Platyhelminthes (28), and Annelida
(8) have been determined, we selected only 3 each from
Annelida and Platyhelminthes and 8 from Molluska, in
order to reduce the calculation time in the present analyses. Those selected are representative and/or slowly-evolving ones in each phylum. Paraspadella gotoi and Spadella
cephaloptera (Phyum Chaetognatha) and Cephalothrix
rufifrons (Phylum Nemertea) were not included in the
present analyses because they do not have atp6 and atp8,
or have some genes that are as yet unidentified.

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the 12 protein-coding genes were used for the analyses. Only the 12
multiple alignment subsets of these sequences were created using a Clustal X multiple alignment program [59]
under the default option. Only well-aligned, conserved
alignment sites were extracted from each alignment subset
using the Gblock program [60] with the default option.
The conserved blocks extracted were subsequently con-

catenated into a single, unified, large alignment set with
the Gblock program. In the second-round phylogenetic
analyses, to resolve the problem of long-branch attraction, 5 taxa (2 nematodes and 3 platyhelminths) showing
extremely long branches (Fig. 5 and [additional file 4])
were excluded from the original data set used in the first
step. In total, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of
the mitochondrial protein-coding genes for 37 taxa were
aligned and conserved blocks were extracted as described
above.
For the first-round phylogenetic analyses with 42 metazoan mitochondrial genomes, the refined alignments
(1735 aa and 4470 nt positions in length) were subjected
to two different tree-making algorithms: the maximum
likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. For
phylogenetic analyses based on amino acid sequences,
rather than using hierarchical likelihood ratio tests to
select the best-fitting model for the evolution of
sequences, and to calculate the related parameter values (I
and Ã), ProtTest ver. 1.3 was used under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) because it has several important
advantages [61]. Among the 36 models implemented in
this program, the best-fitting model selected was MtArt
[62] with among-site substitution-rate heterogeneity
described by a gamma distribution (Ã = 0.732) and a fraction of sites constrained to be invariable (I= 0.072). For
phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences, the
best-fitting evolutionary model was estimated by Model
Test 3.6 [63], from which the GTR+G+I (general time
reversible model + among site rate variation + invariable
sites) model was selected. Model Test 3.6 was also used to
estimate the substitution rate parameters between nucle-

otides (AC 1.64479, AG 3.36847, AT 1.24161, CG
3.28174, CT 3.48682, and GT 1.00000) for the GTR
model, base frequencies (A = 0.244605, C = 0.141275, G
= 0.184743, T = 0.429377), assumed proportion of invariable sites (I = 0.126031), and the shape parameter
(alpha) of the among-site rate variation (G = 0.665080).
For the second-round phylogenetic analyses with 35 protostomes and deuterostomes and 2 outgroup taxa, the
refined alignments (2127 aa and 4965 nt positions in
length) were subjected to the two different tree-making
algorithms, ML and BI. For phylogenetic analyses based
on amino acid sequences, MtArt was selected as the bestfitting model [62] with among-site substitution-rate heterogeneity described by a gamma distribution (Î = 0.714)
and a fraction of sites constrained to be invariable (I =
0.1511). For phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide
sequences, GTR+G+I (general time reversible model +
among site rate variation + invariable sites) was selected as
the best-fitting model. The substitution rate parameters
between nucleotides were AC 1.08325, AG 3.02089, AT
1.20831, CG 2.51010, CT 2.92091, and GT 1.00000 for
the GTR model, the base frequencies were A = 0.259281,
C = 0.176486, G = 0.176848, T = 0.387385, the invariable
site parameter (I) was 0.105884, and the shape parameter
(alpha) of the among-site rate variation was G =
0.593221.

Authors' contributions
KHJ and UWH made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study, acquisition of the data,
and analysis and interpretation of the data. KHJ wrote the
early draft of this manuscript, and UWH revised and
rewrote all parts of the manuscript. Both authors read and
approved the final version of the manuscript. UWH gave
final approval of the version to be published.

Additional material
All the parameters estimated were then employed for ML
and BI analyses in the first and second round phylogenetic
analyses, respectively. Four rate categories were used in
the present study. The ML analysis was carried out using
PHYML v2.4.4 [64] and Treefinder [65]. The bootstrap
proportions in percentage (BP) of the ML tree were
obtained with 500 replicates by the fast-ML method using
PHYML and Treefinder. The BI analysis was carried out
using the MrBayes v3.0b4 program [66] with the following options: 1,000,000 generations, 4 chains (1 hot and 3
cold) and a burn-in step of the first 10,000. The node confidence values of the BI tree were presented with Bayesian
posterior probabilities (BPP).
Statistical confidence values for possible groupings of the
ML tree based on the amino acid residues of 12 proteincoding genes were computed by applying expected likelihood weights (ELWs) [67] to all local rearrangements
(LR) of tree topology around an edge (1,000 replicates)
using the program TREEFINDER.
