Abstract
Background: After 10-year-use of AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technology for DNA fingerprinting
and mRNA profiling, large repertories of genome- and transcriptome-derived sequences are available in public databases
for model, crop and tree species. AFLP marker systems have been and are being extensively exploited for genome
scanning and gene mapping, as well as cDNA-AFLP for transcriptome profiling and differentially expressed gene cloning.
The evaluation, annotation and classification of genomic markers and expressed transcripts would be of great utility for
both functional genomics and systems biology research in plants. This may be achieved by means of the Gene Ontology
(GO), consisting in three structured vocabularies (i.e. ontologies) describing genes, transcripts and proteins of any
organism in terms of their associated cellular component, biological process and molecular function in a speciesindependent manner. In this paper, the functional annotation of about 8,000 AFLP-derived ESTs retrieved in the NCBI
databases was carried out by using GO terminology.
Results: Descriptive statistics on the type, size and nature of gene sequences obtained by means of AFLP technology
were calculated. The gene products associated with mRNA transcripts were then classified according to the three main
GO vocabularies. A comparison of the functional content of cDNA-AFLP records was also performed by splitting the
sequence dataset into monocots and dicots and by comparing them to all annotated ESTs of Arabidopsis and rice,
respectively. On the whole, the statistical parameters adopted for the in silico AFLP-derived transcriptome-anchored
sequence analysis proved to be critical for obtaining reliable GO results. Such an exhaustive annotation may offer a
suitable platform for functional genomics, particularly useful in non-model species.
Conclusion: Reliable GO annotations of AFLP-derived sequences can be gathered through the optimization of the
experimental steps and the statistical parameters adopted. The Blast2GO software was shown to represent a
comprehensive bioinformatics solution for an annotation-based functional analysis. According to the whole set of GO
annotations, the AFLP technology generates thorough information for angiosperm gene products and shares common
features across angiosperm species and families. The utility of this technology for structural and functional genomics in
plants can be implemented by serial annotation analyses of genome-anchored fragments and organ/tissue-specific
repertories of transcriptome-derived fragments.

Background
The advances in high-throughput molecular biology technologies of the last two decades have not only led to a
drastic change in our ability to study genomes, but also
brought together novel mechanisms for structuring, storing and sharing information. Concerning gene annotation, previous scenarios of nomenclature diversity and
large efforts for gathering all available information on a
given species have been replaced by the availability of
standard vocabularies extensively used by the scientific
community. This, along with the availability of userfriendly bioinformatic tools, allows the feasible evaluation, functional annotation and classification of a high
number of expressed sequences in a great variety of organisms. Such characterization would be useful for functional
genomics research in plants, particularly in the emergent
field of systems biology. With the progress of plant
genome sequencing projects, in-depth knowledge about
molecules, such as nucleic acids and deduced proteins,
gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways
becomes possible. Hierarchically structured ontological
terms can now be adopted to query sequences and to
describe genes and their products at different levels of
knowledge and specificity [1].
The Gene Ontology (GO) project began in 1998 with the
integration of three model organism databases, i.e. yeast,
Drosophila and mouse, and represents today the most
widely used schema for the functional characterization of
plant, animal and microbial genes and gene products [1].
The GO project has developed three structured vocabularies (i.e. ontologies) describing genes, transcripts and proteins of any organism in terms of their associated cellular
component, biological process and molecular function in
a species-independent manner. The use of GO terms by
collaborating databases facilitates uniform retrievals
across them. Moreover, the GO vocabularies can be queried at different levels, allowing annotators to assign properties to genes or gene products, depending on the depth
of knowledge and specificity about that entity [2].
In plant species for which the genome sequence is not
available, AFLP and cDNA-AFLP are two of the most commonly used methods for genome- and transcriptomewide level analysis (see Additional file 1), respectively,
capable of discovering genes not yet been cloned or even
predicted, based upon their polymorphisms or differential expression patterns.
AFLP markers [3-5] represent the genomic tool with the
highest polymorphism information content, and combine the reliability of the RFLP technique with the power
of the PCR technique. Both AFLP and AFLP-derived markers, such as M-AFLPs (Microsatellite-AFLPs) and S-SAPs
(Sequence-Specific Amplified Polymorphisms), have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/347

been widely used for whole genome scanning and fingerprinting [6-13], characterizing single chromosomes and
mapping specific genes [14-20], as well as for transcriptome profiling and gene cloning by means of cDNA-AFLP
[21-23], and to generate quantitative gene expression patterns for eQTL mapping, as recently demonstrated by
Vuylsteke et al. [24].
Transcriptome differential profiling of plants with antagonistic phenotypes (e.g. mutant vs. wildtype) is theoretically one of the most powerful strategies for identifying
and cloning candidate genes not only for model organisms, but also in remarkably complex genomes such as
polyploids [25-32].
The mRNA fingerprinting based on AFLP technology does
not require pre-existing genome or EST sequence knowledge, therefore it is being widely used in less well investigated systems. Since a few genomes of agriculturally
important species (e.g., rice, poplar and grapevine) have
been sequenced and even fewer have been well annotated,
the data provided by cDNA-AFLP experiments may represent a valuable resource for functional genomics and
genetics in non-model plants. Compared to microarrays,
cDNA-AFLP increases the resolution of expression patterns detection using smaller amounts of mRNA [33]. This
feature is essential when an RNA fingerprinting is applied
to tissues for which it is hard to isolate stage-specific messengers, such as flowers, fruits and seeds. Both reliability
and sensitivity of amplification products proved to be very
high, and expression patterns visualized by cDNA-AFLP
showed to well correlate with northern blot analyses
[26,27,34-37]. Moreover, the redundancy of the technique [38] proved to be very informative in cases of alternative splicing and multigene family member displaying
[27,29,32], for distinguishing highly homologous genes
[39-41].
After 10-year-use of AFLPs for DNA fingerprinting and
mRNA profiling, large sequence collections retrieved with
this technology are available in public databases for several crop and model species. The evaluation, annotation
and classification of AFLP-derived genomic markers and
expressed transcripts would be very useful for both functional genomics and systems biology research in plants,
and crucial to allow the scientific community to promptly
retrieve this pre-existing information from gene banks.
Annotations could be periodically revised and implemented, and should allow to optimize genomic AFLP and
cDNA-AFLP experiments in plant species to give specific
information about the targeted biological processes and
molecular functions.
In the present study, we retrieved a total of 7,806 cDNAAFLP sequences related to roots, leaves, stems, flowers,

fruits and seeds from both NCBI databases and unpublished repertories. All these entries belong to 22 different
species distributed among seven botanic families:
Solanaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Salicaceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae and Vitaceae. Redundant sequences were clustered
and contigs assembled. Functional analysis was then performed using Blast2GO [42]. Blast2GO is a bioinformatic
tool for the GO-based annotation and data mining of
sequence sets for which no GO annotation is yet available,
which has proven to be effective in the functional characterization of plant sequence data [43]. The cDNA-AFLPderived sequences were then grouped according to the GO
vocabularies. Experimental steps and statistical parameters adopted for the in silico analysis were critical for
obtaining reliable gene ontology data. Annotation results
for the whole sequence dataset and also for botanic families, single species and plant organs are presented, and the
main features of genes and gene products detectable in
plants by AFLP technology discussed.

Results
Gene Ontology of AFLP-derived cDNA sequences
The total number of plant cDNA sequences derived from
AFLP technology deposited in NCBI databases or recovered from private unpublished collections was as high as
7,806. Entries belonged to 22 different model, crop and
tree species distributed among seven botanic families:
Solanaceae (3,734), Salicaceae (1,003), Fabaceae (975),
Poaceae (906), Rosaceae (769), Brassicaceae (262) and Vitaceae (226). Additional 69 cDNA-AFLP-derived sequences
of Salix spp. were analyzed separately once they became
publicly available because although deposited they were
not released at the time of entries downloading. The most
abundant taxonomic group included in the present study
was the genus Nicotiana, followed by Populus, Medicago,
Oryza and Malus. The list of organisms with their corresponding number of cDNA-AFLP sequences deposited in
NCBI databases is reported in the Methods section (see
Table 1).

Redundant cDNA-AFLP sequences for each of the 22
organisms were clustered into a total of 730 contigs,
whereas the remaining 6,018 records (77.1% of the total

subset, the number of retrieved sequences and the percentage of the total, the number of contigs, the number of singlets and the percentage of the
total, the redundancy, and the GC content are reported.
1278 sequences deposited in GenBank but not yet publicly released; 2All 69 sequences were released after February 1th, 2007; 3113 sequences are

raw sequences) were singlets. The overall estimate of
redundancy was about 23%, ranging from 0% in Fragaria
and Lolium, to 44.3% of Solanum spp, whereas the GC
content of cDNA-AFLP sequences was found to be 45%,
with a standard deviation over all organisms as low as
2.8%. Redundancy statistics and GC contents for all
organisms are summarized in Table 1.
With the exception of the 69 Salix entries (analyzed separately from the rest of entries by Quaggiotti et al. [32]
because they were released after February 1st, 2007), the
6,679 cDNA-AFLP sequences equal to 722 contigs plus
5,957 singlets and belonging to 21 Angiospermae were
used as BlastX queries to search for structural homologies
and significant similarities. A total of 4,332 sequences
(64.9%) revealed significant similarity with deposited
records, showing an average nucleotide similarity estimate of 80% and a median E-value of 1 e-13 over all
organisms (see Additional file 2). The same statistics were
also computed for each single species or genus (see Additional file 3).
GO term mapping allowed the identification of 11,409
GO terms based upon 4,332 matches retrieved by BlastX.
The distribution of annotations among GO vocabularies
and the number of cDNA-AFLP sequences with GO terms
belonging to only one, a combination of two and all three
vocabularies was organized in a Venn diagram (Fig. 1).

1,246 sequences were annotated according to all the three
GO subvocabularies (i.e. 'cellular component', CC; 'biological process', BP; 'molecular function', MF) and annotations simplified using a plant-specific GOslim following
the approach suggested by similar papers with comparative purposes [44-46].
As many as 704, 171 and 103 sequences were annotated
with a combination of BP and MF terms, BP and CC
terms, and CC and MF terms, respectively.
Basic statistics for all the cDNA-AFLP annotated sequences
sorted by botanic family and by single organism, including mean length and length range for a 68% confidence
interval, mean similarity and similarity range for a 68%
confidence interval, median E-value with minimum and
maximum E-values are reported in Tables 2 and 3.
Among the botanic families, Vitaceae showed the highest
proportion of annotated sequences (over 60%) and
Rosaceae the lowest without Blast matches (less than
10%). On the whole, 36% of sequences did not retrieve
any Blast result within the set E-value threshold. Mapping
of GO terms and annotation were not possible for 20%
and 3% of sequences, respectively, whereas the remaining
41% was annotated. Overall data distribution of cDNAAFLP sequences grouped according to the organ, tissue or
part of the plant, and botanic family showed a large variation for the percentage of sequences either with no Blast
results or annotated, whereas the percentage of sequences
neither with mapping nor annotation was quite constant
(Fig. 2). Fruits were the organs with the highest percentage
of annotated sequences and the lowest percentage without Blast matches, whereas the opposite was for seeds.
Similar properties were observed for roots, stems and
leaves, and flowers.
Level 2 GOslim analysis of AFLP-derived cDNA sequences
The GO terms obtained by the annotation procedure were
mapped to a plant specific GOslim to generate a more
concise annotation to be used for comparative analyses as
reported in similar researches [44-46]. In the present
study the 'goslim_plant.obo' developed by Mundodi S.
The FTP directory of the Genome Databases Group,
Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of
Medicine was used (please see Availability & requirements
for more information) [47]. The GOslim classification of
annotated cDNA-AFLP sequences is reported in Figures 3
and 4. Level 2 annotation was chosen because representative of all retrieved annotation, and a comparison with the
annotations of Arabidopsis and rice ESTs was possible.
Among the annotated sequences, 479 were attributable to
roots, 903 to stems plus leaves, 125 to flowers, 342 to
fruits and 114 to seeds. For the remaining 780 (28% of the
total annotated), no information on the plant tissue or

Concerning the annotations of sequences grouped by
organs and tissues (Fig. 3, left panel), it is worth noting
that the proportion of fruit records with catalytic and
transporter activities was significantly higher (1.5- and 2fold, respectively) than that observed for other organs (χ2

≥ 12.969, P ≤ 0.0002 and χ2 ≥ 7.178, P ≤ 0.0054, respectively), whereas the proportion of sequences related to
'binding' was much lower (about 5-fold) than that calculated for roots, leaves and stems, flowers and seeds (χ2 ≥
94.173, P ≤ 0.0001). The annotation of sequences according to the botanic family was also performed (Fig. 3, right

branch of the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graphs, i.e. the hierarchical representation of the gene ontology) that fulfils
the filter condition, e.g. will find all the lowest nodes with
the given number of sequences or score value (see Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

Data distribution of cDNA-AFLP records
Data distribution of cDNA-AFLP records. Data distribution of sequences grouped according to the organ/tissue/
part of the plant (A) and botanic family (B). Without Blast
results: giving no significant similarity in BlastX analysis; without mapping: no GO term was mapped according to the
information found in the blast matches; without annotation:
the mapped GO terms were not reliable or without a significant score; annotated without GOslim: the GO annotation
had no specific matching GO term in the GOslim used; annotated with GOslim: sequences with specific GOslim terms.
'organelle'), BP ('physiological process' and 'cellular process') and MF ('catalytic activity' and 'binding') proved to
be very similar each other, with relative differences
smaller than 5%. These findings indicate that GO annotation data gained for AFLP-derived cDNA sequences in
plants are highly concordant, when compared among
botanic families, but also significantly divergent, when
referred to different plant organs or tissues.
The classification of annotated cDNA-AFLP sequences at
level 2 is summarized in Figure 4 for each of the 22 taxonomic entities/organisms analyzed in this study and
sorted by genus or species. The proportion of annotated
sequences for each organism varied from 26.4% of Nicotiana spp. to 4.7% of Lolium multiflorum. Consistent differences were pointed out among species for GO terms
belonging to the three subvocabularies.
GO multilevel analysis of AFLP-derived cDNA sequences
All cDNA-AFLP sequences sorted by organs and families
were also analyzed using a multilevel procedure. This fur-

The most represented terms among the 1,485 belonging
to CC for plant organs were 'membrane' for fruits (32.9%)
and roots (26.3%), and 'plastid' for seeds (30.4%), flowers (29.6%), and leaves and stems (23.7%). Sequences
associated with 'cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicle',
'intracellular organelle part' and 'membrane part' were
only found in leaves and stems. The most represented BP
terms among the 1,565 for plant organs were 'transport' in
seeds (36.1%%), fruits (26.8%) and roots (21.7%), 'secretory pathway' (18.0%) in leaves and stems, 'amino acid
and derivative metabolism' (15.9%) in flowers. Finally,
the most represented terms among the 1,350 belonging to
MF for plant organs were 'hydrolase activity' in roots
(32.5%) and seeds (30.8%), 'oxidoreductase activity'
(20.1%) in leaves and stems, 'nucleotide binding' in flowers (30.4%) and fruits (28.3%). Sequences associated with
'oxidoreductase activity', 'ATP binding', 'transition metal
ion binding', 'protein kinase activity' and 'peptidase activity' were only recorded for leaves and stems. Conversely,
sequences related to 'hydrolase activity' and 'nucleotide
binding' were found over all organs, except for leaves and
stems (see also Additional files 4, 5, 6).
Regarding the by-family functional analysis at multiple
levels, again an overall agreement in most represented GO
terms was observed. Concerning the CC, 'membrane' was
the most abundant term in all families, except for the
Solanaceae where 'protein complex' was the most frequent.
'Plastid' and 'mitochondrion' were also abundant in the
Fabaceae and Poaceae. For the BP ontology, the most
numerically represented categories related to 'transport'
over all families, varying between 16.7% of Brassicaceae to
29.7% of Poaceae. Among the other GO terms, the most
abundant within family were 'cell organization and biogenesis' in Solanaceae, 'protein modification' in Fabaceae,
Rosaceae and Solanaceae, 'biosynthesis' in Fabaceae, 'carbohydrate metabolism' in Rosaceae and Salicaceae, 'amino
acid and derivative metabolism' in Fabaceae, Poaceae and
Salicaceae. Among the MF terms, 'hydrolase activity' and
'nucleotide binding' included the highest proportion of
sequences over all families. In particular, sequences associated with the former spanned from 19.0% of Solanaceae
to 29.0% of Fabaceae, whereas those associated with the
latter were around 25% in most families. Moreover,
cDNA-AFLP profiling proved to assay expressed sequences
related to 'kinase activity' with very similar efficiency
(about 11%) in each of the seven families analyzed in this
study (for details see Additional file 7, 8, 9).

Annotation index (Ai) estimates of AFLP-derived cDNA
sequences
An annotation index (Ai) was developed to describe the
information content of AFLP-derived cDNA sequence collections on the basis of the GO annotations.

Computational simulations performed with random sets
of 1,000 cDNA-AFLP sequences revealed that Ai values
can range between 0.2 and 3.0 (data not shown), depending on the proportion of sequences associated with combinations of terms belonging to one, two or all the three
GO vocabularies. Annotations indexes were estimated for
plant organs/tissues and botanic families in order to perform comparisons. Sequences related to seeds and fruits
were those displaying, respectively, the lowest and highest
Ai with almost a two-fold difference, i.e. 0.70 vs. 1.32
(Table 4). Concerning botanic families, Ai ranged from
0.68 of Solanaceae to 1.51 of Vitaceae, with an average
value for the total set of sequences of 0.93.
GO comparison between dicots and monocots AFLPderived cDNA sequences
In order to study the functional content of cDNA-AFLP
sequences in relation to expressed sequences in model
organisms, a level 2 GOSlim classification of all the
cDNA-AFLP records was performed by splitting the
sequence dataset into monocots and dicots and by comparing the two subgroups with all annotated ESTs (please
see Availability & requirements for more information) of
Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively (Fig. 5).

The comparison between dicot cDNA-AFLPs and Arabidopsis EST sequences revealed substantial differences for
the relative frequencies of the most represented GO terms
associated with CC and MF ontologies. In particular, the

CC categories of 'cell', 'organelle' and 'protein complex'
included 43.1%, 28.1% and 10.7% of Arabidopsis EST
sequences against 52.6%, 34.6% and 5.3% of dicot cDNAAFLP sequences, respectively (all pairwise comparisons in
terms of absolute frequencies were significant or highly
significant, being χ2 ≥ 9.148 and P ≤ 0.0025). Even the GO
terms related to 'organelle part' and 'envelope' were
strongly differentiated between Arabidopsis and dicot
species. The two major GO categories associated with BP,
which were 'physiological process' and 'cellular process',
showed to be similarly represented in dicot species and
Arabidopsis, being their proportions equal to 49.8% vs.
50.4% and 46.1% vs. 47.7%, respectively. A large difference was observed for the term 'response to stimulus',
which was assigned to 13.6% of Arabidopsis sequences
and only to 3.6% in dicot cDNA-AFLPs (χ2 = 162.02, P =
1.3e-45). Four additional GO term categories, 'regulation
of biological process', 'development', 'reproduction' and
'growth' were found at 11.5%, 7.1%, 3.0% and 1.1%,
respectively, in Arabidopsis and at much lower frequencies in the dicot species (< 0.3%). Regarding MF terms,
highly significant differences were found for the two
major categories, 'catalytic activity' and 'binding': the
former was represented by 30.2% and 44.3% of the
sequences, respectively, in Arabidopsis and dicot species,
whereas the latter was 28% in Arabidopsis and 37.8% in
the dicots (χ2 ≥ 55.009, P ≤ 1.68e-13 and χ2 ≥ 12.391, P ≤
4.44e-5, respectively). A marked difference was also found
for the category 'transcription regulator activity' (9.1% of
Arabidopsis vs. 2.9% of dicots, with χ2 = 102.12 and P =
1.71e-29).
The comparison between monocot cDNA-AFLPs and rice
EST sequences revealed also consistent differences for
some of the most frequent GO terms. While in the CC
branch the two major categories of 'cell' and 'organelle'
were similarly represented, with 50.2% vs. 60.6% and
40.2% vs. 42.9%, respectively (χ2 = 6.158, P = 0.012 and
χ2 = 1.894, n.s., respectively), a marked difference was
observed for 'protein complex', being the frequency of
sequences associated with this category equal to 21.3% in
rice and 4.4% in the monocot sequences (χ2 = 61.677, P =
2.02e-19). Regarding the BP, the three major GO terms
proved to be much more frequent in rice ESTs than in
monocot cDNA-AFLP sequences, being equal to 67.4% vs.
49.8% for 'physiological process', 63.2% vs. 47.6% for
'cellular process' and 15.5% vs. 2.6% for 'response to stimulus', with highly significant differences (χ2 ≥ 156.1, P ≤
4.39e-35), 10.8% vs. 0% for 'development', and 9,4% vs.
0% for 'regulation of biological process'. Non-significant
differences were observed for the GO terms belonging to
the MF vocabulary, except for the category of 'binding' (χ2
= 12.601, P = 0.000045) (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Experimental procedures adopted for GO analysis of
AFLP-derived sequences
The experimental steps and statistical parameters adopted
for AFLP-derived sequence analysis are critical for obtaining reliable ontology data and deserve a specific mention.
Four main steps were followed to achieve a reliable GO
classification of AFLP-derived sequences: I. Data recovery

from sequence databases; II. Preliminary selection of
nucleotide records; III. Basic annotation; IV. Enrichment
and refinement of annotation terms (Fig. 6).
The retrieval of AFLP-related sequences from NCBI was
performed by searching for the keywords "AFLP and
viridiplantae" and "cDNA-AFLP and viridiplantae" and
subsequent manual scoring to verify the results. The man-

ual step was required because the keywords indicating the
AFLP origin were not always present in the record fields.
For our purpose, this seemed to be a noticeable limitation
of the GenBank database, probably due both to an unintentional inaccuracy in submitting sequences and an
insufficient stringency in accepting a new record without
any precise indication of its origin. As a general remark,
nucleotide NCBI database curators should consider
requesting additional and more precise information
about the origin of the records to be submitted. In the case
of AFLP-derived sequences, at least the restriction
enzymes and selective primer combinations used in the
experiments should be added in the 'features' or 'comment' fields, as already done by several submitters. The
presence of redundant sequences (20% on average) was a
further known limitation, caused mainly by a poor evaluation of the records already present in the public databases at the time of a new submission. However, possible
polymorphisms, even at the single nucleotide level
(SNPs), have to be always considered as highly informative and carefully evaluated for their reliability.
The basic annotation obtained by retrieving GO terms
from BlastX matches was enriched and refined using three
main strategies integrated in the Blast2GO software: i)
InterProScan, ii) ANNEX, and iii) GOslim simplified
annotation. Databases of protein domains and functional
sites have become vital resources for the prediction of protein functions. InterProScan [48] combines different protein signature recognition methods allowing searches
against independent databases and an easy recovery of the
corresponding codes to be automatically coupled to GO
terms annotation. This tool allowed an average 8%
increase in the overall annotated sequences (data not
shown). This value is in the range of observed improvement in blast-based GO annotation by InterPro (Goetz,
personal communication) and shows the important contribution of motif-based annotation in GO terms enrichment as well as the basic importance of an integrated
approach to the annotation of unknown nucleotide
records. A refinement of the GO terms was obtained by
means of the ANNEX function (please see Availability &
requirements for more information). Using the original
GO structure, ANNEX locates parent-offspring relationships between the annotations. Afterwards, ANNEX suggests new BP and CC annotations as well as implicit ones
deduced from univocal relationships between GO terms
from the different GO categories providing on average
10–15% increase in functional terms. In other words,
given a molecular function, this tool identifies biological
processes where the molecular functions are involved and
the cellular components where they are active. For a
detailed description of the ANNEX procedure, see [49].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/347

In the last step of the annotation procedure, a simplified
version of the full ontologies (i.e. the GOslim) was
adopted [44-46]. GOslims are cut-down versions of the
full ontologies composed by high-level selected terms, or
nodes, each one including subsets of the terms of the
whole GO. They give a broad overview of the ontology
content without the detail of the specific fine-grained
terms. GOslims are created by users according to their
needs, and may be specific to species or to particular areas
of the ontologies. GO provides a generic GOslim which,
like the GO itself, is not species-specific, and which
should be suitable for most purposes such as the comparisons made in this research. The adoption of the
'goslim_plant.obo' GOslim allowed a visible improvement of the annotation in terms of a reduced fragmentation of the GO categories and a more plant-specific
terminology. Indeed, all the GO terms specifically related
to CC, MF and BP typical of mammals and/or unicellular
organisms were removed or replaced with plant-specific
terms.
The Blast2GO software was shown to be very effective in
every step of the annotation procedure particularly with
respect to the integrated tools that allowed a great time
saving during the enrichment and refinement steps. This
tool offers a suitable platform for functional genomics
research in non-model species and it also allows monitoring and comprehension of the whole annotation and
analysis steps. Some minimal limitations were found during the elaboration of results, in particular concerning the
generation of graphics. However, future implementations
may allow the Blast2GO software to be one of the most
powerful tools for the annotation of unknown sequence
pools.
Gene expression analysis by means of cDNA-AFLP
technique
The generation of transcriptional profiles has numerous
applications in plant biology, including the identification
of tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific, reproduction-related
and
stress-induced
transcripts
[26,27,29,31,32,37,50-57]. Many new techniques have
been designed in recent years for this purpose, such as
microarrays [58], allowing a serial genome-wide expression profile of thousands of genes to be performed in a
single experiment. Though powerful, this approach is
often really expensive and can be readily applied only to
model species for which significant information about the
coding sequences is available. Moreover, because rarely
expressed transcripts are usually missing from cDNA
libraries due to over-representation of abundant messengers, microarrays could fail to detect transcripts that are
rare but fundamental for certain traits. Library enrichment
approaches, such as library subtraction or normalization
[59,60], could also be adopted to catch low-copy mRNAs,

Page 12 of 19

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:347

although time-consuming and cost-effective. On the other
hand, the cDNA-AFLP technique has become one of the
most robust solutions for differential display and it has
been successfully applied in several quantitative gene
expression studies [21,24,40,61,62], even in less investigated species for which sequence information is not available. Therefore, after ten years from its first applications in
plants, cDNA-AFLP represents an irreplaceable tool for
transcriptome profiling analysis that can be utilized for
multifactorial genomics of any species. The utility of
cDNA-AFLP in functional genomics and systems biology
research in plants can be further implemented by serial
annotation analyses of species/organ/tissue-specific repertories of transcript-derived fragments, starting from the
data provided in the present study. Moreover, the annotations have to be continuously updated, since further information is available by functional characterization of the
most interesting sequences. In this way, annotation data
may allow to set up a forecasting model according to
which the cDNA-AFLP experiments can be tuned to target
specific gene classes, and therefore, retrieving gene
sequences enriched with the desired functional categories.
BlastX querying, GO terms mapping and annotation of
transcript sequences recovered by cDNA-AFLP analysis
The relatively high number of specific studies carried out
in recent years using cDNA-AFLP as a differential display
technique does not match a correspondingly high number
of sequences retrievable from public databases. The total
number of plant AFLP-derived EST entries was shown to
be as low as 7,806, successively reduced to 6,748 because
of the 23% of redundancy. Moreover, only 22 plant species/genera were represented over all records, with
Solanaceae being the most numerous family.

A total of 4,332 cDNA-AFLP sequences revealed structural
homology and significant similarity with deposited
records, allowing to retrieve as many as 11,409 GO terms.
The subsequent validation performed with the integrated
function of the Blast2GO software enabled the annotation of 2,743 cDNA-AFLP sequences, each with 1 to 26
GO terms. Despite the important role of cereals and
related research, the highest number (90%) of AFLPderived ESTs with Blast matches was found in the Rosaceae
family, immediately followed by the Vitaceae (84%), the
latter being mostly represented by grape sequences. These
two taxonomic groups have been subjected to intense
research activities in the last few years, supported by
worldwide initiatives such as the GDR (Genomic Database for Rosaceae, [63]) at Clemson University (USA),
ESTree consortium in Italy (please see Availability &
requirements for more information) which is focused
mainly on peach, International Grape Genome Program
(please see Availability & requirements for more information) in United States and the Franco-Italian grape

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/347

genome sequencing project (please see Availability &
requirements for more information). The enrichment of
database information resulting from such collaborative
researches may be in part responsible of the availability of
Blast matches for Rosaceae and Vitaceae sequences. For a
parametric description of sequence annotability, a dedicated index (Ai, Annotation index) was developed in the
present research and calculated for the most interesting
sequence subsets. Therefore, the Ai computed for Rosaceae
and Vitaceae was as high as 1.26 and 1.51, respectively
(Table 4). Taking into account the other botanic families,
some interesting results were pointed out concerning the
annotability of sequences. In particular, Solanaceae family
strangely showed the lowest percentage (31%) of annotated sequences, with Ai as low as 0.68 (see Fig. 2 and
Table 4), despite the high number of entries present in the
databases and the fact that species belonging to this taxonomic group, such as tomato, tobacco and petunia, are
widely used as models.
Considering the information content of sequences classified according to the organ, tissue or part of the plant from
which they were previously isolated, some interesting
results were evidenced from the analysis of data distribution (Fig. 2). The highest percentage (90%) of sequences
with Blast results was found for cDNA-AFLP entries isolated from fruits, that were also the plant organs with the
highest percentage of annotated sequences, with an Ai as
high as 1.32 (Table 4). This result agrees with those found
for the Rosaceae family, to which most of the fruits such as
peach, apple, pear, plum, apricot, and cherry belong, as
well as for the species included in the Vitaceae taxonomic
group, such as grape. Moreover, the abundance of GO
terms associated with carbohydrate, protein and amino
acid metabolism, and catalytic as well as transporter activities may reflect the cellular and biochemical events occurring during fruit ripening. Despite the importance of seed
development in cereals and legumes, and the amount of
studies dedicated to its understanding, sequences related
to seeds were those with the lowest percentage of entries
with blast hits (51%) and annotation (29%), displaying
an Ai = 0.70 (Table 4).
On the whole, our findings suggest that the annotability
of a set of sequences from a specific plant organ or a particular taxonomic group is not a direct consequence of the
amount of research efforts dedicated to studying that
organ or group. In fact, the GO annotations of genes are
very often transferred from very phylogenetically distant
organisms.
The GO characterization and annotation of AFLP-derived
sequences allowed us to retrieve basic information on the
gene function/s in crop species and their organs/tissues. In
particular, examination of thousands of EST clones ena-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:347

bled certain inferences to be made on the potentials and
drawbacks of AFLP technology for mRNA profiling and
differential display gene cloning. Although the different
number of sequences retrieved in databases for plants and
organs might have biased some of the descriptive statistics, the overall GO is consistent with the existence of
AFLP technology features exploitable across angiosperm.
The representativeness of sequence samples and goodness
of statistical results over all taxonomic groups are supported by bootstrap analysis. The calculations were performed using the 2,235 singlets of Nicotiana spp. with a
number of non-overlapping random replicates of 32, 15
and 10 each formed by 70, 149 and 224 sequences,
respectively. The bootstrap test was carried out on Nicotiana because it was the most numerous genus. The proportions of annotated sequences for each GO vocabulary
and over all GO terms per vocabulary proved to be very
similar in all replicates with standard deviations lower
than 5% in most cases (see Additional File 10). This finding demonstrates the high reliability and reproducibility
of gene annotation results for the 22 organisms analyzed
in this study. As a consequence, EST repertories equal to or
larger than 100 cDNA-AFLP clones can be considered sufficient to obtain a sequence information content representative of the main GO categories.
In this context, it is worth noting that cDNA-AFLP profiling proved to assay expressed sequences related to 'kinase
activity' with very similar efficiency in each of the seven
families analyzed in this study. It may be deduced that
this gene family shows distinctive conserved characteristics so that its members can be repeatedly detected by the
cDNA-AFLP technique with a quite constant probability
in all plant species.
A GO classification of all cDNA-AFLP records was performed by splitting the sequence dataset into monocots
and dicots and by comparing the two subgroups with all
annotated ESTs of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.
Although available molecular data may be biased by the
experimental methodologies and plant materials, our
overall GO results suggest that in a given species and for a
given organ or tissue EST repertories developed by construction and screening of cDNA libraries include a
sequence pool information content different from and/or
complementary to that of TDF (Transcript-Derived Fragment) collections generated by cDNA-AFLP profiling and
differential display. Since functional data supplied by
AFLP-derived sequences do not fully overlap the functional data obtained by EST projects, the two technologies
most likely allow to probe distinct target genes and to capture distinct transcript subsets from a given part of the
plant. Alternatively, the functional information obtained
by Blast2GO may have been biased in comparison to the
available annotation for rice and Arabidopsis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/347

The comparison between monocot cDNA-AFLPs and rice
EST sequences also revealed interesting results. In this
case, an explanation for the deviations documented in
specific GO branches and categories might be found in the
different goals driving basic research projects and applied
breeding activities in model and crop plants.

Conclusion
In the last ten years, the cDNA-AFLP mRNA profiling was
largely adopted and considerable repertories of organ-specific and differentially expressed transcripts are now available in public databases for model, crop and tree species.
The evaluation, annotation and classification of AFLPderived sequences would therefore become crucial for
both functional genomics and systems biology research in
plants. The possibility of using AFLP-derived tags on
cDNA fragments produced directly by sequencing-by-synthesis technologies opens up the possibility of not only
identifying very large numbers of expressed genes, but
also retrieving large-scale SNP collections.
Our study suggests that a reliable GO characterization of
AFLP-derived sequences is based on the optimization of
experimental steps and statistical parameters adopted for
GO analysis. The Blast2GO software was shown to represent a comprehensive bioinformatics solution for functionally characterizing sequences and data mining on the
correspondent annotations based on the GO vocabularies. An exhaustive annotation based on gene products
similarity Blast searches would offer a suitable platform
for functional genomics, particularly useful in non-model
plant species.
Therefore, the utility of AFLP technology in structural and
functional genomics in plants can be implemented by GO
annotation analyses species/organ/tissue-specific repertories of transcriptome-derived fragments. Our suggestion is
that AFLP-derived sequences should be systematically
subjected to GO annotations before their submission to
NCBI databases so that a publicly available information
based on yearly larger plant EST collections could be periodically released to the GO Consortium and retrieved by
other researchers when searching the GenBank.

Availability & requirements for more information; [66])
with the default parameters. A total of 6,679 records were
obtained for the following analyses and grouped according to their taxonomy (i.e. species, genus and family) and
the plant tissue from which they had been previously isolated (i.e. root, leaf and stem, flower, fruit, seed). All the
contigs along with singlets were used to search databases
using Blast.
GO annotation using Blast2GO
Blast analyses were performed using Blast2GO software
v1.3.3 (please see Availability & requirements for more
information; [42,67]). Briefly, Blast2GO uses Blast with a
user-defined threshold to find similar sequences from the
NCBI NRPD (nr database). Publicly available database
cross-reference files are used to look up GO association
files and retrieve GO annotations for the Blast matches.
Databases and files used in the present research were
those publicly available on February, 1st 2007. Blast2GO
assigns GO annotations to the query sequence by pooling
the retrieved GO terms and determining the most specific
annotations based on an annotation rule (AR). The AR
works by weighting GO evidence codes for each GO term
retrieved (defaults weights: IDA = 1.0; IMP = 1.0; IGI = 1.0;
IPI = 1.0; IEP = 1.0; TAS = 0.9; NAS = 0.9; IC = 0.9; ISS =
0.9; IGC = 0.9; RCA = 0.9; IEA = 0.7; ND = 0.5; NR = 0.5).
The user can select only GO terms greater than a specified
AR threshold.

BlastX algorithm was used with different parameters
according to the length of the query sequence by defining
four ranges, as shown in Figure 6: 0–99 bp, 100–199 bp,
200–399 bp, ≥ 400 bp. Blast expectation value threshold
was constantly set to 10, whereas HSP length cutoff was
set to 10, 15, 20 and 33, respectively. This approach
allowed high stringency alignments for even short
sequences. The default Blast remote server (please see
Availability & requirements for more information) was
used to achieve the most updated database matches.
The Mapping tool of Blast2GO software v1.3.3 was used
to obtain GO information from retrieved database
matches. Annotation of all sequences was performed with
different parameters on two ranges of length, 0–199 bp
and ≥ 200 bp. Pre-e-value Hit Filter was set to 0 and 3,
respectively, and GO weight constantly to 5.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/347

better matches for shorter sequences. Subsequently, InterProScan [47] was performed to find functional motifs and
related GO terms by using the specific tool implemented
in the Blast2GO software with the default parameters.
Finally, the 'Augment Annotation by ANNEX' function
was used to refine annotations (please see Availability &
requirements for more information; [48]). The GOslim
'goslim_plant.obo' was used to achieve specific GO terms
by means of a plant-specific reduced version of the Gene
Ontology (please see Availability & requirements for more
information). This approach is summarized in Figure 6.
Diagrams and graphical representations
The output data of the Blast2GO software were exported
in text format, imported into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and used to generate pie charts. The hierarchical
representation of the gene ontology is structured according to different levels, from the top (level 1) parents corresponding to the three main GO categories (cellular
component, biological process, molecular function) to
the lowest more specialized child terms (level 2, 3, 4, etc.).
In the present research, GO annotated datasets were represented at level 2. This level was chosen because it greatly
facilitates comparisons among sequence sets by pointing
out the most significant differences. Since Blast2GO
allows to perform a multilevel analysis, the GO annotations of cDNA-AFLP-derived sequences were also reported
(see Additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) by counting the terms
at the lowest node per branch that fulfils the filter parameters (e.g. the multilevel tool will find all the lowest nodes
with the given number of sequences or score value to be
plotted jointly). This different approach may offer a second perspective of the annotation of AFLP records by representing a compromise between specificity and
representativeness of sequence records.

The Venn diagram was traced by counting the type of
annotation using a Perl script.
Statistical analyses
Basic statistics were calculated for sequence length (bp),
sequence similarity (%) and expectation value (E). In
addition to the overall mean values, standard deviation
and variation coefficients were computed for the total
number of annotated sequences, sorted by either botanic
family or plant organism, over the three statistical parameters. A restrictive 68% confidence interval, corresponding
to the mean value plus and minus the standard deviation,
was also calculated along with lower and upper intervals
to describe the first two properties using the most representative sequence datasets, whereas median, minimum
and maximum values were used to report the third characteristic.

The similarity threshold was set at 60% and 30% for
sequences < 200 bp and ≥ 200 bp, respectively, to allow

Differences in terms of observed proportions of annotated
and non-annotated AFLP-derived sequences sorted by
organs/tissues, botanic families, and organisms (genus/
species) were tested using a chi-square contingency test
[68] for each GO term across the three GO vocabularies.
The statistical significance was then computed by performing a Fisher's exact test [69].

Availability & requirements

Bootstrapping was used to provide sampling standard
deviations and determining confidence intervals for the
proportion of annotated sequences over all taxonomic
groups. The vast majority of taxonomic groups were represented by at least 70 sequences, with an average number
of 229 per species/genus (if the outgroup of Nicotiana spp.
represented by 2,295 sequences is not taken into account,
since it is the most numerous). The calculations were performed using the 2,235 singlets of Nicotiana spp. with a
number of non-overlapping random replicates of 32, 15
and 10 each formed by a number of sequences of 70, 149
and 224, respectively. This analysis provided a convenient
way of making inferences on the reliability and reproducibility of GO results being the number of available
sequences highly variable (minimum 34 – maximum
2,295) across the 22 taxonomic groups.

ANNEX function, The Gene Ontology Annotation Toolbox: http://www.goat.no

Annotation index
An annotation index (Ai) was developed to describe the
information content of transcriptome-derived sequence
collections on the basis of the GO vocabularies. This coefficient takes into account the number (N) of annotation
terms for CC, BP, and MF, and the number of term combinations of two or all three GO vocabularies. Ai can be
computed as follows:
Ai =

NCC + NBP + NMF + 2N(CC + BP )+ 2N(CC + MF )+ 2N(BP + MF )+ 3N(CC + BP + MF )
xPAS
T NS

where TNS corresponds to the total number of sequences
and PAS is the proportion of annotated sequences. As a
consequence, the ratio between the sum of numbers of
simple and combined annotation terms and the total
number of sequences gives a "qualitative" information,
whereas the proportion of annotated sequences over the
total is purely a "quantitative" information. In silico simulations performed with sets of 1,000 sequences revealed
that Ai values can range between 0.2 and 3.0 (data not
shown): the higher is the proportion of sequences associated with combinations of terms belonging to two and
three GO vocabularies, the higher is the value of annotation coefficient. For instance, when the percentage of
sequences associated with only one, a combination of two
or all three GO terms is equivalent (i.e. 33.3%, 33.3% and
33.3%), then the Ai value corresponds to 1, 1.5 and 2,
respectively with 50%, 75% and 100% of annotated
sequences (see Table 4).
