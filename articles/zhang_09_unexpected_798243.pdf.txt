Abstract
Background: Highly migratory species are usually expected to have minimal population
substructure because strong gene flow has the effect of homogenizing genetic variation over
geographical populations, counteracting random drift, selection and mutation. The migratory locust
Locusta migratoria belongs to a monotypic genus, and is an infamous pest insect with exceptional
migratory ability – with dispersal documented over a thousand kilometers. Its distributional area is
greater than that of any other locust or grasshopper, occurring in practically all the temperate and
tropical regions of the eastern hemisphere. Consequently, minimal population substructuring is
expected. However, in marked contrast to its high dispersal ability, three geographical subspecies
have been distinguished in China, with more than nine being biologically and morphologically
identified in the world. Such subspecies status has been under considerable debate.
Results: By multilocus microsatellite genotyping analysis, we provide ample genetic evidence for
strong population substructure in this highly migratory insect that conforms to geography. More
importantly, our genetic data identified an unexpected cryptic subdivision and demonstrated a
strong affiliation of the East China locusts to those in Northwest/Northern China. The migratory
locusts in China formed three distinct groups, viz. (1) the Tibetan group, comprising locusts from
Tibet and nearby West China high mountain regions; this is congruent with the previously
recognized Tibetan subspecies, L. m. tibetensis; (2) the South China group, containing locusts from
the Hainan islands; this corresponds to the Southeast Asia oriental tropical subspecies L. m.
manilensis; (3) the North China group, including locusts from the Northwest and Northern China
(the Asiatic subspecies L. m. migratoria), Central China and Eastern China regions. Therefore, the
traditional concept on Locusta subspecies status established from Uvarov in 1930s needs to be
revised. The three groups of locusts probably have separate evolutionary histories that were most
likely linked to Quaternary glaciations events, and derived from different ancestral refugial
populations following postglacial expansions.
Conclusion: The migratory locust populations in China have differentiated into three genetically
distinct groups despite high dispersal capability. While this clarified long-standing suspicions on the

subspecific diversification of this species in China, it also revealed that the locusts in the vast area
of East China are not the oriental subspecies but the Asiatic subspecies, an unexpected
substructuring pattern. The distribution pattern of the three locust groups in China may be
primarily defined by adaptive differentiation coupled to Quaternary glaciations events. Our results
are of general significance both for locust research and for phylogeographical study of flora and
fauna in China, illustrating the potential importance of phylogeographical history in shaping the
divergence and distribution patterns of widespread species with strong dispersal ability.

Background
Patterns of population genetic differentiation of an organism are shaped by various factors, such as geographical
barriers, ecological difference, and historical processes, as
well as the dispersal ability of the species. Highly migratory species are usually expected to have minimal population substructure over their distributional ranges because
strong gene flow can counteract the isolating effects of
geographical distance and physical barriers, and even
remove genetic differentiation due to local adaptation [1].
However, historical processes such as climatic fluctuations and geological events can modify their range, leading to population subdivision even in species with high
dispersal capabilities, as seen in some large mammals [2]
and insects [3].
The migratory locust Locusta migratoria, belonging to a
monospecific genus, is one of the most important agricultural pests in the world, and outbreaks were recorded as
early as in 13th century BC [4]. Its distributional area is
greater than that of any other locust or grasshopper [5],
occurring in practically all the temperate and tropical
regions of the eastern hemisphere (Asia, Europe, Africa
and Australasia) from 154 m below sea level in Xinjiang
(Sinkiang) to about 4,600 m above sea level on the
Tibetan plateau [6]. Such a vast distribution and monospecific status suggest exceptional migratory ability, and
indeed dispersal over a thousand kilometers has been
documented [7,8]. Consequently, minimal population
substructure is expected within its distributional range.
Nevertheless, some nine geographical subspecies have
been distinguished biologically and morphologically [912], three of which are present in China, viz: Locusta
migratoria migratorioides, L. m. tibetensis, and L. m. manilensis. There is considerable debate on the reliability of the
subspecific status so identified [11,13,14], since morphological characters are readily influenced by regional climatic and habitat variation, and identification of
subspecies has often been based on locality rather than
critical examination of specimens [5]. This is particularly
so for locusts in China with perennial doubts of their subspecific affinities [11,14].
Additionally, phylogeographical study in China as a
whole is still underpresented [15], and genetic data are

particularly scanty for deducing what has happened to the
biomes during glaciations and deglaciations in past Quaternary cycles in China. This further impinges on the origins of species in neighboring areas in the Palaearctic and
also North America [16,17], and is an important issue for
understanding global effects of Pleistocene climate variations [18]. Thus, large geographical scale phylogeographical study in East Asia is pressingly needed and likely to
reveal hidden patterns of biogeographic evolution. Here
we present an extensive population genetic survey of the
migratory locust in China using highly polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers. We aim to explore the following
questions: (1) Whether the subspecific patterns morphologically identified for the migratory locust in China are
genetically supported; (2) How to explain the patterns in
the context of biogeographic evolution, given the strong
dispersal capabilities of the insect? We provide robust
genetic evidence for strong population structure and an
unexpected cryptic subdivision in this insect in China,
clarifying some long-standing issues in the subspecific
divergence of this insect. We suggest that historical phylogeographical factors and the associated ecological adaptation have played important roles in shaping the observed
genetic and geographic patterns in this highly migratory
insect.

Results
In total, 1381 individual locusts from 26 localities (Figure
1) were genotyped at eight nuclear microsatellite loci [19].
After corrections for multiple comparisons, no linkage
disequilibrium was detected for the eight loci employed,
but most population samples (23 out of 26) deviated
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at one to five
loci. Micro-Checker identified that the presence of null
allele(s) potentially contributed to this deviation. Estimated frequencies of null alleles per locus per sample
ranged from 0 to 0.438 (only in five cases, the value was
>0.4), and in 112 of the 208 locus-sample combinations
the values were greater than 0.05. The most frequent null
allele frequencies were in the range of 0 – 0.1. The average
null allele frequencies over loci (Fnull) vary from 0.048
(BaM) to 0.217 (F) among population samples (Table 1).
At locus LmIOZc36, null alleles were detected in all 26
samples (with the frequency ranging between 0.208 –
0.429). If this locus was excluded, nearly half of samples

were in HWE at the remaining seven loci. Three complementary approaches were performed to examine the relationships of the locust populations studied, i.e. genetic
distance based neighbor-joining approach, Bayesian
inference and principal component analysis. There was no
significant change in results if the locus LmIOZc36 was
excluded from the data. Each analysis was conducted separately on two data sets: the original data set without correction for null alleles and the data set corrected for null
alleles. Since highly congruent results were obtained in
such analyses, we only show the results from the original
data set.
Figure 2 shows the neighbor-joining population tree
based on Cavalli-Sforza's chord distance (Dc) from the
microsatellite loci [tree based Nei's standard genetic distance (Ds) has highly concordant topology]. It indicates
that the Chinese locust populations studied are clustered

genetically into three major groups each with strong bootstrap support: (1) the Tibetan group (orange clade in Figure 2), comprising locusts from Tibet and nearby West
China high mountain regions (R, L and SCJSJ); this is congruent with the previously recognized Tibetan subspecies,
L. m. tibetensis [12]; (2) the South China group (red clade),
containing locusts from the Hainan islands (hNLD,
hNSYms, hNSY1, and hNSY2); this corresponds to the
Southeast Asia tropical subspecies L. m. manilensis [11];
(3) the North China group (blue clade), including locusts
from the Northwest China (NWC), Northern China (NC),
Central China (CC) and Eastern China (EC) regions,
which are originally assigned as L. m. migratoria (NWC &
NC) and L. m. manilensis (CC & EC).
Additional file 1 (Table S1) gives the pairwise FST values
between the locust populations. FST values between populations of different groups range between 0.023 – 0.149,

and are significantly different from zero, indicating that
the three groups are moderately to strongly differentiated
(Additional file 1 (Table S1)). Within each group, populations are genetically similar; FST values among populations in general are small (0.000 – 0.010) and not
significantly different from zero for most pair-wise comparisons (excepting the Tibetan group and some populations of the North China group, see below) (Additional
file 1 (Table S1)).
The results of principal component analysis (PCA) of the
microsatellite genotype data are shown in Figure 3. The
Chinese locust populations form three clusters "Tibetan",
"South China" and "North China", which is identical to
patterns seen in the neighbor-joining population tree
based on Dc (Figure 3).
Figure 4 shows the results of Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis. It also inferred three clusters (K = 3) for the Chinese
locust populations (the mean Dirichlet parameter Alpha
(α) for degree of admixture is 0.041 at K = 3), corresponding to the three major groups identified in the aforementioned phylogenetic approach (Figure 2) and PCA
analysis (Figure 3). At various defined K values (simulated

from 2 to 8, Figure 4), the Tibetan group and the South
China group each remains as a fixed cluster (except at K =
2, where these two groups merged as one cluster, with the
rest of the populations as the other cluster). At higher K
values (4–8), the locusts in North China group keep splitting further, albeit apparently irregularly (Figure 4).
Table 2 displays the results of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of the microsatellite data. AMOVA was
used here to examine which grouping of the Chinese
locust has the maximum among group variance, and
whether the traditional taxonomic classification of the
Chinese locust has a high among-group variance. The
maximum among-group variance (5.11%) was obtained
only when populations are partitioned as Tibetan, South
China and North China groups as seen above. If the North
China group is further divided into two subgroups, i.e. the
Mengxin subgroup and East China subgroup, then
AMOVA results show that the among-group variance
between Mengxin and East China subgroups (0.24%) is
insignificant compared to the within-group-among-population variance (0.26%). Thus, such a division makes no
biological sense. In marked contrast, the among-group
variance between East China subgroup and the South

Discussion
Patterns of genetic differentiation and unexpected cryptic
subdivision
The present multilocus microsatellite genotyping analysis
studied 25 population samples from all three subspecies
of the migratory locust in China, namely the Asiatic
migratory locust L. m. migratoria, the oriental migratory
locust L. m. manilensis, and the Tibetan migratory locust L.
m. tibetensis. Overall, our data revealed that the migratory
locust populations in China have differentiated into three
distinct groups: the Tibetan clade (orange circles in Figure
1), the South China clade (red coded) and the North
China clade (blue and green coded). This genetic pattern
is concordant with geographic distribution, and was
strongly supported by several complementary approaches
(Figures 2, 3, 4 and Table 2, genetic distance-based phylogenetic approach, multivariate method, Bayesian cluster-

ing inference and variance analysis, respectively). We
emphasize that the principal component analysis does
not make strong assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and Bayesian inference does not take into account
the sample locations of individuals. The concordance
between these approaches indicates the robustness of the
patterns revealed. The above genetic pattern largely confirms the subspecific diversification in this species recognized from biological and morphological data
[5,6,10,12]. A major, unexpected disagreement exists,
however, between our genetic data and the traditional
treatment of subspecific status of the locusts in East China
(green circles in Figure 1). Traditionally, locusts in the
immense area of East China and South China (e.g. Hainan
islands, red circles in Figure 1) have been classified as the
subspecies L. m. manilensis [5,6,10], this being an accepted
concept since Uvarov's work in 1930s [10]. Our genetic
data have identified a cryptic subdivision between these
locusts, and demonstrate a strong affiliation of the locusts
in East China to those in Northwest/Northern China
(blue circles in Figure 1) instead of those in South China.
An issue related to the sampling scheme deserves some
consideration before we can draw any firm conclusion
from the above observations. In our study, all population
samples from South China are from the Hainan islands
with no sample from the adjacent continent. (Although

the migratory locusts were recorded in continental South
China, in most of the time they form only solitary populations of low density. We failed to obtain any sample
from there after several attempts). Thus one possibility is
that the observed population structure might reflect the
effect of gene flow barrier between the island and the continent populations, with simply an artifact of insufficient
sampling in South China. Several lines of evidence argue
against this suggestion. First, the minimum distance
between Hainan islands and the main continent is only
20 km (the width of the Qiongzhou Strait that separates
the island and the continent varies between 20 to 30 km
[20]), which does not form an effective barrier of gene
flow. Long-distance migration of locusts in Hainan has

been well documented [14]. Second, revisiting the earlier
literature carefully revealed that in the 1990s ecologists
and taxonomists had already noticed some subtle morphological differences between locusts in East China and
South China (Hainan region) [14] and the somewhat
closer affiliation in certain morphometric measures of the
East China locusts to those in the Mengxin region [21].
For example, Ding questioned in 1995 whether the migratory locusts in East China are really the oriental subspecies
as seen in Hainan, since the black strip marking on both
sides of the pronotum found in the solitary locusts from
Hainan were not present in the majority of locusts from
East China [14] (however his view has received little attention). This lends independent support to our genetic find-

HBAX, HNLB, HNMS, HNLK, JSPX, LNHLD, LNJZ SDDY, SXYJ, sSXDL, TJ,), Mengxin = (Ai, BaM, Bo, HaM, JLNA), South China = (hNLD,
hNSYms, hNSY1, HnSY2), and Tibetan = (L, R, SCJSJ). Traditionally, (East China + South China) has been considered to belong to the oriental
subspecies. Please refer to Figure 1 for their location.

ings. Third, there exists significant physiological
difference in cold hardiness between North China populations and the Hainan populations, with the North
China locusts being adapted to cold winter weather and
the South China locusts to hot tropical climate [22].
Therefore, our genetic data confirmed earlier suspicions
on the subspecies status of the migratory locusts in East
China, and suggest that the traditional concept established from Uvarov [10] needs to be revised: the locusts in
the vast area of East China are not the oriental subspecies
but the Asiatic subspecies, and thus have a different evolutionary history from locusts in South China. Recently,
Chapuis et al. [23] have reported the existence of intraspecific subdivision in this highly migratory insect by microsatellite DNA analysis of rangewide samples, which
appeared to not correspond well to traditional subspecies
taxonomy. Our results readily clarify some of the oddities
observed in their study – viz. why do the oriental migratory locusts in East China (their collecting site no. 15) not
cluster with their consubspecifics in Southeast Asia? This
is because they belong to different subspecies.
Phylogeographical implications of the observed
differentiation patterns
Highly migratory species are usually expected to have
minimal population substructure over their distributional
ranges [24] because strong gene flow has the effect of
homogenizing genetic variation over geographical populations, counteracting random drift, selection and mutation [1,24-26]. In contrast, both the traditional

morphometric and our complementary genetic analyses
demonstrated a largely concordant differentiation pattern
of locust populations in China. This suggests that either
the dispersal ability of the migratory locust is not as strong
as thought (such that gene flow cannot effectively prevent
geographical populations from drifting apart genetically),
or some other processes are involved, which caused population divergence. However, the strong migratory ability
of the migratory locust (especially long-distance migration) has been well documented [7,8]. Our results also
revealed that populations separated over 1000 km in East
China do not show genetic differentiation (Additional file
1) and there is no isolation by distance (IBD) within this
region (data not shown). From classical population
genetic theory, this indicates strong gene flow across large
geographical area homogenizing populations, confirming
the migratory locust as a strong disperser. It further indicates that geographical distance does not constitute a barrier for gene flow in this insect in China. Similarly, no
physical barriers preventing locust migration seem to exist
in East and South China, for example, locusts in East
China and the Mengxin region are well connected despite
the Taihangshan mountain chains (at 3,058 m) separating
them.
Among the other processes likely involved in the divergence of the locust populations (e.g. habitat patchness,
local extinction/recolonization events, phenological isolation, behavioral difference), we believe that historical
process, such as historical climatic fluctuations played a
primary role. The impact of Pleistocene glaciations cycles

on floral and faunal distributions is now well recognized,
being a major force shaping population diverging patterns
in many organisms [16,17]. As a common scenario, populations were isolated in different refugial areas during
glacial periods and diverged genetically from each others,
subsequently extending their ranges by (re)colonization
as the favourable climatic and ecological conditions
resumed. This is also plausible for the migratory locust
[27]. For example, in China in the mid-latitudes (30 –
40°N), at the last glacial maximum (LGM, ~20 kya), significant southward and eastward extension of steppe and
desert biomes occurred. Cool mixed forests shifted c.
1,000 km eastward into the lowlands, and the northern
boundary of broadleaved evergreen/warm mixed forests
was displaced southward by c. 1,000 km [28]. Over the
whole of north and east China, climatic conditions were
much drier and colder in the LGM than today. A reduction
of temperature between 7 to 12°C has been estimated
[29,30], with a fall of sea level along the East China Sea
coast up to 140 m [28]. Consequently, during the LGM in
the areas where the North China group of locusts is found
today, north to the latitude 38–40°N (eastern part) and
37–39°N (western part) were permafrost [31], and in the
vast East China steppe and desert were the dominant vegetation types, with herbaceous plants being composed
mainly of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae [29,31-33].
These plants, which are indicators of cold conditions and
also cause high death rate of hoppers (95%) or abortion
of the moulting process [6,11,34], are not suitable food
for the migratory locusts. Therefore, we can deduce that at
the LGM the migratory locusts were very unlikely to survive in these areas. This means that locusts found today in
these areas originated by recolonization from elsewhere
after the LGM.

as favorable breeding areas of the locusts during glacial
times.

The most likely source of origin of locusts in North China
is glacial refugia in the Black, Caspian and possibly Aral
Seas basins regions, given that (1) recent climatic modelling studies have identified these regions as potential refugia areas along with the well known Iberian Peninsula,
Italy, and the Balkans [35], (2) these regions have been
shown to be refugia for many fresh water species [17,36],
(3) the migratory locusts in these areas and North China
belong to the same subspecies, L. m. migratoria [9,10,27],
and (4) there existed independent evidence in scorpions
that eastward postglacial expansion from the above
regions to China was an important biogeographic component [37] (unpublished data, Shi CM & Zhang DX). Our
proposition on the refugial area is reinforced by Chapuis
et al.'s [23] recent study on rangewide Locusta populations
from 25 collecting sites (including two sites in China,
both in the northern region); they demonstrated a closer
genetic affinity of North China locusts to those in central
Asia. The lowland shores and surrounding reed-beds and
deltas of several important rivers in these areas could serve

Therefore, circumstantial evidence suggests that the three
genetically distinct locust groups in China were isolated
from each other during evolution most likely coupled to
Quaternary glaciation events, and were derived from different glacial refugial populations following postglacial
expansions. Although we have focused our discussion
above on LGM as this is the glaciation best understood,
the differentiation patterns observed in the locust could
well be a combined consequence of several glaciations
cycles. Glacier studies in Tibetan Plateau have identified
three major glaciation events in China in the Quaternary
that were of great amplitude and left recognizable footprints (glacier relics) [39], including the LGM. Further
study with DNA sequence data is clearly needed to more
precisely estimate the time scale of differentiation of
locust populations.

There is not enough evidence to deduce how the South
China group of locusts (red circles in Figure 1) was
affected by past glaciations. These locusts are most likely
of Southeast Asia origin (locusts in Southeast Asia such as
the nearby Indo-China Peninsula and the Philippines are
all known as the tropical subspecies L. m. manilensis), considering recorded invasions of locusts from the Philippines to the Taiwan islands [10] and comparable tropical
Savannah breeding habitat in these regions [14]. By contrast, the Tibetan group probably developed from local
refugial sources. This group of locusts has a closer affinity
to the outgroup, the African migratory locust, than the
other two groups, and shows a strong within-group divergence pattern (Figures 2 and 3). Wright's F-statistics also
indicate significant population differentiation within this
group (Additional file 1; FST>0.11 between SCJSJ and L/
R), suggesting local isolation of geographical populations
over a sufficiently long period of time. Pollen evidence
suggests that the southern and eastern edges of the
Tibetan plateau had favorable climatic conditions during
the last glacial [38], being important refugial places for
plants and animals. Thus, the present populations have
probably been derived from glacial refugia in these areas,
and local geography (high mountainous landscape)
should have further enhanced genetic differentiation
among populations. Interestingly, the present distribution pattern of the Tibetan group locusts largely parallels
the distribution pattern of the broadleaved forests at LGM
in Tibet, albeit shifted somewhat internally, and this is
indicative of the refugial areas of the locusts and directions of postglacial expansion.

Factors maintaining the current isolation of locust
populations
How is the substructuring pattern of locust populations in
China maintained given the strong dispersal ability of this
insect? Distributional patterns of species are molded by a
number of factors, including barriers to dispersal, physical
and biological factors that make particular regions of habitat unsuitable for viability and/or reproduction [40]. The
actual geographic distribution is defined by the complex
interaction of the environment, the species fundamental
ecological niche, and particular biological realities and
historical events [41-46]. It is known that once populations have become genetically differentiated, their divergence status can be maintained if they have differentially
adapted to regional ecological conditions, since geographic variation in selection can act as a strong barrier to
gene flow [26,47]. This is likely the case to the migratory
locust even though it is a strong disperser. The significant
physiological difference in cold hardiness between North
China (Mengxin region + East China) populations and
the Hainan populations [22] reflects differential selection
in this species in different regions potentially linked to
historical isolation (see above). That is, the migratory
locust populations in different refugial areas during glaciations periods could have undergone allopatric (or parapatric) divergence with adaptive evolution, and shifted to
different adaptive landscapes. Thus, populations in Tibet
have adapted to the ecological and climatic conditions at
high altitude, the South China populations to subtropical
and tropical conditions, and the North China populations
to temperate conditions. This should have ecologically
restricted their distributional ranges in postglacial expansions, and then prevented effective migration among ecologically different regions. Therefore, the current pattern
of distribution of the three locust groups in China appears
to be primarily defined by adaptive difference which has
acted as barriers to gene flow. As a consequence, the current effective gene flow is weak and has little genetic consequence; that is, it is not strong enough to wipe out the
patterns of differentiation created during historical isolation.

Conclusion
In summary, the migratory locust populations in China
have differentiated into three distinct groups despite high
dispersal capability, and the locusts in the vast area of East
China are not the oriental subspecies but the Asiatic subspecies. It suggests that these groups of locusts have separate evolutionary histories most likely molded by
Quaternary glaciations events, and derived from different
ancestral refugial populations following postglacial
expansions. The population substructuring patterns
observed in the migratory locusts, as reported here and in
Chapuis et al. [23], are of general significance both for
locust research and for phylogeographical study of flora

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/144

and fauna in China and beyond, and are illustrating for
widespread species with strong dispersal ability. In view of
our sampling density and results obtained, it suggests that
far more population samples are needed in order to study
the worldwide population genetic structure and biogeographic evolution of highly mobile species, such as the
migratory locust.

Methods
Sample collection and microsatellite genotyping
Locust samples studied here includes four subspecies
based on locality and morphology, viz. the Asiatic migratory locust L. m. migratoria (occurring in temperate E.
Europe to N. China, Korea and Japan), the oriental migratory locust L. m. manilensis (in E. and S. Asia and the
Pacific region), the Tibetan migratory locust L. m. tibetensis
(in Tibet and nearby W. China), and the African subspecies L. m. migratorioides (in Africa south of the Sahara and
off shore Atlantic islands). The last one was used as the
outgroup. Solitary Locusta migratoria individuals were collected between 1998 and 2001, stored either in DMSOsalt solution or in absolute ethanol at 4°C (Table 1). The
Chinese insects were sampled over their distributional
range across China (Table 1, Figure 1). In total, 1381 individual locusts from 26 localities were used in this study.
Genomic DNA was extracted using a modified phenolchloroform procedure as described by Zhang and Hewitt
[48]. Each individual was genotyped at eight microsatellite loci [19] on an ABI PRISM™ 3100 Genetic Analyzer
using Pop4 gel matrix with GENESCAN® 400HD (ROX) as
the internal size standard. Sizes of the amplified microsatellites were scored by GeneScan 3.7 and manually
checked for every allele. A blank control was carried out
along each set of DNA extractions and PCR amplifications
to monitor any possible cross contamination. Samples
that did not amplify at more than two loci were excluded
from further analysis.

Note that mitochondrial DNA of locusts is of little use for
population genetic studies due to the presence of numerous pseudogenes in the nuclear genome [49], and nuclear
ribosomal ITS regions do not contain enough sequence
variation (DXZ's unpublished data).
Data analysis
Heterogeneity testing was carried out for the two sexes and
multiple samples collected from the same areas before
pooling them in analysis, and no genetic difference was
observed [50]. Basic population genetic parameters (the
number of alleles, the observed and expected heterozygosity per locus) were estimated with MSTools 3.0 [51].
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium were tested using GENEPOP ver. 3.4 [52], GDA
[53] and ARLEQUIN ver. 3.0 [54], with sequential Bonfer-

roni correction for critical significance levels. Null alleles
were examined with Micro-Checker [55].
Wright's F-statistics (FST or θ), measures of population
subdivision, were calculated using FSTAT 2.9.3 [56] and
ARLEQUIN. Statistical significance of the estimates was
evaluated by permutation or bootstrap procedure. Exact
test of population differentiation has been carried out
using GENEPOP, and the significance levels were assessed
by Markov chain procedure.
AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) was performed
using the program implemented in ARLEQUIN. AMOVA
was used to examine which grouping of the Chinese
locusts has the maximum among group variance, and
whether the traditional taxonomic classification of the
Chinese locust has a high among group variance. The traditional taxonomic classification is as follows (Figure 1;
Table 1): Locusts in the Qinhai-Tibet plateau region
belong to the Tibetan subspecies (L. m. tibetensis), locusts
in Mengxin region in North China (Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Northeast China) the Asiatic subspecies (L. m.
migratoria) and locust in East and South China the oriental subspecies (L. m. manilensis) [6,10,12]. This is equivalent to the grouping [Mengxin/(East China + South
China)/Tibetan] (Table 2). The genetic analysis suggested
the following grouping: [North China (= East China +
Mengxin)/South China/Tibetan]. In addition to these two
groupings, various other alternative groupings were also
examined (Table 2), including: [East China/South China],
[North China/South China], [(East + South China)/
Mengxin], [East China/Mengxin], [South China/
Mengxin], [East China/Tibetan], [Mengxin/Tibetan],
[South China/Tibetan], [North China/Tibetan] and other
multiple population combinations.
PHYLIP ver. 3.6 [57] was used for calculating the genetic
distances and constructing population phylogenetic trees.
Nei's standard genetic distance (Ds) and Cavalli-Sforza's
chord distance (Dc) were estimated using the program
GENDIST. Dc distance based tree topology is generally
more robust for gene frequency data [58] and insensitive
to null alleles [59]. 1,000 bootstrap replicates were performed to obtain statistical support for inferred trees.
A Bayesian clustering analysis implemented in the program STRUCTURE [60] was also used to infer population
structure in the locust. This method allows the assignment
of individual insects to distinct clusters based on their
genotypes, without using sampling locations, hypothesized genetic origins of individuals or phenotypic information. Trial runs were first tested with varying length of
iterations (104–106) after a burn-in period of various
lengths (104–106). We found that stationarity was reached
with a burn-in period of 1 × 104 iterations, and data col-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/144

lection for ≥1 × 105 iterations produced highly consistent
results. Independent runs with different K values each
with several replicates were then performed using a burnin period of 1 × 105 iterations and data collection for 1 ×
106 iterations, with a model of correlated allele frequencies. A criterion recommended for selecting the appropriate K value is the estimated posterior probability of the
data, P(K/X) (see the program manual). For complex datasets with many groups, this criterion is difficult to apply.
We have observed that the Dirichlet parameter Alpha (α)
for degree of admixture appears to be a more reliable indicator of the 'correct' K value. For the clustering pattern
with the most appropriate population structure (at the
simulated 'correct K'), admixture among populations (the
inferred clusters) should be minimal, and therefore α
should be minimal; for values smaller or larger than the
'correct' K, α should always be larger. Thus, the smallest K
with the smallest α is most likely the real structure contained in the data. It is expected that departures of data
from HWE may lead to overestimating K. While this could
particularly be a problem for closely related populations,
it should have little influence on divergent populations.
Graphical display of the results of STRUCTURE was done
with the program DISTRUCT by N. A. Rosenberg [61].
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with
PCA-GEN [62], incorporating 1,000 randomizations, and
verified independently using the statistic software package
SPSS ver. 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). As a complementary approach to model-based genetic analyses
described above, this multivariate method does not make
strong assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or
linkage equilibrium in the data.
