The secret life of kinases: functions beyond
catalysis
Jens Rauch1*, Natalia Volinsky1, David Romano1 and Walter Kolch1,2*

Abstract
Protein phosphorylation participates in the regulation of all fundamental biological processes, and protein kinases
have been intensively studied. However, while the focus was on catalytic activities, accumulating evidence
suggests that non-catalytic properties of protein kinases are essential, and in some cases even sufficient for their
functions. These non-catalytic functions include the scaffolding of protein complexes, the competition for protein
interactions, allosteric effects on other enzymes, subcellular targeting, and DNA binding. This rich repertoire often is
used to coordinate phosphorylation events and enhance the specificity of substrate phosphorylation, but also can
adopt functions that do not rely on kinase activity. Here, we discuss such kinase independent functions of protein
and lipid kinases focussing on kinases that play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis, and motility.

Introduction
Kinases are conserved during evolution. Orthologs with
‘kinase domains’ (so-called protein kinase-like folds; PKL)
are found in all three domains of life, [1]. Interestingly,
comparing the ‘kinomes’ from nematodes, insects, and
vertebrates a surprising number of kinases are shared. In
eukaryotes, the protein kinase family is one of the largest
gene families, counting for about 2% of all genes. The
human genome contains 518 putative protein and lipid
kinases. Based on sequence similarities they can be divided
into 9 groups of conventional kinases, which feature a
typical kinase domain sequence, and 8 small groups of
unconventional kinases, which lack typical kinase domain
sequences but reportedly possess biochemical kinase activity [2,3]. Almost half of the human kinases can be mapped
to known disease loci, cancer amplicons, and mutations or
their deregulation can be directly correlated to human disease. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that kinases are
intensively studied, and kinase inhibitors have now a firm
place in the pharmaceutical armoury.
The importance of protein phosphorylation is underlined by a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded

to Edmond H. Fischer and Edwin G. Krebs in 1992
“for their discoveries concerning reversible protein phosphorylation as a biological regulatory mechanism”. Their
key discovery about 55 years ago was that the conversion
of the inactive enzyme phosphorylase b to the active phosphorylase a is caused by phosphorylation, and that the
conversion factor is a protein kinase, phosphorylase kinase
[4,5]. That breakthrough has established a firm role for
protein kinases in the regulation of diverse fundamental
cellular processes and spawned an immensely fruitful field
of kinase research. At the same time this success, however,
has blinkered us to solely concentrate on the catalytic
activities of kinases neglecting other functions of these
proteins, which do not require the phosphotransferase
activity.
Early examples of non-catalytic functions of protein
kinases were discovered in yeast. In 1997 Posas and
Saito showed that the yeast Pbs2p protein can serve
both as a scaffolding protein and a protein kinase [6].
The adaptation of the yeast S. cerevisiae to high osmolarity is regulated by two independent pathways, which
both contain a three-tiered cascade of kinases. In one of
these pathways Pbs2p serves as a bona fide kinase
(MAPKK), which links signalling from SSK2/SSK22 (a
MAPKKK) to HOG1 (a MAPK). In the other pathway

Pbs2p functions both as a kinase and a scaffold by
assembling a complex of Sho1p, Ste11p, and Hog1p proteins and at the same time providing the kinase link
between Ste11p and Hog1p (Figure 1A). In another
example from budding yeast, Madhani and colleagues
showed in 1997 that the MAPK Kss1 has important
non-catalytic functions [7]. Non-phosphorylated Kss1
inhibits filamentation and haploid invasion through the
kinase independent inhibition of the Ste12-Tec1 transcription factor complex. Phosphorylation by Ste7 (a
MAPKK) activates Kss1 catalytic activity and converts Kss1
from a repressor of filamentation into an activator. This
second function of Kss1 requires its kinase activity, which
acts to stimulate the Ste12-Tec1 complex (Figure 1B).
Although these discoveries are not only early but still
some of the clearest examples for a dual function of protein kinases, this new conceptual view did not gain traction until the last few years where a flurry of other
examples began to emerge and are now receiving sharply
increasing attention.
This review presents a synopsis of protein kinase functions that are independent of catalytic activity, with a
special focus on kinases involved in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell adhesion and migration. A comprehensive summary is given in Table 1. Due to
space constraints we do not discuss the functions of pseudokinases, but only review recent results suggesting that in
some cases their catalytic activities have developed to
become highly specialized rather than being lost.
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK)

Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) comprise a family of
about 60 cell surface receptors, which act as docking
platforms for polypeptide-based growth factors, cytokines, and hormones [8]. RTKs are starting points for

Page 2 of 28

several signalling pathways, and hence are not only key
regulators of many normal cellular processes, but also
play a major role in development and progression of
many malignancies [9]. Among the 60 receptors of the
RTK family, several family members are involved in
mechanisms where no kinase activity is required.
The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) ERBB
family

The ERBB family of RTKs is one of the best known and
most extensively studied signal transduction networks with
implications ranging from cell division to cell death and
motility to cellular adhesion (extensively reviewed in
[10,11]). The receptor family consists of 4 members:
ERBB1 (also known as HER1 or EGFR), ERBB2 (also
known as HER2/neu), ERBB3 (HER3), and ERBB4 (HER4),
which can form homo- and heterodimers with specific
functions. 11 specific ligands are known to bind and activate ERBB receptors, which are the starting points of
downstream signalling pathways such as MAPK, AKT and
JNK signalling cascades [12].
The EGFR is activated by binding of several ligands,
including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming
growth factor alpha (TGFa). EGFR forms homodimers as
well as three functional heterodimers with the other members of the ERBB family, which stimulates its intrinsic
intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase activity and results in
autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the Cterminal domain of EGFR [13]. These phospho-tyrosines
serve as docking sites for an array of signal transducers
[14], including kinases, phosphatases, transcription factors,
and several adaptor proteins such as GRB2 and Shc, which
are responsible for the initiation of multiple downstream
signalling pathways. With this functional repertoire, it
comes as no surprise, that deregulation of expression
levels, gene amplifications and mutations of the EGFR or

Interestingly, in cancer tissues the expression level of
EGFR is correlated with prognosis, but not with responsiveness to EGFR inhibitor treatment [15]. This conundrum suggests that EGFR might contribute to tumor
progression independently of its kinase activity. Several
studies support this kinase-independent pro-survival
function of the EGFR.
First, loss of the kinase activity of the EGFR does not
produce phenotypes similar to the ablation of EGFR
protein expression [16]. While EGFR knockout animals
die soon after birth [17], animals expressing kinasedefective EGFR are viable and display only some epithelial defects [18].
Second, several groups reported the surprising results,
that a kinase-defective EGFR was capable to activate
downstream signalling (such as MAPK) and stimulate
DNA synthesis, while failing to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous substrates in response to EGF
[19-22]. These kinase activity independent signalling
included transcriptional effects, as kinase-deficient EGFR
could activate c-fos expression [23]. The mechanism may
include heterodimerization with other ERBB members.
For instance, the co-expression of a kinase-inactive mutant
of EGFR (K721M) with ERBB2 resulted in EGF-dependent
Akt and MAPK activation., while kinase-inactive EGFR
alone was ineffective [24]. ERBB2’s kinase activity, but not
tyrosine phosphorylation, was required for this activation.
These results suggest that EGFR has catalytic-independent

functions, which might be achieved by heterodimerization
with other members of the ERBB receptor family.
More recent studies provide more mechanistic insights
as to the nature of kinase-independent signalling, which
relies on protein-protein interactions. In 2008, Weihua et
al. reported that EGFR, independently of its kinase activity,
prevents cancer cells from autophagic cell death by maintaining the basal intracellular glucose level [16]. EGFR
interacts with and stabilizes the sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) in order to promote glucose uptake into
cancer cells (Figure 2A). Interestingly, inhibition of the
EGFR kinase activity did not block this association with
SGLT1 or decrease basal intracellular glucose levels suggesting that no kinase activity is required for this regulation. Similarly, the EGFR and its constitutively activated
variant EGFRvIII were shown to bind to and sequester the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member PUMA in the cytoplasm leading to tumour drug resistance [25] (Figure 2B).
These results have important implications for therapeutic approaches relying on agents that inhibit the
EGFR kinase activity, as the kinase independent functions
of EGFR may open escape routes, which for instance
maintain the viability of tumor cells even in the presence
of EGFR kinase inhibitors.
In addition to non-catalytic functions regulating
downstream effectors by the EGFR via direct protein
interactions, they also contribute to the regulation of
the localisation of the EGFR family itself. EGFR and
other ERBB receptors are known to be regulated by
endocytosis. Ligand binding induces the internalization

of the receptor into endosomes, where the receptors are
either targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation or
recycled back to the plasma membrane. While this process was thought to require kinase activation, newer
data suggest that rather than EGFR kinase activity,
dimerization is necessary and sufficient for internalization [26].
ERBB family receptors contain nuclear localisation signals [27] enabling them to translocate to the nucleus,
either as full length molecules (e.g. the EGFR) or as
fragments (e.g. ERBB4) after proteolytic processing [28]
(Figure 2C). Full-length EGFR trafficking from the
plasma membrane seems to involve the Sec61 translocon [29], where upon addition of EGF the cell surface
EGFR is trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum. There,
the EGFR associates with Sec61b, and is subsequently
retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytoplasm. The
EGFR lacks a DNA binding domain, but can interact
with several transcription factors, such as STATs3/5 and
E2F1, to activate the expression of iNOS, COX-2,
MYBL2 (B-Myb), and AURKA (Aurora A) genes [28].
As the induction of target gene expression could be
inhibited by EGFR inhibitor drugs, gene transactivation
seems to require catalytic EGFR activity. However, it is
unclear whether kinase activity is needed for nuclear
translocation or the actual transcriptional transactivation
function of the nuclear EGFR. Interestingly, a C-terminal ERBB4 fragment lacking the kinase domain is able
to activate transcription by associating with the YAP2
transcription factor [30], suggesting that the transactivation function may be independent of catalytic activity.
Along these lines it has been suggested that the proteolytic ERBB4 fragment serves as a chaperone for STAT5
[31] and YAP [32] that facilitates nuclear entry of these
transcription factors.

Kinase independent functions have been mainly
described for the ERBB family, but may be more widespread in RTK signaling. This is not surprising given that
the function of RTKs relies heavily on their abilities to
assemble multi-protein signaling complexes. Although
the focus has been on proteins recruited to tyrosine
phosphorylation dependent docking sites, there is
increasing evidence that a great number of proteins are
associated with RTKs independently of ligand, and that
at least some of these proteins also participate in the regulation of signaling [33].
Insulin like Growth Factor-1 Receptor (IGFR)

Another recent example for kinase independent signaling
is the IGFR, which could stimulate the ERK pathway
despite having its kinase activity blocked by chemical
IGFR inhibitors or even abolished by mutation [34]. ERK
activation also was independent of PI3K kinase activity or
phosphorylation of IRS, which is a multivalent adaptor
protein that mediates many of IGFR downstream signaling
events. By contrast, ERK activation was blocked by chemical inhibition of Src family kinases or Gb/g subunits of
heterodimeric G-proteins, indicating that G-protein
coupled receptor signaling participates in the kinase independent IGFR activation of ERK.
Kinase independent functions of Mitogen Activated
Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway components

MAPK pathways are ubiquitous signaling modules consisting of a three-tiered, and sometimes four-tiered, cascade of kinases that is activated by a small G-protein as
input (Figure 3A). The name mitogen activated protein
kinase is historic, but now indicates a range of pathways
that respond to a variety of stimuli including mitogens,
hormones, and stress signals [35]. The activation of the
first kinase, MAPKKK, is initiated by it binding to an

activated Ras or Rho family protein. MAPKKK then
phosphorylates and activates MAPKK, which are dual
specificity kinases that activate MAPK by phosphorylation of a tyrosine and threonine in the activation loop.
While signaling within the cascade is largely linear, the
terminal MAPK usually has a large number of substrates,
whose phosphorylation kinetics and localization contribute to the generation of specific biological outputs
[35,36]. The design of MAPK modules conveys interesting intrinsic properties, such as switchlike responses and
output stabilization [37,38].
Kinase independent functions of Raf kinases

Raf is the MAPKKK in the first MAPK pathway identified,
the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. This cascade is a main
effector pathway of ERBB receptors, and altered in a high
percentage of cancers usually be mutation of Ras or
BRAFgenes. ERK features more than 150 substrates
thereby regulating many fundamental cellular functions,

including proliferation, differentiation, transformation,
apoptosis and metabolism [39].
Raf proteins come in three isoforms (A-Raf, Raf-1, BRaf) encoded by different genes. A wealth of experimental data suggests that MEK1 and MEK2 are the only
bona fide Raf substrates. B-Raf has the strongest kinase
activity towards MEK, while Raf-1 is weaker and A-Raf
activity is barely detectable [40]. From an evolutionary
point of view and phylogenetic comparisons, the single
Raf homologs in invertebrates (lin-45 in Caenorhabditis
elegans and D-Raf in Drosophila melanogaster) are
much closer related to B-Raf in terms of sequence, than
Raf-1 and A-Raf [41,42]. This suggests that B-Raf is the
archetypal MEK kinase, whereas A-Raf and Raf-1 may
have evolved towards MEK-independent functions.
Furthermore, gene ablation experiments in mice showed
that Raf-1 is required for survival and protects against
apoptosis [43,44]. Of note, reconstituting Raf-1-/-mice

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

with a non-activatable Raf-1 mutant with reduced kinase
activity fully rescued the apoptotic phenotype and produced viable mice [43]. Taken together, these results
suggested, that Raf-1 (and A-Raf) might possess kinaseindependent functions. During the hunt for new Raf targets, new kinase-independent roles for Raf proteins
besides the MEK substrate have emerged. These include
the regulation of cell motility and differentiation by controlling the activity of ROK-a and the regulation of
apoptosis by suppressing the activity of the proapoptotic
kinases ASK1 and MST2, none of which requires Raf-1
kinase activity (reviewed in [45-47]).
Raf heteromers Over the years it emerged that Raf proteins are able to homo- and heterodimerize with each
other [48-50]. Interestingly, these allosteric mechanisms
of dimerization regulate kinase activity of the complexes.
One intriguing phenomenon was that even a catalytically compromised B-Raf was capable of inducing kinase
activity of Raf-1 in trans in a manner dependent on a
physical interaction between B-Raf and Raf-1, suggesting
that the underlying mechanism is independent of a simple transautophosphorylation route [46,51-53]. Only
recently, the exact mechanism of how these dimers are
regulated was discovered [54], which suggests that two
Raf proteins are found in a ‘side-to-side’ dimer configuration. Several proteins seem to be responsible for the
correct configuration, which include the scaffold KSR
and 14-3-3 proteins [54]. Additionally, two kinases,
MLK3 and DGKh can enhance and maintain Raf-1/BRaf heterodimer formation independently of their kinase
activity [55,56]. What has not been solved yet is the
mechanism how a kinase dead Raf protein can stimulate
the activity of another Raf protein in the context of a
heterodimer, but an allosteric mechanism is the most
plausible possibility. The observation that Raf-1 activation by heterodimerization with B-Raf seems to proceed
differently from the activation used by growth factors
[51], is in keeping with such an alternative mechanism
of Raf activation exerted by allosteric changes. Interestingly, Raf-1 and B-Raf also can induce allosteric conformation changes in KSR, which conveys KSR the ability
to phosphorylate MEK [57,58]. KSR is scaffolding protein that binds Raf, MEK and ERK, but whether KSR
also has kinase function is controversial with most evidence indicating that at least mammalian KSR proteins
lack kinase activity [59]. Although, in vitro MEK phosphorylation by KSR is weak and mainly occurs on sites
different from the known activating sites [57], work with
KSR1 knockout cells has suggested that KSR1 is
required for efficient ERK pathway activation in cells
[58]. This enhancement may reflect allosteric cooperativity between Raf and KSR, and maybe other MEK
kinases, when assembled into multi-protein complexes
in cells. This kind of complex formation may also play a

Page 11 of 28

pathophysiological role in cancer. It could explain the
surprising finding that a small number of B-Raf mutations occurring in tumors have reduced kinase activity,
and exert their oncogenic action by stimulating Raf-1
[52]. A therapeutically even more important observation
is that Raf inhibitory drugs can activate the ERK pathway, and in clinical trials may be responsible for some
adverse side effects of otherwise highly efficacious Raf
inhibitors [60,61]. This paradoxical activation of ERK
occurs in tumor cells with Ras mutations, which cooperate with Raf inhibitors to induce B-Raf-Raf-1 heterodimerization [62]. As the Raf heterodimer activates MEK
at least 30-fold stronger than B-Raf, but only requires
one Raf partner to have kinase activity [53], even a
slightly incomplete inhibition of Raf will promote ERK
pathway activation by Raf heterodimers.
ROK-a ROK-a is a direct effector of the Rho GTPase,
which is activated by binding to active Rho [63]. In Raf1 knockout cells ROK-a is hyperactivated and mislocalized to the membrane [64,65]. Furthermore, Raf-1mediated inhibition of ROK-a promotes cell migration
and reduces sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis [64,65].
Stimulation with growth factors induces an interaction
between the regulatory region of Raf-1 and the kinase
domain of ROK-a, resulting in inhibition of ROK-a
kinase activity [66] (Figure 3B). This in trans regulation
of a kinase domain by the regulatory domain of another
kinase introduces a new concept of kinase regulation
that may have important implications for signal coordination where the activation of one pathway automatically would inhibit another pathway. In a more recent
study, Raf-1-mediated inhibition of ROK-a was shown
to block keratinocyte differentiation, thus allowing both
the development and maintenance of Ras-driven epidermal tumors in mice [47,67]. Of interest, the regulation
of ROK-a by Raf-1 is exclusively mediated by proteinprotein interactions and does not require Raf-1 kinase
activity.
MST2 The other proapoptotic kinase, which is inhibited
by Raf-1, is mammalian sterile 20-like kinase, MST2,
which was identified in a proteomics screen of Raf-1associated proteins [68]. MST2 is activated by dimerization and autophosphorylation of the activation loop.
Raf-1 interferes with MST2 dimerization and autophosphorylation by binding to the MST2 SARAH domain,
which mediates MST2 dimerization (Figure 3D). Raf-1
kinase activity is not required for this regulation as
kinase-dead Raf-1 mutants, or even the mutant lacking
the complete kinase domain, also can inhibit MST2 activation. As a result, MST2 activity is constitutively elevated in Raf-1 knockout cells and hyperactivatable by
Fas stimulation or expression of RASSF1A [68,69].
Interestingly, the Raf-1-MST2 interaction is induced by
stress and relieved by mitogens. Upon stimulation of

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

cells, Ras binding to Raf-1 enables Raf-1 to activate the
ERK pathway and promote proliferation, but at the
same time dissociates the MST2-Raf-1 complex and
promotes apoptosis [70]. Coupling cell proliferation to
the risk of cell death seems paradoxical at first sight, but
this dual role makes perfect sense for higher organisms
where the uncontrolled proliferation of cells can lead to
severe diseases including cancer. In a subsequent study,
we could show that A-Raf, the third member of the Raf
family, also binds to and inhibits MST2 [71,72]. Similar
to Raf-1, A-Raf kinase activity is not required as kinasedead A-Raf mutants also can inhibit MST2 activation.
However, while Raf-1 binding to MST2 is induced by
stress and reduced by mitogens, A-Raf binds to MST2
constitutively and seems to promote the survival of cancer cells by restraining MST2 mediated apoptosis [71].
B-Raf binds MST2 only very weakly [68]. Thus, the
observed differential MST2 binding pattern inversely
correlates with the kinase activity towards MEK and the
evolution of the Raf family. B-Raf as the oldest member
possesses the strongest MEK kinase activity and the
lowest affinity for MST2, while the youngest member,
A-Raf, has the poorest MEK kinase activity but the
strongest capacity to bind and inhibit MST2 [72]. This
observation suggests that during evolution the role of
Raf might have shifted from activating the ERK pathway
to inhibiting the MST2 pathway.
From a therapeutic point of view, targeting these catalytic-independent Raf interactions (ROK-alpha, ASK1,
MST2) in cancer might prove to be a good strategy. Disruption of Raf-1/ROK-alpha might provoke the differentiation of epidermal skin tumor cells, while the
dissociation of Raf-1/A-Raf from ASK1 and MST2 should
activate these kinases to cause apoptosis in tumor cells.
ASK1 Another kinase, which is regulated by Raf-1 independent of its catalytic activity is apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK) (Figure 3C). ASK1 works as a
MAPKKK in the JNK and p38 MAPKs pathways to promote apoptosis induced by stress or by death receptors,
such as the TNF- receptor or Fas [73]. Raf-1 binds to
ASK1 inhibiting its kinase activity and apoptosis. Raf-1
catalytic activity was not required for the control of ASK1
as a kinase dead Raf-1 mutant inhibited ASK1 as potent as
wildtype Raf-1 [74]. Although the direct mechanism of
inhibition is not known yet, the pathophysiological relevance of ASK1 inhibition by Raf-1 was demonstrated in a
mouse model of heart disease [75]. A tissue-specific
knockout of the Raf-1 gene in the heart muscle resulted in
ventricular dilation and fibrosis caused by an increase in
cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These pathological changes
could be prevented by also knocking out the ASK1 gene.
Interestingly, ASK1 is able to induce apoptosis in a
kinase activity dependent and independent manner. The
kinase dependent way executes apoptosis via the activation

Page 12 of 28

of JNK and subsequent inactivation of Bcl-2 [76] and
stabilization c-Myc [77]. The kinase independent pathway
induces a caspase-independent form of cell death, which is
enhanced by the binding of ASK1 to Daxx [78]. The contribution of this kinase independent pathway to ASK1
induced cell death still needs to be clarified, as it relied on
the overexpression of ASK1 or kinase defective mutants.
In addition, Daxx is an activator of the ASK1 kinase activity, and Daxx induced apoptosis was reported to be
blocked by a kinase deficient ASK1 mutant [79]. Another
potential target of kinase-independent ASK1-induced
apoptosis is the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB
(NFB), a key regulator of immune and inflammatory
responses that exerts anti-apoptotic roles in various cells.
ASK1 directly interacts with TAK1 (transforming growth
factor-beta-activated kinase 1), a kinase involved in NFB
activation in response to inflammatory and cytokine signalling. ASK1inhibits NFB activation by interfering with
the formation of the TRAF6/TAK1 complex that mediates
interleukin-1 induced TAK1 activation [80]. This disruption renders cells vulnerable to apoptosis upon inflammatory stress.
ERK MAPK

ERK1 and ERK2 are the MAPKs at the end of this pathway featuring more than 150 known substrates, and it is
still far from clear how these diverse functions are coordinated in order to achieve the intended biological outcome
and specificity [39]. Besides their canonical kinase dependent functions, both ERK kinases were shown to influence
their substrates not only by phosphorylation, but also by
direct protein-protein interactions independently of ERK
kinase activity [81-83]. There are only few examples, but
as ERK tends to associate with its substrates in rather
stable pre-activation complexes [36] this type of regulation
may be more widespread than currently appreciated.
One example is topoisomerase IIa, an enzyme involved
in winding and unwinding of DNA and therefore crucial
in replication and transcription. Shapiro and co-workers
reported that topoisomerase IIa is activated by ERK by a
phosphorylation-independent process [84]. The exact
mechanism of this activation is not clear. Interestingly, it
requires a double phosphorylated ERK protein that is in
the activated conformation, but it does not rely on ERK
kinase activity itself. ERK is likely to induce a conformational change of the topoisomerase by a direct interaction,
thus leading to the expected regular DNA unwinding
activity of the topoisomerase [84].
Another interesting kinase independent target of ERK2
is PolyADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1), where no
kinase activity of ERK is required. PARPs catalyze the
posttranslational modification of nuclear proteins by polyADP-ribosylation. Usually, the catalytic activity of PARP-1
is stimulated by DNA strand breaks, and its activation is

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

required for initiation of DNA repair. Cohen-Armon and
co-workers report an alternative mode of activation [85],
where ERK2 interacts with PARP-1 and activates it independent of DNA strand breaks Figure 4B). Of note, these
findings indicate that while phosphorylation of ERK is
required for the interaction and activation of PARP-1, no
kinase activity of ERK2 is necessary for this process.
Another example is an enzyme that dephosphorylates
ERK, the phosphatase MKP3, which negatively regulates
ERK activation [86]. MKP3 directly interacts with ERK
through a region of the phosphatase termed kinase interaction motif (KIM). Interestingly, this interaction is independent of the phosphorylation status of ERK and its
kinase activity, as phosphorylation of the activating residues of ERK does not induce a dissociation of the ERKMKP3 complex. However, this interaction enhances the
phosphatase activity of MKP3. In addition, MKP3 is a

Page 13 of 28

mitogen induced gene and located in the cytosol [87].
These traits indicate that the association of MKP3 with
ERK also could be involved in a feedback regulation that
eventually shifts ERK activity to the nucleus. Thus,
MKP3 may not only function as inhibitor, but rather
shape spatiotemporal gradients of ERK activation. This
hypothesis needs further testing, but recent studies point
to an important role of MKPs to regulate spatiotemporal
aspects of ERK signaling [88].
Non-catalytic functions of ERK2 can be also linked with
interferon signaling [89]. ERK2 was surprisingly identified
in a large screen as a DNA-interacting protein. ERK binding to DNA was independent of kinase activity, direct, and
to a specific DNA sequence, GAAAC, found in the promoters of interferon-g (INFg) responsive genes. This
sequence motif is also bound by the C/EBP-b transcription
factor, and ERK2 acted as a transcriptional repressor by

Figure 4 Catalytic-independent functions of MAPKs. (A) Topoisomerase IIa, involved in winding and unwinding of DNA, is activated by ERK
by a phosphorylation-independent process. (B) Activated ERK2 interacts with PolyADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and activates it
independent of ERK kinase activity and DNA strand breaks. (C) ERK can repress INFg induced genes by directly binding to a specific DNA
sequence and displacing the CEBP-b transcription factor. (D) Activated ERK1 and ERK2 regulate the cell cycle entry by dislodging Rb from its
interaction with lamin A. Rb is released to the nucleoplasm and is rapidly phosphorylated and inactivated, leading to activation of the
transcription factor E2F and cell cycle entry. (E) p38 inhibits cell cycle progression by blocking Mirk/Dyrk1B transcriptional activity in proliferating
cells.

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

competing with C/EBP-b for DNA binding (Figure 4C). In
addition, kinase independent and dependent ERK functions may collaborate to form autoregulatory feedback
loops. In the case of INFg responsive genes, ERK can
repress their transcription by direct DNA binding. However, when ERK becomes activated it can phosphorylate
C/EBP-b which displaces ERK from the DNA and stimulates gene transcription. The increase in nuclear ERK
caused by ERK activation eventually can dislodge C/EBP-b
from the promoter again and terminate transcription. The
transcriptional induction of MKPs, which deactivate ERK
by dephosphorylation, ensures that C/EBP-b activation by
ERK also ceases. This ability to regulate gene transcription
by direct DNA binding highly increases the number of
ERK targets.
This theme of competing for critical binding sites is reiterated in the context of cell cycle regulation by the ERK
pathway. ERK kinase activity is crucial for promoting cell
cycle entry by various mechanisms including the induction
of cyclin D1, stabilization of c-Myc and regulation of cell
cycle inhibitors such as p21waf/cip and p27kip[90]. A kinase
independent component was only recently discovered
[91]. Lamin A, an integral part of the nuclear matrix and
involved in the stabilization of chromatin structure and
regulation of gene expression, was shown to be a mutually
exclusive docking protein for ERK1/2 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (Figure 4D). When ERK1/2 becomes
activated and enters the nucleus, ERK1/2 dislodges Rb
from its interaction with lamin A. Rb released to the
nucleoplasm is rapidly phosphorylated and inactivated,
leading to the activation of the transcription factor E2F
and cell cycle entry. No kinase activity from either ERK1
or ERK2 was necessary for these processes [91].
p38 MAPK

The mammalian p38 subfamily of MAPKs comprises 4
members (a, b, g and δ) that are differentially expressed in
various tissues, and activated in response to a wide range
of extracellular stress stimuli, including cytokines and
growth factors [92]. Numerous data obtained from mouse
knockout studies and selective pharmacological inhibitors
implicate an important role of p38a MAPK in inflammatory and immune responses [93-95]. More recent studies
show that the mammalian p38 MAPK pathway behaves as
a cell cycle inhibitor in both G1/S and G2/M checkpoint
controls in response to stress stimuli [96,97]. Whereas the
role of p38 in cell cycle regulation was clearly established,
some of these functions may not require p38 catalytic
activity. For instance, p38a depletion, but not its specific
pharmacologic inhibition, impeded cell proliferation and
caused mitotic arrest, revealing p38a functions independent of its kinase activity [98]. Moreover, these phenotypes
were reversed by the ectopic expression of a kinase-dead
p38a mutant. Finally, overexpression of wild type or

Page 14 of 28

kinase-negative p38a also strongly inhibited cell proliferation, proving that p38a also has a key kinase-independent
function [98]. However, despite the clear absence of
requirement for p38 catalytic activity to regulate cell cycle
progression, the exact mechanism used to achieve this
function is unknown.
Mirk/Dyrk1B protein kinase is a potential candidate to
explain a kinase-independent role of p38 in cell cycle regulation (Figure 4E). Mirk functions as a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the response to certain stress
agents [99]. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both wild type and kinase-inactive p38 bind to
Mirk and prevent its association with upstream activators
and transcriptional co-factors. Interestingly, this effect is
isoform specific, as only the p38a and p38b, but not the g
or δ isoforms, bind to Mirk. In addition, the observation
that Mirk protein levels were variable while p38 levels
stayed constant suggested that endogenous p38 could only
block Mirk function when Mirk levels were low (S phase)
and not when Mirk levels were elevated (G 0 /G 1 ) [99].
These observations emphasized a novel cell cycle-dependent function for p38, suppressing Mirk transcriptional
activity in a kinase-independent fashion only when cells
are proliferating.
Kinase independent functions in regulating cell adhesion
and migration Src

Src belongs to a family of eight non-receptor tyrosine
kinases and is implicated in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways. Src proteins regulate many fundamental
cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, cell
shape, migration and apoptosis [100-102]. These pleiotropic functions of the Src family explain the importance of
these kinases within the signalling machinery, and it comes
as no surprise that most members of this family have been
identified as oncogenes [103]. Src proteins feature a modular structure of three domains, the N-terminal SH3
domain, the central SH2 domain and a tyrosine kinase
domain. The SH2 and SH3 domains cooperate in regulating the auto-inhibition of the kinase domain. Additionally,
an inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation in the C-terminus
acts a binding site for the SH2 domain, which locks the
protein in a closed conformation, and further facilitates
binding of the SH3 domain to a linker region between the
SH2 and kinase domain. This architecture allows for multiple mechanisms for c-Src activation, either by dephosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine by protein tyrosine
phosphatases or competitive binding to the SH2 and SH3
domains by other proteins. The list of Src family kinase
substrates is long [104,105], but here we briefly discuss targets of Src, which are regulated in kinase independent way.
Activation of integrin signalling is associated with a
transient increase in Src kinase activity and translocation
of Src to the focal adhesion complex and subsequent

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
[106-108]. Src-deficient fibroblasts were shown to have
defects in cell spreading which is presumably related to
the activation of Src by integrins. Complementation of
this phenotype does not require kinase activity of Src, as
cell spreading is restored by either wild type or kinasedefective Src [109]. In a similar fashion, activation of the
Src-dependent adaptor protein pp130CAS in fibroblasts in
response to fibronectin binding does not require Src
kinase activity [110]. Overexpression of Src in human
colon cancer cells induces FAK phosphorylation on
several tyrosine residues. Surprisingly, only one phosphorylation site requires the catalytic activity of Src,
whereas phosphorylation on four other sites requires the
intact SH2 domain of Src but not its catalytic activity
[111]. Ablation of both Src alleles in the mouse causes
osteopetrosis due to an intrinsic defect in osteoclasts
[112]. Surprisingly, re-expression of kinase-defective version of c-Src led to a reduction in osteopetrosis in Src-/animals and partially rescued a defect in cytoskeletal
organization observed in Src-/- osteoclasts. These results
suggest that no kinase activity is required for this
phenotype.
These results suggest important kinase independent
functions of Src in integrin signalling and cytoskeletal
organization. This is not surprising given that they
strongly rely on spatial organization, which may be better
suited to be negotiated by protein interactions rather that
catalytic activities.
However, while cytoskeletal organization is the prime
paradigm for kinase independent Src family functions,
there is also evidence for kinase independent signalling in
other roles. These examples include the organisation of
multiprotein signalling complexes in signalling by cytokines [113], the T-cell receptor [114], and the B-cell receptor [115]. The evidence is sparse but consistent, suggesting
that we are far from having fathomed the kinase independent functions of Src family kinases.
Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)

FAK is a tyrosine kinase mediating integrin signalling and
also participating in signal transduction by growth factor
receptors [116,117]. FAK contains an N-terminal FERM
(band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology), a kinase and
a C-terminal FAT (focal adhesion targeting) domain. The
FAT domain links FAK to integrins and focal adhesions,
whereas the FERM domain connects FAK to membrane
growth factor receptors and is also responsible for nuclear
translocation. Early reports suggested that FAK could play
a scaffolding role mediating crosstalk between signalling
pathways. Indeed, FAK has been shown to induce anchorage-dependent JNK activation in a kinase-independent
fashion by interacting with paxillin [118]. The exact
mechanism is not known but seems to rely on FAK promoting paxillin localization to the cell membrane and the

Page 15 of 28

recruitment of paxillin kinase linker (PKL) and PAK-Interacting exchange Factor (PIX) [119], a guanine nucleotideexchange factor (GEF) that activates Rac, which in turn
activates the JNK pathway [120,121] (Figure 5A). Interestingly, JNK phosphorylation of S178 in paxillin enhances
the binding of FAK to paxillin [122] creating a positive
feedback loop that could promote the accumulation of
paxillin at focal adhesions.
Importantly, FAK plays a crucial role in vascular development, and mice lacking FAK in their vascular system
die before birth due to defects in angiogenesis and apoptosis of endothelial cells [123]. Mice expressing a kinasedeficient FAK mutant selectively in endothelial cells still
died before birth, but the embryos survived longer than
animals without any FAK in their vascular system [124].
Expression of kinase-dead FAK did not correct the vessel
malformation, but enhanced endothelial cell survival by a
mechanism involving the downregulation of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21waf/cip[124]. p21waf/cip was
one of the first p53 target genes identified [125]. FAK inactivation during mouse development results in p53- and
p21-dependent mesodermal cell growth arrest. By creating
FAK-/-p21-/- double knockout fibroblasts Lim et al. [126]
showed that FAK, in a kinase-independent fashion, causes
p53 instability via enhanced Mdm2-dependent p53 ubiquitination (Figure 5B). p53 inactivation required the FAK
FERM domain for nuclear localization, p53 binding and
connections to Mdm2, the p53 specific ubiquitin ligase
responsible of p53 degradation. These observations
defined a scaffolding role for nuclear FAK in facilitating
cell survival through enhanced p53 degradation [126].
Pyk2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase related to FAK and
sharing similar domain structure. Interestingly, compensatory Pyk2 expression was observed in FAK-/- mice [127],
suggesting some redundancy between FAK and Pyk2 functions. Indeed, FAK knockdown induced p53 activation and
cell cycle arrest in endothelial cells, but a subsequent
increase in Pyk2 expression led to p53 downregulation
and the release of cell cycle block [128]. Moreover, in
FAK-/-p21-/- double knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts,
an increase of p53 levels associated with inhibition of cell
proliferation was observed only when Pyk2 was downregulated [128]. Thus, similar as FAK, Pyk2 promotes Mdm2dependent p53 ubiquitination to facilitate cell proliferation
and survival in a kinase-independent manner (Figure 5B).
PAK

p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is a serine/threonine
kinase belonging to the highly homologous group I of
PAKs (PAKs 1-3). PAK1-3 activation is mediated by Rho
family small G proteins, including Rac and Cdc42, which
bind PAKs and induce its conformational change leading
to exposure and activation of the catalytic domain [129].
PAKs are associated with a wide variety is cellular functions, including regulation of the MAPK pathway,

Figure 5 Non-catalytic functions of FAK and PAK kinases in cell motility and survival. (A) FAK mediated translocation of paxillin to the cell

cytoskeletal regulation and motility, differentiation, carcinogenesis and tumor invasion [129-131]. Several early
studies demonstrated that PAKs have some kinase-independent functions including cytoskeletal regulation and
differentiation [132-134]. On the molecular level, PAK
was demonstrated to coordinate the formation of a
multi-protein complex, which contains PAK, PIX, PKL
and Paxillin in focal adhesions (Figure 5C). This activity
required the conformational change of PAK, since activated Rac or Cdc42 were able to promote this effect
[135]. As described above, the scaffolding function of
FAK seems instrumental for recruiting paxillin and activating Rac via PKL and PIX (Figure 5B). Active Rac binds
PAK, which is not only a Rac effector but also interacts
with PIX, which in turn stimulates Rac. Thus, multiple
protein interactions coupled to positive feedback loops
that promote protein recruitment may by key to focal
adhesion formation and function by forming a temporally
dynamic yet physically stable platform.

While these studies referred to a scaffolding function of
the PAK N-terminal regulatory domain, later studies
pointed out new, kinase-independent functions of the Cterminal PAK kinase domain [136,137]. A dual, kinasedependent and -independent role of PAK1 was demonstrated in myeloid cell migration. Chemokine binding to
the G Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) induces a direct
interaction between G bg and PAK1. This interaction
leads to activation of PIX and activation of Cdc42, which
in turn leads to activation of PAK, an event required for
the directional sensing of neutrophils [137]. The conformational change of PAK1 induced by the G bg binding
can prevent formation of PIX dimers, and therefore facilitate its GEF activity towards Cdc42 [137,138]. In this system, PAK1 mediates activation of its own catalytic
activity, thus forming a positive feedback loop [137] (Figure 5D). In general, PAK1’s ability to function as a scaffold for the GEFs that activates the GTPases, which
activate PAK1, seems to generate an organising principle

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

that enables cells to coordinate complex spatiotemporal
responses. Similarly, PAK2 was recently described as regulating Cdc42-induced actin reorganization and spindle
orientation by directly binding to the b-PIX GEF [139].
Another important PAK target is Akt, which has a central role in the regulation of metabolism, apoptosis, cell
migration and transformation [140]. Whereas some studies suggest that PAK might directly phosphorylate Akt at
the activating site S473 [141,142], a recent study demonstrates that PAK can also facilitate Akt phosphorylation in
a kinase-independent manner [136] (Figure 5E). The
kinase domain of PAK1 directly interacts with Akt and
mediates its translocation to the plasma membrane, where
S473 can be phosphorylated by mTORC2 [143] or PAK
itself [141,142]. This step requires an activating conformational change of PAK induced by Rac binding, but no PAK
kinase activity per se. PAK1 also recruits PDK1, the Akt
T308 kinase [144], and this interaction is greatly facilitated
by growth factors [136]. Thus, PAK1 promotes Akt translocation to the plasma membrane and serves as a scaffold
that facilitates the interaction of PDK1 with Akt. Interestingly, PAK1mediated Akt activation exhibits isoform selectivity, affecting Akt1 responses more than Akt2, and in
addition biased Akt substrate selection [136]. Expression
of the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK1, which
seems to interfere with the ability of PAK to recruit PDK1,
preferentially reduced the phosphorylation of nuclear Akt
substrates, such as FoxO3a, while the phosphorylation
levels of the cytosolic substrates S6K, BAD and GSK3
remained intact. This suggests that PAK scaffolding might
direct the substrate specificity of Akt or limit its accessibility towards a subset of its substrates or both. It remains
unclear, however, how the PAK dependent PDK1-Akt
complex, which is formed at the cell membrane, affects
nuclear Akt substrates. On the other hand, both Akt and
PDK1 participate in PAK1 regulation. Akt can phosphorylate and partially activate PAK1 [145], and PDK1 was
shown to activate PAK1 by direct phosphorylation in the
activation loop [146]. Thus, kinases seem to be able to
mutually activate each other in the PAK1 scaffolded
PDK1-Akt complex by positive feedback loops, which is
likely to result in a switchlike, digital signal output [147].
Members of the constitutively active group II PAK
family (PAKs 4-6) also have been shown to mediate part
of their effects via kinase-independent functions. PAK4
protects cells from apoptosis induced by death receptors
in a kinase-independent manner by interfering with the
recruitment and activation of caspase 8 to the death
domains in the receptors [148]. In addition, PAK4 is
needed for the efficient activation of survival pathways in
response to TNFa by facilitating the binding of the scaffold protein TRADD to the activated TNFa receptor
partly through a kinase-independent mechanism [149].
The role for PAK4 in regulating prosurvival pathways in a

Page 17 of 28

kinase-independent manner is a new function for this protein, and may help explaining its role in tumorigenesis
[150,151] and development [152].
Kinase independent regulation of phosphoinositide
signaling pathways
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)

PI3Ks are intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the
3’-hydroxyl group of phosphatidylinositol and phosphoinositides [153]. Their action is counteracted by the Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) phosphatase, which
is frequently altered in cancer [154,155]. PI3Ks are divided
into three classes according to their substrates specificity
and sequence homology. Class I PI3Ks are activated by
surface receptors and preferentially generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) [153]. Class I PI3Ks are
heterodimers consisting of a catalytic and a regulatory
subunit. Catalytic domains p110a, p110b or p110δ form
together with p85, p55 or p50 regulatory domains class IA
PI3Ks. Class IB PI3K consists of the catalytic p110g and
regulatory p101 or p84/p87 subunit [153,156]. Despite the
fact that all class I PI3Ks generate PIP3, their simultaneous
expression suggests that some of their functions might be
not redundant. Indeed, a comprehensive study done by
Knight and colleagues revealed specific functions of class
PI3Ks in insulin signalling [157]. For instance, p110b is
important for maintaining the PIP3 pool in unstimulated
myotubes and balancing PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, activity thus setting a threshold for Akt activation. It is also
required for Akt activation in a response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulation [158-160]. However, p110b is
dispensable for Akt activation induced by insulin, since
p110a is the major PIP2 kinase in this signalling pathway
[157]. Surprisingly, in some cases the phenotype observed
after catalytic subunit knockdown was much more severe
than the phenotype induced by saturating concentrations
of an isoform-specific chemical inhibitor [161,162]. This
suggests the possibility that catalytic subunits of PI3 kinase
might fulfil other, kinase independent functions in cellular
regulation. These, kinase-independent functions of PI3Ks
were elegantly validated by obtaining knock-in homozygote mice bearing kinase dead mutants of PI3 kinase.
Importantly, the phenotype of these knock-in mice was
markedly different and less severe than the corresponding
knockout phenotypes [163]. Here, we discuss some specific examples of non-catalytic PI3 kinase functions.
p110b p110b can be activated by growth factors and
insulin. Several recent studies identified both kinasedependent and independent roles for this isoform
[157-159]. p110b is dispensable for Akt phosphorylation
induced by insulin, IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor),
Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) or Platelet-derived
Growth Factor (PDGF) stimulation [158]. However, the

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

catalytic activity of p110b is required for Akt activation
mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) [158,159], and a
lack of catalytically active p110b protected mice from
breast cancer development induced by ERBB2 or from
prostate tumour development driven by loss of PTEN
[158,159]. The latter phenomenon can be attributed to a
basal catalytic activity of p110b and its balancing effect
towards PTEN activity [157]. On the other hand, kinaseindependent functions of p110b are crucial for several
physiological processes, including embryonic development. Mice homozygotic for kinase-dead p110b develop
normally and survive to adulthood, except growth retardation and developing a mild insulin resistance with age
[158], whereas the p110b knockout leads to embryonic
lethality in mice [164]. Further, catalytically inactive
p110b facilitates endocytosis in a rate similar to the wild
type p110b subunit, as indicated by transferrin and EGFR
uptake [158,159].p110b, unlike p110a, can be found in
the nucleus [165], and recent studies revealed kinasedependent and independent functions of p110b in DNA
replication and repair [161,162]. In response to DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) PI3Kb participates in sensing the damage by mediating the binding of the DNA
damage sensor protein Nbs1to DSBs and the recruitment
of the full MRN (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1) complex, which
then activates the DNA damage kinase ATM. The assembly of this complex does not require PI3Kb catalytic activity, although kinase competent PI3Kb is more efficient
[161]. ATM then recruits the replication protein A (RPA)
complex and the ATR kinase. ATR and ATM are checkpoint kinases which halt the cell cycle until the DNA
damage is repaired by the Rad51 recombinase (Figure 6A).
The defective DNA repair in p110b knockout cells leads
to genomic instability and chromosomal aberrations.

Page 18 of 28

However, cells expressing kinase-dead p110b were predominantly normal, clearly demonstrating that kinase-independent functions of p110b are sufficient to upkeep
radiation-induced DNA repair [161].
In DNA replication the catalytic activity of p110b is
required for the efficient progress of the replication fork
[162]. p110b regulate PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen) binding to the DNA and p21waf/cip phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the downregulation of p110b by shRNA
revealed also kinase-independent function of p110b.
p110b contributes to nuclear localization of Akt independently of its catalytic activity. In addition, the ability of
p110b to bind PCNA and to facilitate its chromatin loading is at least partially independent of the p110b catalytic
activity [162]. This study provides us with a molecular
mechanism of p110b’s kinase-independent role in cell
cycle previously demonstrated by BrdU incorporation
assay [159].
p110g Unlike the ubiquitously expressed p110a and
p110b subunits, p110g expression is limited to certain
tissues, including the hematopoietic system, endothelial
cells, and cardiomyocytes [166,167].
Ischemia-induced angiogenesis is dependent on the
PI3Kg subunit. However, mice expressing a kinase-dead
p110g mutant entertain a normal reparative neovascularization, as indicated by capillary density and blood flow
recovery. In detail, p110g has a kinase-independent function in endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) migration
induced by the chemokine Stromal-cell Derived Factor 1
(SDF-1), while EPC incorporation into vascular networks
requires the catalytic activity of p110g [168].
Another study described the protective role of PI3Kg in
myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (M I/R) injury. PI3Kg
knockout mice had massive immediate and long-term

Figure 6 PI3K signaling independent of catalytic activity. (A) PI3Kb binding to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) recruits DNA damage
sensor and DNA repair enzymes. (B) PI3Kg comprising of the p110g and p87, catalytic and regulatory subunits, serves as scaffold for a Protein
Kinase A (PKA) and phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) containing protein complex that regulates b-adrenergic receptor internalization and muscle
contractility in cardiomyocytes.

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23

heart damage induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.
The cardioprotective role of p110g did not require its
kinase activity, since catalytically inactive p110g knock-in
mice had phenotypes similar to their wild-type littermates
[169].
Of interest, PI3Kg knockout cardiomyocytes showed a
higher contractility, and PI3Kg was shown to act as a negative regulator of contractility [170]. In cardiac hypertrophy
models using chronic pressure overload caused by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) [171,172] PI3Kg activity
and expression levels were upregulated in the heart
[173,174]. PI3Kg knockout mice develop severe myocardial
damage in response to TAC surgery suggesting that PI3Kg
has a protective role. Mice expressing kinase-dead PI3Kg
had preserved myocardial function a week after TAC,
despite the lack of Akt and Erk activation in a response to
TAC-induced mechanical stress. This can be explained by
an ability of PI3Kg to form a complex with phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) independently of its kinase activity.
PDE3B is associated with PI3Kg in a constitutive manner
and this interaction is required for PDE3B phosphodiesterase catalytic activity [174]. Furthermore, the PI3K regulatory subunit, p87 but not p101 undergoes a physical
interaction with PDE3B [175]. Thereby, PI3Kg helps to
maintain cAMP levels and thus prevents tissue necrosis
independently of its kinase activity [174].
A subsequent study revealed the molecular mechanism
of how cAMP levels in cardiomyocytes are regulated by
PI3K independently of the PIP3 levels [176] (Figure 6B).
While the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p87, directly binds
phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), the catalytic subunit,
p110g, binds Protein Kinase A (PKA). cAMP, regenerated
in cardiomyocytes upon Β-adrenergic receptor stimulation,
leads to activation of PKA. Catalytically active PKA phosphorylates and activates PDE3B, thus providing a negative
feedback regulation. In this system, PI3K serves as an
anchoring protein, bringing PKA in proximity to its substrate. In addition, PKA phosphorylates p110g and inhibits
its kinase activity, thus decreasing the PIP3 levels. Since
PIP3 is required for b-adrenergic receptor internalization,
PKA helps to maintain receptor levels on the plasma
membrane. In failing hearts, PI3K kinase activity is elevated, partially as a result of high expression levels of
p110g. In addition to that, the expression level of the regulatory subunit p101 is elevated as well. Since this subunit
does not interact with PKA, the p110g bound to p101
remains constitutively active leading to b-adrenergic
receptor downregulation and heart failure [176].
PDK1

Phosphoinositide-Dependent Kinase 1 (PDK1) is a major
regulator of at least 23 AGC kinases. Surprisingly, PDK1
is constitutively active and cell stimulation does not
change its phosphorylation status at the activation loop
or the kinase activity [177,178]. PDK1 mediates its own

Page 19 of 28

phosphorylation, thus explaining why the protein
expressed in bacteria is phosphorylated and fully active;
most likely this phosphorylation proceeds by a transmolecular mechanism [178]. In the PI3K signalling pathway PDK1 participates in Akt activation. Upon PIP3
accumulation mediated by PI3Ks Akt is recruited to the
plasma membrane via its PH domain binding to PIP3 or
by association with PAK1 as discussed above. PDK1then
phosphorylates Akt at the activation loop (T308)
[177,178]. PDK1 itself contains a PH domain, however it
remains controversial whether cell stimulation affects its
localization within the cell [179,180].
Recent studies suggested that PDK1 has additional,
kinase-independent functions in the coordination of signalling pathways [181,182]. For instance, PDK1 is involved
in activating the small G protein Ral [182]. Ral is a small
GTPase whose activation is mediated by a Ral specific
GEF, Ral-GDS (Ral-Guanine nucleotide Dissociation Stimulator) [183]. Besides Raf kinases and PI3K, Ral-GDS is
one of the three classic Ras effectors [184,185]. Ras contributes to Ral activation by bringing the Ral-GDS proximate
to its substrate, but is not sufficient for the full catalytic
activation of Ral-GDS [186]. Therefore, an additional step
is required for optimal Ral activation, and PDK1
was demonstrated to fulfil this complementary role [182]
(Figure 7A). PDK1 binds the N-terminal region of RalGDS and relieves it from inhibition. This N-terminal part
of Ral-GDS was shown to possess autoinhibitory activity
and Ral-GDS lacking this region has higher basal GEF
activity. This function of PDK1 is kinase-independent,
since a kinase-dead PDK1 mutant performed indistinguishably from wild type PDK1. Moreover, PDK1 lacking
50 amino acids in its regulatory domain did not enhance
Ral-GDS activity, but was able to phosphorylate Akt at
T308. These results demonstrate a clear distinction
between kinase-dependent and -independent functions of
PDK1 in response to growth factor stimulation [182].
Another example of PDK1 acting as a scaffolding protein
was described in T-cells, where PDK1 takes part in NFB
activation upon T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. PDK1
phosphorylates and recruits PKCθ to the plasma membrane and also recruits the CARMA1- Bcl10 -MALT1
complex, bringing it proximal to the PKCθ-bound IB
kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of two kinases IKKa/
b and a scaffolding protein IKKg or NEMO. The MALT1
complex ubiquitinates NEMO leading to the activation of
IKKa/b and phosphorylation of IB. Phosphorylation targets IB for degradation thereby releasing NFB to the
nucleus where it activates the expression of survival and
proliferation genes. Thus, PDK1, in addition of being the
PKCθ kinase, also serves as a nucleating factor that assembles a multi-protein complex mediating NFB activation
downstream of TCR [181]. This multi-protein complex
might also facilitate the PKCθ-mediated phosphorylation of

Figure 7 Catalytic-independent functions of PDK1. (A) PDK1 induces activation of the Ral small G protein by binding to and relieving its GEF,
Ral-GDS from the autoinhibitory conformation. (B) PDK1 mediates NFB activation in T-cells by serving as a scaffold that brings CARMA1-BCL10MALT1complex proximal to the PKCq-bound IKK complex, thus allowing ubiquitination of NEMO (IKKg). This leads to activation of IKKs,
phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the NFB inhibitor IB and release of active NFB into the nucleus.

CARMA-1, which enhances the recruitment of BCL10MALT1. This event is absolutely required for TCRinduced NFB activation [187]. Therefore, PDK1 fulfils a
dual role operating both as a kinase and as a scaffolding
protein that promotes formation of a multi-protein complex required for NFB activation in T cells.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)

mTOR kinase is found in two distinct multi-protein complexes with different substrate specificity, mTOR complex
1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, that contain Raptor or Rictor
as function defining elements, respectively. mTORC1 activation is mediated by Akt downstream to PI3K, whereas
rather little is known about mTORC2 regulation [188].
The ability of mTORC1 to phosphorylate its downstream
targets can be negatively regulated by rapamycin. It is
unclear whether rapamycin affects mTOR kinase activity
or prevents mTORC1 from interacting with its substrates,
since rapamycin-bound mTOR complex 1 can still phosphorylate some of its substrates or autophosphorylate
under certain conditions [189-191]. Therefore, the ability
of rapamycin to block a particular signaling event does not
indicate that this event necessarily requires the catalytic
activity of mTORC1.
Rapamycin prevented the differentiation of C2C12
mouse myoblast cells into skeletal muscle cells. This
inhibition could be rescued by a rapamycin-resistant
mTOR mutant [192]. Surprisingly, mTOR bearing an
additional mutation that abolishes its kinase activity
could also mediate cell differentiation. Of note, during
cell differentiation the mTOR expression levels are
upregulated on a posttranscriptional level, but no upregulation of mTOR kinase activity could be observed
[192]. Another study performed in C2C12 cells demonstrated that mTOR mediated muscle cell differentiation

did require its kinase activity [193]. The reason for this
discrepancy is unclear.
However, subsequent studies, performed both in in vivo
and in in vitro models, support the kinase independent
function of mTOR in muscle cell differentiation and maintenance, and provide a molecular explanation. miRNA125b expressed in skeletal muscle cells negatively regulates
muscle differentiation and injury-induced muscle regeneration by downregulating IGF-II, which is required for
this process. mTOR negatively regulates miRNA-125b
expression in repairing tissue, and that this mTOR function does not require its catalytic activity [194]. The conditional knockout of mTOR in muscle cells led to severe
myopathy and premature death in mice. Among other
changes induced by the mTOR knockout, cells lacking
mTOR, but not raptor or rictor, had decreased expression
levels of dystrophin. Dystrophin expression in muscle cells
is regulated by mTOR on the transcriptional level independently of its kinase activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicated that mTOR binds
to the dystrophin promoter [195]. Thus, this study indicates a kinase independent, but also raptor and rictor
independent functions of mTOR in transcriptional regulation [195].
Pseudokinases

Interestingly, 48 out of the reported 518 kinases in the
human genome seem to have lost their kinase activity altogether due to mutations of critical amino acids in their
kinase domains thought to be required for catalytic functions. These so-called pseudokinases still have important
catalysis-independent functions, e.g. as scaffolding proteins
[59,196]. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss
the function of pseudokinases in detail, and we refer

Rauch et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:23
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/23

readers to recent reviews dedicated to this topic
[46,196,197]. Within this review we only briefly discuss
recent results indicating that the distinction between
kinases and pseudokinases may be blurred. Pseudokinases
seem to have developed from standard kinases by mutation of a few key catalytic residues while preserving the
general primary and tertiary sequence organisation of the
classic well-conserved kinase domains. Thus, the substrate
binding properties of the kinase domains have evolved to
become their main functions. This transition, however,
seems to be gradual, and there is an increasing number of
examples where pseudokinases can acquire kinase activity
under certain conditions.
In the case of the Wnk kinase family, the general structural conservation of the kinase domain allows for a
slightly modified catalytic mechanism despite lacking key
catalytic residues characteristic for classic kinase domains
[198-200]. Another example of a pseudokinase that uses
an unconventional catalytic mechanism is the EGF receptor family member ErbB3/HER3. The traditional view was
that ErbB3 lacks kinase activity but is phosphorylated and
transactivated via dimerization with the active kinase
ErbB2/HER2 [201,202]. Recent structural and molecular
dynamics based modelling studies showed that the ErbB3
pseudokinase domain uses an alternative phosphotransfer
mechanism to transautophosphorylate its intracellular
region [203]. These recent results might suggest, that
pseudokinases might be more active than anticipated by
using alternative catalytic mechanisms.
Interestingly, in some cases these unorthodox catalytic
activities may rely on very specific allosteric activation
mechanisms exerted by the substrates and associated
modulator proteins. A recent example is the scaffold
KSR2, member of the extended Raf family and well known
for its role in coordinating Raf-MEK-ERK complexes
[59,204], was shown to possess catalytic activity towards
MEK [205]. This activity was dependent on Raf-1 binding
to KSR2 and due to an allosteric activation mechanism.
The KSR2 targeted phosphorylation sites in MEK were different from the known regulatory sites suggesting that the
combination of a scaffold with the allosteric activation of a
pseudokinase domain may confer exquisite substrate specificity. On the other hand, the observed KSR2 mediated
MEK phosphorylation was of very low stoichiometry and
its physiological relevance remains to be tested.
Technical notes

Most kinases mentioned in this review were first identified
as enzymes, and only later additional functional functions
were identified. Whereas the catalytic activity of a kinase is
relatively easy to test, assaying for kinase-independent functions is more far more difficult. It still is challenging
to determine kinase-interacting partners, and more

Page 21 of 28

importantly whether these protein-protein interactions
contribute to the regulation of signalling independently of
catalytic activity. In many studies kinase mutants lacking a
kinase domain or bearing kinase-inactivating mutations
were overexpressed, and the phenotype obtained was attributed to a non-catalytic activity of the protein. These studies
contributed much to our current understanding of kinase
activities in different systems. However, the massive overexpression of a mutated protein will change the stoichiometric ratios between interacting proteins and hence may
not accurately reflect physiological phenomena. Novel technologies, such as small interfering RNA or knockin mice,
allow creating a clean temporary or permanent background
where the contribution of any particular kinase can be
assessed without overexpression. In this case, the rescue of
a phenotype with a kinase-dead kinase can serve as a much
more reliable indication of non-catalytic kinase activities.

Conclusions
One of the clear functions of kinases within signalling networks is to receive signals from an upstream regulator and
to amplify it by phosphorylating multiple substrate molecules. Any function independent of catalytic activity will
be governed by purely stoichiometric relationships and
will be lacking the amplification potential. However, while
losing the advantage of signal amplification this mechanism might offer other advantages. Therefore, it is legitimate to ask: Why do protein kinases have non-catalytic
functions? There are likely many more phosphorylation
sites than proteins [206,207] not only raising questions
about the functional roles of these phosphorylations, but
also about the specificity of protein kinases. In fact, the
specificity of protein kinases seems so poor that the
expansion of tyrosine kinases went hand in hand with a
reduction of the number of tyrosines in proteins [208].
Thus, is it the quest for specificity rather than catalytic
efficiency that rules the kinase world? The first call on specificity is the kinase domain itself and the range of substrates it can interact with. The protein kinases that
essentially consist of a kinase domain only, such as
MAPKs, usually feature a large number of substrates and a
large number of scaffolding proteins that direct them to
selected substrates. In addition, their substrates have
developed dedicated docking domains [82]. In contrast,
large kinases with a complex domain structure, such as
the PI3Ks are often remarkably specific, and usually function as scaffolds themselves. A crucial finding was the existence of SH2 and SH3 interaction domains by Tony
Pawson’s group. Many kinases described above contain
multiple such protein-protein interaction domains, which
are crucial for both, catalytic and non-catalytic, functions
enabling them to act as scaffolds in addition to their catalytic role [209,210].

A variation on this theme is the competition for protein
interactions, which can regulate the dynamic turnover of
protein complexes. Although an oversimplification, this
observation indicates that specificity is mainly achieved
by regulating protein interactions that determine the
binding of activators and substrates, subcellular localisation and dynamic changes of these conditions. In fact,
manipulating protein docking interactions can override
the intrinsic catalytic specificity of kinases [211]. Therefore, non-catalytic functions may be paramount to ensure
the catalytic specificity of protein kinases. Many of the
examples discussed above support this view. Often the
cooperation between catalytic and non-catalytic kinase
functions is needed to cause the full and correct biological effects. This design also affords maximum versatility
by embedding protein kinases into different protein complexes in order to generate different signalling specificities. Pseudokinases may represent the extreme end of
this scale. They lack catalytic activity altogether or only
exhibit it under highly confined conditions depending on
allosteric activation by binding partners [197].
These mechanisms contribute to the specificity of protein
kinase action by providing mechanisms of a priori substrate
discrimination. However, another and complementary way
to achieve specificity is to increase the signal to noise ratio
of protein kinase signalling. Again, non-catalytic functions
seem to be key. An example is provided by the observation
that tyrosine kinases often use SH2 domains, which dock to
phospho-tyrosines, to recognise substrates previously phosphorylated by themselves or other tyrosine kinases [212].
Many of the signalling complexes discussed above are
assembled via non-catalytic kinase functions, but involve
multiple positive feedback loops exerted by phosphorylation. The combination of non-catalytic protein complex
assembly and catalytic reinforcement of connections or
outputs generate a high fidelity filter [147] that can program reliable biological responses.
