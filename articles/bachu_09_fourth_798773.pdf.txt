Subtype-C strains of HIV-1, among the various viral subtypes, are responsible for ~50% of the global and 85-99%
of Indian infections. Among others, the most significant
molecular feature differentially conserved in the subtypeC promoter is the polymorphism within the enhancer
region constituted by NF-κB sites. While the viral promoter of majority of the subtypes contains two NF-κB
sites, subtype-C promoter consists of three canonical
motifs. Notably, a minority of clade-C primary isolates
contain κB or κB-like sites, in addition to the canonical κB
sites. Previous studies from our laboratory identified
nearly 6% (34/609) of the primary isolates from India to
demonstrate κB-site polymorphism in C-LTR. The functional importance of additional κB or κB-like sites in CLTR has not been evaluated. We confirmed the subtype
nature of the viral isolates by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of LTR, Tat and Env in 20 of 34 samples
demonstrating κB-site polymorphism. Sequence analysis
of the additional κB- or κB-like sites identified extensive
variation among the viral isolates. Among them, a particular sequence variation, constituting the κB-like site
GGGACTTTCT, with a C-T variation at position 10, was
found to be the most common. The functional importance of the κB-like site in C-LTR has been evaluated by
reporter gene expression from isogenic LTR promoters
and EMSA. We compared gene expression pattern of LTR
constructs in Jurkat cells under different conditions of cell
activation including TNF-α, PMA, PHA and combinations
that activate NF-κB pathway. The data demonstrate the

strongest reporter gene expression from the LTRs containing the additional κB-like sites especially under synergistic
activation conditions. Gel shift experiments with TNF-α
activated Jurkat cell nuclear extracts showed the recruitment of p50/p65 heterodimer to the variant κB-like site.
Our data for the first time provide experimental evidence
that the κB-like site in C-LTR is an authentic κB-site and
this site confers quantitative and qualitative gain of function. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this gain of function may augment viral fitness and hence contribute to
global predominance of subtype-C infections.
