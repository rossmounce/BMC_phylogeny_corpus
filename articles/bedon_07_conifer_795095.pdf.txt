Abstract
Background: Several members of the R2R3-MYB family of transcription factors act as regulators
of lignin and phenylpropanoid metabolism during wood formation in angiosperm and gymnosperm
plants. The angiosperm Arabidopsis has over one hundred R2R3-MYBs genes; however, only a few
members of this family have been discovered in gymnosperms.
Results: We isolated and characterised full-length cDNAs encoding R2R3-MYB genes from the
gymnosperms white spruce, Picea glauca (13 sequences), and loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L. (five
sequences). Sequence similarities and phylogenetic analyses placed the spruce and pine sequences
in diverse subgroups of the large R2R3-MYB family, although several of the sequences clustered
closely together. We searched the highly variable C-terminal region of diverse plant MYBs for
conserved amino acid sequences and identified 20 motifs in the spruce MYBs, nine of which have
not previously been reported and three of which are specific to conifers. The number and length
of the introns in spruce MYB genes varied significantly, but their positions were well conserved
relative to angiosperm MYB genes. Quantitative RTPCR of MYB genes transcript abundance in root
and stem tissues revealed diverse expression patterns; three MYB genes were preferentially
expressed in secondary xylem, whereas others were preferentially expressed in phloem or were
ubiquitous. The MYB genes expressed in xylem, and three others, were up-regulated in the
compression wood of leaning trees within 76 hours of induction.
Conclusion: Our survey of 18 conifer R2R3-MYB genes clearly showed a gene family structure
similar to that of Arabidopsis. Three of the sequences are likely to play a role in lignin metabolism
and/or wood formation in gymnosperm trees, including a close homolog of the loblolly pine
PtMYB4, shown to regulate lignin biosynthesis in transgenic tobacco.

Background
Insights into the regulation of lignin biosynthesis during
vascular development of plants are being derived from

angiosperm model plants like Arabidopsis thaliana
(reviewed by [1]) and from investigations unravelling the
molecular basis of wood formation in trees like Populus

(reviewed by [2]). Members of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family have been implicated as regulators of
phenylpropanoid and lignin metabolism [1] as well as
pattern formation and differentiation of primary and secondary vascular tissues, (reviewed by [3]). The MYB proteins comprise one of the largest families of plant
transcription factors, which is represented by over one
hundred members in the model plant Arabidopsis [4]. The
biological roles of MYBs have been deduced primarily
from flowering plants (angiosperms) including snapdragon [5], maize [6], Arabidopsis [7,8] and eucalyptus [9].
By contrast, the biological roles of only a few R2R3-MYBs
has been examined in non-flowering plants (gymnosperms) and relatively little is known about of their gene
family structure [10-12]. The loblolly pine genes PtMYB1
and PtMYB4 were shown to be transcriptional activators
which have the ability to regulate lignin synthesis
enzymes [10,11]. They are expressed in xylem tissues,
bind AC elements and activate transcription in transient
assays in yeast or plant cells [10,11,13]. Overexpression of
pine MYBs resulted in ectopic lignification in tobacco [10]
and in Arabidopsis [8] The reports are strong evidence supporting a role for MYBs in the lignifying process in gymnosperm trees. Lignins play an important role in trees
because they confer rigidity and impermeability to wood
by accumulating in thickened secondary vascular tissues
[1,14], therefore its regulation is of interest for understanding the genetic basis of wood properties. However,
the number of MYB transcription factors that may participate in regulating lignification in gymnosperms, and their
potential roles remain an open question.
Gymnosperms, especially conifers of the Pinaceae familyare ecologically and economically important due to their
abundance in forests in many parts of the world (North
America, Europe, Asia) and because of their use in diverse
wood products (pulp and paper, solid wood and engineered lumber). Despite recent large-scale gene discovery
initiatives for conifer trees like pine and spruce (e.g.
[15,16]), only a few regulatory gene families have been
characterised systematically in any conifer species. In one
such study, it was recently shown that the structure of the
knox-I gene family appears to be monophyletic in the
Pinacea, whereas angiosperms have several distinct clades
(four in dicots and three in monocots) [17]. The R2R3MYB family is very large with over 120 members in
angiosperms [4] and has been divided into several subgroups [18,19]. One may predict that several MYBs are
likely to regulate lignin metabolism and other aspects of
wood formation in conifer trees; however no data have
been available from which to infer the size or the structure
of the family in gymnosperms. Therefore, a broader survey of MYB genes expressed in the vascular and other tissues of gymnosperms seems essential for developing a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/17

better understanding of their roles in gymnosperm lignin
biosynthesis and wood formation.
MYB proteins have two structural regions, an N-terminal
DNA-binding domain (DBD or MYB domain) and a Cterminal modulator region that is responsible for the regulatory activity of the protein. The MYB domain is well
conserved among plants, yeast and animals [20]. Its consensus sequence contains around 50 amino acid residues
with regularly spaced tryptophans giving rise to a helixturn-helix structure [21]. There are usually one to three
imperfect repeats of the MYB domain. Proteins with two
repeats (R2R3-MYBs) are specific to plants and yeast [22]
and are the most abundant type in plants [4]. Plant R2R3MYBs take part in many biological processes including
seed development and germination [23], the stress
response [24] and epidermal cell fate in addition to their
involvement in phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthesis
[5,8-11] and vascular organisation [3] (for a review, see
Ref. [25]).
The genetic selection and breeding activities of a few commercial conifer species are being expanded to include
genetic mapping and marker development. Candidate
gene approaches are being adopted to identify robust
genetic markers derived from genes that have a physiological role in the traits that are targeted by breeders [26]. Our
goal is to characterise several members of a gene family
proposed to play a role in controlling lignin synthesis and
wood properties in conifer trees, in order to support candidate gene approaches for marker discovery. In this
report, we characterize 13 different R2R3-MYB gene
sequences from the white spruce, Picea glauca, (designated
PgMYB) and five from loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L (designated PtMYB). The full-length coding sequences we
obtained enabled us to explore their phylogenetic relationships to other plant MYB genes and to search for
novel amino acid motifs within this large protein family.
We also compared the gene structures, i.e. number, size,
position and splice sequences of introns, to gain further
insights into their evolution. The steady-state levels of
MYB and cell wall-related gene mRNAs were examined by
Q-RTPCR in various spruce tissues and organs with an
emphasis on wood-forming tissues and compression
wood formation. We identify three MYBs that are preferentially expressed in secondary xylem and are also upregulated during the formation of compression wood.

Results
Isolation and sequence analysis of 18 R2R3-MYB genes
from spruce and pine
We isolated and sequenced 18 full-length cDNAs encoding R2R3-MYB genes from conifer trees: 13 from spruce
(PgMYB1-13) and five from pine (PtMYB2, 3, 7, 8 and 14).
Each of the full length cDNA sequences were obtained

Conserved amino acid regions were identified in angiosperm and gymnosperm C-terminal sequences by the use of MEME software (setting
described in Methods). Motifs were detected among the sequences belonging to each phylogenetic clade comprised of at least one spruce MYB
(Additional File 2). Sequences from Additional File 3 were used to identify more conifer members of the PgMYB6, 7, 9 clade. Within the consensus
sequences, upper-case letters indicate amino acids found in all members of a subgroup, lower-case letters indicate amino acids conserved in more
than 50% of the members, pairs of lower-case amino acid in brackets show the two most abundant amino acids present for 50% each and above, x
indicates that no amino acid is conserved among the sequences.

we used RACE cloning to identify flanking sequences and,

full length PCR amplification to generate a single full

aligned together with the three available full-length MYB
sequences from gymnosperms [10-12]. The DNA-binding
domains of these 21 gymnosperm sequences showed a
high level of amino acid conservation particularly in the

R3 helix-turn-helix repeat, consistent with its involvement
in DNA binding (Fig. 1). Most of the variations among the
spruce PgMYB sequences were located in the turn of each
R repeat.
The conifer sequences were consistent with the consensus
DBD sequence identified by Avila et al. [27], which was
largely based on angiosperm sequences. Only a few
amino acid residues differed from this consensus; these
were mainly in PgMYB 3, 6, 7 and 9 and PtMYB3 (black
arrows in Fig. 1). We found a motif similar to that
involved in the interaction with basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) proteins in Arabidopsis ([DE]L × 2 [RK] × 3L × 6L
× 3R; [28]) in the R3 repeat of three spruce MYBs
(PgMYB5, 10 and 13) as well as in PmMBF1 ([12]; Fig. 1).
PtMYB14 had a similar motif but with two differences: an
R instead of an L, and a gap before the last R residue. In
addition, several conifer MYBs, including those with the
bHLH motif (except PmMBF1), encoded an R × 5R × 3RR
motif similar to the calmodulin-interaction site previously described in the DBD of Arabidopsis MYB2 [29]. The
highest level of conservation with the calmodulin-binding motif was observed in PgMYB2 and PtMYB2, but most
of the conifer MYB genes shown in Figure 1 had a similar
motif.
Phylogenetic relationships and gene family structure of
conifer R2R3-MYBs
We used the Mega 2.0 method to construct a phylogenetic
tree using full length cDNA sequences (Fig. 2). The result
of our analysis is congruent with the three major groups
of R2R3-MYBs (A, B and C) defined by Romero et al. [19]
on the basis of their binding affinities to MYB recognition
elements. On this phylogenetic tree, the predicted spruce
MYB proteins sequences fell into several subgroups with
bootstrap values ranging from 96–100%, indicating the
high grouping robustness. All of the spruce and pine MYB
sequences fell into group A (PgMYB3, 6, 7 and 9, and
putative pine orthologues) or C (all the other conifer
sequences in Fig. 2) and none belonged to the B group.
The conifer sequences were assigned to 7 of the 22 subgroups previously defined based upon Arabidopsis
sequences [18]. Four of the conifer sequences (PgMYB2
and 4; PtMYB2 and 4) clustered with Arabidopsis
sequences that do not fit into a defined subgroup. Several
pairs of spruce and pine sequences clustered closely
together with short branch-lengths indicative of a high
degree of homology (Fig. 2). Indeed, pair-wise optimal
alignments with the Clustal W algorithm of the pine and
spruce pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 gave amino acid identities
from 95% to 100% for the DBD and of 79%–93% for the
complete coding sequence (Table 3), suggesting that they
are putative orthologous pairs. By comparison, PtMYB14
was less homologous to its neighbouring spruce

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/17

sequences PgMYB5, 10 and 13 (60% to 67% homologous
for the full CDS).
We also analysed the number, size and sequences of
introns in PCR-amplified genomic DNA, as a complement
to the phylogenetic analysis based on the coding
sequences. In angiosperm R2R3-MYBs the introns are
located in the Myb DBD, therefore we sequenced this specific region in genomic DNAs of the 13 spruce R2R3MYBs, isolated by PCR amplification with gene specific
primer pairs spanning each gene's coding region (Additional file 1). Most of the gDNA sequences were identical
to the cDNAs, ranging from 100% to 99.3% in amino acid
identities (data not shown), due to a few variations in the
predicted amino acid sequences. The sequences were also
verified for the lack of non-sense mutations (stop codons
or frameshifts). As observed in angiosperms, we found
spruce MYB genes with one (I), two (I, II) or no introns
(Table 2).
Similarity was found between the spruce MYBs in terms of
intron position, phases and, in some cases, between
intron sequences, but the number and length intron was
quite variable. Generally, the second intron (II) was
longer than the first (I) except in PgMYB11 where intron I
was five times longer than intron II. The spruce sequences
belonging to group A MYBs fell into two subfamilies with
distinct gene structures, i.e. with one intron (Sg21) and
one without introns (Sg22). The group C sequences all
had one or two introns, as in Arabidopsis [30]. The intron
I occurred before the GL amino acid pair in repeat 2 and
the intron II occurred after the GN amino acid pair in
repeat 3 (Fig. 1), as found in the majority of Arabidopsis
R2R3-MYB genes[30]. Only PgMYB3 had a different
intron I site, named Ib, located before the GKS amino
acids. Moreover, the phase (1 or 2) of insertion was consistent, and the end sequences (GT in 5' and AG in 3')
were conserved among the sequences we analysed (Table
2). Phylogenetically close sequences, like PgMYB5, 10 and
13, had similar 5' and 3' splice junctions for both introns
(Table 2). The intron of these three genes also showed
strong nucleotide sequence conservation, although the
first intron of PgMYB5 was much longer due to a 20nucleotide triplicated sequence (not shown).
Sequence analysis of conserved regions in the C-terminal
of P. glauca MYBs
The coding regions of the spruce PgMYB sequences ranged
widely in length, encoding between 196–526 amino acid
residues depending on the length of the C-terminal region
(Table 1). We used the predicted C-terminal coding
regions of the spruce MYB proteins to search for conserved
sequences, reasoning that such motifs might be important
for the function or post-translational regulation of MYB.
We used the MEME motif-detection software to analyse

Alignment of predicted MYB domain protein sequences from spruce and pine
Alignment of predicted MYB domain protein sequences from spruce and pine. Amino acid sequence alignments of
the 21 conifer MYB R2R3 domains were obtained with Clustal W (see Methods) and then separated into three groups based
on their homologies to the consensus R2R3-MYB DNA-binding domain (MYBR2R3-DBD, top panel), the bHLH protein-binding motif (bHLH motif, middle panel) or the Arabidopsis calmodulin-interaction motif (AtMYB2 CaMBD, bottom panel), as indicated. Black shading indicates identical amino acid residues and grey shading the similar residues that agree with the fraction
sequence of 0,4 (BoxShade 3.21) and dashes indicate gaps. The numbers on the left and right indicate the amino acid position
relative to the translation start codon. The boxes and dotted line above the sequences show the predicted helix and turn
structures in the R2 and R3 regions of the MYB domain. Stars show positions of conserved tryptophan residues and black
arrows indicate unusual amino acid residues compared to the consensus amino acid sequence of the MYB DNA-binding
domains of several plant R2R3-MYB proteins described by Avila et al. [27]. The bHLH protein-binding motif ([DE]L × 2 [RK] ×
3L × 6L × 3R) identified by Zimmerman et al. [28] and the calmodulin-interaction motif [29] are shown above the middle and
bottom panels, respectively (major amino acids in upper-case, bold). Ia or Ib and II indicate the positions of the first and second

the C-terminal region of spruce MYBs using a set of protein sequences selected for their high degree of similarity
to each of the spruce MYBs (Table 1, Additional files 2 and
3). Our approach incorporated a large diversity of
sequences; it identified a total of 20 different motifs (A-T)
in the spruce MYBs, including nine new unpublished
motifs (Table 1) and 11 that were reported previously
[18,19,30]. The probability scores for each of the motifs
identified in this study ranged from 2.39e-09 to 1.79e-18.
The lowest previously published score for such motif was
6.79e-12 (motif S in PgMYB11) [30]. We detected between

zero (in PgMYB4) and five (in PgMYB9) motifs per protein in the predicated spruce MYB sequences. The large
number of conifer sequences enabled us to detect three
amino acids regions, I, K and P, that appeared to be specific to gymnosperms (in PgMYB6, 7 and 9). Other motifs,
such as F and G, were shared between gymnosperm and
angiosperm sequences. Four of the conserved amino acid
sequences (A, F, L and Q) shared the central core residues
GIDPxTH but displayed differences in neighbouring
amino acids between the consensus sequences of subgroups 4, 8, 9 and 13 defined by Kranz et al. [18].

Coding sequences indicate the length in nucleotides from the translation start codon to the stop codon. Introns I and II represent the first and
second introns, respectively. Intron phase refers to the position in a codon where the intron is inserted: after the first nucleotide (phase 1) or after
the second nucleotide (phase 2) of a codon. Italic nucleotide pairs GT and AG represent the beginning and the end of the introns, respectively; and
underlined nucleotides are conserved splice-site sequences.

Expression of P. glauca MYB genes in tissues of young and
mature trees
We surveyed the abundance of each of the 13 PgMYB gene
transcripts by Q-RTPCR, in mature (33-year-old trees) and
young (3-year-old) green-house-grown trees to determine
their tissue distribution during normal development. Six
different organs and differentiating tissues (the young
needles; the periderm, phloem and xylem from the stems;
and the periderm with phloem, or bark, and xylem from
the roots) were collected from two different mature trees
(Fig. 3). For tissue comparisons, we calculated the number
initial MYB RNA molecules per ng of total RNA. Spruce
PgMYBs 2, 4 and 8 were expressed preferentially in differentiating xylem from stem and root. Other MYBs were
abundant in the needles along with one to two other tissues from the stem or the roots or both, Some MYB
mRNAs also appeared to have rather ubiquitous profiles
or low abundance transcripts. The RNA abundance of
lignin biosynthesis enzymes PAL, 4CL, CCoAOMT and
CAD were also determined in the same tissue samples.
The lignin enzymes RNAs all gave very similar profiles,
and they were most abundant in differentiating xylem
(only 4CL is shown; Fig. 3).

We also compared the abundance of the different MYB
transcripts in the differentiating secondary xylem and in
the elongating apical leader of young spruce trees (Fig. 4).
The cell wall-related genes PAL, 4CL, CAD, CCoAOMT and
an arabinogalactan protein (AGP) were included in this
analysis. For these within tissue comparisons, the data
were normalized against the EF1-α transcript levels.
Again, the spruce MYB transcripts 2, 4 and 8 were clearly

the most abundant among the MYBs detected in the secondary xylem, consistent with the data from the mature
trees. In the apical leader, the relative abundance of the
MYB transcripts was quite different than in the secondary
xylem, except that PgMYB4 transcripts remained very
abundant. Some MYB genes that were weakly expressed or
not detectable in secondary xylem were among the most
highly expressed in apical stem (PgMYB6, 7 and 11; Fig.
4a).
Spruce MYB genes are differentially expressed in
compression wood
We followed the expression of the 13 spruce MYB genes
and five cell-wall-related genes during the early phases of
compression wood formation, in order to explore further
the potential involvement of MYBs in wood formation
and lignin biosynthesis. Gymnosperm trees form a type of
reaction wood (known as compression wood) on the
lower side of a bent or leaning stem, or in branches. Compression wood is enriched in lignin and contains lignins
that are more condensed. Therefore compression wood
formation requires the modulation of lignin biosynthesis,
which we hypothesized to involve such gene sequences as
R2R3-MYBs. We induced the formation of compression
wood in actively growing 3-year-old spruces by maintaining at a 45° angle (relative to vertical) (Fig. 5). After 21
days of growth in this leaning position, characteristic
compression wood was well developed on the lower side
of the stems (Fig. 5a). We chose to monitor transcript
abundance over a 76-hour period immediately after
induction, and found that several transcripts accumulated
between 28 and 76 hours (Fig. 5c). The transcripts of

Percent similarity calculations were performed using pairwise optimal alignment with Bioedit software (Clustal W, matrix blosum62).

PgMYB2, 4 and 8 clearly increased in the xylem forming
compression wood compared to the opposite wood and
compared to the vertical trees (0 hour time point). The
transcripts of PgMYB9, 11 and 13 RNA were slightly
increased and the seven others did not fluctuate significantly. By contrast, no significant variation in spruce MYB
RNA abundance was observed in the opposite wood,
which is found on the upper side of the stem (opposite to
the the compression wood). Transcripts for PAL, 4CL,
CCoAOMT and CAD lignin biosynthesis enzymes as well
as the AGP also increased within the same time-frame as
the MYB transcripts (Fig. 5b). In the opposite wood, only
CCoAOMT RNA transcripts decreased. No significant variation in transcript abundance was observed for the spruce
MYB or lignin genes in the terminal shoots of the same
seedlings (data not shown).

Discussion
In this paper, we report the complete coding sequences of
18 conifer gene sequences that share the characteristic features of the R2R3-MYB gene family. Thirteen sequences
were from P. glauca (white spruce; PgMYBs) and five from
P. taeda L. (loblolly pine; PtMYBs). We characterised the
full-length cDNA sequences, as well as the spruce exonintron structure. We assigned the conifer sequences to several phylogenetic clades of the R2R3-MYB family and
identified conserved motifs within them based on predicted amino acid sequences. The steady-state mRNA levels of spruce MYBs were surveyed in several tissues to
identify those genes that are preferentially expressed in
wood-forming tissues. Furthermore, we identified
PgMYBs whose transcript levels are upregulated, along
with those of an AGP and enzymes of lignin biosynthesis,
during the induction of compression wood in young
spruce trees.

Sequence conservation and identification of amino acid
motifs in spruce R2R3-MYBs
Our data show that the DBDs of conifer MYBs are highly
conserved, whereas the C-terminal region are highly variable, as shown in prior studies of other plant MYBs. The
predicted amino acid sequences of some of the spruce
MYB DBDs contain a motif for interaction with bHLH
proteins and/or with calmodulin. We identified twenty
amino acid motifs in the variable C-terminal region, of
which nine were previously unreported. The amino acid
motifs in the DBD and in the C-terminal region are useful
to better characterise the spruce R2R3-MYB sequences
belonging to each phylogenetic clade.

The R2R3-MYBs are specific to plants and are subdivided
into three major groups according to their binding affinities [19]. The more than 120 Arabidopsis sequences were
placed into 22 subgroups based on their overall amino
acid sequences and C-terminal motifs [18]. Amino acid
motifs are conserved among members of several of the 22
phylogenetic clades or subgroups [18,30,31], including
the bHLH-interaction and calmodulin-binding motifs in
the DNA-binding domain [28,29], and the repression
domain pdLNLD/ELxiG/S in the C-terminus [7]. In our
study, the spruce group C sequences were dispersed
among seven phylogenetics clades, five of which were previously defined as distinct subgroups by Kranz et al[18].
All the spruce members of subgroup 4 harboured the
bHLH-interaction motif as well as the C-terminal motifs F
and G, except for PmMBF1 [12], which lacked the motif G
(pdLNLD/ELxiG/S) described by Kranz et al[18]. The
bHLH-interaction motif identified by Zimmermann et al.
[28] is required for MYB proteins to transactivate some of
the phenylpropanoid and anthocyanin genes through
protein-protein interactions [32]. The G motif in the Cterminus has been linked to transcriptional repression of
the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) gene by AtMYB4 [7].
Several genes in group C also encoded a conserved GIDP
sequence located after the end of the DBD, suggesting a

conserved molecular function for this motif. The DBDs of
PgMYB2, 4 and 8, which were upregulated during compression wood formation, harboured a motif similar to
the calmodulin-interaction site of AtMYB2 [29], suggesting a potential link with the calcium signalling pathway

implicated in the regulation of secondary wall formation
[33]. No conserved regions were detected in the C-terminal region of PgMYB4 and its closest homolog PtMYB4,
even though experimental evidences indicate that PtMYB4
is a regulator of lignin synthesis enzymes [10], as is the

case for the closely related EgMYB2 [9]. The presence of a
regulator motif in PgMYB4 may have escaped our analysis
because the parameters were set to detect motifs ranging
from 5–15 amino acids in length; motifs of less than five
amino acids or scattered in several small modules may
thus remain undetected.
Spruce MYBs were relatively under-represented in group
A, where they fell into subgroups 21 and 22. In our analysis, spruce group A MYBs contained six of the nine newly
identified C-terminal consensus amino acid sequences.
Three of these motifs were specific to conifers assigned to
subgroup 22: motifs I, K and P found in PgMYB6, 7 and 9.
The motifs might be involved in protein or DNA interactions; however, it remains to be seen whether they play a
role in protein structure or function.
Spruce MYB phylogeny and evolution
There are very few reports from which to estimate the
number of R2R3-MYB genes in gymnosperms or to gain
insights into the molecular evolution of this protein fam-

ily [10-12,34,35]. According to the phylogenetic relationship with other MYB genes in angiosperms and
gymnosperms, the spruce MYB sequences described here
belong to nine different MYB clades distributed between
group A and group C described by Romero et al. [19].
None of the conifer sequences identified in this study and
none of the reported gymnosperm R2R3-MYBs were
assigned to the B group [19]. We may hypothesize that
group B sequences are present only in angiosperms, however, more gene discovery work is needed to draw conclusions since only four of the 125 Arabidopsis MYB genes
belong to this group B [19,31].
Despite recent large-scale gene discovery initiatives for
conifers like pine and spruce (e.g. [15,16]), only a few regulatory gene families have been characterised in any conifer species. The R2R3-MYBs family has evolved and
expanded very rapidly through numerous gene duplications in Angiosperms [36]. Given the very distant separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms (approx. 300
million years), we were interested in assessing whether a

wood (left panels) and opposite side wood (right panels) of spruce seedlings leaning at a 45° angle from vertical. Continuous

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:17

similar gene family evolution would be present in both
taxonomic groups. In other words, is the R2R3-MYB gene
family structure similar in these two groups? In the knox-I
gene family of conifer trees, the structure and number of
genes was shown to be very different from than of
angiosperms, in a recent study investigating evolution of
the family in great detail [17]. Several of the angiosperm
clades are missing in conifers which appear to have undergone several recent gene duplications with relatively low
sequence divergence levels. Our work provides a clear
indication that the conifer MYB family structure is not all
that divergent from that of the angiosperms, in contrast to
the Knox-I report, suggesting that the basic family structure predates the gymnosperm – angiosperm split. In
maize, several subgroups of R2R3-MYB genes have
expanded within the past 50 million years [36,37]. Consistent with this, our analysis of coding sequences and
introns in spruce MYB genes also suggests more recent
gene duplications in, at least in some of the clades. For
example, PgMYB5, 10 and 13 have high levels of nucleotide sequence similarity in coding sequence as well as
introns I and II.
Further investigation is needed to discover the full complement of conifer MYB sequences. By comparison to the
angiosperms, we predict that the set of sequences
described here represents a fraction of the conifer R2R3MYB family. Identification of new sequences would complete the evolutionary picture of this conspicuous family
of regulators and help to determine its position in the evolution of plant lineages.
Potential involvement of the spruce R2R3-MYBs in the
lignification of woody tissue
The spruce and pine sequences we analysed represent
diverse subgroups of the R2R3-MYB family. Thus, we
hypothesized that they could play diverse roles in metabolism and development. The involvement of specific
R2R3-MYB gene products in lignin biosynthesis and/or
wood formation is suggested by their expression profiles
and by their sequence homology with genes from pine
([10,11]) and in other species whose functions have been
previously tested. The AC cis-regulatory elements, for
example, which are found in many promoters of phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthesis genes, play an important role in gene regulation in lignifying xylem cells, thus
linking R2R3-MYB genes with lignin biosynthesis. AC elements have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of PAL in bean [38], 4CL in parsley [39], CCR and
CAD in Eucalyptus [40,41].

We compared the abundance of the 13 different spruce
MYB mRNAs in selected tissues and organs that develop a
secondary vasculature in mature spruce, and in the primary stems and differentiating secondary xylem in young

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/17

trees. PgMYB2, 4 and 8, all of which belong to the same
phylogenetic clade, were expressed preferentially in the
secondary differentiating xylem of both juvenile plants
and mature trees. Interestingly, all three genes were also
expressed preferentially in xylem tissues isolated from
large roots. By comparison, 4CL had a very similar transcript profile in prospected tissues. The other MYB genes
had various patterns of expression including phloem-preferential and ubiquitous patterns.
We also compared the RNA levels in differentiating secondary xylem during the induction of compression wood
in spruce seedlings. Compression wood development in
conifers that are leaning or bent is characterised by the formation of thicker cell walls, increased lignin content and
the deposition of more condensed lignin polymers,
among other features [42]. The plasticity of lignin biosynthesis and cell wall architecture observed in compression
wood have been linked to the fluctuation in abundance of
several gene transcripts and proteins [43,44]. Although
the transcriptional regulators that orchestrate this plasticity are unknown, they might include MYB transcription
factors due to their implication in xylem differentiation
and in lignin biosynthesis. The three PgMYBs (2, 4 and 8)
that were preferentially expressed in xylem are likely candidates because they were also upregulated on the compression wood-forming side (downward side) of the stem
but remained relatively constant on the opposite side. The
time-course and relative magnitude of the changes in transcript levels of the PgMYBs 2, 4 and 8 were quite similar to
those seen for genes encoding lignin biosynthesis
enzymes and an AGP surveyed in the same samples. Three
other PgMYBs (9, 11 and 13) also showed an increase in
transcript abundance in secondary xylem upon induction
of compression wood. In the control trees, the mRNA for
PgMYB11 was one of the highest we examined in the apical portion of the stem but it was low in secondary xylem.
These observations might imply a role for PgMYB11 in
processes that are common to primary stem growth and
compression wood formation. The MIXTA gene from
Antirrhinum majus, which belongs to the same phylogenetic subgroup, is involved in cellular development [45]
and may provide clues to the role of PgMYB11 in conifers.
The expression profiles of a few of the spruce MYB genes
are consistent with previous reports describing the putative function of homologous genes. For example, spruce
PgMYB4 is a close homolog of PtMYB4 [10], which
induced ectopic lignification when overexpressed in transgenic tobacco. A putative role for PgMYB4 in lignification
is consistent with our data showing a higher mRNA level
in compression wood, characterised by increased lignin
deposition. The gene PgMYB8 (subgroup 13) showed
strong similarity with AtMYB61, which is expressed in
xylem tissues of Arabidopsis and was shown to play an

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:17

important role in regulating lignification [8]. AtMYB61 is
also expressed in developing seeds, where it regulates the
extrusion of seed coat-derived rhamnogalacturonan mucilage [23]. The accumulation of PgMYB8 transcripts in
compression wood is consistent with the ectopic lignification resulting from the constitutive overexpression of
AtMYB61 in Arabidopsis [8]. By contrast, AtMYB103, the
most similar Arabidopsis sequence to PgMYB2, is not
expressed in the stem but is involved in trichome and
tapetum development [46], suggesting a putative role in
xylem differentiation other than lignin biosynthesis.
The spruce sequence PgMYB1 has a close pine homolog,
PtMYB1, that has been linked to lignin biosynthesis [11],
however the spruce sequence was not expressed preferentially in secondary xylem (it was also expressed in needles,
phloem and the shoot apex) nor was it induced during
compression wood formation. It was demonstrated that
PtMYB1 is able to bind the AC-I and AC-II elements (PALBox) [11]. Recently, Gomez-Maldonaldo et al. [13]
showed that pine MYB1 and MYB4 bind to glutamine synthetase AC elements and that MYBs are linked to several
metabolic pathways by shared cis-acting elements. Based
on these observations, it appears that the MYB1 genes of
pine and spruce may regulate phenylpropanoid metabolism as well as nitrogen assimilation in various plant tissues.

Conclusion
Through a systematic survey of EST sequence data followed by full length sequencing, we characterised 18 conifer R2R3-MYB gene sequences (13 from P. glauca, white
spruce; 5 from P. taeda, loblolly pine). Three R2R3-MYBs
from spruce, namely MYB 2, 4 and 8 were shown to be
expressed preferentially in secondary xylem. We also
found that transcript levels of six PgMYB genes (including
the MYB 2, 4 and 8 genes), were upregulated in differentiating secondary xylem from young trees during the induction of compression wood along with cell-wall-related
genes. Our study highlights a small set of spruce MYB
transcription factors that could be good candidate genes
for marker development studies. Gain-of-function/lossof-function studies using transgenic plants are also
needed to delineate the roles of these different MYBs.
Such studies are expected to lead to greatly lacking
insights into the regulation of wood formation in conifers.

Methods
Plant material and RNA isolation
Several tissues were isolated from two 33-year-old P.
glauca trees felled in July 2003, from a progeny trial established near Quebec City (Canada). All tissues were frozen
in liquid nitrogen immediately upon removal from the
tree and stored at -80°C until further use. We collected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/17

newly formed needles from the upper crown. Differentiating secondary xylem and phloem, as well as bark tissues
were collected from three 30–40 cm bolts taken from the
lower third of the main stem. These vascular tissues were
scraped with a scalpel immediately after peeling the bark.
Tissues scrapped from the exposed inner side of the bark
and from surface of the exposed wood were labelled as
differentiating secondary phloem and xylem, respectively.
Similarly, differentiating xylem and bark (including
phloem) were collected from large roots located in a onemeter radius from the base of the stem. Samples from
each tree and each tissue were kept separate for RNA
extraction and gene expression studies.
A gravitropic treatment to induce compression wood formation was performed on 3-year-old spruce seedling
stock. The seedlings were transferred to 3 L pots one
month before the experiment, grown in a greenhouse
with 16 hours light per day, and fertilised weekly with 20
g/L N-P-K. A randomised design of 24 young trees was
established in which 12 trees were maintained at 45°
angle by leaning the pots and tying the plants to stakes
(also at 45°); 12 seedlings were grown in the normal vertical position. Destructive tissue samplings were carried
out 4, 28 and 76 hours after the beginning of the treatment. The average diameter of the plants near the base
was 7.2 +/- 0.61 mm, their average height was 60.63 +/7.25 cm, and the terminal leader was 19.83 +/- 2.91 cm.
For each time point, four vertical and four leaning trees
were harvested mid-morning in a randomised order, and
three randomly selected trees were used for gene expression analyses. Secondary xylem was collected as described
above from the two sides of the main stem of the seedlings; the lower and upper sides representing compression
wood and opposite side wood, respectively, for the leaning trees, or left and right side for vertical tree. The whole
terminal leader was also collected from each plant. Total
RNAs were isolated from tissues described above and
ground in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar, except
for the gravitropic treatment where a Mixer Mill MM300
engine (Retsch) was used to grind in Microtubes (Eppendorf). The RNAs were extracted from each tissue sample
and each tree or seedling separately, following the procedure of Chang et al. [47], in Oakridge tubes or in Microtubes. RNA concentration and quality were determined
with a bioAnalyser (model 2100, Agilent Technologies;
RNA 6000 Nano Assay kit).
DNA cloning and accession numbers
Previous reports described two complete coding
sequences of R2R3-MYB genes from pine (PtMYB1 and
PtMYB4) [10,11] and one from spruce [12] as well as several partial sequences [35] expressed in xylem tissues of
pine. We isolated partial spruce cDNA clones representing
putative orthologues of the pine MYB genes by PCR

amplification, and identified several partial and putative
full-length sequences among the spruce EST sequences
data of the ARBOREA project derived from 17 different
cDNA libraries[48] For each of the partial spruce and pine
gene sequences, we obtained complete coding sequence
and UTRs by using 3' RACE, 5' RACE or both cloning
methods on spruce or pine mRNA from needles or xylem
(SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). DNA was cloned in pCR2.1 with the TA
cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced.
The sequence analyses presented hereafter are based upon
cDNA clones containing the complete coding sequences
of the MYB, which were isolated as a single fragment from
reverse transcribed RNA, with gene specific primer pairs
for each of the 13 sequences from spruce and five
sequences from pine. The numbering of pine MYB genes
(PtMYB1-8 and PtMYB14; no PtMYB5 and 6 reported) is
in accordance with Patzlaff et al., [10,11]; the numbering
of spruce genes was established on the basis of putative
orthology with the pine sequences.
In addition, we isolated the 13 corresponding sequences
from spruce genomic DNA (gDNA). Genomic DNA was
extracted from needles of white spruce using the
Genomic-Tip Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario). The
entire coding region with introns was isolated by PCR
amplification with gene specific primer pairs spanning
each gene's coding region (Additional file 1) and cloned
in pCR2.1 with the TA cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The gDNA was from Picea glauca genotype Pg653
and so did most of the cDNA clones (although a few came
from wild Picea glauca genotypes). Each clone was
sequenced at least through the MYB DBD in order to
determine the number of introns present in this region.
Some nucleotide differences were observed between
cDNA and gDNA sequences due to the genotypic variation, but no non-sense mutation were detected. The
genomic sequences of PgMYB 3, 6, 7 and 11 showed 1 to
3 non synonymous substitutions giving no less than
99.2% amino acids identity; however, we do not find
nucleotide mismatches in spruce MYB 2, 4, 8, 9 and 12.
The 13 MYB genes from spruce and five MYB genes from
pine have the following accession numbers: PgMYB1

and the housekeeping gene elongation factor alpha (EF1-α)
[dir8: contig10829] complete cds, 99% to Picea abies
[GenBank: AJ132534].
Sequence analyses and phylogenetic studies
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were
obtained with Clustal W [49] using BioEdit software version 6.0.7 and BoxShade 3.21 to highlight sequences.
Delineation of introns was achieved by aligning the cDNA
and genomic nucleotide sequences of the PgMYB from the
start codon to stop codon on the basis that introns begin
with GT and end with AG dinucleotides. Phylogenetic
studies were performed with the 13 predicted MYB protein sequences from white spruce, one sequence from
black spruce (PmMBF1, [12]), and seven loblolly pine
sequences including previously reported PtMYB1 and 4
[10,11]. We also included 11 diverse Arabidopsis MYB
sequences and two R1R2R3-MYB genes from human and
mouse as landmarks to classify the MYBs according to previous reports [18,19,30]. We constructed a neighbourjoining tree based on a Clustal W amino acid alignment
generated with the Mega 2.0 method [50] and using 1000
bootstraps to estimate the node strength (parameters are
Poisson correction and pair-wise deletion as described in
[30]).

The accession numbers of the Arabidopsis genes analysed
are: AtMYB13 [GenBank: At1g06180], PtMYB1 [GenBank:

genes are as above.
MEME analysis software [51] was used to identify amino
acid regions conserved between several members of a subgroup of sequences (according to Kranz et al. [18]) containing one or more spruce MYBs. The parameters setting
was the number of motifs to find: 5; minimum width of
motif: 5 and maximum: 15. We used complete protein
sequences of MYBs from 12 conifer species and from 14
angiosperm species (Additional file 2). We also included
10 partial conifer sequences that encompassed the C-terminal region [34] and were closely related to PgMYB6, 7
and 9 (Additional file 3).
Analysis of transcript accumulation by Q-RTPCR
To analyse the transcript abundance of PgMYBs, firststrand cDNA was synthesised starting from one microgram of RNA treated with amplification grade DNAse I
(Invitrogen) and purified on an RNeasy column (Qiagen),
using oligo(dT) primers and SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
resulting cDNA was diluted 1:5 with sterile RNAse-free
water and stored at -20°C; the same cDNA was used for all
Q-RTPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR) assays
for any given tissue sample. Steady-state mRNA levels
were determined on cDNA by quantitative RT-PCR using
Opticon Monitor 2 fluorescence detection system (MJ
research) and DyNAmo SYBR Green QPCR kit
(Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland). Gene primer pairs were
designed using the Primer 3 software [52] to anneal near
the 3' end of each transcript (usually in 3' UTR) to ensure
primer specificity. The forward and reverse primers were
as follows (amplicon length indicated in brackets):

PgMYB1: 5'-gattgtacattaacccagtaa-3' and 5'-taaaccatgtggtatctgtta-3' (148 bp);
PgMYB2: 5'-tgggtattctaggtatttcc-3' and 5'-attaggtaagtatgcaggg-3' (99 bp);
PgMYB3: 5'-agatcacggacccagatcaac-3' and 5'-gagcgaacgacctccttcag-3' (147 bp);

PgMYB5: 5'-aattctggcagcgaactg-3' and 5'-aatgcttcgtggtggaatc-3' (173 bp);

PgMYB13: 5'-aaattacagctagagtgagagg-3' and 5'-aacttgaaccgtacacgac-3' (86 bp) and
EF1-α (elongation factor alpha): 5'-aactggagaaggaacccaag3' and 5'-aacgacccaatggaggatac-3', (114 bp). Forward and
reverse primer pairs used for the Q-RTPCR of the wood
formation-related genes are:
PAL: 5'-tggatttgcatcctactg-3' and 5'-tccatcttcaactataggac-3'
(103 bp);
4CL: 5'-cattcctcaaaagcatgaagag-3' and 5'-atcgcatccacaaagtacac-3' (150 bp);
CCOaOMT: 5'-attgagatcagccaaatcc-3' and 5'-gcgctctccctataatcag-3' (124 bp);
AGP: 5'-gcgtccattgttttaatgtag-3' and 5'-tgtatttatccctctgtctgc3' (181 bp) and
CAD: 5'-ctggactacatcaatactgc-3' and 5'-gatttactcattctgcacg3' (141 bp).
The PCR reaction mixture (20 μL) consisted of 10 μL
DyNAmo SYBR Green qPCR mix, 1 μL primers (0.25 μM
forward and 0.25 μM reverse), 1 μL of cDNA and 8 μL of
RNase-free water. The cycling conditions were 95°C for 2
min, then 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec, 55°C for 10 sec,
72°C for 8 sec, followed by a plate reading. The melting
curve readings were carried out every 0.2°C from 65 to
95°C, holding 1 sec at each temperature. Standard curves

were established for each spruce MYB and cell-wallrelated cDNAs and were used to determine RNA abundance in each sample. The standards consisted of serial
dilutions of PCR amplicons prepared from each cDNA,
cloned in pCR2.1, with M13 reverse and forward primers.
Amplicon standards were gel purified (Qiagen), and product length and concentration were verified using a bioAnalyser (model 2100 Agilent Technologies, DNA 1000
LabChip kit). The standard curves were determined from
duplicate reactions from the dilutions series of each
amplicon. Raw data were converted with the following
parameters: no blank subtraction, subtract baseline and
average over cycle range according each case. We calculated the number of transcript molecules per ng of total
RNA [(DNA quantity quantified in g * DNA base pair
mass per gram of DNA)/M13 Reverse-Forward amplified
fragment length in bp]. For within tissue comparisons
that were carried on differentiation xylem (including
compression wood induction) and apical shoots young
trees, the RNA abundance was normalised using the abundance of RNA of the elongation factor alpha (EF1-α), as
an endogenous control (calculated as the following ratio:
target gene (ng)/EF1-α (ng)).
