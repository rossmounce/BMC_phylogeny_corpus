Abstract
Background: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in East Africa with the majority of the reported outbreaks
attributed to serotype O virus. In this study, phylogenetic analyses of the polyprotein coding region of serotype O
FMD viruses from Kenya and Uganda has been undertaken to infer evolutionary relationships and processes
responsible for the generation and maintenance of diversity within this serotype. FMD virus RNA was obtained
from six samples following virus isolation in cell culture and in one case by direct extraction from an
oropharyngeal sample. Following RT-PCR, the single long open reading frame, encoding the polyprotein, was
sequenced.
Results: Phylogenetic comparisons of the VP1 coding region showed that the recent East African viruses belong to
one lineage within the EA-2 topotype while an older Kenyan strain, K/52/1992 is a representative of the topotype
EA-1. Evolutionary relationships between the coding regions for the leader protease (L), the capsid region and
almost the entire coding region are monophyletic except for the K/52/1992 which is distinct. Furthermore,
phylogenetic relationships for the P2 and P3 regions suggest that the K/52/1992 is a probable recombinant
between serotypes A and O. A bootscan analysis of K/52/1992 with East African FMD serotype A viruses (A21/KEN/
1964 and A23/KEN/1965) and serotype O viral isolate (K/117/1999) revealed that the P2 region is probably derived
from a serotype A strain while the P3 region appears to be a mosaic derived from both serotypes A and O.
Conclusions: Sequences of the VP1 coding region from recent serotype O FMDVs from Kenya and Uganda are all
representatives of a specific East African lineage (topotype EA-2), a probable indication that hardly any FMD
introductions of this serotype have occurred from outside the region in the recent past. Furthermore, evidence for
interserotypic recombination, within the non-structural protein coding regions, between FMDVs of serotypes A and
O has been obtained. In addition to characterization using the VP1 coding region, analyses involving the nonstructural protein coding regions should be performed in order to identify evolutionary processes shaping FMD
viral populations.

Background
Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a member of
the Picornaviridae family, belonging to the genus
Aphthovirus [1] and is the causative agent of foot-andmouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious infection of

cloven-hoofed domestic animals and over 70 wildlife
species [2]. The viral genome is a positive-sense single
stranded RNA (about 8.3 kb, see Figure 1), encoding a
polyprotein which is processed to yield structural and
non-structural proteins [1]. The RNA genome undergoes a high rate of mutation due to error prone replication by the RNA polymerase resulting in high genetic
diversity [3], however, not all coding regions evolve at
the same rate [4]. The structural protein coding region,

particularly the sequence for VP1, has been shown to
vary significantly between strains and serotypes hence
it is used extensively for evolutionary relationship
inference [5]. Persistent infection, recombination, and
quasi-species dynamics have also been suggested as contributing to the genetic variation [6-8]. Globally, the
virus exists in seven distinct serotypes; the Southern
African territories [SAT] types 1-3 and Eurasian types
namely O, A, C and Asia 1. Immunity to one serotype
does not confer protection against another. In Africa,
FMD is endemic in the sub-Saharan region with six of
the known serotypes recorded in the Eastern African
region [9]. Of the numerous outbreaks reported in this
region, most are attributed to serotype O, followed by
A, SAT 2 and SAT 1 but some cases of serotype C have
been reported in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda [9]. SAT
3 has been isolated in 1970 and 1997 from African buffalo in the Queen Elizabeth National Park (Uganda) but
has otherwise not been recorded elsewhere in East
Africa [9,10]. Previous studies, based on VP1 coding
sequences, have shown that four different lineages (EA
1-4) of type O FMDV are present in this region[11].
This complex intra-serotypic variation coupled with the
presence of multiple serotypes has complicated disease
control, which is achieved mainly by vaccination and
restrictions on animal/animal product movement. In
East Africa, most molecular studies have sought to identify phylogenetic relationships among viruses relying on
the sequence of the VP1 coding region [12]. Although
used extensively for phylogenetic studies, the VP1
sequence alone may be inadequate for revealing all processes shaping diversity and evolution of the viruses in
the region [13-15].
Elsewhere on the African continent, remarkable progress in FMD molecular epidemiology has been made
particularly in Southern Africa, a region also characterized by SAT type endemicity. Molecular epidemiological
studies have been able to reveal the origin and routes of

FMD transmission in this region. In addition, the important epidemiological role of the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in maintenance of this virus and
transmission to other cloven-hoofed animals has been
highlighted [16-18].
In this study, we have analyzed the polyprotein coding
sequence (6719 nt) of serotype O FMD viruses to get
insights into relationships among these viruses to infer
processes shaping their diversity in the East African
region. Sequences analyzed in this study include isolates
from Kenya and Uganda obtained between the years 1992
and 2006 and sequences already in the Genbank database.

Materials and methods
Viral isolates

The viruses investigated in this study were collected
during outbreaks in the indicated years in Kenya (K)
and Uganda (U). Four samples; O/K/52/1992, O/K/117/
1999, O/K/109/2000 and O/K/48/2005 were from
Kiambu, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Kiambu districts,
respectively. FMDV RNA was extracted from these samples following virus propagation in baby hamster kidney
(BHK) cells. The O/U/25/2006 (Mpigi district) sequence
was generated from RNA prepared directly from an oropharyngeal sample while the O/U/312/2006 virus was
isolated from an orophyrangeal sample from Mbarara
district and grown in primary bovine thyroid (BTY)
cells.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PCR and
Cycle sequencing

RNA was extracted from virus harvests and directly
from orophyrangeal fluid using the QIAamp® Viral RNA
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA synthesis was carried
out using Ready-To-Go™ You-Prime First - Strand
Beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Sweden) with random hexamer primers (pdN6).

PCR reactions of overlapping fragments were performed in a final volume of 50 μl using 2-5 ng of
cDNA, 0.2 pmol of primers (Table 1) and 2.5 U of
AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems),
200 μM of each dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP) and
1.5 mM MgCl2. Following the activation of AmpliTaq
gold DNA polymerase at 95°C for 5 min, reaction mixtures were denatured at 95°C for 15 s followed by 60°C
for 2 min to allow for primer annealing. For each cycle,
a chain elongation step at 72°C for 1 min 20 s was
allowed. This process was repeated 30 times and final
extension continued at 72°C for 5 min. The resultant
PCR products were analysed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight marker (FX174-RF
DNA, Amersham Biosciences). Purification of the PCR
products to remove oligonucleotides, dNTPs and
enzyme was achieved with a QIAquick® PCR purification
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing was performed in both directions using a Big dye Terminator V
3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) and ran on an automated
DNA Sequencer (ABI PRISM® 3700) by Macrogen,
Korea, using the same primers as employed in the PCRs

generated per sample. Multiple alignments by log-expectation comparison were carried out using MUSCLE [19]
incorporated within Geneious 4.7.6 software [20]. Phylogenetic analyses involving the determination of models
of evolution were performed using hierarchical likelihood-ratio test of 24 models using PAUP*(v. 4.0 beta
10) [21] and MrModeltest (v 2.2) [22]. The GTR+I+G
model was used and Bayesian inference analysis performed using MrBayes (v.3.1.2) [23] with the following
settings: maximum likelihood model was six substitution
types (nst = 6), with base frequencies set to variable
values ("statefreqpr = dirichlet(1,1,1,1”). Rate variation
across sites with a proportion of invariable sites was
modeled using a gamma distribution (rates =
invgamma). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo search was
run with 4 chains for 500,000 generations with trees
sampled every 100 generations; the first 1250 were discarded as burnin [23]. Recombination between
sequences was analysed using SimPlot method 2.5 software [24].

Sequence Analysis

Sequencher software 4.8 (Gene Code Corporation) was
used to assemble the 12 overlapping fragment sequences

Almost the entire polyprotein coding sequence (6719 nt)
of five FMDV isolates and a single Ugandan FMDV
RNA sample were determined. Four of these samples

Balinda et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:199

had origins from the districts of Kiambu, Nakuru and
Uasin Gishu in Kenya (from 1992, 1999, 2000 and 2005
respectively) while the two Ugandan isolates were from
Mpigi and Mbarara districts (in 2006). All isolates
belong to serotype O with percentage nucleotide
sequence identities of the polyprotein coding region
with representatives of six FMDV serotype as follows; O
(89%), A(83%), C(84%), SAT1(73%), SAT2(77%) and
SAT3(73%). The generated sequences have further been
compared with sequences published in Genbank including the sequence of another recent Ugandan type O isolate from Kasese district (Accession no. EF611987[25]),
which was determined previously. Twenty one additional
serotype O sequences previously isolated from Europe,
Asia, South America and Africa were included in the
analysis. Furthermore, sequences from serotypes A, C,
SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 were included for comparative purposes.
Phylogenetic relationships have been determined using
the VP1 coding region for serotype identification.
Furthermore, analyses using the coding regions for the
Leader (L) protease, the whole capsid precursor (P1-2A)
and for the non-structural protein precursors P2 and P3
individually, as well as for almost the entire polyprotein,
have been performed. The phylogenetic relationships
identified between these East African serotype O strains
and representatives of each of the different FMDV serotypes for the VP1 coding regions are shown in Figure 2.
The recent strains from Kenya and Uganda analysed
here, each clearly belong to serotype O within topotype
EA-2 while the older strain K/52/1992 belongs to topotype EA-1. These recent viral isolates each belong to a
single evolutionary lineage albeit within different sublineages.
Figure 3 shows the inferred phylogenetic relationships
between serotype O viruses for the polyprotein coding
region. In this phylogeny, with the exception of K/52/
1992 which belongs to EA-1, the other East African
strains are grouped into a single lineage which is distinct
from the serotype O viruses isolated from Asia, Europe
and South America. Similar phylogenies were observed
for the Leader protease and the entire capsid precursor
(P1-2A) (data not shown).
Figures 4 and 5 show the phylogeny inferred from the
coding regions for the P2 (2BC) and P3 (3ABCD) precursors respectively. The P2 coding region follows a
similar pattern as for the other coding regions of the
East African strains with the exception that the isolate
K/52/1992 showed a close relationship in this region to
the sequence of a serotype A isolate (Accession no.
AY593766, A23/KEN/46/65) obtained in 1964 from
Kenya. Furthermore, within the P3 coding region, the
1992 Kenyan isolate is most closely related to a serotype
A isolate obtained in 1965 from Azerbaijan in the

Page 4 of 9

former USSR (Accession no. X74812) and to the A23/
KEN/1965 strain. It should be noted that in the other
regions of the genome these serotype A viruses were
most closely related to other serotype A virus strains
(see Figures 2 and 3). These observations suggested that
recombination may have occurred at some time between
serotype O and A viral strains.
Detection of Recombination

As indicated above in Figures 4 and 5, comparison of
the genome sequences within the P2 and P3 coding
regions showed that the O/K/52/1992 virus sequence in
these regions was most closely related to some serotype
A viruses although elsewhere within the genome this
Kenyan virus was most closely related to other O serotype viruses. In order to establish possible recombination events further analyses were performed using
similarity and bootscan plots (see Figure 6 and 7). The
similarity and bootscan plots show the pairwise genetic
similarities and bootscan values between a query
sequence (O/K/52/1992) and selected strains of serotypes A and O (AY593766/A23/KEN/1965, AY593761/
A21/KEN/1964 and O/K/117/1999) using a window size
of 200 in steps of 20 nucleotides along the alignment.
The examination of points at which similarities between
the query, O/K/52/1992 and the test sequences
increased or decreased, identified approximate break
points. Figure 6 shows that the O/K/52/1992 sequence
is most closely related to serotype O within the capsid
region but has similar levels of percentage identity to
both serotypes O and A within P2 and P3 coding
regions. The Bootscan analysis (Figure 7) shows this
query sequence is closely related to A23/KEN/1965
within the P2 region and has a mosaic pattern of similarity to both O/K/117/1999 and A21/KEN/1964 within
the P3 coding regions.

Discussion
Sequencing of these recent viruses from Kenya and
Uganda has allowed for the assessment of variation of
the East African isolates across almost the entire coding
region relative to viruses from Asia, Europe and to a
smaller extent South America. These East African
viruses belong to serotype O based on the sequence of
the VP1 coding region (Figure 2) and are part of a single
evolutionary lineage (topotype EA-2) except for K/52/
1992 (topotype EA-1). The related virus strains U/312/
2006 and O/UGA/2006 (accession no. EF611987) [25]
have also been identified as serotype O by antigen
ELISA (data not shown).
Within the East African lineage, two major divisions
are observed corresponding to their geographical locations with the Ugandan isolates comprising one sublineage and the Kenyan strains another. In addition, the

(values that concentrate on a single tree when data is informative given a specified model of evolution for a particular sequence data set).

Ugandan viruses are grouped in a temporal manner with
the Uganda (2006) isolates clustering together but separate from the Uganda (2002) isolates. The East African
lineage appears to have evolved independently from
other serotype O viruses which are circulating globally.
From comparisons of published serotype O sequences,
three other main lineages were observed (Figure 3). An
Asian lineage includes O/Akesu/1958 and O/HKN/2002
while a second lineage, widely referred to as the PanAsia
I lineage [26], includes recent European O and Asian
strains, the PanAsia II lineage (Figure 2) is represented
by a viral strain from Pakistan (EF494501/O/PAK/06/
2006) collected in the year 2006. The last lineage is
comprised of earlier European strains from 1966 and
1967 together with the Campos strain from South
America, indicative of intercontinental transmission
between the Asian continent and Europe as well as
South America and Europe.
Phylogenetic relationships of the P2 and P3 coding
regions placed the K/52/1992 strain in a close relationship with serotype A viruses (from Kenya in 1965 and

Azerbaijan/USSR/1965) (Figures 4 and 5). This points to
the possibility that this strain may have arisen by recombination between viruses of different serotypes, a process
seen within many picornaviruses both in nature, e.g. for
poliovirus, Human enterovirus B [6,27-29], and in the
laboratory including with FMD viruses [28]. The mosaic
pattern observed within the P3 coding region may suggest recombination although this could also indicate
genetic convergence. Earlier studies have shown that
inter serotypic genetic exchange occurs more frequently
within the Euro-asiatic viruses in comparison to
amongst SATs or even between SAT and non-SAT
viruses [8].
It is noteworthy that the most prevalent serotypes in
the East Africa region are O followed by A [9] strongly
suggesting the possibility of co-infection with both or
even more serotypes within some animals.
The findings reveal the complexity of FMDV evolution, consistent with earlier studies that have shown that
recombination is mainly restricted to non-structural
coding regions.

This study therefore supports recombination as an
evolutionary force causing genetic diversity within
FMDV and shows the need for full genome analyses to
identify such events.
