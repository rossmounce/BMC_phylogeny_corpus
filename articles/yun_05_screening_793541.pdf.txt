Abstract
Metagenomics has been successfully applied to isolate novel biocatalysts from the uncultured
microbiota in the environment. Two types of screening have been used to identify clones carrying
desired traits from metagenomic libraries: function-based screening, and sequence-based screening.
Both function- and sequence- based screening have individual advantages and disadvantages, and
they have been applied successfully to discover biocatalysts from metagenome. However, both
strategies are laborious and tedious because of the low frequency of screening hits. A recent paper
introduced a high throughput screening strategy, termed substrate-induced gene-expression
screening (SIGEX). SIGEX is designed to select the clones harboring catabolic genes induced by
various substrates in concert with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). This method was
applied successfully to isolate aromatic hydrocarbon-induced genes from a metagenomic library.
Although SIGEX has many limitations, it is expected to provide economic advantages, especially to
industry.

Review
More than 99% of bacteria in the environment cannot be
cultured using conventional methods [1,2]. To study and
use the genomes of such uncultured microbes, metagenomics has been in the spotlight since the 1990s [3]. Many
studies have constructed metagenomic libraries to search
for novel biocatalysts or molecules for biotechnological
and pharmaceutical applications. To date, metagenomics
has uncovered a variety of novel genes ranged from small
genes conferring enzymes to complex gene clusters encoding proteins involved in antibiotic production, using different kinds of vectors such as plasmids, cosmids, fosmids
and bacterial artificial chromosomes [4]. However, the
efficiency of searching for novel catalysts from metagenome can still be improved. Screening for desired traits

needs improvement because this step is still labor-intensive and time-consuming. This mini-review discusses the
strategies that have been used in metagenome screening,
particularly the recently introduced screening strategy,
SIGEX. The characteristics of the discussed strategies are
summarized in Table 1.
Functional- and sequence based screening
Two strategies are generally used to screen and identify
novel biocatalysts or genes involved in the production of
antibiotic from metagenomic libraries: function-based
and sequence-based screening. In function-based screening, clones expressing desired traits are selected from
libraries, and aspects of molecular biology and biochemistry of active clones are analyzed. Many enzymes of

industrial importance have been discovered using this
strategy (Table 1). This approach enables the rapid acquisition of clones that have potential of direct application in
industry. Moreover, this screening method can detect
genes with completely novel DNA sequences, which may
have functions distinct from known biocatalysts. However, function-based screening has several limitations.
This method requires expression of the function of interest in the host cell (e.g. Escherichia coli) as well as clustering of all of the genes required for the function. In
addition, efficient and economical screening methods for
desired traits must be established to facilitate highthroughput-screening of vast libraries.
Conversely, sequence-based screening is not dependent
on the expression of cloned genes in heterologous hosts.
Generally it is based on the conserved DNA sequences of
target genes. Hybridizations or PCR are performed based
on the deduced DNA consensus. However the limitations
of sequence-based screening are that DNA consensus
must be analyzed and determined, which cannot be
applied to many biocatalysts, and that it does not guarantee acquisition of full-length genes or full gene clusters
that are necessary for the production of the desired product. Moreover, the sequence-based screening never screens
desired genes with completely different sequences, and
easy expression or correct folding of the screened gene is
not assured. In metagenomics, several novel enzymes of
industrial importance have been screened successfully
using this strategy, but the typical application of
sequence-based screening is to obtain ribosomal RNA
genes for phylogenetic surveys.

SIGEX

As a form of sequence-based screening, shotgun sequencing of metagenomic libraries has recently provided vast
amount of data, including phylogenetic relationships,
millions of novel genes, and deduced metabolic pathways
of uncultured bacteria [5-7]. Some of the novel genes
might be of industrial importance. However, shotgun
sequencing is extremely expensive and labor intensive,
especially when one aims to discover genes of desired
traits. Moreover, since the data from shotgun sequencing
are analyzed in sequence-similarity searches based on
constructed database, this method is not free from the
limitations of sequence-based screening.
Although both of function- and sequence-based screening
strategies have been applied to isolate novel biocatalysts
from metagenome, both approaches are laborious due to
the low frequency of clones with desired traits (e.g. 4 from
930,000) [8]. To improve the frequency of screening, several strategies have been developed. For example, to overcome the difficulties with the heterologous expression of
secondary metabolites, Streptomyces lividnas or Pseudomonas putida have been used in addition to E. coli [911]. In addition, enrichment steps for uncultured microorganisms containing the desired traits have been used
successfully before library construction [12-15]. This
approach is also advantageous because it overcomes the
cloning difficulties due to the contaminants in environmental samples. Yet, the biased selection of metagenome
argues against enrichment.

SIGEX, the third screening method
In an effort to improve the frequency of screening hits,
Kazuya Watanabe and colleagues proposed substrateinduced gene expression screening (SIGEX), and its utility
was evaluated for the screening of aromatic hydrocarboninduced genes from a groundwater metagenome library
[16].

occasionally toxic, cause side-effects, and are generally
more expensive than unmodified substrates. Moreover,
SIGEX enables the deduction of the substrates for an
unknown enzyme from the induction substrate used in
the SIGEX screening. This helps to increase scientific
knowledge about the genetics of previously unknown and
hypothetical genes.

To design of SIGEX is based on the facts that the expression of catabolic genes is generally induced by substrates
or metabolites of catabolic enzymes, and that the expression of catabolic genes is controlled by regulatory elements located proximately in many cases. SIGEX screens
the clones harboring desired catabolic genes that are
expressed in the presence of substrates but are not
expressed in the absence of substrates. The procedure is
described in Figure 1. To make SIGEX a high-throughput
process, an operon-trap vector (p18GFP) was constructed,
in which the cloning site divides the lac promoter and the
gfp structural gene. Metagenomic libraries are constructed
using p18GFP (Step 1). Self-ligated clones and the clones
expressing gfp constitutively are removed by IPTG induction in the absence of the substrate (Step 2). The expression of catabolic genes in cloned metagenomic DNA is
determined by gfp expression in the presence of the substrate (Step 3), and then the positive clones are separated
on agar plates and characterized (Step 4). Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) is applied to the sorting and
separation of GFP-expressing clones, i.e. the clones with
desired catabolic genes.

However, the application of SIGEX has limitations. First,
SIGEX is sensitive to the structure and orientation of genes
with desired traits. SIGEX misses catabolic genes that are
expressed constitutively. In addition, SIGEX cannot detect
any active clones in which the desired catabolic genes are
cloned in the direction opposite gfp. Moreover, it misses
the active clones that have a transcription terminator
between catabolic genes and the following gfp. In these
cases, conventional function-based screening methods
have been successfully applied to detect active clones. Particularly for the last reason, SIGEX is not suitable for
applying to metagenomic libraries harboring large insert
DNA due to the abundance of transcription terminators
[17]. Because the probability of finding a screening hit
using function-based screening increases exponentially
with DNA insert size [18], the application of SIGEX
should be considered carefully, especially when large
pieces of environmental DNA are readily prepared. Second, substrates that do not migrate to the cytoplasm cannot be used with SIGEX. Many enzymes, such as amylases,
proteases, lipases, cellulases and xylanases target macromolecules that do not migrate to the cytoplasm. To date,
such enzymes have been detected by the incidental natural secretion of intracellular proteins or artificial cell disruption. Since many of these enzymes are of industrial
importance, this drawback cannot be overlooked. Finally,
the gate setting in FACS and the media conditions containing the inducer are critical for discriminating falsepositive and false-negative results. Therefore, when SIGEX
is applied, these drawbacks should be considered
carefully.

Watenabe and colleagues constructed a metagenomic
library using groundwater sample and successfully
applied SIGEX to isolate 33 clones induced by benzoate
and two clones induced by naphthalene from 152,000
clones [16]. In addition these researchers showed that
enzyme Bzo71-8 P450 from the metagenomic library is
novel. These data demonstrate the practice of SIGEX for
screening catabolic genes using appropriate inducers or
substrates, and the possibility of SIGEX to yield more
active clones than conventional screening methods.
Advantages and disadvantages of SIGEX
SIGEX has many advantages in metagenome screening. It
provides an efficient and economic way of high throughput screening, because it allows for semi-automation
thereby saving time, labor and expenses. This is particularly important for industrial applications. SIGEX is also
advantageous because it can detect catabolic genes for
which colorimetric or other on-plate screening methods
are not established. Using this strategy, the Watanabe
group screened hydrocarbon-induced genes, which are
difficult to screen using conventional methods [16]. In
addition, SIGEX does not require the modified substrates
that are often used in colorimetric screenings, which are

In conclusion, under the conditions where SIGEX is applicable, i.e. when appropriate substrates and target genes are
selected, and the gate-setting of FACS is optimized, SIGEX
can be a very powerful tool, especially to industry, for
screening genes involved in antibiotics production or biodegradation induced by small molecules.

Conclusion
Metagenomics has proven effective for isolating novel
biocatalysts from the environment as well as to acquire
ecological data. Its scale and scope have been expanded
since its concept was first introduced. For example,
robotic automation has been developed to construct and
screen metagenomic libraries, and large corporations have
provided substantial funding for metagenomics. However

the major problems in constructing metagenomic libraries remain to be solved. No standard protocol exists for
isolating sufficiently purified metagenomic DNA from
environmental samples. In addition, the heterologous
expression system of genes from metagenome requires
further improvement. An efficient expression system

other than E.coli should be developed and settled (trials
have recently begun). Moreover, since the conventional
screening system is costly and time-consuming despite the
recent improvement of automation, it remains necessary
to develop more effective and economic strategies. SIGEX
is a good way to overcome this bottleneck. Therefore, to

solved, and improved technologies should be developed.
