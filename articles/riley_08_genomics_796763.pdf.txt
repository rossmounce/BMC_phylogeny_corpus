Abstract
Background: The genome sequence of the sea-ice bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii 37, which
grows exponentially at -12C, may reveal features that help to explain how this extreme
psychrophile is able to grow at such low temperatures. Determination of the whole genome
sequence allows comparison with genes of other psychrophiles and mesophiles.
Results: Correspondence analysis of the composition of all P. ingrahamii proteins showed that (1)
there are 6 classes of proteins, at least one more than other bacteria, (2) integral inner membrane
proteins are not sharply separated from bulk proteins suggesting that, overall, they may have a
lower hydrophobic character, and (3) there is strong opposition between asparagine and the
oxygen-sensitive amino acids methionine, arginine, cysteine and histidine and (4) one of the
previously unseen clusters of proteins has a high proportion of "orphan" hypothetical proteins,
raising the possibility these are cold-specific proteins.
Based on annotation of proteins by sequence similarity, (1) P. ingrahamii has a large number (61) of
regulators of cyclic GDP, suggesting that this bacterium produces an extracellular polysaccharide
that may help sequester water or lower the freezing point in the vicinity of the cell. (2) P. ingrahamii
has genes for production of the osmolyte, betaine choline, which may balance the osmotic pressure
as sea ice freezes. (3) P. ingrahamii has a large number (11) of three-subunit TRAP systems that may
play an important role in the transport of nutrients into the cell at low temperatures. (4)
Chaperones and stress proteins may play a critical role in transforming nascent polypeptides into
3-dimensional configurations that permit low temperature growth. (5) Metabolic properties of P.
ingrahamii were deduced. Finally, a few small sets of proteins of unknown function which may play
a role in psychrophily have been singled out as worthy of future study.
Conclusion: The results of this genomic analysis provide a springboard for further investigations
into mechanisms of psychrophily. Focus on the role of asparagine excess in proteins, targeted
phenotypic characterizations and gene expression investigations are needed to ascertain if and how
the organism regulates various proteins in response to growth at lower temperatures.

Background
Well over half of the earth's surface is cold: deep oceans,
mountains, polar regions. Likewise, Earth's solar system
contains many planets and planetary bodies that are also
cold. The cold environments on Earth are teeming with
life [1] offering hope that other cold environments in our
solar system such as Mars and Jupiter's moon, Europa,
may harbor life [2]. For this reason it is surprising that so
little is know about the lifestyle, particularly of microbial
psychrophiles at low temperatures.
Psychrophiles have been studied primarily to understand
biological mechanisms of adaptation to extreme conditions. Microbial physiologists have long been interested
in psychrophiles as they employ mechanisms allowing
them to maintain life processes at temperatures where
rates of reactions and molecular properties present challenges. In reaching for an understanding of how life processes work at extremes of temperature, most of the focus
to date has been on the properties of enzymes of extremophiles (reviewed by [3,4]). No single consistent answer
has emerged to account for adaptation to temperature
extremes. To date, no single type of modification is uniformly found in the enzymes of psychrophiles; instead
numerous small and subtle differences appear to account
for their increased flexibility thereby enabling them to
function at low temperatures.
Recently whole genome sequences have been determined
for psychrophiles Colwellia psychrerythraea 34 H [5], Idiomarina loihiensis L2TR [6], and Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 [7]. We now add the genomic sequence
of the extreme species, Psychromonas ingrahamii 37 which
grows at even colder temperatures. Availability of complete genome sequences provides the opportunity to
search all of the proteins of the organisms for similarities
and differences that might have bearing on the ability of
the organism to grow at low temperatures.
The extreme psychrophile, Psychromonas ingrahamii was
isolated from sea ice from the Arctic. It grows exponentially with a doubling time of 240 hours at -12°C and may
well grow at even lower temperatures [8]. These temperatures do not necessarily solidify salt water or cytoplasm
into ice. Liquid water has been shown to exist at grain contacts as low as -20C [2].

Results and Discussion
The P. ingrahamii genome
The single, circular chromosome of 4.56 Mb constituting
the genome of P. ingrahamii 37 was sequenced as a set of
contigs by the DOE Joint Genome Institute Production
Genomics Facility, 2800 Mitchell Drive, Walnut Creek, CA
94598, and finished at DOE Joint Genome Institute, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/210

Alamos, NM 87545. It was annotated at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 and deposited
as GenBank file CP000510.1. Altogether 3708 genes were
identified, 3545 of which were proteins of 83 residues or
longer. A second round of annotation is described below.
Properties of proteins
Size
One can ask whether the sizes of proteins of a psychrophile differ from those of a mesophile. The sequences
of all proteins of P. ingrahamii were compared to
sequences of all proteins of three other bacteria:
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia
coli K-12 MG1655. 916 protein sequences were conserved
among all four bacteria. The great majority of the conserved proteins were enzymes. The distribution of lengths
of the 916 orthologous proteins were compared, revealing
that the distribution was about the same for the comparable proteins in all four bacteria (Figure 1). Ideas that proteins that are required to function at low temperatures
would be either shorter or longer than those of mesophiles are not borne out.
Amino acid composition
Amino acid composition of an organism's proteins is
affected by nucleotide composition of the DNA. The GC
content of P. ingrahamii DNA was determined experimentally to be 40% [8], verified by the composition of the
total genome nucleotide sequence (40.1%). Overall
amino acid content of the encoded proteins compared to
those of V. cholerae, S. oneidensis and E. coli is shown in
Table 1 (P. Sharp, personal comunication). The amino
acids isoleucine, asparagine, lysine, phenylalanine and
tyrosine all are present in higher percentage in P. ingrahamii.

However, like the genome, the codons for these residues
are GC rich, a factor that must be taken into account.
Codon usage for P. ingrahamii is shown in Table 2 for all
CDSs (coding DNA sequences) and for the highly
expressed genes tuf, tsf, fusA+RP genes (P. Sharp, personal
communication). Thus when amino acid content is examined as a function of GC3s, correcting for GC content at
synonymously variable third positions, the overall amino
acid composition of P. ingrahamii was found not to be
remarkable. At the value of 34.2 determined for P. ingrahamii, amino acid contents fall on the curves generated for
GC3s dependency in 80 other organisms (P. Sharp, personal communication) (data not shown) [9].
Correspondence analysis (CA)
Lobry and Chessel [10] examined datasets of amino acid
content and codon usage in thermophilic and mesophic
bacteria and found evidence that the amino acid composition of thermophilic proteins was under the control of a

pressure at the nucleic acid level, not a selection at the protein level. An extended study [11] produced similar results
of no connection. However, the authors identified the
most discriminating codon as being AGG for arginine,
present in many thermophiles, not in either mesophiles
or a psychrophile. P. ingrahamii fits this observation in
that it does not use the AGG codon (Table 2).

We analyzed the amino acid compositions of all individual proteins of P. ingrahamii by CA [12] after trimming the
first 10 and last 5 residues because there is a strong nucleotide bias at these positions. Data for each protein is presented in Additional file 1: "Ping Correspondence
Analysis.xls". Clustering of groups of proteins with similar
composition was performed using a bayesian approach as
proposed by Bailly-Bechet et al. [13] Figure 2 presents a

plot of the first three most informative axes: hydrophobicity, aromaticity and asparagine content.
The proteins fell into six classes whereas most bacteria
contain at most five well separated clusters with bayesian
clustering and at most four with dynamic clouds clustering [14]. Proteins of two bacterial proteomes examined to
date fall into four clusters, Aeropyrum pernix and Thermoplasma acidophilum [14]. Subsequently it was seen that psychrophilic P. haloplanktis has 5 clusters [7], exceeded now
by P. ingrahamii, a more extreme psychrophile, which
resolves into six. In P. ingrahamii, the bulk of the proteins
fall into three clusters (clusters 1, 2, 6). The integral inner
membrane proteins (IIMPs) fall largely into clusters 3 and
5 (Figure 2). In other bacteria the IIMPs are distinctly separate from the bulk of other proteins [14]. In P. ingrahamii, however, separation is poor and there is some
continuity between the IIMPs and the bulk proteins. Evidently the property of hydrophobicity is not distributed in
psychrophile proteins as in mesophiles.
Not seen in any other bacteria viewed to date by CA is the
sixth group, cluster 4. This group is of 57 proteins characterized by an excess of threonine that forms a bleb protruding from one of the core protein clusters. Examining
the annotations of these proteins reveals that almost half
are hypothetical proteins with no homologs in other bacteria examined at threshold Pam 150. It is tempting to
suggest this group of proteins could be involved in facilitating low temperature growth.
As to amino acid content, one sees that asparagine occurs
more frequently than expected for a random distribution,

and on the other hand that cysteine, methionine, arginine
and histidine are relatively rare (Figure 2). This same
asparagine-driven bias has been seen in other psychrophiles, notably P. haloplanktis [7]. Deamidation via
cyclization into aspartate threatens integrity of asparagine,
a process which is sensitive to higher temperature, providing a rationale for an asparagine excess in psychrophiles.
The corresponding lower amounts of cysteine, methionine, arginine and histidine can be understood as decreasing proportions of these oxygen-sensitive residues.
Oxygen concentrations are higher in the liquid medium at
low temperatures. Although similar composition gradients were seen in another psychrophile, P. haloplanktis,
they are stronger in P. ingrahamii, perhaps correlated with
its lower growth temperatures.
Thus, the main features that emerged from the CA of P.
ingrahamii protein compositons (Figure 2) are that (1)
there are more classes of proteins than have been seen in
other bacteria, (2) one of these classes, cluster 4, has a
high proportion of "orphan" hypothetical proteins, (3)
IIMPs merge into bulk proteins rather than occupying a
separate space, possibly due to IIMPs having lower hydrophobic character, and (4) one notes the strong opposition
between asparagine, sensitive to heat, and the amino acids
methionine, arginine, cysteine and histidine, sensitive to
oxygen.
Annotation
Of the 3545 genes for proteins of length 83 or more, 41
are fusions of two genes which in other organisms are separate and independent. They are distributed as 21 fused
enzymes, 9 fused regulator components, 4 fused ABC

transporter components, 4 fused phosphotransferase system (PTS) components and 3 mixed enzyme-regulator
combinations. Fused genes can cause problems with
annotation based on results of sequence similarity algorithms. To avoid such problems, we split fused genes for
purposes of sequence comparisons in order to be able to
identify orthologs of both parts independently.
The first round of annotation was carried out at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, posted for public access August
2006 [15]. We have here supplemented this data with
manual analysis using the dynamic search programs of
the Darwin system [16]. In this system after first approximations of sequence similarities, amino acid substitution
tables are recalculated appropriate to degree of similarity
and to the codon usage, and then pairwise alignments are

produced. Degree of similarity between two sequences is
expressed as percent identity and as Pam values [The Pam
score (point accepted mutations) is an inverse measure of
sequence differences] [17].
We first processed the P. ingrahamii protein sequences in
relation to the then-completed 111 bacterial genomes. We
extracted from this data the match with best (lowest) Pam
score for each P. ingrahamii protein. The descriptions of
the orthologs were retrieved from RefSeq and/or Genbank
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) Web site [18]. The results allowed us to add some
predicted protein products to the initial JGI annotation
results.

Since the set of 111 bacterial genomes we first used was
not balanced in respect to types of bacteria, we also identified orthologs in a reference set of 53 genomic sequences
of organisms which were chosen to span the breadth of
bacterial species. To include other sequenced psychrophiles, the set includes two additional marine species, C. psychrerythraea 34 H and I. loihiensis. C.
psychrerythraea 34 H grows over the range -1C to 10C [5];
I. loihiensis has a broad temperature range from 4C to 46C
[6].
Annotations and function information are attached in
Additional file 2: "Ping Annotations 2.xls". The rank order
of similar sequences and number of "best hits" are shown
in Table 3.
Surprisingly, the organism with greatest similarity is V.
cholerae. It is surprising because neither is V. cholerae one
of the psychrophiles nor is it any member of the Order
Alteromonadales. P. ingrahamii is a member of the Family
Alteromonadacae in the Order Alteromondales. Psychromonas
is related to other members of this family such as
Shewanella, Colwellia and Idiomarina [20]. Like some other
members of these families, P. ingrahamii is a marine
organism and has gas vesicles. We found there are extensive similarities with proteins of other Alteromonads as
expected, but there are even more similarities with V. cholerae, even though the the Order Vibrionales and Family
Vibrionaceae are separate from the Alteromonadales [19].
This observation may be explained by the selected conservation of genes from a common ancestor between these
two genera and their loss by their closest relatives or it
may indicate confusion due to unexpected horizontal
gene transfer of 16S rDNA within these lineages.
In manually curating, we used practices aimed both at discovery and at caution. Whenever a "best match" was
annotated as a hypothetical protein, yielding no information, we looked to the next best match. Sometimes the
next best match was a very good one which provided useful information based on the annotated gene product of
that ortholog.

It is widely appreciated in the genomics community that
annotation by transfer of stipulated annotations from
other organisms becomes ever more problematic at lower
levels of similarity and as the number of sequential steps
of sequence matches increases between the query and an
experimentally demonstrated gene product. We were careful to be conservative in attributing a gene product if the
match was not very close. When Pam scores were low
(excellent match), we transferred directly the annotation
of the match; but when in a middle range, 75–125, we
sometimes generalized, removing specificity (i.e. we stipulated "an aminotransferase" instead of "aspartate aminotransferase"); and when Pam scores were high, over
125, we often used the word "predicted" to indicate that
the assignment was based on a less rigorous threshold
than for other assignments.
When formulating words of description of the gene products, we adopted another practice. We made an effort to
name similar products similarly. We have tried to standardize product descriptions to some extent in order to
make information on like proteins easier to find, thus
making a list of alphabetized product names useful.
Assignments
From the above two sets of ortholog matches combined
with the work of the JGI scientists, we constructed a table
of P. ingrahamii gene numbers and corresponding bestguess annotated gene products available in Additional file
2: "Ping Annotations 2". Included in the table are the gene
number, the type of gene product (enzyme, regulator, etc)
and the name of the protein. (Gene number throughout
this report is the number of the locus_tag which, as submitted December 2006 to Genbank, CP000510.1, has the
prefix "Ping"). Altogether 217 proteins originally characterized as unknown gained an annotation by the manual
process, some suggestive, others substantive.
Kinds of proteins
Table 4 gives classification of all proteins of P. ingrahamii
by imputed function. The distribution of sizes of classes is
similar to that for Escherichia coli K-12 [20] with enzymes
being the largest class followed by transporters, then regulators, the rest divided into smaller categories.
Horizontal transfer
Eighty-one genes were identifiable as currently known
horizontally transferrable loci such as transposases of
insertion sequences and integrases of phages. Thus clearly
horizontal exchange of mobile elements into the chromosome has taken place. Among the bacteria tested, most
such loci of P. ingrahamii matched elements of Shewanella
oneidensis MR1. As is the case with so many genome
sequences, we cannot know with currently available information how much of the genome of P. ingrahamii was

RNA
There are 10 ribosomal RNA clusters containing 5S, 16S,
23S RNAs (see Additional file 2). The relatively high
number could reflect the need for high capacity of translation at cold temperatures and an ability to adapt quickly
to changing conditions of nutrient availability [21]. 86
tRNA genes support translation.

Gene clusters
There are 100 contiguous clusters of two or more related
genes such as subunits of an enzyme or pathway-related
proteins. The largest cluster, for septum formation and
peptidogylcan synthesis enzymes, comprises 14 genes.
These are genes 1140 through 1153. Altogether 850, or
25% of CDSs, reside in clusters related by function.
Paralogous groups
Enumeration of sets of paralogs within a genome requires
definition of degree of relatedness. In the initial analysis
done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1799 proteins
were identified as belonging to 510 paralogous clusters.
Using Darwin analysis [22] and a more conservative
threshold of relatedness (Pam =< 175), 965 proteins were
identified as grouped into 273 paralogous families of sizes
ranging from two to 66. This threshold is comparable to
that used to enumerate E. coli paralogs [23] and permits
comparison. Functions of paralogous groups of size 7 or
above are shown in Table 5. Just as had been found previously for E. coli, the largest paralogous groups are transporters and regulators. Even though enzymes are present
in the genome in the largest numbers, they fall into
smaller, more differentiated families. For transporters and
also regulators, evidently a limited number of mechanisms have evolved for these functions, creating large
groups of similar proteins of either transporters or regulators that differ in specificity but not in mechanism of
action. Enzymes are more diverse, use a larger variety of
mechanisms, thus they fall into a larger number of smaller
groups of similar proteins.

Intermediary metabolism
Almost half of all enzymes annotated in P. ingrahamii
(634/1317) were identified as enzymes of small molecule
metabolism. Not all enzymes of every pathway were
found, not unexpected since some orthologs may not
reach the threshold of similarity employed, nevertheless
there is strong evidence for standard pathways of intermediary metabolism being present.

P. ingrahamii is a facultative anaerobe capable of both respiratory and fermentative metabolism [24]. In agreement
we find in its enzyme sequences that pathways are present
for fermentation, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway,
the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis. For respiration, electron transfer agents are present such as iron-sulfur centers,
flavodoxin and flavoproteins, ubiquinone, and cytochromes; for anaerobic respiration, sequences of reductases for fumarate, nitrate, nitrite and sulfite are present
(Table 6). Nitrate reduction has been observed experimentally [24]. In addition there are 10 members of the
short-chain oxidoreductase family and 8 oxidoreductases
identified by domain. Any one of these could be either a
primary dehydrogenase or a terminal reductase not yet
characterized (Table 7). The varieties of oxidants that
appear to be used by P. ingrahamii suggest that its capabilities in this regard are comparable to that of Shewanella
species.
Enzymes are present for pathways of utilization of both
carbohydrates and amino acids as carbon and energy
sources. Glycerol was the carbon source provided in the
medium for the below-freezing temperature growth
experiments [8]. In agreement, genes for glycerol uptake
(genes 3166, 3169), glycerol kinase (3168) and dehydrogenase (3207) are present.
Carbon sources besides glucose that were found experimentally to be utilized by P. ingrahamii [24] were compared with the list of enzyme orthologs. One finds in P.
ingrahamii genes for enzymes for utilization of fructose
(971, 3552), galactose (2016, 2017), mannitol (89), Nacetylglucosamine (488–490), ribose (344) and sucrose
(974), in agreement with experimental findings. We also
found genetic evidence for the capability to utilize lactose
(2019) and glucuronate (130,131, 132 and 136).
However comparing to E. coli enzymes, many of the
sequences of enzymes for utilization of other carbohydrates are not present in P. ingrahamii. These include
enzymes for utilization of arabinose, xylose, sorbitol or
galactitol. Again the absence is in agreement with experimental observations [24]. Also missing are orthologs of E.
coli enzymes for utilization of tagatose, fucose, rhamnose,
glucarate, galactarate, altronate or idonate. These carbon
sources have not yet been tested in culture. This picture is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/210

similar to the one found in S. oneidensis, a relatively poor
capacity to utilize a variety of monomeric carbohydrates
[25].
Although capability for utilization of carbohydrates is
restricted, by contrast P. ingrahamii does have sequences
for enzymes for utilization of most amino acids, and
many of these have been verified experimentally.
Transaminases convert to the corresponding keto acids,
decarboxylases to amines. The amino group can be
removed with dehydratases or lyases.
Fatty acids, breakdown
The four major enzymes of degradation of fatty acids are
present, capable of generating acetyl-CoA for general
metabolism (Table 7).
Fatty acids, biosynthesis
It has long been known that proteobacteria at low temperatures adjust fatty acid composition to the more flexible
unsaturated and/or branched types. P. ingrahamii has
genes for enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis (Table 7).
Close similarity is found for all E. coli enzymes starting
with malonyl-CoA, proceeding via malonyl-ACP through
the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle, each cycle adding 2-carbon moieties. At the 10-carbon level, the pathway of
unsaturated fatty acids commences. Orthologs for all E.
coli enzymes of the unsaturation pathway are present
except for the last enzyme, FabI. Final steps for synthesis
of unsaturated fatty acids by P. ingrahamii must differ
from those in E. coli. The principal fatty acids that were
detected in the organism experimentally are the saturated
16:0 (18.7%) and the singly unsaturated 16:1ω7c
(67.0%) [24].

P. ingrahamii has sequences of the four subunits of a polyunsaturase closely similar to the polyunsaturase in psychrophile C. psychrerythraea 34H (Table 8). It is reasonable
to suppose that at the very low temperatures of the environment P. ingrahamii might require fatty acids with more
than one unsaturated bond. Also branched chain fatty
acids are often found at cold temperatures. Based on
enzyme sequences, precursors for synthesis of the
branched-chain fatty acids could be generated as intermediates in breakdown of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. However, neither polyunsaturated nor
branched chain fatty acids were detected in P. ingrahamii
cultures grown at about 6 to 8°C (i.e. refrigerator) conditions [25]. Perhaps the polyunsaturated fatty acids are
produced at lower temperatures or were not detected by
the fatty acid analysis procedure used.
Interestingly, two polyunsaturated fatty acids, 20:5 (eicosapentaenoic acid) and 22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid), have

Glycogen storage
There are genes for 6 glucose-1-phosphate adenyltransferases (299, 1296, 2063, 3033,3034 and 3464) any one
of which could serve for the first step in synthesis of glycogen, and there are 2 glycogen/starch synthases (2348
and 3035). One or more of the 15 glycosyl transferases
could be involved in synthetic reactions.
Digestion of macromolecules
Like other marine organisms, P. ingrahamii appears to
have the capability of utilizing macromolecules in the
environment for nutrition and energy. P. ingrahamii has

genes for a relatively large number of 48 peptidases and
proteases (Table 8). Some of these are no doubt required
for internal turnover, but some seem likely to be exported
out of the cell in order to hydrolyze environmental proteins, thus providing small molecular weight nutrients for
uptake. P. ingrahamii has a complete general secretion system capable of excreting such degradative enzymes to the
environment. To take up the digestion products of proteolysis, there are ABC-type transporters for peptides, many
for amino acids. Not consistent with this prediction is the
experimental observation that gelatin is not hydrolysed
[24].
Storage glycogen as well as external polysaccharides
including starch could be hydrozysed for production of

sugars to supply energy. For utilization of some polysaccharides there are amylases, glucosidases, debranching
enzymes, and glycosyl hydrolases (Table 8), some of
which may be intracellular and others extracellular. There
are 7 lytic transglycosylases which, in cleaving peptidoglycan links could be involved in modellingof the cell or
could break up environmental cell wall fragments. Capability to hydrolyse fats also exists as there are 3 lipases, 5
phospholipases and a lyso-lipase. There are many
enzymes hydrolyzing nucleic acids with different specificities and functions, many with vital internal metabolic
roles. In addition, some may be used to hydrolyze external nucleic acid debris (Table 8).
Other hydrolases are encoded in the genome whose physiological roles are not currently known, for example there
are 11 HAD-superfamily hydrolases, 7 alpha/beta hydrolase fold proteins, 5 metal-dependent phosphohydrolases.
Chaperones and stress proteins
Multiple chaperone proteins are encoded in P. ingrahamii,
suggesting that folding of proteins is an important process
(Table 9). There are 4 proteins like DnaK, 4 like DnaJ, 3
GroEL monomers and 2 GroES monomers There are 12
peptidylprolyl isomerases (trigger factors that act at nascent polypeptide chains), and a ClpB protein disaggregating complex. One can speculate that the the role of the
chaperones is to guide nascent polypeptides into functional three-dimensional configurations permitting activity at low temperatures. Future characterization of some of

these chaperones could reveal what kinds of folding are
required to retain protein function at sub-zero temperatures. Ferrer et al. [26] found that GroEL of Oleispira
antartica RB8 functioned as a single ring of 7 units at cold
temperatures, but as a double ring of 7 over 7 at warm
temperatures. They pinpointed two residues as critical to
the transition from double to single ring. However on
inspection these residues do not occur at the comparable
positions in P. ingrahamii GroEL proteins. Actions of P.
ingrahamii chaperones at cold temperatures remain to be
explored.
P. ingrahamii has genes for a variety of known types of
stress proteins: There are 12 cold shock proteins, 9 heat
shock proteins, 7 UspA-type stress proteins as well as 9
"tellurite resistance" proteins now known to protect
against superoxide formation [27] (Table 9). Experimental work will be needed to determine which if any of these
have functions directed specifically at living in cold temperatures and if there are other types of stress proteins or
any other cold-associated functions among the open reading frames of unknown function.
Transporters
Compared to E. coli, P. ingrahamii has few transporters
specific for sugars and sugar alcohols, but does have many
transporters for amino acids (see Additional file 2). In this
respect, it seems that P. ingrahamii is like S. oneidensis and
other Alteromondales in a capacity to utilize environmental
amino acids as carbon (and nitrogen) sources, contrasted
to less capacity for sugars.

Stress proteins

As to types of transporters, the ABC type of ATP-driven
multisubunit transporter is most common in the P. ingrahamii genome, as is the case for other bacteria. Also, as for
many other bacteria, conventional secondary transporters
follow in frequency. However, P. ingrahamii differs from
many in the fact that in there are 11 sets of the dctM, dctP
and dctQ genes for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter systems (TRAP) [28,29] (Table 10),
more than are found in the three mesophiles whose whole
genomes were compared (E. coli, S. oneidensis and V. cholerae). TRAP systems specialize in transport of C4-dicarboxylic organic acids such as fumarate, perhaps for
anaerobic respiration purposes. The number of 3-gene
TRAP systems in bacteria is variable. E. coli has one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has 6 whereas P. ingrahamii has 11 of
these three-protein systems. Recently 15 TRAP systems
have been identified in Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 [30].
TRAP transporters use a proton motive force energized
system, simpler and possibly more primitive than the
ATP-utilizing ABC systems. A connection between the
TRAP transporters and low temperature growth is not currently known.
Regulators
Many types of regulation mechanisms have been identified in P. ingrahamii: transcriptional activators and repressors, cyclic-AMP regulation, chemotaxis systems, twocomponent sensor-response regulators of several types
including the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway
signal sequence domain proteins, also synthesis/breakdown of cyclic-diGMP signalling second messengers associated with GGDEF and/or EAL domains (see Additional
file 2). There are 61 regulators of the cyclic-diGMP signal-

ling second messenger in the genome, compared to 29 in
E. coli K-12 MG1655. Cyclic-diGMP concentrations are
controlled by either a diguanylate cyclase or a specific
phosphodiesterase or both, together governing synthesis
or hydrolysis of the cyclic-GMP. The types of genes and
corresponding physiology regulated by cyclic diguanylate
systems so far identified are motility, adhesion factors,
fimbriae and biofilm formation.
Given the finding of a large number of cyclic-diGMP signalling systems, we might guess that P. ingrahamii lives
within the matrix of a biofilm. Altogether 16 glycosyl
transferases are encoded (by genes 326, 327, 328, 329,

and 3647), suggesting that polysaccharide, perhaps
exopolysaccharide, is a major synthetic product. For
export, many efflux proteins are present. An ortholog is
present (1200) of the quorum sensing HapR (LuxR) regulator that is involved in controlling biofilm formation in
V. cholerae [31,32]. An extracellular matrix, a major physiological feature of the related S. oneidensis [33], could
well be important to life in the cold, providing stability
and resilience to the population. Since P. ingrahamii lives
in sea ice, it is possible that extracellular polysaccharide
(EPS) may be part of the sea ice microbial community
(SIMCO) biofilm although it should be noted that P. ingrahamii was isolated from the ice column above the major
biofilm of the SIMCO.
Alternatively, the production of EPS may serve a role in
sequestering water from ambient saltwater at lower temperatures or actually lowering the freezing point. In this
regard it is interesting to note that in the -12°C growth
experiments, none of the tubes froze after the first week of
growth following inoculation suggesting that a product,
possibly EPS, produced by the bacterium may have lowered the freezing point of the growth medium.
Regulation of expression of certain classes of genes is
moderated by the sigma factors of the RNA polymerase
holoenzyme. P. ingrahamii is well endowed, appearing to
have genes for sigma factors 24 (RpoE), 32 (RpoH), 38
(RpoS), 54 (RpoN) and 70(RpoD) [gene numbers are,
respectively, 65, 626, 677, (424, 712, 2892 and 3175 for
sigma-54) and (310, 946 and 995 for sigma-70)]. RpoE
and RpoH are both stress-responding factors. RpoS operates in stationary phase and also under stress. RpoN is
concerned with nitrogen metabolism and in V. cholerae
regulates flagellin gene transcription. RpoD for sigma 70
is the primary factor in E. coli.
Ribosomes
There are 58 ribosomal proteins annotated, 5 of which are
duplicated, therefore 53 unique. Of these, 38 were found
as orthologs with Pam values less than 40 among the two
sets of genomes we examined. Organisms with closest
matches were, in descending order, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, S. oneidensis, H. influenzae = I. loihiensis, C.
psychrerythraea. Again, the close relationship of P. ingrahamii with Vibrio species is evident.
Osmotic stability
P. ingrahamii grows well over the range 1 to 12% NaCl
[25]. To manage the potential for osmotic imbalance, the
genes for enzymes to synthesize the osmolyte glycine
betaine from choline are present (genes 2071, 2072), as
well as a transporter to take up choline (gene 969) or,
bypassing synthesis, specific ABC transport systems for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/210

uptake of glycine betaine are present, (genes 614–616,
2073–2075). This capability may explain how the organism is able to survive and perhaps grow in the salt pockets
that are formed within the sea ice.
Motility
There is a large cluster of flagellar genes in P. ingrahamii in
the region between gene numbers 3562 to 3598 and four
copies of sigma factor rpoN which is known in V. cholerae
to regulate flagellin genes. Yet the bacteria in culture have
been observed to be non-motile [8]. There may be a defect
in one of the essential flagellar proteins or in the expression or assembly processes. Alternatively, the organism
may not always express flagella formation and motility.
Interestingly, the original description of the genus indicates that other members of the genus are motile [34].
Gas vesicles
Two kinds of gas vesicles have been observed in the cell
under culture (24). Genes orthologous to known gas vesicle genes are present in two clusters, the ranges 1248 to
1262 and 1748 and 1750. Although the two types can be
expressed simultaneously in cells, they may be differentially expressed under preferential conditions in the environment.
Different kinds of enzyme orthologs in different bacterial relatives
Of the 53 bacteria chosen to represent the breadth of the
currently characterized eubacterial world, the three bacteria bearing the largest number of protein sequences scored
as "best matches" with P. ingrahamii proteins are V. cholerae, S. oneidensis and C. psychrerythraea 34H (Table 3).

About 3/4 of the P. ingrahamii proteins annotated as
enzymes, transporters or regulators have orthologs at the
level of Pam <= 125 in either V. cholerae, S. oneidensis or C.
psychroerythraea. By contrast, only 19% of P. ingrahamii
CDSs of unknown function have orthologs in these bacteria. That the vast majority, 4/5, of P. ingrahamii CDSs of
unknown function do not have good matches in the most
closely related organisms suggests that many proteins in
P. ingrahamii are qualitatively different. New, unique
functions will not be revealed by annotations that depend
on similarity to known proteins, but their existence suggests that further experimental study of this extremophile
is worthwhile and could bring new biology to light.
Looking within the enzyme category, it is striking that
most of the best hit homologs of enzymes of central
metabolism are proteins of V. cholerae. This is particularly
puzzling since V. cholerae is a mesophile and it is phylogenetically in a different Order and Family from P. ingrahamii. Could this be an example of massive horizontal
transfer of genes from Vibrio to Psychromonas? It seems
unlikely since the many genes for central metabolism are

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:210

not in a few clusters similar to pathogenicity islands,
rather they map throughout the chromosome, and the
majority of the transposase-type genes have closest
orthologs in S. oneidensis. Nevertheless, in spite of expectations, we have found that the sequences of enzymes of
basic metabolism that function at low temperature are
more similar to those of a mesophile than they are to
those of another psychrophile, and even more surprising,
a mesophile of a different taxonomic Order and Family. A
feature that may suggest global genome reorganization
and account for an apparent scrambling of otherwise conserved genes is that the Vibrios usually comprise two chromosomes, in contrast to P. ingrahamii which has only one.
Different from V. cholerae, one sees that enzyme
homologs in S. oneidensis and C. psychrerythraea 34H are
largely the enzymes of peripheral and macromolecule
metabolism, not the enzymes of central metabolism.
We narrowed our question, looking for a commonality in
enzymes among the psychrophiles. We identified the 566
proteins in C. psychrerythraea and I. hoiliensis that have
highest similarity to P. ingrahamii proteins at Pam values
=< 125. In this set, there are few enzymes important to
central metabolism; many more are involved in macromolecule synthesis and maintenance. There are enzymes
dealing with nucleic acids: exo and endo-nucleases, RNA
helicases, DNA polymerase and helicases, transcriptional
and translational factors, and recombinases. Psychrophily
may require differences in the proteins of nucleic acid
metabolism since even though the salt content of the sea
ice and the low GC content of the DNA (40.1%) should
act to lower the melting point of double stranded polynucleotides. However, handling nucleic acid structures at
such cold temperatures may also require differences in the
interacting proteins. Similarly, transcription and translation factors of a particular kind may be required to enable
the processes at low temperatures.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/210

through 1676, 1960 through 1964, and 2315 through
2319. Could any or all of these relate to the ability to live
and grow at -12C or lower temperatures? We identify
these seemingly unique sets of proteins with the thought
that when results of proteomic expression experiments on
this organism are available, it might be useful to characterize the proteins and to know under what circumstances
they are synthesized.

Conclusion
The P. ingrahamii genome, although it is 25% smaller than
the genome of E. coli K-12 MG1655 and has many more
CDSs labeled hypothetical, is similar to E. coli in the distribution of functions among annotated proteins, with
enzymes by far the largest category followed by transporters, then regulators. Other categories follow distantly.
Similar to E. coli, the largest paralogous groups within the
genome were transporters and regulators, the smaller ones
enzymes. Although transporters and regulators are fewer
in number than enzymes, they form larger paralogous
groups. They belong to fewer families employing fewer
mechanisms than is the case for enzymes which belong to
smaller families of greater variety.
Unexpectedly, P. ingrahamii protein sequences were similar to more V. cholerae proteins than to proteins from S.
oneidensis or C. psychrerythraea. This is in spite of the fact
that Vibrio species belong to a different Family and Order
than do Psychromonadaceae, Shewanellaceae and Collwelliaceae, and in spite of the fact that C. psychrerythraea is
also a psychrophile.
In a comparison of gross properties of all the proteins of
P. ingrahamii differences were not found from those of
three mesophiles in several respects: distribution of
lengths, total amino acid composition, codon usage when
corrected for genomic GC content.

Unique unknown proteins
We identified a few small groups of proteins that could
perform novel functions related to psychrophily, warranting further investigation in the future. A contiguous set of
nine genes that could comprise an operon, gene numbers
3053 through 3061 have no orthologs in current databases with Pam value <150. Four of the proteins are paralogous, with similar sequences among themselves. As we
are looking for functions in psychrophiles not found in
other bacteria, experimental characterization of this group
of proteins might be worthwhile.

However, correspondence analysis (CA) of the amino acid
content of the proteins showed that they cluster in ways
that differ from most other bacteria, falling into more
clusters that are not as well separated from one another as
in other bacteria. This may be a consequence of an unusual distribution of hydrophobicity. One of the clusters is
composed almost half of unidentified, unknown CDSs. P.
ingrahamii contains proteins with relatively high asparagine content, and low content of amino acids potentially
sensitive to the higher concentration of oxygn present in
cold waters. These properties would seem to be appropriate for an extreme psychrophile.

There are 3 groups of genes that could be contiguous operons whose members reside either in cluster 4 of the Correspondence Analysis (vide supra), or are unknown in
other bacteria to date, or both. These are clusters 1672

As to metabolism, P. ingrahamii is a facultative anaerobe
capable of both fermentation and respiration. In agreement, proteins similar to the corresponding metabolic
pathways and proteins for synthesis and harvest of glyco-

gen storage compound were identified. Most enzymes of
central small molecule metabolism were most closely
related to those of V. cholerae. Enzymes of macromolecular synthesis and maintenance are most closely related to
those of S. oneidensis and C. psychrerythraea. There seems
to be a preference of amino acids over sugars as sources of
carbon and energy, perhaps harvested by extracellular
degradation of environmental proteins by exported peptidases. To create a more flexible lipid layer adjusted to cold
temperatures, sequences of a heteropolymeric polyunsaturase were found. However, the enzyme may not always
be active as no polyunsaturated fatty acids were detected
in culture. Perhaps, however, in nature they are expressed
at temperatures lower than the lowest normally used for
laboratory cultivation, 6–8°C.
In addition to transporters of types common to other proteobacteria were 11 three-component TRAP systems for
C4-dicarboxylic acid transport. In addition to regulators
of types common to other proteobacteria were 61 regulators of cyclic-diGMP second messengers, suggesting that
biofilms and their regulation could be an important part
of the life style of this psychrophile. Alternatively, P. ingrahamii may produce EPS to lower the freezing point in
the surrounding environment, thereby making water
available for low temperature growth.
Looking for particular proteins that might be unique to
this psychrophile but are not yet in the genomic databases
we searched, we have pointed out some sets of gene products that could be starting points for discovering new
functions or new types of proteins. We noticed 9 contiguous genes that are all unknown hypotheticals, 4 of them
sequence-related to one another. We also noted three
apparent contiguous operons, members of which are
unknown hypotheticals and/or members of the unique
set of proteins in cluster 4. In future, we recommend that
proteomic experiments should be used to explore the shift
to cold temperature with a view of keeping an eye out for
expression of any of these proteins, potentially part of the
mechanisms of life at very cold temperatures.

Methods
Genome sequencing and finishing
The genome of Psychromonas ingrahamii was sequenced at
the Joint Genome Institute Lawrence Laboratories, Walnut Creek, CA using a combination of (4 kb, 6.8 kb and
36 kb) DNA libraries. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed can be found on line
[35]. Draft assemblies were based on 53473 total reads.
All three libraries provided 11X coverage of the genome.
For closing and finishing, the Phred/Phrap/Consed software package [36,37] was used for sequence assembly and
quality assessment [38,39]. After the shotgun stage, 53473
reads were assembled with parallel phrap (High Perform-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/210

ance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with Dupfinisher [41] or transposon bombing of
bridging clones (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison,
WI). Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in
Consed, custom primer walks, or PCR amplification. A
total of 952 primer walk reactions and 3 transposon
bombs were necessary to close gaps, to resolve repetitive
regions, and to raise the quality of the finished sequence.
The completed genome sequences of Psychromonas ingrahamii contain 53,592 reads, achieving an average of 11fold sequence coverage per base with an error rate less
than 1 in 100,000. The sequence of P. ingrahamii can be
accessed using the GenBank accession number
CP000510.1.
Annotation
Annotation was initially carried out at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory using methods detailed in [41,42]. Further
annotation and analysis of protein sequence similarities
used the Darwin system (Data Analysis and Retrieval With
Indexed Nucleotide/peptide sequence package), version
2.0, developed at the ETHZ in Zurich, Switzerland
[16,22]. Pairwise sequence alignments and scores were
generated using the AllAllDb program of Darwin. Maximum likelihood alignments are generated with an initial
global alignment by dynamic programming (Smith and
Waterman algorithm) followed by dynamic local alignments (Needleman and Wunsch algorithm). A single scoring matrix is used for these steps. After the initial
alignment, the scoring matrix is adjusted to fit the approximate distance between each protein pair to produce the
minimum Pam value. Pam units are defined as the numbers of point mutations (base pair differences) per 100
residues [17]. The Darwin system's ability to apply scoring
matrices according to the distance between each protein
pair ensures a data set of highly accurate similarity calculations for distantly as well as closely related protein pairs.
The identification of distantly related proteins is valuable
in finding divergent but related protein functions.

To extract homolog matches from initial data, we required
that the alignments with P. ingrahamii proteins be at least
83 residues long [43], and that the alignment must represent over 40% of both proteins. Unless otherwise stated
we required Pam scores to be 150 or less. To assemble
groups of paralogs, the Pam threshold for pairs was raised
to 250, and then pairs were grouped by a transitive process as previously described [23].
Correspondence Analysis
The amino acid composition of the proteins of P. ingrahamii was analyzed using correspondence analysis (CA)
[12-14] with the FactoMineR R package [44]. Each protein
was truncated for the first 10 and last 5 amino acid residues and each is represented by its normalized aminoacid

content. The representation is in a 19-dimension space
where specific statistical distances are measured by the
chi-square method. The 3 most informative dimensions
are used to plot the position of each individual protein.
The individual amino acid distributions are superimposed in this same space. The axes are numbered in order
of the amount of information they carry. A bayseian
method, as in Bailly-Bechet et al. [41], was used to cluster
proteins of similar composition using the Mclust R package [45], and the best classification, which is associated
with the largest BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
value, was selected for further analysis.
Codon usage and selection bias were determined by
methods of Sharp et al. [9].
