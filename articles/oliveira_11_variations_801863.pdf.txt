Variations on a theme: diversification of cuticular
hydrocarbons in a clade of cactophilic Drosophila

Abstract
Background: We characterized variation and chemical composition of epicuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in the
seven species of the Drosophila buzzatii cluster with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Despite the critical
role of CHCs in providing resistance to desiccation and involvement in communication, such as courtship behavior,
mating, and aggregation, few studies have investigated how CHC profiles evolve within and between species in a
phylogenetic context. We analyzed quantitative differences in CHC profiles in populations of the D. buzzatii species
cluster in order to assess the concordance of CHC differentiation with species divergence.
Results: Thirty-six CHC components were scored in single fly extracts with carbon chain lengths ranging from C29
to C39, including methyl-branched alkanes, n-alkenes, and alkadienes. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that
CHC amounts were significantly different among all species and canonical discriminant function (CDF) analysis
resolved all species into distinct, non-overlapping groups. Significant intraspecific variation was found in different
populations of D. serido suggesting that this taxon is comprised of at least two species. We summarized CHC
variation using CDF analysis and mapped the first five CHC canonical variates (CVs) onto an independently derived
period (per) gene + chromosome inversion + mtDNA COI gene for each sex. We found that the COI sequences
were not phylogenetically informative due to introgression between some species, so only per + inversion data
were used. Positive phylogenetic signal was observed mainly for CV1 when parsimony methods and the test for
serial independence (TFSI) were used. These results changed when no outgroup species were included in the
analysis and phylogenetic signal was then observed for female CV3 and/or CV4 and male CV4 and CV5. Finally,
removal of divergent populations of D. serido significantly increased the amount of phylogenetic signal as up to
four out of five CVs then displayed positive phylogenetic signal.
Conclusions: CHCs were conserved among species while quantitative differences in CHC profiles between
populations and species were statistically significant. Most CHCs were species-, population-, and sex-specific.
Mapping CHCs onto an independently derived phylogeny revealed that a significant portion of CHC variation was
explained by species’ systematic affinities indicating phylogenetic conservatism in the evolution of these
hydrocarbon arrays, presumptive waterproofing compounds and courtship signals as in many other drosophilid
species.

Background
The nested hierarchical nature of species due to shared
ancestry has been useful in comparative biology to assess
relative rates of phenotypic evolution [1]. In a comprehensive comparative study, Blomberg et al. [2] showed
that behavioral traits were more labile (weakly or uncorrelated with phylogeny) than body size, morphological,

life-history, or physiological characters. Conversely,
Wimberger and de Queiroz [3] found no significant difference in evolutionary lability between morphological
and behavioral traits. Therefore, relative evolutionary
rates of morphological and physiological vs. behavioral
traits is still being debated [4,5], and resolution may
depend on the kinds of traits studied and the degree of
phylogenetic resolution of focal species groups.
Among arthropods, common species-specific phenotypes that influence organismal water balance and also
serve as contact pheromones, particularly in insects, are

cuticular waxes composed of hydrocarbons [6-12]. In
Drosophila, epicuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) components
are usually sex-specific, species-specific and sometimes
geographically variable [7,13-18]. These molecules are
integral to the waterproofing functions of the insect cuticle, providing resistance to desiccation and water loss
[19-21]. Despite the involvement of CHCs with cuticular
water flux, mate recognition, and in some cases reproductive isolation, little is known about the mechanisms
responsible for their larger scale diversification because
few studies have investigated how correlated CHC differences evolve in a phylogenetic context [reviewed in [22]].
Further, the nature of CHC variation can be both qualitative and quantitative [7,13,23]: CHC composition can be
dynamic and change with age [24,25], is influenced by
temperature [24], larval-rearing substrates [26,27], and
members of the opposite sex [28-31] suggesting significant sources of variation that may inhibit attempts to
map their evolution onto species/population phylogenies.
Using groups of populations/species in various stages of
divergence is essential if we are to gauge rates of evolution across a spectrum of genetic differences including
the final stages of speciation [32]. This way, we can
gauge which phenotypes evolve before others, and
attempt to identify causal factors responsible for divergence and perhaps the formation of new species [33].
Phylogeny of the D. buzzatii Cluster

We analyzed evolution of quantitative differences in
CHC profiles in a recently diverged species group of
Drosophila, the D. buzzatii cluster, in order to assess
phylogenetic influences on these species-specific epicuticular hydrocarbons. This monophyletic group of cactophilic Drosophila has been previously characterized in
terms of its biogeography and ecology [reviewed in
[34]]. The D. buzzatii cluster is part of the mulleri complex in the large D. repleta group, and consists of seven
closely related species including D. buzzatii [35], D. serido, D. borborema [36], D. koepferae [37], D. seriema
[38], D. antonietae, and D. gouveai [39]. Except for cosmopolitan D. buzzatii, the other species are endemic to
South America with most distributed in and around
Brazil (Figure 1). All of these species are cryptic, where
species can only be identified morphologically using
male genital characteristics [39].
Monophyly of the D. buzzatii cluster was first proposed on the basis of multiple chromosomal inversions
[40], with four inversions unique to different species
[41]. Despite being reliable phylogenetic markers
[42,43], chromosomal inversions cannot resolve the relationships among some of these species, i.e. D. borborema, D. gouveai and D. seriema, as no inversions are
unique to these taxa (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis of
mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences

Page 2 of 19

confirmed that these seven species form a monophyletic
group [44,45]. However, within the cluster, not all populations of the same species were recovered in the same
clade or shared the closest branches in the tree. While a
mtDNA COI phylogeny partially agreed with the chromosome phylogeny, haplotype sharing among populations was observed suggesting secondary contact
between D. antonietae and D. gouveai [34,44] making
these COI data less than informative for character mapping. Recently, Franco et al. [46] proposed a phylogeny
for the cluster based on the nuclear period (per) gene.
This phylogeny also confirmed that the D. buzzatii cluster forms a monophyletic group and also resolved the
relationships among populations of all species including
D. gouveai, D. borborema and D. seriema.
Ecology and Biogeography of the D. buzzatii Cluster

All species of the D. buzzatii cluster are cactophilic so
their ranges are associated with the distributions of their
host plants (Figure 2). D. buzzatii cluster species feed
and breed exclusively in necrotic cactus tissues (rots)
[41,47] and some species are oligophagic, while others
appear to be more specialized (Figure 2). These species
are distributed throughout the caatinga and Chaco morphoclimatic domains along a corridor of arid xeromorphic vegetation extending from the northeast to the
southwest between the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests of South America. Adjacent dry forests also include
cacti, but as isolated populations. These isolates are
thought to have resulted from repeated retractions and
expansions of open vegetation during the Quaternary
glacial and interglacial periods, respectively, affecting the
differentiation and speciation of D. buzzatii cluster species [34,44]. Nested clade analysis of Brazilian D. buzzatii cluster species suggested that these species have been
distributed across Brazil at least since the Mid-Pleistocene [48]. It is likely that these climatic alterations have
promoted repeated waxing and waning of cactus populations in Brazil and elsewhere in South America.
Thus, the phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology of the
D. buzzatii cluster should help us to understand phenotypic evolution among populations of these recently
diverged species, some that can still hybridize in nature,
and how sexually dimorphic and typically species-specific CHCs have evolved in these species. Therefore, we
characterized the variation and chemical composition of
CHCs in all seven species in the cluster so that we
could uncover the role these compounds may play in
desiccation resistance and as recognition signals within
and between species. By mapping CHC variation onto a
phylogeny of these species, we show that correlated
groups of CHCs show discordant patterns of evolution
with some CHCs showing significant phylogenetic signal
and others evolving more rapidly.

eighteen populations/species used in the CHC analysis (see Table 1).

Methods
Origin and Maintenance of Fly Stocks

All populations and species were collected in the wild
using fruit baits (Figure 1, Table 1) and were maintained
in the Departamento de Genética, Universidade de São
Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil at ± 25°C on a 12:12 h LD

cycle on cornmeal-yeast-agar food. All emerging adults
were collected from zero to two days after eclosion
from each culture bottle, separated by sex using CO 2
anesthesia, and placed into separate vials. Flies were
aged at least 10 days before use to ensure sexual maturity. In all experiments, fly age ranged from 10 to 16

affiliations for each species. Male genitalia (aedeagus) types (A - E) for the species of the D. buzzatii cluster are labeled according to Silva and
Sene [105]. D. buzzatii and D. borborema were not included in that classification because both species have aedeagi that were already well
characterized and could be easily distinguishable from the other species. Chromosomal inversions, shown above the tree branches, are based on
Ruiz et al. [41,53] and used together with period gene data to reconstruct the phylogeny (see Figures 5 and 6). Host plant use and geographic
distributions are based on Manfrin and Sene [34], Benado et al. [106], Marín et al. [107] and Vilela [108].

D. seriema

All 18 populations were used for CHC quantification. One population of each species, indicated by an asterisk (*), was used for CHC characterization by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). Thirteen out of 18 populations had data available for both per gene and CHCs and were used for phylogenetic
reconstruction (shown as underlined). Except for D. koepferae from Argentina, all other populations were collected in Brazil.

days. All procedures, experiments, and CHC extractions
requiring live flies were carried out in the Sene-Manfrin
laboratory in Ribeirão Preto because current Brazilian
regulations prohibit exporting these species. CHC quantification was performed at the University of Arkansas
and CHC characterization by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GCMS) was carried out at Montana State
University. Despite observations that rearing substrates
can influence CHC profiles [17,26], it was not possible
to assess CHC variation with cactus-reared flies as host
plant-microbe relationships necessary to culture all of
these species on fermenting cactus tissues are not well
studied. As all flies were cultured under common
laboratory conditions, CHC variation should reflect
population, sex, and species differences.
Chemical Analysis of CHCs

One population of each species (Table 1) was used to
identify epicuticular hydrocarbon components in males
and females. The most abundant CHCs were characterized by GCMS following Etges and Jackson [7]. In short,
hundreds of adults of each species were separated by
sex, allowed to mature, and then rinsed with HPLC
grade hexane in Biosil™ mini-columns. Extracts were
dried at 40°C under a stream of nitrogen and sealed/
stored at -20°C. Each extract was analyzed with a Hewlett Packard 5890 GC fitted with a 12-m HP-1 fused
silica column programmed at 150°C to 300°C at 10°C/
min and held at 300°C for 5 min. The injector and
detector temperature (Hewlett Packard 5971 mass selective detector) was 280°C. Extracts were redissolved in
hexane containing 100 ng/fly of docosane (C 22 ) as an
internal standard. The unsaturated CHCs were derivatized with dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and the resulting
thiomethyl derivatives were analyzed by GCMS to identify the positions of the double bonds [24].
CHC Variation among Populations and Species

Eighteen populations, including at least one geographical
stock of each species, were used to quantify variation in
male and female CHCs. Preliminary CHC classification
was determined by comparing the retention times of
each observed CHC component from the D. buzzatii
cluster species with those of the D. mojavensis cluster
[7]. In all cases, the retention times of most of the
major CHCs were very similar to those of D. mojavensis
indicating a remarkable degree of CHC conservation
among these distantly related species groups. Ten aged,
virgin adult flies for each sex of 18 different populations
(Table 1) were individually immersed in HPLC hexane
for 10 minutes with agitation, dried at 40°C, stored at
-20°C, and returned to the University of Arkansas. Each
extract was redissolved in 5 μl heptane containing 360
ng of docosane (C22) as an internal standard [26]. One

Page 5 of 19

μl of sample was analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography in an automated Shimadzu GC-17H High
Speed FID/GC fitted with an AOC-20i autosampler
(Shimadzu Scientific, Columbia, MD). Injector and
detector temperatures were set to 345°C with the injector port in split mode. Running temperatures started at
200°C and increased to 345°C at 10°C/min, with a hold
at 345°C for 7 min [49].
Statistical Analyses

CHC amounts were estimated by analysis of peak integrations using Class VP 4.2 software provided by Shimadzu. Each sample amount was normalized by the
measured amount of docosane and all data were
expressed as nanograms per fly of CHCs. We quantified
amounts of 36 peaks in each sample after eliminating 18
peaks with areas that accounted for less than 1% of the
total hydrocarbon abundance in at least one fly in all
populations. All data were assessed for normality with
PROC UNIVARIATE using SAS 9.1 [50] and log 10
transformations improved normality. Nested multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess CHC variation among species and populations nested within
species were considered random effects. The main
effects in the model included species, sex and population nested within species and the interactions were species × sex and × population nested within species.
Five canonical discriminant function (CDF) analyses
(PROC CANDISC) were performed to summarize CHC
variation along continuous scales representing orthogonal axes of CHC covariation that best separated populations/species and to help visualize group differences.
Out of the 36 peaks scored, 15 minor peaks were eliminated prior to the CDF analyses due to missing values.
Consequently, a total of 21 peaks were used in the five
different CDF analyses performed. First, we carried out
a CDF analysis using all data, i.e. 18 populations/species
(Table 1) to explore the overall magnitude of CHC differentiation in our data. This procedure was followed by
a linear discriminant function analysis (PROC DISCRIM) using the same dataset to classify individuals
based on species, population and sex. Second, we performed a CDF analysis without the four populations of
D. serido, i.e. 14 populations/species, due to large, unanticipated intraspecific CHC variation in this species (see
results). Third, we used CDF analysis to generate CVs
for character mapping, i.e. for those populations used in
the phylogenetic reconstruction (see description below).
Thirteen out of 18 populations from which data was
available for both per gene and CHCs were used in the
character evolution analysis. In this third analysis,
besides the 13 populations/species of the D. buzzatii
cluster we also included the three species of the D.
mojavensis cluster. We did not pool the sexes (as in the

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:179
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/179

first and second CDF analyses) because we were interested in sex-specific CHC evolution. We performed the
CDF analysis with females and males together so that
male and female species-specific CDF scores could be
compared on a common scale, but separated the data by
sex to evaluate CHC evolution in the character reconstruction analyses. Finally, a fourth and fifth CDF analyses were also used in character mapping and were
similar to the third analysis, except that in the fourth
analysis we did not include the species of the D. mojavensis cluster and in the fifth analysis the D. serido
populations were excluded. For all five CDF analyses,
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between
individual CHC amounts and canonical scores for each
CHC for the first five CVs with PROC CORR to determine which CHC peaks were significantly associated
with these canonical variates. Lastly, we conducted stepwise discriminant analyses (PROC STEPDISC) for each
of the five datasets used in the CDF analyses to evaluate
which CHC peaks most contributed to the variation
between populations.
Mantel Tests

We were also interested in whether geographic distance
between populations distributed over such a large area
(Figure 1) might explain some of the interspecific variation in CHCs due to factors like ambient ecological differences, sexual selection, or genetic drift. Our null
hypothesis was that geographic distance measured in
kilometers should be unrelated to overall CHC differences between populations. We performed Mantel tests
using Manteller software [51] and compared female and
male CHC matrices based on Euclidean distances with a
geographic distance matrix of 18 populations/species.
Pair-wise, great circle distances between populations
were calculated using the “Haversine” formula [52].
Phylogenetic Reconstruction

Originally, we combined chromosomal inversion differences [41,53] with the per gene [46] and mtDNA COI
sequence data [44] to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships for the seven D. buzzatii cluster species. Chromosome inversions have high phylogenetic utility in
Drosophila [42], but because only four inversions are
unique and thus phylogenetically informative in the D.
buzzatii species cluster (Figure 2), populations of the
same species were all coded with the same inversions.
For all species, inversions were coded as present (1) or
absent (0). Although the phylogeny based on COI
sequences did not recover all populations of the same
species in the same clade [44], we thought the mtDNA
data could still be useful in combination with chromosomal inversions and the per gene. However, the phylogeny produced by combining all three data sets was

Page 6 of 19

clearly driven by the COI sequence data (Additional File
1: Figure S1). We followed Santos et al. [54] in concluding that these mtDNA COI data did not provide clear
phylogenetic relationships for these species, either alone
or when combined with nuclear markers. Thus, only per
+ inversion data were used in the phylogenetic
reconstruction.
We only used populations/species from the D. buzzatii
cluster from which per gene and CHC data were available (13 out of 18 populations) since the reconstructed
phylogeny was used later to study CHC evolution (see
below). Populations used in the per phylogeny [46] are
indicated in Table 1. We also included two species used
as outgroups by Franco et al. [46], i.e. D. mojavensis and
D. hydei. Because no CHC data were available for D.
hydei this species was removed before the tree was used
for reconstruction of CHC evolution. The published per
sequences were aligned using Mega version 4 [55]. Phylogenetic analysis of the per gene + chromosomal inversion data was performed using PAUP* 4.0 [56].
Maximum parsimony was used to search for optimal
tree(s) and heuristic searches were carried out with 100
random addition analyses and tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Nodal support was
obtained using bootstrap analysis (1,000 replicates).
Mapping CHCs onto the Phylogeny

Patterns of character evolution were inferred by mapping CHC canonical variates (CVs) (See Statistical Analyses) onto the reconstructed phylogeny using Mesquite
2.6 [57]. The CVs were mapped onto the first out of six
most parsimonious trees instead of the strict consensus
tree because one of the models used, Squared Change
Parsimony Gradual (see below), relies on branch length
information. Besides D. mojavensis, we also added the
other two species of the D. mojavensis cluster, D. arizonae and D. navojoa, as a sister group to the D. buzzatii
cluster. We included the D. mojavensis cluster in the
analysis because its phylogeny is well established [58,59],
CHC data were available [7], and we were interested in
its evolution as well. Because the number of species
used in the phylogeny can influence the detection of
phylogenetic signal [2] where higher numbers of species
(17 - 20) can increase the power of the analysis, adding
these species is justified and should help to avoid type II
error, i.e. failure of rejecting the null hypothesis of no
phylogenetic signal when in reality there was a significant relationship between CHC profiles and the
phylogeny. We also performed two other character
reconstruction analyses: one with just the populations/
species of the D. buzzatii cluster and another without
the populations of D. serido. In the former analysis we
wanted to assess patterns of character evolution without
the effects of outgroup species and in the latter analysis

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:179
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/179

without the influence of these highly divergent
populations.
Because reconstruction methods have different
assumptions, they can lead to different reconstructions
of ancestral states [60-62] and also influence the detection of phylogenetic signal. Therefore, we decided to
employ three different parsimony methods, i.e. Linear
Parsimony (LP), Squared Change Parsimony Gradual
(SCPG), and Squared Change Parsimony Punctuated
(SCPP) to determine whether they would yield different
results. LP algorithms minimize the sum of the absolute
values of changes on the branches of the tree [63]. The
LP method does not use branch length information and
assumes stabilizing selection as the model of evolutionary change [60]. Both SCPG and SCPP algorithms [64]
minimize the sum of the squared changes on the
branches of the tree. The SCPG method calculates
squared changes based on branch lengths from the
reconstructed tree assuming a Brownian motion model,
i.e. steady gradual change (SCPG). Conversely, SCPP
produces squared changes based on all branches lengths
set to one with equal rates of evolution along each
branch to simulate a model of punctuated evolution,
where changes occur at speciation events [60,65,66].
We assessed congruence between the CHC canonical
variates and the phylogeny (reference tree) by testing for
the degree of phylogenetic signal revealed by these parsimony methods. Our null hypothesis was that non-phylogenetic influences such as developmental noise,
ecological effects such as rearing conditions, or speciesspecific sexual selection have shaped CHC profiles such
that CHC evolution was independent of species evolution. Our alternative hypothesis was that significant phylogenetic signal should be observed due to the
phylogenetic affinities of these populations and so CHC
variation should be correlated with species evolution.
Evidence for phylogenetic signal in our data was evaluated in all three parsimony reconstruction algorithms by
randomly modifying the reference tree, i.e. reshuffling
the terminal taxa 10,000 times to generate a population
of random trees for each character (female and male
CVs). These trees with reshuffled taxa were then compared with the reference tree to test whether CHC distributions were more conserved than expected by
chance alone. We concluded that there was phylogenetic
signal if the number of parsimony character steps in the
reference tree was less than in 95% of the trees with
reshuffled taxa, i.e. values that fell on the extreme left of
the distribution had fewer changes than expected by
chance (Additional File 2: Figure S2). Alternatively, if
CHC variation among closely related species was less
than expected given their phylogenetic affinities, i.e., if
the mean parsimony character steps for the reference
tree fell on the extreme right of the reshuffled

Page 7 of 19

distribution, we interpreted this outcome as a result of
more CHC differentiation than expected by chance
alone [see [67] for details].
The detection of phylogenetic signal was also examined with the test for serial independence (TFSI),
described in Abouheif [68], and available in the program
Phylogenetic Independence 2.0 [69]. We decided to use
TFSI as an alternative to the parsimony models because
it does not assume a model of evolutionary change or
require branch lengths. While this can be problematic
because topology alone cannot provide all information
about species similarity [2], it can be a strength if the
branch lengths or model of evolutionary change are not
known or accurate [68]. Furthermore, parsimony results
can be misleading if the model of evolutionary change
differs significantly from gradual change, i.e. when rates
of evolution are rapid and/or rates of gains and losses
are not equal [60,62]. For all three parsimony methods
and TFSI, p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons via false discovery rate (FDR) analysis [70,71].

Results
Chemical Composition of CHCs

All seven species and both sexes in the D. buzzatii cluster had CHCs with carbon chain lengths ranging from
C29 to C39 (Additional File 3: Figure S3). The CHCs of
adult flies were composed of three structural classes:
mono-methyl-branched alkanes, n-alkenes, and alkadienes (Table 2). Mono-methyl-branched alkanes comprised both the C28.65 and C30.65 peaks. The former had
the same composition for all species and both sexes (i.e.
2-methyloctacosane), while the latter varied among species, composed of either a mono-methyl-branched
alkane (2-methyltriacontane) or n-alkenes [(Z)-5-hentriacontene or (Z)-9-hentriacontene]. In fact, C30.65 was
one of the four peaks showing qualitative differences
between sexes, i.e., C30.65 was composed of 2-methyltriacontane in D. gouveai ♂, D. seriema ♀ and D. koepferae
♀, but composed of (Z)-9-hentriacontene in D. gouveai
♀, D. seriema ♂ and D. koepferae ♂. Peaks C 37 and
C36.5 were also sexually dimorphic, but results were only
available for D. gouveai (Table 2).
All other observed peaks were composed of either
monoenes or dienes. Several peaks were comprised of
mixtures of positional monoene isomers (Table 2) where
the location of double bonds was mainly at even-numbered carbons (e.g. (Z)-8-tritriacontene and (Z)-10-pentatriacontene). Alkadienes were also present in more
than one positional isomer, but the double bonds were
located mostly at odd-numbered carbons (e.g. (Z, Z)7,25-tritriacontadiene and (Z, Z)-5,25-pentatriacontadiene). The composition of some peaks was not determined because these samples proved difficult to
derivatize with DMDS.

Quantitative Variation in CHC Profiles

Quantitative variation in CHCs was much more prominent than chemical differences between species. CHC
variation due to sex, species, and population and all
interactions were significant (Table 3). Out of the 36

peaks analyzed, 12 major peaks accounted for ca 85% of
the total hydrocarbons for all 18 populations/sexes analyzed (Additional File 4: Table S1). Mean total hydrocarbon amount per fly was 878.68 ng ± 21.71 ( X ± 1 SE).

species were significant (P < 0.0001), as were differences
among populations (Wilks l = 0.0000, F = 57.11, P <
0.0001). MANOVA revealed significant species and
population specific sexual dimorphism revealed by a
species × sex interaction term (30/36 peaks) and sex ×
population nested within species term (27/36 peaks)
(results not shown). Thus, sexual dimorphism in CHC
profiles was a significant source of variation in populations of all seven species. Linear discriminant function
analysis based on 18 populations/species correctly
assigned 98.2% and 96.6% of individuals (out of 298
total) to their correspondent populations and species,
respectively. The classification based on sex correctly
assigned 76% and 80% of females and males, respectively. Therefore, CHC variation in the D. buzzatii cluster was largely species-, population-, and sex-specific.
The first five canonical variates from the CDF analysis
for all 18 populations/species accounted for 94% of the
total hydrocarbon variation (Additional File 5: Table S2)
and grouped populations of the same species together
except for D. serido populations that were highly divergent and showed large discordance with the other populations/species (Figure 3A). The first canonical variate
(CV1) was largely influenced by the divergence among
D. serido populations. All four populations of D. serido
differed significantly in CHC composition, and three of
these populations were more different from each other
than most of the other species (Figure 3A). D. serido
populations from Mucuri, Bahia and Arraial do Cabo,
Rio de Janeiro (Figure 1) clustered together but were
isolated from all other populations/species. The Milagres, Bahia population of D. serido was the most divergent population in the analysis and was completely
isolated from all other populations/species including the
other D. serido populations. The fourth population of D.
serido, from Macaé, Rio de Janeiro, had CHC profiles
similar to those of D. buzzatti populations (Figure 3A).
Therefore, we suspected that the Macaé population was
contaminated with D. buzzatii in lab culture because
this population was collected less than 100 km away
from Arraial do Cabo (populations 14 and 15, Figure 1,
Table 1), and it is unlikely that these two populations
would be so different in CHC profiles. The second

canonical variate (CV2) separated populations of the
same species, but was still dominated by the striking differences caused by the D. serido populations. Since D.
serido was apparently causing so much of the overall
CHC variation and obscuring the differences between
the other species, we performed a second CDF analysis
excluding all four D. serido populations (Additional File
6: Table S3). We observed not only reduced total variation in this analysis (see axis range in Figure 3B) but
also a clearer separation of the species (CV1) and populations of the same species (CV2). Overall, the striking
degree of intraspecific CHC variation found in D. serido
populations suggests the presence of at least two cryptic
“D. serido“ lineages.
We also attempted to identify which CHCs were
responsible for these striking population/species differences. First, we used stepwise discriminant function analysis with both forward and reverse variable entry to
identify which of the 21 CHC peaks was/were driving
the differences among populations. All but one of the
21 CHC components were significantly correlated with
the discriminant function, P < 0.0001, with partial correlations of 0.149 to 0.905 (Additional File 7: Table S4).
Next, we sequentially deleted individual peaks and performed additional CDF analyses in an attempt to identify which CHCs caused the large differences due to D.
serido (Figure 3A). We started by removing the C30.83
component, a CHC with one of the largest partial correlations with the discriminant function (Additional File 7:
Table S4) that was found in significantly higher amounts
in D. serido populations from Mucuri and Arraial do
Cabo (Figure 4), but was absent or in negligible amounts
in all other populations/species (Additional File 4: Table
S1). Removal of the C 30.83 peak did not eliminate the
large D. serido population differences so we deleted
another large component, C32.47, which resulted in eliminating most of the CHC differences that separated D.
serido from Milagres, Bahia from the other species
(results not shown). Thus, there were population-specific CHCs that seemed to be driving these extraordinary
intraspecific differences in CHCs, but the general pattern of CHC differentiation between these populations
involved quantitative variation in most of the CHCs
scored. Results of the Mantel tests [51] assessing associations between CHC differentiation among populations/species and geographic distance were not
significant (females: r = - 0.049, P = 0.596; males: r = 0.078, P = 0.784).
Phylogenetic Reconstruction and CHC Character Mapping

The parsimony analysis resulted in six equally most parsimonious per gene + chromosome inversion trees
(Additional File 8: Figure S4) of 166 steps (CI = 0.82;
RI = 0.76). The strict consensus tree (Figure 5)

produced a well-resolved phylogeny that clustered all
populations/species of the D. buzzatii cluster together
(bootstrap value 99%). We decided to use the first out
of six most parsimonious trees for character mapping
because this tree was the one that closest resembled the
strict consensus tree. In fact, all six parsimony trees had
very similar topologies (Additional File 8: Figure S4).
Tree 1 and tree 2 had the same topology except
that tree 2 had a polytomy in the clade containing

populations of D. gouveai. Since polytomies had to be
resolved prior to performing the character reconstruction analyses, these two trees were equivalent for character mapping. Trees 3 and 4 also had the same order
of taxa observed for trees 1 and 2 and differed from
them only in the arrangement of internal branches.
Trees 5 and 6 differed from the first four trees by clustering D. serido populations in the same clade containing the D. buzzatii populations and D. koepferae rather
than in a separate clade.
In the reconstructed phylogeny based on the populations/species of the D. buzzatii cluster plus the D. mojavensis cluster, significant phylogenetic signal was
observed for female CV1 (Table 4) when linear parsimony (LP) (Additional File 2: Figure S2), squared
change parsimony punctuated (SCPP) and the test of
serial independence (TFSI) were used, but no correlation
was observed when squared change parsimony gradual
(SCPG) was used. For male CV1, all four methods
yielded significant phylogenetic signal (Table 4). Female
CV2 displayed significant phylogenetic signal only with
TFSI and female and male CV5 were significant only
with LP method. For CV2, CV3, and CV4, no concordance between CHC profiles and the phylogeny was
detected with any of the three parsimony methods.
Similar results were obtained with TFSI, except for

The reconstructed phylogeny used in the character evolution analysis represents the first out of six most parsimonious trees and was based on 13 populations/
species of the D. buzzatii cluster (see Table 1) plus three species of the D. mojavensis cluster. CDF analysis was based on 21 CHC peaks to generate the canonical
variates (CVs). Three different parsimony methods were used in Mesquite [57]: linear parsimony (LP), squared-change parsimony assuming a gradual model of
evolution (SCPG), and squared-change parsimony with a punctuated model of evolution (SCPP). In all three models, presence of phylogenetic signal for each
character (i.e. female and male CVs) was assessed by comparing the mean parsimony character steps from the reference tree (as shown on Figure 6) with those
of a population of random trees. Terminal taxa were reshuffled 10,000 times to generate the random trees. Phylogenetic signal was positive when the mean
parsimony character steps for the reference tree were significantly smaller than the mean parsimony character steps for the random trees. See Additional File 2:
Figure S2 for details. The detection of phylogenetic signal was also examined with the test for serial independence (TFSI) run with 1,000 replicates using the
program Phylogenetic Independence 2.0 [69]. P-values in bold represent significant values after false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. See Additional File 12: Table
S8 for FDR calculations.

female CV2, which was positive for phylogenetic signal
(Table 4). Figure 6A, B and 6C shows the first three
female and male CVs mapped onto the phylogeny using
the LP method. For CV1, the CHCs of the D. mojavensis
cluster clearly differed from those of the D. buzzatii
cluster (Figure 6A). Within the D. buzzatii cluster,
female D. buzzatii and D. koepferae had very similar
CHC profiles that were not shared among the other species, except for D. borborema. For males, D. buzzatii
and D. koepferae also had similar profiles, but this similarity was also shared with other taxa, mainly with D.
antonietae populations and D. serido from Arraial do
Cabo. The most differentiated population in terms of
CHCs was D. serido from Milagres, Bahia (Figure 3A
and 4). No phylogenetic signal was observed for CV2
and CV3 as indicated by the somewhat random distributions of CHC profiles across the tree (Figure 6B, C). For
CV2, another D. serido population from Arraial do
Cabo, Rio de Janeiro had the most divergent CHC profile (Figure 6B) whereas for CV3, D. borborema from
Morro do Chapéu, Bahia was the most divergent group
(Figure 6C). The influence of sex on CHC variation was
diminished because we included male and female CHC
data for each population/species to generate common
canonical variables all on the same CDF scales.

In order to dissect these patterns of covariation
further, we evaluated the loadings of each CHC on the
canonical variates. Almost all individual CHCs were significantly correlated with each of the first five CVs
(Table 5). For CV1, all CHC peaks significantly contributed to the variation, except for C32.56, but three CHCs
with the highest loadings, C33br3, C32.47, and C35ene3 and
to a lesser extent two C 35 components, C 35ene3 and
C 34.66 , best discriminated among these populations.
Only two of these components, C32.47 and C34.66, represented significant proportions of total CHCs or were
“major peaks” in these species suggesting that even relatively “minor” CHC components were responsible for
these species differences that resulted in the detection of
phylogenetic signal in CHC differentiation and evolution. Similar results were observed for CV2, CV3, CV4,
and CV5, where most of the CHC components were significantly correlated with the CVs. When sex was considered as a variable in the model, the percentage of the
variance explained by the first five CVs increased from
72% to 81% (results not shown), with the highest difference found in CV1, from 17% to 22%.
Because presence of phylogenetic signal, especially for
CV1, seemed to be related to CHC differences between
both clusters, we performed an analysis without the D.

Figure 6 A - C. Phylogenetic character mapping using the linear parsimony model with the first three canonical variates (CV1-CV3)
based on female and male CHCs. Both sexes were analyzed together in the same CDF analysis to avoid scale effects but female and male
canonical variates (CVs) were mapped separately onto the reconstructed phylogeny (see left and right trees). This phylogeny represents a most
parsimonious tree (one of six trees) of the populations/species of the D. buzzatii cluster inferred from chromosomal inversions [41] and the
period gene [49]. One of the outgroup taxa, D. hydei, was removed prior to the character state reconstruction because no CHC data was
available for this species. The other two species of the D. mojavensis cluster, D. arizonae and D. navojoa, were added to the analysis. Bootstrap
values (shown above the nodes) were based on 1,000 replicates and 100 random additions. Only bootstrap values above 50% are shown.
Bootstrap support for species of D. mojavensis cluster was based on Durando et al. [58].

mojavensis cluster in order to test whether phylogenetic
signal would be present in the D. buzzatii cluster only.
In the absence of D. mojavensis cluster, CV1 did not
display positive phylogenetic signal (Additional File 9:
Table S5). However, positive phylogenetic signal was
detected for female CV3 and/or CV4 and male CV4 and
CV5 (Additional File 9: Table S5) illustrating that positive phylogenetic signal for different covarying groups of
CHCs was present in the D. buzzatii cluster even in the
absence of an outgroup.
Because D. serido populations exhibited such high
within-species CHC divergence (Figure 3A, B), we also
considered the possibility that D. serido CHCs may have
influenced the character mapping results. To test this
hypothesis, we repeated the CDF analysis (Additional
File 10: Table S6) and reconstructed the phylogeny without the two D. serido populations. In the absence of D.
serido, male and female CV1 displayed positive phylogenetic signal with all four methods. However, as mentioned above, presence of phylogenetic signal for CV1

Discussion
Comparative analysis of quantitative variation in CHC
profiles of the D. buzzatii species cluster revealed that
CHC evolution has been somewhat conserved and associated with the evolutionary divergence of these species.
Thus, CHC differentiation among these populations has
not evolved so quickly as to erase evidence of phylogenetic affinity suggesting that variation in CHCs in this
group of Drosophila can be predicted, to some extent,
by species ancestry. Here, a key observation was the
degree of CHC chemical conservation between the D.
buzzatii and D. mojavensis clusters (Table 2) where
most molecular structures, retention times, and carbon
chainlengths were conserved, but species-specific CHC
amounts varied quantitatively. The D. mojavensis cluster
is also part of the mulleri complex, but is endemic to
North America [59,72,73]. As these species groups are
restricted to different continents and diverged ca 10-15
mya [74,75], CHC biosynthesis and expression have
been conserved over a large portion of the D. repleta
group phylogeny. The most conserved chemical
compounds were 2-methyloctacosane (2-MeC 28 ) and
2-methyltriacontane (2-MeC30). These two compounds
are not only shared within and between both clusters
but are also found in a variety of other insect species
[76]. In retrospect, such conserved CHCs may not be
surprising, but few attempts have been made to assess
broad-scale variation in CHCs in groups of related species. Thus, CHC evolution in these D. repleta group
species has a significant phylogenetic component based
on a core group of C 29 , C 31 , C 33 , C 35 , C 37 and C 39
hydrocarbons (Additional File 3: Figure S3) with additional species and population-specific variations on this
theme.
The multiple functional roles for insect cuticular
hydrocarbons has been appreciated for some time [77].
In arthropods with longer chain length CHCs (>20 carbon atoms), effects of desiccation are reduced because
longer CHCs have higher melting temperatures [78,79],
consistent with observations that xeric adapted Drosophila species exhibit longer chain length CHCs than
mesic species [80]. Although saturated compounds,
n-alkanes, provide increased protection against desiccation, branched and unsaturated compounds decrease

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:179
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/179

melting temperatures and can cause increased rates of
water loss across insect epicuticles [78]. In Drosophila,
alkenes and alkadienes have pheromonal activity in a
number of species [14,81-84]. In experimental populations of D. melanogaster that responded to increased
desiccation conditions, CHC differences did evolve, but
there were no associated changes in sexual isolation suggesting that CHCs involved in desiccation resistance
were different from those used for mate choice [85]. In
other insects like paper wasps [86] and honeybees [87],
branched alkanes and/or alkenes are more easily identified by other individuals than linear alkanes and therefore serve as recognition cues while n-alkanes function
primarily to reduce water loss. Given the conservation
of CHC compounds in the desert-adapted D. buzzatii
and D. mojavensis species groups, significant sexual
dimorphism in CHC profiles (Table 3), and the presence
of branched and unsaturated molecules in the CHCs of
all of these species, we expect that D. buzzatii cluster
CHCs serve as both physiological mechanisms to control transcuticular water flux as well as in chemical
communication, i.e. mate recognition. Nevertheless, the
role of CHCs as pheromones has yet to be confirmed in
the D. buzzatii cluster. Preliminary results revealed
undetectable pheromonal activity in CHC perfuming
experiments with D. seriema and D. buzzatii even
though significant amounts of CHCs were transferred
between males (Oliveira et. al., unpubl. data). However,
we initially chose these species for perfuming studies
because of the ability to detect CHC transfers. This
result may not be representative of other, more closely
related species in the cluster because D. seriema and D.
buzzatii were so reproductively divergent (in mate
choice trials, Oliveira et. al., unpubl. data) that alterations in CHCs had little effect despite the significant
CHC differences between them. Further perfuming trials
with all D. buzzatii cluster species are clearly needed.
The detection of positive phylogenetic signal using the
three different data sets: (1) D. buzzatii + D. mojavensis
cluster; (2) D. buzzatii cluster; and (3) D. buzzatii cluster (without D. serido populations) + D. mojavensis cluster (Table 4, Additional Files 9 and 11, respectively)
supports the hypothesis that phylogenetic signal was
strong enough to be detected by different methods independent of their assumptions. Moreover, positive phylogenetic signal was observed when just the D. buzzatii
cluster species were used supporting that some CHCs
were conserved in the cluster. These results were even
more robust when the divergent D. serido populations
were removed from the analysis. We hypothesize that
CVs that were weakly correlated with the phylogeny,
mainly CV2, were influenced by CHCs that may be
responding to the ambient environment or other forces,
i.e. these are traits involved in mate recognition like

Page 15 of 19

courtship songs, pheromones, or coloration that should
evolve more rapidly due to sexual or stabilizing selection
[88-91].
Contrasting results have been reported regarding the
presence of phylogenetic signal in studies of character
evolution that have implicated CHCs and other volatile
compounds in mate and/or species recognition. For
example, Jallon and David [13] concluded that “Hydrocarbon variations do not match the phylogeny” in eight
species of the D. melanogaster group. Symonds and
Elgar [92] reported little association between aggregation
pheromone composition and phylogenetic relationships
in bark beetles since closely related species were as different, if not more so, than more distantly related species. Conversely, Symonds and Wertheim [93] found
that more closely related Drosophila species had more
chemically similar aggregation pheromones and concluded that there was a positive relationship between
phylogenetic distance and pheromone differentiation.
Cuticular hydrocarbons in pine engraver beetles have
been used to identify different species and thus have
systematic value [94]. Some phylogenetic trends in species-specific CHCs were also reported in Hawaiian
swordtail crickets [11]. However, known phylogenetic
relationships among 78 ant species in five subfamilies
showed “no similarity” to cuticular hydrocarbon differences based on chemical structures [95]. Male courtship
songs were homoplasic in the Drosophila willistoni species complex [88], showed evidence of diversification,
character loss, and reversal in the D. repleta group [33],
and converged in green lacewings [96]. In birds, sexually
selected traits like male plumage and bower characters
exhibited low phylogenetic signal [97,98], while male
songs were more conserved [99]. We suggest that phylogenetic diversification of insect CHCs may be more
conservative than courtship songs or avian plumage
characteristics because the complex underlying biochemical and physiological machinery required to
synthesize and express CHCs in arthropods [9,100,101]
may be more conserved than in other traits. Thus, similarity in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles among species
may represent a phylogenetic constraint due to their
mode of production. Certainly, more comparative studies involving mating signals will be necessary to determine whether the presence of phylogenetic signal is a
rule or an exception for pheromonal or behavioral traits.
Evolution of the D. buzzatii cluster and CHCs

Attempts to resolve a phylogeny using the mtDNA data
[44] failed to resolve all species into individual evolutionary lineages. Specifically, D. gouveai, D. serido, and
D. seriema show substantial geographic variation and
considerable phylogenetic incongruence (Additional
File 1: Figure S1). Incomplete lineage sorting or

Oliveira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:179
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/179

hybridization could be responsible, as well as natural
selection on mtDNA function [102]. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the nuclear period (per) gene by
Franco et al. [46] resolved the relationships among D.
gouveai, D. borborema and D. seriema (Figure 5).
Although per grouped populations of D. serido together,
they were not placed as a sister taxa of D. antonietae, as
predicted by chromosomal inversion data (Figure 2).
Therefore, the position of “D. serido“ has yet to be
resolved.
The large and very significant intraspecific differences
in D. serido CHCs (Figure 3A) does not suggest a gradual model of CHC evolution, but were consistent with
previously described differentiation between populations
that inhabit northeastern Brazil in the caatinga (e.g.
Milagres, Bahia) and those from the east coast of Brazil
(e.g. Mucuri, Bahia and Arraial do Cabo, Rio de Janeiro,
see Figure 1). The observation that the CHCs of the
coastal D. serido population from Macaé, Rio de Janeiro
did not match this pattern of differentiation further suggests that this stock was contaminated (see results for
details). Here, the scale of intraspecific CHC variation
was greater than interspecific variation for the remaining
six species, and included multiple CHC components
(Figure 4). Genetic divergence between populations of
D. serido in these regions includes mtDNA haplotype
differentiation [44], cytological differences, amounts of
heterochromatin in metaphase chromosomes [103], and
frequency differences of polymorphic inversions
[41,104]. These observations together with our results
showing large intraspecific CHC differences strongly
suggest the presence of several more cryptic species in
this group.

Conclusions
The evolution of phenotypes and how they are shaped
by phylogenetic history is a long-standing issue [1]. Our
comparative approach revealed that CHC compounds
were highly conserved among species. Quantitative differences in CHC profiles were more prominent yet
CHCs were species-, population-, and sex-specific. The
evolution of CHCs was not homogeneous as some peaks
were more conserved and retained phylogenetic signal
while others seemed to be evolving faster. Comparative
approaches to understanding phenotypes such as CHCs
with multiple functions and courtship songs in Drosophila have provided some insight into the patterns of
trait evolution for phenotypes likely associated with
mating success and reproductive isolation, as well as the
challenges of xeric environments caused by desiccation
and cuticular water loss. For understanding of CHC evolution, future analyses of multiple phenotypes in such
groups will be necessary to evaluate whether CHC
components influence water balance and/or have

Page 16 of 19

pheromonal activity and to determine how the type and
quantity of these compounds evolve during the diversification of populations and species.
