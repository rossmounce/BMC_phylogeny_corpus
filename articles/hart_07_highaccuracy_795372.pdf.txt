Abstract
Background: Identifying all protein complexes in an organism is a major goal of systems biology.
In the past 18 months, the results of two genome-scale tandem affinity purification-mass
spectrometry (TAP-MS) assays in yeast have been published, along with corresponding complex
maps. For most complexes, the published data sets were surprisingly uncorrelated. It is therefore
useful to consider the raw data from each study and generate an accurate complex map from a
high-confidence data set that integrates the results of these and earlier assays.
Results: Using an unsupervised probabilistic scoring scheme, we assigned a confidence score to
each interaction in the matrix-model interpretation of the large-scale yeast mass-spectrometry
data sets. The scoring metric proved more accurate than the filtering schemes used in the original
data sets. We then took a high-confidence subset of these interactions and derived a set of
complexes using MCL. The complexes show high correlation with existing annotations.
Hierarchical organization of some protein complexes is evident from inter-complex interactions.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that our scoring method can generate an integrated highconfidence subset of observed matrix-model interactions, which we subsequently used to derive
an accurate map of yeast complexes. Our results indicate that essentiality is a product of the
protein complex rather than the individual protein, and that we have achieved near saturation of
the yeast high-abundance, rich-media-expressed "complex-ome."

Background
The molecular machines that carry out basic cellular processes are typically not individual proteins but protein
complexes. Even in the relatively simple model organism
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most machines that process and
store biological information are in fact large protein complexes comprised of many subunits.
The path from measuring protein interactions to defining
complexes has been well studied. Experimental and com-

putational methods have provided over 50,000 putative
yeast protein-protein interactions to date, although a substantial fraction of these may be spurious[1,2]. An array of
analytical methods aimed at generating high-quality complexes from these data have been applied, including both
unsupervised [3-5] and trained [6,7] techniques. Other
genomic and proteomic data sets, such as gene expression,
knockout phenotype, subcellular localization, and genetic
interaction profiles, and phylogenetic profiles [5,6,8-10],
have also been integrated with the raw interaction data in

an effort to broaden and deepen our ability to accurately
define protein complexes.
Two recent genome-scale tandem affinity purification/
mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) experiments perfomed by
Gavin et al. [11] and Krogan et al. [12], have produced an
enormous amount of new data, allowing a more complete
analysis of the universe of yeast protein complexes. However, the complex maps published independently by the
two groups show a surprising lack of correlation, which
can only be partially explained by the different analytical
methods applied after generating the raw data [1,13].
TAP-MS data typically consist of a tagged "bait" protein
and the associated "prey" proteins that co-purify with the
bait. Interaction data sets are generated from this raw data
using either the spoke method, which considers bait-prey
interactions, or the matrix method, which includes all
prey-prey interactions from a given bait pull-down [14].
As the affinity purification process generally isolates stable
complexes, there is no clear-cut way to differentiate
between direct physical interactions and indirect interactions mediated by other members of the complex – or, for
that matter, other proteins that appear simply a result of
experimental noise. Thus, the spoke model contains both
direct physical interactions and a sampling of the indirect
interactions within a complex, plus some amount of
noise, while the matrix model captures a much larger
number of true indirect interactions at the price of
decreased accuracy from linking every spurious protein to
every "real" one, as well as linking proteins from heterogeneous complexes that each contain the bait. While
some efforts have been made to use a filtered subset of
matrix-model interactions to improve accuracy [9,15,16],
analysis of mass spectrometry interaction data has typically been carried out using the spoke model [3,5].
Here we offer a simple yet robust statistical scoring
scheme for assigning confidence to observed interactions.
The scheme is based on comparing observed versus
expected numbers of interactions in the matrix model of
protein-protein interactions, and provides greatly
increased recall and/or precision over the standard spoke
model interpretation. A further advantage of the system is
that it can be used to integrate data sets from different
sources. We use the scoring scheme to combine the Gavin
et al. [11], Krogan et al. [12], and Ho et al. [17] co-complex
data sets and define a high-quality subset comprised of
1689 proteins in 390 complexes. We further show that
essential proteins strongly cluster together, supporting a
complex-centric rather than gene-centric basis for essentiality for a large fraction of essential genes.

Results
In a large-scale interaction assay, we consider each protein's interactions to be a random sample from the population of observed interactions. A simple and general
theoretical error model, based on the hypergeometric distribution, can be used to calculate the probability of
observing each interaction from a random background.
This model builds on related models that have previously
been applied to several linkage and interaction types [1821]. Within a given dataset, the probability (P-value) of an
interaction between proteins A and B being observed at
random is:
min(n,m)

p(# interactions ≥ k | n, m, N) =

∑

p(i | n, m, N)

i =k

where

 n  N − n 
 

 i  m − i 
p(i | n, m, N) =
N
 
m
where k = the number of times the interaction between A
and B is observed, n and m are the total number of interactions for proteins A and B, and N is the total number of
interactions observed in the entire data set. When applied
to the matrix model interpretation of protein interactions,
the scoring scheme can identify highly accurate subsets of
interactions. The process is illustrated in Figure 1.
We generated matrix-model interpretations of the Ho,
Gavin, and Krogan datasets. The only other TAP-MS data
set of significant scale [22] is a subset of [11] and was
omitted. We then applied the scoring method to each,
applying to each interaction in a dataset a P-value calculated from the observations within that set. We then evaluated the quality of the scoring by calculating recall and
precision versus the set of protein complexes manually
defined from literature sources by the Munich Information center on Protein Sequences (MIPS) [23]. Recall was
scored as TP/(TP + FN), where TP, true positives, are experimental interactions that are in the MIPS set and FN, false
negatives, are the MIPS interactions not present in the
experimental data. Precision was defined as TP/(TP + FP),
where TP is as above and FP, false positives, are interactions observed experimentally where both corresponding
proteins are in the MIPS set, but the interaction is not. For
all three data sets, the method displays improved recall
and/or precision relative not only to the spoke model
interpretation of the same dataset, but also to the group's
published complexes (Figure 2). As each co-complex data
set represents an independent experimental observation,
the probabilities can be combined to provide higher conPage 2 of 11

Applying1the matrix-model scoring algorithm
Applying the matrix-model scoring algorithm. The four subunits of the DNA primase core complex are detected using
the scoring algorithm. (A) In the Gavin et al. TAP-MS data set, Pol1 and Pol12 were purified as bait and their corresponding
bait-prey, spoke model interactions are shown in blue (plus number of additional prey identified shown in parentheses). In the
Krogan et al. assay (shown in orange), the same baits plus Pri1 were purified. (B) In the matrix model, both bait-prey and preyprey interactions are considered. Within a given dataset, the total number of links observed between each pair of proteins is
recorded and the P-value calculated as described in the text. The PICO network was generated by multiplying P-values for the
same interaction derived from different data sets, e.g. Pol1–Pol12 is discovered in both Gavin and Krogan and scored accordingly. (C) The PICO network integrates probability scores from all data sources, here represented as -ln(P-value). Values in
black are final PICO scores; separate scores from Gavin et al. (blue) and Krogan et al. (orange) are shown where applicable. No
data from Ho et al. was relevant to this example.

fidence in repeated observations. We therefore combined
the three scored data sets by multiplying the P-values for
a given interaction across all three datasets, applying a Pvalue of 1 if the interaction was missing from a dataset.
The combined interaction dataset, which we call the Probabilistic Integrated Co-complex (PICO) network, is more
accurate and provides greater coverage than any of the
individual datasets it comprises.
The PICO network contains a large number (~160,000) of
protein-protein interactions, each with a relative confidence measure as described by the P-value. The full list is
available for download [see Additional File 1]. We filtered
out low-confidence interactions before deriving complexes from the data, beginning by rank-ordering the
interactions by P-value, lowest to highest. We then
applied a series of increasingly stringent expected (E)
n

value thresholds, where E = ∑ Pi , starting with E = 1 and
i =1

tightening in order of magnitude increments to E = 10-6.
The number of interactions in the PICO network at each
threshold is shown in Figure 3A.
We derived a set of complexes at each threshold by using
MCL [24], an implementation of a Markov clustering
algorithm. MCL was evaluated in [25] and was used to
derive complexes from the raw data in [12]. To evaluate

the accuracy of each set of complexes, we measured the
Hubert statistic, H, of the derived complexes versus a reference set of complexes [26]. Briefly, calculating H
involves generating a matrix M of protein pairs (i, j) where
M(i, j) = 1 if the proteins are in the same complex and 0
otherwise. The correlation between the experimental and
reference matrices is then measured, resulting in a score
from -1 to 1, with 1 implying identical complex assignments and values near zero indicating random assignment. We measured the Hubert statistic of complexes
measured at each threshold against the set of curated
MIPS complexes [23] with ribosomal subunits removed
and against a filtered set of Gene Ontology (GO) Cellular
Component (CC) annotations (see Methods). The correlations generally improve with increasing stringency (Figure 3B), although the rate of increase in correlation with
GO component drops off sharply after the 10-2 cutoff. This
improvement in accuracy comes at the price of decreasing
coverage, reflected in the decreasing number of interactions at each threshold as shown in Figure 3A. In an
attempt to balance accuracy and coverage, we selected the
complexes derived from the E = 10-2 threshold, hereafter
called the E-2 complexes, for further study.
Features of the E-2 complexes
The E-2 complexes contain 1689 proteins grouped into
390 clusters of sizes ranging from two to 35 subunits. A
network view of the complexes, generated using Cytoscape [27], is shown in Figure 4; the Cytoscape file is avail-

Performance curves of the probabilistic scoring method
Performance curves of the probabilistic scoring
method. We measured the performance of the various
datasets against a reference set consisting of a matrix-model
interaction set generated from MIPS curated complexes,
excluding the large and small ribosomal subunits (which
would otherwise account for over half of the interactions in
this set). Single points represent an entire dataset. Curves
represent a dataset that has been scored using the hypergeometric scoring algorithm, rank ordered, and plotted with
each symbol representing the cumulative addition of the 500
next highest scoring interactions (i.e. tail of the curve represents the entire dataset). The scoring scheme outperforms
the raw data as well as the filtered, published sets in all cases;
the integrated PICO net outperforms the individual scored
data sets, and the derived complexes are slightly more accurate than PICO (for all thresholds; data not shown).
able for download [see Additional File 2]. To measure the
accuracy of individual complexes, we tested each for significant enrichment of GO component annotation. GO
component annotations enriched at P <0.01 (with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing) are noted
for each complex [see Additional File 3]. The Simpson
coefficient of each enriched annotation is also listed as an
easily understood metric for measuring the completeness
with which any GO term describes a complex (or vice
versa).
The large fraction of E-2 complexes that correspond to
existing annotations suggest that the data set is highly
accurate. Of the 132 complexes with four or more subunits, 69% (91) are highly enriched for one or more specific GO component annotations; of the 44 complexes of
size eight or larger, 84% (37) are so annotated. Furthermore, there are virtually no uncharacterized genes in these
large complexes, and the few that appear have relatively
weak connections to the other members of their respective
clusters. This suggests that the yeast community has
achieved a fairly complete description of a large fraction

accuracy thresholds on network size and derived complex
Effect of3
Effect of thresholds on network size and derived
complex accuracy. (A) Interactions in the PICO network
were rank ordered, and the E-value was calculated as the
sum of P-values. The number of interactions at each E-value
threshold was counted; the total decreases as an increasingly
stringent threshold is applied. (B) At each E-value threshold,
the subset of interactions was clustered with MCL with
parameters that optimized correlation with the filtered set of
GO component annotations [see Methods]. The correlation
with GO component (filled circles) and MIPS complexes
(hollow circles) generally improves with the stringency of the
E-value cutoff. We judged that the 10-2 cutoff provides a reasonable tradeoff between increasing accuracy and decreasing
coverage, and chose this subset for further study.

of the "complex-ome," at least for complexes containing
many proteins. In fact, only one complex of size four or
greater consists entirely of unnamed subunits and thus
could be considered truly novel (complex C132, composed of proteins YAL049C, YDL025C, YGR016W, and
YHR009C).
Several E-2 clusters represent amalgamations of known
complexes. The MCL algorithm assigns each protein to
exactly one complex, so protein complexes with shared

A subset of the E-2 complex map
A subset of the E-2 complex map. After applying the E = 10-2 threshold to the PICO interaction set, the subset of 5,352
interactions was clustered with MCL, using parameters that maximized correlation with a filtered set of GO component annotations. Interactions within clusters (4,411) were plotted with Cytoscape using the included "organic" layout algorithm. Interactions between clusters (941) were omitted for clarity.

subunits are sometimes found combined into a single
cluster in the E-2 complexes. The C1 cluster, for example,
includes RNA polymerase I, II, and III, largely because all
three enzymes contain the Rpb5, Rpb8, Rpb10, and
Rpo26 subunits. Likewise, complex C7 contains the
TAFIID complex and the SAGA transcription factor/chromatin remodeling complex; these complexes share the
Taf5, 6, 9, 10, and 12 proteins. It seems clear from the
RNA polymerase case that the E-2 clusters occasionally
contain discrete complexes that presumably do not physically interact.
Even the clusters that lack significant GO terms tend to
have subunits that share similar free-text descriptions in
the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) [28]. For
example, complex C44 contains eight proteins, all of
which are essential. Of these, seven are explicitly
described in SGD as being involved in 60 S ribosome biogenesis or as components of 66 S pre-ribosomal particles,

and the eighth is involved in export of pre-ribosomal large
subunits from the nucleus. No GO term enrichment is
found because the CC annotation is typically "nucleolus,"
a weak term excluded from our analysis (see Methods).
Likewise, unannotated complexes C20, C30, and C78
contain 13, 10, and 5 proteins, respectively (10, 9, and 5
essential), that are all known or suspected to be involved
in ribosome biogenesis. Other unannotated complexes
include C43, eight largely nonessential proteins in the
well-described cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase group;
C51, seven nonessential proteins involved in catabolite
inactivation of FBPase; and C72, six proteins (five essential), of which five are involved in retrograde Golgi-to-ER
trafficking and the sixth, Sec39, is of unknown function
but "proposed to be involved in protein secretion."

which the E-2 complexes were derived contains 5,352

Inter-complex interactions
Inter-complex interactions. Interactions in the E-2 complex map represent 4,411 of the 5,352 interactions in the PICO
network at the E = 10-2 threshold. The 941 remaining protein-protein interactions (PPI) collapse to 248 complex-complex
interactions. Here we map 128 inter-complex interactions, each comprising two or more protein-protein interactions (821 PPI
total); singletons are omitted for clarity. Nodes represent E-2 complexes: yellow indicates >70% essential subunits; labels indicate highest-scoring GO component, where applicable. Edge thickness reflects number of interactions between complex subunits, ranging from two (thinnest) to 24 or more (thickest) PPI; number of interactions is shown on each edge. Density of PPI
between complexes of similar function (e.g. 190 PPI from U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP complex to neighbors; 86 PPI between C20/
C30/C44/C78 ribosome biogenesis modules; 64 PPI linking C17 histone-associated complex to neighbors; shaded in blue) illustrates hierarchical nature of yeast complex network.

interactions; of these, 4,411 are present in the E-2 complex map of 390 complexes. The remaining 941 interactions all occur between subunits of different complexes.
We examined the structure of these interactions by collapsing each complex into a single node and looking at
the interactions between complexes. The resulting intercomplex network, depicted in Figure 5, suggests a hierarchical organization of protein complexes in the cell. Over
one-third of the interactions (341, or 36%) appear in just
three clusters: the U4/U6 × U5 tri-snRNP complex and its
neighbors (191 interactions), the C20/C30/C44/C78
ribosome biogenesis nexus (86 interactions), and the C17
histone-associated complex (64 interactions). In all three
cases, the intercomplex interactions link complexes that
are involved in closely related physiological processes.
Taken together, these observations suggest that yeast proteins complexes exhibit a hierarchical organization, with
complexes interacting with each other in a well-ordered
fashion.
Essentiality of protein complexes
The E-2 network shows an enrichment of essential genes
in general: the 1689 proteins in the network comprise
29% of all yeast proteins, but contain 58% of all essential
proteins (602 essentials out of 1033 total). The descriptions above, as well as a glance at the complex map in Figure 4, suggests concentration of essential proteins into
some complexes, and exclusion from others (see Additional file 4). To measure whether there is such a concentration, we considered the distribution of complexes with
respect to the fraction of essential proteins in each and
sorted this distribution into ten uniformly spaced bins.
We bootstrapped a background distribution by randomly
assigning the same number of essential genes to an identical set of complexes, repeating this process 10,000 times,
and calculating the mean for each bin. We then took the
log of the ratio of the observed to the random frequencies
in each bin. The results, plotted in Figure 6, show clear
enrichment for complexes either mostly essential (>70%)
or almost completely nonessential (<10%), with underrepresentation in intermediate values.

Discussion
Modular nature of essentiality
The concentration of essential proteins into complexes
suggests that essentiality is, in many cases, a product of
complex function rather than individual protein function.
This phenomenon has been observed by the Barabasi
group [5] in an analysis of Ho and Gavin 2002[22]. In
using the raw data from these assays, the prior study
assigns each bait pull-down to a discrete complex and
does not correct for sampling the same complex with multiple baits. Thus, for example, purifications derived from
TAP-tagged Nsp1, Nup60, Nup82, and Nup116 are all
considered to be discrete complexes with a high fraction

Essential6proteins are concentrated in a subset of complexes
Essential proteins are concentrated in a subset of
complexes. The distribution of essential proteins in complexes was compared to a randomized background. The fraction of essential proteins in each complex was calculated,
sorted into equal-sized bins, and compared to an expected
background generated by randomly assigning essential proteins to the same set of complexes. The log ratio of observed
to expected frequency for each bin is plotted here: positive
values indicate observed frequency above random; negatives
indicate below random. The distribution illustrates the concentration of essential proteins in some complexes, and a
corresponding absence of essentials in others. Bars marked

of essential proteins, while in reality these factors are all
constituents of the same nuclear pore complex.
The current analysis provides both more accurate definition of complexes and, owing to the breadth of the raw
data, greater coverage of yeast proteins. The corresponding signal for essentiality of complexes becomes very
strong. In the E2 complex set, there are 64 complexes with
>70% essential subunits, containing 330 essential out of
379 total proteins – accounting for 32% of all essential
genes in yeast. Of these complexes, the 35 largest contain
271 essential proteins (of 320 total), or 26% of all essential genes (Table 1). Other complexes that show strong
essentiality include C2, which corresponds to the 26 S
proteasome complex. The complex is 58% essential but
the diagram of the cluster reveals that it has a number of
loosely connected proteins that are not annotated as proteasomal. The 24 core subunits in the diagram are 71%
essential. Also, the previously described C7 complex is
comprised of the nonessential SAGA complex and the
essential TAFIID complex (Figure 4).

Comparison to Collins et al
After submission of this article, a study by Collins et al.
was published in which the Gavin and Krogan TAP-MS
data sets were re-analyzed [29]. Using a supervised algorithm derived from Bayesian methods and optimized with
empirically-derived parameters, the study posited over
9,000 high-confidence interactions while labeling many
previously published interactions as being of lower confidence. Comparing the PICO network at the E = 10-2
threshold (E-2; 5,352 interactions) to the Collins results
shows an overlap of 4,356 interactions (Figure 7). The
interactions that are unique to the Collins data set are

highly enriched for ribosomal proteins: of the 4,714 interactions found in Collins but not PICO, 2,964 involve
ribosomal proteins. As these proteins are commonly copurified with tagged baits in TAP purifications (and subsequently identified by mass spectrometry), they are interpreted as promiscuous interactors in the matrix model of
protein connectivity, which considers bait-prey as well as
all prey-prey interactions in a given purification. Such
high-degree interactors are penalized under the hypergeometric scoring model; therefore, while all such interactions are scored in our model, virtually none exceed the
stringent score threshold we applied.

Component and MIPS annotation. The E2 derived complex also includes Spc72, the spindle pole body component which interacts with the Tub4p complex [30]. The
MIPS reference does not include Spc72 in the gamma
tubulin complex but does include the protein in the
"Spindle Pole Body Components" collection of proteins.
Thus interactions between Spc72 and other members of
the gamma tubulin complex, while almost certainly "true"
co-complex interactions, are scored as false positives
when calculating precision versus MIPS. All such experimentally detected inter-complex interactions are absent in
the MIPS reference set. Thus the incompleteness of the reference set prevents a high-accuracy experimental data set
from achieving perfect precision.

Conclusion
Figure 7

Further comparison shows that the hypergeometric scoring method and the Collins method yielded data sets of
nearly equal accuracy. We rank-ordered the two sets of
interactions by their respective scores, divided each into
bins of 500 interactions, and then plotted the cumulative
recall and precision of each versus MIPS co-complex interactions [see Additional File 5]. The Collins data set
achieves greater coverage than the PICO network, at
somewhat lower overall accuracy, when performance is
calculated against the entire MIPS reference. The difference is due almost entirely to the inclusion of ribosomal
protein interactions in Collins: when the ribosome is
removed from the MIPS reference set, both networks provide nearly identical recall (~34%) and precision (~81%).
That the networks generated by the two methods overlap
so strongly, despite our inclusion of the Ho dataset and
use of a much higher confidence threshold for the Krogan
raw data, suggests the networks capture a highly accurate
subset of yeast co-complex interactions, and that the simple probabilistic method offered in this study is an effective tool for assigning relative confidence rankings to
observations in large-scale data sets.
It is worth noting that even the highest-scoring interactions in the two analyses do not reach 100% precision versus the MIPS reference. This is in part due to the
incompleteness of the reference set. An interaction is
defined as a false positive if and only if both its corresponding proteins are present in the reference set but the
interaction is not. Thus, true interactions that are detected
experimentally but absent from the reference set will be
scored as false positives (provided the proteins are present
in the reference set). We observe several cases of this. For
example, the Tub4 gamma tubulin complex is composed
of Spc97, Spc98, and Tub4, as defined by GO Cellular

We have described a simple yet robust unsupervised
method of assigning confidence levels to interactions
observed in a large-scale assay, as well as combining data
from independent assays into an integrated whole that
can be used for further study. We used this method to integrate data from three large-scale affinity purification-mass
spectrometry assays in yeast to generate a high-confidence
subset of interactions, from which we derived an accurate
set of protein complexes. The recall of MIPS co-complex
interactions indicates that no more than 46% of the total
co-complex interactome in yeast has been assayed by TAPMS methods (with only 34% in the high confidence E2
set). Nonetheless, the high proportion of complexes that
correspond to existing annotations and the small number
of uncharacterized genes present in our high-confidence
data strongly suggest that the community has largely saturated the fraction of the complex-ome that is accessible to
the methods (TAP-MS) and conditions (aerobic growth in
rich media) that have been explored so far. Therefore, it
would likely be fruitful to explore other conditions and
growth states to extend the interactome.
Our complex data also support the notion that, in many
cases, essentiality is tied not to the protein or gene itself,
but to the molecular machine to which that protein
belongs. We can clearly separate the majority of complexes into essential and nonessential. The few that are
mixed – for example, the SAGA/TAFIID complex – lead to
interesting questions about the essentiality of specific
interactions [31]. We anticipate that the complex descriptions offered here, as well as the general scoring method,
can be used in other functional genomics and systems
biology studies.

Methods
Data sources
Data from Ho et al. were taken from Table S1 of [17].
Interactions from Gavin et al. were taken from Supplementary Table 1 of [11]. In both cases, bait-prey pairs were

Page 9 of 11

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:236

generated from the list of purifications, with the bait
removed from the prey list if applicable. Interactions from
Krogan et al. [12] were taken from the raw LCMS and
MALDI purification data. Bait-prey pairs from LCMS purifications with confidence > = 99.6 and MALDI purifications with score > = 3.4 were included. Matrix-model data
sets were generated by considering all prey-prey pairs if
both prey were purified from the same bait.
Reference data sets
MIPS filtered data: The MIPS curated complex data were
downloaded from mpact[23]. All high-throughput data,
as well as the large and small ribosomal subunits, were
excluded. An all-by-all set of interactions was generated
from each complex and used as a reference to calculate
recall/precision curves of experimental data. The co-complex data was used to calculate the Hubert statistic.

GO filtered reference set: The complete yeast GO Cellular
Component ontology was downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database [28] on 5 December 2006.
Annotations were sorted by the number of genes to which
they applied; all annotations equal to or larger than the
size of the "small cytoplasmic ribosomal subunit" were
discarded. The resulting set of annotations is mostly complexes, with a small number of discrete cellular localizations included. This annotation set was used to calculate
GO term enrichment and the Hubert statistic.
Analaytic techniques
The MCL program was downloaded from [24]. For each Evalue threshold of the PICO network, MCL was run with
the following parameter space: -I, 1.8 to 3.0 in 0.2 increments; -C, 0.5 to 1.5 in 0.25 increments; -S, 0 to 7. The
Hubert statistic (H) was calculated for each MCL result
against the GO filtered reference set and the MCL result
with the highest H score was considered the optimal result
for that E-value. The -S parameter was found to have no
effect on our results.

Calculation of the Hubert statistic, H, was performed as
described in [26]. As the matrices must be equal size, the
calculation was performed on the potential interaction
space defined by the set of proteins present in both the
experimental and reference protein sets.
The Simpson coefficient, Cs of similarity between sets of
proteins A and B, is:
Cs = (# proteins in A and B)/min(# proteins in A, # proteins in B)
