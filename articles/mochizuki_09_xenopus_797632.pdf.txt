Abstract
Background: In Xenopus retinogenesis, p27Xic1, a Xenopus cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor,
functions as a cell fate determinant in both gliogenesis and neurogenesis in a context dependent
manner. This activity is essential for co-ordination of determination and cell cycle regulation.
However, very little is known about the mechanism regulating the context dependent choice
between gliogenesis versus neurogenesis.
Results: We have identified NM23-X4, a NM23 family member, as a binding partner of p27Xic1.
NM23-X4 is expressed at the periphery of the ciliary marginal zone of the Xenopus retina and the
expression overlaps with p27Xic1 at the central side. Our in vivo functional analysis in Xenopus
retina has shown that knockdown of NM23-X4 activates gliogenesis. Furthermore, cooverexpression of NM23-X4 with p27Xic1 results in the inhibition of p27Xic1-mediated
gliogenesis, through direct interaction of NM23-X4 with the amino-terminal side of p27Xic1. This
inhibitory effect on gliogenesis requires serine-150 and histidine-148, which correspond to the
important residues for the kinase activities of NM23 family members.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that NM23-X4 functions as an inhibitor of p27Xic1mediated gliogenesis in Xenopus retina and suggests that this activity contributes to the proper
spatio-temporal regulation of gliogenesis.

Background
Co-ordination of cell cycle regulation and developmental
signaling is essential for proper development of the nervous system [1,2]. Recently, it has become clear that developmental signals can act on cell cycle regulation of neural
progenitors, while cell cycle components can influence
developmental signals. However, little is known about the
detailed mechanisms by which this co-ordination occurs.

The retina is an ideal system to analyze the communication between cell cycle regulation and cell fate determination. It consists of six major types of neurons: retinal
ganglion cells – horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, cone and
rod photoreceptor cells; and one glial cell type – Müller
glial cells. All neurons and glial cells are generally produced from a multipotent pool of retinal stem cells in a
sequentially determined order [3,4]. In the Xenopus retina,

retinal ganglion cells are the first cell type to be determined, at around stage 27/28, while bipolar and Müller
glial cells are the last to be determined at around stage 37/
38.
In the retina, differentiation of neurons and glial cells is
preceded by cell cycle exit of the progenitors during early
G1 phase. The fate of each cell type appears to be influenced during the final cell cycle [5-8]. Insufficient accumulation of a cell fate determinant in the last cell cycle
allows cell cycle progression without determination [9].
G1-phase cell cycle components, such as cyclin Ds, have
important roles in the choice between continuous proliferation and cell fate determination [10]. Cells arrested in
early G1 are more likely to be influenced by determinants
than cycling cells, while cell cycle activation tends to
inhibit the activity of determinants [8]. In addition, many
determinants have the ability to induce cell cycle exit in
G1 [2,11,12], suggesting bi-directional communication
between cell cycle components and determinants.
p27Xic1 is a Xenopus member of the Cip/Kip cyclin
dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (CDKI) family that
promotes Müller glial cell fate determination in the retina
[13]. The Cip/Kip CDKI family has a conserved CDK/cyclin binding domain in its amino terminus and memberspecific sequences in the carboxyl terminus. p27Xic1 activates gliogenesis through its amino terminus but in a cell
cycle regulation-independent manner. However, in the
presence of proneural genes, such as Xath5, p27Xic1
potentiates the activities of proneural genes [8]. A similar
neurogenic activity of p27Xic1 has been demonstrated in
Xenopus primary neurogenesis [14,15] and is also mediated through the amino terminus of the protein. Also,
p57Kip2 influences specification of amacrine cell subtypes in the mouse retina [16]. All these observations indicate that the Cip/Kip CDKIs regulate both gliogenesis and
neurogenesis through their amino termini in a contextdependent manner. Recently, this dual role has been demonstrated in the mammalian system as well. Mouse retinal
progenitors lacking Math5, a determinant of retinal ganglion cells, upregulate p27Kip1 and differentiate into
Müller glial cells [17]. Furthermore, CDKIs regulate differentiation processes through regulation of actin and microtubule structure [18-22]. These activities are mediated by
direct interaction between the carboxyl termini of CDKIs
and the regulators of cytoskeletal structures. These observations indicate that CDKIs have three independent activities: cell cycle regulation, cell fate determination, and
regulation of cytoskeletal structures. Previous work has
shown that the amino terminus of p27Xic1 promotes
neurogenesis by stabilizing neurogenin [14], but this
mechanism cannot explain how p27Xic1 promotes glial
rather than neuronal fate in the retina. To address this
conflict, we have screened for proteins that interact with

http://www.neuraldevelopment.com/content/4/1/1

the amino terminus of p27Xic1 and regulate its gliogenic
activity in the Xenopus retina. Here, we identify NM23-X4
as a binding partner of p27Xic1 and show that NM23-X4
regulates gliogenic activity of p27Xic1 in Xenopus retinogenesis.

Results
Identification of NM23-X4 as a novel binding protein of
p27Xic1
To identify proteins that interact with the amino terminus
of p27Xic1, we performed bacterial two-hybrid screening
using a Xenopus two-hybrid library (3 × 106 clones) and
the amino terminus (1–96 amino acids) of p27Xic1 as
bait. One of the positive hits encodes a protein sequence
with high homology to NM23 proteins. The NM23 family
consists of nucleotide diphosphate kinases (NDPKs),
which exchange -phosphate between nucleotide triphosphate and diphosphate [23]. Ten members are known to
comprise the human family (NM23-H1 to -H9 and RP2).
Apart from NDPK activity, NM23-H1 and -H2 have been
shown to possess additional activities, such as serine/threonine kinase, histidine dependent kinase, transcription
factor, 3'-5' exonuclease, and apoptosis induced DNase
activities (for reviews, see [24,25]). Although mouse
NM23-M1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system [26], very little is known about the role of NM23
members in neurogenesis and gliogenesis. We have identified five novel Xenopus members of the NM23 family by
searching the Xenopus EST database in addition to three
already known NM23 members [27]. Sequence alignment
revealed that our identified clone has the highest homology with the human NM23-H4 and we thus named it
NM23-X4 (Figure 1A–B).
Interaction between NM23 and CDKIs
Identification of NM23-X4 as a binding partner of
p27Xic1 by two-hybrid screening prompted us to verify
this interaction in cells. We were able to confirm this protein-protein interaction by immunoprecipitation after
transfection of tagged expression constructs in COS7 cells.
Initially, as shown in Figure 2A, immunoprecipitation of
NM23-X4 with p27Xic1 produced an extremely weak
band (lane 3). Since p27Xic1 is an unstable protein,
which is degraded by the proteasome [28], we analyzed
the interaction in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor
MG132. Lane 5 shows a strong band corresponding to
p27Xic1, indicating that indeed NM23-X4 binds to
p27Xic1. Also, we analyzed the effect of AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolysable analogue of ATP that stabilizes interactions
between NM23-H1 and the kinase suppressor of Ras [29].
However, AMP-PNP did not have any effect on p27Xic1
interaction with NM23-X4. All the following immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in the presence of
MG132 unless otherwise stated.

Interaction between NM23 and CDKIs
Interaction between NM23 and CDKIs. (A) Co-immunoprecipitation of NM23-X4 and p27Xic1 in COS7 cells. p27Xic1
interacts strongly with NM23-X4 in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. (B) Interaction of p27Xic1 with NM23X1, -X2, -X3, -X4, -X5, or -X6. (C) Interaction of p27Xic1 with the human NM23-H1 and -H4 homologs. (D) NM23-X4 interacts strongly with human p21Cip1 and p57Kip2, but not with p27Kip1. All analyses were performed in COS7 cells in the presence of MG132 unless otherwise stated.

Next, we wanted to know if p27Xic1 interacts with other
NM23 family members. As shown in Figure 2B, NM23-X3
also binds strongly to p27Xic1, while all other NM23s
tested interacted weakly. The human NM23-H1 and H4
interacted with p27Xic1 similarly to their Xenopus
orthologs (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results suggest that NM23-X4 and/or X3 are likely to be biologically
significant binding partners of p27Xic1.

Mammals have three Cip/Kip CDKIs (p21Cip1, p27Kip1,
and p57Kip2). Interestingly, NM23-X4 interacted with
p21Cip1 and p57Kip2, but not with the human p27Kip1
(Figure 2D). We identified two other Xenopus CDKIs,
p16Xic2 and p17Xic3, which also have gliogenic functions, similar to that of p27Xic1, although their expression levels in the developing retina are lower [30].
Interestingly, we found that p16Xic2 does not interact
with NM23-X4 (unpublished data). Sequence alignment

revealed that p27Xic1 is likely to be an orthologue of
p57Kip2 [30]. Since NM23-X4 is a binding partner of
p27Xic1/p57Kip2, we reasoned that NM23-X4 is likely to
work upstream of, or at the same level with, p27Xic1 as an
effector in retinogenesis.
NM23-X4 and -X3 are expressed in the ciliary marginal
zone of the retinaThe expression patterns of the novel
NM23 family members were analyzed in Xenopus
embryos. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that
there are significant levels of maternal and zygotic NM23X4 mRNA in early embryos (Figure 3A). However, in
whole mount in situ hybridization, specific localized
staining was not observed until neurula stages (Figure 3B,
a–b), suggesting that before gastrulation NM23-X4 is uniformly expressed in low levels. In neurula, NM23-X4
expression is detected in the neural fold with staining in
the eye primordia (Figure 3B, c–d). At later stages, its
expression is restricted to the head area, with stronger
staining in the eye, otic vesicle, brain, spinal cord, pharyngeal arch, and pronephros (Figure 3B, e–j). We also analyzed the expression patterns of other NM23 family
members. All NM23 family members are expressed in the
central nervous system, although their expression pattern
in other tissues varies (data not shown). NM23-X1 and X2 show ubiquitous expression (Figure 3C, k–l), while
NM23-X3, like NM23-X4, shows prominent staining in
the head region (Figure 3C, m).
The Xenopus retina continuously grows during the entire
life of the animal. At late stages, new cells are produced
from the peripheral region of the retina, the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). Retinal stem cells are located at the
most peripheral region of the CMZ and gradually generate
all types of neurons and glial cells towards the most central part. Therefore, genes important for cell fate determination are expressed in the most central part of the CMZ,
whilst genes related to retinal stem cell function are
expressed in the most peripheral region [8,31]. We analyzed the expression patterns of NM23 members in the
retina by in situ hybridization on tissue sections. At stage
41, the expression of NM23-X4 and -X3 persists in the
CMZ (Figure 4A–C), whilst other NM23 members are
ubiquitously expressed in the retina (data not shown).
This suggests that NM23-X4 and -X3 may be involved in
cell fate determination during retinogenesis. More precise
analysis was performed using earlier stages when the CMZ
covers a much wider area than that at stage 41. Interestingly, the expressed domain of NM23-X4 overlaps with
that of p27Xic1 at the central CMZ, but extended to a
more peripheral region than p27Xic1 (Figure 4D–F). The
same pattern is seen with NM23-X3, while expression of
NM23-X1 was ubiquitous (unpublished data).

NM23-X4 is a negative regulator of p27Xic1-mediated
gliogenesis
Our findings of the overlapping expression patterns and
protein interaction suggest that NM23-X4 functionally
interacts with p27Xic1 in retinogenesis. To further elucidate this, we took a loss-of-function approach using short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. The small interfering
RNA/shRNA-based system has been previously reported
by several groups [32-35]. We first tested the efficiency of
the approach using two shRNA constructs targeted against
p27Xic1 (shXic1-A and shXic1-B). Figure 5A,B show that
both shXic1-A and -B reduced p27Xic1 levels in both cell
cultures and Xenopus embryos. These plasmids were colipofected with GFP as a tracer into Xenopus eye primordia
at stage 15. The effect on distribution of retinal cell types
was analyzed at stage 41 by counting the numbers of differentiated neurons and Müller glial cells. Both shXic1-A
and -B significantly reduced the proportion of Müller glial
cells more effectively than a previously tested plasmid
producing antisense p27Xic1 RNA (Figure 5O and data
not shown) [13]. Furthermore, these effects were rescued
by co-overexpression with p27Xic1 (Figure 5P). We then
designed two shRNA constructs against NM23-X4 (shX4-A
and shX4-B) that recognize different target sequences and
analyzed their effects on retinogenesis. When the shRNA
constructs were introduced with tagged NM23-X4 in cells
or Xenopus embryos, both shRNA constructs reduced the
exogenous NM23-X4 protein levels, albeit with slightly
different efficiencies (Figure 5C,D). Due to lack of an antibody specific for Xenopus NM23-X4, it was not possible to
check the effect on endogenous protein levels. Monitoring
the mRNA levels was also difficult because of the low efficiency of lipofection in the retina. Interestingly, both lipofections of shX4-A and -B caused a two- to three-fold
increase in the number of cells with the morphology of
Müller glial cells, which have cell bodies residing in the
inner nuclear layer with a complex process expanding
from the apical side to the basal side of the retina (Figure
5E–H). The cell identity was confirmed by staining for
known Müller glial cell markers using the R5 antibody,
which stains the endfeet of Müller cells (Figure 5I–K), and
anti-CRALBP, which stains the processes of Müller cells
(Figure 5L–N). We further verified the phenotype by the
lack of staining for markers of other cell types (data not
shown). As shown in Figure 5O, both shX4-A and -B significantly increased the proportion of Müller glial cells. To
confirm the specificity of shRNAs, a rescue experiment
was performed (Figure 5Q). The effects of both shX4s were
rescued by co-introduction of a NM23-X4 expression construct. These results indicate that endogenous NM23-X4
functions as a negative regulator of gliogenesis and suggests that NM23-X4 may downregulate the p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis.

NM23-X4 inhibits p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis through
their direct interaction
Our results suggest that NM23-X4 negatively regulates
p27Xic1 activity. In order to test this hypothesis, we cooverexpressed p27Xic1 and NM23-X4 in the retina by
lipofection and analyzed the effect on gliogenesis. As
reported previously, p27Xic1 strongly activates gliogenesis (Figure 6A). Interestingly, co-expression with NM23X4 strongly inhibited this effect (Figure 6A). Other NM23
family members, NM23-X1, -X2, and -X3, also inhibited
p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis, although the inhibition
was weaker than that mediated by NM23-X4.

In order to gain more insight into the NM23-X4 action, we
examined the putative NM23-X4 interaction domain of
p27Xic1. Mutational analysis showed that NM23-X4
binds to two amino-terminal constructs of p27Xic1, NT
(1–96) and 1–91, but not to the carboxy-terminal one
(Figure 6B and data not shown). Interestingly, NM23-X4
did not interact with the 1–30 construct or the 31–96 construct, which is sufficient for both cyclin/CDK binding
and Müller cell inductive activity similarly to NT and 1–91
constructs [13], suggesting that NM23-X4 binding
requires an area covering both parts of 1–30 and 31–91.
Also, the realization that the immunostained bands of NT
and 1–91 are always stronger than that of the wild type
suggested that the carboxy-terminal region of p27Xic1
might negatively influence the binding between NM23X4 and p27Xic1. We then analyzed the effect of NM23-X4
and -X1 on gliogenesis mediated by p27Xic1 derivatives
(Figure 6C). Interestingly, both NM23-X4 and -X1 effectively inhibited the glial-promoting effect of full length
and NT constructs, while the effects of the 31–96 construct were hardly inhibited by these isoforms. These
results imply that the inhibitory function of NM23 proteins requires their interaction with p27Xic1 and that
NM23-X4 does not inhibit p27Xic1 activity downstream
of p27Xic1. Consistent with this, NM23-X4 does not
inhibit gliogenesis mediated by p16Xic2 (Figure 6D), with
which it does not bind. Next, the effect of co-introduction
of shX4-B and -B on gliogenesis was analyzed. Figure 6E
shows that shX4-B does not activate gliogenesis when

p27Xic1 is downregulated (in the presence of shXic1-B),
indicating that activation of gliogenesis by shX4-B occurs
in the presence of p27Xic1.
Serine-150 and histidine-148 are required for the NM23X4 activity
We then tried to identify the residue(s) or domain(s) of
the NM23 proteins important for the regulation of
p27Xic1 activity. Some critical residues and domains of
NM23-H1 have been identified previously (Figure 1B).
Histidine-118 of NM23-H1 (histidine-148 of NM23-X4)
is required for the NDPK and histidine-dependent kinase
activities [36]. Serine-120 of NM23-H1 (serine-150 of
NM23-X4) is also important for histidine dependent
kinase activity [36]. The KPN loop forms part of the active
center important for the kinase activity and mediates hexamer formation [37]. Therefore, three mutants of NM23X4 (NM23-X4 H148C, S150G, and KPN) were constructed and their interaction with p27Xic1 and effects on
p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis were analyzed. As shown in
Figure 6F, all three mutants interacted with p27Xic1.
Interestingly, NM23-X4 H148C and S150G mutants did
not inhibit p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis, while KPN
did (Figure 6G), suggesting that NDPK and/or histidine
dependent protein kinase activities are required for regulation of p27Xic1 activity. This might also suggest that
deletion of the KPN loop in the KPN mutant does not
structurally abrogate the active center formation as is
reported for the case of NM23-H1 [38].
Overexpression of NM23 family members promotes
gliogenesis
Overexpression of NM23-X4 alone in the retina increased
the proportion of Müller cells (Figure 7A–D). Staining
against the Müller glial markers R5 and CRALBP verified
the Müller cell identity of NM23-X4 expressing cells that
presented a glial cell morphology (Figure 7E–J). Anti-calbindin and 39.4D5 staining was performed to visualize
photoreceptor and ganglion cells in order to verify the
phenotype and confirm the cell type percentages (Figure
7K–P). Further analysis revealed that overexpression of
NM23-X1, -X2, -X3, and -H1 also induced similar glio-

genic phenotype (Figure 7Q and data not shown). Since
loss of function causes an increase in the Müller cell population, one would expect that overexpression of NM23
would have the opposite effect. Possibly, these observations show that NM23s function in a context-dependent
manner to regulate neurogenesis versus gliogenesis. Furthermore, it has been observed that the glial-promoting
activity of NM23-X4 is not affected by loss of function of
p27Xic1 (data not shown), suggesting that the activation
of gliogenesis by NM23 does not require p27Xic1. This
implies that NM23-X4 might have a second mechanism of
action, independent of the suppression of p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis. Ongoing experiments will further elucidate this.

overexpression above those levels does not affect the outcome. Further, when we analyzed clone sizes of lipofected
cells in Xenopus retina, we did not observe any significant
changes in the clone size after modulation of NM23-X4
activity (data not shown). This enforces the idea that
NM23-X4 primarily acts at the last step of the sequential
determination of retinal cell lineage, that is, the production of Müller glia cells without affecting the overall clone
proliferation (Figures 5O and 7Q). Last, there was no
effect of NM23-X4 on apoptosis in the retina (data not
shown). Using a TUNEL assay, we did not observe any
change in the ratio of apoptotic cells compared to the control (approximately 3.5% apoptotic cells at stage 33/34).

Discussion
Effect of NM23-X4 on cell cycle regulation
It has been evident that p27Xic1 regulates the cell cycle
acting as a cell cycle inhibitor. We therefore examined if
the NM23-X4 inhibition of p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis
has any effect on the cell cycle. To address this, we performed a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay
in the retina and a proliferation assay using early Xenopus
embryos [13]. Consistent with previous reports [13],
p27Xic1 reduces the proliferative potential of cells in both
neural retina and early embryos as demonstrated by the
decrease of BrdU positive cells (Figure 8A) and the
enlargement of blastomeres (Figure 8B,C), respectively.
Interestingly, NM23-X4 co-overexpression with p27Xic1
inhibited the p27Xic1-mediated cell cycle inhibition (Figure 8A–C). Furthermore, loss of NM23-X4 function, using
shX4-A and -B constructs, inhibited proliferation in the
retina as assayed in cells of the inner nuclear and ganglion
cell layer (Figure 8A). These observations suggest that
endogenous NM23-X4 functions as an inhibitor of the
p27Xic1 cell cycle regulatory action. Overexpression of
NM23-X4 or NM23-X1 by itself did not alter proliferation
in either retinogenesis or early embryogenesis. This observation may suggest that endogenous NM23-X4 levels are
already sufficient to suppress the p27Xic1 activity and

Developmental roles of the NM23 family members in
retinogenesis
NM23 family members possess NDPK activity, which is
required for production of ATP or GTP. In addition, several unique activities of NM23 family members have been
reported, such as protein kinase, exonuclease and DNA
repair activities [24,25]. Although NM23 family members
are expressed in the central nervous system, very little was
known about their roles in neural development. We
report that all Xenopus homologs are expressed in the retina, that NM23-X3 and -X4 are specifically expressed in
retinal precursor cells in the CMZ and that NM23-X4 has
an essential role in the distribution of retinal cell types
through interaction with p27Xic1.

The observation that inhibition of NM23-X4 function by
shRNA constructs increased the proportion of Müller cells
(Figure 5) indicates that endogenous NM23-X4 functions
as a regulator of gliogenesis in the retina. This function is
associated with its ability to inhibit p27Xic1-mediated
gliogenesis (Figure 6A). Our previous work showed that
p27Xic1 plays an important role in both neurogenesis and
gliogenesis in a context-dependent manner [8,13,14].
This means that CDKIs regulate the decision between neu-

rogenesis versus gliogenesis depending on the presence of
neurogenic stimuli in the progenitors [17]. In the Xenopus
retina, glial cells are formed after neurogenesis has taken
place. The expression of p27Xic1 in the CMZ as retinogenesis progresses is consistent with its role in cell fate determination [13]. As shown in Figure 4D–F, at stage 39,
NM23-X4 is expressed at the peripheral side of the CMZ.
The expression domain of NM23-X4 overlaps with that of
p27Xic1 in the central region of the CMZ (Figure 4F,G).
From the expression patterns of NM23-X4 and p27Xic1,
their interaction and functions, we propose a model, schematically represented in Figure 8D. According to this,
p27Xic1 acts at the central part of the CMZ to induce
Müller glial cells. NM23-X4 is responsive to suppress this
gliogenic activity of p27Xic1 at the peripheral part of the
CMZ, where their two expression domains coincide. This
suppression results in inhibition of Müller glial cell production and maintenance of the neurogenic potential of
the early progenitors in the retinal cell lineage.
Although it was previously reported that NM23-H4 is
largely located in mitochondria [39], our analysis using a
deletion construct of NM23-X4 lacking its mitochondriasorting signal showed that mitochondrial localization is
not required for its gliogenic activity (data not shown).
This is supported by the observation that all other NM23
members tested showed similar gliogenic activities (Figure 7Q) and p27Xic1 binds to both wild-type NM23-X4
and its amino-terminal processed form (data not shown).
It is more likely that the NM23 family regulates the activity of CDKIs in the cytosol because Cip/Kip CDKIs localize in the cytosol and shuttle to the nucleus depending on
the cellular context. This notion is also supported by the
cytosolic localization observed when we are staining
against tagged forms of exogenous NM23-X4 in embryos
in addition to the mitochondrial staining (data not
shown).
How does NM23-X4 inhibit the gliogenic activity of
CDKIs? We showed that direct interaction with the
amino-terminal half of p27Xic1 and a specific NM23-X4

activity, probably as a NDPK or protein kinase, are
required for the inhibition of p27Xic1. Although several
residues of CDKIs are phosphorylated, a majority of the
phosphorylation sites are located at the carboxy-terminal
half. In the amino-terminal half, only threonine-57 of
p21Cip1, serine-10 and tyrosine-88 of p27Kip1 have been
reported as phosphorylation sites [40-42]. However, the
threonine-57 and serine-10 sites are not conserved in
p27Xic1 and, moreover, NM23 family members are not
known to possess tyrosine kinase activity, arguing against
these sites on p27Xic1 being the ones phosphorylated by
NM23-X4. Previously, NM23-H1 was reported to phosphorylate the kinase suppressor of Ras in a histidine
dependent manner [29]. Also, the aspartic acid at 319 of
aldolase C is phosphorylated by NM23-H1 [43]. In bacteria and plants, histidine kinase activity has very important
roles through consequent phosphorylation of aspartic
acid and glutamic acid [44,45]. Interestingly, vertebrate
CDKIs have three conserved aspartic acids and glutamic
acid in the CDK/cyclin binding domain at the amino termini. Our preliminary work has shown that mutation of
these residues abrogates the NM23-X4 effect (data not
shown). Ongoing work will verify if CDKIs are direct targets of NM23-X4 action.
In addition to the inhibitory role of NM23-X4 on gliogenesis, we have shown that a large gain of NM23-X4 activates gliogenesis. We have provided evidence that, at the
endogenous level, NM23-X4 works as a negative regulator
of p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis through direct protein
interaction as shown by the knock-down analysis. Data
from overexpression assays suggest that NM23-X4 works
as an activator of gliogenesis in a mechanism largely independent of p27Xic1. Further work will be required to
determine how NM23-X4 may act as an activator of gliogenesis. It is evident that it affects cell fate determination.
Recent work has shown that purine-mediated signaling
has a major role in eye development [46]. It is of great
interest that molecules involved in ATP/ADP enzymatic
steps are also part of a regulatory network, along with
transcription factors and other partners, to affect eye

expression gradually increases in the CMZ [13]. Gliogenic activity is also gradually activated in the ciliary marginal zone. NM23X4 inhibits the activity of p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis at the peripheral side of the p27Xic1-expression domain. This results
in proper temporal and spatial regulation of gliogenesis. Single, double and triple asterisks correspond to P  0.05, 0.01, and

development. The exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated in future work.
NM23-X4-mediated regulation of cell type distribution
versus cell cycle regulation
Distribution of retinal cell types can be influenced by
modulation of cell cycle regulation and cell death in addition to cell fate determination. Our analysis shows that
endogenous NM23-X4 functions as an activator of the cell
cycle (Figure 8A–C). This is in accordance with the finding
that NM23-X4 binds to the CDK/cyclin domain at the
amino-terminal region of p27Xic1. The binding may be
antagonistic and compete with the binding of other CDK/
cyclin partners, abolishing the formation of a complex. Is
this cell cycle related activity responsible for the regulation of the ratio of Müller glial cells in the retina? p27Xic1
has been shown to activate Müller gliogenesis along with
its cell cycle inhibitory action. The cell fate determination
activity is separable from the cell cycle regulatory one,
although both activities are mediated by the amino-terminal region. Our observations regarding binding of NM23X4 with the amino-terminal region of p27Xic1 and functional assays suggest that NM23-X4 also regulates both
the cell fate determination and cell cycle related activity of
p27Xic1. Further analysis is required to exclude the possibility of direct cell cycle involvement in the change of cell
type distribution.
Diverse roles of CDKIs and NM23s in biological processes
As mentioned, the amino termini of CDKIs regulate both
cell cycle and cell fate determination. Recent papers show
that the carboxyl termini of CDKIs directly bind with regulators of cytoskeletal proteins. For example, p21Cip1,
p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 directly bind to Rho kinase/
ROCK, RhoA and Stathmin, and LIM kinase, respectively
[18-22], to influence neurite formation and cell migration. Knockout mice of CDKIs show normal cell division,
suggesting that they are not essential for the fundamental
cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, differentiation factors

are known to induce expression of CDKIs. Taken together,
these observations indicate that the Cip/Kip CDKIs have
three independent functions: cell cycle inhibition, cell fate
determination, and differentiation. It is demonstrated
that, upon induction by secreted differentiation factors,
the primary role of CDKIs lies in their ability to regulate
the process of neuro/gliogenesis by co-coordinating cell
cycle arrest, cell fate determination, and differentiation.
Our results also demonstrate that NM23 members can
work in a CDKI-dependent context and participate in this
regulatory network. NM23-H1 was originally identified as
an inhibitor of cancer metastasis [24]. However, still little
is known about the mechanism of this action. Recently,
some papers showed that the Cip/Kip CDKIs are major
regulators of cancer metastasis [19]. Our observations
overall propose the attractive hypothesis that CDKIs, regulated by NM23s, may have a major role in controlling
both neural development and cancer metastasis.

Conclusion
We have identified NM23-X4 as a binding partner of
p27Xic1 and showed that its expression in the CMZ overlaps with that of p27Xic1. Our functional analysis demonstrates that endogenous NM23-X4 negatively regulates
p27Xic1-mediated gliogenesis and potentiates neurogenesis through protein-protein interactions. The glia-inhibitory function of NM23-X4 is likely to require its NDPK or
histidine dependent kinase activity. Our results suggest
that NM23-X4 functions in a temporal and spatial manner to regulate the process of gliogenesis during sequential
retinal cell fate determination.

Bacterial two-hybrid screening and plasmid construction
The bacterial two-hybrid screening was performed by BacterioMatch™ (Stratagene Texas, USA) using a bait construct, pBT-Xic1, that has the amino terminus (1-96 amino
acids) of p27Xic1 and the BacterioMatch Xenopus embryo
library (Stratagene). A positive clone including NM23-X4

was identified from several positive clones after confirmation steps. NM23-X1, -X2, and -X3 expression plasmids
were kindly provided by Dr A Mazabraud [27]. Through a
Xenopus EST database search and blast search we identified
-X5
[GenNM23-X4
[GenBank:BU900096],
Bank:CK805921], -X6 [GenBank:BX845338], -X7 [GenBank:BG555939] and -X8 [GenBank:BE679366]. All
clones were obtained and subcloned in a pCS2FLAG vector. Mutants H148C, S150G, KPN loop, and (1-33) of
NM23X4 were made with a site-directed mutagenesis or
deletion strategy in pCS2FLAG according to standard procedures. The p27Xic1, its mutants and the p16Xic2 constructs were described previously [13,30]. HA-tagged
constructs were made using HA-pcDNA3 vector.
Design of shRNA constructs for p27Xic1 and NM23-X4
shRNA target sequences were designed using the web site
siDirect [47]. Two shRNA constructs against different target sites were constructed using pSUPER (Oligoengine
Seattle, Washington, USA)). The designed oligonucleotides for p27Xic1 and NM23-X4 are as follows: shXic1-A

Xenopus embryo manipulation, mRNA injection, and
lipofection
Xenopus laevis embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization, and staged according to Niewkoop and Faber. All
embryo manipulations were in accordance with the UK
Home Office regulations and guidelines. For mRNA injection, all plasmids (pCS2FLAG-NM23X1, X4, pCS2p27Xic1, pCS2-ngal) were linearized and transcribed in
vitro using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Austin,
TX, USA)). The mRNAs were injected into one blastomere
at the two-cell stage. Lipofection into eye primordia was
performed as described [48]. The indicated constructs
were lipofected in the eye field of embryos at stage 15. At
stage 41, the lipofected embryos were fixed and cryostat
sectioned as previously described. For cell-tracing purposes, pGFP plasmid was co-lipofected with all plasmids.
In some cases, co-lipofection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry against the myc or FLAG tag. Cell types
were determined by morphology and location of cell

body and nucleus along the retinal epithelium and confirmed by cell type specific antibody staining. About 400
cells from 6 retinas were counted in each condition. Each
experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical
analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA.
Proliferation assays
BrdU experiments in Xenopus retina were performed as
described in our previous paper [13]. Briefly, the indicated
construct was co-lipofected with a GFP plasmid at stage
15. BrdU was injected in the abdomen from stage 30 to
stage 41 at intervals of 8 h. The embryos were then fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned. The section was
treated with 2 N HCl and subjected to BrdU antibody
staining according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche
Lewes. East Sussex, UK)). We then determined the ratios
of BrdU and GFP double positive cells of the inner nuclear
layer (Müller glial cells, bipolar, amacrine and horizontal
cells) and ganglion cell layer. For the proliferation assay in
early embryos, mRNA was injected into a right blastomere
at the two-cell stage and the injected embryos were fixed
at stage 7. The cell diameter of approximately 20 cells
(longest length) was measured after taking images using
the Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, West Midland, UK). Then, the ratio between the diameter of
injected and uninjected sides was calculated (Figure 8C).
RNA extraction and RT-PCR
RNA extraction and RT-PCR were carried out as described
[49]. The primers used were: NM23-X1 (forward, 5'-GAGGGACTGAATGTGGTAAA-3';
reverse,
5'-TTTAAACCACAAGGCAATTT-3');
NM23-X4
(forward,
5'AGCAGAACATTACCATGACC-3'; reverse, 5'-TAGCCTGGGAAGAGTCTGTA-3'). The primers for ornithine
decarboxylase have been described previously [30].
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
In situ hybridization of whole embryos and sections was
carried out as described previously [13]. Probes were prepared after linearization of pBluescript plasmids encoding
the full-length cDNA of NM23 members or p27Xic1 and
digoxigenin- or FITC-labelling in vitro with polymerase T7
or T3. In situ hybridization on cryostat sections was performed after untreated embryos were fixed, sucrose
treated and embedded in OCT compound. Colour reactions were performed using BM Purple and Fast Red
(Roche) according to standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry was preformed as described [8]. Primary antibodies used were anti-R5 (1:1), anti-CRALBP (1:1000;
from J Saari), anti-calbindin (1:100; Sigma St. Louis, MO,
USA), anti-39.4 D5 (1:100), and anti-FLAG (1:100;
Sigma). All immunostainings were visualized with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies under a fluorescent microscope.

Cell culture, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting
COS-7 cells were cultured in DME media/Glutamax (Invitrogen, Paisley, Renfrewshire, UK) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as
described [49]. Briefly, about 100,000 COS-7 cells/well
were transfected using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen See
above) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 20
h, MG132 (final concentration 50 M) or AMP-PNP (200
M) was added to the medium. Then, 4 h later the cells
were washed several times with 1× phosphate-buffered
saline and lysed in 500 L of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 M
PMSF). The supernatants were isolated by centrifugation.
We performed immunoprecipitation using about 90% of
the cell lysate of COS-7 cells after measurement of the protein level and used about 10% of the lysate (20 g of protein) for confirmation of levels of expressed proteins. For
immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with 2
g of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. Then, 20 L
of Protein G-sephrose (Sigma) was added to the mixture.
The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After several
washes by 1× phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were
eluted from the sepharose with 1× SDS buffer. The
obtained proteins were separated in 8–15% SDS-PAGE,

for HA-tagged proteins. (Note that in the immunoprecipitation experiments, although the expression levels of
NM23-X3, NM23-X6, NM23-H4, and p17Xic3 are lower
than other proteins, these proteins resulted in significant
amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins. We used about
10% of the lysate for checking the expression level and
about 90% for immunoprecipitation, suggesting that the
amounts of proteins in the immunoprecipitation were
sufficient for the binding.)
