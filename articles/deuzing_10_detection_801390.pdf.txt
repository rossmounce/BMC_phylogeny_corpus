Abstract
The complete nucleotide sequences of three chimpanzee polyomavirus genetic variants were determined. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses form two different genotypes of ChPyV. Comparison with other primate
polyomaviruses revealed a putative agnogene, and an unusually long VP1 open reading frame. The transcriptional
control regions (TCR) of the viruses were extremely short (155 nucleotides), and highly conserved amongst the
genotypes. Analysis of the TCR from different chimpanzee subspecies, and from a series of tissues from five individuals confirmed its genetic stability, and also indicates that double-infections with different genotypes can occur.
Findings
The number of primate polyomaviruses (PyV), including
human polyomaviruses, has rapidly expanded in recent
years. Six human viruses, KIPyV, WUPyV, Merkel cell
polyomavirus (McPyV), Trichodysplasia Spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV), HPyV6, and HPyV7 have
been characterized in patients suffering from respiratory
tract infections (KI and WU), Merkel cell carcinomas
(MC), virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa (TSP),
or were detected in the skin of healthy individuals
(HPyV6, and HPyV7) [1-5]. Simultaneously, novel
simian viruses have been discovered in healthy squirrel
monkeys and orangutans [6,7], and in diarrheal stool
from a chimpanzee [8]. From the chimpanzee polyomavirus (ChPyV) only the nucleotide sequence of the VP1
gene has been published [GenBank: AY691168]. We
have investigated the genetic variation of ChPyV, and
sequenced the genome of three chimpanzee polyomavirus variants. We also analyzed the genetic variation of
ChPyV in relation to the host subspecies, and investigated ChPyV tissue tropism.
ChPyV VP1-specific PCR primers, based on the published VP1 sequence, were used to screen DNA isolated

from blood samples collected from captive and wildcaught chimpanzees (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, QIAGEN
Benelux BV, Venlo, The Netherlands) (Table 1). Captive
animals originated from former chimpanzee colonies
kept at the BPRC (n = 66) and another primate facility
in Europe (n = 24). Materials from wild-caught
chimpanzees were obtained from animals housed in a
rehabilitation centre in Africa (n = 22). The outer amplification reaction was performed in a 50 μl volume using
1 μg of DNA, 2 units Maxima™ Hot Start Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas GMBH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany),
5 μl 10 × Hot Start PCR buffer, 1 pmol of each primer,
2 mM MgCl2, and 200 μM of each dNTP. Cycling conditions for both reactions were 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec. In a second amplification
reaction, 2 μl of the PCR product of the outer PCR was
used as template. Inner PCR conditions were identical
to those for the outer PCR, except that 2.5 mM MgCl2
was used. The PCR fragments were gel-purified using
the Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research
Corp, Orange, USA), and sequence analysis was performed directly on the purified amplicons (Baseclear
BV, Leiden, The Netherlands). Thirty VP1 sequences
were obtained and sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis
revealed the presence of two genetic groups, one of
which consisted of two smaller subclusters (genogroup
2A and 2B; Figure 1). We next investigated if there was

a relationship between viral genotype and chimpanzee
subspecies. The chimpanzee subspecies was determined
by analysis of mitochondrial control region (D-loop) [9],
and data showed that genogroup 1 solely consisted of
viruses derived from individuals belonging to the Pan
troglodytes verus subspecies, while group 2 was formed
by viruses obtained from the three major subspecies
Pt. verus, Pt. troglodytes, and Pt. schweinfurthii.
Full-length nucleotide sequences of representatives
from each variant were determined using long-distance
PCR [6,7]. Sequence comparison of the genomes confirmed that two variants ChPyV-Ta and -Az (genogroup
2A and 2B, respectively) were more similar to each
other (96.6%), than to ChPyV-Bob, a genogroup 1 virus
(92.6% and 92.7%, respectively). Sequences have been
deposited under EMBL database accession numbers
FR692334 to FR692336. Further analysis confirmed a
typical polyomavirus genetic structure of each variant,
with an early region encoding the small t- (t-Ag) and
large T-antigens (T-Ag), and a late region encoding the
VP1, VP2, and VP3 structural proteins. All three viruses
accommodate a potential agnogene, encoding a protein
of 64, 65, or 74 amino acids for ChPyV-Az, ChPyV-Ta
and ChPyV-Bob, respectively. The first two agnogenes
are located 5’ to the VP2/VP3 open reading frame (orf),
but curiously the agnogene of ChPyV-Bob is fused inframe with the VP2/VP3 orf. An alignment of the agnoVP2 junction, illustrating the disparity between the viral
genomes, is given in Figure 2A. The VP1 structural proteins encoded by the ChPyV genomes are considerably
longer than VP1 from other polyomaviruses. The VP1
orf of ChPyV-Bob (nt. 1033-2526) encodes a protein of
498 amino acid residues (aa.) that has an additional 75
amino acids at its C-terminus compared to the longest
VP1 described to date, that of the McPyV. Within the
same C-terminus of ChPyV-Az and -Ta, an 8 aa. deletion (nt. 2356-2380) is found (Figure 2B). BLAST analysis of this region did not reveal any similarity with other

known proteins. Search for specific polypeptide motifs
or patterns (ExPASy proteomics server; http://www.
expasy.ch/tools/) was also unsuccessful. The amino acid
sequence similarity of the ChPyV structural proteins
(represented by ChPyV-Ta) with known human and
simian polyomaviruses is shown in table 2. Strikingly,
within the early region the highest similarity is found
with t-Ag and T-Ag from the human Merkel cell polyomavirus, while the late proteins, VP1- VP3, are most
similar to the equivalent proteins of the polyomavirus
from Sumatran orangutans.
The transcriptional control region (TCR) of polyomaviruses controls gene expression and viral replication.
This region, located between the start of the t-Ag orf,
and the start of the putative agnoprotein orf, is only 155
bp long for all three ChPyV variants, and is the shortest
TCR of all PyV presently known. It is practically conserved between the viral variants; the TCR of ChPyVBob differs only at nucleotide 128 with the other TCRs.
Consequently, the architecture of the TCR is simple
(Figure 3). A 22-bp palindromic sequence is located at
nt. 96-117, and contains two tandemlypositioned T-ag
binding sites. An additional binding site is found at nt.
68-72, and is directed towards the early region. In contrast to other polyomavirus TCRs no repeated sequences
are distinguishable. This feature makes the ChPyV the
most basic TCR yet characterized, exceeding the protoarchetypal SV40 TCR in simplicity [10-12]. The SV40
TCR is a highly variable region that is mainly due to
extensive rearrangements of enhancer elements caused
by propagation of the virus in cell culture [13,14]. Evidence also indicates that rearrangements play a role in
viral pathogenesis [15,16], and, recently it was found
that in kidney transplant recipients a re-arranged TCR
conferred BKV with a higher replicating capacity [17].
From a group of 23 animals, consisting of 16 Pt. verus,
6 Pt. troglodytes, and one Pt. schweinfurthii, the TCR
region was amplified in a nested PCR assay (Table 1).
PCR mixes were identical to the VP1 assay, except that
2 mM MgCl2 was used. Amplification conditions were:
an enzyme activation step of 4 min at 96°C, followed by
40 amplification cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 45 sec. Sequence analysis revealed
minimal TCR variation was observed [EMBL:
FR692222-FR692244]. In 13 animals, an adenine instead
of a guanine was seen at nucleotide 128, which is
located within the AT-rich region. Of interest, all animals that had the adenine at this position belonged to
the Pt. verus subspecies.
We also investigated the presence of ChPyV in different tissues taken at autopsy from five Pt. verus chimpanzees. The animals, varying from 7 to 43 years old, died
of various causes. Histopathological examination did not
reveal any lesions related to polyomavirus infection, like

with the exception of the sciatic nerve sample from

the VP1 assay. Recent data from human polyomaviruses
point to the skin as a target organ for PyV persistence
and replication [2,4,5]. Interestingly, the skin was positive in all samples (n = 4) that were analyzed from our
chimpanzees. In Melanie and Gina, both chimpanzees

with a low number of tissues infected (4 of 32, and 4 of
33, respectively), the skin belonged to the few PCR-positive tissues. This suggests a similar skin tropism for
ChPyV as for the human viruses. In addition, in 4 of 5
spleen samples the virus was easily detectable by PCR,
while a more generally accepted target organ like the
kidney, scored only 1 out of 5 DNA samples positive.
The TCR of all 32 positive tissue samples was
sequenced [EMBL: FR692190-FR692221]. Variation was
minimal and similar to the abovementioned results in
animals from different origin. In 25 TCR sequences
(1 from Bob, 2 from Gina and Melanie, and 20 from
Regina) an adenosine was identified at nucleotide 128,
while in all 6 sequences from Antoine, and in 1 out of 2
TCRs obtained from Bob a guanine was found at this
site. This strongly suggests that Bob was double infected
with two viral variants, although a point mutation,
occurred during viral replication, cannot be completely
ruled out.
In this study we have molecularly characterized three
variants of the chimpanzee polyomavirus, and took a
glimpse at some biological and evolutionary properties
of this virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated
VP1 and T-Ag protein sequences from avian and mammalian polyomaviruses show that the chimpanzee
viruses form a distinct group of viruses, distantly related
to the human McPyV and TSPyV, the orangutan polyomaviruses and LPV from African green monkeys. Interestingly, both rodent viruses (MuPyV and HaPyV) also
fall within this large cluster (Figure 4) The chimpanzee
polyomavirus genomes have some unique features, as
they encode for unusually long VP1 structural proteins,
and, in contrast, possess an exceptionally short TCR.
The exact significance of these finding needs to be substantiated, and goes beyond the scope of this paper.
Most interesting is the short and conserved TCR of the
chimpanzee virus. Because the polyomavirus TCR regulates viral replication and pathogenesis, and its sequence
variation in other PyV is likely the cause or consequence
of these processes [15-17], it is an intriguing question
how ChPyV with such a ‘basic’ and apparently genetically constant TCR regulates these processes. Our
findings add to the increasing awareness that the Polyomaviridae are a genetically diverse family of viruses. In
a recent study, van der Meijden et al. distinguished
seven PyV clades, and pointed towards a complex evolutionary history [5]. The number of PyV has increased in
the last few years; viruses have been detected in Californian sea lions (CSLPyV1) [18], bats (MyoPyV) [19],
birds [20,21], in addition to the novel simian viruses.
We have detected new polyomaviruses in apes (gorillas
and bonoboos), Old World monkeys, like hamadryas
baboon and mandrill, and in capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys, both New World monkeys (unpublished

data; EMBL: FR692182-FR692189). With the help of
improved diagnostic techniques and the use of metagenomic approaches [22-24] it can be expected that more
polyomaviruses will be detected in the near future.
