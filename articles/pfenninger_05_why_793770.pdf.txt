Abstract
Background: Costly structures need to represent an adaptive advantage in order to be
maintained over evolutionary times. Contrary to many other conspicuous shell ornamentations of
gastropods, the haired shells of several Stylommatophoran land snails still lack a convincing adaptive
explanation. In the present study, we analysed the correlation between the presence/absence of
hairs and habitat conditions in the genus Trochulus in a Bayesian framework of character evolution.
Results: Haired shells appeared to be the ancestral character state, a feature most probably lost
three times independently. These losses were correlated with a shift from humid to dry habitats,
indicating an adaptive function of hairs in moist environments. It had been previously hypothesised
that these costly protein structures of the outer shell layer facilitate the locomotion in moist
habitats. Our experiments, on the contrary, showed an increased adherence of haired shells to wet
surfaces.
Conclusion: We propose the hypothesis that the possession of hairs facilitates the adherence of
the snails to their herbaceous food plants during foraging when humidity levels are high. The
absence of hairs in some Trochulus species could thus be explained as a loss of the potential adaptive
function linked to habitat shifts.

Background
Evolutionary theory predicts that costly structures must
convey a fitness advantage to their bearers in order to be
maintained over evolutionary time [1]. Flightlessness in
birds and insects, limblessness in lizards and sightlessness
in cave-dwelling organisms are some prominent examples
of phenotypic regression due to the loss of adaptive function (reviewed in [2]). Molluscs in general and gastropods
in particular display a fascinating diversity of elaborate

shell structures [3,4] and have attracted considerable
research efforts to explain them in adaptive terms [5-7].
The proposed roles invoked mechanical stability [8],
defence against predators [9], sexual selection [10] and
climatic selection [11]. However, the potential selective
advantage of hair-like shell ornamentation of certain land
snail species remains unknown.

These hairs can reach varying densities (up to 20 per
squaremilimetre) and lengths (up to three millimetres).
In some cases hardly visible, they confer an almost furry
impression to the shell in others. These semi-rigid structures are part of the periostracum, a thin protein layer
(conchiolin) secreted by the snail to cover the calcareous
shell [12]. Building hairs requires the snail to have specialised glandular tissue and complex strategies to form them.
Consequently, this trait can be assumed to be costly and
should thus present a selective advantage to its bearers in
order to be conserved.

Trochulus within the Hygromiinae with high posterior
probability, except for T. lubomirskii, which seems to be
only distantly related to this genus (Figure 2). In addition
to the early branching T. villosus/alpicolus clade, the genus
is composed of three well supported subclades: first, a
clade containing the T. striolatus/plebeius-like lineages
together with T. villosulus, a second clade with ecologically
divers species confined to the Jura mountains and the
neighbouring Mittelland-plain and finally, a T. hispidus/
sericeus-like clade, containing also T. biconicus and a new
species.

Haired shells occur in several species of the Stylommatophoran families Polygyridae, Helicidae and Hygromiidae.
These families are only distantly related [13], suggesting
that this features has evolved several times independently.
Haired shells are almost exclusively observed in species
living in moist microhabitats, like layers of fallen leaves,
broad-leaved vegetation, damp meadows or wet scree
[14]. Such a correlation suggests an adaptive significance
of the trait in such a habitat [1]; it was thus speculated that
the hygrophobic hairs facilitate the movement in wet
environments by relieving surface tension [14,15]. A correlation between haired shells and humid habitats is thus
expected. In order to test this, we employed the recent
Bayesian extensions of the comparative method, allowing
to take mapping and phylogenetic uncertainty simultaneously into account [16]. With a diversity hotspot in South
Germany, Eastern France and Switzerland, the land snail
genus Trochulus s. str. (common name: Hairy snails) is particularly suited to address our question: its species exhibit
variability in both hairiness and ecology. This study
present the first comprehensive molecular phylogeny for
the genus Trochulus Chemnitz, 1786 (until recently
Trichia, Hartmann 1840) based on mitochondrial and
nuclear loci. Finally, we tested experimentally whether the
possession of haired shells indeed facilitates locomotion.

Correlation of shell hairiness with habitat
The PCA on habitat humidity describing variables
resulted in two meaningful axes, representing 79.7% and
13.4% of the total variation. The first component opposed
sampling sites in shady woods and sites in sun exposed,
open areas. This axis can therefore be interpreted as an
evaporation gradient. The second axis is a gradient of the
summer precipitation on one hand and the humidity
demand of the vegetation on the other (Figure 3). It can
thus be considered as a humidity gradient. The sampling
sites appear as two distinct clusters that could be classified
as either moist or dry (Table 1). The outlier (TA) was also
considered to be humid, according to its high humidity
levels. For each population, at least ten adult individuals
were scored for the presence or absence of hairs (mixed
populations were not found). Non-haired populations
exclusively corresponded to species described in the literature as having smooth shells (Table 1). When plotting
the hairiness of each population on the PCA, a complete
congruence between humidity and hairiness became
apparent: haired shells tended to occur at sites with low
evaporation and/or high precipitation while smooth
shells were found at places with high evaporation and/or
lower precipitation (Figure 3).

Results
Lineage identification and phylogenetic relations
The initial phylogenetic analysis on a COI data set of the
presumed Trochulus species resolved 18 terminal clades,
each with 0.99 posterior probabilities or higher (Figure
1). The uncorrected sequence divergence among those
clades ranged from 0.029 to 0.173 (Table 2). Out of these
lineages, nine could be assigned to existing taxa, because
the species were sampled from the type locality and/or
were morphologically unmistakable. The nine remaining
clades, however, could not be unequivocally attributed to
a taxonomic name. All eighteen identified lineages were
used as molecularly defined operational taxonomic units
in the subsequent analyses [17].

The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the entire data set
(COI, 16S and ITS-1) showed the monophyly of the genus

Character state evolution
As the occurrence in moist habitats was systematically
linked to the presence of hairs in Trochulus s.str., only a
single analysis was necessary for both characters. The
Bayesian analysis of character evolution suggested with
high posterior probability that the most recent common
ancestor of the genus Trochulus most likely possessed hairs
and lived in a moist habitat (Figure 4). The analysis also
revealed considerable mapping- and/or phylogenetic
uncertainty in the reconstruction of crucial ancestral
nodes (nodes 1–3 in Figure 4). The average Bayesian
parameter estimate for the character change ratio was 2.50
± 0.11 (mean ± s.d.), indicating that a loss of hairs associated with a transition from wet to dry habitats occurred
more frequently than vice versa. This was in concordance
with the parsimony reconstruction of character state
changes on all different topologies of the 99% credibility
set of trees. A minimum number of three independent

could not be attributed to described species. This suggests
that many other more or less morphologically similar
entities may exist throughout the range of the genus. The
existence of cryptic lineages could explain at least in part
the current taxonomic uncertainty in Trochulus [18-20].
For example, several subspecies have been described for T.
striolatus [21], which may well represent distinct evolutionary lineages such as described here. Given that the
sequence divergence among the nine unidentified lineages is of the same magnitude as among described, morphologically and ecologically distinct species (Figure 1,
Table 2), it can be reasonably assumed that the cryptic lineages within the striolatus/plebeius and hispidus/sericeus
clades correspond to good species. Even under the
assumption of an exceptionally fast molecular clock in
land snails of up to 5% sequence divergence per one million years [22], the lineages in the striolatus/plebeius clade,
for example, persisted for at least two million years as
independent evolutionary entities. The existence of more
or less cryptic lineages or species is not an unusual finding
in land snails [23-25]. In contrast to the high divergence
of the unidentified lineages, the comparatively small
genetic distance between T. villosus and T. alpicolus indicated a questionable specific distinction between these
two taxa. Detailed phylogeographic analyses in addition
to morphometric and ecological studies will be necessary
to disentangle the species limits of these cryptic Trochulus
complexes, clarify the taxonomy and reveal their evolutionary history. In addition, the species T. lubomirskii,

A haired shell appears as the ancestral state in the genus
Trochulus. This inference is strengthened by the observation that some of the hair-less species do possess some as
juveniles. During the evolutionary history of the genus
Trochulus, hairs appear to have been lost several times
independently (Fig. 3, Table 1) and this was always correlated with a shift in habitat (i.e. hairs are only present in
moist habitats, mostly woodlands). This suggests that
hairs potentially have an adaptive function in humid habitats and once the presumed selective pressure for the
maintenance of these costly protein structures is relieved,
they are lost. Such a correlation makes certain potential
adaptive explanations for hairiness unlikely: defence
against predators or mechanical stability have no obvious
reasons to co-vary with the humidity characteristics of a
habitat.
The facilitation of locomotion by decreasing the adhesion
to water films in humid environments had been previously hypothesised to be the selective advantage of a
haired shell [14,15]. However, the results of our experiments have shown that the opposite is true. The presence
of hairs significantly increased the minimum force necessary to move shells over wet surfaces. Having thus shown
that the initial hypothesis [14] is at least in this case not
applicable, we propose an alternative: haired shells may
confer an selective advantage by increasing the adhesion
to the water film on the unstable, moving leaves of their
feeding plants during foraging (Figure 5). Indeed, snails
are mostly active during phases of high ambient humidity
[27] when leaves are covered with a water film due to rain,
fog or dew. This water film is usually in contact with the
shell during locomotion (Figure 6). Observation shows
that Trochulus species in moist habitats preferentially forage on large-leaved herbaceous plants like Adenostyles,
Urtica, Homogyne or Tussilago [28]. Hence, falling off the
leaf and needing to crawl up again to this feeding site (that
can be one meter above ground) represents a considerable
effort given the exceedingly costly and ineffective locomotion of land snails [29]. In dry habitats on the contrary,
snail species avoid the hard plant matter typical for this
habitat and preferentially feed on dead material lying on
the ground [28,30], where a mechanism increasing shell
adhesion offers no obvious advantage to its bearer. This
interpretation is supported by the fact that phylogenetically distantly related haired species, such as Helicodonta
obvoluta and Isognomostoma isognomostoma, are found in
the same habitats and have in general similar life-styles
[31]. However, as long as the positive effect of increased
adherence to food plants on the individual fitness is not
proven, this remains a hypothesis and does not preclude

additional or even other adaptive functions of haired
shells.

Conclusion
The present comparative analysis suggested that hairs on
the shell confer a selective advantage in humid habitats
only and are thus lost in drier habitats. In other words, the
variability of hairiness within the genus Trochulus could be
explained in terms the loss of its adaptive function in a
selectively different environment.

Methods
Taxon sampling
Analyses were undertaken on twelve of the about 15 currently recognised species presumed to belong to the genus
Trochulus s. str. Chemnitz, 1786 (Hygromiidae, Stylommatophora). However, the exact number of existing species is not known, because the species limits of the widely
distributed T. hispidus and T. sericeus on the one hand and
T. plebeius and T. striolatus on the other are equivocal
[19,20], the validity of several described taxa is disputed

[18,32] and newly discovered species are not yet formally
described (Pfenninger, unpublished data). Since initial
analyses showed the existence of cryptic lineages, several
populations for each of the putative species were sampled
(Table 1). Four species from other genera of the subfamily
Hygromiinae and two species of the family Helicidae were
used as potential outgroups [33] (GenBank accession
numbers AY546263, AY546343, AY546303, AY546284,
AY546324,
AY546283,

DNA sequencing, lineage identification and phylogenetic
analysis
Entire snails were crushed and vortexed in 10% w/v laundry detergent solution for storage at room temperature
and tissue digestion [34]. For 78 individuals, a 512 bp segment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was
amplified with PCR and sequenced. For selected individuals representing the major evolutionary lineages inferred
in the previous analysis, a 362 bp fragment of the large
subunit mitochondrial ribosomal gene (16S) and 509 bp
of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) from the
nuclear ribosomal cluster were additionally amplified and
sequenced. An amount of 0.2 to 1 ng total DNA (quanti-

fied on a 1% agarose gel using a λ Hind III marker) were
used as template in polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Specific PCRs were performed with the primers, amplification conditions and temperature profiles shown in Table
2. Primers were used for both specific PCR and subsequential automated direct sequencing. PCR products were
purified using E.N.Z.A. Cycle Pure Kit (peqlab, Erlangen,
Germany). Ten ng per sample were subjected to cycle
sequencing using the ABI Prism Big Dye terminator kit
(Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA). Sequencing reactions
were electrophoresed on an ABI 377 automated DNA
sequencer. In order to verify the results, gene products
were sequenced in both directions and the two strands
were aligned with SEQUENCE NAVIGATOR 1.0.1 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA). Sequences were deposited
in GenBank under accession numbers DQ217794DQ217831. The orthologous DNA sequences were initially aligned using the default settings of CLUSTAL X [35]
and optimised by eye. The most likely models of sequence
evolution and their parameters according to the Akaike
information criterion were inferred for each DNA data
partition using MODELTEST v. 3.4 [36]. In an initial analysis, we used the COI data set to identify evolutionary lineages. A 99.9% credible set of phylogenetic trees was
estimated with the program MRBAYES [37] by sampling
the tree space using a Metropolis coupled Monte Carlo
Markov chain, implementing a TN+I+Γ model of COI
sequence evolution (where TN denotes Tamura-Nei, Γ is
the shape parameter of the gamma distribution and I the
proportion of invariant sites). Initial runs as well as a posterior inspection of the likelihoods in the final run
showed that a burn-in phase of 10,000 generations was
largely sufficient for both analyses to allow the likelihood

values to reach convergence. The chain was run for
10,000,000 generations and sampled every 100th generation. An unrooted majority consensus tree was computed
from the sampled trees, excluding the trees sampled in the
burn-in phase. The procedure was repeated for the phylogenetic data set where the Markov chain was run with separate models of sequence evolution for each data partition
(GTR (general time reversible)+I+G for 16S and TVM
(transversional model)+ Γ for ITS-1). Outgroup status was
assigned
to
Helixaspersa
[33].
Correlation of habitat humidity with shell hairiness
The direct estimation of humidity levels for sampling sites
is difficult without long-term observation. However, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/59

precipitation regime, habitat structure and vegetation at a
sampling site can give clues on the degree of humidity
experienced by the snails. For this behalf, five variables
were recorded for all but one population belonging to Trochulus s.str. species. To characterise the microhabitat conditions, the mean light- and humidity indicator values
[38] of the three most abundant herbaceous plant species
at each sampling site were recorded (variables LIGHTIND
and HUMIND). The evaporation regime is strongly influenced locally by the exposure to sun and wind, which was
accounted for by characterising each sampling site as
either i) entirely shadowed (2), partially or sometimes
shadowed (1) and never shadowed (0) (variable
SHADOW) and either ii) situated in a closed wood (2),
open wood or forest edge (1) or not in a wood (0) (variable WOOD). Ultimately, the humidity conditions of a site
depend on the precipitation in the area. As Trochulus species are active mainly during summer, we have recorded
the average long-term precipitation from April to September (variable SUMMERPREC). This information was
extracted from the climate layers with a spatial resolution
of 0.5 min implemented in the computer program DIVAGIS version 4.2 for the spatial analysis of biodiversity [39].
The variables were summarised in a principal component
analysis (PCA).
For all Trochulus s.str. populations investigated, the presence or absence of hairs on the shell of at least 10 adult
individuals was recorded. As the hairs may wear off during
adulthood (although rarely completely), the lack of the
typical hair pits in the fine sculpture of the shell was taken
as evidence for their principal absence. The presence or
absence of hairs of the respective populations was then
plotted on the PCA ordination.

Bayesian estimation of ancestral character states
In a first approach, we derived the posterior probability
distribution of ancestral character states and their rate of
change from 3000 trees sampled at random from the
99.9% credibility set of phylogenetic trees, using the Bayesian approach as implemented in the program MULTISTATEBAYES [40]. Applying an uninformative (uniform)
prior on the rate parameter distribution, a Markov chain
was run for 1,000,000 generations after it reached convergence. The estimated rate parameter ratio for both directions of character change as well as the reconstructed
ancestral states for each internal node of the tree investigated was sampled every 200th generation. This procedure
estimates i) the probability that the ancestral node existed
in the first place and ii) the probabilities of both character
states at the respective node. These three probabilities sum
up to 1, thus simultaneously taking phylogenetic and
character mapping uncertainty into account. In a second
approach, the most parsimonious number of character
state changes was reconstructed for each of the 99.9%
credibility set of phylogenetic trees using the ANCESTRAL
STATE RECONSTRUCTION module in MESQUITE [41].
The different reconstructions were then weighted according to the posterior probability of the corresponding tree
[42].
Adhesion experiments
The minimum force necessary to move Trochulus shells
(upwards oriented apex) with or without hairs over dry
and wet, horizontal leaf surfaces was measured. For this
behalf, we have chosen the largest species, T. villosus. It
would have been desirable to use shells of other lineages
as well, however, it was not possible to measure the force
necessary to move smaller shells with the necessary accuracy. Twelve T. villosus shells were glued to thin nylon
strings. The strings were led over a roll with a small aluminium basket fastened on the other end. Small weights
were incrementally added to the basket until the shell
began to slide. This was replicated five times for each shell
on both water film covered and on dry surfaces. Then, the
hairs were mechanically removed to obtain smooth shells
and the procedure was repeated. For each condition, differences in minimum force needed to move the shells
with or without hairs were tested for significance with an
ANOVA design.
