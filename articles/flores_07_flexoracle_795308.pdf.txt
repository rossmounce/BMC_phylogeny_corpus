Abstract
Background: Protein motions play an essential role in catalysis and protein-ligand interactions,
but are difficult to observe directly. A substantial fraction of protein motions involve hinge bending.
For these proteins, the accurate identification of flexible hinges connecting rigid domains would
provide significant insight into motion. Programs such as GNM and FIRST have made global
flexibility predictions available at low computational cost, but are not designed specifically for
finding hinge points.
Results: Here we present the novel FlexOracle hinge prediction approach based on the ideas that
energetic interactions are stronger within structural domains than between them, and that fragments
generated by cleaving the protein at the hinge site are independently stable. We implement this as
a tool within the Database of Macromolecular Motions, MolMovDB.org. For a given structure, we
generate pairs of fragments based on scanning all possible cleavage points on the protein chain,
compute the energy of the fragments compared with the undivided protein, and predict hinges
where this quantity is minimal. We present three specific implementations of this approach. In the
first, we consider only pairs of fragments generated by cutting at a single location on the protein
chain and then use a standard molecular mechanics force field to calculate the enthalpies of the two
fragments. In the second, we generate fragments in the same way but instead compute their free
energies using a knowledge based force field. In the third, we generate fragment pairs by cutting at
two points on the protein chain and then calculate their free energies.
Conclusion: Quantitative results demonstrate our method's ability to predict known hinges from
the Database of Macromolecular Motions.

Background
Proteins fold reliably into conformations essential for
their function. The coordinates reported as representing a
protein structure, however, are in fact averages over an
ensemble at low temperature, at least when solved by X-

ray crystallography. Specific motions are thermodynamically permitted about this equilibrium position and often
play an important role in enzyme catalysis and proteinligand interactions. The motions can be classified according to the size of the mobile units, which may be frag-

ments, domains or subunits[1,2] They can be further
classified on the basis of packing as shear, hinge, or other
[1-3].
The mechanism of motion is difficult to observe directly.
NMR studies can yield root mean square fluctuations and
order parameters[4]. Optical trapping [5] can be used to
track the movement of molecular motors. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange can be used to measure changes in the
solvent exposure of amide protons[6]. The hinge connecting two independently folded domains in a protein is
sometimes a sensitive site for proteolytic cleavage[7].
Many of these experimental techniques, however, require
much effort and provide limited information[8].
Computational simulations have been used for several
decades to predict protein dynamics. However expense
generally prohibits the all-atoms modeling of large systems without substantial simplifications[9]. Even for systems of moderate size, hinge bending and other large scale
backbone rearrangements often take place on time scales
inaccessible to Molecular Dynamics. Normal mode studies can be performed using the simplified GNM treatment,
but often multiple modes are necessary to represent the
motion[10], and it is not necessarily clear a priori which
modes are important. Yang et al[11], for example, show
that squared-displacement minima of the first two nontrivial modes are correlated with active site location, and
argue that this is the hinge point. Similarly, Rader et al[12]
showed that fluctuation minima of the one or two slowest
modes avoid the folding cores of proteins, and argued that
these coincide with interdomain hinges. Kundu et al[13]
use the lowest order nontrivial mode to assign residues to
one of two structural domains according to the sign of the
displacement, and also perform some physically motivated postprocessing of the results.
Similarly, much work has been done to solve the related
problem of finding domain boundaries, which can be
flexible or inflexible. Nagarajan and Yona[14] have
shown how to analyze multiple sequence alignments to
identify domains. Marsden et al showed that predicted
secondary structure could help find domain boundaries.
Jones et al. combined PUU[15], DETECTIVE[16], and
DOMAK[17] to make a powerful domain boundary predictor[18]. Domain boundaries, again, are not necessarily
flexible, and furthermore many of these methods require
a multiple sequence alignment which cannot always be
obtained. Given the difficulty of observing motion by
experimental means and the limited accuracy or applicability of existing computational methods, there is a need
for improved techniques for predicting motion.
45% of motions in a representative set from the Database
of Macromolecular Motions have been found to move by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/215

a hinge bending mechanism [1-3]. Keating et al.(in preparation) found that interpretation of hydrogen-bond dilution plots produced by FIRST[19] could discriminate
domain hinge bending from fragment motions with some
accuracy, even when the motion itself was unknown. For
hinge bending proteins, if the location of the hinge could
be predicted given a single set of structural coordinates,
significant insight could be gained into possible movements.
Numerous valuable contributions have been made to the
computational prediction of protein hinges. If the structure has been solved in two different conformations, then
the hinge can be identified by visual inspection (Flores et
al., submitted) or by use of FlexProt[20] or DynDom[21].
A much more difficult problem arises when only one conformation is known. In an early contribution, Janin and
Wodak[22] developed a domain interface area calculation
method. The FIRST algorithm[19,23-26] uses graph theory to economically identify rigid substructures. FRODA
uses geometric simulation under constraints assigned by
FIRST to generate alternate conformations of proteins
which have been shown to be consistent with crystallographic and NMR data for certain proteins[9], but this
ignores many important intra-molecular interactions and
is more useful for loop motions than for domain hinge
bending. Similarly, DisEMBL[27] successfully predicts
flexible or disordered regions in proteins using a neural
network, but this local flexibility alone is not a very strong
predictor of hinges (Flores et al., submitted). The
TLSMD[28] procedure analyzes the distribution of atomic
displacement parameters associated with the mean position of each atom, and generates Translation-LibrationScrew descriptions of rigid groups of atoms, but has no
means of identifying the group responsible for the principal hinge bending mechanism, and is limited to X-ray
crystal structures of sufficient resolution. The Gaussian
Network Model (GNM)[29] is an approximate algorithm
for normal mode extraction widely used in flexibility prediction. FlexOracle is a complementary new addition to
this set of tools.

Methods
Domains can move relative to each other only if the
motion is permitted energetically. Thus if two domains
have many interdomain interactions they are unlikely to
separate. Similarly, if a motion results in the exposure of
large hydrophobic areas on the protein, then the energetic
and entropic cost of solvation will make that motion less
likely to occur.
For these reasons, we argue that if two or more domains
are joined by a hinge, and if a peptide bond is broken on
the protein, the energetic cost of separating and solvating
the two resulting fragments will be lowest if that break is

lation as follows. We define EC as the single point energy
of the complete (undivided) protein. This includes
bonded and non-bonded interactions. In the energy evaluation step we again use the OPLS-All Atom force field with
the SASA implicit solvent model. Note that this step, and
this step alone, will change in the second variant of FlexOracle.
For each choice of cut location i, we compute fragment
single point energies Efrag1(i) and Efrag2(i). We argue that
ÎE(i) = Efrag1(i) + Efrag2(i) - EC is related to the energy
change associated with hinge motion about the selected
hinge, as follows.

in a hinge. Conversely, if the break is inside a rigid
domain, the energetic cost will be high. We will show how
this idea leads to a hinge prediction method.
Single-cut hinge predictor (TINKER version)
The idea of evaluating the cost of separating two fragments can be implemented using the minimization and
single point energy evaluation features available in almost
any molecular mechanics engine. This energy of separation is equivalent, up to an additive constant, to the difference in enthalpies between the two fragments generated
by introducing a single cut on the protein chain on the
one hand, and the original, undivided chain on the other
hand. This energy evaluation can be carried out for every
choice of cut location, and the resulting energy vs. cut
location graph should have minima at locations that coincide with flexible hinges between domains. We will
explain the methodology in detail.

We start with an energy minimization step, to relieve any
close contacts or unnatural bond lengths or angles in the
undivided chain which would bias the results. For this we
use TINKER's minimize routine with the OPLS-All
Atom[30] force field and the Ooi-Scheraga Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)[31] continuum solvation free
energy term. For each iteration of the predictor, we introduce a cut between residues i â 1 and i. This divides the
protein into two fragments, numbered 1 and 2 (Figure 1).
Fragment 1 is a polypeptide containing residues 1 to i â 1,
and fragment 2 is another polypeptide containing residues i to N. We use these fragments in an energetic calcu-

The quantity ÎE(i) represents the intra-fragment energy
gained or lost by breaking all of the interactions between
fragment 1 and fragment 2, as might occur in an opening
motion. It also includes the solvation energy which might
be gained or lost. The quantity EC is a constant independent of the cut location and can be set to zero without consequence.
Even when the actual motion of the protein is not an
opening one, the method should have predictive value
because for incorrect choices of the hinge location, i.e. cut
locations that are actually inside one of the domains,
many inter-fragment interactions would be broken. Also,
significant hydrophobic areas would be exposed on the
surfaces of fragments 1 and 2. In either case, ÎE(i) would
be relatively high.
Clearly, we can repeat the procedure of cutting the protein
before residue i and computing ÎE(i) for values of i that
are scanned from 2 through N. We then plot ÎE(i) vs. i
and expect that minima on this graph will correspond to
hinge locations.
It is to be expected that there exists a "single-cut" error
associated with the fact that we are cutting the backbone
at only one location. In many proteins, the backbone
crosses the hinge region two or more times. Thus the single-cut predictor gives significantly clearer results for single-stranded hinges (e.g. Lir-1, see Discussion of specific
proteins) than for double, triple, etc. stranded hinges (e.g.
GluR2). We will return to this point later.
Identification of local minima
As will be discussed later for specific proteins, the local
minima tend to coincide with hinges; globally lowest
energy values were not the best indicators of flexibility.
However many minima were generated by short range
fluctuations in the predictor results which did not correspond to hinges. Therefore in order to clearly define
which minima are most likely to correspond to hinges we
used a moving window minimum identifier as follows.

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:215

First, the energies were normalized to range from 0 to 1. A
given residue was considered to be a minimum if it had
the lowest energy of any residue in a window that also
included 8 residues to the left and right (for a total of 17
residues in the window). However it also had to be lower
in energy than the highest energy residue in the window by
0.12. Lastly, residues less than 20 amino acids from either
terminus were not considered as possible minima. Whenever any residue i was found to be a minimum, residue i 1 was also considered to be a minimum. This is because as
indicated earlier the energy value associated with residue i
actually corresponds to a cut between residues i - 1 and i.
Single-cut predictor (FoldX version)
Standard molecular mechanics force fields do not account
for the backbone and side chain entropy, which is not
needed to calculate dynamics. For our purposes entropy is
important, since it is possible that changes in freedom of
motion influence conformational change. Therefore we
sought to improve the method by using the FoldX[32,33]
force field. FoldX includes terms that estimate the entropic cost of constraining the backbone and side chains in
particular conformations. The interaction with solvent is
treated mostly implicitly, although persistent entrained
water molecules are treated explicitly. Other terms
account for Van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and steric interactions.

In the FoldX version of the single-cut predictor, the energy
minimization step described above (for the TINKER version) was still carried out using the OPLS-All Atom force
field, but in the energy evaluation step, also described
above, calculation of the fragment energy was now carried
out using the FoldX force field. All other steps were carried
out exactly as for the TINKER version.
Two-cut hinge predictor
Although accounting for the entropy was an important
improvement, the method described above is still implicitly geared towards the detection of single-stranded hinges
since it cuts the chain at a single location. One obvious
way to deal with double stranded hinges is to make not
one but two cuts in the backbone, at residues i and j. To do
this the single index i was replaced with the indices i and
j. These define two fragments consisting of the following
residues:

Fragment 1: residues 1 to (i - 1) and (j to N)
Fragment 2: residues i to (j - 1)
We initially tried using CHARMm with the Born Solvation
Model to compute the enthalpies of the fragments, but the
computational expense was prohibitively high and the
accuracy relatively low. We found that if instead we com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/215

puted the free energy using FoldX, the predictor became
accurate and the expense reasonable.
In order to find the choice of i and j corresponding to the
hinge location one should ideally generate two fragments
for every possible choice of i, j but in practice we found
that restricting i and j to multiples of four was sufficient to
locate the hinge in most cases and the resulting 16-fold
reduction in computational expense brought the method
into the realm of practical calculation on a single processor. Additional savings were obtained by restricting the
range of i, j, to no fewer than 5 residues from either terminus and requiring that i â¤ (j-8), although numbers greater
than 8 could potentially be used for even greater savings.
To put this more concisely the calculation scheme looks
like this:
for (i = 8 to N - 5 - 8 step 4)
for (j = i + 8 to N - 5 step 4)
compute FoldX_energy (stability of fragment 1 + fragment 2)
The free energy of folding for each of the two fragments
was computed separately by means of a 'Stability' run in
FoldX 2.5.2. FoldX_energy is the sum of the two energies.
Once FoldX_energy was calculated for all such pairs of
fragments it was plotted, with energies coded with blue =
lowest energy and yellow = highest as shown in figures 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Upon inspecting these graphs and comparing
local minima of free energy to the known hinge locations,
we found that the following cases occurred:
1. The i, j indices of a minimum were near the diagonal,
meaning the corresponding fragment 2 was small. Such
minima were discarded since the diagonal energies are
generally small and we are not interested in small fragment motions.
2. Both i and j were near the termini. These minima were
also discarded, because the termini are usually flexible but
we are not studying those motions.
3. Of the minima that did not fall in cases 1 or 2, the lowest minimum sometimes had one of its two indices near a
terminus, but the other substantially far from either terminus. In this case the former index was discarded for the
reasons cited in (2) but the latter index tended to coincide
with a single-stranded hinge.
4. Of the minima that did not fall in cases 1, 2, or 3, the
lowest very often indicated the location of a double
stranded hinge.

5. Lastly, on occasion the minimum reported following
cases (3) or (4) did not correspond to the known hinge
location, but one of the higher minima not eliminated per
cases 1 and 2, did.

If this resulted in fewer than 30 fragment pairs, we instead
flagged the 15% of pairs with lowest energy. All the
remaining (unflagged) elements were not considered to
be candidates for the hinge location.

To identify and deal with the various cases, some clustering and postprocessing were needed, as follows.

Clustering
The next step was to identify and separate the local
minima, for which we employed the k-means clustering
algorithm. Centroids were initially generated in a regular
grid spaced 50 residues apart starting at i, j = 25, 25. The
pairs flagged in the culling step were each assigned to the
nearest centroid. The location of each centroid was then
recomputed for each resulting cluster, and the pairs were
once again reassigned to the nearest recomputed centroid.

Culling
As a preliminary step, we flagged all choices of i, j that
resulted in

FoldX_energy < min(FoldX_energy) + (max(FoldX_energy) min(FoldX_energy))Â·0.1

single-cut predictors correctly suggest the hinge at residue 103, but less clearly at residue 235. Several false positives can also
be seen, at residue 135 and around residue 50. c. The 2-cut predictor yielded the correct result, as indicated by the minimum
circled in green.

This process was repeated until all centroids stopped moving. The lowest-energy element of each cluster was taken
as the local minimum corresponding to that cluster.
Determination of hinge location
The minima found in the preceding step were recorded in
order of energy, with the lowest corresponding to the global minimum. Any minima such that i â¥ (j - 24) were discarded since they border the diagonal, per case (1) above.
If for any minimum both i and j were within 20 residues
of the termini, that minimum was also discarded, per case
(2). For the lowest remaining minimum, if only one of the
two indices was within 20 residues of a terminus, then the
protein was identified as having a single-stranded hinge,
per case (3). The index near the terminus was discarded
and the remaining index was taken to be the location of

the single-stranded hinge. Otherwise, both indices were
taken together to indicate the location of a double
stranded hinge, per case (4). Since the calculation was
done only for every fourth residue, the hinge prediction
was reported as a range:
Hinge 1: residues i -2 to i +1
Hinge 2: residues j -2 to j +1
Case (5) occurred somewhat less frequently, and so
although our program outputs the remaining local
minima these are much less accurate than the primary
hinge prediction and were not used in the Statistical evaluation section. We do, however, discuss these secondary
predictions in the Discussion of specific proteins section.

form [37]. The FoldX single-cut predictor, worked well for both calcium-bound and calcium-free forms Calmodulin. Nonetheless we recommend caution when treating metal-bound proteins, since the two-cut predictor had mixed results here. c. The 2cut predictor results: Primary prediction: residues 30â33, 66â69. Additional predictions: 104â107;84â87. Although the primary
prediction does not coincide with the annotated hinge, upon inspecting the corresponding morph (78252-5656) we observed
that indeed there are hinges coinciding with the predicted location, although they result in less backbone motion than the hinge
at residue 80. Similar points (residues ~36,63) are annotated hinges in the evolutionarily related Troponin C (morph 33301030921). In the interest of maintaining the objectivity of the HAG, we did not update the hinge annotation. We further note that
the third lowest-energy local minimum (84â87) is close to the HAG hinge. Thus although the first prediction did not coincide
with the HAG, the results nonetheless yield significant insight into the flexibility of the protein.

Results
We tested our method against 20 pairs of protein structures (40 total structures), in the Hinge Atlas Gold (HAG),
a dataset of manually annotated hinges publicly available
on our Database of Macromolecular Motions[2,3,34-36].
We present the results in a summary statistical form and

also discuss the individual results for six structures of the
40.
The HAG provides a carefully curated collection of 20
homologous pairs of single-chain protein structures[37].
Its name reflects its origin in the Hinge Atlas, a much

larger set of morphs with annotated hinge locations. The
latter is not suited for our purposes since it contains structures stabilized by large ligands, subunits of large complexes, and other cases requiring special treatment. The
HAG is specifically compiled for the purpose of testing
structure-based predictors of domain hinges and therefore
includes only structures that meet the following conditions:
1. The structure is soluble and independently stable,
rather than relying on other chains or molecules to maintain its conformation.
2. The structural coordinates were obtained by x-ray crystallography, with the exception of calcium-free calmodulin.

Statistical evaluation
As mentioned in the Methods section, FlexOracle assumes
hinges do not simply correspond to points of globally lowest energy, but rather to local minima identified and postprocessed in various ways. The set of residues reported as
predicted hinge locations by any of the three versions of
FlexOracle are referred to as test positives, and the number
of residues in this set we will call M. the residues annotated as hinges in the HAG are referred to as gold standard
positives, and the number of these we will call H. In this
section we compare the test positives to the gold standard
positives to objectively evaluate the predictor. Before we
do do so, however, we need to define a few more standard
statistical terms as they relate to the current context:

Gold standard negatives: The residues in HAG that are NOT
annotated as hinges.

3. At least two sets of atomic coordinates are available,
and together they represent a domain motion that is biologically relevant or thermodynamically feasible.

TP (true positives): The number of residues that were both
test positives and gold standard positives.

4. The motion involves two or more rigid domains moving about a flexible hinge.

FP (false positives): The number of residues which were test
positives and gold standard negatives.

Each of these pairs of protein structures, also known as
morphs, has an annotated hinge location. This location
was chosen prior to running any hinge prediction codes,
by visual inspection of the corresponding morph movie.
We have found manual annotation to be more reliable
than the use of automated methods such as FlexProt, DynDom, or Hingefind, which depend on user-adjustable
parameters and sometimes incorrectly assign the hinge
location. The process of inspection and annotation was
aided by the "Hinge Annotation Tool" available on the
morph page for each morph in MolMovDB. It consists of
a set of arrow buttons which adjust the position of a window of residues, which are highlighted as the protein
moves. This tool can also take annotations from the public for various uses. The result of the annotation effort is a
set of hinge residues for structural pairs against which
FlexOracle and other hinge predictors can be tested.

TN (true negatives): Number of residues which were test
negatives and gold standard negatives.

One must bear in mind that the hinge annotation is not
encyclopedic. It is based on the comparison of two sets of
structural coordinates, but other motions not reflected by
this measure may be thermodynamically feasible. In some
cases FlexOracle predicted hinges not annotated in HAG
but for which we later found experimental evidence in the
published literature. Since the point of the HAG is to be
objective rather than comprehensive, in these cases we did
not change the annotation or our scoring of the predictor
results. Some of these discrepancies are discussed in the
Discussion of specific proteins section. First, however, we
evaluate the performance of FlexOracle on the HAG as a
whole.

FN (false negatives): Number of residues which were test
negatives and gold standard positives.
Population: All of the residues in the HAG. We will call the
number of these residues D. Sensitivity (true positive rate) =
TP/(TP + FN) = TP/H. This is the ratio of true positives to
gold standard positives.
Specificity (true negative rate) = TN/(TN + FP) = TN/(D - H).
This is the ratio of true negatives to gold standard negatives.
Null hypothesis: The statistical hypothesis that the set of test
positives is not different from the population in a statistically
significant fashion.
Alternate hypothesis: The hypothesis that the set of test positives is different from the population in a statistically significant fashion.
p-value: This is the probability that a set of residues numbering as many residues as are in the test positive set, and
selected randomly from the population, would contain TP
or more gold standard positive residues. If the p-value is
above 0.05 we conventionally accept the null hypothesis,
otherwise we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis. Clearly, the smaller the p-value the better
the predictor.

"Test positives" for GNM were those residues with first normal mode displacement below 0.02. Recall that the displacements are normalized to
range from 0 to 1. For the single-cut predictors, test positives were residues identified as defining a local minimum per the algorithm described in
the text. Lastly, "test positives" for the two-cut predictor are those selected under the strict criterion (4-residue window) also described in the
text.

The p-value is computed for all predictors in this study

We will use the sensitivity, specificity, and p-value in our
statistical evaluation. p-value is a particularly useful quantity, since it compares directly to random picking. The
three quantities will be used to evaluate the three versions
of FlexOracle and compare to GNM[29], long a popular
flexibility prediction algorithm.
Single-cut predictors and GNM
We begin our statistical evaluation with the TINKER and
FoldX versions of the single-cut predictor. We take as our
test positives those residues identified as local minima
according to the algorithm described in the Methods section, then tabulate the various statistical quantities per the
above definitions. GNM requires a slightly different treatment. To evaluate this predictor, we compute the absolute
value of the first normal mode displacements and normalize this quantity to range from 0 to 1. The nodes, or
points of zero displacement, are taken to correspond to
the hinge location. Therefore we take all residues with
normalized displacement smaller than 0.02 to be test positives. The results are shown in Table 1.

We observed qualitatively (figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) that the
FoldX version of the single-cut predictor was significantly
less noisy, and therefore had fewer minima than the
TINKER version (240 residues for FoldX vs. 923 for
TINKER). This led to a lower sensitivity for the FoldX version, but improved specificity and p-value. GNM is less
specific than either of the single-cut predictors, but has
better sensitivity and p-value. This underscores the need
to improve the single-cut predictor and further motivates
the development of the two-cut predictor.
Two-cut predictor
The two-cut predictor was run on the 40 proteins in HAG
and the results were compared to the hinge annotation.
Note that as explained earlier test positives are reported by
the two-cut predictor in windows 4 residues wide due to
the 4-residue grid spacing. We refer to this window width
as the strict criterion and use it for our statistical benchmark. The results are shown in Table 1. Note that the pvalue is 3.5Â·10-66 â indicating very high predictive power.

This proves the statistical significance of the test but in
practice for a given protein a prediction that is in some
sense close enough to the correct hinge may for practical
purposes be considered a true positive even if it does not
coincide exactly. Therefore for a more operational benchmark we widened the definition of the test positives to
include 5 residues to the left and right of the predicted
hinge location, for a window width of 14 residues (loose
criterion). When a gold standard positive residue was
found within the 14-residue window, this was considered
a true positive. The test was considered a success for a given
protein if there were no false positives or false negatives
under this criterion. The test was considered a partial success if there were one or more true positives but also one
or more false positives and/or false negatives. Finally, the
test was a considered a failure if there were no true posi-

tives for that protein. The results are shown in Table 2. As
can be seen, the majority of the proteins were successes.
Under this criterion there were 47 true positive hinge
points. For these, the average distance between the center
of the gold standard positive residues and the center of the
test positive residues was 1.66 residues. For 29 out of the
47, the distance was 1 or 0 residues. Thus even under the
loose criterion the predictions had a tendency to line up
closely with the HAG hinges. This can be appreciated in
Figure 8, where the test positives are aligned with the corresponding gold standard positives, and the test outcome
is indicated.
Also in the same figure one can observe that the predictor
did not work well for the two pairs of proteins with triplestranded hinges.
One must keep in mind that as we mentioned earlier, the
HAG annotations reflect hinges chosen under a very specific crystallographic criterion and are not encyclopedic.
Therefore for some of these "failures" it is possible that the
prediction is correctly suggesting a motion which is thermodynamically permitted but is not reflected in the pairs
of structures used to generate the hinge annotations. We
will discuss this for specific cases in the following section.

Discussion
We chose six representative proteins from the 40 structures in the HAG for detailed discussion. These reflect
some of the diversity of the set and illustrate the salient
features of the algorithm. For each of these, we present
structural images with the annotated hinges highlighted.
We also present and discuss the results of running the
three versions of FlexOracle on the structure. The FlexOracle results for all 40 HAG structures can be viewed
online[37].
The single-cut version of FlexOracle naturally works best
on single-stranded hinges. This condition is less common,
and in fact most proteins in HAG have two strands in the
hinge, and a couple even have three. We will show that the
single-cut predictor nonetheless has predictive ability in
these cases, although the two-cut predictor is much more
accurate.

The two-cut predictor, in contrast, is specifically designed
to handle double-stranded hinges. It is also designed to
respond to single stranded hinges by discarding one cut of
the pair as described earlier. We did not attempt to extend
the method to explicitly treat the case of triple stranded
hinges.
Under either scheme, only one chain is analyzed at a time,
in the absence of ligands, bound metals, or additional
subunits of a complex. We show that the method is robust
under removal of small ligands from co-crystallized coordinate sets. The method obtained mixed results with Calmodulin (see discussion below) so we do not recommend
only careful use with metal-bound proteins. Similarly,
care should be taken with single subunits taken from
complexes, since these have not been tested rigorously.
Folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) (closed)
Folate is a vitamin essential for cell growth and replication, in its sole function mediating the transfer of one-carbon units[39,40]. Folate must be polyglutamated by FPGS
or else it may efflux from the cell[41]. In the polyglutamylation mechanism, a free carboxylate group on
the folate molecule is activated in an ATP-dependent
manner to give an acyl phosphate intermediate; this is followed by an attack by L-glutamate. FPGS forms a complex
first with MgATP, then a folate derivate, and then glutamate, in an ordered manner in which the substrates are
added sequentially. In the structure analyzed here, FPGS is
in ternary complex with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog
Î²,Î³-methylene-ATP (AMPPCP) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (mTHF). These ligands are removed from
the protein prior to analysis. Since both ligands are small,
however, the open[37] and closed (Figure 2) conformers
both yield predictions of roughly the same accuracy when
tested with the single-cut predictors. This is true also for
the two-cut predictor, for which the prediction agreed
almost exactly with the HAG hinge for both open and
closed conformers. Thus the removal of small ligands
from the structural coordinate set does not significantly
affect accuracy, a point explored further in the discussion
of cAPK.
AMPA-Sensitive Glutamate Receptor GluR2 ligand binding
core (closed)
Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are responsible
for fast synaptic transmission between mammalian nerve
cells. iGluRs are a class of transmembrane proteins that
form glutamate-gated ion channels, including the AMPA
receptors GluR1-4. The transmembrane gate of iGluRs
opens briefly in response to glutamate released by a presynaptic cell.

The GluR2 ligand binding core has been crystallized in
progressively more tightly closed conformations, in the

Page 14 of 17

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:215

order of ligand binding apo>DNQX>kainite>glutamate~AMPA. This progression follows the binding affinity (e.g. GluR2 binds glutamate with higher affinity than
kainite, and is more closed when bound with the former)
except that AMPA binds with ~20-fold higher affinity than
glutamate but produces the same effect on the conformation of the ligand binding core. The degree of closure, in
turn, appears to control the receptor activation, as measured in terms of either peak current or steady state current
in presence of the desensitization blocker cyclothiazide.
Thus glutamate and AMPA are full agonists and produce
the same maximal domain closure and consequent activation, whereas kainite is a partial agonist and results in
lesser activation[42].
The well-characterized progressively stronger binding of
the four ligands mentioned provides potentially fertile
ground for motion prediction and ligand binding studies.
In Figure 3 we show FlexOracle's results for the AMPAbound structure. Domain 2 is a contiguous domain, by
which we mean that it spans a single stretch of residues
(106â218 according to the HAG definition), as apposed
to domain 1, which is composed of two stretches 1â105
and 219â261 and is therefore discontiguous in sequence.
Thus all cuts made by the single-cut predictor inside
domain 1 leave domain 2 intact in one of the two fragments and necessarily break up domain 1, On the other
hand, cuts made inside domain 2 break up both domains.
The single-cut predictor graph exhibits a broad, high
"mountain" of energy between the hinge residues 98 and
229, reflecting the cost of fragmenting domain 2. On
either side of this region are broad "shoulders" of low
energy, reflecting only the cost of breaking up domain 1,
which cannot be avoided in a single-cut scheme. A similar
"mountain" and "shoulders" profile can also be seen,
albeit less clearly, for ribose binding protein (Figure 6)
and for GBP and LAO binding protein[37]. The actual
hinges appear not on the clear edges of the mountain but
rather a few residues inside it. This reflects the fact that cutting near residues 98 or 229 keeps both strands of the
close parallel double stranded linker in the same fragment
(fragment 2 or fragment 1, respectively) whereas cutting at
the actual HAG hinge locations would break up the interactions between the strands. Note that this hinge shifting
effect does not occur for ribose binding protein, since the
two strands of the hinge are not closely spaced along their
full length and are not parallel.

inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on human NK cells. LIR and
KIR proteins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily
(IgSF). The extracellular region of LIR-1 contains four IgSF
domains. The structure examined here is a fragment containing domains D1 and D2. The single-cut predictor
results are clearly successful (Figure 4), since this is a single stranded hinge. The result of the two-cut predictor is
likewise quite unequivocal; the method correctly detects
that it is a single-stranded hinge and reports its location.
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) (closed)
Protein kinases modify substrates by transferring a phosphate from a nucleotide (typically ATP) to a free hydroxyl
on a Ser, Thr or Tyr residue. The open conformation of
cAPK appears to be stable in the apo form, as well as in
complex with a peptide inhibitor. The closed form is stable in complex with peptide inhibitor and ATP. ATP precedes the peptide in an apparently preferred binding
order[43].

The closed form is analyzed in Figure 5. FlexOracle strips
the ligands from the protein, therefore one might naively
expect diminished accuracy for the closed (ligand bound)
case. After all, ligands of sufficient size might stabilize one
or another of the rigid domains, and this seems likely to
be the case for the binary complex. However in the trinary
complex the ligand interactions also stabilize the closed
conformation with respect to the open. Therefore separating fragment 1 from fragment 2, assuming i is a hinge residue, can be expected to require less energy without ligand
than with. This argues that removing ligands from the
structure should increase accuracy over the alternative. In
fact the single-cut predictions are roughly as accurate for
the closed conformer as for the open[37]. The two-cut predictor did not work well for either the open or closed conformer of this protein. When one considers that results
were also poor for Troponin C (see Figure 8) it is clear that
the two-cut predictor is not very good at detecting triplestranded hinges.

Under the loose criterion, the two-cut predictor was successful in predicting the hinge.

Ribose binding protein (RBP) (open)
RBP belongs to a sizeable family of soluble gram-negative
bacterial periplasmic binding proteins with diverse ligands and functions. They are abundant and bind their
substrates with high affinity and specificity, and thus easily sequester nutrients appearing in sporadically in the
environment[44] The open conformation is predominant
in the uncomplexed form. Upon ligand binding, the two
separated domains close down around the ligand by virtue of a 30Â° rotation in the hinge that connects them.

Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LIR-1) (closed)
The LIR family is composed of eight human proteins sharing significant sequence identity with LIR-1. LIR proteins
are believed to be inhibitory receptors, similar to killer

Results for the apo form are shown in Figure 6. The singlecut predictor had a strong minimum at residue 103, and a
weak one at residue 235, corresponding to HAG hinges at
those locations. It incorrectly suggests flexible points

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:215

around residues 208 and 50. The two-cut predictor
worked perfectly for both open and closed conformers.
Calmodulin (CaM) (open, calcium-bound form)
CaM is a major calcium-binding protein, regulating
enzymes in many tissues[45]. It is known to exist in
numerous vertebrate and invertebrate animals as well as
plants. In spite of the wide phylogenetic variety of these
organisms, the amino acid sequence of CaM is very highly
conserved, with only seven amino acid substitutions, all
conservative[45]. Troponin C has 50% sequence identity
with CaM[45] and the two share structural features relevant to hinge finding. In particular, both can unwind at
the same point near residue 80, although for Troponin C
the biological significance of this is unknown. The two
bind Ca2+, at the C-terminal lobe, but only CaM binds
Ca2+ at the N-terminal lobe. Correspondingly, the C-terminal lobes in the two proteins are structurally very similar to each other, while the N-terminal lobes are very
different[46]. Both the single cut and the two-cut predictors find the hinge of calcium-free CaM clearly and unambiguously, as can be seen online[37]. For the calciumbound form, the single cut TINKER predictor is ambiguous while the single-cut FoldX predictor is successful. The
two-cut predictor fails completely (Figure 7), thus the
results are mixed. Bound metals often have a significant
stabilizing effect where they appear in proteins, as they are
usually coordinated with multiple points on the polypeptide, and their removal would be expected to destabilize
the protein significantly. The results for this protein suggest that although FlexOracle's neglect of small bound
molecules is of little consequence, the neglect of bound
metals may have a negative effect on the accuracy of the
method. This may reflect the fact that a single divalent
metal ion may have many strong interactions with neighboring protein atoms, whereas a small organic ligand has
weaker interactions distributed over a greater area.
Accordingly, small ligands tend to have significant thermal fluctuations about an equilibrium position, while
metals tend to bind and coordinate neighbors in a very
stable and position-specific manner. We therefore recommend care be taken when using this method for predicting
hinges in metal-bound structures, when those metals
appear to heavily affect the structural and motional characteristics of the protein.

Web interface
Users may submit PDB-formatted files through our Hinge
Prediction page, linked to from the MolMovDB front
page[34]. They will receive an email with instructions on
how to view graphs similar to those shown in figures 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7. In brief, the morph page contains a 'Hinge Analysis' tab which in turn has a link to the FlexOracle results.
Blue diamonds on the single-cut predictor graph indicate
the minima of the single-cut FoldX free energy per the cri-

terion used in this work. Hinges tend to coincide with
minima of the single-cut FlexOracle energy graph, as is
explained in the Discussion of specific proteins section At this
time only the single-cut predictor is run automatically on
all submissions, but users may contact the author to have
the two-cut predictor run on any submitted protein. The
user should bear in mind that results may be of limited
accuracy for membrane proteins and proteins bound to
complexes or large substrates. If metals strongly affect the
stability and motion of the protein, as is the case for EF
hands, this may also limit accuracy. Lastly, if the hinge
seems sterically unreasonable the reader should consider
the possibility that the hinge has three or more strands or
the motion is not hingelike.
The results of running FlexOracle and other hinge prediction algorithms on the HAG can be seen on our website[37]. Links to the corresponding morph page and
detailed predictor results are provided. A full explanation
of how to interact with the morph page is given in prior
work[47].

Conclusion
The ability of FlexOracle to predict the hinge location for
domain hinge bending proteins was demonstrated. We
found that FlexOracle gives similar results for apo and ligand bound structures when the ligand is a small molecule
or molecules. However mixed results for the calcium
bound form of calmodulin suggest care should be exercised when applying the method to proteins with bound
metals. We further found that hinges often coincide with
minima of the single-cut FlexOracle energy, but in the case
of two-domain proteins comprised of one contiguous and
one discontiguous domain, the hinge can occur instead
near the boundary between a broad "mountain" of high
energy (corresponding to the contiguous domain) and
wide "shoulders" of low energy (corresponding to the discontiguous domain). Further, if the linker consists of
closely spaced parallel strands, the hinge tends to occur a
few residues into the "mountain" side of this boundary.
Aside from the matter of bound metals, these issues are
not a concern for the two-cut predictor, which is significantly more accurate than the single-cut predictor. The
former works well for single as well as double stranded
hinges, but not for triple-stranded hinges. The FlexOracle
method addresses directly the problem of locating the primary hinge for hinge bending proteins.
