Abstract
Background: Olea europaea L. is a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean basin with a
worldwide economical high impact. Differently from other fruit tree species, little is known about
the physiological and molecular basis of the olive fruit development and a few sequences of genes
and gene products are available for olive in public databases. This study deals with the identification
of large sets of differentially expressed genes in developing olive fruits and the subsequent
computational annotation by means of different software.
Results: mRNA from fruits of the cv. Leccino sampled at three different stages [i.e., initial fruit set
(stage 1), completed pit hardening (stage 2) and veraison (stage 3)] was used for the identification
of differentially expressed genes putatively involved in main processes along fruit development.
Four subtractive hybridization libraries were constructed: forward and reverse between stage 1
and 2 (libraries A and B), and 2 and 3 (libraries C and D). All sequenced clones (1,132 in total) were
analyzed through BlastX against non-redundant NCBI databases and about 60% of them showed
similarity to known proteins. A total of 89 out of 642 differentially expressed unique sequences was
further investigated by Real-Time PCR, showing a validation of the SSH results as high as 69%.
Library-specific cDNA repertories were annotated according to the three main vocabularies of the
gene ontology (GO): cellular component, biological process and molecular function. BlastX
analysis, GO terms mapping and annotation analysis were performed using the Blast2GO software,
a research tool designed with the main purpose of enabling GO based data mining on sequence sets
for which no GO annotation is yet available. Bioinformatic analysis pointed out a significantly
different distribution of the annotated sequences for each GO category, when comparing the three
fruit developmental stages. The olive fruit-specific transcriptome dataset was used to query all
known KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) metabolic pathways for
characterizing and positioning retrieved EST records. The integration of the olive sequence
datasets within the MapMan platform for microarray analysis allowed the identification of specific

biosynthetic pathways useful for the definition of key functional categories in time course analyses
for gene groups.
Conclusion: The bioinformatic annotation of all gene sequences was useful to shed light on
metabolic pathways and transcriptional aspects related to carbohydrates, fatty acids, secondary
metabolites, transcription factors and hormones as well as response to biotic and abiotic stresses
throughout olive drupe development. These results represent a first step toward both functional
genomics and systems biology research for understanding the gene functions and regulatory
networks in olive fruit growth and ripening.

Background
Fruit development is the result of genetically programmed
processes influenced by environmental factors. To identify and characterize genes involved in these processes,
different genomic approaches (ESTs, large-scale microarrays, deep transcriptome profiling, etc.) have been used in
several fruit species [1] and the body of information concerning transcriptional networks and regulatory circuits
involved in important physiological and developmental
processes increased tremendously during the last two decades. In tomato, large-scale EST sequencing projects
resulted in a better insight into molecular mechanisms of
fruit ripening processes and in the identification of common transcription factors not previously associated with
ripening [2,3]. Generation of ESTs and consequent discovery of genes with potential roles in fruit development
have also been reported in grape berry [4,5]. In apple, an
extensive analysis has been made using all EST sequences
available in public databases to identify genes temporally
or spatially regulated during fruit growth and development [6]. Other extensive EST sequencing projects focusing on fruit development have been set up in peach [7],
melon [8] and kiwifruit [9]. Sequence information
derived from advanced EST sequencing is an essential
resource for functional genomics studies based on the use
of microarray technology and real-time PCR. Following
the pioneering work of Aharoni and co-workers [10] on
strawberry, several papers have now been published on
the use of microarrays in different fruit species.
Olea europaea L. is an evergreen species, traditionally cultivated in the Mediterranean basin. The oil that results
from mechanical extraction of the fruits is a predominant
component of the worldwide known 'Mediterranean diet',
to which increasing attention is being paid for its health
benefits and cancer-protective properties [11]. These
attributes are closely related to the oil composition and to
the concentration of active bio-molecules resulting from
the catabolic and anabolic processes taking place throughout olive fruit development which is a long process lasting
several months. The oil content of olives can reach up to
30% (fresh weight) at full ripening [12]: it accumulates in
the mesocarp and, at a lower extent, in the seed [13]. Oil
accumulation in the pulp increases slowly, reaching the

plateau after veraison. A marked tryacylglycerol (TAG)
accumulation in seed and pulp occurs after endocarp lignification, when about 40 mg of oil per fruit per week can
be synthesized. The fatty acid profile of the oil accumulating in the fruit is important in relation to its nutritional
properties [11]. The main fatty acid is oleic acid (C18:1),
which represents about 75% of total fatty acids, followed
by linoleic (C18:2), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0) and
linolenic (C18:3) acid. The pattern of fatty acid synthesis
and desaturation varies during maturation and ripening,
according to cultivars and to environmental conditions
[14,15]. Other important metabolites accumulate
throughout olive fruit development. They include
polyphenols [16], carotenoids [17], chlorophylls [18],
sterols and terpenoids [19] all directly or indirectly affecting olive oil quality and its technological and nutritional
properties.
Information concerning genetic regulation of these metabolic processes in olive is still very limited. Only few genes
involved in fatty acid metabolism have been characterized
[13,20-24]. A monosaccharide transporter (OeMST2),
whose expression increases during fruit maturation, when
a massive accumulation of sugars occurs, has been
recently cloned [25]. Moreover, the gene encoding a geranylgeranyl reductase (OeCHLP) has been isolated and its
role in organ development and stress response in relation
to tocopherol action hypothesized [26]. Information at
molecular level about polyphenol and triterpenoid
metabolism is lacking, as well as the mechanisms
involved in olive fruit development and ripening.
Among different strategies available for identifying differentially expressed genes, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries have been successfully used in fruit
science to elucidate mechanisms regulating anthocyanin
metabolism in grape berries [27], proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in persimmon [28], processes involved in early
growth and ethylene-induced ripening in banana [29,30],
and in orange pigmentation [31].
This paper deals with the identification via SSH of large
repertories of differentially expressed genes in developing
olive fruits, and their computational annotation by means

of different bioinformatic software. The identification and
characterization of gene regulatory networks and key metabolic pathways during fruit growth and development
represent a prerequisite for improving olive oil quality
and its health-related properties.

Results
The study was based on the preparation of cDNA libraries
using SSH that, likewise to the differential display (DD),
represents an efficient strategy to isolate genes with an
antagonist expression pattern. This technique enabled to
identify transcripts of genes differentially expressed
among the three different developmental stages of olive
fruit corresponding to initial fruit set (30 DAF), completed pit hardening (90 DAF) and veraison (130 DAF)
(Figure 1).
As far as the composition of the four subtractive libraries
is concerned, the number of differentially expressed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/128

sequences randomly chosen varied from a minimum of
236 to a maximum of 317 per library, with a total number
of clones equal to 1,132 (Table 1). The average length of
the cDNA clones was 597 bp with a wide range of variation, from 48 up to 1,283 bp. The redundancy within each
single library was relatively low, ranging between 1.7%
and 5.3%. Taking into account the whole set of sequences,
the overall redundancy calculated among the four libraries was equal to 3.7%. The sequences of each single library
were preliminarily analyzed using the CAP3 program in
order to isolate the singlets and assemble contiguous and
overlapping clones into contigs. This affected the comparative redundancy that increased up to 6.2%.
Querying with cDNA sequences the non-redundant NCBI
databases allowed the attribution of a BLAST hit of 79%,
91%, 88% and 78% of the clones belonging to the A, B, C
and D libraries, respectively (Table 2). The average
sequence similarity was around 76%, ranging from 72%
to 80%, and the median E-value for each single library
ranged from 1e-47 to 1e-77.
Around 75% of the BLAST hits of the olive fruit cDNA
sequences were homologous to coding sequences present
in the rice, Arabidopsis and grapevine genomes, with more
than 1,000 hits per species. It is worthy to note that until
now (June 2009) only 47 BLAST hits for olive could be
recorded (Figure 2).

Olive fruit growth and developmental stages considered for SSH library construction. (A) Olive fruit (cv
Leccino) growth curve expressed as fresh weight (g) accumulation. Pericarp was sampled at initial fruit set (stage 1, 30
days after flowering, DAF), end of pit hardening (stage 2, 90
DAF), and veraison (stage 3, 130 DAF). (B) Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed by
comparing samples collected at stages 1 and 2 (libraries A
and B), and at stages 2 and 3 (libraries C and D). For the two
forward libraries A and C, cDNA from samples collected at
stages 1 and 2, respectively, were used as tester and cDNA
from stages 2 and 3, respectively, were used as drivers, vice
versa for the reverse subtractive libraries B and D.

The computational analysis of the whole EST collection
using the software Blast2GO allowed the annotation of
the expressed sequences according to the terms of the
three main Gene Ontology vocabularies, i.e. cellular compartment, molecular function and biological process (Figure 3). As far as cellular compartments are concerned, the
most represented are plastids and mitochondria, with
more than 50% of the total annotations, followed by
cytosol, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and
nucleoplasm, whereas other cellular compartments were
represented at a much lower scale (Figure 3A). Concerning the molecular function, the most represented categories were those of nucleotide binding proteins, followed
by proteins with transport, kinase and enzymatic activities. The other molecular functions were represented at a
lower extent (Figure 3B). More than 30 categories were
found for the biological process vocabulary, being carbohydrate metabolism, response to biotic and environmental stresses, generation of precursors, metabolites and
energy, and catabolic processes the most represented (Figure 3C). Although numerically less represented, it is worth
to mention the presence of terms related to the secondary
metabolites, metabolism of lipids, synthesis of amino
acids and derivatives, metabolites and their precursors,
and protein modification process.

Focusing on the GO annotation of each single subtractive
library, a number of olive fruit stage-specific GO terms
were identified (Figure 4). Among the 296 and 464 GO
terms found in the A and B libraries, 75 and 101 were
associated to down- and up-regulated genes, respectively.
The most significant GO terms were encoding elements of
hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction mediated
by ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and abscisic
acid, as well as biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
such as terpenoids. In the C and D libraries, a total of 375
and 549 GO terms were recovered, 78 and 183 of which
were related to down- and up-regulated genes, respectively. Among these, there are GO terms associated to
environmental stress responses, catabolism of secondary
metabolites (as terpenes, limonene and carotene),
response to hormones (gibberellins and cytokinins), and
auxin signal transduction.
The analysis of GO terms shared by pair-wise library combinations allows to determine which genes are continuously or transiently down- or up-regulated during the
studied process. This analysis retrieved only 7 terms for
the down-regulated genes, whereas as many as 69 were
those collected among the up-regulated ones. On the contrary, comparable numbers (21 vs. 25) of GO terms associated to transiently up- and down-regulated genes among
the three fruit developmental stages were found (Figure
5).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments were carried out
to corroborate the expression patterns of a subset of

sequences (i.e. 89 out of 642 unisequences, equal to
14%), corresponding to 61 different genes. Expression
patterns related to the selected gene sequences and estimated in pair-wise comparisons between the three different fruit stages are reported in Figure 6. The Real-Time
PCR analyses validated the results from SSH experiments
for 42 out of 61 genes (about 69%). The validated genes
were grouped according to different expression patterns
(Additional file 1).
The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
was queried for sequences encoding enzymes and the
deduced gene products were associated to specific metabolic and/or biosynthetic pathways related to carbohydrates, fatty acid and secondary metabolism. The most
represented KEGG maps associated with carbohydrate
and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism were organized in a simple network analysis representative of major
communication ways among retrieved metabolic pathways (Additional files 3 and 4). As expected, several genes
encoding enzymes related to carbohydrate and fatty acid
compounds were transcriptionally up- or down-regulated
during olive fruit development. Several components of
the carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms
(Map:00710), and starch and sucrose metabolism
(Map:00500) were modulated in their expression in the
early stages of fruit development (30-90 DAF). KEGG
maps analysis pointed out an intense up-regulation of the
majority of enzymes related to the pentose phosphate
pathway (Map:00030), glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
(Map:00010) along with starch and sucrose metabolism

(Map:00500) (Additional file 3). Table 3 reports the
enzymes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Transcripts of enzymes
involved in the synthesis of pyruvate from β-D-fructose-6P, such as 6-phosphofructokinase (ec:2.7.1.11), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ec:1.2.1.12), phosphoglycerate kinase (e.c:2.7.2.3), phosphopyruvate
hydratase (e.c:4.2.1.11) and pyruvate kinase (ec:2.7.1.40)
were up-regulated from 30 to 90 DAF and down-regulated
from 90 DAF to 130 DAF (Table 3).
Consistent with the accumulation of oil in the drupe that
starts around pit hardening and reaches the highest rate
well before ripening begins, several transcripts encoding
enzymes leading to fatty acid biosynthesis (Map:00061)
from glycolysis (Map:00010), through the pyruvate
metabolism (Map:00620) and citrate cycle (Map:00020)
were up-regulated (Additional file 4). It is worthy to mention that several enzymes were found to be up-regulated
from 30 to 90 DAF, when the lipid accumulation shows

an increasing rate. A similar dynamics in terms of specific
transcript accumulation was recorded for several components of the FA biosynthesis as acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ec:6.4.1.2) and enoyl- [acyl-carrier-protein] reductase
(ec:1.3.1.9), actively involved in the synthesis of malonylCoA and FA chain elongation, respectively (Table 4).
Moreover, enzymes controlling FA chain elongation were
up-regulated throughout fruit development, whereas the
synthesis of short chain FAs was impaired during early
development. The malonylCoA-ACP transacylase
(ec:2.3.1.39), the enzyme involved in one of the early
steps of FA biosynthesis, and the acyl- [acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase (ec:1.14.19.2), related to the synthesis of
hexadecenoyl- [acp] and octadecenoyl- [acp], the precursors of palmitic and oleic acid, respectively, were up-regulated at veraison as well as a number of genes involved in
the FA metabolism (Table 4).
KEGG maps were also produced for secondary metabolic
pathways. Considering the flavonoids as an example, the

isoforms of four different enzymes (i.e. dihydrokaempferol 4-reductase, flavanone 3-dioxygenase, naringeninchalcone synthase, and leucocyanidin oxygenase) controlling flavone and flavonol as well as anthocyanin biosynthesis were mapped (Figure 7). Transcripts encoding these

enzymes were more abundant during the transition from
90 to 130 DAF, thus suggesting an increased accumulation of the related metabolites during late fruit development.

involved in alkaloid biosynthesis (Map:00950;

(Map:00903) and caffeine metabolism (Map:00232)
were also identified (Additional file 5).

The analysis of the olive EST dataset with the MapMan
software enabled to reconstruct overview metabolism
maps (Additional file 6) and to group sequences in the
main regulatory networks (Figure 8). As far as the in silico
expression analysis of all olive EST clones linked to the
Arabidopsis genechip sequences (Affymetrix), most genes
proved to be associated to constantly and transiently regulated genes during fruit development involved in cell
wall synthesis and breakdown, fatty acid biosynthesis and
lipid breakdown, starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, and secondary metabolism (i.e., terpenoids and flavonoids). Gene products involved in amino acid
biosynthesis and metabolism were also identified (Additional file 6). Furthermore, several genes encoding transcription factors were mainly down-regulated throughout
fruit development, while some others were related to protein modification and degradation (Figure 8). Genes
related to hormone biosynthesis and action appeared to
be differently regulated according to the type of hormone.
A down-regulation of genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and metabolism, as an oxido/reductase and an IAAamino acid synthase, occurred between 30 and 90 DAF,
while during late development the expression of auxin
responsive factors such as ARF1 and ARF7, were up- and
down-regulated, respectively. By contrast, the synthesis of
abscisic acid (ABA) was clearly stimulated throughout
development, since two key enzymes encoded by ABA2
(ABA DEFICIENT 2) and AAO3 (ABSCISIC ALDEHYDE
OXIDASE 3), were up-regulated at completed pit-hardening and veraison, respectively. In addition, a down-regulation of a gene encoding a GA-regulated protein occurred
between completed pit hardening and veraison. During
the same developmental phase, an up-regulation of the
ARR1, a protein involved in the citokinin response, as well
as a down-regulation of an UGT2, encoding a UDP-glucosyl transferase, actively involved in the metabolism of the
hormone, were observed. Genes involved in jasmonic
acid (JA) metabolism were up-regulated throughout fruit
development. A transcriptional up-regulation of an ethylene receptor of the ERS type as well as a down-regulation
of genes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis
and action were observed during early development.
Taking into account genes related to biotic and abiotic
stress responses, dual multiple contingency tests were performed to identify GO terms associated to sequences significantly and antagonistically distributed between
libraries. The results of this analysis evidenced the abundance of sequences related to light stimulus
(GO:0009416) and radiation (GO:0009314), as well as to
biotic and abiotic stresses (Table 5). Sequences related to
light stimulus and radiation resulted to be up-regulated
from 30 to 60 DAF, while those associated with response
to oxidative stresses were down-regulated during the same
developmental period.

Discussion
Olea europaea L. is a common tree species of the Mediterranean basin that plays a peculiar role in the landscape
characterization and represents a major agricultural commodity as source of olive oil. Olives are not only a significant food source, but also contribute to human health
and are becoming popular in health-conscious diets far
beyond the Mediterranean area of olive oil traditional use.
Taking into account the increasing worldwide commercial
interest of olive oil and the lack of information on its
genomic features, a functional genomic approach, able to
gain insights into the genetic and molecular aspects controlling fruit development and ripening, may be considered of primary interest.

A number of physiological and biochemical data is available on growth, development and ripening of the olive
drupe but, unlike other fruit species such as peach, apple
and grape, information on olive gene sequences and gene
products is very limited in the main public gene databases. This study was carried out on cv. Leccino, one of the
most widespread Italian varieties, characterized by a relatively short fruit developmental cycle, and a high degree of
synchronization of processes defining ripening.
The SSH approach allowed the identification of 1,132 differentially expressed gene sequences in three selected
developmental stages of the olive fruit, named initial fruit
set (30 DAF), completed pit hardening (90 DAF) and

veraison (130 DAF). All the sequences were deposited in
the NCBI databases on August 28, 2008 [GenBank:
FL683310-FL684411, ESTdb: 60119979-60121080]. This
contribution represented a major implementation of the
public olive EST repertories that currently include a total
number of 3,859 sequences (last verified on July 27,
2009).
The SSH technique confirmed its suitability for transcriptome studies and for identifying genes differentially
expressed along fruit development in olive. In fact, of the
1,132 differentially expressed sequences as many as 642
demonstrated to be unique sequences. Among these, 89
(14%) corresponding to 61 different key genes, further
investigated by quantitative Real-Time PCR, pointed out a
validation of SSH findings as high as 69%
Olive fruits showed significant differences for the distribution of GO terms among ontological vocabularies and categories in relation to the developmental stages. GO terms
involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid and flavonoid metabolism were analyzed by setting up KEGG maps. As far as
carbohydrates are concerned, genes involved in carbohy-

drate metabolism were modulated in their expression
and, in particular, the expression pattern of genes related
to starch metabolism was coherent with a temporary role
of starch as storage compound during fruit early development. Sequences of enzymes involved within the pentose
phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,
along with starch and sucrose metabolism, were up-regulated. The up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes
involved in the synthesis of pyruvate from different substrates occurring during early development, may indicate
that the fruit at this stage is highly energy demanding.
There are two sources of assimilates for fruit growth in
olive. The major source is certainly the sugars translocated
in the phloem from leaves or sites of storage, comprising
mannitol, raffinose, stachyose, and sucrose [32]. The secondary source is sugars formed by photosynthesis in
developing fruits themselves that remain green for a considerable period and retain active chlorophyll even when
they change colour as approaching maturity. While chlorophyll is mostly in the exocarp, the mesocarp has been
shown to contain significant amounts of phosphoenol
pyruvate [12], the CO2 fixation enzyme of the CAM and
C4 photosynthetic pathway.

Figure 7
KEGG pathway for flavonoid biosynthesis (Map:00941)
KEGG pathway for flavonoid biosynthesis (Map:00941). The isoforms of four different enzymes (i.e. dihydrokaempferol
4-reductase, ec:1.1.1.219; flavanone 3-dioxygenase, ec:1.14.11.9; naringenin-chalcone synthase, ec:2.3.1.74; and leucocyanidin
oxygenase, ec:1.14.11.19) controlling flavone and flavonol as well as anthocyanin biosynthesis were mapped (see also Additional
file 5).

Genes related to fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis appeared to
be up-regulated throughout development although transcripts of specific enzymes accumulate at different extent
depending on the developmental stage. Enzymes controlling FA chain elongation were up-regulated throughout
fruit development: the synthesis of short chain FAs was
impaired during early development whereas the synthesis
of the precursors of palmitoleic and oleic acids was upregulated during late development. This finding is consistent with the oil accumulation pattern in olive mesocarp,
that starts around 40-60 DAF and reaches at ripening the
highest amount, confirming what previously observed
[20,21]. A number of genes involved in the FA metabolism appeared to be differentially expressed throughout
development with a significant up-regulation at veraison.
This might be interpreted as a homeostatic reaction to the
large FA accumulation occurring at this developmental
stage.

Taking into account the secondary metabolites, genes
involved in phenylpropanoid and alkaloid biosynthesis
and caffeine, limonene and pinene metabolism appeared
to be differentially expressed throughout fruit development. Dihydrokaempferol 4-reductase, flavanone 3-dioxygenase,
naringenin-chalcone
synthase,
and
leucocyanidin oxygenase, four enzymes controlling flavone and flavonol, as well as anthocyanin biosynthesis,
were up-regulated from 90 to 130 DAF, thus suggesting an
increased accumulation of the related metabolites during
late development. Flavonoids are important secondary
metabolites precursor of flavonols and anthocyanins, the
latter being responsible of the color development occurring at ripening. Key genes related to the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (chalcone synthase, CHS, flavanone 3hydroxylase, F3H, dihydroflavonol reductase, DFR, and
anthocyanidin synthase, ANS) proved to be up-regulated
at veraison stage. A similar coordinated up-regulation of

Figure 8
Regulatory network map constructed with MapMan software using the olive fruit EST dataset
Regulatory network map constructed with MapMan software using the olive fruit EST dataset. Several genes
encoding transcription factors were mainly down-regulated throughout fruit development, while some others were related to
protein modification and degradation. Genes related to the biosynthesis and action of IAA, ABA, GA, ethylene, cytokinins, JAs
and SA appeared to be differently regulated according to the type of hormone.

these genes has been observed in grape berries at the onset
of ripening, at the time of pigmentation changes [33].
The relatively high abundance of transcripts related to
hormones supports their key regulatory role in olive fruit
development, as demonstrated in several other fruits [34].
The synthesis of ABA is clearly stimulated throughout fruit
development, as demonstrated by the up-regulation of
two key enzymes of its biosynthetic pathway. The pattern
of expression changed according to the type of hormone.
The observed down-regulation of genes involved in auxin
biosynthesis and metabolism is consistent with a lowering of the auxin content reported in other fruits throughout development. The different regulation of auxin
responsive factors, such as ARF1 and ARF7, which act as
negative and positive regulators of IAA responsive genes,
respectively [35], might imply a decreased sensitivity to

the hormone during late fruit development. This is consistent with a negative regulation of auxin on the onset of
the ripening syndrome observed in non climacteric fruits.
At late developmental stage, a down regulation of the zeatin O-glucosyltransferase 2, actively involved in CK
metabolism, as well as an up-regulation of ARR1, a protein involved in the CK response, have been observed.
ARR1 is a type-B ARR transcription factor involved in CKresponsive phenomena. It has been proposed that ARR1,
together with ARR10 and ARR12, redundantly play pivotal roles in the AHK-dependent phosphorelay signaling
in response to CK [36]. Taking into account that CK metabolic enzymes are up-regulated by the hormone, these
transcriptional changes may reflect a lowering of CK concentration, along with an increase of fruit sensitivity to CK
occurring during late development. The veraison is a
developmental stage characterized by a strengthening of

the fruit sink action, that, also in olive, might be regulated
by a complex hormone cross-talk and interaction, as demonstrated in other non climacteric fruits as grape berries
[37]. In spite of any signal variation in terms of expression
of genes related to ethylene biosynthesis, an up-regulation
of an ERS type ethylene receptor has been observed during
early fruit development. This might imply an increase in
sensitivity of the fruitlet to ethylene, the hormone
involved in the regulation of the immature fruit physiological drop that in olive occurs between fruit set and pit
hardening [38]. Genes involved in the jasmonates (JAs)
metabolism and brassinosteroids (BRs) biosynthesis were
up- and down regulated, respectively. If the gene expression pattern is mirrored by a similar evolution of JA and
BR concentration in fruit tissues, this would indicate that
the role of JAs and BRs in olive is different from other fruit
types such as peach and grape. In fact, in peach it has been
demonstrated that JAs delay fruit ripening [39], while BRs
stimulate the onset of veraison in grape berry [40].
The dual multiple contingency tests allowed the identification of GO terms related to biotic and abiotic stress
responses significantly and antagonistically distributed
between libraries. The transcriptional profile of genes
related to light, temperature and biotic stresses parallels
the dynamics of day length and light intensity, both peaking at the pit hardening stage. Moreover, these data may
indicate that genes responding to environmental stimuli
are transcriptionally regulated up to pit hardening, and
post-transcriptionally up to the veraison.

Conclusion
As a concluding remark, the SSH technique allowed to
identify a set of 642 differentially expressed unique
sequences. Among these, 89 (14%) corresponding to 61
different key genes were further investigated by Real-Time
PCR, pointing out a validation of the SSH results as high

as 69%. The bioinformatic annotation of all gene
sequences was useful to shed light on metabolic pathways
and to understand specific regulatory networks. In fact,
data here reported represent a significant contribution to
the elucidation of transcriptional aspects related to carbohydrates, FAs, secondary metabolites, transcription factors
and hormones as well as response to biotic and abiotic
stresses. Particularly interesting are data related to hormones, pointing out the complexity of the role played by
these compounds in olive fruit development and ripening.
These molecular and bioinformatic data represent a first
step toward both functional genomics and systems biology research for understanding the gene functions and
regulatory networks in olive fruit growth, development
and ripening.

Methods
Plant material
In an orchard located nearby Perugia (Italy), growth of
olive (Olea europaea L., cv Leccino) fruits was determined
by monitoring fresh weight accumulation. Olive samples
were collected at 30 days after flowering (DAF) (initial
fruit set, stage 1), 90 DAF (completed pit hardening, stage
2) and 130 DAF (veraison, stage 3)] (Figure 1).
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from pericarp of about 16 fruits
for each sampling date, using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(Qiagen). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed
from total RNA by two DNase treatments. The first was
performed using the RNase-Free-DNase Set (Qiagen) during RNA isolation procedure. After sample elution, total
RNA was treated with DNAse I (Promega). The RNA aqueous method (Ambion) was applied to purify total RNA
from phenolic compounds and other substances that

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:128

could inhibit reverse transcription. The RNA was quantified by both, spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis
on a denaturing agarose gel. The mRNA was isolated from
about 400 μg of total RNA for each sample using oligo dT
cellulose resin.
cDNA synthesis and library construction
For all samples, the first strand cDNA was synthesized
with reverse transcriptase using oligo dT primer, modified
for a tail containing RsaI restriction site. The second strand
was synthesized by incubating the first strand cDNA with
DNA polymerase I, RNAse H and DNA ligase at 16°C for
2.5 hrs. T4 polymerase was added to blunt the ends of the
cDNA to facilitate the ligation of adapters in the later
steps. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform. Subtracted and reverse subtracted cDNA libraries
were constructed using a combination of a PCR-based
subtraction kit (Clontech) and a unique subtraction procedure (Rx Biosciences). Four subtracted cDNA libraries
have been constructed to compare samples collected at 30
and 90 DAF (libraries A and B) and samples at 90 and 130
DAF (libraries C and D) (Figure 1). For the two forward
libraries A and C, cDNA from samples collected at 30 and
90 DAF, respectively, were used as tester and cDNA from
90 and 130 DAF, respectively, were used as drivers, vice
versa for the reverse subtractive libraries B and D. For DNA
isolation alkaline lyses method was followed. The clones
were grown in 0.5 ml of Terrific Broth (TB) overnight in
96 well plates. An aliquot was saved for glycerol stocks.
Rest culture was centrifuged in HT-6000BSorvall centrifuge and re-suspended in P-1 buffer. Following re-suspension, buffer P-2 was added to lyse the cells. After 2 min,
buffer P3 was added to neutralize the solutions. The lysate
was transferred to 96-well filter plates then the centrifugation was performed at 2,000 g for 2 min. The clear lysate
thus obtained was mixed with 0.7 volumes of ethanol and
centrifuged at 6,500 g in HT-6000B centrifuge for 20 min.
The pellet was once washed with 70% ethanol, dried dissolved and re-suspended in 50 μL of sterile water. The
complete analysis was performed using CLC Combined
Workbench 3 software. The sequence data were imported
in the directory files of the software. The software has data
bank of various vectors in use for library construction, if
not it was imported from Manufacture's web site (Invitrogen). The sequence data were mass aligned with the vector
and the sequences homologous to vector were mass
trimmed. The vector trimmed sequences were mass
blasted in batches using CLC software. The resulting files
were saved and exported into Microsoft excel format. The
sequencing was performed using ABI3700 automatic
DNA sequencers using 25-50 ng of DNA template according to manufactures protocol. These experimental steps
have been performed at Rx Biosciences Lab (Rockville,
MD, USA).

Gene Ontology annotation
Nucleotide sequences retrieved by SSH were screened for
vector contamination by using a home made BioPearl
script. Once cleaned by vector residuals, all sequences
were used for contig assembly by using a web interface of
the CAP3 software (CAP3, http://deepc2.psi.iastate.edu/
aat/cap/cap.html, [41]) and redundancy within and
among libraries were calculated as ratio of sequences
belonging to a contig out of the total sequences considered. Computational annotation of the four olive EST
datasets was performed using the Blast2GO software
v1.3.3 (http://www.blast2go.org, [42,43] as described in
[44] with minor modifications. Briefly, a sequence length
threshold of 200 bp was considered for all libraries and
used to split the datasets in according to the length. BlastX
algorithm was used for both short and long sequence
datasets with different parameters according to the length.
Blast expectation value threshold was constantly set to 10,
whereas HSP length cutoff was set at 15 and 33, respectively. Similarly, the Blast2GO software v1.3.3 was used to
obtain GO information from retrieved database matches.
Annotation of all sequences was performed by using
default parameters on the two ranges of length previously
described. Furthermore, InterPro Scan [45] was performed to find functional motifs and related GO terms by
using the specific tool implemented in the Blast2GO software with the default parameters. Finally, the 'Augment
Annotation by ANNEX' function was used to refine annotations (http://www.goat.no, [46]). The GOslim
'goslim_plant.obo' was used to achieve specific GO terms
by means of a plant-specific reduced version of the Gene
Ontology http://geneontology.org.

Annotation distribution among originated libraries was
represented by Venn diagrams by computing all retrieved
annotation with the VennMaster software with the default
parameters http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/ni/staff/
HKestler/vennm/doc.html.
Enzyme mapping of annotated sequences was done by
direct GO to Enzyme annotation and used to query the
Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG http://www.genome.jp/kegg/, [47-49]) to define the main
metabolic pathways involved.
MapMan http://gabi.rzpd.de/projects/MapMan/ analysis
was done using the olive dataset properly rearranged as
input files. The Arabidopsis proteome was downloaded
from
ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/
TAIR8_genome_release/TAIR8_sequences/ and the olive
transcriptome dataset used as query for local BLASTX
analysis. Once blasted, the Arabidopsis AGI code relative
to all BLAST hits with an E-value equal or greater than E-6
were recovered by means of an home made Perl script.

Retrieved AGI codes were then converted in ATH1121501 genechip identifiers (Affymetrix) by using the
PhyloGenie
web
interface
http://bioinfos
erver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/utils/affytrees/; [50]). For each
library, an arbitrary expression values were assigned to all
EST-linked Affymetrix identifiers, and the originated dataset used as input form for subsequent MapMan analysis.
Finally, a time course representation of whole olive EST
dataset related to primary and secondary metabolites and
cellular processes environment was done by mapping the
datasets within the appropriate MapMan pathways.
Real-Time PCR analysis
Quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments were carried out
to validate some of the genes isolated by SSH and characterized by GO. Among the whole dataset of non-redundant sequences, 89 gene sequences belonging to key
biosynthetic and metabolic pathways were selected
according to the length (over 100 bp) and e-value (higher
than 1E-6). All cDNAs were prepared from fruits collected
at three developmental stages (30, 90, and 120 DAF), corresponding to the ones used for the construction of SSH
libraries, using the Super Script Reverse Transcriptase kit
(Invitrogen).

Specific primer pairs for each of the sequences were
designed (Additional file 7) and tested for their activity at
60°C by conventional PCR. Different primers were also
designed to discriminate putative isoforms. Quantitative
Real-Time RT-PCR analyses were then performed using a
thermal cycler 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) equipped with a 96 well plates system with the
SYBR green PCR Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystem).
All Real-Time PCR experiments were performed with two
independent sets of RNA samples: each analysis was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of cDNA
diluted 1:50, 0,3 μM of each primer, and 10 μl of 2× SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The following thermal cycling profile was
used for all PCRs: 95°C for 20 sec, 50 cycles of 95°C for
10 s and 60°C for 1 min. All quantifications were normalized to the Olea europaea Elongation Factor 1 gene used as
housekeeping gene and amplified in the same conditions.
Data resulting from quantitative Real-Time PCR were corrected on the basis of the housekeeping gene by the ΔΔCt
method. Pair-wise analyses of gene expression values at
the three developmental stages were performed by comparing fruit stages (2 versus 1 and 3 versus 2). These two
series of ratios were treated by Cluster 3.0 software [51].
All data were normalized and transformed in a logarithmic scale to compare expression levels of all genes and
group them according to expression patterns.

MAPMAN map. Overview MAPMAN metabolism map showing several
constantly and transiently up- and down-regulated genes related to cell
wall synthesis and breakdown, fatty acid biosynthesis and lipid breakdown, starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, Calvin cycle and the secondary metabolism (e.g., terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols). Signal colors:
blue and green correspond to up-regulated genes between olive stages 1
and 2, and 2 and 3, respectively, whereas red and yellow correspond to
down-regulated genes between olive stages 1 and 2, and 2 and 3, respectively; cyan and violet indicate, respectively, constantly up-regulated and
down-regulated genes from olive stage 1 to stage 3; gray and orange indicate, respectively, transiently down- and up-regulated genes.
