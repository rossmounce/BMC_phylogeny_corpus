Abstract
Background: Assignment of function to new molecular sequence data is an essential step in
genomics projects. The usual process involves similarity searches of a given sequence against one
or more databases, an arduous process for large datasets.
Results: We present AutoFACT, a fully automated and customizable annotation tool that assigns
biologically informative functions to a sequence. Key features of this tool are that it (1) analyzes
nucleotide and protein sequence data; (2) determines the most informative functional description
by combining multiple BLAST reports from several user-selected databases; (3) assigns putative
metabolic pathways, functional classes, enzyme classes, GeneOntology terms and locus names; and
(4) generates output in HTML, text and GFF formats for the user's convenience. We have
compared AutoFACT to four well-established annotation pipelines. The error rate of functional
annotation is estimated to be only between 1–2%. Comparison of AutoFACT to the traditional
top-BLAST-hit annotation method shows that our procedure increases the number of functionally
informative annotations by approximately 50%.
Conclusion: AutoFACT will serve as a useful annotation tool for smaller sequencing groups
lacking dedicated bioinformatics staff. It is implemented in PERL and runs on LINUX/UNIX
platforms. AutoFACT is available at http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/Software/AutoFACT.htm.

Background
Automatic functional annotation is essential for highthroughput sequencing projects. Typically, large datasets
undergo annotation by means of "annotation jamborees", where groups of experts are assigned to manually
annotate a designated portion of an organism's genome.
More recently, various tools have become available to
streamline this process [1-9]. However, limitations
encountered with these tools are that many require websubmission of data [2], need substantial manual interven-

tion [1,4], supply only a single output format, are part of
a large sequence analysis package [3] and most importantly, do not combine a broad range of information
resources. To address these shortcomings, we developed a
new annotation pipeline, which we term "AutoFACT".
Unique to AutoFACT, is its hierarchal filtering system for
determining the most informative functional annotation.
This paper describes AutoFACT's functional assignment
capabilities, outlining the procedure for annotating

unknown nucleotide or protein sequence data. We assess
the validity of AutoFACT by comparing annotations to
four previously annotated and phylogenetically diverse
organisms, including human, yeast and both eukaryotic
and bacterial pathogens. AutoFACT has been applied to
the EST sequencing project of Acanthamoeba castellanii, a
free-living soil amoeba and opportunistic human pathogen. This example highlights AutoFACT's performance,
which yields a ~50% increase in functional annotations
over a top-BLAST-hit approach against NCBI's non-redundant database or against UniProt's expert-annotated
UniRef90 database.

Implementation
AutoFACT is a command-line-driven program written in
PERL for LINUX/UNIX operating systems. It uses BioPerl
[10] modules to parse and analyze BLAST [11] reports.
Average annotation time is 2.5 hours for 5000 sequences
of approximately 500 bp in length on a desktop workstation (BLAST time not included). A web version of AutoFACT is available where users can submit up to 10
sequences at a time for annotation. For large sequencing
projects, it is recommended that the user download and
install the local version of AutoFACT.

Results
Methodology
AutoFACT takes a single FASTA-formatted sequence file as
input, automatically recognizes the sequence type as
nucleotide or protein and proceeds to ask the user for
preferences regarding which databases to use, the order of
database importance and bit score cutoff. The bit score is
a measure of sequence similarity independent of the size
of the database used (unlike E-values). It is derived from
the raw alignment score in which the statistical properties
of the scoring system used have been taken into account.
Bit scores are normalized with respect to the scoring system and hence can be used to compare alignment scores
from different searches [12]. Each sequence in the FASTA-

formatted file is then assigned to one of six annotation
classes: (1) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), (2) [Functionally
annotated] protein, (3) Unassigned protein, (4) [Domain
name]-containing protein, (5) Unknown EST (when
using EST data) or (6) Unclassified (Table 1, Figure 1).
AutoFACT assigns classification information, based on a
hierarchal system, from a collection of specialized
resources, currently nine databases (Table 2), using BLAST
comparison [13]. Since not all descriptions from top
BLAST hits are genuinely informative, AutoFACT adopts
the "uninformative rule" [5], by which the highest scoring
BLAST hit with a biologically informative description is
considered informative.
Figure 1 outlines the AutoFACT methodology. When analyzing nucleotide data, AutoFACT begins by using BLAST
to search the nucleotide sequences in the input file against
the set of user-specified databases. If a match to the rRNA
dataset is found with a minimum match length and percent sequence identity (default: 50 bp and 84% identity),
the sequence is classified as a "ribosomal RNA". If no
match is found the sequence is then searched against the
remaining set of user-specified databases. In step 2 (or
step 1 for protein data), description lines of significant
hits, based on a user-specified bit score cutoff (default
<40), are examined for the presence of functionally uninformative terms such as 'hypothetical', 'unknown',
'chromosome', etc. When a hit contains an uninformative
term, the next best hit is scrutinized and so forth, until a
description line without uninformative terms is found,
e.g. 'proton-transporting ATP synthase'. The user specifies
the number of top BLAST hits the program should filter.
In step 3, a search for common terms among the informative hits from each database is performed. For annotation transfer, the user specifies a database order of
importance so that informative terms from the first database are searched against informative terms from the
remaining databases in a given order. For example, if the

user specifies the database order as UniRef90, nr, KEGG
and COG, informative terms in the informative hit from
UniRef90 are first searched for matches to the informative
hits from the other databases. If a match is found between
at least one informative term from the UniRef90 hit and
at least one other informative database hit (e.g., 'protontransporting ATP synthase' matches 'H+-pumping ATP
synthase'), the description line of the UniRef90 hit is
assigned to the input sequence. If there are no matches to
UniRef90 terms, the informative terms from the informative hit of the next database (nr, in this example) are then
queried in the same way as above, until a functionally
informative description line has been assigned to the
sequence.
We prefer to use UniRef90 as the first database in the order
of importance for two reasons. First, as a member of UniProt it is one of the better annotated and curated of the
available databases. Second, because UniProt entries with
90% sequence similarity are combined into a single
record, the description lines are species-independent and
tend to be more general in their descriptions. On the other
hand, description lines from NCBI's nr database are often
several lines long and contain repetitive information.
Testing showed that using various database combinations
does not significantly change the annotation results. A
user's choice of db order is therefore dependent on the format of the description line one would prefer to assign to
the sequence in question (Table 3).
AutoFACT proceeds to step 4 when there are no common
informative terms between any of the databases, or when
only uninformative hits are found. In this step, a sequence
with significant similarity to one or more sequences in the
Pfam or SMART databases is classified as a ' [domain
name]-containing' protein or a 'multi-domain-containing
protein'. A sequence containing no domains is simply
classified as an 'unassigned protein'.
A sequence is also classified as a ' [domain name]-containing protein' when the only significant hit is to a domain

database. It is considered 'unclassified' when no hits are
found to any of the specified databases. When EST
sequences are being annotated, the last step in the annotation pipeline is to check the sequence against NCBI's
est_others database. If a significant match is found, the
sequence is classified as an 'unknown EST'; otherwise it
remains 'unclassified'.
In step 5, functionally annotated sequences are then classified according to KEGG pathways, COG functional
groups, Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, GeneOntology (GO) terms and locus names. Putative KEGG pathways are assigned if an informative term from the
automatically assigned description line matches a term in
the informative KEGG hit. The same reasoning is used to
assign putative COG functional categories. EC numbers
[14] are assigned in one of two ways, either from parsing
the KEGG description line or by mapping the accession
number of the informative UniRef hit to an enzyme via
ExPASy's enzyme.dat file [15]. GO terms are assigned by
mapping the UniRef accession number of the informative
hit via the gene_association.goa_uniprot file [16].
Three different output formats are generated by AutoFACT: HTML web pages (Figure 2) for easy viewing and
browsing, a General Feature Format (GFF) file [17] to
facilitate data transfer to the user's private database and a
simple tab-delimited text file for easy data extraction and
manipulation. A log file is also generated to document all
decision-making steps in the annotation process.
Validation
To assess the validity of AutoFACT annotations, we compared results for 200 randomly chosen cDNA sequences
across four previously annotated and phylogenetically
diverse organisms: i) Homo sapiens, annotated by the
Ensembl Annotation Pipeline [8]; ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae, annotated by MIPS/PEDANT [18,19]; iii) Plasmodium
falciparum, annotated by The Institute For Genomic
Research (TIGR) [20]; and iv) Rickettsia prowazekii, previously annotated by GeneQuiz [5]. We used AutoFACT's

"uninformative rule" (Andrade et al., 1999) was used to query description lines assigned by all methods. AutoFACT yields an

species as uninformative. Figure 3 compares the annotation results of 200 randomly chosen sequences for each
species/pipeline.
Homo sapiens [Ensembl]
Comparison of Human Ensembl annotations to AutoFACT revealed no significant differences in annotation
assignments. There were 2/200 (1%) sequences that Auto-

FACT annotated as 'unassigned protein', either because
the only BLAST hits were to other human sequences or
because the informative terms could not be matched
across database sources. Had we been less strict in our
annotation criteria and considered hits to the same species as informative, AutoFACT would then have assigned
the same annotations as Ensembl to these two sequences.
The high similarity between annotation results is primarily due to the fact that the source of most of the Ensembl

also uses via UniRef90, the database of highest importance in the AutoFACT database order.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [MIPS/PEDANT]
AutoFACT and PEDANT annotations for a set of 200
cDNAs differed by 5% (10/200). We examined the original annotations for these 10 sequences in the expertly
curated Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).
Because AutoFACT considered hits to Saccharomyces cerevisiae as 'uninformative', 6/10 sequences were classified as '
[domain name]-containing proteins'. We do not consider
these annotations to be false positives, merely less specific
annotations. In 1/10 of the assignments, AutoFACT was
better than PEDANT (Table 4). The remaining 3/10

annotations are considered to be false positives, suggesting an overall error rate of 1.5% (3/200).
Plasmodium falciparum [TIGR]
We compared TIGR's preliminary annotations for a set of
200 Plasmodium falciparum cDNAs to annotations generated by AutoFACT. TIGR's preliminary annotations are
automatically assigned by searching nucleotide and protein databases for "good" matches. At this preliminary
stage, none of the annotations are examined or verified by
human annotators. We found that between the two fully
automatic pipelines, 4% (8/200) of the annotations differed, half of which were annotated by AutoFACT as '
[domain name]-containing proteins' (Table 5). Because
TIGR's preliminary annotations have not been examined

GeneQuiz ([5,22]). AutoFACT differed from GeneQuiz
annotations at 4.5% (9/200) of the sequences, yet differed
only by 1% (2/200) from the more accurate original

and include phylogenetic information. GeneQuiz estimates an overall error rate of 2.5–5%, which is confirmed
in our comparison here (Table 6). Based on these automatic annotation results, AutoFACT is the more accurate
of the two pipelines, with an error rate of only 1%.

PEP is to survey, through EST sequencing, the expressed
portions of the genomes of a phylogenetically comprehensive selection of protists (30–40 of these mostly unicellular eukaryotes).
Under the PEP initiative, 12,937 individual EST reads
yielding 5,130 clusters (consensus sequences) have been
obtained to date for A. castellanii. We compared AutoFACT
annotations for these clusters to annotations taken from
top BLASTx hits against NCBI's nr database and from top
BLASTx hits against UniProt's well-annotated UniRef90
database. AutoFACT compared the A. castellanii sequences
against a total of seven databases. UniRef90, KEGG, COG
and NCBI's nr were searched using BLASTx ; Pfam and
SMART were searched using RPS-BLAST; and NCBI's
est_others database was searched using tBLASTx. In each
instance, a bit score cutoff of 40 was used and the top 10
BLAST hits were filtered for uninformative terms. The
database order of importance was UniRef90, KEGG, COG,
NCBI's nr. Figure 4 shows an ~50% increase in functionally informative annotations with AutoFACT (58%
informative hits) compared to the quick and easy topBLAST-hit approach (~ 32%). Scanning the top 10 hits for
informative terms in AutoFACT's UniRef90 source alone
results in a 10% increase in informative annotations over
the top-BLAST-hit approach against both nr and

UniRef90. This result demonstrates the power of the
"uninformative rule" alone. As such there is a significant
decrease (from 19% to 6%) in 'uninformative' hits when
using AutoFACT. By searching against the domain
databases Pfam and SMART, AutoFACT reduces the
number of 'no hits found' by approximately 10% in comparison to the datasets annotated by the top-BLAST-hit
approach.

above can be viewed at http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/

Conclusion
To efficiently and fully exploit the wealth of sequence data
currently available, thorough and informative functional
annotations are paramount. Considering the ever-growing number of EST sequencing projects, it becomes
increasingly important to fully automate the annotation
process and to make optimal use of the various available
annotation resources and databases. Because no two
annotation systems are exactly alike, choice of system is
very much dependent on the user's end goal.
AutoFACT uses a hierarchal filtering system for determining the most informative functional annotation. It proPage 8 of 11

Comparison of AutoFACT annotations across four phylogenetically diverse organisms previously annotated by well-established
automatic pipelines. Two hundred previously annotated cDNAs from Homo sapiens [Ensembl Annotation Pipeline], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [MIPS/PEDANT], Plasmodium falciparum [TIGR] and Rickettsia prowazekii [GeneQuiz] were re-annotated with
AutoFACT using a bit score cutoff of 40 and a database order of importance as follows: UniRef90, KEGG, COG, NCBI's nr,
Pfam and SMART. The top 10 BLAST hits to each database were filtered for functionally uninformative terms. BLAST hits to
the species itself were considered uninformative. The portion of the bar representing different results from AutoFACT (dark
purple) should not be construed as false positives. For example in the case of GeneQuiz (4.5% differences), it is the AutoFACT
annotation that is the better of the two in almost all instances (see Results section). Numbers printed directly on columns represent the number of cDNA sequences (out of 200) in each category.

vides a means of classification by identifying EC numbers,
KEGG pathways, COG functional classes and GeneOntology terms. AutoFACT supplies three different output formats and a log file, which are versatile and adaptable to
user requirements. Importantly, it allows users to maintain data locally, whereas many other systems require
sequence submission elsewhere for annotation. By combining multiple resources, AutoFACT associates sequences
with a broad range of biological classifications and has
proven to be very powerful for annotating both EST and

protein sequence data. The A. castellanii case study shows
that in comparison to the 'quick and easy' top-BLAST-hit
approach against either NCBI's nr or UniProt's UniRef
databases, AutoFACT substantially improves functional
annotations of sequence data. Comparisons to other wellestablished annotation pipelines show that AutoFACT
performs equally well and in some cases better than the
alternative. We have also demonstrated that AutoFACT
exhibits an equivalent level of performance (1–2% error

rate) when it is used to annotate sequences across different domains of life.
Finally, we caution that over-prediction is common when
using sequence similarity to infer protein function. Examples of similar sequences that do not share the same or
even related functions have been documented [24].
Automatic annotations therefore may require further validation in certain cases.
