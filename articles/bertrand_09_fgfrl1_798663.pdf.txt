Abstract
Background: Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) and their receptors are well known for having
major implications in cell signalling controlling embryonic development. Recently, a gene coding for
a protein closely related to FGFRs (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors) called FGFR5 or FGFRlike 1 (FGFRL1), has been described in vertebrates. An orthologous gene was also found in the
cephalochordate amphioxus, but no orthologous genes were found by the authors in other nonvertebrate species, even if a FGFRL1 gene was identified in the sea urchin genome, as well as a
closely related gene, named nou-darake, in the planarian Dugesia japonica. These intriguing data of a
deuterostome-specific gene that might be implicated in FGF signalling prompted us to search for
putative FGFRL1 orthologues in the completely sequenced genomes of metazoans.
Results: We found FGFRL1 genes in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis as well as in many
bilaterian species. Our analysis also shows that FGFRL1 orthologous genes are linked in the
genome with other members of the FGF signalling pathway from cnidarians to bilaterians (distance
< 10 Mb). To better understand the implication of FGFRL1 genes in chordate embryonic
development, we have analyzed expression patterns of the amphioxus and the mouse genes by
whole mount in situ hybridization. We show that some homologous expression territories can be
defined, and we propose that FGFRL1 and FGF8/17/18 were already co-expressed in the
pharyngeal endoderm in the ancestor of chordates.
Conclusion: Our work sheds light on the existence of a putative FGF signalling pathway actor
present in the ancestor of probably all metazoans, the function of which has received little attention
until now.

Background
Interaction between many different signalling pathways is
necessary to form a metazoan starting from a single egg
cell. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signalling represents

one such developmental pathway. FGFs are small proteins
that act by binding to their transmembrane receptors,
FGFRs. The latter are characterised by three Immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) extracellular domains, which are impliPage 1 of 14

cated in ligand and heparan sulphate binding, as well as
an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain responsible for
signal transduction. In mammals, the analysis of several
completely sequenced genomes shows the presence of 22
FGF and 4 FGFR genes [1]. Interestingly, FGFs and FGFRs
arose early in metazoan evolution, since conserved genes
for the two families are present in the genomes of diploblastic animals like the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis
[2].
Besides the 4 classical FGFRs known in mammals, a fifth
evolutionarily related protein, called FGFR5 or FGFR-like
1 (FGFRL1), has recently been described in vertebrates [38]. FGFRL1 displays the same structural organization as
FGFRs, with the exception of the cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinase domain. Indeed, this receptor has a signal peptide
followed by three Ig-like loops and a transmembrane
domain. The cytoplasmic part of the protein is not related
to tyrosine kinases and does not show any known structural feature that could help to understand its function.
Using GFP-fused receptors, it was shown that FGFRL1 is
localised to the membrane, and FRET assays showed that
FGFRL1 forms homodimers through interactions implicating both the extracellular and intracellular domains
[9]. However, using the same technique, no interaction
between FGFRL1 and FGFRs could be detected [9]. Moreover, a variety of assays show that FGFRL1 is able to bind
at least FGF2, but with lower affinity than FGFRs, and that
it also seems to interact with heparan sulphate [4,6]. In
light of all these data, it was proposed that FGFRL1 might
act as a "decoy" receptor for FGFR by trapping FGFs.
Gene inactivation experiments performed in mouse and
zebrafish have shed light on the possible in vivo function
of FGFRL1 during development [5,10-12]. In Danio rerio,
two copies of FGFRL1 have been identified, fgfrl1a and
fgfrl1b, which probably arose after the genome duplication that took place early in the evolution of actinopterygian fish lineage [5]. Injection of morpholinos targeting
one or both duplicates leads to defects in cartilage formation of the pharyngeal arches [10]. No other defects were
described, a surprising result given that fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b
mRNAs are detected in other organs such as pectoral fin
buds and lens, as well as in the midbrain-hindbrain
boundary. However, fgfrl1a-morpholino injected
embryos have a phenotype resembling that of FGF3
mutants that is not consistent with a putative dominant
negative activity of FGFRL1 [10]. On the other hand, the
first knock-out mutant mice described for the FGFRL1
gene show a very mild phenotype in homozygous
embryos [11]. Indeed, newborns seem normal but die one
hour after birth due to respiratory failure associated with
an abnormally-formed diaphragm. However, a recent
publication, describing the phenotype of other knock-out
mutant mice for the FGFRL1 gene, shows that disrupting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/226

this gene also leads to craniofacial defects [12]. This suggests that the implication of FGFRL1 in pharyngeal development may be conserved in vertebrates.
An orthologue of FGFRL1 was isolated in the cephalochordate amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae [13], but
searches for orthologous genes in the completely
sequenced genomes of other non vertebrates were unsuccessful. This was surprising given the description of the
nou-darake gene in the planarian Dugesia japonica, which
clearly shows a structure related to FGFRL1 [14]. It was
therefore proposed that FGFRL1 was specific to the chordate lineage. However, an FGFRL1 orthologue was later
identified in the genome of the sea urchin [15]. In order
to gain insight into the origin and evolution of the
FGFRL1 gene family, we performed an exhaustive Blast
analysis. We found at least one FGFRL1 orthologue in
many invertebrate species, including the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis, and
the crustacean Daphnia pulex. We also identified a clear
FGFRL1 orthologue in the genome of Nematostella vectensis. To further analyse the role of this gene, which has been
conserved from diploblastic animals to mammals, and to
better understand its ancestral function in chordates, we
characterised mRNA expression during amphioxus
embryonic development, as well as in early embryonic
stages in mouse. Our data highlight two embryonic
regions that might correspond to FGFRL1 expression territories in the ancestor of chordates, namely the pharyngeal endoderm and the anterior neural tissues. Finally, our
work sheds light on a possible new actor of the FGF signalling pathway that has been poorly studied until now, particularly outside vertebrates.

Results
Nou-darake from Dugesia japonica is a real FGFRL1
orthologue
We used online SMART software http://smart.embl-hei
delberg.de/ to analyse the domain organization of the
nou-darake protein from the planarian Dugesia japonica
and found that contrary to previous descriptions, the protein possesses not two but three Ig loops [16,17]. The
complete structure is composed of a signal peptide followed by 3 Ig loops and a transmembrane domain, similarly to FGFRL1 (see Figure 1). A comparison by BlastP of
the amino acid sequence of nou-darake with the nonredundant CDS database from Genbank yielded vertebrate and amphioxus FGFRL1 sequences as best reciprocal
hits. We also performed a phylogenetic reconstruction for
FGFR and FGFRL1 families. The topology of the tree we
obtained clearly shows that nou-darake is more closely
related to the FGFRL1 family than to FGFRs (Figure 2).
The data therefore clearly identify nou-darake as a true
orthologue of FGFRL1.

These findings clearly establish that FGFRL1 is not only
present in chordates and echinoderms, but also in lophotrochozoans. Although the possibility of a high rate of
gene loss in many animals cannot be excluded, it was surprising that no orthologue was found in any completely
sequenced genome except for those of vertebrates and of
the sea urchin. We therefore undertook a more detailed
analysis of the other available genomes.

FGFRL1 orthologues are present in many metazoans
We searched for genes that might be potential orthologues
of FGFRL1 in several completely sequenced genomes
from invertebrate species (see Table 1 for details), as well
as in the Genbank database using a classical Blast
approach. As shown in Table 1, we found putative orthologues in almost all the species we have analysed, from a
diploblastic animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vecten-

sis, to echinoderms (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and
tunicates (Ciona savignyi and Ciona intestinalis). Some of
the sequences we obtained are complete CDS, whereas
others are incomplete, probably as a result of prediction/
assembly mistakes or incomplete sequencing. We also
looked at the genome sequences of vertebrate species for
which FGFRL1 was described to ensure there were no
additional paralogues. As previously described, we only
found one gene in human, mouse, chicken and Xenopus,
and two genes in zebrafish as well as in Tetraodon and Takifugu (Table 2). In invertebrates, we found a single putative FGFRL1 orthologue for each species, except in
Daphnia pulex which has at least 3 genes, named A, B and
C. Gene predictions are not complete for the three genes.
They are all placed close together in the same contig and
may correspond to specific tandem duplications in this
species. We also looked for putative FGFRL1 orthologues
in the genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicolis.
Previous reports indicate that M. brevicolis has few Ig
domain-containing proteins [18], and our analysis suggests that none of these correspond to FGFRL1 orthologues.
The domain organization of the different putative orthologues is given in Table 2, according to the SMART online
software [16,17]. All the sequences that are full-length
possess three Ig loops, except those found in insects.
Indeed, for all insects that we analyzed, putative FGFRL1
orthologous proteins only have two Ig loops between
their signal peptide and transmembrane domain.
To ensure that we had found real FGFRL1 orthologues, we
performed several phylogenetic analyses. Only the extracellular and transmembrane domains can be aligned and
were therefore used for phylogenetic reconstructions. We
found that the genes that we isolated for all taxa, with the
exception of insects and Nematostella, can be clearly
placed in the tree with the known deuterostome FGFRL1
(see Figure 2). For the insect sequences, some phylogenetic analyses place them with the FGFRL1 group, but
with low bootstrap values (see Additional file 1). This may
be due to the fact that there are only two Ig domains and
that the sequences are very divergent in these species.
However, the structure of the protein, combined with the
fact that the best reciprocal Blast hits with vertebrates are
FGFRL1 sequences, suggest that the insect genes represent
real FGFRL1 orthologues. For Nematostella vectensis, the
putative FGFRL1 orthologue is placed with the FGFRb
sequences from the same species in our phylogenetic
reconstructions (see Additional files 1 and 2). Both
sequences are positioned at the root of FGFR or FGFRL1
group depending on the method used for phylogenetic
reconstruction, and always with a low bootstrap value.
However, as for the insect sequences, the structure of the
protein, and the fact that the best reciprocal Blast hits with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/226

vertebrates are FGFRL1 sequences, support the fact that we
have found the bona fide FGFRL1 orthologue in Nematostella. The position of the sequence in the tree reconstructions may indicate that the FGFR and FGFRL1 genes are
the result of the duplication of an ancestral gene very early
during metazoan evolution, just before the diploblastic/
bilaterian divergence, as has previously been proposed for
other tyrosine kinase genes [19].
FGFRL1 gene organization is conserved between
cnidarians and vertebrates
We have analyzed exon/intron structure for the species for
which genomic data are available, the results of which are
shown in Figure 3 (T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis data were
omitted for the sake of clarity). Interestingly, in Nematostella vectensis, as in human, the gene is encoded by 6
exons. The first exon includes the 5'UTR as well as the signal peptide sequence. Each Ig loop domain is coded by a
unique exon, namely exons 2, 4 and 5 for IgI, II and III
respectively. Exon 3 codes for a box between IgI and IgII,
while the sixth exon codes for the transmembrane as well
as the cytoplasmic and 3'UTR sequences. In Nematostella,
similarly to human, the exon/intron limit ends at phase 1
for exons 1 to 5. Thus, exon/intron structure of FGFRL1
genes is highly conserved between human and Nematostella. In the other vertebrate species analysed, the gene
organisation is conserved overall, with few differences.
Indeed, for Xenopus, chick, and the fgfrl1a zebrafish duplicate, there is an additional exon coding for part of the
5'UTR. Furthermore, in Xenopus, the box between IgI and
IgII is encoded not by one, but by two exons. As in human
and Nematostella, all the exon/intron limits end at phase
1, except for Xenopus exon 3. This conservation of genomic
structure between sea anemone and vertebrate genes further confirms their putative orthology.

In the deuterostome group, although not all gene predictions are complete, the exon/intron structure is also quite
similar to that of vertebrates, except in the urochordates.
Indeed, in the sea urchin the only obvious difference is
that the box between IgI and IgII is coded by four exons
instead of one. In amphioxus, it is the IgII domain that is
cut into two exons compared to one in vertebrates and sea
urchin [13]. For the two Ciona species, the exon/intron
data available are incomplete; however, we observed that
the gene organization is clearly not conserved with that of
the other deuterostomes. Indeed, the three Ig loop coding
domains are separated into two exons.
In lophotrochozoans (a mollusc Lottia gigantea and an
annelid Capitella species I), the gene structure is close to
that observed for both vertebrates and the sea anemone.
In effect, only what corresponds to the first exon is separated into two sections, as well as the IgIII domain coding
part, which is split into two exons.

The accession number in Genbank (black) or in the genomic databases (bold), the domain organization of the protein as proposed by SMART online
software, and the best reciprocal blast on vertebrates sequences are given for each gene. The names correspond to the ones used in this study.

In contrast, the gene structure of all ecdysozoan FGFRL1
orthologues is very different. For C. elegans and C. briggsae,
IgI and IgII domains are each encoded by two exons,
whereas the end of IgII, IgIII, the transmembrane domain
and part of the cytoplasmic domain are encoded by a
unique exon. The last exon codes for the end of the cytoplasmic domain and for the 3'UTR. In Drosophila, the first
Ig domain is encoded by two exons, while the IgII
domain, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains as
well as the 3'UTR are encoded by a unique exon. In the
other insects, for which the gene organization data are
incomplete, the exon/intron structure is similar to what is
observed in Drosophila. Finally, in Daphnia pulex, all the Ig
domains are encoded by several exons in the three genes
found in its genome. The divergence of the genomic structure in several ecdysozoan lineages compared to vertebrates and diploblastic animals has previously been
described, and it seems that the FGFRL1 orthologues are
no exception [20].
Genomic linkage of FGFRL1 and genes involved in FGF
signalling
We have analyzed, when data were available, the genomic
position of the FGFRL1 genes and the presence of known
FGF signalling pathway genes in their vicinity. Figure 4
summarizes the data for the species for which we find a
genomic linkage between FGFRL1 and FGF signalling
pathway genes. For the purposes of clarity, only human
data are presented for vertebrates. In Nematostella vectensis,
the FGFRL1 gene is positioned close to the FGF8a and
FGF8b genes (defined as <10 Mb), which are orthologous
to the vertebrate FGF8/17/18 group. In Caenorhabditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis (and Ciona savignyi, data not
shown), FGFRL1 orthologue genes are also placed in close
proximity to the FGF8/17/18 orthologues (named egl-17
for the nematode). In contrast, the FGFRL1 orthologue is
close to the FGFR orthologues (htl and btl) in Drosophila,
to the FGFR1 gene in the sea urchin genome, and to the
FGFR3 gene in human. However, it has been proposed by
others, using evidence from the conserved syntenic posi-

tion of several genes, that FGFR and FGF8/17/18 orthologues were linked in the ancestor of bilaterian animals
[21]. Given the position of the FGFRL1 genes, close to
FGFR orthologues and/or to FGF8/17/18 orthologues, we
propose that FGFR, FGF8/17/18, and FGFRL1 genes were
linked in Urbilateria. In Nematostella we did not find any
orthologous genes of the bilaterian FGFR/FGFRL1/FGF8/
17/18 syntenic block in the same scaffold as FGFRL1 with
the exception of FGF8a and FGF8b. Nevertheless, the fact
that these three genes are positioned close together in this
species may suggest a functional link between them. It is
noteworthy that the position of the Drosophila FGFRL1
putative gene confirms its orthology with the other species' FGFRL1, in spite of a poorly supported position in
our phylogenetic tree reconstructions.
FGFRL1 expression during amphioxus and mouse
embryogenesis
To better understand the putative implication of FGFRL1
during embryonic development in chordates, we chose to
analyze its expression pattern by whole mount in situ
hybridization in two species: amphioxus, a cephalochordate placed at the base of the chordate clade; and mouse,
a vertebrate for which only late embryonic expression has
been described [22].

In amphioxus, expression starts very early during embryogenesis since we can detect FGFRL1 mRNA from the 4 cell
stage. Before gastrulation, expression is ubiquitous. In late
gastrula a higher expression level is visible in the anterior
dorsal part of the embryo (Figure 5A). In early neurula
stage embryos, basal levels start to decrease and expression becomes concentrated in the anterior part of the
embryo, with a more posterior limit in the dorsal region
(Figure 5B-C). This pattern of expression is identical in
mid-neurula stage embryos (Figure 5D-F), the posterior
limit of the labelled region being sharper. In late neurula,
expression becomes more restricted. Indeed, at this stage,
labelling is detected in the cerebral vesicle, in the anterior
epidermis, in the notochord, with a higher expression

level in its anterior region and almost no expression in its
most posterior part, and in the ventral and lateral pharyngeal endoderm (Figure 5G). At a later stage, just before
mouth opening, the pattern is similar except that expression in the notochord is lower at the level of the trunk
(Figure 5H). At this stage, expression in the endoderm is
very high in the region that will give rise to the clubshaped gland, but absent in the region where the future

gill slits will open. In the trunk endoderm, it expands
towards the most posterior region. In the larva, expression
is observed in the club-shaped gland, in the pre-oral pit,
around the mouth and in the most anterior and dorsal
part of the pharyngeal endoderm (Figure 5I). The notochord is also labelled in its most anterior part, as is part of
the cerebral vesicle. In the posterior part of the larva there

Schematic representation of the exon/intron organization of the FGFRL1 orthologous genes in different metazoan species. A schematic phylogenetic tree on the left indicates the evolutionary position of the different species studied.
Boxes represent exons. Only exon size is proportional. Colour code is indicated in the figure. The colour of an exon means it
contains the full (colour), or partial (hatched) corresponding domain. The exon/intron structures correspond to the data available in the jgi http://genome.jgi-psf.org/euk_cur1.html, Genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank, and ensembl http://

is expression in the endoderm, mainly in the anus, as well
as in the tailbud (Figure 5J).
In mouse, we have analyzed expression of FGFRL1 by
whole mount in situ hybridization at embryonic days
E7.5, E8.5, E9.5, E10.5 and E11.5. At the earliest stage,
expression is restricted to the most anterior and posterior
embryonic regions with a gradient from the axial to the
lateral parts (Figure 6A). A sharp labelling of the anterior
tip of endoderm is found, just below the rostral limit of
the neural plate. At E8.5, expression is more widespread in
both anterior and posterior regions. In the head, the
foregut and otic placodes are heavily labelled, and less
intense expression is found at the level of the rhomben-

cephalon. In the posterior part of the embryo, expression
is detected in the tailbud, the pre-somitic mesoderm and
in dorsal-most part of the somites (Figure 6B-D). At E9.5
and E10.5, the frontonasal region of the brain, the
branchial arches, the otic vesicle, the limb buds, the posterior part of the somites and the tailbud are labelled (Figure 6E-G). At E11.5, expression decreases in branchial
arches as well as in the brain (Figure 6H-I). At this stage,
expression is maintained in the otic vesicle as well as in
the chondrogenic regions of the trunk and the limbs.

Discussion
FGFRL1 appeared early during metazoan evolution and
was linked to genes of the FGF signalling pathway
First, our analysis of the planarian nou-darake sequence
supported its bona fide orthology to the chordate FGFRL1
genes. Our subsequent search for other orthologues in

complete genomes led us to identify FGFRL1 genes in
many metazoan species. Although the position in the
phylogenetic reconstructions is not well supported for
thediploblastic sequences, the conserved structure of the
protein and of the gene in Nematostella vectensis, and of the
genomic position in insects, together with the reciprocal

blast results, highly support the fact that these genes are
FGFRL1 orthologues in these species. As we were unable
to find FGFRL1 genes outside metazoans, even in the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicolis genome, we conclude
that FGFRL1 appeared early during metazoan evolution,
and was present at least in the common ancestor of bilaterian and diploblastic animals, as is also the case for the
FGF and FGFR gene families [2].

In our analysis of the genomic environment of FGFRL1
genes, we found that they are in the vicinity of FGF8/17/
18 or FGFR, or both, in many genomes. It has previously
been suggested that FGFR8/17/18 and FGFR orthologous
genes were probably linked in the ancestor of bilaterian
animals [1,21]. We propose that the FGFRL1 orthologue
was also part of the same syntenic block in Urbilateria. In
Nematostella vectensis, the NvSprouty gene is located

between the FGFRL1 gene and the FGF8a gene (at position 1,09 Mb in the scaffold 51 represented in Figure 4)
[2]. Sprouty homologues in vertebrates and Drosophila are
known to be negative regulators of FGF signalling [23],
and in Nematostella, expression of NvSprouty overlaps with
that of several FGF ligands. It has therefore been proposed
that the FGF-Sprouty feedback loop is conserved between
cnidarian and bilaterian animals [2]. The fact that FGFRL1
is linked to FGF signalling genes in the genomes of cnidarians to bilaterians suggests that it may play a role in this
pathway, although this still needs to be clearly demonstrated. Some functional data in the planarian Dugesia
japonica indicates that this might be the case during regeneration in this species [14]. Indeed, expression data and
RNAi experiments show that the FGFRL1 orthologue noudarake is implicated in brain tissue induction during
regeneration and that this induction is suppressed by double-strand RNA injection for FGFR1 and FGFR2. Moreover, overexpression of nou-darake in Xenopus embryos
leads to developmental phenotypes that are very similar
to those obtained after overexpression of XFD, a dominant-negative FGF receptor. Although the biochemical
function of nou-darake still needs to be elucidated, it was

subsequently proposed that it might be a modulator of
FGF signalling [14].
FGFRL1 embryonic expression sheds light on putative
conserved and non-conserved functions in chordates
In vertebrates, the embryonic expression pattern of
FGFRL1 has already been investigated in Xenopus [24] and
in zebrafish, which possesses two genes, fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b
[5,10]. In Xenopus as in mouse, FGFRL1 expression starts
at the gastrula stage, whereas neither of the zebrafish
duplicates is expressed before somitogenesis. However, in
Xenopus, expression is restricted to the anterior region of
the gastrula whereas we have found anterior and posterior
expression in mouse. This disparity may reflect a difference in the early function of the FGFRL1 orthologues in
these species, or may reflect the fact that the gastrulation
process is divergent in mouse, zebrafish and Xenopus. During later stages, expression in the telencephalon, branchial
arches, otic vesicle, and somites is shared among mouse
and Xenopus FGFRL1 and zebrafish fgfrl1a. However, in
zebrafish, expression in somites is transient whereas in
mouse and Xenopus, expression starts early and continues
into late development. In Xenopus, although expression is

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:226

detected in the mid-hindbrain boundary and in the lens,
as for zebrafish fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b respectively, this is not
the case in mouse. While some expression domains
appear conserved among the three vertebrates, the presence of clear differences suggests the existence of conserved and non-conserved functions during vertebrate
development.
Interestingly, amphioxus and vertebrate FGFRL1 expression patterns share some similarities. Indeed, in the gastrula stage embryos of amphioxus, we observed high
expression in the anterior part, similarly to what has been
described in Xenopus. At later stages, expression in the cerebral vesicle and in parts of the pharyngeal endoderm in
amphioxus can be considered as homologous to the
expression in the anterior brain and in the branchial
arches anlagen in Xenopus, zebrafish and mouse. However, the somites do not express FGFRL1 in amphioxus, a
surprising result given that it is clearly detected at least
transitorily in all vertebrates studied. It has also been proposed that FGFRL1 might be implicated in cartilage formation in vertebrates, and morpholino injection in
zebrafish shows that both duplicates fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b
play a role during pharyngeal arch development [10]. In
vertebrates FGF3 and FGF8 are expressed in pharyngeal
endoderm where they induce cartilage formation. Amphioxus does not have cartilage but, like FGFRL1, FGF8/17/
18 is expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm [25],
although overlap of their expression domains is not complete. On the other hand, as described recently in amphioxus, there is not a broad coexpression of cartilage marker
genes in this region of the embryo [25]. These data might
suggest that FGF8/17/18 and FGFRL1 coexpression in the
pharyngeal endoderm, the first sign of a possible interaction between the two, was already present in the chordate
ancestor, and that the two genes were recruited in vertebrates for cartilage formation in this region of the embryo.
Conflicting functional data in vertebrates
Although the expression data we have obtained in mouse
might indicate that FGFRL1 is implicated in cartilage formation, as is the case in zebrafish, the functional data that
were available until very recently did not support this
hypothesis. In zebrafish, morpholino injections for the
two duplicates fgfrl1a and fgfrl1b show that they have a
function in pharyngeal arch formation [10]. In contrast,
knock-out (KO) of FGFRL1 in mouse, as first described by
Baertschi and collaborators, caused animals to die early
after birth due to respiratory failure associated with diaphragm alteration [11]. These animals do not show obvious skeletal abnormalities in spite of specific embryonic
expression of FGFRL1 in cartilage anlagen. However,
some data suggested that in human, as in zebrafish,
FGFRL1 might be implicated in facial cartilage formation
during embryogenesis. For example, two human patients

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/226

having facial malformations caused by the deletion of the
FGFRL1 gene, or by a frameshift mutation in its intracellular coding part, have been described [26,27]. These data,
together with the results obtained in zebrafish, made the
absence of skeletal abnormalities after FGFRL1 gene inactivation in mouse really puzzling. Finally, knock-out
mutant mice, using a different construct, show craniofacial defects in addition to diaphragm malformations [12].
This strongly suggests that FGFRL1 implication in pharyngeal cartilages development is conserved in vertebrates,
and that the first mutant described in mouse did not show
a phenotype corresponding to full inactivation of this
gene. Such a discrepancy could result from the inefficacy
of the construct used to create the first FGFRL1 KO
mutants, which only deletes exon 0 and exon 1, corresponding to the 5' UTR and to the signal peptide coding
part of the mouse gene. Exons encoding the three Ig loops,
as well as the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains,
are still present in mutant mice. One could imagine that
an mRNA might be produced from an alternative 5' UTR,
leading to partial protein production and function. This
could explain the mild phenotype observed in these
mutants compared to the more recently published ones.

Conclusion
Our work shows for the first time that FGFRL1 has clear
orthologues in many metazoan species, which is in stark
opposition to previously published data [13,27]. Given
the structural similarity of the FGFRL1 protein to FGFRs,
and its genomic linkage with other members of the FGF
signalling pathway from cnidarians to bilaterians, it is reasonable to propose that FGFRL1 is an actor of this pathway in metazoans, thus far neglected due to its supposed
inexistence outside deuterostomes. The expression data in
chordates support a conserved function in the pharyngeal
endoderm, which has been shown in zebrafish by morpholino injections, and, more recently, by knock-out
mutant constructs in mouse.
Data on the embryonic role of FGFRL1 orthologues outside the chordate group remain sparse. In the FlyBase
database [28], we have found the expression pattern of the
Drosophila FGFRL1 gene (named CG31431), but it is still
unpublished. The expression pattern is very restricted
throughout embryogenesis, which might indicate a specific function that still needs to be studied. With respect to
Caenorhabditis elegans, we looked at the data available in
WormBase [29] for the FGFRL1 orthologous gene (named
Y102A11A.8). There is no embryonic expression description, and there is an absence of specific phenotype
described for one RNAi experiment [30]. In planarians, no
embryonic expression has been described, but functional
data in Dugesia japonica strongly suggest interaction
between FGFRL1 and FGF signalling during regeneration.
Our work reveals the existence of a widely conserved gene,

FGFRL1, whose characteristics may shed light on the most
ancestral FGF functions. Detailed developmental studies
are needed to decipher its full evolutionary history and
the diversification of FGF signalling pathways in metazoans.

Methods
Genomic and databases sequences survey
We searched for FGFRL1 orthologous sequences using
Blast with the mouse FGFRL1 peptide sequence and the
planarian nou-darake sequence [31]. We first used BlastP
on the predicted peptides and then TBlastN on the
genomic sequences. We also used BlastP on Genbank
sequences to look for more putative orthologues. The
sequences obtained were then analyzed by BlastP to
exclude false-positives. The genomic databases used are
listed in Table 1.
Phylogenetic analysis
Predicted amino acid sequences were aligned automatically using ClustalW [32] with manual correction in Seaview [33]. Phylogenetic reconstruction was done using
amino acid alignments of the longest sequences found for
each gene. Only complete sites (no gap, no X) were used.
Phylogenetic trees were built using RaxML, under the
JTT+I+G model, with 100 bootstrap repetitions on the
Cipres Portal v1.15 [34].
Isolation of FGFRL1 cDNA
Partial cDNAs from B. lanceolatum and mouse FGFRL1
were cloned by RT-PCR on adult RNA in pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega). An insert was then subcloned in pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) for subsequent RNA probe synthesis. Accession number for the B. lanceolatum sequence
is FJ694966.
Whole mount in situ hybridization
Ripe animals of the Mediterranean amphioxus (B. lanceolatum) were collected in Argelès-sur-Mer (France), and
gametes were obtained by heat stimulation [35,36]. Fixation and whole-mount in situ hybridization were performed as described in [37], except the chromogenic
reaction which was performed using BM Purple [38].
Mouse embryos were dissected in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and whole mount in situ hybridization was performed according to [39].
