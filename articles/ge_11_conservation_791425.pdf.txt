Abstract
Background: Tetraena mongolica (Zygophyllaceae), an endangered endemic species in western Inner Mongolia,
China. For endemic species with a limited geographical range and declining populations, historical patterns of
demography and hierarchical genetic structure are important for determining population structure, and also
provide information for developing effective and sustainable management plans. In this study, we assess genetic
variation, population structure, and phylogeography of T. mongolica from eight populations. Furthermore, we
evaluate the conservation and management units to provide the information for conservation.
Results: Sequence variation and spatial apportionment of the atpB-rbcL noncoding spacer region of the
chloroplast DNA were used to reconstruct the phylogeography of T. mongolica. A total of 880 bp was sequenced
from eight extant populations throughout the whole range of its distribution. At the cpDNA locus, high levels of
genetic differentiation among populations and low levels of genetic variation within populations were detected,
indicating that most seed dispersal was restricted within populations.
Conclusions: Demographic fluctuations, which led to random losses of genetic polymorphisms from populations,
due to frequent flooding of the Yellow River and human disturbance were indicated by the analysis of BEAST
skyline plot. Nested clade analysis revealed that restricted gene flow with isolation by distance plus occasional long
distance dispersal is the main evolutionary factor affecting the phylogeography and population structure of T.
mongolica. For setting a conservation management plan, each population of T. mongolica should be recognized as
a conservation unit.

Background
Genetic variation within and among natural populations
is crucial for the long-term survival of a species. An
accurate estimate of the level and distribution of genetic
diversity of threatened species provides fundamental
information in designing conservation programs [1,2].
Tetraena mongolica Maxim, a monotypic genus of the
Zygophyllaceae, is endemic to the western part of Inner
Mongolia around the basin of the Yellow River [3], and

is also subjected as nationally endangered in China [4].
Plants of T. mongolica, up to 0.5 m in height, flower
from mid-May till early June, and set fruits in July. The
species is restrictedly distributed in the western Gobi,
the largest desert in Asia characterized by extreme low
annual rainfall [3], where T. mongolica with a fully
developed root system is well adapted and becomes
locally dominant. T. mongolica plays an important ecological role as windbreak for stabilizing river bank [5].
Nevertheless, it has been used as firewood, locally called
as “oil firewood” because its stems are combustible even
in fresh state due to containing high levels of triacylglycerol [6]. Human’s overexploitation has inevitably
caused a dramatic decline of the species.

Previous studies have been focusing on the biological
characters causing the population decline of T. mongolica. As the high rate of ovule abortion after anthesis
[7], the seed-set of T. mongolica was quite low (1.3 2.8%) in the natural populations [8,9]. Previous population genetic researches based on allozyme and ISSR data
revealed medium levels of genetic differentiation among
populations of T. mongolica [3,10].
Understanding levels and spatial partitioning of
genetic polymorphisms in an endangered species provides sufficient information for conservation practices.
This kind of researches has become increasingly popular
in the recent years, with the development of analytical
methods to take phylogenetic distinctiveness into
account when setting conservation priorities [11,12].
During the past few decades, the theoretical framework
of population genetics and empirical data gathered with
the help of molecular genetic methods have been widely
used in conservation biology [13]. Given a haploid nature and a low frequency of genetic recombination,
molecular markers of organelle DNA have been long
used for phylogenetic reconstruction at various taxonomic levels, conservation genetics, and assessing the
migratory routes of species [14,15]. Although chloroplast
DNA evolves relatively slowly, moderate to high levels of
genetic variation have frequently been detected in some
noncoding spacers within and among species [16-18].
With maternal inheritance [19], cpDNA is suitable for
investigating processes associated with seed dispersal,
such as range expansions [20] and the contribution of
seed movement to total gene flow [21,22].
For endemic species with a limited geographical range
and declining populations, historical patterns of demography and hierarchical genetic structure are important
for determining population structure, and also provide
information for developing effective and sustainable
management plans [23]. In this study, we investigated
genetic variation, population structure, and phylogeography of T. mongolica from eight populations throughout
the entire distribution range. Several aims are pursued:
1) to examine the levels of genetic variation within and
between populations, 2) to reconstruct phylogeographical patterns and examine the extent of genetic differentiation among populations, and 3) to identify the
conservation and management units based on genetic
evidence, to provide the information for the development of effective and efficient conservation practices for
this species.

Results
Genetic diversity and cpDNA phylogeny of T. mongolica

No within-individual variation was detected in the noncoding spacer between atpB and rbcL genes of the
chloroplast DNA. Identical sequences were obtained

Page 2 of 12

from five clones derived from the same amplification
reaction, indicating no PCR artifacts caused by Taq
polymerase or sequencing errors. The atpB-rbcL intergenic region of cpDNA in T. mongolica varied from 872
to 880 base pairs (bp) in length. The cpDNA sequences
were aligned with a consensus length of 881 bp, of
which 46 sites (5.2%) were variable.
The chloroplast spacer is A/T rich with an average
content of 73.6%, which is consistent with the nucleotide composition of most noncoding spacers and pseudogenes because of low functional constraints [24]. In
total, 38 haplotypes (GenBank accession numbers of
HQ142910-HQ142986) were identified from 77 individuals of T. mongolica, with an estimated haplotype
diversity of h = 0.962 ± 0.009 (Table 1; Figure 1). Except
for the monomorphic population of YKBLG, haplotype
diversity varied across populations, ranging between
0.378 (GLS) and 1.000 (HN). Low levels of nucleotide
difference were detected within the whole species (θ =
0.00447 ± 0.0003) and within populations, ranging from
θ = 0.00099 (TST) to 0.00405 (HN).
A neighbor-joining tree obtained using MEGA recovered eight cpDNA clades (Figure 2). Most of the populations contained only one clade in the genetic
composition, except for the populations XD and HN.
Apparently, most genetic variation resides between populations of T. mongolica.
Nested clade analysis, phylogeography and population
differentiation

A nested clade analysis was accomplished by linking
nucleotide haplotypes in a hierarchical manner based
on mutational changes. After linking the haplotypes
into a clade, closely related clades were linked further
to form a higher-level group; via such hierarchical linking, a nested network was drawn (Figure 3). In total, 38
haplotypes (H1-H38) and 8 clades, 1-1 to 1-8, were
identified. The distribution of haplotypes and clades in
populations was indicated in Tables 2 and 3. Clades 11 to 1-3 were clustered into clade 2-1, which was
further grouped with clade 2-2 into a higher-level clade
3-1. Likewise, clades 2-3 and 2-4, which consisted of
clades 1-4 to 1-5 and 1-6 to 1-7, respectively, were
clustered and nested with clade 2-5 in the higher-level
clade 3-2. Clades 3-1 and 3-2 corresponding to clades
G-H and A-E of the NJ tree, respectively, were identified. The former is distributed in the southern part of
the distributional range, while the latter is in the northern part. The topology showing geographical division is
shared by the minimum spanning network and the NJ
tree. Most populations were genetically differentiated,
as most haplotypes were private within populations
except for H11, which were shared by populations TST
and HN (Table 2).

A nested contingency analysis detected significant geographical associations within several clades (2-1, 2-3,
2-4, 3-1 and 3-2) and the whole cladogram. The phylogeographical inferences are listed in Figure 4. Most tipclades were restricted to unique regions, whereas basal
interior clade 1-4 was widespread (Table 3, Figure 3).
The results agree with the hypothesis of constrained
seed dispersal of the species. The deduced Nm of 0.040.71 and FST of 0.38-0.90 indicated high levels of genetic
differentiation between all populations, with three
exceptional pairs of HN-TST, HN-XD and XD-TST

(Table 4). An “isolation by distance” model across eight
populations of the species was supported by a regression
test between Nm values and geographical distance (R =
0.772, P < 0.05).
Relative values of Dc and Dn for each clade representing contemporary distributions of haplotypes were used
to interpret historical and contemporary gene flow processes (Figure 4). Restricted gene flow with isolation by
distance was the primary process responsible for the
present-day distribution in Inner Mongolia (total cladogram), also inferred for clade 2-3. While some other

different inferences, like long distance colonization and
past fragmentation were detected at clade clades 3-1
and 3-2, respectively. This result shows limited seed dispersal of this species, while with occasional long distance dispersal [25].

Population demography pattern of T. mongolica

Historical population dynamics of T. mongolica was estimated using Bayesian skyline plots, a coalescent Markov
chain Monte Carlo method that does not require an
assumed parametric model of demographic history.

Figure 3 Minimum-spanning network based on mutations between haplotypes of the atpB-rbcL noncoding spacer of cpDNA of
Tetraena mongolica.

The skyline diagrams, which summarize instantaneous
estimates of effective population size, showed recent
population decline for T. mongolica over the last sixteen
thousand years (Figure 5). The shape of the skyline diagram conforms to its known history. That is, habitat
destruction and misapplication of human activity and
the frequent flooding of the Yellow River may have
caused a decline in T. mongolica population size.

Discussion
Genetic variation of the atpB-rbcL noncoding spacer of
cpDNA in T. mongolica

In this study, we investigated the phylogeographical pattern and population structure of endangered T. mongolica in western Inner Mongolia. In total, 38 haplotypes
were detected at the cpDNA atpB-rbcL locus in T. mongolica. The level of genetic variation of cpDNA is comparable to that of other endangered shrub plants, e.g.,
Dunnia sinensis (θ = 0.0022) [26], and Hygrophila
pogoncalyx (θ = 0.00343) [17], but is lower compared to
other endangered species, e.g., θ = 0.01018 for the
cpDNA trnD-trnT spacer of Cunninghamia konishii
[27], and θ = 0.01268 for the cpDNA atpB-rbcL spacer
of Cycas taitungensis [28]. The twofold lower nucleotide
diversity to above endangered species in T. mongolica

may be ascribed to its extremely small effective population size associated with the low seed set in wild (1.32.8%) [9].
Recent habitat loss has reduced the number and size
of T. mongolica populations [10]. Small populations of
narrowly distributed species are expected to exhibit low
levels of genetic variation, but high levels of genetic differentiation among populations, which were all detected
in this species (Table 4) [2]. Interestingly, different levels
of genetic variation were detected in different populations. The HN and XD populations possessed more haplotypes and higher genetic diversity than others, whereas
YKBLG population displayed genetic homogeneity
(Table 1). The lack of genetic variability in some populations, e.g. SZS, MSG and TST, near threefold lower in
nucleotide diversity, was likely associated with frequently
human activities. In contrast, some populations of
T. mongolica experienced relatively little disturbance
due to low accessibilities [3,10].
Our previous study revealed medium levels of genetic
differentiation among populations of T. mongolica based
on ISSR data [10]. In contrast, in cpDNA spacer higher
genetic differentiation was detected between populations
than in ISSR fingerprinting. The difference may be
highly associated with the reproductive characteristics of

inheritance and haploid nature, chloroplast DNA is
suitable for estimating the contribution of seed movement to total gene flow [21], whereas, ISSRs represent
nuclear DNA, mostly carried and dispersed by pollen
dispersal [30]. In this study, higher genetic differentiation between all populations in cpDNA than in ISSR is
likely ascribed to limited seed dispersal.
The BEAST skyline plot for cpDNA spacer identified a
recent population decline ever since sixteen thousand
years before present likely associated with human
destruction as T. mongolica has long been used as firewood (Figure 5) [6]. Ecologically, this plant is still one
of the dominant shrubs in Inner Mongolia. Through the
analysis of skyline plot, we were able to recover the history of a long term human disturbance that caused a
decline in population size of T. mongolica.
Another major factor that shaped the phylogeography
and population demography is the frequent flooding of
the Yellow River, the second longest river in China [31].
The floods not only eroded river banks, but resulted in
many habitats submerged, inevitably leading to population extinction. In addition to bank erosion, the Yellow
River is well known for its heavy load of silt. Soil deposits elevate the riverbed and cause flows between natural
levees. The river may break out of the levees into the
surrounding lower flood plain and adopt a new route.
Records indicate that the events have occurred about
once every century [32]. Such devastations caused dramatic changes of flora and fauna along the Yellow River.
Geological records indicate that the river’s levees were
breached more than 1,500 times and its course changed
26 times in the last 3,000 years [32]. Given such frequent flooding, T. mongolica would have experienced
demographic fluctuations over and over. That is, severe
periodical population bottlenecks followed by subsequent demographic expansion would elevate genetic
drift effects and lead to a loss of genetic variation
[33,34].

the species. It has been known that gene flow of seed
plants occurs either via pollen prior to fertilization or
seeds. In this study, T. mongolica is primarily pollinated
by insects [29]. Gene flow between populations via pollen would be limited by the migratory capacity of pollinators. In addition, seed dispersal of seeds from
schizocarp, a dry fruit developing from four carpels, is
constrained by gravity [29], likely resulting in most seed
dispersal confined to short distances. With maternal

Phylogeography and conservation of T. mongolica

In this study, gene genealogy of cpDNA in T. mongolica
was recovered (Figures 2 and 3). Eight cpDNA clades
were identified in the NJ tree. Most of the populations
contained only one clade in the genetic composition,
displaying a pattern of most genetic variation residing
between populations. Nested contingency analysis discriminating the geographical associations of haplotypes
and clades provides further insights into historical
events that shaped the phylogeography (Figure 4). At
the total cladogram, restricted levels of Dc vs. a large
Dn illustrates restricted gene flow with isolation by distance as the primary process responsible for the present-day distribution of T. mongolica in Inner Mongolia.
As cpDNA is maternally inherited, this inference

colonization was also observed in clade 3-1, a common
phenomenon occurring over glacial maxima [25].
Furthermore, past fragmentation observed in clade 3-2
was likely associated with the Yellow River flooding.

would have high risks of extinction, especially when

Another consequence of a small-sized population is the
susceptibility to inbreeding, which reduces heterozygosity and the performance of various fitness-related traits,
thereby substantially increasing the probability of extinction [36,37]. Given small sizes in the wild populations of

would be critical for the long-term survival of species in
considering conservation strategies [38]. Historical
demographic events in a species play an important role
in determining the present-day geographic structure of
intraspecific genetic variation [39]. In this study, given
the high levels of population differentiation between
populations and low levels of genetic diversity within
populations of T. mongolica, for retaining the existing
diversity, reservation regions covering major populations
with high genetic variation should be established.

Habitat destruction and fragmentation would inevitably result in small and isolated populations [40,41], and
increase the risk of population extinction. Today, many
natural habitats of T. mongolica around the Yellow
River have been destroyed or altered due to human
overexploitation. In order to develop an effective strategy to conserve species, the Evolutionarily Significant
Unit (ESU) needs to be defined. Various criteria for
ESUs have been suggested, including reciprocal monophyly [23], adaptive variation [42], and reproductive
separation [43]. Recognizing ESUs as reciprocally monophyletic groups ensures that the entire evolutionary
heritage within species can be maintained and that
populations belonging to different lineages can be managed separately [44]. In T. mongolica, given high levels of
genetic differentiation and reciprocal monophyly
between most populations and lower genetic variation
within populations, each population should be treated as
different evolutionarily significant units for conservation
(Figure 2).
From another view, conservation efforts can be targeted to genetic hot spots where populations have high
levels of genetic diversity [17,45]. Accordingly, HN and
XD populations that owned higher genetic diversity
near two-three folds than other populations (Table 1)

can be recognized as genetic hot spots of T. mongolica.
The concept of genetic and ecological exchangeabilities
is also central to the definitions of ESU [46]. Crandall
et al. [44] emphasize that the ESU concept not only
includes ecological data and genetic variation, but
also considers the ecological and genetic exchangeabilities. In practice, the status of recent and historical
genetic and ecological exchangeability between populations is considered. As the contemporary gene flow
from the populations at genetic hot spots to other
populations does not exist or cannot be determined,
the populations at the genetic hot spots need to be
treated as distinct conservation units for its unique
genetic variation [44]. Accordingly, hotspots at HN
and XD of T. mongolica would represent different
units for conservation, as seed dispersal between populations is limited.

DNA extraction and PCR

Leaves were powdered in liquid nitrogen and stored in a
-70°C freezer. Genomic DNAs were extracted from the
powdered tissue following a CTAB procedure and gelquantified [47]. The intergenic spacer between the atpB
and rbcL genes of the chloroplast DNA was amplified
using a pair of universal primers [48]. Each 50 μL PCR
contained: 10 ng template DNA, 5 μl 10 × PCR reaction
buffer, 5 μL MgCl2 (25 mM), 5 μl dNTP mix (8 mM),
10 pmole of each primer, and 4 U of Taq polymerase
(Promega, Madison, USA). The reaction was programmed on an MJ Thermal Cycler with first cycle of
denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, then 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 sec, annealing at 48°C for 1 min,
and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 sec, followed by
72°C extension for 10 min and 4°C for storage.
T-vector cloning and nucleotide sequencing

Conclusion
As expected, the rare species of T. mongolica possessed
very low genetic variation at the cpDNA noncoding
spacer. The effects of random genetic drift would lead
to the loss of genetic variability in a small-sized population and genetic differentiation among populations, as
observed in T. mongolica that has been mediated by
limited seed dispersal and frequent population shrinking
due to the flooding of the Yellow River. Phylogeographical analyses suggest that the present-day T. mongolica
populations in Inner Mongolia were likely a result of
restricted gene flow with isolation by distance plus occasional long distance dispersal. Molecular data provide
sufficient information for reconstructing phylogeographical patterns and critical information for setting conservation strategy. For conservation considerations we
suggest that populations with reciprocal monophyly at
the cpDNA, and the two genetically highly variable
populations likely represent management units for protecting T. mongolica.
Methods
Population sampling

In this study, we investigated the genetic variation and
structure in the rare and endangered T. mongolica.
This rare species is distributed in the western Inner
Mongolia with small habitat fragments. Samples were
collected from all populations, avoiding clonal individuals. A total of 77 individuals, representing eight
extant populations, were sampled throughout the species entire range (Figure 1, Table 1). Individuals were
chosen randomly. Young healthy leaves were collected
from the field and were dried directly with silica gel.
Dried leaves were preserved in silica gel until DNA
extraction.

All PCR products were purified from an agarose gel
using the PCR product purification kit (Viogene, Sunnyvale, USA) and cloned into a pGEM-T easy cloning vector (Promega). For each cpDNA atpB-rbcL fragment,
both strands were cycle-sequenced using the Taq Dye
Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, USA). Products of the cycle sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 377XL automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystem). Cloned PCR products
were sequenced using universal T7 forward (5’- TAATACGACTCACTATACGGG-3’) and SP6 reverse (5’TATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3’) primers located on
pGEM-T easy vector termination sites. Five clones for
each individual were randomly chosen and sequenced.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

The chloroplast DNA sequences were aligned with the
program Clustal X 1.81 [49]. Indels were excluded from
the data analysis. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis based
on Kimura’s [50] two-parameter distance was performed
using the software MEGA 4.0 [51]. To evaluate clade
support, 1,000 replicates of bootstrap analysis [52] were
performed using fast heuristic search and TBR branchswapping. The nested clade analysis of Templeton et al.
[53] provides a statistical framework for examining associations between the geographical distribution of haplotypes and their genealogical relationships [54,55].
Pairwise comparisons between DNA haplotypes were
calculated using MEGA 4.0 [51]. These were used to
construct a minimum spanning network in a hierarchical manner with the aid of the MINSPNET [56].
The nested clade analysis was accomplished by linking
nucleotide haplotypes in a hierarchical manner based on
mutational changes. The linking rules start at the tips of
the cladogram and move one mutational step into the

Ge et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/1

interior, uniting all haplotypes connected by this procedure into a ‘1-step clade’. Following pruning off the
initial 1-step clades from the tips, the procedure is
repeated on the more interior portions of the haplotype
tree until all haplotypes have been placed into 1-step
clades. The next level of nesting uses the 1-step clades
as units, rather than individual haplotypes. The linking
rules are the same; however, ‘2-step clades’ are now
formed. The nesting procedure is repeated until a nesting level is reached such that the next higher nesting
level would result in only a single category spanning the
entire original haplotype network; via such hierarchical
linking, a nested network was drawn.
Population genetic analysis of the cpDNA

Levels of inter- and intra-population genetic diversity
based on cpDNA were quantified by indices of haplotype
diversity (h) [57] and estimates of nucleotide difference (θ)
[58] using DnaSP (Version 5) [59]. Patterns of geographical subdivision and gene flow were also estimated hierarchically with the aid of DnaSP. Gene flow within and
among regions or populations was approximated as Nm,
the number of female migrants per generation between
populations. Nm was estimated using the expression FST =
1/(1 + 2 Nm), where N is the female effective population
size and m is the female migration rate [60].
A model of “isolation by distance” was assessed by
plotting pairwise Nm values against geographical distance [60]. The correlation between Nm and distance
was determined by a regression of F-test over distances
using SPSS program version 6.0 [61]. Geographical associations of haplotypes and clades within the minimum
spanning network were tested using the program GeoDis [62]. Two statistics were calculated: 1) the clade distance, Dc, a measure of the geographical spread of a
clade, and 2) the nested clade distance, Dn, a measure
of the geographical distribution of a clade relative to
other clades in the same higher level nesting category.
These measures of geographical distribution were used
to infer historical processes following the methods of
Templeton et al. [53]. The nested clade analysis (NCA)
has been recently challenged with serious flaws, such as
ignorance of the type I error [63]. The debates [64-66]
have been lasting. In this study, we used this analysis to
generate a phylogeography hypothesis.
To estimate the population demographic trends for T.
mongolica, we analyzed the cpDNA noncoding spacer
data with BEAST v1.4 [67]. Bayesian skyline plot model
was used to infer past demographic dynamics through
time, which uses standard Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling procedures calculated from a sample
of molecular sequences estimate a posterior distribution
of effective population size without dependence on a
pre-specified parametric model of demographic history

Page 10 of 12

[68]. In the study, an evolutionary rate for the chloroplast atpB-rbcL spacer of 3 × 10-9 substitutions per site
per year was used [69,70]. The Bayesian skyline plot
includes credibility intervals for the estimated effective
population size at every point in time, back to the most
recent common ancestor of the gene sequences. The
credibility intervals represent both phylogenetic and coalescent uncertainty.
