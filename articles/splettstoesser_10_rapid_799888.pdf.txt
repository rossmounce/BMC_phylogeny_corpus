Rapid differentiation of Francisella species and
subspecies by fluorescent in situ hybridization
targeting the 23S rRNA
Wolf D Splettstoesser1*, Erik Seibold1, Ella Zeman1, Karlheinz Trebesius2, Andreas Podbielski3

Abstract
Background: Francisella (F.) tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia. Due to its low infectious dose, ease of
dissemination and high case fatality rate, F. tularensis was the subject in diverse biological weapons programs and
is among the top six agents with high potential if misused in bioterrorism. Microbiological diagnosis is
cumbersome and time-consuming. Methods for the direct detection of the pathogen (immunofluorescence, PCR)
have been developed but are restricted to reference laboratories.
Results: The complete 23S rRNA genes of representative strains of F. philomiragia and all subspecies of F. tularensis
were sequenced. Single nucleotide polymorphisms on species and subspecies level were confirmed by partial
amplification and sequencing of 24 additional strains. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) assays were
established using species- and subspecies-specific probes.
Different FISH protocols allowed the positive identification of all 4 F. philomiragia strains, and more than 40 F. tularensis strains tested. By combination of different probes, it was possible to differentiate the F. tularensis subspecies
holarctica, tularensis, mediasiatica and novicida. No cross reactivity with strains of 71 clinically relevant bacterial species was observed. FISH was also successfully applied to detect different F. tularensis strains in infected cells or tissue samples. In blood culture systems spiked with F. tularensis, bacterial cells of different subspecies could be
separated within single samples.
Conclusion: We could show that FISH targeting the 23S rRNA gene is a rapid and versatile method for the
identification and differentiation of F. tularensis isolates from both laboratory cultures and clinical samples.

Background
Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly
infectious, virulent, gram-negative bacterium F. tularensis. This bacterial disease occurs in various clinical
forms depending on the route of inoculation and the
virulence of the F. tularensis strain involved [1]. The
geographical distribution of F. tularensis was long
regarded to be restricted to the Northern Hemisphere
[2], and only very recently F. tularensis-like strains have
been cultured in Queensland, Australia [3], and Thailand, South-East Asia [4]. F. tularensis has a broad host
range and can affect more animal species than any other
zoonotic pathogen [2]. Whereas human infections in
North America are mainly due to tick bites or contact

with rabbits, several enzootic cycles have been described
in the Eurasia. Here, F. tularensis is often associated
with water and aquatic fauna and its transmission is
considered to be more complex involving blood-sucking
arthropods like mosquitoes or ticks or direct contact
with infected mammals [5,6].
Due to its infectious nature, ease of dissemination and
high case fatality rate especially in respiratory infection,
F. tularensis was the subject in diverse military biological weapons programs and is still included among the
top six agents with high potential to be misused in bioterrorism [7].
The taxonomic position of F. tularensis is complex
and has changed frequently. At present, the Francisellacae family contains four validly published species: F.
tularensis, F. novicida, F. noatunensis and F. philomiragia. F. philomiragia is an opportunistic pathogen which

has been rarely isolated from immuno-compromised
individuals [8]. F. noatunensis has been described to
cause a granulomateous disease in fish [9,10]. F. novicida was shown to be very closely related to F. tularensis, and most scientific authors consider it to be the
fourth subspecies (subsp.) of F. tularensis (F. tularensis
subsp. novicida) [5,11]. In this paper we will follow this
latter nomenclature. Very recently, two further Francisella species have been described [10,11]. Although the
four subspecies of F. tularensis show close genetic and
phenotypic relationship and have probably evolved from
a common ancestor, they exhibit striking variation in
virulence in humans and animals [1]. Only two subspecies cause the vast majority of clinical tularemia in
mammals: F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (Type A), endemic in North America and F. tularensis subsp. holarctia
(Type B) which is found in many countries of the
holarctic region [5]. Both subspecies show different patterns in mortality and virulence in humans [12]. Type A
isolates can cause a life-threatening infection whereas
the less virulent type B isolates generally produce a
milder disease. Strains of the subspecies tularensis can
be further divided into two major clades, AI and AII,
which seem to differ in virulence and to cause significant mortality differences in human infections [5,12]. In
addition to the well known virulent strains classified
into the subspecies described above, there are several
lines of evidence showing that the genus Francisella
may comprise additional, hitherto unknown species
[13-15]. While some strains of Francisella-like bacteria
had been grown from immuno-compromised patients
[15,16], some putative Francisella species have been
identified only by molecular means analyzing specimens
from rodents, soil and water samples [13,15]. Moreover,
similar uncultivable Francisella-like bacteria have been
found in diverse tick species and are believed to represent endosymbionts of arthropods [17].
In clinical microbiology, the established cultivation
and serological techniques are not sufficient for the
diagnosis of all Francisella species or for a rapid and
reliable discrimination of type A or type B tularemia.
Cultivation of F. tularensis from clinical specimens
requires at least two days; this is followed by detection
of specific antigen, e.g. LPS and molecular typing. Some
reports have identified unusual F. tularensis strains, isolated from patients or rodents, which lack cysteine
requirement or production of regular F. tularensis LPS
[15,16,18]. There is accumulating evidence, supported
by recent molecular biological analyses, that F. tularensis
may be difficult to recover in human and animal infection by using standard cultivation techniques, although
direct immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical analysis or PCR allows detection of the organism within
clinical samples [19-21].

Rapid identification of F. tularensis subspecies is
important in the monitoring of enzootic tularemia during outbreaks of human tularemia or post-release scenarios [7,22,23].
Thus, rapid and reliable procedures for the direct
detection and differentiation of Francisellae in clinical
samples may prove helpful to both clinicians and public
health authorities. Therefore, a 23S rRNA-based detection approach was developed, since this molecule has
been used extensively to elucidate phylogenetic relationships of bacteria at intra- and intergeneric levels and it
is also an excellent target for fluorescent in situ hybridization [24-26].
Near full-length 23S rRNA gene sequences for F. philomiragia and all four subspecies of F. tularensis were
determined. Additional sequences for this target, which
exists in three copies in the known Francisella genomes,
were analyzed by extracting this information from the
published whole genomes sequences currently available.
These sequence data were used to develop additional
primer sets and fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide
probes suitable for species- and subspecies-specific
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of pathogenic
Francisella species in culture as well as clinical
specimens.

Methods
Preparation of samples for in situ hybridization and PCR

All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table
1 and 2. Francisella strains were grown aerobically on
heart cysteine agar (HCA) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . All
other strains were cultured on Columbia blood agar or
in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (BD, Heidelberg, Germany).
Bacterial cells were harvested while in exponential
phase, suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
centrifuged, washed in PBS, resuspended in TE buffer
(10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA [pH8]), and adjusted to an
optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. Bacterial suspensions
were prepared for PCR analysis using the QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany) tissue kit as recommended by the manufacturer. For in situ hybridization, harvested cells were
processed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) as
previously described [27].
PCR amplification, sequencing of 23S rRNA gene, and
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis

Amplification and sequencing with universal primers of
one strain of each F. tularensis subspecies as well as
one strain of the species F. philomiragia were performed as described by Lane [28]. Full length amplification of 23S rDNA was obtained by combining primers
which bind either to the 3’-end of the 16S rRNA gene
and or the 5’-end oft 5S rRNA gene with primer sets
specific for conserved regions within the 23S rDNA

Development of PCR primers and hybridization probes

The alignment of all five complete 23S rRNA gene
sequences and additional six sequences from publicly
available whole Francisella genomes were used for the
design of new PCR primers and hybridization probes.
Primer and probe designations, sequences, positions, and
references are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1. Three
PCR protocols were developed in order to amplify variable 23S rRNA gene regions containing subspecies specific SNPs for 24 additional Francisella isolates comprising
strains of each F. tularensis subspecies. For each PCR, 2
μL of DNA extracts were used. PCR was performed in a
total volume of 50 μL containing 20 μL 5-Prime-MasterMix 2.5× (5 Prime, Hamburg, Germany) and 0.2 μM of
each the forward and reverse primer. The PCR were performed with a GenAmp PCR System 9700 thermocyler
(Applied Biosystems. Foster City, USA). Cycling conditions were: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40
seconds, annealing at 56°C for 30 seconds and amplification at 72°C for 90 seconds and a single final extension at
72°C for 5 minutes. The PCR products were purified with
the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit™ according to the
manufacturer’s manual (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
The purified PCR products were sequenced with an
BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied
Biosystems (Applied Biosystems. Foster City, USA). The
total volume of the sequencing reaction-mix was 10 μL
containing 4 μL of the ready mix (BigDye® Terminator
v3.1 Cycle RR-100) from the kit, 3 μL of the purfied
PCR product and 0.2 μM of the respective sequencing
primer. Identical primers were used in both the amplification and sequencing PCR. All sequencing reactions
were performed with the same thermocycler as
described above. Cycler conditions were: An initial
denaturation step at 96°C for 1 minute, followed by 25
cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 10 seconds, annealing
at 50°C for 5 seconds, and extension at 60°C for 4 minutes. The sequencing products were purified with Centri-Sep spin columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia,
USA) and subsequently analyzed on an 3130 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems. Foster City, USA) in
accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.
Genus-, species- and subspecies-specific oligonucleotide probes for fluorescent insitu hybridization were
developed using the software package ARB http://www.
arb-home.de and probeBase http://www.microbial-ecology.net/probebase, synthesized and tagged with 6-FAM
or Cy3 fluorescence dyes (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany).
Whole-cell in situ hybridization

In situ hybridization on glass slides was performed
as described previously [27]. For the detection or identification of each Francisella species or subspecies, two

Page 6 of 14

probe combinations were hybridized simultaneously to the
reference cells and to the clinical samples in most cases.
While testing the specificity and sensitivity of the newly
developed probes, each preparation of reference cells from
all different bacterial strains were additionally probed with
a generic eubacterial probe (EUB338) and a non-sense
nucleotide probe (NonEUB338) to confirm accessibility of
the target rRNA as well as to exclude unspecific labelling
of bacterial cells or tissue due to preparation artefacts [29].
Probes Bwall1448 and Bwphi1448 were used together to
detect all Francisella species and to discriminate between
F. philomiragia and F. tularensis. The combination of
probes Bwtume168II and Bwmed1397 was applied in
order to identify and discriminate F. tularensis subsp.
tularensis (type A) and F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica.
Isolates of the subspecies F. tularensis holarctica and F.
tularensis subsp. novicida were identified using probes
Bwhol1151 or Bwnov168, respectively.
The addition of 30, 35 or 50% formamide to the hybridization buffer resulted in specific hybridization of the
oligonucleotides to their respective target organisms. To
reduce the amount of toxic waste, formamide was not
used in the washing steps following hybridization. As a
substitute, the NaCl concentration was decreased in the
washing buffer according to the formula of Lathe [30] to
obtain the necessary stringency. Citifluor (Citifluor Ltd.,
London, United Kingdom) was used as a mounting medium on hybridized slides, and the slides were examined
both with a Leica (Heerbrugg, Switzerland) TCS NT
scanning confocal microscope equipped with a standard
filter set and a conventional fluorescence microscope
(Axiostar plus/Axio CAM MR, Zeiss, Jena Germany). For
probe excitation, an argonkrypton laser (Leica) or a mercurium-spectral light was used. Three different fluorochromes (DAPI, 6-FAM and Cy3) could be detected
simultaneously with three different photomultipliers utilizing the green (6-FAM), red (Cy3), and blue (DAPI)
channels of the Leica Application Suite (Leica) or Axiovision 4.5 (Zeiss) software packages. For the tissue sections,
optical sectioning (0.5 to 1.0 μm width) was performed to
reveal the three-dimensional localization of the probeconferred fluorescence within the samples. The standard
software delivered by the manufacturers was used to
further process the digitized images.
Identification of different F. tularensis subspecies in
clinical material and infected cell cultures

Aerobic BACTEC blood culture bottles (BD, Heidelberg,
Germany) were spiked with live bacterial cells from different F. tularensis subspecies. Single cultures were
started with inoculums of 10 to 1000 colony forming
units (cfu) in 5 ml whole human blood. Additionally,
cells from two different subspecies were mixed at ratios

dropped onto glass slides, air-dried and then fixed with
PFA as described above.
Two different cell lines, the human monocyte/macrophage lineage U937 and the mouse macrophage cell line
J 774 were infected with F. tularensis subsp. holarctica
and F. tularensis subsp. novicida at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 100, incubated for 120 minutes and
then fixed with paraformaldehyde [31]. Paraffinembedded organs (spleen and liver) samples were sectioned with a microtome, fixed on glass slides, deparaffinized with alcohol and then subjected to the standard
fluorescent in situ hybridization protocol.

allowed a definite discrimination of Francisella strains
on the subspecies level and even confirmed the differentiation of type AI and type AII clades (Additional
file 1, Table S2).
PCR for confirmation of SNP

The nearly complete 23S rRNA gene sequences of F.
tularensis subsp. mediasiatica Francisella Strain Collection (FSC) 147, F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4,
F. philomiragia ATCC 25017, F. tularensis subsp.
holarctica ATCC 29684, and F. tularensis subsp. novicida ATCC 15482, have been deposited under accession
numbers GU073995 to GU073998 and GU073986,
respectively.
The partial 23S rRNA gene sequences of 24 additional
Francisella strains have been deposited under accession
numbers GU073970 to GU073985, and GU073987 to
GU073994.

Three variable regions in the 23S rDNA genes were also
sequenced in 24 additional Francisella strains using specific primers based on results from the initial sequence
analysis. Thus, most of the SNPs shown in Additional file
1, Table S2 were confirmed. Only the single nucleotide
substitution at position 913 (A versus G) was found to be
specific for F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 and
other AI strains. All type AII strains displayed the Francisella consensus sequence at this position. The phylogenetic tree generated using a neighbor joining analysis
procedure (Fig. 2) is consistent with data from the 16S
rRNA gene and a whole genome SNP phylogeny [5]
showing that F. philomiragia is clearly distal from the F.
tularensis subspecies. Among the latter, strains of the
subspecies F. tularensis subsp. novicida are distinct and
derived from the ancestral lineage leading to the other
subspecies. The phylogeny then separates into two
lineages with F. tularensis subsp. tularensis and F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica on one side and strains belonging to F. tularensis subsp. holarctica on the other. The
type A strains can then be further separated into two
groups corresponding to the known subtypes AI and AII.

Sensitivity and specificity of in situ hybridization

Sequence analysis of the 23S rRNA gene and phylogeny

Probe Bwall1448 was targeted to an rRNA region
unique for the genus Francisella and gave a positive signal for all Francisella strains tested in this study (Table
1). Due to a single mismatch within the binding site of
this probe in F. philomiragia strains, the simultaneous
application of a second probe (Bwphi1448), labeled with
a different fluorochrome allowed the identification of all
investigated Francisella strains on the species level by a
single analysis (Fig. 3). Alternatively, each probe could
be combined with EUB338, a probe targeted to a 16S
rRNA-sequence conserved in most bacterial species, to
rapidly exclude the presence of either F. tularensis or F.
philomiragia in a bacteria-containing sample.
All five available F. tularensis subsp. novicida strains
hybridized to the probes Bwall1448 as well as the novicida-specific probe Bwnov168 that binds within helix
10b of the 23S rRNA. Probe Bwhol1151 (binding site nt
1151 to nt 1170, helix 45) is complementary to all F.
tularensis holarctica sequences and gave strong signals
when hybridized to its respective target strains (Table
1). No cross reactivity with F. tularensis subsp. tularensis or other subspecies were observed.
The lack of suitable SNPs specific for all F. tularensis
subsp. tularensis strains made it necessary to develop a

Nucleotide accession numbers

The PCR primers 630V, 985R, 1029V and 502RN directed the synthesis of two overlapping 23S rRNA gene
fragments, which covered the complete 23S rRNA gene
(Fig. 1). Complete double-stranded sequences of these
amplicons were determined for the five strains F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4, F. tularensis subsp.
holarctica ATCC 29684, F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica FSC 147, F. tularensis subsp. novicida ATCC 15482,
and F. philomiragia ATCC 25017. The 23S rRNA gene
sequences of the F. tularensis subspecies exhibited very
high levels of homology (99.4 to 99.9% identity).
Between F. tularensis subsp. tularensis FSC 237 (Schu
S4) and F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (LVS, ATCC
29684) 11 different single nucleotide substitutions were
found. Differences between F. tularensis subsp. novicida
(ATCC 15482) and the three other subspecies ranged
from 10 to 19 single nucleotide substitutions.
We identified regions of intrageneric or intraspecies
variability that allowed discriminating between the species F. tularensis and F. philomiragia. In contrast to
former results on the corresponding 16S rRNA gene
sequences [32], the 23S rDNA genes displayed several
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which

either complementary to all subspecies mediasiatica and
tularensis sequences (probe Bwtume168II) or only to the
23S rRNA of F. tularensis subsp.mediasiatica
(Bwmed1379) (Fig. 4). The first probe was directed to
position nt 168 to 184 (helix 10b) which contains two
SNPs which prevents its hybridization to sequences of F.

of F. tularensis subsp. mediaiasiatica strains due to a single SNP located in the center of the probe binding site

simultaneous or consecutive application of all probes
allows an unambiguous identification of a query isolate
to the subspecies level within a few hours (Fig. 5).

In situ detection and identification of Francisella bacterial
cells in tissue samples, cell-, and blood-culture

Spleen and liver paraffin sections from experimentally or
naturally infected mice or non-human primates, were
fixed, pre-treated to remove the embedding medium
and then hybridized with probes EUB338, non-EUB338,
Bwall1448, Bwnov168 and Bwhol1151. All tissue and
cell culture samples showed moderate to strong autofluorescence. Despite such interference, the bacterial
cells could be detected by using fluorescence microscopy and additional DNA staining with DAPI. In the
infected tissue or cell culture samples, F. tularensis
subsp. holarctica and F. tularensis subsp. novicida could
then be identified by hybridization with their specific
probes (Fig. 6 + 7).
An automated blood culture system (BACTEC, BD,
Heidelberg, Germany) was used to grow bacterial cells
from each representative strain initially used for 23S
rRNA gene sequencing. The culture bottles were spiked
with 5 ml of human blood and the bacteria grown on
HCA medium. Depending on the subspecies and the
initial inoculum size, growth in aerobic blood culture
bottles occurred between two to eleven days of incubation. Bacterial cells from each subspecies were strongly
labeled with their corresponding probes as well as the
EUB338 probe used for positive control (Table 3).
In mixed samples containing bacterial cells from different strains (e.g. type A as well as type B) both populations could be easily separated by whole cell
hybridization with distinctly labeled probes (Fig. 8). By
this approach, for instance, one type A bacterial cell can
be detected and unequivocally identified in 1.000 type B
cells.

Discussion
Tularemia is a rare but dangerous zoonosis, which is
endemic in almost all countries of the Northern

Hemisphere. In some areas like Central and Southern
Europe as well as Turkey, tularemia is an emerging or
re-emerging disease representing a significant threat for
public health [33-35]. Its causative agent, F. tularensis, is
regarded as a potential biological warfare or bioterrorism agent of the highest category. For these reasons
clinical and public health laboratories are urged to provide rapid and reliable diagnostic tools for the sensitive
detection and identification of F. tularensis and for the
appropriate differentiation of its subspecies or clades
which often display significantly divergent pathogenic
potential [12,22].
In contrast to most other bacterial pathogens, cultivation of F. tularensis is difficult due to its fastidious nature and its susceptibility to overgrowth by concomitant
flora. Additionally, growth may be delayed (up to 12
days) and cultivation of F. tularensis poses a significant
threat of laboratory infections. Only recently, conventional and real-time PCR protocols for the detection and
identification of F. tularensis have been published, but
still none of these techniques is sufficiently evaluated to
be routinely used in clinical laboratories [36].
In this study we evaluated the potential of rRNA gene
targeted PCR and sequencing as well as fluorescent in
situ hybridization for the detection and differentiation of
Francisella species. In- silico analysis of partial and
complete 16S rRNA genes available in publicly accessible databases like GenBank confirmed the results of a
previous study by showing that 16S rRNA sequences
from F. tularensis subspecies are almost identical, and
therefore, are only of limited value for the detection and
discrimination of F. tularensis on the species or subspecies level [32]. In this regard, the difficulties to discriminate type A and type B strains resembled the situation
in the closely related zoonotic pathogens Yersinia (Y.)
pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis or Burkholderia (B.)
pseudomallei and B. mallei [25,37,38]

hybridization. After an initial hybridization step with three probes including the “pan-Francisella“ probe Bw-all1488, negative samples can
directly be reported. Performing internal controls with probe EUB-338 allows recognizing false negative results caused by technical problems.
After hybridization with all species- and subspecies-specific probes in parallel, initially positive samples can be further differentiated by following
the algorithm depicted in step two allowing unambiguous identification to subspecies level.

In contrast to those studies, comparison of full-length
23S rRNA genes of all F. tularensis subspecies as well as
F. philomiragia revealed several discriminative SNPs.
The sequence data obtained from rRNA gene sequences,
known to be highly conserved in bacterial phylogeny,
could be successfully used for the construction of hybridization probes, allowing a rapid genotype-based detection of Francisella species on different taxonomic levels.

A unique 23S rRNA target region suitable for the
detection of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (type B)
could be identified. For the discrimination of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A) and subsp. mediasiatica,
an identification approach was developed by employing
two different probes. Six type A strains, 31 type B
strains as well as three F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica
strains were correctly identified by this approach,

whereas no false-positive signal was observed with 71
other variably related bacterial species.
Similar results were gained employing species-specific
probes for F. philomiragia and F. tularensis, which were
tested with all mentioned F. tularensis strains as well as
four F. philomiragia strains. We also developed an in
situ hybridization protocol for F. tularensis subsp. novicida, which allowed the detection of all four available
strains of this subspecies. However, due to the possible
genetic variability within this subspecies [39] it remains
to be elicited if the designed probe will also recognize
other so called ‘novicida-like’ strains [3,4,13-16]. While
the final version of this manuscript was written, 23S
rRNA gene sequences of the aforementioned fish pathogenic members of the genus Francisella became publicly
available [9,10]. An in silico analysis of these sequences
revealed that strains of the species F. noatunensis will be
probably detected by probe Bwall1448. The available
data also indicate, that at it might be possible to discriminate between F. noatunensis comp. nov. and F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis if probe Bwphi1448 would be
combined with probe Bwall1448. It is mandatory to
experimentally verify these sequence-based predictions.
Caused by the genetic homogeneity and the clonal
population structure of F. tularensis, discrimination of
bacterial strains to the subspecies level by means of conventional PCR was almost impossible until 2003 [40].
Today, the application of different real-time PCR techniques using fluorescently labeled probes allows the discrimination of type A and type B strains from culture or
clinical samples [20,41,42]. However, these techniques

Page 12 of 14

need sophisticated and expensive instrumentation and
none of the published protocols are sufficiently validated
to be directly used in routine microbiology.
Fluorescent oligonucleotide probing of whole cells is
fast (less than two hours), reliable and could be analyzed
by regular fluorescence microscopy, which is available in
virtually all clinical or public health laboratories. In
tularemia, immunofluorescence staining of clinical samples with anti-F. tularensis LPS antibodies is routinely
applied [19], but antibodies discriminating the different
subspecies are not available. Fluorescent in situ hybridization could be a rapid, complementary method to confirm preliminary results and to additionally allow the
definitive identification of the respective subspecies that
caused the infection. This could be important for the
clinical patient management with respect to the known
differences in type-specific virulence as well as for epidemiological investigations of tularemia outbreaks [23].
For two additional reasons, fluorescent in situ hybridization is a suitable alternative to biochemical identification or PCR. First, it can be applied to thoroughly
inactivated clinical or culture samples thereby reducing
the threat of laboratory infection. Second, it works without expensive and technical sophisticated devices, rendering FISH a cost-effective procedure. The potential
for routine application of this method is supported by
the availability of commercial test kits for clinically relevant species (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia)
in typical patient specimens such as sputum or blood
culture [24,43].
For the detection of Y. pestis and Brucella sp., other
highly virulent bacterial species potentially misused as
bioterrorism agents, similar protocols have successfully
been developed [25,44].
The capability to detect and identify the closely related
Francisella species within 2-3 hours without expensive
preparation of nucleic acids from clinical samples is intriguing and may prove useful considering that misidentification of F. tularensis type A as F. tularensis type B and
vice versa may occur when identification is based on the
immunological detection of the LPS capsule or biochemical tests. In the past, such misidentification led to laboratory infections and resulted in the temporary shutdown
of laboratories for cost-intensive decontamination [45].
The sensitivity of the new method is intriguing, since we
were able to detect artificial contamination of type B
strains with F. tularensis type A as low as 0.1% of the
total bacterial population. Moreover, FISH could prove
relevant for the rapid identification of mutations in 16S
or 23S rRNA gene regions which are associated with or
causative for antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens
against aminoglycosides or macrolides [46].
This investigation showed that Francisella cells infecting different mouse or primate tissues carry sufficient

Splettstoesser et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/72

numbers of ribosomes to be detected with fluorochrome-labeled oligonucleotides. The probes readily
penetrate tissue samples and bacterial cell walls. This
technique is well suited to detect the location of a
pathogen within the body, an advantage that can be
further improved in combination with confocal laser
scanning microscopy. This modification could compensate the comparatively low sensitivity of in situ hybridization typically requiring about 105 cells per ml for a
positive reaction [25].
“Phylogenetic staining” using fluorescence labeled
hybridization probes was employed for several clinically
relevant and also environmental bacterial species [27].
For environmental studies, fluorescent in situ hybridization is used for the identification at genus, species and
subspecies level especially for uncultivable species making FISH an extremely valuable tool to study ecological
niches of bacterial species or symbiotic life styles in
complex ecological systems. Future studies will show
whether in situ hybridization techniques are sufficiently
sensitive to detect dormant or metabolically inactive
Francisella cells intracellularly surviving within tissues
or in environmental samples like water, soil or arthropod vectors.

Conclusions
The molecular methods investigated in this study offer
alternatives to more traditional diagnostic methods for
detection of tularemia in humans and animals. In particular, whole-cell hybridization is a promising, rapid, and
cultivation-independent detection method for Francisellae in clinical samples but could also prove useful to
detect and explore the newly recognized diversity of
Francisella species or Francisella-like organisms in the
environment.
