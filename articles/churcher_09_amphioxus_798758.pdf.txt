Abstract
Background: A common feature of chemosensory systems is the involvement of G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) in the detection of environmental stimuli. Several lineages of GPCRs
are involved in vertebrate olfaction, including trace amine-associated receptors, type 1 and 2
vomeronasal receptors and odorant receptors (ORs). Gene duplication and gene loss in different
vertebrate lineages have lead to an enormous amount of variation in OR gene repertoire among
species; some fish have fewer than 100 OR genes, while some mammals possess more than 1000.
Fascinating features of the vertebrate olfactory system include allelic exclusion, where each
olfactory neuron expresses only a single OR gene, and axonal guidance where neurons expressing
the same receptor project axons to common glomerulae. By identifying homologous ORs in
vertebrate and in non-vertebrate chordates, we hope to expose ancestral features of the chordate
olfactory system that will help us to better understand the evolution of the receptors themselves
and of the cellular components of the olfactory system.
Results: We have identified 50 full-length and 11 partial ORs in Branchiostoma floridae. No ORs
were identified in Ciona intestinalis. Phylogenetic analysis places the B. floridae OR genes in a
monophyletic clade with the vertebrate ORs. The majority of OR genes in amphioxus are
intronless and many are also tandemly arrayed in the genome. By exposing conserved amino acid
motifs and testing the ability of those motifs to discriminate between ORs and non-OR GPCRs, we
identified three OR-specific amino acid motifs common in cephalochordate, fish and mammalian
and ORs.
Conclusion: Here, we show that amphioxus has orthologs of vertebrate ORs. This conclusion
demonstrates that the receptors, and perhaps other components of vertebrate olfaction, evolved
at least 550 million years ago. We have also identified highly conserved amino acid motifs that may
be important for maintaining receptor conformation or regulating receptor activity. We anticipate
that the identification of vertebrate OR orthologs in amphioxus will lead to an improved
understanding of OR gene family evolution, OR gene function, and the mechanisms that control
cell-specific expression, axonal guidance, signal transduction and signal integration.

Background
Genes encoding odorant receptors (ORs) were first identified by Linda Buck and Richard Axel in 1991 [1]. Prior to

1991, experiments from several other labs suggested that
odorant receptors were seven transmembrane (TM)
domain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), so Buck

and Axel used PCR with degenerate primers designed
from available GPCR sequences to query cDNA isolated
from rat olfactory epithelium tissue. The new genes they
discovered were then used as probes to search rat cDNA
and genomic DNA for additional paralogs [1]. This similarity-based approach, in which query sequences are used
to identify orthologs and then paralogs, is a staple of both
molecular and bioinformatics research. These and subsequent studies have now uncovered over a thousand rat
and mouse odorant receptors [2-5] and have led to the
identification of other GPCR families involved in vertebrate olfaction such as the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) [6], the type 1 [7] and type 2 vomeronasal
receptors [8-10] and the formyl peptide receptor-like proteins [11].
In mammals, phylogenetic analyses have shown that
many of the OR-encoding genes are the products of relatively recent duplication events. There are fewer OR genes
in fishes, however the fish genes are more variable at the
sequence level [12,13]. Despite lineage-specific gene
amplification and loss, ORs in vertebrates are members of
a single large monophyletic clade. Here we report the
results of our search for orthologs of vertebrate ORs in the
tunicate, Ciona intestinalis (subphylum Urochordata), and
in amphioxus, Branchiostoma floridae (subphylum Cephalochordata).
Recently, phylogenetic analyses have shown that Urochordata is the extant sister of the vertebrates and that
Cephalochordata is the sister group to the vertebrate plus
urochordate clade [14], which is called Olfactores [15].
Whole genome sequences are available for C. intestinalis
and B. floridae, but similarity-based surveys have not yet
identified orthologs of vertebrate ORs in either genome
[16,17]. However, neither study employed the available
diversity of vertebrate OR sequences as queries in their
survey. Here we used a bioinformatics approach that
mimics the molecular strategy of Buck and Axel. Instead of
degenerate primers, we used an HMM model based upon
a broad diversity of full-length fish OR sequences as a
probe to survey the C. intestinalis and B. floridae protein
predictions. The candidate ORs identified were then used
as Blastp query sequences to search within each species for
additional ORs. This experiment uncovered a family of 61
OR genes in B. floridae but no ORs in C. intestinalis. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the amphioxus genes
we uncovered are orthologs of vertebrate ORs. Many of
these new B. floridae sequences lack introns and are linked
as is the case for most vertebrate ORs.
We identified amino acid motifs that can discriminate
between ORs and non-OR GPCRs in a regular expressionbased survey. These key residues may prove to be useful
for identifying formerly unrecognized ORs in vertebrates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/242

and for identifying orthologs in even more distantly
related taxa, such as echinoderms and hemichordates.
Our results provide the foundation for future comparative
studies with cephalochordates, urochordates and early
vertebrates. The results will also aid in the understanding
of OR gene family evolution, OR function, the mechanisms that control single receptor expression, axonal guidance, signal transduction and signal integration.

Results
HMM and Blastp
When we searched the B. floridae protein predictions using
the HMM model derived from fish odorant receptors with
an e-value cut off of E-10, three B. floridae proteins were
identified. No proteins in the C. intestinalis protein predictions database were identified using the same search criteria. Each of the three amphioxus sequences was used as a
query in a Blastp search of the B. floridae protein predictions. This Blastp search identified 50 sequences that were
at least 40% identical to one or more of the three query
sequences over a minimum of 100 amino acids. To
uncover additional candidate ORs, a second Blastp search
was carried out using the 50 hits from the first search as
query sequences. The HMM search combined with two
Blastp searches generated a list of 246 candidate ORs from
the B. floridae protein predictions. However, 2 of the 50
hits from the first Blastp search (Braf1_106555 and
Braf1_92691) had unusually long N termini and these
domains alone aligned to 180 of the genes in the second
Blastp search. Five more sequences were hits only to the C
termini of query sequences Braf1_111311, Braf1_69444
and Braf1_87794. None of these 185 hits to N or C termini contain any of the transmembrane spanning
domains and they were removed from the dataset, leaving
61 candidate amphioxus ORs (see Additional file 1).
Three of these 61 proteins were previously identified as G
protein-coupled receptors [16], but they were not considered to be ORs. One was classified as a basal member of
the Rhodopsin amine family (Braf1_69014), and the other
two were not classified (Braf1_109264 and Braf1_69037).
Of the 61 genes, 50 are considered full-length genes
because they contain all seven TM domains; the remaining 11 are partial sequences because they are missing at
least one of the seven TM domains.
Phylogenetics
We aligned the 50 full-length candidate ORs from B. floridae with vertebrate ORs (see Additional file 2 for
sequence list), some of which were used in the construction of the HMM. We also included non-OR GPCRs from
the Rhodopsin family to root the tree (alignment shown
Additional file 3). The OR and non-OR out-group
sequences have several 'anchor' residues common to Rhodopsin family GPCRs. These features include: a conserved
cysteine residue in transmembrane domain three, TM3

[18,19], the conserved E/DRY motif at the junction of
TM3 and intracellular loop two (IL2), a tryptophan residue in TM4, and the NPxxY motif in TM7 [20,21]. These
conserved sites were used to obtain a reliable alignment.
The results of this analysis (Figure 1) suggest that B. floridae ORs fall into two subfamilies: one contains 40 genes,
the other contains 10 genes. The phylogeny also shows
that all B. floridae candidate ORs belong to a monophyletic clade and that this clade is the sister group to type
1 vertebrate ORs. This last observation suggests that vertebrate type 2 ORs diverged from type 1 ORs prior to the
split between cephalochordates and the Olfactores [15].
Finally, a single gene from Branchiostoma belcheri, believed
to be an amphioxus OR based on its expression domain
[22], occurs in the larger subfamily of B. floridae ORs.
Regular expression survey
The phylogenetic node separating amphioxus and Olfactores [15] is approximately 550 million years old [23]. By
identifying individual amino acid residues or motifs that
are conserved in amphioxus and vertebrate ORs we may
be able to find those that play an important role in OR
function. Four conserved regions were uncovered using
WebLogo (Figure 2). Three of these are found in intracellular loops 1-3, and one is found in TM7. For each of these
conserved regions, it was possible to derive between 1 and
12 sub-motifs that could be evaluated in terms of their
ability to discriminate between ORs and other GPCRs
from the Rhodopsin gene family. These motifs were used in
regular expression searches of an OR and a non-OR
MySQL databases. From this list we identified one motif
(KAxxTxxxH) that is found in more than 73% of ORs and
less than 1% of non-ORs, and two motifs (MxxxxYxxxCxPLxY, and LxxPxYxxxxxLxxxDxxxxxxxxP) that are present
in more than 44% of ORs and less than 1% of non-ORs
(Table 1).
Amphioxus OR gene structure and location
Of the 61 B. floridae ORs, 50 are considered to be fulllength genes. Of these, 35 are predicted to be intronless
(see Additional file 1). In the B. floridae assembly version
2.0, the 61 genes are found on 44 scaffolds. Four of these
scaffolds contain two ORs, two contain three ORs and
three contain four ORs.

Discussion
Using a combination of HMM and Blastp searches, we
have identified 50 full-length and 11 partial sequences
among the B. floridae protein predictions that appear to be
odorant receptors (ORs). Similarities between the vertebrate ORs used to generate the HMM and amphioxus hits
to this HMM are low. However, the stringent criteria used
in our alignment-based searches and the bootstrap support for the key nodes in the phylogenetic tree support the
hypothesis that these amphioxus genes are orthologs of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/242

vertebrate odorant receptors. Furthermore, the B. floridae
candidate ORs have amino acid motifs found in vertebrate ORs that appear not to occur, or occur very rarely, in
non-OR genes from the Rhodopsin family. Lastly, evidence
has been reported (see below) indicating that these genes
are likely to be expressed in B. floridae rostral epithelium.
Phylogenetic analysis
Vertebrate ORs have recently been divided into two
groups, the type 1 and the type 2 ORs; the type 1 genes
have been further subdivided into six clades [12]. Genes
from only two of these type 1 clades are present in mammals, whereas fish and amphibians have genes from five
of the six clades. Type 2 ORs have been subdivided into
three clades and appear to be present only in amphibians
and fish [12]. Since type 1 ORs have been identified in
lamprey [24], the divergence between these two lineages
of paralogous genes occurred at least 450 million years
ago [12]. Representatives from all nine type 1 and type 2
vertebrate OR clades were included in a phylogenetic
analysis with the candidate ORs from B. floridae identified
here. The results of this analysis demonstrate that amphioxus ORs and the vertebrate type 1 ORs form a monophyletic group (Figure 1). In a separate phylogenetic
analysis, we added fish and mammalian sequences from
the α, β, γ and δ groups of Rhodopsin GPCRs [20] and nonOR Rhodopsin-like GPCRs from B.floridae [16] (see Additional file 4). The addition of more sequences to the phylogeny had no effect on the bootstrap support for the key
nodes and did not change the topology of the tree. These
observations not only provide strong support for the
hypothesis that the amphioxus genes are orthologs of vertebrate ORs, they also indicate that type 1 and type 2 ORs
diverged more than 550 million years ago.

Sequence identity among amphioxus ORs ranges from
approximately 22% to 95%, over the seven transmembrane regions indicating that these genes were produced
by old and recent duplication events. This pattern can also
be observed in fish ORs; sequence identity among the 238
fish ORs used in this study ranges from under 20% to over
90% (data not shown). The range of sequence identity values between B. floridae ORs and the vertebrate ORs
derived from the alignment used to reconstruct the phylogeny in Figure 1 was 10% to 31%. All B. floridae ORs are
members of a clade that contains no vertebrate sequences
suggesting that a few OR genes have provided the raw
material for gene family expansions just as in several vertebrate lineages.
The number of OR genes identified in B. floridae is smaller
than the number of OR genes that are found in most vertebrates. One possible explanation is that the majority of
the receptors involved in olfaction in B. floridae are
encoded by other gene families, such as the TAARs or the

This table contains the 27 amino acid motifs identified using the WebLogo of B. floridae and vertebrate ORs. The areas of conservation from which
the motifs were derived are labelled A-D and correspond to the regions shaded in pink in Figure 2. All variable amino acid positions are denoted by
periods. The OR motifs were used in regular expression searches of an OR sequence database (n = 5438), a non-OR database (n = 21 282) and a
database of full-length and partial B. floridae ORs (n = 61). The occurrence of each motif in a given database is given as a percentage.

formyl peptide receptor-like proteins. Alternatively, we
may not have identified all members of the B. floridae OR
gene family. If this is the case, these genes may belong to
OR gene families yet to be identified in any chordates; the
InterPro database [25] contains a number of orphan
GPCRs in the Rhodopsin family. As genome annotation
improves for lamprey, hemichordates and echinoderms,
it might be possible to identify additional OR genes in
amphioxus and vertebrates that cannot be detected using
a search based entirely upon the OR diversity currently
described in vertebrates.
As mentioned above, Nordström et al. [16] did not
uncover orthologs of vertebrate ORs among the 664
GPCRs identified in their survey of the B. floridae protein
predictions. Our search strategy differed from theirs in
that it employed a greater diversity of vertebrate OR
sequences to query the amphioxus protein predictions. As
mentioned above, mammals generally have more ORs
than fish, but they have representatives of only two of the
nine OR clades, whereas fish have OR genes from eight of
these clades [12]. By using fish sequences instead of mammalian sequences in our search, we emphasized residues

conserved in a broad diversity of ORs and were able to
ignore residues that appear to be diagnostic for ORs only
because they are common in recently duplicated genes.
Sequence conservation: GPCRs
The candidate B. floridae ORs identified in this study share
several features with other genes in the Rhodopsin family of
GPCRs. These include a conserved cysteine residue at the
border of TM3 and extracellular loop (EL1), a conserved
tryptophan in TM4, and an NPxxY motif (where x represents a variable amino acid position) in TM7. The cysteine
residue is present in most GPCRs and is thought to participate in a disulfide bond between TM3 and EL2 [18,19].
The tryptophan residue in TM4 plays a role in inter-helix
interactions that help to maintain receptor conformation
[26]. The NPxxY motif is found in most GPCRs in the Rhodopsin family [18,20] including vertebrate ORs [13,27]
and is thought to be involved in receptor internalization
and desensitization [28]. A DRY motif occurs in TM3 of
most Rhodopsin family GPCRs [18,20]. While this motif is
also present in some B. floridae ORs, the majority have a
leucine (L) in place of the arginine (R) residue. The consequences of mutations in this motif vary [reviewed in [29]]

WebLogo based on an alignment of type 1 and type 2 vertebrate ORs and B. floridae ORs. This WebLogo was created using an alignment of 64 vertebrate ORs (chicken, human, mouse, lamprey, amphibian and fish), 50 full-length B. floridae
ORs and 11 partial B. floridae ORs. Approximately 200 positions were included in the alignment. The arrows indicate positions
where blocks of sequence have been removed because they could not be aligned. For this reason, extracellular loop 2 (EL2)
and transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) are missing from the WebLogo image. Transmembrane domains are represented by
green bars and the boundaries were defined according to [45]. The intracellular and extracellular loops are labelled 'IL' and 'EL'
respectively. The four conserved regions shaded in pink (labelled A-D) were used to generate a list of OR motifs (see Table 1).
and the DLY motif is not inconsistent with OR status. A
search of our InterPro OR database uncovered homologous DLY motifs in human, colobus monkey, and dolphin OR proteins.
Sequence conservation: odorant receptors
Having shown that B. floridae ORs share several sequence
features with other members of the Rhodopsin family of
GPCRs, our next goal was to identify features specific to
ORs. The WebLogo analysis of an alignment of 125 ORs
revealed four areas that are conserved in vertebrate and
amphioxus ORs (Figure 2). From these four regions, we
generated a series of 27 motifs which were then tested for
their ability to discriminate between ORs and non-ORs.

This survey identified three motifs common in ORs but
rare in other Rhodopsin family GPCRs; LxxPxYxxxxxLxxxDxxxxxxxxP, MxxxxYxxxCxPLxY and KAxxTxxxH.
These three motifs are found in intracellular loops one,
two and three respectively and all three overlap with
neighbouring TM domains. The KAxxTxxxH was best at
discriminating between ORs and non-ORs (as defined by
InterPro). This motif occurred in 73.48% of ORs, but only
in 0.24% of non-ORs.
Conserved amino acid motifs have previously been noted
in alignments of human, mouse and zebrafish OR
sequences [13,27,30,31] and these motifs include some of
the amino acid residues highlighted above. For example,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:242

most mammalian ORs have a conserved motif in IL1 [31]
that is similar to the first motif identified in this study.
Both motifs include a leucine (L) residue followed by
downstream proline (P) and tyrosine (Y) residues. In B.
floridae ORs, the L, P and Y residues are conserved though
the Y residue appears to have been lost in many of the
recent duplicates. Also, most human odorant receptors
have the MAYDRYVAIC motif at the border of TM3 and
IL2 [27] and this motif can also be found in mouse [4]
and zebrafish ORs [13]. The comparison between the
MAYDRYVAIC motif and the second motif identified here
suggests that the methionine (M), tyrosine (Y), and
cysteine (C) residues are the most important components
of this motif and may have OR-specific functions. The
alanine (A) and aspartic acid (D) residues are also common in both vertebrate and B. floridae ORs (Table 1). In
IL3, the KAFSTC motif is also present in human, mouse
and zebrafish ORs [4,13,27], however, the phenylalanine
(F) and serine (S) residues are not as common in zebrafish
ORs. The comparison between the KAFSTC motif and our
third motif suggests that the lysine (K), alanine (A) and
threonine (T) residues play the most important roles, and
that the downstream histidine (H) would also be a good
candidate for site directed mutagenesis studies. Though
the threonine residue is highly conserved between taxa, it
appears to have been lost in many of the B. floridae ORs.
Finally, our analysis that included B. floridae sequences
shows that an NPxxY motif, which is common to Rhodopsin family GPCRs, becomes a good OR marker when an
arginine (R) residue is included two amino acids positions downstream (i.e. NPxxYxxR).
The locations of the motifs within the intracellular loops
suggest they these loops are important for OR signalling.
In other GPCRs, the intracellular loops interact with G
proteins and other proteins on the inside of the cell to regulate signal transduction. In mOR-EG, a mouse OR, mutation of conserved positions within the intracellular loops
has been shown to inhibit receptor function that is unrelated to the protein's ability to bind ligands [32]. The pattern of conservation observed here suggests that signal
transduction in both cephalochordate and vertebrate sensory neurons may be regulated by similar molecular interactions on the inside of the cell. These conserved residues
may also be important for maintaining receptor conformation in cephalochordates and vertebrates. Though
purely speculative as to what the precise role of these residues is, these sites, because of their persistence over evolutionary time, are excellent candidates for functional
analysis.
Organization in genome
ORs in vertebrates are intronless and have short N and C
termini [1,2,4]. In B. floridae, 35 out of 50 of the fulllength ORs identified in this study are intronless. Like vertebrates, most B. floridae ORs have short N termini but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/242

unlike vertebrates, many B. floridae ORs have long C termini. In mOR-EG, the C terminus plays an important role
in maintaining receptor conformation and specificity;
mutation of residues within the C terminus can inhibit
signalling [33]. In other GPCRs, the C terminus is important for receptor phosphorylation and the internalization
of the receptor from the membrane [reviewed in [34]].
The presence of long C termini in B. floridae ORs should
be confirmed experimentally, however, the presence of
several clusters of serine and threonine residues in the C
termini suggests they may be sites for receptor phosphorylation as seen in other GPCRs [34,35].
Another common feature of vertebrate odorant receptors
is that they are often found tandemly arrayed in the
genome [2,4,13,36,37]. More than half of the full-length
and partial OR genes identified here are found on a scaffold with at least one other OR, and over a third of these
genes are found on a scaffold with two or more ORs. Since
the B. floridae genome assembly is not yet complete, the
degree of linkage between B. floridae ORs is likely an
underestimate.
Expression in the rostral epithelium
Although our bioinformatics approach tells us only that
these amphioxus genes are orthologs of vertebrate ORs,
there are also experimental data for a similar gene in B.
belcheri suggesting these genes function as ORs. Satoh [22]
sequenced a single gene from B. belcheri that appeared to
be related to vertebrate ORs and he showed expression in
the rostral epithelium using an in-situ probe for this
sequence. This gene was included in our phylogenetic
analysis of B. floridae candidate ORs and it occurred
nested within the larger group of B. floridae ORs (Figure
1). Interestingly, Satoh also mentioned that the sequence
he amplified from cDNA for the in-situ probe was 'nearly
identical' to the one derived from genomic DNA suggesting there may be recently duplicated OR genes in the B.
belcheri genome that are highly similar in primary
sequence. If these duplicate genes are present in the B.
belcheri genome as seen in the B. floridae genome, then the
primers used to make the in-situ probe may not have been
gene-specific resulting in a pool of probes generated from
highly similar B. belcheri OR genes. Alternatively, a single
probe may have bound to multiple, highly similar
mRNAs. These factors may explain the 'ubiquitous'
expression pattern in the rostral epithelium that Satoh
observed.

In conjunction with the expression data collected by
Satoh [22], the identification of amino acid motifs that
are conserved in both amphioxus and vertebrate ORs supports the hypothesis that these amphioxus genes function
as ORs. However, GPCRs that are similar in sequence may
not have exactly the same function: sequence identities
among the formyl peptide receptor-like genes range from

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:242

67-96% but in mice, not all of these genes are expressed
in the vomeronasal sensory neurons [11]. For this reason,
further experimental evidence is required to determine if
the amphioxus ORs have the same function as vertebrate
ORs.
Ciona intestinalis
Using the search strategy employed here, we did not
uncover orthologs of vertebrate ORs in the urchordate
Ciona intestinalis. Our results are consistent with those
obtained in a recent survey of the C. intestinalis protein
predictions for GPCRs [17]. Orthologs of vertebrate ORs
may be present in other urochordate species but have
been lost in C. intestinalis. However, the results of our phylogenetic analysis show that OR families have expanded
from a few progenitor genes independently in many lineages, suggesting that the loss of ORs in any one clade (e.g.
urochordates) could have been be a result of the loss of
only one or two ancestral genes.

Conclusion
In this study we have identified orthologs of vertebrate
odorant receptor genes in the cephalochordate B. floridae.
This discovery supports the hypothesis that vertebrate
odorant receptors evolved prior to the split between
cephalordates and chordates which occurred approximately 550 million years ago [23]. By aligning and comparing vertebrate and amphioxus ORs, we have identified
amino acid motifs that are conserved only in ORs. These
residues may prove useful for uncovering formerly unrecognized ORs in vertebrates and for uncovering orthologs
in more distantly related taxa. These sites, which occur in
intracellular loops, are also excellent candidates for mutation-based study of OR signal transduction. The expression domains of these genes may be used to identify
homologous sensory neurons in vertebrate and invertebrate chordates. Comparative studies that include cephalochordates, urochordates and early vertebrates should
help us to understand OR gene family evolution, the
mechanisms that control single receptor expression,
axonal guidance, and signal transduction and integration.

Methods
An HMM and Blastp based search for odorant receptors in
B. floridae
Ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) odorant receptors (n =
238), the majority from zebrafish (Danio rerio), were used
to create an odorant receptor (OR) Hidden Markov Model
(HMM). We used fish sequences instead of mammalian
ORs because fishes have retained members of eight of the
nine classes of odorant receptors thought to be present in
early vertebrates [12]. Although mammals possess on
average more ORs than other vertebrates, only two of the
nine OR clades are present in mammals [12]. Fish OR
sequences [13] were downloaded from GenBank and
translated into proteins. All pseudogenes, and one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/242

sequence that could not be aligned (NM_131143.1), were
removed and the remaining sequences were aligned with
ClustalW [38]. The alignment was edited using BioEdit
[39] and used to construct a profile hidden Markov model
(HMM) using default settings and the HMM calibrate
application [40,41]. This HMM model was used to search
the B. floridae protein predictions (N = 50 817, assembly
v1.0) that were downloaded from the DOE Joint Genome
Institute [42]. The protein predictions for Ciona intestinalis
(N = 19 858, assembly version 2 release 53) were downloaded from Ensemble [43]. An E-value cut-off of E-10
and default parameters were used for the HMM searches.
The B. floridae sequences identified in the HMM survey were
used as query sequences in a Blastp [44] search of the B. floridae protein predictions. For a Blastp hit to be considered a
candidate OR, it had to be at least 40% identical to the query
sequence over a minimum of 100 amino acids. Each of the
hit sequences that met this criterion was used in a second
Blastp search using the same criteria. In this survey, only hits
to at least part of any of the TM-spanning domains of the
query sequence were retained. Sequences that spanned all
seven TM domains were considered full-length sequences;
all others were considered partial sequences.
Phylogenetic analyses
All candidate ORs from B. floridae were aligned to 59 vertebrate ORs including sequences from lamprey, tetrapod (Sarcopterygii), and ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) using
ClustalW [38]. A single candidate OR from B. belcheri [22]
was also included in the alignment. N and C termini were
removed for phylogenetic analysis as well as EL2 and TM5
because they could not be aligned (transmembrane boundaries defined by Man et al. [45]). Non-OR GPCRs from the
Rhodopsin family included in the alignment were human and
Genfish
purinergic
[GenBank:NM_002563,
Bank:CAK04925] and melanocortin receptors [GenBank:AAC13541, GenBank:NP_851301]. Although several
other Rhodopsin-like genes were used as out-groups in our
preliminary analyses (see Additional file 4), the P2Y and
melanocortin receptors were chosen because the human P2Y
receptor belongs to a subgroup of the Rhodopsin-like GPCRs
that includes the human ORs (group δ) and is expected to be
more closely related to the vertebrate ORs than the melanocortin receptor which belongs in another subgroup (group
α) [20]. An alignment of 200 amino acid positions was used
to construct a Neighbor-Joining tree in Mega3.1 [46] based
on Poisson-corrected distances. Support for tree topology
was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Key amino acid motifs
To identify amino acid motifs common in vertebrate and
B. floridae ORs, we constructed an alignment of vertebrate
(n = 64) and B. floridae (n = 61) ORs. Sequences from all
nine clades of vertebrate ORs [12] were used in the alignment including representatives from human, mouse, lamPage 8 of 10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/242

prey, fish, chicken and amphibians. The alignment
included the same amino acid positions that were used for
the phylogeny. Using the alignment, we constructed a
WebLogo [47] from which a list of candidate amino acid
motifs was generated. To determine whether these motifs
were present in ORs, non-ORs, or both, we downloaded
InterPro protein families [25] IPR000276 (Rhodopsin-like
GPCRs) and IPR000725 (Olfactory receptors) and used
them to construct two MySQL databases: one containing
5438 odorant receptors and the other containing the Rhodopsin-like sequences with the OR genes from IPR000725
excluded (N = 21 282). We searched these databases for
the presence of the motifs using a series of regular expressions. An OR-specific motif was defined as one that is
found in a large proportion of ORs but less than 1% of
non-ORs.
OR gene structure and scaffold positions
Vertebrate odorant receptors are intronless and are often
found in tandem [1,48,49]. To determine if B. floridae ORs
are also intronless and in tandem, we obtained exon number
and gene orientation from the annotation file accompanying
genome assembly v1.0. The locations of these genes were
obtained from the more recent version of the assembly, v2.0.
Our ability to identify single exon genes is limited by the
incomplete annotation of the genome. However, as previously stated, we considered a full-length sequence to be one
that spans all seven transmembrane domains.
