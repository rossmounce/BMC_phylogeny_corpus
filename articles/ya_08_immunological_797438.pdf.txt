Abstract
Background: There is increasing evidence to suggest an immunomodulation function both within
the intestines and systemically upon consuming probiotic species. We recently isolated a novel
LAB, Lactobacillus caseiZhang (LcZhang) from koumiss. LcZhang exhibited favorable probiotic
properties, such as acid resistance, bile resistance, gastrointestinal (GI) colonization ability, etc. In
order to examine the immunomodulatory qualities of LcZhang, we administered LcZhang to
healthy mice with varying doses of either live or heat-killed LcZhang and measured various
parameters of the host immune response.
Results: The study was performed in four separate experiments via oral administration of live and
heat-killed LcZhang to BALB/c mice for several consecutive days. We investigated the
immunomodulating capacity of LcZhang in vivo by analyzing the profile of cytokines, T cell
subpopulations, and immunoglobulin concentrations induced in blood serum and intestinal fluid in
BALB/c mice. Only live bacteria elicited a wide range of immune responses, which include the
increased production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and depression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
levels. In addition, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor gene transcription increased significantly,
but the proportion of T cell subsets appeared to be unaffected. We also observed that LcZhang
was capable of inducing gut mucosal responses by enhancing the production of secretory
Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) as well influencing the systemic immunity via the cytokines released to
the circulating blood.
Conclusion: The present work shows that the dose-dependent administration of LcZhang is
capable of influencing immune responses, implying that it may be a valuable strain for probiotic use
in humans.

Background
The association between improved health and probiotic
bacteria consumption was first documented more than a
century ago. Since then, numerous species of bacteria
have been examined for their potential health benefits,
particularly within the late two decades [1,2]. Data from
these studies suggest that the effects upon the host might
be attributable to the probiotic bacteria themselves
through an immunomodulatory activity. These species are
able to survive in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract
and influence the host enteric microbiota, which subsequently modulate host immunophysiologic responses. In
addition, numerous in vitro, animal model, and human
studies also suggest that many of these same species are
capable of producing a significant impact upon the host
immune system as well [1,2].
As described by Vinderola et al., the two primary routes
that probiotic species are able to impact the host are
through their direct colonization of the host as well as
indirectly by the subsequent release of various metabolites from these species [3]. The former functions via an
influence upon the balance of the gut microbial environment. Whereas, the latter route functions through more
complex pathways, such as immune recognition of bacterial envelope components, activation of Toll-like receptors, CD14, mannose receptors, etc. [4]. These events have
been demonstrated to promote the rapid activation of the
NF-κB and STAT transduction pathways, which subsequently induces the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines [5]. In fact, many characterized probiotic effects
are mediated through immune regulation, particularly
through perturbations in the balance of pro-inflammatory
and anti-inflammatory cytokines [6]. Thus, probiotics can
be employed therapeutically to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize gut mucosal dysfunction, and downregulate hypersensitivity reactions [6]. Furthermore, this
approach also has a robust safety record. Thus, probiotics
have many properties that make them highly desirable for
the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of ailments [7].
Previous data has suggested that careful attention should
be utilized when selecting strains to be used for probiotic
therapy, as differences do exist in the immunomodulatory
capacity of bacterial strains. Consequently, we were particularly interested in isolating a probiotic strain with both
strong probiotic potential as well as immunomodulatory
activity. To this end, we recently isolated a novel LAB,
Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LcZhang) from koumiss (a kind
of homemade fermented horse milk beverage) widely
used in traditional Mongolian medicine in the Inner
Mongolia region of China [8-10]. LcZhang exhibited favorable probiotic properties, such as acid resistance, bile
resistance, GI colonization ability, etc. [11]. In order to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/9/68

elucidate the immunomodulatory effects of LcZhang, we
administered healthy mice with varying doses of either
live or heat-killed LcZhang and measured the level of various cytokines, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and T-cell populations in the serum, IL-2 and IL-2 receptor gene
expression in the spleen, and secretory immunoglobulin
A (sIgA) in the intestine.

Results

Live LcZhang elicits IFN-γ production and inhibits TNF-α
production in a dose-dependent fashion
Lcactobacillus Zhang is initially isolated strain from homemade koumiss and determined to be Lactobacillus casei
using 16 S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis together
with a wide array of biochemical assays [8]. In order to
examine the immunomodulating capacity of LcZhang, we
began by examining its effect upon cytokine levels in the
circulating blood of healthy mice. We quantified IFN-γ
and IL-12 levels in the sera of mice receiving a daily dose
of LcZhang for 15 consecutive days. The level of IFN-γ
increased in all the three dose groups (Fig. 1A). However,
only the high dose group elicited a significantly higher
response (P < 0.05) compared to the heat killed group and
control group (Fig. 1A). IL-12 also increased, but none of
groups exhibited a significant difference (Fig. 1B).

As shown in figure 1C, TNF-α production was significantly reduced with a high dose (P < 0.01) and medium
dose of LcZhang (P < 0.05). The effect of LcZhang administration on IL-1α production is shown in figure 1D. No
significant changes were observed, though IL-1α levels
were slightly reduced. In addition, the effects were dosedependent. No significant changes were observed to heat
killed LcZhang administration (Fig. 1).
IL-2 and IL-2 receptor gene transcription
In addition to circulating cytokine levels, we were also
interested to determine whether LcZhang had the ability
to affect cytokine transcription as well. Therefore, IL-2 and
IL-2 receptor gene transcription were measured after the
intake of LcZhang. As shown in figure 2A, significant
increases in IL-2 gene transcription were detected at day 7
and 11 with all dose groups and at day 11, IL-2 mRNA levels peaked at almost double the control. By day 15, both
IL-2 and IL-2 receptor gene transcription had decreased
with only the high dose samples remaining significantly
different from the control (Fig. 2A and 2B). Throughout
the assay period, IL-2R gene transcription showed a similar trend with that of IL-2 (Fig. 2B).
T cell subpopulation patterns
The proportion of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells tended
to increase slightly over the assay period, but the differences were not significant. Both CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells

days oral administration. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation of each cytokine in pg/ml in serum for each test treatment (n = 10). Three dosages of bacteria were shown: low dose means 0.25 × 109 cells/ml; medium dose means 0.5 × 109 cells/
ml; high dose means 1.0 × 109 cells/ml. "Control" refers to the same volume of PBS (open column); "killed" represents heat

and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ did not seem to be affected
by LcZhang (Data not shown).
Intestinal sIgA production
Intestinal content from the caecum and distal colonic sections were collected from each mouse and the sIgA concentration was measured (Fig. 3A). A significant increase
in the concentration of this immunoglobulin was also
observed at all dose groups compared to the control. Similar to that of IgG, by the fifth day, sIgA levels peaked and
subsequently decreased to a relatively stable level. However, from days 20 – 30, a slight increase in the level of
sIgA was observed for each of the dose groups (Fig. 3A). At
its peak level on day 5, the high dose group exhibited 4fold increase in sIgA over the control, while medium and
low dose groups both showed about a 3-fold increase.
IgG production in serum
Figure 3B shows significantly increased IgG (P < 0.01) at
every dose group in the serum after ingesting LcZhang. By

the fifth day after LcZhang ingestion, IgG levels had also
peaked for each dose group with the high dose group
exhibiting a 3-fold increase over the control. This level
decreased to about 8 mg/ml for each dose group after day
10 and remained relatively constant for the remainder of
the assay period. Interestingly, the IgG level of the high
dose was slightly lower than the medium and low dose
groups after the twentieth day (Fig. 3B).

Discussion
The potential health benefits of consuming lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are increasingly being recognized. In fact, there
are some suggestions that LAB commonly used in the
dairy industry are therapeutic for diseases such as cancer,
various infections, GI disorders, asthma, etc. Because the
immune system is an important contributor to each of
these diseases, the immunoregulatory effects of LAB were
of primary interest. In those studies, cytokine production,
antibody (sIgA, IgG, and IgE) production, phagocytic
activity, Peyer's patch (PP) activation, T cell function, and

natural killer (NK) cell activity were shown to increase
with LAB consumption or when cells were exposed to LAB
in vitro or in vivo [6]. It is noted that probiotics interferes
basal lymphoproliferation or mitogen-stimulated T- and
B-cell proliferation [12,13].

the gastrointestinal mucosal resistance to infections [25].
Indeed, similar results have ever been found with other
probiotic strains [23,24,26], but further studies are
needed to verify whether this is also the case with
LcZhang.

The present study focuses on the immunoregulating
capacity of LcZhang, which is a nice probiotic candidate
[8]. Our data showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokines
IFN-γ can be increased in a dose dependent manner after
the intake of viable LcZhang. IFN-γ is a typical type 1
helper T cell (Th1) cytokine and the augmentation of Th1
cytokines are known to enhance various immune
responses. IL-12 stimulates the production of IFN-γ and is
at least partially associated with the production of Th1
cells. Furthermore, probiotics have been suggested to
affect DC maturation and functioning [14]. LABs may
potentially influence the development of Th1 and Th2 via
changes in DC types and/or the extent of maturation [15].
Usually, the immunoregulatory effects of probiotics can
be ascribed to a skew of the Th1/Th2 balance in favor of
Th1 mediated immunity [4,16,17]. Consequently, the
release of the Th1 associated cytokines IL-12, IFN-γ and
TNF-α by various cell types has been demonstrated to be
increased by LAB [18], which could help to mediate cellular immunity and inhibit the proliferation of Th2 [19,20].
Unexpectedly, our results with LcZhang do not completely agree with those reported previously. Specifically,
a reduction of TNF-α was observed in the serum. As a proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α plays a pivotal role in
inflammation, mediating fevers, and inducing the liver to
produce various detrimental proteins. In certain immune
deficiency disorders, elevated TNF-α production has been
demonstrated to be a mediator of some of the disease
pathology [21]. Thus, LcZhang administration may have
some potential utility to help moderate the inflammation
associated with elevated TNF-α.

The glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (IgG) accounts for
about 75% of the total immunoglobulins in plasma of
healthy individuals. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies
are predominately involved in the secondary antibody
response, which occurs later following antigen recognition. The presence of specific IgG generally corresponds to
maturation of antibody response. It is interesting that
total IgG level in sera increased after administered
LcZhang in the present study. With temporal increased
IgG level, IgG level restored to normal level after 10 days
administration of LcZhang, which is still significantly
higher than control group. It is conceivable that some biological activate peptides released from LcZhang may
involve in triggering secondary antibodies responses. The
mechanism of action is still unknown, further investigation required to evaluate changes of IgG sub-classes, other
classes of Ig, such as IgE or IgM, etc.

Also, via RT-PCR we detected a significant increase of IL-2
and IL-2 receptor gene transcription level after 7 days of
oral administration of LcZhang. IL-2 can induce the proliferation of activated T- and B-cells, enhance NK cytotoxicity, and increase the killing activity of monocytes and
macrophages for tumour cells and bacteria [13,20,22].
Increased IL-2 and IL-2 receptor transcription also implicates the activation of T cells. Collectively, oral administration of LcZhang elicits a modest level of systemic
immunoenhancing effects. In this study, the level of sIgA
in the intestine was increased by the oral administration
of LcZhang. Intestinal secretory IgA plays a principal role
in the intestinal immune system: it prevents infection by
inhibiting the attachment of bacteria and viruses to the
gastrointestinal tract [23,24]. Since LcZhang was able to
stably increase the level of sIgA for at least 30 days, it is
conceivable that LcZhang may have the ability to improve

Conclusion
In summary, this data indicated that oral administration
of LcZhang is able to modulate immune responses. The
effects exhibit strong dose-dependent characteristics and
is consistently related to the viability of this bacteria. Also,
oral administration of LcZhang effected the composition
of the intestinal microbiota, which suggests a mechanism
by which LcZhang could enhance specifically local as well
as systemic immune responses. Further studies are necessary to better assess the full breadth of the immunomodulatory activities of LcZhang. In addition, it is of great
interest to measure the effects of koumiss ingestion upon
immune system activation in the local population of
Inner Mongolia.

Methods
Bacteria strains and growth condition
Lactobacillus casei strain Zhang was maintained by subculturing in Trypticase Peptone Yeast broth (TPY; DIFCO,
PQ, Canada) using 1% (vol/vol) inoculums and 24 h of
incubation at 37°C and were stored at 4°C between transfers. Each culture was subcultured twice in the TPY broth
before use [27].

Serial dilutions of freshly-prepared culture were plated
onto Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) agar/cysteine-HCl and
cultured for 36 h under anaerobic conditions, prior to
enumeration. For all experiments involving killed bacterial preparations, samples of freshly-prepared cultures
were enumerated using the appropriate agar, while additional samples of the same cultures were heat-killed

(70°C/30 min). Subsequently, the concentration of the
heat-killed preparation was adjusted in lieu of the live
plate counts and used for further experimentation. Successful heat-killing was confirmed by the absence of bacterial growth on appropriate agar plates.
Animal and treatment
Female Balb/c mice (6 weeks of age) with a body weight
at about 18–22 g were purchased from the Center for
Experimental Animals at the Agriculture University of
Inner Mongolia. Guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Agriculture University of Inner Mongolia. Five
mice were kept in each cage. Each experimental group
consisted of 10 mice in cytokines detection assays, 20
mice in IL-2 gene transcription assay while each experimental group consisted of 30 mice in T cell subpopulation
detection and immunoglobulin concentration detection
experiments. At each period, 5 mice were sacrificed. The
animals were bred specific pathogen free (SPF) and kept
in a temperature- and light-controlled environment. The
animals were allowed free access to a non-purified MF diet
and water until the experiment began. For cytokine measurements and gene transcription experiments, the bacterial suspensions were adjusted with PBS such that a low
dose was 0.25 × 109 cells/ml; medium dose 0.5 × 109 cells/
ml; high dose 1.0 × 109 cells/ml. Oral gavage volume was
1 ml per day. For assays of T cell subpopulations and
immunoglobulin production, a low dose was adjusted to
0.50 × 109 cells/ml; a medium dose 1.0 × 109 cells/ml; and
a high dose 2.0 × 109 cells/ml. Oral gavage volume was 2
ml per day. Every five days, 5 mice were sacrificed for
immunoglobulin production experiments. Sera and intestinal contents were collected immediately.
Detection of cytokine levels in sera
Blood was collected from the orbital cavity under diethyl
ether anesthesia; sera were separated by centrifugation at
1500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Serum was
stored at -70°C until further analyzed. The levels of
cytokines in sera were determined by capture ELISAs and
measured in each case against a standard curve generated
by employing known amounts of recombinant cytokine.
IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α and IL-1α were measured using ELISA
detection kits (Senxiong Biotech Inc, Shanghai, China)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. In all cases,
detection antibody binding was visualized using streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase conjugate and an OPD (oPhenylenediamine) substrate system at an OD of 492 nm.
For each experiment, the levels of cytokine detected in
serum by exposure to LcZhang were determined by comparing against the cytokine levels observed in the standard
curves (controls). Data were calculated as the mean
cytokine response (in 5 pg/ml) of each treatment from
triplicate wells, plus or minus the standard deviation.

Analysis of IL-2 and IL-2R gene transcription
Total RNA was isolated from the spleen with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Initially, a portion of the spleen was frozen
in liquid nitrogen, placed in lysis buffer, and immediately
disrupted and homogenized using a rotor-stator homogenizer. About 50–100 mg of spleen material was used for
RNA isolation with 1 ml of Trizol Reagent. AMV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, USA), and oligo-(dT) 15 primers
(Promega) were used for generating total cDNA. mRNA
levels were also measured by semi-quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR. RNA concentration was assessed spectrophotometrically and RNA integrity was visualized with
gel electrophoresis. The concentration of all mouse RNA
samples was adjusted to 2.5 μg/μl by vacuum drying and
resuspending in RNase free water (Takara, Japan). All RNA
samples were stored at -80°C until used. One step RT-PCR
was performed using the commercially available kit (High
Fidelity RNA PCR Kit, Takara, Japan). IL-2 and IL-2R gene
transcription were evaluated by semi-quantitative RTPCR. The forward primer for IL-2 is 5'-CTGGAGCAGCTGTTGATG-3' and 5'-CGAATTGGCACTCAAATG-3'for the
reverse. The size of the amplified IL-2 fragment was 286
base pair (bp). For the IL-2 receptor, the primers are 5'CGGTTTCCGAAGACTAAA-3'and
5'-GTCCTTCCACGAAATGAT-3' for the reverse. The size of the amplified IL2R fragment was 266 bp. β-actin gene transcription was
used as a housekeeping control for normalization. The βactin primer sequences are 5'-GTTACCAACTGGGACGACA-3' and 5'-AGGCATACAGGGACAGCA-3'. The size
of the amplified β-actin fragment was 208 bp.

PCR was performed in a reaction volume of 50 μl, using
the High Fidelity RNA PCR Kit (Takara, Japan) according
to the instructions of the manufacturer. For PCR, the initial melting temperature was 94°C for 4 min, followed by
31 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1
min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR
products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel. Amplicon
band intensity was calculated using Image Analysis Software (Alpha Innotech Corporation).
Measurement of Immunoglobulin concentration
Concentration of IgG in sera and sIgA from intestines
were determined by ELISA quantitative kits (Sun biomedical Technology Beijng Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according
to manufacturer instructions. Immunoglobulin concentrations were evaluated every five days for a total of 30
days after the oral administration of LcZhang.
Measurement of intestinal sIgA
Immediately after sacrificing the mice, samples from the
caecum and distal sections of the intestine from each
mouse were collected and homogenized in saline solution
(50 mg/ml). Particulate material was removed by centrif-

ugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant
fluid was stored at -80°C for IgA measurement. The level
of sIgA in supernatants were determined by ELISA quantitation kits (Sun biomedical Technology Co., Ltd, Beijng,
China) according to manufacturer instructions.
Measurement of sera IgG
Blood was collected from the orbital cavity under diethyl
ether anesthesia and the sera were separated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The IgG
concentration was determined by ELISA quantitation kits
(Sun biomedical Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China)
according to manufacturer instructions. The IgG level was
measured in each case against a standard curve generated
by employing known amounts of IgG. The protocols used
to quantify IgG are similar to those described for cytokine
detection.
Detection of T cell subpopulation
For immunophenotyping, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear
Cells (PBMCs) were washed in PBS supplemented with
0.1% sodium azide and 1% normal mouse serum, and
incubated for 30 min at 4°C with one of the following
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (all obtained from BD
Pharmingen): fluorescein isothioncyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse CD3+, PE-mouse CD4+, and PE-mouse
CD8α. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Statistical analysis
Experimental data was expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical
analysis (one-way ANOVA) was performed using the
GraphPad PRISM version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) to analyze the differences among the means of
experimental groups. When a parameter of any of the
experimental groups was significant, Dunnett's Multiple
Comparison Test was used. Differences were considered
to be significant at P < 0.05 and highly significant at P <
0.01.

Abbreviations
sIgA: secretory immunoglobulin A; IgG: Immunoglobulin
G; CFU: colony-forming unit; SPF: specific pathogen free;
PBS: phosphate buffered saline; OPD: o-Phenylenediamine; PBMC: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells
