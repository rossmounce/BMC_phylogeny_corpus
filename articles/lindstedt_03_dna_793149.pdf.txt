Abstract
Background: The ability to react early to possible outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and to
trace possible sources relies on the availability of highly discriminatory and reliable techniques. The
development of methods that are fast and has the potential for complete automation is needed for
this important pathogen.
Methods: In all 73 isolates of shiga-toxin producing E. coli O157 (STEC) were used in this study.
The two available fully sequenced STEC genomes were scanned for tandem repeated stretches of
DNA, which were evaluated as polymorphic markers for isolate identification.
Results: The 73 E. coli isolates displayed 47 distinct patterns and the MLVA assay was capable of
high discrimination between the E. coli O157 strains. The assay was fast and all the steps can be
automated.
Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a novel high discriminatory molecular typing method for
the important pathogen E. coli O157 that is fast, robust and offers many advantages compared to
current methods.

Background
Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a common cause of a variety of
illnesses, including bloody diarrhea and the hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS). The O157:H7 serotype was first
described in the literature in 1983 following two outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis in a fast-food restaurant
chain in Oregon and Michigan in 1982 [1,2]. Illness was
characterized by watery diarrhea, which progressed to

bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps [1,2]. E. coli
O157:H7 belongs to a group of diarrheagenic E. coli
named Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) [3]. STEC
produce several distinct Shiga toxins (Stx) [4] and it is
believed that HUS results from the systemic action of Stx
on vascular endothelial cells [5]. The most frequent mode
of transmission for E. coli O157:H7 infection is through
consumption of contaminated food and water, and

several outbreaks have been caused by ground beef.
Approximately 1% of healthy cattle may have the organism in their intestines.

DNA extraction
Suspensions of bacterial cells were boiled for 15 min and
used directly in the PCR reactions after a brief centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 3 min., or genomic DNA was
extracted using a commercial kit ("Easy-DNA"; Invitrogen
BV, Leek, The Netherlands).

repeated DNA motifs with the Tandem Repeat Finder
[26], GeneQuest (DNASTAR, Madison WI) and Kodon
(Applied-Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) software. Several
regions containing tandem repeated motifs were found, of
which seven were chosen to constitute a set for high level
discrimination of E. coli O157 isolates. Six of the VNTRs
were localized on the main chromosome, and one was
localized on the E. coli O157 large virulence plasmid
(accession no. AF074613). Table 2 [see Additional file 2]
gives an overview over the repeat characteristics. The
VNTRs were situated in five genes and two intergenic
regions and had repeated motifs ranging from 6 to 30
basepairs. Some of the VNTRs displayed size variations
between the EDL933 and Sakai strains when their GenBank sequences were examined, and the predicted amplicons are shown in table 2 [see Additional file 2]. The
actual repeats with leader and tailing sequence of 500 bps
were used to design specific PCR primers (Table 3) [see
Additional file 3]. Care was taken to match both annealing temperature and sizes of the produced PCR amplicons
to make a convenient set for PCR and capillary electrophoresis separation. The PrimerSelect (DNASTAR) software automatically calculated the primer annealing
temperatures, and analyzed how the different primers
could interact in multiplex PCR. The forward primers for
all the seven VNTR regions were labelled with 6 FAM (6'carboxyfluorescein). The different primer-sets were tested
against each other in several combinations. A combination of primers with Vhec1 alone annealed at 50°C, Vhec4
and Vhec5 annealed at 53°C, Vhec2 and Vhec3 annealed
at 50°C and Vhec6 and Vhec7 annealed at 50°C. The temperature profile was: 94°C denaturation for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, annealing
temperature from above for 60 s and 72°C for 50 s and
finally a 10 min extension step at 72°C performed on a
GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied-Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Five microliters of each of the PCR products
were pooled together into a single tube for each sample
and thoroughly mixed. Five microliters of the resuspended solution mixed with 8 µl formamid and 1 µl of
size standard was then used for capillary electrophoresis,
after a 2 min denaturation at 94°C, on an ABI-310
Genetic Analyzer (Applied-Biosystems) with POP4-polymer and Genescan TAMRA-500 or TAMRA-2500 as internal standard in each sample (Applied-Biosystems). The
capillary electrophoresis was run for 50 min at 60°C. The
samples were injected into the capillary by applying a 15
kV voltage for 5 s. The run voltage was 15 kV. The size of
each VNTR locus was determined by the GeneScan software (Applied-Biosystems).

MLVA typing
The genomic sequences of both the E. coli O157 strains
that have been fully sequenced (accession numbers
AE005174 and NC_002695) were searched for tandem

Phylogeny calculation
The electropherograms were imported into the BioNumerics software package (Applied-Maths) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Dice coefficients and

The ability to react early to possible outbreaks of E. coli
O157:H7 and to trace possible sources relies on the availability of highly discriminatory and reliable techniques.
Of particular interest are the DNA based molecular typing
methods. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that
the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method of
XbaI digested whole genomes gave good discrimination
and was highly reproducible [6]. We previously compared
PFGE with the newer method of Amplified-Fragment
Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and found that while AFLP
was faster, PFGE offered the best resolution for typing E.
coli O157:H7 [6]. Typing E. coli O157:H7 by PFGE is currently the preferred typing method in our laboratory.
However, the rapid sequencing of complete bacterial
genomes including the sequence of two E. coli O157:H7
strains [7,8]. gave us the opportunity to search the
genomes of these two strains in order to look for Variable
Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) that could be used
as a source of genetic polymorphisms and be used in a
typing assay. Polymorphic VNTR regions which can be
used for typing purpouses have been identified and tested
in Yersinia pestis [9-11], Francisella tularensis [12], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [13-16], Xylella fastidiosa [17], Haemophilus influenzae [18-20], Bacillus anthracis [21-24], and we
have recently developed a VNTR based typing assay for the
important enteropathogen Salmonella Typhimurium [25].

Methods
Bacterial strains
In all 73 isolates of shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli
O157 were used in this study. The isolates included both
domestic (32 isolates) strains and strains from Sweden
(11 isolates), Finland (6 isolates), UK (5 isolates) and
from the USA (19 isolates). The majority, 69, of the isolates have previously been typed both by XbaI PFGE and
AFLP [6], and the collection included strains from well
characterized outbreaks as well as strains designated as
sporadic isolates. Table 1 [see Additional file 1] summarizes the strain collection.

cluster analysis with the unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) from the ABI trace
files. The constructed phylogeny was based on the resulting compound band-pattern from all amplified loci for
each isolate, thus, the separate VNTR loci were not analysed individually.
Sequencing
The same primers used to amplify the VNTR regions were
used for sequencing at 3.2 pmol concentration. The PCR
products were cleaned with the Qiaquick PCR purification
kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and both forward and
reverse strands were sequenced two times each using the
ABI Cycle-sequencing kit V3.0 (Applied-Biosystems), the
sequencing products were cleaned with the DyeEx kit
(QIAGEN) to remove unincorporated dyes before applied
on an ABI-3100 automated sequencer.

Results
The Tandem Repeat Finder software [26] found 36 repeats
when it was set to search for repeated motifs of 6 or more
nucleotides repeated in tandem with 3 or more copies,
which were more than 60% internally homogenous
between repeat units. Both the GeneQuest (DNASTAR)
and Kodon software (Applied-Maths) found these repeats
and added the possibility of viewing graphics of the location of each VNTR locus with surrounding area, and information about melting temperatures and GC content in
these genomic areas. The Tandem Repeat Finder offered
by far the fastest search routine, however, both GeneQuest
and Kodon also searched for other classes of repeated
DNA e.g. inverted repeats and dyad repeats.
The MLVA assay displayed 47 distinct profiles among the
73 strains analysed. The resulting electropherogram of the
pooled amplicons showed a clear and easily interpretable
banding patterns (Figure 1). The identification of each
peak in the pooled run with the correct VNTR region was
done by running each primer-pair separately in every isolate. This was done primarily for the development of the
method, and the resulting phylogeny was based on the
resulting banding-pattern without identifying each locus
separately. Selected isolates were run repeated times by
different individuals, and always displayed identical
banding patterns. Some minor variations in signal
strength between runs were noted which possibly could
be explained by variations in PCR efficiency or in the
amount of DNA available as template since the boiling of
isolates is likely to produce different amount of DNA. Not
all the VNTR loci gave amplification products in all isolates or some of the peaks were masked by two VNTRs
producing the same sized PCR products. The majority of
samples displayed all amplification products, although
some of these were masked by two different VNTRs having
the same size in the electropherograms. Eight isolates

http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/2/1/12

(11%) displayed a loss of one band, and only one isolate
had less than 6 bands (Table 4) [see Additional file 4]. All
primer-pairs showed loss of amplification products except
Vhec2, Vhec6 and Vhec7, which were present in all our
isolates. All the VNTR loci displayed heterogeneity in our
material. In table 5 [see Additional file 5] the data for
allele size ranges in basepairs, number of alleles at each
locus and the polymorphism index of each marker is
shown. In table 4 [see Additional file 4] the allele distribution among all the distinct MLVA patterns are shown. All
unique alleles differing by gain or loss of repeat units were
given allele numbers, thus PCR amplicons of a VNTR
locus with the same size in different isolates were given
the same number in table 4 [see Additional file 4]. Different allele sizes at the different VNTR loci were results of
loss or gains of repeat unites, which were verified by direct
sequencing of the PCR amplicons using the VNTR primers. In figure 2 is an alignment of the Vhec4 primer products from isolates G5300 and IHE5344 showing a 10
repeat unit difference of the AAATAG motif.

Discussion
The MLVA assay was easy to perform, consisting of four
separate PCR reactions with subsequent pooling of the
products, and capillary electrophoresis. The assay was
tested both with extracted DNA and with just boiling the
bacterial cells for 15 min. Both methods gave the same
PCR products, however with boiled cells as the starting
material primer Vhec1, and in some cases, Vhec3 and
Vhec4 gave reduced amplification products in the multiplexed PCR reactions compared to what was achieved
with extracted DNA, but with the sensitivity of the capillary system with fluorescently labelled DNA we had no
difficulties in finding all products. Selected isolates were
run repeated times by different individuals, and always
displayed identical banding patterns. The assay was thus
proven to be robust and highly reproducible. The strain
collection used was very well described both in literature,
and by previous typing [6]. This constituted a good basis
for assessing the resolution of this novel method. We have
previously typed 69 isolates in this collection both by XbaI
PFGE and EcoRI(0)+MseI(+C) AFLP [6], and the MLVA
assay displayed 45 distinct profiles in this subset. This was
comparable to PFGE, which displayed 44 distinct, profiles
and considerably higher than the 23 profiles revealed by
AFLP (Table 1) [see Additional file 1]. Some of the PFGE
profiles were, however, quite similar (one band difference). The resulting phylogeny generated from the MLVA
assay showed good accordance to the epidemiological
data available, and with PFGE typing (Table 1) [see Additional file 1]. The majority of strains, which were clustered
together with PFGE, also were co-clustered with the MLVA
assay with some exceptions. Outbreaks were differentiated and clustered into distinct groups. Some exceptions
were, however, noted. One isolate (G4921) from

panel) were identical, but displayed a clearly distinct profile for isolate 127/97 (lower panel).

outbreak #7 (USA) displayed a different MLVA profile
(V28) than the rest of the outbreak #7 strains (V30). This
isolate was also different by PFGE typing indicating that
this strain might not be a part of outbreak #7, or that this
outbreak had several strains involved. Strain G4919 (V30)
of outbreak #7 displayed a different PFGE profile (P17)
from the main PFGE pattern of this outbreak (P16), but
by MLVA this strain was identical to the main outbreak
pattern V30. The P16 and P17 PFGE profiles were, however, quite similar and had a one-band difference [6] making the MLVA data credible. Outbreak #6 from the USA
was also divided into different profiles by MLVAtyping.
Strains H0619 and H0620 were identical (V31), while
H0617 (V32), H0618 (V34) and H0616 (V35) displayed
different profiles. Here only the H0618 isolate was also
different by PFGE. The H0617 and H0616 isolates were
thus identical with H0619 and H0620 by PFGE while they

had different patterns by MLVA (Table 1) [see Additional
file 1]. The outbreak #6 isolates did however cluster
together, but strain 174/99 (V33), a Norwegian isolate,
was included in this cluster by MLVA. The cattle isolates
H90/95, H82/95, H83/95 and H89/95 were isolated from
the same herd, and believed to be identical. This was confirmed by MLVA typing, which gave identical patterns for
these isolates (V36). The PFGE typing, however, displayed
minor differences between these isolates, giving H90/95
and H83/95 identical patterns (P37) as well as different
patterns for H82/95 (P38) and H89/95 (P39). The PFGE
profiles for patterns P37, P38 and P39 were, however,
highly similar and related [6]. No size variations in the
repeated motifs in any of the seven VNTR loci were
detected between isolates H82/95 and H90/95. For outbreak #14 (V42 profile), the MLVA assay included two isolates, one human isolate previously considered unrelated

3108/97 (V42) and one isolate from cattle 127/97 (V42).
The suspected outbreak isolate 127/98 (V43) (outbreak
#14) was given a different profile from the other outbreak
strains by MLVA (Fig. 1). The inclusion of strain 3108/97
into outbreak #14 was confirmed by PFGE, while the
exclusion of 127/98 was not indicated neither by PFGE
nor AFLP. Figure 1 shows the MLVA patterns for three isolates that were identical by PFGE and AFLP. Two of these
isolates (131/97 and 126/97) were also identical by MLVA
(V1), while strain 127/97 displayed a clearly unrelated
profile (V42). Some of the MLVA types in table 1 [see
Additional file 1] displayed less than seven VNTR bands.
The reason for this was that some primer-pairs did not
give an amplification product in all isolates. It can also be
viewed in figure 1 where the 127/97 isolate in the lower
panel has no amplification product from the Vhec5
primer-pairs.

Conclusions
The main finding was a remarkable high co-clustering of
the MLVA and PFGE profiles. This high co-clustering was
a bit unexpected given that these methods were based on
quite different mechanisms to generate the profile date.
The presence of XbaI recognition sites for PFGE and the
variability of tandem repeated motifs in MLVA. The good
correlation between PFGE and MLVA is important since
the majority of E. coli O157 has been typed by PFGE and
the clusters generated with MLVA will be familiar. The
speed of the MLVA assay combined with its resolution
makes it an attractive alternative for typing E. coli O157
isolates which are considered to be the most important
pathogens so far among the shiga-toxin producing E. coli
serotypes. We thus present here a novel VNTR based typing method for STEC O157 strains, which is both considerably faster, less labour intensive and yet offers a slightly
higher discriminatory power compared to PFGE. An addi-

tional benefit compared with PFGE is the potential for
fully automating the analysis. The main tasks were liquid
handling, which can be performed by laboratory robots,
and by using multi-dye electrophoresis the analysis of the
data can also be automated.
