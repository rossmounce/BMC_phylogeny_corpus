A quantitative account of genomic island
acquisitions in prokaryotes
Tom E Roos1,2 and Mark WJ van Passel3*

Abstract
Background: Microbial genomes do not merely evolve through the slow accumulation of mutations, but also, and
often more dramatically, by taking up new DNA in a process called horizontal gene transfer. These innovation
leaps in the acquisition of new traits can take place via the introgression of single genes, but also through the
acquisition of large gene clusters, which are termed Genomic Islands. Since only a small proportion of all the DNA
diversity has been sequenced, it can be hard to find the appropriate donors for acquired genes via sequence
alignments from databases. In contrast, relative oligonucleotide frequencies represent a remarkably stable genomic
signature in prokaryotes, which facilitates compositional comparisons as an alignment-free alternative for
phylogenetic relatedness.
In this project, we test whether Genomic Islands identified in individual bacterial genomes have a similar genomic
signature, in terms of relative dinucleotide frequencies, and can therefore be expected to originate from a
common donor species.
Results: When multiple Genomic Islands are present within a single genome, we find that up to 28% of these are
compositionally very similar to each other, indicative of frequent recurring acquisitions from the same donor to the
same acceptor.
Conclusions: This represents the first quantitative assessment of common directional transfer events in prokaryotic
evolutionary history. We suggest that many of the resident Genomic Islands per prokaryotic genome originated
from the same source, which may have implications with respect to their regulatory interactions, and for the
elucidation of the common origins of these acquired gene clusters.
Keywords: Genomic Islands, genome signature, horizontal gene transfer

Background
The advent of whole genome sequencing has drastically
altered our perspective on life’s evolutionary history.
Bacterial genomes are now known to be largely mosaics
made up of horizontally transferred genes [1-4]. In fact,
many bacteria that cause disease, like those that cause
plague, meningitis, tetanus or cholera have only become
virulent after they acquired virulence genes [5-8], highlighting the impact of horizontal gene transfer on
human health [9]. In many cases, questions remain
about the natural reservoir of these acquired genes
[10,11].

These horizontally transferred genes are not necessarily acquired one at a time. Numerous bacterial genomes
show clusters of recently acquired genes that are known
as Genomic Islands (GIs) [3,12-16]. Even though many
GIs have unknown functions, some of these acquired
gene clusters are involved in pathogenicity (the Pathogenicity Associated Islands), though several other clustered collective functions are known (metabolic islands,
degradation islands et cetera) [17,18]. We hypothesise
that, when several GIs reside in a single genome, it is
possible that a single donor has been responsible for
multiple gene transfer events to that host.
In a previous study, we found that compositionally
similar sequences can be clustered together, and a genomic acquisition account of large acquired gene clusters
can be established [19]. Such alignment-free compositional analyses focus on the similarity between two

sequences with respect to their relative dinucleotide frequencies. In brief, relative dinucleotide frequencies are
known to be typical for a given genome, a genomic signature, and similar between related species. This parameter can be used to assess the similarity in
composition between different sequences, for example
in binning sequences that are thought to be derived
from the same organism [20-24]. Compositional analyses
have been used before to detect compositionally anomalous genes [25], which could subsequently be identified
as putative horizontally acquired genes. In addition,
similar comparative analyses have been applied to metagenomic datasets, in which genomic fragments were
assigned to their probable host based on their compositional similarities [26,27]. However, few attempts have
been made to compositionally compare clusters of
acquired genes, in order to indicate common donors,
analogous to assigning donors to sequences from metagenomic libraries.
Here we focus on the acquisition accounts of GIs that
are identified in the genomes of a large collection of
bacterial and archaeal species [28]. By comparing the
compositional similarities of all GIs that reside in the
same genome, for a large number of genomes, conservative estimates of the maximum number of compositionally distinct donors can be assessed. This will shed new
light onto the evolutionary histories of prokaryotes, and
the quantitative dynamics of recurrent horizontal gene
transfer events of large gene clusters.

Methods
Analyses were carried out as described previously [19],
with a few modifications for scaling up the analyses. In
brief, GIs were obtained from IslandViewer [28] at
http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/download.php, selecting only those species/genera having genome sizes > 800 kb and the GIs with sizes > 10 kb.
Smaller genomes are thought to be mostly devoid of GIs
since they often represent intracellular symbionts,
whereas the 10 kb cut-off is based on previous publications concerning sizes of GIs [29]. IslandViewer is a
computational tool that integrates different genomic
island prediction software suits; two sequence composition prediction methods (IslandPick [30], SIGI-HMM
[31]) and a comparative GI prediction method (IslandPath-DIMOB [13]). Regions that are identified with
IslandViewer are annotated as putative genomic islands,
and included in our GI set [28]. This database may not
cover all large acquired gene clusters, but does allow for
large-scale compositional analyses.
With this collection of GIs, the compositional relatedness of each GI was subsequently compared with its
respective genome. This was done by comparing the
composition of the GI, with the compositions of all

Page 2 of 7

genomic fragments of the same size [25,32]. Next, all
GIs residing in the same genome were compared with
each other by calculating the average dinucleotide relative abundance difference, or genomic dissimilarity (δ*)
[20], after which we cluster all compositionally similar
GIs per genome, based on their genomic dissimilarity
values using δr-Web and Compare_Islands [19,25],
respectively. More information on these methods can be
found at the website http://deltarho.amc.nl. In brief, distance matrices of GI comparisons per genome revealed
the GIs that have a lower genomic dissimilarity than a
conservative threshold sequence to its host genome.
With respect to these conservative thresholds of relatedness, we included in each comparison a chromosomal
fragment of 15 kb with a very low relative dissimilarity
with its genome. The relative dissimilarity signifies the
dissimilarity between a query sequence and the rest of
the genome; the dissimilarity of the query is relative to
the collection of non-overlapping genomic fragments of
identical size as the query. The relative dissimilarity is
expressed as a percentage of genomic fragments with a
lower genomic dissimilarity than the query sequence. A
relative dissimilarity of 95% signifies that 95% of all
non-overlapping genomic fragments of identical size as
the query is more similar to the genome than the query
is. The threshold sequences are based on progressively
lower relative dissimilarity values. Core Islands CI-25,
CI-10, CI-5 and CI-0 represent the four threshold
sequences with relative dissimilarity values of 25%, 10%,
5% and 0%. In other words, a Core Island from a specific genome is compositionally very similar to its host. In
order to test that different GIs from the same genome
originate from a same donor species, the GIs need to be
compositionally more similar to each other than the
Core Island is to its host genome. Thus, if GIs meet
these similarity thresholds, we score these GIs as clusters that have a compositionally similar background, and
therefore likely a common origin. In some instances,
compositionally similar GIs are not clustered together
due to a high compositional similarity between a GI
from a predicted cluster with a GI outside of that specific cluster. The similarity threshold between the unclustered GI and one of the other GIs in the cluster is not
met. These problems in an unambiguous interpretation
of the clustering are categorized as ‘conflicts’, and subsequently all GIs from that genome are excluded from the
cluster analyses in order to reduce potential misclassifications. An example of an analysis with a clustering
conflict is given in Additional File 1, which gives the
compositional distance matrix of six GIs from the genome of Clostridium botulinum Ba4_657 (NC_012658),
relative to the CI-25 threshold sequence. These conflicts
are removed from the analyses in an attempt to obtain a
conservative dataset with few ambiguities.

A set of stand-alone scripts is available from the
authors (at https://trac.nbic.nl/brsp200901_vanpassel/
wiki), with both instructions on how to perform the
analyses for GI sets automatically as well as the raw
data for the analyses presented here. It iterates all calculations for each applicable GI-host and GI-GI combination within a host, allowing the user to choose different
cut-off values of compositional dissimilarity (i.e., the
Core Islands), as well as GI size. For individual GI/genome comparisons, Compare_Islands can be used at
http://deltarho.amc.nl [19].
In order to test to test the accuracy of our clustering
approach and cut-offs, we simulate a clustering fidelity
by analyzing how frequently fragments from the same
genome are clustered together when a pool of phylogenetically unrelated 15 kb sequences are compared. For
each of the four thresholds, 100 analyses are carried out,
each consisting of a set of 100 sequences; 90 originating
from distinct genera, and ten non-biological randomized
sequences. The 90 sequences originate from 30 genomes, with three fragments per genome, and two out of
these three have a relative dissimilarity like the threshold that is being simulated. The third sequence has a
relative dissimilarity of 50% with its host genome. In
this simulation, the accuracy of the clustering is
expressed as a percentage, which indicates how often
the threshold sequences are clustered with sequences
from the same host genome.

Results
First, we extracted all Genomic Islands from IslandViewer (December 2009, [28]), amounting to a total of
5447 sequences between 2.2 and 143 kb in size, originating from 339 distinct genomes. After applying the conservative criteria discussed in the Material and Methods
section (genome size > 800 kb, GI size > 10 kb, monochromosomal genomes, no internal conflicts in the clustering approach using the CI-10 cut-off threshold
sequence), we maintained 1787 GIs (33%) that vary in
size from 10 kb to 130 kb (average 20.7 kb, Figure 1).
These GIs are present in 246 genome sequences, which
represent 88 species in 45 genera (Additional File 2).

Figure 1 Size distribution of 1787 Genomic Islands > 10 kb in
246 genome sequences (note the logarithmic scale on the
vertical axis). The GIs are binned per 2 kb in size.

Figure 2 Number of Genomic Islands per genome for the 246
genomes tested (Genome size > 800 kb, with GIs size > 10 kb
and no conflicts).

This means on average 7 GIs per genome, varying from
1 (in 17 genomes) to 27 (in Xanthomonas oryzae MAFF
311018) GIs per genome (Figure 2). These 1787 GIs,
using the compositional threshold of CI-10, were used
in our subsequent investigations, unless noted otherwise.
Second, we analyzed the composition dissimilarities of
these GIs with their respective host chromosomes similar to previous analyses on comparisons between plasmids and host chromosomes [33]. Of the 1787 GIs,
1394 (78%) are compositionally anomalous compared to
their host genome (with a genomic dissimilarity score
higher than that of 90% of the genomic fragments of
equal length, Figure 3). Of these 1394 GIs, a large number (683 GIs, 49%) have a very low GC content compared to fragments of identical length from their
respective host genomes (i.e., lower than 95% of identical sized fragments from their respective genome). Out
of the 1787 GIs, only 11 GIs (0.6%) have a lower genomic dissimilarity with the host genome than with the
threshold sequence CI-10, meaning that these GIs are
compositionally extremely similar to their respective
host genomes (Additional File 2).
Third, we tested all GIs per genome for their compositional dissimilarity. In 86 genomes (of 44 species in 28
genera) we identify 134 clusters, including a total of 271
GIs (15.3% of the 1770 GIs that reside in genomes with
at least 2 GIs, Figure 4, Additional File 3). The number

of clustered GIs per genome varies between the minimal
2 GIs in a single cluster (in 56 genomes), to 15 GIs in a
total of 7 clusters (in the EHEC strain E. coli O157H7
Sakai, Figure 5). The only clusters that contain three
GIs occur in three genomes Bradyrhizobium ORS278,
Escherichia coli O157H7 strain Sakai and Rhodobacter
sphaeroides ATCC 17025. In Bradyrhizobium ORS278,
the three GIs that are clustered together show a high
compositional similarity to the host genome sequence.
Two of these in fact belong to the 11 GIs that are compositionally very similar to their respective genomes,
and therefore these two GIs are unlikely to represent
horizontal transfer events. For E. coli O157H7 strain
Sakai and R. sphaeroides ATCC 17025, we tested
whether the three clustered GIs are more similar than a
set of five sequences belong to the 10% most compositionally similar sequences of the genome (Tables 1 and
2, respectively). We find that for both E. coli O157H7
strain Sakai and R. sphaeroides ATCC 17025, the GIs
that are clustered together in threes, are on average
equally or more similar to each other than the five
sequences that represent the conservative genome signature (Tables 1 and 2).

Figure 5 Clustering of the 24 Genomic Islands > 10 kb in
Escherichia coli O157H7 strain Sakai in seven clusters and nine
singletons. Below the cut-off value (red line; dissimilarity < 1.44, see
Additional File 2), seven clusters are identified (six clusters with two
GIs, and one with three GIs), with a total of 15 Genomic Islands
(indicated with seven colored bars). The GIs and their numbers are
identified in Additional File 5.

In genomes with multiple chromosomes, we test for GIs
that are compositionally very similar to each other, yet
reside on a different replicon. Out of 110 GIs identified
in this set of genomes, 38 GIs are assigned to a total of
19 clusters (Additional File 4). Out of these 38 GIs, ten
(26%), all of them in Burkholderia genomes, are not
located on the same chromosome.
When relaxing the similarity threshold by using the
genome signature difference between the Core Island 25
(CI-25) and the genome, we observe only 1370 GIs in a
total of 220 genome sequences that meet our criteria.
With this more lenient threshold, a total of 16 GIs are
now compositionally more similar to the host genome
than the cut-off sequence CI-25 is to the genome. A
total of 383 GIs (out of 1353 GIs that reside with at
least one other GI in a genome; 28%) are now grouped
together in 185 clusters, with 13 clusters containing
three GIs.
In contrast, when making the composition similarity
threshold substantially more conservative (i.e., using CI5), we find 2047 GIs in a total of 260 genome
sequences. Only 9 GIs are now compositionally more
similar to the host genome when compared to the cutoff sequence CI-5. Still, there are 99 clusters containing
202 GIs (out of 2030 GIs that reside with at least one
other GI in a genome; 10%), which show very high compositional similarity within each cluster (Table 3).
Finally, using threshold CI-0, in which GIs need to be
compositionally more similar to each other than the
genomic fragment that has a nearly identical dinucleotide composition as the host genome, we find only 40
GIs that form 20 clusters. These 40 GIs represent only
1.8% of the total number of GIs included in this
analysis.
Finally, in order to validate the accuracy of the clustered GIs per threshold, we simulated cluster assignments by comparing sets of 100 15 kb fragments from
random prokaryotic genomes for their compositionally
most similar fragment. Each set of 100 fragments consists of three fragments per species, for 30 species of
distinct genera, and includes 10 random synthetic
sequences with no biological significance. For each
threshold, the simulation was carried out 100 times.
Accuracy is expressed as the percentage in which a
sequence is found to be most similar to another
sequence from the same genome. These values are used
as proxies for the correct assignment of a sequence
from the same genome, and range from 99.9% accurate
for the strictest threshold of CI-0, to 94.8% accurate for
the CI-25 threshold (Table 3).

By comparing Genomic Islands from 339 bacterial and
archaeal chromosomes, we explore the dynamics of the

genome-specific acquisition accounts on a large scale.
These analyses show us that in numerous cases, distinct
GIs in particular genomes are remarkably similar in
composition. This leads us to speculate that, using a
conservative similarity cut-off, in 15.3% of the cases,
multiple acquisition events of GIs have taken place from
a donor with a very similar base composition as the
acceptor.
For this goal, we developed a suite of scripts that
allows users to customize these analyses by modifying
the minimal GI length, or the similarity cut-off sequence
(i.e., the genomic Core Island of each genome with a
certain genomic compositional dissimilarity). By increasing the stringency to the very conservative CI-5, which
means that GIs need to be more similar to each other
in composition than 95% of the genomic fragments, we
still find that 10% of the tested GIs can be grouped
together to a total of 99 GI clusters. However, we investigate the accuracy of our assessments by simulating the
clustering efficiency in a randomized sample of
sequences with different thresholds. We find that the
prediction accuracy according to this simulation is >
94,8% even for the least conservative compositional

threshold (CI-25). This gives credibility to our findings
of substantial recurrent transfer events from the same
donor to the same host. In Bradyrhizobium ORS278, we
find a cluster containing three GIs, two of which cannot
be considered compositionally dissimilar from the genome. In this case, these GIs may have been residing for
a substantial amount of time in the genome, and have
ameliorated to the host’s genome composition [34,35].
This approach does not discriminate between separate
introgressions of multiple compositionally very similar
sequences from a common donor, and the post-acquisition intragenomic dispersal of a large Genomic Island.
Technically, this is of little importance, since in both
cases the host of the distinct GIs would be a similar
donor. With respect to compositionally similar GIs that
reside on separate chromosomes, we find that that
incoming GIs seem to be indiscriminate between the
replicon it integrates in, or that subsequent dispersal
throughout the genome can result in a move to a different replicon.
The association of GIs with virulence factors [36]
emphasize the significant role of acquired gene clusters
in the evolution of numerous pathogens. Investigations

The totals represent the total numbers in the original data set from IslandViewer.
*) The percentage of clustered GIs (second last column) excludes 17 GIs from the total number of GIs (third column), since there are 17 genomes with a single GI
only, and with less than two GIs there can be no clustering.
**) Six out of 20 clusters contain in fact largely identical Genomic Islands, which explains their high compositional similarity.

into the repetitive acquisition of GIs from a common
source may help identifying potential donors of these
sequences through for example the association with species-specific sequence motifs such as DNA uptake
sequences [37]. Also, a common origin of compositionally similar clusters may result in common regulatory
modules, interactions or mobilizing capacities. For
example, a study into small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs)
on Genomic Islands in Salmonella typhimurium
revealed that sRNAs mainly affect the expression of
flanking genes [38]. If Genomic Islands disperse
throughout the genome, our analysis would facilitate the
identification of potential associated regulatory targets
that are no longer adjacent.
Unfortunately, the forces that shape the genome signatures of prokaryotes are still unknown. It has been
speculated that they could include species-specific properties such as DNA modifications, replication and repair
mechanisms [20], though recently statistical support has
been found for an environmental influence on the oligonucleotide compositions [39], which could mean that a
similar environment could also cause similarities in genome signature. For compositional comparisons such as
described here, it is of interest to understand what conditions shape the composition of DNA to which extent,
in order to pinpoint potential pitfalls in grouping Genomic Islands.

Conclusions
Even when lacking sequence alignments, numerous large
acquired gene clusters in sequenced genomes can be associated with each other individually via substantial compositional similarities. Our analysis suggests, backed up by
simulations, that in many cases recurring horizontal gene
transfer events have taken place between a donor and
acceptor organism. These analyses do not only quantify
these events, but also enable further investigations into the
origin of these Genomic Islands, and even help analyzing
possible interactions between related sequences.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Example of a GI clustering conflict in Clostridium
botulinum Ba4 657. Example of a GI clustering conflict. In Clostridium
botulinum Ba4 657, six GIs larger than 10 kb are identified by
IslandViewer. The CI-25 threshold sequence has a genomic dissimilarity
to its genome of 30,86. GI-1 and GI-5 are compositionally more similar to
each other (δ* of 22,7), as are GI-2 and GI-5 (δ* of 27,7). However, GI-1
and GI-2 are much more dissimilar (δ* of 42,1), and therefore could be
considered as a clustering conflict.
Additional file 2: Complete table for all genomes that contain GIs.
Complete table for all genomes (> 800 kb) that contain GIs ( > 10 kb),
and have no conflicts in the genome. In green are highlighted the cases
where clusters of three GIs are found. The dissimilarity cut-off is
expressed in the genomic dissimilarity value between the Core Island (in
this case, CI-10) and the genome sequence.
Additional file 3: List of genomes with clustered GIs. List of genomes
with clusters in which more than 1 GI are located, using the
compositional threshold of CI-10.
Additional file 4: Clustered GIs in multichromosomal genomes.
Clusters of GIs in genomes with multiple chromosomes using cut-off of
CI-10. Highlighted in green are clustered GIs that are located on a
different replicon.
Additional file 5: Characteristics of all Genomic Islands in this study.
Characteristics of all Genomic Islands (5447) analyzed in this study,
including their number in the genome of occurrence. The 1787 GIs that
comply with the criteria (Genome > 800 kb, GI size > 10 kb, no conflicts
in the clustering analysis and using cut-off threshold CI-10) are separated
from the rest of the GIs by a blank line.
