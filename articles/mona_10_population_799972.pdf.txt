post-glacial expansion

Abstract
Background: The aurochs (Bos primigenius) was a large bovine that ranged over almost the entirety of the
Eurasian continent and North Africa. It is the wild ancestor of the modern cattle (Bos taurus), and went extinct in
1627 probably as a consequence of human hunting and the progressive reduction of its habitat. To investigate in
detail the genetic history of this species and to compare the population dynamics in different European areas, we
analysed Bos primigenius remains from various sites across Italy.
Results: Fourteen samples provided ancient DNA fragments from the mitochondrial hypervariable region. Our
data, jointly analysed with previously published sequences, support the view that Italian aurochsen were
genetically similar to modern bovine breeds, but very different from northern/central European aurochsen. Bayesian
analyses and coalescent simulations indicate that the genetic variation pattern in both Italian and northern/central
European aurochsen is compatible with demographic stability after the last glaciation. We provide evidence that
signatures of population expansion can erroneously arise in stable aurochsen populations when the different ages
of the samples are not taken into account.
Conclusions: Distinct groups of aurochsen probably inhabited Italy and northern/central Europe after the last
glaciation, respectively. On the contrary, Italian and Fertile Crescent aurochsen likely shared several mtDNA
sequences, now common in modern breeds. We argue that a certain level of genetic homogeneity characterized
aurochs populations in Southern Europe and the Middle East, and also that post-glacial recolonization of northern
and central Europe advanced, without major demographic expansions, from eastern, and not southern, refugia.

Background
Ancient DNA offers the unique opportunity to broaden
the time depth of population genetic analyses. Moreover, it is the only tool capable of deciphering the
demographic histories of extinct species [1-4]. The aurochs, Bos primigenius, was one of two wild bovine species in Europe (Bison bonasus was the other). Probably
as a consequence of human hunting and habitat reduction [5], the aurochs went extinct in 1627, when the last
individual died in Poland. This species most likely

originated in India between 1.5 and 2 MYA ago and
later occupied many parts of Asia, North Africa and
Europe. The first documented remains in Europe dates
back to 275,000 years ago [5]. Its demographic history is
largely unknown and, in particular, it is unclear to what
extent it was shaped by Pleistocene climate changes.
Indeed, the genetic structure and population history of
many European species were largely influenced by the
alternating of glacial and inter-glacial periods [3,6-8].
When modern samples are analysed, refugial areas
generally harbour greater genetic diversity and multiple
phylogenetic clusters with deeply rooted branches that
indicate their antiquity beyond the most recent Ice Age;
conversely, if we exclude the contact zones where

distinct migratory routes mix [9], non-refugial areas display reduced diversity and show only a subset of the
phylogenetic clusters present in the refugia [7]. Based
mainly on genetic evidence of this type, four models
have been proposed to describe the post-glacial recolonization routes in Europe [7,10,11]. The models differ in
the relative contribution of the refugia populations to
the expansion process, and the genetic data analysed for
several species seemed always to fit the predictions of at
least one of these models. Recently, however, a growing
number of studies reports unexpected patterns of diversity [e.g., [12-14], and even within refugia, the genetic
structure might have been much more complex than
previously acknowledged [15]. Recent theoretical studies
(reviewed in [16]) also suggest that a range expansion
from a single refugium can lead to a geographically
structured population, which can be easily misinterpreted as the result of an expansion from multiple distinct refugia. Therefore, the geographic distribution of
genetic clusters might not always be informative for
identifying recolonization routes.
The analysis of DNA from ancient samples represents
a key step to overcome these problems. It opens a
genetic-variation window directly onto the past, useful
to investigate ancient population dynamics and to compare the demographic history of refugial and non-refugial populations [3,17]. In particular, ancient DNA is a
fundamental tool available to investigate aurochs
dynamics. In fact, the aurochs surviving descendents,
cattle, have a complex history of selection and displacement which heavily interferes with any attempt to
reconstruct past events that occurred in the wild.
DNA data from ancient aurochs specimens can also
be informative for the reconstruction of the domestication process (e.g., [18,19]). Recent archaeological evidence suggests that taurine cattle (Bos taurus) were
initially domesticated in the upper Euphrates Valley
around10,000-11,000 years B.P. [20] This single origin
hypothesis implies that present day European breeds,
which belong to the taurine type, all descended from
Fertile Crescent ancestors. The phylogenetic dichotomy
between northern and central European Bos primigenius
(P and E) and Bos taurus (T) mtDNA clades was interpreted as a clear evidence supporting the single origin
hypothesis [19,21,22]. But five Italian pre-domesticate
aurochsen with T haplotypes [18], and a P haplotype
recently found in one Korean cow generically classified
as “beef-cattle” [23] raise doubts about the primigeniustaurus mtDNA distinctiveness, and, as a consequence,
about the single origin hypothesis. As suggested also by
the large genetic diversity in the Italian, compared to
other European breeds [18,23-26], the domestication
process in Europe, or at least in Italy, requires a careful
reconsideration.

For this study we generated partial mtDNA control
region sequences from 14 ancient aurochsen samples
collected from a geographically diverse range of locations across Italy. Samples from Southern refugia are
particularly valuable since DNA preservation is uncommon in warmer climates [27]. Indeed, several aurochs
sequences have been analyzed in northern and central
Europe [19,21,22] but only few sequences have been
described so far from Southern areas [18,22,28]. The
main goals of our study were: i) to investigate the
genetic variability and the demographic history of Italian
aurochsen, especially in comparison with the northern
and central European groups (i.e., comparing a refugia
vs. a non-refugia population); ii) to study whether and
how the analysis of aurochs data collected at different
time intervals (heterochronous sampling) may produce
erroneous conclusions when simple statistics which
assume simultaneous (isochronous) sampling are used;
and iii) to test previous insights suggesting a role for the
Palaeolithic aurochs in the domestication process in
Italy [18].

Results
aDNA laboratory results

The values of amino acid racemization obtained in all
our samples suggested good biochemical preservation
(< 0.10 for aspartic acid). This result appears compatible
with DNA survival [29,30], although some concern have
been raised on the utility of this approach [31,32]. The
alanine D/L and glutamine D/L are lower compared to
the aspartic acid D/L, which is expected since the racemization of alanine and glutamine is slower than that of
aspartic acid. This difference suggests that modern (contaminant) aminoacids are absent [30]. Sporadic contamination is unlikely when the number of molecules that
PCR will use as template (or target DNA) is greater
than 1,000 [30]. By using real-time PCR, we quantified
the number of DNA molecules in the extracts from
20 samples, selected to be representative of different
Palaeolithic and Late Mesolithic sites (Table S1, see
Additional file 1); we found well preserved DNA in 18
of the 20 samples, with numbers of DNA molecules
varying from 1,000 to more than 5,000 (Table S1, see
Additional file 1). After positive extraction and amplification of 14 samples, and cloning of PCR products for
all them, we obtained the entire control region sequence
for one sample; 13 other samples yielded partial
sequences from at least one of the three fragments in
which HVR-I had been subdivided (Table S2, see Additional file 2). Independent replication of extraction,
amplification of the highly variable first fragment (134
bp), and cloning was performed at CEA (Trento) ancient
DNA laboratory for seven bone samples (Table S2, see
Additional file 2). The replicated sequences matched

Mona et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:83
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/83

those obtained in the Florence laboratory (see Table S2,
see Additional file 2). Only sporadic G-to-A change and
C-to-T change were observed in some clones, likely due
to post-mortem cytosine deamination [33]. The Taq
misincorporation value for all 202 cloned sequences was
estimated to be 1.21 substitutions, and 87% of the clones
possessed the consensus sequence. These results suggest
that the DNA templates were not significantly damaged.
Analysis of haplotype diversity

On the basis of the diagnostic sites identified in previous
studies [19,22,25], 12 sequences were assigned to the T
haplogroups and two sequences belong to the P haplogroup (Table S3, see Additional file 3). In other words,
the vast majority of the Italian aurochsen analysed in
this study showed the same type of mtDNA sequence
observed previously in 5 Italian aurochsen [18] and in
all the extant European cattle breeds analysed so far,
though two individuals share the same haplogroup with
the aurochsen from northern and central Europe (and
with a single cattle sequenced in Korea generically classified as “beef cattle” [23]). All the DNA sequences are
available from GenBank under the accession numbers
from GU434117 to GU434130.
The dataset was then reduced to ten sequences using
an overlapping fragment of 120 bp from position 16042
to 16161. These sequences were jointly analysed with 55
previously published aurochs sequences from Italy and
northern/central Europe [18,22], and 800 modern cattle
representing 53 breeds from Europe, Turkey, Middle
East and North Africa (the list of breeds and the sample
sizes are available in Table S4, see Additional file 4). In
this data set, the group of Italian aurochsen (hereafter,
Au-It) and the group of northern and central European
aurochsen (hereafter, Au-NCE) were composed of 15
and 50 individuals respectively. Even though they are
derived from different geographical areas, the Au-NCE
group included specimens with highly similar sequences.
In fact, when Au-NCE was split into three geographic
groups (Britain, east central Europe, and west central
Europe), no significant genetic divergence was found
(AMOVA: Fst = 0.02, P = 0.16). The Fst genetic distances between the two groups of aurochsen and the
modern breeds were graphically represented by a MDS
analysis (Figure 1).
As observed in a previous study based only on five Italian aurochsen [18], the Italian Bos primigenius fell into
the cluster that included all modern breeds in Europe.
North African breeds, due to the prevalence of T1 haplotypes in this region, appear related, but clearly distinct
from European breeds. Conversely, the Bos primigenius
specimens excavated outside Italy, joined here in the
Au-NCE group, and all characterized by P sequences,
are distantly related to all the other modern or ancient

Page 3 of 13

samples. The Fst value between the two ancient groups
(Au-It vs. Au-NCE) was very high (0.727, P < 0.0001),
which is consistent with their haplogroup frequencies.
However, this value needs to be viewed with caution
since the two groups both included samples with different ages; nevertheless, these results clearly suggest the
existence of a strong north-south geographic structure
in this species before domestication, with very limited
gene flow across the Alps.
The phylogeographic structure of the aurochs haplotypes (see Figure 2, where Au-NCE is subdivided as
before into geographic areas) was characterized by three
major clades: 1) T sequences only found in Italy, 2)
P sequences separated among them by no more than two
mutations and distributed throughout the European
regions (including Italy), and 3) a highly divergent
E group found only in one German Neolithic sample
[22]. These results, which are in agreement with previous
analyses based on longer mtDNA fragments [22], indicate
that the 120 bp fragment used in our data-set contains
enough information to discriminate between these clades.
Considering the P group of sequences as representative of the genetic variation in northern and central
Europe (thus excluding the divergent E sequence), a
star-like pattern suggesting a demographic increase in
these area was identified in previous studies [21,22].
The phylogenetic structure in Italy is clearly different: the highly divergent T and P clades, typical of
modern breeds and northern and central European aurochs populations, respectively, are both observed in
pre-Neolithic samples.
Choice of the best fitting demographic model

The demographic history of Bos primigenius in Italy and
northern/central Europe, and the possible differences in
these two areas, was further analysed using BEAST
under two models: constant population size and exponential change. This analysis was performed separately
for the Au-It and the Au-NCE groups.
The Au-NCE data set was reduced to the 37
sequences published and analysed by [22] so that the
sequences retained their full 360 bp fragment size, and
we could also compare our results with those in [22].
Using the natural logarithmic scale of Jeffreys to interpret the Bayes Factor (as reported in [34]), we found
“positive” evidence in favour of the exponential change
model (BF = 3.7). The median value of the posterior distribution of the growth rate, g, was small and negative
(around -2*10-5), i.e. compatible with a limited population contraction. However, the 95% high posterior density, though clearly left-shifted, included zero (Table 1)
suggesting that demographic stability could not be
excluded. In other words, in contrast with the analysis
reported in [22], the data for the northern and central

European aurochs appeared inconsistent with a population expansion: a demographic model with either population size stability or a very limited decline seems more
compatible with the genetic variation pattern.
When the same analysis was applied to the Italian aurochs (Au-It data set), the Bayes Factor was much smaller (1.6 in favour of the exponential change model, “not
worth more than a bare mention” following the Jeffreys
natural logarithmic scale), as well as the estimated
growth rate (see Table 1). A demographic model with
constant population size can therefore explain the Italian aurochs data set, and Au-It showed a long-term
effective population size twice as large as Au-NCE
(Table 1; population sizes are estimated assuming a generation time of 7 years [35]).

The BEAST results contrast with both the very similar
analysis of the Au-NCE data set by [22], and with the
common assumption that the star-like haplotype network in Au-NCE indicates a population expansion. We
will discuss the first point in the next section, after we
first report the results of our investigation of the second
point using a simulation approach. Specifically, we
wanted to understand how readily a star-like haplotype
network could be interpreted as evidence for a population expansion when the samples are heterochronous.
The empirical distributions of Tajima’s D [36] and Fu’s
Fs [37] were used as indicators for the network shape.
The expectation of both these statistics, assuming an
isochronous sampling, is zero under a constant population size model, but becomes negative under a population expansion model which also produces a star-like
genealogy. The effect of pooling DNA data with different ages (heterochronous sampling) on these expectations seems to depend strictly on details of the temporal
sampling scheme[38]. The results we obtained when the
samples ages mirror the aurochs data set reported in
[22] clearly indicate that the distribution of Tajima’s D

and Fu’s Fs are skewed towards negative values not only
when a demographic expansion is simulated, but also
when the population size is constant (see Table 2 and
Figure 3).
Under constant population size, therefore, an artificial
signal of population expansion is likely to arise when

the individuals are not sampled from the same time period. The relationship between the fraction of negative
and significant D and Fs values and the different parameters of the simulations is complex and requires more
systematic investigations (as in a recent publication
[38])). It seems, however, that in all cases where isochronous sampling produces small fractions of

significant statistics (i.e., for g = 0 or g = 0.001), the
fraction of significant statistics produced by a heterochronous sampling is several times larger.
We have so far demonstrated that an expansion signal
can be generated by heterochronous sampling when the
temporal information is not taken into account, and that
coalescent analyses of both Au-It and Au-NCE were

Mona et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:83
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/83

suggestive of a constant, rather than an expanding, population. To further explore this issue, we performed a Bayesian
skyline analysis for both aurochs populations using the ages
of the sequences as temporal information. We then compared the reconstructed skylines with those estimated
assuming that the ancient sequences were sampled simultaneously (isochronous sampling). For clarity of comparison,
the isochronous skylines were depicted assuming that the
sequences were all sampled at 2,000 and 7,000 years B.P.
for Au-NCE and Au-It respectively (i.e., the ages of the
most recent sample). The temporal dynamic of the median
values is shown in Figure 4. Neither Au-NCE nor Au-It
showed evidence of population size changes. However, a
strong signal of population expansion emerged when the
same groups were considered to be composed by isochronous samples (Figure 4). The 95% highest posterior density
(not shown in Figure 4) for all the four analyses was wide,
indicating that the results were not very informative regarding the absolute estimate of Ne. However, the 95% limits
followed the same trend of the median, suggesting that the
overall temporal pattern of Ne was robust.

Discussion
Over the last decade, the study of ancient DNA has proven to be particularly helpful in deciphering the

Page 7 of 13

evolutionary history of populations [39-42], often revealing unexpected demographic dynamics [2-4,14,43-45].
In this study we investigated the mitochondrial genetic
variability of the extinct aurochs.
The distributions of mtDNA haplotypes in Italy and
northern/central European areas are very different.
Sequences belonging to the P clade, typical of northern
and central Europe and not observed in five Italian specimens analysed by [18] were found only in two of the
additional 14 sequences here produced. Overall, the vast
majority of the Italian aurochsen analysed so far (17 out
of 19) have mtDNA sequences belonging to the T clade,
which is the phylogenetic group of sequences observed
in virtually all European cattle breeds.
The genetic similarity between the Italian aurochs and
the European cattle breeds may have important implication for the study and the understanding of the domestication process in this species. Interpretations of the
genetic data over the last 15 years, including two recent
publications [26,28], have supported both single and
multiple origin narratives. It seems, however, that these
two hypotheses are based on extreme, oversimplified
models developed when wild and domestic status could
be determined by mtDNA sequences. Both the process
and the data are more complex. European wild and

beginning of the Linearbandkeramik culture, around
7,500 years ago [46], shared many genotypic as well as
phenotypic traits, and secondary domestication or introgression events possibly occurred in some areas but not
in others.
The remarkable difference between the patterns of
aurochs genetic variation in Italy and in northern/central Europe is one of the two main results of our study,
and confirms the conclusions of a previous study based
on only five Italian aurochsen [18]. The other is the lack
of demographic size fluctuations in this species in both
geographical regions. This latter result conflicts with the
conclusions of two previous studies [22,47] which supported a demographic, possibly postglacial, expansion in
northern and central Europe (Italy was excluded from
these analyses). We discuss in the next three paragraphs
the likely reasons for this discrepancy.
Star-like shapes in sequence networks are commonly
taken as evidence for population expansion, and this
was also inferred for the aurochs considering the structure of the P clade [21,22]. The star-like expectation
[48], however, assumes that all samples have the same
age (isochronous sampling), which is not the case for
the aurochs data. As recently shown by [38], the analysis
of samples with different ages (heterochronous sampling) can introduce a systematic bias in some classical
population genetics analyses, but the direction of the
bias cannot be easily predicted. Using a simulation
approach, we found that a signal of population expansion, as estimated by neutrality tests strictly dependent
on the network shape, can be generated in a population
with a constant size when individuals are sampled at the
same time points as in the aurochs data set. In other
words, the shape of the network in mtDNA sequences
observed in northern and central Europe cannot be
taken per se as evidence for population expansion.
More specifically, [22] concluded for the northern and
central European aurochs that an exponential growth
model gave a better fit than a constant size model, as
indicated by marginal posterior probabilities. Using
the same data set, and comparing the models not on the
basis of the marginal posterior probabilities but on the
basis of the marginal likelihoods using the more statistically sound Bayes factor, we reached different conclusions. There was no support for an exponential growth
model over a constant size model. A similar result was
obtained analysing the Italian aurochsen, where the
Bayes factor in favour of a demographic change model,
as compared to a constant population size model, was
even smaller. The genetic data, therefore, do not support
a demographic expansion and were more compatible
with a model of constant population size. These results
were confirmed when the Bayesian skyline plot was

Page 8 of 13

properly generated taking into account the temporal
structure of the data.
The demographic expansion model for the aurochs
was also suggested in a recent study on several bovine
species [47]. However, in this analysis the estimated
effective population size for the aurochs had a large,
uninformative 95% credible interval of 3*104 - 9*109 and
a median value 2*10 9 (after two independent MCMC
with 108 steps using the input file provided in Ho et al.
2008). In addition, MCMC showed poor mixing and
high autocorrelation for the population size and the
growth rate. This multi-species approach is possibly
uninformative regarding the aurochs demography, and
requires further investigations (Simon Ho, personal
communication).
The Pleistocene glacial and inter-glacial periods heavily impacted genetic variation in many species [6,8,10],
and the steppe-tundra environment in central and
northern Europe during the last glaciation was probably
not suitable for the aurochs [5]. Does the genetic pattern we observed for the aurochs tell us something
about the population dynamics in this species during
the last severe climatic change in Europe?
First of all, genetic variation is higher in Italy compared to northern/central Europe (see also the effective
population size estimates in Table 1), suggesting that a
typical Southern refugium, Italy, might have acted as a
variation reservoir during the glaciations. We can predict a certain degree of genetic homogeneity between
Italy and other South-Eastern Mediterranean areas, considering that i) the Italian aurochs, and the European
and Middle-Eastern cattle breeds, which likely descend
mainly from aurochsen domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, share very similar mtDNA haplotypes; and ii) three
early Neolithic specimens from Syria and Turkey, with a
possible attribution to Bos primigenius [22,28], had T
sequences, i.e. sequences belonging to the mtDNA clade
typical in the Italian aurochs. It is therefore possible
that aurochsen living in several Mediterranean regions,
sharing similar ecological conditions and belonging to a
species with a large migratory potential, exchanged
enough genetic material to maintain a certain degree of
homogeneity. Second, the low frequency of P sequences
in Italy, which are the only sequences found in northern
areas, indicates that these areas were not re-colonized
by Italian or South-Eastern migrants. The high genetic
divergence between Italian and northern/central European aurochsen is compatible with a long-term separation and small levels, if any, of gene flow. Third, the
Bayesian analysis suggests that post-glacial warming and
likely range expansions were not accompanied in the
aurochs by a demographic expansion, at least an expansion intense enough to leave a clear signature on the
pattern of genetic variation.

Mona et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:83
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/83

If these conclusions are correct, we should finally
address the following question: where is the geographical origin of the aurochsen living after the last glaciation
in the northern and central Europe, a region which was
probably re-colonized in warmer times by a group of
migrants without a significant demographic increase?
Armed with the current data we cannot rule out the
hypothesis that the Iberian peninsula was a genetically
divergent refugium in Southern Europe which contributed to the post-glacial colonization. We note however
that the occurrence of continuous gene flow across
southern Europe (including Iberia) was already proposed
for the brown bear [14,49], supporting the idea that the
model of southern refugia in Europe inhabited by
genetically differentiated populations can be violated in
some species. At the same time, the role of eastern, and
not south-eastern, refugia, i.e. areas from the Carpathian
to the Caspian regions, and further East in Asia, might
have been important for the aurochs, as well as for
other species [7,10,50,51]. We should not forget that
some regions in Eastern Asia hosted temperate forests
with large areas of grassland during the last glaciation
[52], where relict populations of aurochsen could have
survived before a post-glacial westwards migration. In
this regard, it is intriguing to consider that a domestic
individual with uncertain origin (possibly belonging to
the Holstein breed) but with a P sequence was recently
reported from a laboratory in Korea [23]. More recently,
a survey of cytochrome b sequences in modern cattle
found a P haplotype in another Holstein cattle as well
as in an individual of the indigenous Korean Youngju
Yellow breed [53]. Additional ancient DNA data from
different areas will possibly clarify this issue.
A final warning

Unfortunately, our conclusions regarding the northern
and central European aurochsen, as well as those
reported in all the other studies on the same topic (e.g.,
[18,19,28]), rely on the assumption that T sequences
were not present before domestication in that area. This
is a plausible view, but the evidence supporting it is limited, since i) the number of pre-Neolithic specimens
excavated and successfully typed from that area is small;
ii) several individuals mainly from Germany, morphologically classified as “Bos sp”, or “Bos taurus/Bos primigenius?”, or “Bos primigenius?” or “Bos taurus?” had T
haplotypes ([28], Supplementary Materials). It seems
therefore that the idea that T haplotypes were absent in
northern and central European aurochsen is not really
based on the accumulation of data in favour of this
hypothesis. Rather, this idea may have more to do with
the results of early studies based on few aurochs
sequences, and with some level of uncertainty in the
morphological attribution of ancient skeletal remains. In

Page 9 of 13

the words of the authors, a more conservative conclusion should be “...there is no conclusive evidence of
aurochs with a T haplotype in Europe” ([22], Supplementary Materials).
Of course, this conclusion should not be applied to
Europe in general, since we have seen that a large fraction of Italian pre-Neolithic aurochsen (where the morphological attribution does not represent a problem)
have T sequences. In conclusion, it is possible that the
geographical distribution of T haplotypes before the
arrival in Europe of domestic breeds was wider than
commonly assumed. If this is true, the pattern of northsouth population divergence in the aurochs could be
less extreme than is described here, and the hypothesis
that modern cattle breeds have ancestors not only in the
Middle East and possibly in Italy[18], but also in other
European regions [54], should be subjected to a robust
investigation.

Conclusion
The remarkable genetic difference between Italian aurochsen and the group of northern/central European aurochsen, and the similarity between the former and
modern taurine breeds, is fully supported by the ancient
mtDNA sequences typed in this study. Using extensive
simulation and Bayesian based coalescent approaches we
found no evidence of a demographic expansion in either
Italian or northern/central European aurochsen groups.
In fact, our observations lead us to conclude that the
previously reported signatures may be artefactual. We
interpret our results as evidence that the aurochs population sizes in southern Europe were not affected by climatic change in the last 30,000 years, and that central
and northern areas in Europe were recolonized after the
last glaciation by eastern immigrants without a major
demographic expansion.
Methods
Samples collection and laboratory analyses

A total of 56 Bos primigenius samples from different
well-studied sites across Italy were analyzed. To avoid
the possible attributions of fragmented remains from
domestic animals to Bos primigenius, we considered
only samples dating before the Neolithic spread of
domestication. Radiocarbon dating of associated remains
(47 samples) or stratigraphic contests (for nine samples)
were used to select the samples to analyse [55-57].
Details of each sample are provided in Table S1 (see
Additional file 1). DNA was extracted for all samples in
the Florence laboratory, and, for a subset of samples
(see below), also in the Trento laboratory. Both laboratories are dedicated exclusively to ancient DNA work.
DNA extractions and PCR set up were carried out in
rooms physically separated from those in which PCR

Mona et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:83
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/83

cyclings and post-PCR analysis were conducted. Multiple measures were undertaken to exclude contamination
and potential artifactual DNA changes (including postmortem damage).
Disposable masks, gloves, and laboratory coats were
worn during the experiments and were changed frequently. Pipettors were UV-irradiated in between use.
DNA extractions and PCR reactions included negative
controls. In each set of extractions or purifications, we
included a negative control, represented by all the
reagents except the bone powder, and these negative
controls, together with blanks (all amplification reagents
minus DNA), were regularly analysed in every PCR
experiment to control for presence of exogenous DNA.
All steps of the analysis were replicated at least twice.
Seven bone specimens were independently extracted,
amplified, cloned and sequenced in the ancient DNA
laboratory of the Centre of Alpine Ecology (Edmund
Mach Fundation, Trento). To test for preservation of
other macromolecules as an indirect evidence for DNA
survival [30,58] we estimated the degree of amino acid
racemization in each sample. Approximately 5 mg of
bone powder were used in this analysis [30]. The
amount of target DNA was quantified in a sub-sample
of specimens by Real Time (RT) PCR.
Ancient DNA analysis in Florence
DNA extraction

All DNA-preparation and extraction methods followed
strictly specific ancient DNA requirements [27,29,59].
To prevent contamination from prior handling, the
outer layer of bones was removed with a rotary tool,
and the fragments were briefly soaked in 10% bleach.
All samples were then irradiated (1 hour under UV
light) and powdered. DNA was extracted by means of a
silica-based protocol (modified from [60]). Two independent extracts were obtained from each remain. Multiple negative controls were included in each extraction.

activation), followed by 50 cycles of PCR (denaturation,
94°C for 45 sec, annealing, 52°C for 1 min and extension, 72°C for 1 min) and final step at 72°C for 10 min.
The 50 μl reaction mix contained 2 U of AmpliTaq
Gold (Applied Biosystems), 200 μM of each dNTP and
1 μM of each primer. The HVR-I (Hyper variable region
one of D-loop Mitochondrial DNA) was subdivided in
three overlapping fragments of 134, 116, and 104 bais
pairs, respectively. Primers used were: L16030 5’-ACAT
TAAATTATATGCCCCATGC-3’; H16165 5’-TTCACG
CGGCATGGTA-3’; L16159 5’-’TTCCTTACCATTA
GATCACGAGC-3; H16276 5’ GATGAGATGGCCCT
GAAGAA-3’; L16267 5’-CAATGAATTTTACCAGG
CAT-3’; H00034 5’-CCAAATGTGACAGCACAG-3’.
Each extract was amplified at least twice. Since overlapping primers were used throughout the PCR amplifications, it is highly unlikely that we amplified a nuclear
insertion rather than the organellar mtDNA.
Cloning and Sequencing

PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning
Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Screening of white recombinant colonies was
accomplished by PCR, transferring the colonies into a
30 μl reaction mix (67 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.8], 2 mM
MgCl2, 1 μM of each primer, 0.125 mM of each dNTP,
0.75 units of Taq Polymerase) containing M13 forward
and reverse universal primers. After 5 min at 92°C, 30
cycles of PCR (30 sec at 90°C, 1 min at 50°C, 1 min at
72°C) were carried out and clones with insert of the
expected size were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis. After purification of these PCR products with
Microcon PCR devices (Amicon), a volume of 1,5 μl was
cycle-sequenced following the BigDye Terminator kit
(Applied Biosystems) using the supplier’s instructions.
The sequence was determined using an Applied BioSystems 3100 DNA sequencer. The clones sequences for
each sample are reported in Table S2 (see Additional
file 2).

Quantification of DNA Molecules

Real-time PCR amplification was performed using Brilliant® SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) in
MX3000P (Stratagene), using 0.5 μM of appropriate primers (reverse primer located at L16030 and forward primer located at H16165). Thermal cycling conditions
were 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 53°C
for 1 min and 72°C for 30 s, followed by SYBR® Green
dissociation curve steep. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the
purified and quantified standard were included in the
experiment to create the standard curve in order to
know the number of initial DNA molecules in the
samples.
Amplification of mtDNA

Two μl of DNA extracted from the bone were amplified
with this profile: 94°C for 10 min (Taq polymerase

Independent replications in Trento

The first DNA fragment, which includes most of the
variable sites, was replicated for seven bone samples in
the CEA laboratory in Trento. The same ancient DNA
protocols followed in Florence were adopted in Trento,
with the exception of the Strata Clone TM PCR Cloning
Kit.
Statistical analyses

A median-joining network [61] among aurochs haplotypes, defined by the segregating sites of the partial
control region stretch (120 bp), was constructed using
the software NETWORK 4.5.0.0 (available at http://
fluxus-engineering.com) with default settings. The level
of divergence between populations/breeds was

Mona et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:83
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/83

estimated using the analysis of molecular variance [62],
as implemented in ARLEQUIN 3.11 [63]. Pairwise Fst
values were simply computed using the number of differences as a molecular distance between alleles, with
standard errors based on 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
The distance matrix was plotted in two dimensions by
means of multidimensional scaling (MDS) using the
ALSCAL algorithm implemented in the SPSS 12.0 software package.
The demography of the Italian aurochs population was
investigated with the software BEAST 1.4.7 [64] using
two different coalescence prior models (constant size
and exponential change) and the HKY model of nucleotide substitution, as selected by MODELTEST 3.7
according to the hierarchical likelihood ratio test
method [65]. The transition/transversion ratio could not
be estimated from the data (because of the presence of
a single transversion in one sample only) and was set as
in [22]; final results are based on Ti/Tv = 50. The
demographic models were run three times for
10,000,000 MCMC iterations with a 20% burnin and a
thinning interval of 1,000, and were compared by means
of the Bayes Factor. Bayes Factor was computed as
twice the difference between the log of the marginal
likelihoods, which were approximated using the harmonic mean as suggested by [34]. Convergence was
checked by examining the generation plot visualized
with TRACER 1.3 [66] and the final estimates were
based on the pooled runs (after removing the burnin).
TMRCA of the whole sample as well as of the T and P
haplogroups were recorded within both demographic
models, after checking that T and P were monophyletic
with posterior probabilities of 1.00 (hence confirming
that the partial control region contained enough information to distinguish between the two haplogroups).
The mutation rate was estimated from the data, using
the ages of the sequences to calibrate the clock. This
procedure is considered more appropriate than using an
external calibration point [67].
To check if the demography of the Italian aurochs differed from that estimated for the northern and central
European aurochs, we analysed the data in [22] with the
same settings as above. We also explored the population
history of the European aurochs to determine whether
heterochronous sampling could skew the distribution of
summary statistics used to detect changes in the effective population size. In this case, we performed a grid of
simulation with various combinations of Ne and growth
rates under a temporal sampling scheme analogous to
that in [22]. Generation time was set to seven years [35]
and mutation rate to 7.6 × 10-7 per site per year (mean
of the posterior distribution of the mutation rate estimated by [22]). The software SERIALSIMCOAL [68]
was used for the simulations. For each scenario we

Page 11 of 13

performed 1,000 replicates, and Tajima’s D and Fu’ Fs
were computed with ARLEQUIN 3.11 [63] as indices of
population size changes. The empirical distribution of
these statistics was reconstructed under various models,
and compared to the null distributions expected assuming an isochronous sampling scheme under the same
coalescent models. For each simulated scenario we computed the percentage of significant tests using the procedure implemented in ARLEQUIN (i.e., assuming an
isochronous sampling scheme).
Finally, a Bayesian skyline plot [69] was constructed
for both the Italian and the northern/central European aurochs population. We ran the analysis twice
for each group. Length of the MCMC was set to
20,000,000 iterations with a 10% burnin and a thinning interval of 1,000. The gene genealogy was
divided into three internodes groups and effective
population size function was fitted with a piecewise
constant function of population size change. The
reconstructed skyline was also compared for both
groups with the skyline estimated assuming an isochronous sampling scheme.
