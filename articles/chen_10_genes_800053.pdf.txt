Abstract
Background: Due to the high morbidity and mortality of fulminant hepatitis, early diagnosis followed by early effective
treatment is the key for prognosis improvement. So far, little is known about the gene expression changes in the early
stage of this serious illness. Identification of the genes related to the very early stage of fulminant hepatitis
development may provide precise clues for early diagnosis.
Results: Balb/C mice were used for ConA injection to induce fulminant hepatitis that was confirmed by pathological
and biochemical examination. After a gene chip-based screening, the data of gene expression in the liver, was further
dissected by ANOVA analysis, gene expression profiles, gene network construction and real-time RT-PCR.
At the very early stage of ConA-triggered fulminant hepatitis, totally 1,473 genes with different expression variations
were identified. Among these, 26 genes were finally selected for further investigation. The data from gene network
analysis demonstrate that two genes, MPDZ and Acsl1, localized in the core of the network.

Conclusions: At the early stages of fulminant hepatitis, expression of twenty-six genes involved in protein transport,
transcription regulation and cell metabolism altered significantly. These genes form a network and have shown strong
correlation with fulminant hepatitis development. Our study provides several potential targets for the early diagnosis of
fulminant hepatitis.

Background
Fulminant hepatitis mainly develops from chronic or
acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. It has been
reported that world widely about 400 million people are
living with chronic HBV infection. While 500,000 people
die from HBV-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma, acute fulminant hepatitis B causes additional
40,000 deaths each year[1].
Despite the significant improvement in the antiviral
treatment targeting HBV infection, the morbidity and
mortality of fulminant hepatitis keep at a high level. This
is at least partly due to our poor understanding of the
pathogenesis of the disease and the lack of early diagnosing/warning system which lead to a delayed medical

intervention. As a serious illness, fulminant hepatitis is
not only a threat to our health, but a big financial burden
to the patient's family. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis at
an early stage is linked directly to an effective treatment,
better recovery and lowered mortality of the disease.
Because it resembles very much the human fulminant
hepatitis, concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis has
long been used as an experimental model of immunemediated liver disease [2]. It is characterized by massive
hepatocellular degeneration and lymphoid infiltration of
the liver [3]. The development of ConA-induced hepatitis
depends mainly upon T cell activation [4] which raises
plasma levels of various cytokines including TNF-α,
interferon (IFN)-γ, and interleukin (IL)-6 [5]. To investigate the pathogenic mechanism of human fulminant hepatitis, in this study, we utilized the ConA-induced
hepatitis model and selected microarray as our primary
detection tool.

Recently, high-throughput gene chip has increasingly
been used to explore the transcription dynamics on a
genome-wide scale. This raises a possibility that similar
approach could be used to identify gene expression at a
specific condition such as the very early stage of fulminant hepatitis. Then the alternations in gene expression
could possibly be used as diagnostic measures. Given this
aim, it is necessary to use statistical methods to help identify genes whose transcript profiles respond to liver damage. In addition, such approach involves modeling the
association of a generic response with a specific experimental variable, such as timing, tissues impacted, temperature, or drug dosage. Therefore, whole genome
expression analysis provides a system-level insight for
understanding crucial factors that control the liver damage and in turn may help us elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of liver injury.
In this study, by using the ConA-induced mouse fulminant hepatitis model, we analyzed the hepatic gene
expression with whole genome mouse GeneChip
(Affymetrix). Through an integrative analysis that combines changes in gene expression with gene function
within a genetic network, we identified 26 genes that may
be related to ConA-induced liver injury.

Results
ConA-injection induces fulminant hepatitis in Balb/C mice

Pathological examination at indicated time periods after
ConA challenge showed that fulminant hepatitis mouse
model was successfully made. As shown in Figure 1, a single injection of ConA led to a clear liver damage as presented by large area of necrosis (Figure 1). In order to

study the changes of very early stage of fulminant hepatitis, liver specimen were taken from the mice at 1 h, 3 h,
and 6 h after ConA administration for the further investigation.
Biochemical evidence for ConA-induced hepatitis

To observe the liver damage in our ConA-induced hepatitis model, we measured by using the classical ReitmanFrankel method the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), serum
total bilirubin (STB) and serum lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH). See details in Table 1.
Genes screened by Gene-chip study

Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the liver has
demonstrated that extensive gene expression occurs during very early-stage fulminant hepatitis. To investigate
the possible gene expression change in our ConAinduced hepatitis model at a very early stage, we performed a gene chip study by using the Affymetrix probe
dataset which includes totally 45101 probes. We found
when compared with probes in the control group, 1559
probes increased and 1794 probes decreased in the 1 h
group, 3040 probes increased and 4160 probes decreased
in the 3 h group, and 5466 probes increased and 5445
probes decreased in the 6 h group. Our data indicate that
by time after ConA injection more and more gene expression is detectable. The in detail gene expression data are
also available at the GEO website under accession number GSE17184: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
Genes further screened by ANOVA and model profile
analysis

ANOVA corrected with the randomized variance model
was performed to determine genes that were expressed
separately and differentially. As a result, total 1,473 genes
that had a p-value and the false discovery rate (FDR) less
than 0.05 were declared to be significantly expressed. The
gene expression value per group was the geometric mean
of the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) normalized gene
signals of 3 samples per time point.
To further narrow the target genes which harbor great
significance among the declared 1,473 genes, we chose to
use the twenty-six model profiles to summarize the
expression pattern of the genes. As shown in Figure 2,
among the 26 patterns, we identified 10 patterns of genes
that shown very significant p-values (colored boxes).
Among these patterns, the two most significant patterns were profiles No. 9 and No.16 according to ascending p-values. While the profile No. 16 contained 118
genes whose expression increased constantly, the profile
No. 9 contained 209 genes whose expression reduced
constantly, after ConA injection (Figure 3).

26 genes identified by Gene Co-expression Network with kcore algorithm from profiles No.9 and No. 16

Genes in profiles No.9 and No.16 were then analyzed and
identified by gene co-expression network with k-core
algorithm to determine which gene or genes may play
pivotal role in the early stage of fulminant hepatitis. Gene
networks are constructed from functional gene associations. In the network, cycle nodes represent genes, and
edges between two nodes represent interactions between

genes, which were quantified by degree. Degrees within
the network which describe the number of single gene
that regulates other genes represent the size of the cycle
node. The higher the degree, the more central the gene
occurs within the network. The clustering coefficient can
be used to estimate the complexity of interactions among
genes that neighbor the core gene with the exception of
core gene participation. The lower the clustering coefficient, the more independent of the core gene are the

Figure 3 Gene expression of profile No.9 and No. 16 in the context of significant ConA-induced liver injury. The profile No.9 (A) contained 209
genes and they decreased in expression consistent with prolonged liver damage after injecting ConA. The profile No.16 (B) had 118 genes and they
increased in expression consistent with prolonged liver damage after the injection. These processes may indicate that the assigned genes closely correlate with the results of regulatory gene expression, including activation and inhibition in the context of liver damage caused by ConA challenge.

interactions among genes in the neighborhood of the
core gene[6].
A k-core of a gene co-expression network usually contains cohesive groups of genes. On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis classifies genes into groups based on the
similarity of base sequences[7].
The k-core subnetwork with higher k-core level in our
result is considered to have a core status within a largescale gene network made up of differential 26 genes (see
Figure 4 and Table 2). Most of the genes are attributed to
transport, transcription, regulation of transcription, metabolic processes, and carbohydrate metabolic processes,
consistent with the gene ontology hierarchical category,
lipoprotein catabolic processes, peptide biosynthetic processes, positive regulation of calcium-dependent cell-cell
adhesion, fructosamine metabolic processes, male sex
differentiation, and regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis.
The core genes MPDZ and ACSL1 appear at the center of
both the large-scale network and the 11 k-core subnetwork. They directly regulate 34 neighboring genes that
interact according to their degrees. These interactions
depend in large part on MPDZ and ACSL1 because the
clustering coefficients of these genes are 0.38 and 0.42,
which are lower than for other genes.
In this network, transmembrane proteins, such as
MPDZ and Acsl1, were shown to play a role in the important processes of cell adhesion, carbohydrate metabolism
and molecular transport. However, MPDZ expression
constantly decreased over the four time points. It may
contribute to damage to cell junctions in liver cells. The
result of MPDZ down expression may be related to disorders of liver tissue and may lead to obstacles in the carbo-

hydrate metabolic process. Acs11 was an essential gene
that was associated with long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA synthase activity. The under expression of the gene gives rise
to a series of obstructions in lipid and cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes.
Real-time RT-PCR verification of the genes

Real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm the expression of
the 26 genes. Compared with normal controls, the
expression of most of the 26 genes showed a statistical
significant change (p < 0.05). Expressions of PARD3,
ALDH8A1, CMTM8 and FBXO3 were also higher than
those of normal controls, but there was no statistical significance (p > 0.05) (See details in Table 3 and the primers
see in Additional file 1).

Discussion
In this study, use of a fulminant hepatitis mouse model,
we have focused on hepatic gene expression during early
stages of fulminant hepatitis. By a series of biological and
bioinformatics analysis, we identified 26 genes whose
expression are significantly altered at the very early stage
and have shown big correlations with fulminant hepatitis.
Using gene chips has the advantage of generating huge
amounts of information. The high cost of microarray
experiments and limited sample availability resulted in a
small sample size for each treatment group. In addition,
because we had to filter differential genes, our two-group
comparison accuracy was reduced because variance estimates have few degrees of freedom. Consequently, we
obtained results with more power and less variation by

using the random variance model corrected standard ttest or ANOVA methodology [8].
We predefined certain sets of profiles in the context of
patterns that can be expected in the course of growth. On
account of the noise and the small number of points for
each gene, any one pattern will be shared by many genes
and can be expected to appear by chance. First, we
selected a set of potential expression profiles. These sets
of profiles cover all of the possible profiles that can be
generated by gene expression in the course of growth, and
each represents a single temporal expression pattern.
Enrichment of genes in each profile was then used to
measure the profile significance level. Significant profiles
may indicate that there were mostly common functions
attributed to genes that are co-expressed. Such functions
mainly influence the biological character [9].

In biological processes, macromolecular networks can
be constructed by the experience results from such as Y2H, and coimmunoprecipitation, or from the algorithmic
predict base on the gene function correlation and expression profiles. Because of the flexibility of the network
model base on the algorithmic predict from high
throughput gene expression tests, we can look at snapshots of protein-protein interaction, gene expression regulatory networks and metabolism networks among
different groups. The intrinsic gene networks of a phenotype can represent gene function propriety of sample. kcores and degrees of genes are key attributes in the network. A k-core of a network is a subgraph in which all
genes are connected to at least k other genes in the subgraph [6]. In a protein-protein interaction network, a
node represents a protein and an edge represents an
interaction between proteins. In this work, we use k-cores

Degrees describe the number of single gene that regulates other genes represent the size of the cycle node. The higher the degree, the more
central the gene occurs within the network. The clustering coefficient can be used to estimate the complexity of interactions among genes
that neighbor the core gene with the exception of core gene participation. The lower the clustering coefficients, the more independent of
the core gene are the interactions among genes in the neighborhood of the core gene. A k-core of a gene co-expression network usually
contains cohesive groups of genes. The higher the k-core, the more central the genes occurs within the network. In this study, the top k-value
is 11, which is considered to have a core status within a large-scale gene network made up of differential genes from profiles No.9 and No. 16.

of protein-protein interaction networks to define main
gene function in main subgraph. The rank of k-core value
describes the complexity of gene association relationship.
The complexity of gene relationship increased with kcore value rank. We wanted to find main Gene Ontology
(GO) assigned by the maximum numbers of genes in separately k-core and then define the key gene functions at
each complexity level of network [7]. For this analysis
result, we conclude the core functions at the core status
of network which have a top k-core level.
Regulation of gene expression as well as protein-protein
interactions can change in a dynamic process over time.
Such processes may exhibit a regulatory character. These
macromolecular networks respond to the events such as
growth, metabolism, and apoptosis. Because certain gene
interactions are only observable under very specific conditions, we combined experimental data to model coexpression networks from different types of experiments.
One of the important reasons for doing this was the fact
that differential macromolecular network structures have
different sources. In this study, twenty-six genes were
selected using the network, and validated by Real-time
RT-PCR. Compared with normal controls, the expression
of most of the 26 genes appeared a statistical significant
change (p < 0.05).
A very important issue about the results from a genechip-based analysis is their correlation to the actual biological processes. Many of the 26 genes identified in this
study including MPDZ and ACSL1 are involved in the
metabolism of liver cells. Although the expression of
these genes may not be specifically initiated or suppressed by fulminant hepatitis, the emergence or inhibition of the genes at the very early stage of fulminant
hepatitis could be followed by severe liver damage, the
pathological hallmark of fulminant hepatitis presented as
large area of necrosis, thereby supplying potential diagnostic information for clinical fulminant hepatitis. In this
study, we employed a ConA-induced animal fulminant

hepatitis model instead of the use of human tissue which
is extremely tough to obtain. As mentioned earlier,
ConA-induced hepatitis has broadly been used as an
experimental model of immune-mediated liver disease.
Our pathological and biochemical data further confirmed
that the model resembles very much the human fulminant hepatitis. Therefore, our results may provide important referential merit for clinical investigation.
Nevertheless, in all conscience, the genes identified here
are required to be further dissected and confirmed in
human by other clinic-related studies.

Conclusions
At the early stages of fulminant hepatitis induced by
ConA, expression of twenty-six genes involved in protein
transport, transcription regulation and cell metabolism
altered significantly. These genes form a network and
have shown strong correlation with fulminant hepatitis
development and a promising future for early diagnosis.
Our study provides several potential targets for the early
diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis in clinical scenario.

Histology

First-Strand cDNA Synthesis

The livers were removed, and part of each liver was frozen in liquid nitrogen, while another part was fixed with
4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded
in paraffin. Tissue sections (4 μm) were prepared and
stained with hematoxylin/eosin; sections were then
examined under light microscopy.

Total RNA (1 μg to 15 μg) and 2 μL of 50 μM T7-Oligo
(dT) Primer were mixed together in a 0.2 mL PCR tube,
and RNase-free water was added to create a final volume
of 12 μL. The tubes were gently flicked a few times to mix
the solution, and then the tubes were briefly centrifuged
to collect the reaction products and reagents at the bottom of the tube. The reaction was incubated for 10 minutes at 70°C. The sample was cooled at 4°C for at least 2
minutes. Subsequently, 4 μL of 5× 1st Strand Reaction
Mix, 2 μL of 0.1 M DTT, 1 μL of 10 mM dNTP, were combined and mixed thoroughly by flicking the tube a few
times. The tubes were centrifuged briefly to collect the
reaction products and reagents at the bottom of the tube,
and the tubes were immediately placed in a 42°C environment. SuperScript II (1 μL) was added to each RNA sample for a final volume of 20 μL. The RNA was incubated
for 1 hour at 42°C; finally, the sample was cooled for at
least 2 minutes at 4°C.

Biochemical detection

The extent of liver injury was assessed by determining
serum ALT, AST, STB and LDH activity levels using the
standard Reitman-Frankel method.
Isolation of RNA

Liver samples from very early stage of fulminant hepatitis
mouse model, which include control group, 1 hour 3
hours and 6 hours after the injection of ConA, were
ground into a fine powder in a mortar cooled by liquid
nitrogen, and 100 mg was added to 1 ml prechilled Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA extractions were performed according to the manufacturer's
directions, and the RNA was further purified by passage
through RNeasy mini-columns (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer's protocols for RNA cleanup. Final RNA preparations were resuspended in RNasefree water and stored at -80°C. The RNA samples were
quantified spectrophotometrically, and purity and integrity were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. All samples exhibited 260/280 absorbance ratios of
approximately 2.0, and all showed intact ribosomal 28S
and 18S RNA bands in an approximate ratio of 2:1 as
visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Second-Strand cDNA Synthesis

RNase-free water 91 μL, 30 μL of 5× 2nd Strand Reaction
Mix, 3 μL of 10 mM dNTP, 1 μL of E. coli DNA ligase, 4
μL of E. coli DNA Polymerase I, and 1 μL of RNase H
were mixed by gently flicking the tube a few times. The
tubes were centrifuged briefly to collect solids at the bottom of the tube. We added 20 μL of the First-Strand
cDNA synthesized as described above. The tube was
flicked gently a few times to mix the solution, and then
the samples were centrifuged briefly to collect any reaction products and reagents at the bottom of the tube. The
cDNA was incubated for 2 hours at 16°C. 2 μL of T4 DNA
Polymerase was added to each sample, and the tubes were

Affymetrix GeneChips Mouse 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). This product analyzes the
expression level for over 39,000 transcripts and variants,
including over 34,000 well-substantiated mouse genes.
Data Analysis
Significant Differential Gene Analysis

The per-group gene expression value was the geometric
mean of RMA normalized gene signals from 3 samples
per time point. Due to the fact that the number of samples per class (i.e., three samples per group) was far lower
than the number of genes, there were few degrees of freedom for the gene expression signal variance. The low
number of degrees of freedom makes an accurate estimation of variability difficult. Significant differential genes
among the three groups were filtered by ANOVA and
corrected by the random variance model (RVM)[8]. In
this experiment, the differential genes from different time
points were filtered by RVM ANOVA. To assess the significance of a particular sample having occurred by random chance, the false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated
to allow us to determine whether certain genes were actually significant by repeating the comparison test and the
permutation test 1000 times. The threshold of truly significant genes was taken to be p-value < 0.05 and FDR <
0.05.
Time Sequence Profile Analysis of Gene Expression

We first select a set of distinct and representative temporal expression profiles independent of the data. These
model profiles correspond to possible profiles of a gene's
change in expression over time. Passing the data normal3

each gene is assigned to the model profile that most

closely matches the gene's expression profile as determined by the correlation coefficient. Since the model
profiles were selected independent of the data, the algorithm can then determine which profiles have a statistically significant higher number if genes assigned using a
permutation test. This test determines an assignment of
genes to model profiles using a large number of permutations of the time points. It then uses standard hypothesis
testing to determine which model profiles have signifi-

time points compared to the average number assigned to
model profiles can either be analyzed independently, or
grouped together based on similarity to form clusters of
significant profiles.
Construction and Topological Analysis of the Gene CoExpression Network

In biological processes, macromolecular networks can be
constructed by using results from experiments involving
Y-2H, coimmunoprecipitation [10], or algorithmic predictions that may be based on gene function correlation
and expression profiles [11]. Because of the flexibility of
network models based on algorithmic predictions that
derive from high-throughput gene expression tests, we
can look at snapshots of protein-protein interactions,
gene expression regulatory networks and metabolic networks among different groups [12]. Gene networks are
constructed from functional gene associations. In the
network, cycle nodes represent genes, and edges between
two nodes represent interactions between genes. As network elements represent the ways in which genes may
regulate other genes, large scale gene networks can be
divided into certain subgraphs, named k-core networks,
in which all genes are connected to at least k other genes
in the subgraph [7]. As a result, the rank of k-core value
describes the complexity of the gene association relationship. Cycles with identical colors are part of the same
subgraph. In light of the definition of k-core networks,
core status within large scale gene networks consists of
subgraphs that are associated with higher k values. The
complexity of gene relationships increases with k-core
value rank. The intrinsic gene network of a given phenotype can represent gene function propriety within a sample. In this work, we use k-cores of protein-protein
interaction networks to define major gene functions in
the main subgraph. We wanted to identify the main GO
on the basis of the maximum number of genes in separate
k-cores and then we wished to define the key gene functions at each complexity level of the network [13]. We
transformed the normalized expression value of the Pearson correlation into measures of pairwise connection
strengths [12]. We selected genes from the two most significant profiles, namely profiles 9 and 16, to construct a
co-expression network. The network edges were specified to feature correlation coefficients of above 0.9, to
ensure strong gene co-expression relationships. The centrality of the network is represented by the central degree
[6]. It is possible to identify characteristic distance variables among genes. We attempted to describe the contri-

bution that gene i makes to the status (i.e., the
determining central status) of gene j in the network. The
maximum core order is termed the main core or the highest k-core of the graph[7]. A k-core subgraph can be generated by recursively deleting the vertices from a graph
whose degree is less than k [7]. Larger values clearly correspond to vertices with larger degrees and more central
positions in the network structure. In this work, we apply
the notion of k-core subgraphing to predict gene function
similarity [13]. The nodes labeled by the same color may
represent similar gene ontology terms. The highlighted
ontologies of same-colored nodes were assessed by
counting genes that featured the same gene ontology and
the same color.
Real-time RT-PCR confirmation of differentially expressed
genes

Real-time RT-PCR was used to verify the differential
expression of twenty-six genes that were detected by the
Affymetrix GeneChip. The primers used are listed in
Additional file 1. Each real-time RT-PCR reaction (in 25
μL) contained 2×SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix,
0.4 μM primers, and 0.5 μL of template cDNA. The
cycling conditions consisted of an initial, single cycle of 5
min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 30
sec at 54°C, 15 sec at 72°C, and fluorescence acquisition
at 83°C for 1 sec. The cDNA was synthesized using
reverse transcriptase (Promega), oligo(dT) and random
primers with 5 μg RNA from the same samples as those
used in the microarray. The PCR amplifications were performed in duplicate for each sample. The gene expression
levels were quantified relative to the expression of β-actin
by employing an optimized comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) value
method. The differences in gene expression levels
between groups were compared using the Student's t-test.
A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
