Abstract
Background: The architecture of biological networks has been reported to exhibit high level of
modularity, and to some extent, topological modules of networks overlap with known functional
modules. However, how the modular topology of the molecular network affects the evolution of
its member proteins remains unclear.
Results: In this work, the functional and evolutionary modularity of Homo sapiens (H. sapiens)
metabolic network were investigated from a topological point of view. Network decomposition
shows that the metabolic network is organized in a highly modular core-periphery way, in which
the core modules are tightly linked together and perform basic metabolism functions, whereas the
periphery modules only interact with few modules and accomplish relatively independent and
specialized functions. Moreover, over half of the modules exhibit co-evolutionary feature and
belong to specific evolutionary ages. Peripheral modules tend to evolve more cohesively and faster
than core modules do.
Conclusion: The correlation between functional, evolutionary and topological modularity
suggests that the evolutionary history and functional requirements of metabolic systems have been
imprinted in the architecture of metabolic networks. Such systems level analysis could demonstrate
how the evolution of genes may be placed in a genome-scale network context, giving a novel
perspective on molecular evolution.

Background
Cellular functions are carried out in a modular way, and
functional modules are basic building blocks of cellular
organization [1]. From the perspective of molecular biology, a functional module is regarded as a group of spatially isolated or chemically specific biological
components that work together for a discrete biological

function. Various functional modules such as protein
complexes [2-4], signalling/metabolic pathways [5-8] and
transcriptional clusters [9,10] have been detected from
functional genomic techniques or bioinformatics analyses
of genomic data. Recent studies suggest, to varying
degrees, functional modules correlate with evolutionary
modules [11], the latter being defined as cohesive evolu-

tionary blocks in cellular systems [12,13]. It was found
that genes within functional modules tend to evolve in a
coordinated way [12-15], while some fraction of evolutionary modules (or phylogenetic modules) agree well
with known functional modules [16-19].

nodes correspond to metabolites and arcs correspond to
enzyme-catalyzed reactions between these metabolites
[44]. The metabolic network of H. sapiens consists of 1378
metabolites and 666 enzymes, with the biggest connected
cluster includes 948 metabolites and 614 enzymes.

On the other hand, purely topological analysis by graphtheoretic methods has revealed that molecular networks,
such as protein interaction [20-22], gene regulatory
[23,24] and metabolic networks [25-30], consist of topological modules – densely connected sub-networks within
which there is a high density of edges, and between which
there is a lower density of edges [31]. Since graph-theoretic methods analyze networks from topological point of
view using minimal prior knowledge about biological
function or evolution, they have the potential to shed new
light on biological systems based on the unbiased structural information [32]. Actually, numerous studies have
demonstrated, to some extent, topological modules in
molecular networks tend to be functionally modularized
[20-30]. Furthermore, studying molecular evolution from
the viewpoint of network architecture is becoming a subject of current interest. Some recent studies suggested that
the node degrees of molecular networks may constrain the
evolution of proteins [33-38], and protein interaction
hubs situated within modules are more evolutionarily
constrained than those bridging different modules
[39,40]. However, little has been known about how network modularity affects protein evolution. Thus more
studies are expected to reveal the possible correlation
between topological modules and evolutionary modules
in molecular networks.

The simulated annealing algorithm [28] was utilized to
decompose the metabolic network. Totally 25 topologically compact modules were obtained. In Figure 1 we display the decomposition result as a network of modules, in
which each node corresponds to a module and is represented by the functional cartography [28].

In this study, we ask to which extent the identified topological modules of metabolic networks co-evolve. We
explore this question by analysing the metabolic network
of H. sapiens (hsa) reconstructed from the KEGG database
[41-43]. We first break up the metabolic network into
modules by the simulated annealing algorithm proposed
in [28] and study the linkage pattern between modules.
Then we investigate the evidence for co-evolution of modules by analysing the phylogenetic profiles, evolutionary
ages and evolutionary rates of enzyme genes within modules. To mine the inherent relations between structure,
function and evolution of metabolic networks, the features from H. sapiens network were then compared with
those of the properly randomized counterparts, here, topological null model and biological null model, respectively.

Results and discussion
Identifying topological modules and their functions
We reconstructed the metabolic network of H. sapiens
from the KEGG database [41-43] and represented the network by a directed substrate graph in such a way that the

Figure 1 exhibits a global view of interactions between
modules, suggesting that the modules are linked in a coreperiphery organized pattern [45,46]. Some modules interact frequently and are interconnected densely to form a
core, while others such as module 3, 6, 7 and 14 communicate with only one or two other modules and reside in
the periphery of the network. We define the inter-module
degree of one module as the number of its links with other
modules, where a link by a bi-directed arc is counted as
degree 2. Hence core modules have high inter-module
degrees, while periphery modules have low inter-module
degrees.
Further investigation revealed that most periphery modules correspond to a well-defined single pathway and perform relatively independent function. On the contrary,
the core modules are mixtures of several conventional
biochemical pathways, thus are difficult to be assigned a
simple function. Table 1 shows that the periphery modules carry out two categories of functions: catabolism of
essential human nutrients taken from the diet (essential
lipids, amino acids and vitamins), biosynthesis and
metabolism for complex molecules (hormones, glycans
and cofactors), whereas the core modules generally perform basic metabolisms of sugars, amino acids, lipids and
nucleotides. Since the H. sapiens metabolic network does
not include biosynthetic pathways for essential human
nutrients, the pathways for processing these substrates
may have functioned in characterizing the species during
evolutionary diversification. On the other hand, owing to
the function of hormones and glycans in mediating cell
recognition, communication, and signal transduction, the
ability to produce and utilize these complex molecules
may have led the species to develop an advanced neural
system for physiological regulation along the evolutionary process [47]. Thus the functions performed by periphery modules could be regarded as some high-level
metabolisms specialized for H. sapiens, whereas the core
modules are integrated to accomplish housekeeping processes of life. Especially, the three central pathways –
Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP), tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are broken

Figure 1
Cartographic representation of the metabolic network for H. sapiens
Cartographic representation of the metabolic network for H. sapiens. Each circle represents a module and is coloured according to the KEGG pathway classification of the reactions belonging to it, while the arcs reflect the connection
between clusters. The area of each colour in one circle is proportional to the number of reactions that belong to the corresponding metabolism. The width of an arc is proportional to the number of reactions between the two corresponding modules. For simplicity, bi-directed arcs are presented by grey edges. The modularity metric of this decomposition is 0.8868.

up into several core modules, mainly in module 8, 11 and
13. One possible explanation is that the metabolites in
these central pathways are used as common precursors for
biosynthesis of universal building blocks [48] and are
thus placed in different modules. In addition, these
metabolites have two or more functional classifications
and that they may get assigned to different modules based
on features other than the central pathway they belong to.
This result agrees with earlier observations concerning the
high diversity of the TCA and EMP pathway [49,50], as
well as the clustering results for Escherichia coli (E. coli)
metabolic network obtained by other algorithms
[19,25,26,30].
The similarity between the phylogenetic profiles of
enzymes within modules
The phylogenetic profiles of any pair of enzymes can be
compared to determine whether these two enzymes
exhibit significant co-occurrence, so as to result in similar

phylogenetic profiles. We adopted the Jaccard coefficient
(JC) to measure the similarity between the phylogenetic
profiles of enzyme pairs. Figure 2(A) shows the distribution of JC for all pairwise enzymes in the H. sapiens metabolic network. It can be seen that most enzyme pairs
exhibit low extent of similarity on their phylogenetic profiles. The average JC of the global network is 0.28. The significant level P (0.05) of the distribution is 0.66, i.e., the
probability of enzyme pairs with JC bigger than 0.66 is
only 0.05. Thus we set JC of 0.66 as a threshold of similarity between phylogenetic profiles and regard enzyme pairs
whose JC are bigger than 0.66 as having similar phylogenetic profiles. Figure 2(B) illustrates the relationship
between the average JC for enzyme pairs within modules
and the inter-module degree of module (Spearman's rank
correlation is r = -0.3814, P-value is 0.059), suggesting a
statistically negative correlation tendency between these
two variables. Since modules with high inter-module
degrees are core modules, and those with low inter-mod-

ule degrees are periphery modules, this result means that
enzymes within periphery modules have higher extent of
similar phylogenetic profiles than those within core modules.

We compare the similarity of phylogenetic profiles for
enzyme pairs within each module with that within the
global network. Figure 3(A) shows that enzyme pairs
within most modules have higher average JC than those
within the global network, and Figure 3(B) demonstrates
that most modules include high percentage of enzymes
with similar phylogenetic profiles. We used hypergeometric cumulative distribution [51] to quantitatively measure
whether a module is more enriched with enzymes of similar phylogenetic profiles (JC ≥ 0.66) than that by chance.
Given significance level α = 0.05, a P-value smaller than α
demonstrates low probability that the enzymes of similar
phylogenetic profiles appear in the same module by
chance.
Integrating these three measures, we regard a module as
an evolutionary module enriched with enzymes of similar
phylogenetic profiles, if it satisfies all of the following
three criteria:
(1) Average JC of the module is bigger than that of the global network.
(2) The fraction of enzyme pairs with JC ≥ 0.66 (definition
of a threshold) in the module is significantly bigger than
0.05, i.e., the fraction of that in the global network. We set
the cutoff to 0.1.
(3) The P-value is smaller than α = 0.05.
As shown in Figure 3, all modules except module 2 satisfy
the criteria (1), in which 13 modules (module 7, 3, 25, 9,
16, 4, 6, 22, 12, 15, 19, 21 and 20) also satisfy the criteria
(2). Of the 13 modules, only the P-value of module 20,
which equals to 0.50067, is bigger than 0.05. That is to
say, although the average JC of enzyme pairs in module 20
is big enough, and this module also includes a high fraction of enzymes with similar phylogenetic profiles, this
case has a high probability to occur by chance. Thus module 20 could not be regarded as an evolutionary module
by our criteria.
In summary, a total of 12 modules out of 25 (module 7,
3, 25, 9, 16, 4, 6, 22, 12, 15, 19 and 21) were found to be
evolutionary modules, most of which are periphery modules. The inter-modules degree of eight modules are less
than 5, suggesting that periphery modules behave more
cohesively in evolution than core modules. That is to say,
enzyme genes within periphery modules have higher tendency to be gained/lost together than those within core
modules.
The evolutionary ages of modules
We classified enzyme genes in the H. sapiens network into
seven evolutionary ages: Prokaryota, Protists, Fungi, Nem-

atodes, Arthropods, Mammalian and Human. Hypergeometric cumulative distribution [51] was used to measure
whether a module is more enriched with enzymes from a
particular evolutionary age than would be expected by
chance. Given significance level α = 0.05, a P-value
smaller than α demonstrates low probability that the
enzyme genes of a particular evolution age have appeared
by
chance.
We defined the evolutionary age of a module as the biggest value of the evolutionary age of enzymes included in
this module, which satisfies all of the two criteria:
(1) More than 1/3 enzymes of this module belong to the
evolutionary age;
(2) The corresponding P-value is smaller than α = 0.05.
According to this definition, a total of 16 modules appear
to belong to one specific evolutionary age. See Table 2 for
the evolutionary age, percentage of enzymes in the specific age, P-value and inter-module degree for each module. As can be seen in Table 2, all of the age-1 modules
except for module 12 are core modules, while the modules with later evolutionary ages are periphery modules.
Figure 4 shows the statistically significant negative correlation between evolutionary age of modules and average
inter-module degrees. The Spearman's rank correlation
between evolutionary age and inter-module degree is r = 0.8207 (P-value = 9.78 × 10-5).

The distribution feature of core and periphery modules in
different evolutionary ages provides some evidence for the
evolutionary history of metabolic networks. Matching the
evolutionary ages of modules with their functions suggests how ancient cellular functions may have evolved to
gain new phenotypes with improved adaptation: the core
modules appeared earlier in evolution and communicate
frequently to perform the basic functions, while the

periphery modules "sprout" from the compactly interconnected core modules later via sparse linkages to carry
out some novel, specialized functions. In this way, the
housekeeping functions are conserved in core modules
while functional specialization is achieved by extending
periphery modules.
Evolutionary rates of constituent enzyme genes of modules
We adopted the evolutionary rate to estimate the evolutionary constraints on metabolic enzymes. A small value
of evolutionary rate suggests a smaller fraction of accepted
amino acid substitutions (see Methods part), hence a
higher evolutionary constraint on the enzyme. We
extracted the evolutionary rate of each enzyme gene
included in the H. sapiens metabolic network from the
HomoloGene database [52], computed by the approaches
in [53]. Then the evolutionary rates were averaged over all
enzyme genes within the same module.

The relationship between average evolutionary rate of
enzyme genes within modules and inter-module degrees
is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5(A) indicates a statistically
significant negative correlation between the average evolutionary rate of module and inter-module degree (Spearman's rank correlation is r = -0.4983, P-value = 0.011.).
The histogram of average evolutionary rate of modules
versus binned inter-module degree is displayed in Figure
5(B), indicating that enzymes in core modules evolve
more slowly than those in periphery modules. That is to
say, core modules have higher evolutionary constraints,
thus are more evolutionarily conserved than periphery
modules. This observation is in agreement with the
housekeeping functions of core modules.

Comparison of the H. sapiens network with its randomised
counterparts
In order to investigate whether the topological, functional
and evolutionary features of modularity we presented
above are intrinsic for metabolic networks, we constructed
two versions of randomised counterparts for the H. sapiens
metabolic network and compared them with the real network.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/311

The first version of randomized network, called topological null model, was constructed by rewiring the links
between nodes while preserving some low-level topological properties of the H. sapiens metabolic network. When
shuffling the links, considering that the distribution of bidirected arcs is an inherent topological feature of metabolic networks [54], we kept not only the degree of each
node [55,56], but also the total number of directed and
bi-directed arcs of the metabolic network (see the algorithm in [30]). Totally 50 random networks were generated and then decomposed by simulated annealing,
resulting in mean modularity metric 0.7804 and the
standard deviation 0.0056. The modularity metric of the
H. sapiens metabolic network is 0.8868, 19 multiples of
standard deviation above that of the randomized counterparts, suggesting that the higher modularity of H. sapiens
network is unlikely to arise by chance. Moreover, as
shown in Figure 6 and Table A2 of additional file [see
Additional file 1], the modules of the random network are
so densely connected that their linkage pattern does not
show a clear-cut core-periphery dichotomy. These comparisons indicate that the highly modular core-periphery
organization of H. sapiens network could be an intrinsic
topological character of metabolic networks, rather than a
random phenomenon.
We generated the second version of randomized network,
called biological null model, through shuffling the
enzymes that catalyze the reactions while preserving the
network topology. At each step of randomization, we ran-

domly chose two reactions that are catalyzed by different
enzymes and then exchanged the enzymes catalyzing
them. For one randomized network, we performed the
same analysis about the functional distributions, phylogenic profiles, evolutionary ages, and evolutionary rates of
its topological modules as we did for the H. sapiens network. Although the randomized network has the same
topology as the H. sapiens network, its topological modules are high heterogeneity of reactions from different
pathways [see Figure A1 of Additional file 1], thus could
not be functional specific modules. From evolutionary
view, enzymes within the same modules do not exhibit
similar phylogenic profiles [see Figure A2 of Additional
file 1]; neither the modules have specific evolutionary
ages. In addition, the correlation between the average evolutionary rates of modules and the inter-module degrees
is not statistically significant (Spearman's rank correlation
between evolutionary rate and inter-module degrees was
calculated as r = -0.0553, P-value = 0.793). These results
demonstrate that the topological modules of the biological null model show absence of evolutionary modularity.
Therefore, the functional and evolutionary modularity of
topological modules could be inherent for metabolic networks.

Conclusion
In this study we have conducted a system-level survey
about how evolution of enzyme genes is related to the
structure and function of metabolic networks. From topological point of view, metabolic networks exhibit highly
modular core-periphery organization pattern. Furthermore, the core modules are more evolutionarily conserved and perform some housekeeping metabolism
functions, while the periphery modules appear later in
evolution history and accomplish relatively specific functions. Our results suggest that the core-periphery modularity organization reflects the functional and
evolutionary requirements of metabolic systems. The
denser inter-connections between core modules may offer
effectual protections to the basic metabolic process and
keep the robustness of the metabolic system. On the other
hand, the looser inter-linkages of periphery modules
could function in favour of the flexibility and evolutionary ability of the system, so that the mutation or evolution
of these parts may generate new phenotypes with
improved adaptation while not significantly affecting
other modules or even causing malfunction of the whole
system. Our observation may shed light on a more global
understanding of the topology, function and evolution
for metabolic networks.

Methods
Data preparation and network reconstruction
In this study, the metabolic network of H. sapiens (hsa)
was reconstructed using data downloaded (in May 2006)
from the FTP service of KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes). The "hsa_enzyme.list" file in the
GENOME section of the KEGG database includes a list of
the known enzymes encoded by H. sapiens's genome and
the corresponding genes. The "reaction" file in the LIGAND section was first scanned for all reactions catalyzed
by enzymes present in H. sapiens's genome, and totally
1492 reactions were determined. Then, the resulting reactions were matched to the "reaction_mapformula.lst" file,
which includes direction information and the main
metabolites for each reaction.

Some small molecules, such as adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and CO2, are normally used as
carriers for transferring electrons or certain functional
groups and participate in many reactions, while typically
not participating in product formation. Therefore, in
order to reflect biologically relevant transformations of
substrates, we excluded these kinds of small molecules
whose list is as follows [57,58]:
ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, NH3,
CoA, O2, CO2, Glu, Pyrophosphate, H+.
To construct the metabolic network, substrates and products were extracted from each of the enzyme-catalyzed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/311

reactions and all resulting substrate-product pairs were
listed to specify the connections between the substances.
A metabolic network is represented by a directed graph
whose nodes correspond to metabolites and whose arcs
correspond to reactions between these metabolites, in
which irreversible reactions are presented as directed arcs
while reversible ones as bi-directed arcs. For example, the
irreversible reaction,
(S)-2-Methylmalate → Acetate + Pyruvate
corresponds to two directed arcs, i.e., (S)-2-Methylmalate
→ Acetate and (S)-2-Methylmalate → Pyruvate. The
resulting metabolic network of H. sapiens embraces 1378
metabolites and 666 enzymes, in which 948 metabolites
and 614 enzymes are included in the biggest connected
cluster, while the other 52 enzymes and 430 metabolites
scatter in 124 small clusters. Like previous studies of metabolic networks based on topology [25-30], we only analyze the biggest connected cluster.
Modularity and network decomposition
In this study, we applied the simulated annealing algorithm developed by Guimera and Amaral [28] to break up
the metabolic network of H. sapiens into modules (The
software Modul-w was kindly obtained from Guimera
and Amaral). This algorithm identifies topological modules by maximizing the network's modularity metric
through an exhaustive search, thus may generate the best
decomposition of the network.

For a given decomposition of a network, the modularity
metric is defined as the gap between the fraction of arcs
within clusters and the expected fraction of arcs if the arcs
are wired with no structural bias [59]:
r

M = ∑ [eii − (∑ eij )2 ]
i =1

j

where r is the number of clusters, eij is the fraction of arcs
that leads between vertices of cluster i and j. The maximum modularity metric corresponds to the partition that
comprises as many as within-module links and as few as
possible inter-module links.

logical modules
Accuracy of simulated annealing algorithm to identify topoAccuracy of simulated annealing algorithm to identify topological modules. We obtain 30 independent
decompositions of the H. sapiens metabolic network and plot
the fraction of times that each pair of nodes is clustered into
the same module.

Since the simulated annealing algorithm is stochastic, different runs may yield different decompositions of the network because of different initial conditions. The initial
condition is the seed for the random number generator,
which must be a negative integer. To verify the robustness
of the decomposition, we first randomly generated 30 different negative integers, and then applying each of them
as the initial condition to perform 30 times of independent simulated annealing and generate 30 partitions of the
network. Figure 7 shows the fraction of times that each

pair of nodes in the network is clustered into the same
module. It is thus confirmed that the topological modules
are robustly and consistently identified.
Hypergeometric distribution and P-value
If we randomly draw n samples from a finite population,
the probability of getting i samples with the desired feature by chance obeys hypergeometric distribution:

 K  N − K 
 

i
n−i 
f (i) =   
,
N
 
n
where N is the size of the population, K is the number of
items with the desired feature in the population. Then the
probability of getting at least k samples with the desired
feature by chance can be represented by hypergeometric
cumulative distribution defined as P-value:

 K  N − K 


i
n−i 
P = 1 − ∑ f (i) =1 − ∑   
N
i =0
i =0
 
n
k −1

k −1 

Given significance level α, which is usually set as 0.05, a
P-value smaller than α demonstrates low probability that
the items with the desired feature are chosen by chance.
Hence P-value can be used to measure whether the n samples drawn from the population is more enriched with
items of the desired feature than would be expected by
chance [51].
Phylogenetic profiles
For every enzyme, its phylogenetic profile is defined as a
binary vector that encodes its absence (0) or presence (1)
in the reference genomes. In this study, we applied the
method in [16,17] to construct the phylogenetic profiles
of enzymes. We first chose 115 organisms (16 eukaryote,
83 bacteria and 16 archaea) as reference genomes. To
reduce the effect of bias in the organism distribution, we
then merged these 115 genomes into 54 taxa according to
the NCBI taxonomy [16,17,52] [see Table A1 in Additional file 1]. At last, the ENZYME section of the KEGG
LIGAND database [43] was utilized to determine whether
the corresponding enzyme is coded in the reference
genomes or not. The resulting phylogenetic profile of each
enzyme is a 54-dimention binary vector.

We applied the Jaccard coefficient to measure the similarity between the phylogenetic profiles of any pair of
enzymes. Jaccard coefficient is defined as follows [60],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/311

JCij =

nij
ni + n j − nij

,

where nij is the number of taxa that encode both enzyme i
and j; ni, nj are the number of taxa that encode enzyme i
and j, respectively.
Evolutionary age
Also based on the ENZYME section of the KEGG LIGAND
database, we classified the enzymes in the metabolic networks into the following seven evolutionary ages according to their inferred first appearance during evolution,

1) Prokaryota: E. coli group [see Table A1 of Additional file
1]
2) Protists: Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei,
Entamoeba histolytica
3) Fungi: Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Schizosaccharomyces
pombe
4) Nematodes: Caenorhabditis elegans
5) Arthropods: Drosophila melanogaster
6) Mammalian: Mus musculus; Rattus norvegicus; Canis
familiaris
7) Human: H. sapiens
An enzyme was assigned to evolutionary age of "Prokaryota" if an ortholog was detected in any organism of the
15th taxonomy in Table A1 of Additional file 1 (the E. coli
group); "Protists" if an ortholog was detected in P. falciparum, or T. brucei, or E. histolytica but not in E. coli group;
"Fungi" if an ortholog was detected in S. cerevisiae or S.
pombe but not in E. coli group, P. falciparum, T. brucei, and
E. histolytica, and so forth.
Evolutionary rate
The evolutionary rate of an enzyme gene is defined as the
normalized ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per
nucleotide site (Ka) to synonymous substitutions per
nucleotide site (Ks) that occurred in this enzyme gene
[53]. We extracted the evolutionary rate of every enzyme
gene in the H. sapiens metabolic network based on the
complete genome of Pan troglodytes from HomoloGene
database [52]. Nei and Gojobori's method [53] was used
to calculate the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in HomoloGene database.
