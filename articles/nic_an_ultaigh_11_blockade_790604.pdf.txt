Abstract
Introduction: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of blocking Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) synovial cells.
Methods: RA synovial tissue biopsies, obtained under direct visualization at arthroscopy, were established as
synovial explant cultures ex vivo or snap frozen for immunohistology. Mononuclear cell cultures were isolated from
peripheral blood and synovial fluid of RA patients. Cultures were incubated with the TLR1/2 ligand, Pam3CSK4
(200 ng, 1 and 10 μg/ml), an anti-TLR2 antibody (OPN301, 1 μg/ml) or an immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1 μg/ml)
matched control. The comparative effect of OPN301 and adalimumab (anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha) on
spontaneous release of proinflammatory cytokines from RA synovial explants was determined using quantitative
cytokine MSD multiplex assays or ELISA. OPN301 penetration into RA synovial tissue explants cultures was assessed
by immunohistology.
Results: Pam3CSK4 significantly upregulated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs), RA synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) and RA synovial explant cultures (P < 0.05). OPN301
significantly decreased Pam3CSK4-induced cytokine production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), IL-1b, IL-6,
interferon (IFN)-g and IL-8 compared to IgG control in RA PBMCs and SFMCs cultures (all P < 0.05). OPN301
penetration of RA synovial tissue cultures was detected in the lining layer and perivascular regions. OPN301
significantly decreased spontaneous cytokine production of TNF-a, IL-1b, IFN-g and IL-8 from RA synovial tissue
explant cultures (all P < 0.05). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of OPN on spontaneous cytokine secretion was
comparable to inhibition by anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody adalimumab.
Conclusions: These findings further support targeting TLR2 as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of RA.

Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory
disease characterized by synovial inflammation and
destruction of cartilage and bone. This process depends
on cytokines and growth factors to stimulate cell survival, proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation [1]. Activated lymphocytes play a critical role in
the initiation and perpetuation of synovial inflammation.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b,

are key mediators of these processes; however, it
remains unclear which mechanisms are involved in the
initiation and regulation of cytokine production and
other tissue-destructive mediators.
There is mounting evidence for the involvement of
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in RA [2,3]. Increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 has been demonstrated in synovial cells and tissue [4-6]. TLR2 expression in RA
synovial tissue has been demonstrated at sites of attachment and invasion into cartilage and bone [4], on CD16
+ monocytes and synovial macrophages [5]. TLR2
mRNA is upregulated in RA synovial fibroblasts (FLS)
by TNFa and IL-1b [4]. Overexpression of dominant

negative forms of the essential TLR2/4 adapter molecules MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP inhibits cytokine production and matrix metalloproteinases in RA synovial cells
[6]. Furthermore, several animal models use bacterial
wall components and peptidoglycans (PG), known to
activate TLR2, to induce experimental arthritis [7,8].
Targeted biologic therapies, including TNF blocking
drugs, have had an important effect on the therapeutic
outcome of inflammatory arthritis [9]; however, a significant proportion of patients do not respond or have a
sub-optimal response highlighting the need for new
therapeutic targets. TLR expression on RA cells and
their ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggest TLRs may play an integral role in the pathogenesis
of RA, as such TLRs represent a rational target for therapeutic intervention [3].
In the present study, using whole tissue synovial
explant cultures ex vivo (which closely reflect the in vivo
environment) and RA mononuclear cells, we demonstrate that Pam3CSK4, a TLR1/2 agonist, significantly
increases release of key cytokines, an effect that is
blocked by an anti-TLR2 antibody, OPN301. In RA
synovial explants, we demonstrate that OPN301 penetrates the synovial tissue, localizing to the lining layer
and perivascular region and significantly suppresses
spontaneous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This
effect was comparable to that of Adalimumab, a well
established TNF blocking therapy. Inhibition of spontaneous pro-inflammatory cytokine production by
OPN301 from RA synovial explants in the absence of a
specific TLR2 agonist suggests expression of endogenous
TLR ligands in RA synovial tissue. These data demonstrate that TLR2 promotes pro-inflammatory and
destructive processes in RA and further support the
rationale of using a TLR2 therapeutic blockade.

Materials and methods
Patients and RA synovial tissue

Patients with RA, classified according to the American
College of Rheumatology criteria [10], were recruited
from rheumatology outpatient clinics at St. Vincent’s
University Hospital (SVUH). All patients had an actively
inflamed knee joint, despite current or previous therapy.
All research was carried out in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, following approval by the
SVUH ethics committee. All patients gave written
informed consent. RA synovial tissue (ST) was obtained
at the time of arthroscopy under direct visualization.
Blood samples and synovial fluid were collected from
patients at arthroscopy or clinics.
Whole RA synovial tissue explant culture

To investigate the effect of OPN301 (a novel mouse IgG1
monoclonal anti-TLR2 antibody, Opsona Therapeutics,

Page 2 of 9

(Dublin, Ireland)), on cytokine production in the arthritic
joint, an ex vivo RA synovial explant model was established. This system maintains the synovial architecture
and cell-cell contact and spontaneously releases proinflammatory mediators [11,12]. OPN301 is an Opsona
Therapeutics internal designation for the anti-mouse/
human TLR2 monoclonal antibody known as T2.5.
OPN301 is a mouse IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits TLR2 signaling [13]. IC50s for cytokines measured
ranged from 10 to 30 ng/ml for OPN301 and 1 to 10 ng/
ml for Adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, USA). OPN301 cross reacts with mouse TLR2 but
has been shown to be ineffective at inhibiting TLR4 or
IL-1 receptor signaling in HEK293 or RAW264.7 cells
[14]. OPN301 is capable of inhibiting responses using
ligands specific for TLR1/2 (Pam3CSK4) and TLR2/6
responses (FSL1/HKLM) in human and murine cell lines
(THP1 CD14 X blue, U937, J774), and also in human,
murine and monkey blood (Opsona, unpublished
observations).
For Pam3CSK4 stimulation experiments, two biopsies
were obtained from each patient (n = 11 for IL-6 and
n = 8 for IL-8) and each biopsy was sectioned into four
separate pieces and cultured in 96-well plates in serumfree RPMI 1640 for 24 hr and then stimulated with
Pam3CSK4 (200 ng, 1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml) for a further
24 hr. For the inhibition experiments, three biopsies
were obtained from each patient (n = 13), and then
each biopsy was sectioned into four separate pieces and
cultured in 96-well plates in full RPMI 1640 medium
(10% Foetal Calf Serum, 20 mM of 1 mmole/litre
HEPES, streptomycin (100 units/ml), penicillin
(100 units/ml) and Fungizone (0.25/μg/ml)) in the presence of OPN301 (1 μg/ml), Adalimumab (1 μg/ml) or
IgG isotype control (Mouse IgG1 isotype control,
Opsona Therapeutics; 1 μg/ml) for 72 hr at 37°C in air
with 5% CO2. Following incubation, supernatants were
harvested and frozen at -80°C until further use, and the
wet weight of each biopsy section was obtained. Cytokine production was corrected for by wet weight of the
biopsy. Biopsies were then snap frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and stored at -80°C
for histological analysis. To assess cell viability in RA
synovial explant cultures following culture, the acetomethoxy derivate of calcein (calcein AM) was used as a
marker of viability. It transports through the cellular
membrane of live cells, where intracellular esterases
remove the acetomethoxy group resulting in a strong
green fluorescence. Following culture, explants were
incubated in PBS/Calcein AM (1:1,000 dilution) in the
dark for 15 minutes. Biopsies were washed in PBS and
examined immediately under a fluorescent microscope.
Synovial cells emitted a strong green fluorescence indicative of live cells.

Immunohistochemistry

Synovial biopsies obtained at arthroscopy and RA ST
obtained after explant cultures were snap frozen in OCT
and stored at -80°C. 7 μm OCT sections were cut with a
cryostat, placed on glass slides coated with 2% 3-aminopropyl-triethoxy-silane (Sigma-Aldrich Ireland, Ltd,
Dublin, Ireland) and dried overnight at room temperature. Tissue sections were allowed to reach room temperature, fixed in acetone for 10 minutes and air-dried.
Non-specific binding and endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked using 10% casein and 0.3% H2 O 2, respectively. A routine three-stage immunoperoxidase labelling
technique incorporating avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase
complex (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was used. For RA
biopsies obtained directly from arthroscopy, the sections
were incubated with OPN301 at room temperature for
one hour. Sections were also incubated with an irrelevant
isotype matched mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a
negative control. For the RA synovial explant sections
that were cultured with OPN301 or matched IgG control
antibody, the primary antibody step was omitted in order
to examine if tissue penetration of OPN301 mAb could
be detected. All sections were incubated with mouse secondary antibody/HRP for 30 minutes, washed in PBS and
colour-developed in a solution containing diaminobenzadine-tetrahydrochloride (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA),
0.5% H2O2 in PBS buffer (pH 7.6). Slides were counterstained with haematoxylin and mounted.
Isolation and culture of peripheral blood (PBMC) and
synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC)

Blood and synovial fluid were obtained from patients
undergoing arthroscopy or at clinics, and drawn into
heparin containing tubes. PBMCs/SFMCs were isolated
by Ficoll-Metrizoate density gradient centrifugation
(Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Marlow Buckinghamshire,
UK). Cells were seeded in 48-well plates, at a cell density of 200,000 to 400,000 cells/ml in full RPMI 1640
medium containing Pam3CSK4 (200 ng/ml, 1 μg/ml or
10 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of OPN301 or IgG
isotype control for 6 hr. To assess viability of cells after
stimulation with Pam3CSK4 and/or OPN301, PBMCs
were stimulated with Pam3CSK4 1 μg and/or OPN301
1 μg for 24 hrs. PBMC cell suspension was diluted 1:20
in Ethidium Bromide Acridine Orange solution (EBAO).
Viable and non-viable cells were counted using a dualchamber hemocytometer and a UV-light microscope.
No difference for cell viability was observed between
control and Pam3CSK or OPN treated cells.
Cytokine quantification

IL-6, IL-8, IFN-g, IL-1b, and TNF-a, levels were quantified by Multiplex Tissue Culture kit (Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), Maryland, USA) or by ELISA (R&D

Page 3 of 9

Systems, Oxfordshire, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured at
450 nm in a microtiter plate spectrophometer (Dynatech MR4000, Alexandria, VA, USA) or using MSD
Sector Imager 2400.
Statistical analysis

SPSS15 system for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois,
USA) was used for statistical analysis. Non-parametric
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for related samples and nonparametric Friedman analysis of variance for comparison
of three or more groups were performed. P < 0.05 was
determined as statistically significant. Results are
expressed as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Results
Patient characteristics

Clinical characteristics of the study patients who underwent arthroscopy are shown in Table 1. All patients had
clinically active disease as estimated by high 28-joint
count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) (4.1 ± 0.9;
mean ± SD) and had a swollen, inflamed knee joint. All
patients except one were biologically naive. Eight
patients were receiving disease modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs) - either Methotrexate or Plaquenil. In
addition, three were receiving oral steroids (prednisilone
≤10 mg) and four patients were receiving NonSteroidal
Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) only. One patient
had previously received Methotrexate/Adalimumab had
stopped treatment due to infection. There was no relationship between response to OPN301 and treatment.
Effect of Pam3CSK4 on cytokine production

To determine the effect of the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4
on induction of cytokine secretion in RA cells types, the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8
were assessed. Figure 1A and 1B demonstrates in RA
SFMC and PBMC, significant induction of IL-6 and IL-8
secretion following Pam3CSK4 (200 ng/ml) stimulation
(P < 0.05). Incubation of PBMC and SFMC with
Pam3CSK4 at 1 and 10 μg/ml also significantly induced
IL-6 and IL-8 production (P < 0.05) (data not shown).

Figure 1 Pam3CSK4 induced IL-6 and IL-8 in mononuclear cells from RA patients. SFMCs (A; n = 6) and PBMCs (B; n = 11) were stimulated
with TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 at 200 ng/ml. Levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture supernatants were determined and compared to unstimulated
cells (Basal) at six hours. Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. * P < 0.05, significantly different from control as determined using Wilcoxon
Signed Rank analysis.

In RA synovial biopsies, TLR2 was localized to the lining
layer and perivascular regions as demonstrated by staining
using OPN301 as a primary antibody (Figure 2A). In
paired RA synovial explant cultures, Pam3CSK4, at 200
ng/ml, 1 and 10 μg/ml significantly induced IL-6 and IL8-cytokine production (Figure 2B). IL-6 production (mean
pg/ml/mg ± SEM) increased from 14,934.9 ± 8,337.15 for
an unstimulated control (Basal) to 23,783.02 ± 11,425.55

± 8,871.838 for unstimulated control (Basal) to 81,931.94
± 32,328.61 for Pam3CSK4 200 ng, P = 0.012; 154,736.9 ±

28,061.14 for Pam3CSK4 10 μg, P = 0.004, respectively.
Effect of OPN301 on cytokine production in PBMC and SFMC

To assess whether OPN301 inhibits Pam3CSK induced
cytokine secretion, RA PBMC and SFMC were stimulated with Pam3CSK4 (200 ng/ml) in the presence or

absence of OPN301 or matched IgG isotype control.
OPN301 significantly inhibited Pam3CSK4 induced IFNg, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and IL-8 in RA SFMCs (all P <
0.05) compared to IgG isotype control (Figure 3). Similar results were obtained for RA PBMCs, where
OPN301 significantly inhibited IFN-g, IL-1b, TNF-a,
IL-8, IL-6 cytokine production (all P < 0.05).
OPN301 penetration and its effect on spontaneous
cytokine production in RA synovial tissue explant cultures

To show that OPN301 penetrates the RA ST in culture,
biopsies were snap frozen following 72 h incubation
with OPN301, sectioned and immunohistology performed omitting the primary antibody. Representative
images of OPN301 detection in RA synovial explants
are shown in Figure 4A. OPN301 was localized to the
lining layer and to the perivascular regions, showing
that OPN301 does penetrate the tissue in culture with
localization consistent with previous studies [4-6].
To determine the inhibitory effect of OPN301 on spontaneous cytokine production by ST explant cultures,

Figure 2 TLR2 expression is localized to the perivascular region and lining layer. (A) Two representative photomicrograph (Pt 1 and Pt 2)
of RA synovial tissue of 10 patients stained for TLR2 expression. Expression is localized to the perivascular region and to the lining layer, with no
staining observed for matched IgG control. The bar on the lower right hand corner of each photomicrograph represents a distance of 100 μm
on the top panel and 50 μm on the bottom panel. (B) RA synovial tissue explant cultures were stimulated with TLR2 angonist Pam3CSK4 at
200 ng, 1 and 10 μg/ml. Levels of IL-6 (n = 11) and IL-8 (n = 8) in the culture supernatants were determined after 24 hrs. Values are expressed
as the mean ± SEM. * P < 0.05 significantly different from control as determined using Wilcoxon Signed Rank analysis.

RA ST explants were established and cultured in the presence of OPN301 (1 μg/ml), Adalimumab (1 μg/ml) or
IgG isotype control (1 μg/ml) for 72 hr (Figure 4B).
OPN301 significantly inhibited spontaneous release of
IL-8 (P = 0.001), TNF-a (P = 0.003), IFN-g (P = 0.013),
and IL-1b (P = 0.039). OPN301 inhibited IL-6 production,
but this did not reach significance (P = 0.056). Adalimumab significantly inhibited IL-6 (P = 0.002), IL-8 (P =
0.000), IL-1b (P = 0.020), TNF-a (P = 0.018), and IFNg
(P = 0.001). The effect of OPN301 and Adalimumab on
spontaneous cytokine production was also analysed using
non-parametric Friedman analysis of variance, which
further confirmed significant inhibition of all cytokines in
response to both antibodies. We categorized the cytokine

responses in the tissue cultures as follows, low response:
<20% inhibition, moderate response: 21 to 49% inhibition,
and good response: >50% inhibition. For OPN301, 38% of
patients had a low response, 32% had a moderate response
and 30% had a good response, while biopsies treated with
Adalimumab showed 37% low response, 31% moderate
response and 32% good response. The rate of response
reflects what is observed for TNFa in clinical practice,
(approximately 30% little or no response, and 70% of
patient responses varying between 20 to 100%). Therefore,
the results of our ex vivo model very much reflect typical
biologic response rates for RA patients in clinical practice,
and thus further validates the model as a good screening
method for pre-clinical ‘proof of concept studies’.

Discussion
TLRs are phylogenetically conserved receptors involved
in the innate immune response to microbial pathogens
through recognition of pathogen associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). Recent studies have shown that TLRs
recognize endogenous ligands, found in RA serum and
synovial fluid [15,16], these ligands can be released from
necrotic cells during tissue damage or cell stress, leading
to TLR mediated immune responses [17-19]. Expression
and activation of TLR 2, 3, 4 and 9 in RA ST has been
demonstrated suggesting TLRs may be involved in the
pathogenesis [4,20].
In this study we demonstrated that the TLR2 agonist
Pam3CSK4 significantly upregulated pro-inflammatory
cytokine production in RA mononuclear cells, an effect
that was significantly blocked by OPN301. This is consistent with previous studies using RA FLS, where PG, a
bacterial derived TLR2 agonist, significantly induced
angiogenic factors, pro-inflammatory chemokines and
cytokines [21-23]. This effect was inhibited by approximately 40% in the presence of an anti-TLR2 mAb [23].
Furthermore, studies using dominant negative forms of
the essential TLR2/4 adapter molecules MyD88 and
MAL/TIRAP also showed a partial inhibitory effect,

which varied considerably depending on the cytokine
analyzed, suggesting intricate signaling pathways are
involved in this complex inflammatory environment [6].
A key role for TLR2 in RA is further supported by evidence from animal models. TLR2 and MyD88 knockout
mice are protected from SWC induced joint inflammation [24]. Intra-articular injection of the TLR2 and
NOD2 ligand PG led to development of destructive
arthritis in mice [8]. Functional studies have shown that
stimulating TLR2 expressing RA fibroblasts with PG,
leads to induction of cytokines and matrix-metalloproteinases [23]. TLR2 has also been implicated in other
inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and
inflammatory bowel disease [25,26].
TLR2 expression was localized to synovial tissue lining
and sub-lining layers of RA patients, which is consistent
with previous studies. In situ hybridization revealed
TLR2 mRNA expression in the synovial lining, small
vessels and in areas of infiltrating lymphocytes [4].
TLR2 and TLR4 expression has also been shown in the
lining, sublining and perivascular regions of RA synovial
tissue, with TLR2 expression higher than that of TLR4
[23]. TLR2 is also expressed at the sites of attachment
and invasion into cartilage and bone [4]. Furthermore,

explant cultures (n = 13) and effect that was comparable to that observed anti-TNFa mAb Adalimumab (Hum, 1 μg/ml). Results are expressed as
mean ± SEM. * P < 0.05 and ** P < 0.001 significantly different from control as determined using Wilcoxon Signed Rank analysis.

in this study we show that OPN301 directly penetrated
RA synovial explant cultures, localizing to the lining
layer, which is comprised of synoviocyte-like fibroblasts
and macrophages and to the perivascular region where
angiogenesis and leukocyte extravasation occurs, critical
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of RA. Consistent with
this localization, TLR2 is functionally active in synovial
fibroblasts and endothelial cells, where its activation
results in induction of VEGF, IL-8, ICAM-1, VCAM-1
and MMPs [15,21,22,27-29]. Moreover, several studies
have demonstrated that TLR2 activation of monocytes
resulted in an increase in adhesive and migratory capacity of cells [29].
In this study we used an ex vivo RA ST explant model
to investigate the role of TLR2 blockade in RA synovial
inflammation. This model more closely reflects the in
vivo joint environment, as it maintains tissue architecture and cell-cell contact of the complex mix of different cell types whose interaction contributes to the
pro-inflammatory environment in the RA joint. Furthermore, RA synovial explants spontaneously release key
pro-inflammatory cytokines and, therefore, this model is
ideal for examining potential therapeutic molecules. We
demonstrated that OPN301 significantly inhibited

spontaneous secretion of TNFa, IL-1b, IFNg and IL-8,
suggesting that TLR2 is important in RA pathogenesis.
The inhibitory properties of OPN301 and Adalimumab
on spontaneous release of proinflammatory cytokines in
our explant model reflect response rates observed in
routine clinical practice.
Activation of TLRs by local endogenous ligands leading to increased proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine
secretion, may result in a vicious cycle of inflammation,
ultimately leading to the pathological destruction of cartilage and bone seen in RA [2]. While bacterial TLR
ligands have been found in RA synovial fluid and tissue,
they have also been found in normal tissue [30]. Endogenous TLR ligands, which are released under inflammatory conditions and in response to tissue damage,
have now been implicated in RA. Evidence for TLR4
ligands have been demonstrated, where RA synovial
fluid stimulated TLR4 expressing CHO cells to regulate
CD25 [31], and RNA released from necrotic synovial
fluid can activate RA synovial fibroblasts in a TLR3
mediated mechansim [15]. While no ligand has been
defined, the existence of a ligand is supported here and
by other studies, which show that conditioned media
from RA synovial explants can activate macrophages in

a MyD88 and Mal dependent manner [6]. Several potential ligands have been suggested, such as Heat Shock
Proteins, Fibronectin fragments, Hyaluronan oligosaccharides, HMGB1 and GP96; all of which have been
identified in the RA joint [19,32-36].

Conclusions
Targeting of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-a by biologic agents, such as Adalimumab, has been the most beneficial treatment strategy to date for patients with
arthritis [9]. However, a significant proportion of
patients fail to respond to these therapies, while others
may be at risk of adverse events such as infections due
to impaired immune function [9]. Our findings support
further evaluation of strategies targeting TLR2 as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of RA.
