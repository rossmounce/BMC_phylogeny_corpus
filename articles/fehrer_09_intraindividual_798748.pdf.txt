Abstract
Background: Hieracium s.str. is a complex species-rich group of perennial herbs composed of few
sexual diploids and numerous apomictic polyploids. The existence of reticulation and the nearcontinuity of morphological characters across taxa seriously affect species determination, making
Hieracium one of the best examples of a 'botanist's nightmare'. Consequently, its species
relationships have not previously been addressed by molecular methods. Concentrating on the
supposed major evolutionary units, we used nuclear ribosomal (ETS) and chloroplast (trnT-trnL)
sequences in order to disentangle the phylogenetic relationships and to infer the origins of the
polyploids.
Results: Despite relatively low interspecific variation, the nuclear data revealed the existence of
two major groups roughly corresponding to species with a Western or Eastern European origin.
Extensive reticulation was mainly inferred from the character additivity of parental ETS variants.
Surprisingly, many diploid species were of hybrid origin whilst several polyploid taxa showed no
evidence of reticulation. Intra-individual ETS sequence polymorphism generally exceeded
interspecific variation and was either independent of, or additional to, additive patterns accounted
for by hybrid origin. Several ETS ribotypes occurred in different hybrid taxa, but never as the only
variant in any species analyzed.
Conclusion: The high level of intra-individual ETS polymorphism prevented straightforward
phylogenetic analysis. Characterization of this variation as additive, shared informative,
homoplasious, or unique made it possible to uncover the phylogenetic signal and to reveal the
hybrid origin of 29 out of 60 accessions. Contrary to expectation, diploid sexuals and polyploid
apomicts did not differ in their molecular patterns. The basic division of the genus into two major
clades had not previously been intimated on morphological grounds. Both major groups are
thought to have survived in different glacial refugia and to have hybridized as a result of secondary
contact. Several lines of evidence suggest the data is best explained by the presence of an extinct
range of variation and a larger diversity of ancestral diploids in former times rather than by
unsampled variation. Extinct diversity and extensive reticulation are thought to have largely
obscured the species relationships. Our study illustrates how multigene sequences can be used to
disentangle the evolutionary history of agamic complexes or similarly difficult datasets.

Background
Agamic complexes, usually consisting of few diploid and
many polyploid taxa - the latter reproducing by apomixis
to various degrees - are characterized by large numbers of
species often exhibiting more or less continuous morphological variation. Consequently species delimitation is a
challenging task, and even in the presence of expert taxonomic knowledge, does not always lead to satisfactory
results. Therefore, the molecular study of species relationships in such groups is seriously hampered, and few
attempts have been made to reconstruct the evolutionary
history of such complexes [1].
Three or four subgenera of hawkweeds (Hieracium L. s.l.)
have traditionally been recognized. In this study, we will
focus on Hieracium subgen. Hieracium (Hieracium s.str.).
For a review of taxonomic treatments, see [2]. Hieracium
s.str. is a highly diverse group (500-8000 species depending on taxonomic concept) known for its notorious taxonomic complexity, which is associated with a variation in
ploidy level, breeding system and supposed history of
extensive hybridization [3,4]. The group consists of perennial herbs distributed mainly in temperate areas of
Europe, Asia, and North America. Main centers of Hieracium diversity are located in the European mountains
(e.g., Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, Balkan Peninsula) and
in westernmost Asia. The species occupy forests, forest
margins, various grasslands, and rocks. Polyploid (triploid and tetraploid, very rarely pentaploid) taxa [5,6] with
asexual reproduction via parthenogenetic development of
the unreduced egg cell (Antennaria-type diplospory) prevail. Polyploids are near-obligate apomicts that produce
seed asexually (corresponding to the maternal genotype),
but can produce pollen via meiosis to different degrees.
Sexual reproduction is rare and restricted to diploid species (2n = 18). Diploids are mainly confined to unglaciated refugia; polyploids are also widespread in areas that
had been covered by ice sheets [7]. Many taxa comprise
populations of different ploidy level.
The most complete taxonomic treatment was published
by Zahn [3]. He used a broad species concept and distinguished two different kinds of species: (i) 'basic' species
(species principales collectivae, 'Hauptarten') having a
unique set of morphological characters; and (ii) 'intermediate' species (species intermediae collectivae, 'Zwischenarten'), which combine the morphological characters of
two or more 'basic' species and are generally thought to be
of hybrid origin. Following this concept, we expected the
diploid 'basic' species to represent major evolutionary
units from which the multitude of polyploids arose. In
addition, we suspected polyploid 'basic' species (i.e., taxa
presumed to be of non-hybrid origin) to comprise further
basal lineages, especially as the number of recent diploids
is rather low (about 20 out of several hundred macrospe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

cies). Thus, in order to cover as much as possible of the
overall genetic variation present in the subgenus, we
focused on all 'basic' species irrespective of their ploidy.
The 45S rDNA cistron continues to be the most popular
nuclear region for species-level phylogenetic studies of
plants [8] despite its acknowledged flaws [9]. The 5'-ETS
region situated upstream of the 18S rRNA gene [10] was
chosen as a nuclear marker because of its higher variability compared to ITS in the Asteraceae [11,12]. ITS showed
hardly any resolution in Hieracium s.str. [13]. While the
majority of publications based on ETS are focused on phylogeny reconstruction, several studies have also used this
region to infer hybrid or allopolyploid origin, often in
combination with ITS [14-21].
In sexually reproducing diploids not introgressed by other
species, one would expect sequences of this multicopy
region to be more or less homogeneous at the intra-individual and intraspecific level [22]. Since concerted evolution [23] tends to be slowed down in asexually
reproducing organisms [24-26], apomictic allopolyploids
should have retained the ETS variants of their respective
diploid progenitors. Additivity patterns revealed by direct
sequencing of nrDNA have been used to identify hybrid or
allopolyploid origin in a wide range of plant groups [2735], in one case even in a triple hybrid [36]. We therefore
adopted a direct sequencing approach complemented by
cloning of selected accessions.
Analysis of the trnT-trnL intergenic spacer of chloroplast
DNA was also performed in order to establish a phylogeny
of maternal lineages and to identify the maternal parent of
hybrid accessions. We have recently confirmed maternal
transmission of cpDNA for Hieracium s.str. [37].
This paper reports the first molecular phylogeny of Hieracium subgen. Hieracium based on a sampling of most of
the assumed major evolutionary units. It demonstrates
the unexpected hybrid origin of many of these including
diploid species, provides evidence of extinct ancestral
diversity and discusses the occurrence of extensive intraindividual polymorphism found in most diploid and
polyploid accessions. In order to decipher the phylogenetic signal in spite of these abundant polymorphisms, we
distinguished between character additivity, shared
informative variation, and noise by detailed character
state analysis.

Methods
Sampling
Zahn's [3] basic framework was used for a meaningful
taxon sampling for phylogenetic analysis, as complete
sampling was impractical due to the high species numbers
and the unclear delimitation of 'intermediate' species. Up

to three samples of each accessible 'basic', i.e., supposedly
non-hybridogenous species of Hieracium s.str. were collected. If ploidy level varied within a species, diploid populations were included whenever available. The
taxonomic concept generally follows Zahn [3] with a few
exceptions: The species concept of section Cerinthoidea
(Iberian and Pyrenean taxa) was adopted from Mateo
[38], and H. plumulosum (H. waldsteinii s.l.) was treated as
a separate species. Two newly described diploid species
from the Balkans (H. kittanae and H. petrovae; [39,40]),
diploid H. pojoritense - considered as an endemic species
of the Eastern Carpathians by Nyárády [41], and H. mixtum - which was first treated as a 'basic' species by De Retz
[42], followed by other authors - were also included. Altogether, we analyzed 60 accessions of 46 species. For the
remaining 'basic' species sensu Zahn (H. fuscocinereum
Norrlin, H. laniferum Cav., and H. schmalhausenianum
Litv. & Zahn), only herbarium material more than 30
years old was available, in which the DNA was too
degraded for amplification. Details of all accessions are
included in the Additional file 1: Origins of individual
accessions.
As outgroups for the ETS analyses, the most closely related
genera Pilosella, Hispidella, Andryala, and 'Hieracium' intybaceum were used [13]. For cpDNA analysis, only Hispidella and a Pilosella species with 'original' chloroplast
haplotype were used as outgroups. This was because some
of the Pilosella species, Andryala, and 'Hieracium' intybaceum have captured chloroplasts derived from Hieracium due to ancient intergeneric hybridizations [13].
Vouchers of all specimens are deposited in the herbarium
of the Institute of Botany in Průhonice (PRA).
Molecular methods
DNA was isolated from fresh or CTAB-conserved leaves as
described in [43]. The ETS region of the nuclear ribosomal
DNA was PCR-amplified using the primers Ast-8 and 18 S
[44]. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
sequenced (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). For each
sample, both strands were directly sequenced using the
PCR primers. Sequences containing more than one indel
or otherwise difficult to read were cloned. Prior to cloning, the PCR products were excised from 1% agarose gels
and purified with the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit
(Zymoresearch, Orange, CA). The gel-purified fragments
were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions,
but downscaled to half reactions. Approximately 24 colonies per sample were transferred into 20 μl ddH20 and
denaturated at 95°C for 10 min. They served as templates
for subsequent PCR amplifications for sequencing. Using
the Ast-8 primer, 3-15 clones per individual were
sequenced (eight on average). For the trnT-trnL intergenic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

spacer of chloroplast DNA, PCR amplification, sequencing and indel coding were done as described previously
[13]. Sequence alignments were done by eye in BioEdit
[45]; they were unambiguous for both markers due to low
overall variation.
Treatment of ETS sequences prior to phylogenetic
analysis
All ETS sequences contained a certain proportion of polymorphic sites. Polymorphisms were distinguished from
sequencing artifacts when they occurred in both reading
directions. As overall interspecific sequence divergence
was low, if only single short (1-2 bp) indels were present,
polymorphic sites were determined from direct sequences
by reading both strands on to the indel position, and after
it by confirming them in both directions via peak subtraction. Where multiple or longer indels obscured sequence
reads, the samples were cloned, and the clones were used
to aid peak subtraction in the electropherograms obtained
by direct sequencing in order to infer polymorphic sites in
regions whose readability was strongly affected by indels.
Polymorphisms were represented by the IUPAC ambiguity codes.

Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of ETS revealed little
structure apart from a monophyly of Hieracium [46]; all
species emerged from a single basal polytomy, and the
few subclades found were poorly supported. However,
visual inspection of the alignment suggested the existence
of two major species groups. Many accessions showed
additive characters (superimposed peaks and a diagnostic
indel) corresponding to positions that differed between
these main groups, suggesting hybrid origin. These accessions were removed from the phylogenetic analyses. The
resulting dataset was inspected for the occurrence of further additive characters that might be indicative of hybridization within each of the two species groups. Several such
accessions were detected and also excluded prior to final
phylogenetic analyses.
Cloned sequences - mostly from hybrids - revealed in several cases two major ETS variants corresponding to
sequences of both major species groups. However, some
were recombinant according to visual inspection, one
showed a novel hybrid sequence, some showed single
nucleotides occurring on the 'wrong' ribotype, and in case
of strongly biased ratios of different ribotypes (or at single
polymorphic positions), not all underrepresented
sequences (or character states) were retrieved (Additional
file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination). Also, the number
of polymerase errors approximated the low interspecific
variation in some cases. Therefore, cloned sequences were
not included in the phylogenetic analyses (but see below).

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:239

In the preliminary parsimony and Bayesian analyses of
the dataset from which all suspected hybrid sequences
had been deleted, the effect of the remaining polymorphic
sites on tree topology and branch support were assessed
by including each accession twice, namely one sequence
with all polymorphisms included, and a second one
reflecting the major sequence type in which ambiguities
were 'resolved' towards the overrepresented character state
in case the latter represented at least about 70% of the
total signal. In the resulting trees, both sequences of the
same accession always appeared together except for H. villosum 1029 and H. lucidum where they differed slightly in
their placement (not shown). As these were minor effects
and because of the higher information content of the
dominant sequence types in both cases, for the final phylogenetic analyses, only major ETS sequences were used
for all accessions. This also reduced computing time as
well as the number of unique indels in the alignment as
they were typically present in lower amounts within an
individual.
In outgroup species, Pilosella samples produced several
equally strong bands in PCR amplification that could not
be eliminated by optimizations. The shortest fragment
was homologous to the 5'-ETS of other species while the
longer fragments contained duplications (variable
number of large subrepeats, not shown) which had also
been found in other Asteraceae [12,47]. Therefore,
Pilosella was represented in the phylogenetic analyses by
three cloned sequences of the short fragment. In Hispidella, intra-individual polymorphisms included one indel
adjacent to two substitutions. One allele was dominating
so that the second one could be inferred from direct
sequencing. Both variants were included in the phylogenetic analyses.
In order to represent the complex features of the ETS dataset as comprehensively as possible, direct sequences of all
accessions were submitted to GenBank in duplicates: (i)
with all polymorphic sites included, and (ii) corrected for
overrepresented character states (e.g., the major sequence
types used for phylogenetic analyses). In addition, all
cloned sequences were submitted; some were corrected
for polymerase errors (substitutions found in only one
clone and neither accounted for by direct sequencing nor
present in any other taxon). Corrected clones are indicated, e.g., as 'clone 1c' in the sequence description line of
the submitted sequences; recombinant sequences are
indicated as such in the notes. [GenBank:EU821363EU821419, EU867566-EU867709, and FJ858089FJ858133 (ETS), and GenBank:EU867710-EU867763
(trnT-trnL)]. Eight additional trnT-trnL sequences (for two
outgroup and six Hieracium accessions) were adopted
from [13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

Phylogenetic analyses
Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML)
(PAUP* V4.0b10, [48]), and Bayesian inference (MrBayes
V3.1.2, [49,50]) were applied for phylogenetic analyses of
the ETS and trnT-trnL datasets.

For MP analysis of the ETS region, single-base gaps were
treated as a 5th character state, longer indels as a single
character, and remaining ambiguous bases as polymorphisms. Heuristic searches were performed with 1,000
random sequence addition replicates, saving no more
than 100 trees of length greater than or equal to 1 per replicate and TBR branch swapping. Bootstrapping was done
with the same settings, but without branch swapping.
Prior to ML analysis, the model of molecular evolution
best fitting to the data was determined with Modeltest version 3.5 [51]. A HKY+G model was found in hierarchical
Likelihood Ratio Tests (hLRTs) which was used for ML
analyses with the estimated parameter settings. Heuristic
searches were done with one random addition sequence
replicate and TBR branch swapping; 1,000 bootstrap replicates were performed without branch swapping. For
Bayesian analyses, the same basic model parameters
determined by Modeltest (two substitution rates and
gamma distribution) were used. Two replicate analyses
with four chains each were performed with the default
parameters and computed for 3 million generations, sampling every 1,000th tree. All statistical parameters indicated that convergence was reached. The first 1,000 trees
per run were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining
4,002 trees were summarized.
For analyses of cpDNA, MP analysis was performed as
described above, treating indels as single events. As
sequence divergence was low, character state changes were
mapped onto the branches by hand, and homoplasies
were identified based on the alignment. For ML analysis,
the F81 model determined in hLRTs was applied. Accordingly, Bayesian analyses were run using one substitution
rate and equal rates as priors, all else as indicated above.
Evaluation of intra-individual polymorphism
Intra-individual polymorphism in multicopy sequences
results from the presence of more than one ribotype
within a particular genome accompanied by incomplete
homogenization of the different variants by concerted
evolution. If meaningful patterns can be distinguished
from stochastic ones, intra-individual polymorphisms
can add considerably to the understanding of evolutionary processes. As potentially meaningful polymorphisms
we considered (i) sites that consisted of different character
states (nucleotides or indels) that were monomorphic in
other sequences of the dataset (character additivity), and
(ii) sites showing the same alternative character states in
more than one accession, but one character state was

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:239

missing in the rest of the dataset (shared polymorphisms).
The latter can either be meaningful (in the case of shared
ancestral polymorphism) or not (if they are homoplasious). We distinguished putative homoplasious polymorphisms according to (i) geography - accessions for which
recent or past overlap of distribution areas is highly
unlikely; (ii) phylogeny - polymorphism-sharing accessions belonging to divergent clades, or hybrids of certainly
different origin; and (iii) singularity - no further evidence
for grouping these particular accessions (or accession
groups) could be found. In most cases, more than one of
these criteria applied. Unique (accession-specific) polymorphic sites represented a further kind of uninformative
variation. A comprehensive list of sites along with the
accessions in which the polymorphisms occurred and
their interpretation according to the criteria described
above is given in Additional file 3: Summary of intra-individual polymorphisms. To facilitate reproducibility of
these inferences, an alignment with the corresponding
positions is also provided (Additional file 4: Alignment of
Hieracium ETS sequences).
Identification of further lineages
Detailed analysis of shared polymorphisms revealed several groups of accessions that were characterized by different sets of consistently shared polymorphisms. In order to
analyze the origin of this variation in more detail, all samples for which meaningful patterns emerged after analysis
of intra-individual polymorphism were also cloned and
sequenced as above. Clones were inspected visually, and
all non-recombinant clones containing further signal (i.e.,
exceeding accession-specific variation, see Additional file
2: Patterns of ETS recombination) were subjected to additional phylogenetic analyses under the same conditions as
described above.

Results
Intra-individual polymorphism in the ETS region
A surprisingly high level of intra-individual polymorphism in ETS sequences was found in many accessions
irrespective of ploidy, ranging from one to 37 per sample
(12 on average). In the whole ingroup (Additional file 4:
Alignment of Hieracium ETS sequences), intra-individual
polymorphisms concerned 196 aligned positions, exceeding the number of variable sites based on substitutions
(120). At 30 of these 196 positions, two different kinds of
polymorphism were found (e.g., Y and K); at five further
positions, even three different ones were observed (e.g., Y,
K and S). Thus, the total number of different intra-individual polymorphisms was 236 out of 573 aligned characters. A complete list of polymorphic positions, their
occurrence in particular accessions, and their classification as unique, shared (homoplasious or informative), or
additive is given in Additional file 3: Summary of intraindividual polymorphisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

At most of the polymorphic sites (unique and shared),
one of the alternative character states was lacking across
the whole dataset while true character additivity was comparatively rare (Figure 1a). A large proportion of the polymorphisms was accession- or species-specific. Most of this
variation was uninformative, but a few unique polymorphisms showed character additivity (Figure 1b) and indicated hybrids of unique origin (see below). Among the
polymorphisms shared between accessions of different
species, some were shared among apparently unrelated
species (according to the phylogeny), or between reasonable groups of accessions and single or multiple outliers.
These polymorphisms were considered as homoplasious
according to the criteria specified in the Methods. 'Reasonable groups of accessions' refers to assemblages that
were supported by more than one shared polymorphism
and usually also by other evidence (e.g., synapomorphic
substitutions, phylogenetic position, geography). In several of these cases, character additivity applied to one of
the 'reasonable' subgroups (Figure 1b) which often comprised many accessions. Thus, meaningful information
could in some cases also be retrieved from homoplasious
positions by a detailed evaluation of the patterns. Shared
polymorphisms for which no obvious evidence for homoplasy was found were considered as potentially informative. A comparably large part of them was additive (Figure
1b). Typically, the same or similar sets of accessions
shared further polymorphisms and were usually also supported by other evidence (e.g., phylogenetic position,
geography). Thus, informative intra-individual polymorphism could be retrieved from an excess of uninformative
or even misleading variation by detailed character state
analyses. Additive and shared informative variation was
crucial for inferring reticulation patterns or added to the
phylogenetic information content of the data (see below).
ETS phylogeny
Interspecific variation of the ETS region in Hieracium was
rather low; maximal sequence divergence based on substitutions was 4.6% p-distance (compared to 1.9% in ITS,
not shown). Seven short indels (1-10 bp) occurred, six of
them represented intra-individual polymorphisms, only
one differed between accessions.

Phylogenetic analyses of the dataset from which all
inferred hybrid accessions had been excluded based on
character additivity resulted in basically the same tree
under different optimality criteria (Figure 2). A basal split
into two well-supported major clades was found, one
composed mostly of species with Western, the other one
of taxa with mainly Eastern European distribution. Widespread or Central European taxa fell into one or other
cluster. Both major clades were characterized by basal polytomies from which a few well-supported subclades
emerged.

(homoplasious) versus meaningful (additive, shared informative) variation is illustrated. a) Discrimination of non-additive (one

All species of the 'Eastern' group that occurred at unresolved positions are from Southeastern Europe, mostly
from the Balkans (H. naegelianum, H. pannosum, H. petrovae, H. sparsum, H. kittanae) (Figure 2). One lineage
emerging from the basal polytomy of the 'Eastern' clade
consisted of two diploid accessions of H. alpinum. While
H. alpinum s.l. is a widespread species, diploid populations occur only in the Eastern and Southern Carpathians
[52] consistent with an eastern origin of that species. The
'H. porrifolium' subclade consisted of the alpine species H.
pilosum, H. villosum, H. bupleuroides, and H. porrifolium.
The first three are Central European polyploid taxa; H. porrifolium is the only diploid species in this subclade. This
taxon is restricted to the Southeastern Alps - a known glacial refuge area. Species of the 'H. porrifolium' group occur
only in rock crevices on limestone and have a very similar
ecology. The best supported group ('H. umbellatum' subc-

lade) consisted of the tall-growing perennials H. virosum,
H. umbellatum, H. eriophorum, and H. canadense. Their distribution extends from Siberia to North America. The kind
of involucrum in these species, an important character
complex for Hieracium taxonomy, resembles that of other
species with exclusively Eastern European distribution.
Hieracium umbellatum is the most widely distributed diploid.
In the 'Western' cluster, subclades emerging from the
basal polytomy were a branch composed of three
Pyrenean taxa ('Pyrenean' subclade) and a lineage consisting of two accessions of H. transylvanicum. All species with
exclusively or mainly Pyrenean or Western Alpine distribution belonged to the 'Western' clade, some of them may
be remnants of previously much larger populations. In
addition, diploid populations of H. prenanthoides are also

parsimonious trees is shown (417 steps, ri = 0.947, ci = 0.940; 153 variable characters of which 89 were parsimony informative) with bootstrap support indicated above the branches. The strict consensus tree topology corresponds to branches with
support values in the MP analysis. Bootstrap values for ML and posterior probabilities for Bayesian analyses are given below the
branches. Diploid Hieracium species are indicated in boldface. Four accessions (H. prenanthoides 1252 and 1161, H. lachenalii, H.
lucidum) are included in these analyses in spite of their inferred hybrid origin, because ETS sequences of the first three were
'Western' apart from 2-3 polymorphic sites, and the dominant sequence of H. lucidum was also 'Western'.

restricted to the Southwestern Alps, indicating western
origin. One species, H. lucidum, is endemic to Northwestern Sicily and is only known from a single relict population. Widespread or Central European species whose
accessions fell into the 'Western' clade were H. schmidtii,
H. murorum, and H. bifidum. The accession of the widespread species H. lachenalii used, was apparently introgressed by a species from the ('Eastern') 'H. umbellatum'
subclade as indicated by its chloroplast DNA (see below).
The only species not fitting into the 'Western' clade
according to its distribution was H. transylvanicum which
occurs in the Carpathians, the Eastern Alps and the Northern Balkans. Its large genome size (about 10% higher than
that of 'Western' species) may also suggest an eastern origin (for details, see [46]). We therefore cannot exclude
that this is a similar case to H. lachenalii, however, the
chloroplast haplotype of H. transylvanicum was unique
and did not allow an assignment to any ('Eastern'?) taxon.
Diploid accessions - all were sexual and self-incompatible
- were spread all over the tree and occupied basal as well
as derived positions within the major clades (Figure 2).
The same was true for polyploid (triploid or tetraploid)
accessions, which were experimentally confirmed as
apomictic. Accessions included in the 'Western' cluster
had significantly lower DNA content (1Cx values corrected for ploidy) than those of the 'Eastern' clade (3.66 ±
0.21 pg versus 4.03 ± 0.19 pg, see Additional file 5: Species/accessions, their origin, cytotype, ETS and cpDNA
features). Details of reproduction, ploidy, and genome
size are given in a parallel paper [46]. Thus, the major
clades revealed by phylogenetic analysis of the ETS region
coincide with geographic patterns and with significant
genome size differences (~10% on average).
Chloroplast haplotypes
Variation of the trnT-trnL intergenic spacer of chloroplast
DNA was expectedly lower (max. 2.12% p-distance) than
that of the nuclear ETS. Figure 3 summarizes the results of
the phylogenetic analyses for this marker. The tree also
allows to determine the number of substitutions and
indels that distinguish between particular sequences.
Three homoplasious mutations occurred. Two of these
were substitutions in rather basal positions (G → T, G →
A) that accounted for major rearrangements in equally
parsimonious trees. These branches were not supported in
any of the analyses. In contrast, a 7 bp-deletion was
always derived from haplotypes of either H. lucidum or H.
umbellatum (or sequences identical to these), with a minimum of three substitutional steps (as in the tree shown),
or with up to five steps separating H. lachenalii/H. laevigatum from H. tomentosum/H. prenanthoides 1161. Both lineages found significant support in the Bayesian analysis.
As this mutation involved a tandem repeat, we assume
parallel deletion events, especially as part of the same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

motif was independently lost in H. mixtum. For the assignment of haplotype groups, homoplasious substitutions
were ignored.
Bootstrap support was generally low - if haplotypes differ
only by a single mutation, it cannot be higher on principle
[53]. We therefore concentrated only on particular haplotypes (often identical sequences) and on conservative
inferences we considered as unequivocal. No species relationships were inferred from this marker. Despite the low
bootstrap support, all but the three above-mentioned
mutations were free of homoplasy (which is reflected by
very high retention and consistency indices in the parsimony analysis, see Figure 3) and can therefore be considered as diagnostic. Posterior probabilities in Bayesian
analysis were usually significant (≥ 0.95).
The inferred haplotype groups (Figure 3) generally
matched the particular clades or species groups found in
the ETS analyses (Figure 2). Taxa of the 'Pyrenean' lineage
were subdivided into two haplotype groups separated by
a single substitution; H. naegelianum had a unique haplotype and was excluded from the 'Balkan' group. Shared
chloroplast haplotypes (usually identical sequences)
allowed inference of the maternal origin of most hybrid
accessions and always matched the subclades of one parent previously inferred from the ETS dataset (see also
below). In addition, a few rather derived unique chloroplast haplotypes occurred, especially in hybrid accessions
whose exact parentages could not be inferred from the
ETS data. Only in two cases did cpDNA clearly contradict
the phylogenetic position of the species revealed by ETS.
One was H. lachenalii, which showed a 'Western' ETS, but
its cpDNA corresponded to species of the 'H. umbellatum'
clade, a derived 'Eastern' lineage. The taxon also shows
some morphological features of species belonging to the
'H. umbellatum' group. However, no trace of such an introgression was found in the ETS. The genome size of H.
lachenalii was about 5% higher than the usual values of
other 'Western' clade species (Additional file 5: Species/
accessions, their origin, cytotype, ETS and cpDNA features). Therefore, chloroplast capture indicative of cryptic
hybridization between a diploid maternal parent of the
'H. umbellatum' clade and a 'Western' pollen donor with
almost complete homogenization of ETS towards the
'Western' parent (see also Table 1) seems to be the most
likely explanation for the discrepancy. The other case was
H. sparsum. The cpDNA haplotypes of both analyzed
accessions were almost identical and unique, they differed
by many mutations from all other Balkan species. Furthermore, they were apparently derived from an 'H. alpinum'
haplotype. This result was less easy to interpret. It is possible that either a chloroplast capture event occurred very
early in the history of the species or that H. sparsum is
derived from an unknown maternal species with 'H. alpi-

num' cpDNA (for more details, see also Additional file 1:
Origins of individual accessions).
A compilation of accessions, their geographic origin,
ploidy/DNA content, ETS features, and cpDNA variant (as
depicted in Figures 2 and 3) is given in Additional file 5:
Species/accessions, their origin, cytotype, ETS and cpDNA
features.
Reticulation within 'Eastern' and 'Western' clades
Two accessions showing within-'Eastern' clade hybrid origin were identified by additivity patterns. One was the
diploid H. pojoritense, which was comprised of an 'H.
umbellatum' group sequence (resulting in seven additive
characters at positions 232, 326, 349, 425, 426, 459, and
479) and the 'H. alpinum' ribotype (responsible for
another four additive sites at positions 120, 123, 180, and
340; Additional file 4: Alignment of Hieracium ETS
sequences); the latter ETS variant was strongly predominating in the hybrid. Its chloroplast DNA also corresponded to H. alpinum (Figure 3). The second was an
accession of triploid H. bupleuroides (1033) that turned
out to be 'pure' H. bupleuroides introgressed by the 'H.
umbellatum' group: Character additivity for the seven diagnostic sites of the latter plus two sites reflecting the
synapomorphic substitutions of the 'H. porrifolium' clade
(positions 254 and 367) indicated members of these two
subclades as parents. In addition, at two of the 'H. umbellatum' clade diagnostic sites, a 'pure' accession of H. bupleuroides (1212) showed unique polymorphisms whose
alternative character states differed from those of the 'H.
umbellatum' group. The particular positions (425, 426) in

H. bupleuroides 1033 showed the corresponding triple
peaks. This plant resembled H. umbellatum in some morphological characters, and its chloroplast DNA also corresponded to the 'H. umbellatum' haplotype. Another taxon
with putative hybrid origin within the 'Eastern' group was
H. sparsum (both analyzed accessions). In this case, the
only evidence for potential reticulation is based on the
discrepancy between nuclear and chloroplast DNA (see
above).
Four within-'Western' clade accessions of putative hybrid
origin were identified; all had similar origins. Species of
the 'Pyrenean' subclade differed by 2-3 synapomorphic
substitutions (at positions 171, 259, and 485) from the
majority of 'Western' clade species that occurred at unresolved positions. Four Pyrenean species showed the corresponding character additivity while lacking patterns that
would link them to any other taxa: H. cerinthoides, H. cordifolium, H. candidum, and H. gymnocerinthe. Their cpDNA
haplotypes were either identical to those of taxa of the
'Pyrenean' subclade or were slightly derived from these
(Figure 3).
Hybrids between major clades: a multitude of origins
Most hybrid accessions proved to have originated from
different combinations of 'Eastern' and 'Western' clade
species. The major clades differed by 14 substitutions and
one diagnostic 1 bp-indel. These sites were additive in the
interclade hybrids (Table 1). In most cases, either equal or
biased amounts of the respective character states of one or
the other major group were found throughout the entire
sequence. Thus, relative peak height and/or relative

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:239

number of clones usually corresponded to parental ETS
variants present in either equal or different amount in the
hybrid accessions.
Apart from the general contribution of 'Eastern' and
'Western' lineages, one or both of the respective parental
taxa of the interclade hybrid accessions could often be
narrowed down to particular subclades, sometimes even
to the genotype of a particular parental accession: In addition to the 15 polymorphisms representing the differences
between the major clades, contribution from the 'H.
umbellatum' subclade to interclade hybrids could be
inferred from seven additional diagnostic characters (see
above). This was the case for H. racemosum, H. sabaudum,
H. laevigatum, H. bracteolatum, and H. caesium. All of these
except H. caesium ('Western' cpDNA haplotype) also had
a chloroplast haplotype corresponding to that of the 'H.
umbellatum' clade. In H. heterogynum, only two of the
seven additive characters were present in ETS. The cpDNA
haplotype of that accession also corresponded to the 'H.
umbellatum' haplotype. Almost complete 'Western' ETS,
but 'H. umbellatum' cpDNA was found in H. lachenalii (see
also above). Another hybrid taxon, H. glaucum, was composed of an unidentified 'Western' clade parent and a
member of the ('Eastern') 'H. porrifolium' group which
also donated the cpDNA. The same pattern was found in
one accession of each H. pilosum and H. villosum (1226/2
and 1305), whose 'pure' accessions (1226/1 and 1029)
belonged to the 'H. porrifolium' clade. An additive polymorphism (position 21) occurring in the hybrid accession
H. pilosum 1226/2 reflected a unique substitution of H.
pilosum 1226/1 which was collected from the same site.
The genome constitution of the analyzed accessions of H.
amplexicaule and H. gouani was a combination of an unidentified 'Eastern' clade taxon with a member of the
'Pyrenean' subclade. The cpDNA of H. gouani corresponded to one of the Pyrenean haplotypes, the H.
amplexicaule sequence was probably derived from that variant (Figure 3). For four accessions of three hybridogenous taxa with contribution of both clades (H.
gymnocephalum, H. olympicum, and H. plumulosum), no
particular species subgroup could be identified for either
parent based on character additivity. They also had
unique chloroplast haplotypes.
Two particularly interesting cases with respect to ETS patterns were the interclade hybrids H. prenanthoides and H.
mixtum. For H. prenanthoides, three accessions were analyzed. One of the triploids (1187) was a hybrid between
the major clades with the 'Western' ribotype strongly predominating (Table 1) and four out of seven additional
polymorphisms reflecting the 'H. umbellatum' clade (see
also cloned sequences for this accession, Additional file 2:
Patterns of ETS recombination). The other two accessions
seemed at first to have an ordinary 'Western' sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

However, while the diploid 1252 and the triploid 1161
did not show additivity at 12 out of 15 positions distinguishing between the clades, the last three positions at the
3'-end of the ETS were strongly additive (equal representation of both character states). In the triploid 'obvious'
hybrid 1187, these same three sites showed equal
amounts of superimposed peaks at these positions compared to the strongly biased proportion of 'Eastern' and
'Western' ribotypes in the rest of the sequence (Table 1).
Thus, it seems that the diploid represents an interclade
hybrid that had lost most of the 'Eastern' ribotype, probably by intragenomic recombination. The same signature
of strong character additivity at the 3'-end plus several H.
prenanthoides-specific polymorphic sites occurred in both
triploid accessions indicating that the diploid H. prenanthoides gave rise to both triploids. Accession 1187 appears
to have originated by subsequent hybridization with the
'H. umbellatum' lineage. Another interclade hybrid, H.
mixtum, was unique in showing a mixture of strongly predominating 'Eastern' or 'Western' character states (see also
Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination).
Strongly overrepresented character states alternated seven
times between the diagnostic 'Eastern' and 'Western' character states (Table 1) which indicates a novel hybrid
sequence most probably generated by gene conversion.
Inferences from shared informative polymorphisms
Apart from intra-individual polymorphism reflecting ETS
character state additivity and thus shared by several accessions because of similar hybrid origin, some shared
informative variation (Figure 1b) also existed at positions
where one of the alternative character states was missing
in the dataset. In this section, we will focus on examples
where several such polymorphisms (classified as shared
informative) were shared by different taxa in order to
retrieve meaningful information exceeding the results
inferred from character additivity and phylogenetic analyses.

Species of the 'H. porrifolium' clade were, in addition to
synapomorphic substitutions, also linked by shared polymorphisms. Some of the latter indicate a closer relationship between H. porrifolium and H. bupleuroides (positions
194 and 375) as well as between H. villosum and H. pilosum (positions 351 and 369) which corresponds to the
morphology and sectional classification of these species.
Shared polymorphic sites between a particular accession
of H. umbellatum (um.AM.1) and H. eriophorum (positions
393 and 412) could indicate that the latter species
(endemic to Southwestern France) is a young derivative
from a similar genotype or from a common ancestral one
with H. umbellatum. This would also explain the eastern
origin inferred from phylogenetic analysis despite the
Western European distribution of H. eriophorum. The

Page 11 of 23

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

same two polymorphisms were seen in H. pojoritense
whose ETS sequence was additive for the 'H. umbellatum'
clade and the H. alpinum lineage. They narrowed down
the paternal parent of H. pojoritense to either H. eriophorum
(which can be excluded on its geographic distribution and
endemic status) or to a genotype similar to H. umbellatum
um.AM.1.

Species from the Balkans did not cluster together in phylogenetic analyses, because they mostly shared intra-individual polymorphisms rather than substitutions. These
patterns were scattered across the species (Figure 4) and
produced nearly all possible combinations of Balkan taxa
in equally parsimonious trees (not shown). Those with
only one particular nucleotide at a given polymorphic
position usually showed the consensus (plesiomorphic)
character state. Only four apomorphic substitutions
occurred in these species; all were reflected by additive
polymorphisms in other Balkan species. Most polymorphisms (21), however, were non-additive. Shared (probably ancestral) polymorphisms and geographic
distribution indicate a close relationship among these
species, and for the interclade hybrid H. olympicum, they
imply a Balkan species as the most likely 'Eastern' parent,
the H. sparsum pattern being the best match (Figure 4,
Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination).

Apart from synapomorphic substitutions, the 'Pyrenean'
subclade also differed from most 'Western' species by 2-3
shared polymorphisms (positions 171, 317, and 376).
The same also occurred in four Pyrenean taxa that occupied an intermediate position between basal 'Western'
species and the 'Pyrenean' subclade and could represent
ancestral variation. According to character additivity, they
may have hybrid origin (see above). However, an alternative explanation could be that character states identifying
the 'Pyrenean' lineage originated as polymorphisms
retained in the four putative hybrids. The taxa with more
homogeneous ETS could then be younger derivatives in
which the alternative nucleotides became fixed by concerted evolution. In any case, shared polymorphisms
along with geographic vicinity, rather restricted distribution ranges and 'Pyrenean' chloroplast haplotypes indicate a particularly close relationship of these seven taxa.

Species

Non-additive, hybrid-specific variation
The ETS of the relict diploid H. lucidum showed a major
ribotype corresponding to the majority of 'Western' species, but also contained a pattern of three small additional
peaks and a frameshift caused by a 2 bp-indel (at positions 169, 180, 196-197, 358). The same set of intra-individual polymorphisms occurred in H. prenanthoides 1161

Shared polymorphisms in species from the Balkans
Shared polymorphisms in species from the Balkans. * Two accessions of this species are identical for these characters
(except for H. gymnocephalum 1215 with C instead of Y at position 344); 1 Interclade hybrids; 2 The 'unknown Western 2' polymorphisms (light violet) were not found in direct sequencing, but are represented by a single cloned sequence and are probably present in very low amounts in this genome. Dark orange: apomorphic substitutions of Balkan species; light orange: shared
substitutions of Balkan species and hybrids; green: polymorphisms shared only by Balkan interclade hybrids, but not reflected

C occurs on the 'unknown Western 2' ribotype in H. plumulosum and H. gymnocephalum, but on the 'Eastern' ribotype in H.
olympicum and must therefore be a parallelism. The scattered and inconclusive distribution of polymorphisms and substitutions
in 'pure' Balkan species are reflected by the intra-individual patterns in cloned sequences of H. kittanae, their most polymorphic
representative. For more details, see Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination.

(a cryptic interclade hybrid, see above), the non-consensus character states also being present in low amounts.
Four interclade hybrids (H. racemosum, H. sabaudum, H.
bracteolatum, and H. olympicum) showed these alternative
character states in higher amounts so that they had a
higher probability of being recovered by cloning. The
non-consensus character states turned out to be situated
on a particular physical sequence (3 out of 6 clones in H.
racemosum, 1 out of 3 in H. sabaudum, 2 out of 5 in H.
bracteolatum, and 1 out of 8 clones in H. olympicum plus 2
recombinant ones). We refer to this pattern as the
'unknown Western 1' ribotype. Given the diversity of origins of these six taxa as inferred from molecular markers
and the large geographic distances between the sampling
sites, it is unlikely that shared ancestral variation was
responsible for the observed pattern in this case. More
likely, the 'unknown Western 1' ribotype they have in
common reflects one of the parents of all these hybrids
(unsampled or extinct) while their second parent can
vary. In H. prenanthoides 1161 (see above), this involved a
subsequent hybridization with a third parent (i.e. with the
'unknown Western 1').
The maternal parent of the interclade hybrids H. pilosum
1226/2 and H. villosum 1305 belonged to the ('Eastern')
'H. porrifolium' clade like the 'pure' accessions of the same
taxa. Their exact paternal ('Western') parent could not be
identified. Both hybrid accessions shared four polymorphisms (at positions 123, 254, 332, and 357) whose nonconsensus character states were situated on 'Western' ETS
variants (designated as 'unknown Western 2', see also
Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination). These
polymorphisms/ribotypes were also shared with H. gymnocephalum (both accessions) and H. plumulosum (Figure
4) which were interclade hybrids from the Balkans with
unknown 'Eastern' and 'Western' parents. One cloned
sequence of H. heterogynum, an interclade hybrid with 'H.
umbellatum' maternal origin, showed this pattern as well.
Exceptionally, these polymorphisms were not apparent in
direct sequencing suggesting that this ribotype must be
very rare (< 5%) in the genome of this accession and that
it was probably retrieved by chance.
The latter three taxa shared another four polymorphisms
(positions 162, 260, 311, 458) that were situated on 'Eastern' strands; none of these were shared with any 'pure' Balkan species (Figure 4). We refer to this pattern as the
'unknown Eastern' ribotype (see Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination). It was confined to interclade
hybrids with Balkanian distribution. Each of the
'unknown Eastern' ribotypes also contained one or two
'Balkan' polymorphisms suggesting that these variants
probably arose from a Balkan species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

All three 'unknown' ribotypes occurred only in hybrids,
but never as the only ETS variant in any other species. This
is consistent with previously unidentifiable 'Western' or
'Eastern' parental subclades in all these taxa. This kind of
shared variation cannot easily be considered as homoplasious, because each concerned a unique set of four intraindividual polymorphisms that were shared by particular
groups of accessions and did not contradict other patterns. We therefore included all non-recombinant
sequences of these variants into further phylogenetic analyses (Additional file 6: ETS phylogeny with ribotypes
present only in hybrids). These ribotypes formed three
subclades emerging from the basal 'Western' or 'Eastern'
polytomies and showed similar divergences to the previously identified subclades composed of 'pure' species. The
combination of direct sequencing and cloned sequences
further revealed that H. plumulosum (diploid) comprised a
total of four identifyable ribotypes: Besides the 'unknown
Western 2' and the 'unknown Eastern' variant, an almost
pure 'Western' sequence was found, and an ordinary 'Eastern' ribotype could also be inferred (Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination). Likewise, H. heterogynum
(triploid) comprised three identifyable ribotypes, but in
addition had a cpDNA haplotype corresponding to a
fourth lineage, the 'H. umbellatum' group (plus two of its
diagnostic substitutions in the ETS). A compilation of all
reticulation events inferred from ETS patterns (including
the three 'unknown' lineages) and chloroplast haplotypes
is included in Additional file 5: Species/accessions, their
origin, cytotype, ETS and cpDNA features.
Reticulation in Hieracium s.str
To sum up, hybrid origin was unexpectedly inferred for a
total of 29 out of 60 Hieracium accessions. Most of them
(20) were interclade hybrids of which 17 showed complete character additivity for the two major clades; two
others showed partial hybrid signatures in ETS, and one
combined an almost exclusively 'Western' ETS with an
'Eastern' chloroplast haplotype. Four accessions showed
evidence of multiple hybridization/introgression events.
Within the 'Eastern' clade, two hybrid accessions were
identified by ETS character additivity, and a further two
were inferred from putative chloroplast capture. Within
the 'Western' clade, four putative hybrids were identified
by character additivity, and another species comprised an
undifferentiated 'Western' and an 'unknown Western 1'
ETS ribotype. Diploid hybrids occurred at all levels: four
were interclade hybrids, two occurred within the 'Western'
clade, and three within the 'Eastern' clade. One diploid
comprised four different ETS ribotypes which suggests the
presence of at least two nrDNA loci per haploid genome.

Altogether, at least 17 different combinations of parental
lineages were found in the accessions with hybrid origin.
They included three ribotypes that occurred only in

hybrids. A graphical summary of the inferred intra- and
interclade reticulation patterns is provided in Figure 5. A
more detailed assessment and discussion of the origin of
each species/accession, including some ecogeographic,
morphological, and floristic information are given in
Additional file 1: Origins of individual accessions.

Discussion
NrDNA patterns revealed by direct sequencing and cloning
In our experience ([54], Krak et al., unpubl. data) and that
of other labs [32,55], the relative ratios of parental
sequence types in PCR amplicons are usually reproducible. Also, in the present study, relative proportions of
cloned sequences - generated from separately amplified
PCR products - roughly corresponded to relative amounts
of superimposed peaks observed in direct sequencing.
Furthermore, relative amounts of parental ETS alleles in
interclade hybrids could be biased towards the 'Eastern' or
the 'Western' variants (Additional file 5: Species/accessions, their origin, cytotype, ETS and cpDNA features) and
corresponded to total genome size of the respective accessions [46]. This suggests that backcrossing or unequal
genome composition (e.g., diploid and haploid gametes
contributing to a triploid) generally had a stronger influence on different ETS ratios in hybrids than concerted evolution. Reproducibility of relative amounts of amplified
parental variants, biased ratios occurring in either direction, and matching genome sizes argue against the confounding effects of PCR selection or drift [56] in our data.

The reliability of direct sequencing is also highlighted by
a comparison of the strength of particular signals at polymorphic positions in direct sequencing with recombination patterns in cloned sequences. Direct sequencing was
usually superior in cases of heavily biased representation
of different ribotypes (for examples, see Additional file 2:
Patterns of ETS recombination), because it can sample
variation across all nrDNA loci present in the genome.
Rare alleles - contributing less than about 5% of the total
signal in electropherograms in our case - are equally difficult to identify by cloning [22,32], especially if there is no
prior information that such variation exists. While we cannot exclude that cloning of additional accessions might
have revealed still further ribotypes, the example of H. kittanae - a 'pure' diploid species with the highest number of
polymorphisms (15) - which reflected the inconclusive
patterns of Balkan species (Figure 4) by an equally inconclusive pattern at the intra-individual level (Additional
file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination) raises doubts that
further extensive cloning would have retrieved much new
information. Besides, in cloned sequences, polymerase
errors, intragenomic and/or PCR recombination, single
substitutions on the 'wrong' strand or hybrid-specific
sequences, the latter probably resulting from gene conversion, have to be disentangled from 'original' or major

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

parental ribotypes (see Methods and Additional file 2:
Patterns of ETS recombination). This becomes an impossible task if these variants do not differ by a sufficiently
high number of diagnostic characters. On the other hand,
cloning was necessary to resolve or confirm sequence
reads affected by multiple indels and to attribute the
derived character states of shared informative polymorphisms to particular physical sequences (e.g., for the
'unknown' ribotypes).
Intra-individual polymorphism in the ETS
The earlier view that nrDNA repeats are generally homogeneous within a species [22] has led to the widespread
assumption that intra-individual polymorphism of
nrDNA is the exception rather than the rule [57]. More
recently however, researchers have become increasingly
aware of the problems associated with the complex and
often unpredictable behavior of this multicopy marker
[9]. By 2003, Bailey et al. [58] can already cite 22 reports
of intra-individual polymorphism. Meanwhile, this is
thought to be a common phenomenon in plants [59], and
a certain degree of intra-individual polymorphism can
usually be found whenever it is looked for, though it is
still widely ignored [60].

The most frequently observed reasons for prominent intraindividual polymorphism of nrDNA are hybrid/allopolyploid origin [27,28,30,32,33,61,62] or the occurrence of
pseudogenes [63-67]. We consider the latter possibility as
unlikely for Hieracium because overall sequence variation
was very low, the GC content of all accessions fell within
a very narrow range (50.4-51.9%), and long indels were
missing. Other criteria for the recognition of pseudogenes
are not easily applicable, because ETS - unlike the ITS
region - does not comprise conserved genes, and comparative data on secondary structure are also not available.
Reticulation as one source of the extensive intra-individual polymorphism in Hieracium is supported by the fact
that 17 different combinations of ribotypes accounted for
a considerable number of the sequence polymorphisms
observed in individual accessions; most of them involving
'Eastern' and 'Western' variants. All accessions with more
or less homogeneous ETS fell into one or the other clade
(Figure 5). However, one could also argue that multiple
paralogous ribotypes within individual genomes might
reflect ancestral polymorphism and lineage sorting [68]
rather than reticulation. This would require that the ancestral population of the whole subgenus already comprised
all ribotypes as divergent ETS alleles or paralogs. Accessions with composite genomes could then be understood
as heterozygous individuals derived from various combinations of original ETS ribotypes already present in the
ancestral population. The 'pure' species would then be
homozygous for one of the divergent ETS ribotypes, have
suffered locus loss, or their ribotypes became homoge-

Reticulation in previous page)
Reticulation in Hieracium. A graphical summary of reticulation based on ETS features and (in two cases) on chloroplast capture is shown on a simplified ETS tree (unsupported branches collapsed) that includes also the ribotype lineages occurring only
in hybrids (Wx, Wy, Ex). W - 'Western', Wx - 'unknown Western 1', Wy - 'unknown Western 2', WP - 'Pyrenean', E - 'Eastern', EB - Balkan species, EU - 'H. umbellatum' clade, Ex - 'unknown Eastern', EA - 'H. alpinum' lineage, Epo - 'H. porrifolium' clade.
Detailed results of this analysis are given in Additional file 6: ETS phylogeny with ribotypes present only in hybrids. Small
arrows/thin lines represent hybridizations within each clade, larger arrowheads/bold lines indicate involvement of both major
clades. If no particular subclade could be inferred for a given combination, arrows start at the polytomies of the 'Western' or
'Eastern' clades. Multiple hybridizations are indicated by patterned arrows. They reflect particular ribotype combinations, not
any order of subsequent hybridizations. Numbers near the arrowheads refer to particular hybrid accessions: 1 - H. amplexicaule, H. gouani; 2 - H. bracteolatum, H. racemosum, H. sabaudum; 3 - H. bupleuroides 1033, 4 - H. caesium, H. lachenalii, H. laevigatum; 5 - H. candidum, H. cerinthoides, H. cordifolium, H. gymnocerinthe; 6 - H. glaucum; 7 - H. lucidum; 8 - H. mixtum, H.

nized towards particular variants by concerted evolution.
The phylogeny (Figure 2) would in that case represent a
gene tree rather than a species tree. However, the geographic pattern along with the divergent genome sizes
observed for the major clades, the general congruence of
cpDNA haplotypes with ETS subclades/species groups
(Additional file 5: Species/accessions, their origin, cytotype, ETS and cpDNA features), and the correspondence
of ecological preferences or morphological similarities of
species belonging to particular (e.g., 'H. porrifolium', 'H.
umbellatum') subclades strongly argue in favor of true species relationships. In contrast, lineage sorting is expected
to result in randomly distributed ribotypes following
divergence from a polymorphic ancestor. Only the incongruent patterns observed in Balkan species (Figure 4)
show features that are best explained by ancestral polymorphism and lineage sorting (see Results). For most of
our data, however, this is not the most parsimonious
explanation. Instead, we consider hybridization among
members of divergent lineages to be a more likely interpretation, at least for the additive patterns.
In many cases, a considerable number of intra-individual
polymorphisms were superimposed on the variation due
to additivity. While shared informative polymorphisms
contained additional phylogenetic signal (see Results),
most of the non-additive variation was unique/accessionspecific (Figure 1), i.e., phylogenetically uninformative.
These polymorphisms were either randomly scattered on
different physical strands or tended to have accumulated
in a particular ribotype (e.g., 'Eastern' or 'Western', see
Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination). This is
consistent with the assumption that they resulted from
mutations occurring on different nrDNA repeats and had
spread in the genome to some degree - in order to be
detected at all in direct sequencing, they have to reach a
threshold of at least 5% of all copies - but failed to be
completely homogenized by concerted evolution (similar
to retained parental variants in most hybrids). The large

amount of unique or apparently randomly distributed
(homoplasious) intra-individual variation (Figure 1) may
indicate partial saturation with intra-individual polymorphisms suggesting slow concerted evolution relative to
mutation rates. The occurrence of two or even three different kinds of polymorphism at 35 positions points in the
same direction. At one of these positions (254), C as a
derived character state evidently arose twice independently; once as part of the 'unknown Western 2' ribotype,
and once on the 'Eastern' alleles of Balkan species (Figure
4, Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination).
Due to the complex patterns and abundance of intra-individual variation, prior to phylogenetic analysis of the ETS
dataset, noise had to be distinguished from meaningful
variation, and reticulation had to be identified as such,
because hybrids are known to confound phylogenetic
analysis when they remain undetected [69,70]. Almost
half of all accessions analyzed showed evidence of reticulation. Even restricting the analyses to diploids was not an
option in this case, because diploids were equally polymorphic on average and also included interclade hybrid
accessions. In fact, the highest number of polymorphisms
occurring in any accession (37) was found in a diploid (a
hybrid containing four divergent ribotypes plus many
unique polymorphisms) while the lowest numbers (1 or
2 polymorphisms) occurred in some triploids and tetraploids of presumed autopolyploid origin. Although a
number of programs are currently available that can deal
with intra-individual variation and reticulation
[59,71,72], no algorithm can possibly distinguish
between meaningful and homoplasious patterns if they
occur at the same aligned positions, or identify hybridization from partial additivity or from novel hybrid
sequences (e.g., H. prenanthoides, H. mixtum). Similarly, in
a recent study on Fagus where a high level of intra-individual polymorphism in the ITS region was detected [73],
only detailed visual investigation of the variability patterns allowed the inference of the basic phylogenetic pat-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:239

terns. Also, in a study of sexual Erigeron species that
showed frequent intra-individual polymorphism in ITS
and ETS sequences, a fair degree of handwork had to be
done to identify diagnostic/additive patterns, to distinguish informative from uninformative variation, and to
detect recombination in cloned sequences [44]. However,
reticulation explained most of the observed variation in
that case - in contrast to our dataset where the majority of
intra-individual variation was uninformative or even misleading.
Basic patterns of Hieracium evolution
The basal split into a 'Western' and an 'Eastern' clade suggested by ETS was not predicted by morphology nor suggested in any taxonomic treatment. In the light of our
data, we suggest several reasons for that failure: (i) both
clades include species (groups) with unique morphology,
(ii) both comprise species with large or Central European
distribution areas, (iii) the large number of interclade
hybrids has confounded the picture, and (iv) several morphologically defined taxa had multiple origins and are
probably inadequately circumscribed. Dating of this basal
divergence is not feasible because of a lack of fossils; fossil
pollen cannot be attributed to particular genera in the
Asteraceae subfamily Lactuceae [74]. However, there are
some indications that suggest a Quaternary timescale, at
least for speciation within both major clades (see below).

Low overall ETS sequence divergence indicates that,
despite rather high morphological diversity even within
each clade/subclade, speciation was not accompanied by
significant molecular differentiation. Similar observations
have been made in other plant genera [75,76]. ETS
sequence divergence in many other Asteraceae genera is
considerably greater [12,77-80]. Exceptions are genera
that have a restricted geographic range, were sampled only
from a restricted area, underwent rapid recent speciation,
experienced population bottlenecks, or a combination of
these [12,81,82]. The first two reasons do not apply here
as our sampling covered the entire, rather large distribution area of Hieracium (North America to Siberia, Scandinavia to the Mediterranean). An indication of rapid recent
speciation is the extremely low level of ITS variation in
Hieracium s.str. ([13], and unpublished data). While taxonomic levels are not strictly comparable between groups,
even ITS sequence divergence, although often markedly
lower than ETS variation, has proved useful for the inference of plant relationships at species and genus level in
numerous studies. This might suggest a rather recent
divergence even of the two major lineages identified by
the ETS region. An especially rapid diversification of lineages could be reflected by the basal polytomies of both
major clades. The coincidence of the distribution of many
diploid and endemic taxa with known glacial refuge areas
[83,84] may indicate that these are remnants of originally

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

much larger populations or higher species diversity. The
Quaternary in Europe was characterized by many range
expansions/contractions related to climatic oscillations
which could have resulted in repeated population bottlenecks [85]; this may help to explain the low genetic diversity in our data. After the retreat of the Pleistocene ice
sheets, rapid speciation within the 'Eastern' and 'Western'
lineage may have been facilitated by the availability of
vast areas open to colonization [86]. Subsequently, sympatric speciation by hybridization among these previously
separated lineages - accompanied or followed by polyploidization or introgression at the diploid level - may
have provided a quick way to adapt to new ecological conditions and to invade new habitats. The obvious correspondence of the distribution areas of many non-hybrid
endemics and diploids with known glacial refuge areas
and the abundance of interclade hybrids suggest extensive
reticulation after the two lineages came into secondary
contact. This is in accordance with Stebbins' secondary
contact hypothesis [86], which is corroborated by numerous case studies (e.g., [28,87,88]), albeit mostly at the
intraspecific level. Above species level, a similar east-west
differentiation that may be related to survival in different
glacial refuge areas was found in Hieracium subgenus
Pilosella although in that case it mainly concerns divergent
chloroplast haplotypes [89].
In the wake of polyploidization, the onset of apomictic
reproduction may also be linked to climatic change during or after the Ice Ages [89]. Most diploids are nowadays
confined to the southern part of the distributional range
of the genus from where the regions further to the north
were later re-colonized, which is also a common pattern
in other apomictic plants [90]. The largest sequence divergence was found among and within diploids. There is no
indication that polyploidy as such has added much to the
overall genetic variation. However, polyploidization, frequent hybrid origin, and fixation and spread of genotypes
by apomixis have generated the huge number of taxa
which makes Hieracium one of the largest plant genera,
even if a broad species concept is adopted. The large
number of accessions with interclade hybrid origin shows
that members of the two major clades were not yet reproductively isolated when the reticulation occurred despite
their differences in genome size which are reflected by the
genome sizes of their hybrids [46].
Indications for ancient hybridization
Even taxa having composite genomes according to our
data have unique morphology - reflecting Zahn's [3] definition of a 'basic' species - which is why their hybrid identity had not been assumed before. However,
contemporary hybridization is thought not to play a large
role in Hieracium s.str. [37]. In the following, we discuss

Page 17 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:239

several lines of evidence for ancient hybridization with a
special focus on diploids with hybrid origin.
Geography
Many diploid Hieracium species are not sympatric and/or
are ecologically isolated. Diploid hybridogenous accessions (or species) that are particularly unlikely to have
formed recently are H. gouani, H. gymnocephalum 1215, H.
lucidum, H. plumulosum, H. pojoritense, H. prenanthoides
1252, and H. sparsum. All occur in areas that have never
been glaciated, or only partly. Some of these (H. lucidum,
diploid H. prenanthoides) have particular relict character,
i.e., their populations are most likely remnants of a previously much larger distribution, or their localities are typical refugia (H. gouani, H. pojoritense, H. plumulosum). In
case of H. lucidum, pollen producing polyploids like H.
crinitum (treated as a subspecies of H. racemosum by Zahn
[3]), could have played a role in past hybridization events
[91]. Nowadays, no population of any other Hieracium
species occurs in the neighborhood of H. lucidum. Thus,
recent hybridization events among diploids are highly
unlikely.
Molecular patterns
ETS signatures of diploid accessions of H. prenanthoides
and H. gymnocephalum were also found in polyploids of
the same species indicating that these diploids with
hybrid origin have given rise to widespread polyploids
assigned to the same taxon. Hieracium gymnocephalum is a
morphologically very variable and mostly triploid aggregate - our accession 1215 represents the first report of a
diploid in this species [46] - whose variation is thought to
be caused by past hybridization or introgression [92].
According to ETS, H. sparsum occurs at an unresolved position within the 'Eastern' clade, and two accessions from
different localities were nearly identical in their molecular
features. Thus, genetically, H. sparsum s.str. behaves like a
'good species' which is in accordance with morphological
and floristic observations. While we analyzed mostly diploid accessions of these taxa, H. sparsum s.l., H. prenanthoides s.l., and H. plumulosum (H. waldsteinii s.l.) are
predominantly polyploid species and are supposed to
have been involved in the formation of many 'intermediate' taxa - some of them widespread -, which is suggestive
of extensive ancient hybridization, particularly of the diploid progenitors with hybrid origin.
Reproduction
All diploid accessions analyzed here are sexuals with normal seed production [46] while a rare recent natural
hybrid was sterile [37]. Experimental hybridization of
diploids also resulted in mainly or completely seed-sterile
hybrid progeny [93]. Whilst we did not analyze the breeding system of H. lucidum - because of its critically endangered status, no living plants were collected - isozyme

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

analyses showed some variation, which is in accordance
with sexual reproduction and also with a small population size over a rather long period of time [91]. Apomicts
of Hieracium have very variable male fertility, ranging
from almost complete sterility to normal pollen fertility
[52,94,95]. Triploid apomicts, which represent the vast
majority of Hieracium species, can produce haploid pollen
and could therefore fertilize diploid accessions (resulting
in diploid hybrid progeny). This would be the only way to
overcome the geographic isolation of most recent diploids
and to produce significant numbers of hybrids nowadays.
However, pollen from other species can lead to a breakdown of self-incompatibility resulting in autogamy. This
so-called mentor effect has been demonstrated to be especially strong for pollen from apomictic triploids in Hieracium s.str. [95]. Nowadays, autogamy enforced by
contact with foreign pollen is a very efficient way to avoid
hybridization.
Finally, since most of these Hieracium species had been
described prior to 1900, many by Linnaeus himself, it is
unlikely that hybridizations that gave rise to 'basic' species
occurred within the last few hundred years.
Thus, the unanticipated hybridizations involved in the
formation of many of the 'basic' species may actually be
rather ancient, and may even date back to the early
Holocene (see above). This would also provide a reasonable time frame for the formation and spread of the large
number of 'intermediate' Hieracium species, whose morphology suggests a hybrid origin involving two or more of
the 'basic' species.
Evidence for the contribution of variation from extinct
taxa
Several lines of evidence suggest a contribution from
either unsampled taxa or from extinct lineages that have
left molecular traces in the accessions analyzed. We consider contribution from extinct forms more likely, for the
following reasons.

The 'unknown Western 1' ribotype, occurring in six hybrid
species, at least four of which have different origins, was
not found as the only ETS variant in any existing species.
The respective accessions were collected from sites as distant as Sicily, Poland and the Balkans. The 'unknown
Western 1' ribotype may have originated from a lineage/
species that was either once widespread, given the collection sites of the hybrid accessions in which it was found,
or its genome has spread along with apomictic polyploids
after hybridizations in a Western European region. Similarly, the 'Western' parent of six interclade hybrids represented by five different species corresponded to the
'unknown Western 2' lineage. This ribotype also has a
large geographic distribution according to the sampling

Page 18 of 23

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:239

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/239

sites (France, Southeastern Alps, Southern Balkans). A further ribotype present only in hybrids ('unknown Eastern')
occurred in four accessions of three species and was
restricted to a particular part of the Balkans (Albania,
Montenegro).

species and other taxa. Also, the majority of Hieracium
populations are polyploid and, thus, are unlikely as predecessors. We therefore consider it more likely that extinct
species have left their molecular traces in the genomes of
taxa with rather ancient hybrid origin.

Chloroplast DNA haplotypes of several hybridogenous
accessions (H. plumulosum, H. olympicum/H. gymnocephalum, H. mixtum) were unique and fairly divergent from
others given the low overall variation of this marker (Figure 3), i.e., a candidate maternal parent is missing. This
could be an indication that more diploids existed than are
known today, since apomictic polyploids can only act as
pollen donors and therefore cannot contribute to cpDNA
diversity. Even allowing for the accumulation of mutations in the cpDNA after ancient hybridizations does not
explain why the majority of hybrid chloroplast haplotypes
were identical to one of the parental groups inferred from
the ETS. Almost identical cpDNA haplotypes occurred in
H. olympicum ('unknown Western 1'/Balkan) and H. gymnocephalum ('unknown Western 2'/'unknown Eastern').
Given their genomic composition according to ETS, they
seem to share a maternal progenitor that does not correspond to any of the identified ribotype lineages.

Species number also argues for the existence of a large
range of extinct diversity. Out of the 46 'basic' species analyzed, which were initially considered as the main evolutionary units, only ten diploid species did not show
molecular evidence of hybrid origin. Theoretically, ten
parental species can produce 45 different hybrid combinations (or 90, if reciprocal crosses are considered as different hybrids). However, at least 32 diploids would be
needed to explain the species numbers in Hieracium, if
only macrospecies were taken into account (500). As it is
very unlikely that each possible parental combination
would be realized in nature, the original number of diploids should probably be much higher.

Whilst insufficient sampling can never be excluded, it is
unclear what the identity of the species providing the
missing variation could possibly be or where they should
occur. The only 'basic' species not included in our study
were H. fuscocinereum, a Northern European polyploid
species with some similarities to H. murorum; H. schmalhausenianum, a Caucasian endemic with unknown ploidy;
and H. laniferum, a diploid occurring in parts of Spain.
The latter is the only candidate that could theoretically
consist exclusively of one of the 'unknown Western' ETS
ribotypes, but it could well be of hybrid origin itself, like
half the other 'basic' species or be genetically indistinguishable from the majority of 'pure' species of the 'Western' clade. In any case, these three unsampled taxa
certainly cannot account for all the missing variation, i.e.,
the second 'unknown Western' and the 'unknown Eastern'
ribotype, and at least three divergent hybrid chloroplast
haplotypes (even if one of them corresponds to an
'unknown' ETS lineage). There is also no explanation why
20% (12 out of 60) of the accessions collected from distant geographic sites should comprise these ribotypes, but
the ancestral species have always been missed by chance for the other subclades whose ribotypes also occurred in
hybrids, 'pure' candidate parental species were present.
Unsampled intraspecific variation as a potential source of
the missing variation is also unlikely. Taxa with more than
one accession analyzed showed either (i) the same patterns, independent of ploidy, 'pure' species status, or
inferred hybrid origin, or (ii) one accession represented a
'pure' species while others were hybrids involving that

Morphological indication of potential hybrid origin
involving particular recent species is also missing from the
analyzed taxa, a fact that is reflected by their treatment as
'basic' species which by definition do not show evidence
of character combinations of other species. In contrast, for
the multitude of 'intermediate' taxa not analyzed here,
morphology does suggest putative parents. Experimental
hybridization of several diploid Hieracium species showed
that hybrid progeny of the same cross can exhibit a large
range of morphological variation, but generally, hybrids
were either intermediate between their parents or more
similar to the maternal one [93]. Thus, hybrid origin from
extant parents should usually be detectable. Taken
together with the relict character of most diploids, this
points to a greater ancestral species diversity now reduced
by extinctions. This could - among several other factors contribute to explaining some of the taxonomic problems
in Hieracium: As morphological characters of extinct species are naturally unknown, hybrid origin of extant taxa
can easily go undetected due to the lack of one or both
parents. Even hybridization of the same two parents may
result in strikingly dissimilar phenotypes, depending on
the particular contribution of gametes. One of the best
known examples is the hybrid origin of three different
sunflower species from the same parental species combination [96]. However, as long as the parental species and
their morphological diversity are known, correct determination of polymorphic hybrids by an expert taxonomist is
still feasible [36,97]. However, if only one parent is
extinct, even morphological identification of the same
hybrid taxon may become impossible.
Our findings add to an increasing number of studies in
which the contribution of extinct parent(s) was inferred
from molecular data [30,98-103].

Conclusion
The initial aim of this study was to disentangle relationships and species origins of the taxonomically highly
complex Hieracium s.str. for the first time using molecular
markers. The particular features of the ETS dataset, characterized by abundant intra-individual variation, most of
which was uninformative and some even misleading,
required a very detailed inspection of the nature of this
variation in order to retrieve the phylogenetic signal and
to identify the unexpected hybrid origins of roughly half
of all accessions analyzed (Figure 5). Whether the complex data structure is the result of the particular history
and extensive apomixis in Hieracium, or whether similar
molecular patterns will be found in other groups, remains
to be seen. The approach used here for the analysis of
intra-individual polymorphism might act as a model for
the study of other agamic complexes and other similarly
challenging patterns of molecular data.

Additional file 4
Alignment of Hieracium ETS sequences. A FASTA file is given comprising two sequences for each accession (i) one with all polymorphic sites
included (lower case letters indicate weak [i.e., second peak small] or
indel polymorphisms): the sequence name is composed of the abbreviated
species name and the number of the accession/plant, and (ii) one resolved
for the major sequence in case of skewed ratios: same label, but preceded
by an 'M'. Additionally, cloned sequences are given for the respective
accessions: same label, but preceded by the clone number. The positions in
the alignment correspond to Table 1, Figure 4, and Additional files 2 and

1187, H. caesium, H. pilosum 1226/2, H. villosum 1305, H. gymnocephalum 1215, H. heterogynum, H. plumulosum) and H. kittanae, the non-hybrid accession with the highest number of intraindividual polymorphisms, are shown. Cloned sequences are compared
with intra-individual polymorphisms and dominant character states
revealed by direct sequencing. All cloned accessions with recombinant
sequences are included. Patterns of gene conversion and the distribution
of accession-specific polymorphisms across the cloned sequences can be
traced. Color coding of diagnostic character states as in Figure 5.

ETS phylogeny with ribotypes present only in hybrids. The file contains
the phylogenetic analyses on which Figure 5 is based. One out of 1402
equally parsimonious trees is shown (1752 steps, ri = 0.952, ci = 0.982;
182 variable characters of which 95 were parsimony informative) with
bootstrap support indicated above the branches. The strict consensus tree
topology corresponds to the branches with support values. Bootstrap values
for ML and posterior probabilities for Bayesian analyses are given below
the branches. Diploid Hieracium species are indicated in boldface. All
lineages comprise diploids (the 'unknown Western 1' ribotype also occurs
in low amounts in diploid H. lucidum which was not cloned). The Wx,
Wy, and Ex lineages are represented by all non-recombinant clones of
these ribotypes. Identical clones of the same accession were included only
once (see also Additional file 2: Patterns of ETS recombination). The four
hybrid accessions still maintained in Figure 2 were excluded, and also H.
lachenalii and H. sparsum because of inferred chloroplast capture. Figure 5 uses the basic structure of this tree on which all inferred reticulation
events were mapped.
