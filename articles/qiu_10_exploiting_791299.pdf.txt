Exploiting EST databases for the development
and characterization of EST-SSR markers in
castor bean (Ricinus communis L.)

Abstract
Background: The castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), a monotypic species in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae,
2n = 20), is an important non-edible oilseed crop widely cultivated in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate
countries for its high economic value. Because of the high level of ricinoleic acid (over 85%) in its seed oil, the
castor bean seed derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants, nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and
biodiesel. Due to lack of efficient molecular markers, little is known about the population genetic diversity and the
genetic relationships among castor bean germplasm. Efficient and robust molecular markers are increasingly
needed for breeding and improving varieties in castor bean. The advent of modern genomics has produced large
amounts of publicly available DNA sequence data. In particular, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide valuable
resources to develop gene-associated SSR markers.
Results: In total, 18,928 publicly available non-redundant castor bean EST sequences, representing approximately
17.03 Mb, were evaluated and 7732 SSR sites in 5,122 ESTs were identified by data mining. Castor bean exhibited
considerably high frequency of EST-SSRs. We developed and characterized 118 polymorphic EST-SSR markers from
379 primer pairs flanking repeats by screening 24 castor bean samples collected from different countries. A total of
350 alleles were identified from 118 polymorphic SSR loci, ranging from 2-6 per locus (A) with an average of 2.97.
The EST-SSR markers developed displayed moderate gene diversity (He) with an average of 0.41. Genetic
relationships among 24 germplasms were investigated using the genotypes of 350 alleles, showing geographic
pattern of genotypes across genetic diversity centers of castor bean.
Conclusion: Castor bean EST sequences exhibited considerably high frequency of SSR sites, and were rich
resources for developing EST-SSR markers. These EST-SSR markers would be particularly useful for both genetic
mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of castor bean.

Background
Castor bean (Ricinus communis L., Euphorbiaceae, 2n =
20) is an important non-edible oilseed crop and its seed
derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants,
nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and biodiesel. Among
all the vegetable oils, castor bean oil is distinctive due to
its high level of ricinoleic acid (over 85%), a fatty acid
consisting of 18 carbons, a double bond between C9
and C10, and a hydroxyl group attached to C12.

Ricinoleic acid is responsible for castor bean oil interest,
with the highest and most stable viscosity index among
all the vegetable oils combined with high lubricity, especially under low-temperature conditions. Although it
was found that castor bean seeds had been used by people dating from about 4000 BC [1], it is still an unanswered question about the origin of castor bean
cultivation. Castor bean’s contemporary distribution in
the warmer regions is worldwide, although its origin is
obscured by wide dissemination in ancient times and
the ease and rapidity with which it becomes established.
Castor bean is indigenous to southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, and most probably originated in tropical Africa [2,3]. Because of its

high economic value, castor bean is widely cultivated in
tropical, sub-tropical and temperate countries, particularly India, China and Brazil [4]. Due to increased
demand for castor bean in many countries, breeding
and improvement of varieties are drawing great attention from breeders [5].
Although the genus Ricinus is considered monotypic,
castor bean varies greatly in its growth habit, color of
foliage and stems, seed size and oil content [6,7]. Most
types are large perennials that often develop into small
trees in tropical or subtropical areas; however it is
usually shorter and smaller and grown annually in areas
prone to frost. It is obvious that castor bean exhibits
great phenotypic diversity and phenotypic plasticity to
environmental factors. However, little is known about
castor bean’s genetic diversity and the genetic basis of
its phenotypic plasticity. Castor bean is usually considered to be both self- and cross-pollinated by wind, but
controlled crossing studies suggest that outcrossing is a
frequent mode of reproduction [8,9].
Germplasm collections constitute one of the world’s
most readily available sources of plant genetic material
[10]. The USDA-ARS Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit (at Griffin, GA, USA) collected and maintained diverse germplasm resources of castor bean
worldwide, which provided valuable germplasms for castor bean breeding and improvement of varieties. There
is an increasing need for distinguishing the varieties reliably, establishing their purity, and fingerprinting
released varieties, hybrids and the parental lines of castor bean germplasm held in different countries by efficient molecular markers during breeding and
improvement of varieties. Most cultivars have low productivity. The castor bean seed, meanwhile, contains the
highly toxic protein ricin which seriously limits its
usage. The main goal of breeding and improvement of
varieties to breeders is to develop high-productivity and
nontoxic varieties of castor bean. Developing robust and
reliable molecular markers associated with traits of
interest will enhance the breeding program efficiency.
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites
showing extensive length polymorphisms have been
widely used in DNA fingerprinting, genetic diversity studies, construction of genetic linkage map and breeding
applications [11]. Previous studies of genetic diversity
suggested that SSRs are more informative and robust
than other available molecular marker resources, such
as amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and
random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in castor
bean [12,13]. In particular, SSR markers are readily
transferable between laboratories as each locus is
defined by the primer sequence. SSRs can be used not
only for identifying cultivars but also for genetic mapping and marker-assisted selection [14,15]. Development

of SSR markers specific to castor bean is critical and
should be a priority for assisting in the breeding and
improvement of varieties [5]. The SSR markers of castor
bean are, however, very limited to date because the
de novo development of SSRs is a costly and time consuming endeavor [16,17]. The advent of modern genomics age has produced large amounts of publicly
available DNA sequence data. In particular, the
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide a valuable
resource for identifying and developing gene-associated
SSR markers. Linkage of EST-SSR markers with desired
characters may lead to the identification of genes controlling these traits [18]. In addition, EST-SSRs are universal and can be applied in comparative mapping and
linkage map construction [19,20]. Therefore, in recent
years, EST-SSRs have already been developed for various
crops such as wheat and rice [21-25], barley [26-28],
grape [29], tomato [30], sugar cane [19], coffee [31-33],
oil palm [34] and rubber tree [35].
To our knowledge, there has been no report of development of EST-SSR markers in castor bean to date.
Therefore, we report our work on EST-SSRs derived
from castor bean ESTs in the National Centre of Bioinformatics Information, USA database, based on (1) the
frequency and distribution of SSRs in castor bean ESTs,
(2) the establishment and validation of EST-SSR markers for detection of polymorphism in castor bean, and
(3) the assessment of genetic relationships among 24
germplasm accessions collected from main diversity centers of castor bean by using EST-SSR markers developed. These rich SSR resources from castor bean EST
database are publicly available and the polymorphic
EST-SSR markers reported herein would be particularly
useful for genetic map-based analyses as well as population genetic studies, facilitating breeding and crop
improvement of castor bean.

Results
Frequency and distribution of microsatellites

A total of 18,928 non-redundant castor bean EST
sequences trimmed were identified from 62,611 publicly
available EST sequences by running the EST-TRIMMER
and the CD-HIT programs. The search for microsatellites in 18,928 non-redundant castor bean ESTs representing approximately 13.68 Mb revealed 7,732
microsatellites in 5,376 ESTs; nearly one in 3.5 unique
ESTs (28.4%) contained at least one SSR; 2,356 ESTs
contained more than one SSR and 573 SSRs were found
as compound SSRs. This corresponds to an average distance between SSRs of approximately 1.77 kb (i.e. one
SSR per 1.77 kb) or one SSR-containing EST every 2.45
ESTs. The SSRs identified contained 1939 di-, 3698 tri-,
220 tetra-, 61 penta-, 138 hexa-, and 1676 mononucleotides (Table 1). The trinucleotides are the dominant

repeats accounting for 96.9% of total mononucleotide
repeats (1676) were the dominant mono- motifs; 1350

Similarly, there were no obvious dominant motifs
among the tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide motifs.

Polymorphism and genera transferability of EST-SSRs
markers

Out of 6056 SSR embedded within 3871 ESTs, excluding 1676 MNRs, primer pairs could be designed for
4223 SSR loci (69.7%) by using PRIMER3. The remaining sequences contained either too little DNA sequence
flanking the SSR loci or the sequences were inappropriate for primer modeling. Three hundred and seventynine primer pairs flanking 151 di-nucleotide repeats
(DNRs), 185 tri-nucleotide repeats (TNRs), 35 tetranucleotide repeats (TeNRs), 4 penta- nucleotide repeats
(PNRs) and 4 Hexa-nucleotide repeats (HNRs) were
assayed to test the polymorphism and genera transferability of EST-SSRs in 24 accessions worldwide (see
additional file 1, Table S1, additional). In 308 (81.2%)
cases, PCR products could be amplified with genomic
DNA, while for 71 primer pairs PCR completely failed,
amplified too weakly, or amplified multiple bands and
the 71 primers were excluded from further analysis (see
additional file 2 Table S2, additional). In 21 cases, the
amplicons obtained were of obviously larger size than
expected from the EST sequence, probably due to the
presence of introns. The amplification of introns may
cause problems, since fragments above 300 bp could not
be scored accurately for small differences in fragment
size. Additionally, it can be assumed that in several
cases the observed polymorphism is caused by a size
polymorphism within the intron, which may overshadow
a putative polymorphism of the microsatellite. Thus the
21 primer pairs containing obvious introns and producing over 300 bp fragments were also excluded from
further analyses. One Hundred and sixty-nine primer
pairs were monomorphic, covering 56 di- motif loci, 104
tri- motif loci and 9 tetra- motif loci. In total, 118 polymorphic EST-SSR markers from 287 primer pairs were

Page 4 of 10

identified, including 68 di- motif loci, 42 tri- motif loci
and 8 tetra- motif loci (see additional file 2, Table S2,
additional). The proportion of polymorphic primers was
41.1%. The polymorphic proportion of di-, tri-, and
tetra- motif loci were 54.8%, 28.8% and 47%, respectively. From the 118 loci we identified 350 alleles with
an average of 2.97 alleles per locus (Table S3, Figure 2).
Of the 350 alleles, 223 alleles were from di- loci with an
average of 3.28 per locus, 107 alleles were from tri- loci
with an average of 2.49 per locus. Across 118 loci, gene
diversity (expected heterozygosity, He) ranged from 0.08
to 0.78 (mean = 0.41 ± 0.02). Among 68 dinucleotide
loci and 42 trinucleotide loci, the mean of He were 0.44
and 0.37, respectively. Across dinucleotide and trinucleotide loci, dinucleotide SSRs were significantly more
polymorphic than trinucleotide SSRs (nA and He both
P < 0.01; 2-sample t test). Across 118 loci, PIC values
ranged from 0.07 to 0.73 (mean = 0.36 ± 0.02), suggesting the EST-SSR markers developed had moderate level
of polymorphism. BLAST analyses showed that 76 EST
sequences from the developed 118 polymorphic SSR
markers shared significant homology to Arabidopsis loci.
The functional annotations of markers developed were
listed in Table S3 (see additional file 3, additional).
To test the genera transferability of EST-SSRs identified
in castor bean to Jatropha curcas and Speranskia cantonensis, the 308 primer pairs, which could successfully
amplify PCR products in castor bean were tested for
amplification of the genomic DNA of J. curcas and
S. cantonensis with the same PCR conditions used in
castor bean. 155 of 308 (50.2%) primer pairs amplified
in S. cantonensis, and 74 of 308 (24.0%) primer pairs
amplified in J. curcas (see additional file 1, Table S1,
additional).

the five distinct clusters (Cluster I, Cluster II, Cluster III,

within clusters (data not shown).

Discussion
SSR frequency and distribution

The non-redundant EST sequences provided a more
accurate representation of the densities of SSR motifs in
the transcribed portions of the genome [20,32]. Based
on the 18,928 non-redundant castor EST sequences,
7732 SSRs were identified. The overall density of SSRs
is one SSR per 1.77 kb, nearly one in 3.5 unique ESTs
(23.6%). Using the same cut-off criteria, Ellis and Burke
inspected the frequency of EST-SSRs from 33 plant genera and found that the frequency varied from one in
every 5 unique ESTs (21%) to one in every 40 unique
ESTs (2.5%), with a mean frequency of nearly one SSRESTs in every 10 unique ESTs (9.0%) [18]. Compared to
the 33 plant genera, castor exhibits considerably high
frequency of EST-SSRs. To further compare the overall
densities of SSRs in castor bean EST sequences with
that reported in other plants, we used the same cut-off
criteria as Cardle et al. [21] with 7, 5, 4 and 4 repeats
for di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-, respectively, excluding the
mono-repeats. Correspondingly, we identified 2710 SSRs
with one SSR per 5.0 kb (1/5.0kb) EST sequence in
castor. This density is higher than that in soybean
(1/7.4 kb), maize (1/8.1 kb), tomato (1/11.1 kb), Arabidopsis (1/13.83 kb), poplar (1/14.0 kb), and cotton
(1/20.0 kb). However, it is lower than that in rice
(1/3.4 kb). Similarly, we separately used the same cut-off
criteria as Aggarwal et al. used in coffee [33], Low et al.
used in oil palm [34] and Feng et al. used in rubber tree
[35], and identified 10,442 (1/1.31 kb), 4,177 (1/3.3 kb)
and 3,616 SSRs (1/3.8 kb) respectively, higher than that
in coffee (1/2.16 kb) and oil palm (1/7.7 kb), and lower
than that in rubber tree (1/3.39 kb). Varshney et al.
assumed that the high frequency of SSR in rice EST
sequences may be due to its small genome size [36].
The genome size of castor was estimated to be 323 Mb
[37]. The high frequency SSR in castor EST sequences
may be related to its small genome size.
Like other plants, A/T is the main mononucleotide
motif in castor bean EST sequence [23]. Among the
dinucleotide repeat motifs identified, AG/CT repeats
(1350) were the most common in the dataset, accounting for 69.6% of the total dinucleotide motifs (1939).
These results are consistent with the frequency of DNRs
identified in Arabidopsis, rice, soybean, maize, oil palm,
coffee, barley, wheat and rubber tree [23,24,27,32,34,35].
Kantety et al. suggested that the high level of occurrence
of GA/CT motifs could be due to the high level of
occurrence of the translated amino acid products of the
motifs [38]. The GA/CT motifs are translated into GAG
(Glu), AGA (Arg), CUC (Leu) and UCU (Ser). We
inspected the codon usage from 200 ORFs containing
44,298 codons in castor bean EST sequences and

Page 6 of 10

detected 10,892 codons for these four amino acids
(24.6% of the total codons analyzed), accounting for that
the four amino acids have a relatively higher frequency
than the amino acids produced by the other dinucleotide repeats (data unshown). Thus, Kantety et al.’s
assumption was supported in our study. The CG/GC is
the most rare di- repeat in accordance with that
reported in other plants compared [23,24,27,32,34,35].
Varshney et al. reported that among cereal species
TNRs were the most frequent (54-78%) followed by
DNRs (17.1-40.4%) and TTNRs (3-6%), excluding MNRs
[36]. Our results (excluding MNRs) are consistent with
cereal species with the most frequent TNRs (61.1%), followed by DNRs (32.0%), and TTNRs (3.6%). The abundance of trimetric SSRs in ESTs was attributed to the
absence of frameshift mutations in coding regions when
there is length variation in these SSRs [39]. Among the
tri- motifs AAG/CTT is the most frequently occurring
(23.5%) in castor bean ESTs, followed by AGC/GCT
(16.6%), ACC/GGT (15.0%), ATC/GAT (12.5%), AAT/
ATT (9.5%). Morgante et al.’s observation that AAG/
CTT is predominant and CCG/CGG is relatively rare
tri- repeats in dicotyledonous plants [23] was confirmed.
The mono-, di-, tetra- and penta- repeat loci mainly
occurred within UTR regions, while tri- and hexarepeat loci occurred mainly within exon regions. This
seems to be a common feature of EST-SSRs and has
often been found in other organisms. This could be a
result of selection and evolution, since tri- and hexaSSRs do not change the coding frame in coding regions
when there is a SSR length variation, while mono-, di-,
tetra- and penta- SSR easily change the coding frame
within coding regions and give rise to negative mutation
when the SSR length variation occurred.
Polymorphism of EST-SSR markers and genera
transferability

Hitherto, little work has been done on the development
and application of SSR markers in castor bean genetic
and breeding studies. We obtained 118 polymorphic
EST-SSR markers from 379 primer pairs within 24
germplasm sampled with a polymorphic ratio of 41.1%,
excluding the null allele primers and those that harbor
obvious introns. Compared to other plants, the polymorphic ratio of EST-SSR primers in castor bean is at
the medium level [20]. These polymorphic EST-SSR
markers derived herein, to our knowledge, are the first
report on development of genic microsatellite markers
in castor bean to date. Using these 118 polymorphic
EST-SSR markers, 350 alleles were identified from 24
accessions with an average of 2.97 alleles per marker.
Allan et al. reported nine genomic SSR markers with an
average of 0.403 gene diversity (PIC) and an average of

Qiu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:278
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/278

3.01 alleles per locus [13]. Bajay et al. developed 12
genomic SSR markers with an average of 0.416 gene
diversity (He) and an average of 3.3 alleles per locus
[40]. Our results displayed that the gene diversity (He)
and PIC value of the 118 polymorphic markers were
0.41 and 0.36, respectively. These results were consistent
with each another, suggesting that SSR locus of castor
bean represents a moderate level of gene diversity. The
gene diversity values (He and PIC) reported herein can
serve as a guide in selecting the loci that are most likely
to be informative in further castor bean research.
As mentioned above, di- and tetra- SSRs mainly
occurred within UTR regions, while tri- SSRs mainly
occurred within exon regions. Unsurprisingly, di(54.8%) and tetra- (47%) motif loci presented higher
polymorphic proportions than tri- motif loci (28.8%) in
castor bean, suggesting that the SSRs which occurred
within UTR are more polymorphic than those in exon
regions. Across di- and tri- motif loci, di- motif markers
presented significantly higher gene diversity than those
of the tri- motif markers. These observations showed
that the SSR loci harbored within UTR regions were
more polymorphic than these harbored within exon
regions in castor bean.
Transferability of EST-SSRs among closely related
genera has been reported in many crops. Ellis and Burke
summarized the transferability of EST-SSRs among plant
taxa and exhibited a variation range of EST-SSRs crossgenera transferability from 10% to 80% [18]. Our results
indicated that castor bean EST-SSRs had a moderate
transfer rate (50.2%) in S. cantonensis and a relatively
lower transfer rate (24.0%) in J. curcas. Raji et al.
reported the transfer rate of EST-SSR markers developed from Manihot to castor bean was 15% [41]. The
different cross-genera transferability of EST-SSRs may
be related to the evolutionary distance between the
three genera, since castor bean phylogenetically has a
more distant relationship with Jatropha than Speranskia
and Manihot [42].
Evaluation of genetic relationships among germplasms

As mentioned above, castor bean belongs to a
monotypic genus with great phenotypic diversity and
phenotypic plasticity. Castor bean is a fast-growing and
easily-establishing perennial shrub under various habitats, and is widespread throughout tropical and subtropical regions and is often found on wastelands today. It
is difficult to establish castor bean’s origin now, though
it is thought to be native to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India. According to
Moshkin, there are four main centers of genetic variability viz., Irano-Afghanistan-USSR region, Palestine-SW
Asia, India-China and the Arabian Peninsula, each with
its own specific plant characteristics [43]. It is an

Page 7 of 10

acceptable view that castor bean landraces collected
from South or North America today were most likely
introduced from Africa or west Asia in early society due
to human activities.
Our current research identified five distinct groups
Clusters I-V within 24 samples using the genotypes of
350 alleles. Apparently, the five clusters lacked a geographic structure because the two South American
germplasms (BR and PE) clustered with two African
members (SA and MA) in Cluster I, and the North
American accession (MX) clustered with two Indian
(IN-1 and IN-2) members in Cluster III. However, if we
assume that the two South American germplasms (BR
and PE) and the one North American germplasm (MX)
were introduced from Africa or west Asia, our current
research seems to support, in a way, Moshkin’s view
[43], namely, Cluster I represents African members,
Clusters II and III represent Irano-Afghanistan-USSR
and Palestine-SW Asia members, and Clusters IV and V
represent India-China members. It is noteworthy that
the germplasms sampled in the current study is limited
and incomplete. It remains to be determined whether
this geographic pattern of germplasm group is present
in a more extensive survey of germplasm samples. Allan
et al.’s studies [13] did not identify distinct geographic
groups among worldwide germplasms. The possible reasons could be that 1) the polymorphic markers used in
their studies were limited, or 2) many castor bean germplasms were introduced or multi-introduced across several continents due to human activities. It may be
difficult to figure out the origin and domestication of
castor bean without the genotype of the wild castor
bean germplasms. Without a doubt, the polymorphic
EST-SSR markers developed herein will provide robust
genetic markers for further investigation of the origin
and evolution of castor bean, though the geographic
structuring of castor bean germplasms detected from
our current study is uncertain.

Conclusion
In summary, the castor bean EST database harbored
highly rich SSR sites and the EST-SSR markers reported
herein exhibited moderate levels of gene diversity. These
EST-SSR markers should prove useful for both genetic
mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating
breeding and crop improvement of castor bean.
Methods
Plant material and EST retrieval

Twenty-four worldwide accessions representing the
main germplasms of castor bean from 14 countries were
used to screen the polymorphism of SSR markers developed, and to investigate the genetic diversity of germplasms based on the polymorphic SSR markers. Seeds of

Qiu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:278
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/278

each accession were obtained from the USDA National
Plant Germplasm System http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/
and our collected landraces in China and Vietnam
(Table 2). Phylogenetically, the genus Speranskia has a
closer relationship with Ricinus than the genus Jatropha
[42]. The genomic DNAs of Jatropha curcas and Speranskia cantonensis were used to test the cross-genera
transferability of EST-SSR markers which can amplify
PCR products using castor bean genomic DNA. The
seeds of accessions were germinated at a greenhouse,
and the young leaves were collected for genomic DNA
extraction using a CTAB methodology [44].
Castor bean EST sequences were obtained via the
ENTREZ search tool of the EST database at the NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucest. A total of 62,611
castor bean ESTs originated from different tissues were
available for this study on January 1, 2009, including the
750 ESTs (GE632454-GE637384) from developing seeds
[45], 158 ESTs (AM267320-AM267478) from phloem
[46], 4307 ESTs (EV519634-EV523941) from endosperm
[47], 4,902 ESTs (AM267321- AM267479) from developing seeds [Kroon et al. released in 2008, unpublished],
329 ESTs (CF981112-CF981441) from seed [Cahoon et

al. released in 2003, unpublished], and the 11,633;
24,567; 5,619 and 10,346 ESTs (EG690439-EG702071,
EG665872-EG690438, EE254600- EE260857, EG656356EG665871, EE253769-EE254599) from developing seeds,
root, flower and leaf, respectively [Melake et al. released
in 2006, unpublished]. The FASTA-formatted files of
EST sequences were downloaded for further data
mining.
Data mining for SSRs

In a preliminary step, polyA and polyT stretches which
correspond to polyA-tails in eukaryotic mRNA were
removed with the help of the EST-trimmer software
http://www.pgrc.ipk-gathersleben.de/misa/download/esttrimmer.pl until no stretch of (T)5 or (A)5 was present
in a range of 50 bp on the 5’- or 3’-end, respectively.
EST sequences of less than 100 bp were discarded and
sequences larger than 800 bp were clipped at their 3’
side to preclude the inclusion of low quality sequences
[27]. To remove redundant ESTs, the CD-HIT program
[48] was used with a 95% sequence similarity threshold.
Then trimmed non-redundant EST sequences were
scanned using the MISA (MIcroSAtellite) tool [27] to
identify all SSRs within a set of sequences. We set the
script to identify all possible mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta- and hexanucleotide repeats (MNRs, DNRs,
TNRs, TeNRs, PNRs and HNRs) with a minimum of 10,
5, 4, 4, 4, and 4 subunits, respectively. The results of the
MISA run were transferred to a Microsoft Excel worksheet for further analyses.
To localize the distribution of SSRs on EST sequences,
the ESTscan2 http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/ESTScan2.html was used to inspect the ratio of SSR distribution on the transcribed regions (TRs) and UTRs.

Primer pairs were designed from the flanking sequences,
using PRIMER3 software [49] in batch mode via the
p3_in.pl and p3_out.pl Perl5 scripts within the MISA
package [27]. To test the polymorphisms of EST-SSRs
identified in castor bean, we randomly selected 379 primer pairs. The target amplicon size was set as 100-300
bp, the optimal annealing temperature as 60°C, and the
optimal primer length as 20 bp.
PCR primers were developed and an M13 forward
(GGAAACAGCTATGACCAT) was added to the 5’ end
of one of each primer pair using OliGO 6.67 (Molecular
Biology Insights) to determine which tag would produce
the least offensive secondary structures. Inclusion of the
5’-tag allows use of a 3rd primer in the PCR (M13F) that
is fluorescently labeled for detection on ABI3730 DNA
Analyzer. M13F primers were labeled with a FAM fluorescent dye. PCR reactions were carried out in a 10 μl
volumes containing 1x PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl

pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgCl2), 100 μM each
dNTP, 0.04 μM tag labeled Forward primer, 0.16 μM
universal dye labeled primer, and 0.2 μM Reverse primer, and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase. Approximately
10 ng of genomic DNA was used in each reaction. The
reagents for PCR amplification were from TAKARA
Biotechnology (DaLian) CO. LTD.
Primers were tested using TOUCHDOWN thermal
cycling programs encompassing a 10° span of annealing
temperatures ranging between 65-55°C, or 60-50°C.
Cycling parameters were: an initial denaturing step of
3 min at 95°C, followed by ten cycles of 30 s at 94°C,
30 s at the highest annealing temperature (annealing
temperature was reduced by 1°C per cycle), 45 s at 72°
C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C
(for 65-55°C touchdown range) or 50°C (for 60-50°C
touchdown range), 45 s at 72°C, and a final extension
time of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were initially
scored for amplification on agarose gels, and successful
PCR products were subsequently sized on an ABI 3730
DNA Analyzer, after clean-up with Millipore® 96 well
filter plate. Genescan 500 ROX size standards (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California) were run in each
lane to allow for the accurate determination of fragment
size, and alleles were called using the GeneMapper software V4.0 (Applied Biosystems). Ambiguous samples
were run a second time.
The putative functions of identified polymorphic markers were annotated by BLASTX against the NCBI
Non-Redundant Protein http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
RefSeq/. In order to test the cross-genera transferability
of SSR markers developed from castor bean EST
sequence, all primer pairs producing successful PCR
bands using castor bean genomic DNA were tested
using J. curcas and S. cantonensis genomic DNA as
templates.
Statistical analysis

The level of polymorphism per locus (number of alleles,
nA, and expected heterozygosity [i.e., gene diversity],
He) was calculated using the program GDA [50]. The
polymorphic information content (PIC) is a tool to measure the informativeness of a given DNA marker. Thus
we calculated the PIC value for each locus using PIC
calculator http://www.liv.ac.uk/~kempsj/pic.html.
In order to investigate the genetic relationships among
germplasms using these polymorphic SSR markers identified, we scored these SSR products as the presence (1)
and absence (0) of the band, thus generating a binary
matrix. The binary data matrix was transferred to the
software PAUP to construct the dendrogram among
germplasms. The unrooted dengrograms were generated
with Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA Nei-Li’s criteria
within PAUP*version 4.0 [51].
