Abstract
Background: The inflorescence of the cut-flower crop Gerbera hybrida (Asteraceae) consists of
two principal flower types, ray and disc, which form a tightly packed head, or capitulum. Despite
great interest in plant morphological evolution and the tractability of the gerbera system, very little
is known regarding genetic mechanisms involved in flower type specification. Here, we provide
comparative staging of ray and disc flower development and microarray screening for differentially
expressed genes, accomplished via microdissection of hundreds of coordinately developing flower
primordia.
Results: Using a 9K gerbera cDNA microarray we identified a number of genes with putative
specificity to individual flower types. Intrestingly, several of these encode homologs of MADS-box
transcription factors otherwise known to regulate flower organ development. From these and
previously obtained data, we hypothesize the functions and protein-protein interactions of several
gerbera MADS-box factors.
Conclusion: Our RNA expression results suggest that flower-type specific MADS protein
complexes may play a central role in differential development of ray and disc flowers across the
gerbera capitulum, and that some commonality is shared with known protein functions in floral
organ determination. These findings support the intriguing conjecture that the gerbera flowering
head is more than a mere floral analog at the level of gene regulation.

Background
The inflorescences of Gerbera hybrida (Asteraceae) are
composed of three different types of flowers (ray, trans,
disc) that are tightly packed into a condensed, radially
organized flower head (capitulum). The presence of morphologically different flower types within a single genotype makes gerbera a unique target for reproductive

developmental studies, since the traditional eudicot
model plants (Arabidopsis, Antirrhinum and Petunia) bear
only single flower forms in their inflorescences. In gerbera, the first stages of development are morphologically
similar in all flower types, with only the position of individual flower primordia in the developing capitulum conferring their developmental fate. However, later in

development many morphological differences emerge.
The most prominent difference between the flower types
is in their sex expression. Gerbera is a gynomonoecious
species bearing both female and hermaphroditic flowers
in the same inflorescence. In the outer female ray and
trans flowers, stamen development arrests to form rudimentary staminodes [1], whereas in the central disc flowers, anthers develop fully, produce pollen, and form a
postgenitally fused structure that covers the carpel. Furthermore, the corollas (fused petals) of ray flowers are
long and zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetrical), whereas
those of disc flowers vary from short-petalled and less
asymmetrical to actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) at
the very center of the capitulum. Corolla size and color
can vary continuosly in different gerbera varieties [2].

new morphologies [e.g., [19-21]]. In this study we have
morphologically characterized very early stages of ray and
disc flower development in Gerbera hybrida. We compared
gene expression profiles among three different stages of
disc and ray flower development using a gerbera cDNA
microarray that includes 9000 probes representing ESTs
from different tissues and treatments [22]. Our goal was
to gather an overall picture of the processes involved in
early gerbera flower development by identifying genes
that may function disparately in the differentiation pathways of ray versus disc flowers. Surprisingly, we found that
MADS-box genes otherwise controlling floral organ determination were differentially expressed in the divergent
flower types.

Results
Admixtures of different types of flowers are common in
species that bear capitula or otherwise dense inflorescences [3,4] and probably reflect a selective advantage of
this type of organization. The gerbera capitulum apparently mimics a large single flower, with the brigthly
colored, elongate ray flowers attracting pollinators to the
center of the inflorescence where bisexual flowers are
located. Flower head form within Asteraceae can vary
from radiate to discoid, bearing at least ray and disc flowers, or cycles of disc flowers only [5]. The prevalence of different flower head forms varies among the different
subfamilies and tribes of the Asteraceae [5,6]. The presence or absence of ray flowers seems to be under control
of one or two major genes, but several modifier genes are
also involved [reviewed in [6,7]]. Perhaps the best studied
system in this aspect has been Senecio, where flower head
type is principally controlled by the RAY locus, with the
radiate phenotype dominant over discoid [8-10]. Gross
phenotypic resemblance to the centroradialis (cen) mutant
of Antirrhinum, which has a radially symmetrical terminal
flower surrounded by zygomorphic axillary flowers in
peripheral region around the inflorescence apex, has
prompted research to test the hypothesis [11] that the RAY
locus encodes a homolog of the floral symmetry gene
CYCLOIDEA [12-14]. However, recent microarray comparisons of Senecio taxa differing primarily in flower morphology revealed only few genes – and not CYCLOIDEA –
potentially involved in observed differences in floral
development [15].
Progress in the genetics of plant reproductive development over the last two decades has shown that the most
important genes specifying flower development encode
transcription factors, many of them MADS domain proteins [16-18]. There are several examples in which homologous genes have evolved different functions in different
species as the result of sub- or neofunctionalization [17].
Furthermore, relatively simple regulatory changes in transcription factors can be responsible for the evolution of

Early stages of flower development in Gerbera hybrida
During early stages of reproductive development, individual flower primordia arise in an acropetal spiral from the
inflorescence meristem. Undifferentiated ray flower primordia are the first to arise in inflorescences of less than 6
mm in diameter, whereas the first disc flower primordia
are detected in inflorescences of approximately 6–8 mm
in diameter (Figure 1). We divided early flower development into six different stages that were characterized using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological
staining (Figures 1 and 2). Figure 1 demonstrates the first
five stages of perfect (fully bisexual) disc flower development. At stage 1, flower primordia are small, undifferentiated bumps, whereas at stage 2, ring-shaped petal
primordia begin to form. At stage 3, pappus (whorl 1),
petal (whorl 2) and stamen (whorl 3) primordia can be
clearly distinguished. Until this point in development,
both ray and disc flowers still appear morphologically
similar and can only be identified based on their position
in the inflorescence (Figure 2A). At stage 4, petals begin to
elongate, covering the developing stamen and carpel primordia. Flower organ elongation continues during stages
5 and 6 (Figure 2B). As with SEM, histological analysis
reveals no morphological differences between ray and
disc flowers at stage 3 (Figure 2C). However, at stage 5,
stamens lag behind and are shorter in the female ray flowers compared to the perfect disc flowers (Figures 2B and
2C). Furthermore, at stage 5, the ray flower petals have
already fused together, and the shapes of the bilabiate ray
flowers with their three highly extended lower lobes plus
two minute upper lobes can be distinguished. Conversely,
in disc flowers, the developing petals are separated from
each other. At stage 6, the differences in petal elongation
are even more pronounced. At this stage, pappus bristles
are much longer in both flower types, nearly covering the
developing primordia (Figures 2A and 2B). In earlier
work, we defined the stages of capitulum development
based on ray flower petal development [23]. Developmental stage 6 in ray flowers and disc flowers as described

in ray flowers. In disc flowers most of the genes were
related to basic metabolic processes. One of the most
abundant transcript upregulated in disc flowers is the gerbera homolog of Vegetative Storage Protein (VSP) gene.
VSPs principally accumulate in vacuoles and have a putative role in nitrogen storage and in biotic and abiotic stress
responses. In Arabidopsis, VSP mRNAs are highly abundant
in flowers, where they may have distinct roles during
reproductive development [24,25]. The gerbera VSP
homolog also showed significantly greater expression in
stage 6 disc flowers. In ray flowers at stage 3, most of the
upregulated genes encoded unknown proteins. However,
one gerbera MADS-box gene, GRCD1, showed greater
upregulation. GRCD1 has previously been suggested to be
required for defining stamen identity in gerbera [1].

Microarray analysis of gene expression during ray and disc
flower development
cDNA microarray analysis comparing ray and disc flower
primordia was performed separately for developmental
stages 3, 5 and 6. The gerbera cDNA microarray contains
approximately 9000 probes representing all distinct unigenes from the gerbera EST collection [22]. Most of the
probes (ca. 80%) printed on the microarray represent
transcripts from floral cDNA libraries and genes expressed
during inflorescence development [22]. Microdissected
material for RNA isolation was collected and pooled
together from a single clone over a year's time from hundreds of flower primordia across tens of inflorescences. In
circumstances such as with gerbera flower primordia sampling, where true biological replicates are not possible due
to limited amounts of plant material, pooling is a means
to minimize biological variation. For our experiments we
also pooled several independent RNA isolations and
amplified them prior to dye labelling. Each experiment
included four technical replicates each with two dyeswaps. We have verified the present microarray results
with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for 12 random
transcripts and for 8 gerbera MADS-box genes (See Additional files 1 and 2).

Following non-linear Lowess normalization of the microarray data, a statistical analysis (one-sample t-test) was
performed to discover genes that show significant differences in their expression. The analysis was done separately
for each developmental stage. To minimize the number of
false positives a Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate
(FDR) was used to control the Type I family-wise error.
Transcripts with p-value < 0.05 were selected as statistically significant. With this analysis, the total numbers of
differentially expressed genes were 29 at stage 3, 227 at
stage 5, and 2264 at stage 6. Distributions of these genes
within and between the flower types are visualized with
the Venn-diagram shown in figure 3. Only few expressed
genes were shared between stages, demonstrating the
rapid transcriptional changes occurring during very early
stages of gerbera flower development. The raw data for the
experiments presented here have been lodged at the
ArrayExpress under accession number E-MEXP-418.
Genes differentially expressed during ray and disc flower
development
At the earliest developmental stage included in the comparison (3), the disc and ray flowers were morphologically similar. This was reflected at the gene expression
level, where few changes are detected. Only 27 transcripts
showed significant differences in expression with p-value
< 0.05 and fold change more than 1.2 (Table 1). From
these, 15 showed greater expression in disc flowers and 12

The number of differentially expressed genes was found to
increase with developmental time, in concordance with
increasing morphological differences between the flower
types. In disc flowers, the number of genes showing statistically significant changes in expression was 111 at stage 5
and 1156 at stage 6, and in ray flowers, 116 and 1108,
respectively. Below, we limit further discussion to the
group of genes showing flower-type specific upregulation
during both stages 5 and 6 (Table 2). In disc flowers, 49
transcripts were upregulated in both stages 5 and 6 (Table
2). Twenty (41 %) of these gave a BLAST hit while the rest
have unknown function.
One of the most significantly upregulated gene had a
match to GDSL-lipase. These enzymes are highly abundant in Arabidopsis flowers and are postulated to have specific functions during anther morphogenesis [25,26].
GDSL-motif lipase genes are also highly expressed
throughout tepal development in Iris hollandica [27].
Another upregulated gene encoded alpha-expansin,
known to be involved in growth and development
[28,29]. The most prominent group of genes, however,
were those encoding lipid-transfer proteins, which form a
large gene family in gerbera [22]. The gerbera C-class
MADS-box gene GAGA1 was also more abundantly
expressed in disc flowers in comparison to ray flowers at
both stages 5 and 6.
42 genes were more strongly expressed in ray flowers than
in disc flowers at both stages 5 and 6 (Table 2). Of these,
55 % (23), had unknown functions, and many others
encoded ribosomal proteins. Most of the identified genes
(36) were also upregulated during early petal development (in ray flowers) in our previous microarray analyses
[22] reflecting differences in petal development that occur
during early stages of flower-type differentiation.

detected in elongating flower scapes in addition to being
expressed during early petal development [22].
G0000700014E10, annotated as a polyphenol oxidase
precursor, was more than 5-fold upregulated in ray flower
primordia in comparison to disc flowers. Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are ubiquitous in higher plants and are the
major cause for tissue browning due to oxidization of
phenolic substrates. PPOs have been suggested to have a
role in defense against insects and plant pathogens, but
they may also be activated by mechanical stress. A PPO
homolog encoded by aureusidin synthase has been
shown to function in flower coloration [30].
Transcription factor genes showing differential expression
at stages 5 and 6
Since transcription factors widely regulate many aspects of
development, we examined these genes more closely. In
addition to the statistical criteria (p < 0.05) we used a fold
change threshold of > 1.2 for differentially expressed transcripts. As described earlier, at stage 3, only the MADS-box
gene GRCD1 was detected to have greater expression in

ray flowers as compared with the corresponding stage in
disc flowers. In both flower types, most of the differentially expressed transcription related genes were expressed
during stages 5 and 6, and moreover, they showed stagespecific expression (Tables 3 and 4). Especially prominent
was the upregulation of several homeotic MADS-box
genes that are known to regulate flower development (discussed separately below).
In addition to MADS-box genes, we identified one gene
differentially expressed in disc flowers at stage 5 encoding
a putative RING zinc finger protein. RING and variantRING domain proteins are widespread in plants, and as
parts of multiprotein complexes they are involved in
diverse cellular functions, e.g., ubiquitination pathways
[31,32]. Two gerbera homeobox HD-ZIP factor genes
upregulated in disc flowers shared high sequence similarity with a xylem-specific Zinnia elegans gene [33] as well as
with Arabidopsis REVOLUTA (REV) and CORONA (CNA)
genes, both members of the HD-ZIP III gene family
[34,35]. HD-ZIP III genes play numerous roles in develop-

ment, including embryo patterning, vascular development, leaf development (organ polarity) as well as meristem initiation [35,36]. The gerbera EST database currently includes four
clusters of genes that are homologous with Squamosa Promoter Binding Proteins (SBPs)
and Squamosa Promoter Binding Like (SPL) proteins. Two of these were upregulated in
disc flowers at stage 6. In Arabidopsis, SPL3 has been shown to be involved in floral transition [37,38] and SPL8 in pollen sac development [39] but functions for the other 16 SPL
genes remain largely unknown. We also identified two genes encoding YABBY transcrip-

tion factors (G0000800003E02, G0000700008F1). Together with KANADI genes, the
YABBY gene family promotes abaxial identity of organs [36]. In addition, several transcription factors related to regulation of transcription initiation, chromatin assembly, and
mRNA processing were upregulated in disc flowers.
In ray flower primordia, 39 genes were differentially upregulated (Table 4). Many of the
transcription factors therein belong to different classes of zinc-finger proteins [40]. BLAST

searches indicated that G0000100020B08 and G0000600011G06 are homologous with
putative flowering-time genes identified in maize (INDETERMINATE1, [41]) and Arabidopsis (CONSTANS-like 3). The functional role for the GATA1 zinc-finger-like protein
G0000500013B9 is not known as yet. We also identified a LIM domain protein homolog
upregulated in ray flowers at stage 6. We have previously observed that pLIM2 [22] was

more than 8-fold upregulated during late stages of stamen development. Nevertheless,
multiple functions have been shown for LIM domain proteins in plants, including transcriptional regulation in the nucleus [42,43,40]. Finally, at stage 6, we detected upregulation of the bHLH factor encoded by G0000600012D07, previously isolated as GMYC1 and
involved in anthocyanin regulation in gerbera [44].

Figure 3
Distribution of the differentially expressed genes
Distribution of the differentially expressed genes.
Venn diagram shows distribution of genes which are significantly differentially expressed in different stages of individual
flower types. Differential expression is based on one-sample
t-test p-values. The number of differentially expressed genes
increases with development and correlates with the morphological changes detected in flower types. Many of the genes
show stage-specific expression. Genes expressed only at
stage 3 and those common to stages 5 and 6 were analyzed
more closely.
Several MADS-box genes show differential expression
during ray and disc flower development
Several previously characterized gerbera MADS-box genes
[[45,46] Figure 5] showed differential expression during
the early stages of ray and disc flower differentiation
(Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4). GAGA1 and GAGA2 are C-function

genes known to be involved in regulation of stamen and
carpel identity in gerbera [47]. GDEF1 shares high
sequence similarity with GDEF2, another B-function gene
in gerbera, but it groups phylogenetically with TM6-like
genes of the B-class lineage [48]. Its function during gerbera flower development has not yet been established
[45]. GRCD2 is required for carpel identity, but the gene
also controls maintenance of flower meristem identity as
well as inflorescence determinacy [49]. All of the aforementioned genes are upregulated in bisexual disc flowers
in comparison to female ray flowers. PHEP7F1 encodes
the SQUAMOSA-like gene GSQUA1 [47], and
G0000800002C9, also upregulated in disc flowers,
encodes a MADS-box gene homologous to Chrysanthemum CDM8, which belongs to the FRUITFULL clade [50].
In ray flowers, GRCD1, which was more expressed already
at stage 3, was similarly upregulated at stage 6. In addition
to GRCD1, another MADS-box gene, G0000100021A03,
showed greater expression in ray flowers at stage 6.
G0000100021A3 (including the 3' EST G0000100002C11)
is a TM3-like MADS-box gene that showed late petal-specific expression in our previous microarray analyses [22].
G0000700003A3 (now named GRCD5), which was significantly more expressed in ray flowers, groups phylogenetically close to the previously identified gerbera gene
GRCD1 as well as Arabidopsis SEPALLATA3 (data not
shown). GRCD5 shares highest sequence similarity with
the CDM44 MADS-box gene from chrysanthemum and
FBP2 of petunia [50,51]. In fact, GRCD5 appears to be
orthologous to CDM44 in phylogenetic analysis (data not
shown). According to the same phylogenetic analysis
(data not shown), G0000200014A7 (GRCD3), which is
transcriptionally abundant in ray flowers, lies in the AGL6
clade [52], grouping close together with AGL6,
MDMADS11, and ZAG3 and ZAG5 [cf. 1].
G0000200001C06 shows sequence similarity to the chrysanthemum CDM51 and gerbera G0000500017F4 MADSbox genes, the latter of which has a leaf specific expression
pattern [22] similar to Arabidopsis AGAMOUS-like MADSbox protein AGL12. We observed similar expression patterns for the gerbera MADS-box genes using real time
reverse transcriptase PCR (See Additional file 2).
Co-expression of MADS-box genes during flower
development in gerbera
MADS domain proteins form specific homo- and heterodimers and even higher order complexes to conduct
their function [53,54]. Specific interactions among MADS
domain proteins require that they are present in the same
cells and tissues under the same developmental stages,
and correspondingly, it has been shown that transcripts
with overlapping expression patterns are preferred as protein interaction partners [55,56]. In order to strengthen
our observations above and to reveal coordinated expres-

The first set of genes represents those that are co-expressed
with the C-class gene GAGA1, which was the only MADSbox gene showing significant change in expression in both
stages 5 and 6 (Table 2 and 3). Across all nine conditions
included in the analysis, 27 genes showed an expression
pattern similar to GAGA1. The highest correlation (0.96)
was observed for GRCD2, the product of which was previously demonstrated to interact with GAGA1 using yeast
two hybrid analysis [49]. Furthermore, the second gerbera
C-function gene, GAGA2, as well as the B-function genes
GGLO1 and GDEF2, were co-expressed with GAGA1.
GGLO1, a B-function gene orthologous to Arabidopsis
PISTILLATA required for petal and stamen identity [47].
also showed disc-flower specific expression at stages 3 and
5 in microarray (when multiple-testing correction was not
applied). This result was verified using real time RT-PCR
(Table S1b) and northern blotting (data not shown). The
functionally unknown TM6-like gene GDEF1, the SEPALLATA-like gene GRCD4, and GSQUA1 were also included
among the GAGA1-coexpressed group of genes. In addition to MADS-box genes, several other co-expressed transcription factor genes were identified including those
encoding Squamosa Binding Protein Like homolog 3, two
zinc finger proteins and an MYB domain factor similar to
Antirrhinum MYB305, an early regulator of the phenylpropanoid
pathway.
GRCD1, which is already strongly upregulated in ray flowers at stage 3, continuing to stage 6, is co-expressed with
the TM3-like MADS-box gene G0000100021A03 in all
nine conditions (Figure 4b, Table 5). Two SEPALLATAlike genes also showed a highly correlated expression pattern. Furthermore, we identified a co-expressed gene
encoding a MYB domain transcription factor similar to

sion patterns for gerbera MADS-box genes, we combined
our present observations with our previous analyses [22].
In an independent analysis we looked for genes that were
differentially regulated along with GAGA1 and GRCD1.
GAGA1 was chosen because it was differentially expressed
in disc flowers at both stages 5 and 6, and GRCD1 due to
its early upregulation in ray flowers at stage 3 (Tables 1
and 2). Previously [22], we used the gerbera cDNA microarray to identify inflorescence-specific genes in comparison to leaf tissue as well as genes specific for individual
reproductive organs and stages (flower scape, pappus bristles, early and late petal development, and stamens). The
samples represented relatively late stages of flower organ
development in contrast to the early stages of flower primordium development analyzed here. Standard correlation was used to find transcription factors whose
expression correlated (correlation coefficient >0.80) with
GAGA1 or GRCD1 across all nine conditions (Figure 4).
Table 5 summarizes the identified genes.

Discussion
Nearly nothing is known about genetic mechanisms
involved in flower-type specification, neither in Asteraceae nor in any other plant bearing heteromorphic flowers within a single genotype. We have defined the early
stages of ray and disc flower development in Gerbera hybrida and have shown that although flower development
initiates similarly in both flower types, differences in petal
and stamen development can be identified at relatively
young stages of inflorescence development. The large size

of gerbera inflorescences as well as the presence of hundreds of coordinately developing flowers permitted us to
microdissect individual flower primordia for RNA isolation and to compare gene expression during early stages of
development. In general, we did not identify genes constitutively expressed throughout the chosen developmental
stages, indicating that rapid transcriptional changes occur
during very early stages of gerbera ray and disc flower
development. The number of differentially expressed

genes in our microarray comparisons increased dramatically with developmental time, which correlates with
morphological differentiation as shown with SEM and
histological analyses.
In our experiments we focused particularly on transcription factors that were differentially expressed in ray and
disc flower primordia. Typical for disc flowers was the
high number of genes putatively involved in mRNA

processing and transcriptional regulation. We also identified several Squamosa Promoter Binding Protein
homologs, the functions of which are still largely
unknown even in Arabidopsis. HD-ZIP III type transcription factor genes similar to REVOLUTA were also upregulated in disc flowers. There are five genes encoding HDZIP III factors in Arabidopsis, REVOLUTA, PHAVOLUTA,
PHABULOSA, CORONA, and ATHB8. During embryogenesis, Arabidopsis HD-ZIP III triple mutants fail to distinguish the central domain from the peripheral domain
of the developing embryo, which leads to formation of a
single, radially symmetric cotyledon [35]. Given this
potential role in normally occurring asymmetry, it is
tempting to speculate that the identified gerbera HD-ZIP
III factors could function in regulation of symmetry at the
inflorescence level. In ray flowers the most prominent
group of upregulated transcription factor genes encode
MADS-box regulatory proteins.
Differences in stamen and petal development
Clear morphological differences between the flower types
in stamen and petal development (Figures 2B and 2C)
that begin at stage 5 probably reflect differences in cell
division and elongation as well as in organ fusion. The
most prominent difference is the arrest of stamen development in ray flowers. As also observed in gerbera, a common mechanism for generating unisexual flowers is the
selective developmental arrest of either female or male
organ primordia, which may occur at different stages of
development in different species [58]. The most fundamental genes discriminating the sexes in flowering plants
are the homeotic B- and C-class genes, which distinguish
between carpel and stamen development [58]. Based on
the ABC model of flower development, stamen identity is
determined by activity of both B- and C-class MADS-box
genes, while the activity of C-class genes alone controls
carpel development [59]. However, several studies in eudicot species have failed to provide unambiguous support
for a hypothesis that development of unisexual flowers
would involve alterations in the expression patterns of the
B- or C-function genes, which indicates that the genetic
mechanisms in sex determination must act downstream
of organ identity [60-64]. In gerbera as well, alterations in
B- and C-class MADS-box gene expression are not likely
the cause of arrested stamen development in ray flowers.
Our results suggest that the role of the SEP-like gene
GRCD1, highly upregulated in ray flowers, could be
related to the flower-type specific arrest of stamen development. In ray flowers of transgenic plants in which
GRCD1 expression was downregulated, sterile staminodes
were converted into anthocyanin pigmented petals. However, stamen development was only slightly affected in
bisexual disc flowers, where fertile pollen was produced
although not released [1]. Altogether, these results suggest
that the arrest of stamen development is connected to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/11

organ identity that is differentially established in ray versus disc flowers. We propose that whorl 3 organ identity
establishment involves GRCD1 function, but only in ray
flowers.
Differential expression of genes encoding MADS domain
transcription factors – flower-type specific regulatory
complexes
The microarray data, as supported by real time RT-PCR,
suggest that MADS-box proteins may be involved in specific complexes required for the differentiation of individual flower types during inflorescence development in
Asteraceae. Differential gene expression of several gerbera
MADS-box genes (GGLO1, GDEF2, GAGA1, GAGA2 and
GRCD1) had earlier been detected with northern blots
representing the same floral developmental stages used in
this study (M. Kotilainen, unpublished data). The quantitative differences we observed at the gene expression level
may reflect later qualitative protein-protein interaction
differences and thereby the composition of specific protein complexes involved in regulation of organ identity in
different flower types. Because our expression data
revealed genes whose expression is correlated both spatially and temporally in various gerbera tissues, we are
able to hypothesize specific protein-protein interactions,
some of which have already been confirmed by yeast twohybrid assays or are supported by transgenic phenotypes.
A comprehensive interaction analysis of Arabidopsis
MADS-box factors has shown that almost 100% of the
interacting proteins have an overlap in expression pattern
[56]. Coexpression can be taken as an indication for possible in planta interaction [56]. Furthermore, we have
identified differential expression of new SEP-like genes,
which in gerbera and other plants show a diversity of
functions beyond those described for Arabidopsis
[1,49,65]. Figure 5 summarizes our current view of gerbera organ-identity genes, indicating (above the arrow)
specific factors that have shown flower-type specific
effects in transgenic plants [46].

Upregulation of B- and C-class MADS-box genes as well as
the SEP-like gene GRCD2 in central disc flowers probably
reflects the major role these genes play in determining
normal stamen and carpel identity (carpels only in case of
GRCD2). In transgenic plants, suppression of B (GGLO1,
GDEF2), C (GAGA1, GAGA2) or GRCD2 function caused
similar phenotypes in both flower types [47,49]. Interestingly, the expression of GSQUA1 and the SEP-like gene
GRCD4 correlated with B- and C-class gene expression.
Despite its sequence similarity to Arabidopsis APETALA1,
GSQUA1 is probably not involved in establishing the A
function since its expression was detected at the base of
developing flowers, in petals, and in developing vascular
bundles of the capitulum [47,45]. However, GRCD4 was
also upregulated during late petal development in our

A flower-type specific ABC(D)E model in Gerbera
A flower-type specific ABC(D)E model in Gerbera. In Arabidopsis, the genes AP1, AP2, AP3, PI and AG encode homeotic
functions that are needed to determine identity of floral organs according to the ABC model [59]n addition to these genes,
development of Arabidopsis floral organs requires the activity of a fourth function, labeled E in the extended 'quartet' model of
flower development [74], which redundantly encoded by four related MADS box genes, SEP1, SEP2, SEP3 and SEP4. In Gerbera,
the genes GGLO1 and GDEF2 are required for the B function. The C function is redundantly encoded by two highly similar
genes, GAGA1 and GAGA2, but for the E function, we have observed subfunctionalization among SEP-like gene paralogs. In Gerbera, GRCD1 is needed for correct flower organ identity in whorl 3 of marginal female flowers only. Correspondingly, GRCD2 is
necessary only for carpel development, with stronger loss-of-function phenotypes observed in the central disk flowers. Based
on these observations, we predict that still unidentified (possibly redundant) E function MADS box genes are required in
whorls 1 and 2, and in disc flower whorl 3. Furthermore, we have not yet identified Gerbera genes that might code for an A
function active in whorls 1 and 2. These whorls react differentially to ectopic expression of GAGA1 or GAGA2, raising the possiblity that the A function may itself be split in Gerbera. Relative MADS box gene upregulation phenomena observed in our
microarray experiments, organized along the capitulum radius (arrow), are summarized below (and formatted according to)
the gerbera disc and ray flower ABCE models above. Z stands for the TM3-like gene G0000100021A03. GSQUA1 and GRCD1
expression in disc flowers is shown offset between whorls 2 and 3 to show their uncertain whorl-specificity regarding function.

previous microarray studies [22], suggesting that it,
together with B and C function genes, may encode a petalspecific SEP gene in gerbera. The function of GDEF1, a
TM6-like B-class gene upregulated in disc flowers, is less
clear. Unlike GDEF2, which is strongly expressed in both
petals and stamens, GDEF1 is most highly expressed in
stamens (S. Broholm, unpublished results) indicating
function in stamen development. A highly similar gene in
petunia (PhTM6) also showed stamen expression and
strong protein-protein interaction with the petunia
PHGLO2 polypeptide [66]. In gerbera, yeast two-hybrid

results show that both GDEF1 and GDEF2 form heterodimers with the B function protein GGLO1 (data not
shown), whereas neither protein interacts with GRCD2,
the function of which is carpel-specific [49]. GRCD1 and
the TM3-like gene G0000100021A03 are both highly
upregulated in ray flowers. This suggests that these two
genes may encode interacting proteins involved in the
arrest of stamen development. Moreover, the expression
of GRCD1 and G0000100021A03 correlated at the flower
organ level across all nine conditions analyzed, suggesting
that they may have additional functional roles, e.g., dur-

ing petal development. Specific upregulation phenomena
in disc versus ray flowers are summarized in Figure 5
below the arrow, the direction of which follows the capitulum radius.
MADS protein complexes and a radial morphogenetic
gradient
The capitulum of the Asteraceae has been used historically
as a model to study inflorescence meristem development.
Inflorescence determination and phyllotaxis have been
investigated through wounding experiments, and flowertype specific organ development has been analyzed genetically. Both lines of research have suggested the action of
a radial morphogenetic gradient in capitulum development. Cylindrical wounding of early sunflower inflorescences to produce isolated plugs of capitulum receptacle
tissue resulted in the development of complete, miniature
capitula embedded within larger capitula [67,68]. Thus,
the radially organized sunflower receptacle can be reset
into further radially patterned zones via disruption of cellcell communication. Genetic studies of reproductive characters in Microseris also suggest cell-cell communication
radially. The hairy and yellow achene (fruit) traits both
show concentric localization in Microseris capitula,
although they are independently regulated [69]. In the
strains examined, hairy achenes (controlled by at least
two genes) are always peripheral to smooth achenes, and
there is a region of overlap ("half-hairy" achenes) in
which individual cells appear to respond specifically to a
defining gradient. The yellow-achenes trait also shows
radial zonation, the extent of which differs among Microseris strains segregating for two yellow-achenes alleles.
Bachmann and colleagues [70,69] have hypothesized that
the genes responsible for peripheral hairy achenes are participants in the establishment of a radial morphogenetic
gradient, and that the alleles of yellow-achenes have different response thresholds for this gradient.

Morphogenetic gradients with distinct patterning effects,
such as production of ray and trans versus disc flowers in
gerbera, can be set up by simple threshold models of short
range activation and long range inhibition, so long as the
feedback loops are non-linear [71]. An example of a nonlinear relationship is an inhibited activator protein that
must function as a dimer. MADS domain proteins form
specific homo- and heterodimers and even higher-order
complexes to conduct their function [53,54]. The long
range (non-cell-autonomous) inhibitor could be a diffusible small molecular weight compound, but it has also
been demonstrated that plant transcription factor proteins, including the Antirrhinum MADS domain factors
DEF and GLO themselves, can move through plasmodesmata and act non-cell-autonomously [72,73]. Production
of MADS multimers would add significantly to the possible responses to a morphogenetic gradient. In summary,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/11

the MADS protein system can provide a simple numerical
scaffold (dimers, multimers) upon which to generate
great cell, tissue, and organ diversity through differential
regulation along a radius. This is well presented in development of the whorled structure of single floral meristems, but by extension, the same general radial gradient
mechanisms might operate at the inflorescence level, as
suggested by previous work on sunflower and Microseris.
Since we have discovered that different MADS domain
proteins are differentially expressed in ray versus disc
flowers of gerbera (Fig. 5), we hypothesize that developmental control of the Asteraceae capitulum may be more
than a simple analog of the single flower that it resembles.
Comparative flower/inflorescence research on MADS-box
gene transcriptional responses to candidate gradientestablishing molecules, as well as studies of in vivo protein-protein interactions, could help test this hypothesis.
If corroborated, it will remain to be demonstrated
whether gerbera capitula may have acquired flower-like
developmental regulation secondarily, or whether their
condensed structure makes a more general pattern easier
to detect.

Conclusion
Very little is known about the genetic mechanisms
involved in flower type differentiation in Asteraceae. We
have taken advantage of the large size of gerbera inflorescences to morphologicaly characterize developing ray and
disc flower primordia. Although the development of individual flower types initiates similarly, differences in petal
and stamen development are observed at relatively early
stages. Global gene expression analyses using the gerbera
cDNA microarray indicate that rapid transcriptional
changes correlate with morphological differentiation of
dividual flower types. Most interestingly, we identified
several genes encoding MADS domain transcription factors that are differentially expressed in developing ray and
disc flower primordia. We hypothesize that the quantitative and qualitative expression differences discovered
reflect control by a radial morphogenetic gradient across
the capitulum that may lead to formation of specific
MADS protein complexes that regulate the differentiation
of individual flower types. Based on coexpression, we propose functional hypotheses for several MADS-box transcription factors that will be further tested in proteinprotein interaction studies and using transgenic gerbera
plants.

Methods
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Young inflorescences were fixed, dried in a critical point
drying unit and coated with platinum/palladium [49].
Samples were examined through a scanning electron
microscope (Zeiss DSM 962) in the Electron Microscopy

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:11

Laboratory of the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Helsinki.
Light microscopy
Young inflorescences were fixed in FAA (50% ethanol, 5%
acetic acid, 2% formaldehyde) and transferred through
ethanol series into 100% xylene. Samples were embedded
in paraffin and cut into 10 μm sections. For histological
staining, paraffin was removed with xylene and the sections were stained with saffranin (1% in water) and aniline blue (1% in 50% ethanol). The sections were
observed and photographed under a light microscope
(Olympus CX41).
Sample collection and RNA isolation
Flower primordia of ray and disc flowers were isolated
with a scalpel under stereomicroscope and immediately
stored in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) with scaled down
protocol. At least 10 inflorescences, each bearing hundreds of primordia, were collected and pooled together
for RNA isolation in each stage. Each pool included more
than one thousand individual flower primordia. Pooling
of the samples was used in order to minimize biological
variation between samples instead of real biological replicates which were not an option due to the limited amount
of material. Each experiment included at least two RNA
isolations that were pooled together. Quality and the yield
of RNA was analyzed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using RNA
6000 Nano LabChip® kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and RNA 6000 ladder (Ambion, Austin,
TX, USA).
Microarray experiments
Microarray experiments followed MIAME standards and
can be viewed at the ArrayExpress database. Amplification
and labelling of the samples were done using Amino Allyl
Message Amp Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) starting with
2 μg of total RNA. In this total RNA sample several RNA
isolations had been pooled together, as described above.
Total RNA was isolated from the pools of flower primordia. When more than one amplification was required to
get enough amplified RNA (aRNA), several amplifications
were done and pooled together. For one hybridization,
7.5 μg of aRNA was further labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont
Buckinghamshire, UK). For each developmental stage, 4
technical replicates were included from which two were
dye-swapped. In practice, several hybridizations were
done per each stage and the four technical replicates
selected for the analysis were chosen to be of high quality.
Prehybridization, hybridization and washes followed previous protocols [22]. After hybridization, slides for stages
3 and 5 were scanned with GSI Lumonics ScanArray 5000

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/11

(Packard/Perkin Elmer) and for stage 6 using Genetix
5000 AL scanner (Genetix, New Milton, Hampshire, UK)
to produce two gray-scale TIFF images. In the GSI Lumonics ScanArray, laser power was changed in order to adjust
the two channels whereas in the Genetix 5000, laser value
was kept at 100% and PMT gain was changed in order to
adjust the two channels. The resolution was 10 μm in all
cases.
Microarray data analysis
Genepix pro 5.0 (Axon Instruments, USA) was used to
localize the spots and quantify the intensity values in all
experiments. The local feature background median was
used to subtract the background noise, and visually
flawed spots were filtered out from further analysis. Data
were normalized and filtered using GeneSpring 7.2 (Silicon Genetics). Due to the non-linearity of the data Lowess
normalization was applied. Features with a higher background signal than expression signal were excluded from
further analysis. After this the following statistical analysis
was performed to find transcripts with significantly
altered expression levels between the two samples across
four replicates. The data was filtered using one-sample ttest. In order to find genes that were differentially
expressed, a t-test was performed for each developmental
stage (3, 5 and 6) independently. P-values were adjusted
for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini and Hochberg
false discovery rate method that controls the Type I family-wise error, and genes having corrected p-value < 0.05
were selected as statistically significant. Here, using onesample t-test, one can select genes that were differentially
expressed between disc and ray flowers, because RNA
extracted from both flower types were hybridized on the
same chip. Therefore, when the t-test p-value was non-significant, the gene was not differentially expressed, and it
was excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, in addition to the p-value criterion a transcript had to show more
than 1.2-fold change in order to be considered as differentially expressed.
Data mining of co-expressed transcripts with GAGA1 and
GRCD2
Three conditions, stage 3, 5 and 6, from the experiments
reported here were merged with 6 previously done microarray comparisons [22] to form a combined data set with
nine conditions. The previously performed 6 conditions
include gene expression analysis of various flower organs
(early and late petal development, pappus bristles, stamen
and flower scape) that were compared against a pooled
reference sample. Comparison of inflorescence sample to
leaf sample was also included. These experiments have
been described in [22] and the data is available at the
ArrayExpress database with accessions E-MEXP-206 and
E-MEXP-207. After the data from all nine conditions were
merged, the experiment was normalized in GeneSpring

7.2 (Silicon Genetics) using Lowess normalization. Similarity in expression patterns across the various conditions
was used as the criterion for co-expression and was calculated using standard correlation in GeneSpring. Mathematically, standard correlation is very similar to Pearson
correlation, but it measures the angular separation of
expression vectors around zero instead of around one. The
transcripts that were functionally annotated to the class
'transcription' were included in the analysis. Transcripts
that had a correlation coefficient of more than 0.80 with
microarray probes GAGA1 (most highly upregulated in
disc flowers) or with GRCD1 (most highly upregulated in
ray flowers) were considered to be similarly expressed.
Real time RT-PCR
Altogether, 20 transcripts that were printed on the gerbera
cDNA microarray were further verified using real time RTPCR. Total RNA (1.5 μg) was used for cDNA synthesis
using TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Roche Molecular Systems Inc., New Jersey, USA)
and 5 μl of cDNA was used as a template in PCR reactions.
Primers were designed using PrimerExpress software
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR was
done in triplicate with 50 nM of primers using ABI 7700
sequence detection systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) cycling conditions as default. Ubiquitin
was used as a standard against which the raw threshold
values (Ct) were normalized in order to get ?Ct values
(normalized Ct values). Expression ratio was calculated
using the real expression values which in turn were calculated from the formula 2ΔCt. Each plate included separate
ubiquitin standards.
