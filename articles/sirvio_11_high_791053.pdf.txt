A high recombination rate in eusocial
Hymenoptera: evidence from the common wasp
Vespula vulgaris

Abstract
Background: High recombination rates have previously been detected in two groups of eusocial insects;
honeybees and ants. In this study we estimate recombination rate in a eusocial wasp Vespula vulgaris that
represents a third phylogenetic lineage within eusocial hymenopterans.
Results: A genetic linkage map of V. vulgaris based on 210 markers shows that the total map length is 2129 cM
and the recombination rate is 9.7 cM/Mb (or 103 kb/cM). The present estimate in V. vulgaris is somewhat smaller
than in the honeybee Apis mellifera and intermediate between the estimates from two ant species (Acromyrmex
echinatior, Pogonomyrmex rugosus). Altogether, the estimates from these eusocial species are higher than in any
other insect reported so far.
Conlusions: The four species (V. vulgaris, A. mellifera, A. echinatior, P. rugosus) are characterized by advanced
eusociality with large colonies, clear queen-worker dimorphism and well developed task specialization. They also
have colonies with a single, normally multiply inseminated (polyandrous) queen. Benefits of genotypic diversity
within colonies (e.g. through improved task specialization or pathogen and parasite resistance) may have selected
for both polyandry and high recombination rate in such advanced eusocial insects.

Background
Genetic relatedness, the probability of sharing genes that
are identical by descent (IBD), between interacting individuals is a central variable in the genetic models of
social evolution [1]. The coefficient of relatedness can
be calculated on the basis of a pedigree by following the
rules of Mendelian transmission. However, the segregation of alleles among the gametes produced by a diploid
individual is a stochastic process and therefore the relatedness at a specific locus is a variable with a predicted
mean and variance [2]. The variance at a single locus
depends on the segregation, and the variance among
loci depends on the amount of recombination. Based on
these principles, Sherman suggested that the evolution
of insect sociality should benefit from a high recombination rate [3]. His argument was that recombination
reduces the variance of relatedness and makes it more
difficult for nepotistic recognition alleles to invade the

population. This argument applies mainly to a case
where the society consists of a simple family with one
single-mated mother queen, and the variation of relatedness among the offspring depends only on the segregation of alleles from this single mother. Templeton [4]
pointed out that recombination can also favor social
evolution under a quantitative genetic model (through
effects on the variance of inclusive fitness within broods
and on the nonadditive genetic components in quantitative traits) without the restrictions imposed by single
mating and hypothetical recognition alleles.
At the time when Sherman and Templeton presented
their hypotheses, the most conceivable way to estimate
variation in the recombination rate among species was
to compare chromosome numbers. The comparison
showed that eusocial species have, on average, significantly higher haploid chromosome numbers than their
non-social relatives, both in the Hymenoptera and in
the Isoptera [3]. Although the comparisons could be criticized for not correcting for phylogenetic non-independence, the differences were clear. Among ants, the

Results
We genotyped 86 males produced by the single wasp
colony. The microsatellite genotypes (three loci) agreed
with the assumption that the males were haploid sons
of the colony queen. The 55 selective AFLP primer pairs
revealed 217 polymorphic markers. At seven markers,
we could not reliably score 11-13 individuals, at the
other markers the number of unscored specimens was,
on average, less than one. Length polymorphism was
inferred from the presence of two mutually exclusive

chromosome numbers vary widely and there is no general trend of increasing chromosome numbers in different ant lineages [5]. However, Schmid-Hempel [6]
detected a positive correlation between the chromosome
number and colony size in ants, indicating that
advanced social life might be associated with
recombination.
Sherman [3] also stated that increasing the crossingover rate could have the same effect as increasing the
chromosome number and predicted that “eusocial species should have higher crossing-over rates than nonsocial species”. Since then, estimates of the crossing-over
rate have been made in a number of insects, including
eusocial species. The results from two species of honeybees, Apis mellifera [7-9] and A. florea [10], and two
species of ants, Acromyrmex echinatior and Pogonomyrmex rugosus [11,12], showed crossing-over rates that
were higher than in any other animal looked at so far,
thereby lending support to Sherman’s prediction. Sherman [3] suggested that genetic diversity underlying caste
and task specialization of workers could be important
for the evolution of the recombination rate. Recent studies have emphasized this possibility [11,13,14] even
though empirical evidence is lacking. The hypothesis is
based on the general effect of recombination in increasing the diversity of multilocus genotypes among the progeny. As the division of labor among eusocial insect
workers can have a genetic component [e.g. 15], the
hypothesis suggests that recombination helps to produce
a larger number of multilocus combinations and the colony thus avoids a too narrowly specialized workforce.
Even though the available studies show a high recombination rate in the honeybees and ants, the comparison
still suffers from the small number of data points which
are not phylogenetically independent. Hence, the aim of
the present study was to estimate the recombination
rate in a representative of yet another group of highly
eusocial insects, the vespid wasps, where eusociality has
evolved independently from ants and bees. Our results
demonstrate that the wasp Vespula vulgaris is also characterized by a high recombination rate, thereby lending
further support for the hypothesis that this feature is
likely shared by most advanced eusocial species.

bands, and 32% of the markers showed length polymorphism. The mean frequency of the 1-allele over all
the loci was 49.0%, and the frequency distribution (Figure 1) did not depart significantly from the symmetrical
binomial distribution with the expected mean of 50%
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = -0.076, P = 0.17).
The informative AFLP markers were used to build
linkage groups with Mapmaker [16]. Seven markers
were discarded because they were tightly linked (0 cM)
to the other markers derived with the same primer pair.
Of the remaining 210 markers, 13 remained unlinked,
and 197 were linked in groups with the final linkage
thresholds of LOD score 3.0 and maximum marker distance 35 cM. The markers clustered in 38 linkage
groups (Figure 2), six of which had only two markers. In
total, eight originally unlinked markers could be integrated into the existing linkage groups with the nearcommand. Of the final linkage groups, two resulted
from combining the preliminary groups (Figure 2).
With the error detection option of Mapmaker, our
map (1760 cM) decreased by 4.9%; thus our map spans
1674 cM. The map was unsaturated because the haploid
chromosome number of Vespula vulgaris (n = 25 [17])
was exceeded by 13 linkage groups. Since the number of
linkage groups exceeds the haploid chromosome number, we added 35 cM (our threshold distance for joining
the linkage groups) for each gap to cover the distance to
the thirteen additional linkage groups. This resulted in a
final recombinational map size of 2129 cM. However, it
is notable that this underestimates the real distance and
the recombination rate because the gaps in the linkage
map may exceed the used threshold value of 35 cM.
The physical genome sizes estimated from the neural
tissues were 219.8 ± 1.3 Mb for V. vulgaris (N = 4) and
219.6 ± 1.4 for the closely related V. germanica (N = 7).
Males and females gave identical 1C estimates. As the

Figure 2 Marker linkage groups of Vespula vulgaris. The map shows the linkage groups formed by 197 AFLP marker loci.

total map length of V. vulgaris was estimated to be 2129
cM, 1 cM corresponds to approximately 103 kb, resulting in an estimated recombination rate of 9.7 cM/Mb.

Discussion
Recombination by crossing-over is a genetic trait and
the recombination frequency commonly varies both
within and between populations [18]. As a result, the
recombination rate can evolve and respond to natural
selection. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated
that the recombination rate can be selected readily, and
directional selection has had a tendency to elevate
recombination rates in domesticated animals and plants
[18]. The findings that the recombination rate in the
honeybees and ants is higher than in other insects
[7-11] have led to suggestions that it has been selected
for in eusocial insects. Our present results from V. vulgaris are in agreement with this suggestion even though
the role of selection still remains to be demonstrated.

Beye et al. [9] estimated that the average recombination rate in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) genome is 19
cM/Mb with little variation among its 16 chromosomes
(but with considerable variation of the local recombination rate along the genome). A somewhat lower estimate
(16.0 cM/Mb) was calculated by Wilfert et al. [14].
Comparative genetic maps indicate that the recombination rate in another honeybee species, A. florae, is similar to that in A. mellifera [10], These estimates are four
to five times higher than the estimate from the primitively eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris, 4.4 cM/Mb
[19]. We earlier constructed linkage maps and estimated
the recombination rates as 14.0 cM/Mb in the harvester
ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus [12] and 6.2 cM/Mb in the
leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior [11]. The present estimate from the wasp V. vulgaris (9.7 cM/Mb)
thus falls in between the two estimates from ants.
These estimates from the advanced eusocial bees, ants
and wasps are higher than in other insects [14]. The

Sirviö et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/95

estimates in non-social hymenopterans are within the
range 2.5 - 5.4 cM/Mb (4 species of parasitoid wasps)
and in other insects 0.1 - 6.1 cM/Mb (15 species) [14].
The recombination rates in the four advanced eusocial
species (honey bee, leaf-cutter ant, seed harvester ant,
yellow jacket wasp) are significantly larger than in the
other hymenopterans (including the bumblebee, probability of no overlap in the values is P = 0.016) or in
other insects in general (P = 0.0005). Bees, ants and
wasps belong to aculeate Hymenoptera and are thus not
phylogenetically independent. However, the lineages
have diverged a long time ago and eusociality has
evolved separately in them. According to Brady et al.
[20], ants, bees and wasps had a common ancestor
about 160 Mya, and the lineages leading to ants and
eusocial wasps diverged about 140 Mya. The two ants in
which the recombination rate has been estimated had
their common ancestor about 80 Mya [21], and Apis
mellifera and A. florea at least 8-10 Mya [10] and probably about 20 Mya [22]. Even though we cannot exclude
the possibility that a high recombination rate is an
ancestral state, there has been ample time for selection
to modify the rates if they had any adaptive significance.
The use of AFLP-marker data deserves discussion
because the methodology has gained criticism e.g. due
to frequent occurrence of non-homologous fragments
with the same amplicon length [23,24]. Study on Nasonia jewel wasp [25] revealed 41.5% shorter map size
when SNP-markers were used instead of RAPD/AFLP
markers [26]. Similarly in Bombyx mori silk moth
recombination map estimates vary from 3432 cM (simple sequence repeat; [27]) to 1413.4 cM (SNP; [28])
depending on the method and the number of the markers. On the other hand the original estimate of the
honeybee map size was based on RAPD markers (3500
cM [7]) and the subsequent estimates based on microsatellites (4000 cM [29]) or genome sequencing (4553 cM
[9]) have not decreased it. There is thus no universal
trend that the RAPD/AFLP markers would overestimate
recombination, and the data from most insects used in
our comparisons were obtained with these methods,
making the results comparable.
Sherman [3] suggested that a high recombination rate
could be adaptive in eusocial insects either because
recombination equalizes the fractions of genomes shared
by colony members or because it generates a larger
number of different multilocus genotypes. Sherman particularly considered the advantage of genotypic diversity
in caste and task specialization, and Schmid-Hempel
[30] suggested that the same can also apply to defense
against parasites. As noted by Schmid-Hempel, both
recombination and multiple mating by females increase
the genotypic diversity among the offspring and can be

beneficial to eusocial insect colonies under selection by
parasites. The difference between the two factors is that
unlike recombination, mating with many males also
increases allelic diversity. Multiple mating by queens is
known in many eusocial insects but the average mating
frequency is generally rather low [31]. It is noteworthy
that the species in which high recombination rates have
been estimated, have all monogynous societies, i.e. societies with a single queen. They also have large colonies
with clear queen-worker dimorphism and elaborate division of tasks among workers, and the queens are typically highly polyandrous. The estimated number of
effective matings is up to 17.6 in the honeybee A. mellifera, 1.9 in Vespula vulgaris, 4.7 in Pogonomyrmex rugosus and 5.3 in Acromyrmex echinatior [31]. These
estimates are clearly higher than the mean estimates for
eusocial insects in general. One could thus suggest that
these species benefit from genotypic diversity within
colonies and that this has selected both for polyandry
and for a high recombination rate
Sherman [3] initially hypothesized an association
between recombination rate and sociality because of
effects on genomic multilocus relatedness. The point is
that the expected relatedness among full sisters (r =
0.75) in a single locus is in fact a mean between complete identity (r = 1) when the sisters received an identical allele from the mother and ‘half identity’ (r = 0.5)
when the sisters received different maternal alleles and
share only the paternal allele. Lack of recombination
could result in genetic cliques within which sisters are
unusually highly related over many loci. If there is any
kin discrimination within the societies and nepotistic
behaviour based on this discrimination, such genetic cliques could lead to nepotistic conflicts and harm the
function of the colony. Nepotistic behavior based on kin
discrimination has been doubted but some evidence for
it has been presented recently [32,33]. Whether the
effect of recombination on the distribution of pair-wise
relatednesses among colony members could affect kin
recognition and discrimination remains to be studied.

Conclusions
The data from three major groups of eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) show high recombination
rates, supporting the theoretical predictions on the positive association between sociality and recombination.
These predictions are derived from two separate lines of
reasoning. First, recombination equalizes multilocus
relatedness among brood members and prevents kin discrimination. However, kin discrimination is controversial
and there is little evidence for it (e.g. [34]) and it is
doubtful whether it could be a factor selecting for
recombination. We therefore incline to the second

Sirviö et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/95

hypothesis, according to which recombination is an
important factor generating multilocus genotypic diversity within a society [3,30] and therefore highly relevant
for the function of advanced eusocial colonies
[11,13,14]. It can be hypothesized that benefits of intracolonial genotypic diversity has selected for both polyandry and high recombination rate. Hughes et al [35]
found a negative correlation between polyandry and
polygyny in data from 241 eusocial insect species. This
suggests that polyandry and polygyny are alternative
ways to increase the genetic diversity within societies.
Consequently, we predict a negative correlation also
between recombination rate and polygyny under the
diversity hypothesis. Data from non-social species as
well as from eusocial species with different colonial
types (polygynous colonies, small colony sizes) are
required for comparative tests of the adaptive role of
recombination in advcanced eusocial insects.

Methods
Physical genome size

The size of the physical genome was determined from
neural tissue of four Vespula vulgaris and seven V. germanica individuals (males and females), collected from
nests that were dug up in Leuven in August 2009. Samples were prepared for flow cytometric genome size
determination as described in [36]. Neural tissue dissected from the head of each sampled specimen was
placed along with a single head of a female Drosophila
virilis into 1 ml of cold Galbraith buffer in a 2 ml
Kontes Dounce tissue grinder, stroked 15 times with the
“A” pestle and then filtered through 20 μm nylon mesh.
Propidium iodide was added to each sample to a final
concentration of 50 ppm and allowed to stain 40 minutes in the dark on ice. To determine the relative positions of sample and standard fluorescence peaks and
test for possible artifacts of preparation [37], similar preparations were made with at least one insect of each
species alone. The mean fluorescence of stained nuclei
in replicate samples was quantified using a Partec
Cyflow cytometer with a 100 mw green laser tuned at
532 nm. Fluorescence at >615 nm was detected by a
photomultiplier screened by a long pass filter. To ensure
that scoring included only intact nuclei free from cytoplasmic tags, counting was activated by red fluorescence,
and only nuclei with low forward and low side scatter
were included in the analysis. Samples were run to produce a total of at least 1000 nuclei under each scored
peak. DNA content was determined from co-preparations of sample and standard by multiplying the ratio of
the mean peak fluorescence of the 2C sample to the 2C
mean fluorescent peak of D. virilis, times the genome
size of the standard (328 Mbp for D. virilis, based on
co-preparations with D. melanogaster, n = 30).

DNA extraction and quality, AFLP

Our mapping material consisted of Vespula vulgaris
males collected as newly emerged adults from a single
nest which had been dug up in Sint-Truiden Belgium,
in September 2005. Samples were preserved in 99%
ethanol. Along with these males, a queen and multiple
workers were sampled for evaluation of the quality of
male DNA, and to assure the haploid origin of the
males. The quality of the DNA originating from different body parts (head, thorax, abdomen) of a few individuals was tested based on amplification using three
microsatellite primer pairs (LIST 2001 F-R, LIST 2002
F-R and LIST 2003 F-R [38]). PCR-conditions were optimized for each microsatellite primer pair as follows: For
LIST 2001 we used an annealing temperature of 52°C
and 1.5 mM MgCl2, for LIST 2002 an annealing temperature of 47°C and 1.5 mM MgCl2 and for LIST 2003
an annealing temperature of 54°C and 1.0 mM MgCl2.
The DNA from the thorax gave the best yield of PCR
product. DNA was subsequently extracted from the
thoraces of males, the mother queen and four workers
with a Qiagen DNAeasy Tissue Kit. All the samples
were tested with the microsatellite primers to confirm
haploidy and maternity. Six males were discarded due to
poor quality of DNA and one due to potential diploidy,
and we were left with 86 haploid males. These males
were further genotyped for mapping purposes using
AFLP markers (see [39] for the method). These are
commonly dominant (presence/absence) markers, which
leads to a loss of information in a diploid population,
but are fully informative in our study because we used
haploid males. Samples were prepared by using the
AFLP Core Kit for small plant genomes (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
were run on an ABI 3730 sequencer. Ten males were
used for prescreening primer pairs that produce polymorphic markers. In the end 55 different combinations
of EcoR1 and Mse1 primer pairs were used for the rest
of the males (see Figure 3). AFLP data were analyzed
using GeneMapper version 3.7 and the validity of all
peaks was evaluated by manual inspection. Segregating
markers were scored as 1 (allele present) or 0 (allele
absent). Fragment length polymorphisms were scored by
using the same system and marking the alleles as 1 (

were not clear were either rerun or marked as missing.
Linkage analysis

Variable AFLP markers in haploid males were used to
build linkage groups for V. vulgaris by using Mapmaker
version 3.0 [39]. This was done using the phase
unknown procedure as described in [11,40]. The
Kosambi mapping function was used to transform the
recombination fractions into centimorgans. This procedure reduces the map length by taking into account
possible double recombination events. In two-point analysis, the preliminary linkage groups were formed with
the thresholds of LOD score 5.0 and maximum marker
distance 30 cM, and the order of markers within linkage
groups was confirmed in multipoint analysis with the
same criteria. When several other markers were already
clustered and ordered in linkage groups, unlinked markers were added in the end parts of the groups with the
criteria LOD 3.0 and distance 35 cM by using “near"command that is based on two-point analyses [11].
Finally, some of the existing groups were combined if
the distal markers were within 35 cM distance and the
statistical threshold LOD score was at least 3.0. The
order within these newly formed groups was tested
again and the final marker linkage groups were formed
with the criteria LOD 3.0 and 35 cM. The final map
was then run through a genotyping error detection process of Mapmaker 3.0, with the error detection option
switched on with an a priori error probability of 1% to
detect the presence of multiple crossing-overs in linkage
groups. As a final check, the raw data were inspected
manually, and arranged according to the order of markers to allow visual identification of possible falsely
scored individuals and by rechecking the interpretation
of marker peaks for the loci and individuals.
