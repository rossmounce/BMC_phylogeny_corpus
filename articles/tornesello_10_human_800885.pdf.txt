Background
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV- 8) variants have been
found heterogeneously distributed among human populations living in diverse geographic regions, but their differential pathogenicity in Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)
development remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to analyze variations of HHV-8 genomes
in tumor biopsies collected before and in the course of
HIV epidemic (1971 - 2008), from patients with classic,
iatrogenic, endemic as well as epidemic KS living in
Africa, Europe, and North America.
Materials and methods
DNA samples have been extracted from cutaneous KS
lesions of 68 patients living in Africa (n=23, Cameroon,
Kenya and Uganda), Europe (n=34, Greece and Italy),
and North America (n=11). The identification and characterization of HHV-8 variants has been based on PCR
amplification followed by direct nucleotide sequencing
and phylogenetic analysis of the highly conserved ORF
26 and T0.7, the hypervariable ORF K1, as well as on
the analysis of P and M alleles of the K14.1/15 locus.
Results
Among the 23 African samples, the majority of HHV-8
ORF 26 variants clustered with the subtype R (n=12)
and B (n=5). Conversely, the viral sequences obtained
from 45 European and North European tumors
belonged mainly to subtype A/C (n=36). In general
HHV-8 and K1 variant clustering paralleled that of ORF

26 and T0.7. Genotyping of the K14.1/15 loci revealed a
large predominance of P subtype in all tumors.

Conclusions
Although the virus has genetic regions of high variability, approaching that of HIV-1 env gene, the HHV-8
subtypes remained stably distributed before and after
the AIDS epidemic. These results suggest that the
increased incidence of epidemic KS in low-incidence
countries was not related to the spreading of high
pathogenic HHV-8 variants, furthermore, suggest the
presence of other cofactors in high risk KS countries
pre-existing in pre-AIDS era [1].
