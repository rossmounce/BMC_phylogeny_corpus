Abstract
Background: The Bovinae subfamily incorporates an array of antelope, buffalo and cattle species.
All of the members of this subfamily have diverged recently. Not surprisingly, a number of
phylogenetic studies from molecular and morphological data have resulted in ambiguous trees and
relationships amongst species, especially for Yak and Bison species. A partial phylogenetic
reconstruction of 13 extant members of the Bovini tribe (Bovidae, Bovinae) from 15 complete or
partially sequenced autosomal genes is presented.
Results: We identified 3 distinct lineages after the Bovini split from the Boselaphini and
Tragelaphini tribes, which has lead to the (1) Buffalo clade (Bubalus and Syncerus species) and a more
recent divergence leading to the (2) Banteng, Gaur and Mithan and (3) Domestic cattle clades. A
fourth lineage may also exist that leads to Bison and Yak. However, there was some ambiguity as
to whether this was a divergence from the Banteng/Gaur/Mithan or the Domestic cattle clade.
From an analysis of approximately 30,000 sites that were amplified in all species 133 sites were
identified with ambiguous inheritance, in that all trees implied more than one mutation at the same
site. Closer examination of these sites has identified that they are the result of ancient
polymorphisms that have subsequently undergone lineage sorting in the Bovini tribe, of which 53
have remained polymorphic since Bos and Bison species last shared a common ancestor with Bubalus
between 5–8 million years ago (MYA).
Conclusion: Uncertainty arises in our phylogenetic reconstructions because many species in the
Bovini diverged over a short period of time. It appears that a number of sites with ambiguous
inheritance have been maintained in subsequent populations by chance (lineage sorting) and that
they have contributed to an association between Yak and Domestic cattle and an unreliable
phylogenetic reconstruction for the Bison/Yak clade. Interestingly, a number of these aberrant sites
are in coding sections of the genome and their identification may have important implications for
studying the neutral rate of mutation at nonsynonymous sites. The presence of these sites could
help account for the apparent contradiction between levels of polymorphism and effective
population size in domesticated cattle.

Background
The
Bovine
genome
project
http://
www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/ has provided
researchers with an excellent resource for bovine phylogenetic studies. Genomic resources from B. taurus should
have some transferability among a number of closely
related bovids due to the likely divergence ages of the
Bovidae [1]. To date several studies have suggested that
primers designed in one species have a relatively high rate
of PCR success in other families from the suborder Ruminantia [2,3]. Therefore, sequencing exonic regions should
have a high rate of success within the Bovini tribe even
from primers designed from the B. taurus genome.
Bovinae subfamily relationships and phylogenetic
reconstruction
The Bovidae family consists of some of the most culturally
and economically important species on the planet. Of the
major representatives of the family Bovidae arguably the
most important would be the subfamily Bovinae, which is
divided into three main tribes (Table 1); the first two representatives of the Bovinae, the tribes Tragelaphini and
Boselaphini, comprise spiral, four-horned and much of
the large ox-like antelope [1]. Representatives of these
tribes are often hunted for meat and hide, and in the case
of Eland have been occasionally used to work in harness.
The Bovini tribe comprises all of the major domestic
bovine species, including a number of wild species, some
of which are endangered or threatened with extinction
[1,4-6]. The first divergence within the Bovini occurred
between 5–10 million years ago (MYA) with the splitting
of the buffalo or the subtribe Bubalina (Bubalus and Syncerus spp.) from the nonbuffalo or the subtribe Bovina
(Bos and Bison spp.) [1,7-12]. These two subtribes consistently resolve themselves as dichotomous groups, and
show no evidence of producing viable hybrid offspring
[1,6,9,13,14]. Recently molecular methods have estimated the Bovina Bubalina split at approximately 14 MYA
[15]. However, the earliest Bovini fossils found south of
the Himalayas in India and Pakistan have been dated at <
9 MYA [16]. Phenotypic and stable carbon and oxygen
isotope analysis suggest that these Bovini representatives
were behaviourally and ecologically intermediate to modern Bovini and their progenitors the Bosephalini [17].
These early examples of the Bovini appeared to become
more adapted to drier more open habitats and were only
beginning to develop affinities with grazing open grass-

lands and obligate drinking patterns [17]. In addition
early Bovini fossils do not exist in nearby regions like
Afghanistan and Iran suggesting that these early Bovini
were restricted to the open forests of India and Pakistan
until < 7 MYA when the earliest Bovini fossils begin to
appear in Africa, Asia and Europe, respectively. This
expansion coincides with a changing climate and expansion of C4 dominated grasslands [16-18]. Hence estimates
of the Bovinae Bubalina split > 10 MYA are most likely
overestimates and a more realistic estimate is < 10 MYA.
Within the Bovina subtribe, divergence of the remaining
species also occurred recently, with a very sudden radiation in the early Pleistocene ~2 MYA and as a result speciation has not been complete, with many members of the
tribe producing viable hybrid offspring or infertile offspring in bulls that may have fertility restored by repeated
backcrossing [1,4-6,19]. The dramatic range expansion of
domestic cattle has resulted in an increased threat of introgression by domestic cattle DNA into the genomes of
many wild populations, either intentionally or accidentally [11,20], all of which may confuse phylogenetic relationships.
Another confounding factor when reconstructing phylogenies may arise if a rapidly evolving clade's most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) was highly polymorphic, as
this may result in the random assortment of genetic variation in different lineages and aberrant modes of inheritance for certain polymorphisms. This phenomenon is
known as lineage sorting, and it has been known to cause
random associations among species, which may further
confuse derived taxonomic relationships [21].
Recently phylogenetic reconstruction using mitochondrial lineages has led to clearer Bovina phylogenies
[6,11,15]. However, because mitochondrial DNA is
maternally inherited, relationships driven by male mediated introgression may be missed. This finding was confirmed with Y-chromosomal phylogenies identifying
close relationships between Wisent and North American
bison, while mitochondrial phylogenies identify an association between Bos taurus and Wisent [11]. More recently
the Kouprey and Banteng were shown to be both valid
species despite the introgression of the Kouprey mitochondrial genome in Cambodian Banteng [15]. Thus,
some improvements have been made regarding the phylogenetic relationships of the Bovinae subtribe, but there is

still concern over the accuracy of many trees due to low
confidence values and contrasting results from different
data and phylogenetic methods. This is especially evident
when considering the position of the Wisent in the bovine
phylogeny and the time of divergence for these species.
Despite concerns over the level of variation within nuclear
gene sequences at the species level in the Bovini [22,23],
by examining a number of nuclear genes (exons and
flanking noncoding regions) we should identify enough
genetic variation to differentiate between species, populations or breeds. Also by examining variation within genes
and exons in closely related species, one can analyse haplotypes for similarity among species over short (variation
per amplicon) and large distances (variation between
exons and genes). The presence of identical, long haplotypes in different species may be evidence of recent introgression as recombination is likely to break up linked
haplotypes after a number of generations. Alternatively,
associations generated by the random assortment of polymorphic alleles should not create similar patterns of
linked haplotypes over any significant distance. Therefore,
lineage sorting and introgression can be differentiated by
the analysis of haplotype similarity and sequence variation in genomic DNA between species.
The presence of alleles undergoing lineage sorting in the
coding regions of the genome are of interest as their presence is most likely due to polymorphisms in a common
ancestor that were sorted in a fashion that is inconsistent
with the inferred phylogeny. In some cases these polymorphisms can persist for generations, even past the lifespan
of a species. The fact that many of these polymorphisms
do not appear to be linked over any large distances suggests they have been independently assorted and that they
are ancient in origin and therefore not introduced by
recent introgression. If overdominance, selection or
demographic factors, like the fixation of slightly deleterious alleles in small populations, have been responsible
for the assortment of these ancient polymorphisms they
must have an effect on phenotype and should therefore
show high dN/dS ratios. Therefore, examining estimates
of dN/dS at these sites should help infer whether they are
neutral or nearly neutral and if so, whether they are useful
for determining the neutral rate of mutation in the Bovini.
In this paper we attempt to reconstruct phylogenies
between 14 extant representatives of the Bovinae subfamily. We examined 84 autosomal gene sequences, from
15 different genes, sampled over 4 Bovine chromosomes.
Neighbour joining trees and the neutral substitution rate
per site at synonymous (dS) and noncoding (dI) regions
are presented for all autosomal sequences in an effort to
identify relationships and divergence times between spe-

cies, and test for evidence of introgression or lineage sorting.

Results
Sequencing
In total 84 amplicons from 15 genes were sequenced
across 14 representatives of the Bovinae subfamily,
including members of the Bovini and Tragelaphini tribes,
which we used to infer the sequence from the most recent
common ancestor (see Methods). From the 84 amplicons
83 amplified in at least one sample. The relative proportions from the amplicons that successfully amplified in
each species were particularly high, ranging from 0.76 in
Eland to 0.95 in Gaur (additional file 1). Surprisingly
some of the wild relatives showed better amplification
(Gaur, Yak, Mithan, Banteng and Bison) than different
breeds of B. taurus (Holstein and Tuli). All sequences were
submitted to Genbank and their primers and accession
numbers are also available in additional file 1.
Genetic distances, divergence times and phylogenetic
reconstruction
Both dI and dS are generally considered neutral substitutions and are often used for discriminating between phylogenetic lineages. Table 2 shows pairwise comparisons for
dI and dS between 15 Bovinae representatives, lower and
upper diagonal respectively. The minimum dI is within
breeds of Indian river buffalo, followed by breeds of
Domestic cow. The largest dI is between species like Eland
and the Domestic cow (Table 2, lower diagonal). Similarly, the minimum dS is found between breeds, and the
maximum dS is between Eland and other members of the
Bovidae, such as Bison, Gaur, Mithan, and Domestic cow,
respectively (Table 2, upper diagonal). Interestingly, dS is
often greater than dI. Subramanian and Kumar [24] suggest that an elevation in GC content at synonymous sites
may be responsible for this phenomenon.

Table 3 presents the divergence times estimated from the
pairwise comparisons between all major lineages and
Hereford (B. taurus) using Nei's D (equation 5, Methods).
Nei has shown that genetic distance (D) is directly related
to divergence time. However, the method may be susceptible to inaccurate estimates given the incorrect mutation
rate. As a result we also estimated divergence times using
a relaxed molecular clock using calibration points based
on best estimates of divergence times in the fossil record
for Bison and Yak (2.0 and 1.7 MYA, respectively). Members of the Bovini subtribe appear to have diverged from
B. taurus approximately 2–3 MYA. The Bubalina subtribe
has diverged from B. taurus some 5–9 MYA, while Eland
appears to have diverged from the Domestic cow some 8–
14 MYA. The breeds of B. taurus show some interesting
results with African cattle (Tuli) seeming to have diverged
~100,000–200,000 years ago, which may be possible if

Species: (Anc: Ancient, Ban: Banteng, Bis: Bison, BubB & BubC: Asian water buffalo, Ela: Eland, Gau: Gaur, Her: Hereford, Ind & Mur: Indian water
buffalo, Mit: Mithan, Hol: Holstein, Syn: African buffalo, Tul: Tuli, and Yak)

African and European cattle have in fact been separately
domesticated, or if Tuli contains genes originating in B.
indicus. However, as more polymorphism has been
detected within Holstein than between Hereford and Holstein, there has been some difficulty estimating divergence
times between these two closely related breeds, which
were most likely separated only a few hundred years ago.
No significant differences were detected between overall
base frequencies (A, T, C and G) for any member of the
Bovini tribe, and substitution rates between Ancestral and
Eland sequences with all members of the Bovini appear to
be largely the same. A small bias was detected for transition (ti) to transversion (tv) substitutions, with a ratio of
ti/tv = 2.1 (results not shown). Therefore, Kimura's two
parameter model should be appropriate for phylogenetic
reconstruction. However, the relatively small genetic distances detected (dS and dI < 0.05) suggest that the p-distances calculated in table 2 should also be accurate despite
the transition bias [25].
Figure 1 shows a monophyletic neighbour joining tree,
deduced using Kimura's two parameter model from an

alignment of ~30,000 bases and 1,800 variable sites
(additional file 2). The placement of the inferred ancestral
sequence is not surprising and may indicate its accuracy.
Strong support was detected for a bifurcation between
representatives of the Bovina and Bubalina subtribes.
Within the Bubalina subtribe there is strong support for
separation of the Syncerus and Bubalus genera. Within the
water buffalo strong stratification is also apparent. Surprisingly, one of the river buffalo (BubB) has a closer relationship to swamp buffalo (BubC) than to other members
of the same species, the separation between buffalo may
be associated with geographic patterns as two of our buffalo samples (Ind and Mur) originated from India, while
the swamp buffalo are generally restricted to East Asia and
are known to hybridise with river buffalo. Within the
Bovina subtribe a distinct separation between Bison, Yak
and Domestic cattle with the cattle of Indochina (Gaur/
Mithan/Banteng) was found. However, the nodes leading
to a Bison/Yak/Domestic cattle clade show less support
with the Yak/Domestic cattle clade showing less than 60%
support by bootstrap resampling. The lack of certainty in
the tree is not surprising given the short branch lengths
leading to the divergences among Domestic cattle-Yak-

which we defined as any site that must have arisen due to
a double mutation or lineage sorting of an ancient polymorphism (see Methods). We identified 133 aberrant
sites, of which 111 were not tree specific and were aberrant in all trees leaving 22 informative sites. From the 111
non-tree specific aberrant sites 53 ancient sites are segregating within both the Bovina and Bubalina lineages. A
legend to all aberrant sites, their position and the relative
age (i.e. approximately how long they have been segregating in the clade) is provided in additional file 3.

Bison-Banteng-Mithan/Gaur. Previous work has placed
the lineage leading to Bison and Yak as a separate group,
which diverged from the Banteng/Gaur/Mithan clade
[6,11], and more recently as a divergence from the B. taurus branch [15].
Aberrant sites
To detect if recent gene flow or ancient polymorphisms
were responsible for differences between our and other
recently published phylogenies, we analysed all of the segregating sites from figure 1 for the presence of anomalies.
We reconstructed a number of phylogenetic trees to iden-

To examine these aberrant sites in more detail we have
analysed a number of phylogenetic trees that have been
suggested due to the poor bootstrapping confidence in figure 1, and trees presented in recent work by Verkaar et al
and Hassanin and Ropiquet [6,11]. The phylogenetic tree
that generates the smallest number of anomalies (125)
places Yak off the lineage leading to Domestic cattle and
Bison off the lineage leading to the Indochinese cattle ((B.
taurus, Yak), (Bison, Indochinese cattle)); however, similar numbers (126) are also seen for the tree that places
Bison and Yak as a lineage of the Indochinese clade ((B.
taurus), ((Yak, Bison) Indochinese cattle)), which is only
worse by one aberrant site. Therefore, some evidence
exists for the trees recently proposed by Hassanin and
Ropiquet [6] and Verkaar et al. [11]. However, it appears
that a number of aberrant sites are generating an association between Yak and Domestic cattle, which has confounded the phylogenetic reconstruction. Removing all
aberrant sites from the analysis leaves fewer substitutions
to accurately estimate genetic distances between members
of the Bovina subtribe and the tree is less certain (data not
shown).
Introgression and ancient polymorphism
To identify the source of the aberrant substitutions within
the Bovini tribe, we compared all variable sites in the
alignment to find sites shared with B. taurus at normal and
aberrant positions (Table 4). We examined these positions within Gaur, Mithan, Banteng, Bison and Yak for
similarities to Domestic cattle over extended haplotypes
resolved from aberrant and all variable sites. We found

that Yak shares the largest number of alleles in common
with Domestic cattle for all variable and aberrant sites
(Table 4). Perhaps the most interesting finding is the high
number of identical haplotypes Yak and Domestic cattle
share over haplotypes resolved from the aberrant sites per
amplicon (Table 4, Table 5). When compared to haplotypes resolved from the all variable sites, Yak and Domestic cattle share the largest number in common. However,
there are relatively few haplotypes that are similar for any
of the species (Gaur, Mithan, Banteng, Bison and Yak) and
Domestic cattle, and this is probably a function of the species specific mutations that have accumulated per amplicon since divergence from the MRCA.
To determine if the high proportion of haplotypes,
resolved from aberrant sites, shared between Yak and
Domestic cattle may be evidence of recent introgression,
we looked for extended haplotypes that are shared
between species. Thus, the extent of linkage between
neighbouring amplicons and genes on the same chromosome was examined. Table 5 shows the B. taurus haplotype per amplicon from all aberrant sites and the species
that share the same haplotype. A number of haplotypes
are shared with all species. Many of the haplotypes that
are based on one aberrant site (PIT1_e1) may be similar
by chance and therefore may not be very informative.
However, by extending haplotypes to adjacent exons and
genes more power to detect recent hybridisation should
be available. But as haplotypes are extended to closely
linked amplicons or neighbouring genes on the same
chromosome this similarity rapidly disappears (Table 5).
In a further attempt to identify recent introgression,
sequence diversity estimates were examined between
neighbouring amplicons and genes. Figure 2 shows plots
of sequence divergence at noncoding sites (dI) for Hereford vs Yak (A), Hereford vs Holstein (B) and Yak vs Gaur
(C). A similar pattern is seen to that described in table 5.
A number of amplicons show similar amounts of
sequence divergence between Hereford vs Yak as is seen
between Hereford vs Holstein (NRIP1 and PIT1). However, genetic diversity at closely linked amplicons remains
low between breeds of B. taurus for closely spaced genes
on chromosome 1 (PIT1, ITGB5) and chromosome 2
(GMEB1 and EGF), which suggests that these animals
have recently shared a common ancestor. In contrast,
comparisons for Domestic cattle vs Yak, and Yak vs Gaur
(Figure 2A and 2C, respectively) rarely show low sequence
diversity over similar linked regions, and thus, genetic
associations are most likely not the result of recent introgression.
An examination of the river and swamp buffalo samples
from Southeast Asia (BubB and BubC) has identified large
segments of chromosome 1 and 2 that are identical. Thus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/177

BubB has a closer relationship to swamp buffalo (BubC)
than to other members of river buffalo that originate from
India, which may suggest some level of introgression in
these two samples as large portions of chromosomes 1
and 2 in BubB appear to be of swamp buffalo origin (Figure 3).
Classifying aberrant sites: age and role of selection
A number of aberrant sites were identified that were
inconsistent with any of the phylogenetic trees suggested
from either molecular or morphological characteristics. In
total 33 aberrant sites occurred in coding regions, of
which 6 are Ka and 27 are Ks from 11,563 synonymous
and 3,482 nonsynonymous sites, which resulted in a dN/
dS ratio of 0.065. From the 33 aberrant sites 10 appear to
be polymorphic since the common ancestor with buffalo,
while the remaining 23 would have been polymorphic in
the common ancestor of the Bos and Bison genera. Of the
10 ancient polymorphisms 3 are Ka and 7 are Ks. Therefore these 10 ancient polymorphisms were maintained for
millions of years. They must have been polymorphic in
the MRCA to the Bovina and Bubalina subtribes some 5–
8 MYA and appear to have persisted to at least the divergence of the Bovina subtribe around 2 MYA. The small
values estimated for the dN/dS ratios calculated suggest
that these polymorphisms may have been neutral.

Discussion
Sequencing
A high proportion of successful amplification was
achieved for all species within the Bovinae subfamily
from primers designed using the Bos taurus genome
despite divergence times of 8–14 MY (Taurotragus oryx).
The high rate of amplification between species should
facilitate further population genetic studies in the Bovini
and possibly other ruminant subfamilies.
Bovine phylogeny reconstruction, mutation and
substitution
Within the Bovini, difficulties resolving interspecific relationships arose when comparing pairwise differences
between species for dI and dS with those deduced from
the neighbour joining algorithm. In general the phylogenetic reconstruction created using Kimura's two parameter
method and the neighbour joining algorithm agreed with
the p-distances calculated for dI and dS in table 2, with
strong separation between Bubalina and Bovina subtribes
and strong support for separation of Bubalus and Syncerus
genera, confirming previous studies from molecular data
[6,11,26]. Within the Bubalus there appears to be a separation between swamp and river buffalo and a possible separation within river buffalo that may be due to due to
geographic patterns and/or introgression of swamp and
river buffalo. The phylogenetic tree we identified does not
agree with some of the individual genetic distances within

the Bovina. For instance, the genetic distance between Yak
and Bison for dI and dS both imply that the species are
most likely a monophyletic group that could either be
grouped with the B. taurus lineage or the lineage leading
to the cattle from Indochina (Gaur/Mithan/Banteng) but
the tree places them as separate divergences from the lineage leading to B. taurus. This disparity may be the result
of more complicated methods of deducing genetic distance, like the Kimura two parameter model, inflating variances over simpler methods, such as the p-distances,
thereby increasing the chance of topographical errors
[25]. Low bootstrapping levels may be the result of low
genetic differentiation between these three lineages and
the presence of aberrant polymorphisms, confusing phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Examining a number of manually inferred trees that
attempt to minimise the number of aberrant polymorphisms identified a tree that has Bison as a divergence
from the Gaur/Mithan/Banteng lineage and Yak as a
divergence of the B. taurus clade. But this relationship
does not seem logical considering the close relationship
identified between Bison and Yak for dS and dI distances.
Therefore, the large number of aberrant sites that Yak
shares with Hereford may confuse the phylogenetic reconstruction, as the neighbour joining algorithm deals with
these aberrant polymorphisms in the same manner as all
other polymorphisms.

Removing aberrant polymorphisms from the analysis
identified a phylogenetic relationship in which all members of the Bovina appear to have diverged roughly at the
same time in a star like phylogeny. However, bootstrap
values were even lower than those deduced from the
entire dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstructing
phylogenies from a group of species that have undergone
rapid genetic isolation. Of course, low bootstrap values
are expected for a star-like phylogeny.
All trees show a close association between members of the
Bovina subtribe, with all major lineages diverging very
rapidly some 1–3 million years ago, which appears to be
associated with climatic oscillations during the late Pleistocene [27,28]. All trees show that Bison and Yak are single or multiple divergences from the clade leading to B.
taurus, which disagrees with previous work by Verkaar et
al [11] and Hassanin and Ropiquet [6] that place Bison
and Yak as a single divergence from the Indochinese cattle. More recently Hassanin and Ropiquet [15] show
Bison and Yak as a single divergence from the lineage
leading to B. taurus. However, these studies were typically
based only on one or two thousand nucleotide characters
or from a small number of genetic markers and therefore,
each tree typically had low bootstrapping values or
resulted in variations to this tree when differing methods
or maternally, paternally or bi-parentally inherited data
are used, suggesting that some of these relationships are
still contentious. The phylogenetic reconstruction pre-

sented above is based on over 29,000 bi-parentally inherited nucleotide characters and should have more power to
resolve some of the more confusing intergenic relationships within the Bovini.
The association identified between Bison, Yak and B. taurus may also explain the similarity seen between Wisent
and B. taurus. Although, no Wisent sample was represented in our study, Verkaar et al [11] and Hassanin and
Ropiquet [6] have recently hypothesised that as a result of
repeated male mitigated introgression of American bison
populations into Eurasian cattle like populations lead to a
new species (Wisent), which comprises the phenotype,
autosomal genes and Y-chromosome of American bison
and the mitochondrial genome from the maternal ancestor (B. taurus like species) [11]. Thus, the constant hybridisation by the progenitors of Bison and B. taurus may have
had a large impact on the genomes of both species.
Surprisingly, one of the Bubalus bubalis (river buffalo)
samples was more closely related to the Bubalis carabenensis (swamp buffalo) than to other river buffalo. This relationship was puzzling, as previous studies have found that
the two subspecies are genetically distinct, have different
chromosome numbers and their divergence time has been
estimated tens of thousands to over one million years
[29,30]. However, despite the obvious phenotypic and
genetic differences, the two subspecies are known to
hybridise, especially in South East Asia where a hybrid
zone for buffalo may exist [30,31]. Also in some instances
animals can show the phenotype of the swamp buffalo
but have the chromosomal and genetic make up of the
river buffalo, as is the case for animals in Sri Lanka [32].

Therefore, the phylogenetic reconstruction may have been
confused due to an analysis of a hybrid river buffalo
(BubB) that has large regions of chromosome 1 and 2 that
apparently originated from swamp buffalo. Alternatively,
the phenotypic and karyoptypic plasticity shown within
water buffalo may indicate that genetic differences
between river and swamp buffalo could all be within species polymorphism.
Aberrant sites, introgression and ancient polymorphism
One of the most astonishing features of the phylogenetic
reconstruction was the identification of a large number of
aberrant sites that did not fit any known phylogenetic
reconstructions. A number of explanations may account
for these phylogenetic aberrations, such as double mutations, introgressive hybridisation and lineage sorting. The
probability of aberrant sites as a result of double mutations can be calculated as follows:

(1 − μ )t

(1)

which is the probability of no mutation in one lineage
with mutation rate μ over t generations. Therefore, the
probability of mutation in one lineage is

1 − (1 − μ )

t

(2)

Thus the probability that the same site mutates in two different lineages is

(

)

⎡ 1 − (1 − μ )t ⎤

⎥
⎣
⎦

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:177

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/177

And the expected number of double mutations across n
sites is

(

n ⎡ 1 − (1 − μ )
⎢
⎣

t

) ⎤⎦⎥

2

(4)

The probability that both mutations result in the same
base is approximately 1/3. Hence the expected number of
double mutations in two lineages is
t
n *1 / 3 * ⎡1 − ( 1 − μ ) ⎤
⎢
⎥
⎣
⎦

2

(5)

Therefore, even if t is set to 10 million years as a conservative estimate for the divergence of B. taurus and B. bubalis
and n = 30,000 then for equation 5 one would expect
around 2 bases to have undergone a double mutation
resulting in the same derived allele from the ~30,000
bases sequenced in each lineage since the divergence of B.
taurus and B. bubalus from a common ancestor some 10
MYA. The time of divergence is somewhat less within the
Bovini but there are more than 2 lineages. However, the
likelihood of a mutation affecting the exact same base
~130 times in our dataset is highly improbable, so in general, most abnormalities must be evidence of lineage sorting or introgressive hybridisation and not double
mutations.
Also a high proportion (40%) of aberrant sites were identified as sites that were deemed to be polymorphic in
Bubalina and Bovina subtribes. Members of these two
subtribes separated 5–8 MYA and no hybridisation has
ever been documented between any members of these
two subtribes [1]. Therefore, these aberrant sites cannot
have arisen due to recent hybridisation events. If 40% of
the aberrant sites are due to polymorphisms that existed
in the common ancestor at Bubalina and Bovina, it seems
likely that other polymorphisms in the common ancestor
of Bovina will also have contributed to the other 60% of
aberrant sites. However, recent introgression might have
also contributed, as the incomplete speciation of the tribe
has resulted in many viable hybrid offspring from various
crossings [1].
The presence of identical haplotypes between Bovina representatives and Domestic cattle may also be a result of
ancient geneflow between animals before reproductive
isolation was achieved, but in essence this hypothesis
would virtually be identical to the presence of ancestral
polymorphisms. Another possibility for this finding may
also be explained by hybridisation between another
closely related species. A previous study from the labs of
University Station in Texas also found an anomalous association between Yak and Taurine cattle, due to an animal
descending from a B. indicus cow [5,9,11]. The fact that a

Bos indicus sample was not included in the data set, meant
tests could not determine if some of the aberrant sites in
our sample were due to gene flow between B. grunniens
and B. indicus and this will need to be investigated further.
The high degree of sequence similarity detected between
Yak and Domestic cattle at all variable sites in the alignment, aberrant sites and over extended haplotypes suggests that hybridisation may have also occurred between
these two species (Table 4). Yak-taurine hybrids are
reported in China and Mongolia where their altitudinal
ranges intersect [1]. However, no evidence of linked haplotypes at aberrant sites between neighbouring genes or
on very small scales between exons within the same gene
was detected (Table 5). Genes were selected from tightly
linked regions of the B. taurus genome and the majority of
amplicons within genes were only separated by 1–20 kilobases. No information on the genetic distance between
genes has been collected but, the small physical distances
between amplicons on the same gene suggest the recombination rate between many of these amplicons would be
far below 1% per generation. The fact that all animals
rarely share haplotypes with B. taurus between neighbouring amplicons and genes suggests that there is no evidence
of linked haplotypes. This finding is also reflected in plots
of sequence diversity between Yak and Domestic cattle
with low sequence diversity detected for some amplicons
but consistently larger estimates found for neighbouring
amplicons from the same gene (Figure 2A). Thus recent
introgression has not played a large role in the presence of
these aberrant sites within the Bovina and they may be
due to homologous polymorphisms that existed in the
MRCA that have undergone lineage sorting in subsequent
generations. However, the lack of information on the
genetic ancestry for all of our animals may require some
caution when interpreting some of our results.
Ancestral polymorphisms that have undergone lineage
sorting in the Bovini would have required an ancestral
species with an extremely large population size that was
very polymorphic. Palaeontological evidence generally
agrees with this assumption, with the earliest fossil for the
Bovini tribe found in Asia ~8 MYA, with evidence of populations existing solely in Pakistan and India, south of the
Himalayas. It was not until about 6–7 MYA that the Himalayas began increasing in size and areas of desert were
becoming seasonally humid facilitating wide dispersal of
Bovini ancestors [6]. Thus the 52 aberrant sites identified
in the Bubalina and Bovina subtribes most likely originate
in this once large restricted and panmictic population.
The fact that each allele is found in the Bubalina and
Bovina suggest that the polymorphisms must have
remained segregating in both groups for what would
appear to be ~8 million years. The remaining aberrant
sites appear to have arisen in the independent ancestors of

Page 11 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:177

the Bovina, which suggests that the respective population
sizes for these populations must have also been very large.
These sites may have persisted for at least 2 million years,
which is the approximate divergence time for the major
Bovina lineages from molecular and palaeontological
data [6,11,27,28,33,34]. The finding that some polymorphisms in the Bovini have been segregating for so long is
completely novel. These ancestral polymorphisms have
existed for very long periods and been maintained as neutral or overdominant polymorphisms. The low dN/dS
among these polymorphisms suggest that they are neutral
because it is unlikely the synonymous polymorphisms
show overdominance.
Knowledge of polymorphisms segregating in humans and
other primates has been known for some time with examples of polymorphisms in ABO, MN and Lewis blood
groups [35], although it was not known whether these
polymorphisms were the result of the same genetic variations. Recently, work on the MHC has identified a number
of polymorphisms that are trans-specific and have existed
in humans and other primates for millions of years
[36,37]. However, the majority of these genes are involved
with disease resistance and the maintenance of polymorphism has been hypothesised to exist due to balancing
selection. To our knowledge this is one of the only examples where polymorphisms at the same alleles have been
maintained for such long periods outside of the MHC or
involving genes that are responsible for disease resistance.
The difficulties in phylogenetic reconstruction caused by
lineage sorting in closely related species have previously
been reported for neutral genetic markers and mitochondrial control regions [11,22,38]. Because the majority of
phylogenetic studies typically only involve a few genetic
markers or concentrate on specific regions of the mitochondrial genome the exact rate of alleles undergoing lineage sorting is unknown, especially for nuclear genes, but
the maintenance of polymorphic sites beyond the lifespan
of a species is expected to be rare [39]. Therefore, the presence of alleles undergoing lineage sorting in coding
regions of the bovine genome should be extremely scarce.
However, a relatively large number of these aberrant sites
were detected within genomic coding regions of the
Bovini tribe. These substitutions most likely would have
been neutral or nearly neutral in the ancestral population
from which they were derived, and thus the probability of
their loss and fixation in future lineages is governed by the
neutral theory of molecular evolution [40]. By sequencing
a large number of close relatives researchers should be
able to identify a high number of these aberrant sites and
infer the dN/dS rate among neutral mutations.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a partial phylogenetic reconstruction of the
Bovinae subfamily has identified three distinct lineages

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/177

that have arisen after the Bovini split from the Bosephalaphini and the Tragelaphini tribes. Within the Bovini tribe
two subtribes the Bubalina and Bovina were resolved,
which we estimate diverged approximately 5–8 MYA.
About 2–3 MYA the Bovina subtribe was still a single
widespread species. It then appears that the Bovina split
into 3 major groups: Domestic cattle, Bison/Yak and the
Indochinese cattle or Gaur/Mithan and Banteng and this
occurred very rapidly. Polymorphisms in the ancestral
species continued to segregate for long periods of time,
which has lead to some alleles undergoing lineage sorting.
The lineage sorting we have detected appears to have confused the algorithms and tree drawing programs used for
this analysis, and the apparent star like phylogeny will
most likely continue to confuse phylogenetic reconstructions. The majority of these sites appear to be neutral and
must have arose in a polymorphic ancestor and continued
to segregate within species for millions of years. The age
and maintenance of these ancestral polymorphisms in
coding regions may be useful for studying the neutral rate
of evolution and could also help explain the discrepancies
between effective population size and levels of polymorphism in domesticated cattle.

Methods
Gene candidates
Candidate genes were selected for sequencing using a priori knowledge of the gene's position in relation to suspected milk QTL on chromosomes 1, 2, 4 and 9. In
addition MacEachern et al. have compared a large number
of genes and EST for evidence of higher than average rates
of molecular evolution between Bos taurus, Homo sapiens
and Bos indicus [41,42]. Genes showing higher than average rates of molecular evolution between these species
may be of evolutionary importance and are good candidates to study molecular evolution. This potential list of
genes was further reduced by selecting genes that might
have a role in milk production from examination of the
most recent annotation of the human genome. Table 6
summarises the genes, descriptions and their chromosomal location from the latest cattle genomic resources.
Animals and DNA extraction
Exonic and intronic sequence was amplified from 15
genes in at least 1 individual from genomic DNA of the
following breeds and species of cattle: Holstein (B. taurus), Tuli (B. taurus), Hereford (B. taurus), Banteng (B.
javanicus), Gaur (B. gaurus), Yak (B. grunniens), Mithan (B.
frontalis), Bison (Bison bison), Murrah buffalo (Bubalus
bubalis), a nondescript breed of Indian River buffalo
(Bubalus bubalis), East Asian River buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), a nondescript breed of Swamp buffalo (Bubalus carabanesis), Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffar) and Eland
(Taurotragus oryx). For each animal genomic DNA was
extracted from whole blood, semen or from tissue. Additional file 4 identifies the animals used in this study, their

Primer design and optimisation
Bos taurus coding sequence was extracted where available
from Entrez at the NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Entrez/. In the absence of B. taurus coding sequence Homo
sapiens sequence was obtained and a reciprocal best hit
algorithm (RBH) [43] was used to obtain the best orthologous cattle sequence from a large propriety in-house
expressed sequence database (EST). An automated computer pipeline was used to identify and design primers for
every exon from each candidate gene. Our program added
forward and reverse M13 tails to all primer pairs in an
effort to increase the throughput of the sequencing reactions [44]. Where possible primer pairs were designed to
amplify 1000 base pair (bp) fragments. Amplicons typically contained 1 exon and a few hundred bp of intronic
sequence.

All primer sets were optimised using a number of samples
from the Bovidae. If optimisation failed to amplify any
products a second primer pair was trialled. If no improvement was recorded, the amplicon was dropped from the
analysis. A complete list of primers for all exons, a summary of PCR success in each species and Genbank accession numbers are available in additional file 4. Amplicons
where all species amplified are available as a multiple
alignment spanning the exon and flanking intronic
sequences. This alignment was used extensively for phylogenetic reconstruction and is presented in additional file

Sequencing was completed using the Big Dye Terminator
v 3.1 cycle sequencing kit on an ABI 3700 DNA Analyser
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's
instructions for the sense and antisense strands. GeneScan
version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems) was used to analyse the
data collected from each capillary. Seqscape V. 2.5
(Applied Biosystems) was used to analyse chromatograms
and resolve any potential heterozygous sequences. In total
over 6,000 sequencing reactions were performed, analysed and exported as FASTA sequence files.
Analysis
Consensus sequence generation
Sense and antisense reads were aligned using CLUSTALW
[45] and used to create a consensus sequence for the analysis using an automated computer program. Consensus
sequences for each amplicon were created from multiple
alignments of sense and antisense reads for each species
and breed. Choosing the most common residue at each
point in the alignment creates the consensus, if one of two
alleles does not occur at a frequency of 0.7 or higher, the
ambiguous character (N) is selected, which masks polymorphisms within species and may result in a conservative estimate of the number of sites undergoing lineage
sorting.

PCR and sequencing conditions
For all primer pairs, PCR was performed in a 96 well plate
format with 20 ul reactions. Each reaction contained 10–

Ancient sequence generation
Alignments for each genomic fragment typically contained sequences representing the majority of the extant
members of the tribe Bovini (Bovidae, Bovinae) and outgroup representatives from the tribes Tragelaphini (Bovidae, Bovinae) and Hominini (Hominidae, Ponginae).
These alignments were used to create an ancient nucleotide sequence, which should represent the common
ancestor of the Bovini tribe.

A computer program was developed to infer the ancestral
state of each base between the two lineages leading to the
two main subtribes of the Bovini, Bovina and Bubalina.
The first subtribe Bovina includes all of the species from
the genera Bos (cattle) and Bison (bisons) and the second
subtribe Bubalina incorporates all of the species from the
genera Bubalus (Asian buffalo) and Syncerus (African buffalo) (Table 1). The ancestral sequence for these two subtribes was inferred using Eland (Tragelaphini) and
Human (Hominini) as outgroups. Wherever differences
were detected between the two subtribes of Bovini the
ancestral allele was inferred as the base that was shared
between one of the subtribes and one of the outgroup species, the mutant or derived allele was assumed to be the
unique allele with no other representatives in the phylogeny. Where both subtribes and the outgroup species had
unique alleles the ancestral sequence was represented as
an ambiguity character (N). Therefore, if j = a given position in the multiple alignment and Bv = Bovina subtribe,
Bb = Bubalina subtribe, To = Eland, Hs = Human, An =
Ancestral species and N = unknown base. Then if Bv(j) =
Bb(j) An(j) = Bv(j), otherwise if Bv(j) ≠ Bb(j) and Bt(j) =
Hs(j) or To(j) An(j) = Bt(j), or if Bb(j) = Hs(j) or To(j)
An(j) = Bb(j), else if Hs(j) = To(j) An(j) = To(j); otherwise
An(j) = N, where An(j) = the base at position j in the
ancestral species.
For each amplicon ancestral sequences were aligned with
consensus sequences from each member of the Bovini
tribe. Large indels and ambiguous characters were
removed manually from the alignment. Computer modules were written to undertake pairwise comparisons
between all samples for the number of intronic substitutions per site (dI) and (non)synonymous substitutions
per site (dN & dS). Exonic sequences and the corresponding open reading frame (ORF) were identified by crossreferencing alignments from known Bovine and Human
protein coding genes [41]. All information per amplicon
was summed up per gene and these values were used to
estimate genetic distances between our samples.
Genetic distance, tree reconstruction and divergence times
Coding and noncoding regions were analysed separately
for genetic distance calculations and phylogeny reconstruction. Base frequencies, substitution rates, transitions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/177

transversions and genetic distances using an uncorrected
p-distance were calculated for all sequences. Approximate
divergence times (TN) were inferred using Nei's D from
the intronic data for all pairwise comparisons with Hereford [25].

D = e −2tμ

(6)

where t = the divergence time in years, μ = the mutation
rate 2.2 × 10-9 per year for mammals [46] and D is the
genetic distance between species and breeds corrected for
the level of Hereford polymorphism, which we assume is
roughly similar to the levels of polymorphism in the common ancestor. So equation 5 should give estimates of the
divergence times between species and breeds if dI is constant [46]. Due to TN's reliance on an accurate mutation
rate a second estimate for the time divergence was calculated (TC) was estimated using calibration points from the
best estimates of divergence from fossil record for two
nodes in the phylogeny. In the test we use Bison and Yak
and the average divergence dates of 2.0 and 1.7 MY,
respectively to calibrate the dates [16,47,48]. Phylogenetic
trees were generated using the neighbour joining algorithm and Kimura's two-parameter distance using nonparametric bootstrapping with 5,000 replicates from the
total (noncoding and coding) dataset in the MEGA4 package [25].
Identifying sites with abnormal inheritance in the Bovini
A computer program was generated to identify sites
within introns and exons that differed from the proposed
molecular phylogeny. The program identified aberrant
sites that were either the result of a double mutation,
recent gene flow between species or ancient polymorphisms. Hence, a site is aberrant under a given phylogenetic tree if the same mutation occurred twice or more on
at least two different branches of a given phylogenetic tree
(Figure 4). Derived alleles were inferred from the ancestral
sequence and phylogenies were inferred from our and
others' findings. Hence, if at position j in the alignment
Mithan and Yak share an allele with Domestic cattle and
Gaur, Banteng and Bison share an allele with the buffalo
species, this site would be classified as an aberrant site.
These aberrant sites are of interest, either because; they
were polymorphic in an ancestral species and arisen due
to lineage sorting, or they have arisen due to recent introgression, or are true homoplastic double mutations. The
close relationship and limited divergence time of the
Bovini subtribe make homoplasy (double mutations)
highly unlikely. Thus, if we assume aberrant sites are not
due to double mutations we should be able to test the
accuracy of various phylogenetic reconstructions. By analysing the number of segregating sites within the dataset
we were able to manually infer phylogenetic relationships
and interrogate segregating sites for abnormal inherit-

ance. Hence, the phylogenetic tree that minimised the
number of abnormalities should add extra weight to the
phylogenetic reconstruction inferred by our and others'
studies.
Associations in the Bovini driven by lineage sorting or introgression
To identify whether lineage sorting or more recent introgression with domesticated cattle was responsible for any
anomalies in genetic distance, an analysis was conducted
examining genetic diversity between Domestic cattle and
Mithan, Gaur, Bison and Yak at aberrant and all variable
sites. Haplotype diversity was also examined between
these species, with haplotypes resolved over all variable
sites for each amplicon. Haplotypes generated from all
variable sites were compared with B. taurus for 100%
identity. Because Bovini subfamily is monophyletic all
chromosomes originate from a common ancestor and
therefore a high proportion of sites between all members
of the Bovini are identical. Due to the geographic and sexual isolation of this clade many polymorphic sites are species or lineage specific, therefore identifying haplotypes
that are 100% similar with B. taurus from variable single

nucleotide sites are rare. To overcome this problem we
examined haplotypes generated from homologous sites.
Haplotypes at these sites should be more informative
because they arose in the common ancestor, are present in
all representatives of the clade and may be inherited
abnormally and as a result may be responsible for confusing phylogenetic relationships. Also, due to the recent
divergence of the Bovini tribe species-specific or double
mutations at these exact sites are unlikely and haplotype
structure should help identify recent introgression. Thus,
if Bison or Yak have recently hybridised with Domestic
cattle we would expect haplotypes generated from aberrant sites to be identical with those in B. taurus extended
over amplicons in the same gene or possibly between
genes on the same chromosome, while lineage sorting
should show a more random mode of inheritance at these
sites and consequently show low haplotype identity with
B. taurus over the same region. However, care must be
taken if haplotypes are generated over amplicons from
only a few aberrant sites, as species may be identical by
chance.

Ancient polymorphism and the neutral rate of evolution
All sites undergoing lineage sorting were differentiated as
"old", which were defined as abnormally segregating sites
in the Bovina subtribe, and "ancient", which were defined
as any abnormal site that was still segregating in the
Bubalina and Bovina subtribes. Classifying polymorphisms as either ancient or old should give insights into
how long polymorphisms can persist in a species and its
descendants. Aberrant sites that fell in the coding regions
of the genes were identified, classified and the evolutionary ratio dN/dS was calculated [49].
