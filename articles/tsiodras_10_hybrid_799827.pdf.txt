Abstract
Background: We evaluated two molecular methods of HPV detection and their correlation with cytological and
histological diagnosis in a large sample of Greek women.
Methods: All women with liquid-based cytology performed at a University Hospital between 2000 and 2003 were
included. The Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) kit and in house Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were used for HPV DNA
detection. Cervical biopsy was performed for women with ASCUS+ cytology, HPV detection, or abnormal
colposcopy. Positive (PLR) and negative (NLR) likelihood ratios were calculated for cytology and HPV molecular
testing for the prediction of CIN2 and greater histology.
Results: Of the 1270 women evaluated 241 (18.5%) had abnormal cytology. Cytology diagnosed high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or invasive carcinoma in 21(1.7%) cases whereas 26 (2%) women had CIN2+
or greater histology. PCR detected HPV in 397/1270 (31.3%) and HC2 in 260/1270 (20.4%) samples. Both molecular
tests exhibited high reproducibility (Cohen’s kappa value 0.691, 95% CI: 0.664 - 0.718). Positive likelihood ratios (PLR)
of 9.4, 3.8 and 3.4 and negative likelihood ratios of 0.13, 0.21, and 0 were noted for ≥ LSIL, any positive HC2 or any
positive PCR-HPV testing, for predicting CIN2+ histology, respectively. All CIN 3+ lesions harbored high risk
oncogenic HPV type infections.
Conclusions: HPV infection was found in a large proportion of this population and was associated with CIN 2/3
lesions and infiltrating carcinomas. Thin prep testing and HPV detection by HC2 or PCR performed very well with
regards to identifying high grade lesions in an environment with experienced examiners.

Background
Large epidemiological studies performed over the last
two decades have identified infection with human
papilloma virus (HPV) as a necessary cause for cervical
cancer[1,2]. Furthermore, newer molecular techniques
have greatly helped in identifying the association of
high-risk HPV types with the development of precancerous lesions, as well as their role in cervical carcinogenesis[3,4]. Since the vast majority of invasive cervical
carcinoma cases are associated with HPV type 16 or 18
infections[5,6], efforts have been made to develop preventive measures for infections with these high risk

HPV types: two specific vaccines targeting infection
with HPV types 16 and 18 have recently been introduced[7].
Specific HPV testing may not be appropriate as a primary screening due to claims that it lacks specificity[8]
but it may assist in the management of women with
cytological changes[9]. The association of findings from
conventional cytological testing with those of newer
molecular techniques is of great importance and helps
to better understand the evolution of HPV infection in
different epidemiological settings.
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate cytological findings from a large observational population
sample in association with identification of HPV infection using newer molecular techniques, such as Hybrid

Capture 2 and PCR. Furthermore, we correlate these
findings with histological diagnosis.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional study performed at all specimens sent for diagnostic cytology at the Departments
of Histology and Embryology, and the Department of
Cytopathology of the National and Capodistrian University of Athens Medical School. Samples are
addressed to these departments every day from many
community and hospital-based Gynecology clinics covering the metropolitan area of Athens (roughly a population of 3.8 million people). Informed consent was
obtained from all women included in this study that
was performed between January 2000 and December
2003.
Cytological diagnosis

Samples for the ThinPrep Pap test were collected by
means of a Brun’s-like brush. The PreservCyt ® vials
(Cytyc Inc, Boxborough, MA, USA) containing the cell
samples were addressed to the aforementioned Departments for preparation of thin-layer slides using the
ThinPrep 2000 Automated Slide Processor ® (Cytyc,
Boxborough, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’ instructions. Cytological findings were interpreted according to the Bethesda classification system
[10] and were classified as follows a) within normal
limits; b) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); c) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL); d) high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL); e) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adeno-carcinoma. An experienced
cytopathologist whose diagnostic experience exceeds
10 years examined all samples.
Histological diagnosis

A cervical biopsy was performed if ThinPrep testing
revealed ASCUS and above cytological categories or
there was positive HPV testing or there was a visible
lesion upon colposcopy. Biopsy was performed by an
experienced colposcopist (in practice for more than 10
years) as part of the study protocol. All women with
indications consented to this procedure. The research
was performed with the approval of the Institutional
Review Board and in compliance with the Helsinki
declaration. The three-tiered cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grading system was used for histological
diagnosis [11]. All cases were diagnosed by an experienced pathologist (more than 10 years experience). In
case histology showed a CIN 2 or CIN 3 or invasive carcinoma the patient was referred for appropriate
treatment.

HPV DNA detection

Two techniques were used simultaneously:
a) The commercially available Hybrid Capture 2
(HC2) kit that was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD).
Briefly, HC2 is a signal amplification assay that uses a
combination of antibody capture and chemiluminescent
signal detection. An RNA probe cocktail (full genome
probes) that detects 13 high-risk HPV types (16/18/31/
33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59/68) and 5 low-risk (6/11/
42/43/44) HPV types is used in the reaction with the
target DNA. The RNA:DNA hybrids are captured onto
a solid phase coated with universal capture antibodies
specific for the RNA:DNA hybrids. Capture RNA:DNA
hybrids are detected with multiple antibodies conjugated
to alkaline phoshatase. The signal resulting from the
chemiluminescent reaction is read and the results are
interpreted. For each specimen relative light unit/cutoff
values were calculated as the ratio of the specimen luminescence relative to the luminescence of the 1.0 pg/ml
HPV-16 cut-off standard and reflect a semi-quantitative
value of the cumulative viral burden from one or more
of the examined genotypes. A relative light unit/cutoff
value of ≥ 1 was considered as a positive result. Specimens testing positive for high-risk HPV types or low
risk HPV types only were classified as HPV-high risk or
HPV-low risk respectively, whereas specimens testing
positive for both low and high risk HPV types were classified as HPV low-high risk.
b) An in house Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to
detect HPV DNA presence. DNA was extracted and
purified from 3 ml of residual ThinPrep samples using a
commercially available kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAamp DNA mini kit, Tissue protocol, QIAGEN Inc, Valencia, Ca). The quantity and
integrity of the DNA extracts was monitored through
spectrophotometer readings and amplification of b-globin gene (endogenous control). The extracted DNA was
tested for the presence of HPV DNA by PCR using the
consensus (general) primers GP5+/GP6+ following a
previously published protocol[12]. These primers
amplify a fragment of approximately 150 base pairs (bp)
from the L1 region of 22 anogenital HPV genotypes
(types 6, 11, 13, 16, 18, 30-33, 35, 39, 40, 43, 45, 51, 52,
54, 55, 56, 58, 59 and 66). Positive PCR products
(approximately 150 bp) visualized under UV light after
electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer
(0.1 mol/L Tris, 0.09 mol/L Borate, 1 mol/L EDTA)
stained with ethidium bromide (0,5 μl/ml) were further
analyzed using type-specific primers targeting the E6
region of the HPV genome of HPV types 6,11,16,18,31
and 33 according to a previously published protocol[13].
DNA extracted from HeLa cells infected with HPV18

was used as positive control in the type-specific HPV
PCR assays. The PCR procedure was repeated twice for
every sample. A representative number of PCR products
from each PCR assay was sequenced (ABI PRISM®
3730XL DNA Analyzers by Lark Technologies, Inc, UK)
and the PCR products were confirmed.
Statistical methods

Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
values were calculated for cytological results and molecular HPV testing against the histological diagnosis of
CIN2 and above or CIN3 and above. More specifically,
we calculated values considering all cytology results ≥
ASCUS as positive, or all ≥ LSIL as positive or all ≥
HSIL as positive separately. For HC2 we calculated
values for any positive result and for positive high risk
results (all high risk infections independent of whether
they were high risk only or mixed low-high risk infections). For PCR we used either any positive result or
positive results for HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33 only.
Positive and negative likelihood ratios were also calculated [14]: likelihood ratios enable the comparison of
diagnostic values of tests in a way independent of the
prevalence of the disease. The PLR [sensitivity/(1 - specificity)] corrects the true positive rate by the false positive rate of a test while on the other hand NLR [(1 sensitivity)/specificity] compares the probability of a
negative test in persons with disease, compared to the
probability of a negative test in persons without disease
[14]. Finally, a Cohen’s kappa value was calculated for
evaluating the agreement between the test results of
HC2 and PCR methods.

Results
Cytological results

During the 4 year period 1270 women were evaluated
(mean age: 34.2 ± 12.1 years old). Table 1 depicts age
associations with cytological findings and HPV detection. The vast majority (n = 991, 78%) of the population
examined were between 21 and 45 years old. Overall
241/1270 (19%) women were diagnosed with abnormal
cytology (Table 1): more specifically, 101 (8%) women

exhibited ASC-US, 119 (9.4%) were diagnosed with
LSIL, 10 (0.8%) with HSIL, 10 (0.8%) with squamous
cell carcinoma and 1 (0.8%) with adenocarcinoma. HSIL
or infiltrating carcinoma was the cytological diagnosis in
21/1270 (1.7%) samples. Reporting rates of ASC-US/
LSIL combined were 30.6% for women under 21 yrs old,
17.8% for the 22-30 yrs group, 17.7% for 30-45 yrs
group, and then declined in older age groups (Table 1).
HSIL+ rates increased with age, with 17/21 (81%)
HSIL+ lesions diagnosed in women older than 30 years.
Seven of the 11 (63.6%) invasive cancer cases were
noted after 45 years of age (Table 1). Regarding HPV
testing, PCR+ rates were approximately double those of
ASC-US/LSIL combined for all age groups up until 65
years (Table 1).
ThinPrep diagnosis in relation to HPV DNA detection
by HC2 or PCR testing is depicted in Table 2. HPV was
detected by HC2 in 260/1270 (20.4%) samples and by
PCR in 397/1270 (31.3%) samples. The two tests gave
highly concordant results (Cohen’s k value 0.691, 95%
CI: 0.664 - 0.718). Discrepancies between HC2 and PCR
were observed in 153 specimens. HC2 detected 8 specimens as being positive for HPV that were not detected
by PCR (4 with ASCUS-all low risk HPV types; 4 with
LSIL, 3 low and 1 high risk HPV types). PCR detected
HPV in 145 specimens not detected by HC2, (80 with
normal cytology, 45 with ASCUS, 16 with LSIL, 2 with
HSIL, 1 with squamous cell carcinoma and 1 with adenocarcinoma). HC2 detected HPV in 17/21 (81%) while
PCR detected HPV in 21/21 (100%) samples with HSIL+
cytology (Table 2). In the squamous cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma categories 2/11 (18.2%) samples tested
negative for HPV DNA with HC2, whereas none of
these samples was negative with PCR (Table 2). In 21
cases HPV was not detected by either method: eleven
cases with ASCUS and ten cases with LSIL.
HC2 detected infection with high risk or mixed lowhigh risk HPV types in 40/101(39.6%) of ASCUS cases.
PCR detected HPV 16, 18, 31, or 33 (single or multiple
infections) in 31/86 (36%) of ASCUS cases. For LSIL the
corresponding figures were 77/119 (64.7%) and 63/105

Histological results

The comparison of ThinPrep diagnoses and histological
results is presented at Table 3. In total, 426 women
underwent biopsy (Table 3). From patients with ASCUS
58 out of 101 (57.4%) had CIN 1 in biopsy, whereas
only 3 (3%) patients had CIN 2 or higher-grade lesions
(Table 3). Only two of 119 (1.7%) patients with LSIL
had CIN 2. All (100%) cases classified as HSIL with
ThinPrep cytology had a biopsy diagnosis of either
CIN2 or CIN 3. ThinPrep cytology correctly identified
the single case with cervical adenocarcinoma as well as
10 of 11 (90.9%) subjects with a histological diagnosis of
SCC (Table 3). One patient diagnosed cytologically as
ASCUS had a SCC on subsequent biopsy.
Nineteen out of 26 cases (73.1%) with a biopsy diagnosis of CIN 2+ had a HC2 positive test for high risk

negative likelihood ratios for cytological and molecular
HPV testing and histological diagnosis of CIN2+ or
CIN3+ are provided in Table 4. Positive likelihood ratios
(PLR) of 9.4, 3.8 and 3.4 were noted for ≥ LSIL, positive
HC2 or positive HPV testing respectively and CIN2+
histology (Table 4). For CIN2+ histological lesion the
best positive likelihood ratios (PLR) were observed with
Thin prep testing exhibiting ≥ LSIL (PLR = 9.4), or ≥
HSIL (PLR = infinite), and for high risk type of virus
detection either by HC2 (PLR = 5.5), or PCR (PLR =
11.4). Similar figures were observed for CIN3 (Table 4).
Negative likelihood ratios of 0.13, 0.21, and 0 were
noted for cytology ≥ LSIL, positive HC2 or positive
HPV testing respectively and CIN2+ histology (Table 4).

Discussion
This study depicts the successful use of both HC2 and
PCR in liquid based ThinPrep samples. Use of the same
samples for both DNA tests was done to avoid bias. The
HC2 kit assesses the presence of 18 low risk (i.e.

6,11,42,43 and 44) and high risk (i.e. 16, 18, 31, 33, 35,
39, 45, 51, 51, 56, 58, 59 and 68) HPV types [15,16]. On
the other hand, using the L1 consensus primers GP5
+
/GP6 + by PCR, we were able to screen for 22 HPV
types. The concordance rate between the PCR and HC2
test results was high in our series. Both molecular tests
exhibited high reproducibility measured by Cohen’s
kappa value of 0.691, similar to previous reported results
[17,18]. Although not all studies use the same PCR protocol, the concordance between HC2 and PCR testing
across various studies is generally high, usually exceeding 80% [17-20]. It appears that after a certain DNA
concentration cutoff point, HC2 sensitivity increases,
carrying a certain risk for false positive results[17].
Newer generation kits decrease rates of false positive
testing[21]. Certain cutoff levels for relative light units
compared to the ones generated by the positive control
samples to increase the specificity of the assay without
compromising sensitivity may be used[18]. One explanation for some of the discordant results between HC2

and PCR in our study is the fact that GP5+/GP6+ primers may actually miss some cases deleted in the L1
region of the virus. In addition, some of the samples
exhibiting discordance may have infection with HPV
types such as HPV 42, 44 or 68 not amplified by the
used primers, but still detectable by the HC2 cocktails.
Moreover, HC2 probe B cocktail can react with phylogenetically related HPV types not represented in the
probe such as HPV 67, CP 6108, and CP8061. Finally,
the prevalence of latent infection differs across studies,
depending upon demographic parameters; this may also
affect the sensitivity and specificity of the two tests.
Our results confirm the higher prevalence of HPV
infection in women with abnormal cytology, in concordance with most studies so far published, that have
observed that the increase in HPV prevalence is related
to the increasing grade of squamous intraepithelial
lesions [22-26]. Rates of HPV detection in samples with
normal cytology vary widely in the literature in women
with normal cytology and range from 4.9% to 30.4% for
the HC2 assay and from 3 to 34.3% for PCR testing
[18,19,21,25,27]. This wide range is explained by the different nature of participating populations in such studies, and by technical evolutions in the diagnostic tests
used[21,28]. The higher analytical sensitivity of PCR
explains the higher detection rates compared to HC2 in
samples with low-grade cytological and no histological
abnormalities and may be suggestive of the presence of
latent HPV infection requiring a molecular test with
higher analytical sensitivity.
Similar to other observations, both hybrid capture and
PCR HPV DNA testing showed a strong correlation
with the diagnosis of CIN lesions or squamous cell carcinoma [23,29]. The extremely high negative predictive
values of both molecular tests underlie their importance
in screening for high grade lesions and are in concordance with previous publications[18]. In high grade
cytological and histological lesions, HPV detection rates
appeared to be a little higher with PCR than with HC2
testing; for example HC2 did not identify high risk
viruses in seven instances of CIN2+ histological lesions,
in which cases PCR was positive. However positive and
negative likelihood ratios were similar for positive HC2
(any result) or PCR - HPV positive testing (any result)
both for CIN2+ or for CIN3+ histology. Actually, HC2
had a better PLR while PCR had a better NLR in both
histological categories. This means that with a positive
HC2 there was a greater likelihood of disease (≥ CIN2)
than with PCR, while with a negative HPV PCR there
was a lesser likelihood of disease (≥ CIN2) than with
HC2. Nevertheless, in essence both tests gave similar
results. Likelihood ratios can be used to calculate the
odds of post test probabilities if multiplied by the odds
of the prevalence of the disease. For example, a patient

Page 6 of 8

in our study had a post test probability of disease (CIN2
+) of only 5.1% (using the Bayes nomogram) if she had
a negative HC2 test (according to our study she had a
pre-test probability of 20.4% of having a positive test).
Similarly a negative PCR for high risk types 16, 18, 31
and 33 has a post test probability of disease (CIN2+) of
1.93% (Table 4). The limitation of a population that is
not systematically screened, but is consecutively enrolled
for deriving this data is of course recognized. However,
both molecular HPV tests did not outperform cytology
that had comparable if not better results, especially if
the HSIL+ cytological lesion cutoff point was used. In
our study all HSIL lesions by cytology were either CIN
2 or CIN 3 by histology and all cytological diagnoses of
invasive carcinomas were subsequently confirmed by
histology. Possible explanations for this observation
include the following: a) the experience of all doctors
involved; b) the increased alertness of both the referring
gynecologist and the cytopathologist examining the
slides; c) the fact that the Department of Cytopathology
is accredited and therefore undergoes continuous quality
assessment/quality control evaluation.
Although none of the patients with normal cytology
and an HPV infection had a biopsy proven lesion higher
than CIN 1 in our study, these women should not be
considered false-positive but as having a real risk for
progression to abnormal cytological findings and cervical neoplasia [30-33]. It is known that development of
precancerous lesions may shortly follow infection with
HPV, despite the belief that long-term infection is a prerequisite for such an event [34]. Thus, these women
should be prospectively followed by their gynecologist
and submitted to cytology and other testing, as appropriate[35,36]. The use of HPV testing has been recommended for women with ASCUS[37] and it has been
shown that approximately one third of women with
HSIL are subsequently identified from an initial ASCUS
diagnosis [25]. These women, after positive HPV DNA
testing should be referred for colposcopy[38]; our study
underlines this argument, since one woman with
ASCUS, had a single infection with HPV type 16 and
biopsy disclosed squamous cell carcinoma. Nowadays, in
the revised Bethesda 2001 classification system this case
would probably be diagnosed as ASC-H. A molecular
technique, more sensitive and specific than HC2 may be
more appropriate for such patients.
The current observations further confirm the association of high risk HPV types with cytological detection of
HSIL or invasive carcinoma but also with histologically
confirmed premalignant or malignant lesions [39-41].
All cases of CIN 2, CIN 3 or carcinomas harbored single
or multiple HPV high risk oncogenic type infections. In
our study single infections with HPV types 16 or 18 in
cases of invasive carcinoma were strong evidence for

Tsiodras et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/53

this association and support the strong rationale for preventive HPV vaccination in our population.
The rate of invasive carcinoma discovered in this
study is indicative of a largely unscreened population.
The reasons and possible solutions for this observation
are an important public health issue and should be
further investigated. Moreover the effect of the introduction of newer techniques in population screening is
a matter of intense research. Despite the excellent
results with cytology in this study, it is well known that
screening for cytological changes may have limited sensitivity and findings are not always reproducible [8]. In a
country where screening is largely opportunistic and
based on self-referral results of cytological testing are
expected to be much worse than the ones presented
here. Moreover, molecular HPV testing should not be
introduced without careful planning; results of such
testing should be communicated and explained appropriately in the context of prevalence of the disease.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study was more of a technical
nature and focused on strengths and weakness of current screening methods in correlation with histological
findings. HPV rates were high in high grade lesions in
accordance to published literature however HPV was
also identified in a large fraction of samples with normal
cytology or in samples with normal biopsies. The best
approach for such samples will be guided after careful
identification of the local epidemiology of the transmission and risk factors for HPV acquisition. Newer methods assessing the integration of the virus may be more
appropriate in the workup of such cases. In our study in
an referral center with experienced doctors, thin prep
cytology and molecular HPV tests performed equally
well as screening tests in all scenarios and sometimes
were complementary to each other. As newer methods
to detect HPV continue to evolve it is important to
recognize the clinicopathological correlates of such testing. This will lead to more appropriate screening strategies in the post-vaccine era.
