Abstract
Background: Non-coding DNA represents a high proportion of all metazoan genomes. Although
an undetermined fraction of this DNA may be considered devoid of any function, it also contains
important information residing in specific cis-regulatory sequences.
Results: We report a 27 bp motif that is overrepresented within the fly genome. This motif does
not show any significant similarity with transposon sequences and is strongly associated with genes
involved in development and/or signal transduction. The 27 bp motif is preferentially located within
introns, and has a tendency to be present in multiple copies around genes. Furthermore, it is often
found embedded in known non-coding regulatory regions. The regulatory network defined by this
motif is partially shared in D. pseudoobscura.
Conclusion: We have identified a 27 bp cis-regulatory sequence widely distributed within the
Drosophila genome in association with developmental genes. This motif may be very useful towards
the annotation of functional regulatory regions within the Drosophila genome and the construction
of regulatory networks of Drosophila development.

Background
Coding regions constitute a small portion of metazoan
genomes, representing ~24% of the small genome of Drosophila melanogaster and less than 2% of the larger human
genome [1,2]. Although an unknown proportion of noncoding DNA might be regarded as "junk DNA", non-coding regions also include important information related to
essential processes such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, splicing, higher-order chromatin
structure and DNA replication. This information generally
lays in specific DNA sequences located both in intergenic
regions and introns. Nevertheless, this information
remains largely inaccessible to the researchers, due to the

reduced knowledge about structure and function of noncoding DNA.
Different approaches have been proposed to infer putative
cis-regulatory regions. One strategy is based on the identification of overrepresented motifs in sets of coexpressed
genes [3-5]. This approach requires prior data on gene
expression of large number of genes, generally determined
by microarray technology or expressed sequence tags
(ESTs).
A second method to locate novel regulatory regions
within the genome is the search for statistically

improbable concentration of putative binding sites for a
transcription factor or a set of functionally related transcription factors. This method generates testable predictions about the function of the putative regulatory
regions. For instance, identification of clusters of binding
sites for dorsal, dl, and Suppresor of Hairless, Su(H), have led
to the identification of new regulatory regions within the
Drosophila genome controlled by these genes [6,7]. In
other cases, clustering of binding sites for different transcription factors, such as those active in early Drosophila
development or those determining mesoderm activation
also revealed new enhancers [8-10].
A third approach (evolutionary comparative approach)
relies on the availability of full genome sequences of several eukaryotes, and is based on the fact that conservation
of blocks of non-coding sequence between distantly
related species is unlikely and thus implies functional
constraint on the conserved blocks (called phylogenetic
footprints) [11,12].
All of these approaches represent an essential contribution to one of the major goals in genome research, the
construction of regulatory networks, consisting of the
linkages between different cis-regulatory systems the genes
they govern [13].
The wingless (wg) gene is a member of the Wnt gene family
that encode for secreted glycoproteins, which act as key
intercellular signaling molecules during animal development [14]. Although the mechanisms of wg signaling are
beginning to be understood [15], much less is known
about how the complex pattern of expression of wg is
regulated.
While searching the D. melanogaster wg intron sequences
for putative regulatory regions using an evolutionary comparative approach, we identified a 27 bp long motif that is
overrepresented within the D. melanogaster genome and
that is strongly associated with genes involved in development and/or signal transduction. This motif does not bear
any similarity with any of the described D. melanogaster
transposons. The gene network defined for D. melanogaster is partially present in D. pseudoobscura. This motif
might prove useful in searching for new genes involved in
Drosophila development, in genome annotation and in the
construction of regulatory networks.

Results
Identification of a 27 bp long motif overrepresented in the
fly genome
Two transcripts have been found for the D. melanogaster
wg gene. The longer transcript codes for five exons, while
the shorter one codes for only four exons. The 3' end of
the first intron of the longer transcript is part of the 5'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/52

untranslated region (UTR) of the shorter transcript since
the alternative wg start codon is located within the second
exon of the longer transcript (Release 3.1 of the D. melanogaster genome, February 2003). Three out of the four
introns of the longer transcript are large (more than 1 Kb
long) considering that more than half of D. melanogaster
introns are less than 80 nucleotides in length [16]. Regulatory sequences are often found within intron sequences
(see for instance [17-19]). A detailed analysis of wg noncoding regions, including the intron regions, could therefore help understanding how wg expression is regulated.
In order to identify putative regulatory regions embedded
in the D. melanogaster wg introns, we first identified the D.
pseudoobscura contig that contains the wg orthologous
intron sequences using BLAST search [20]. In contrast
with wg intron 2, when the first and third introns were
used as a query, many hits of 20 bp or longer were
obtained in the D. pseudoobscura genome. Visual inspection of these sequences revealed that only hits generated
by the first intron are not microsatellites. The conserved
signal obtained using the wg intron 1 sequence was about
25–30 bp long. This is surprising since the fast turnover
rate of Drosophila binding sites [21] means that it is
unlikely that long motifs are shared between the genomes
of species as distant as D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. In fact, a search for additional dispersed repetitive
sequences within the introns of 21 developmental genes
(from table 1 of reference [22]) did not detect any
sequence as long as this one. Since the D. pseudoobscura
genome is unannotated and incomplete, this observation
motivated us to perform BLAST searches against the D.
melanogaster genome using as a query the first intron of
the D. melanogaster wg gene. This led to the identification
of the 25–30 bp motif in many regions of the fly genome
(more than 300 hits). This motif does not show any significant similarity with the sequences deposited in the
transposon database at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome
Project [23]. Thus, the best hit (element jockey2) presents
only 14/16 identities (E-value = 44). We also ruled out the
possibility of the motif being a known microRNA, after
the search of a database of published microRNAs [24] for
sequences homologous to the motif yielded no positive
result.
About 200 sequences, 100 bp long and centered around
the motif were collected and aligned using the program
diAlign [25]. The software diAlign is especially suitable to
perform local multiple alignments to identify homologous stretches of DNA interspersed between sequences of
no homology. For a contiguous stretch of 27 bp the most
abundant nucleotide is always at a frequency higher than
50%, while elsewhere the frequency of the most frequent
nucleotide is always lower than 50%. For 10 out of the 27
positions of the contiguous DNA stretch, the same

nucleotide is present in more than 99% of the sequences
and is therefore presumed to be critical for the function of
the motif. The frequency of the most abundant nucleotide
reaches more than 70% in all other positions except
nucleotide 23, where C is present in ~55% of the
sequences and T in the other 45%. For these positions, the
frequency of the 2nd most abundant nucleotide is always
lower than 25%. The length of the motif was thus established as 27 bp.
In order to locate all motifs in the D. melanogaster genome
and to avoid the inclusion of false positives we decided to
use an approach similar to the use of PWM to identify
binding sites for transcription factors. BLAST E-values are
not suitable when analyzing short sequences since they
depend on the size of the retrieved sequence. Motifs with
mismatches at the end of the sequence relative to the
query's sequence will usually be retrieved as shorter
sequences than motifs having the same total number of
mismatches, but with the mismatches located internally.
Therefore different E-values are going to be reported even
though the two sequences have the same total number of
mismatches relative to the query sequence.
The most important difference relative to the use of conventional PWM that we introduce is that we do not use the
actual nucleotide frequencies to weight each position
accordingly, since the lack of any functional information
prevents us from selecting a specific subset of sequences to
construct it. Standard computer software designed to
identify putative binding sites for known transcription
factor binding sites (such as MatInspector [26]) failed to
identify any credible sites embedded in the 27 bp motif
sequence (data not shown). The parameters of our ad hoc
PWM were thus set to identify all the D. melanogaster
sequences that match the consensus in those positions
with the most frequent nucleotide appearing in more than
99% of the sampling sequences (but allowing C or T at
position 23, see Material and Methods). We searched for
all sequences differing from 0 to 8 nucleotides from the
preliminary consensus sequence (based on the sequences
retrieved from the BLAST search) at the other positions

using the server Target Explorer [27,28]. Rather than
obtaining a raise in the number of targets as we increase
the number of allowed differences (as expected by
chance), the distribution shown in Fig. 1 reveals that the
majority of target sequences present between 2 and 4 differences from consensus. This distribution strongly suggests a biological function for the sequence. According to
this distribution, we set a conservative cut-off value of 4
differences to avoid the inclusion of putative false positives. A total of 368 sequences matched this criterion, representing 75.7% of the identified sequences. All the
subsequent analyses were performed based on these 368
sequences, which we, therefore, expect to constitute a representative subset of all relevant sequences. The consensus
sequence based on these 368 sequences is shown in Fig. 2,
as a pictogram. This consensus sequence is identical to the
preliminary consensus sequence (see above), being the
relative nucleotide frequencies at each position very
similar.

Using the same criterion, no matches were found in a set
of 20 random sequences of 250000 bp with the same
nucleotide composition as the D. melanogaster intergenic
regions, while ~15 motifs were expected based on the proportion within the Drosophila genome (368 repeats / 120
Mb). Thus, the repeat is significantly highly overrepresented within the Drosophila genome.
Distribution of the sequence motif
As shown in Table 1, the 27 bp motif is present in all chromosome arms but the small chromosome 4. Nevertheless,
this distribution departs from the random expectation
based on the total length of each chromosome arm (χ2 =
13.433, 5df, P < 0.0196), due mainly to an underrepresentation of the motif in the X chromosome, coupled to an
overrepresentation on both arms of chromosome 3.

The location of the 27 bp motif relative to D. melanogaster
genes is shown in Fig. 3. There are 125 motifs within
introns and 234 in intergenic regions. Seven motifs are
located within the 5' UTR of genes, one within the 3' UTR
and one within a coding region of Spatzle3 (Spz3). These
numbers should be taken with some caution as some currently annotated intergenic regions may be found to be
the introns of larger transcripts. Furthermore, some currently annotated intron regions may contain alternative
spliced exons, as well as small nested genes yet to be recognized. At present, there is thus no good approximation
for the actual figures on the proportion of intronic and
intergenic regions [2]. Therefore, the numbers previously

reported (~20 Mb of intron sequences versus ~76 Mb of
intergenic sequences [29]) are likely not correct, but can
be used as an approximation. The strong deviation from
the null hypotheses of identical distribution of sites in
intronic versus intergenic regions (χ2 = 42.557. 1 df, P <
0.0001) suggests, nevertheless, the existence of a significant overrepresentation of the sequence within introns.
While 173 of the intergenic motifs are located upstream of
the nearest gene, only 61 are downstream (Fig. 3). These
values significantly depart from an equal proportion of
motifs 5' and 3' of the nearest gene (χ2 = 43.834, 1 df, P <
0.0001). Interestingly, 20% of the motifs located
upstream of genes are within the first 1000 bp from the
transcription start.
The distribution of distances between consecutive motifs
(Fig. 4) reveals a clear trend for the motif to form clusters.
78.5% of the motifs are included in clusters of at least two
motifs within 50 kb, while the proportion detected in the
Drosophila genome is one motif per ~326 Kb. There are 16
clusters of at least two motifs within 1000 bp. We also
analyzed the existence of clusters based on the association
with genes, rather than by distance (Fig. 5). Approximately 37% of the genes associated with the repeat
present more than one repeat around/within the gene.
The proportion of motifs belonging to these clusters
around/within genes reaches ~62% of the total number of
motifs. We used the Gene Ontology (GO) classification
[30] to search for any bias in the molecular function or
biological process of genes associated with the motif,

using the Target Explorer web server. We performed three
different analyses. In the first one, all the motifs were
included. Bearing in mind that an important proportion
of motifs forms clusters, we reanalyzed our data set selecting only one motif per cluster. When a repeat is located in
an intergenic region, both genes around the motif are considered in these two analyses, leading to an underestimation of the actual bias towards genes involved in particular
processes. Because of that, we performed a third analysis,
including those genes with at least one motif within
introns, so the association motif-gene is unambiguous.
Since each analysis comprises a fraction of the motifs
included in the previous one, we expect a concomitant
reduction in the power of the test due to the smaller sampling size.

As shown in Table 2, the 27 bp motif is significantly associated with genes whose molecular function is related to
signal transduction and/or transcriptional regulation. In
regard to the biological process, there is a significant
overrepresentation of genes involved in development,
and a significant underrepresentation of genes related to
cell growth and/or maintenance. For instance, only 6.3%
of all genes in the Gene Ontology database are associated
with the transcriptional regulation category. Therefore,
under the null hypothesis that the 27 bp motif is associated with genes regardless of their molecular function, we
expect that approximately 6.3% of the genes in our sample belong to the transcriptional regulation category. If we
consider the subset of genes that have the 27 bp motif
located in the middle of intron sequence, as much as
14.9% of the genes are associated with the transcriptional

regulation category. The difference of the expected and
observed proportion is highly significant (P < 0.005).
There are 102 well-known genes putatively associated
with the repeat, considering both genes around intergenic
motifs. Fifty-four of these genes are included in at least
one of the overrepresented categories of the Gene
Ontology tree. See additional file 1 for the complete list of
genes putatively associated with the repeat.
Conservation of the sequence motif in other species
In order to infer general facts about the evolution of the
motif, we searched for its presence in the genome of D.
pseudoobscura, a species with an ongoing genome project
[31]. We located the orthologous region of 322 out of the
368 motifs detected in D. melanogaster, amounting to
87.5% of the sequences. Using the same criterion as in D.
melanogaster, we identified 178 conserved motifs within
the orthologous region of D. pseudoobscura, accounting for
55.3% of the 322 sequences.

If the information associated with each one of the motifs
from the same cluster is at least partially redundant, those
motifs not belonging to clusters are expected to be more
constrained than the clustered ones. Nevertheless, we
identified only 62 motifs in D. pseudoobscura within the
120 orthologous regions with motif not associated in
clusters in D. melanogaster. These values do not differ significantly from the null hypothesis of equal degree of conservation in both subsets (χ2 = 1.010, 1 df, P < 0.3150).
We further analyzed the 178 motif pairs to characterize
the selective constraint. If the degree of constraint to

maintain the similarity to consensus is similar in the two
species, we expect a correlation between the number of
differences from consensus in each one of the orthologous sequences. If one motif is more constrained in one of
the species, this correlation is expected to be lost. The
number of pairs with identical number of differences
from consensus is significantly higher than expected
under the hypothesis of no correlation (57 vs 37.76, χ2 =
12.437, 1 df, P < 0.0004), indicative of the action of selection to maintain the degree of divergence (Table 3).
Selection may be acting mainly to maintain the relative
affinity (roughly approximated as the number of differences from the consensus) or/and to maintain the exact
sequence of the motif in any particular context. Fig. 6
shows the observed and expected number of differences at
each position of the motif between the 178 orthologous
pairs between species, based on the nucleotide frequencies at each position within each one of the species. In all
positions, the number of motif pairs with nucleotide difference is lower than expected. This difference is significant in most cases (Fig. 6), indicating that selection acts to
maintain the appropriate motif variant at each particular
location.
We also searched for the presence of the motif in other
species using BLAST search. We identified one sequence
within the first intron of the gene Om(1D) (Accession No.
X56682) from D. ananassae, species that belongs also to
the subgenus Sophophora (as D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura). This gene is the orthologous to the D. mela-

orthologous location. We also identified the motif in two
genes of D. virilis, from the Drosophila subgenus. One
copy is located 5' from the actin E2 gene (Accession No.
AF358263). The orthologous sequence in D. melanogaster
also contains a sequence equivalent to those of the motif,
but presenting 5 differences from the consensus. The
other copy located in D. virilis is present within the
enhancer region of the achaete-scute (ac-sc) complex

D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura lacked the motif. The

genome using as a query the first intron of the A. gambiae

ing elements located within non-coding DNA (see for
instance, [32-34]). Here, we describe a 27 bp long repetitive DNA sequence within the Drosophila genome that,
based on its characteristics, may be considered one of
these cis-acting elements.

Discussion

Mainly, there is a significant association of the 27 bp long
motif to genes involved in development, whose molecular
function is related to signal transduction and/or transcriptional regulation (Table 2). This association may be
indeed stronger than shown in Table 2, taking into
account that any given gene is usually classified under several different categories of the Gene Ontology classification. For instance, although only 41.3% of the biological
process classifications of the 22 genes with the motif
present within an intron are annotated as involved in
development (Table 2), 19 of them (~86%) are indeed
known to be involved in development.

Most essential processes, such as transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, DNA replication, or higherorder chromatin structure, are under the control of cis-act-

There are also several selector or selector-like genes [35],
conserved transcription factors that act controlling the
development of morphogenetic fields giving rise to
specific adult structures, such as twist (twi) in mesoderm
tissues, Distal-less (Dll) in the ventral appendages, pannier
(pnr) in dorso-medial domains of trunk and head, brachyenteron (byn) in posterior terminal structures, engrailed
(en) in posterior compartments, and B-H1 and Bar-H2 (BH2) in neural tissues (see FlyBase [36] for a description of

these genes' function, plus references therein). Thus, this
motif may define an important regulatory network,
linking together several fundamental genes active during
Drosophila development (Table 2 and Additional file 1).
Second, our strategy to search for the conservation of the
motif in D. pseudoobscura (see Methods) revealed that 70%
of the regions around the motif in D. melanogaster present
at least 70 identical nucleotides out of 100 bp of sequence
in D. pseudoobscura. A recent comparison of non-coding
regions between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura [12]
revealed that only 28% of the non-coding sequences are
conserved between these two species. The conserved noncoding sequences (defined as windows of at least 10 bp
with at least 90% of nucleotide identity) tend to be spatially clustered. Therefore, these data strongly indicate that

the motif described in this paper is generally located
within regulatory regions of genes.

tion is expected to be less efficient to create and/or
maintain this sequence motif in the X chromosome.

In agreement with this prediction, several copies of the
motif are located within known regulatory regions. Thus,
the six motifs associated to dpp (Additional file 1) are
located within the 3' "disk region" of the gene, an
enhancer controlling the expression of dpp in imaginal
discs [37]. Two motifs located between 10 and 15 Kb
upstream of Ser are included within the "dorsal wing regulator" enhancer (DWR), which directs the expression of
Ser in the wing disc [38]. The motif associated to Su(H) is
located within the autoregulatory socket enhancer (ASE),
a discrete cell specific transcriptional enhancer active only
in the socket cells of external sensory organs [39]. This
enhancer is regulated by the Su(H)'s own protein product,
containing eight predicted high-affinity binding sites for
the Su(H) protein. The motif is embedded within these
binding sites. In contrast to the previous examples, the
regulatory sequences of Dl are dispersed over a large
stretch of DNA rather than being concentrated in discrete
zones. The first intron of Dl, which presents one motif,
contains a quantitative enhancer of transcription acting
on several different organs [40].

It should be noted that although this 27 bp motif does not
show any significant similarity with any of the transposable elements listed in the transposon database at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project [23], we cannot rule out
a transposable element origin for this motif. All transposons are known to be underrepresented on the X chromosome relative to the autosomes [42]. The
underrepresentation of the 27 bp motif in the X
chromosome could thus simply reflect its origin. It has
been suggested that in an unknown proportion of cases
transposons might be a source of "ready-to-use" regulatory motifs [43,44].

Several characteristics of the motif, such as its trend to
form clusters within/around genes (Fig. 5) or its biased
location in regard to the transcription units (Fig. 3), might
be a consequence of its association with regulatory
regions of genes associated with signal transduction pathways, and transcription factors involved in several developmental processes. In general, these genes present
several independent enhancers located not only
upstream, but also downstream or in intronic regions. The
modularity of the enhancer architecture [13] is in
agreement with our observation of similar constraints acting on those motifs belonging to clusters and the remaining, non-clustered, motifs.
In a similar way, one could image that the underrepresentation of the motif in the X chromosome might be due to
a biased distribution of developmental genes on this chromosome. Nevertheless, this does not seem to be the case,
since137 of the 681 fly genes associated with the GO term
"development", and whose chromosomal locations are
known, lay on the X chromosome, slightly over the
expected value of 128, estimated based on the sequence
length of each chromosomal arm (χ2 test; P > 0.05). Alternatively the explanation for the underrepresentation of
the motif in the X chromosome might be related to the
lower effective population size of this chromosome when
compared to autosomes (3/4 that of autosomes). Because
of that, according to the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution (see [41] for a recent review), natural selec-

The comparative genomic approach revealed that the regulatory network defined by this motif in D. melanogaster is
partially shared with D. pseudoobscura. Furthermore, conserved motifs seem to be constrained to maintain not only
location but also the exact sequence variant at each particular position (Table 3 and Fig. 6), as described previously
in the case of binding sites for transcription factors
envolved in early Drosophila development [21].
Although the early stage of the D. pseudoobscura genome
project precludes a full comparison, our results indicate
that more than half of the motifs are conserved between
the two species. Two facts suggest that this figure might
underestimate the actual number of conserved sequences.
First, while the consensus sequence for the motif is identical in both species, the inferred PWM might be different,
as we used the PWM derived from D. melanogaster to classify a sequence from D. pseudoobscura as matching the
motif. In fact, the average number of differences between
the 178 motifs of D. melanogaster whose orthologous has
been identified in D. pseudoobscura and the consensus
sequence is 2.07, while this figure reaches 2.43 in the case
of the D. pseudoobscura motifs. Second, the cut-off score
(allowing for a maximum of four differences from consensus in the changing positions) might be too stringent,
leading to the detection of only high affinity binding sitescontaining motifs conserved in both species. In fact, we
found several cases of orthologous regions in D. pseudoobscura containing a sequence that differs from the consensus in only 5 or 6 differences, but that were, nevertheless,
excluded from our data set for further analysis. A similar
situation occurs in the case of the actin E2 from D. virilis,
whose orthologous sequence in D. melanogaster presents 5
differences from consensus.
The detection of the motif in other Drosophila species from
the Drosophila subgenus shows that this motif arose
within the genome before the radiation of the genus. Its
absence in Anopheles is expected, taking into account that

Page 9 of 12

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

only a very small proportion of regulatory regions are conserved between these two genera of Diptera [12,45].
Finally, it is interesting to remark that one concern of cisregulatory prediction algorithms is the rate of false positives [9,10]. This problem is not present in the case of the
motif described here due to its unusually long length
compared to other regulatory motifs, which makes its
appearance by chance highly improbable. This characteristic and the others discussed previously, makes this motif
very useful towards the annotation of functional regulatory regions within the Drosophila genome and the construction of regulatory networks of Drosophila
development. It may also be useful for inferring the function of a number of genes that show no similarity with
other known genes. Functional tests will be required to
characterize the function of this motif.

Conclusions
We have identified a cis-regulatory sequence motif widely
distributed within the Drosophila genome in association
with genes involved in development and/or signal transduction. Due to the unusual long size of this motif (27
bp) in comparison with other regulatory motifs, its
appearance by chance is highly improbable. Because of
that, this motif may be very useful towards the annotation
of functional regulatory regions within the Drosophila
genome as well as the construction of regulatory networks
of Drosophila development.

Methods
BLAST searches and sequence alignments
BLAST searches were conducted using the BLAST server
from NCBI [46] and the BLAST server from the D. pseudoobscura Genome Project [20]. The program diAlign [25]
was used to perform local multiple alignments to identify
homologous stretches of DNA interspersed between
sequences of no homology.
Identification and location of a 27 bp motif in the D.
melanogaster genome
A strategy similar to the use of position weigth matrices
(PWMs) for the identification of binding sites for transcription factors was used to search for the presence of a
27 bp motif in the D. melanogaster genome previously
identified by BLAST searches. It should be noted, however, that in our case we do not use binding affinity/functional information on the observed nucleotide
frequencies to weight each position accordingly. We use
the web server Target Explorer [27,28]; that easily allows
for the editing of the PWM using the following general
rules. In positions where the most frequent nucleotide
appears in => 90% of the sampling sequences, any nonmatching nucleotide was weighted very negatively (-20),
while a matching nucleotide is given a +1 weight. In the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/52

remaining positions, a weight of +1 was given to the
nucleotide present in the preliminary consensus and a
weight of -1 was given to the other nucleotides. In the case
of nucleotide position 23, where C and T seem to be
equally used, the presence of either nucleotide was
weighted as +1. To identify those sequences differing from
consensus in less than 5 differences, for instance, the cutoff score was set as +18. This approach completely
excludes any sequence that differs at any one of the almost
invariant positions. The identification of the motifs was
performed using the release 3 of the D. melanogaster
genome and the program Patser [47] as implemented by
Target Explorer. Both the location of the repeats in regard
to the nearest transcription units and the classification of
associated genes according to Gene Ontology categories
were also performed by Target Explorer.
Generation of random sequences was done by the random generator tool available at the Regulatory Sequence
Analysis Tools web page [48]. This program generates random sequences with the same oligonucleotide composition as observed in the intergenic regions of the selected
organism (D. melanogaster) by a Markov chain probabilistic model.
Identification of D. pseudoobscura genomic regions
orthologous to those of D. melanogaster containing the
27 bp motif
In order to identify the D. pseudoobscura genomic regions
orthologous to those of D. melanogaster presenting the
motif, we employed two different approaches: (1) BLAST
searches against the D. pseudoobscura sequencing reads
from the D. pseudoobscura Genome Project web page [20]
using as a query each one of the motifs identified in D.
melanogaster surrounded by 300 bp flanking sequences
upstream and downstream from the motif. We considered
a D. pseudoobscura sequencing read as the orthologous one
if there was at least a stretch of 70/100 identical nucleotides. We used a word size of 7 nucleotides and a percent
identity of 70%. If the orthologous region is identified but
the sequencing read does not contain the motif, we search
the D. pseudoobscura genomic region in between conserved
orthologous blocks flanking the motif. To do so, we
search for the contig containing this sequence and align
this region with the D. melanogaster region using diAlign
[25]. (2) If no orthologous region is identified according
to the previous criterion and the 27 bp motif is known to
be within intron sequence in D. melanogaster, we searched
for the D. pseudoobscura orthologous region using the corresponding D. melanogaster whole transcript. In the case of
intergenic regions, we considered only those sequence
contigs that include both genes around the motif, with
one exception; if the motif is present close to the transcript
(<1000 bp) we analyzed 10000 bp of the corresponding
D. pseudoobscura orthologous region.
