Abstract
Background: The human cancer-related nucleoside triphosphatase (HCR-NTPase) is
overexpressed in several tumour tissues including neuroblastoma. HCR-NTPase is an enzyme
exhibiting a slow in vitro activity in hydrolysing nucleosidetriphosphates. However, its in vivo
function is still unknown. To learn more about the physiological role of HCR-NTPase, we both
overexpressed and silenced it in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.
Findings: No effect was observed when the expression of endogenously expressed HCR-NTPase
in the cells was silenced by RNA interference. On the other hand, overexpression of HCR-NTPase
led to cytotoxicity of the protein in SH-SY5Y cells. Even if the catalytic essential amino acid
glutamate 114 was replaced by alanine (E114A-HCR-NTPase), the protein remained cytotoxic. The
results could be confirmed by successfully rescuing the cells via RNA interference.
Conclusion: Although expressed in several tumours, at least in SH-SY5Y, HCR-NTPase is not
essential for the cells to survive. Increased levels of the protein lead to cytotoxicity due to physical
intracellular interactions rather than hydrolysis of nucleosidetriphosphates by its intrinsic residual
enzymatic activity.

Reseach hypothesis
A screen of the cancer genome anatomy project (CGAP)
database [1,2] for expressed sequence tags that compared
to normal tissue are highly expressed in human tumours
revealed the human cancer-related nucleoside triphosphatase (HCR-NTPase) [3]. HCR-NTPase, the gene product of the mRNA NM_032324 (synonyms: MGC13186,
LOC84284, C1orf57, GI:14150100) is described to
exhibit an increased expression profile in liver cholangiocarcinoma when compared to normal tissue [3]. In addi-

tion, as retrieved from SOURCE [4,5] when this project
was initiated, HCR-NTPase was stated to be expressed in
many human tumours, several of them located in the
brain such as medullablastoma, glioblastoma, and neuroblastoma.
A homology search using BLAST [6,7] retrieved significant
sequence homologies between HCR-NTPase and proteins
assigned to COG1618 of the COG database [8]. As a representative of COG1618 proteins, aaTHEP1 from the

hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus was biochemically characterised [9] and its crystal structure was
resolved [10]. Both HCR-NTPase and aaTHEP1 hydrolyse
ATP and GTP in vitro with Km in the micromolar range and
kcat in the range between 5 and 9 × 10-3 s-1 corresponding
to approximately 20–30 molecules hydrolysed per hour
and enzyme molecule. In addition, the proteins resemble
each other in terms of structure. They belong to the class
of P-loop NTPases, and their regular secondary structures
can be superimposed with a backbone RMSD of 2.8 Å [3].
Thus, aaTHEP1 and consequently COG1618 proteins
may serve as model systems for HCR-NTPase.
Analysing the phylogenetic distribution of COG1618 proteins by phylogenetic COG ranking [11,12] reveals that
they are absent from almost all mesophiles and present in
all thermophiles, most of them archeae. In addition,
HCR-ATPase is present in many eucarya analysed thus far.
Therefore, HCR-ATPase and COG1618 proteins are at
least very similar to PACE proteins i. e. proteins from
archaea without assigned function that are conserved in
eukarya as described by Matte-Tailliez et al. [13]. The
authors argue that most of the PACE proteins are informational proteins and could be of strong biomedical interest.
The aim of this study was to obtain further insight into the
role of HCR-NTPase in tumour cells. For that purpose we
investigated the phenotype of the neuroblastoma cell line
SH-SY5Y [14] as a model system for brain tumours under
both conditions overexpressing and silencing HCRNTPase.

Silencing HCR-NTPase in SH-SY5Y by RNA interference
The expression of HCR-NTPase in SH-SY5Y cells was
blocked via RNA interference [15] using pSilencer1.0-U6
(Ambion, Darmstadt, Germany). shRNA coding inserts
flanked by ApaI and EcoRI restriction sites were constructed by phosphorylating 25 pmol of oligonucleotides
(Operon, Cologne, Germany) using T4 poynucleotide
kinase, followed by assembling complementary pairs by
incubation for 5 min at 100°C and 60 min at 37°C.
pSilencer1.0-U6 sequentially was cut by ApaI (Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and EcoRI (Fermentas, St. LeonRot, Germany), the inserts were inserted and the plasmids
were amplified in E. coli SURE (Stratagene, San Diego,
USA). Expression of HCR-NTPase was blocked by transfecting SH-SY5Y cells with purified plasmids. The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used:

siRNA1:
5'-ATC CAT AAA GCC AGT GAT TCT CAA GAG AAA TCA
CTG GCT TTA TGG ATC ATT TTT T-3' and
5'-AAT TAA AAA ATG ATC CAT AAA GCC AGT GAT TTC

Methods
Eucaryotic cell culture and transfections
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells [14] were obtained from
ATCC, Manassas, USA and grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 15% fetal calf serum (growth
medium; GIBCO, Eggenstein, Germany) in a humidified
incubator. To keep the cells in logarithmic growth, confluent cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), detached by 0.05% Trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA in
PBS, followed by washing and diluting them in fresh
growth medium. 106 cells were transfected with 2 μg Plasmid by electroporation in 50 μl of Cell Line Nucleofector
V solution (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). After transfection, cells were washed in growth medium, transferred to
6-well plates and judged microscopically after 24 h of
incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2 using an Axiovert100
microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Red fluorescent cells were analysed at 584 nm and green fluorescent
cells at 482 nm excitation. Three different fields of view
were evaluated for each experiment and all experiments
were performed independently in triplicate.

Overexpressing HCR-NTPase in SH-SY5Y cells
HCR-NTPase cDNA was obtained from RZPD, Berlin, Germany. The gene was amplified and cloned into pET101/
D-TOPO yielding pET101/D-TOPO/HCR-NTPase to
express the protein in E. coli. This construct also served as
the basis for all further cloning steps. HCR-NTPase was

overexpressed using the plasmid pRc/CMV (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany). The gene was amplified from
pET101/D-TOPO/HCR-NTPase using the primers

5'-AAA AGC TTA TGG CCC GGC ACG TGT TCC-3' and
5'-AAA ATC TAG ATC ACT TCC TGC TGC TCT G-3'.
The PCR-fragment was digested sequentially by XbaI (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and HindIII (Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany), inserted into pRc/CMV and
amplified in E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).
HCR-NTPase as a fusion with red fluorescent protein [16]
(HCR-NTPase-RFP) was overexpressed using the plasmid
pmaxFP-Red-C (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). The gene
was amplified from pET101/D-TOPO/HCR-NTPase using
the primers
5'-AAA AGA TCT GGA GGA GGA GGA ATG GCC CGG
CAC GTG TTC-3' and
5'-AAG GTA CCT CAC TTC CTG CTG CTC TG-3'.
Before digesting with BglII (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and KpnI (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), the
PCR-fragment was inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The resulting fragment was
inserted into pmaxFP-Red-C and amplified in E. coli
TOP10. As a control for the efficiency of transfection,
pmaxGFP (QIAGEN) was used. HCR-NTPase was overexpressed by transfecting SH-SY5Y cells with purified plasmids.
Construction of a E114A-HCR-NTPase mutant in pRc/
CMV
An enzymatically inactive HCR-NTPase mutant was constructed by mutating a conserved catalytic glutamate [17].
For that purpose, E114 of HCR-NTPase in pRc/CMV was
replaced by an alanin using the Phusion™ Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) according
to the instructions of the manufacturer. The utilised phosphorylated primers were

5'-P-CGT CAT CGA TGC GAT TGG GAA GA-3' and
5'-P-CAC ACT CTT TGC CCT GGG CCA-3'.
Inhibition of apoptosis
Apoptosis was inhibited by adding the caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK (Promega, Mannheim) to the culture
medium directly after transfection at a final concentration
of 20 μM.

All investigations have been performed in accordance to
German regulatory affairs.

Results
Loss-of-function: silencing HCR-NTPase by RNA
interference
Since HCR-NTPase is overexpressed in neuroblastoma we
were interested in the phenotype of SH-SY5Y if the intrinsic expression of HCR-NTPase was suppressed. For that
purpose we constructed plasmids containing siRNAs
directed to the regions within HCR-NTPase that are
shown in figure 1. Untreated cells and those transfected
with plasmids containing siRNAs were analysed by their
cell counts as judged via phase contrast microscopy. To
show the effect caused by the transfection procedure, cells
transfected with constructs encoding GFP and RFP were
included as controls. As can be seen in figure 2, the cell
counts are reduced by about one fourth by the transfection procedure alone. However, compared to the GFPand RFP-controls the cells remain mainly unaffected
regardless of which siRNA constructs were introduced.
Gain-of-function: overexpressing HCR-NTPase in SHSY5Y
To judge the effect of overexpressed HCR-NTPase in SHSY5Y cells, transfections with different expression plasmids were performed. The cultures were then analysed by
both phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Compared to the controls, HCR-NTPase, a combination of
HCR-NTPase and GFP as well as a fusion product between
HCR-NTPase and RFP (HCR-NTPase-RFP) gave rise to significant fewer cell counts demonstrating HCR-NTPase
mediated cytotoxicity (Figure 3). Table 1 quantitatively
shows the cytotoxic action of HCR-NTPase. The efficiency
of transfection was judged by quantifying fluorescent cells
after being transfected with GFP and RFP containing plasmids. Compared to the total number of cells visible by
phase contrast microscopy, those also showing fluorescence were 80% and 64% for GFP and RFP, respectively.
As can be seen, far less than half of the cells survived if
transfected with either HCR-NTPase or HCR-NTPase-RFP.
Moreover, the fraction of red fluorescent cells after transfection with HCR-NTPase-RFP was negligible, indicating
that the vast majority of surviving cells were untransfected
rather than unaffected by a successful transfection. Similar
results were obtained when the cells were cotransfected
with HCR-NTPase and GFP supporting the presumption
that the surviving cells contained no plasmids.

sequences out of a group of 29 species that have been found to contain Walker A and B motifs similar to those of HCRNTPase [3]. The sequences were from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Aquifex aeolicus (aaTHEP1), Thermophilum pendens, Methanopyrus kandleri, an uncultured archaeon, Sulfolobus tokodaii, and Aeropyrum pernix, respectively.

Rescue of SH-SY5Y cells by RNA interference
To confirm that the expression of HCR-NTPase was
indeed the cause of the observed cell death after transfection with HCR-NTPase containing plasmids, we tried to
rescue the cells by means of RNA interference. Whereas
siRNA1 and siRNA4 showed no effect, siRNA2 significantly increased the survival rate and siRNA3 was even
able to completely rescue the cells yielding the same cell
counts observed when the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding solely RFP or GFP (figure 4).
The E114A-HCR-NTPase mutant
HCR-NTPase belongs to the ASCE (additional strand, catalytic E) class of NTPases [3]. In ASCE NTPases, NTPhydrolysis typically depends on a conserved catalytic
glutamate (E114 in HCR-NTPase and E107 in aaTHEP1).
This essential glutamate is described to prime a water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate [17,21].

Consequently, a mutant protein lacking this essential
glutamate is expected to be catalytically inactive. Such a
mutant was then suitable to decide whether unspecific
intracellular hydrolysis of nucleotides or the physical
interaction with other intracellular compounds is responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. Hence, we constructed
the E114A-HCR-NTPase mutant and expressed it in SHSY5Y cells. As shown in figure 5, the effect of E114A-HCRNTPase on SH-SY5Y cells resembles that one observed
with the wild type protein. Although to a slightly lesser
degree, the cells are killed by E114A-HCR-NTPase and can
be rescued by siRNA3 mediated RNA interference excluding unspecific NTP-hydrolysis as the cause of cytotoxicity.
The cells died due to apoptosis as could be seen morphologically. In addition, as judged by green fluorescence, we
successfully rescued them by the caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK (table 2).
