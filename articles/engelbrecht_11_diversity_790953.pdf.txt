Background
HIV-1 is a major health problem in South Africa with
more than 6 million people infected. One of the features
of the virus is the extreme genetic diversity, resulting in
an uneven distribution of the different viral subtypes.
This diversity may also impact on diagnostic assays,
antiretroviral treatment, prevention and vaccine development. We investigated the diversity and molecular
epidemiology of HIV-1 in the CapeTown area between
1984 and 2010.
Materials and methods
Patient samples were collected from the Cape Town
area between 1984 and 2010. HIV-1 RNA was extracted,
amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. High resolution
phylogenetic analysis was used to investigate the molecular epidemiology and introduction of HIV-1 into
South Africa. Maximum Likelihood trees were inferred
in PhyMLv3.0 with the best nucleotide substitution
model for each dataset. Bayesian genealogies were
inferred in BEAST v1.6.1 using different substitution
models, a relaxed molecular clock and different coalescent priors. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
chain was run for 10,000,000 generations with sampling
every 10,000th generation using super computer clusters.
Results were visualized in Tracer v1 .5.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis indicated two different epidemics
in Cape Town: HIV-1 subtypes B and D in homosexual
men and subtype C in the heterosexual population.
Molecular clock and likelihood mapping analysis indicated that HIV-1 subtype C was introduced in South
Africa, dating back to the 1960-1970s, much earlier than

previously thought. More recent samples also indicated
that the epidemic is evolving with the frequent detection
of unique recombinant forms (URFs) which may be the
precursors of emerging CRFs in the future.

Conclusion
The detection of URFs may indicate a change in the
dynamics of the predominant subtype C epidemic in
South Africa. It is essential to study HIV-1 in order to
improve our knowledge of these viruses and to obtain a
better understanding of the viruses in circulation in
South Africa.
