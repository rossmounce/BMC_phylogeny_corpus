Abstract
Background: The unusual heterodimeric leishmanial DNA topoisomerase IB consists of a large
subunit containing the phylogenetically conserved "core" domain, and a small subunit harboring the
C-terminal region with the characteristic tyrosine residue in the active site. RNAi silencing of any
of both protomers induces a non-viable phenotype in the hemoflagelate Trypanosoma brucei.
Unfortunately, this approach is not suitable in Leishmania where gene replacement with an
antibiotic marker is the only approach to generate lack-of-function mutants. In this work, we have
successfully generated null mutants in the small subunit of the L. major DNA topoisomerase IB using
two selection markers, each conferring resistance to hygromycin B and puromycin, respectively.
Results: We have successfully replaced both topS loci with two selection markers. However, to
achieve the second transfection round, we have had to rescue the null-homozygous with an
episomal vector carrying the Leishmania major topS gene. Phenotypic characterization of the L. major
rescued strain and a L. major strain, which co-overexpresses both subunits, shows few differences
in DNA relaxation and camptothecin cytotoxicity when it was compared to the wild-type strain.
Studies on phosphatidylserine externalization show a poor incidence of camptothecin-induced
programmed cell death in L. major, but an effective cell-cycle arrest occurs within the first 24 h. SPhase delay and G2/M reversible arrest was the main outcome at lower concentrations, but
irreversible G2 arrest was detected at higher camptothecin pressure.
Conclusion: Results obtained in this work evidence the essentiality of the topS gene encoding the
L. major DNA topoisomerase IB small subunit. Reversibility of the camptothecin effect points to the
existence of effective checkpoint mechanisms in Leishmania parasites.

Background
Leishmania major is the aetiological agent of cutaneous
leishmaniasis, a zoonotic neglected tropical disease characterized by the presence of ulcerative skin lesions at the

mosquito's bite-place [1]. The existing first-line therapies
based on pentavalent antimonium salts are antiquated
and toxic [2]. Paromomycin-based ointments and triazole
antifungal agents (fluconazole, itrakonazole and ketocoPage 1 of 14

nazole) have variable and limited efficacy [3] whereas, the
clinical trials carried out with the promising alkyl-phospholipid miltefosine [4] are scarce. A very recent report
carried out in Iran concluded that oral miltefosine was
apparently as good as pentavalent antimonium salts for
the treatment of L. major cutaneous leishmaniasis [5].
In this scenario there is an urgent need for new antileishmanial drug targets. DNA topoisomerases (Top) catalyze
changes in the superhelicity of duplex DNA during replication, transcription, recombination and DNA repair
processes [6,7]. Two families and two subfamilies of DNA
topoisomerases play a pivotal role preserving DNA integrity in all living organisms. Type I Top (TopI) are ATPindependent monomeric enzymes introducing transient
single-stranded breaks in DNA, followed by passage and
rejoining. Type II Top (TopII) are multimeric ATP hydrolyzing proteins that generate temporary double-stranded
breaks in the double helix, followed by passage and
rejoining. TopII not only relaxes positively supercoiled
DNA, but also displays catenation/decatenation and knotting/unknotting activities. TopIA subfamily produces
transient covalent bonds at the 5' end of the broken DNA,
whereas TopIB subfamily has a specific cleavage polarity
at the 3' end [8].
Unlike all the organisms studied at present, TopIB from
trypanosomes and leishmanias are heterodimeric
enzymes [9-11]. Genetic analyses identified a gene,
located on the L. donovani chromosome 34, which
encodes a large subunit (LdTopIL) with an estimated
molecular mass of 73 kDa. This protein contains both the
non-conserved N-terminus as well as the conserved central core domain of the enzyme, which includes all the residues that interact with DNA, except the DNA-cleaving
tyrosine. On the other hand, the small subunit (LdTopIS)
is encoded by a second ORF located at chromosome 4.
This ORF encodes a 262-long polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 28-kDa. This polypeptide contains the phylogenetically conserved "SKxxY" motif,
which includes the Tyr-222 that plays a role in DNA cleavage. [12]. This genomic organization was confirmed soon
after in African trypanosomes [13] and two genes encoding for each TopIB protomer are annotated into the T.
cruzi Genome Project [14].
As in most eukaryotic cells, TopIB and TopII are essential
to cell life [15,16]. Enzyme silencing of T. brucei TopII by
small RNA interference (RNAi) produces a singular phenotype lacking kDNA, called dyskinetoplasticy that leads
to cell death [17]. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing
of gene expression of each subunit of TopIB results in a
drastic reduction of both DNA and RNA synthesis in African trypanosomes, mimicking the inhibition of nucleic
acid biosynthesis observed when bloodstream trypano-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/113

somes are treated with the specific inhibitor camptothecin
(CPT) [18].
Inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases represent a major class
of anti-cancer drugs and a growing number of them are in
clinical use [19]. Several studies have shown that CPT has
strong anti-trypanosomal and anti-leishmanial activities
in vitro, inducing DNA-cleavable complexes at the submicromolar range [20]. The outcome of stable DNA cleavage is the generation of single- or double-stranded breaks,
which are believed to cause point mutations, fragmentation of the genome and eventually programmed cell death
(PCD) [21].
Since the mechanism for RNAi-mediated gene attenuation is not functional in Leishmania parasites [22], the generation of null-mutants is only feasible through gene
replacement techniques that warranty the total disruption
of the target gene. The present work describes the phenotype of a null-mutant in the small subunit of the L. major
TopIB, its sensitivity to CPT as well as the PCD induced by
this inhibitor in the aetiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis L. major.

Results
Double targeted gene replacement of LmTopS
To asses the biological involvement of LmTopIB in relaxation of supercoiled DNA and CPT susceptibility, we tried
to create a null-mutant knockout in the topS locus by double-targeted replacement with antibiotic resistant cassettes
[23], which were kindly provided by S.M. Beverley (University of Washington at St. Louis, Mo USA). Since topS
gene encodes the catalytic active site of LmTopIB, the
effective disruption of this gene should nullify the biological function of the entire enzyme. To that purpose, we
created the targeting plasmids pSK-topS-KO-HYG and
pSK-topS-KO-PAC. They contain the respective antibiotic
resistance cassettes flanked by a 1000-bp region that
includes both the 5' and the 3' flanking regions of the topS
gene (Fig. 1A). First, topS-allele was replaced by HYGresistance cassette to create the heterozygous strain
(ΔtopS::HYG). Hybridization with the external probe (EP)
shows a 1.7-kb XhoI fragment present in the genomic
DNA from WT promastigotes and an additional 2.6-kb
fragment corresponding to the effective first allele replacement. Colonies isolated from this heterozygous strain
were perfectly viable and were used to perform the second
replacement round. When this strain was electroporated
with lineal pSK-topS-KO-PAC to create the homozygous
(ΔtopS::HYG/ΔtopS::PAC), a set of double resistant HYG/
PAC colonies were obtained (clones 1 to 5), which were
able to growth under antibiotics selective pressure. Southern analysis of the isolated clones shows that besides the
predicted 2.6 kb corresponding to the first allele replacement, a second 2.2 kb-long band corresponding to the

the 1.7-kb XhoI fragment, which hybridizes with the EP,
still remains, showing an unexpected trisomy in the topS
locus in clones 1, 3, 4 and 5. To remove this band, the heterozygous (ΔtopS::HYG) clone was transfected with the

pXG-topS construct, an episomal plasmid which expresses
the topS through the presence of the DHFR/TS locus of L.
major. This new strain was used for the second replacement. Under these circumstances the 1.7-kb band effectively disappeared from the isolated clones showing only

the 2.2 and 2.6-kb expected bands. They correspond to the
correct homologous integrations upstream and downstream of the topS locus. A Southern analysis of the clones
obtained in these experiments using the whole topS gene
as a probe, shows the effective replacement of both topS
alleles (lanes 8 to 12 of Figure 1C), in addition to the very
intense 3 kb band corresponding to the episomal topS
gene required to complement the topoisomerase deficiency. One clone representing this new L. major strain
was called (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS indicating the rescued
null-topS genotype.
Western analyses from WT, (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS and
LmTopIB overexpressing strains were carried out to assess
the expression rate of the TopIB genes. For this purpose,
heterologous LdTopIL and LdTopIS polyclonal rabbit
antisera were used to hybridize with the transferred proteins after SDS-PAGE. Figure 2A shows the results
obtained after hybridization with LdTopIL antiserum,
which evidences a significant 7-fold increase of the immunoreactive band corresponding to the LmTopIB-overexpressing strain. Figure 2B shows a similar Western blot,
but in this case the nylon membrane was hybridized with
LdTopIS rabbit antiserum, showing a ca. 7-fold overexpression of the small subunit, in both LmTopIB-overexpressing and (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS extracts.
Phenotypic characterization of genetically manipulated L.
major strains
The phenotypic outcome of genetic manipulation on topS
locus was evaluated in the rescued (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS,
LmTopIB overexpressing and WT L. major strains. The
growth rate of these strains was analyzed during a 96 h
span-time, 12 h stepwise, in the presence of different concentrations of CPT (0.5 to 25 μM). The proliferation rate
was measured by cell counting (Fig. 3A–C) using a Coulter apparatus. No significant differences in growth rate
were noticed among the three strains under study. The
higher growth found in the WT promastigotes may be due
either to the genetic manipulation exerted over the other
two strains, or more probably to the continuous antibiotic
selection pressure exerted in the culture medium to maintain the strains. CPT was equally effective on the three
strains; dose-response curves determined after 48 h subpassages provided IC50 values of 0.56 μM, 0.39 μM and
0.30 μM for WT, (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS and LmTopIB overexpressing strains, respectively.

To evaluate the topoisomerase activity displayed by these
leishmanial strains, standard relaxation assays were performed with WT, (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS and LmTopIB overexpressing lysates coming from log-phase cultures. Timecourse (left lanes) and lysate dilution (right lanes) experiments were carried out at 37°C. Under these experimental
conditions a clear distributive relaxation pattern was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/113

obtained (Fig. 5) in the three leishmanial strains. The WT
strain showed the slower and less active relaxation activity
(Fig. 4A). Most of the substrate was relaxed to different
topoisomers but perceptible supercoiled DNA still
remained after 20 min at the higher protein concentration. The relaxation activity of the other two strains was
faster and higher than that shown by the control. Figure
4B shows a fully relaxed DNA after 5 min in the LmTopIBoverexpressing strain, and a 4-fold higher activity (comparing lane 3 in set B with lane 1 in set A). When the
LmTopIB-overexpressing strain was compared with the
rescued (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS knockout (Fig. 4C), no differences in both time and protein dilution were observed. It
is remarkable that the scarce differences in relaxation
activity among strains were in accordance with the lack of
significant differences in CPT cytotoxicity.
To determine the phase of the cell cycle at which CPT
exerts its growth inhibitory effect, exponentially growing
L. major promastigotes were treated with different concentrations of CPT for 24 h and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Submicromolar concentrations of CPT did not appear to
exert any effect. A significant 51% of S-phase arrest
appeared after treatment with 1 μM CPT in the (ΔtopS/
ΔtopS) + topS strain, which was increased up to 64% in the
presence of 50 μM CPT (Fig. 5).
To determine whether or not CPT-induced S-phase arrest
is reversible, L. major promastigotes were treated for 24 h
to induce S-phase arrest. Then CPT was washed out and
cells were further incubated in fresh medium for an additional period of 24 h (R24) or 48 h (R48). CPT-treated WT
cells were able to revert the cell-growth arrest at the lower
drug concentration (5 μM) after 24 h, but the arrest was
irreversible at 50 μM CPT even after 48 h of drug withdrawal (Fig. 6A). In case of LmTopIB-overexpressing and
rescued-mutant (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS strains, CPT induced
irreversible S-phase arrest at any concentration tested
(Figs. 6B and 6C).
Progression of the cell cycle after chemical synchronization was studied in the three L. major promastigotes
strains. The use of 5 mM HU, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, to reversibly arrest DNA synthesis, has
been previously reported [24]. After a 12-h exposure to
HU, the percentages of L. major promastigotes in the different cell cycle phases were: 65% in G1, 23% in S and
12% in G2/M. Promastigotes underwent cell cycle progression after HU removal, being the time required to complete the first cell cycle dependent on the genetic
manipulation carried out into topS locus. Thus, the WT
phenotype needs 24 h to complete a cell cycle; this time
was longer for the LmTopIB-overexpressing strain,
whereas the rescued-mutant (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS completed the cell-cycle progression in a shorter period of 9 h.

PCD at 24 h, we extended the incubation period up to 48
h using 10 μM CPT. Apoptosis was assessed after this time
(Fig. 9). Surprisingly, no significant differences were
observed in the three strains. These results indicate that
CPT is not inducing PCD in L. major cultures under the
experimental conditions using in our lab.

These effects were independent of CPT treatment, which
strongly suggest, that they were due to the genetic manipulation of the strains (Fig. 7).
Quantification of PS externalization in L. major
promastigotes
As a measure of CPT-induced PCD in L. major, a FACS procedure was carried out combining PI/annexin V double
stain. Promastigotes were cultured in presence of different
concentrations of CPT and at different time-points to find
the optimal conditions for PCD. Figure 8 shows the translocation of PS to the outer surface of plasma membrane of
drug-treated promastigotes at 0.1 μM, 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 5 μM
and 10 μM CPT. The three L. major strains used in the
study were incubated with different CPT concentrations
during a period of 24 h and then they were submitted to
the double stain protocol. Panels show a slight increase of
early and late apoptosis (bottom and upper-right sections
of each panel, respectively) regarding the untreated cultures, which barely rose with CPT concentration. This
effect was also studied in the (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS and
LmTopIB-overexpressing strains, which scarcely increased
this parameter. Since CPT did not significantly induce

Double targeted gene replacement is the method of choice
to create defective null-mutants in Leishmania parasites
[22]. A L. major TopIB-null mutant defective in the small
subunit of this enzyme (which contains the DNA-cleaving
tyrosine) was created to assess the role played by this
enzyme in parasite survival and CPT resistance. Since no
colonies were obtained repeatedly after a second round of
replacement, we suspected this gene was essential to Leishmania and its activity was not made up for other Top
enzymes. The outcome of incomplete replacement of
both LmTopIB alleles by selectable antibiotics was the
emergence of trisomies for the topS locus (lanes 1, 3, 4 and
5, Fig. 1), which is a non-atypical phenomenon in kinetoplastids because of the plasticity of their genome [25].
Therefore, we decided to perform a previous transformation with a plasmid carrying the target gene for episomal
expression and genetic complementation before the second round of genomic replacement. In this case, we successfully obtained several colonies, in which the topS
allele was replaced by the antibiotic marker. Essentiality
of TopIB has been described in Drosophila [15] and mouse
[16], where the outcome of TopIB gene disruption is a
dead phenotype. The budding yeast is a remarkable exception to this phenomenon [26]. S. cerevisiae-deficient
TopIB is viable and it is currently used as an important
tool for gene expression of foreign recombinant TopIB,
because the expression of these enzymes in bacteria is difficult and sometimes not feasible.
Gene silencing of TbTopIL and TbTopIS genes was carried
out by Bakshi and Shapiro [18] using RNAi. These authors
found indistinct phenotypes when separately silenced
TbTopIL or TbTopIS genes; detectable reduction in ribosomal RNA as well as in levels of specific messengers,
growth arrest, decrease in total nucleic acid biosynthesis
attributable to reductions in both DNA- and RNA-specific
synthesis. Absolute levels of nuclear and mitochondrial
transcripts were reduced. In L. major the single replacement of one of the alleles originated a heterozygous phenotype that was no differentiable from the WT in both cell
growth and CPT sensitivity.
Neither the promastigotes from the genetically rescued
topS-null mutant nor the ones from TopIB overexpressing
strain, showed different growth rates or significant IC50
values to CPT. These unexpected results correlated well
with the relaxation activities found in the extracts

obtained from the different strains, where scarce differences were accounted. One likely explanation to this finding is the possible degradation of the overexpressed
subunit, unless it is assembled with the large subunit
building an active enzyme. There are evidences showing

that a coordinated expression of both subunits is necessary in African trypanosomes. RNAi silencing of any one
of the TbTopIB protomers causes coordinated loss of both
subunits [18]. The authors have speculated that individual
proteins are stable only in association with each other,
becoming unstable when separated.
Several reports conclude that TopIB overexpression does
not involve higher relaxation activity or CPT susceptibility
in mammalian cells [27]. A recent paper describing the
transfection of human TopIB gene into OVCAR-3 cultures
– an ovarian cancer cell line – shows that, despite an effective seven-fold TopIB overexpression, the sensitivity to
topotecan – a CPT hydrosoluble analogue – was not
improved compared with control untransfected cells [28].
This observation agrees with the similar levels of TopIB
activity found in control and overexpressing cells, pointing to an effective post-translational down-regulation
mechanism that is limiting TopIB activity to supportable
values. These authors were tempted to speculate that
TopIB overexpression produces an alteration in the phosphorylation state of the protein that limits its activity and
prevents improvement of CPT response [29,30]. It is very
likely that the dispensable 40 amino acids-long sequence
comprised between Ser-96 and Ser-135 within the N-terminal extension of LmTopIB small subunit which contains 27 serine residues [31,32], may be suitable of
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes thus acting as a post-translational switch mechanism.
CPT toxicity depends on the ability of DNA repair systems
to restore the basic cellular functions. TopIB overexpression may trigger the repair mechanisms linked to this
enzyme such as tyrosyl diphosphodiesterase I (TdpI),
which prevents the formation of ternary complexes with
DNA in presence of CPT as well as the ubiquitination/
sumoylation pathways [33]. Ubiquitination is a downregulation mechanism that takes place with the hyperphosphorylated enzyme. TopIB degradation by 26S proteasome may be useful to increase tolerance to DNAcleaving poisons, facilitating the phosphodiesterase activity of Tdp1 to excise Top1 from cleaved DNA [34]. On the
other hand, sumoylation seems to be a stimulatory system
via relocation of TopIB from nucleoplasm to the nucleolus preventing the ubiquitin-mediated enzyme degradation [35].
Flow-cytometric analysis of 12 h HU-arrested L. major promastigotes shows a different cell-cycle recovering pattern
after drug withdrawal. The LmTopIB-overexpressing strain
shows a S-phase delay of the cell cycle, which is not fully
completed 24 h after chemical arrest. On the contrary, the
rescued-mutant (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS completes the cell
cycle in a shorter period of 9 h, three hours before the WT.

they were washed and incubated up to 48 h in a CPT-free
medium. No differences were detected amongst the distinct strains at CPT concentrations below submicromolar
range. However, 1 μM CPT produced S-phase delay in WT
and (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS strains and reversible G2 arrest at
5 μM CPT. The constant pressure (up to 24 h) following
CPT removal induces the activation of an S-phase checkpoint in mammalian cells. Checkpoint activation provides additional time for DNA repair before starting a new
cell cycle [36]. Twenty four hours after 5 μM CPT removal
results in a complete recovery of the cell cycle in WT promastigotes, but a large percentage of (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS

LmTopIB-overexpressing
promastigotes
still
remained arrested at G2/M phase. However, 50 μM CPT
produced a clear irreversible arrest in G2/M in the three
strains analyzed.
Like other DNA damaging agents, CPT is an efficient
inducer of PCD [37,38]. Sen and coworkers [39] have

described that CPT-mediated leishmanicidal effect in L.
donovani promastigotes appears after the mitochondrial
function is inhibited, which is in turn followed by an
increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. These
authors showed that CPT increases the intracellular concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), with the concomitant rise in lipid peroxidation and decline in the
concentration of the free radical scavenger glutathione. In
a second report, these authors described the involvement
of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage in CPT-mediated apoptosis after depletion of
intracellular K+ and DNA fragmentation, in the same time
span [40]. These results were no reproducible in L. major
promastigotes under the assay conditions expressed in
Materials and Methods. Expanded time points and concentrations were not able to produce the effects described
by these authors. Unlike the aforementioned results,
where more than 50% apoptosis was found after an early
4-h exposure to 5 μM CPT, we could only detect – using
the PS/PI double stain assay – a scant 12% apoptosis after
48 h exposure to CPT. According to the current knowledge
on trypanosomatids genome, the apoptosis pathway
described by the authors downstream CPT-induced ROS
production, is very unlikely. No genes involved in the caspase cascade and PARP cleavage have been annotated in
the Leishmania genome Project and the metacaspase-like
proteins recently described are not responsible for the caspase-like activities in PCD [37,41]. Time and concentration experiments showed that the episomal
overexpression of the complete LmTopIB had poor
impact in CPT-mediated L. major apoptosis. These results
disagree with previous experiments carried out in COS
cells transfected with the yeast topIB encoding gene
(ScTopIB), since CPT treatment resulted in preferential
killing via apoptosis of those cells expressing the yeast
enzyme rather than in "mock" transfected cells [42]. A
possible explanation of these differences might consist in
the high differences in relaxation activity (ca. 100-fold)
produced by the transient transfection of ScTopIB gene in
COS cells.

Conclusion
The topS gene is essential for L. major survival, since the
previous genetic rescue with an episomal plasmid carrying
the topS gene was necessary to obtain a complete double
replacement of both topS alleles. Rescued (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) +
topS and LmTopIB-overexpressing strains had no characteristic phenotype in both relaxation activity and CPT
resistance. This lack of phenotype can be due to posttranslational modifications or because the threshold that
may be needed to alter its function was not reached. However, CPT treatment and subsequent removal produced a
recovery of the arrested cell-cycle in G2/M, which was
delayed in the overexpressing strain. The poor CPTinduced PCD observed in the three L. major promastigote

each time point, and DNA content was analyzed.

strains suggests alternative cytotoxic mechanisms other
than those previously shown in L. donovani.

Methods
Parasite cultures
L. major LV39c5 promastigotes (WT strain) were cultured
at 26°C in M199 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS).
Drug solutions
CPT (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis USA) was dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mM final concentration
and stored at -20°C.
Cloning of LdTopS and LdTopL genes and molecular
constructs
The gene encoding the catalytic subunit of LmTopIB (topS
a 789-bp fragment) was amplified by PCR from L. major
genomic DNA using the primers 5'-tcccccgggccaccATGCAGCCTGTTCAAAGTCCT-3',
and
5'-cgcggatcctcaaaaatcgaagttctcggc-3' (capitalized letters are from topS).
Sequence of these primers was extracted from the L. major

Genome Database [43]. The resulting fragment was
digested with SmaI and BamHI and cloned into the expression vector pXG [44] to make pXG-topS. The integrity of
this plasmid was confirmed by sequencing.
Two topS deletion constructs were created: pSK-topS-KOHYG and pSK-topS-KO-PAC. The topS ORF upstream
(UST) and downstream (DST) sequences (1.0 kb each)
were amplified by PCR using primers that incorporated
restriction sites suitable for subsequent insertion into the
polylinker region of the pSK Bluescript (Stratagene) vector
in a "head-to-tail" manner. The DNA fragments corresponding to hygromycine B (HYG) and puromycin (PAC)
selection antibiotics were based on the Leishmania expression vector series pXG-HYG and pXG-PAC [45]. HYG and
PAC ORFs were obtained by digestion with BamHI and
SpeI and cloned in between the UST and DST sequences of
the topS ORF. The resulting constructs (pSK-topS-KOHYG, and pSK-topS-KO-PAC) were digested with NotIEcoRV to obtain linear topS deletion fragments (3.0 kb for
HYG-cassette and 2.6 kb for PAC-cassette, respectively).

Analysis of DNA content in L. major promastigotes after reversible arrest with HU. Cells obtained from 12 h-arrest with 5 mM
HU (time 0) were harvested and incubated in fresh media in presence or absence of 5 μM CPT. After the time periods indicated, cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by flow-cytometry. The graphs represent the relative PI fluorescence plotted against the frequency of events per channel. Each plot represents data collected from 20,000 events/sample.

LmTopL encoding gene corresponds to the large DNAbinding subunit of leishmanial TopIB. It was amplified
from L. major genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides 5'tcccccgggccaccATGAAGGTGGAGAATAGCAAGATG-3'
and 5'-cgcggatccCTACACCCTCAAAGCTGCAAGAGG-3'
(capitalized letters are from topL). The resulting fragment
was digested with SmaI-BamHI and cloned into the
expression vector pXG-HYG, thus constituting the plasmid pXG-HYG-topL. An overexpressing LmTopIB strain
was obtained by double transformation with pXG-topS
and pXG-HYG-topL.
Deletion of the L. major topS gene
In order to replace first topS allele, L. major WT promastigotes, were grown up to 5 × 106 per ml, washed in cold

cytomix (120 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 10 mM K2HPO4,
25 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2) [46]
and resuspended in the same solution at a concentration
of 1 × 108 promastigotes per ml. Five hundred-microliter
aliquots were electroporated twice with 5 μg of the linear
3.0-kb NotI-EcoRV topS::HYG fragment (1.5 kV, 25 μF
using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II apparatus) in 0.4 cm electrode gap cuvettes, transferred to 10 ml of M199 plus 10%
FCS and incubated at 26°C for 8 h in absence of antibiotics. Cells were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended
in 100 μl of fresh M199 plus 10% FCS and plated on semisolid medium containing 30 μg/ml HYG. Heterozygotes
showing the replacement of one of the alleles topS (+/-)
were subjected to the second round of gene disruption.
With this purpose, they were electroporated with 5 μg of

(topS-1–5) that grew in the presence of 30 μg/ml HYG and
30 μg/ml PAC were selected as topS-null mutants
(ΔtopS::HYG/ΔtopS::PAC). Successful integration of both
cassettes was achieved in four out of the five clones. However, the replacement of the topS alleles was incomplete in
all the clones.
A new approach to get a double gene replacement was carried out using topS heterozygous clones, which were transfected with pXG-topS. Those clones that were resistant to
30 μg/ml HYG and 10 μg/ml G418 were selected and
named (-/+)/+ topS. This new clone was used to perform
the second round of gene disruption. Electroporation was
performed with 5 μg of the 2.6-kb NotI-EcoRV topS::PAC
fragment. Five clones that grew in the presence of 30 μg/

ml HYG, 10 μg/ml G418 and 30 μg/ml PAC were selected
as rescued topS-null mutants (ΔtopS::HYG/ΔtopS::PAC) +
topS, (this strain will be called: (ΔtopS/ΔtopS) + topS from
now on), since they have the episomal plasmid pXG-topS.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting
L. major promastigotes were harvested at different times
during the growth and washed twice with PBS. After sonication and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the
supernatant was removed. Five micrograms of protein
from each time point were diluted in the loading buffer
(60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by
SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide, 2.7% bisacrylamide). Proteins were electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes
(Sigma) for 12 h at 25–30 V/cm, and the blots were

1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with a UV transilluminator.
Flow-cytometric analysis of DNA content
For flow-cytometric analysis, 4 × 106 promastigotes were
harvested by centrifugation at 660 × g, washed twice with
PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of fixative solution (30% PBS/
70% methanol) and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Afterwards,
parasites were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in
PBS containing 20 μg/ml of RNaseA (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of
citrate buffer (45 mM MgCl2, 30 mM sodium citrate, 20
mM Mops, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100), and stained by
the addition of 50 μg of propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, U.S.A.) followed by incubation at 37°C for 20
min. Fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry on
an FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA, U.S.A.).

Cell cycle synchronization and CPT treatment
For the synchronization of DNA replication, exponentially growing L. major promastigotes (5 × 106 cells/ml)
were arrested with 5 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 12 h.
Afterwards parasites were harvested, washed twice with
PBS and resuspended in fresh medium for 2 h before use.
Cells were then treated with 5 μM CPT for 75 min and
finally incubated in a CPT-free medium for the time indicated in the scheme of Figure 10.
Determination of apoptosis
Apoptosis was detected by translocation of phosphatidyl
serine (PS) to the cell surface with the annexin V-FITC reagent (BD Pharmigen). Fraction of annexin V-positive cells
was measured with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA).
