Phylogeography of a successful aerial disperser: the
golden orb spider Nephila on Indian Ocean islands
Matjaž Kuntner1,2* and Ingi Agnarsson1,2,3

Abstract
Background: The origin and diversification patterns of lineages across the Indian Ocean islands are varied due to
the interplay of the complex geographic and geologic island histories, the varying dispersal abilities of biotas, and
the proximity to major continental landmasses. Our aim was to reconstruct phylogeographic history of the giant
orbweaving spider (Nephila) on western Indian Ocean islands (Madagascar, Mayotte, Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues),
to test its origin and route of dispersal, and to examine the consequences of good dispersal abilities for
colonization and diversification, in comparison with related spiders (Nephilengys) inhabiting the same islands, and
with other organisms known for over water dispersal. We used mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (ITS2) markers to
examine phylogenetic and population genetic patterns in Nephila populations and species. We employed Bayesian
and parsimony methods to reconstruct phylogenies and haplotype networks, respectively, and calculated genetic
distances, fixation indices, and estimated clade ages under a relaxed clock model.
Results: Our results suggest an African origin of Madagascar Nephila inaurata populations via Cenozoic dispersal,
and the colonization of the Mascarene islands from Madagascar. We find evidence of gene flow across Madagascar
and Comoros. The Mascarene islands share a common ‘ancestral’ COI haplotype closely related to those found on
Madagascar, but itself absent, or as yet unsampled, from Madagascar. Each island has one or more unique
haplotypes related to the ancestral Mascarene haplotype. The Indian Ocean N. inaurata are genetically distinct from
the African populations.
Conclusions: Nephila spiders colonized Madagascar from Africa about 2.5 (0.6-5.3) Ma. Our results are consistent
with subsequent, recent and rapid, colonization of all three Mascarene islands. On each island, however, we
detected unique haplotypes, consistent with a limited gene flow among the islands subsequent to colonization, a
scenario that might be referred to as speciation in progress. However, due to relatively small sample sizes, we
cannot rule out that we simply failed to collect Mascarene haplotypes on Madagascar, a scenario that might imply
human mediated dispersal. Nonetheless, the former interpretation better fits the available data and results in a
pattern similar to the related Nephilengys. Nephilengys, however, shows higher genetic divergences with
diversification on more remote islands. That the better disperser of the two lineages, Nephila, has colonized more
islands but failed to diversify, demonstrates how dispersal ability can shape both the patterns of colonization and
formation of species across archipelagos.

Background
Oceanic islands are convenient models for studying dispersal of biotas and for understanding how dispersal ability relates to speciation [1]. Questions concerning the
origination and diversification of lineages across the Indian
Ocean islands are fascinating because of the interplay of

the complex geographic and geologic history of the
islands, the varying dispersal abilities of local biotas, and
the proximity to major continental landmasses, Africa and
Asia, with dramatically different biotas. Madagascar, for
example contains both the lineages of vicariant origin and
those arriving via more recent Cenozoic dispersal, and a
mixture of African, Asian, and even Australasian elements

contain lineages that have dispersed there, but the source

continents, as well as Madagascar, and other islands. The
distribution and diversity of lineages across volcanic
islands will, to a large degree, be a function of dispersal
ability of lineages, with better dispersers occupying more
of the islands. However, the fact that good dispersers
occur on more islands does not necessarily mean that they
are also more diverse across archipelagos. One of the key
questions surrounding dispersal is to ‘determine the
impact of dispersal distances and [for spiders] ballooning
propensity on gene flow and speciation...” [5]. Gene flow is
more rapidly disrupted in poor dispersers because even
narrow barriers can be effective isolators [6,7]. Hence, processes of allopatric speciation are expected to start operating earlier in poor dispersers.
Many spiders are excellent dispersers, such that they
have colonized and diversified across archipelagos worldwide. Therefore, spiders have played a prominent role as
study organisms in the island diversification and biogeography [8-16]; however, none of these studies had a focus
on the Indian Ocean apart from Madagascar and Comoros
[10,17]. Here we study a lineage of an excellent disperser,
the giant golden orb weaving spiders (genus Nephila), and
compare and contrast its colonization route, as well as the
distribution and diversity of this lineage with that of a
poorer disperser, its sister lineage Nephilengys [18]. The
giant golden orb weaving spiders (genus Nephila) are distributed pantropically and represent conspicuous elements
of tropical terrestrial invertebrate faunas [19]. Compared
with Nephilengys, Nephila species are much more widespread (Table 1) having colonized most land masses
except the most remote oceanic islands such as Hawaii,
Galapagos, and Polynesia. Precise mechanisms of Nephila
dispersal are not documented; however, orb weavers generally disperse by wind travel termed ‘ballooning’ [5],
which is likely also true for Nephila [20]. Nephila populations are found on most islands of the Indian Ocean, e.g.
Madagascar, the Comoro chain, Aldabra and Seychelles, as
well as the Mascarene archipelago, from Réunion through
Mauritius to Rodrigues (Figure 1) [21].
Recently, we investigated biogeographic and diversification patterns of Nephilengys in this region, and found that
its diversity had been underestimated [18]. We found that
the patterns of Nephilengys phylogenetic and population
genetic structure indicate a Cenozoic colonization of
Madagascar from Africa, with a subsequent colonization
of, and diversification in, more remote islands. Thus, two
of the three volcanic Mascarene islands, Réunion and
Mauritius, harbour an endemic species each, whereas the
populations on Mayotte (part of the Comoro chain) are
intermixed with those on Madagascar. Compared to
Nephilengys, Nephila inhabits one additional island in the
Mascarenes, namely Rodrigues, a small and isolated volcanic island (109 km2, 560 km east of Mauritius; Figure 1).
On Rodrigues, Nephila is thought to be represented by an

status of both N. inaurata and N. ardentipes requires testing with molecular data.
Within this study, we were interested in a comparison
of biogeography and diversification patterns between
Nephila and Nephilengys on the same islands in the
Indian Ocean. Because they represent sister genera
[19,22] they are of comparable ages, and thus likely to
follow comparable geological histories. We predicted that
Nephila would follow a colonization pattern from Africa
on to Madagascar and further onto remoter islands, as
does Nephilengys [18]. Secondly, we aimed to compare
patterns of diversification in both genera by an analysis
of genetic structure of populations on each island, with a
particular focus on the status of N. ardentipes on Rodrigues. Third, we aimed to compare the modes and success
of dispersal between Nephila and Nephilengys on these
islands. Given that Nephila is globally much wider spread
than Nephilengys (Table 1), we predicted that Nephila
would inhabit more islands in the Indian Ocean, and

would exhibit a higher level of gene flow among these
islands. Finally, we were interested in comparing the biogeographic patterns of Nephila on the Indian Ocean
islands with those of other aerially dispersed organisms,
in order to detect common causes [23].

Results
TCS reconstructed haplotype networks from both genes
suggest either gene flow persisted until recently among
populations on all islands (Figure 1), or a recent simultaneous colonization of all three Mascarene islands took
place from Madagascar. None of these networks, however, connect to the N. inaurata populations on the
African mainland in the 95% connection limit of TCS.
Some haplotypes are shared between several islands, e.g.
Réunion and Mauritius (ITS2), Mayotte and Madagascar
(CO1), and Rodrigues, Mauritius and Réunion (CO1).
The ITS2 haplotype found on Rodrigues is unique

network.
Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic analyses (Figure 2)
of both genes independently, as well as a combined analysis, suggest that the Indian Ocean Nephila are monophyletic and sister to N. inaurata from mainland Africa.
Further, we find a clade with the populations from
Réunion, Mauritius, and Rodrigues, separate from a mixed
Madagascar plus Mayotte clade (with very low support),
or grade. The population from Rodrigues is recovered
monophyletic, and that clade receives strong support
(Figure 2).
FST estimates among each of these islands show strong
geographical genetic structuring, yet are consistent with a
recent gene flow within and between the islands or a
recent colonization of the Mascarenes (FST = 0.502, p <
0.001). Maximal uncorrected genetic distance (CO1)
between the populations in Madagascar and the Mascarenes was about 1.5% and between Réunion and Mauritius
was 0.6%, while the maximal uncorrected genetic distance between Madagascar and the African N. inaurata
was about 5.5%. These Nephila genetic distances are

significantly lower than those in the genus Nephilengys
(Table 2).
BEAST analysis estimates the age of the node separating African and island populations at 2.46 (0.60 to 5.35)
Ma, and the ages of other, less inclusive nodes, at less
than 2 Ma (Figure 2). These estimates of node ages
clearly rule out Gondwanan origin of Nephila on Madagascar and the neighbouring islands.
Together, the phylogenies, haplotype networks, fixation
indices, and genetic divergences with clade dating are
consistent with an African origin of the Madagascar

populations via Cenozoic dispersal, and with a subsequent
and rapid dispersal from Madagascar to the Mascarenes.
However, the shallow genetic divergences indicate either
occasional periods of gene flow, or a very recent colonization of the Mascarenes, such that populations on all
islands are best characterized as belonging to a single taxonomic species, N. inaurata. Due to limited sampling we
cannot rule out that haplotypes found in Mascarenes also
occur on Madagascar, thus further sampling is necessary
to test the observed patterns.

Discussion
We studied phylogeographic patterns of the giant orb
web spider, Nephila, on the islands of the Indian Ocean,
and investigated how these compare with related spiders
and with other organisms known for long range, over
ocean dispersal. We sampled Nephila on the islands
Mayotte, Madagascar, Réunion, Mauritius and Rodrigues,
and tested the route and timing of their oceanic origin,
genetic structure among the islands, and the status of the
enigmatic Rodrigues population, which is sometimes
referred to as a separate species, N. ardentipes [19,21].
We found phylogenetic and population genetic structures
based on nuclear (ITS2) and mitochondrial markers
(CO1) to be consistent with a dispersal model from the
African mainland, and a recent and rapid colonization of
the Mascarenes, or a recent termination of gene flow
between Madagascar and Mascarene populations. Taxonomically, all targeted populations are thus best circumscribed as one species, N. inaurata, which invalidates
N. ardentipes as a species. However, the Rodrigues population is monophyletic and has a unique ITS2 haplotype,
and the other Mascarene islands have also started accumulating unique haplotypes. This might be consistent
with a ‘speciation in progress’ scenario. Another possibility cannot be completely ruled out, that all haplotypes
also occur on Madagascar but that we failed to sample
Mascarene haplotypes from Madagascar. However, we
find this unlikely given the structure of the data, the
number of unique haplotypes on the Mascarenes, and the
fact that Nephila is not synanthrophic in the area and
thus not likely human transported.
Nephila has colonized at least 40 major islands and land
masses globally (Table 1), and many species within this
clade are extremely widespread. The best examples are the
American N. clavipes spanning from North America
through Central and South America into Argentina, the
African mainland N. fenestrata and N. senegalensis covering most of the continent, and the Australasian N. pilipes,
which ranges from India to Solomon Islands, and from
Japan to Australia [20,21,24]. Such large ranges are unusual for invertebrates, and hint at excellent dispersal abilities and ecological success. Although not empirically
observed to balloon [5,25], we find ballooning, most likely

Page 5 of 9

at the earliest ontogenetic stages, to be the most logical
explanation for Nephila colonizing remote islands. Since
Nephila spiders are not synanthropic (as are, e.g., some
species of the sister genus, Nephilengys), the travel among
islands by human assistance is unlikely. This conclusion is
supported by the timing of inferred colonization of the
Indian Ocean islands, which vastly predates human settlement at slightly over 2000 years ago.
Perhaps the apparently high dispersal abilities have limited Nephila diversification by maintaining gene flow
among even geographically distant populations. The taxonomy of Nephila is well studied and the genus is hypothesized to contain only 14 species globally [[21,22]; this
paper]. Although its sister genus, Nephilengys, is even less
diverse globally, it invites a direct comparison within the
region of study. We also studied the speciation patterns of
the Nephilengys populations on the same islands [18], and
found molecular, biogeographical and morphological evidence for three species: Ng. livida inhabiting Madagascar
and Comoros, Ng. borbonica endemic to Réunion, and Ng.
dodo from Mauritius. Nephila and Nephilengys show comparable biogeographic histories - both lineages occupied
Madagascar from Africa between 2 and 5 Ma (although
the upper bound estimates for Nephilengys are 13 Ma), and
other smaller islands more recently, after which Nephilengys diversified through a lack of gene flow, while
Nephila diverged less, with the only deep divergencies
occurring between the African mainland and the population across the Indian Ocean as a whole (Table 2). Combined, the comparable timing of initial colonization of the
Indian Ocean by both lineages and the subsequent speciation and lack of gene flow in Nephilengys rule out the
potential human assisted travel to remote islands in
Nephilengys.
The third nephilid spider genus inhabiting some of these
islands is Clitaetra, known from Madagascar, Comoros,
Sri Lanka and mainland Africa [26,27]. Clitaetra are much
smaller spiders that inhabit forest trees, and probably are
poor dispersers. Consequently, Comoros are inhabited by
an endemic species, as apparently the belt of sea between
Mayotte and Madagascar 300 km wide presents enough of
a barrier to prevent gene flow. Judging by the number of
landmasses occupied by each lineage, Clitaetra is a poor
disperser and Nephila a very successful one, while Nephilengys, as an intermediate disperser, is the most diverse of
the three across the Indian Ocean archipelago. Better dispersers can colonize more islands, but also require larger
distances to effectively prevent gene flow, while poor dispersers only rarely reach less isolated islands with few
opportunities to diversify [6,14]. Does this simple model
hold for other organisms on these islands?
Recent literature provides compelling evidence for the
origin of the majority of the Indian Ocean island biotas
via Cenozoic dispersal rather than via vicariant origin

Kuntner and Agnarsson BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/119

on ancient Gondwanan landmasses [[2,4,18]; but, see
[3]]. Thus, the best explanation for the origin of most
biotas on the islands is that their ancestors must have
arrived relatively recently, when the landmasses were in,
or close to today’s position, having mainly arrived from
Africa, but also with elements from Asia and Australasia. The modes of dispersal must be either aerial, rafting
on ocean, or a mix of both, and in some cases, assisted
by human transport [28]. We argue that Nephila and
Nephilengys spiders fall in the category of aerial dispersers, with no evidence of human transport among
islands in the region.
Aerial transport, either active or passive with wind, is
probably the best understood mode of dispersal. Several
groups of flying animals have colonized the Indian Ocean
islands and speciated there, but their origin varies. Logically, the oceans present the least of a barrier to birds and
bats. For example, oscine passerines dispersed from Australia to Asia, and on over the Indian Ocean to Africa,
where they radiated [29]. Parrots reached the Mascarenes
from India [30], and Triaenops bats colonized Madagascar
from Africa several times resulting in several independent
lineages there [31]. Another group of organisms that disperse by wind are flying insects; in allodapine bees for
example, there is a pervasive pattern of African Miocene
origin with several dispersal events onto Madagascar, to
Asia, and to Australia [32]. These authors concluded that
the bees possess the ability to cross large expanses of
ocean via west drift wind, and did not exclude the potential of over water rafting over the Mozambique Channel
between Africa and Madagascar. Apparently, for flying
insects, the Mozambique Channel (just over 400 km wide)
presents only a moderate barrier to dispersal. To dragonflies over ocean wind dispersal presents little difficulty as
evidenced by wind assisted colonization of the Indian
Ocean islands from Asia [33].
Terrestrial and freshwater groups, both of presumed
lower dispersal abilities compared with aerial dispersers,
have also occupied most of the islands that we studied, e.
g. lizards [34-38] and frogs [28]. These groups probably
used rafting on ocean as means of dispersal. Chameleons,
once believed to be of Gondwanan origin on Madagascar,
have in fact colonized Madagascar over the ocean where
they subsequently radiated [34]. They then spread to
Comoros and Seychelles, where they also speciated. One
species is thought to have recently colonized Réunion
where it has accumulated morphological differences from
the source population in Madagascar. In each case, over
water dispersal events occur frequently enough to allow
colonization of several islands not followed by extinction,
but rare enough such that colonization events immediately restrict gene flow and eventually lead to speciation.
Coastal lizards (genus Cryptoblepharus) are globally distributed in Asia and the islands around Madagascar,

Page 6 of 9

where they diversified, then separately colonized the East
African coast, the Comoros islands and Mauritius, but
not Réunion or Rodrigues [38]. This suggests the occurrence of occasional over water dispersal, which is rare
enough to lead to speciation even on islands separated by
small bodies of water. Phelsuma geckos show higher speciation rates [35,36] with a species rich radiation confined
to Madagascar, from where a colonization event to the
Mascarenes is dated at 4-5 Ma, followed by speciation on
all the islands: three endemic species are known from
Réunion, five on Mauritius and three on Rodrigues, of
which two are extinct [36]. These studies suggest that
over ocean dispersal in lizards is possible but rare, and
these relatively poor dispersing abilities facilitate speciation in the absence of recent gene flow.
The above examples of groups with good (aerial) dispersers versus moderate (rafting) dispersers provide us with
the following comparison of radiation success: Birds as the
best dispersers have colonized all the Mascarene islands,
but have not radiated [4,30]. Triaenops fruit bats, also
good dispersers, have repeatedly colonized Madagascar
and adjacent islands in the relatively recent past, but
remain species poor [31], presumably due to continuous
gene flow. Among the best insect dispersers, dragonflies,
colonized all the islands but only diversified very moderately [33]. Rafting dispersers, presumably of medium dispersal abilities, are present in almost all the islands, and
exhibit some exceptionally diverse radiations (chameleons
on Madagascar and Phelsuma geckos throughout the
archipelago, see above). Terrestrial mammals and amphibians, presumably poor dispersers, are entirely absent
from the Mascarenes [30], but have radiated in Madagascar after reaching it during rare dispersal events: lemurs,
rodents, tenrecs and carnivores radiated on Madagascar
(reviewed by [4]). The common pattern seems to be analogous to the Nephila-Nephilengys-Clitaetra example that
we studied. Therefore, the model of intermediate dispersal
abilities underlying diversification across archipelagos
seems to be also supported by the data from organisms
other than spiders. The well-known trend of good dispersers losing their dispersal ability subsequent to colonizing
islands also may lead to speciation events, another example where somewhat reduced dispersal ability positively
correlates with diversification across archipelagos. Of
course, a broader comparison would be needed to better
test the validity of this speciation model, which is beyond
our scope here.

Conclusions
Both the island area and the amount of gene flow
between islands affect speciation rates on remote islands
[7]. We summarize evidence for several groups of terrestrial organisms that have successfully dispersed over the
Indian Ocean islands being borne with wind or carried

Kuntner and Agnarsson BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/119

on oceanic rafts. Yet the Mozambique Channel represents a significant barrier to gene flow for most of these
colonizers resulting in subsequent speciation on Madagascar, and through the Indian Ocean islands. In orbweb
spiders, ballooning is the best understood mode of dispersal, and although the literature fails to demonstrate
Nephila dispersal via ballooning, we agree with other
authors [20,25] that Nephila must do so. Nephila appears
to disperse more readily to isolated islands than Nephilengys. We find evidence that either its populations in the
remote Indian Ocean islands have maintained some limited gene flow with the remaining island populations
until recently, or that they have colonized all three Mascarene islands very recently, such that N. ardentipes is
best treated as synonymous with N. inaurata. On the
other hand, in Nephilengys, dispersal to remote Mascarene islands resulted in speciation [18]. This mirrors the
patterns of Nephila biogeography elsewhere in the tropics, e.g. in Australasia [20,39]. The global picture where
Nephila is spread over more than twice the land masses
compared to Nephilengys (Table 1) yet exhibits lower
levels of genetic divergences among these islands compared to Nephilengys (Table 2), reinforces this conclusion. In sum, the patterns in two sister spider lineages,
Nephila and Nephilengys, and in other taxa suggest that
excellent dispersers may colonize more islands but diversify less. This hints at how dispersal ability can shape
both the patterns of colonization and formation of
species across archipelagos.

Methods
Nephila specimens were collected in the field into 95%
ethanol on the islands Mayotte, Réunion, Mauritius,
Rodrigues and from two localities in Madagascar (Additional file 1). To test the origin of Indian Ocean Nephila,
samples of N. inaurata were obtained from S and E Africa,
in addition to outgroup Nephila species represented by the
African N. constricta and N. turneri and the Australasian
N. pilipes as the primary outgroup (Additional file 1). Voucher specimens will be deposited at the National Museum
of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution.
We isolated DNA from each individual’s leg with the
QIAGEN DNAeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia,
CA), and amplified fragments of one mitochondrial (COI)
and one nuclear (ITS2) locus using the LCOI1490 [40]
and C1-N-2776 [41] primer pair for COI, and the ITS5.8S (FITS) and ITS-28S (RITS) pair [42] for ITS2. These
genes were chosen as readily amplifiable markers that
have been shown to be useful at shallow taxonomic levels
[43-45], and that represent both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. We used standard protocols [43-46] with
47°C annealing temperature for 30 cycles. The PCR products were sequenced by the Sequencing and Genotyping
facility of the University of Puerto Rico. Sequences were

submitted to Genbank (Additional file 1). Our inability to
obtain both CO1 and ITS2 sequences for all terminals was
likely due to amplification of Nephila symbionts by universal ITS2 primers.
Sequences were inferred using Phred and Phrap to read
and assemble the reads, respectively [47,48] through the
Chromaseq package test version 0.984 [49] in the evolutionary analysis program Mesquite 2.74 [50]. We ran Phred
using default options, and used Phrap with options -qual_show 20 -vector_bound 0. We trimmed sequence ends in
Chromaseq using a moving window analysis: the Wrst window of 10 bases within which at least 6 were above quality
score 20 was used as the start or end of the sequence. If a
site had secondary peaks at least 0.3 the height of the primary peak, it was treated as ambiguous. Subsequently the
sequences were proofread by comparing them with the
chromatograms by eye. For alignments we used ClustalW
[51] via Mesquite, with gap opening and extension costs
set at 24/6. For both COI and ITS2 the alignments were
unambiguous, the former with no gaps, and the latter with
only a few, unambiguously placed gaps. Further exploration
of alignment parameters was therefore not necessary. The
alignment of both genes is available as Additional file 2.
We constructed haplotype networks in a statistical
parsimony framework using TCS [52]. We calculated
population genetic structure in Arlequin 3.5 [53], and
uncorrected genetic distances in Mesquite.
The appropriate substitution model was selected with
jModeltest 0.1.1 [54] using the AIC criterion [55] to select
among the 24 models implemented in MrBayes. The best
models were HKY+Γ+I for COI and HKY+Γ for ITS2
[56]. Bayesian analysis of the two loci combined was performed using MrBayes V3.1.2 [57]. The characters of each
partition were 1-1226 (COI) and 1227-1541 (ITS2). The
Markov chain Monte Carlo was run with four chains for
10,000,000 generations, sampling the Markov chain every
1000 generations, and the sample points of the first
5,000,000 generations were discarded as ‘’burnin”.
We estimated node ages using BEAST 1.6.1. under
uncorrelated exponential relaxed clock model [58,59].
Prior to the analysis we pruned taxa with significant missing data. As a calibration point we set the geological age of
Réunion to 2.1 Ma [60] as a normally distributed prior
with mean of 1Ma and extremes of standard deviation
reaching 2.1, thus in effect setting the maximal age of the
most recent common ancestor of Réunion haplotypes.
