Abstract
Background: Several dozen fungi encompassing traditional model organisms, industrial production organisms
and human and plant pathogens have been sequenced recently and their particular genomic features analysed in
detail. In addition comparative genomics has been used to analyse specific sub groups of fungi. Notably, analysis
of the phylum Saccharomycotina has revealed major events of evolution such as the recent genome duplication
and subsequent gene loss. However, little has been done to gain a comprehensive comparative view to the fungal
kingdom. We have carried out a computational genome wide comparison of protein coding gene content of
Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina, which include industrially important yeasts and filamentous fungi,
respectively.
Results: Our analysis shows that based on genome redundancy, the traditional model organisms Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa are exceptional among fungi. This can be explained by the recent genome
duplication in S. cerevisiae and the repeat induced point mutation mechanism in N. crassa.
Interestingly in Pezizomycotina a subset of protein families related to plant biomass degradation and secondary
metabolism are the only ones showing signs of recent expansion. In addition, Pezizomycotina have a wealth of
phylum specific poorly characterised genes with a wide variety of predicted functions. These genes are well
conserved in Pezizomycotina, but show no signs of recent expansion. The genes found in all fungi except
Saccharomycotina are slightly better characterised and predicted to encode mainly enzymes. The genes specific
to Saccharomycotina are enriched in transcription and mitochondrion related functions. Especially mitochondrial
ribosomal proteins seem to have diverged from those of Pezizomycotina. In addition, we highlight several
individual gene families with interesting phylogenetic distributions.
Conclusion: Our analysis predicts that all Pezizomycotina unlike Saccharomycotina can potentially produce a
wide variety of secondary metabolites and secreted enzymes and that the responsible gene families are likely to
evolve fast. Both types of fungal products can be of commercial value, or on the other hand cause harm to humans.
In addition, a great number of novel predicted and known enzymes are found from all fungi except
Saccharomycotina. Therefore further studies and exploitation of fungal metabolism appears very promising.

Background
At least 36 fungal genomes are already available at public
databases and several more are being sequenced. Of
eukaryotes, Fungi is the kingdom with most sequenced
species. The sequenced genomes cover fungal species
broadly and include industrially, medically and agriculturally important species with very diverse genomes. For
these reasons fungal genomes form one of the most attractive eukaryotic datasets for comparative genomics
research and method development. Moreover, the possibilities for in silico exploration of the diversity of biological functions in these organisms have been
revolutionized.
The fungal kingdom is divided in Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota
and Deuteromycota. Most sequenced fungi belong to
Ascomycota, which is again divided in Pezizomycotina,
Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina. Pezizomycotina, commonly referred to as filamentous fungi, grow
mostly in a filamentous form and degrade biomass to free
sugars to be used as source of carbon and energy. In contrast, Saccharomycotina, commonly referred to as yeasts,
grow mostly in a unicellular form. They have generally no
capability to degrade biomass and accordingly live on free
sugars.
Comparative genomics has been applied extensively
within the phylum Saccharomycotina (for review see [1]),
where a whole genome duplication followed by massive
gene loss and specialization has been shown to have
occurred [2]. This has been further confirmed by a broader
analysis of differential genome evolution in Saccharomycotina species [3] that also demonstrated the usefulness of
multi-species protein clustering.

Atlases [11], e-Fungi [12], but none offers a level of detail
comparable to Ensembl. However, high quality software
to set up such a database is freely available from the
Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) [13] and Ensembl
projects. Most importantly, these support interfaces to
BioPerl [14], which offers currently the most extensive
sequence analysis programming library.
Our goal is to explain differences in phenotypes of fungi
through differences in their genotypes and to deduce evolutionary processes that have shaped fungi. To this end we
have used TRIBE-MCL [15] protein clustering and InterProScan [16] protein domain analysis to compare
genome open reading frame (ORF) contents of Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina species in a large data set of
33 fungal genomes. TRIBE-MCL divides the genomes
comprehensively into protein clusters, while InterProScan
detects known protein domains. We have also set up a
GBrowse based comparative genomics web interface that
enables easy browsing of our data. We detected protein
clusters specific to Pezizomycotina, other fungi than Saccharomycotina and Saccharomycotina, and characterised
them with Funcat gene classifications [17-19] and Protfun
protein function predictions [20].
We found that in Pezizomycotina protein clusters related
to plant biomass degradation and secondary metabolism
are the only ones with multiple proteins in each species.
Pezizomycotina have also an interesting expansion of a
transcription factor protein family and a wealth of
enzymes and subsequent metabolic capabilities not
found in Saccharomycotina. In contrast, Saccharomycotina specific protein clusters are enriched in transcription and mitochondrion related functions.

Results
Studies of Pezizomycotina have concentrated on descriptions of individual genomes or comparisons inside a class
such as the Eurotiales genomes of Aspergillus fumigatus [4],
oryzae [5] and nidulans [6]. A. fumigatus and oryzae had
been previously considered as asexual organisms, but
comparative analysis showed that their genomes have the
same potential for sexual reproduction as A. nidulans.
Sequencing of the Neurospora crassa genome [7] revealed
the full effect of the mechanism called Repeat Induced
Point mutations (RIP). RIP specifically mutates duplications that are longer than 400 bp and more identical than
80%, thus effectively preventing gene duplications and
keeping the genome extremely non-redundant (for review
see [8]).
Extensive comparative genomic databases for some
groups of eukaryotic species are available such as the
Ensembl for mammals [9]. Several comparative databases
exist also for fungi such as MIPS [10], CBS Genome

Overview of clustering results
To compare the ORF content of Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina we selected a set of 33 species shown in
Table 1. 14 of them are Pezizomycotina and 13 Saccharomycotina. In addition one Archeascomycota, four Basidiomycota and one Zygomycota were included as reference
species outside the two phyla.

To compare the ORF content systematically, we first
divided all the ORFs in groups related by sequence similarity. For this we used a protein clustering software
TRIBE-MCL [15]. It uses a graph clustering algorithm to
cluster proteins based on the results of an all-against-all
BLASTP [21]. The results have been shown to correlate
well with manual family classifications [15]. The sizes of
TRIBE-MCL clusters are influenced by the parameter inflation value (r), which is limited to values between 1.1 and
4.5. Subsequently, it effects also the sensitivity, specificity,
total count of clusters and count of orphan clusters (i.e.

clusters with only one member), which are shown in Figure 1 for different inflation values. We defined sensitivity
as the average percentage of how many of the proteins
with same InterPro domain structure (see below) are contained in a single cluster. In parallel, specificity was
defined as the average percentage of how many of the proteins in a cluster have the same InterPro domain structure
[22]. We selected for further analysis a clustering where r
= 3.1, as a good compromise between sensitivity and specificity.
We used the program InterProScan [23] to detect if proteins from a sub set of genomes (Table 1) had a sequence
feature corresponding to an InterPro entry. InterPro is a
database of known protein sequence features such as
domains, families and active sites, i.e. InterPro entries. In
contrast to TRIBE-MCL clustering, InterProScan is not
comprehensive as it is limited to known entries accepted
to the InterPro database and not uniform because an entry
might represent a completely different evolutionary or
functional level such as superfamily, subfamily or protein
sequence feature such as domain or active site. Thus,
TRIBE-MCL clustering allows us to compare genomes in a
comprehensive and uniform way, while InterProScan
analysis allows a comparison of distributions of specific
known sequence features.

ORFs unrecognised by InterPro (x-axis) for species which
were analysed with InterProScan. Species are coloured by
phyla. Names of the species, plotted as abbreviations beside
the data points, are explained in Table 1.

In order to elucidate how well our analysis covers the
genomes studied we counted, for the species analysed
with InterProScan, the percentage of ORFs in orphan clusters and the percentage of ORFs without any InterPro
entries (Figure 2). The Ascomycota genomes with particularly high percentage of orphan clusters in relation to their
genome size are N. crassa and Yarrowia lipolytica. N. crassa
has also a particularly high percentage of InterProScan
unrecognised ORFs. In contrast, the data set includes several closely related members of the Eurotiales; A. nidulans,
A. fumigatus, A. oryzae and A. niger, which have a particularly low percentage of orphan clusters and InterProScan
unrecognised ORFs.

To find out how redundant the ORF contents of the
genomes studied are, we counted genomic ORF redundancy in each genome (Figure 3). This was defined as the
percentage of ORFs in a genome found in clusters with
more than one ORF from the same species [3]. Particularly
high values of redundancy in relation to their genome
sizes are found in the Saccharomycotina species that have
undergone a recent genome duplication [2,3] (S. cerevisiae
and S. castellii), while Candida glabrata, which also
belongs to the genome duplication lineage has an average
value. N. crassa genome has been shown to have an

extremely low level of paralogy due to the RIP mechanism
[7], and in accordance it has a particularly low value of
redundancy in relation to its genome size. Due to the
incomplete state of S. kluyveri genome sequence [24] its
redundancy is likely to be underestimated.
Characterization of clusters
In order to divide the clusters obtained in our analysis to
phylogenetically interesting groups, clusters with at least
10 member ORFs, were ordered by hierarchical clustering
based on how many proteins of each species were
included in each cluster (Figure 4 and 5 or an excel version
[see additional file 1]). We selected four regions with
interesting ORF contents for further analysis, A: "Pezizomycotina abundant", B: "Pezizomycotina specific", C:
"Saccharomycotina absent" and D: "Saccharomycotina
unique". To characterise the content of the regions, they

were analysed for enrichment of Funcat categories, Protfun categories and InterPro entries (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5).
Funcat is a hierarchical protein function classification system based on extensive manual annotation [17]. Protfun
integrates results from several other protein feature prediction programmes to predict characteristics and functions of a protein based on its sequence [20]. However,
Protfun does not use any sequence similarity information,
which is essential in attempting to characterise novel protein families unique to fungi. Each cluster's member ORFs
were checked for Funcat, InterPro and Protfun assignments and when at least 75% (ProtFun and InterPro) or
all (Funcat) ORFs of those for which data was available
had the same assignment, it was given to the cluster. If
assignments were more heterogeneous, the cluster was
assigned as uncategorised for the particular type of assignment. In addition, we checked which clusters contained

an S. cerevisiae ORF found in the metabolic model
iMH805 [25]. The model includes mostly enzyme genes
involved in the known primary metabolism of S. cerevisiae
and also many of their transcriptional regulators. Of the
805 ORFs in iMH805 [25], 737 were successfully mapped
to 498 clusters shown in Figure 4.
Overall, 57% of the clusters with at least 10 members were
assigned with a Funcat category, but the cover of Funcat
differs greatly between the regions (Figure 4). The respective percentages for the selected regions are, A: "Pezizomycotina abundant" 61%, B: "Pezizomycotina specific"
20%, C: "Saccharomycotina absent" 43% and D: "Saccharomycotina unique" 81%. Also, over 95% of the clusters
having members from all species shown at the upper part
of main heatmap of Figure 4 have a Funcat category. The
ORFs of the S. cerevisiae metabolic model iMH805 [25]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/325

are distributed even more strikingly. Most clusters having
these ORFs have members from all species. In addition
7% of the clusters in D: "Saccharomycotina unique" have
an iMH805 [25] ORF (see below).
198 clusters were assigned to the region A: "Pezizomycotina abundant". They have usually more ORFs in Pezizomycotina than in other phyla and none in
Saccharomycotina (Figure 4). The categories of clusters
significantly enriched in this region compared to other
clusters are shown in Table 2. Clusters of the region contain mainly predicted enzymes. 20% of the clusters were
predicted to have a secretion pathway signal sequence and
36% of the clusters had heterogeneous signal sequence
predictions and were assigned as "TargetP: Uncategorised"
(Table 4). Thus, it is likely that more than 20% of the clusters are actually secreted. The enriched Funcat categories

Legend for figure 4. A heatmap of clusters with at least ten ORFs. In the main heatmap colour intensity of a cell shows the
number of ORFs shown by clusters (rows) and by species (columns). Both rows and columns are ordered by hierarchical clustering to group similar rows or columns together. The dendrogram from hierarchical clustering is shown for columns and the
phylum of species is indicated by a column colour bar between the heatmap and the dendrogram. Under the heatmap each species is specified by an abbreviation explained in Table 1. On the left side of the main heatmap a black and white side heatmap
shows the percentage of ORFs in a cluster that have an InterPro entry of all cluster's ORFs analysed with InterProScan
("wIPR"), cluster's stability and cluster's Saccharomycotina to Pezizomycotina ratio in a clustering where inflation value (r) was
1.1 ("S/P r 1.1"). Stability reflects the ratio of cluster size between a clustering where r = 3.1 to that where r = 1.1. As Figure 1
shows, when r is set to its minimum value (1.1), TRIBE-MCL clustering produces a minimum amount of clusters and orphan
clusters. In consequence the clusters are on average larger when r = 1.1. The ratio between cluster size r = 3.1 and r = 1.1 is
shown as a percentage. "S/P r 1.1" reflects the ratio of count of Saccharomycotina ORFs to Pezizomycotina ORFs in a cluster
when r = 1.1. By comparing "S/P r 1.1" to the species distribution of a cluster shown on the main heatmap one can see if a cluster retains the Saccharomycotina to Pezizomycotina ratio when r = 1.1. On the right side of the main heatmap, a side heatmap
shows various functional classifications for the clusters. Whether or not the cluster has a Funcat classification ("Funcat") or has
an ORF found in S. cerevisiae metabolic model iMH805 is shown ("iMH805"). Whether the proteins in the cluster are predicted
by Protfun to have a signal sequence directing them into either mitochondrion or secretion pathway ("TargetP"), have transmembrane domains ("TMHMM") or are predicted to be enzymes is shown ("Enz."). Clusters belonging to regions A: "Pezizomycotina abundant", B: "Pezizomycotina specific", C: "Saccharomycotina absent" and D: "Saccharomycotina unique" are
specified by a vertical bar between main and right heatmap.
of the clusters are mainly related to plant biomass degradation and secondary metabolism (Table 2). Enriched
InterPro entries of the clusters are also mainly in categories connected to secondary metabolism and plant biomass degradation. However, proteins with domains
related to secondary metabolism might also have other
functions. For example, the methylation carried out by
"IPR01077: O-methyltransferases family 2" domains can
function in transcription regulation or aflatoxin biosynthesis [26].
The 1130 clusters of the region B: "Pezizomycotina specific" have usually just one ORF in each Pezizomycotina
species and none in the other phyla (Figure 4). Most proteins in these clusters were predicted not to have trans-

membrane regions and 16% of them were predicted not
to be enzymes. 11% of the clusters were predicted to have
a secretion pathway signal sequence. The cellular role predictions "Cell envelope", "Regulatory functions", "Central
intermediary metabolism" "Purines and pyrimidines"
show significant enrichment. The Funcat classification
category "response to environmental stimuli" is the only
one significantly enriched (Table 3). Enriched InterPro
entries IPR001138 and IPR007219 (Table 5), are transcription factor domains that commonly occur together
(see chapter "PCA of InterPro entry counts" below). Otherwise the enriched entries are functionally diverse.
The 1010 clusters of the region C: "Saccharomycotina
absent" have usually just one ORF in each Pezizomy-

Software or database that the categories were derived from, category database identifier, category name, count of clusters with the category, percentage of all clusters in this
region, percentage of all clusters with the category and significance of enrichment are shown for categories which are enriched in the region (Figure 4) with a p < 0.01. Column
"Author assignment" shows an assignment to general themes, based on the respective database, that summarise the InterPro and Funcat categories. While the other
assignments are directly based on the databases, "Secondary metabolism" covers entries which are known to participate also in secondary metabolism ([61, 62], Funcat and
InterPro). For InterPro entries whether the entry is found from Figure 9 is specified in column "Figure 9". InterPro entries assigned to "Dubious" are entries that InterPro itself
considers unreliable.

cotina species and none in Saccharomycotina (Figure 4).
They were predicted mainly not to have transmembrane
regions and 74% were predicted to be enzymes. No cellular role could be predicted for 72% of the clusters (Table
4). Several Funcat amino acid degradation categories are
enriched in these clusters (Table 4). However, all these
cases correspond to only five clusters that have different
overlapping categories. The Enzyme Commission (EC)
numbers found in Funcat for the proteins in these clusters
all map to the KEGG [27] pathway "Valine, leucine and
isoleucine degradation" (Figure 6). According to SGD and
KEGG S. cerevisiae has only few of the enzymes in this
pathway, while M. griseae has most of them. InterPro
entries enriched in the clusters of the region are mainly
related to metabolism (Table 4). The two Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase entries are in the same clusters and correspond
to proteins with EC: 1.3.99.3. shown in Figure 6.
The 466 clusters of the region D: "Saccharomycotina
unique" have usually just one ORF in each Saccharomycotina species and none in the other phyla (Figure 4).
These clusters were mainly predicted not to have transmembrane regions, and 66% were predicted not to have
any signal sequence. 20% of the clusters were predicted
not to contain enzymes, while 15% were predicted to be
ligases. Several predicted cellular roles were also enriched
(Table 4). Two of the four InterPro entries enriched in the
clusters of this region are related to nucleotide binding
(Table 5).
The Funcat categories enriched are either related to mitochondrion, transcription or translation (Table 3). Categories "Biogenesis of cellular components: mitochondrion"
and "Ribosomal proteins" overlap. Of the 34 clusters in
"Biogenesis of cellular components: mitochondrion", 28
contain an S. cerevisiae ORF described by Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) [28] as mitochondrial ribosomal component of the small or large subunit. Of these

ORFs, 26 are found in clusters with the category "Ribosomal proteins".
In contrast, five clusters with the category "Subcellular
localisation: mitochondrion" contain S. cerevisiae proteins not related to ribosomes that have been localised to
mitochondrion in a genome wide analysis [29]. For the
other clusters with "Subcellular localisation: mitochondrion" Funcat proposes, based on sequence similarity,
that they could be localised to mitochondrion. The function of the ORFs found in the clusters with this enriched
category is not known. However, YJL082w (IML2) found
in the clusters has been shown to have a physical interaction with YLR014c (PPR1) [30], a positive transcriptional
regulator of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway [31].
Also, according to InterProScan YHF198c (FMP22) found
in the clusters is a member of the "Purine/pyrimidine
phosphoribosyl transferase" family (IPR002375), like the
YML106W (URA5) and YMR271C (URA10) genes
involved in the actual pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway.
This evidence suggests that Saccharomycotina could have
a novel mitochondrial pyrimidine related pathway not
found in Pezizomycotina.
In addition to enriched cluster categories, the region D:
"Saccharomycotina unique" is characterised by 34 clusters, which have a gene found in the S. cerevisiae metabolic
model iMH805 [25]. Interestingly, instead of actual metabolic enzymes, 13 of these are transcription factors.
Besides "01 Metabolism", the Funcat category most
enriched among these clusters in comparison to all other
clusters is "01.07.01 biosynthesis of vitamins, cofactors
and prosthetic groups" (p < 2,2*10e-6, 7 clusters).
PCA of InterPro entry counts
The analysis of the TRIBE-MCL clusters presented above
dealt only with clusters of at least ten member ORFs.
However, the clustering produced 77.278 clusters with

only a single member and 11.727 of these had InterPro
entries (Figure 2). In order to find differences in counts of
ORFs with InterPro entries or InterPro entry structures
between the species, independently of TRIBE-MCL clusters, we carried out a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA). InterPro entry structures were constructed to each
ORF by reducing overlapping and redundant InterPro
entries into a single most specific one and concatenating
these in the order they appear in the protein sequence.

This enabled us to differentiate between InterPro entries
appearing alone in an ORF from those that commonly
appear together in an ORF.
PCA finds principal components (PC), i.e. major sources
of variation between the species and positions of the original samples and the loadings of individual InterPro
entries or InterPro entry structures on the PCs. The PCs are
named so that the PC explaining the highest amount of

variation is called PC1, the PC explaining the next highest
amount of variation PC2 etc. A loading represents the
contribution of an InterPro entry or an InterPro entry
structure in forming a PC. For example, an InterPro entry
with the lowest loading on PC1 is the largest contributor
to positions low on PC1.
We found that in a PCA of counts of ORFs with InterPro
entries, PC1 explains 40% of all the variation in the data
while PC2 explains 22%. The positions of the species on
these two PCs are shown in Figure 7. Pezizomycotina are
separated from Saccharomycotina on PC1. Between these
phyla N. crassa and Y. lipolytica have the least difference
and Hymenomycetes are similarly in the middle of PC1.
This means that in counts of ORFs with InterPro entries
the difference between Pezizomycotinaand Saccharomycotina is the largest source of variation and InterPro
entries with lowest loadings on PC1 are the most abundant in Pezizomycotina in comparison to Saccharomycotina
and
vice-versa
for
highest
loadings.

Hymenomycetes are separated from other fungi on PC2.
An almost identical result was achieved by using counts of
ORFs with an InterPro entry structure instead (data not
shown).
To understand which individual InterPro entries (Figure
8a) or InterPro entry structures (Figure 8b) contribute
most to the difference between the species we studied
InterPro entry and InterPro entry structure loadings on
PC1 and PC2 of their respective PCAs. We selected the 100
InterPro entries or InterPro entry structures with most
extreme loadings (TOP 100) and visualised the counts of
ORFs of the TOP 100 InterPro entries from Figure 8a as a
heatmap (Figure 9 and 10, or an excel version [see additional file 2]).
Based on the distributions of the loadings less than hundred InterPro entries or InterPro entry structures actually
notably contribute to the positions of the species on PC1
and PC2 (Figure 8a and 8b). The TOP100 InterPro entries

the five most common, with their counts, are: "Macromolecule interaction, 19", "Secondary metabolism, 18",
"Dubious, 9", "Protein modification, 8" and "Transporter,

InterPro itself considers unreliable.
The InterPro entry structures contributing most to PC1
and PC2 and having several InterPro entries that appear
together are "IPR001138: Fungal transcriptional regulatory protein, N-terminal, IPR007219: Fungal specific transcription
factor",
"IPR000719:

"IPR002290:

IPR008271: Serine/threonine protein kinase, active site"
(Figure 8b). These seven InterPro entries belong also to
the TOP100 individual entries shown on Figure 8a and 8.
IPR001138 is a DNA binding N-terminal zinc binuclear
cluster (Zn2Cys6) domain and IPR007219 a C-terminal
domain commonly found in proteins with IPR001138.
Both are found in many fungal transcription factors such
as S. cerevisiae GAL4 [32], A. niger xlnR [33] and Aspergillus
flavus aflR [34]. Of proteins with IPR001138, 39% have
also an IPR007219. On the average a Pezizomycotina has
three times more ORFs with IPR001138 than a Saccharomycotina.

Interpro entry identifier ("IPR id.", "IPR0" removed from

shown for each entry. The "Author assignment" is an assignment to general themes that summarise the individual categories based on the InterPro database. While the other
assignments are directly based on the InterPro, "Secondary
metabolism" covers entries which are known to participate
also in secondary metabolism ([61, 62] and InterPro). InterPro entries assigned to "Dubious" are entries that InterPro
itself considers unreliable.

Browsable fungal comparative genomics database
Automatic classifications of translated ORFs to families
based on similarity to known families or de novo classifications by translated ORF clustering are not perfect. We
have used InterProScan [16] to find out if an ORF is a
member of a known family or has some known sequence
feature like a domain or an active site i.e. has an InterPro
entry. We also used TRIBE-MCL [15] to cluster ORFs based
purely on sequence similarity. Our database aims to integrate these two classifications in the context of fungal
comparative genomics and to allow easy browser access to
the data.

Figure 11 shows a schematic of browser views and the
links between them and example screenshots. "Protein
view" shows an individual ORF with its InterPro entries. It
is mainly used to access "Protein cluster view" that shows
all the member ORFs of a cluster with InterPro entries

The sizes of the TRIBE-MCL [15] clusters are influenced by
the parameter inflation value. For an overall comparison
of genomes we selected the inflation value 3.1, because it
gives a good compromise between clustering sensitivity
and specificity (Figure 1). However in individual cases this
might not be the best value. Users can specify different
inflation values while browsing the database.

Discussion
Overview of clustering results
We have analysed the ORF content of Pezizomycotina and
Saccharomycotina species with sequence similarity based
protein clustering. The main clustering parameter, inflation value (r), was selected as a compromise between sensitivity and specificity of clustering. Consequently, the
number of ORFs in clusters with only a single member
(orphan clusters) is twice as large with the selected (r =
3.1) than with the lowest (r = 1.1) inflation value (Figure
1). The clusters were then divided in phylum specific
groups for further analysis. The column "S/P r 1.1" in Figure 4 shows that the ratio of Saccharomycotina to Pezizomycotina ORF counts, i.e. the phylum specificity, is
largely maintained in the clusters even in r = 1.1 clustering. This holds especially well for A: "Pezizomycotina
abundant" and D: "Saccharomycotina unique" clusters,
while other regions have more variation.

As expected, N. crassa due to its extreme RIP mechanism,
has the lowest genomic ORF redundancy among Pezizomycotina (Figure 3) [7]. Variable RIP activity could also
explain the separation of Sordariomycetes species (T. reesei, F. graminerum, C. globosum, M. grisea and N. crassa) in
to two groups in regard to counts of unrecognised ORFs
(Figure 2). It has been proposed that Aspergillus species
and M. grisea could have a milder RIP like mechanism
[35,36]. Our analysis does not exclude this possibility, but
it is clear that the N. crassa genome is particular among
fungi. N. crassa and S. cerevisiae are probably the most
commonly used fungal model organisms and thus it is
notable that with regard to genomic ORF redundancy they
have the most exceptional genomes within the analysed
large fungal genome set.

Characterisation of cluster regions
From the protein clustering results presented in Figure 4
we selected four interesting regions containing clusters
with particular phylogenetic distributions. The clusters in
these regions were then searched for enrichment of Protfun and Funcat category and InterPro entry annotations.

Clusters in the region A: "Pezizomycotina abundant" have
usually more ORFs in Pezizomycotina than in other phyla
and none in Saccharomycotina(Figure 6). The results of
all three annotation analyses of these clusters agree well
(Table 2). This region contains relatively well characterised enzymes involved either in secondary metabolism or
in extracellular plant biomass degradation machinery, but
Funcat analysis finds far more clusters involved in plant
biomass degradation than InterPro analysis. However,
InterPro provides much less detail on glycosyl hydrolases
involved in lignocellulose degradation, than for example
the specialised Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZY)
database [37].

Many of the enzymes in clusters of this region, such as
cytochrome P450s, glycoside hydrolases and tyrosinases
are at the edge of the metabolic network involved in synthesis of the final secreted metabolites or degradation of
the external sources of carbon. Consequently, the high
sequence homology and the resulting larger clusters of A:
"Pezizomycotina abundant" proteins could be due to
recent protein family expansions to give more possibilities
for the fungi to interact with the environment.
Clusters in the region B: "Pezizomycotina specific" have
usually just one ORF in each Pezizomycotina species and
none in the other phyla (Figure 4). In comparison to A:
"Pezizomycotina abundant" clusters, far fewer member
ORFs have any InterPro entries (Figure 4, column "wIPR")
and very few InterPro or Funcat annotations show enrichment (Tables 3). The significant enrichment of the Protfun "Cellular role: Regulatory functions" and InterPro
entries "IPR001138: Fungal transcriptional regulatory

Page 17 of 23

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:325

protein, N-terminal" and "IPR007219: Fungal specific
transcription factor" coincide well.
Clusters in the region C: "Saccharomycotina absent" have
usually just one ORF in each Pezizomycotina species and
none in Saccharomycotina (Figure 4). According to Protfun predictions these are mostly enzymes. In comparison
to B: "Pezizomycotina specific" clusters, more member
ORFs have some InterPro entries (Figure 4, column
"wIPR"), but still neither InterPro entry nor Funcat category enrichment provide much detail, except for proteins
found in the KEGG pathway "Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation" (Figure 6). The "EC: 1.3.99.3" acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase, detected by InterPro and Funcat enrichment analysis, is a key enzyme for fatty acid β-oxidation
in mitochondria. The capability for fatty acid β-oxidation
in mitochondria has been shown experimentally for A.
nidulans [38] and proposed by genome analysis for several
other Pezizomycotina species [6,38]. However, Saccharomycotina can apparently only carry out fatty acid β-oxidation in peroxisomes [39-42]. The proteins detected by
Funcat enrichment analysis and found in M. grisea are
according to KEGG linked to polyketide synthesis (Figure
6). A reason for the other fungi than Saccharomycotina to
have this capability while the Saccharomycotina can do
without, could be the ability to provide precursors from
the fatty acid and amino acid metabolism to the
polyketide synthesis.
B: "Pezizomycotina specific" and C: "Saccharomycotina
absent" clusters contain proteins of low homology that
subsequently divide into small equally sized clusters. They
seem to contain proteins more connected in cellular
metabolism and regulation networks than the clusters in
the region A: "Pezizomycotina abundant" and thus be
under more pressure not to expand to keep the topology
of the networks conserved. This would allow the
sequences to diverge in time without simultaneous expansion of the families and result into small clusters broadly
conserved over Pezizomycotina.
In addition, based on the distribution of the clusters with
ORFs found in S. cerevisiae metabolic model iMH805
[25], it is clear that over 90% of these ORFs are well conserved in all fungal species. These form the conserved core
of the fungal metabolic network. Metabolism related
ORFs in B: "Pezizomycotina specific" and C: "Saccharomycotina absent" could then represent a mid layer around
the core such as the ORFs shown in Figure 6, that link primary metabolism to secondary metabolism and biomass
degradation machinery. However, Protfun predicts that
most B: "Pezizomycotina specific" ORFs are not related to
metabolism (Table 4), rather they could be involved for
example in Pezizomycotina specific morphology. Actual
biomass degradation and secondary metabolism machin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/325

eries, i.e. A: "Pezizomycotina abundant" ORFs, could then
form the edges of the network. Being on the outer rim of
the metabolic network they could be subjected to minimal evolutionary constraints for conserving network
topology and could be directly subjected to various evolutionary pressures by the changing environments and thus
evolve fast.
Proteins involved in secondary metabolism, glycoside
hydrolases and predicted secreted uncharacterised ORFs
are found in for example subtelomeric regions of Magnaporthe oryzae [43]. Subtelomeric regions appear to have
a potential for faster evolution than many other chromosomal regions [43-45]. Consequently, subtelomeric positioning could provide a mechanism to explain expansion
of A: "Pezizomycotina abundant" like protein families.
Clusters in the region D: "Saccharomycotina unique" have
usually just one ORF in each Saccharomycotina species
and none in the other phyla (Figure 4). Various Protfun
cellular role predictions are enriched in these clusters,
among them translation, transcription and mitochondrion related, found also in Funcat enrichment analysis.
Strikingly, clusters with the Funcat category "42.16: Biogenesis of cellular components: Mitochondrion" correspond to at least 28 different components of
mitochondrial ribosomal protein complexes. However,
homologous Pezizomycotina ORFs are found in the
region "B: Pezizomycotina specific". The protein
sequences in different families of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins have diverged so much between Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina that TRIBE-MCL splits the
families in different clusters. This implies that these complexes have diverged significantly between Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina.
Comparison of clustering and PCA results
In addition to clustering, a PCA of counts of ORFs with an
InterPro entry was done. We searched for known protein
sequence features (domains, families, and active sites etc.,
i.e. InterPro entries) with the program InterProScan from
a subset of genomes in our data set (Table 1), counted
ORFs having an entry and analysed the counts with PCA.
The function of the 100 InterPro entries with most differences between the species analysed (TOP 100) was studied in detail.

TRIBE-MCL clustering and InterPro analyses complemented each other well. Proteins that are conserved in
several species could be studied comprehensively regardless of how well they have previously been described in
InterPro by clustering (Figure 4). However, the TOP 100
InterPro entries contain interesting details not detected by
clustering, such as the expansion of major facilitator
superfamilies (MFS) and macromolecule interaction

Page 18 of 23

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:325

related protein families in Pezizomycotina and the distribution of transposon related proteins among Pezizomycotina (Figure 9). MFS transporters lie in clusters with
ORFs from all species and due to this their expansion was
not detected clearly by the clustering analysis (Figure 4).
In contrast, enrichment of "IPR001138: Fungal transcriptional regulatory protein, N-terminal" was detected. However, the full importance of this expansion was only
revealed by PCA, because there are 614 clusters with less
than 10 members that have an IPR001138. As InterPro
domain analysis uses searches optimised for individual
protein families or domains, it can detect well both families with high internal sequence similarity such as MFS
transporters and with low internal sequence similarity
such as IPR001138, if the family has been previously well
characterised.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/325

separated from other yeasts. This could imply that Y. lipolytica ORFs and ORF content of conserved cellular functions resemble more those of other fungi than
Saccharomycotina. In the tree constructed from the TOP
100 InterPro entries Saccharomycotina are grouped
together while Pezizomycotina are not divided as
expected (Figure 9). For example, the Eurotiales are
grouped together in Figure 4, although they are separated
in Figure 9. This could mean that even though the ORF
contents among Eurotiales are very similar at large, in
regard to protein families contributing most to the differences between the fungi studied, individual Eurotiales can
resemble more other less related species. For example the
human pathogen A. fumigatus is more similar to the plant
pathogen M. griseae than to other Eurotiales.

Conclusion
The InterPro entries among the TOP 100 with the lowest
values on PC1, thus most abundant in Pezizomycotina in
comparison to Saccharomycotina (Figures 8 and 9), overlap with cluster InterPro entry enrichment of A: "Pezizomycotina abundant" and B: "Pezizomycotina specific"
clusters (Tables 2 and 3). The major difference between
clustering and PCA results is that in clustering transcription factors belong to B: "Pezizomycotina specific", and
secondary metabolism related clusters fall into A: "Pezizomycotina abundant", while PCA makes no such distinction. MFS transporters have also very negative values on
PC1 (Figure 9). They are transporters found for example
in fungal secondary metabolite clusters for gliotoxin [46]
or trichothecene [47] synthesis. As secondary metabolism
seems to be the major function connecting InterPro
entries with most negative values on PC1, it could be
expected that "IPR001138: Fungal transcriptional regulatory protein, N-terminal" family has expanded to control
secondary metabolism and that MFS transporters would
have expanded to export the produced metabolites. However, likely targets are also the many plant biomass degradation related clusters found in A: "Pezizomycotina
abundant", for example IPR001138 transcription factor A.
niger xlnR [33] is known to regulate cellulase and hemicellulase genes and A. flavus aflR [34] regulates a secondary
metabolism pathway. Furthermore, Pezizomycotina specific features like ascocarp formation or other yet incompletely described processes could involve these
transcription factors.
Hierarchical clustering of species' cluster ORF (Figure 4)
or InterPro entry (Figure 9) counts produce different species similarity dendrograms (shown on top of the heatmap in both figures). In Figure 4, the tree constructed
from clusters with at least ten ORFs, resembles closely the
one presented by NCBI Taxonomy database [48]. However, Y. lipolytica, expected to be the first species to diverge
from the Saccharomycotina lineage (for review see [1]), is

In conclusion we have carried out a detailed comparison
of the ORF content of Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina species and found previously well described and
novel interesting differences. Our analysis includes fundamentally different but complementary databases and
methods. Due to this we are able to support our conclusions with results from independent analysis. The use of a
large multi genome dataset further emphasises the credibility of the results.
We highlight promising targets for future experimental
studies such as the expanded transcription factor family
and potential novel secreted protein families in Pezizomycotina. In general the proteins specific to and well conserved in Pezizomycotina should be studied further as
they are largely unknown. We propose an evolutionary
explanation for the discovered Pezizomycotina genome
features. However, confirmation of this requires detailed
comparisons of the chromosomal localisations of the
genes in question and of the fungal metabolic and regulatory network.

Methods
Sequence and cluster analyses and annotation, database
construction and interactions and usage of various bioinformatics software was done with custom Perl scripts
using when possible the BioPerl [14] libraries. Final data
analysis and visualisation of results was done with custom
R scripts using the Bioconductor libraries [49] when possible.
Retrieval and analysis of sequence data
Protein sequences of predicted open reading frames
(ORF), in fasta format, were retrieved from various
sequencing centres as indicated in Table 1. They have been
published in the following articles: S. pombe [50], A. fumigatus [4], A. nidulans [6], A. oryzae [5], M. grisea [36], N.
crassa [7], A. gossypii [51], C. albicans [52], C. glabrata [3],

[54], S. kluyveri [53], Y. lipolytica [3], P. chrysosporium [55],
U. maydis [56], in addition P. pastoris was purchased from
ERGO [57]. Sequences were inserted to Oracle database
(Oracle) according to the BioPerlDB schema. The Additional file 3 maps each sequence identifier to its species
enabling the use of other Additional files [see additional
file 3].
To find functional and pathway annotations for proteins
Funcat [17-19] annotations were downloaded from MIPS
[58] for genomes indicated in Table 1.
Proteins from a subset of genomes (Table 1) were analysed with InterProScan [16] to find features from their
sequence, i.e. InterPro [59] entries. InterPro entries can
have hierarchical parent-child relationship. For example
IPR001236 "Lactate/malate dehydrogenase " is a parent of
IPR010097 "Malate dehydrogenase, NAD-dependent".
For each protein an InterPro entry structure, i.e. a vector of
InterPro entry identifiers in the order they appear on the
sequence, was constructed. From non-identical entries
overlapping along protein sequence only the most specific
was selected in case a parent-child relationship existed
between them. Next, any overlapping or sequential duplicates of the same entry were removed and the longest
entry in amino acids was used to define the entries location. InterPro entries found in the ORFs are provided [see
additional file 4].
Proteins from a subset of genomes (Table 1) were analysed also with Protfun [60] to predict their function and
localisation. Protfun categories of proteins are provided
[see additional file 5].
Protein clustering and cluster annotation
Proteins were clustered with the graph clustering software
TRIBE-MCL [15]. Briefly, TRIBE-MCL identifies protein
family like protein clusters using a Markov Clustering procedure operating on a matrix of expectation values computed from an all-versus-all BLASTP [21] search of protein
sequences. TRIBE-MCL requires one major user defined
parameter, the inflation value (r), which influences the
size of the clusters. To define a suitable r the InterPro entry
structures were used. Each cluster's InterPro entry structure was defined as the most common InterPro entry
structure found in its member proteins. Subsequently, for
each tested r specificity and sensitivity of the clustering
(Figure 1) were counted as proposed in [22]. A cluster's
specificity was defined as the percentage of proteins in a
cluster having the same structure as the cluster's structure.
A cluster's sensitivity was defined as the percentage of proteins with the same structure as the cluster in question of
all proteins with this structure. Sensitivity and specificity
of a clustering were defined as the respective averages of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/325

all cluster's sensitivities and specificities in a clustering.
Clusters and their members are provided [see additional
file 6].
We defined two indexes to describe the difference
between clustering with r = 1.1 and r = 3.1, Stability and
"S/P r 1.1" (Figure 4). The Stability of a cluster is the ratio
of cluster sizes between r = 3.1 and r = 1.1. The cluster size
in r = 1.1 is the average of the sizes of clusters to which the
members of the r = 3.1 cluster belong to. "S/P r 1.1" of a
cluster is the ratio between counts of ORFs from Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina species. Similarly as Stability, it was counted for an r = 3.1 cluster by taking the
average of Saccharomycotina – Pezizomycotina ratios of
all the clusters to which the members of an r = 3.1 cluster
belong to in an r = 1.1 clustering.
As well as an InterPro entry structure, we assigned individual InterPro entries and Funcat and Protfun categories for
clusters to enable analysis of sets of clusters. In addition
clusters were checked for presence of proteins found in the
S. cerevisiae metabolic model iMH805 [25].
Browsing of protein clusters
To view and browse sequences, their features and protein
clusters, a Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) [13] was
set up. Normally GBrowse is used to view individual scaffolds with features i.e. genes. We modified it to show protein sequences with features i.e. domains etc. detected
with InterProScan [16] and to display a cluster view where
all proteins of a cluster are shown along with their features.
Data analysis and visualisation
Significance of enrichment of a category in a set of clusters
was tested using the hypergeometric distribution with R
function "phyper" with default settings i.e. by counting
the probability of the number of successes (number of
clusters with a certain category) in a sequence of n draws
from a finite population (total number of clusters, universe) without replacement. Because of the different
nature of the cluster annotation data, different universes
were used. For Funcat categories all clusters which had any
assigned category or entry were used as the universe. For
Protfun and Interpro data all clusters having at least 10
members (Figure 4), were used as the universe.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to find
major sources of variation in counts of ORFs having either
individual InterPro entries or InterPro entry structures.
Counts of ORFs with InterPro entries or InterPro entry
structures were normalised with the count of ORFs in a
genome. PCA was done with R function "prcomp" with
option "retx" set to true.

Heatmaps of ORF counts in clusters or having certain
InterPro entries were plotted with modified version of
"heatmap.2" from R library "grecmisc". Complete linkage
hierarchical clustering with Euclidian distance was used to
order rows and columns separately. Prior to clustering one
was added to each count, natural logarithm taken and
data was mean centred and standard deviation scaled, row
or column wise for either clustering respectively.
