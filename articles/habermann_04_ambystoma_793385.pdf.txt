information

Conclusions: Our analysis reveals the importance of a comprehensive sequence set from a
representative of the Caudata and illustrates that the EST sequence database is a rich source of
molecular, developmental and regeneration studies. To aid in data mining, the ESTs have been
organized into an easily searchable database that is freely available online.

interactions

Results: Two cDNA libraries, one made from stage 18-22 embryos and the other from day-6
regenerating tail blastemas, generated 17,352 sequences. From the sequenced ESTs, 6,377 contigs
were assembled that probably represent 25% of the expressed genes in this organism. Sequence
comparison revealed significant homology to entries in the NCBI non-redundant database. Further
examination of this gene set revealed the presence of genes involved in important cell and
developmental processes, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell-cell
communication. On the basis of these data, we have performed phylogenetic analysis of key cellcycle regulators. Interestingly, while cell-cycle proteins such as the cyclin B family display expected
evolutionary relationships, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 gene family shows an unusual
evolutionary behavior among the amphibians.

Background: The ambystomatid salamander, Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl), is an important
model organism in evolutionary and regeneration research but relatively little sequence
information has so far been available. This is a major limitation for molecular studies on caudate
development, regeneration and evolution. To address this lack of sequence information we have
generated an expressed sequence tag (EST) database for A. mexicanum.

Background

The Caudata (tailed amphibians such as salamanders) are a
major focus of work in vertebrate evolution and speciation
[1,2]. The salamander is also an important vertebrate model
organism for understanding regeneration, being one of the
few vertebrates that is able to regenerate entire body structures such as the limb, tail and jaw as an adult. Despite the
pivotal role of this animal order in research, comparatively
little sequence information is available. In contrast, 458,413
nucleotide sequences exist for the Anura (frogs and toads).
This high number is primarily attributable to large EST
sequencing efforts for the model organisms for embryology Xenopus laevis and Silurana tropicalis.
A salamander EST project is particularly important as these
organisms have extremely large genomes, making a genome
project unwieldy and unlikely without specialized approaches
such as methylation filtration [3]. Genome sizes range from
8.5 billion base pairs for Desmognathus monticola (seal salamander) to nearly 70 billion base pairs for Plethodon
vandykei (Van Dyke's salamander) [4]. The ambystomatid
Ambystoma mexicanum, a species important for studies in
evolution, regeneration and development, has an estimated
genome size between 21.9 billion and 48 billion base pairs
[5,6] and measurements of its genome in centimorgans (cM)
has yielded the largest size reported for a living vertebrate so
far (7,291 cM [7]). In maize, another organism with a large
genome, 60,000 sequence reads were required before
genome sequencing of methylation-filtered genomic libraries
generated significantly more gene sequence information than
the available maize EST sequences [8].
Molecular evolution studies of salamanders have relied primarily on mitochondrial genes such as those for ribosomal
RNAs and cytochrome c [9]. The lack of sequence information
among the Caudata hinders the ability to perform sequence
comparison with other important gene families. Furthermore, because of the lack of clones, the number of molecular
markers available to study salamander embryology and
regeneration is low. To address this gap in sequence availability we have generated a large gene sequence set for A. mexicanum. We chose this species because of its role in evolutionary,
developmental and regeneration studies. A. mexicanum is
easily bred in the laboratory, and animals can be obtained
from a large, NSF-funded colony [10]. We have sequenced
inserts from two cDNA libraries, one produced from dorsal
regions of stage 18-22 embryos, consisting primarily of neural
tube, somite and notochord. The second library was constructed from day-6 regenerating tail blastema tissue. By
sequencing from these two sources, our goal was to obtain
sequences of transcripts involved in organizing and regenerating the primary body axis. Here we describe the EST gene
set, provide an example of molecular phylogenetic analysis of
one gene from this collection, and describe the database created for organizing the A. mexicanum EST information. This
database is also being implemented for EST sequences from a

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R67

full-length X. laevis cDNA library, and for sequences from a
Canis familiaris EST project.

Results
Assessment of library and EST sequence quality
To generate a diverse set of sequences involved in organizing
and regenerating the primary body axis, two independent
cDNA libraries were used for sequencing. One was derived
from dorsal regions of stage 18-22 embryos containing neural
tube, somite and notochord - called the 'neural tube' library the other from 6-day post-amputation regenerating tail blastema. From 18,432 sequencing attempts 17,522 high-quality
sequences were obtained after Phred analysis [11]. All
sequences are 5' reads of the inserts. Of 17,522 high-quality,
single-pass sequencing runs, 32 clones contained no insert
and 137 sequences were below 32 base pairs (bp). These
sequences were excluded from further analysis (32 bp representing the lower limit for assembly of a sequence using
TIGR-assembler), yielding 17,352 clones for final analysis.
The neural tube library was the origin of 7,469 sequences and
the blastema library of 9,883 sequences (Table 1, and see
Materials and methods). As shown in Figure 1a, the average
sequence read length peaked between 500 and 600 nucleotides with an average length of 510 nucleotides and a maximum of 871.
The blastema and neural tube libraries were unnormalized
and unamplified. We assessed library quality and diversity on
the basis of the number of redundant clones in the library.
Redundancy was estimated by performing BLASTN searches
[12] against all clones sequenced. After sequencing 10,752
clones of the blastema library 42% of the sequences were still
unique, and 50% of clones were still singlets after sequencing
7,680 clones from neural tube, indicating that both libraries
display high diversity.

Number of ESTs per contig

To identify ESTs belonging to the same open reading frames
(ORFs), sequences were assembled into contigs using TIGRAssembler version 2 [13]. The 17,353 sequences assembled
into 6,594 contigs, of which 217 were less than 100 nucleotides long and excluded from further analysis. A total of

Most of the contigs had one EST. The two largest contigs contained over
400 ESTs (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 12S rRNA, respectively).

A total of 1,134 ESTs were available from A. mexicanum in the
National Center for Biological Information (NCBI) EST databases prior to this work, most of which originate from a
sequencing effort of the Voss laboratory ([14] and S.R. Voss,
D. King, N. Maness, J.J. Smith, M. Rondet, S.V. Bryant, D.M.
Gardiner, and D.M. Parichy, unpublished work (NCBI-accession numbers BI817205-BI818091); see also [15]). We examined to what extent our EST dataset overlapped with the
sequences available to date. Only 600 of the ESTs in the public database identified one of our contigs in a BLASTN search
as a homolog; in 85% of cases, the E-value was below 1E-50
and the sequences can be considered as potentially identical.
Existing ESTs in the database largely originate from
regenerating limb (S.R. Voss, D. King, N. Maness, J.J. Smith,
M. Rondet, S.V. Bryant, D.M. Gardiner and D.M. Parichy,
unpublished work). There was, however, only a slight bias of
matching contigs to regenerating blastema (49%) as compared to neural tube (44%). Seven percent of identified contigs were found in both libraries. These results mean that our
EST data enriches the existing sequence resource of A. mexicanum with approximately 6,000 new gene sequences.

6,377 contigs was therefore left for final analysis (Table 1). Of
these, 4,561 contigs contained a single clone. The average

non-redundant protein database (NR, NCBI) where a cutoff
E-value of 1e-05 was used for parsing output files. In our
annotation, we used an E-value of 1e-20 as an upper limit to
assign significant homology. We note that this does not imply
that such sequences are true orthologs. In addition, in cases
where no significant homology was found, we used an E-value
limit of 1e-05 to designate weak homology. We find this additional category of 'weak homology' useful for data mining. As
most contigs do not represent full-length sequences, it is possible that only a highly divergent region of a gene sequence is
available in our collection. The category of weak homology
allows us to find potential homologs in such situations. For
example, the BLAST search for contig Am_4671 yielded the
GenBank entry NP_004055, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (Homo sapiens), as the top hit with an E-value of 4e07. This assignment was based on the carboxy-terminal 120
amino acids of the protein, which represents the less conserved region. When we isolated a full-length clone for
Am_4671 from our library, we could confirm that it is indeed
the axolotl ortholog of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B
(p27Kip1), as discussed later.
Taken together, a total of 3,718 (58%) sequences shared
homology with a protein from selected model organisms in
the non-redundant database and could be assigned a putative
identity. The E-value distribution of the top hits in the nonredundant database is shown in Figure 2a. Of the contigs, 11%
matched a protein with an E-value below 1e-99 and are therefore likely to be true orthologs. Seventy percent of the contigs
found a hit with an E-value between 1e-20 and 1e-99 and were
assigned significant homology. Finally, 19% of contigs had a
first hit with an E-value between 1e-19 and 1e-05 and were
assigned weak homology to a protein from the non-redundant database. For annotating our database, these top hits
from human, mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), frog (X. laevis), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fugu (Takifugu
rubripes), fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), mosquito
(Anopheles gambiae), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans),
newts and the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans were
collected and the closest homolog from the above species was
used to assign a putative identity.
To estimate how many of the clones are full length we examined the BLAST alignments for the position of the alignment
in respect to the database sequence. Of the 3,718 sequences
with homologs, 1,107 (29.8%) could be aligned in the amino
terminus (with the alignment starting before position 10). As
the library was poly(dT) primed, many of these clones are
likely to represent full-length inserts. Of these 199 (5.4%)
could be aligned from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus and are potential full-length sequences.
Forty percent of our EST sequences did not generate a significant hit in the non-redundant protein database. The availability of additional sequence databases including complete

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R67

genome sequences from several organisms allowed us to
expand our BLAST searches to identify all possible homologs
to the A. mexicanum contigs. With the remaining set of contigs, we first performed BLASTN searches against the nucleotide non-redundant (NT) database and BLASTX searches
against the EST database. Finally, we performed BLASTX
searches against the fugu and human proteomes. In all cases,
an E-value of 1e-05 was used to assign potentially homologous sequences. Sequences in the NT database identified an
additional 134 contigs and a further 220 contigs found a hit in
the EST databases. A homolog was found for 3,340 (52%)
contigs in the fugu proteome and 3,698 (58%) contigs shared
homology with a protein from the human proteome. In total,
an additional 468 contigs identified a homolog in the selected
databases beyond the original assignment from the nonredundant protein database (Figure 2b).

Gene sequences with no identifiable homology
No homologous sequence could be found for 2,191 (34%) contigs in any of the databases searched. Because the library was
poly(dT) primed, many of these sequences could represent 3'
untranslated regions (3' UTRs). We determined that 953
sequences (43% of non-homologous contigs) contained no
ORF and were therefore potential untranslated regions.
Thirty of the sequences shared homology to an existing A.
mexicanum clone from the EST database (Table 3). The complete list of unique ESTs can be downloaded from [16].

Assignment of the A. mexicanum dataset to common
Gene Ontology terms
From the homologous proteins found, contigs were assigned
a biological process, molecular function and cellular component from the Gene Ontology (GO) database [17]. The closest
annotated homolog in the GO database was used, using an Evalue of 1e-20 as a cutoff, for assigning these categories. A
biological process could be assigned to 2,156 contigs (34% of
all contigs and 58% of those sharing a homolog in the nonredundant database); 2,186 contigs (34% and 59%, respectively) were assigned a molecular function; and 2,198 contigs
(34% and 59%, respectively) could be assigned a cellular component. The most abundant molecular function assigned was
'death receptor interacting protein', followed by 'peptidase',
the highest-ranking biological process were 'biological process unknown' and 'proteolysis/peptidolysis' and the most
abundant cellular components assigned were the 'actin
cytoskeleton' and 'transcriptional repressor complex'.
The largest fraction of the contigs was assigned a cellular
process in the GO category biological process (87% of annotated contigs) (Figure 3a). We split the biological processes
further into different categories: the most abundant categories were 'protein metabolism/modification' (18% of assigned
contigs); 'housekeeping functions/metabolism' (17%); 'intracellular transport' (15%); 'cell cycle/proliferation' (13%);
'RNA metabolism' (13%); 'intracellular signaling' (8%); and

information

To identify potential domains in the axolotl contigs, we performed RPS-BLAST searches against the conserved domain
database (CDD, NCBI) [12,18] using the default cutoff Evalue of 0.01. A total of 2,199 (34.5%) contigs had a known
protein domain in either the CDD or the SMART or PFAM
databases. A detailed list of common protein domains identified in our dataset is given in Table 5. Among the protein
domains identified were homeobox domains such as HOX,

PAX and Prox1, eight helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains, RNAbinding domains such as KH and RRM, 69 kinase domains,
metal- and lipid binding domains and domains involved in
cell-cycle control and ubiquitination (RING fingers, HECT
domains, three cullin domains and 12 cyclin domains). Many
of these domains were annotated for the first time in a
sequence from A. mexicanum. We also compared the occurrence of those domains in other vertebrate species. For most
of the common protein domains, only a fraction were found in
our dataset; many of these are quite abundant compared to X.
laevis or Gallus gallus. The RNA-binding domains KH and
RRM especially showed high abundance in our contigs. A
complete list of domains is downloadable from [16].

We were interested to see if there were strong differences in
the sequence representation of the libraries that reflect the
different biological processes taking place in each tissue. To
this end, we compared the representation of ESTs in the two
libraries. This type of in silico differential display has been
performed for ESTs in the NCBI collection, and, as with the
NCBI differential display data, we have assessed the statistical significance of the differences using Fisher's exact test. A
total of 104 contigs met the cutoff value of 0.005 in Fisher's
exact test and can therefore be considered differentially
expressed.
Table 4 provides a detailed comparison of EST representation
categorized according to their biological process annotation.
Considering the biological properties of the blastema tissue
versus the neural tube tissue, we were particularly interested
in differential display results of gene sequences that had been
assigned to the biological functions of RNA metabolism (as an
indicator of an high proliferation index), cell cycle and proliferation and differentiation. The blastema library was produced from tail tissue that was in the process of forming the
blastema progenitor cells for regeneration. Blastema
formation involves dedifferentiation of mature cells, and
entry into rapid cell cycles. In contrast, the neural tube library
contains tissue undergoing cell specification and differentiation, such as neurogenesis and somitogenesis. Although these
embryonic tissues are still proliferating, the proliferation
index of the cells from neural tube should be lower than from
blastema.

The table shows contig identities and GenBank identifiers of existing A.
mexicanum ESTs that do not share any homology to a known protein
or nucleotide sequence and can therefore be considered unique.

We assigned cellular functions to the identified domains and
analyzed the output according to the functional distribution
of contigs (Figure 3b). The most abundant domains were
found in the category 'intracellular transport'; this is due to
redundant annotations of small GTPases. The second largest
fraction belonged to 'RNA-binding and metabolism', followed
by 'DNA-binding and transcriptional control'.

A total of 168 contigs annotated under RNA metabolism (127
when normalized to the ratio of sequenced ESTs from blastema and neural tube) were more frequently sequenced or
uniquely sequenced in blastema (6% of assigned contigs,
2.6% of all contigs). This group included RNA metabolism,
RNA processing, splicing, editing, nuclear export, binding,
catabolism, cleavage, capping, rRNA modification, rRNA
transcription and tRNA aminoacetylation. Forty-five contigs
assigned a process in RNA metabolism were upregulated or
unique in neural tube (2% of assigned and 0.7% of all contigs). After Fisher's exact test analysis, 24 of the clones were
considered differentially regulated in the two libraries; 22 out
of the 24 contigs were enriched or unique in blastema (Table
4).

Cell cycle and proliferation
126 contigs (95 when normalized to sequencing ratios) were
assigned as cell-cycle genes (5% of assigned contigs and 1.5%
of total contigs) and were more frequently sequenced or

52 in the neural tube library (2.5% and 0.8%, respectively).

In contrast, we obtained a quite different picture when we
examined the CDKN1 family. In most vertebrates, this family
consists of three members: p21 (CDKN1A), p27Kip1 (CDKN1B)
and p57 (CDKN1C). In X. laevis, however, only a single family
member called p28Kix1 (also called p27Xic1), which shows unusual sequence features compared to the p27 sequences from
any other vertebrate species, had been described in the literature [24,25]. We wondered whether A. mexicanum harbored
the 'canonical' p27Kip1 or a p28Kix1 similar to that of Xenopus.
We initially searched our A. mexicanum data for CDKN1

interactions

We examined our dataset for genes that are potentially useful
for studying regeneration features or developmental processes. To this end, we analyzed our data for genes that are
either involved in regulating the cell cycle - as would be
expected for the highly proliferative tissue of a regenerating
body structure - or could play an essential role during
development and metamorphosis from the larval to the adult
stage. A list of genes that could be assigned to either cell-cycle
regulation or development is shown in Table 6. Among the
genes involved in cell-cycle regulation were A-, B- and E-type
cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), Polo kinase, the
kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, the protein phosphatase Cdc25A, as
well as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) activator

The EST collection will provide rich data for the phylogenetic
comparison of particular genes. Cell cycle and cell differentiation are cellular functions that have been modified in various
organisms through evolution and it will be interesting to
understand the evolutionary basis of such changes. Here we
analyze a particularly interesting gene family, the CDKN1
family of cell-cycle regulators which inhibit cell-cycle progression by binding to and inactivating CDKs. As a starting
point for phylogenetic analysis, the mitochondrial 12S
ribosomal RNA gene from our collection resulted in the
expected tree, with the anuran amphibian X. laevis and the
caudate A. mexicanum grouping together compared to other
vertebrates such as fish, birds and mammals (Figure 4a).
Next, we constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree to compare members of the cyclin B family - cyclins B1, B2 and B3.
The sequences of each family member formed strictly separate groups, with the A. mexicanum and X. laevis cyclin B1,
B2 and B3 genes grouping with their vertebrate orthologs
(Figure 4b).

refereed research

As mentioned earlier, the Mexican axolotl is an important
model organism for a number of reasons. First, it is the premier vertebrate model for studying regeneration. Second
some aspects of caudate development, for instance mesoderm
involution and notochord formation, more closely resemble
those found in higher vertebrates than do those in other
amphibian embryological models such as X. laevis [19].
Finally, the axolotl has interesting developmental features,
particularly in relation to metamorphosis. The axolotl undergoes 'cryptic metamorphosis', which is defined by its existence in a perrenibranchiate state and retaining some larval
features into adulthood (for instance gills, larval skin morphology, caudal fins). The animals become sexually mature in
this state, and develop only small rudimentary lungs. So far,
very few markers are available to study these processes in this
organism.

Whereas proliferation-associated genes were found with a
higher sequence representation in the blastema library, genes
that had been electronically annotated as involved in 'cell differentiation' had a higher representation in the neural tube
library. A total of 28 contigs were electronically assigned the
biological process 'differentiation'. After Fisher's exact test,
five contigs showed differential regulation in this group.
Three out of the five contigs were found in neural tube (Table

appear to correlate with the physiological processes taking

proteins Cdc20 and Cdh1. Representing genes involved in
developmental processes, we found transcription factors such
as HoxA2, B12, C4 and C8, Pax6, as well as Cdx1 and Cdx2.
Furthermore we found several genes for proteins that are part
of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling
pathway, such as TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein 1
(BMP-1), BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor,
activin receptor type II, as well as the transcription factors
Smad5 and Smad8. Genes for proteins such as Smad8 and
BMPs might be of especial interest to the research field of
embryonic development, as they have been associated with
mesoderm involution [20]. Other important developmental
genes that could be found in our dataset include those for
Wnt5 and Wnt8, Sonic hedgehog, retinoblastoma binding
protein 2, beta-catenin, as well as Frizzled 2, 5 and 7. Finally,
it has been shown that the thyroid hormone receptor pathway
has an essential role in the timing of metamorphosis in A.
mexicanum [21-23]. We identified the protein TRIP12 (thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 12), which is a
HECT-domain-containing ubiquitin ligase and could have an
essential role in regulating thyroid hormone response during
development and/or metamorphosis.

Second, CDKN1B (p27Kip1) and CDKN1C (p57) were present
in the A. mexicanum databases but were not found in either
X. laevis or X. tropicalis, which have far more EST and
genome sequence information (Table 7, Figure 4c,d). While it
is not possible to conclude definitively that Xenopus species
lack these genes, the current data are highly suggestive of
such a scenario.

This data mining revealed two striking features about the distribution of CDKN1 family members among vertebrates
(Table 7). First, the p28Kix1 orthologs were only found in
amphibians (X. tropicalis, X. laevis, A. mexicanum, A. tigrinum tigrinum). We were not able to identify a p28Kix1-like
gene in any other database. These p28 orthologs group as a
distinct branch in an unrooted phylogenetic tree (Figure
4c,d). These data so far suggest that the p28 family is a CDK
inhibitor that is specific for amphibians. With new genome
sequence data being released, it will be interesting to see
whether the most closely related lineage of birds contains a
p28-like gene or whether this gene family is found solely in
amphibians.

reports

We examined in depth the phylogenetic relationships of the
CDKN1 family members among vertebrates by constructing
unrooted phylogenetic trees, either using the most conserved,
amino-terminal 88-amino-acid domain, which includes the
functionally important Cdk2-interaction region, or the entire
coding sequence. Analysis of the amino terminus showed that
while A. mexicanum p27 and p57 clearly grouped with their
respective orthologs from other vertebrates, the p28Kix1 proteins from axolotl and the two Xenopus species clustered as a
group distinct from any of the other CDKN1 families (Figure
4c). The p28Kix1 family showed a closer relationship to p57
than to other CDKN1 members, branching off close to the p57
family. Phylogenetic analysis using the entire coding
sequence of the CDKN1 genes, which includes the Cdk2- and
PCNA-binding site, resulted in a closer grouping of p28 with
the p27 branch (Figure 4d). In both cases, however, the p28
family clearly formed a separate group from the other CDKN1
families.

orthologs and, in contrast to Xenopus, we found a bona fide
p27Kip1 sequence that clusters closer to vertebrate p27Kip1
sequences compared to the Xenopus p28Kix1 (Figure 4c,d).
Considering this interesting finding, we then undertook a
more complete analysis of the CDKN1 family in vertebrates by
searching for CDKN1 family members in several databases:
the sequenced genomes from human, mouse, rat, fugu or
zebrafish, the recently released genome sequence of X. tropicalis, the X. laevis EST collection, the zebrafish and fugu
genomes, and a complementary A. mexicanum and A. tigrinum EST set generated by Putta et al. [26].

Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of domains that had been annotated to a protein sequence from A. mexicanum prior to this project.

The Ambystoma mexicanum EST database
A relational database with a web-based front end was created
to store, navigate and annotate analyzed contigs. The main
object of the database is the annotated sequence contig, which
contains information about its length, putative identity, computationally calculated expression profile, GO annotation,
homologous proteins and identified domains, as well as
number and identity of ESTs that build the contig (Figure 5a).
The Gene Identifier (GI) and GO annotation can be modified
by the administrator. To circumvent the problem of split contigs, we introduced a super-contig, to which related contigs
can be assigned. Furthermore, the administrator can modify
the relationship of EST to contig manually. All protein and
domain alignments, as well as the assembly of the EST
sequences of a contig are stored and can be viewed by the
user. On the contig main page, three homologs at most from
selected species are shown, with a full list of homologs from
selected species displayed on the protein information page
(Figure 5c). To make use easier, an image of the identified
domains with the beginning and end base pair of the
alignment is shown on the contig page. Individual ESTs can

be accessed via the contig page, including their length, storage information, quality information and available trimmed
EST-sequence (Figure 5b).
Some of the main advantages of this database are: first, the
direct links to source databases such as the NCBI sequence
database, GO database, CDD, and the Smart and Pfam databases for identified domains; second, direct visualization of
source data such as sequence alignments of contigs to
homologs and domains, as well as alignments of EST assemblies; third, easy retrieval of sequences for further analysis
like BLAST-searching; fourth, user-specific annotation of
contigs; and fifth, easy manipulation and editing of contig
annotations. The database will be available from [27].

This and other evidence indicates that A. mexicanum and
other urodele amphibians are likely to have retained more
ancestral features in common with the 'primitive' tetrapod
compared to X. laevis, which appears to be more derived. It is
interesting that we observed such segregation on the
sequence level of the CDKN1 family. X. laevis appears to have
a highly unusual make-up of CDKN1 family members. So far,
CDKN1A (p21) and the highly derived p28Kix1 are the only
CDKN1 family members found in both X. laevis and X. tropicalis. In contrast, the ambystomatids appear to have all the
members of the CDKN1-family - including p28Kix1 - assuming
that the p21 gene is missing purely as a result of lack of
sequence information. In addition, our data suggest that p28
is an amphibian-specific variant of the CDKN1 family. Two
major questions arise from these data: first, does the amphibian-specific p28 fulfill a cellular function that is unique to this
phylogenetic lineage; and second, does the genotypic difference in the gene set of the CDKN1 family in the two amphibian species account for the macroscopic differences observed
in developmental mechanisms. The fact that the CDKN1 family is an essential regulator of the cell cycle opens new possibilities for experimental research along these lines.

Given the estimates in the number of genes present in the
human genome (20,000-50,000) [28], we estimate that our
EST contig set (6,377) contains between 10 to 25% of the total
number of genes in the axolotl. While the database is not yet
complete, it represents a significant proportion of the axolotl
transcriptome. Further sequencing efforts, including an NIHfunded EST sequencing project for the axolotl [26], will
enlarge the current dataset to provide a comprehensive gene
sequence resource for this organism. Our analysis indicates
that the majority of A. mexicanum genes are homologous to
genes present in other vertebrates. Sixty-six percent of contigs gave a significant match in either the non-redundant protein or nucleotide databases, the EST databases or the human
and fugu protein databases. Thirty-four percent of contigs
could not be assigned a homolog in any of the searched databases, and 44% of those could not be assigned a coding
sequence and are therefore considered to be part of the UTR.
Nineteen percent of the contigs seem to represent novel genes
that have not been found in any other organism so far.

Figure 4 (see previous page)etic analysis of the vertebrate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs) p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2)
Phylogen (see previous page)
Phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs) p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2). (a) Reference phylogenetic
tree of mitochondrial 12S rRNA. The Caudata and Salientia both branch out to build the amphibian group. (b) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the cyclin B1
gene family. The amphibian cyclin B1 family members form a distinct group. (c) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the amino-terminal CDK-inhibitory domain
of vertebrate p21, p27, p28 and p57, which is conserved between the protein families. p27 of A. mexicanum clearly groups with the p27 proteins from
other vertebrates. The amphibian-specific p28-family does not parse with any singe group. Note, however, that unlike the 12S rRNA tree, the A.
mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum p27 branch out with that of D. rerio. (d) Unrooted, phylogenetic tree of the full-length kinase inhibitor sequences. Using the
full-length protein sequences from the CKI families, the p28 family branches off between the p21 and p27 families. (e) Multiple sequence alignment of the
amino-terminal, CDK-inhibitory region of the CKI families. The protein sequence of A. mexicanum p27 is clearly the ortholog of the p27 family, yet displays
higher than expected divergence on the protein level. The same divergence is observed for the ambystomatid p57 proteins. The p28 family has extremely
high sequence divergence compared to any other CDKN1 family member. Conserved residues between the three CDKN1 families are highlighted in
green and the p28-family in light blue. Residues that differ between ambystomatid sequences and the other vertebrate species are highlighted in the
ambystomatid sequences in red. Accession numbers are: NM_131513 (D. rerio ccnb1), NM_031966 (H. sapiens ccnb1), BC041302 (X. laevis ccnb1),

per site.

The ESTs were derived from two cDNA libraries, stage 18-22
embryonic neural tube/notochord/somite tissue, and day-6
regenerating tail tissue. The embryonic library represents a
developmental stage where tissue specification is occurring,
whereas the blastema library represents a tissue that is
undergoing dedifferentiation, rapid proliferation and cell
respecification. Accordingly, we find differences in transcript
representation in the two libraries. The blastema library is
particularly enriched in cell-cycle genes and RNA metabolism
genes, presumably reflecting the high proliferative index of
the early regenerating blastema.

sequence libraries, reflecting their biological source - regenerating blastema being in a highly proliferative state and
embryonic neural tube being a tissue undergoing differentiation. Sequence analysis of assembled contigs revealed that
64% of genes had a putative homolog in other species; 19.4%
of the contigs contained a putative coding sequence and can
be considered novel genes. From this, we conclude that A.
mexicanum does not contain an unusually high number of
organism-specific genes. The CDK inhibitor family CDKN1
was selected for comparative phylogenetic analysis. Unlike
the frogs X. laevis and X. tropicalis, ambystomatids most
probably contain all members of the CDKN1 family, including
the amphibian-specific protein p28Kix1/p27Xic1, which shows
unusual sequence divergence compared to CDKN1 members
in other vertebrate species. Such data would support the contention that A. mexicanum is closer to a basal tetrapod compared to X. laevis. The EST sequences and annotated contigs
presented in this paper will be a publicly available and useful
resource for research in various fields.

Conclusions

This set of 17,352 ESTs from A. mexicanum was generated to
provide a comprehensive sequence dataset for the community of biologists. Forty percent of genes could still be found
in singlets, which reflects a high diversity of sequences in our
cDNA set. Annotation of the assembled contigs revealed a
substantial difference in gene representation in the two

Plasmid cDNA library construction

The sequences were submitted to GenBank. After quality control, individual ESTs were used to search the non-redundant
protein database (release of July 2004) using the program
BLASTX from the standalone NCBI-BLAST package [12]. For
annotation of sequenced ESTs, the top hit of the BLAST output was used, whereby an E-value of 1e-20 was used for significant similarity and an E-value of 1e-05 was used as a cutoff
value for weak similarity.

Analysis and assembly of sequence data

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R67

information

Quality control of sequenced ESTs was performed using the
program Phred [11] using a cutoff of 20 for trimming lowquality regions, and vector trimming was performed using the
program cross-match [11]. (We note here that the arbitrary
Phred score reflects the likelihood of a false base. A Phred
score of 20 indicates that in 1 out of 100 trials (102), the base
would be false, 30 would reflect a wrongly sequenced base in
1 of 1,000 trials (103), and so forth.) Sequence and contig files
can be downloaded at [16]. The resulting high-quality
sequences were assembled into sequence contigs with the
program TIGR-Assembler version 2 [13]. Alignment of contigs was performed with the program ClustalW with the settings Gap Opening 5 and Gap Extension 85 [29] or Cap3 [30],
when ClustalW could not correctly assemble the sequences.
Assembled contigs were used to perform BLAST searches
(BLASTX, BLASTN from NCBI-BLAST [12]) against the nonredundant protein sequence database (release of November
2003), human and fugu protein databases and the NCBI EST
database, all downloaded from the NCBI. Domain searches
were done with RPS-BLAST against the conserved domain
database (CDD [18]) from the NCBI. BLAST and domainsearch output files were parsed for homologous sequences,

interactions

For sequencing reactions, the DNA preparation was diluted
fivefold with distilled water. Sequencing reactions were performed using the DYEnamic ET Dye terminator kit diluted
twofold with DYEnamic ET dilution buffer (AP Biotech). Five
microliters of DNA was added to 5 µl of sequencing reaction

refereed research

For sequencing, single-pass reads from the 5' end of the
library inserts were performed using a custom-designed SP6
primer: GCACATTAGGCCTATTTAGGTGACA. DNA from
bacterial library clones was amplified using the Templiphi
reaction, based on φ29 rolling-circle replication of DNA (AP
Biotech). Briefly, approximately 0.5 µl of bacterial glycerol
stocks were picked up using 96-pin plastic replicators
(Genetix) and centrifuged into 96-well PCR plates. Five
microliters of denaturing buffer was added, and samples
heated to 95°C for 3 min. After cooling, 5 µl Templiphi
enzyme was added and samples incubated overnight in a
30°C incubator. The Templiphi reaction provides two advantages for large-scale sequencing projects on capillary
sequencers. First, the reaction proceeds to an endpoint where
all nucleotide is incorporated, yielding uniform quantities of
DNA from varying amounts of starting bacteria (or DNA).
Second, the rolling-circle reaction results in large pieces of
DNA that, in contrast to plasmid DNA, do not enter the capillary and interfere with the sequencing run.

The redundancy of the arrayed libraries was tested by performing BLASTN searches [12] against all sequenced ESTs
from the two libraries. Hits against clones other than the
query with an E-value lower than 1e-50 were considered for
clustering.

Analysis of library quality
reports

Total RNA was purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) from 6-day
regenerating tail blastemas and from neural tube-somitenotochord-containing tissue dissected from stage 18-22 A.
mexicanum embryos. Total RNA quality was assessed by
determining the relative brightness of the 28S:18S rRNA
bands (2:1). For library construction mRNA was purified and
size fractionated, then poly(dT)-primed cDNA was synthesized and directionally cloned into the NotI-SalI sites of the
pCMVSport6 vector. DNA was transformed by electroporation into EMDH10B-TONA bacteria (library construction
performed by Invitrogen). Two separate, unnormalized
libraries were produced. The blastema library contained an
average insert size of 1.67 kb and 2.67 × 107 independent
transformants and the neural tube library had an average
insert size of 1.5 kb and 1.9 × 107 transformants. From each
library 100,000 clones were arrayed into 384-well plates
(Resource Zentrum/Primary Database, Berlin, Germany).

whereby an E-value of 1e-05 was used as a cutoff for BLASTN
and BLASTX searches against the sequence databases and the
default cut-off of 0.01 was considered to yield significant
homology to conserved domains from CDD. A gene identifier
was assigned to those contigs that showed reliable homology
to a sequence in the non-redundant database (E-value cutoff
of 1e-20 for significant similarity and 1e-05 for weak similarity). Potential untranslated regions were identified using the
program ESTScan [31].

Electronic annotation of contigs
Based on the GO annotation of the closest annotated
homolog, contigs were assigned a molecular function,
biological process and cellular component from the GO database [17]. To this end, the GenBank annotation files from the
GO database were downloaded and parsed for the gene
identifier (gi) numbers of previously identified homologs. The
cutoff for annotating an A. mexicanum contig was an E-value
of 1e-20.

Database design
A relational database was created using the open source software MySQL as the database server to store and navigate
through resulting sequence contigs and annotations. Scripts
connecting the web-based front end to the database were
written in the programming language Python.

Isolation of the full-length p27Kip1 gene from the EST
sequence
Two EST sequences of the p27Kip1 gene were sequenced in the
EST collection but neither were full-length sequences. To isolate the full-length sequence, 200,000 clones of our arrayed
blastema and neural tube libraries were screened by PCR.
Briefly, the bacterial library clones in each 384-well plate
were pooled, mini-prepped and arrayed into 96-well plates
(RZPD, Berlin), resulting in 576 DNA pools. These DNA pools
were screened by PCR using the custom SP6 primer (GCACATTAGGCCTATTTAGGTGACA) as a forward primer and a
gene-specific p27 reverse primer (TGATTTCCAATGGCTGGTTT). Fifty nanograms of DNA from each pool was used
for PCR reactions and PCR cycling was performed at the following conditions: 94°C 2 min, 30 cycles of 94°C 15 sec,
65.5°C 30 sec, 72°C 90 sec, followed by 72°C 7 min). The largest positive band (1.1 kb) was gel purified and sequenced on
an ABI377 machine using the SP6 primer.

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments were done with the program
ClustalX [32] using standard parameters. Phylogenetic
analysis of mitochondrial 12S rRNA was done using the programs dnadist, phylogenetic analysis of the cyclin B family
and the CDK inhibitor family (CKI family) was done using
protdist, both from the Phylip package [33]. Trees were calculated with the program fitch from the same software package,
using 100 iterations. For the CKI family, only the amino-terminal, CDK-inhibitory domain or the full-length sequences
were used for construction of a phylogenetic tree. For the cyclin-B family, only the region overlapping in A. mexicanum
contigs was used for tree construction. Trees were displayed
using the program nj-plot [34] for the mitochondrial 12S
rRNA tree and unrooted [34] for the CKI- and cyclin B
families.
