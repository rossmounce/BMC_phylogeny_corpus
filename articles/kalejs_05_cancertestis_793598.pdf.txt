CTA genesgametogenesispolyploidy

Abstract
Genes expressed both in normal testis and in malignancies (Cancer/ Testis associated genes – CTA)
have become the most extensively studied antigen group in the field of tumour immunology.
Despite this, many fundamentally important questions remain unanswered: what is the connection
between germ-cell specific genes and tumours? Is the expression of these genes yet another proof
for the importance of genome destabilisation in the process of tumorigenesis?, or maybe activation
of these genes is not quite random but instead related to some programme giving tumours a
survival advantage?
This review collates most of the recent information available about CTAs expression, function, and
regulation. The data suggests a programme related to ontogenesis, mostly to gametogenesis. In the
"brain-storming" part, facts in conflict with the hypothesis of random CTA gene activation are
discussed. We propose a programme borrowed from organisms phylogenetically much older than
humans, which existed before the differentiation of sexes. It is a programme that has served as a
life cycle with prominent ploidy changes, and from which, as we know, the germ-cell ploidy cycle –
meiosis – has evolved. Further work may show whether this hypothesis can lead to a novel antitumour strategy.

Introduction
Cancer/Testis (CT) antigens are a group of tumour antigens with gene expression restricted to male germ cells in
the testis and to various malignancies. Their function in
tumours is enigmatic and a common between testis genes
(gametogenesis) and cancer remains elusive. When the
causal link is not evident, it is tempting to believe the
association is random, and assign it to general aspects of
"genome instability in cancer". However, we believe a
more direct link may exist. As suggested in this review,
possible clues may be found in the common evolutionary

pathway between ploidy cycles in meiosis and polyploidy
in tumour cells. The latter, along with CT antigen expression, is a characteristic feature of well-progressed tumours.
However, before discussing such possibilities, it is necessary to review the established literature.
The search for tumour antigens began in the 1960's with
two groups identifying first alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a
serum marker for hepatoma and germ-cell tumours [1],
and then carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a serum
marker for colon and other epithelial cancers [2]. These

antigens were discovered using heterogenous sera
acquired by immunizing laboratory animals with human
tumour material. However, only during the 90's did both
cellular [3,4] and humoral [5] immune responses to
human tumours get proper molecular definitions.
The first CTA, MAGEA-1, was identified in 1991 by Boon
and colleagues using T-cell epitope cloning, a very complicated and time-consuming method [3]. In 1995 the
SEREX (serological expression cloning) technique to identify tumour antigens was developed by Pfreundschuh and
colleagues [5], which remains the leading approach to
identifying new antigens that elicit humoral immune
responses. Besides MAGEA1, BAGE, and GAGE1 discovered by T-cell epitope cloning, SEREX very soon displayed
more tumour antigens with a cancer/testis restricted
expression profile (SSX2, NY-ESO-1, and SYCP-1). The
term "cancer-testis (CT) antigen" was introduced by Chen
et al. [6], who recognized this group of genes had little in
common except their expression profile.
By initial definition, expression of genes coding for CT
antigens should be restricted in normal tissues to male
germ cells in the testis and to malignancies of various histological types. However, the criteria proposed in the 90's
are not true for all antigens of this group as seen today.
Furthermore, for many of the recently discovered gene
products with the described expression profile, no T-cell
recognized epitopes have hitherto been identified. This is
why CTA – "Cancer/Testis Associated" is a more appropriate name for this family of genes (and will be used in this
context further in this review), because a lot of its members still need to be proven as possessing antigenic properties in cancer patients.
Attributing genes to the CTA gene family is based on several characteristic features [7,8]:
1. Predominant expression in germ cells of the testis and
generally not in other normal tissues.
2. Expression in a number of malignant tumours of various histological types.
3. Mapping of the gene to the X-chromosome
4. Membership of a multigene family.
5. Antigenic properties in tumour-bearing patients.
Some exceptions to these criteria for certain CTAs will be
described and discussed later.

Expression of CTA genes
To date, 89 individual CTA genes or isoforms have been
described, which are organised in to 44 families (see additional file 1). From these, 19 families are testis-restricted,
and 11 show additional expression in one or two somatic
tissues. Nine are expressed in 3–6 tissue types besides testis, and 5 are ubiquitously somatically expressed. With the
exception of the testis-restricted CTAs, the others also
show expression in the pancreas but at levels as much as
10 × lower than in testis (based on mRNA expression levels from [9]). Expression of CTA was first shown in
melanoma and all the classic CTA are expressed in this
type of tumour, but since the 1980's, expression in various
other tumours has been recognised (additional file 2).

The expression pattern of CTAs during spermatogenesis is
of special interest. Functional analysis of these genes during gametogenesis might well give some clues about their
possible role in tumours. Their expression is restricted
exclusively to spermatogenic germ cells with other tubular
cells (e.g. Leydig and Sertoli) being negative. This fits well
with the findings of Yuasa et al. [10] who demonstrated
that CTAs have much higher expression frequencies in the
germ cell cancers (seminomas) than non-seminomas..
Different CTAs are expressed during different stages of
spermatogenesis (Fig. 1.), so one may imagine that their
functions are versatile, starting from regulation of mitotic
cycling in spermatogonia, association with the meiotic
cycle in spermatocytes, and finalizing with acrosome maturation in sperm.
In normal tissues, expression of NY-ESO1, MAGE-A3, -A4,
and -A8 through -A11 as well as of several members of the
XAGE gene family is found in the placenta. NY-ESO1 and
several XAGEs are also expressed in the fetal ovary [1113].
Regulation of CTA expression
The mechanisms involved in regulation of CTA expression
have recently been comprehensively reviewed by Albert
Zendman et al [14]. Thus, only a short recitation of some
of the main points is provided here.

Mostly, methylation processes are responsible for the
ectopic derepression of CTA genes. Using the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5DC), expression of
several CTAs in cultured tumour cell lines can be induced/
upregulated [15]. 5DC entraps DNA methyltransferases in
a complex with DNA, which leads to progressive loss of
DNA methylation, thereby releasing transcriptional
blockage. Such upregulated expression has been reported
for several MAGE members – LAGE-1, SSX-2, CAGE, NYESO-1. For MAGE-A1, demethylation is necessary and sufficient for gene expression, suggesting demethylation is

the primary mechanism of transcription control [16]. In
this context, a recent discovery of a CTA, viz. 'Boris', is
interesting. Boris is reported as being expressed in several
types of malignancies, and normally plays a major role in
regulating methylation processes during spermatogenesis
– it removes imprinting from genes during the last mitotic
division of spermatocytes (reviewed in [17]). Several lines
of evidence indicate that expression of some CTAs is
dependent not only on demethylation, but on other transcriptional mechanisms.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, on their own or
in combination with 5DC, can also induce CTA expression, including MAGE, SSX, and NY-ESO-1 family members [15]. The CTA-rich region in Xp11.21-22 (e.g. SSX,
MAGE-B) may escape X-chromosomal inactivation, but
these genes are not normally expressed in females [18].
While global hypomethylation is common and prominent in colorectal cancer, few CTAs have ever been
reported as expressed in this type of cancer [19]. Nondemethylation dependent induction of MAGE expression
has been demonstrated by Park et al. [20], demonstrating
that 40 mM NaCl induces the transcriptional and translational activation of MAGE-B1 and -B2 in specific tissues at
hypertonic conditions.
There exist definite expression patterns (sets) of different
CTAs in certain tumours. Marked heterogeneity of CTA
expression is found in cells of some tumours, which cannot easily be explained by a global demethylation process
[21-24]. The mechanisms of ectopic transcriptional activation of CTA genes clearly needs more investigation.
Function
Information regarding the function and cellular localization of CTAs is far less comprehensive. Often the proposed function is based purely on sequence homology
with another protein of a known function. The only CTA
proteins functionally established in gametogenesis are
SCP-1, involved in chromosome pairing during meiosis
[7], OY-TES-1 which functions in acrosin packaging in the
acrosome of sperm heads [25], SPO11 acting as a meiosisspecific endonuclease [26], and BORIS, which is involved
in cancellation of imprinting by epigenetic reprogramming during the final round of mitosis in spermatogenesis
[27]. However, contrary to the situation in meiosis where
it is rapidly degraded after the meiotic prophase in spermatocytes, SCP-1 expression in tumours is not cell cycle
restricted [7]. BORIS is a paralog of CTCF. CTCF is a highly
versatile 11 zinc-finger factor involved in various aspects
of gene regulation – X chromosome inactivation, reading
of imprinting sites, etc. [27]. During spermatogenesis,
Boris is expressed later than many other CTA genes ([27];
Fig. 1.).

http://www.cancerci.com/content/5/1/4

Suggestions for the functions of other CTAs mostly arose
from studies of their homology with some well-known
proteins and their domains, TSP50 being protease-like,
CT17 phospholipase-like, and CT15 metalloproteinaselike [28]. The CT15 gene encodes a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) domain 2, which is a member of
the ADAM protein family [29]. Members of this family are
membrane-anchored proteins structurally related to snake
venom disintegrins, which have been implicated in a variety of biologic processes involving cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions, including fertilization, muscle development,
and neurogenesis. This member is a subunit of an integral
sperm membrane glycoprotein called fertilin, which plays
an important role in sperm-egg interactions [30]. It is a
membrane metalloproteinase with a possible role in
tumour evasion and metastasis.
LDHC, the germ cell-specific member of the lactate dehydrogenase family, escapes from transcriptional repression,
resulting in significant expression levels in virtually all
tumour types tested. It might contribute to the constitutive activation of an anaerobic pathway in tumours,
because its expression in tumours is not dependent on
hypoxia [31].
Suggestions as to the role of MAGEs with a CTA expression
profile mainly depend on studies of their ubiquitously
expressed family members (e.g. Necdin, MAGE-D1,
NRAGE, Dlxin-1). In general, the data point to a role for
MAGEs via transcriptional regulation in cell cycle control
and apoptosis. F.ex, Necdin-related MAGE proteins differentially interact with the E2F1 transcription factor and the
p75 neurotrophin receptor [32]. The high level of homology among members of the MAGE family in both mouse
and human suggests an important function both in testis
and cancer.
The products of the SSX genes belong to the family of
highly homologous synovial sarcoma X (SSX) breakpoint
proteins. These proteins may function as transcriptional
repressors; SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4 genes have been
involved in the t (X;18) translocation characteristically
found in all synovial sarcomas [33-35]. This translocation
results in the fusion of the synovial sarcoma translocation
gene (SYT) on chromosome 18 to one of the SSX genes on
chromosome X. The encoded hybrid proteins are probably responsible for transforming activity. In the nucleus of
sarcoma cells, both diffuse and speckled localisations of
SSX protein have been reported [36,37].
The HOM-TES-85 protein has structural peculiarities that
are shared exclusively with the N-myc oncoprotein. However, functional studies are required for confirmation
[38]. Besides, the C-myc proto-oncogene is a normal participant of spermatogenesis (Fig. 2).

BRDT is similar to the RING3 protein family. It possesses
2 bromodomain motifs and a PEST sequence (a proline,
glutamic acid, serine, and threonine cluster) characteristic
of proteins that undergo rapid intracellular degradation).
The bromodomain is found in proteins that regulate transcription [39].
PLU-1, a large multi-domain nuclear protein also has a
strong transcriptional repression activity. It is a member of
the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins. Plu-1 mRNA
and PLU-1 protein are both highly expressed in the
mitotic spermatogonia. The expression is reduced in the
early prophase I stages (leptotene, zygotene), but reappears at pachytene, still being detectable in diplotene
cells. It is located diffusely over the nucleus. PLU-1 might
have a role in regulating meiotic transcription, restricted
to certain meiotic stages [40].
The protein encoded by the SPANX gene targets the
nucleus and associates with nuclear vacuoles and the
redundant nuclear envelope in sperm cells [41]. In situ
hybridization of human testis sections showed SPAN-X
mRNA expression in round and elongated spermatids
[42]. These redundant nuclear envelopes have a unique
structure of limited chromatin sheets continued as annulate lamellae. Both these enigmatic structures have also
been described in intact lymphomas [43] and irradiated
lymphomas [44].
The protein encoded by IL13RA1 gene is a subunit of the
interleukin-13 receptor. This subunit forms a receptor
complex with IL-4 receptor alpha, a subunit shared by IL13 and IL-4 receptors. This subunit serves as a primary IL13-binding subunit of the IL-13 receptor, and may also be
a component of IL-4 receptors. This protein binds tyrosine
kinase TYK2, and thus may mediate the signalling processes that lead to the activation of JAK1, STAT3 and STAT6
induced by IL-13 and IL-4 [45].
SGY-1 (soggy-1), a secreted protein related to the Dickkopf protein family, is involved in suppressing the Wnt
signal-transduction pathway controlling transcription
activation of genes such as c-myc, c-jun, Fra, and cyclin D1
by preventing the accumulation of beta-catenin [46,47].
Wnt proteins are implicated in a wide variety of biologic
processes including cell fate determination and patterning
in early embryos, and in cell growth and/or differentiation in certain adult mammalian tissues [48]. Wnts can
induce proliferation in different types of stem cells
[49,50]. The importance of Wnt signalling during tumorigenesis has been recently emphasised [51,52].
NY-ESO-1 is one of the most immunogenic and therapeutically promising CTAs but functional studies on this gene
are severely lagging behind its practical application.

http://www.cancerci.com/content/5/1/4

Unlike the majority of CTA genes, NY-ESO-1 stops its
expression in well-progressed tumours, so it can be used
as a marker to follow the early progression of testicular
tumorigenesis [53].
CAGE [54] and HAGE [55] code for proteins with helicase-like features. Probably, it might be involved in
recombination exchange in testis and recombination
DNA repair in tumours.
TPX-1 is now seen as an integral protein of the outer dense
fibres and the acrosome of spermatids in rats [56].
In summary, we see that the functions of individual CTA,
when known, are very diverse, including, for example,
both activators and repressors of proliferation and
transcription.
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity in cancer patients is elicited only by
short peptide sequences of CTA epitopes, which are presented on the tumour cell surface by HLA Class I molecules in the case of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
mediated immune responses and by HLA Class II molecules on the surface of APC (antigen presenting cells), in
the case of T-helper cell (TH) mediated immune
responses. Identification of these epitopes is one of the
main goals of CTA research. Knowledge of epitopes recognized by the immune system allows the creation of the
tumour-specific vaccines. In the vaccination process, Tcell epitopes are often administered together with different adjuvants or cytokines, or delivered using peptide
pulsed autologous dendritic cells, all of which are aimed
at enhancing the immune reaction [57]. Currently efforts
are being made to identify HLA class II restricted epitopes
in order to promote TH responses, which are required to
support the activity of CTLs, and provide a more "complete" immune response. However, vaccines designated to
prime the immune system against tumours expressing various CTA have so far shown only partial clinical success
[57-59].

Since the technique used to identify candidate tumour
antigens has changed from T-cell epitope cloning [3,60],
and SEREX (serological analysis of cDNA expression
libraries) [5,61,62] to differential gene expression analysis
by various techniques like RDA (representative difference
analysis) [63], DD (differential display) [64] and SSH
(suppression subtractive hybridization) [65] – and even
further to bioinformatics – we cannot really be sure about
the adequate use of the definition "antigen" in relation to
CTA gene products. Whilst the former two techniques are
dependent on the immunogenicity of specific epitopes in
cancer patients, the latter ones are simply based on mRNA
expression levels or even sequence homologies detected

via search engines and provide no answer about immunoreactivity. In additional file 1, one can see that an immune
response is documented against only 19 of 44 CTAs.
Immune recognition of the majority of these CTAs is cancer-related, occurring spontaneously in cancer patients,
not in cancer-free individuals. The exceptions to this are
humoral immune responses to MAGEB1/CT3.1 in systemic lupus erythematosus patients [66] and to SPA17/
CT22 in vasectomised men [67].
CTA can be considered to be tumour specific. There exists
the blood-testis barrier [68], which prevents the immune
system from contacting with CTA gene products. Besides
this, germinative cells do not express HLA class Ia molecules [69], so they cannot present their expressed proteins
to the immune system. For these reasons, the immune system never comes into contact with these proteins and recognizes them as "non-self" structures.
Brain-storming
The function of most CTAs is unknown, although some
role in regulation of gene expression (both activating and
repressing) seems likely [8]. Are CTAs oncogenes? By definition, oncogenes are normal cellular genes participating
in proliferation cascades, which are abnormally activated
in tumours [70]. Therefore, with the exception of one
(HOM-TES-85, which has structural homology with the
myc-oncogene) CTAs can not formally be regarded as
oncogenes. Are CTAs simply activated by the imbalanced
genome, due to its instability in tumours? Some, such as
SSX, whose ectopic expression is caused by the SYT-SSX
fusion due to translocation t (X;18) in synovial sarcomas,
certainly are. However, a large number of CTA genes are
only located on the X-chromosome and this chromosome
is not a specific site of chromosome breaks and translocations usually associated with tumours [71]. However, the
chromosome region 20q13.2 containing the BORIS gene
is commonly amplified or exhibits moderate gains of
material in many human cancers. This has strengthened
the idea that this region contains a major oncogene
[72,73]. A preliminary report using RT-PCR has found
that BORIS expression is detectable in over half of ~200
cancer cell lines studied, representing most of the major
forms of human tumours, discussed in [17]. However,
this observation awaits further confirmation. Theoretically, the aberrant expression of the amplified (by chance)
Boris, which by analogy with CTCF may demethylate CTA
genes located on X-chromosome, may in turn activate a
large body of CTA genes in human malignancies.
However, why are other gametogenesis-related CTA genes
also activated from other chromosomes? It does not look
like a chance event and therefore amplification of "Boris"
may still not be random.

http://www.cancerci.com/content/5/1/4

Diversity of functions, including genes involved in
ontogenesis suggest that CTAs are activated either as a
result of the genome instability (however, why testicular
genes?) or as part of a complex program. Also from this
point, this looks like a program related to gametogenesis.
The same idea was proposed by Old [8].
If CTAs generally do not enhance tumour growth except
by stimulating proliferation, like oncogenes, another possibility is that they could do it by stimulating DNA repair
or inhibiting apoptosis (combination of all three is possible). Indeed, some CTAs have relation to the DNA repair
factors by homologous recombination. These are SPO11,
SYCP1, helicase-like CAGE and HAGE acting in meiotic
prophase of gametogenesis. In turn, homologous recombination in tumours was shown to act anti-apoptotically
[74].
Are these CTAs restricted only to prophase of meiosis,
where recombination takes place? It appears not. For
example, some are associated with the spermatogonial
stage (Plu-1 mRNA and PLU-1), and some with maturation of the acrosome (see Fig. 1). It is a program again,
and why only male gametogenesis? But it also occurs in
oogenesis [8]. Thus, prophase of meiosis (pairing and
recombination) may be still the most important.
So, ectopic activation of CTA genes is not entirely random,
being induced from the sexual X-chromosome but also
from loci on other chromosomes, relating to gametogenesis. However, it is curious then that the very common
proto-oncogenes of proliferatives cascades also participate
in gametogenesis, e.g. myc, ras, jun, etc. This can be seen
in Fig 2, (taken from the Janis Erenpreiss [70]). He and
others postulated a link between gametogenesis and cancerogenesis before CTAs were revealed [75-77].
In turn, Old [8] looked at the problem from a new angle
and suggested that CTAs provide a causal link between
gametogenesis and cancer. This seems plausable, but does
this illegitimate program in tumours embrace, even mosaically, only gametogenesis? May be only the DNA recombination repair component is common? But the CTA
genes are repressing a wide Wnt family, which also functions in early embryogenesis.
The program sounds more like an ontogenetic (life-cycle)
one. Let us remember the experiments by Mintz and Illmeisee [19] who cloned normal genetic mosaic mice by
introducting the nuclei of malignant teratocarcinoma into
enucleated eggs. Both gametic, parthenogenetic and trophoblastic theories of cancer have also been proposed in
the past [8,70] and can be viewed as embryonal or ontogenetic theories of cancer.

In this context, expression of some CTAs by the placenta
is of interest because trophoblast and decidua are the only
mammalian tissue capable of endoreduplication creating
enormously large ploidies [84]. an ability shared by many
tumour cells. The latest studies on a silver fox revealed
somatic reduction in the giant cells of a trophoblast [85].
Now let us return to DNA recombination repair in
tumours as a means of survival, as already mentioned.
Repair by homologous recombination can protect malignant tumour cells from apoptosis. In particular, as shown
in our laboratory, endopolyploid cells employ this mechanism [86]. Likewise, expression of CTAs – endopolyploidy – is a hallmark of malignant tumour progression
where there is deficient TP53 function [87].

Another question is whether CTA genes govern a lifecycle-like program with its key events similar to meiosis?
In turn, to which process does meiosis provide a key –
recombination and reduction division? Are tumours capable of these? We also have to consider why X-chromosomes are involved, and not Y-chromosomes, which are
responsible for sex? Perhaps this is because the X-chromosome is better conserved evolutionary and appeared prior
to sex discrimination.
So, this looks like an ontogenetic program, which evolutionary preceded sexual (amphimictic) life-cycle, with the
key in recombination and reduction division; but what is
it? The answer is evident – ancient ploidy cycles [78,79].
In general, ploidy cycles are displayed as a cyclic increase
and reduction of ploidy (chromosome number), and
these involve the pairing of homologous chromosomes
and their segregation, omitting one round of DNA
replication.
There may be reduction of ploidy 2n-n (sexual meiosis) or
from nx to 2n DNA numbers, in the asexual ploidy cycles
characteristic for a few protists, as in Amoebae and
foraminiferans [80,81] as well as part of ontogenetic programs in the more developed taxons [82,83]. Contrary to
gametic reduction in sexual meiosis, the reduction of
ploidy in polyploid somatic cells is called "somatic
reduction".

In turn, some giant tumour cells show the capability to
segregate their genomes and return to mitosis ([86,88-91],
see Fig. 3).

Conclusion
A hypothesis is put forward that activation of at least some
of the CTA genes in p53-deficient human tumours could
be due to the genetic program running "relic" ploidy
cycles in tumour cells. This hypothesis offers new opportunities for the design of novel tumour treatment strategies. In particular, passive therapy using CTAs to prime the
host immune system against the tumour could be
replaced with gene therapy aimed to block the function of
CTA gene products or even their expression. This
approach is promising, because normally only the germ
cells in the testis express CTA genes and they are well protected by the blood-testis barrier. Thus, there should not
be any problem with tumour-specific priming, and
respectively we would predict there to be no side effects.
