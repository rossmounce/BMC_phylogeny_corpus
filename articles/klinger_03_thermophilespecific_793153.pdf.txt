Abstract
Background: To identify thermophile-specific proteins, we performed phylogenetic patterns
searches of 66 completely sequenced microbial genomes. This analysis revealed a cluster of
orthologous groups (COG1618) which contains a protein from every thermophile and no
sequence from 52 out of 53 mesophilic genomes. Thus, COG1618 proteins belong to the group of
thermophile-specific proteins (THEPs) and therefore we here designate COG1618 proteins as
THEP1s. Since no THEP1 had been analyzed biochemically thus far, we characterized the gene
product of aq_1292 which is THEP1 from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus
(aaTHEP1).
Results: aaTHEP1 was cloned in E. coli, expressed and purified to homogeneity. At a temperature
optimum between 70 and 80°C, aaTHEP1 shows enzymatic activity in hydrolyzing ATP to ADP +
Pi with kcat = 5 × 10-3 s-1 and Km = 5.5 × 10-6 M. In addition, the enzyme exhibits GTPase activity
(kcat = 9 × 10-3 s-1 and Km= 45 × 10-6 M). aaTHEP1 is inhibited competitively by CTP, UTP, dATP,
dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. As shown by gel filtration, aaTHEP1 in its purified state appears as a
monomer. The enzyme is resistant to limited proteolysis suggesting that it consists of a single
domain. Although THEP1s are annotated as "predicted nucleotide kinases" we could not confirm
such an activity experimentally.
Conclusion: Since aaTHEP1 is the first member of COG1618 that is characterized biochemically
and functional information about one member of a COG may be transferred to the entire COG,
we conclude that COG1618 proteins are a family of thermophilic NTPases.

Background
The comparison of protein coding sequences from complete genomes led to a classification, based on sequence
similarities, that assigns proteins to clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) [1,2]. Phylogenetic patterns search
[3] is a tool to retrieve COGs that contain protein
sequences that match a certain predefined pattern of
organisms. Recently, Forterre [4] used this tool to identify
reverse gyrase as the only hyperthermophile-specific pro-

tein. Another survey identified 30 COGs enriched in
hyperthermophilic procaryotes [5]. In contrast, we here
extended a similar search with respect to a group consisting of both thermophiles and hyperthermophiles i. e. the
currently 3 organisms with optimal growth temperatures
between 55 and 80°C were included. This search retrieved
COG1618 as one of the high ranking clusters containing
a protein from every of the 13 thermophilic and, by
including only one representative, the fewest sequences

from mesophilic genomes of the current COG database.
Thus, amongst others, the COG1618 proteins belong to a
group of thermophile-specific proteins (THEPs) and in
this report we designate them as THEP1s.
Orthologs typically have the same function, allowing the
transfer of functional information from one member of a
COG to the entire COG. To the best of our knowledge, no
function could be established for any of the THEP1s thus
far. On the other hand, Cort et al. predicted THEP1s being
ATPases [6]. This paper confirms their hypothesis experimentally by characterizing the gene product of aq_1292
from Aquifex aeolicus (aaTHEP1) as a first example representative for this protein family. Aquifex aeolicus is a hyperthermophilic bacterium growing optimally at 95°C [7].

Results
Identification of COG1618
Among the 4,873 COGs of the current COG database,
phylogenetic patterns search revealed 167 COGs that
include a sequence from each of the 13 thermophilic
genomes (thermophiles and hyperthermophiles). A further analysis showed that 63 COGs contain a sequence
from every genome, indicating that those conserved proteins are probably essential for microbial life. Consequently, the remaining 104 COGs are more or less
thermophile-specific proteins. To retrieve absolute thermophile-specific COGs the search parameters were chosen in the way that the output COGs must contain a
sequence from every thermophilic and must not contain
any sequence from a mesophilic genome. Whereas no
COG exactly met this search condition, less thermophilespecific COGs with only one or a few exceptions from the
exact search condition were detected (table 1). Among
those, COG1618 is the only one that contains a sequence

from each thermophilic and only one further sequence
from a mesophilic genome (MA3402).
Sequence analysis of THEP1s
CLUSTALW analysis of all THEP1s led to the design of
suitable experiments to assay catalytic in vitro function of
aaTHEP1. All proteins contain both the Walker A
(GxxxxGK [ST]) and Walker B motif (4 × hydrophobic
[DE]xxG) indicating that aaTHEP1 is a P-loop NTPase
(figure 1). Since the distal [NT]KxD motif responsible for
guanine specificity [8] is absent, aaTHEP1 probably do
not belong to the GTPase superclass of the P-loop
NTPases. Cort et al. stated that THEP1s "probably represent a novel family of ATPases in both sequence and structural terms" [6]. The authors determined the structure of
MTH538 from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum by
NMR and based on extensive sequence and structure comparisons proposed that the relationship between MTH583
and THEP1s might be similar to that between CheY and
ATPase/phosphatase members of the HAD family as suggested by Ridder and Dijkstra [9].
Purification of recombinant aaTHEP1
The bulk of E. coli proteins could be removed by heating
the crude cell extract for 10 min at 75°C. As expected from
the sequence-based theoretical pI of 9.88, aaTHEP1 binds
to the matrix of a cation exchanger. Ion exchange followed
by hydrophobic interaction chromatography finally
resulted in a homogenous aaTHEP1 preparation that
migrates slightly higher than the calculated molecular
weight of 20,555 Da (figure 2).
Functional activity of aaTHEP1
As shown in figure 3, purified aaTHEP1 clearly catalyzes
the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. As can be seen, the
longer the reaction mixture was incubated the more 32Pi

Steady-state kinetics
aaTHEP1 catalyzes both ATP and GTP hydrolysis. Measuring the turnover rates at different substrate concentrations
under steady-state conditions resulted in hyperbolic
curves if presented in a double linear plot i. e. no cooperativity could be observed (figure 7). For that reason,
steady-state kinetics could be further analyzed by fitting
the data points to curves obeying the Michaelis-Menten
equation retrieving kcat- and Km-values for each substrate.
Compared to the hydrolysis of ATP, the maximum turnover rate kcat for GTP is faster by a factor of 2. On the other
hand, the enzyme's substrate affinity to ATP as represented by Km exceeds that to GTP by one order of magnitude. The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme is defined as
kcat/Km. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of ATP hydrolysis as
catalyzed by aaTHEP1 significantly exceeds that of GTP
hydrolysis. The specific activities for ATP and GTP hydrolysis corresponding to the kcat-values given in figure 7 are
14.6 and 26.3 nmol min-1 mg-1, respectively.

was released from [γ-32P]ATP. Since THEP1s are annotated
as "predicted nucleotide kinases", we assayed aaTHEP1
for nucleoside diphosphate kinase and nucleoside monophosphate kinase activities. Using ATP as the phosphate
donor and GDP (figure 4), GMP, AMP, and UMP (figure
5) as acceptors we could not detect the predicted phosphoryl transfer.
Temperature dependence
To show that aaTHEP1 is a thermophilic enzyme, thermal
activity was determined by measuring ATP hydrolysis as
catalyzed by the purified enzyme at different
temperatures. Since spontaneous ATP hydrolysis also
occurs at higher temperatures, those rates were measured
and shown as well. As can be seen in figure 6, aaTHEP1 is
still active at 90°C. As an optimum temperature with
respect to the signal to noise ratio, 70°C was chosen for all
further kinetic measurements.

Inhibition of ATP-hydrolysis by other nucleotides
Competition experiments demonstrated that all nucleosidetriphosphates inhibit aaTHEP1 in hydrolyzing ATP. The
data points fit to a model for competitive inhibition. As an
example, inhibition by GTP is shown in figure 8. With the
exception of GTP and dGTP, the Ki-values of all nucleotides are approximately in a similar range as the Km for
ATP (table 3). Whereas GDP also inhibits ATP-hydrolysis,
GMP, AMP, and UMP show no inhibition (figures 4 and
5).
Possible homologous non-covalent interactions
Gel filtration on Superose 6 prep grade was performed
under native conditions to detect possible aaTHEP1 oligomers. We observed a single peak at Kav = 4.24 corresponding to a relative molecular weight of 17,700
indicating that purified aaTHEP1 exists as a highly compact folded monomer (figure 9). In addition, several
attempts to crosslink aaTHEP1 by glutaraldehyde resulted
in a non-crosslinked protein whereas under the same
experimental conditions β-tryptophan synthase resulted
in a crosslinked dimer (data not shown).
Domain structure
A possible multidomain structure of aaTHEP1 was probed
by limited proteolysis. As a control, the β-subunit of E. coli
tryptophan synthase as a typical protein composed of distinct domains connected by a hinge region [10] was also
proteolyzed. In contrast to β-tryptophan synthase,
aaTHEP1 is resistant to proteolytic cleavage by both
trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C (figure 10). Compared
to published experiments on the proteolytic cleavage of βtryptophan synthase [10,11], the experimental conditions
were chosen in a way that fragmented β-tryptophan synthase (~30 and ~10 kDa fragments) already were further

degraded. Even under these conditions, aaTHEP1 remains
stable although it contains 36 (20 × K + 16 × R) possible
trypsin and 17 (17 × E) possible endoproteinase Glu-C
cleavage sites as predicted from the sequence.
Secondary structure analysis
To determine the overall content of secondary structure
elements of purified aaTHEP1, far UV circular dichroism
spectroscopy was performed. A typical spectrum is given
in figure 11. Analysis of the CD spectrum using the Jasco
Spectrum Analyzer software revealed an alpha helix content of 34.3 % and 33.6 % beta-sheets.

Discussion
Our approach is based on the assumption that proteins
abundant in thermophilic and rare in mesophilic
genomes are the most attractive targets for further
biochemical investigations to understand the physiology
specific for thermophiles in more detail. Consequently,
our first goal was to identify such candidates via bioinformatic methods and as the most suitable protein THEP1
was selected for this study. The high ranking thermophilespecificity of THEP1 among procaryotes may be explained
by an essential physiological role in thermophiles that is

of no functional relevance for almost all mesophilic
microorganisms. As an alternative explanation, a function
also present in mesophilic organisms could be carried out
by a protein that was not able to adapt to higher temperatures and in the course of convergent evolution, THEP1
could have taken over this particular function. Methanosarcina acetivorans str. C2A is the only mesophilic organism
containing THEP1 (MA3402). Since the genome of M. acetivorans reveals extensive metabolic and physiological
diversity and there are thermophilic Methanosarcinae
[12], one may take into consideration the possibility that
M. acetivorans facultatively could be thermophilic. In
addition to phylogenetic patterns search we also performed BLAST with the aaTHEP1 sequence. However,
although no significant homologies to further sequences
from mesophilic unicellular organisms could be detected,
we discovered homologies to 6 multicellular eucaryotes.
Consequently, THEP1s could belong to a class of proteins
that are conserved in Archeae and Eukarya (with losses)
and have been passed to thermophilic bacteria by lateral
gene transfer.

consuming cellular function. Alternatively, aaTHEP1
could catalyze an NTP driven thermodynamically unfavourable anabolic reaction of a yet undiscovered cosubstrate or play a role in cellular regulation.

As expected, the observed turnover rates are too low to
represent a physiological in vivo situation where the free
energy of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to energy consuming
tasks. In vitro, similar turnover rates of purified NTPase are
published in the literature: 1.1 × 10-2 sec-1 for PilT from A.
aeolicus [13], 1.2 × 10-2 sec-1 for TadA for Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans [14], 3 × 10-3 sec-1 for TrwD from
Escherichia coli [15], and 6.9 × 10-4 sec-1 for PilQ from
Escherichia coli [16]. In vivo, additional proteins might be
needed to activate aaTHEP1 by protein-protein interactions and take up the free energy released by NTP-hydrolysis e. g. for motion, active transport or another energy

ATP-hydrolysis could be inhibited by all other 7 nucleosidetriphosphates under investigation in a competitive
manner which may be interpreted that in addition to GTP
the other nucleotides are also substrates for isolated
aaTHEP1. Possibly the enzyme lost a certain in vivo substrate specificity upon isolation. Since GDP inhibits ATPhydrolysis whereas GMP, AMP and UMP do not, we propose that aaTHEP1 recognizes the β- and γ-phosphates
rather than the nucleoside moieties.
A low activity of a recombinant protein may also be
explained by trace amounts of E. coli enzymes still present

after purification. For the measured NTPase activity of
aaTHEP1 we exclude this possibility because we do not
expect an E. coli enzyme exhibiting the same temperature
dependence as shown in figure 6. There are even more
indications that aaTHEP1 is a thermostable protein. The
elution during gel filtration at a position corresponding to
a lower relative molecular weight than the calculated
20,555 Da for a monomer and the resistance to limited
proteolysis suggest that aaTHEP1 is a highly compact
folded one-domain protein, a well known feature for thermophilic proteins. No cooperative behaviour in the
kinetic experiments is also expected for a monomeric
enzyme.
Although this study clearly defines a biochemical in vitro
activity of aaTHEP1, there are many possible in vivo functions and bioinformatic analysis allows to make some
predictions. Based on the genomic context, gene functions
can be predicted by searching for the conservation of

operons and gene orders because genes found in gene
strings, particularly in multiple genomes, can be legitimately assumed to be functionally linked [17]. For
THEP1, we indeed detected 4 genomes where the THEP1gene immediately is followed on the same strand by a
COG1867 protein (N2, N2-dimethylguanosine tRNA
methyltransferase). Furthermore, COG1867 also belongs
to the group of THEPs indicating a functional link (table
1).

Conclusions
This study experimentally confirms the hypothesis of Cort
et al. who suggested THEP1s being a novel family of
ATPases in both sequence and structural terms [6]. On the
other hand, we refute the theoretical prediction that
THEP1s are nucleotide kinases. In addition to the
experimental work, a list of further THEPs as potential targets to study microbial thermophily is provided (tables 1
and 2).

aaTHEP1 is a thermophilic enzyme. Temperature
dependence of aaTHEP1 catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Measurements were performed at 5 µM ATP in buffer A. ATPhydrolysis was measured in the presence of aaTHEP1
(squares) and spontaneous ATP-degradation was determined
in the absence of aaTHEP1 (triangles). 0.5 µg of purified
aaTHEP1 was used for each assay in 25 µl buffer.

Methods
Cloning, expression and purification of aaTHEP1 from A.
aeolicus
Genomic DNA from A. aeolicus was kindly provided by
Dr. R. Huber, Regensburg, Germany. aq_1292 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5'-CACCATGAAAATCATCATAACCGGTGA-3'
and
5'TTACCGCTCAAGAAGTGAGAGAAT-3'. The PCR fragment was inserted into the pre-linearized plasmid
pET101/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). For propagation and
maintenance, the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) was
used. The correct sequence of the insert as well as its
orientation were verified by sequence analysis using the
reverse T7-primer 5'-TAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGTGG-3'.

To express aq_1292, E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) was used.
According to the instructions of the manufacturer, freshly
transformed cells were grown by transferring the entire
transformation mixture to 10 ml Luria-Bertani broth (LB)
medium containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin and 1% glucose. After growing for 4 h at 37°C, the preculture was
added to 40 ml of fresh medium, grown for additional 16
h and then 30 ml were used to inoculate a 2 l main culture. At A600 = 0.7, protein expression was induced by 1
mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Roth).

mean ± SD of 4, each data point for GTP-hydrolysis the
mean ± SD of 3 independent measurements. Since the signal
to noise ratio of the activity measurement dramatically
increases at higher substrate concentrations, 128 µM was the
highest concentration under investigation. 0.5 µg of purified
aaTHEP1 was used for each assay in 25 µl buffer.

Cells were harvested at A600 = 1.3, yielding approximately
4 g after centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet
was stored at -20°C before use.
Buffer A for protein purification was 50 mM Tris/HCl, 25
mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT),
0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.0.
To disrupt the cell walls, 20 ml of buffer A containing 10
instead of 50 mM Tris, 5 mM sodium deoxycholate,
40,000 U/ml lysozyme, and 50 µg/ml DNaseI were added
to 1 g of thawed cells. Lysis was performed by stirring the
suspension at 20°C for 1 h and the cell debris were
removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. To
precipitate the bulk of E. coli proteins, the supernatant was
heated to 75°C for 10 min and immediately chilled on
ice. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation at
20,000 × g and 4°C for 30 min. To remove nucleic acids
and further purify recombinant aaTHEP1, the supernatant
was loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 1 ml HiTrap™ SP HP

equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with
buffer A containing 150 mM KCl and aaTHEP1 was eluted
at 500 mM KCl. To the collected peak a 4-fold volume of

buffer A containing 2.438 M (NH4)2SO4 (62.5 % saturation) instead of KCl was added. After centrifugation at
20,000 × g for 30 min, the resulting protein solution was
applied to a 1 ml HiTrap™ (low sub) Phenyl Sepharose™

% (NH4)2SO4 saturation. Finally, (NH4)2SO4 was
removed from aaTHEP1 by using a NAP™ 5 column
(Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated in buffer A. The
purified protein could be stored in buffer A for several
weeks at -20°C without significant loss in activity. Protein
concentrations were determined by densitometry [18] of
SDS-Gels [19] using the Sigma bovine serum albumin
protein micro standard. Gels were analyzed via an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-700) and the Molecular
Analyst software.
Steady state kinetics
To measure ATP or GTP hydrolysis, the release of [γ-32P]
from [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP was determined. Assays
were performed using purified aaTHEP1 in 25 µl buffer A.
Aliquots of the reaction mixture were stopped after different times of incubation by adding 25 µl of 40 % formic
acid and the mixture was separated by thin layer
chromatography on PEI-cellulose in 0.5 M potassium
phosphate pH 3.9. Quantification was performed by scanning exposed and developed Hyperfilm™ – βmax films

average of end point measurements divided by time of at
least three different times of incubation under steady-state
conditions. Blank values determined in the absence of
aaTHEP1 were subtracted from each data point. Unless
stated otherwise, the experiments were performed at 70°C

run at 0.2 ml/min in buffer A containing 150 mM KCl.
Approximately 80 µg of aaTHEP1 or marker protein in 0.5
ml were applied to the column. To dissociate possible
cold-induced unspecific aggregates, aaTHEP1 was heated
for 10 min at 75°C prior to gel filtration.
Limited proteolysis
In order to probe the domain structure of aaTHEP1, limited proteolysis by trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C was
performed. The reactions were carried out in buffer A containing 4 µg/ml protease and 40 µg/ml protein substrate.
After incubation at 20°C for 1 h, samples were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE. The β-subunit of tryptophan synthase from
E. coli was prepared as described earlier [22].
Circular dichroism
Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a J810 CD spectralpolarimeter (Jasco) at 30°C. 2.5 µg of
purified aaTHEP1 was measured in 200 µl of buffer A in
an 1 mm quartz cuvette. Helix- and beta-sheet contents
