Abstract
Background: The mosquito Anopheles irenicus, a member of the Anopheles punctulatus group, is
geographically restricted to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. It shows remarkable
morphological similarities to one of its sibling species, An. farauti sensu stricto (An. farauti s.s.), but is
dissimilar in host and habitat preferences. To infer the genetic variations between these two
species, we have analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) and nuclear ribosomal
internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences from Guadalcanal and from one of its nearest
neighbours, Malaita, in the Solomon Islands.
Results: An. farauti s.s. was collected mostly from brackish water and by the human bait method
on both islands, whereas An. irenicus was only collected from fresh water bodies on Guadalcanal
Island. An. irenicus is distributed evenly with An. farauti s.s. (ΦSC = 0.033, 0.38%) and its range
overlaps in three of the seven sampling sites. However, there is a significant population genetic
structure between the species (ΦCT = 0.863, P < 0.01; ΦST = 0.865, P < 0.01 and FST = 0.878, P <
0.01). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that An. irenicus is a monophyletic species, not a hybrid, and is
closely related to the An. farauti s.s. on Guadalcanal. The time estimator suggests that An. irenicus
diverged from the ancestral An. farauti s.s. on Guadalcanal within 29,000 years before present (BP).
An. farauti s.s. expanded much earlier on Malaita (texp = 24,600 BP) than the populations on
Guadalcanal (texp = 16,800 BP for An. farauti s.s. and 14,000 BP for An. irenicus).
Conclusion: These findings suggest that An. irenicus and An. farauti s.s. are monophyletic sister
species living in sympatry, and their populations on Guadalcanal have recently expanded.
Consequently, the findings further suggest that An. irenicus diverged from the ancestral An. farauti
s.s. on Guadalcanal.

Background
Extensive sampling and genetic studies have suggested
that an endemic mosquito named Anopheles irenicus
resides exclusively in the northern part of Guadalcanal
Island (one of the Solomon Islands), along with An.
farauti sensu stricto (An. farauti s.s.), An. hinesorum, An.
punctulatus and An. koliensis [1,2]. All these mosquitoes are
members of the An. punctulatus group, which was originally considered to comprise four closely related species,
An. farauti Laveran, An. punctulatus Donitz, An. koliensis
Owen and An. clowi Rozeboom & Knight ([3] and references therein). Further studies with cross-mating experiments, allozyme analysis and DNA probes finally revealed
12 sibling species within this An. punctulatus group: An.
farauti s.s. Laveran (formerly An. farauti No. 1), An. hinesorum Schmidt (formerly An. farauti No. 2), An. torresiensis
Schmidt (formerly An. farauti No. 3), An. farauti Nos. 4, 5,
6, An. irenicus Schmidt (formerly An. farauti No. 7), An.
punctulatus Donitz, An. sp. near punctulatus, An. koliensis
Owen, An. rennellensis Taylor & Maffi and An. clowi Rozeboom & Knight [3,4]. Nevertheless, the origin and population structure of the group remain obscure because of
the involvement of these complex cryptic species [2,5].
A few striking differences between the endemic An. irenicus mosquito on Guadalcanal and one of its sibling species, An. farauti s.s., provide an excellent opportunity for
investigating their genetic relationship. As mentioned earlier, An. irenicus is only found on Guadalcanal [1,2,4], but
An. farauti s.s. is distributed from the east through New
Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon
Islands to Vanuatu and southward into northern Australia
[5,6]. Although these two species generally breed in similar types of water bodies such as small ground pools, margins of creeks, streams and even road ruts [1], they do not
readily share their breeding sites. An. farauti s.s. almost
always breeds in brackish water, whereas even though An.
irenicus shows potential tolerance of brackish water, it is
always found in breeding sites containing fresh water [7].
The adult mosquitoes also have distinct patterns of host
dependence: An. farauti s.s. is anthropophilic but An. irenicus is zoophilic [1] and never bites humans [2]. Little is
known about the reproduction of adult An. irenicus. In
natural conditions adult An. farauti s.s. require a blood
meal and oviposition usually occurs 48 to 52 hours later
(Suguri et al., to be published elsewhere). Larval development in the laboratory is similarly irregular for both species, and delayed hatching of some eggs is common,
resulting in the simultaneous occurrence of second instar
larvae and pupae in the same rearing bowls (personal
observation, [8]).
An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus are morphologically nearly
indistinguishable (like members of the An. gambiae com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/318

plex [9]), but Schmidt et al. [4] described some subtle
though definitive differences in morphological characters
including the number of proepisternal setae in adults (An.
farauti s.s. = 4 or more, An. irenicus = 3 or fewer), the
number of branches of seta 5-V and seta 5-VI in pupae
(An. farauti s.s. = 17 or fewer, An. irenicus = 18 or more),
and the number of branches of seta 2-III in fourth instar
larvae (An. farauti s.s. = 9 or fewer, An. irenicus = 10 or
more). Schmidt et al. [4] therefore differentiated them taxonomically. However, some morphological variations
were noted in the An. farauti s.s. collected from Australia,
Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands [4]. Therefore, molecular analysis is necessary to identify and study
them. Allozyme electrophoresis and mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) sequences reveal distinguishable differences
[2,5]. Moreover, Beebe et al. [1] showed species-specific
ribosomal DNA polymorphisms by polymerase chain
reaction-repeated fragment length analysis (PCR-RFLP) of
ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (rITS) regions.
There have been previous studies of the distribution, habitat and morphology of An. irenicus in relation to An.
farauti s.s., but less attention has been paid to their genetic
variations on a finer scale. Therefore, we aimed to assess
this issue using both mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase
subunit II; COII) and nuclear (ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2; ITS2) markers. Mitochondrial DNA shows
ample signatures of genomic events such as gene flow,
migration, bottlenecks, speciation, hybridization and
reinforcement [10-16], so it might give better information
for studying current as well as historical genetic events
affecting these mosquitoes [5,16]. On the other hand,
comparison of the ITS region has clarified phylogenetic
relationships among many closely-related species and in
the An. punctulatus group [1], and will potentially make a
substantial contribution to inferring the evolutionary relationships of An. irenicus.
Our previous work has added some insight about the phylogeography of An. farauti s.s. in Melanesia [17]. We have
added further data from wider sampling areas of this species along with the endemic An. irenicus to shed light on
genetic relationships between the species. In this study,
therefore, we assessed the genetic variations between the
species and particularly asked the following questions: (i)
Is An. irenicus largely or completely sympatric with An.
farauti s.s. on Guadalcanal? (ii) Are they monophyletic sister groups? (iii) Is there any demographic differences
between them?

Results
Study samples
Adult mosquitoes were collected from Tamboko 2 and
Tavavao on Guadalcanal (Fig. 1 and details in [additional

51). We never collected An. irenicus on human baits. A
total of 84 larvae were collected from 24 water bodies
from five sites on Guadalcanal: Tamboko 2, Komimbo,
Sopapera, Koli and Patima; and from two sites on Malaita:
Fiu and Mawa (Fig. 1 and details in [additional files 1 and
2]). An. irenicus (n = 43) were only found in fresh water on
Guadalcanal. The other 41 larvae were An. farauti s.s. and
were mostly (n = 29, 70.7%) obtained from brackish
water on Guadalcanal and Malaita. Only 12 An. farauti s.s.
shared five out of the 20 water bodies with An. irenicus on
Guadalcanal, and all five sites were fresh water bodies.
Variability in sequences
The 684 bp COII gene was sequenced in all 92 An. farauti
s.s. and 43 An. irenicus mosquitoes collected from the
Solomon Islands. From these sequences, 26 Solomon
Island-specific An. farauti s.s. haplotypes (S1 – S26, [addi-

tional file 2]) and 13 An. irenicus haplotypes (I1 – I13,
[additional file 2]) were isolated (accession numbers in
[additional file 1]), but no haplotypes were shared
between the two species. Notably, the 12 An. farauti s.s.
larvae collected from fresh water showed identical haplotypes (S1 and S2) to those collected from brackish water
and by human bait. Among the 26 unique An. farauti s.s.
haplotypes there were 22 variable sites (eight were parsimony-informative). Within the group, the range of uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence was 0% – 0.9%. An.
irenicus exhibited less genetic variability than An. farauti
s.s.: among 13 unique haplotypes, 12 variable sites with
three parsimony-informative sites were found and the
uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence ranged from
0% to 0.06%. The highest levels of haplotype diversity
(0.82 ± 0.10) and nucleotide diversity (0.003 ± 0.002)
were found in the Malaita population of An. farauti s.s. An.

farauti s.s. on Guadalcanal showed only a 1.13-fold greater
haplotype diversity (0.75 ± 0.04) than An. irenicus (0.66 ±
0.08), and the nucleotide diversity was the same (0.002 ±
0.001).

the shape of the mismatch distribution curve, particularly
the slope of the leading face, can be influenced by sudden
population expansion from equilibrium as well as by
population bottlenecks, simulations have shown that stable populations almost never produce this type of shape
[19]. Indeed, the estimates of time τ and the current and
historical population parameters θ imply a historical episode of expansion of all three populations (τ > 0 and θ1 >
θ0; Table 2). The probable times of initiation of population expansion (texp) were about 24,600 BP (95% CI:
8,600 BP – 38,000 BP) on Malaita and about 16,800 BP
(95% CI: 12,000 BP – 22,000 BP) on Guadalcanal for An.
farauti s.s., and about 14,000 BP (95% CI: 4,700 BP –
27,000 BP) for An. irenicus (Table 2). Nevertheless, a similar type of mismatch distribution can occur when an initial population is restricted to a very small area and
subsequently expands over time and space. The resulting
population becomes genetically subdivided as individuals
tend to mate only with geographic neighbours [20]. In the
later part of this section we show that the extensive gene
flow within islands was completely contrary to the population substructure and particularly the spatial expansion
model of mismatch distribution.

For ITS2 markers, 19 randomly-chosen An. farauti s.s. and
seven An. irenicus samples were sequenced. All An. farauti
s.s. and all An. irenicus sequences were identical, resulting
in a single haplotype for each species (S1 and I1 for An.
farauti s.s. and An. irenicus, respectively; accession numbers in [additional file 1]). A combined alignment of the
two haplotypes consists of 563 bp, of which there are substitutions at eight sites and indels at 15 sites.
Demographic analysis and divergence time
Significantly negative Tajima's D values were found only
for the COII gene in the An. farauti s.s. (D = -1.94, P <
0.05) and An. irenicus (D = -1.69, P < 0.05) populations of
Guadalcanal, suggesting a departure from neutral equilibrium (Table 1). These values were also interpreted in
terms of demographic events and this revealed an excess
of rare variants within these two populations. Strong evidence for rapid expansion of all three populations was
provided by the significantly negative Fu's Fs values (Fs =
-22.06, P < 0.001 and Fs = -3.81, P < 0.05 for An. farauti
s.s. of Guadalcanal and Malaita, respectively; and Fs = 8.92, P < 0.001 for An. irenicus) (Table 1).

Evidence for population expansion was also inferred from
the high g values assessed from LAMARC (Table 1). Therefore, we estimated the present-day effective female population sizes (Nf) from the maximum likelihood estimates
of the current effective values of θ (θf). The current effective female population sizes of An. farauti s.s. (1.8 × 106)
and An. irenicus (1.4 × 106) on Guadalcanal were almost
twice that of An. farauti s.s. on Malaita (0.9 × 106).

Both tests for validity (sum of square deviations, SSD, and
raggedness index, RI) suggested that the mismatch distribution curves fitted significantly to the distribution under
a model of population expansion (Table 2, see [additional
file 3] for figures); however, there were clear differences in
curve shape. The curve for An. farauti s.s. on Malaita was
comparatively flat with a plateau, suggesting slower
growth over a potentially longer time. In contrast, An.
farauti s.s. on Guadalcanal showed a unimodal curve with
a steeper leading face. This shape suggested a recent rapid
population expansion after a bottleneck or after a founder
effect from a small founder population. Interestingly, the
An. irenicus population showed a unique L-shaped mismatch distribution, indicating recent demographic expansion with low molecular diversity (e.g. [11,18]). Although

The estimated time of divergence between An. irenicus and
An. farauti s.s. produced by MDIV (Tdiv = 1.28) was 32,800
BP. Regarding the TMRCA, we anticipated that all the haplotypes sampled coalesced 2.15 units ago, corresponding
to 55,000 BP. However, the divergence time was not estimated from ITS2 because this marker system can be influenced by homogenization among different loci within
multigene DNA families (i.e. concerted evolution [21]).

Phylogenetic analysis
We aligned all 26 An. farauti s.s. and 13 An. irenicus haplotypes obtained in this study along with 37 sequences from
32 commonly-occurring members of the genus Anopheles
in this geographical region and two outgroups (Bironella
hollandi and Drosophila melanogaster) for mitochondrial
COII. The final alignment thus consisted of 687 bp. The
phylogenetic trees constructed by the MP and Bayesian
methods using these sequences were very similar in topology. Therefore, only a consensus MP tree topology is
shown in Figure 2. Here, An. farauti s.s. haplotypes were
found to be geographically highly structured and composed of two separate subgroups. In one subgroup, the
two haplotypes of Papua New Guinea were grouped with
the single haplotype of Vanuatu; in the other, all An.
farauti s.s. haplotypes of the Solomon Islands were clustered together. An. irenicus formed a monophyletic clade
and grouped with the An. farauti s.s. subgroup of the Solomon Islands with strong support (posterior probability =
0.93).

It was not possible to include all species from the COII for
the ITS2 because their representative sequences were not
available in GenBank. Moreover, some sequences from
different taxa were too divergent with respect to the An.
punctulatus group to be aligned unambiguously. So the
ITS2 dataset was finally constructed with 24 additional
sequences (obtained from GenBank, [additional file 1])
representing the An. punctulatus group, rendering An.
koliensis the only outgroup. The alignment of ITS2
sequences consisted of 760 bp. Trees based on MP and
Bayesian approaches showed very similar topologies. The
only exception was the position of An. torresiensis. In the
topology obtained with the Bayesian approach, An. torresiensis appears to be a sister of a clade containing An.
farauti s.s., An. irenicus, An. hinesorum, An. farauti 5 and An.
farauti 6 (figure not shown), while in the MP trees it forms
a tritomy involving the outgroup (An. koliensis) and a
clade containing the remaining species (Figure 3). However, the relationship between An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus was the same irrespective of the approach used. The
trees for ITS2 were less robust than the COII tree in taxon
richness but more informative about the extensive variation among geographical sampling sites for An. farauti s.s.,

and they resolved the relationships of this species more
precisely. Unlike the COII phylogeny, the trees based on
ITS2 sequences were inconsistent with paraphyly of An.
farauti s.s. In ITS2 trees, An. farauti s.s. formed a monophyletic group comprising three monophyletic subgroups, each with high support (90% and 0.87 for
bootstrap and posterior probability, respectively). The
first An. farauti s.s. subgroup was composed of a single
haplotype from the Solomon Islands. The second was
composed of one northern Australian haplotype and the
Vanuatu haplotype. The last major subgroup was composed of the remaining haplotypes found in Australia and
all the haplotypes found in Papua New Guinea. An. irenicus, on the other hand, was well defined and formed a
monophyletic clade. An. irenicus along with An. farauti s.s.
formed a sister group to An. hinesorum, An. farauti 5 and
An. farauti 6.
The phylogenetic relationships among some members of
the An. punctulatus group within the Australasian region
were not well resolved and showed many genetically distinct lineages restricted within different geographical
ranges. A detailed discussion of this Punctulatus group will
be published elsewhere.
Population genetic structure and gene flow
Genetic differentiation between all pairs of geographical
samples was estimated at each sampling site. Neither the
An. farauti s.s. nor the An. irenicus population showed significant pairwise estimates of differentiation (FST) within
any of the islands (Table 3). As anticipated, however, the
level of differentiation within An. farauti s.s. between the
two islands was relatively high because of the sea barrier.
In particular, Tamboko 1 (G1), Tamboko 2 (G2) and
Tavavao (G3) on Guadalcanal were significantly different
from Fiu (M1) and Mawa (M2) on Malaita. The corresponding gene migration (Nm) values revealed restricted
gene flow between most of the sites on these two islands
(Table 3). Only Sopapera (G5) showed extensive gene
flow with the Malaita populations (M1 and M2). Differentiation between An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus was also
significant and gave better contrast when the samples
were grouped together by island. Significant differences
were found between the two An. farauti s.s. populations

on Guadalcanal and Malaita (FST = 0.132, P < 0.01; see
[additional file 4]), and in accordance with expectation,
both An. farauti s.s. populations differed significantly
from the An. irenicus population (FST = 0.885, P < 0.01;
and 0.878, P < 0.01 from Guadalcanal and Malaita,
respectively). Genetically, the An. irenicus population was
also isolated from both An. farauti s.s. populations; interspecific gene migration is strongly restricted (Nm = 0.065
and 0.069 for Guadalcanal and Malaita, respectively).

on Guadalcanal. On the other hand, An. farauti s.s. was
isolated from six sites on Guadalcanal (Tamboko 1, Tamboko 2, Tavavao, Komimbo, Koli and Sopapera). However, despite the failure to collect An. farauti s.s. from
Patima and An. irenicus from Tamboko 1, Tavavao and
Koli, which might indicate an error in sampling site
choice, they apparently cover most of the north of Guadalcanal (Fig. 1) and thus these two species are distributed
in complete sympatry within the island.

Our AMOVA findings were also consistent with the pairwise FST values for the combined data [additional file 5].
The An. farauti s.s. populations on Guadalcanal and
Malaita and the An. irenicus population differed significantly from each other (ΦCT = 0.863) and were responsible for 86.26% of the genetic variance. Haplotypes within
these three populations related to the total samples were
also significantly different (ΦST = 0.865) and explained
most of the remaining (13.55%) differences. However,
variation among geographical ranges within each of the
three populations was almost negligible (ΦSC = 0.014)
and could not explain any of the variation adequately
(0.20%). Subsequently, AMOVA for Guadalcanal also
showed significant population structure between An.
farauti s.s. and An. irenicus (ΦCT = 0.886, 88.57% and ΦST
= 0.889, 11.06%) and almost no variation among geographical ranges within these two species (ΦSC = 0.033,
0.38%) [additional file 5].

The sympatric distribution of An. farauti s.s. with An. irenicus on Guadalcanal is also apparent from the non-significant pairwise population differences (FST) in the COII
sequences of their respective clusters, which simultaneously excludes geographical structure in either An. farauti
s.s. or An. irenicus. Gene flow and the corresponding
migration rate within the Guadalcanal populations of An.
farauti s.s. were extremely high. Although Patima was
excluded because of the small sample size, a similar pattern – absence of gene flow barrier with moderate to high
migration rate – was also apparent in the An. irenicus populations. The AMOVA further detected the homogenous
distribution of the two species, with only 0.38% molecular variance between the localities sampled on Guadalcanal [additional file 5]. Similarly, the wide distribution of
the single ITS2 haplotype for both An. farauti s.s. and An.
irenicus also implied the absence of a gene flow barrier
within the Guadalcanal populations.

Discussion

Notably, populations of An. farauti s.s. were highly differentiated at the COII locus between Guadalcanal and
Malaita; however, the Sopapera population on Guadalcanal was not significantly differentiated from populations
on Malaita (Table 3). It is possible that gene flow between
populations on the two islands occurs across the sea gap,
with Sopapera representing the nearest population receiving immigrants from Malaita. AMOVA showed that An.

Sympatric distribution
Sometimes, sampling from insufficient geographical sites
can lead to an erroneous inference of sympatric distributions of species that are actually more widely distributed
and are sympatric only over a small part of their distribution ([22] but see also [10]). We collected An. irenicus
from four of the seven sites at which it is known to occur

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:318

irenicus and An. farauti s.s. on these two islands were significantly different among groups (ΦCT = 0.863, 86.26%)
as well as among populations within a group (ΦST = 0.865,
13.55%), and revealed that gene flow between the islands
was restricted ([additional file 5], also in [17]). Moreover,
it is obvious that the sea gap must have prevented the dispersal of An. irenicus from Guadalcanal to Malaita (see
also [23-26]). Rather, the simplest explanation of the
apparent inter-island gene flow is that the haplotypes isolated from the two Sopapera samples were both S1, which
is the commonest haplotype within this region. Therefore,
the presence of a single shared haplotype (S1) has nullified the genetic differentiation and no difference between
the populations is apparent [additional file 2], whereas
both the Guadalcanal and Malaita populations are genetically isolated per se [17].
Sister taxa
The assumption of sister taxa is essentially based on two
attributes: it must reflect true phylogenetic status and not
the genetic similarity between more distant species that
can result from hybridization [16]. Phylogeny using mitochondrial COII data showed that An. farauti s.s. of the
Solomon Islands exhibits significant differentiation from
all An. farauti s.s. in other geographical regions and forms
a monophyletic assemblage with An. irenicus. Our previous study showed that the genetically divergent Solomon
Islands subgroup of An. farauti s.s. arose because of
repeated bottlenecks and lineage sorting for adaptation
during the dispersion from Papua New Guinea [17].
Therefore, the topology reveals that An. irenicus and An.
farauti s.s. truly share a common ancestry.

The sub-structuring in the phylogeny of An. farauti s.s.
implied by mtDNA is well resolved in nuclear rDNA ITS2
trees, and reveals that An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus are
sister taxa. However, the haplotypes of An. farauti s.s. collapsed into a tritomy: the Solomon Islands subgroup, the
Australia-Vanuatu subgroup and the Australia-Papua New
Guinea subgroup. Because of the presence of this tritomy
within different geographical locations, the position of
the Solomon Islands haplotype in relation to other haplotypes could not be detected. However, a plausibly close
relationship between An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus on the
Solomon Islands can be inferred as implied by the COII
analysis, which may indicate genealogical congruence and
thus can be interpreted in terms of a common origin for
both species.
Regarding the second attribute (hybridization) for assuming sister taxa, a small amount of introgression or hybridization can homogenize mtDNA and make species appear
closely related [16]. The Solomon Islands are situated
between Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu (Fig. 1), so the
An. farauti s.s. of either Papua New Guinea or Vanuatu

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/318

may have originated allopatrically, made secondary contact with the Solomon Islands population and generated
a hybrid species (i.e. An. irenicus). According to this
hybridization hypothesis, there will be no prezygotic isolation between An. farauti s.s. clades [16], so putative
hybrids could be formed and viable hybrid populations
would be genetically very similar to the parental An.
farauti s.s. However, in this study no An. irenicus was
retained with the An. farauti s.s. of Papua New Guinea or
Vanuatu (FST = 0.918 and 0.902 with Papua New Guinea
and Vanuatu, respectively; Table 4). Therefore, the monophyly shown by the phylogenetic trees suggests that An.
irenicus is truly a near-sister species of An. farauti s.s. and
not a putative hybrid [2,4] that diverged from the ancestral An. farauti s.s. on Guadalcanal.
Divergence and expansion
Population history revealed that An. farauti s.s. dispersed
from Papua New Guinea to the Solomon Islands concomitantly with human settlement during the recent Pleistocene (c. 29,000 BP; [17,27]). Therefore, acknowledging
the uncertainties in predicting divergence time [28], we
propose that it is unlikely that An. irenicus diverged from
An. farauti s.s. prior to 29,000 BP (corresponding to
348,000 generations, assuming 12 generations per year
[17]). Indeed, this time is sufficient to develop the genetic
variation required to evolve a new species under the influence of selection, because this process includes an unstable intermediate stage that must be traversed rapidly
[11,16,29,30]. It is beyond the scope of the current study
to determine the mode of speciation of An. irenicus; further work is needed to resolve the issue.

A demographic expansion of the mosquito population is
expected at approximately the same time as the host
(human) population expansion [13]. For An. farauti s.s.
on Malaita, demographic analyses indicate the population expansion occurred around 24,600 BP (Table 2) and
this is somewhat after the first human settlement in the
Solomon Islands (c. 29,000 BP; [27,31]). In contrast, a
delayed but time-synchronized single expansion was
observed for both species on Guadalcanal (16,800 BP and
14,000 BP for An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus, respectively).
The delay in population expansion on Guadalcanal might
have resulted from a substantially low human (host) population on Guadalcanal. Consistent with these assumptions, anthropological history suggests that only Malaita
had sizeable human populations. The other islands
including Guadalcanal were inhabited by very few
humans [23], and after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
human expansion occurred in the region around 3,500 to
8,000 BP [31]. Although the human (host) population
size can potentially explain the population expansion of
An. farauti s.s. on both islands, the population expansion
of An irenicus cannot be unambiguously explained as no

census is available for its host (i.e. birds or animals), and
it requires further assessment. Nevertheless, from the
maximum likelihood estimates of θf, (Table 1) the effective population sizes, Nf, of An. irenicus and An. farauti s.s.
on Guadalcanal were also twice as large as that of An.
farauti s.s. on Malaita. In this context, we estimate the
timeframe defining the initiation of divergence of An.
irenicus from An. farauti s.s. (c. 29,000 BP) to its final
expansion (texp = 14,000 BP) to occur during the LGM.
During the LGM the sea level fell to its minimum level,
which made breeding in brackish coastal regions much
more difficult. It can be anticipated that unavailability of
favourable breeding sites may have driven some of the
ancestors to adapt to an alternative niche (i.e. large fresh
water bodies), readily available only on Guadalcanal [23].
During the non-arid deglaciation following the LGM (c.
17,000 BP [32]) both the sea level and the fresh water content gradually started to rise, favouring both the species
that continued to oviposit on brackish water and those
that started to oviposit on fresh water, and a post-LGM
population expansion occurred on Guadalcanal (texp =
16,800 BP and 14,000 BP for An. farauti s.s. and A. irenicus,
respectively). Considering all the aforementioned scenarios, it is not unreasonable to propose that a greater variety
of new hosts and exposure to novel breeding sites may
explain this larger value, notwithstanding similar growth
rates (Table 1).

Conclusion
These findings suggest that An. irenicus and An. farauti s.s.
are monophyletic sister species living in sympatry, and
their populations on Guadalcanal have recently
expanded. Consequently, the findings further indicate
that An. irenicus diverged from the ancestral An. farauti s.s.
However, knowledge of the number of genes involved in
oviposition site and host choice, mating behaviour and
the anthropogenic history of this region, as well as a more
comprehensive approach using additional genetic markers such as microsatellites and amplified fragment length
polymorphism together with wider geographical sampling, are necessary to ascertain the origin of An. irenicus
on this particular island (e.g. [10,11,30,33,34]).

Methods
Sampling
We collected mosquitoes from Guadalcanal and from one
of its nearest neighbours among the Solomon Islands,
Malaita (Figure 1, details in [additional files 1 and 2]).
Mosquitoes from Malaita were sampled to achieve confidence in sister lineage assessment (e.g. [10,11,22]); to
date, no evidence of occurrence of An. irenicus has been
found on Malaita ([2], personal observation). Per annum
rainfalls in Guadalcanal and Malaita are about 2000 mm
and 3000 mm, respectively. During June to September the
climate is comparatively dry in Guadalcanal (c. 92 mm

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/318

per month), but in Malaita the rainfall is rarely below c.
190 mm per month. Both adults and larvae of An. farauti
s.s. as well as An. irenicus larvae were caught abundantly
during the wet season. The number of An. irenicus larvae
declined more than those of An. farauti s.s. during the dry
seasons. This was due to the drying up of fresh water habitats, whereas the brackish seawater pools remained
almost unchanged, though breeding sites were occasionally washed out after heavy rainfall in both the wet and
dry seasons. Therefore, mosquitoes were first collected
during the wet season (January to February of 2005) and
subsequently during the drier seasons (July to September
of 2005 to 2007) when the condition of the breeding sites
remained stable. A total of 20 water bodies from five sites
on Guadalcanal, Tamboko 2 (G2), Komimbo (G4), Sopapera (G5), Koli (G6) and Patima (G7), and four from two
sites on Malaita, Fiu (M1) and Mawa (M2) are described
here. To avoid sampling bias, only third and fourth instar
larvae were collected from at least two (maximum eight)
water bodies at each site using the standard larval dipper
method [35]. Each water body was scooped by five collectors at different spots for about 5 minutes, less if larval
densities were high. These sampling sites included fresh
water bodies such as streams, ponds, ground pools and
swamps, and brackish water bodies such as edges of creeks
and water flooding the beach. Sampling was from multiple sites because siblings can result at any one breeding
site owing to the oviposition of a single female. For the
same reason, sites situated at a minimum distance of 300
meters were selected for sampling. Adult mosquitoes were
collected by the human bait method [12] from Tamboko
1 and Tavavao (sites marked G1 and G3, respectively in
Figure 1). Field materials were first screened morphologically as An. farauti s.l. [4,23,36]. They were then sealed in
individual gelatin capsules, given unique identification
numbers and preserved with desiccant at room temperature [12].
Amplification and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA
Minikit (Qiagen, K.K. Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions. Mitochondrial COII was amplified
with the An. punctulatus sibling species-specific primers
COII A [5] and COII H (5' -CCAATTAATAGGGGCTATTTGTGGG-3') in an ASTEC PC-320 thermocycler (ASTECHuman Science, Japan). This sequence includes ATG for
initiation and excludes a T-tRNA for termination [5]. A
fragment of the nuclear ribosomal ITS2 region was amplified using the primers ITS2A and ITS2B described by
Beebe & Saul [37]. In both cases the PCR products were
purified on a 5% acrylamaide gel [38] and cyclesequenced in both directions with corresponding PCR
primers using a big dye terminator sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems). Sequences were run on an ABI
prism™ 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For-

ward and reverse strands were assembled for each individual sample in the SEQMANII version 3.6.0 (DNASTAR,
Inc.) sequence editor program and a single sequence was
defined.
Variability in sequences
All sequences were aligned using MEGA version 3.1 [39].
No length differences were found in the COII alignment.
The amino acid sequences were then inferred using the
Drosophila mtDNA genetic code in DNASP version 4.10
[40] to check for the presence of ambiguous stop codons.
For comparison, we randomly chose 19 An. farauti s.s. and
seven An. irenicus samples identified from COII sequencing. These samples were analyzed for ITS2 and included in
the study. The position and length of the ITS2 sequence
were also determined by comparison with published
DNA sequences from GenBank.

Basic sequence statistics and various population parameters were computed using DNASP and MEGA. Genetic
diversity at the intra-population level was measured in
terms of haplotype diversity (Hd, [41]) and nucleotide
diversity (π, [41]). Haplotypes were identified and their
relative frequencies within populations were calculated
using ARLEQUIN version 3.1 [42]. For some tests we
pooled each species according to geographical origin to
obtain better-compiled values. Some data were reproduced with permission.
Demographic analysis and divergence time
Selective neutrality was assessed by Tajima's D [43] and
Fu's FS [44] tests. Estimators related to population expansion, τ (age of expansion), θ0 and θ1 (θ before and after
expansion, respectively), were computed with 95% CI in
ARLEQUIN. The time of the main expansion (texp) was
estimated from the equation τ = 2ûtexp (û is the substitution rate of the entire sequence estimated from û = mTμ;
here, mT is the number of nucleotides in the sequence
under study and μ = 0.057 substitutions per site per million years [45,46]).

The observed number of differences between pairs of haplotypes was plotted to obtain a mismatch distribution. A
population that has passed through a recent demographic
expansion shows a unimodal distribution, whereas a population at equilibrium gives a multimodal distribution
[19,47]. The validity of the estimated expansion model is
tested by the distribution of the sum of square deviations
(SSD) between observed and expected values obtained by
the parametric bootstrap approach [48]. A significant SSD
value is taken as evidence for departure from the estimated demographic model, which can be a model of
either population expansion (if τ > 0 and θ1 > θ0) or a stationary population (if τ = 0 and θ1 = θ0). In addition, we
computed the raggedness index (RI) of the observed dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/318

tribution [49]. This index takes larger values for the multimodal distributions typical of a stationary population
than for the unimodal and smoother distributions typical
of expanding populations. Significance is then tested by
the parametric bootstrap approach mentioned earlier.
We used LAMARC version 2.0.2 [50] to estimate the current demographic status of An. farauti s.s. and An. irenicus
populations. The model and parameters of substitution
were obtained from MODELTEST (described in next section). LAMARC uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling and takes both historical and asymmetric gene
flow into account. Our estimates included the current
effective population size Nf (from θf = 2Nfμ) and growth
rate (g) under the exponential growth model. The parameters θf and μ represent the current estimates of θ and the
neutral mutation rate per site per generation, respectively.
This program was run for 10 initial chains of 10,000 steps
and two final chains of 200,000 steps. To improve accuracy, we used four steps at different temperatures; one
cold and three hot searches.
We used the program MDIV ([51], http://cbsuapps.tc.cor
nell.edu/mdiv.aspx) to determine divergence time (Tdiv =
t1u) and the expected time of the most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA = t2u) for all sequences in the samples by
the MCMC method within a likelihood framework using
the finite site model (Hasegawa, Kishino, Yano [HKY],
[52]). Here u is the mutation rate per sequence per year,
and t1 and t2 are, respectively, the population divergence
time in years before the present (BP) and the gene coalescence time in years before the present (BP). Five runs were
performed with 5,000,000 cycles each for the MCMC and
a burn-in time of 10%. The value with the highest posterior probability was accepted as the best estimate.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses of the COII and ITS2 sequences
were conducted separately. Maximum parsimony (MP)
and Bayesian trees were constructed for the COII region.
For the COII tree, an additional 37 sequences from 32 taxa
from commonly-occurring members of the genus Anopheles in the Australasian and Indo-Malayan regions were
included (almost all are identified in [5]; [additional file
1]). We rooted the trees with Bironella hollandi and Drosophila melanogaster. Sequences were aligned using the
ClustalW option of MEGA, under default parameters, and
obvious alignment errors were edited by eye. The general
time-reversible model with a proportion of invariable
sites and a rate variation among sites following a gamma
distribution (GTR+I+G; [53,54]) was selected as the bestfit model of nucleotide substitutions for the COII dataset
to use in the Bayesian analysis from MODELTEST version
3.7 [55]. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated
using a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo

(MCMC) sampling approach in MRBAYES [56,57]. Four
simultaneous chains were run for 5,000,000 generations
in two independent runs with trees sampled every 100
generations. After this number of generations, the standard deviation of split frequencies dropped almost to zero
(< 0.0001) indicating that the run had become stationary
and a sufficient sample from the posterior probability distribution had been obtained. After a burn-in of the first
25% of trees, a consensus tree was constructed from the
remaining 75,002 trees with > 50% posterior probability.
The MP trees were constructed using a heuristic search
(1000 random addition searches) and tree-bisectionreconstruction (TBR) branch swapping, saving 100 trees
per replicate in PAUP* 4.0b10 [58]. All trees were summarized into a strict consensus tree. One thousand bootstrap
replicates were generated with the heuristic search option
with 10 random additional searches per replicate. For
both phylogenetic analyses, indels in alignments were
considered as missing data.
It was not possible to include all species from COII for
ITS2, because not all representative sequences were available in GenBank. Also, some sequences of distant taxa
were too divergent from the An. punctulatus group to be
aligned unambiguously. However, representative
sequences from different parts of Australia, Papua New
Guinea and Vanuatu for An. farauti s.s. and two different
sequences for An. irenicus were available in GenBank. So
the ITS2 dataset was finally constructed with 24 additional sequences (obtained from GenBank [additional file
1]) representing the An. punctulatus group, rendering An.
koliensis the only outgroup. MP and Bayesian analyses
were performed for ITS2 sequences to reconstruct phylogenetic trees using the same methodology as implemented for COII analysis. The Hasegawa, Kishino, Yano
85 [52] with rate variation among sites following a
gamma distribution (HKY85 + G) was found to be the
best-fit model for the ITS2 data and was selected for phylogenetic analyses. Again indels in alignments were considered as missing data. These trees were outgrouped with
An. koliensis [5,7].
Population genetic structure and gene flow
The extent of short-term genetic distance and the level of
gene flow between groups were estimated by pairwise FST
values [59] and tested for significance by 110 permutations. The levels of gene flow (Nm) were estimated as an
absolute number of migrants exchanged between the two
populations from these FST values [60]. In addition, divergence within population groups was estimated by an
approach based on Nei & Li [61]. Also, the population
genetic structure was calculated by analyzing molecular
variance (AMOVA, [62]) in ARLEQUIN. AMOVA takes
into account the number of molecular differences
between haplotypes. Statistical significance was tested by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/318

a non-parametric permutation approach [62]. AMOVA
estimates genetic variations as genetic differentiation
among groups (ΦCT), among populations within groups
