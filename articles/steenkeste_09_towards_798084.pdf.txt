Abstract
Background: Several strategies are currently deployed in many countries in the tropics to
strengthen malaria control toward malaria elimination. To measure the impact of any intervention,
there is a need to detect malaria properly. Mostly, decisions still rely on microscopy diagnosis. But
sensitive diagnosis tools enabling to deal with a large number of samples are needed. The molecular
detection approach offers a much higher sensitivity, and the flexibility to be automated and
upgraded.
Methods: Two new molecular methods were developed: dot18S, a Plasmodium-specific nested
PCR based on the 18S rRNA gene followed by dot-blot detection of species by using species-specific
probes and CYTB, a Plasmodium-specific nested PCR based on cytochrome b gene followed by
species detection using SNP analysis. The results were compared to those obtained with
microscopic examination and the "standard" 18S rRNA gene based nested PCR using species specific
primers. 337 samples were diagnosed.
Results: Compared to the microscopy the three molecular methods were more sensitive, greatly
increasing the estimated prevalence of Plasmodium infection, including P. malariae and P. ovale. A high
rate of mixed infections was uncovered with about one third of the villagers infected with more
than one malaria parasite species. Dot18S and CYTB sensitivity outranged the "standard" nested
PCR method, CYTB being the most sensitive. As a consequence, compared to the "standard"
nested PCR method for the detection of Plasmodium spp., the sensitivity of dot18S and CYTB was
respectively 95.3% and 97.3%. Consistent detection of Plasmodium spp. by the three molecular
methods was obtained for 83% of tested isolates. Contradictory results were mostly related to

detection of Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale in mixed infections, due to an "all-or-none"
detection effect at low-level parasitaemia.
Conclusion: A large reservoir of asymptomatic infections was uncovered using the molecular
methods. Dot18S and CYTB, the new methods reported herein are highly sensitive, allow parasite
DNA extraction as well as genus- and species-specific diagnosis of several hundreds of samples, and
are amenable to high-throughput scaling up for larger sample sizes. Such methods provide novel
information on malaria prevalence and epidemiology and are suited for active malaria detection.
The usefulness of such sensitive malaria diagnosis tools, especially in low endemic areas where
eradication plans are now on-going, is discussed in this paper.

Background
The first methods for molecular detection of Plasmodium
falciparum malaria were published in the 1980s [1-3].
Since then, much progress has been made in DNA extraction, and detection protocols have been simplified. The
four human species can be specifically identified, and the
more recently developed real-time amplification techniques allow rapid processing of samples and quantification of parasite loads [4-7]. Molecular assessment of point
prevalence at the village level has also become feasible.
Various field surveys have shown that molecular methods
detected up to eight times more Plasmodium spp. infections
than microscopy, and that mixed infections could represent up to one third of them [8-11]. Molecular detection
tools modify the interpretation of malaria epidemiology,
by revealing large reservoirs of asymptomatic infections
[8,12,13], cryptic species potentially influencing transmission patterns and clinical outcomes [14,15], as well as
shifts in age distribution of Plasmodium spp. infections
[16]. The main drawback of molecular detection tools is
their cost and workload. Furthermore none of the published methods is adapted to large-scale analysis of thousands of samples. Therefore, most decisions for malaria
control programmes still rely on data collected by health
services, where malaria is diagnosed using microscopy.
With recent moves towards malaria elimination in a
number of countries [17,18], additional methods for
detecting infections and infectious reservoirs are needed.
Indeed, large-scale studies will be required, including in
areas with difficult access to health centers. Such studies
require high sensitivity in order to detect asymptomatic
carriage and improved species identification in order to
adapt treatment. Such needs are best fulfilled by molecular methods, which furthermore would open the possibility to monitor vector control measures. The aim of this
study was to improve molecular detection of the four Plasmodium species. To this end, new molecular detection
approaches were developed targeting the nuclear 18S
rRNA gene (18S rDNA), and the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene, enabling mass screening of field
samples for epidemiological studies. Both loci were chosen because of their obligate presence, their good intra-

species conservation associated with appropriate interspecies variation. The methods were validated using laboratory isolates and used to explore point prevalence in
field samples collected during a cross-sectional prevalence
survey in three villages in Rattanakiri Province, Cambodia
[19]. Results were compared with standard detection
methods: microscopy and a published nested PCR
method [6], in order to evaluate their performance in
terms of sensitivity, specificity and suitability for epidemiological studies.

Methods
Study sites
The three study villages are located in the north-eastern
province of Rattanakiri in Cambodia. Rattanakiri is a hilly
and forested province, which borders Laos and Vietnam.
It is considered one of the most malaria endemic areas in
the country. The principal vectors are Anopheles dirus,
Anopheles maculatus and Anopheles minimus [20,21]. In
2001, the reported incidence of malaria cases based on
laboratory microscopy diagnosis was 21 per 1,000 inhabitants, of which 79.6% and 20.4% were due to Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections, respectively
[22].

In September 2001, a baseline cross-sectional prevalence
survey conducted by the European Commission-Cambodia Malaria Control Programme (ECMCP) team [19]
included 36 "high-risk" villages (less than 1 km from the
forest), which had never been included in any bed net distribution project. Subjects were chosen by random selection of households. Fingerprick blood was collected, and
thin/thick blood smears, as well as double blood-spots
(approximately 20 μL of blood on Whatman 3 M filter
paper) were prepared. The blood spots were stored at 20°C until analysis. The study reported here concerned
three villages: the village of Ping was chosen because it
had shown the highest malaria prevalence by microscopy
diagnosis. The villages Pahoy and Smach were randomly
selected from the list of the 36 ECMCP villages.

Ethical approval
The study was approved by the National Ethics Committee of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and all participants gave
informed consent.
Microscopy
Thin smears were fixed in methanol. Both thin and thick
smears were stained with 3% Giemsa for 30 minutes at
room temperature. Examination was performed by experienced microscopists at the National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control in Phnom Penh. At
least 100 thick film fields with 1,000× magnification were
examined before a slide was considered negative. Malaria
case definition was based on the presence or absence of
Plasmodium parasites on microscopy slides. Parasite species and stages were confirmed on the thin film. No second reading was possible.
Samples for sensitivity and specificity studies
For evaluation of DNA extraction methods, cultured P. falciparum 3D7 parasites at 1% parasitaemia were serially
diluted ten-fold using uninfected blood. Aliquots of 20 μl
were spotted on Whatman 3 M filter paper, air-dried and
stored at -20°C.

For evaluation of the sensitivity of the molecular detection
methods, a 200 μl red blood cell pellet of a 7.5% P. falciparum 3D7 culture was extracted by the QIAamp DNA
blood kit (QIAGEN, Germany). DNA eluted with 200 μl
of water was stored at -20°C until analysis. For sensitivity
studies, the DNA was serially diluted ten-fold and used for
PCR amplification.
The specificity of the molecular diagnosis methods has
been assessed with reference DNA of the four species
infecting human. DNA from P. falciparum was extracted
from a continuous culture of the 3D7 strain, using the
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany). DNA
from the P. vivax Belem strain was kindly provided by
Peter David (Institut Pasteur de Paris, France). Plasmodium
malariae and Plasmodium ovale DNA as well as control
human DNA from a non-infected person were kindly provided by Georges Snounou (Muséum d'Histoire
Naturelle, Paris, France). DNA from patients with P.
malariae and P. ovale single infections, were kindly provided by Eric Legrand (Institut Pasteur de Cayenne,
French Guiana). Species identification and single infection were confirmed by cox1 and cytochrome b genes [23]
sequencing and by the "standard" PCR (see below).
DNA extraction
The blood spots collected in Ping village were processed
by 96 well plate extraction method using the QIAamp
DNA blood 96 kit (QIAGEN, Germany) as described previously [24]. Cut-out blood-spots were transferred in 96

well plates adapted for 1 mL volumes, incubated for 90
minutes at 4°C in 1 mL buffer HBS (HEPES 10 mM, NaCl
140 mM, KCl 10 mM) with 0.5% v/v saponin (SIGMA
Aldrich, Germany), then washed twice with 1 mL HBS
using a vacuum pump and a manifold. Subsequently, the
recommendations of the kit supplier were followed.
Briefly, filter papers were treated for 10 minutes with 180
μL buffer ATL at 85°C, then digested with 4 μl of proteinase K at 100 mg/mL for 1 hour at 56°C. After addition of
200 μL buffer AL and incubation for 10 more minutes, filter papers were spun down; the supernatant was recovered
and mixed with 200 μL 100% ethanol (SIGMA Aldrich,
Germany) at room temperature. The mixture was filtered
through QIAamp DNA blood columns using a vacuum
pump, then washed once with 500 μL buffer AW1 and
twice with 500 μL buffer AW2. DNA was eluted with 100
μL buffer AE and stored at -20°C.
DNA from the blood spots of the Pahoy and Smach villages was extracted with the Instagene resin (BIORAD,
USA) and a 96 well plate in-house protocol adapted from
the suppliers recommendations. First, the above described
red blood cell lysis in HBS/saponin and the wash steps in
HBS were performed. Then, 200 μL preheated Instagene
resin was added to the filter papers, the mixture incubated
for 30 minutes at 56°C, briefly vortexed, and incubated at
90°C for another 30 minutes. After centrifugation at a
minimal speed of 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes, the supernatant was recovered and stored at -20°C.
18S rDNA: species-specific nested PCR, "standard PCR"
(Std)
The nested PCR method based on the 18S rRNA gene
marker [7] adapted for epidemiological studies [6] was
considered as reference. After a Plasmodium spp. specific
nested PCR with the primer pairs rPLU1/5 and rPLU3/4,
the primary PCR product of Plasmodium positive samples
was separately amplified with the four species-specific
primer pairs rFAL1/2, rVIV1/2, rMAL1/2, rOVA1/2 to
identify the species. The published protocol was strictly
followed, by using 4 μL of DNA and 2 μL of primary PCR
product for the primary and secondary PCR reactions,
respectively. Detection was done by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
18S rDNA: Genus-specific nested PCR and speciesspecific dot blot detection (dot18S)
Selection of primers and probes for this new detection
approach was based on alignment of 18S rDNA sequences
of human and primate Plasmodium species (Table 1), with
primers and genus-specific probes being chosen in zones
of maximal sequence similarity of all Plasmodium species,
but not with the 18S rDNA of other Apicomplexa and
human. The V7 variable zone was targeted because of its
short length, significant differences between species, but

good similarity of stage-specific copies within each species. The choice of the species-specific probes was based
on the intention to detect all stage-specific sequences of
the same species. For each primer and probe, two to four
different designs were experimentally evaluated, using the
above-mentioned reference DNA samples, before making
a final choice for highest possible sensitivity and specificity.
The primary PCR was performed in a 20 μL volume with
3 μL DNA, 0.4 μM of Ps and PPas primers (Table 1), 0.2
mM dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Solis Biodyne, Estonia), using the following cycling
program: 4 minutes at 95°C, then 30 cycles of 30 seconds
at 95°C, 90 seconds at 51°C, 2 minutes at 64°C, and final
extension for 15 minutes at 64°C. One μL of primary PCR
product was used for nested PCR under the same conditions, using the primers Ns1 and Nas new (Table 1),
except for the annealing (60°C) and extension (66°C)
temperatures, and the number of cycles (25).
The colorimetric Dot-blot detection was designed for a 96
well plate format, using the Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus (BIORAD, USA). The protocol was adapted from the
suppliers recommendations. Briefly, 10 μL of nested PCR
product were denatured 15 minutes at 40°C in 0.2 M
NaOH, then transferred to the Bio-Dot apparatus
mounted with a TE (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 8.0)

soaked Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham, UK). After
successive filtration of the PCR product and 500 μL 0.2 M
NaOH using a vacuum pump, the membrane was rinsed
in SSC 2× (SSC 20×: NaCl 3 M, Na citrate 0.3 M, pH 7.0),
air-dried and exposed for 5 minutes to UV light for DNA
crosslinking. The subsequent steps were performed in
sealable hybridization bags (Roche Diagnostics, France)
and a waterbath. After 2 hours pre-hybridization at 40°C
in Denhardt's hybridization buffer (SSC 5×, 0.1% Ficoll,
0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumine, 0.5% SDS), 10 pmol/mL of digoxigenine-labeled
probe (PROLIGO, France) was added and incubation continued overnight or 3 hours minimum (probes sequences:
Table 1).
Wash steps were as follows : two times 5 minutes in SSC
2×, SDS 0.1% at room temperature, 15 minutes in SSC 1×,
SDS 0.1% at 40°C, and two times 10 minutes in SSC 0.1×,
SDS 0.1% at 40°C. For the revelation, the membrane was
incubated for 5 minutes in "Washing buffer" and for 1
hour in "Blocking Solution" (DIG Wash and Block buffer
set, Roche Diagnostics, France) at room temperature, then
30 minutes in "Blocking Solution" with 1,000× diluted
anti-digoxigenine antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics, France), then 15 minutes in
"Washing Solution" and 3 minutes in "Detection buffer".
Colorimetric revelation was achieved with 50× diluted
NBT/BCIP in "Detection buffer" (NBT/BCIP stock solu-

tion, Roche Diagnostics, France). After having obtained a
satisfying signal intensity, reaction was stopped by rinsing
in TE buffer, and the membrane was scanned in a GS 800
densitometer (BIORAD, USA).
Sequences of Plasmodium genus-specific primers for
nested PCR amplification and probes for Dot-blot colorimetric detection on membranes were selected after alignment of the following 18S rDNA sequences: P. falciparum:
M19172, M19173; P. vivax: U07367, U93234, AF145335,
U07368, U93095; P. malariae: M54897; P. ovale: L48986,
AJ001527; Plasmodium simium: U69605; Plasmodium fragile: M61722; Plasmodium knowlesi: U83876; Plasmodium
cynomolgi: L08241; Plasmodium reichenowi: Z25819; Plasmodium inui: U72541; Plasmodium brasilianum: AF130735;
Toxoplasma gondii: L37415; human: X03205.
Cytochrome b: genus-specific nested PCR and SNP
identification (CYTB)
Two primer sets were designed for nested PCR amplification of a large portion of the cytochrome b gene, with specificity to all human and primate Plasmodium species, but
excluding other Apicomplexa or human DNA. Primers are
presented in Table 1[23,25]. One μL DNA was amplified
with 1 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP (Solis Biodyne,
Estonia), 3 mM MgCl2, and 2 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Solis Biodyne, Estonia), using the following cycling program : 5 minutes at 94°C, then 40 cycles of 30 seconds at
94°C, 90 seconds at 60°C, 90 seconds at 72°C, and final
extension 10 minutes at 72°C. For the nested-PCR, 2 μL
of primary PCR product were amplified under the same
conditions, except for the MgCl2 concentration (2.5 mM).
PCR products of 815 base pairs were detected by standard
2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide
staining. Double strand sequencing of PCR products was
performed by the Genopole laboratory of the Institute
Pasteur of Paris. Sequences were analysed with the Seqscape 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, USA) to identify
species-specific SNP combinations. An algorithm based
on 11 selected SNPs has previously been developed based
on an alignment of published cytochrome b reference
sequences of P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P.
ovale, allowing identification of each species (Figure 1), as
well as all possible combinations of mixed infections.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed by using STATA SE
8 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). Exact
McNemar test has been used to compare frequencies in
matched data of infections.

diluted blood (ranging from 1% to 10-5% parasitaemia)
were extracted in parallel using these two methods. DNA
was amplified using the standard nested PCR method targeting 18S rDNA. Both methods allowed repeated detection of 10-4 dilutions, whereas the 10-5 dilutions were only
detected in one of two experiments. This "all or none"
phenomenon at detection limit has been reported previously [6,7]. The QIAamp 96 protocol was discarded
because of sporadic foaming during the washing steps
(increasing the risk of cross-contamination of flanking
wells), the higher workload and more expensive kits,
compared to the Instagene 96 method.
Screening of field samples by microscopy and "standard"
nested PCR
A total number of 337 samples were screened in the three
villages. Microscopy diagnosis revealed a Plasmodium
prevalence of 59.8%, 39.6% and 29.1% in Ping (n = 102),
Smach (n = 101), and Pahoy (n = 134), respectively. The
infections consisted in P. falciparum (prevalence of 48.0%,
33.7 and 28.4%, respectively), P. vivax (2.0%, 1.0% and
0.7%, respectively) or a mixed infection of both P. falciparum and P. vivax (9.8%, 5.0% and 0%, respectively).

The published "standard" PCR detected significantly
(exact McNemar test, p < 0.0001) more Plasmodium spp.
infections than microscopy in all three villages (Figure 2).
Table 2 shows the comparison with microscopy for the
village Ping, which had the highest microscopy-based
malaria prevalence of all 36 initially surveyed villages
(Table 2), and for Smach and Pahoy villages (Table 2).
The data show that molecular detection multiplied the
estimated Plasmodium spp. prevalence by 1.3 in Ping, and
by 2.2 in Smach and Pahoy. P. malariae and P. ovale were
detected in the three villages with a prevalence of 15.1%
(range 12.7%–15.7%) and 6.5% (range 3.9%–7.9%),
respectively, although these species were considered rare
or non-existent in Cambodia and had not been detected
in these samples by microscopy. Moreover, the PCR
approach revealed a much higher rate of mixed infections
(39% and 31% prevalence in Ping and Smach/Pahoy,
respectively) than microscopy, with numerous triple or
quadruple infections.
A total of 12 samples were considered microscopy positive, but tested negative by "standard" nested PCR (Std).
Out of these, eight samples were subsequently found to be
Plasmodium positive by at least one of the newly developed and more sensitive molecular detection methods
(Dot18S and CYTB, see following paragraph). All four
remaining samples displayed low parasite densities by
microscopy (rating of 1+).

Comparison of DNA extraction methods

Figure 1
Species-specific combinations of SNP in the cytochrome b gene
Species-specific combinations of SNP in the cytochrome b gene. 11 SNPs were selected allowing categorical identification of the Plasmodium species. Three examples of SNP sequencing data are shown: sample #22 = mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax, sample #66 = P. falciparum, and sample #67 = P. malariae (Seqscape 2.0 software, Applied Biosystems USA).
Those SNPs were shown to be robust and never presented contradictory results. Pf/Pv/Pm/Po = P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale, respectively.

Comparison of molecular detection approaches for genus
(Plasmodium spp.) detection
The sensitivity of the three molecular detection methods
was assessed by two experiments with ten-fold serially
diluted DNA samples of known parasite content (corresponding to a parasitaemia range from 750,000 down to
0.0075 parasites per μL blood, p/μL). The "standard" PCR
detected down to 7.5 p/μL, with an "all or none" phenomenon for 0.75 p/μL. Higher sensitivity was obtained with
dot 18S and CYTB methods, which detected down to 0.75
p/μL and 0.075 p/μL, respectively.

The estimated prevalence rate of plasmodial infections
was significantly higher with CYTB than with dot 18S
(exact McNemar test, p < 0.03) and significantly higher
with the dot 18S than the "standard" nested PCR method
(p < 0.03) (Figure 2).
The sample-by-sample comparison of Plasmodium spp.
detection showed that the three molecular methods were

in agreement for 82.8% of samples, whereas the remainder was detected either by only one (6.2%) or by two
methods (11.0%, Figure 3). The dot 18S detection
approach displayed a sensitivity of 95.3% and a specificity
of 66.7%, while a higher sensitivity (97.3%) and a lower
specificity (55.7%) were obtained with the CYTB detection, compared to the "standard" method. These relatively
low specificities were due to 27 and 36 "standard" negative samples testing positive with the methods dot18S and
CYTB, respectively (Figure 3), most probably because of
their higher sensitivities previously shown with serially
diluted control samples. In other words they were indeed
due to their checking positive samples classified as negative (false negatives) by the "standard" method.
Comparison of the molecular approaches for speciesspecific detection
The three molecular methods had different sensitivities
for detecting the four Plasmodium species (Figure 4).

80.4%, CYTB 84.6%) and for P. falciparum infections (Std
63.8%, dot18S 68.3%, CYTB 71.8%) showed that dot18S
and CYTB detected significantly more Plasmodium spp
(exact McNemar test: Std/dot18S = 0.0237; Std/CYTB =
0.0000; dot18S/CYTB = 0.0243) and P. falciparum (exact
McNemar test: Std/dot18S = 0.0357; Std/CYTB = 0.0003;
dot18S/CYTB = 0.0807) infections than the "standard"
method. Significantly higher P. vivax prevalence was
detected by the dot18S method, compared to the CYTB
diagnosis (38.6% versus 30.6%, exact McNemar test:
dot18S/CYTB = 0.0009), while the "standard" method
measured a prevalence of 33.5% (exact McNemar test:
Std/dot18S = 0.0270; Std/CYTB = 0.2888). Comparable
prevalences were observed for P. malariae (Std 15.1%,
dot18S 16.6%, CYTB 14.2%; exact McNemar test: Std/

dot18S = 0.4244; Std/CYTB = 0.7493; dot18S/CYTB =
0.2153) and P. ovale (Std 6.5%, dot18S 6.2%, CYTB 5.0%;
exact McNemar test: Std/dot18S = 1.0000; Std/CYTB =
0.4244; dot18S/CYTB = 0.4807).
With the "standard" and dot18S methods, some samples
tested negative with the species-specific detection ("standard": nested PCR, dot18S: hybridization of probes) even
though they had been positive with the previous genusspecific nested PCR (Std: 12 samples, dot18S: 7 samples).
The comparison of the species identifications sample by
sample and species by species showed that agreement of
the three molecular methods was best for P. falciparum:
the three techniques consistently detected P. falciparum in
193 samples (see Additional file 1), out of 262 P. falciparum-positive samples detected by at least one of the

techniques (agreement rate of 73.7%). The agreement
rates were much lower for P. vivax (42.0%), P. malariae
(36.8%), and lowest for P. ovale (18.4%). The large majority of the samples with no agreement consisted of conflicting detection of P. malariae and P. ovale.

Discussion
The WHO gold standard method for malaria diagnosis is
microscopy. It is considered inexpensive and field
adapted, even though it is time-consuming and requires
specifically trained personnel. Molecular detection methods achieve much higher detection sensitivities [1,26],
and they are better adapted to automation of the process
and objective reading of results by machines. This potential makes them a valuable option for large-scale epidemiologic studies. Unfortunately few efforts have been spent
on developing the high-throughput approaches needed
for such studies.
The 18S rRNA gene is the most frequently cited marker for
malaria detection. It is composed of highly conserved
regions which can be targeted for a qualitative detection of
Plasmodium spp., and of variable zones allowing species
identification [4-7]. However, the 18S rRNA genes in Plas-

modium spp. also have unusual properties, such as the
existence of three stage-specific A-, S- and O-types, as well
as copy number and strain-specific sequence variations
[27-29]. Primers and probes have to be designed accordingly, since strain-specific variations can perturb the detection [30,31]. The copy number of the rRNA gene varies
from four to eight [28,29]. The design of primers and
probes for the dot18S method was based on published
sequences alignment, by targeting the Zone V7 which displays maximal inter-species sequence variation, while
allowing genus-specific identification as well as detection
of the 18S rRNA A- and S- type genes of P.falciparum and
P.vivax. 18S rRNA polymorphism could be a significant
biais for molecular when targeting this gene, anyway it is
still considered as the "gold standard" for species identification. The cytochrome b gene is highly conserved and has
mainly been used for phylogenetic studies [23,32-35].
The gene is located on the mitochondrial genome, which
occurs at an estimated number of 30–100 copies per parasite [36-38], and as a consequence is predicted to permit
more sensitive detection than the 18S rRNA gene.
Analysis of more than 300 field samples collected in Cambodia demonstrated the added value of the molecular

Agreement of Plasmodium spp. detection by the three molecular methods
Agreement of Plasmodium spp. detection by the three molecular methods. The cytochrome b-based detection
method (CYTB) showed the highest number of Plasmodium infections (285 samples), while 271 and 256 infections were
observed with the Dot-blot detection (dot18S) and the "standard" nested PCR (Std), respectively. The three methods agreed
on the detection of 239 positive and 40 negative samples (agreement rate of 82.8%). Kappa coefficient (Kappa) is calculated
between those three methods with 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI).

approach. Compared to microscopic diagnosis, an up to
two-fold higher Plasmodium prevalence was evidenced,
revealing a previously unsuspected reservoir of asymptomatic infections. Mixed infections were detected in about
one third of the villagers, a much higher figure than
reported in neighbouring countries [7,10,11]. Such information is crucial for the National Malaria Control Programme, as mixed infections could influence gametocyte
carriage and clinical outcome [14,15,39].
The performance of the two new molecular detection
approaches outranged the published "standard" nested
PCR method. The cytochrome b-based CYTB method was
the most sensitive, likely because it targets the multiple
copies of mitochondrial genome present in each parasite.
Probably for the same reason, it also detected higher rates
of Plasmodium spp. and P. falciparum infections among the
field samples. Plasmodium vivax was better identified with
the dot18S detection approach, maybe because two independent experiments with the A-type and S-type specific
probes were combined, increasing the chance of detecting
low parasite densities in P. vivax infections. The two 18S
rDNA-based methods (std and dot18S) detected some
samples by genus-specific but not by species-specific

amplification/probe hybridization. The reason for this is
uncertain but could be due to mutations in the targeted
18S rDNA sequences, or, in the case of the "standard"
method, to copy number variations of the stage-specific
gene types amplified by the "standard" method (P. falciparum: S-type, P. vivax: A-type), as previously reported
[28,30,31].
The three molecular methods agreed well on the detection
of Plasmodium spp. infections. However, the different species were not detected/identified with the same level of
agreement, with most disagreements being observed for P.
malariae and P. ovale. This is most probably due to the previously described "all-or-none" effect occurring at threshold parasite densities. Low-levels parasitaemias of P.
malariae and P. ovale are especially frequent in mixed
infections, partly because of the species characteristics,
partly because of a density-dependant regulation mechanism [40]. These species are, therefore, easily overlooked
by microscopy, when P. falciparum or P. vivax are the
major species. This also explains the largely higher
number of mixed infection detected with molecular biology tools compared to microscopic examinations.

Genus- and species-specific detection by three molecular methods
Genus- and species-specific detection by three molecular methods. Std = "standard" nested PCR, dot18S = 18S rDNA

= P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale, respectively.

The weak point of the newly developed molecular techniques remains the visual interpretation of spots with a
certain background (dot18S) and of potentially double
electrophoresis peaks (CYTB). This may be solved by
using straightforward bioinformatics software for analysis. Another weak point could be non-detection of parasites by molecular methods while detected by microscopy,
which occurred in a number of samples in this study. The
non-detection by molecular methods was most probably
due to errors of DNA extraction (false negatives) or error
on slide reading (false positives), especially for four samples, which were negative by all three molecular diagnosis
methods. Non-detection because of atypical mutations in

primer- and/or probes hybridization zones could be a
third explanation for these results.
New large-scale detection methods should obviously be
evaluated with numerous field samples from different
endemic areas of the world, to assess their robustness with
respect to possible sequence variations in wild parasites.
This is particularly important for the more variable 18S
rRNA marker as previous reports indicate that Plasmodium
parasites from South-East Asia, including North-East
Cambodia, display a particularly large heterogeneity of
18S rRNA gene sequences (S. Incardona et al, unpublished work) [24,30,31]. Furthermore, infections with low

parasite densities and mixed species, including P. malariae
and P. ovale, are common in this part of the world (S.
Incardona et al, unpublished work) [11,14]. It is therefore
important to note that this study, with its promising
results, provides a field evaluation of the new detection
methods in a relatively difficult context.
Even if the two newly developed techniques allow detection of Plasmodium genus and species at a much larger
scale than the standard molecular diagnosis methods, the
ultimate goal of this work is to develop new approaches
allowing analysis of thousands of field samples. Many
phases of the current processes are amenable to adaptation to pipetting robots, reducing contamination risks,
manipulation errors and, therefore, false positive and
false negative results. In particular, DNA extraction by
pipetting robots and detection with the real-time amplification approach help to reduce the number of manipulation steps and opening of tubes, while allowing to deal
with a higher number of samples. Feasibility studies with
reference DNA samples and the above described field
samples have shown that the dot18S detection approach,
using the same primers and probes, could be transferred
to a microarray format (S. Incardona et al, unpublished
work). Similarly, higher throughput detection of the cytochrome b PCR products by RFLP/dHPLC analysis or by
microarray has successfully been evaluated (N. Steenkeste
et al, unpublished work). These higher throughput
approaches should allow Plasmodium detection and species identification of thousands of samples in mass screening programme in less than three days of lab work (N.
Steenkeste et al, unpublished work).

Conclusion
This work is a first step on the way to developing highthroughput parasite detection approaches for large-scale
field studies. Highly sensitive detection of malaria parasites can be achieved. Sensitive molecular methods will
prove useful in studies exploring malaria epidemiology,
risk factors for symptomatic and asymptomatic infections,
interaction of species and importantly in monitoring efficacy and effectiveness of the scaling up of malaria control
efforts. Indeed, classical control measures and symptombased treatment are inefficient in controlling asymptomatic carriers [13,33,41], yet controlling asymptomatic
infections and targeting this reservoir are critical arms of
malaria elimination programmes [42].
