Abstract
Background: Bacterial penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases (PBP-βLs) constitute a large
family of serine proteases that perform essential functions in the synthesis and maintenance of
peptidoglycan. Intriguingly, genes encoding PBP-βL homologs occur in many metazoan genomes
including humans. The emerging role of LACTB, a mammalian mitochondrial PBP-βL homolog, in
metabolic signaling prompted us to investigate the evolutionary history of metazoan PBP-βL
proteins.
Results: Metazoan PBP-βL homologs including LACTB share unique structural features with
bacterial class B low molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins. The amino acid residues
necessary for enzymatic activity in bacterial PBP-βL proteins, including the catalytic serine residue,
are conserved in all metazoan homologs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that metazoan PBP-βL
homologs comprise four alloparalogus protein lineages that derive from α-proteobacteria.
Conclusion: While most components of the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery were dumped by
early eukaryotes, a few PBP-βL proteins were conserved and are found in metazoans including
humans. Metazoan PBP-βL homologs are active-site-serine enzymes that probably have distinct
functions in the metabolic circuitry. We hypothesize that PBP-βL proteins in the early eukaryotic
cell enabled the degradation of peptidoglycan from ingested bacteria, thereby maximizing the yield
of nutrients and streamlining the cell for effective phagocytotic feeding.

Background

Penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases (PBP-βLs)
are serine proteases that are distinguished by a catalytic -

SXXK-motif (X is any amino acid) [1-5]. Due to their vital
role in bacterial biology, PBP-βLs are of importance both
medically and economically. Penicillin-binding proteins

synthesize and maintain peptidoglycan, the major cell
wall component in most bacteria. Penicillin-binding proteins are inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins which prevent peptidoglycan
synthesis and therefore bacterial proliferation. As a
defense mechanism against β-lactam antibiotics, some
bacteria produce β-lactamases which hydrolyze the antibiotics into biologically inactive metabolites. Phylogenetic
analyses show that β-lactamases have evolved from penicillin-binding proteins on at least three occasions indicating a recurrent need to protect/maintain the
peptidoglycan synthesis machinery [3,6-8]. Many metazoan organisms including humans harbor proteins that
share sequence similarity to PBP-βLs [9]. The genes for
metazoan PBP-βL homologs most likely derive from bacteria and may have been acquired by either horizontal or
endosymbiotic gene transfer. However, the almost universal lack of peptidoglycan synthesis in eukaryotes raises the
questions of (i) what immediate benefit(s) PBP-βL proteins conferred to the recipient cell, and (ii) what biochemical properties the PBP-βL proteins were later
endowed with, that lead to their integration in the protein
repertoire of higher metazoan species.
Based on amino acid sequence, 3-dimensional structure,
and domain organization, bacterial PBP-βLs can be categorized into low molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins classes A to C, high molecular weight penicillinbinding proteins classes A to C, and β-lactamases classes
A, C, and D [2-5]. The structure and catalytic mechanism
of PBP-βLs have been extensively studied [1-6,10]. All
PBP-βLs share three conserved active site motifs which
contribute to the formation of the catalytic cavity [1-5].
The -SXXK-motif contains the catalytic serine residue
which undergoes acylation and deacylation cycles. The [SY]X[NT]-motif harbors side chains that point into the
active site cleft and participate in the catalytic process. The
-[KH][ST]G-motif is located in a β-sheet and participates
in substrate docking through antiparallel backbone
hydrogen bonding. The arrangement of the three active
site motifs along the amino acid sequence is distinctive for
each PBP-βL class [2-5]. The size of the PBP-βL domain
varies from about 200 amino acids in class D β-lactamases
to over 400 amino acids in class C low molecular weight
penicillin-binding proteins, indicating that the PBP-βL
domain has undergone extensive diversification through
modification of local structural elements [1-5].
LACTB is a mammalian protein comprised of a mitochondrial import sequence and a domain sharing sequence
similarity to PBP-βLs (human LACTB, [SwissProt:P83111]). This domain is 450 amino acids long and
the three PBP-βL active site motifs (-SISK-, -YST-, and HTG-) have been identified through sequence comparisons with bacterial PBP-βLs [9,11]. LACTB has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/26

detected in several mitochondrial proteome survey studies suggesting that LACTB is a ubiquitous protein in mammalian mitochondria [12-15]. LACTB is subjected to
regulation at transcriptional and posttranslational level.
In skeletal muscle, LACTB expression is rapidly increased
by insulin [16] implying a role in anabolic processes. In
liver, lysine acetylation of LACTB occurs during starvation
[17] suggesting that LACTB, like several key enzyme in
metabolism, is regulated by the highly conserved acetyltransferase/deacetylase pathway [18]. The catalytic serine
residue located in the -SISK-motif is phosphorylated
under normal conditions suggesting that LACTB is activated by a specific phosphoprotein phosphatase [19].
However, the enzymatic substrates and physiological
function of LACTB remains unknown.
Here we have investigated the evolutionary history of
LACTB and other metazoan PBP-βLs homologs, which we
herein refer to as the LACTB family. A combined phylogenetic and structural analysis demonstrated that the LACTB
family has evolved from class B low molecular weight
penicillin-binding proteins (LPBP-B). The presence of the
conserved catalytic serine residue in all LACTB family proteins suggest that they have peptidase or esterase activity.

Results and discussion
LACTB shares conserved active site signature motifs with
bacterial PBP-βL proteins
We performed extensive database searches for proteins
sharing sequence similarity with human LACTB. Metazoan proteins containing the three active site motifs SXXK-, -[SY]X[NT]-, and -[KH][ST]G-shared by all PBPβLs [1-6], were classified as LACTB family proteins (Table
1). LACTB orthologs were identified using the reciprocal
best-hit approach [20,21]. We found that all completed
vertebrate genomes harbor a LACTB ortholog. We also
identified LACTB orthologs in Ciona intestinalis, Strogylocentrotus purpuratus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis
briggsae, Schistosoma japonicum, and Dictyostelium discoideum. An amino acid alignment of the active site motifs
and their flanking regions is shown (Figure 1, panel A).
For comparison we included the corresponding amino
acid segments from the D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase [Swiss-Prot:P15555] of the actinobacterium Streptomyces sp. strain R61, which is perhaps the most extensively
studied PBP-βL family protein [22,23]. The alignment
shows that the active site motifs and the catalytic serine
residue are conserved in all taxa from bacteria to human
suggesting that LACTB is an active-site-serine enzyme. In
addition, several amino acids flanking the active site
motifs are conserved from bacteria to human further suggesting that LACTB and the bacterial PBP-βL proteins
share common features in the secondary and tertiary
structure. Metazoan LACTB orthologs harbor a 50–100
amino acid long N-terminal region with no sequence sim-

ilarity to the Streptomyces D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase or to any other bacterial PBP-βL protein. The
N-terminal region starts with a predicted mitochondrial
import sequence (Figure 1, panel A). Comparison of the
gene architecture of the metazoan LACTB orthologs (Figure 1, panel B) revealed extensive similarities of the exonintron organization supporting that these genes were vertically inherited from a common ancestor [24].
Amino acid sequence and structural features indicate that
LACTB derives from class B low molecular weight
penicillin-binding proteins
Phylogenetic and structural analyses show that the bacterial PBP-βL family is monophyletic and has diversified by
local structural changes and domain fusions [1-8]. The
bacterial PBP-βL family can be divided into seven distinct
and highly divergent classes that share little or no interclass sequence identity except for the three common catalytic site motifs [2-8]. Proteins from the different PBP-βL
classes are distinguished by the specific amino acids in the
active site motifs and the number of amino acid residues
between the three motifs [2-8]. The arrangement of the
active site motifs along the amino acid sequence for a set
of founding members of each bacterial PBP-βL class is
shown (Figure 2, Additional file 1). Comparing the
arrangement of the active site motifs and their specific
amino acids in human and C. elegans LACTB with the
founding members of each of the bacterial PBP-βL classes
revealed that LACTB is related to the LPBP-B proteins.
Sequence comparison of the PBP-βL domain of LACTB
with the LPBP-B proteins indicated a moderate degree of
sequence identity (16–27%). Conversely, there was little
or no inter-motif similarity between LACTB and the proteins belonging to the other bacterial PBP-βL classes.
Based on comparison with the founding members of the
PBP-βL classes, LACTB can thus be classified as a LPBP-B
protein. To test the global validity of this classification we
investigated if all bacterial PBP-βL proteins sharing
sequence similarity to LACTB are LBPB-B proteins.
Searches in the NCBI nr database using human LACTB as
the seed sequence yielded more than five hundred bacterial proteins. We divided these proteins into five categories based on E-value (10-5–10-10, 10-10–10-20, 10-20–10-30,
10-30–10-40, 10-40 and lower). Ten proteins randomly chosen from each category were aligned with the founding
members of the LBPB-B group. All the sampled bacterial
proteins, irrespective of E-value, had a characteristic LPBPB type motif organization, shared 25–95% sequence identity with the founding members of the LPBP-B class and
had little or no sequence similarity with other PBP-βL
classes. This result suggests that LACTB together with the
LPBP-B proteins form a distinct class sharing a common
ancestry.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/26

At present, 3-dimensional structures are available for three
LPBP-B class proteins: the Streptomyces D-alanyl-D-alanine
carboxypeptidase [22,23]; a D-alanyl-D-alanine aminopeptidase from Ochrobactrum anthropii [SwissProt:Q9ZBA9] [25]; and a transesterase from Burkholderia
gladioli [Swiss-Prot:Q9KX40] [26]. These three proteins
representing different LPBP-B subclasses share an almost
identical polypeptide fold consisting of an α/β region and
an all-helical region, with the catalytic site located
between them. Comparison of the amino acid sequences
with the 3-dimensional structures of these LPBP-B proteins revealed several conserved amino acids in structurally critical elements of the polypeptide fold (Additional
file 2). Amino acid alignments of LACTB with these LPBPB proteins showed a high degree of amino acid conservation especially of amino acids in positions corresponding
to these structural elements (Additional file 2). Evidently,
local structure imposes particularly stringent constraints
on substitutions in these positions promoting their conservation through long evolutionary distances. These findings strongly suggest that LACTB and the LPBP-B proteins
share a similar polypeptide fold.
The LACTB family comprises four paralogus lineages
Having identified a set of LACTB orthologs we sought to
determine the evolutionary relationship with other
LACTB family proteins (Table 1). Amino acid sequence
comparisons revealed that all LACTB family proteins have
a LPBP-B-like motif arrangement and, moreover, share a
17–40% inter-motif sequence identity to human LACTB
(Additional file 3). This finding suggests that the LACTB
family descended from a common bacterial ancestor protein and then diversified in various metazoan lineages.
The most extensive diversification of the LACTB family
occurred in nematodes which have eight paralogs, whilst
vertebrates harbor two paralogs. In contrast, all insects
sequenced to date appear to lack LACTB proteins. To gain
further insight into the evolutionary events shaping the
LACTB family we performed a phylogenetic analysis.

The PBP-βL domain of thirty-seven metazoan LACTB family proteins, four Dictyostelium LACTB homologs, and ten
bacterial LPBP-B proteins were aligned and analyzed by
maximum likelihood as described in Methods. The Streptomyces D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase and two
related LPBP-B proteins from Salinispora tropica and Bacillus cereus (E < 10-50 against Streptomyces) were included as
an outgroup (Table 1). The inferred best tree, shown in
Figure 3, indicated that the LACTB family is composed of
four groups. We have labeled the groups: (i) LACTB
orthologs; (ii) LACTB-like 1; (iii) LACTB-like 2; and (iv)
esterase-like proteins (Figure 3). These groups were supported by a bootstrap analysis of one hundred replicates.
That the bacterial LPBP-B proteins were intercalated with
the different LACTB groups, instead of forming a sister

group common to all LACTB groups, suggests that the
LACTB family is composed of four distinct alloparalogus
protein lineages.
The LACTB family derives from α-proteobacterial
ancestor proteins
LACTB orthologs clustered together with LPBP-B proteins
from the free-living α-proteobacteria Maricaulis maris,

Oceanicaulis alexandrii, and Sphingopyxis alaskensis. This
finding suggests that the progenitor of the LACTB
orthologs was acquired from an early α-proteobacterium.
Interestingly, the evolutionary scenario appears to be similar for the other LACTB groups. Esterase-like proteins
cluster with a putative esterase from Hyphomonas neptunium, the LACTB-like group 1 and 2 proteins cluster with
putative peptidases from Bradyrhizobium japonicum and

Mesorhizobium loti, respectively. These findings suggest
that the progenitors for the LACTB family were acquired
simultaneously from an early α-proteobacterium harboring a set of four LPBP-B genes encoding structurally
closely related proteins with different biochemical functions. That the LACTB groups cluster with proteins from
different α-proteobacterial lineages, may be explained by
lineage-specific loss of LPBP-B genes resulting from the
extensive genome reductions that has occurred throughout the evolution of α-proteobacteria [27].
While LACTB orthologs have a relatively broad taxon distribution, proteins from the other three lineages are
restricted to fewer taxa suggesting that widespread loss of
these genes have occurred throughout the eukaryotic evolution. LACTB-like proteins 1 are found only in nematodes suggesting gene loss in all other lineages. In
contrast, LACTB-like proteins 2 are abundant in Dictyostelium and comprise several vertebrate proteins, but do not
occur in nematodes. The esterase-like proteins comprise
five paralogs in nematodes and two in echinoderms, but
appears to be missing from all vertebrates sequenced to
date.

the conservation of PBP-βL homologs in some eukaryotic
lineages.
We speculate that phagocytotic feeding was the primary
selection force acting to conserve genes for LPBP-B proteins in early eukaryotes. An early eukaryote organism
possessing molecular machineries for both phagocytosis
and effective peptidoglycan digestion would harness great
benefit in an environment with numerous bacteria. It is
thus possible that this hypothetical early eukaryote was
endowed not only with the progenitors of the LACTB family proteins but was equipped with a larger complement
of PBP-βL proteins and other peptidoglycan-degrading
enzymes allowing an efficient and complete hydrolysis of
ingested peptidoglycan. Following the diversification of
eukaryotes, lineages in which phagocytotic feeding was
deselected had no need for peptidoglycan-degrading
enzymes and they were consequently lost from the
genomes. On the contrary, eukaryote lineages leading to
Dictyostelium and Caenorhabditis, which feed on bacteria,
retained the genes for peptidoglycan-digesting enzymes
and allowed them to undergo multiple duplications. This
scenario implies that LACTB family proteins may also
occur in some phagotropic protozoans.

Conclusion
The PBP-βL family encompasses a large number of highly
diversified proteins in bacteria and eukaryotes. While the
role of bacterial PBP-βL proteins in peptidoglycan synthesis has been extensively studied, little is known about the
function of metazoan PBP-βL family proteins. However,
recent findings show that the mammalian mitochondrial
PBP-βL homolog LACTB is involved in metabolic signaling [16,17,19]. Therefore, clarifying the function of metazoan PBP-βL homologs may reveal novel aspects about
the evolution of metazoan energy metabolism and elucidate unknown mechanisms of metabolic regulation.
Our phylogenetic analysis indicated that the LACTB family is divided into four lineages deriving from four separate bacterial LPBP-B subclass genes. These genes were
most likely acquired simultaneously from α-proteobacteria by endosymbiotic gene transfer, although other scenarios such as multiple horizontal gene transfers from αproteobacteria to early organisms of the opistokont lineage can not be completely ruled out. The evolutionary history of the LACTB family is dominated by gene losses
resulting in an uneven distribution of LACTB family proteins in metazoan taxa and no extant organism sequenced
to date harbor proteins from all four lineages. Extensive
diversification of LACTB family proteins appear to have
occurred only in Nematodes. Since metazoan organisms
lack peptidoglycan the widespread gene loss characterizing the history of the LACTB family may be readily
explained by lack of enzymatic substrates. However, this
raises the question as to what mechanisms have promoted

LACTB orthologs are conserved in many metazoan species
including all vertebrates currently sequenced. The energy
metabolism of vertebrates is intimately linked to the
metabolism of the large number of microbes that colonize
the intestinal channel. That changes in the relative abundance of intestinal microbes from different taxa directly
affects the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism of the host
([28] and references therein) demonstrates the existence
of complex gut-microbe-to-host signaling mechanisms
relayed by specific microbial metabolites. We hypothesize
that LACTB is involved in the metabolism and/or sensing
of some product(s) deriving from commensal bacteria.
Further metagenomic, cell biological, and biochemical
studies will be required to elucidate the function of PBPβL homologs in metazoan organisms.

Methods
Genomic DNA, expressed sequence tags, and protein
databases were searched for nucleotide and amino acid
sequences using BLAST 15/10/2006–15/01/2007. The following websites were used; Dictybase [29], DOE Joint
Genome Institute [30], J. Craig Venter Institute [31], Hinvitational database [32], Human Genome Sequencing
Center [33], LumbriBASE [34], National Center for Biotechology Information [35], Washington University School
of Medicine Genome Sequencing Center [36], Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute [37], and Wormbase [38].
Orthologs to human LACTB were identified using a modified reciprocal best-hit approach as described [20,21]. To

identify bacterial orthologs each LACTB family protein
was used to search the NCBI nr database. Retrieved bacterial proteins were evaluated with the reciprocal best-hit
test. Expectancy values (E-value) refer to searches in the
NCBI nr sequence database. Binary alignments were made
using Dotlet 1.5 [39] and LALIGN [40]. Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were made using ClustalW and adjusted manually. Amino acid alignments are
available upon request.
Phylogenetic maximum likelihood analysis of amino acid
alignments was performed in software programs RAxMLVI [41] and proml from the PHYLIP package version 3.66
[42]. The invariant sites were removed from the alignment
and the shape parameter of the Γ distribution was estimated using ProtTest [43]. Four Γ distribution classes with
the JTT model were used in both programs. Trees were initially inferred in RAxML using the normal hill-climbing
search with 100 random addition sequences. The resulting trees were further evaluated in proml, and the one giving the highest likelihood value is presented. The
robustness of inferred trees was assessed by nonparametric bootstrapping using programs seqboot, proml, and
consense from the PHYLIP package. One hundred replicates was used in the bootstrapping analysis. Like the
majority of eukaryotic operational genes with bacterial
homologs the LACTB family branched with homologs
from Gram negative bacteria while homologs from Gram
positive bacteria formed an outgroup. Therefore the Streptomyces sp. D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase [SwissProt:P15555] was used to root the inferred tree.
