Abstract
Background: CatSper1 and CatSper2 are two recently identified channel-like proteins, which
show sperm specific expression patterns. Through targeted mutagenesis in the mouse, CatSper1
has been shown to be required for fertility, sperm motility and for cAMP induced Ca2+ current in
sperm. Both channels resemble a single pore forming repeat from a four repeat voltage dependent
Ca2+ /Na+ channel. However, neither CatSper1 or CatSper2 have been shown to function as cation
channels when transfected into cells, singly or in conjunction. As the pore forming units of voltage
gated cation channels form a tetramer it has been suggested that the known CatSper proteins
require additional subunits and/or interaction partners to function.
Results: Using in silico gene identification and prediction techniques, we have identified two further
members of the CatSper family, CatSper3 and Catsper4. Each carries a single channel-forming
domain with the predicted pore-loop containing the consensus sequence T×D×W. Each of the new
CatSper genes has evidence for expression in the testis. Furthermore we identified coiled-coil
protein-protein interaction domains in the C-terminal tails of each of the CatSper channels,
implying that CatSper channels 1,2,3 and 4 may interact directly or indirectly to form a functional
tetramer.
Conclusions: The topological and sequence relationship of CatSper1 and CatSper2 to the four
repeat Ca2+ /Na+ channels suggested other members of this family may exist. We have identified a
further two novel CatSper genes, conserved in both the human and mouse genomes. Furthermore,
all four of the CatSper proteins are predicted to contain a common coiled-coil protein-protein
interaction domain in their C-terminal tail. Coupled with expression data this leads to the
hypothesis that the CatSper proteins form a functional hetero-tetrameric channel in sperm.

Background
Channel activities, particularly those of calcium channels,

have been linked to the process of sperm maturation,
motility and to the sperm egg interaction. A number of

candidate channels have been associated with these processes, these include the voltage operated Ca2+ channels
alpha1A, 1C and 1E plus beta subunits [1,2], the T-type
voltage operated Ca2+ channels alpha 1G and 1H, cyclic
nucleotide gated (CNG) channels [3] and the transient
receptor potential (TRP) channel TRP2 [4], The evidence
being primarily based on transcript and immuno-staining
studies. However, none of the channels expressed in testes
and sperm have been directly associated with sperm
mobility. Recently, two novel channel-like proteins,
CatSper1 and CatSper2 (Cation channel of Sperm), were
identified to be specifically expressed in spermatozoa and
to be linked to sperm mobility [[5,6]; reviewed in [7]].
The human and mouse CatSper channels, CatSper1 and
CatSper2, both carry a single six-transmembrane spanning unit analogous to one of the four repeats found in
voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels [5,6]. Analysis of the
pore forming region within the repeat suggested that
CatSper1 and 2 are Ca2+ selective [5,6]. Further evidence
supporting channel activity has been provided for
CatSper1 by gene-targeting experiments in the mouse [5].
Notably in sperm from the mice carrying two null alleles
for the CatSper1 gene, cAMP and cGMP induced Ca2+
influx is lost. Moreover, CatSper1 has been shown to be
required for normal sperm motility and egg penetration.
However, attempts to define channel activity for CatSper1
and CatSper2 – singly or in conjunction – in heterologous
expression systems have failed [5,6]. This suggests that
additional factor or factors are required to form a functional channel. The fact that CatSper1 and 2 share features
of a single repeat of a four repeat channel suggests that an
additional two members might exist.
Here we describe the prediction of two additional CatSper
channels in the human and mouse genomes, CatSper3
and CatSper4. Both channels contain a single six-transmembrane repeat domain, which contain the T×D×W
pore-lining consensus sequence present in CatSper1 and
CatSper2. Based on accompanying EST, cDNA library
source information and Taqman data, both genes are
expressed in testis. Furthermore, we noted that each CatSper channel is predicted to contain a coiled-coil motif, a
protein-protein interaction interface, in its intra-cellular
C-terminal tail. Based on a common expression pattern
and the fact that each CatSper protein is predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain, we hypothesise that the CatSpers come together to form functional tetrameric
channels either by direct interaction of their coiled-coil
motif or through interaction with additional factors.

sequences and calcium channel protein sequences. These
profiles were used as input to the PSI-BLAST algorithm [8]
to search large human and mouse genome based protein
databases for potential novel members of the CatSper protein family. Two GENSCAN [9] human gene predictions
partially covering the ion transport domain region were
identified. The GENEWISE program [10] was used to
improve and extend the original gene predictions into
full-length proteins using CatSper2 protein sequence as a
template. Orthologous mouse CatSper3 and mouse
CatSper4 sequences were identified by mapping syntenic
regions of CatSper3 and CatSper4 human loci to the
mouse genome. The GENEWISE program was again used
to craft the final mouse proteins from their DNA, seeded
by human CatSper3 and human CatSper4 predictions.
Overlapping EST sequences listed in Table 5 were also
used to improve predictions.
Expression Analysis
Human RNA prepared from non-diseased organs was purchased from either Ambion Europe or Clontech. cDNA
was prepared from 500 ng RNA using random hexamers
and Multiscribe (Applied Biosystems), following manufacturer's instructions.

Oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed using
Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) with a GCcontent of 40–60%, no G-nucleotide at the 5'-end of the
probe, and no more than 4 contiguous Gs. Each primer
and probe was analysed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) [8]. Results confirmed that each oligonucleotide recognises the target sequence with a
specificity >3 bp when compared to other known cDNA's
or genomic sequence represented in the NCBI publicly
available databases [11].
The sequence of the primers and probes directed against
human CatSper4 exon 9 are as follows:
Forward primer: 5'-AAGGACATCCGCCAGATGTC-3'
Reverse primer: 5'-GGCACACCTTTTCCATGCTAA-3'
Probe: 5'-CAACAGCAAGACTTGCTCAGTGCGCT-3'
Expected amplicon size is 70 bp, a test PCR reaction was
carried out under the following conditions; 40 cycles,
95°C 30 seconds, 58°C 30 seconds, 72°C 30 seconds.
Expected amplicon size was confirmed on an agarose gel.

Methods

18S rRNA pre-optimised primers and probe were purchased from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.

Identification of CatSper3 and 4
PSI-BLAST profiles were constructed from sequence alignments of the ion-transport domain of CatSper protein

25 µl PCR reactions were carried out using TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) following

manufacturer's instructions and as described in Lobenhofer et al [12].
Each sample reaction contained 100 nM Taqman probe;
300 nM forward primer; 900 nM reverse primer and 15 ng
of cDNA template. Within each experiment, a standard
curve was carried out of a typical tissue sample, from 50
ng to 0.78 ng of cDNA template. From this standard curve,
the amount of actual starting target or 18S cDNA in each
test sample was determined. The levels of target cDNA in
each sample were normalised to the level of expression of
target in a comparative sample. The levels of 18S cDNA in
each sample were normalised to the level of expression of
18S in a comparative sample. The data was then represented as fold expression of target sequence normalised to
18S expression relative to the level of expression in the
comparative sample, which was set arbitrarily to 1.
Characterisation of the CatSper channel family
CatSper3 and CatSper4 transmembrane regions were predicted using the TMHMM program [13] and delineated by
analogy with other CatSper and calcium-channel family
members. Coiled-coils were predicted using the COILS
algorithm for each member of the CatSper channel family
[14].
Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Tree
Sequence alignments of the CatSper protein family, and
calcium channels were created using CLUSTALW multiple
sequence alignment program [15] and hand-crafted using
the JALVIEW sequence alignment editor [16]. Pairwise
sequence identities presented in tables 6 and 7 were calculated using the pairwise sequence alignment algorithm
present in the JALVIEW software.

The phylogenetic tree shown in figure 8 was constructed
from sequence alignments of the CatSper protein family
with calcium channel sequences CCAA_HUMAN,
CCAH_HUMAN, CCAG_HUMAN, CCAS_HUMAN,
CCAC_HUMAN over the ion-transport domain region.
PHYLIP [16] PROT-PARS maximum parsimony programme was used to build 1000 bootstrap trees from the
sequence alignment. The final tree was obtained using the
CONSENSE programme to select the best tree by majority
rule.

Results
Identification of CatSper 3 and 4
As part of an on going program to identify novel ion channel encoding genes, ion-channel family sequence profiles
have been used to search sets of human gene predictions.
Two initial GENSCAN [9] predictions of 264 aa and 185
aa mapping to human chromosomes 5q31.1 and 1p35.3
respectively contain features related to the previously
described CatSper genes – namely a single ion-transport

http://www.RBEj.com/content/1/1/53

domain and a pore-loop containing the consensus T × D
× W. The predictions have been hand polished using a
combination of GENSCAN and GENEWISE [10] analysis,
coupled with Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data and
homology between human and mouse chromosomes to
obtain full-length gene models.
Human CatSper3 has eight coding exons, spanning a
region of 43.7 kb giving rise to an open reading frame of
398 aa (Figure 1 and Table 1). The human Catsper3 prediction is supported by 12 ESTs from mixed tissue types
include germ cell tumors and testis (Table 5). Human
Catsper3 also appears in the patent literature, Lexicon
Genetics: WO200066735 and Millenium Pharamaceuticals: WO200194412; as a novel human ion-channel
cloned from a testis library – Lexicon Genetics:
WO200066735; and as a putative sodium channel – Millenium Pharamaceuticals: WO200194412 (Table 5).
Available tissue distribution information from ESTs and
the patent literature show that human CatSper3 is predominantly a testis derived transcript although there is
also a suggestion that transcripts are found in other tissues
(Table 5).
In comparison to human CatSper3, the mouse CatSper3
gene spans a region of approximately 24 kb on mouse
chromosome 13 – however, gaps remain in the current
mouse genome assembly and therefore intron sizes can
not be determined precisely (Figure 1 and Table 2). Based
on GENEWISE comparison of the mouse genomic
sequence with the human CatSper3 ORF, the mouse
CatSper3 gene is predicted to encode an open reading
frame of 395 aa. Mouse CatSper 3 is also represented by a
RIKEN cDNA clone (AK014942) [18] from an adult
mouse testis library; however, this encodes a shorter protein of 382 aa. This is due to use of an alternative splice
acceptor site within the third exon (Msper3v1:Figure 1b
and Table 2). This shorter version is predicted to have a
truncated 2nd transmembrane helices and, therefore, is
unlikely to form a functional ion channel.
Notably, exon 1 of human CatSper3 lies within the 3'UTR
of the DCOHM gene (dimerisation cofactor of hepatocyte
nuclear factor from muscle: Genbank AF499009)[19]
such that the two genes are in a head-to-tail orientation.
The DCOHM cDNA has been isolated from muscle and
kidney libraries, whereas available tissue distribution
information for human CatSper3 points to a predominantly testis specific expression. Therefore transcriptional
interference is unlikely to occur between the two genes.
Using the human DCOHM as a query sequence, an ORF
of 90% sequence identity can also be found in the mouse
genome 8.5 kb upstream of the mouse CatSper3 start
codon. Therefore a similar gene arrangement to the
human loci exists in the mouse (data not shown).

However, we do have any information relating to the
extent of the mouse DCOHM 3'UTR as this has not yet
been cloned. Therefore, the mouse DCOHM gene may or
may not extend over the mouse CatSper3 coding exons.
The human CatSper4 gene is predicted to span a region of
12 kb and be comprised of 10 coding exons, (Figure 2a
and Table 3). Human CatSper4 is only partially represented by a single EST originating from a testis library. In
contrast mouse CatSper4 is present in the databases as a
RIKEN testis derived cDNA (AK077145) [18] and is also
represented by ten ESTs, all of which are either testis
derived or derived from a pooled library containing testis
material.
The mouse CatSper4 gene is located on mouse chromosome 4 band D3, it spans a region of 15.3 kb. Unlike the
human CatSper4 the mouse gene possesses 11 coding
exons, the gene structure varying with respect to the
human in the first two exons (Figure 2 and Table 4) otherwise exon/intron boundaries are conserved Figure 2b.
Having found two further members of the CatSper family
in human and mouse genomes a search for orthologues in
Fugu rubripes and Danio rerio was carried out. Searching
with CatSper sequences against raw genomic sequence
(TBLASTN) [8] and ENSEMBL[20] protein predictions
(BLASTP)[8] failed to identify any orthologues. Furthermore we failed to identify any channel-like sequence of
less than 400 aa containing a pore-forming region of the
consensus T×D×W. Given the current coverage of the Fugu
genome it is surprising that no CatSper-like sequences
were identified.
Tissue distribution of Human CatSper4
The previously described CatSper sequences, CatSper1
and CatSper2 are expressed in testis and more specifically
spermatocytes. Data from ESTs and patent literature suggest that CatSper3 also shares a common expression pro-

file. As there was limited evidence supporting the human
CatSper4 transcript we carried out a Taqman quantitative
PCR analysis to address expression of the Human
Catsper4 gene. A primer probe set was designed within
exon 9 of human CatSper 4 sequence and tissue expression profiling was carried out in 18 normal human tissues
as described in Materials and Methods. Figure 3a shows
the correct amplicon size for primers directed against
human CatSper4 exon9 and figure 3b shows the
normalised level of expression of CatSper 4 in the 18 tissues. These data confirm the prediction of testis specific
expression. Low expression levels were detected in placenta and lung, whereas no significant expression was
detected in any other tissue.
Protein features
CatSper 3 and 4 are predicted to contain 6 transmembrane regions denoted S1–S6 in figures 4a and 4b. S1–S4
are close together joined by short loop regions. A longer
loop region separates S5 and S6 and contains a short conserved hydrophobic stretch – see Figure 4 for topology cartoon of the CatSper family. The arrangement of these
transmembrane helices is characteristic of the voltage
gated channel ion transport domain found in voltagegated K+, Ca2+ and Na+ channels, and reported for the
other members of the CatSper channel family [5,6]. This
domain comprises 6 transmembrane helices with a hydrophobic channel pore loop and voltage-sensing region.

The voltage sensor lies within S4 transmembrane helix
and is involved in channel activation via positively
charged residues positioned every 3–4 amino acids [21].
Sequence alignment of S4 helices of selected voltage gated
Ca2+ channels with CatSper family (Figure 6a) shows that
a pattern of regular repeating basic residues (arginine/
lysine) are also present in the CatSper1 and CatSper2 S4
helices. However, in CatSper3 and CatSper4 subunits the
repeating charged residues are conserved to a lesser extent
with only two of the four charged residues found, suggest-

ing a reduced voltage dependent mechanism of activation
[21].
Ion specificity is determined by a pore consensus
sequence [T/S] × [D/E] × W in voltage gated Calcium
channels [22]. Sequence analysis of this region in the CatSpers highlights the presence of a similar conserved motif
T×D×W (Figure 5 and 6b) suggesting that the CatSper ion
channels may be selective for calcium ions, as previously
discussed for CatSper1 [5]. BLASTP homology searches
also link the CatSpers most closely with the T-type Calcium channels.
Each member of the CatSper family contains a coiled-coil
domain at its C terminus as predicted by COILS programme [14] and shown in Figure 7. Coiled-coils are well
characterised as potential protein-protein interaction
domains. They have also been found in multi-pass membrane proteins such as GABABR1 and GABABR2 to be the
site of receptor dimerisation [23,24]. Coiled-coils have
also been found in multi-protein complexes such as the
SNARE complex [25]. The identification of a common
protein-protein interaction domain in all four of the CatSper proteins within the context of a common expression
pattern and relationship to four-repeat calcium channels
suggest that the CatSper ion channel subunits assemble as
tetramers.

CatSper3 and CatSper4 extend the Calcium channel
family
The CatSper ion channel subunits are distant in sequence
relationship; sequence identity ranges between 21.6%
and 26.5% across the ion transport domain (Table 6).
This low sequence identity is in contrast with that
observed for the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel families. Calcium L-type calcium channels generally
share ~25% sequence identity over full their length
sequence and upwards of 75% sequence identity between
their corresponding ion-transport repeat regions (Table
7). These observations are further supported by the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 8) which shows that each repeat
is more closely related to its analogous repeat in a
paralagoue than to the other repeats in the same gene
unit, i.e. repeat I in alpha 1S is more closely related to
repeat I in alpha 1T than to repeat II in alpha 1S. Figure 9
shows the repeat topology of a voltage-gated cation channel. In addition, repeats 1 and 3, and repeats 2 and 4 share
common ancestry with all four repeats stemming from a
single common ancestor (Figure 8). In contrast, the
CatSper family members do not associate with any one
particular repeat, this therefore raises questions over the
detailed evolutionary history of the CatSper family.

Discussion
Here, we applied bioinformatic tools in a focused
approach to identify and characterise novel ion-channel
genes in both human and mouse genomes. We identified
two genes, CatSper3 and CatSper4, which extend the CatSper ion channel-like family to four members in human
and mouse. As previously described for CatSper1 and 2
[5,6], CatSper3 and 4 contain a single ion transport
domain comprised of 6 transmembrane spanning
regions, where the fourth transmembrane region
resembles a voltage sensor and a pore forming region lies
between transmembrane regions 5 and 6. The pore contains the consensus sequence T×D×W indicative of a probable calcium selective channel. Available expression data
suggest that CatSper3 and 4 are present in testis and may
also be found in other tissues. To date, CatSper1 and 2
have not shown channel activity when expressed in heterologous systems alone or when co-expressed. One explanation is that additional factors are required for full

function. The identification of two more CatSper like
channels both of which show expression in testis and
both of which resemble single pore forming repeats from
a multi-repeat channel, may well provide the missing factors required for a functional CatSper channel to be
formed.
Additionally, through our bioinformatic analysis of the
CatSper family we have annotated coiled-coil domains in
all four of the CatSper channels. Alpha helical coiled-coil
structural motifs are involved in subunit multimerisation
of a large number of proteins. For example, the GABAB
receptor assembly is mediated by short (~30 aa) parallel
coiled-coil alpha helices in the C-terminal of the
GABABR1 and GABABR2 receptors [24]. Coiled-coil
domains can also mediate formation of large multi-protein complexes such as the SNARE complex whose core
comprises a hetero-tetrameric coiled-coil [25]. Therefore a
precedent exists for a four coiled-coil complex. Identifica-

tion of the coiled-coil domains in the CatSper channels
provides an experimentally testable mechanism for CatSper channel tetramerisation. This in theory could involve
interaction at the coiled coil domain directly, or via intracellular accessory proteins that interact with the CatSper
subunits via the coiled coil motif, anchoring the subunits
together. A proposed model for subunit interaction is
shown in Figure 10. One question raised by the CatSper1
knockout experiment is how are the channels regulated by
cAMP/cGMP? We have searched for cyclic nucleotide
binding sites on the CatSper subunits, however no likely
domains have been identified, it is therefore possible that
this property is conferred by an auxiliary subunit and
therefore this would favour the model proposed in Figure
10c.

The above model for CatSper subunits function and interactions could be tested in a variety of experiments.
Function may be tested through targeted mutagenesis
experiments of the new CatSper subunits in mice as
described by Ren et al [5]. Expression of all four subunits
in an heterologous expression system could be attempted
with the aim of reconstituting a functional channel. To
identifying interactions via the coiled-coil domain, the
intracellular domain of the CatSper subunits could be
used as the "bait" in the yest two-hybrid system. This system was successful in identifying the GABABR2 receptor
as the co-receptor GABABR1 [23] via a coiled-coil domain.
Certainly the identification of two further CatSper
subunits provides further possibilities in which to test this

family of protein's function in sperm mobility and
fertility.
An interesting question posed by identification of four
CatSper genes is how did the CatSper family evolve.
Sequence comparison between family members show
each CatSper paralogoue to be equally distant from each
other, i.e. only around 25% sequence ID. Low sequence
identity would argue for an early duplication event or that
the CatSper subunits have resulted from convergent evolution of ion channel genes at different chromosomes
towards a common function. However, we cannot detect
any CatSper like channels in species lower than mouse.
This observation would argue for a more recent
evolutionary event or rapid evolution. It is notable that
sequence identity between repeats within a multi-repeat
channel share similar identities to those shared between
the CatSper channels ie around 25%. We explored the
possibility that a particular CatSper channel would represent one of the four repeating units found in channels
such as the L-type calcium channel. However, we cannot
form a direct one-to-one relationship between a particular
channel repeat and a CatSper unit to support this theory.

CatSper ion-channels present themselves as attractive
potential targets for non-hormonal contraceptives. Benoff
et al [26] have already illustrated the reversible
contraceptive effect of Nifedipine, a widely used calciumchannel blocker in the treatment of high blood pressure
and migraine. These effects are mediated via voltage-gated
calcium-channels, primarily the L-type voltage-gated
channels. The relationship of the CatSper subunits to the
voltage-gated calcium channels, their established role in
sperm motility and their testis restricted expression
pattern, therefore makes them a highly validated target for
the identification of novel contraceptives.

Concluding remarks
Based on our identification of two novel CatSper channels
and interaction domains we have presented a theoretical
model that suggests the CatSper proteins form subunits of
a hetero-tetrameric Ca2+ channel in sperm. We also further
suggest that experimental determination of this hypothesis and pharmacological studies may lead to the identification of non-hormonal contraceptives.
