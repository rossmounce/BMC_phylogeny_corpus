Abstract
Background: New drug targets are urgently needed for parasites of socio-economic importance. Genes that are
essential for parasite survival are highly desirable targets, but information on these genes is lacking, as gene knockouts
or knockdowns are difficult to perform in many species of parasites. We examined the applicability of large-scale
essentiality information from four model eukaryotes, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to discover essential genes in each of their genomes. Parasite genes that lack
orthologues in their host are desirable as selective targets, so we also examined prediction of essential genes within
this subset.
Results: Cross-species analyses showed that the evolutionary conservation of genes and the presence of essential
orthologues are each strong predictors of essentiality in eukaryotes. Absence of paralogues was also found to be a
general predictor of increased relative essentiality. By combining several orthology and essentiality criteria one can
select gene sets with up to a five-fold enrichment in essential genes compared with a random selection. We show how
quantitative application of such criteria can be used to predict a ranked list of potential drug targets from Ancylostoma
caninum and Haemonchus contortus - two blood-feeding strongylid nematodes, for which there are presently limited
sequence data but no functional genomic tools.
Conclusions: The present study demonstrates the utility of using orthology information from multiple, diverse
eukaryotes to predict essential genes. The data also emphasize the challenge of identifying essential genes among
those in a parasite that are absent from its host.
Background
Until recently, the search for novel drugs against parasites
has been carried out mainly using approaches that
directly screen for inhibition of parasite growth or lethality. The current industry and regulatory focus on targetbased drug development has meant that the search for
new anti-parasitic compounds has also moved to a targetbased paradigm. The completion of genome projects and
large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) surveys for a
range of parasites now means that tens of thousands of

potential drug targets are potentially accessible for many
of these organisms. The major challenge now is not only
to identify putative targets, but also to prioritize them,
such that available resources can be focused on those
most likely to lead to effective treatments/drugs. This
aspect is most pressing for neglected infectious diseases
which cause a disproportionate burden in developing
countries and for which the costs of the drug development process have deterred investment by the pharmaceutical industry [1]. Thus, well-considered approaches
to predict the most promising targets and to identify
those most likely to be essential are required to increase
the likelihood that lead compounds proceed to commercial development [2].
Identifying essential genes of pathogens is important
because chemical inhibition of non-essential genes is
unlikely to result in the death of the infectious agent,

whereas the use of non-essential molecules, for example,
for vaccine targets might rapidly select for mutants that
evade protective immune responses. Essentiality, however, is difficult to define because its application is necessarily restricted to the experimental conditions being
tested. Despite this limitation, indispensability under a
defined laboratory condition can be a useful starting
point for identifying biological processes that are likely to
be crucial for the survival of an organism under natural
conditions. The proliferation of genome sequencing projects has been followed by systematic analyses of gene
knockouts and/or knockdowns to determine essentiality
in a number of model eubacteria and eukaryotes, such as
Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Caenorhabditis elegans [3-8]. Unfortunately, few infectious agents are currently amenable to whole-genome
approaches for the experimental testing of essentiality,
such that promising candidate drug targets must be individually validated genetically. This is particularly true of
eukaryotic parasites, for which the genetic tools to characterize drug or vaccine targets are often limited, and
absent for many others.
A particularly challenging area is the development of
novel compounds to combat parasitic helminths of animals. Such helminths are of major socio-economic
importance; more than a billion people are infected with
soil-transmitted worms (= geohelminths), such as the
blood-feeding hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and
Necator americanus, the common roundworm, Ascaris
lumbricoides, and the whipworm, Trichuris trichiura
[9,10]. These parasites alone impose a worldwide annual
burden of 39 million Disability Adjusted Life Years
(DALYs) and cause serious adverse effects on human
health, particularly in children [10]. Similarly, parasitic
nematodes of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, also
cause substantial economic losses due to the diseases
they cause, with billions of dollars spent annually on the
treatment of gastro-intestinal nematodes alone. Resistance is emerging to all of the main classes of anthelmintics used to combat parasitism [11-14], creating a serious
need for new classes of compounds.
Although desirable, anthelmintic targets do not necessarily need to be encoded by essential genes. For example
a number of anthelmintics (such as aldicarb and trichlorfon) target acetylcholinesterases, and perturbations or
silencing of C. elegans acetylcholinesterase genes can
result in a viable phenotye (but sometimes with drug
resistant phenotypes) [15]. Likewise, levamisole targets
acetylcholine receptors, and the disruption of several
subunits of these receptors also leads to a viable levamisole resistant phenotype[16]. Despite the precedence for
successful drugs that act through agonist relationships
with non-essential molecules, essentiality is a desirable
character of genes to be pursued by a target-centric
approach. Although the relative success of target-based

Page 2 of 14

screening is uncertain compared with whole organisms
screens, future screening against single molecule targets
is likely to measure loss-of-function linked to lethality,
rather than searching for modulators or agonists. Therefore, the prediction and identification of essential genes
in parasitic helminths is considered an important step
towards the prioritization of drug targets in nematodes.
There has been significant growth in the amount of
sequence data for nematodes, enabling the prediction of
numerous potential drug targets. Much focus has been
on the sequencing of ESTs [17-23] due, in part, to difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of genetically
homogenous material from heterologous worm populations for genomic sequencing. However, some progress
has been made on whole genome sequencing (e.g., Brugia
malayi) [24], and a program has recently received funding for the sequencing of a range of socio-economically
important nematodes of the order Strongylida [25]. The
data emerging from these sequencing projects have
spurred the identification of drug targets in parasitic
nematodes using bioinformatic techniques (e.g., [26]), but
the testing of essentiality for these targets has generally
been absent. Members of the Strongylida cannot be propagated (through the entire life cycle) in culture in vitro. In
addition, gene silencing (double-stranded RNA interference, RNAi) does not work effectively in the parasitic
nematodes of this order assessed thus far, such that, currently, there are major limitations in conducting functional studies in different developmental stages of these
parasites [27-29] in order to pre-validate potential drug
targets.
The paucity of experimental tools to characterize drug
targets in the Strongylida intensifies the need to predict
which putative targets are most likely to be essential; in
this case, predictions are necessarily based on inference
from orthologues in model organisms. However, a rational method for applying knowledge of essentiality from
orthologues in other species is lacking. Taking advantage
of recent advances in whole genome orthology mapping
[30] and the availability of large-scale eukaryotic essentiality datasets [31-33], we have created a database to analyse how essentiality can be predicted from existing data
from model eukaryotes. The designation of essentiality in
these diverse organisms means quite different things. In
yeast, essentiality can refer to a failure to grow in culture,
whereas in mice it can encompass the failure of embryos
to progress to live offspring.
In the present study, we tested whether these disparate
forms of essentiality are predictive of the corresponding
phenotypes in other organisms and show that definitions
of essentiality are strongly predictive of essentiality even
in relatively distantly related eukaryotes. We applied lessons from these analyses to the prediction of essential
genes in parasitic nematodes. Members of the order
Strongylida are considered to be relatively closely related

to Caenorhabditis elegans, being within clade V [34], such
that it is considered appropriate to infer gene function
from the abundant functional genomic data (including a
whole genome RNAi knockdown) that exist for C. elegans
[26,35,36]. In addition to a rational prediction of essentiality from orthology and essentiality data, we integrated
recently developed gene network connectivity data [37]
to further predict key, essential genes that may offer
promising and testable drug targets.
Another criterion that can be employed for the prediction of drug targets in infectious organisms is the absence
of a corresponding host orthologue, so as to maximise
opportunities for pharmacological selectivity. However,
many successful exceptions to this criterion exist; for
example, genuine targets may be differentially regulated
between pathogen and host [38], protein turnover may be
more rapid in the host than the pathogen [39], targets
may be active only in proliferating and cancerous cells in
the host [40], or may be sufficiently structurally different
between host and pathogen to allow selectivity [41]. We
investigated the effect of excluding genes that possess
mammalian orthologues and discovered that the remaining genes are much less likely to be essential. Therefore,
we developed more flexible prioritization methods that
are not limited by the requirement for genes to lack host
orthologues. In the present study, we applied these techniques to predict of essential drug targets in large EST
data sets representing two blood-feeding strongylid nematodes of major socio-economic importance, namely
Haemonchus contortus (the barber's pole worm of small
ruminants) and Ancylostoma caninum (canine hookworm). We combined this prioritization strategy with
other criteria to predict molecules as drug targets in these
haematophagous nematodes as a proof-of-principle
application of using orthology to predict essentiality.

genetic experiments involving mouse genes did have a
higher percentage of reports of lethality/essentiality than
the other organisms studied (Figure 1), which may reflect
selection bias. Nonetheless, the patterns observed for the
prediction of essentiality from orthology in the M. musculus dataset paralleled those in the other organisms
assessed, supporting their inclusion in the present analyses.
Prediction of essentiality based on phyletic characteristics presence of paralogues

We interrogated our database to determine whether paralogy was a useful predictor of essentiality. Intuitively,
belonging to a paralogous family may suggest some
degree of redundancy that could compensate for a disrupted gene; indeed, previous studies of C. elegans and S.
cerevisiae have indicated that genes with paralogues are
less likely to be essential [42,43]. However, in the mouse, a
recent analysis [44] revealed no difference between genes
with and without paralogues. These studies used different
criteria to define paralogues and, in some cases, included
genes that cause sterility as being essential, making it difficult to compare results among studies. Therefore, to
compare the effect of paralogy on the likelihood of lethality among different species, we used a single method for
the definition of a paralogue (OrthoMCL), combined
with existing large-scale essentiality data for C. elegans,
D. melanogaster, M. musculus and S. cerevisiae. The presence of paralogues was inferred from OrthoMCL groups;
if there was more than one gene from a species in an
OrthoMCL group, these genes were classified as genes
with paralogues. The probability of essentiality for genes

Results
Database of essentiality

To enable the comparison of phenotypes among the four
model organisms - Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster, Mus musculus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae - a database was constructed to allow the mapping of
phenotype data among orthologues. Orthology was
determined using the OrthoMCL database [30], and was
populated with phenotype data for these four species. In
the case of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae,
phenotype information was available for 94%, 75% and
88% of all protein-coding genes respectively. For M. musculus, gene knockouts/knockdowns represented 20% of
all protein-coding genes. Because the genes chosen for
knockout analysis in mice were selected to address specific phenotypic questions, it is possible that this nonrandom collection may introduce some bias towards or
away from genes that are expected to be essential. Indeed,

with available phenotype information for each species. Differences in
essentiality of genes with versus without paralogues were highly statistically significant (P < 10-04), as determined using Fisher's exact test
(Additional File 2).

with or without paralogues is shown in Figure 1 and
Additional File 1: Table S1.
For C. elegans and S. cerevisiae, we found that genes
without paralogues were significantly more likely to be
essential than genes with paralogues (Figure 1). For C.
elegans, there was a 1.6-fold greater probability of essentiality for genes without paralogues (P < 10-33, Fisher's
exact test, Additional File 2), whereas for S. cerevisiae,
there was a 3.8-fold greater probability of essentiality (P <
10-51). For D. melanogaster, genes without paralogues
were also more likely to be essential (1.4-fold, P < 10-12),
though to a lesser extent than for C. elegans and S. cerevisiae. The incomplete dataset of M. musculus differed
from those of the other three species in that genes without paralogues were (0.9-fold, P < 10-04) less likely to be
essential than genes with paralogues.
Prediction of essentiality based on phyletic characteristics presence of orthologues

Genes that are shared among species have been hypothesized previously to be those that are more likely to be
essential [45]. However, there is no evidence that this proposal has been tested quantitatively for eukaryotes, and
we were unaware of published studies that demonstrated
the effect of the breadth and extent of conservation over
large evolutionary distances on the probability of essentiality. Indications that gene conservation could be used as
a predictor of essentiality in eukaryotes comes from a
study of 315 essential genes of Danio rerio (zebrafish)
[46], which found that essential genes were more likely to
be conserved than non-essential genes. To test the effect
of conservation of genes on essentiality, we analysed the
frequency of essentiality among genes with orthologues
in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus and S. cerevisiae. For each of the four species, we tested the effect of
conservation of a gene in one or more species on essentiality in another (query) species. For example, to examine
how well the presence of an orthologue in S. cerevisiae
predicts essentiality in C. elegans, we first identified
orthology groups comprising genes from these two species, and then, for the C. elegans genes in these groups,
we calculated the percent that were essential. The findings are shown in Figure 2 and Additional File 1: Table S2.
For genes in each of the four species, the existence of an
orthologue in other species increased the probability of
essentiality, and the more distant the source of the orthologue, the greater this effect. For C. elegans, the probability of essentiality for a gene without paralogues selected
at random was 18%; this probability increased to 38% if
the gene had an orthologue in D. melanogaster and to
51% if an orthologue existed in the more distant relative,
S. cerevisiae (Figure 2). Conservation over a greater evolutionary distance therefore appears to be a better indica-

tor of essentiality than conservation between or among
organisms that have diverged more recently. We also
tested whether the conservation of orthologues among
multiple species would improve the probability of essentiality in any particular species. For nearly all combinations, this was indeed the case (see Figure 2). For
example, 51% of C. elegans genes with orthologues in S.
cerevisiae are essential, and 53% of C. elegans genes that
have orthologues in both S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster are essential. There are several exceptions whose
causes are unclear- e.g., genes present in all four species,
C. elegans, D. melanogaster, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus, were less likely to be essential when knocked down in
Drosophila than those that were present in only the former three species (Figure 2).
Prediction based on orthology mapping of existing
essentiality data for the four species

Subsequently, we tested whether the presence of an
essential orthologue is more predictive of the essentiality
of a gene than the presence of a non-essential orthologue.
This has been explored previously in the bacterium
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which essential genes have
been predicted by identifying genes that are homologous
to essential genes in other unicellular micro-organisms,
such as Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and S.
cerevisiae [47]. This set of genes predicted to be essential
was indeed in agreement with genes shown experimentally to be essential. However, whether essentiality of an
orthologue can be used to predict essentiality for multicellular organisms had not been tested. For C. elegans, D.
melanogaster, M. musculus and S. cerevisiae, we assessed
whether essentiality in one species could be used as a predictor of essentiality in a second species. To do this for
each query species (ie C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M.
musculus and S. cerevisiae), we assessed the probability of
essentiality for genes that have lethal phenotypes in the
other three species. When comparing phenotypes linked
to particular genes among species, we limited the analysis
to genes with no paralogues in each of the species being
compared; this was conducted to avoid the difficulty of
comparing phenotypes when individual paralogues were
associated with different phenotypes. To test whether
having essential orthologues in S. cerevisiae predicted
essentiality in the corresponding C. elegans genes, we
identified orthology groups containing non-paralogous
C. elegans and S. cerevisiae genes that had been subjected
to essentiality analysis. We then compared the frequency
of essentiality for C. elegans genes that grouped with
essential or non-essential S. cerevisiae orthologues. We
also tested whether essentiality in multiple species
improved the probability of essentiality. The results of the

Figure 2 Effect of gene conservation on probability of essentiality of genes. This graph shows the probability of essentiality for genes from C.
elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus and S. cerevisiae respectively, modified by their phyletic profile. The percentages show the number of genes with
lethal phenotypes divided by the total number of genes with orthologues in the species being compared. Specificity refers to the proportion of genes
in the selected subset that are essential and sensitivity refers to the proportion of the total number of essential genes for that species that are recovered in the selected subset. In all cases, essentiality was assessed for genes without paralogues. The probability of essentiality for genes in each of the
specified subsets versus a gene selected at random from the query genome were all statistically significant (P < 10-05), as determined using Fisher's
exact test (Additional File 2). C = C. elegans, D = D. melanogaster, M = M. musculus, D = D. melanogaster, S = S. cerevisiae.

predictions for C. elegans and the other three species are
shown in Figure 3 and Additional File 1: Table S3, respectively.
Our analysis showed that a gene with an orthologue
with a lethal knockout/knockdown phenotype was more
likely to be essential than if the orthologue were nonessential; the more distant the orthologue, the greater
was the probability of essentiality. Thus, the existence of
an orthologue associated with a lethal phenotype in S.
cerevisiae was highly predictive of lethality in C. elegans
(72%), greater than the presence alone of an orthologue in
S. cerevisiae (51%). Combining the presence of an essential orthologue in an evolutionarily more distant relative
(S. cerevisiae) with an additional, closely-related species
(i.e., D. melanogaster) increased this probability further C. elegans genes with an orthologue in both D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae, each with a lethal phenotype, had
an 81% probability of lethality.
The effect of drug-target selectivity on predictions of
essentiality

Anti-parasitic drugs need to selectively inhibit or kill the
parasite without causing unacceptable toxicity to the
host. One way of pursuing targets for such drugs is to
focus on parasite genes that lack host orthologues. As our
aim was to identify targets for parasitic nematodes that
infect mammals, we examined the possible effects on
essentiality of focusing on parasite genes that lack mammalian orthologues. To do this, we analysed the probability of essentiality for C. elegans genes that either
possessed or lacked mammalian orthologues. To obtain
the set of C. elegans genes without mammalian orthologues, we identified C. elegans genes that were in an

Figure 3 Effect of conservation of essential genes on probability
of essentiality. This graph shows the likelihood of essentiality for C. elegans genes with essential orthologues in one or more of the organisms; D. melanogaster, M. musculus and S. cerevisiae. The percentages
are the number of genes with lethal phenotypes divided by the total
number of genes with orthologues in that species. Essentiality was assessed for genes without paralogues. C = C. elegans, D = D. melanogaster, M = M. musculus, S = S. cerevisiae.

OrthoMCL group that did not have a gene in any of the
three mammals considered (i.e., Homo sapiens, M. musculus and Rattus norvegicus). We then calculated the
probability of essentiality of these genes. C. elegans genes
that lacked mammalian orthologues were much less likely
to be essential; the probability of essentiality decreased
from 16% to 8% for a gene selected at random, and was
only 6% if the gene had paralogues (Table 1, Figure 3).
This substantial decrease in the probability of essentiality
has important consequences for drug target prediction
that have not been made explicit previously. Researchers
are quite likely to examine genes in exactly this category
(i.e. present in a pathogen but absent from the host), but
the very low "raw" probability of essentiality for these
genes (6-8%) highlights the challenge for the prediction of
essential drug targets from such a subset, which we
address here.
Prediction of drug targets in Anyclostoma caninum and
Haemonchus contortus: combining 'assayability' with the
prediction of essentiality

The present findings were applied to the prediction of
drug targets in haematophagous parasitic nematodes, as
outlined in a flow diagram (Figure 4). The parasites Ancylostoma caninum and Haemonchus contortus were
selected to represent parasitic nematodes of the order
Strongylida ("clade V" [34]), for which significant EST
sequence data exist. All available EST data for A. caninum
and H. contortus (comprising 21,975 and 80,551 ESTs,
respectively) were downloaded from the NCBI database.
These ESTs were first mapped to the OrthoMCL orthology groups by a BLASTX analysis of individual EST
sequences against all OrthoMCL proteins using the
OrthoSelect method [48]. A caveat of this EST-based
analysis is that the incompleteness of genomes for the
parasitic nematodes means that there will be poorer identification of paralogues and orthologues. This analysis
was followed by the extraction of C. elegans orthologues
from the orthology groups. Previously, we showed that
having an essential orthologue was a better predictor of
essentiality than just having an orthologue (e.g., for C. elegans, a gene that has an orthologue that is essential in D.
melanogaster is 1.6-fold more likely to be essential than if
the C. elegans gene just has an orthologue in D. melanogaster). We therefore focused on the subset of C. elegans
orthologues of the parasitic nematodes that were essential (i.e., genes that have lethal RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans).
Assayability requirement: enzymes, ion channels and
GPCRs

To select targets that are most amenable to in vitro
screening for growth inhibition or lethality, we focused
on genes encoding proteins for which functional assays

exist. Thus, we examined the subset of C. elegans genes
encoding proteins inferred to have enzymatic, ion channel, or GPCR activity, as determined by GO term annotation (i.e., GO:0003824, GO:0005216 or GO:0004930, or a
subterm thereof ). All current drugs in clinical use against
nematodes target a protein in one of these three categories. GPCRs are the targets of more than 50% of pharmaceutical drugs [49], making them attractive targets also in
parasitic nematodes. We found that enzymes were more
likely to be essential than non-enzymes for both C. elegans and S. cerevisiae - for C. elegans, 16% of all genes
were essential, whereas 21% of enzymes were essential;
for S. cerevisiae, 19% of genes were essential, while 24% of
enzymes were essential - so, by focusing on enzymes, we
further increased our likelihood of identifying essential
genes.
Essentiality requirement: quantitative formula for
maximum prediction of essentiality based on the present
analysis

We applied a quantitative weighting scheme to the genes
that met the criterion for assayability, according to the
present analysis of the relative importance of each feature
in determining essentiality. For example, we showed that
having no paralogue increased the probability of essentiality by 1.6-fold in C. elegans (Table 1), having an orthologue with no paralogues in S. cerevisiae or D.
melanogaster increased probability by 3.3 and 2.4-fold,
respectively. (Figure 3). Furthermore, having an orthologue with no paralogues that was essential in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster increased the probability of
essentiality by 5.2-fold. These fold increases were all statistically significant (P < 0.0005), as determined using
Fisher's exact test (Additional File 2). This weighting
should thus score genes numerically in order of the probability that such genes are essential.

Increasing the probability of essentiality by incorporating
information on network connectivity

Recently, Lee et al. [37] constructed a probabilistic functional interaction network for C. elegans, the largest such
network to date, comprising ~82% of all C. elegans genes.
This network integrates data for proteins and genes (e.g.,
microarray data and interaction and association information) using information about C. elegans genes as well as
their orthologues in other species. Using this network,
the authors showed that gene connectivity is predictive of
essentiality - genes that were highly connected in the network were more likely to be essential; this was shown to
be a feature that was conserved across eukaryotes
(including S. cerevisiae and M. musculus). An independent study by Hwang and colleagues also showed that
genes encoding proteins with higher connectivity in protein-protein interaction networks were more likely to be
essential in E. coli and in S. cerevisiae [50]. As genes with
higher network connectivity scores (as assigned by Lee et
al) were more likely to be essential than those with lower
scores [37], we gave greater weighting to genes with
higher connectivity scores.
We combined the quantitative weighting scheme with
network connectivity scores to produce a prioritized list
of putative drug targets for A. caninum and H. contortus
(Additional file 3). These represent predicted C. elegans
orthologues of the A. caninum and H. contortus ESTs that
were chosen for assayability (enzyme, ion-channel or
GPCR), with a quantitative ranking scheme applied to
predict essentiality. Genes were included in the list if they
related to a lethal RNAi phenotype in C. elegans.
Although the list comes from an incomplete EST snapshot of these haematophagous helminths, it nevertheless

Prioritized list of targets for parasitic nematodes
Figure 4 Prioritizing essential nematode drug targets. This flow diagram outlines our approach to drug target prediction and prioritization for parasitic nematodes. Some steps are clear "keep or reject"
decisions because the genes failing these criteria are either not easily
amenable to further development or have an unacceptable probability of being essential. Other steps are used to quantitatively refine the
weighting to produce a ranked list of essential drug targets.

ate reductase, the C. elegans equivalent of one helminth
target of thiabendazole [53].
A likely application of this prioritization method could
be to focus on a particular subset of enzymes in which an
investigator has expertise. For example, if the aim was to
identify promising kinase drug targets, all kinases from
the ranked list could be extracted and appraised. There
are 49 predicted kinases (Figure 5) in the H. contortus and
A. caninum EST datasets. Those at the top of the list
would be expected to be most likely to be essential in
these two parasitic nematodes, based on the present analyses. Although the numerical weighting cannot give an

exact probability of essentiality for each uncharacterized
gene, the weightings should give an estimation of the relative likelihood of being essential for any two genes being
considered as candidate targets.

Discussion
Defining essential genes is a central strategy in the prioritization of drug targets in infectious organisms. Although
some non-essential genes may act as drug targets by converting non-toxic precursors to toxic products, most
anti-microbials act by inhibiting the function of an essential process, leading to the death of the pathogen, either
through direct absence of that essential process or, indirectly, though a stress-related response. A number of
anthelmintic drugs (e.g. levamisole [16] and ivermectin
[54]) appear to function as agonists of non-essential
genes (for a review of anthelmintic modes of action see
[55]). Although the search for drug targets among essential genes is a useful approach for the prioritization of targets, the inability of this methodology to predict some of
the successful anti-parasitic drug targets is a limitation of
this practice.
There have been several attempts to define or predict
essential genes in infectious agents; in a few cases, where
sophisticated functional genomic tools have been available, this has been possible through the systematic disruption of candidate genes, for example, in Streptococcus
pneumoniae [56], Candida albicans [57], Aspergillus
fumigatus [58]) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [7,8].
However, for the vast majority of infectious organisms,
high-throughput experimental interrogation of essentiality is currently not possible, and efforts to define essentiality have been based on bioinformatic predictions [5963].
Here, we have attempted to define general characters
that are predictive of essentiality of eukaryotic genes
through orthology. Previous studies have shown that conservation between genomes is itself a predictive feature of
essential genes. Studies by Butland, [64] Hwang [50] Krogan [65] and colleagues showed that essential genes in S.
cerevisiae and E. coli are both more widely phyletically
distributed, and are more connected through physical
and functional protein-protein interactions. Our data
show that broad evolutionary conservation of genes
(among multicellular eukaryotes) is predictive of essentiality, and also that essentiality of those orthologues is a
strong predictor. Combining individual criteria that are
independently predictive of essentiality increases the
specificity of prediction - for example, a C. elegans gene
selected at random is only 16% likely to be essential,
whereas C. elegans genes that lack paralogues and have
essential orthologues in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster
are 81% likely to be essential. This dramatic increase in

Figure 5 Prioritized kinases for the parasitic nematodes A. caninum and H. contortus. This shows the C. elegans predicted orthologues of the A.
caninum and H. contortus ESTs, as identified in the present study. All genes are predicted kinases, have a lethal RNAi phenotype in C. elegans. Targets
were first prioritized by the essentiality weighting assigned from the present study, then by Wormnet connectivity score. The top two ranked kinases
(in bold) are among the top thirty ranked targets from all ESTs (Additional File 3). Present in mammals is defined by having an orthologue in one or
more of the mammalian species in the OrthoMCL 2.0 database (human, rat, mouse). Essential orthologue in yeast, drosophila or mouse: ? = orthologue
(with no paralogues) associated with a lethal phenotype, ? = orthologue (with no paralogues) that had only non-lethal phenotypes recorded, ? = orthologue (with no paralogues) but no phenotype information was available. Presence of paralogues in C. elegans was determined from the OrthoMCL
grouping. Presence of paralogues in A. caninum and H. contortus was determined as described in Materials and methods. The network connectivity
score is the sum of all interaction scores (log-likelihood scores) for the gene in the Wormnet core network [37].

the specificity of prediction increases the probability of
essentiality from a dishearteningly low level, at which a
randomly chosen drug target candidate is very likely to be
non-essential, to a reassuring level where prioritized candidates are very likely to be essential. However, the
increase in specificity associated with these predictions is
also accompanied by a decrease in sensitivity - many genuinely essential genes are discarded in such highly pre-

scriptive queries. In the present example, only 258
candidates remained from a set of 2941 C. elegans genes
determined experimentally to be essential. In practice,
the investigator must balance the desired specificity of
the query against the desired pool size of the selected targets, or highly weight the most specific predictors, so that
genes most likely to be essential are ranked at the top.

The discovery that the exclusion of genes with mammalian orthologues leads to sets of genes that are much less
likely to be essential has major implications, because it
highlights an additional challenge for the identification of
drug targets that still allow selectivity. The decreased
essentiality can be readily rationalised, considering the
analyses herein of the relationship between orthology and
essentiality. In this case, we excluded a set of genes that
shared orthology between worms and mammals. The
resultant set, conserved between fewer organisms, contained a higher proportion of non-essential genes.
We focused on enzymes, ion channels and G-proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) because the vast majority of
all drugs target these classes [49,66] and chemicals
already exist to interrogate such targets. Furthermore, we
found that the proportion of essential genes is greater for
enzymes than for other protein-coding genes, for both C.
elegans and S. cerevisiae.
In this study, we applied semi- quantitative methods to
identify essential genes in parasitic helminths. These
methods should be equally applicable to the prediction of
essential genes in many eukaryotic pathogens with EST
or genome projects. We have shown that genes that have
essential orthologues have a greatly increased probability
of essentiality so a researcher could identify the genes in
their parasite of interest that were essential in C. elegans,
D. melanogaster, M. musculus and/or S. cerevisiae. As
these species are all distantly related to protozoan species, essentiality in one or more of these species could be
highly suggestive of essentiality in a protozoan parasite
versus genes that are not essential in any of these model
organisms.
In addition to identifying drug targets, identification of
promising vaccine candidates is also a priority for parasitic diseases. Although essentiality is likely to be an
important characteristic of vaccine targets, a large variety
of other characters are also desirable but currently difficult to establish bioinformatically, particularly for an
incomplete genome. Although these characters may
become more tractable in the near future, the current
approach is not appropriate for identifying vaccine antigens.

Conclusions
In this study, we undertook a quantitative assessment of
essentiality and its inference using orthology. This analysis demonstrates the utility of examining multiple, diverse
organisms when predicting essentiality, and shows that
essentiality for one gene is highly predictive of essentiality
for its orthologues, even for organisms with extremely
different life cycles. These data also highlight the potential for undesirably enriching for non-essential genes
when prioritizing genes in a pathogen that are absent

Page 10 of 14

from their host. We quantitatively applied the conclusions from this analysis to the prediction of essential
genes in blood-feeding parasitic nematodes, combining
this with the requirement for assayability to identify targets readily amenable to further investigation. Our analysis has led to the prioritization of a tractable number of
potential drug targets leading toward the development of
nematocidal agents.

Methods
Orthology data

Orthology data were obtained from OrthoMCL [30],
available at http://www.orthomcl.org. OrthoMCL classifies genes from 87 genomes into orthology groups. Files
containing protein sequence data and orthology group
information were downloaded from OrthoMCL version
2. This dataset contained 20084, 14034, 24435 and 6718
proteins from C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus
and S. cerevisiae, respectively and includes genes assigned
to orthology groups in the OrthoMCL dataset and also
those not assigned to any group (annotated in OrthoMCL
with 'no_group'). Orthologues are genes deriving from an
ancestral gene that were separated by a speciation event,
while paralogues are genes that were separated by a gene
duplication event within a genome. Subsequent speciation can lead to paralogous relationships between genes
from different genomes (referred to as out-paralogues)
[67]. In practice, the identification of these relationships
is non-trivial and is most robust where complete genome
data and sequences with useful phylogenetically informative characters allow unambiguous phylogenetic trees to
be constructed. This is currently not computationally or
practically feasible for multi-eukaryote, whole genome
analyses. The OrthoMCL clustering method provides a
convenient, but necessarily imperfect means of estimating orthology and paralogy. In-paralogues and out-paralogues that are separated by a recent duplication event will
normally be clustered into a OrthoMCL group that may
represent a gene/protein family, whereas more ancient
duplications are more likely to result in separate clusters
[68]. For the purposes of this paper, genes from different
species that share the same OrthoMCL cluster are considered to be orthologues, while multiple genes from
within the same species that share the same OrthoMCL
cluster are considered paralogues. Additional File 4 demonstrates example phylogenetic trees of three representative types of orthologue clusters.
Phenotype data

Phenotype information was obtained for C. elegans, M.
musculus and S. cerevisiae from the databases Wormbase
WS191 http://www.wormbase.org[69], Mouse Genome
Informatics (http://www.informatics.jax.org; June 2008

Doyle et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/222

[70]) and Saccharomyces Genome Database (http://
www.yeastgenome.org; Aug 2008) [71], respectively. For
D. melanogaster we used the results of the genome-wide
RNAi screen [33]). In order to focus on phenotypes that
result from disruption/inhibition of proteins, as opposed
to overexpression phenotypes, we restricted our analysis
to phenotypes from the following experiment/mutant
types: C. elegans (RNAi), S. cerevisiae (null, reduction of
function, repressible), D. melanogaster (RNAi) and M.
musculus (included phenotypes from the following
experiments: Chemically and radiation induced, Chemically induced (ENU), Chemically induced (other), Gene
trapped, Radiation induced, Spontaneous, Targeted
(knock-out), Targeted (Reporter), Targeted (Floxed/Flt),
Transgenic (random, gene disruption)). Essential genes
were defined as follows; for C. elegans and M. musculus
these were genes with a phenotype description containing the term 'lethal' (see Additional File 5 for a list of these
phenotypes), for S. cerevisiae these were genes with the
phenotype 'inviable', for D. melanogaster these were
genes that showed lethality during the Adult, Pupal,
Before Pupal or Eclosion life-stage from [33]. We cannot
exclude the possibility that some of the phenotypes from
M. musculus may not result from protein disruption/
inhibition, for example, it is possible that chemical or
spontaneous mutation could result in constitutive activation of a protein or a gain-of-function. However, including these phenotypes should only result in a more
conservative prediction of essentiality because it would
mean that some of the M. musculus genes might be
falsely classed as essential orthologues and when used to
predict essentiality in C. elegans would lead to a lower
probability of essentiality for C. elegans.
Construction of a database for whole-genome comparisons
of essentiality

To enable the comparison of phenotypes among all four
species, a relational database was constructed to map
phenotype data for these species to their OrthoMCL
genes and groups. This database was a PostgreSQL database http://www.postgresql.org which used a Ruby on
Rails framework http://www.rubyonrails.org. Custom
tables were designed to store the data and the OrthoMCL
proteins were mapped to the genes in the phenotype files
using the gene identifiers present in the datasets (identifiers of the type WBGene00000001 for C. elegans, CG3095
for D. melanogaster, ENSMUSG00000020473 for M.
musculus and YNL214W for S. cerevisiae). The software
used in this process is available at http://github.com/
wwood/essentiality. Phenotype data were available for
94% (18860/20084), 75% (10572/14034), and 88% (5908/
6718) of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae
genes in the OrthoMCL dataset, respectively. In contrast,

Page 11 of 14

phenotype data were available for 20% (5008/24435) of
M. musculus OrthoMCL genes.
Computational predictions of essentiality

Custom Ruby scripts were written to query the database
through the Ruby on Rails framework. Genes without
paralogues were defined as those genes in OrthoMCL
groups with only one gene from the query species, or
genes from the query species in the OrthoMCL dataset
that were assigned 'no_group'. The number of genes with
paralogues was obtained by subtracting the number of
genes without paralogues from the total number of genes
for the query species.
To analyze the effect of presence of orthologues on
probability of essentiality, for example, the effect of having a yeast orthologue on probability of essentiality of C.
elegans genes, the OrthoMCL groups that contained a
gene from both species were first identified. Next the
subset of groups were selected that contained only one
gene from both S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, these were
the genes without paralogues for both species. Then, for
the C. elegans genes in these groups the number of genes
with lethal phenotypes was calculated and expressed as a
percent of the total number of C. elegans genes with
orthologues in S. cerevisiae (numbers of genes are given
in Additional File 1: Table S2).
To analyze the frequency of essentiality among genes
with essential orthologues in C. elegans, for example, to
examine how well the presence of an essential orthologue
in S. cerevisiae predicts essentiality in C. elegans, the
OrthoMCL groups that contained a gene from both species were first identified. Next the subset of groups were
selected that contained only one gene from both S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, this was followed by identifying the
subset of groups that had an essential S. cerevisiae orthologue. Then for the C. elegans genes in these groups the
number of genes with lethal phenotypes was calculated
and expressed as a percent of the total number of C. elegans genes with an essential orthologue in S. cerevisiae
(numbers of genes are given in Additional File 1: Table
S3).
The set of C. elegans genes without mammalian orthologues were those genes that were either in an OrthoMCL
group that did not contain a gene from any of the three
mammalian species in OrthoMCL (Homo sapiens, M.
musculus or Rattus norvegicus) or C. elegans genes that
were assigned to 'no_group' by OrthoMCL.
Prediction of drug targets for parasitic nematodes

All available ESTs for H. contortus and A. caninum were
downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) and comprised 21,975 and 80,551
ESTs respectively. The ESTs were cleaned of vector using

Doyle et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/222

SeqClean, repeats were masked with Repeatmasker, using
default parameters for both programs. We initially used
the CAP3 program for clustering the ESTs, however,
manual inspection of the results led us to discover that we
were getting incorrect clustering - clustering of ESTs
from similar but not identical genes into the same contig
for example ESTs from large gene families such as collagens, lectins, cysteine proteases. We tried increasing the
percent identity cutoff of the CAP3 program from the
default 80% to 95% however we still found incorrect clustering on manual inspection. The ESTs were therefore
individually mapped to OrthoMCL orthology groups
using the initial steps of the OrthoSelect method
described by Schreiber and colleagues [48]. Briefly, ESTs
assigned to an orthology group had to have a sufficient
BLASTX e-value, when averaged over the best hit from
each species, where the default score cutoff was used. As
ESTs frequently represent small fragments of genes, a
caveat for this type of analysis is that the shorter length
makes assignment to orthologue groups less robust.
An OrthoMCL group was defined as containing paralogues in the parasitic nematodes if any two of the ESTs
had a TBLASTX hit (e-value < 1e-10) to each other, as well
an imperfect BLASTN hit (identity < 95%). This conservative e-value was used to avoid missing potential paralogous relationships at the cost of flagging potential false
positive paralogues pairs that could be manually checked.
Additionally, OrthoMCL groups containing two or more
C. elegans proteins were considered as containing paralogues. The C. elegans gene(s) in that group were then
classed as orthologues of the parasite EST and our drug
target selection criteria were applied to these C. elegans
genes. A caveat to this OrthoSelect/OrthoMCL clustering approach is that members of a recently diverged gene
family, or some genes that share only a common domain,
may be classified here as paralogues, even where they
now have distinct roles that are not functionally redundant. This should be improved by a preliminary ESTclustering step, which could be included for future analyses of EST datasets more amenable to such clustering.
The A. caninum ESTs could be assigned to 2313
OrthoMCL groups, resulting in 2743 C. elegans genes
being predicted as orthologues of the A. caninum ESTs.
The H. contortus ESTs could be assigned to 2230
OrthoMCL groups, resulting in 2650 C. elegans genes
being predicted as orthologues of the H. contortus ESTs.
For the assayability requirement enzymes, ion channels
and GPCRs were identified using gene ontology (GO)
terms. GO terms for C. elegans genes were obtained from
the Amigo CVS database, using version 1.127 of
gene_association.wb.gz and included in the database
(retrieved Feb 2009 from http://cvsweb.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/). A custom software library,
named GORuby, was developed to classify C. elegans

Page 12 of 14

genes as enzymes if they had a GO identifier for catalytic
activity (GO:0003824) or one of its more specific subterms (e.g., GO:0016301 kinase activity). Similarly, a
script was written to identify ion channels and GPCRs genes that had a GO identifier for ion channel activity
(GO:0005216) or G-protein coupled receptor activity
(GO:0004930) or one of their more specific subterms
(e.g., GO:0001584 rhodopsin-like receptor activity). The
software was written in Ruby http://www.ruby-lang.org/
using the RSRuby library http://rubyforge.org/projects/
rsruby/ to communicate with R http://www.r-project.org
and the GO.db Bioconductor package http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/data/annotation/html/
GO.db.html. Using this approach, the reference list of GO
terms did not need to be loaded into a database but were
instead installed with GO.db. The software is available
under GPLv3 license at http://github.com/wwood/
goruby.
For the C. elegans genes that were predicted orthologues of the A. caninum and H. contortus ESTs we identified those that met the assayability requirement,
followed by identification of those we identified those
that were essential in C. elegans. This resulted in 421 C.
elegans genes in our final drug target list, 163 were orthologues common to both A. caninum and H. contortus, 124
were only present in H. contortus and 134 were only present in the larger dataset of A. caninum. All genes in the
list were enzymes or ion channels as no GPCRs met all
our selection criteria. A quantitative weighting scheme
was applied according to the present analysis of the relative importance of each feature in determining essentiality - absence of paralogues, presence of orthologue (with
no paralogues) in D. melanogaster M. musculus and/or S.
cerevisiae, presence of essential orthologue (with no paralogues) in D. melanogaster, M. musculus and/or S. cerevisiae.
Network connectivity data for C. elegans genes were
obtained from the Wormnet v1 (available at http://
www.functionalnet.org/wormnet/); [37] and integrated
into the database by mapping the genes in Wormnet to
the C. elegans OrthoMCL genes using the gene identifiers
from the Wormbase gff3 file. The "core" higher confidence set were those with linkages with LLS of â¥
0.405465108108 (ln1.5). For each C. elegans gene the LLS
for all linkages in the core network were added and this
resulted in 10,041 genes with a network score greater
than zero. This approach for the identification of drug
targets in parasitic nematodes is summarised in Figure 4.

Genes that correspond to validated anthelmintic drug targets are shown in
bold. All the genes in this list are predicted enzymes (by GO term) and have
a lethal RNAi phenotype in C. elegans. Targets were first prioritized by the
essentiality weighting assigned from the present study, then by network
connectivity score. "Present in mammals" is defined by having an orthologue in one or more of the mammalian species in the OrthoMCL 2.0 dataset (human, rat, mouse). Essential orthologue in yeast, drosophila or mouse:
? = orthologue (with no paralogues) associated with a lethal phenotype, ? =
orthologue (with no paralogues) that had only non-lethal phenotypes
recorded, ? = orthologue (with no paralogues) but no phenotype information was available. Presence of paralogues in C. elegans was determined
from the OrthoMCL grouping. Presence of paralogues in A. caninum and H.
contortus was determined as described in Materials and methods. The network connectivity score is the sum of all interaction scores (log-likelihood
scores) for the gene in the Wormnet core network [37].
