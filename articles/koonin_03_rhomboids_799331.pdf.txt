Conclusions: Although the near-universal presence of the rhomboid family in bacteria, archaea
and eukaryotes appears to suggest that this protein is part of the heritage of the last universal
common ancestor, phylogenetic tree analysis indicates a likely bacterial origin with subsequent
dissemination by horizontal gene transfer. This emphasizes the importance of explicit
phylogenetic analysis for the reconstruction of ancestral life forms. A hypothetical scenario for
the origin of intracellular membrane proteases from membrane transporters is proposed.

Results: Phylogenetic tree analysis carried out using several independent methods for tree
constructions and the corresponding statistical tests suggests that, despite its broad distribution
in all three superkingdoms, the rhomboid family was not present in the last universal common
ancestor of extant life forms. Instead, we propose that rhomboids evolved in bacteria and have
been acquired by archaea and eukaryotes through several independent horizontal gene transfers.
In eukaryotes, two distinct, ancient acquisitions apparently gave rise to the two major
subfamilies, typified by rhomboid and PARL (presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein),
respectively. Subsequent evolution of the rhomboid family in eukaryotes proceeded by multiple
duplications and functional diversification through the addition of extra transmembrane helices
and other domains in different orientations relative to the conserved core that harbors the
protease activity.

Background: The rhomboid family of polytopic membrane proteins shows a level of
evolutionary conservation unique among membrane proteins. They are present in nearly all the
sequenced genomes of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes, with the exception of several species
with small genomes. On the basis of experimental studies with the developmental regulator
rhomboid from Drosophila and the AarA protein from the bacterium Providencia stuartii, the
rhomboids are thought to be intramembrane serine proteases whose signaling function is
conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Background
Polytopic transmembrane proteins are, in general, not particularly strongly conserved during evolution. Inspection of
the database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins
(COGs) [1] revealed only one family of such proteins that is
represented in most of the sequenced bacterial, archaeal and
eukaryotic genomes. The prototype of this family is the
rhomboid (RHO) protein from Drosophila melanogaster, a
developmental regulator involved in epidermal growth
factor (EGF)-dependent signaling pathways [2-4]. Not only
were homologs of rhomboid detected in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, but the pattern of sequence conservation in this
family appeared uncharacteristic of nonenzymatic membrane proteins, such as transporters [5,6]. Specifically,
several polar amino-acid residues are conserved in nearly all
members of the rhomboid family, suggesting the possibility
of an enzymatic activity. As three of these conserved residues
were histidines, it has been hypothesized that rhomboidfamily proteins could function as metal-dependent membrane proteases [5,6]. Recently, however, it has been shown
that RHO cleaves a transmembrane helix (TMH) in the
membrane-bound precursor of the TGF␣-like growth factor
Spitz, enabling the released Spitz to activate the EGF receptor, and that a conserved serine and a conserved histidine in
RHO are essential for this cleavage [7,8]. Thus, it appears
that rhomboid-family proteins are a distinct group of
intramembrane serine proteases. Altogether, the genome of
Drosophila encodes seven RHO paralogs (now designated
RHO1-7, with the original rhomboid becoming RHO-1), at
least three of which are involved in distinct EGF-dependent
pathways, apparently through proteolytic activation of
diverse ligands of the EGF receptor [9,10].
The newly discovered intramembrane proteolytic activity of
RHO places the rhomboid family within the framework of
regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), a new paradigm
of signal transduction, which appears to be prominent in all
forms of life [11,12]. Under RIP, signaling proteins undergo
site-specific proteolysis within TMH, resulting in the release
of active fragments, which are the actual effectors in signal
tranduction cascades. Until recently, the only characterized
cases of RIP in eukaryotes involved presenilin-1, an aspartyl
protease, which cleaves a transmembrane helix in type-1
membrane proteins such as amyloid ␤-precursor protein
(A␤PP), Notch and Ire1 [13], and the metalloprotease S2P,
which cleaves a TMH in a type-2 transmembrane protein,
the sterol-dependent transcription factor SREBP [11].
Notably, S2P has highly conserved bacterial homologs, and
the protease domain of presenilins also might be homologous to bacterial and archaeal type IV prepilin peptidases,
although, in this case, the sequence similarity is low [14,15].
In the case of the rhomboid family, the existence of
homologs of RHO in most prokaryotes is particularly
remarkable because animal RHO proteins are involved in
signaling pathways that are not found outside metazoa,

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/3/R19

which seems to make functional conservation in prokaryotes
a remote possibility. The only prokaryotic protein of the
rhomboid family that has been characterized experimentally
in considerable detail is AarA from the bacterium Providencia stuartii [16,17]. This protein is involved in the export of a
quorum-sensing peptide, a function that, in physiological
terms, resembles that of RHO, although the signaling molecules, other than RHO and AarA, are obviously unrelated
[18]. In a striking recent development, two independent
research groups have shown that several bacterial rhomboid-family proteins, including AarA, can cleave the EGF
receptor ligands (Spitz, Keren and Gurken) that are normally cleaved by RHO paralogs [19,20]. The cleavage
depended on the conserved serine and histidine residues
[19] and, moreover, transgenic flies that expressed AarA
developed a phenotype indistinguishable from that induced
by overexpression of RHO, whereas RHO could substitute
for AarA in Providencia stuartii [20]. These unexpected
findings demonstrated the conservation of a RIP mechanism
producing extracellular signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotic rhomboid family proteins seem to show
considerable functional variability; in particular, cross-talk
might exist between different RIP pathways. A distinct representative of the rhomboid family has been shown to physically interact with presinilins 1 and 2, and was accordingly
named presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL)
[6]. The yeast ortholog of PARL has been suggested to participate in the processing of cytochrome c peroxidase precursor during its import into the mitochondrion [21].
The near ubiquity of the rhomboid family among bacteria,
archaea and eukaryotes, along with the remarkable functional conservation, suggests that a signaling mechanism
mediated by rhomboids might have functioned already in
the last common ancestor of all extant life forms, with subsequent loss in several lineages. To address this possibility,
we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the rhomboid family.

Results and discussion
Sequence and structural features and phyletic
distribution of the rhomboid family
Although the sequence similarity between eukaryotic and
prokaryotic rhomboid family proteins is relatively low
(around 10-15% identity in the conserved region), the entire
superfamily could be retrieved from the protein sequence
databases within three iterations of the PSI-BLAST program
with a high statistical significance and without any false positives. The conserved core of the rhomboid family consists of
six conserved TMHs (Figure 1). The predicted catalytic
serine is located in TMH5, whereas the predicted catalytic
histidine is in TMH7; TMH3 contains two additional histidines and an asparagine, which are conserved in the great
majority of the rhomboid-family proteins (Figure 1). The
roles of these conserved residues are not known, but, given

When examining the multiple alignment of the rhomboid
superfamily proteins, we noticed that several eukaryotic
members appear to be inactivated proteases, as indicated by
the loss of the predicted catalytic serine or histidine (Figure 1,
and data not shown); these inactivated forms could be regulators of active rhomboid proteases. Several other proteins lack
one or more of the conserved residues in TMH3; it remains
unclear whether or not these are active proteases.

Phylogeny and evolutionary history of the rhomboid
family

Bacterial and archaeal members of the rhomboid superfamily contain six TMH, whereas the eukaryotic members typically have an additional seventh TMH, which may be
attached to the core either from the amino terminus or from
the carboxyl terminus as discussed below.

reports

The phyletic distribution pattern of the rhomboid family
shows that this intramembrane protease is extremely
common in all three kingdoms of life, but is not necessarily
essential for cell function. Rhomboids are missing in the
microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a eukaryotic
intracellular parasite with a highly degraded genome, the
archaea Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and
Thermoplasma volcanium, and several bacterial species,
primarily parasites with small genomes but also species with
moderately sized genomes, such as Xylella fastidiosum (see
COG0705 at [22]). In two instances, a representative of the
rhomboid family is present in only one of a pair of relatively
close genomes (present in T. acidophilum but missing in
T. volcanium; present in the spirochete Treponema pallidum but missing in the related bacterium Borrelia
burgdorferi), which suggests relatively recent, repeated
losses of this gene. Most of the prokaryotic species have a
single gene coding for a rhomboid-family protein, although

The multiple alignment of the 6-TMH core of the rhomboid
family (Figure 1) was employed to construct a phylogenetic
tree using the least-squares algorithm with subsequent optimization using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (see
Materials and methods). Only the conserved regions including the TMH and short adjacent stretches shown in Figure 1
were used as the input for tree building, whereas the poorly
conserved intervening regions were omitted to avoid noise
from potentially misaligned residues (except for the
Bayesian analysis, which used the complete alignment; see
Materials and methods). The alignment used for phylogenetic reconstructions included 87 sequences and 149
aligned sites. The phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family
presents a complex and unexpected picture (Figure 2).
Neither the eukaryotic nor the archaeal subsets of the family
appear to form monophyletic clades. Instead, the eukaryotic
rhomboids are split between two major subfamilies, which
are positioned in the midst of different prokaryotic branches
(Figure 2). The first subfamily, which includes six of the
seven Drosophila rhomboids, clusters with a distinct
prokaryotic assemblage, consisting primarily of Gram-positive bacteria as well as a subset of archaea; this clade is
strongly supported by bootstrap analysis (Figure 2). The
proteins in this group of eukaryotic rhomboids, which we
designated the RHO subfamily, typically have an extra TMH
added carboxy-terminally to the 6-TMH core; some of these
proteins also contain EF-hand calcium-binding domains
amino-terminally of the core (Figure 2).

reviews

some have two or three paralogs (see COG0705 [22]); in
contrast, eukaryotes show expansion of the rhomboid
family, with seven members in Drosophila, and as many as
13 in Arabidopsis.

comment

the remarkable evolutionary conservation, it seems likely
that they also contribute to catalysis; indeed, it has been
shown that the conserved asparagine is required for the
cleavage of Spitz by RHO [7].

Koonin et al.

Drosophila RHO7 [6], resides within a large, heterogeneous
prokaryotic cluster (Figure 2). Within this subfamily, PARL
and its orthologs from other animals and from fungi have
distinct domain architecture, with an extra TMH added to
the amino terminus of the core, whereas the rest have only
the core (a carboxy-terminal TMH and a ubiquitin-associated domain are appended in one Arabidopsis protein;
Figure 2). Thus, the existence of two distinct subfamilies of
eukaryotic rhomboids is supported by features of domain
architectures that appear to comprise shared derived characters. Within these two major eukaryotic subfamilies, evolution apparently proceeded by both ancient and more
recent duplications. Several lineage-specific expansions of
paralogs [23] are noticeable, in insects, mammals and
plants (Figure 2).
Archaeal rhomboids are scattered over the phylogenetic tree,
with two major clusters and, in addition, three isolated proteins joining different bacterial branches (Figure 2). There is
no indication of an affinity between any of the archaeal and
eukaryotic rhomboids. Although many of the bacterial
rhomboids form phylogenetically coherent clusters corresponding to the established bacterial lineages, there are also
several clusters that have an odd composition, such as the
grouping of proteobacterial and Gram-positive species;
some of these clusters are well supported by bootstrap (see
clusters 1-4 in Figure 2).
Unexpected tree topologies often emerge due to artifacts of
phylogenetic analysis methods. This concern is particularly
serious for highly divergent families of membrane proteins,
such as the rhomboids, in which parallel amino-acid substitutions are likely. Therefore we investigated the phylogeny of
the rhomboid family in greater detail using several independent phylogenetic methods and the corresponding statistical
tests. First, we assessed the robustness of the topology of the
tree shown in Figure 2 using the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH)
test whereby the clade of interest is forced into various positions on the tree and the likelihoods of the resulting topologies are estimated. Specifically, the KH test was used to
evaluate two alternative topologies, in which the RHO and
PARL subfamilies formed a clade, and two topologies, in
which the RHO subfamily formed a clade with archaeal
rhomboids (Figure 2 and Table 1). Each of these alternative
topologies had a significantly lower likelihood than the original topology shown in Figure 2 (see Table 1).

§Bootstrap probability of the given tree calculated using the RELL method
(resampling of estimated log-likelihoods).

In addition, a tree of the rhomboid family was constructed
using the Bayesian inference method, which has recently
become a practical alternative to the more traditional
methods of phylogenetic analysis [24,25]. The tree produced
using the MRBAYES package [26] showed the same major
clades as the tree in Figure 2 (data not shown); moreover,
clustering of the RHO and PARL subfamilies of eukaryotic
rhomboids with the respective prokaryotic clades was supported by high posterior probabilities (Figure 2).
We also attempted to construct a phylogenetic tree of the
rhomboid family by using the maximum parsimony method
[27]. The resulting tree contained the same major clades as
the trees constructed using ML and MRBAYES; however,
the number of parsimony-informative sites was insufficient
to obtain high bootstrap support with this approach (data
not shown).
We also tested alternative phylogenies using neighborjoining search with constraint trees [27]. The alternative
phylogenies reflected two distinct hypotheses: first, clustering of the RHO and PARL subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids with the prokaryotic rhomboid families as suggested
by the tree topology in Figure 2; and second, monophyly of
the eukaryotic rhomboids (Figure 3). The phylogenies corresponding to these alternative hypotheses were compared to
the best phylogeny using three statistical tests (Table 2). The

Figure 3
Hypothesis-specific constraint tree for the rhomboid family. (a) Hypothesis 1, polyphyletic origin of eukaryotic rhomboids from prokaryotic progenitors.
The RHO and PARL subfamilies are denoted; the remaining clusters include prokaryotic rhomboids designated as in Figure 2 (with ‘a’ added to the GI
number). Within each cluster, the branches were collapsed into a multifurcation. (b) Hypothesis 2, monophyletic origin of eukaryotic rhomboids. All
eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences were collapsed into the two respective clusters. The trees are unrooted, although shown in a pseudorooted form.

hypothesis 1 tree was not significantly different from the best
tree under any of these tests whereas the hypothesis 2 tree
was significantly (p < 0.05) worse than the best tree according to each of the tests (Table 2).
The concordance of the results obtained with several independent methods for phylogenetic tree construction and statistical analysis specifically aimed at testing the alternative
hypothesis of monophyletic origin of eukaryotic rhomboids
shows strong support for the major aspects of the tree topology
in Figure 2 and, in particular, for the polyphyly of eukaryotic
rhomboids.
The phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family shown in
Figure 2 and supported by the additional tests described
above follows neither the ‘standard model’ scenario [28,29],
with the major split between the archaeo-eukaryotic and
bacterial lineages nor the ‘mitochondrial’ scenario, which
postulates acquisition of a gene by eukaryotes from the

pro-mitochondrial endosymbiont. Neither can this tree be
explained by postulating a small number of lineage-specific
gene losses. The parsimonious interpretation of the rhomboid family tree seems to be that the evolutionary history of
this family had been replete with horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) and lineage-specific gene loss events. In particular, in
spite of the presence of rhomboids in the majority of modern
life forms from all three primary superkingdoms, phylogenetic analysis suggests that this family has not been inherited
from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Instead,
the tree topology seems to indicate that this family emerged
in some bacterial lineage and afterwards had been widely
disseminated by HGT, and then lost in some lineages. Both
archaea and eukaryotes seem to have acquired rhomboids on
several independent occasions. In particular, at least two
HGT events seem to have contributed to the origin of
eukaryotic rhomboids, one of them yielding the RHO subfamily and the other one the PARL subfamily, with a possible
additional HGT in plants (Figures 2,3).

information

The multiple-HGT interpretation of the evolutionary history
of the rhomboid family, while supported by the above argument, seems, at least at first glance, distinctly counter-intuitive,
given that this family is nearly ubiquitous among extant life

interactions

An alternative to this multiple-HGT scenario is that LUCA
already had multiple, paralogous rhomboids, which evolved
by a series of ancient gene duplications, and the odd topology of the phylogenetic tree is due primarily to differential
loss of these ancient paralogs. Although this cannot be ruled
out formally, this hypothesis implies the existence of an
elaborate signaling system in LUCA and, accordingly, suggests that LUCA was a complex organism, which might have
had as many genes as modern bacteria. Theoretical analysis
of evolutionary scenarios constructed on the basis of the
phyletic patterns of COGs by applying the parsimony principle shows that the complexity of the inferred gene set of
LUCA critically depends on the relative rates of gene loss
and HGT at the early stages of evolution [32]. A complex

LUCA with around 2,000 genes is predicted only when one
assumes that the rate of gene loss is an order of magnitude
greater than the rate of HGT. However, explicit reconstruction
of the gene set of LUCA under the assumption of equal rates
of gene loss and HGT leads to a hypothetical genome that
consists of only around 600 genes but appears to be ‘compatible with life’, that is, it includes genes responsible for
most, if not all, essential cellular functions [32]. We currently believe that this is the most realistic, albeit inevitably
imprecise, reconstruction of LUCA’s gene set. With respect
to the rhomboid family and other families whose phylogenetic trees show similar patterns, this makes the multipleHGT interpretation the scenario of choice. Further
theoretical, comparative-genomic and experimental analyses
aimed at determining relative rates of gene loss and HGT
will help in a more objective assessment of the validity of
this argument.

refereed research

Given the broad phyletic representation of both subfamilies
of eukaryotic rhomboids, both the RHO subfamily and the
PARL subfamily must have been acquired through HGT at
an early stage of eukaryotic evolution, definitely before the
divergence of the major crown-group lineages. This early
epoch in eukaryotic evolution is thought to have been dominated by HGT from multiple bacterial symbionts [30,31].

forms. Indeed, when attempts are made to construct parsimonious evolutionary scenarios on the basis of phyletic
patterns alone [31-33], there is no chance that such a widespread family is not assigned to LUCA. It should be realized,
however, that these approaches are inherently probabilistic,
and extensive HGT can fool them [34]. For the rhomboid
family, the multiple-HGT mode of evolution seems to be particularly plausible. It seems likely that the ultimate ancestor
of the rhomboid family evolved from a nonenzymatic integral
membrane protein, probably a transporter that might have
been involved in an early primitive form of export of signaling
peptides in bacteria. The protease active center might have
evolved in such a transporter by chance emergence of the
suitable catalytic amino acids within two or three of the
TMHs (Figure 4). This would enable the transition from
simple transport to the RIP mode of controlled export of signaling molecules. Emergence of RIP could have conferred a
major selective advantage on the respective bacteria and
might have resulted in an evolutionary sweep whereby the
gene carrying this trait was repeatedly fixed, rather than
eliminated, after HGT. In terms of the evolution of sequence
itself, the requirements for the conservation of the protease
activity apparently ‘locked’ the rhomboid family in a regime
of relatively slow evolution, which ensures significant
sequence similarity between all family members (Figure 1).
The scenario of origin from non-catalytic transporters might
potentially apply to other integral membrane enzymes,
including intramembrane proteases involved in RIP, such as
presenilins and their homologs [14,15] and the archaeoeukaryotic signal peptide peptidase [35].

Conclusions
The rhomboid family might be the most widespread and
conserved group of integral membrane proteins. In and by
itself, this would suggest that this family is part of the gene
repertoire of LUCA. However, phylogenetic analysis suggests
a different scenario, one of emergence in a bacterial lineage
with subsequent multiple, independent HGT events and
gene losses. Although caution is due in the evolutionary
interpretation of phylogenetic trees for large families, particularly when membrane proteins with a relatively small
number of conserved positions, such as the rhomboids, are
involved, the multiple-HGT scenario seemed to be supported
by several methods of tree analysis and statistical tests.
Eukaryotes probably acquired their two major rhomboid
subfamilies, RHO and PARL, as the result of two independent, early HGT events. These events, which might have
introduced RIP as a means of intercellular communication,
could have been pivotal in the evolution of eukaryotic multicellularity along the lines discussed previously with
regard to the apparent bacterial origin of key components
of eukaryotic programmed cell death machinery [36]. Subsequent evolution of rhomboids in eukaryotes proceeded
by lineage-specific expansion of paralogs [23] followed by

A hypothetical scenario for the origin and dissemination of the rhomboid
family proteases. The figure schematically shows the proposed three
stages of evolution of the rhomboid family. In (a), the progenitor of the
rhomboid family functions as a transporter for a regulatory peptide in
some bacterial lineage. In (b), the catalytic site of the intramembrane
protease evolves, allowing the switch to RIP as the mechanism of the
regulatory peptide release. In (c), the emergence of RIP is followed by a
burst of HGT. R, regulatory peptide. The transmembrane helices of
rhomboid are designated as in Figure 1; their topology in the membrane is
based on that proposed in [7]. The catalytic histidine and serine are
shown and connected by a dotted line to indicate the proposed chargerelay system of the protease; possible ancillary catalytic residues are
not shown.

Phylogenetic analysis of the rhomboid family described
here carries a general message for studies aimed at the
reconstruction of ancestral life forms, particularly LUCA.
Although most of the (nearly) ubiquitous protein families
probably do derive from LUCA, explicit phylogenetic
analysis is required to ascertain this in each case.

Constraint trees for phylogenetic hypothesis testing were
generated using the TreeView program [46]. Constraint trees
were imported into PAUP* [27] and subjected to neighborjoining search to generate the phylogenies corresponding to
alternative hypotheses. These phylogenies were compared
using the KH [45], Templeton (Wilcoxon signed-ranks) [47]
and Winning-sites (sign) [48] tests implemented in PAUP*.

Phylogenetic trees were built using the least-squares method
[41] implemented in the FITCH program of the PHYLIP
package [42], with subsequent local rearrangement using the
PROTML program of the MOLPHY package to obtain the
maximum likelihood tree [43]. The reliability of the tree topology was assessed using the RELL (resampling of estimated loglikelihoods) bootstrap method of MOLPHY, with 10,000
replications [44]. Alternative placements of selected clades in
maximum-likelihood trees were compared by using the
rearrangement optimization method (Kishino-Hasegawa test)
as implemented in the ProtML program [43-45]. Maximum
parsimony trees were constructed using the heuristic search
option of PAUP* [27]. In addition, trees were constructed by
Bayesian inference using the Markov chain Monte Carlo
method as implemented in the MRBAYES package [24,26].
The complete alignment information, including columns with
gaps, was used for the MRBAYES analysis.

scoring matrix. Multiple alignments of protein sequences
were constructed using the ClustalW program [38] and
manually adjusted on the basis of the examination of PSIBLAST search outputs and the superposition of the predicted TMHs, which were identified using the programs
TMpred [39] and TMAP [40].
