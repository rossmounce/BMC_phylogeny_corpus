Evolution of Parallel Spindles Like genes in plants
and highlight of unique domain architecture#

Abstract
Background: Polyploidy has long been recognized as playing an important role in plant evolution. In flowering
plants, the major route of polyploidization is suggested to be sexual through gametes with somatic chromosome
number (2n). Parallel Spindle1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPS1) was recently demonstrated to control spindle
orientation in the 2nd division of meiosis and, when mutated, to induce 2n pollen. Interestingly, AtPS1 encodes a
protein with a FHA domain and PINc domain putatively involved in RNA decay (i.e. Nonsense Mediated mRNA
Decay). In potato, 2n pollen depending on parallel spindles was described long time ago but the responsible gene
has never been isolated. The knowledge derived from AtPS1 as well as the availability of genome sequences makes
it possible to isolate potato PSLike (PSL) and to highlight the evolution of PSL family in plants.
Results: Our work leading to the first characterization of PSLs in potato showed a greater PSL complexity in this
species respect to Arabidopsis thaliana. Indeed, a genomic PSL locus and seven cDNAs affected by alternative
splicing have been cloned. In addition, the occurrence of at least two other PSL loci in potato was suggested by
the sequence comparison of alternatively spliced transcripts.
Phylogenetic analysis on 20 Viridaeplantae showed the wide distribution of PSLs throughout the species and the
occurrence of multiple copies only in potato and soybean.
The analysis of PSLFHA and PSLPINc domains evidenced that, in terms of secondary structure, a major degree of
variability occurred in PINc domain respect to FHA. In terms of specific active sites, both domains showed
diversification among plant species that could be related to a functional diversification among PSL genes. In
addition, some specific active sites were strongly conserved among plants as supported by sequence alignment
and by evidence of negative selection evaluated as difference between non-synonymous and synonymous
mutations.
Conclusions: In this study, we highlight the existence of PSLs throughout Viridaeplantae, from mosses to higher
plants. We provide evidence that PSLs occur mostly as singleton in the analyzed genomes except in soybean and
potato both characterized by a recent whole genome duplication event. In potato, we suggest the candidate PSL
gene having a role in 2n pollen that should be deeply investigated.
We provide useful insight into evolutionary conservation of FHA and PINc domains throughout plant PSLs which
suggest a fundamental role of these domains for PSL function.

Background
Polyploidy represents the occurrence of more than two
complete sets of chromosomes in an organism and has
long been recognized as playing an especially important
role in plant evolution [1]. In flowering plants, polyploidy extent has been largely underestimated in terms

of its commonality. Indeed, major recent advances in
genomic analysis has revealed that almost all angiosperms have experienced at least one round of whole
genome duplication during their evolution.
The wide spreading of polyploidy throughout the
angiosperms can be related to their highly plastic genome structure, as inferred from their tolerance to
changes in chromosome number, genome size and epigenome [2]. Although information with regard to the
modes of polyploidization is limited, the major route of

polyploidization seems to be sexual through the functioning of gametes with somatic chromosome number
(2n gametes) [3]. Indeed, sexual polyploidization as
compared to asexual would explain better the success of
polyploid species in terms of higher fitness and more
genetic flexibility. The control of 2n gamete formation
has been generally attributed to the action of single
recessive genes. These genes exhibit incomplete penetrance and variable expression that is significantly influenced by genetic, environmental and developmental
factors [4]. The molecular mechanisms leading to 2n
gametes have only recently begun to be uncovered [5,6].
In particular, d’Erfurth and colleagues [7] isolated and
characterized Parallel Spindle1 gene in Arabidopsis
thaliana (AtPS1) that controls diploid pollen formation
through spindle orientation in the second division of
meiosis. The occurrence of parallel spindles at meiosis
II is a frequently found mechanism for 2n pollen formation that was described in potato many decades ago
[8,9]. In potato, ps mutants have been used for breeding
purposes in order to introgress beneficial traits from
diploid (2n = 2x = 24) relatives into cultivated strains
[10]. However, the gene ps leading to 2n pollen via parallel spindles was not isolated, so far.
Interestingly, AtPS1 is a protein which contains contemporarily a ForkHead Associated domain (FHA), and
a C-terminal PilT N-terminus domain (PINc). So far,
the FHA domain has been found in more than 5600 different proteins from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes
involved in several processes including cell cycle control,
DNA repair, protein degradation, transcription and premRNA splicing [11]. FHA domain was shown to recognize phosphothreonine-containing epitopes [12]. PINc
domain has been found in more than 3600 proteins in
all life kingdoms. PINc domain has RNA nuclease activity [13]. In eukaryotes, PINc-containing proteins, such
as human SMG6 and SMG5, were linked to NonsenseMediated mRNA Decay (NMD), that recognizes and
rapidly degrades mRNAs containing Premature translation Termination Codons (PTCs).
In this study, a sequence-homology-based strategy was
carried out to isolate PS gene from a diploid potato.
Through this approach, a genomic locus PS-Like (PSL)
and seven cDNAs affected by alternative splicing have
been cloned. The occurrence of at least two other PSL
loci is suggested in potato. In order to shed light on the
evolution and function of PSL genes in plants, a phylogenetic analysis of PSL genes was performed and FHA/
PINc domains were compared. As far as we know, this
is the first report about the isolation and characterization of PSL in a crop. We also demonstrate the conservation of this gene family throughout plants.

Results
Cloning and characterization of PSL genes in potato

Using the predicted protein sequence of AtPS1, two
ESTs were identified on DFCI Potato Gene Index
(http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi) named TC194262
and DN590600 corresponding to FHA and PINc
domains, respectively. The primers designed on the
above mentioned ESTs allowed to isolate in diploid
potato a 3 Kbp genomic clone (PSL1) lacking UTR
regions. In order to complete genomic sequence of
PSL1, by querying Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium Database (http://www.potatogenome.net/index.
php) and SOL Genomic Network (http://solgenomics.
net) we retrieved a 3 Kbp region of S. phureja v3 scaffold PGSC0003DMS000001829 (phuPSL) and a tomato
BAC clone AC211085.1 (SlPSL1) sharing 97% and 93%
of sequence identity with PSL1, respectively. Primers
designed on the tomato sequence were used to isolate a
potato 5.3 Kbp PSL1 genomic region spanning 2 Kbp
upstream of the start codon to about 200 bp downstream of the stop codon [GenBank:HQ418834]. In silico
gene prediction showed a structure of PSL1 composed
by six exons and five introns (Figure 1A) and a 2.4 Kbp
hypothetical PSL1 cDNA (PSL1_pred) with a GC content of 42% encoding a 92.5 kDa protein of 823 aminoacids (pPSL1_pred).
Given the meiotic function of AtPS1, potato PSL1
cDNA was isolated from pre-bolting buds. Seven different cDNAs ranging from 2.3 to 2.7 Kbp were isolated
including PSL1a of 2.4 Kbp corresponding to
PSL1_pred. The sequence alignment between cDNAs
and the genomic PSL1 indicated the presence of different groups of related PSL sequences encoded by more
than one locus (Figure 1A). In order to investigate the
relationship between the different PSL cDNAs, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis that suggested the existence of three different loci named PSL1, PSL2 and
PSL3 (Figure 1B). On the basis of sequence similarity,
we assigned PSL1a, PSL1b and PSL1c cDNAs [GenBank:
HQ418835, GenBank:HQ418836 and GenBank:
HQ418837] to genomic PSL1, PSL3a, PSL3b and PSL3c
cDNAs [GenBank:HQ418839, GenBank:HQ418840 and
GenBank:HQ418841] to PSL3 and the last cDNA to
PSL2 [GenBank:HQ418838]. Moreover, the distance
measured as the number of different nucleotides among
the seven cDNAs showed that PSL2 was more similar to
PSL3 than to PSL1 (Figure 1C). The nucleotide comparison between the predicted phuPSL cDNA and PSL1a,
PSL2 and PSL3c cDNAs showing a similarity of 98.5%,
99.1% and 99.6%, respectively, suggested that phuPSL
locus corresponds to PSL3 being the differences
explained by the different genetic background.

Based on the sequences of cloned PSL cDNAs, PSL1b
and PSL1c, PSL3a and PSL3b are alternative splicing
forms of PSL1 and PSL3 since they retained complete or
partial introns causing the formation of premature stop
codons (PTCs) (Figure 1A). Moreover, the cloned PSL2
cDNA showed a PTC caused by the retention of the
second intron. As a consequence, all the predicted PSL
proteins, except pPSL1a and pPSL3c, had truncated or
lacking PINc domain (Figure 1D).
In order to evaluate whether the alternative splicing
PSL variants were possible target of degradation through
NMD we calculated the distance between PTCs and the
successive exon-exon junction. Being this distance more
than 50-55 nt according to Nagi and Maquat [14] we
could consider PSL1b, PSL1c, PSL2, PSL3a and PSL3b as
target of NMD.
Phylogenetic analysis of PSL genes in sequenced
Viridaeplantae

In order to investigate the evolution of PSL family, a
phylogenetic analysis was performed by a search on

Interpro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro) for proteins
with both FHA and PINc domains. Interestingly, these
domains were contemporary present only in plants,
except for the multidrug-efflux transporter NAEGRDRAFT_78193 from the amoeboid Naegleria gruberi.
PSL1a sequence was blasted against the Phytozome v6
database (http://www.phytozome.net) that contains the
genomic sequences of 22 organisms and against the
SOL Genomics Network containing the tomato genome
assembly. Afterwards, 25 sequences of predicted PSL
proteins were collected from 19 different organisms
(Additional File 1), since Physcomitrella patens, Ricinus
communis, Volvox carteri, Zea mays and Chlamydomonas rehinardtii seemingly lack PSL genes. The sequences
were then aligned and the Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 2. The distribution of
PSLs is in agreement with the known phylogenetic relationships between species among dicots and monocots.
Moreover, one PSL locus was found in the analyzed
plant species, except for Glycine max. Indeed, four different PSL loci were identified in soybean and three of

potato, the alternative transcripts of soybean retain PINc
domain being the splicing sites located at the 3’-end of
mRNA (Figure 3).
Analysis of FHA and PINc secondary structure and active
sites in PSL proteins

In order to assess the conservation degree of PSLs, we
predicted and compared the secondary structure of FHA
and PINc domains using the SMART (http://smart.
embl-heidelberg.de) and PSIPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.
uk/psipred) tools. It is reported that FHA domain is 80100 aminoacid (aa) long folded into a 11-stranded beta
sandwich, which sometimes contains small helical insertions between the loops connecting the strands. However, in silico analysis of FHA displays only 8 betastrands (b-strands) out of 11 including the residues
involved in phosphopeptide recognition and stabilisation
of domain architecture [15]. Using the above mentioned
tools on yeast RAD53p [NCBI:6325104], a well characterized FHA containing protein [12], the identified FHA
region was 52 aa covering 6 beta-strands (data not
shown). As shown in Figure 4, the length of the predicted FHA region in our dataset was 53 aa except for
Brassica rapa (51 aa) and for Glycine max PSL2 (68 aa).
While the majority of FHA domains showed 6 betastrands, Brassica rapa FHA was predicted to be composed of 4 consecutive beta-strands followed by an
alpha helical region. The group of monocots, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor, as
well as dicot Glycine max (GmPSL1) showed a helical
insertion between the 2nd and the 3rd beta-strand. In
other species this helical insertion was predicted but at
a low confidence value as estimated by PSIPRED.

Afterward, we compared the active sites in yRAD53p
with those present in PSLFHA domains through the protein alignment showed in Figure 5. It can be observed
that glycine-5, arginine-6, serine-21 and histidine-24 in
FHA domain are perfectly conserved. The arginine-19
seems to be absent in all plant sequences. In the analyzed species, asparagine-60 showed a substitution with
histidine, characterized by a different polarity, except for
soybean PSL4 glutamine-60 and Brassica rapa that
seems to lack this site. Asparagine-66 is mostly substituted with the similar polar serine. Instead, AlPSL1,
AtPSL1, GmPSL3 and GmPSL4 exhibited arginine-66
with different polarity while BrPSL1 glutammine-66 and
MtPSL1 cysteine-66 both showing similar polarity of
asparagine.
The analysis of PINc domain in our dataset started
with the prediction of its secondary structure in human
SMG6 (hSMG6) [UniProt:Q86US8]. It is reported that
hSMG6PINc (hSMG6) is 182 aa folded into a 5-stranded
parallel beta-sheets that is highly twisted and alphahelices arranged on both sides of each beta-sheet for a
total of 6. Three aspartate residues are essential for
PINc activity in hSMG6, while a threonine or a serine
in the sequence (T/S)XD might be involved in catalytic
role on the basis of similarity with other PINc domains
[16,17]. SMART predicted a PINc domain of 152 aa
lacking the first and the last alpha-helices while
PSIPRED predicted 4 beta-sheets and 4 alpha helices in
hSMG6 (data not shown). In our dataset the PINc
domain ranged from a minimum of 123 aa in Cucumis
sativus to a maximum of 162 aa in Brachypodium distachyon (Figure 6). In our prediction, the number of
beta-sheets ranged from 3 in GmPSL3 and CsPSL1 to 9
in CpPSL1. The number of predicted alpha-helices ranged from 3 in CsPSL1, OsPSL1 and PSL3c to 7 in
BdPSL1 and CpPSL1. Afterward, we compared the
active residues of PINc in PSL proteins. The alignment
between PINc domain of PSL proteins and hSMG6 is
shown in Figure 7 (refer to Additional file 2: Alignment
of PSLPINc and hSMG6PINc residues to look at raw alignment). BrPSL1, SmPSL1 and PSL3c show the three
expected aspartate residues at positions 6, 194 and 233
of the alignment. SiPSL1 and SbPSL1 have a substitution of two aspartate residues with asparagine-6, glutammate-194. When a substitution occurs, the aspartate-194
is mostly replaced with glutammate-194 except for
CpPSL1 showing a different polarity residue (lysine-194)
and MgPSL1 showing an alyphatic residue (alanine-194).
The aspartate-233 is widely conserved except in
BdPSL1, OsPSL1 and SiPSL1 where it is substituted
with a serine-233. Most of the PSL proteins show a catalytic serine-231 in the described pattern SXD (where X
can be D, N, E or S in this study) instead of threonine231 in hSMG6, PtPSL1, SiPSL1, SmPSL1 and VvPSL1.

GmPSL3 and SbPSL1 are the only proteins lacking the
C-terminal extremity of PINc interrupting at leucine203 and lysine-227 respectively thus missing the catalytic threonine/serine-231 and the aspartate-233.
Selective pressure among amino acid sites in the PSL
family

In order to test for presence of positive selection at individual amino acid codons, the site specific models
implemented in DataMonkey 2010 webserver (http://
www.datamonkey.org) [18] were used. The Integrative
Selection Analysis of FEL, SLAC and FER alghoritms

evidenced no significant positive selected sites (dN-dS >
0). Conversely, 217 significant negative selected sites
(dN-dS < 0) were identified. The region between FHA
to PINc domains included few negative selected sites
which were mostly located near the functional domains.
The codons encoding the highly conserved active sites
glycine-5, arginine-6, serine-21 and histidine-24 in FHA
and aspartate-6, serine/threonine-231 and aspartate-233
in PINc were also subjected to negative selection
(Figure 8). These observations support the results
obtained through sequence alignment and evidence an
occurrence of negative pressure upon non-synonymous

mutations in PSL genes. In particular, the regions next
to the functional domains and the codons for active
sites were affected.

Discussion
In this work, we isolated PSL genes in a diploid potato
(2n = 2x = 24) and through in silico analysis we identified PSL in other plant species. The function of PSL in
plants can be inferred from Arabidopsis study on AtPS1
gene that appears responsible for the spindle orientation
at meiosis II playing a regulatory function, likely via
RNA decay [7].
In all the analysed species, except soybean and potato,
PSL loci appear as singleton behaving as resistant to
duplication. It is known that angiosperms are mostly
paleopolyploids [19], many having survived multiple
duplication events [20]. Analysis of genome sequences
shows that some genes duplicate and persist as multiple
copies after whole genome duplication (WGD) while

other genes are iteratively returned to singleton status.
Moreover, it seems that the singleton status is consistently restored for some functional gene groups like
those involved in DNA repair or signal transduction
[21]. The evolutive history of potato and soybean could
explain the expansion of PSL genes occurring in these
species that have experienced recent WGD. In cultivated
potato (2n = 4x = 48), WGD is reported to have
occurred about 10 million of years ago (mya) after the
divergence from Solanum lycopersicum [22]. In soybean
(2n = 2x = 40), which seems to be an ancient allopolyploid on the basis of two different centromeric repeat
classes [23], two rounds of WGD happened the latter
aging 10-15 mya [24,25]. In addition, the location of the
four soybean PSLs on different chromosomes reinforce
their origin from WGD rather than tandem duplications.
The evident feature of PSL proteins is the contemporary presence of FHA and PINc domains. FHA is
reported as a phosphothreonine (pT) binding domain

showing a 11 beta-sandwich secondary structure, also
containing small helical insertions between the betastrands [15]. The FHA active sites are usually located in
the loops connecting b3/b4, b4/b5 and b6/b7 strands.
RAD53pFHA arginine-70, serine-85 and asparagine-107
(corresponding to arginine-6, serine-21 and asparagine60 in Figure 5) are involved in the interaction with the
phosphopeptide backbone. Arginine-83 (corresponding
to arginine-19 in Figure 5) is the most important aminoacid for FHA binding specificity. Indeed, its conversion to glycine shifts the binding from pTXXD to
pTXXI peptides in RAD53pFHA interaction experiments
using surface plasmon resonance [15]. Glycine-69 and
histidine-88 (corresponding to glycine-5 and histidine24 in Figure 5) stabilize the architecture of the binding
site. The remaining conserved residue, asparagine-112
(corresponding to asparagine-65 in Figure 5), is remote
from the peptide binding site and serves to tether the
beta turn between b7/8 to b10 [12,15]. The comparison
of predicted secondary structure in our dataset showed
a wide conservation among plant species regarding the
number and the position of the beta-sheets and the presence of an helical insertion between the second and the
third beta-sheet as a characteristic feature of monocot
PSL proteins. The comparison of active sites showed
that two PSLFHA residues involved in pT binding as well
those involved in stabilisation of the architecture of the
binding site are fully conserved except for asparagine-65
that is replaced with a different polarity residue (arginine) in AlPSL1, AtPS1, GmPSL3 and GmPSL4 with
unknown possible effect on domain architecture. Moreover, as compared to RAD53pFHA, a conserved substitution in plants is a histidine instead of asparagine-60,
known to be important for the selectivity of binding of
phosphothreonine upon phosphoserine. The different
polarity between these two residues might suggest a
functional diversification of this active site. However, the
consequences of this substitution in PSLFHA domain in
terms of ligand binding cannot be easily predicted and
should be assessed by protein:protein interaction analysis. It is also intriguing the lack of arginine-19 in plants
raising the question of binding selectivity for plant
PSLFHA.

As regards PINc domain, we made reference to
human SMG6 PINc which has RNAse activity and it is
composed of alternating beta-sheets and alpha-helices. It
is reported that hSMG6 is involved in NMD together
with hSMG5 and hSMG7 [25]. In Arabidopsis, AtSMG7
was proved to be involved in NMD and to be required
for meiotic spindle organization in meiosis II [26]. As
reported by Glavan and colleagues [17], hSMG6 and
other PINc domains show three conserved aspartic residues at positions 1251, 1353 and 1392 (corresponding
to aspartate-6, -194 and -233 in Additional File 2)
involved in Mg 2+ binding. Threonine or serine
embedded in the motif (T/S) XD is proposed to be the
catalytic site on the basis of sequence alignment of PIN
domains and it is located at residue-1390 (corresponding to threonine-231 in Figure 7) in hSMG6PINc.
Our results showed differences of secondary structures
in PSLPINc domains even between phylogenetically close
organisms. Moreover, the typical alternation between
beta-sheets and alpha-helices does not seem to be
respected. In spite of these differences, the active sites
showed a wide conservation among plants. The aspartate-6 is conserved in all proteins except for SbPSL1
and SiPSL1 where an asparagine is present. This substitution maybe occurred after the divergence of BEP from
PACCAD clades among Poaceae given its absence in
Oryza sativa, Brachypodium distachyon and Selaginella
moellendorffii. The residue-194 showed the major degree
of variation among the species mostly characterized by
glutamate instead of aspartate. This substitution is not
related to phylogenesis, being glutamate present in both
monocots and dicots while aspartate-194 is shared by
the Brassicaceae BrPSL1, the Selaginellaceae SmPSL1
and the Solanaceae PSL3c. In Carica papaya, Mimulus
guttatus and Medicago truncatula the change involved
aminoacids with a different polarity such as lysine, alanine, and asparagine. The aspartate-233 is widely conserved among PSL proteins, except those of Poaceae
OsPSL1, SiPSL1 and BdPSL1 showing a serine-233,
likely a substitution occurred after the separation of
monocots from dicots. GmPSL3 and SbPSL1 lack this
residue due to PINc domain truncation at leucine-203
and lysine-227, respectively. As compared to hSMG6,

Cigliano et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:78
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/78

the majority of plants showed a serine instead of threonine-231 that is present only in PtPSL1, SiPSL1,
SmPSL1 and VvPSL1. This substitution should not compromise the PINc activity since serine and threonine are
the most represented residues at this position in PINc
domains of different organisms [16]. Based on the evidence that the three aspartate residues of PINc domain
are crucial for RNase activity, we can argue that PSLs
lacking one of these residues or showing aminoacid with
different polarity (BdPSL1, CpPSL1, CsPSL1, GmPSL3,
MgPSL1, MtPSL1, SbPSL1, SiPSL1, OsPSL1) have no
enzymatic activity. However, we cannot exclude that
they are partners of other proteins retaining RNAse
activity. Indeed, in human, it is known that hSMG5
lacking two aspartate residues respect to hSMG6 has no
enzymatic activity but the interaction between hSMG5
and hSMG7 led to a functional nuclease activity of
SMG7-SMG5 complex [17].
Functional analysis of Arabidopsis PS1 reinforced the
evidence that the defects in meiotic spindle orientation
in meiosis II led to the formation of diplopollen. Among
the analysed species, Manihot esculenta (2n = 2x = 36)
was reported to produce 2n pollen but the cytological
mechanisms underlying its formation were not deeply
investigated [27]. Since the predicted MePSL protein has
FHA and PINc active sites similar to those of other species, it is likely that the mechanism leading to 2n pollen
in Manihot esculenta does not involve parallel spindles.
In the potato genotype analysed in this study, neither
spindle defects nor 2n pollen have been reported [28].
In this genotype, we identified three PSL loci and
seven transcripts. Based on AtPS1 characterized by
FHA and PINc domains we can suspect that PSL1a
and PSL3c, carrying both domains, are functional proteins. In addition, it can be speculated that PSL1a that
evidences the same PINc active residues of AtPS1 is
the strongest candidate for the regulation of spindle
orientation in meiosis II. The landscape of alternative
splicing in potato PSL is not surprising since it has
been already observed for genes involved in Arabidopsis meiosis. For instance, AtSPO11-1, involved in double strand breaks (DSBs) required for meiotic
recombination, exhibits up to ten splicing forms showing PTCs [29]. As inferred for AtSPO11-1, PSLs are
possible target of NMD that could act as a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway for the proper expression of PSL. Alternative splicing was observed also in
Glycine max but the lack of PTCs exclude NMD regulation of PSL transcripts. Defining the ligands of FHA
and PINc domains and proving PSL as a component in
NMD are essential to link PSLs to plant evolution by
polyploidization via 2n gametes.

Conclusions
In this study, we show that PSLs are common genes
across Viridaeplantae. We provide evidence that PSLs
occur mostly as singleton in the analyzed genomes
except in soybean and potato both characterized by a
recent event of whole genome duplication. We provide
useful insight into evolutionary preservation of FHA and
PINc domains throughout plant PSL genes, suggesting a
fundamental role of these domains for PSL function.
FHA appeared to be highly conserved, while PINc secondary structure and specific active sites showed a less
conserved landscape, suggesting a functional diversification among PSL genes.
Methods
Plant material

A previously described [30] diploid clone of potato
(named T710) coming from hybridization between Solanum tuberosum haploid USW3304 (2n = 2x = 24) and
S. chacoense (2n = 2x = 24) has been used to isolate PSL
genes.
Potato PSL cloning and sequence analysis

Plant genomic DNA was isolated from leaves using the
DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN http://www1.qiagen.
com). Bacterial plasmid DNA was isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA from
prebolting buds was extracted using the RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and then treated with DNase I
(Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to remove residual genomic DNA. Primer pairs for cloning designed
with PRIMER3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/
primer3.cgi) are listed in Additional file 3: Primers used
in this study.
PSL1 genomic fragment was amplified by PCR with primers PS_F1 and PS_R1 and full sequence with primers
PS_F2 and PS_R2. The coding region of PSL transcripts
was amplified by RT-PCR by using SuperScriptTM III
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo- dT12-18
(Invitrogen). The cDNA was subjected to PCR with
PS_CF and PS_CR primers (Additional File 3). PCR products have been cloned into PCR2.1 with T/A Cloning
kit (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequencing was carried
out by Eurofins MWG Operon sequencing service
(Germany).
PSL1 gene structure and cDNA predictions were carried out using FGENESH online tool (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=fgenesh&group=programs&subgroup=gfind) selecting Tomato as organism.
In silico translation of cDNA sequences was carried out
using the Expasy Translation tool (http://www.expasy.
ch/tools/dna.html).

Identification of unannotated PSL genes

The PSL protein sequences were identified and collected
by TBLASTN [31] search against the Phytozome v6
database (http://www.phytozome.net/), SGN (SOL
Genomic Network, http://sgn.cornell.edu/) and Potato
Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC, http://potatogenomics.plantbiology.msu.edu/index.php?p=blast).
Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood
method

The PSL protein sequences were firstly aligned by
MUSCLE [32] using the default settings of MEGA5
[33]. The best model for Maximum Likelihood phylogeny analysis was chosen testing all the available models in ProtTest version 2.4 [34] with slow optimization
strategy and selecting the one with highest AICc value.
The evolutionary history was then inferred by using
the Maximum Likelihood method according to Jones et
al. w/freq. model [35]. The bootstrap consensus tree
was inferred from 100 replicates [36]. Initial tree(s) for
the heuristic search were obtained automatically as following. When the number of common sites is <100 or
less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the
maximum parsimony method was used, otherwise
BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. A
discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4 categories, +G,
parameter = 1.3900). The rate variation model allowed
for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I],
9.0566% sites). All ambiguous positions were removed
for each sequence pair. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5.

settings of MEGA5 [33] (Tamura et al., personal communication). To select the best substitution model we
used JmodelTest 0.1.1 [39,40] with default settings. The
GTR [41] model was selected as the best fitting as evidenced by AICc values.
The codon alignment was then uploaded on DataMonkey 2010 server [18,42] and dN-dS evaluated using
GTR as substitution model, and SLAC (default settings
except for Global dN/dS value = estimated with CI),
FEL and REL [43] alghoritms. Codons subjected to evolutive pressure were identified with Integrative Selection
Analysis selecting significance levels for SLAC p < 0.1,
FEL p < 0.1 and REL Bayes Factor < 50. Only codons
with a significant dN-dS value according to all the three
methods were reported.

PSL domain analysis

The locations of FHA and PINc domains within PSL
genes were detected using SMART [37]. Secondary
structure prediction was performed using domains
from PSL sequences as input into the PSIPRED secondary structure prediction server [38]. The program
MUSCLE [32] was used to do multiple sequence alignments of FHA and PINc domains in PSL proteins,
yRAD53p [NCBI:6325104] and hSMG6 [UniProt:
Q86US8]. Conservation of phosphothreonine-binding
residues in FHA and of RNAse activity residues in
PINc were determined by alignment with yRAD53p
and hSMG6, respectively.
Comparison of dN-dS values between PSL sequences

The coding sequences of PSLs were obtained from the
databases reported in Additional File 1. The terminal
codon was manually removed, then the codon alignment
was performed by MUSCLE [32] using the default
