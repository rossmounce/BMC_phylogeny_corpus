Abstract
Background: The dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum typically produces paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins,
which are known only from cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. While a PSP toxin gene cluster has recently been
characterized in cyanobacteria, the genetic background of PSP toxin production in dinoflagellates remains elusive.
Results: We constructed and analysed an expressed sequence tag (EST) library of A. minutum, which contained 15,703
read sequences yielding a total of 4,320 unique expressed clusters. Of these clusters, 72% combined the forward-and
reverse reads of at least one bacterial clone. This sequence resource was then used to construct an oligonucleotide
microarray. We analysed the expression of all clusters in three different strains. While the cyanobacterial PSP toxin
genes were not found among the A. minutum sequences, 192 genes were differentially expressed between toxic and
non-toxic strains.
Conclusions: Based on this study and on the lack of identified PSP synthesis genes in the two existent Alexandrium
tamarense EST libraries, we propose that the PSP toxin genes in dinoflagellates might be more different from their
cyanobacterial counterparts than would be expected in the case of a recent gene transfer. As a starting point to
identify possible PSP toxin-associated genes in dinoflagellates without relying on a priori sequence information, the
sequences only present in mRNA pools of the toxic strain can be seen as putative candidates involved in toxin
synthesis and regulation, or acclimation to intracellular PSP toxins.
Background
Alexandrium minutum is a bloom-forming toxic dinoflagellate typically capable of producing paralytic shellfish
poisoning (PSP) toxins. Occurring from northern Europe
and the Mediterranean to Asia, Australia and New Zealand, A. minutum poses a widespread threat to seafood
production and consumer health (for a review of biogeography and species boundaries see [1]). PSP is potentially fatal to both humans [2] and marine fauna,
particularly vertebrates [3,4]; human intoxications typically occur after ingestion of suspension-feeding bivalve
molluscs.
PSP toxins are tetrahydropurine neurotoxins, which
specifically bind to voltage-gated sodium channels of

nerves and muscle cells. The most well known representative, saxitoxin, is probably also the parent compound
[5], of which more than 20 naturally occurring derivatives
are known [6], including the gonyautoxins produced by
A. minutum. Several physiological or ecological functions
of PSP toxins have been considered (reviewed in [7]),
among others chemical defence [7], nitrogen storage [7],
activity as pheromones [8], and influences on the dinoflagellate-associated bacteria in the phycosphere [9]. Several
experimental studies link PSP toxicity in dinoflagellates
to deterring effects on some species of copepod grazers
[10,11], which can lead to a redirection of grazing pressure onto non-toxic phytoplankton species competing for
the same nutrient resources [12], but the interactions and
deterrence responses are highly species-specific and not
universal.

In addition to these effects, but independent of PSP
toxin content, several Alexandrium species including A.
minutum were shown to produce lytic substances which
affect both competing algae and unicellular predators
[13,14]. Both these factors potentially contribute to the
formation and maintenance of A. minutum blooms.
Analytical and physical-chemical methods can resolve
structures and provide basic biosynthetic pathways to
phycotoxins, but provide little direct evidence on specific
biosynthetic enzymes and regulatory functions [15].
Thus, a combined approach linked to genomics and proteomics is required to fully describe toxin biosynthesis
and regulation. In the case of PSP toxins in dinoflagellates, however, this approach is rather challenging, as
both the physiological regulation and evolutionary origin
of PSP toxins remain enigmatic.
Apart from marine dinoflagellates, comprising several
species of Alexandrium and a single species Pyrodinium
bahamense of a closely related genus, plus Gymnodinium
catenatum, which belongs to a very distantly related phylogenetic group (see [16,17]), the only confirmed PSP
toxin producers are predominantly freshwater cyanobacteria, including members of the genera Cylindrospermopsis, Anabaena, Lyngbya and Aphanizomenon. This
paraphyletic distribution was confirmed by several studies demonstrating that removal of bacteria from Alexandrium cultures did not eliminate toxin production (e.g.
[18-20]). Along with the lack of conclusive evidence that
toxigenesis could be definitively attributed to endosymbiotic bacteria within dinoflagellates, this supports the conclusion that the dinoflagellate genome is responsible for
PSP toxin production. As the inheritance of toxin composition follows a Mendelian segregation pattern [21], at
least the interconverting enzymes are almost certainly
encoded by nuclear genes. Since the early investigations
into the biosynthetic pathway of PSP toxins [22], the
standing hypothesis has been that this pathway is the
same in all PSP toxin-producing organisms, and that the
corresponding genes should be homologous. In one of
the most-cited papers on his model of the PSP toxin synthesis pathway, Shimizu [23] suggested that the unusual
distribution of the ability to produce PSP toxins might be
explained by a rare event of horizontal gene transfer from
bacteria to dinoflagellates.
A cyanobacterial PSP toxin gene cluster (sxt) has
recently been discovered in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 [24]. This cluster contains >35 kb of sequence
coding for 26 proteins; PSP toxin synthesis is reported to
be initiated with arginine, S-adenosylmethionine and
acetate by a new type of polyketide synthase. Similar clusters were found in other PSP toxin-producing cyanobacterial species [25,26], and further studies suggested that
at least parts of this cluster have been frequently laterally
transferred between different cyanobacterial genera [27].

Nevertheless conclusive evidence of the homology of PSP
toxin synthesis in dinoflagellates and prokaryotes is
pending.
Attempts to find Alexandrium genes associated with
PSP toxin production have remained inconclusive. While
the physiological and circadian time-frame of PSP toxin
production has been elucidated in A. fundyense [28], further experiments based on this information have failed to
identify candidate genes directly linked to PSP toxins
[29]. Subtractive hybridization of cDNA was used to
identify toxin-associated genetic differences between
toxic and non-toxic subclones of one Alexandrium tamarense parental strain [30]. The differential gene fragments, however, did not seem to be directly related to
toxins, as shown by polymorphism analysis of other subclones.
Genomic studies in dinoflagellates have long been hampered by their huge genomes, particularly of free-living
species - up to 200 pg nuclear DNA cell-1 in Prorocentrum
micans, which corresponds to roughly 75 times the DNA
content of the human genome [31] - and their unusual
nuclear composition and organisation (reviewed by [32]).
Although most dinoflagellates are functionally haploid in
the vegetative stage, the nucleus may contain up to 270
chromosomes [32]. The dinoflagellate nucleus typically
lacks histones and nucleosomes and instead contains low
abundances of basic histone-like proteins. The chromosomes are permanently condensed, and up to 70% of the
nucleotides contain modified or rare bases. This unusual
organisation was further illustrated in a low-redundancy
sequence survey of the Heterocapsa triquetra genome
[33]; about 90% of the examined sequences were apparently random, non-repetitive DNA, whereas the highest
number of recognizable sequences consisted of repeats,
transposons or virus-specific protein sequences. These
features pose major difficulties in directly studying the
gene content of dinoflagellates, and while some sequencing initiatives are underway, no completely sequenced
genome is yet available.
Most of the complexities associated with examining the
dinoflagellate genomes can be circumvented by conducting genomic studies at the transcriptomic level [34]. In
the last few years, a number of expressed sequence tag
(EST) studies has been published (e.g. [35-40]), many of
which led to further microarray-based studies of gene
expression (e.g. [41,42]). In dinoflagellate species producing polyketide toxins of the spirolide and brevetoxin
groups, search strategies based on EST- or cDNA-libraries were successful in identifying a range of polyketide
synthases (PKS) [37,43]. These studies made use of the
high degree of sequence conservation in several PKS
domains (reviewed in [44]), but which of these genes are
responsible for production of the corresponding toxins
has not yet been established.

As well as being a member of the most well-studied
dinoflagellate genus of PSP toxin-producers, for which a
wealth of physiological and biosynthetic information on
toxin production is available, A. minutum is an appropriate model for toxin production studies because of its simple toxin profile. Most A. minutum strains produce
mainly or exclusively gonyautoxins and ab initio both
toxic and non-toxic strains are available for comparative
studies ([14,45]). We constructed a normalised EST
library of A. minutum to search for PSP toxin-related
genes in this dinoflagellate. To search for toxin-related or
toxicity-influencing genes not readily apparent from EST
library annotation, we used a microarray approach to
compare the transcriptomes of toxic and non-toxic A.
minutum clones and thus identified differences in gene
expression potentially linked to toxin synthesis and/or
regulation.

achieve N-limitation at a reasonably high cell concentration, NO3-, but not 36 μmol L-1 NH4+, was omitted from
the culture medium. For P-limitation, cultures were
grown in medium to which no phosphate was added.
Light limitation of growth was attained under a PFD of 60
μmol m-2 s-1, and for high and low temperature conditions, cultures were grown at 31.5°C and 13°C, respectively. The cultures were harvested at 7 time points
through the photocycle to capture genes expressed at
specific time points, and at different stages of the growth
curve.
Cells were harvested by filtration upon an 8 μm poresized filters and rinsed with filter-sterilized seawater.
Cells were immediately transferred into TriReagent
(Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), or filters were
quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later processing.
EST library construction and automated annotation

Methods
General culture conditions for Alexandrium minutum

Unless noted differently, A. minutum cultures (origin:
Gulf of Trieste, Italy) were grown at 20°C in modified Kmedium [46] containing 440 μmol L-1 NO3-, 36 μmol L-1
NH4+, 25 μmol L-1 PO42-, 10 nmol L-1 SeO32-, 1000 μmol
L-1 Trizma-Base (pH 8.3), K trace-metal solution and f/2
vitamin solution [47,48]. Illumination was provided from
daylight fluorescent lamps at a photon flux density (PFD)
of 200 μmol m-2 s-1 on a 16:8-hour light:dark photocycle.
All experimental (but not stock) cultures were grown
under antibiotic treatment (50 μg mL-1 ampicillin, 33 μg
mL-1 gentamicin, 10 μg mL-1 ciprofloxacin, 1.13 μg mL-1
chloramphenicol and 0.025 μg mL-1 streptomycin sulphate) using sterile handling techniques to minimize bacterial influence. To avoid any bias introduced by the
antibiotics, treatment was stopped at inoculation of the
cultures for toxin content and gene expression experiments, but aseptic handling techniques were maintained.
Culture and harvest of A. minutum for EST library
construction

A. minutum clone AL3T was grown in 800 mL culture
bottles for EST library construction. In order to include
genes expressed under different physiological conditions,
several alternative treatments were applied. Standard
condition cultures were grown as detailed above. Two
standard condition cultures were subjected to shock
treatments (complete darkness or 5°C) for 24 h prior to
harvesting. Cultures treated in high salinity (medium
supplemented with 15 g L-1 NaCl) and low salinity
(medium prepared with 1/3 aged seawater and 2/3
deionised water) were preconditioned in these media for
ca. 40 cell cycles (about 40 days, over several sub-culturing transfers) before inoculation of the final cultures. To

RNA was extracted using the Sigma TriReagent protocol,
following cell lysis by 10 min incubation at 60°C in TriReagent, aided by repeated vortexing with glass beads
included in the sample tube. The resulting RNA pellet
was dissolved in 100 μL RNAse-free water (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). RNA cleanup including on-column
DNA digestion (27.3 u DNase per sample) followed the
protocol supplied with the Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA was
eluted with 40 μL RNase-free water (Qiagen). When necessary, an additional cleanup and concentration step was
applied using Qiagen MinElute or Microcon Ultracel
YM-30 columns. RNA purity and quantity were determined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (PeqLab,
Erlangen, Germany), and integrity and absence of DNA
contamination was assessed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Böblingen, Germany).
Total RNA from harvested cells was pooled as equal
amounts from each treatment for construction of a normalised cDNA library. The library was constructed and
transformed into electrocompetent Escherichia coli cells
by Vertis Biotechnologie AG (Freising-Weihenstephan,
Germany).
Colonies were picked, and the DNA was extracted by
magnetic beads on a robot platform (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Plasmid inserts were sequenced from both
sides using Big Dye Chemistry (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany) and separated on an ABI Prism
3700 × l sequencing (Applied Biosystems) platform.
Resulting high quality sequence reads (15,703) were clustered with a sequential assembly using decreasing identity thresholds (gap assembler) to avoid misassemblies
due to polyA tails. Contigs were searched for potential
alternative splicing by checking alignments of reads in
clusters for the presence of gaps in at least one read compared to the consensus sequence of the cluster. Alternative splicing was assumed if the following criteria were

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:248

fulfilled: 1) the manually inspected difference between
the transcripts was at least two bases, and 2) no other
polymorphisms were present between the alternative
transcripts, thereby indicating transcription from the
same locus.
Contig sequences were loaded into SAMS (Sequence
Analysis and Management System, Center for Biotechnology, Bielefeld University) for automated annotation
based on BLAST comparisons against KEGG, KOG,
SwissProt, InterPro and the Genbank nt and nr databases.
Sequences were subject to open reading frame (ORF)
prediction according to [49], and predicted ORFs were
submitted to Pfam, TMHMM-2.0 and SignalP 3.0. To further assist manual annotation, all contigs were analyzed
for phylogenetic association to SwissProt sequences using
PhyloGena [50]. Annotations of 192 sequences identified
from the microarray results as differentially expressed in
toxic and non-toxic strains were checked manually.
In-silico search for known sxt-related genes

The assembled A. minutum EST library was screened for
contigs showing similarities to any of the publicly available (as of 13.1.2009) sxt-related cyanobacterial
sequences in the NCBI protein database using translated
protein - nucleotide (blastx) BLAST [51]. Contigs and
cyanobacterial sequences producing significant hits (evalue < 0.001) were subjected to a PhyloGena analysis in
"top10select" mode to identify the most similar SwissProt
sequences and to obtain the most likely protein translation of the EST contig sequence. BLAST-identified pairs
of sxt proteins and translated A. minutum contigs were
combined with the full-length versions of their respective
SwissProt hits, and, in the cases of Amin_93i12r and
Amin_73a05f, additionally with the 20 most similar nr
sequences as identified by BLAST. These sequence sets
were used for phylogenetic analysis following the method
detailed in [44] with modifications. Briefly, alignments
were generated from kalign, and alignment blocks out of
the span of both the A. minutum and the sxt-related
sequence were manually deleted with the CLC sequence
viewer version 6.0.1 [52]. Phylogenetic trees were calculated with Phyml_3.0.1 [53] using the subtree pruning
and regrafting (SPR) method with a BioNJ starting tree,
and the LG model of amino-acid substitution [54] with
gamma distribution parameters estimated from the data
with four discretised substitution rate classes, the middle
of which was estimated as the median. The same settings
were used for a 100-replicate Bootstrap analysis.
Microarray design

Oligonucleotide probes covering both forward and
reverse reading directions were designed in collaboration
with CeBiTec, Bielefeld University. After a first test
hybridisation of a microarray containing 22,264 oligos (2-

Page 4 of 18

14 per contig, mean 5.2), the probe set was reduced to the
8,609 best-performing oligos. Following a test for congruence with the contig ORF direction as determined by
either manual annotation or a combination of PolyA-Tail
identification and the direction of the best SwissProt hit,
the best probe was chosen according to performance in
triplicate hybridization with standard-strain (AL3T)
RNA from 9 different physiological conditions. For some
contigs without available manual annotation which could
not be automatically assigned an ORF direction, two
probes targeting both possible mRNA orientations were
retained; these are marked as correct or false during manual annotation.
Toxin analysis

PSP toxins were extracted following a previously
described method [6]. After centrifugation (3,000 × g,
4°C), pellets were suspended in 0.03 N acetic acid and
homogenized in FastPrep tubes (Thermo Savant, Illkirch,
France) containing 0.9 g of lysing matrix D by reciprocal
shaking in a Bio101 FastPrep instrument (Thermo
Savant) at maximum speed (6.5 m s-1) for 45 s. Cell debris
was removed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g at 4°C for 15
min. The supernatant (400 μL) was filtered through a 0.45
mm pore-size spin-filter (Millipore Ultrafree, Eschborn,
Germany) by centrifugation for 30 s at 800 × g.
Analytical Reagents

Water was deionised and purified (Milli-Q, Millipore,
Eschborn, Germany) to 18 MΩ cm-1 quality or better.
Formic acid (90%, p.a.), acetic acid (p.a.) and ammonium
formate (p.a.) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany), nitric acid (p.a.) and phosphoric acid (p.a.)
were from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany), periodic
acid, 1-heptanesulphonic acid, 1-octanesulphonic acid
and diammonium hydrogenphosphate were from Sigma
(Deisenhofen, Germany). The solvents, methanol, tetrahydrofurane (THF) and acetonitrile, were high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany).
Standard solutions of PSP toxins (saxitoxin, STX; neosaxitoxin, NEO; decarbamoyl saxitoxin, dcSTX; gonyautoxins 1&4, GTX1/GTX4; gonyautoxins 2&3 GTX2/
GTX3; decarbamoyl gonyautoxins 2&3, dcGTX2/
dcGTX3; and B1) were purchased from the Certified Reference Material Programme of the Institute for Marine
Biosciences, National Research Council, Halifax, NS,
Canada.
Analytical Methods

Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection
(LC-FD) The LC-FD analysis was carried out as previously described in detail [6]. Briefly, PSP toxins were separated by ion-pair chromatography on a ODS reversephase analytical column and detected fluorometrically
after post-column derivatization. PSP toxins were

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/248

resolved with two eluants. The first eluant for gonyautoxins and N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins consisted of 6 mM 1octanesulphonic acid and 6 mM 1-heptanesulfonic acid
in 40 mM ammonium phosphate, adjusted to pH 7.0 with
dilute phosphoric acid. Components of the saxitoxin
group were separated by 0.75% THF and 13 mM 1octanesulphonic acid in 50 mM phosphoric acid,
adjusted to pH 6.9 with ammonium hydroxide, and 15%
(v/v) acetonitrile and 1.5% THF. The flow rate was 1 mL
min-1with the following gradient: initial condition: 100%
eluant A and isocratic elution until 15 min, gradient elution to 100% eluant B until 16 min, followed by isocratic
elution with 100% eluant B until 35 min.
Post-column derivatization was performed with 10 mM
of periodic acid in 550 mM ammonium hydroxide at a
flow rate of 0.4 mL min-1 in a reaction coil set at 50°C.
Subsequently, the eluate was continuously acidified with
0.75 N nitric acid at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min-1. Toxins
were detected by a dual monochromator fluorescence
detector (λex 333 nm; λem 395 nm). PSP toxin concentrations were determined by external calibration.
Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) In order to confirm the LCFD results using an independent method, mass spectral
experiments were performed on an ABI-SCIEX-4000 Q
Trap (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany), triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboSpray® interface coupled to an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) model 1100 LC. The LC equipment included a
solvent reservoir, on-line degasser (G1379A), binary
pump (G1311A), refrigerated autosampler (G1329A/
G1330B), and temperature-controlled column oven
(G1316A).
Toxin separation (5 μL of sample injected) for mass
spectrometric analyses was performed by a hydrophilic
interaction liquid ion-chromatography (HILIC) method
[55] with slight modifications. The analytical column
(150 × 4.6 mm) was packed with 5 μm ZIC-HILIC, 200 Å,
(SeQuant, Haltern, Germany) and maintained at 35°C. A
pre-column with the same packing material was also
used. The flow rate was 0.7 mL min-1 and gradient elution
was performed with two eluants. Eluant A was 2 mM formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate in 20% water and
80% acetonitrile; eluant B was 10 mM formic acid and 10
mM ammonium formate in water. The gradient was as
follows: 20 min column equilibration with 20% eluant B,
linear gradient to 35% B until 5 min, then linear gradient
to 40% B until 10 min, then linear gradient to 45% eluant
B until 20 min, followed by isocratic elution with 45% eluant B until 24 min and finally return to initial 20% eluant
B until 25 min.
Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments
were carried out in positive ion mode by selecting the following transitions (precursor ion > fragment ion): m/z

412 > 332 and m/z 412> 314 (for GTX1/GTX4 and C3/
C4), m/z 396> 316 and m/z 396> 298 (for GTX2/GTX3,
C1/C2 and B2), m/z 380> 300 and m/z 380> 282 (for B1),
m/z 353> 273 (for dcGTX2/dcGTX3), m/z 369> 289 (for
dcGTX1/dcGTX4), m/z 300> 282 and m/z 300> 204 (for
STX), m/z 316> 298 and m/z 316>196 (for NEO), m/z
257>196 and m/z 257> 156 (for dcSTX) and m/z 273>
255 (for dcNEO). Dwell times of 50-150 ms were used for
each transition with the following source parameters:
curtain gas: 30 psi, temperature: 650°C, ion-spray voltage:
5000 V, gas 1 and 2: 70 psi, interface heater: on, collision
gas: high, declustering potential: 66 V, entrance potential
10 V, collision energy: 30 V, and collision cell exit potential: 12 V.
Determination of harvesting time for gene expression
analysis

To determine the optimal point of the light-dark cycle at
which putative toxin genes are most likely to be
expressed, triplicate A. minutum AL3T cultures were
grown in 5 L glass flasks with constant gentle aeration
under controlled standard conditions, as previously
described. Cultures were sampled for cell counts and
toxin analysis at the onset of dark phase, at the onset of
light phase, and at 2-h intervals until the beginning of the
next dark phase, with a sterile tube-sampling system
[56,57]. Duplicate samples for toxin analysis (125 - 200
mL of culture depending on harvesting time) were harvested by centrifugation for toxin analysis by LC-FD.
Inter-clonal comparisons of gene expression

Gene expression was compared between toxigenic (AL3T
and AL9T) and naturally non-toxic (AL1T) A. minutum
clonal strains originating from the same geographical
population in the Gulf of Trieste, Italy (isolated by A.
Beran; see [58]). Bacteria-reduced triplicate cultures were
grown under the control conditions as stated above. Culture growth was monitored by daily manual cell counts of
samples fixed in Lugol's iodine solution.
The toxin content of duplicate samples containing at
least 2 × 106 AL3T and AL9T cells and non-duplicate
samples containing at least 4 × 106 AL1T cells were analyzed by LC-FD. To confirm the toxin identification of
specific PSP toxin analogues by LC-MS, samples of additional parallel cultures were combined into pellets containing 8.5 × 106 to 1.1 × 107 cells.
Samples for RNA extraction were taken during exponential growth phase, at 10-11 h (Sampling Time 1, ST1)
and at 6-7 h (Sampling Time 2, ST2) after onset of light
phase. Total RNA (500 ng sample-1) was extracted as
described herein, then amplified and labelled with a Low
RNA Input Linear Amplification kit (Agilent, Waldbronn,
Germany). The Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit protocol was followed for synthesis of Cy3- and

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:248

Cy5-labelled cRNA and microarray hybridisation.
Microarrays were scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner, and raw data were extracted with the Agilent Feature
Extraction Software version 9.1.3.1 (FE). Array quality
was monitored with the Agilent QC Tool (v1.0) with the
metric set GE2_QCMT_Feb07.
Pre-processed data were subjected to SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays [59]) as implemented in
MeV 4.0 [60], and SAM-based q-values [61] were calculated. Probes with a q-value of <1% were considered to
indicate differential expression of the corresponding
genes if the mean fold change of the sample triplicate was
at least 1.5. To minimise the influence of physiological
differences between the strains that were not related to
the capacity for toxin production, only genes identified as
significantly higher or significantly less expressed in both
toxic strains at both sampling time-points were designated as "higher expressed" or "less expressed" in toxic
strains.
Samples were clustered by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCL) support trees as implemented in MeV 4.2.
Trees calculated with different distance measures
(Euclidean, Manhattan and Covariance values) and different distance metrics (average, complete and single linkage) were compared. Node confidence was tested by 1000
Bootstrap replicates.
To test reliability of the microarray, expression levels of
six genes were evaluated by qPCR. Four of these genes
had been identified as significantly higher expressed in
the toxic strains, the other two as significantly higher
expressed in the non-toxic strain. The qPCR was carried
out as described [62] with the lepidopteran genes MA
and NSP as an artificial internal reference. Primers for
qPCR were designed with PrimerExpress 3.0 (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and synthesized by
Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). Standard
curves using cDNA plasmids corresponding to target
sequence ESTs were plotted to test the primer pairs for
consistent efficiency at different concentrations. These
plasmids were amplified by M13-primed PCR; qPCR
primers were tested on dilution series of plasmid PCR
products spanning at least 8 orders of magnitude. The
qPCR reaction was based on the PowerSybrGreen PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a 7000 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Prior to cDNA synthesis the samples were spiked with
the artificial internal control RNAs MA (1 ng reaction-1)
and NSP (1 pg reaction-1). Equal amounts of RNA from
all strains were processed in parallel. All qPCR reactions
based upon the same primer-set were run on the same
plate, and reaction efficiencies were compared with MA
and NSP-specific primers. To test for contamination with
genomic DNA, negative controls consisted of full reac-

all samples. Thresholds were determined manually for
each primer set. Relative expression levels were recorded
as the cycle threshold value (Ct).
PCR

To test for the presence of the cyanobacterial toxin gene
cluster in A. minutum, amplification of the cyanobacterial genes from genomic DNA isolated from AL3T cultures grown under antibiotic treatment was attempted.
The 14 primer pairs designed against the PSP toxin ORF
in the Raphidiopsis brookii genome (K. Stucken et al.,
unpublished data; Additional file 1) were tested. A primer
pair targeting the D1/D2 [63] region of the large ribosomal subunit was used as positive control, primers
against the bacterial 16S ribosomal subunit controlled for
bacterial contamination of the DNA.
Reactions were scaled to 30 μL and contained 20 ng
genomic DNA, 0.2 mM forward and reverse primers, 0.1
mM dNTPs, 0.6 units of U of HotMaster Taq DNA polymerase (Eppendorf ) and HotMasterTaq buffer 1×
(Eppendorf ). Gradient PCR was employed to try each
primer at 6 different annealing temperatures spanning a
range of approximately 9°C. As the primers were of different melting temperatures, three different temperature
spans between 46 and 58°C were used. Cycling conditions
were based on those optimal for these primers (Additional file 1): initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 20
cycles with denaturation 94°C (20 s), annealing for 45 s,
extension at 70°C (30 s), and a final extension step of 10
min at 70°C. PCR products were visualized after agarose
gel electrophoresis.

Results
Characterisation of the EST Library

The cDNA fragments sequenced from both sides yielded
15,703 read sequences clustered into 4,320 contigs. Of
these contigs, 3,112 (72%) combined the forward- and
reverse reads of at least one bacterial clone, and thus can
be considered full-length insert sequences, but might not
represent the total length of the corresponding mRNA.
Among contigs, 1,998 contained reads from more than
one cDNA insert. Contig length varied between 100 and
2185 bp, with a mean of 791 ± 240 bp (mean ± standard
deviation). The mean GC content of contigs was 56.10 ±
4.67% (Table 1).
The examination of alignments of reads in the clusters
for potential alternative splicing identified different splice
variants in ca. 9% of the contigs containing reads from
more than 1 cDNA insert, or ca. 3% of all genes examined.
Checking all contigs for evidence of transsplicing
revealed that the complete dinoflagellate-specific spliced
leader sequence (SL), DCCGTAGCCATTTTGGCT-

CAAG (D = U, A, or G) [64,65] was present in 204 contigs. Of these SLs, 37 (18%) started with A, 10 (5%) with G
and 157 (77%) with U. In addition, we identified 35 contigs containing incomplete SL sequences. In 23 of these,
the sequence was lacking 1-4 nucleotides at the 5'-end of
the contig, while 23 SLs differed in 1-3 nucleotides within
the SL sequence. Of the SL-containing contigs, 193 contained an additional 5'polyA-region and thus are likely to
contain the complete ORF (see Additional file 2).
Automated annotation with the SAMS platform yielded
annotations for 1,200 contigs (28%), whereas 1,969 contigs (46%) did not produce any BLAST hit below tool cutoff. Another 1,151 contigs (27%) produced no hits that
met the criteria for automated annotation. Automated
classification to KOG categories based on the SAMS
"BLAST 2× vs. KOG" output (cut-off e-value 10-4)
resulted in assignment of 1005 contigs (23%) to functions
other than "General function prediction only" or "Function unknown" (Fig. 1).
A BLAST survey of the A. minutum library against all
available dinoflagellate EST libraries available in GenBank (as of 28.11.2007) plus a new A. ostenfeldii EST
library (N. Jaeckisch, unpublished observations) detected
similar sequences for 43% of the contigs at a moderately
stringent cut-off value of e = 1 × 10-10 (Table 2).
In-silico search for sequences related to the cyanobacterial
PSP toxin gene cluster

A BLAST search of the EST library against the cyanobacterial PSP toxin genes resulted in 14 hits at e-value
<0.001. In 12 of 14 maximum likelihood phylogenies calculated from the BLAST-identified pairs of sxt proteins
and translated A. minutum contigs, and their closest
matches identified from the SwissProt database, the A.
minutum and the cyanobacterial sequences clustered in
different clades. Furthermore, these clades were separated by long branches, well-supported nodes with high
bootstrap support, or both (see Additional file 2: Phymlbased likelihood trees with bootstrap support values). In
the case of Amin_93i12r and Amin_73a05f, the phylogenies based on SwissProt hits were not that clear (Addi-

tional file 2 M.1 and N.1). This led to a further test for
orthology of Amin_93i12r and Amin_73a05f with the
cyanobacterial PSP toxin genes by including the results of
a BLAST search against the nr database. In the case of
Amin_93i12r, the cyanobacterial gene in question was
identified in this BLAST search as hit number 64; the
BLAST result list of Amin_73a05f did not include its
potential cyanobacterial counterpart within the best 100
hits. When we repeated calculation of the phylogenies for
Amin_93i12r and Amin_73a05f with the best 20 BLAST
vs. nr hits included in addition to the SwissProt database
hits, the Alexandrium sequences did not cluster in the
vicinity of the cyanobacterial PSP toxin genes (Additional
file 2 M.2 and N.2).
Toxin production over the light-dark cycle

Under our standard growth conditions, the toxin-producing strain AL3T exhibited a growth rate (1.01 cell
divisions day-1; I. Yang, unpublished data) that approximated the total length of the light:dark period, which suggested that these cultures might have a naturally
circadian-phased cell cycle. In the triplicate cultures
examined, however, both cell number and culture toxin
content increased over the entire light phase. The toxin
content per cell stayed roughly the same during the whole
day, while cell numbers doubled from 3,271 ± 296 to
7,167 ± 482 cells mL-1 within 24 h. The toxin content of
the culture increased from 1.38 ± 0.16 ng μL-1 to 3.24 ±
0.21 ng μL-1 (Fig. 2)
Strain-specific toxin content

A. minutum PSP toxin concentration as measured by LCFD was strongly clone-dependent. No PSP toxins were
found in AL1T, whereas the toxin profiles of AL3T and
AL9T were virtually identical, although toxin cell quotas
differed by an order of magnitude (Table 3). The toxin
profiles as confirmed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 3) in the
extracted ion chromatograms clearly indicate the presence of the transitions m/z 396 > 298 for GTX3 and m/z
412 > 314 for GTX4. No signals were obtained from any
other ion traces, indicating that no known PSP toxins
other than GTX3 and GTX4 were present in the samples.
Gene expression

Gene expression differences between toxic and non-toxic
isolates were identified by microarray experiments comparing the two toxic strains AL9T and AL3T to the nontoxic AL1T. With SAM at a gene-specific FDR cut-off of q
= 1% and a fold-change cut-off of 1.5, 145 contigs were
identified as higher expressed in both toxic strains at both
time points tested, whereas 47 genes were significantly
higher expressed in the non-toxic strain (see Additional
file 3 - List of differentially expressed genes). HCL support trees in which samples were clustered according to

similarity of gene expression grouped the samples
according to their clonal designations. Of the nine tested
different combinations of clustering parameters, only the
tree based on the Euclidean distance measure combined
with complete linkage separated the midday and afternoon triplicates of the AL9T vs. AL1T microarrays. In all
other analysis, samples did not cluster according to harvesting time.
Of the 145 genes identified as higher expressed in the
toxic strains at both time points, 49 could be manually
annotated based on BLAST-based automated annotation,
domain comparison using Pfam and phylogenetic reconstruction with the PhyloGena program [50]. Putative
functions could be assigned to 31 of these genes (Table 4).
The group of 47 genes higher expressed in the nontoxic strain AL1T contained 8 genes for which a putative
function could be identified (Table 4).

For 8 of the contigs higher expressed in the toxic
strains, the signals of the non-toxic strain were identified
as not "well above background" by the microarray data
extraction software on at least 8 of the 12 arrays, and on
at least one array for each strain-time-point combination.
We consider these as either not expressed in the nontoxic strain AL1T or considerably different on the
sequence level, which might imply functional differences.
This group contains two putative helicases and six hypothetical proteins for which no annotation could be found.
For one of these, Amin_66c10r, we found a homologous
sequence in the published A. tamarense library [35], but
in none of the libraries of non-PSP toxin-producing dinoflagellates. Another five sequences examined did not produce significant BLAST hits against any other
dinoflagellate library (see Additional file 3).

Discussion
EST Library

The EST library presented here includes sequences from
a variety of physiological states induced by different treatments and sampling time points. We aimed for a high
diversity of transcripts ideally representing an overview
over the complete transcriptome of this species, by combining samples from control, cold-shocked, darknessshocked, high- and low-salinity stressed, nitrogen- and
phosphorous-starved as well as heat- and cold-stressed
A. minutum cultures and by normalization of the cDNA
library. The 15,703 read sequences, which originated
from 9,485 cDNA clones, clustered into only 4,320 con-

tigs or putative genes. We estimated that our contigs
account for approximately 80% of the potential genes
within this particular cDNA library, based upon the rarefaction curve analysis (Additional file 4). Nevertheless,
we recognize that not 80% of the potential gene candidates from the A. minutum genome are included in the
library. Based on the experience of diverse genome projects, the total number of gene candidates is probably two
or three times higher. In any case, contig numbers for the
A. minutum library are substantially lower than those
found for EST libraries of the congeneric A. tamarense
(6,723 unique sequences from 11,171 reads, normalised
library) [35] and A. catenella (6,496 "unigenes" from
10,850 ESTs, library not normalised) [38]. The latter two
EST libraries were both obtained from cultures grown
only under control conditions, and hence presumably do
not reflect stress, cell cycle or different culture stage
effects on gene expression. The relationship of unique
genes within the EST library for A. minutum is reminiscent of that of the free-living marine dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra [39], for which the EST library was
based on samples taken throughout the photocycle, but
contained only 2,022 unique clusters out of 9,309 ESTs.
A BLAST-search of the A. minutum contigs against
available dinoflagellate EST libraries found at least weakly
similar sequences for about half of the contigs, which is
mainly due to the availability of EST libraries for A. tamarense [35], A. catenella [38] and A. ostenfeldii (N.
Jaeckisch et al, unpublished observations) (Table 2). The
low novelty rate implied by these similarities, however, is
not reflected in the annotation results; automated annotation was possible for 28% of the contigs. The attribution
of these contigs among functional categories (depicted in
Fig. 1) is likely to reflect to a large extent the sequence
conservation in the respective groups, and not necessarily the true distribution of gene functions. Studies examining the function of dinoflagellate genes are still rare,
and as they are ecologically, physiologically and genetically very distinct from their better-studied relatives, the
apicomplexa [66], annotation of dinoflagellate genes
remains notoriously difficult (see [67]).
A recent study [68] suggests that gene expression in
dinoflagellates reflects genomic organisation. Most
highly expressed genes seem to be in tandem arrays of
slightly different gene copies, with few or no introns,
short intergenic spacers, and are mostly spliced-leader

trans-spliced [64,65]. We found evidence for the existence of such gene families for 8 of 9 sequences tested; in
addition to intra-specific differences among strains, there
was considerable intra-strain variability on both the transcriptomic and genomic levels, with variation in the
cDNA within a strain, comprising both synonymous and
non-synonymous differences. This implies that microarray-measured differences in gene expression might be
due to either differences in the frequencies of highly

probe-complementary vs. less probe-complementary
gene family members, or to the simultaneous up- or
down-regulation of whole gene families.
In contrast to these multi-copy genes, moderately
expressed genes appear to be single copy and exhibit a
higher intron density; trans-splicing seems to occur less
often [68]. Furthermore, we identified alternative splice
variants in 9% of the genes containing reads from more
than one cDNA, adding to the evidence that more con-

ventional eukaryotic introns and splicing phenomena
exist in dinoflagellates [69]. Based on our data and with
reference to previous studies we cannot, however,
exclude that in rare cases identical copies with different
splicing patterns may exist. Yet since splicing accuracy
and efficiency depends on the underlying sequence, this
scenario is highly unlikely. In any case, to our knowledge,
our work herein is the first report on the frequency of
alternative splicing in dinoflagellates.
In-silico search for candidate saxitoxin-related genes

The known information on PSP toxin-related proteins in
dinoflagellates is limited to enzymes involved in the interconversion of PSP toxins, which have been characterised
on the protein level. An oxidase capable of transforming
GTX 3 to GTX 4 has been found in crude extracts of A.
tamarense cells [70]. In the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium
catenatum the same research group also reported an Nsulfotransferase forming C2 from GTX3 in a reaction mix
containing adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate.
Nevertheless, this enzyme was present in both toxic and
non-toxic isolates of this species. A similar enzyme was
also found in a crude enzyme extract of A. tamarense
[71]. A sulfotransferase that specifically transfers a sulfonyl residue to a carbamoyl group present in some saxitoxin analogues has been purified and characterised
from PSP toxin-producing G. catenatum [5]. The authors
suggested that STX might be the only toxin directly synthesized, and that all other PSP toxins are derived by a
fixed set of interconversions. Consistent with this idea, an
O-sulfotransferase specifically transferring a sulfonyl
group to O-22 of 11-hydroxy-STX to produce GTX 3 has
also been purified and characterized from G. catenatum
[72]. If these interconversions are the same in all PSPproducing dinoflagellates, A. minutum should contain
the characterized O-sulfotransferase [72] and the oxidase
transforming GTX 3 to GTX 4 [70]. Searching our A
minutum EST library for corresponding candidate genes
revealed several oxidases and one sulfotransferase of
unknown specificity. The microarray data set shows two
of the potential oxidases as higher expressed in the toxic
strains - one hypothetical protein similar to iron/ascorbate family oxidoreductase was between 6.6 and 10.3
times higher expressed in the toxic strains AL3T and
AL9T, and a putative steroid oxidoreductase superfamily
member 2.9 to 4.5 times. Both oxidases had a very good
BLAST match with the PSP toxin-producers A. tamarense and A. catenella, respectively, but only weak or no
similarities to other dinoflagellate sequences. The sulfotransferase had a potentially homologous match (BLAST
e-value = 6 × 10-11) in the A. tamarense EST library, but in
none of the other dinoflagellate libraries. The microarray
data did not identify it as differentially expressed between
toxic and non-toxic strains. As sulfotransferases and oxi-

Page 13 of 18

dases are rather general enzyme types occurring in many
other pathways including those of primary metabolism, it
is not possible to determine at this point whether one of
the enzymes found in A. minutum is related to PSP toxin
modification.
The only available sequence information related to PSP
toxin synthesis is a cyanobacterial gene cluster first identified in C. raciborskii [27]. The standing hypothesis is
that PSP toxin biosynthesis should follow the same pathways [22] and be encoded by the same set of genes in
dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. This is usually
explained by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between the
prokaryotic cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates [23,73,74].
Although the gene cluster coding for the enzymes of the
PSP synthesis pathway are known, corresponding genes
in dinoflagellates have not been identified to date.
Searching our A. minutum EST library for contigs
homologous to the cyanobacterial PSP toxin genes identified several sequences of moderate similarity. However,
when we calculated phylogenies from these sequence
pairs and their most similar matches as identified by
BLAST against SwissProt or, in the case of Amin_93i12r
and Amin_73a05f against SwissProt and nr, the A. minutum sequence and the C. raciborskii toxin gene appeared
to be very distant relatives separated by many more
closely related sequences and often by long branches in
the Phyml-based likelihood trees. This indicates that if a
suite of genes similar to the C. raciborskii PSP toxin gene
cluster is present in the A. minutum transcriptome, none
of its sequences were recovered during EST library preparation.
A gradient PCR test using DNA from A. minutum
AL3T cultures grown under antibiotic treatment and
primers designed against the PSP toxin cluster from
cyanobacteria recovered no PCR products except the
positive control (I. Yang, unpublished data). However,
negative results in a PCR experiment cannot prove nonexistence of a sequence, and other primers or different
PCR conditions might lead to a different outcome. In any
case, no evidence of the cyanobacterial PSP toxin gene
cluster in dinoflagellates has been published, in spite of
the fact that the PSP-producing Alexandrium species are
among the best-studied dinoflagellates (e.g. [35,37,38]).
Together with the data presented here, this suggests the
hypothesis that the PSP toxin genes in dinoflagellates are
rather more different from their cyanobacterial counterparts than would be expected in the case of a recent gene
transfer. Whether or not this HGT event has occurred as
hypothesized, or if the capacity for PSP toxin production
arose independently in dinoflagellates, or if the bacterial
genes were horizontally transferred to dinoflagellates but
then changed during evolutionarily relevant time-spans
to a point beyond recognition with current methods, can

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:248

only be determined when the first dinoflagellate PSP
toxin genes are identified.
Physiology-based approach

Although it has been suggested [43] that many genes in
dinoflagellates are post-transcriptionally regulated,
examination of mRNA pools regularly succeed in finding
genes differentially expressed between different physiological treatments or at different times of the light-dark
cycle [29,41,42,75]. The ability to produce PSP toxins is
genetically fixed within strains, and as it is probably
genetically determined, evidence should be traceable to
the mRNA pool, whether transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated. This interpretation serves to justify our attempt to identify possible candidate genes for
involvement in PSP toxin production by comparing
mRNA pools of toxic and non-toxic strains.
Certain experimental efforts to understand PSP toxin
production in Alexandrium species have focussed on
identifying critical time-points during the cell cycle. For
example, in light-deprivation synchronized cultures of
Alexandrium fundyense, PSP toxin production was
shown to be coupled to an 8-10 h period in the G1 phase
of the cell cycle [28]. Several dinoflagellate species are
reported to exhibit naturally phased cell cycles in both
non-synchronized cultures and in field populations [7678]. As the toxic A. minutum strain AL3T is capable of a
growth rate of one cell division per day under optimal
conditions, we suspected that even experimentally nonmanipulated cultures might exhibit a circadian-phased
(perhaps even synchronised) cell cycle similar to that
found for the dinoflagellate Amphidinium operculatum
[79]. However, both cell numbers and intracellular toxin
per culture volume increased continuously throughout
the light phase (see Fig. 2) in non-synchronised AL3T
cultures. A similarly broad time frame for cell division in
a dinoflagellate is only known for a slow-growing culture
of Gyrodinium uncatenatum [80] The apparent lack of
phased cell division in non-synchronised A. minutum
AL3T cultures might be an artefact of growth under conditions optimised for high growth rate and therefore may
not reflect growth under natural conditions or in experimentally synchronised cultures. However, the failure of
most gene expression - based HCL support trees to
resolve the difference between mid-day and afternoon
triplicates of the AL3T - AL1T and AL9T - AL1T-comparisons indicate that a similar lack of phased physiological conditions might occur in other A. minutum strains
grown under the same conditions, although we did not
examine the timing of cell division and toxin production
in the other strains in this study. Both laboratory cultures
and field population of different Alexandrium species are
known to be primarily in G1 throughout most of the light
period or daylight time [28,81,82]. Thus, combining data

Page 14 of 18

from two different time-points during light phase should
capture differences in the mRNA pool of toxic and nontoxic strains during PSP toxin production while excluding
strain-specific differences in circadian responses not
related to toxin production.
The microarray approach can identify differences in
mRNA abundances of known sequences irrespective of
the assigned function, to compare the gene expression of
the different strains. This allows screening for gene
expression patterns associated with different genetic
traits coupled to physiological responses such as toxin
production, and can be used to correlate non-annotatable
sequences with biological connotation [83]. As the twocolour microarray setup used in this study directly measures the ratio of sequence abundances in the two samples hybridized, the detection of these differences is
largely independent of overall expression levels.
In inter-strain comparisons using microarrays, mRNA
differences between the strains might result in differences
in hybridisation efficiency which from the array data
alone cannot be distinguished from expression level differences. However, comparison of microarray results (see
Additional file 3:_List of differentially expressed genes)
with qPCR data (Fig. 4) indicated that in this respect, our
microarray setup is more likely to pick up slightly divergent sequences than the gene expression "gold standard"
qPCR.
According to microarray data we identified 145 genes
as higher expressed in both toxic strains at both timepoints examined. Among the eight of these that were not
significantly expressed in the non-toxic strain were two
putative helicase sequences and six hypothetical proteins
for which no annotation could be found. We consider
these eight genes as candidates for genes associated with
the biosynthesis or regulation of PSP toxins, or for adaptive responses to intracellular PSP toxins. For one of the
non-annotatable candidates we obtained a significant
BLAST hit (E-value 6x10-14) against ESTs of the PSP
toxin-producing species A. tamarense, but not against
any of the non-PSP-toxin-producing dinoflagellates
tested. As we do not know the proportion of the respective transcriptomes represented in either EST library, we
rate the match but not the lack of matches as significant.
Therefore we consider these eight genes candidates for
genes associated with the biosynthesis or regulation of
PSP toxicity, or for acclimatisation to intracellular PSP
toxins.
The putative functions of 31 of the genes higher
expressed in the toxic strains, and of 8 of the 47 genes
higher expressed in the non-toxic strain AL1T, were identified by manual annotation. A number of these were
involved in post-transcriptional processes, which in dinoflagellates seems to be an important level of gene regulation [68].

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/248

Most of the gene expression differences mentioned
herein are probably due to variations in growth rate, overall metabolic rate, or other physiological differences
between individual strains. Nevertheless, the genes that
were not significantly expressed in the non-toxic AL1T
match the expression pattern expected for genes involved
in toxin biosynthesis, regulation or sequestration. We
therefore propose a particular focus on these sequences
as gene targets to be further comparatively studied in
other dinoflagellates and species complexes for which
toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains are available. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Conclusions
An in-silico approach to identify genes related to the
recently published cyanobacterial PSP toxin gene cluster
in our new EST library of the PSP toxin-producing dinoflagellate A. minutum did not yield evidence for
cyanobacteria-like sxt genes in our species. A semi-extensive PCR approach involving A. minutum DNA and
primers designed for the cyanobacterial genes also failed
to detect congruent sequences related to PSP toxin biosynthesis. Although EST libraries such as the one presented here represent only a subsample of the
transcriptome, the lack of evidence for all of these genes
in our library, as well as in other published EST libraries
of PSP toxin-producing Alexandrium species, suggests
that the PSP toxin genes in dinoflagellates are more different from their cyanobacterial counterparts than would
be expected in the case of a recent gene transfer. This
does not rule out a cyanobacterial ancestry for the dinoflagellate PSP toxin genes, because the possibility of rapid
change of newly obtained genes in the dinoflagellate
nucleus cannot be excluded.
Microarray-based comparisons of toxic and non-toxic
strains of A. minutum indicated that many genes were
higher expressed in the toxic than in the non-toxic strain.
Among contigs candidates for PSP toxin-related genes
are the several genes that could not be annotated due to a
lack of known similar sequences but were expressed only
in the toxic strains. Further testing of these candidates, by
expression analysis with different toxic and non-toxic
strains and by physiological manipulations that affect the
biosynthetic rate and cell content of particular toxin analogues is clearly warranted.
While transformation of dinoflagellates has rarely been
achieved [84], several studies have demonstrated successful expression of dinoflagellate genes in E. coli [85,86] or
yeast [87,88]. To obtain conclusive evidence for the function of PSP toxin genes it might be necessary to use heterologous expression of the identified candidates in a
suitable expression system, followed by purification of the
enzymes and assessment of their activity on known PSP
toxin precursors.
