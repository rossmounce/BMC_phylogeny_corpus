Abstract
Background: Infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of domestic poultry and wild
birds has spread to more than 60 countries in Eurasia and Africa. It is concerned that HPAIVs may be perpetuated
in the lakes in Siberia where migratory water birds nest in summer. To monitor whether HPAIVs circulate in
migratory water birds, intensive surveillance of avian influenza has been performed in Mongolia and Japan in
autumn each year. Until 2008, there had not been any H5N1 viruses isolated from migratory water birds that flew
from their nesting lakes in Siberia. In autumn 2009, A/mallard/Hokkaido/24/09 (H5N1) (Mal/Hok/24/09) was isolated
from a fecal sample of a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) that flew from Siberia to Hokkaido, Japan. The isolate was
assessed for pathogenicity in chickens, domestic ducks, and quails and analyzed antigenically and phylogenetically.
Results: No clinical signs were observed in chickens inoculated intravenously with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1). There was
no viral replication in chickens inoculated intranasally with the isolate. None of the domestic ducks and quails
inoculated intranasally with the isolate showed any clinical signs. There were no multiple basic amino acid residues at
the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the isolate. Each gene of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is phylogenetically
closely related to that of influenza viruses isolated from migratory water birds that flew from their nesting lakes in
autumn. Additionally, the antigenicity of the HA of the isolate was similar to that of the viruses isolated from migratory
water birds in Hokkaido that flew from their northern territory in autumn and different from those of HPAIVs isolated
from birds found dead in China, Mongolia, and Japan on the way back to their northern territory in spring.
Conclusion: Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is a non-pathogenic avian influenza virus for chickens, domestic ducks, and
quails, and is antigenically and genetically distinct from the H5N1 HPAIVs prevailing in birds in Eurasia and Africa.
H5 viruses with the HA gene of HPAIV had not been isolated from migratory water birds in the surveillance until
2009, indicating that H5N1 HPAIVs had not become dominant in their nesting lakes in Siberia until 2009.

Background
Influenza viruses widely distribute in birds and mammals including humans. Viruses of each of the known
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes
(H1-H16 and N1-N9, respectively) have been isolated
from migratory water birds. Ducks are orally infected

with influenza viruses by waterborne transmission at
their nesting lakes in Siberia, Alaska, and Canada close
to the Arctic Circle during their breeding season, in
summer [1]. These viruses replicate in the columnar
epithelial cells forming crypts in the colon, and are
excreted in feces [2]. The viruses are preserved in frozen
lake water in winter after the ducks leave for migration
to the south [3]. Nesting lakes for migratory ducks,
thus, serve as influenza virus gene pools in nature.
Since late 2003, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have seriously affected poultry in

Eurasia and Africa. Non-pathogenic avian influenza
viruses (NPAIVs) circulating in waterfowl transmit to
terrestrial birds such as quails and turkeys through
domestic water birds such as ducks and geese in live
bird markets. Then HPAIVs are generated during multiple transmission of low pathogenic H5 or H7 viruses in
chicken population [1]. After 2005, H5N1 HPAIVs have
been isolated from dead migratory water birds in China,
Mongolia, Russia, and Japan on the way back to their
nesting lakes in Siberia in spring [4-8]. It is a serious
concern that HPAIVs may be perpetuated in the lakes
where migratory water birds nest in summer, and that
those migratory water birds may then bring HPAIVs to
the south in autumn.
Since Japan and Mongolia are located on the flyways of
migratory water birds that flew from their nesting lakes
in Siberia to the south [1,9-11], intensive surveillance of
avian influenza has been performed in autumn in Hokkaido, Japan, and Mongolia every year since 1996. The
subtypes and the numbers of isolates in the surveillance
in autumn between 1996 and 2009 have been reported
[6,11-13]. A total of 634 viruses including 17 H5 viruses
were isolated from fecal samples of migratory water birds
in the surveillance (Tables 1 and 2). Until 2008, H5N1
virus had not been isolated from those of migratory
water birds. In autumn 2009, an H5N1 virus, A/mallard/
Hokkaido/24/09 (H5N1) (Mal/Hok/24/09), was isolated
from the fecal sample of a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)
in Hokkaido, Japan. Pathogenicity of the isolate for
chickens, domestic ducks, and quails was assessed by
experimental infection studies, and the isolate was phylogenetically and antigenically analyzed.

Materials and methods
Isolation and identification of viruses

A total of 711 fecal samples were collected from migratory water birds at lakeside of Ono Pond on the campus
of Hokkaido University, Sapporo and Lake Ohnuma in
Wakkanai, Hokkaido, Japan, between September and
November 2009. Each sample was mixed with Minimum
Essential Medium (Nissui) containing antibiotics and
inoculated into the allantoic cavities of ten-day-old
chicken embryos. The subtypes of influenza viruses were
identified by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) tests with antisera to the reference influenza virus strains [14].
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

Viral RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluid of
chicken embryos infected with the isolates by TRIzol LS
Reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with the
Uni12 primer [15] and SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase
III (Invitrogen) or M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The full-length of each gene segment was amplified

Page 2 of 8

by polymerase chain reaction with gene-specific primer
sets [15]. Direct sequencing of each gene segment was performed using an auto-sequencer CEQ 2000XL (Beckman
Coulter) or 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
The nucleotide sequences were phylogenically analyzed based on those of the H5 HA and N1 NA genes
of influenza viruses by the neighbor-joining method
[3,16]. Sequence data of the viral genes were compared
with those from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ.
Experimental infection of chickens, domestic ducks, and
quails with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1)

To determine the intravenous pathogenicity index
(IVPI), 0.2 ml of the 1:10 dilution of infectious allantoic
fluid of embryonated eggs was inoculated intravenously
into ten seven-week-old chickens (White Leghorn). The
score for IVPI was calculated according to the manual
of World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) [17].
To assess the intranasal pathogenicity for poultry, Mal/
Hok/24/09 (H5N1) of 10 6.0 50% egg infectious dose
(EID50) was inoculated intranasally into eight four-weekold chickens (Boris Brown), domestic ducks (Chelly Valley), and quails (Japanese Quail). Four of eight birds were
euthanized three days post-inoculation (dpi), and the trachea and cloaca swabs, brain, trachea, lungs, kidneys, and
colon were collected aseptically for virus recovery. The
birds were observed daily for disease signs for 14 days
after inoculation. Sera were collected from them on the
day of inoculation and 14 dpi to test for antibodies
against H5N1 virus. The swabs and tissue homogenates
were inoculated into ten-day-old chicken embryos and
the infectivity titers of virus were calculated and
expressed as the EID50 per milliliter of swab or gram of
tissue samples. Sera were examined for the presence of
antibodies against H5N1 virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [18]. The purified A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-1/04 (H5N1) generated from H5N2 and
H7N1 viruses isolated from migratory water birds by
genetic reassortment in embryonated chicken eggs [19]
was used as antigen for ELISA. Each of the birds was
housed in a self-contained isolator unit (Tokiwa Kagaku)
at a BSL-3 facility at the Graduate School of Veterinary
Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.
Antigenic analysis

The antigenic properties of H5 viruses, A/duck/Hokkaido/WZ21/08 (H5N2), A/duck/Hokkaido/WZ75/09
(H5N2), Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1), A/whooper swan/Hokkaido/1/08 (H5N1), and A/peregrine falcon/Hong Kong/
810/09 (H5N1), were determined by the fluorescent antibody method with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against
H5 HA produced previously [20]. MDCK cells infected
with H5 influenza viruses were fixed with cold 100%
acetone for eight hours post-inoculation. The reactivity

The pathogenicity of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) was evaluated by IVPI test using chickens. None of the ten birds
intravenously inoculated with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1)
showed clinical signs during ten days of observation
(IVPI = 0.00). None of the chickens, domestic ducks, and
quails intranasally inoculated with 106.0 EID 50 of Mal/
Hok/24/09 (H5N1) showed clinical signs during 14 days
of observation (Table 3). The virus was not recovered
from the tracheal and cloacal swabs and tissues of chickens intranasally inoculated with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1)
on three dpi, and there were no antibodies to H5N1 virus
detected by ELISA on 14 dpi (Table 3), indicating that
chickens were not infected with the isolate. Although
virus was not recovered from the swabs and tissues of
domestic ducks inoculated with the virus on three dpi,
antibodies against H5N1 virus were detected in the sera
of the birds, indicating that domestic ducks were infected
with the isolate. Viruses of 103.3 and 103.6 EID50/ml were
recovered from tracheal swabs of two of four quails
inoculated with the virus on three dpi, respectively. Antibodies against H5N1 virus were detected in the sera of
the birds on 14 dpi. These findings indicate that quails
are susceptible to infection with the isolate.

Genetic analysis of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1)

Each gene of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) was phylogenetically analyzed. The HA and NA genes of Mal/Hok/24/09
(H5N1) were classified into the Eurasian lineage, and
were different from HA and NA genes of H5N1 HPAIVs,
respectively (Figure 1). In addition, the other six genes of
Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) were not closely related to those
of HPAIVs, but related to those of NPAIVs isolated from
migratory water birds (data not shown). The eight segments of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) were analyzed by the
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) available
from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (Table 4). It was found
that all genes of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) were derived
from those of the viruses circulating in water birds in
nature. M gene of the virus was classified into North
American lineage, and the other genes were classified
into Eurasian lineage (Table 4), indicating that genetic
reassortment occurs between the viruses whose genes
classified into North American and Eurasian lineages.
The amino acid sequence of the HA cleavage site of Mal/
Hok/24/09 (H5N1) was RETR/GLF, and insertion or

substitution of multiple basic amino acids found in the

Antigenic analysis of the HA of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1)

The HA of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) was antigenically analyzed using a panel of MAbs recognizing six different epitopes on the HA of A/duck/Pennsylvania/10218/84
(H5N2) [20]. Each of the MAb bound to the antigen of
Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) as well as those of the other nonpathogenic H5 viruses, and few MAbs bound to the antigen of H5N1 HPAIVs recently isolated in Mongolia, Japan,
and Hong Kong (Table 5), indicating that the HA of Mal/
Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is antigenically closely related to the
H5 HA of the viruses circulating in migratory water bird.

Discussion
Efforts to monitor avian influenza in migratory water
birds have increased worldwide in recent years due to
concern that migratory water birds may disseminate
HPAIVs. Intensive surveillance of avian influenza has
been conducted every autumn in Hokkaido, Japan, and

examined for pathogenicity in chickens, domestic ducks,
and quails. Based on the results of IVPI test, the isolate
was designated a NPAIV. Chickens were not susceptible
to infection with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) (Table 3).
Domestic ducks and quails were infected with the isolate
but did not show clinical signs. These findings indicate

Mongolia. As shown in Table 1, H5N1 virus had not
been isolated from migratory water birds in the surveillance until 2008. In autumn 2009, Mal/Hok/24/09
(H5N1) was isolated from a fecal sample of a mallard
that flew from the northern territory in Siberia to Hokkaido, Japan. In the present study, the H5N1 isolate was

that the isolate is non-pathogenic in chickens, domestic
ducks, and quails. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated
that Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) was distinguished from
H5N1 HPAIVs that are prevailing in birds in Eurasia
and Africa. Antigenic comparisons of the HAs of H5
viruses indicated that the antigenicity of the HA of Mal/
Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is closely related with the H5
NPAIVs circulating in nature (Table 5).
After 1996, H5N1 HPAIVs with both HA and NA
genes of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) have spread
to Eurasia and Africa [22]. After 2005, H5N1 HPAIVs
were isolated from dead migratory water birds in China,
Mongolia, Russia, and Japan in spring [4-8], suggesting
that the birds were infected with HPAIVs in the south
during the spring and died on the way back to the
northern territories. In the surveillance studies of avian
influenza in autumn since 1996, H5 viruses with the HA
gene of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) had not been
isolated from migratory water birds that flew from
Siberia to Japan and Mongolia (Figure 1) indicating that
H5N1 HPAIVs had not become dominant in their nesting lakes in Siberia until 2009.
On 14th October, 2010, H5N1 HPAIVs were isolated
from migratory water birds that flew from Siberia to
Japan (under publication). Then, H5N1 HPAIVs have
been isolated from migratory water birds and poultry in
other places in Japan.
For the control of HPAIV infection in birds and mammals, early detection of the viruses and stamping out to
contain the viruses in the domestic poultry are essential.

Conclusion
In autumn 2009, Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) was isolated
from a fecal sample of a mallard. Mal/Hok/24/09
(H5N1) is a NPAIV for chickens, domestic ducks, and
quails, and is antigenically and genetically distinct from
H5N1 HPAIVs that are prevailing in birds in Eurasia
and Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes
revealed that H5 viruses with the HA gene of HPAIV
had not been isolated from migratory water birds in the
surveillance until 2009. These findings indicate that
H5N1 HPAIVs had not become dominant in their nesting lakes in Siberia until 2009.
