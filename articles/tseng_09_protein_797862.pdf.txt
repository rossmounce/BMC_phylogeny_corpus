Abstract
Protein secretion plays a central role in modulating the interactions of bacteria with their
environments. This is particularly the case when symbiotic bacteria (whether pathogenic,
commensal or mutualistic) are interacting with larger host organisms. In the case of Gram-negative
bacteria, secretion requires translocation across the outer as well as the inner membrane, and a
diversity of molecular machines have been elaborated for this purpose. A number of secreted
proteins are destined to enter the host cell (effectors and toxins), and thus several secretion
systems include apparatus to translocate proteins across the plasma membrane of the host also.
The Plant-Associated Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO) Consortium has been developing
standardized terms for describing biological processes and cellular components that play important
roles in the interactions of microbes with plant and animal hosts, including the processes of
bacterial secretion. Here we survey bacterial secretion systems known to modulate interactions
with host organisms and describe Gene Ontology terms useful for describing the components and
functions of these systems, and for capturing the similarities among the diverse systems.

Introduction
Bacteria form a very wide diversity of biotic associations,
ranging from biofilms to mutualistic or pathogenic associations with larger host organisms. Protein secretion
plays a central role in modulating all of these interactions.
With the rapid accumulation of bacterial genome
sequences, our knowledge of the complexity of bacterial
protein secretion systems has expanded. In Gram-negative
bacteria, where secretion involves translocation across
inner and outer membranes, there are now known six general classes of protein secretion systems, each of which
shows considerable diversity. Gram-positive bacteria
share some of the same secretion systems as Gram-nega-

tive bacteria and also display one system specific to that
group, the type VII system. Many proteins secreted by
pathogens and other symbionts have the ability to enter
inside host cells to modify host physiology to promote
colonization (toxins and effector proteins). Several specialized secretion systems have evolved in Gram-negative
bacteria to facilitate this process, while intracellular bacteria that lack an outer membrane such as cell-wall-less mollicutes and the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria
monocytogenes and Rhodococcus equi can achieve this simply via general secretion pathways.

The Plant Associated Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO)
project has been developing standardized terms for
describing biological processes and cellular components
that play important roles in the interactions of microbes
with each other and with host organisms, including animals as well as plants [1]. The central purpose of these
terms is to enable commonalities in function to be identified across broad taxonomic classes of organisms, including both microbes and hosts. An important concept
underlying these terms is that they are agnostic of the outcome of an interaction, which can be very context dependent. The term "symbiosis" is used as a general description
of any intimate biotic interaction between an organism
such as a microbe with a larger host organism. The incorrect usage of symbiosis as a synonym for mutualism is
strongly discouraged. Thus most of the PAMGO terms
have as their parent "GO:0044403: symbiosis, encompassing mutualism through parasitism". The term
"GO:0009405 pathogenesis" can be used when there is
unequivocal evidence that a process is deleterious to the
host, but no detailed mechanistic terms are listed under
"GO:0009405 pathogenesis". This review provides a brief
survey of eight classes of secretion systems, then describes
Gene Ontology terms that are now available for annotating the secretion machineries, as well as missing terms
that still need to be added. The review concentrates on the
machinery of the protein secretion systems, rather than on
the secreted proteins, which are the subject of two accompanying reviews in this supplement [2,3].

(Tat) pathways and then translocated across the outer
membrane via the type II, type V or less commonly, the
type I or type IV machinery. In Gram-positive bacteria,
secreted proteins are commonly translocated across the
single membrane by the Sec pathway or the two-arginine
(Tat) pathway. However, in Gram-positive bacteria such
as mycobacteria that have a hydrophobic, nearly impermeable cell wall, called the mycomembrane, a specialized
type VII secretion system translocates proteins across both
the membrane and the cell wall via a (still poorly-defined)
channel, but it is not known yet if this is a one-step or twostep process.
General secretion and two-arginine (Tat) pathways
The general secretion (Sec) pathway and the two-arginine
or Tat translocation pathway are both universal to eubacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (reviewed in [4-6]). In
archaea and Gram-positive bacteria the two pathways are
responsible for secretion of proteins across the single
plasma membrane, while in Gram-negative bacteria they
are responsible for export of proteins into the periplasm.
The machinery of the Sec pathway recognizes a hydrophobic N-terminal leader sequence on proteins destined for
secretion, and translocates proteins in an unfolded state,
using ATP hydrolysis and a proton gradient for energy [4].
The machinery of the Tat secretion pathway recognizes a
motif rich in basic amino acid residues (S-R-R-x-F-L-K) in
the N-terminal region of large co-factor containing proteins and translocates the proteins in a folded state using
only a proton gradient as an energy source [5].

Secretion systems
Figure 1 summarizes the main features of the known
secretion systems. In Gram-negative bacteria, some
secreted proteins are exported across the inner and outer
membranes in a single step via the type I, type III, Type IV
or type VI pathways. Other proteins are first exported into
the periplasmic space via the universal Sec or two-arginine

A very detailed understanding of the Sec machinery has
been developed through 30 years' of genetic, biochemical
and biophysical studies, principally in E. coli [4]. The protein-conducting pore of the Sec translocase consists of a
membrane-embedded heterotrimer, SecY/SecE/SecG
(sec61α, sec61β and sec61γ in eukaryotes). The cytoplas-

mic SecA subunit hydrolyzes ATP to drive translocation.
Proteins may be targeted to the translocase via two routes.
Membrane proteins and proteins with very hydrophobic
signal sequences are translocated co-translationally; the
signal sequence is bound by the signal recognition particle, which then targets the ribosome to the translocase via
the FtsY receptor. Other secreted proteins are recognized
by the SecB chaperone after translation has (mostly) been
completed; SecB targets the protein to the translocase by
binding to SecA [4].
In Escherichia coli, the Tat translocon consists of three different membrane proteins, TatA, TatB, and TatC. TatC
functions in the recognition of targeted proteins, while
TatA is thought to be the major pore-forming subunit [5].
Type I secretion system
The type I protein secretion system (T1SS) contains three
major components: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, Outer Membrane Factors (OMFs), and Membrane
Fusion Proteins (MFP) [7,8]. While ATP hydrolysis provides the energy for T1SS, additional structural components span the whole protein secretion machinery across
both inner and outer membranes. Structurally, OMFs provide a transperiplasmic channel penetrating the outer
membrane, while connecting to the membrane fusion
protein (MFP) [7,8], which can be found in Gram-positive
bacteria [9] as well as Gram-negative bacteria. The MFP is
therefore responsible for connecting the OMF and ABC in
the periplasmic space.

The proteins making up the ABC exporter component of
the T1SS can be divided into two major groups: one specific for large proteins from Gram-negative bacteria and
another group for exporting small proteins and peptides.
The ABC exporters in T1SS contain two cytoplasmic
domains for hydrolysis of ATP and two integral transmembrane domains [7]. In general, the phylogeny of ABC
transporters reflects their substrate specificity, implying
that shuffling rarely occurred among ABC transporters
during their history of evolution [10]. On the other hand,
OMFs have not been evolving in parallel with their primary permeases. The evolution of MFPs is in good agreement with the phylogeny of primary permeases [10].
The TolC-HlyD-HlyB complex of E. coli has been wellstudied for over a decade. TolC is an integral membrane
protein on the outer membrane while HlyD (MFP) and
HlyB (ABC) occupy the periplasmic space and inner membrane, respectively [7,8]. The substrate in this model system from human uropathogenic strains of E. coli is a
hemolytic toxin called HlyA [11]. It has been suggested
that HlyA must be secreted as an unfolded peptide in a
GroEL-dependent fashion [7,8]. Although it has been suggested that a TolC trimer forms a transmembrane channel

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S2

on the outer membrane, the specific stoichiometry of
other components of the type I secretion system remains
unclear [7,8]. The outer membrane factor protein, TolC,
can also associate with many other transporter families,
such as major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily.
Recent studies have identified several examples of the role
of the T1SS in the interaction of plant-associated microbes
with their hosts [7]. In the rice pathogen Xanthomonas
oryzae pv. oryzae expression of the effector AvrXa21
requires a type I secretory complex composed of RaxA,
RaxB and RaxC. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that RaxB
functions as an ABC transporter [12], equivalent to HlyB
from E. coli. It was hypothesized that AvrXa21 molecules
consist of a small sulfated polypeptide that is secreted via
the type I secretion system and which can be sensed by
plant hosts [12]. Virulence factors such as metalloproteases, adhesions and glycanases secreted via the T1SS can
also be found in the plant pathogens Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, Ralstonia
solanacearum, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri and Xylella
fastidiosa [7,13].
A common mechanism in the rhizobium-legume symbiosis relies on secreted rhizobial proteins with a novel repeat
motif to determine host specificity [7,14]. Some of these
proteins are exported via the type I secretion system and
are also involved in biofilm formation [15]. It is also possible that type I secretion system can secret exo-polysaccharide in addition to protein for the formation of
biofilm. The TolC protein from Sinorhizobium meliloti was
also found to affect symbiosis [16]. Proteins secreted by
the T1SS are also found in Mesorhizobium loti and
Bradyrhizobium japonicum [7].
Type II secretion system
The type II secretion system (T2SS) is also known as the
Sec-dependent system as many proteins that pass through
the T2SS must first reach the periplasm via the Sec pathway. Although Sec-dependent translocation is universal
[17], the T2SS is found only in the Gram-negative proteobacteria phylum [18,19]. It is found in species that span
from obligate symbionts (mutualistic, commensal and
pathogenic) to free-living species, but is not universal
among any particular group. It appears to be a specialized
system that promotes functions specific to the interaction
of a species with its biotic or abiotic environment [18,19].
A species may have more than one T2SS [18,19]. The T2SS
is required for virulence of the human pathogens Vibrio
cholerae, Legionella pneumonphila, and enterotoxigenic E.
coli, and of the plant pathogens Ralstonia solanacearum,
Pectobacterium atrosepticum (Erwinia carotovora subsp.
atroseptica) and Xanthomonas campestris pv.campestris
[18,19]. Virulence determinants secreted via the T2SS

include the ADP-ribosylating toxins of enterotoxigenic E.
coli (heat labile toxin), V. cholerae (cholera toxin) and P.
aeruginosa (exotoxin A) and the pectinases and pectate
lyases of the plant pathogens Dickeya dadantii (Erwinia
chrysanthemi), Erwinia amylovora and Xanthomonas campestris pv.campestris. On the other hand, proteobacteria lacking a T2SS include pathogens such as Agrobacterium
tumefaciens, Coxiella burnetii and Shigella flexneri and the
mutualists Sinorhizobium meliloti and Wolbachia pipientis
[18,19].
The components of the T2SS and their functions have
been well characterized in Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and
Aeromonas [18,19]. The translocation pore in the outer
membrane is composed of 12–15 secretin subunits –
pulD in Klebsiella oxytoca, xcpQ and hxcQ in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, exeD in Aeromonas hydrophila, xpsD in Xanthomonas campestris, outD in Dickeya dadantii (Erwinia
chrysanthemi) and in Erwinia amylovora. The pore is large
enough to accommodate folded proteins such as P. aeruginosa elastase (6 nm diameter) [18,19]. The remaining
11–14 conserved components of the T2SS appear to be
involved in anchoring of the pore to the inner membrane,
and include integral inner membrane subunits, pseudopilin subunits that span the periplasm, and an intracellular
ATPase that may provide energy required to regulate the
opening and closing of the secretin pore [18,19].
Although the T2SS has an inner membrane component,
this component is not involved in translocation of targeted proteins across the inner membrane; this is carried
out instead by the Sec and Tat pathways. The structure of
the inner membrane complex and the pseudopilins
closely resembles that of the type IV piliation system (see
type IV secretion, below), suggesting a common evolutionary origin [18,19].
Type III secretion system
The type III secretion system (T3SS) is found in Gram-negative bacteria that interact with both plant and animal
hosts, either as pathogens or mutualists [20-22]. The
machinery of the T3SS, termed the injectisome, appears to
have a common evolutionary origin with the flagellum
[20]. The principal known function of the injectisome is
to deliver effector proteins across the bacterial and host
membranes into the cytosol of host cells, where they may
modulate a large variety of host cell functions, including
immune and defense responses (reviewed in [21,22] and
in this supplement [2,3]). In some cases however, effector
proteins are simply secreted out of the cell. Although initially discovered in pathogenic bacteria, T3SS systems
have been identified in rhizobial nitrogen-fixing mutualists of plants, in the tse-tse fly mutualist, Sodalis glossinidius, in the nematode mutualist Photorhabdus
luminescens and in the human commensal Pantoea agglomerans, indicating that the T3SS is a hallmark of microbe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S2

host associations, rather than of pathogenesis specifically
[20]. Seven families of T3SS machinery have been identified [20]. Plant pathogens are confined to two of these
families (Hrp1 and Hrp2) while the T3SS of rhizobial bacteria form a third family. Some bacteria may harbor more
than one T3SS; for example Salmonella typhimurium contains two pathogenicity islands (SPI-1 and SPI-2), each of
which encodes a different T3SS. Although up to 25 proteins may be required to assemble an injectisome, only
nine are conserved across all seven families (designated
Hrc in the case of plant pathogens), eight of which are also
conserved in the flagellar apparatus [20]. Thus there has
been considerable divergence and specialization of the
T3SS. In many cases, T3SS genes are encoded in pathogenicity islands from foreign sources and/or are located
on plasmids, and are commonly subject to horizontal
gene transfer [23].
The structure and function of the injectisome have been
well studied in the animal pathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia pestis and in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae (reviewed in [20,24]). The injectisomes
are composed of a series of basal rings that span the bacterial inner and outer membranes, connected to a hollow
needle (in Yersinia), filament (in Salmonella) or pilus in
(P. syringae). Each structure is tipped with a translocation
pore that is inserted into the plasma membrane of the target cell [20,24]. A conserved ATPase associates with the
bacterial cytoplasmic base of the injectisome and energizes transport. Two classes of chaperones aid in assembly
of the injectisome, while a third class assist in translocation of effector proteins [20].
Type IV secretion system
In comparison to other secretion systems, the type IV
secretion system (T4SS) is unique in its ability to transport
nucleic acids in addition to proteins into plant and animal
cells, as well as into yeast and other bacteria [25]. The
T4SS complex can span both membranes of a Gram-negative bacterium or the membrane and the cell envelope of
a Gram-positive bacterium. Many organisms have homologous type IV secretion systems, including the pathogens
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (VirB), Helicobacter pylori
(CAG; ComB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (TraS/TraB), Bordetella pertussis (Ptl), E. coli (Tra), Legionella pneumophila
(Dot) [25] and the nitrogen-fixing plant mutualist Mesorhizobium loti [26]. While these systems may share functional similarities, not all systems contain the same sets of
genes [27]. The only common protein is VirB10 (TrbI)
among all characterized systems [17]. Although type IV
secretion systems have garnered attention because of roles
in pathogenesis, it is important to point out that not all
bacteria have a T4SS.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 has been the model system
for studying the T4SS. The VirB system from A. tumefaciens
C58 is capable of exporting DNA-protein complex from
its Ti plasmid into the host [25]. The main virulence
mechanism is to inject T-DNA into the host to cause cancerous growth or the formation of crown gall tumors,
which then produce opines as carbon and energy sources
for the pathogen. The major components of the T4SS in A.
tumefaciens C58 are VirB2-VirB11 and VirD4. VirB1 is
responsible for the remodeling of the peptidoglycan via
the activity of lytic transglycosylase. The majority of the
VirB proteins are responsible for forming the structure
complex of the secretory machinery, which is powered by
the hydrolysis of ATP.
Type V secretion system
There are three sub-classes of the type V secretion machinery (T5SS). The archetypal bacterial proteins secreted via
the T5SS (and dubbed the T5aSS sub-class) consist of an
N-terminal passenger domain from 40 Kd to 400 Kd in
size and a conserved C-terminal domain, which forms a
beta barrel (reviewed in [28-31]). The proteins are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that directs their
export into the periplasm via the Sec machinery. The beta
barrel can insert into the outer membrane and is required
for translocation of the passenger domain into the extracellular space. In some cases, such as adhesins, the passenger domain remains attached to the beta barrel and the
protein remains anchored in the outer membrane. In
other cases, the passenger domain is cleaved from the beta
barrel and forms a soluble hydrolytic enzyme or toxin.
These proteins have been called auto-transporters because
the C-terminal domains form a beta barrel with the potential to form a pore through which the N-terminal domain
could pass [28-31]. More recent detailed structural studies
however suggest that the barrel is incapable of transporting the passenger domain by itself [30]. A helper protein,
perhaps Omp85/YaeT, has been hypothesized to facilitate
translocation across the outer membrane [30]. A second
sub-class of proteins secreted via the T5SS process,
dubbed T5cSS proteins, are trimeric proteins in which a
single beta barrel is formed by contributions from all
three polypeptides. The third sub-class of T5SS proteins,
dubbed T5bSS, consists of pairs of proteins in which one
partner carries the beta barrel domain, and the other partner is the secreted protein; this process is also called two
partner secretion (TPS) [28].

A very large number of proteins are secreted via the T5SS,
more even than the T2SS, over 500 in the T5aSS class
alone [28-31]. Most of the T5SS secreted proteins characterized to date contribute to the virulence of animal or
human pathogens [28-31]. Proteins secreted via the T5SS
include adhesins such as AIDA-I and Ag43 of E. coli, Hia
of Haemophilus influenzae, YadA of Yersinia enteroliticola

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S2

and Prn of Bordetella pertussis; toxins such as VacA of Helicobacter pylori; proteases such as IgA proteases of Neisseria
gonorrheae and Neisseria meningitides, SepA of Shigella
flexneri and PrtS of Serratia marcescens; and S-layer proteins such as rOmpB of Rickettsia sp. and Hsr of Helicobacter pylori. T5bSS (TPS) secreted proteins include
adhesins such as HecA/HecB of the plant pathogen Dickeya dadantii (Erwinia chrysanthemii) and cytolysins such as
ShlA/ShlB of Serratia marcescens, HpmA/HpmB of Proteus
mirabilis and EthA/EthB of Edwardsiellla tarda.
Type VI secretion system
The type VI secretion machinery (T6SS) is a recently characterized secretion system that appears to constitute a
phage-tail-spike-like injectisome that has the potential to
introduce effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of
host cells (reviewed in [32-35]), analogous to the T3SS
and T4SS machineries. The T6SS machinery was first
noticed as a conserved family of pathogenicity islands in
Gram-negative bacteria, then was identified as encoding
secretory machinery in 2006. More than a quarter of
sequenced bacterial genomes contain genes for T6SS components, mostly within the proteobacteria, but also
within the planctomycetes and acidobacteria. The T6SS is
required for virulence in human and animal pathogens
such as Vibrio cholerae, Edwardsiella tarda, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Francisella tularensis, and Burkholderia mallei, and
also in plant pathogens such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens,
Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Xanthomonas oryzae [3237]. Furthermore it is required for efficient root colonization by the nitrogen-fixing plant mutualists Mesorhizobium
loti and Rhizobium leguminosarum. Intriguingly, genes
encoding the T6SS are also found in some non-symbionts
such as Myxococcus xanthus, Dechloromonas aromatica and
Rhodopirellula baltica, where it may contribute to environmental adaptation such as biofilm formation. Based on a
synthesis of the available experimental evidence, as well
as sequence similarities with some components of the
T4SS and of the tail spike complex of T4 phage, a model
of the T6SS injectisome was proposed that includes a cytoplasmic chaperone with ATPase activity, a channel bridging from the inner to the outer membrane, and a needle
tipped with a pore-forming protein [33]. Some components of the machinery may also act as effectors, translocated into host cells. For example VgrG-1, which is a
component of the Vibrio cholerae T6SS, contains a C-terminal domain that can enter macrophages where it crosslinks actin [38]. Overall however, the identities and functions of T6SS effectors are still poorly understood.
Type VII secretion system
Although Gram-positive bacteria have only a single membrane, some species, most notably the mycobacteria, have
a cell wall that is heavily modified by lipids, called a
mycomembrane. As a result, the genomes of these species

Page 5 of 9

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9(Suppl 1):S2

encode a family of specialized secretion systems collectively called type VII section systems (T7SS) (reviewed in
[39]). The presence of the T7SS was initially predicted bioinformatically based on clustering of genes encoding
secreted proteins that lacked signal sequences with those
encoding membrane proteins, ATPases and/or chaperones. Sequencing of the Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine
strain, and mutational analysis of the ESX-1 cluster in M.
tuberculosis confirmed the hypothesis. ESX-1 is also
required for virulence and hemolysis in the fish pathogen
Mycobacterium marinum, and for conjugation in the nonpathogenic species Mycobacterium smegmatis [39]. Mycobacterial genomes contain up to five T7SS gene clusters
that do not functionally complement one another. T7SS
gene clusters are also found in the closely related pathogens Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Nocardia [39]. More
distantly related gene clusters are also found in the
genomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Gram-positive species that lack mycomembranes such as Streptomyces
species and firmicutes such as Bacillus and Clostridium
spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. The T7SS is required for virulence in
Staphylococcus aureus but not in Listeria monocytogenes [39].
The structure and operation of the T7SS are still being
pieced together. Current models [39] suggest an inner
membrane translocation channel formed by the integral
membrane protein Rv3877, and a separate channel in the
mycomembrane composed of as yet unknown protein(s).
Chaperone-like ATPases anchored to the inner membrane
bind the C-termini of effectors, which are invariably
secreted as heterodimers.

How the Gene Ontology addresses secretion
systems
In this section we review the GO terms that were specifically created by the PAMGO project for secretion systems.
Many of the functions and processes of proteins related to
secretion systems (for example effectors) can be described
with GO terms from other parts of the GO hierarchy;
those are not covered here in detail. We also note that
many additional terms are still needed in this area, especially for secretion systems that are not central to bacteriahost interactions and which therefore have received less
attention from the PAMGO consortium.
The following schema illustrates the parallel nature of the
GO terms for each of the secretion systems:
Component ontology
• type (I–IV, VI) protein secretion system complex (Type
VII currently missing; type V does not exist as a distinct
identifiable complex)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S2

Process ontology
• children of "GO:0009306 protein secretion":

o protein secretion by the type (I–VI) secretion system
(Type VII missing)
• descendants of "GO: 0052047 interaction with other
organism via secreted substance during symbiotic interaction"
o "interaction with host via protein secreted by type II/
III/IV secretion system"
o "modification of morphology or physiology of other
organism via protein secreted by type II/III/IV secretion system during symbiotic interaction"
o both of these have as child:
▪ "modification by symbiont of host morphology
via protein secreted by type II/III/IV secretion system"
The terms above are depicted in Figure 2. Note that in the
component ontology and among the children of
"GO:0009306 protein secretion" there is just one term for
each secretion system; hence the use of such terms is
straightforward and perfectly parallel for all secretion systems that have been addressed so far by the PAMGO consortium. Currently, detailed descendant terms of "GO:
0052047 interaction with other organism via secreted
substance during symbiotic interaction" are available only
for systems II, III, and IV. However, as noted in the survey
of secretion systems above, examples exist in which organism interactions are modulated by proteins secreted via
systems I, V, VI and VII as well as via the universal Sec and
Tat pathways. Thus the PAMGO consortium is currently
creating parallel terms for these six systems. Note also that
no system-specific terms have yet been created in the
molecular function ontology.
The family of terms "Interaction with host via protein
secreted by type number secretion system" is appropriate
for annotating gene products that form the apparatus of
secretion when there is experimental evidence that the
interaction with the host is affected by secretion through
that apparatus. As an example (once terms for the T7SS
have been created), in mycobacterial pathogens that contain multiple T7SS gene clusters, if deletion of a cluster
affected virulence then the gene in the cluster could be
annotated with "Interaction with host via protein secreted
by type VII secretion system". However, if deletion of a
different cluster did not affect virulence then the term
would not be appropriate for that cluster and only the
term "protein secretion by the type VII secretion system"

would be appropriate. Similarly, in a non-pathogen such
as Mycobacterium smegmatis, none of the T7SS systems
should be annotated with "Interaction with host via protein secreted by type VII secretion system", even if a particular T7SS gene cluster were orthologous to a T7SS in a

pathogenic species. On a similar theme, if experimental
evidence shows that a gene or gene cluster is important to
symbiosis, it may be annotated with "Interaction with
host via protein secreted by type number secretion system", even if some genes in the cluster appear to be pseu-

dogenes; thus experimental evidence takes precedence
over bioinformatic inferences.
The family of terms "modification of morphology or
physiology of other organism via protein secreted by type
number secretion system during symbiotic interaction"
and "modification by symbiont of host morphology via
protein secreted by type number secretion system" are
appropriate for annotating the effector proteins that are
transported by the secretion systems, but not for the components of the secretion system itself. On the other hand,
there are many cases where proteins have a dual function
as part of the transport machinery and as effectors. The
most striking of these is the "autotransporter" proteins
that are secreted via the T5SS pathway in which an N-terminal effector domain is fused to a C-terminal transporter
domain. Some proteins associated with the T6SS also
appear to be similarly bi-functional [38].
A common theme among most of the secretion systems is
the role of ATP hydrolysis and chaperones (Figure 1). This
is not yet captured in a systematic way in the GO. Nevertheless the following terms are appropriate in this context:
"GO: 0015450 P-P-bond-hydrolysis-driven protein transmembrane transporter activity" and "GO: 0016887
ATPase" and "GO:0042623 ATPase activity, coupled",
while "GO: 0043190 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complex" would be appropriate for the T1SS.
The T2SS and T5SS (and in certain cases T4SS and T1SS as
well) deserve a special note because of their relationship
with the Sec and Tat pathways. As noted in the first part of
this article, proteins translocated via T2SS or T5SS (and
sometimes the T1SS and T4SS) first go through the Sec or
the Tat pathways. GO provides two pairs of parallel terms
for the component and process aspects of the Sec and Tat
pathways. "GO:0031522 cell envelope Sec protein transport complex" (component) and "GO:0043934 protein
transport by the Sec complex" (process) are available for
the Sec pathway; and "GO:0033281 Tat protein transport
complex" (component) and "GO:0043935 protein transport by the Tat complex" (process) are the corresponding
terms for the Tat pathway. As an example, a protein that
affects the interaction with a host that is eventually translocated by the T2SS but goes through the Sec pathways
first, could be annotated using both "GO: 0052051 Interaction with host via protein secreted by type II secretion
system" and "Interaction with host via protein secreted by
Sec secretion system"

themes in the action and roles of these secretion systems
and the terms in the GO, including those added by the
PAMGO consortium, are useful for identifying those common themes. The more that these terms are used and
added to by the community, the more useful they will be
for comparing secretion systems across diverse bacteria.

Conclusion

10.

Bacteria use a diversity of machinery to secrete proteins as
a means for interacting with their environment, which
includes the biotic environment of a host in the case of
symbionts. Nevertheless there are several common
