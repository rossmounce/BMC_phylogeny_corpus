Abstract
Background: In Europe, the north-south downhill cline frequency of the chemokine receptor
CCR5 allele with a 32-bp deletion (CCR5-Δ32) raises interesting questions for evolutionary
biologists. We had suggested first that, in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans,
might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. Indeed,
statistical analyses suggested strong negative correlations between the allele frequency and
historical parameters including the colonization dates by Mediterranean civilisations. The gene
flows from colonizers to native populations were extremely low but colonizers are responsible of
the spread of several diseases suggesting that the dissemination of parasites in naive populations
could have induced a breakdown rupture of the fragile pathocenosis changing the balance among
diseases. The new equilibrium state has been reached through a negative selection of the null allele.
Results: Most of the human diseases are zoonoses and cat might have been instrumental in the
decrease of the allele frequency, because its diffusion through Europe was a gradual process, due
principally to Romans; and that several cat zoonoses could be transmitted to man. The possible
implication of a feline lentivirus (FIV) which does not use CCR5 as co-receptor is discussed. This
virus can infect primate cells in vitro and induces clinical signs in macaque. Moreover, most of the
historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-Δ32 allele coincide with historical range of
the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs.
Conclusion: We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are
the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading. A cat zoonosis, could be the most
plausible hypothesis. Future studies could provide if CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role in FIV
pathogenesis. Moreover, studies of ancient DNA could provide more evidences regarding the
implications of zoonoses in the actual CCR5-Δ32 distribution.

Background
As infection is the greatest killer in human history [1], the
strongest evidence for selection in the human genome has
been obtained for genes involved in immune defense,

including those which encode receptors. One of the mostcelebrated examples of adaptive selection is the 32-bp
coding sequence deletion, CCR5-Δ32, of the chemokine
receptor CCR5. This is probably the more recent and com-

plete example of a gene studied from clinical, epidemiological and evolutionary genetics. CCR5 function as coreceptors for the cell entry of HIV-1 and the deletion
which leads to a frame shift and generates an inactive
CCR5 receptor. Homozygosity for the CCR5-Δ32 allele
confers almost complete, mendelian resistance to R5tropic HIV-1 while HIV-infected individuals heterozygous
for this allele were delayed in progression to AIDS [2,3].
The CCR5-Δ32 allele is mainly present in Europeans (10%
on average) and the allele frequency exhibits a northsouth cline with frequencies ranging from 16% in Northern Europe to 4% or less in Greece and in most of the
Mediterranean islands (Figure 1A and [4,5]). The broadest
area of high frequency is located in North-Eastern Europe,
particularly in the Baltic and White Sea regions. From
these maximum, the frequency gradually decreases in all
directions across Europe [4]; however, some additional
peaks of frequency are found in France or Russian areas
[4,6-8]. Moreover, Ashkenazi Jews have high frequencies
of CCR5-Δ32, but this is likely due to founder effects
unique to their history rather than the general process of
dispersal that spread the allele in other populations [9].
Outside Europe, the mutation can be found at low frequencies in neighbouring regions (North Africa, Middle
East, Central Asia); it is absent in Sub-Saharan Africa, East
and South-East Asia and in indigenous populations of
America and Oceania (Figure 1A).
Because the AIDS pandemic is too recent to change allele
frequencies, other infectious diseases have been suggested
as the agent causing the selection of the null allele
increase, such as resistance to plague and smallpox infections [10]. However, analyses of Scandinavian Mesolithic
DNA which have pushed the date of the first occurrence
back to around 5000 BC [11] and genomic analyses [12]
have weakened the evidence for recent selection of the
null allele. Due to the north-south spatial gradient, it has
been proposed that the actual allele distribution could be
explained by migrations of Northern populations. As suggested by Lucotte [13] in its seminal article in the field and
by Balanovsky et al. [4] Vikings and Uralic speaking people, respectively, could have brought the deletion in some
Southern populations. Moreover, these migrations and/or
gene flow cannot explain, according to us, the whole of
the European allele frequency distribution. Also, we have
proposed an alternative hypothesis in which the actual
allele frequency distribution might not be due to the
genes spreading, but to a negative selection resulting in
the spread of pathogens principally during principally
Roman expansion [5]. This hypothesis is supported by
several facts.
The idea that bottlenecks and founder effects could lead to
an increase in damaging alleles in human populations

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

was historically reserved for isolated populations that
experienced severe founder effects (for example,
Ashkenazi Jews [14] and Finns [15]). However, recently
signs of a population bottleneck in variability data
obtained for a number of genomic loci in European populations were described and also led to the conclusion
that a severe bottleneck occurred after the appearance of
the anatomically modern human in Africa, and thus presumably during, or after, the emigration out of Africa [1618] and references therein). Moreover, the earlier European population of hunter-gatherers could suffer severe
bottlenecks during the latest ice age (Pleistocene) [19]. As
there is strong evidence for the unitary origin of the CCR5Δ32 mutation [20,21], the null allele could have been
already present in the ancestors of the European populations (in spite of their present language differences) at a
relatively high frequency, probably >10% as suggested by
analysis of ancient DNA from Bronze age [22] and Neolithic [11], similarly to many other polymorphisms found
in Europeans but not in the other populations [23].
Previous statistical analyses showed strong negative correlations in Europe between the allele frequency and two
historical parameters, i.e. the first colonization dates by
the great ancient Mediterranean civilisations, and the distances from the frontiers of the Roman Empire in its greatest expansion [5]. However, the possible decrease of the
ancestral CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency was not due directly
to the colonizers, as the gene flows to European native
populations were extremely low [19]. This suggests that
the role of colonizers were indirect. As evolutionary biologists have shown several evidences that infectious diseases, as a leading cause of human morbidity and
mortality, have exerted important selective forces on our
genomes [24,25], the cause of the decrease of the CCR5Δ32 allele frequency in Southern European populations is
probably due to infectious agent(s). It has been suggested
that the most important infectious diseases of modern
food-producing human populations also include diseases
that could have emerged only within the past 11,000
years, following the rise of agriculture [1,25,26]. The second great historical transitions occurred when great
ancient conquering Eurasian civilizations (such as the
Greek and Roman empires) came into military and commercial contact, ca. 3000–2000 years ago, swapping their
dominant infections [27]. It is either a human disease or
a zoonosis transmittable to humans. Moreover, studies on
the West Nile virus have shown that host genetic factors
are highly pathogen-specific and can therefore be beneficial in one context and harmful in another [28]. Which
agree that the possible decrease of the CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency in the South of the Europe could be due to parasites. The introduction of parasites in naive colonized
populations could have induced a breakdown of the
pathocenosis and a new equilibrium has been reached

In (A), only the frequencies of Native populations have been evidenced in America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Map redrawn and modified from [4,5]. In (B), the black areas correspond to the range of wild individuals bearing speciesspecific FIVs in a given continent, America: bobcat, jaguarundi, ocelot and puma; Asia: Pallas cat; Africa: cheetah, leopard and
lion. The pale grey areas correspond to the range where individuals of these species have been found seronegative or when
their serological status is unknown in a given continent (Asia: cheetah, leopard and lion; Europe: leopard and lion). Areas where
these last three species lived in sympatry with Pallas cat are in dark grey. The historical ranges are approximate by 500 BC for
Europe, North Africa and Western Asia; since the European settlement in America, and during the 1500's to the beginning of
the 1900's in the remainder of Africa, Asia and Oceania. These data were principally inferred from [65-71].

through a decrease of the CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency. The
theoretical framework of pathocenosis, first coined by
Grmek [29,30]) and developed by Biraben [31], offers a
synthetic approach to the history of disease. Drawing on
the concept of biocenosis, Grmek defines pathocenosis as
"the ensemble of pathological states present in a specific
population at a given moment in time" and suggests that
"the frequency and overall distribution of each disease
depends on the frequency and distribution of all the other
diseases within a given population". The concept of
pathocenosis attempts to offer a synthetic view of disease
ecology, which, in our context is defined as all interdependences within pathogens, their hosts (including their
genetic responses) and their environment.
The aim of this article is to critically discuss the possible
nature of this (or these) parasite(s) responsible of the
decrease of the CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency in the Southern
European populations.

Results
Putative role of cats as host-parasite
Previous, statistical analyses suggested a decrease of the
ancestral CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency in European population due principally to Roman expansion [5]. However,
this negative selection was not directly due to the military
or colonisation spreads, as the gene flows from colonisators to European native populations were too low [19].
Moreover, statistical analyses suggested that factor(s)
responsible for the decrease of null allele frequency had
partly diffused beyond the borders of the Roman Empire
[5]. The diffusion of one or more factor(s) excludes the
role of climatical changes, the change in allele frequency
could be due to the spread of human or animal parasites
that affect human populations.

More than any other civilizations, the Romans have created links between Mediterranean basin and Western and
Central Europe and the great routes of infectious diseases
went straight through it [32]. Not only did the first great
historical pestilences pass through the Empire, but also
the slow insidious penetration of endemic disease (like
tuberculosis, leprosy and malaria) has invaded Europe
[30]. Moreover, conquerors and invading armies brought
also with them insect and rodent vectors that could introduce or sustain infectious diseases in nonendemic European areas. As, to our knowledge, no known human
diseases could explain the decrease of the null allele in
Europe, zoonoses might be implicated. Indeed, most of
the infectious diseases affecting human populations are
considered zoonotic in origin [33-35]. Close contact with
animals is a risk for humans to acquire infectious diseases
and it is well known that the domestication of animals has
facilitated the passage of animals parasites to human
[36,37]. Many of the major human infectious diseases,

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

including some now confined to humans and absent from
animals, have arisen only after the origins of agriculture
(11,000 years BP) [1,25,26]. The five animal species (cow,
sheep, goat, pig and dog) which have had probably the
most epidemic impact on the human populations are
explicitly named the Pandora's pentad [38]. Moreover,
few tropical but many temperate diseases arose from
domestic animals, because these live mainly in the temperate zones, and their concentration there was formerly
even more lopsided [35]. In Europe, the Romans were the
cause of some permanent changes in the distribution of
birds and beasts [39]; several animals, such as cat, donkey,
mule and pheasant have been voluntarily introduced
throughout Europe [40] and others involuntarily, such as
malaria vector mosquito species [30]. If we consider that
the most impact on the decrease of the CCR5-Δ32 allele
frequency could be principally due to Roman expansion,
according to us, among all the domestic animals, cat
could be the best candidate. Indeed, once the cat had
arrived in Rome; this animal would have spread throughout Europe, quite likely as a camp follower and companion to the constantly travelling Roman armies. Moreover,
several parasitic, bacterial and viral zoonoses diagnosed in
cats could be transmitted to man [41,42]. To support this
view, before investigate the type of disease which could be
transmitted, the major steps of the spread of the domestic
cat in Europe are summarized.
Cat's origin is yet little uncertain; however, several analysis revealed that cats were domesticated in the Near East;
wildcats of Near East (F. s. lybica) are the closest group to
all domestic cats [43,44], and likely coincide with agricultural village development in the Fertile Crescent. This is
congruent with archaeological studies, the earliest evidence of cat-human association involves their co-occurrence in Cyprus deposits aged at 9,500 years ago [45].
Similarly, in all the other islands of the Mediterranean
Basin far beyond continent (Sardinia, Corsica and Crete),
felids originated from African or Middle East wildcats
which were voluntarily introduced by Neolithic navigators about 6,000–8,000 years ago [46-50]. Interestingly,
the populations of these areas have the lower level of
CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency (references therein [5]. The
earliest records of probably tamed or domestic cats in continental Europe would be in Greece by 1000 BC; however,
at that time, cats were very extremely rare until 6th–5th centuries BC [51-53]. In the Italian Peninsula, first historical
evidence of tamed or early-domesticated cats was found
on archaeological sites from the beginning of the 5th–4th
centuries BC [50,54]. Interestingly, in numerous parts of
the Roman Empire, generally the oldest remains of the
domestic cat (for example in Belgium, Netherlands, Hungary and Switzerland) dated to the Roman period [55-59];
moreover, remains of cats have been found in many of the
Roman settlements excavated extensively suggesting that

the spread of domesticated cats throughout continental
Europe and Great Britain is principally due to Romans
[40,60]. Moreover, as contrarily to Asia, Africa and America, there was no tameable felid in the Northern Mediterranean countries, therefore numerous substitutes have
been found by the European populations, principally
Mustelidae species [48,56,61,62].
World repartition of FIV-infected felids and their
relationship with humans
If we hypothesize that a cat zoonosis might be transmitted
to human, the corresponding infectious agent could also
affect other felid species. Among, all the cat zoonoses,
according us, only one parasite distribution could be correlated to those of the CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency. The corresponding infectious agent is the Feline immunodeficiency
virus (FIV) which can also infect primate cells in vitro and
induce clinical signs in a primate [63,64] and references
therein). Indeed, historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-Δ32 allele coincide with historical range
of the wild felid species [65-71] which harbor species-specific FIVs (Figure 1). The two maps do not correspond perfectly, and we can only conclude that these patterns are
not inconsistent with the hypothesis that allele frequency
and the old presence FIV-infected felids are causally
related. However, as developed below, bibliographical
analyses provide several arguments in favour of this
hypothesis.

FIV, as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) belong to the Lentivirus genus
of the Retroviridae (reviewed in [72]). In domestic cat, FIV
infection results in disease progression and outcome similar to that of HIV in humans, and offers a natural model
to AIDS [73,74]. Other felid species which are infected
with FIV seem not to develop AIDS-like disease [75,76].
However, both captive and/or wild FIV-infected lions
(Panthera leo) and pumas (Puma concolor) exhibited mild
to severe CD4+ T-cell depletion and some other clinical
health consequences [77-80]. These findings raise the
prospect that FIV is not completely benign in these species, but rather suppress host immune response and may
increase the incidence of opportunistic infections or even
spontaneous cancers as AIDS does in humans.
The extant felids have arisen from a common ancestor in
Asia 10.8 MYA during the Miocene. The 37 felid species
form eight distinct evolutionary lineages that have successfully inhabited all continents except Oceania and Antarctica through a series of migrations likely facilitated by
sea-level oscillations [81]. Among the Felidae, at least 11
free ranging Felidae species harbor FIV antibodies and FIV
viral genomes (Table 1). Moreover, nine of these species
(lion, cheetah, leopard, Pallas cat, jaguarundi, ocelot,
domestic cat, puma, and bobcat) have been shown to har-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

bor species-specific FIVs by evaluation of complete or partial viral genomic sequences (Table 1 and [74,82,83]).
However, the seroprevalence of FIVs varies dramatically
by species and geographic areas. African lion and leopard,
puma and Pallas cat populations demonstrate very high
rates of seropositivity. The seroprevalence of FIV infections in natural settings is nearly 100% in Serengeti African lions and pumas of Wyoming and Montana,
respectively [84-86]. In contrast, significant numbers of
free-ranging lions in Namibia or from Asia were all seronegative [86,87]. The absence of FIV-Ple in Namibia is puzzling, but may be explained by the low density of lions in
this African area [88]. Moreover, several Asian lions held
in captivity were noted to be 75% FIV seropositive, demonstrating that lions of Asian origin are not intrinsically
resistant to infection [89]. Interestingly, a similar geographic dispersal of seropositivity was noted for Asian versus African leopards; i.e., free-ranging African populations
demonstrate seropositivity of >25%, whereas Asian-born
animals are seronegative [90,91]. More than 50% of Pallas
cats (Manul) tested harboured anti-FIV antibodies [91].
Other species, including the domestic cat, cheetah, and
South American Neotropical free-ranging felid populations, tend to demonstrate seroprevalence rates of 10% or
less. Asian species other than the Pallas cat are apparently
not infected with an endemic FIV, although when during
captivity, Asian felid individuals are exposed to other species harbouring FIVs, these animals may become infected
(Table 1 and [74,91]). It must be noted that a species-specific FIV-related virus has also been found in Hyaenidae,
which belong to the Feloidea superfamily [91,92].
As already shown by several authors [74,91,93], the FIV
phylogenies does not exactly mirror that of its feline host
species (Figure 2). However, the relative differences in
genetic diversity among FIV strains be interpreted in the
context of the evolutionary and phylogeographical history
of each host species. Indeed, in spite of that free-ranging
individuals of many species harbor monophyletic, species-specific strain(s) of FIV, viruses isolated from different species seem to group more by geographic region of
the host than in groupings concordant with the phylogenetic relationships of host species. Moreover, molecular
analyses failed to resolve the origin domestic cat FIV
strains as has been already shown by other studies
[74,83]. The pattern of the strains infecting domesticated
cat (FIV-Fca) which exhibit three monophyletic clades
may due rapid viral diversification within the domestic cat
world-wide due to the great number of individuals (some
estimates put the domestic house cat population at 60
million and the feral cat population at the same number,
that's 120 million animals) and to the trans-continental
travels and traffics. The extreme divergence between the
two highly FIV-Pco clades and the six FIV-Ple clades suggest an ancient origin of FIV infection of respectively,

The data concerning taming dates and FIV status were inferred principally from the following references: [40,45,52,65,68,105-116] and
[74,82,91,98,117] and references therein. Felid lineages are from Johnson et al. (2006) [81]. The names of the two sub-families of the Hyaenidae are

puma and lion [88]. Concerning FIV-Pco, this could be a
consequence of two separate introductions of FIV within
puma populations [83], whereas for African lion virus,
each clades correspond with distinct geographic areas of
endemicity [88]. The strains infecting cheetah (FIV-Aju)
and leopard (FIV-Ppa) are closely related, in spite the fact
that their hosts have evolved in distinctly different felid
lineages, puma and cheetah are closely related, belonging
to the puma linage, while lions and leopards are members
of the Panthera lineage [81]. Moreover, cheetah and leopard could be sympatric; all these data suggest recent interspecies transmission. Due to the date of expansion of

cheetah throughout Africa, the FIV-Aju emergence may
have occurred within the last 10,000 years, perhaps
acquired from leopards [93]. FIV-Oma is found in wild
populations of the Eurasian Pallas cat [91], a species that
arose during the late Pleistocene [81]. The monophyletic
lineage of Pallas cat FIV-Oma and African lion FIV-Ple
observed here could suggest more ancient inter-species
transmission as the last time lions and Pallas cats were in
geographic contact was during the Pleistocene when lion
ranges spread throughout Asia, providing a possible
opportunity for FIV transmission between these species
[93]. In addition, FIV-Ccr occurs in spotted hyena, a spe-

and the tree on the right represents host species relationships [81]. FIV polymerase sequences (158 amino acids included in

cies from the Hyaenidae family within carnivores that coexist in the same habitats as most African felid species,
affording opportunities for cross-species transmission.
Interestingly, as already shown by Pecon Slattery et al.
[93], all the FIV strains which infected Afro-Asian Feloidea
constitute a monophyletic group. This grouping could
suggest a common origin or/and old cross transmissions,
in spite that in Asia, no wild seropositive individuals have
been found in cheetahs, lions, leopards and hyenas which
have a large Afro-Asian repartition [94]. Moreover, the
geographic partitioning reflected in the amino acid phylogeny suggests evidence for an Old world/New world split
(Figure 2 and [74,91]). Lastly, similarly to the cheetah/
leopard case, two American species that evolved in dis-

tinctly different felid lineages (ocelot and jaguarondi),
which have almost identical distribution, are infected
with closely related viruses (FIV-Lpa and FIV-Hya, respectively) suggesting recent inter-species transmission. However, with few exceptions, the strong monophyletic origin
of each species-specific strain suggests that FIV has rarely
undergone effective transmission between species. In
addition, the monophyly of FIV sequences within each
species suggests that, in most cases, FIV has been successfully introduced once and adapted, expanded, and
evolved within the host.
The precise origin of FIV emergence into Felidae is not easily discerned by viral phylogenetic analyses due to its

recent and rapid evolution, and to cross-transmissions.
According to Pecon-Slattery et al. [93], the widespread
occurrence of FIV combined with large interspecies divergence in Africa would suggest that FIV arose in Africa
rather than Asia. Moreover, an African origin of all lentiviruses may be posited, indeed, Simian lentiviruses are
endemic in Africa infecting over 36 species of primates
[95], and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV),
bovine immune deficiency virus (BIV) and visna are
present in Africa ungulate species [96] and references
therein]). Moreover, the substantial genetic difference
observed among FIV lineages in Africa is consistent with a
long residence time within these species, and suggest global dissemination of FIV from Africa during felid transcontinental migrations into Eurasia and the Americas
[81]. Moreover, the near absence of FIV in Asian species
(except for the Mongolian Pallas cats) suggests that the
virus did not originate along with ancestral felids of Asia
which exclude that the FIV might have arisen in Asia along
with the progenitor of modern felids 10.8 MYA. In addition, FIV related strains infect African feline species and
the spotted hyena; however, FIV phylogenetic analyses do
not support an ancient introduction of this virus to the
Felidae and Hyaenidae (i.e., prior to the Felidae/Hyaenidae, using fossil, split is dated at about 47 million years
ago) [97] but more probably, a recent African crossspecies
transmissions. Lastly, the presence of FIV in both old and
new world felids suggests that the current viruses may
have descended from transmission events that occurred
the last time felid species crossed the Bering Straits in the
late Pleistocene (>12,000 years ago [81]), or earlier. By
contrast, like the recent emergence of HIV in humans,
domestic cat lentiviral infections are relatively new diseases, with more limited distribution and lower seroprevalence than infections noted in lions and pumas [74]. The
domestic cat evolved as a unique felid lineage only
around 10,000 year ago [45] from subspecies of wildcat
Felis silvestris inhabiting Near East Asia [43]. Seroprevalence studies, suggest that FIV is present in nearly all of the
close relatives of domestic cat (Felis genus [81]) including
European wildcat F. s. silvestris [91,98,99]. However, concerning European wildcat, it is due to recent cross transmissions from feral or domestic infected cats. In Europe,
hybridization between domestic cats and wildcats are well
known [50,100,101], showing evidence that contacts
between wild and domestic cats are not rare.
As FIV-infected wild felids are present in most of the world
countries since at least the end of the last glaciation, it
could be interesting to analyse the historical relationship
between human and felids in relation with their serological status (Table 1). The exact history of human interaction with felids is still somewhat vague; however, as wild
felid species are found in all parts of the world, except
Greenland, Australia and Antarctica, suggesting that con-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

tacts between men and felids were probably very numerous during the last millennia. In spite that archaeological
and historical records are sketchy, there are several evidence that throughout history people have had close relationships with felids. Moreover, given that, the single
domestication event within the Felidae, apart from these
modern hybrids, might suggest that this group is behaviourally poorly preadapted for domestication; it is all the
more surprising that in a wide variety of cultures, over
many centuries, particular felid species have been "tamed"
as domestic pets. In addition, tamed felids have possibly
lived in association with humans far earlier than archaeological and historical records imply. A comportemental
study has evidenced that numerous species of small cats
have an important preadaptation to domestication [102].
As summarized in the Table 1, in Afro-Asia, numerous
felid species can be tamed including the four species with
specific FIV. Cheetahs, which have been considered the
easiest of the exotic cats to tame, have been tamed by several ancient Afro-Asian civilizations since 2500 to 5000
years ago [40,65,68,103,104]. Lions and leopards have
been tamed since the beginning of Egyptian history
(2800–2650 BC) [105,106]. Tigers were a popular animal
in aristocratic collections in Asia for centuries [65],). Servals and caracals have been tamed in Egypt since at least
at the 15th century AD [106] and several centuries later,
caracal have been trained for hunting in Asia [105,107109]. The earliest remains of cats in domestic or tamed
contexts from Egypt date from about 4000 to 3000 BC;
moreover, archaeological remains of F. chaus and F. s.
lybica have been found [52,110]. Pallas Cats (F. manul)
have been reports of this cat being kept in a semi-domestic
state in Central Asia [111]. More surprisingly, concerning
an Afro-Asian non felid feliformia, there is evidence from
paintings and bas-reliefs in tombs that in ancient Egypt
striped hyenas were tamed and kept as pets, as well as
being artificially fattened as food or for medical use
[112,113].
In pre-Columbian times, relatively few animals were
domesticated, and almost none of them extended beyond
the geographic limits of their wild ancestors. However,
jaguarondi and Geoffroy's cats have been partially domesticated as a rodents-catcher [114], and other American
felids which are relatively easily tamed, like ocelot, margay, and puma have interacted with humans
[65,115,116]. In summary, if except bobcats (however,
young bobcats can be somewhat tamed), all the other
American species bearing specific FIV have had closed
relationships with natives [91,117].
This bibliographic analysis suggests that both in Afro-Asia
and in America, numerous people could have been in
contact with FIV. However, the principal criticism could

Page 9 of 19

Virology Journal 2008, 5:119

be that most of the contacts with felids have restraints to
wealthy people. If it is partially true for big cats as lion,
leopard, puma and cheetah, but this is not the case for Pallas's cat, Geoffrey's cat and jaguarondi. In addition, four
species (cheetah, leopard, lion and spotty hyena) with
specific FIV were formerly widespread throughout western
Asia and Africa. To date, none wild individuals of these
species have been seropositive in Asia; however, at least
four empires (Egyptian, Hyksosian, Achaemenian and
Greek) have been on two continents, facilitating animal
trade across the Sinai Peninsula and importation of African felids in Asian countries and vice-versa.
Moreover, concerning early European contacts with FIVinfected felids, the Romans displayed lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs and other felids in menageries, pageants
and arena combats [118], most of them having been
caught in Africa and southwest Asia [53], but they were
rarely tamed [106]. In the Roman Empire there were
many amphitheatres, e.g. in the second century AD there
were more than a hundred amphitheatres in Italy and a
similar number in the rest of Europe [119]. In addition,
there were similar numbers of circuses. The Romans systematically collected animals for display, entertainment
and slaughter in arenas, theatres and amphitheatres
throughout the Empire [120]. Even if the spectacles staged
in Rome did not have an equivalent importance elsewhere
in the Empire, in the arenas of this large city a great
number of felids were massacred. For example, the dictator Sulla (93 B.C.) exhibited lions in the Rome's arena; in
55 B.C. under Pompey's reign on two occasions 500 and
410 leopards fought against Gaetulians armed with darts;
in 46 B.C. Julius Caesar had 400 lions imported primarily
from North Africa; and after Trajan's victory over the
Dacians the games continued for 123 successive days
when 11,000 animals were killed in the arena [120-124].
Caretakers could be bitten by these felids; moreover, captive felids could infect domestic cats and vice-versa, crossspecies FIV transmission involving captive felids are well
documented [74]. In addition, similarly to Simian retrovirus infections [125-128], human could be infected during
hunting or cutting up, most of the felid species having
always been very exploited for their pelts.
In summary, with exception of Oceania, historical regions
with low or null frequency of CCR5-Δ32 allele coincide
with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs (Figure 1B). Among these nine
felid species, four of them have the largest distributions of
the members of this family. Leopards have the largest distribution of any felid and were found from South Africa
across that continent to the Middle East, Java, and northward to Siberia. According to historical records, lion populations have been distributed in Middle East to India and
in Africa except in desert and rainforest habitats. The dis-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

tribution of cheetahs was almost identical to that of lions,
except that they have not been found in Europe, but that
they were distributed in semi-deserts. Historically, pumas
were found from the boreal forests of northern Canada to
the tip of South America. Among the four other felid species, the Pallas' cats inhabited from the Caspian Sea area
to parts of Western China through Southern Asia. In
nearly half of its distribution range, they were sympatric
with lions, cheetahs and/or leopards. The bobcat formerly
ranged from southern Canada throughout most of the
United States, south to central Mexico. The distribution of
the ocelot was almost identical to that of jaguarondi; they
were found from Arizona and south west Texas through
Central America to South America except in high mountains or plateaux and in the extreme southern cone
beyond approximately 45° latitude. In the past, lions and
leopards lived in Balkans, but they were not numerous in
the historical time and the last specimens became extinct
about 2500–2000 years ago [129,130]. In Europe, only
two species (Eurasian and Iberian lynx) and one subspecies (Eurasian wildcat) of wild felids live since historical
times, and their seropositive level is null or very low and
probably due to recent contamination by domestic cat
[86,98,99].

Discussion

Previous analyses suggested that in Europe the CCR5-Δ32
allele frequency is negatively correlated with colonization
by ancient Mediterranean civilizations principally
Romans [5]. We have the hypothesis that a zoonosis could
have played a role in the decrease of the mutation frequency or in the absence of maintenance of the null allele
if it would have appeared. As the cat spread throughout
Europe is principally due to Romans, a cat zoonosis could
be involved. Interestingly, to the exclusion of Oceania, in
the countries in which FIV infected felids are found, the
lower CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency is found in native
human populations. Further bibliographic analyses are
needed in order to know if FIV could infect human and
also if the CCR5-Δ32 mutation can be unfavourable.
Could FIVs infect humans?
More than half of the 1407 human pathogens are
zoonotic [131] and recent epidemics such as HIV and
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have changed
the view we had about emerging infectious diseases; these
epidemics showed evidences that animal reservoirs are
important sources of new infectious threats to humans.
Contacts between humans and animals are a crucial ratelimiting step in this process, although data describing the
variables that influence animal-to-human transmission
are relatively scarce. Therefore, a brief analysis of the data
supporting cross-species transmissions of Simian retrovirus to humans can be instructive. Data on SIV/HIV dramatize this point; scientists now theorize that SIVs were

Virology Journal 2008, 5:119

transmitted from primates to humans on several occasions [132-138]. Although HIV causes AIDS in humans,
SIV does not cause any disease in its natural hosts. However, it is not known exactly how HIV first entered the
human population [139], eating raw monkey meat, drinking monkey blood, or perhaps through another method
of direct exposure to monkey bodily fluids have been suggested as a possible source and remains the best candidate
so far [125,134]. These hypotheses are supported by the
fact that primate handlers and those who hunt and
butcher "bushmeat" (the meat of wild animals that
includes chimpanzees, gorilla and other monkeys) have
detectable humoral and cell-mediated immunity to SIV.
There are at least eight documented incidents of zoonotic
transfer of SIV to humans [137] and two laboratory workers have been accidentally infected by SIV, one infection
was cleared and the second (a human infection with
SIVsmB670), caused a persistent asymptomatic infection
[140-142].
In addition, the family of SIV is 1 out of 5 primate borne
retroviruses known to infect humans. Simian (spumaretro-) foamy viral (SFV) infection, probably acquired
through bites, has also been reported in 1 to 5% of persons occupationally exposed to non-human primates in
zoos, primate centers and laboratories, mainly in Northern America but also in Europe (reviewed in [143]).
Recently, naturally acquired SFV infections have been
described in 1% of hunters living in Cameroon, Central
Africa [125] and in one person with frequent contacts
with Macaca fascicularis in a Indonesian temple [144]. In
Cameroon, more than 60% of the population is directly
exposed to fresh nonhuman primate blood and bodily
fluids from hunting, butchering or petting [125,126].
Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated efficient
transmission of SFVs to humans in natural settings in
Central Africa, specifically following ape bites, and viral
persistence in the human host [145]. There is currently no
evidence of human-to-human transmission of SFV; however, only a few cases (n = 6) have had a short clinical follow-up [146-149]. Simian T-cell lymphotropic viruses
(STLVs), enzootic in both Asian and African Old World
monkeys and apes, may have repeatedly crossed the species barrier, the close relation between human and great
ape primate T lymphotropic virus type 1 (PTLV-1) strains
in Africa is suggestive of zoonosis [126,127], which might
result from hunting and slaughter activities. In addition,
serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of primateto-human transmission of simian type D retrovirus (SRV),
a retrovirus enzootic among Old World monkeys, in laboratory workers exposed to captive primates [150]. To
date, no disease has been linked to human infection with
this retrovirus.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

To date, concerning the FIV, for which the host is phylogenetically more distant to human than monkeys, there is
no evidence that it can infect or cause disease in humans.
Researchers and veterinarians who have been bitten by
FIV positive cats have been consistently tested negative for
FIV [151]. However, FIV infection was assessed solely by
serological tests, confirmation of direct exposure to the
virus was limited, and prolonged periods between potential exposure and assessment of infection existed. FIV-specific antibodies were not detected in the cynomolgus
macaques (Macaca fascicularis), in which FIV infection
cause clinical signs, including depletion of CD4+ cells and
weight loss, which are consistent with FIV infection;
moreover, FIV genes expression has been found in necropsied tissues [63]. As the most obvious effects of FIV infection in macaques were observed early after exposure, the
lack of serum detection suggests that seroconversion is not
indicative of prior exposure to the virus. In addition, even
if FIV is antigenically distinct from the primate lentiviruses, it shares many biological properties that manifest in
its ability to infect productively both primary and immortalized primate cell lines in vitro [64,152-161]. In addition, a FIV strain which cannot naturally infect primate
cells, when forced, preferred human cells to monkey cells
[161] and the restricting effect of the host factor TRIM5α
is fairly substantial in macaque cells, but is rather mild in
human cells [162,163]. However, the ability of FIV to
express its LTR in primate cells seems to vary depending
upon the viral strain, the experimental protocol, and the
cell line used. Most of the restriction to expression seems
to be due to limitations imposed by promoter sequences
residing within the U3 region of FIV LTR [158,159]. Once
this restriction is overcome, FIV is able to express in a wide
variety of cell types [64]. Moreover, it is likely that the
determinants of feline cell tropism, such as envelopemediated entry of target cells may also influence infection
of primate cells by FIV, which must find cells that express
the right combination of receptors and co-receptors [161].
While the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as an entry receptor
and the tumor necrosis factor receptor CD134 have been
well established as essential for FIVfca receptor-mediated
cell entry, the receptor interactions of puma and lion FIVs
are not identified, but in some cases appear to involve
other cell surface determinants [73,164-170]. Moreover, a
puma FIV isolate targeted gastrointestinal peripheral lymphoid tissues or other sites in a domestic cat infection
model [171].
The use of CXCR4 and CD134 as receptors is compatible
with our hypothesis, as well as, analogous to primate lentivirus receptor usage, the predominant FIVfca quasispecies changes during the course of FIV infection, in that
isolates from terminally infected animals have been
reported to be CD134 independent [168]. However, to
date, there are no firm data to support a role for CCR5 in

Virology Journal 2008, 5:119

infections of feline cells [63,160,172], but a FIV strain
could use human CCR5 to infect some human cells [161],
nevertheless, this could be the result of a recent shift in
coreceptor usage. In another hand, it has been reported
that env deletion mutants of FIV have adapted to replicate
in human cells [159]. Moreover, the increased cell death
that preceded a loss of infectious FIV in infected human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells supports previous
findings that infection of human cells by FIV is cytopathic,
which is probably due to the expression of FIV envelope
glycoproteins [158]. FIV infection of relatively few cells in
culture has been associated with increased cytotoxicity in
feline cultures due to the release of cytotoxic molecules
[173,174], which is similar to reports of other lentiviruses.
Hence, it is conceivable that FIV-mediated cytotoxicity
may limit the number of infected and potentially infectable cells leading to the loss of detectable FIV DNA in
infected human cultures. So, even if there were not a true
infection, a high rate of cellular death and/or an immunological depletion could be deleterious although the infection appeared to be clinically silent. Wolfe et al. [35] have
delineated five stages in the transformation of an animal
pathogen into a specialized pathogen of humans. According to these last authors, the present hypothesis of human
infection by FIV would correspond to the stage 2: a pathogen of animals that, under natural conditions, has been
transmitted from animals to humans ("primary infection") but has not been transmitted between humans
("secondary infection").
If the cause of the change of CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency
was FIV infection, the characteristics of the virus that was
present 2000–3000 years ago are unknown, especially
since recombinations and cross-species transmissions
have been shown for this virus. Discordant env phylogeny
between FIVPle subtypes reveals ancestral FIV recombination events in the wild [88]. It is probable, as with primate
lentiviruses [74,175], that recombination plays a significant role in the evolution of FIV and that different evolutionary patterns would be seen within different viral
regions. Although cross-species transmissions have been
rare, they likely did occur in the past to produce a pattern
of viral evolution in felids that does not completely match
the evolution of the Felidae. One of the best examples is
the position of hyena FIV-Ccr within felid FIV suggests
increased opportunities for inter-species transmission due
to a greater elapsed time since the virus entered and disseminated in African felids. Finally, there are now several
examples of modern inter-species transmissions (Figure 1
and [82,91,176,177]). However, while there is one case of
a free-ranging leopard cat that acquired FIVfca from a
domestic cat [177], most cross-species transmissions of
FIV have been documented in captive settings.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

In natural settings there are substantial behavioural and
ecological barriers to cross-species transmission of FIV, a
pathogen requiring direct contact for infection to occur.
The major mode of transmission for FIV in domestic cats
is believed to be biting, although vertical transmission can
also occur [178]. If we hypothesize that the FIV infected
cats before their domestication, this suggests, after this last
event, frequent transmissions of FIV by biting from cat to
human. Even if it is speculative, several forms of infections
could occur and it is important to underline that during
Antiquity, the bodies of colonized people faced greater
danger from infections new to their immune systems and
that numerous infectious diseases have profoundly
affected human populations. Infections could induce
fever, this might pass unnoticed and moreover, several
prolonged or not fevers occurred relatively frequently during Antiquity [179] and still today, fevers of unknown origin are numerous and several of them are probably
zoonoses [131]. Moreover, even if the virus cannot infect
productively human cells, it could induce cell death. The
in vitro lytic properties of this virus in monkey and human
cells suggest possible biological abnormalities associated
with human FIV infection. Moreover, infections usually
benign alone could have more severe effects on people
which were co-infected by several epidemic or endemic
pathogenous agents.
Moreover, cat zoonoses can be transmitted to man
[41,42] and the hypothesis of the role of FIV remains
putative. However, the implication of a feline retrovirus
could be plausible; indeed, three other species of feline
retroviruses, feline foamy virus (FeFV), feline sarcoma
virus (FeSV) and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) can replicate in some human cell cultures with generally production of infectious virus and could sometimes produce
morphological cell change [151,180-192]. Moreover, cat
horizontal transmission of FeLV by cat fleas has also been
demonstrated [193] and FeSV can also induce malignant
tumours in non felid mammalian including monkeys
[194]. To date, there has been no evidence of infection of
feline retrovirus in humans so far. However, all these
reports suggest that numerous cat pathogen agents could
have played a role in the putative decrease of the null
allele frequency.
Could the null allele be unfavourable?
As other receptors for inflammatory chemokines, CCR5
contribute to leukocyte recruitment in a number of
inflammatory diseases (reviewed in [195]). However,
owing to the redundancy of the chemokine system, CCR5
could only play a modest role, and blocking CCR5 was
predicted to be safe because individuals lacking CCR5
develop normally and seem healthy. Nevertheless, over
the years, the CCR5-Δ32 allele has been linked, using epidemiologic studies, with several non infectious human

Virology Journal 2008, 5:119

diseases, including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia
[196-198] but the associations have generally been weak
or inconsistent between these studies. In another hand, in
mouse models of infection, CCR5 has been implicated in
host defense against Influenza A virus, Listeria, Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans and
Chlamydia trachomatis [199-205]. In humans, similarly to
HIV-1, CCR5-Δ32 carriers also have a decreased likelihood
of contracting hepatitis B virus [206], but these carriers
improved outcomes during hepatitis C virus infection
[207] and tick-borne encephalitis virus infections (TBEV)
[208]. Moreover, it has been reported that CCR5-Δ32
homozygosis was strongly associated with symptomatic
West Nile virus (WNV) infection [28,209], consistent with
a previous finding that CCR5 was a crucial antiviral and
survival factor in WNV infection in mice [210]. WNV and
TBEV are members of the same family (Flaviviridae) and
share certain similarities between them. Interestingly, like
most of the infectious agents, flavivirus and influenza
viruses are endemic in several tropical and subtropical
regions and probably CCR5 is implicated in the defense
against several other tropical viruses; this could perhaps
explain why the CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency is relatively
weak in these areas, even if this or another null mutation
has arisen, they could be rapidly under selected. If our
hypothesis is correct, this could explain the quasi-null
allele frequency in Australia [211], in spite that the Aborigines have not been in contact with felids during approximately 50,000 years [212]. In the context of infectious
diseases, CCR5 comprises positive and negative elements
that ultimately contribute to the evolution of the gene
over time. In flavivirus infections and putatively ancient
cat zoonosis pathogenesis, CCR5 is antimicrobial,
whereas in HIV pathogenesis, CCR5 is promicrobial.
Can archaeologists excavate evidence of cats' role in the
human CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency?
Future studies on ancient DNA will confirm or reject our
hypothesis which include a great CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency in the ancient European population, followed by
a progressively decrease of the frequency southwards due
indirectly to Romans and other colonizers which have
helped spread a possible cat zoonosis to native populations. These future analyses could also give data for characterisation of ancient European pathocenosis
compositions including the genetic responses and
changes to epidemic and endemic diseases. Indeed,
whereas evolutionary information derived from presentday DNA sequences is, by necessity, indirect, ancient DNA
sequences provide a direct view of past genetic variants
and infectious agents. Moreover, technical advances in
DNA extraction, multiplex DNA amplification and highthroughput sequencing have recently opened new horizons in ancient genomics (references there in [213]), and
studies to elucidate the genetic basis of the environmental

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/119

adaptations of the human ancestors, compared to
humans today is now possible. The presence and frequencies of the CCR5-Δ32 variant in past human populations
has been studied by several authors. The results of these
studies have argue against the possibility that plague was
a major selective force that caused a rapid increase in
CCR5-Δ32 gene frequencies within European populations
[22,214] and have pushed the dating of the CCR5-Δ32
allele back to around 5000 BC [11].
Moreover, sequencing of complete genome of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis is underway [215,216] and could give
interesting data concerning the origin of the null allele.
Indeed, as Neanderthals are the extinct hominid species
most closely related to contemporary humans, the continuation of the Neanderthal genome project provides a
unique opportunity to identify genetic changes that are
specific to modern humans [215]. Dating such genomic
events would help to interpret these changes mechanistically. In addition to the different methods of age estimation based on allele frequencies and sequence comparison
between species, conclusive data from the analysis of prehistoric remains of members of the genus Homo (e.g. from
humans and Neanderthals) would help to date such
events by determining the presence and frequency of
genomic variants. Moreover, Currat and Excoffier [217]
using a method, which assumed environmental homogeneity, have simulated the range expansion of modern
humans into Europe under realistic demographic scenarios to investigate potential admixture between colonizing
humans and resident Neanderthals. Their simulations
indicated that even with only a few admixture events, the
contribution of Neanderthal genes to the current human
gene pool should be large because new genes (which have
a Neanderthal origin) have a high probability of persistence when entering a progressively expanding (modern
human) population compared with those entering a stationary population. In a recent review, Hodgson and Disotell [218] have concluded that "it seems unlikely that
Neanderthals contributed any substantial fraction of
modern variation and it remains to be seen whether any
adaptive alleles crossed the human-Neanderthal species
boundary". Moreover, more recent major events in
human evolution, such as the re-colonization of northern
latitudes after the Ice Ages, could also be taken into
account.
In addition, the analysis of the DNA of ancient microorganisms in archaeological and palaeontological human
and animals remains can contribute to the understanding
of issues as different as the spreading of a new disease. The
molecular resolution of extinct species' genomes raises the
hope of discovering infectious agents and pathogens that
might have played a regulatory role in historic ecosystems.
Potentials, and sometimes pitfalls, of this research field

are illustrated by the results of the various research works
performed on ancient DNA. For example, DNA of bacteria
of the genus Bartonella responsible of chronic bacteremia
and which have mammalian reservoirs including cats has
been detected in a human and a cat who lived respectively
4000 and 800 years ago [219,220]. Moreover, the finding
of ancient human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1)
long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA sequences in association
with a 1500-year-old Chilean mummy [221,222], even if
it has stirred vigorous debate shows that ancient provirus
sequences will become available in the future. Cumulative
research on felid natural history, evolution, phylogeography and ancient DNA analyses will provide important
context for FIV emergence. Ancient DNAs from felids are
useful not only to phylogenetic analysis but also to population genetic approaches that may increase our understanding of the incipient extinction of modern species
[71,223,224]. Moreover, the potential role of extinct
felids, such as the saber-tooth species, which co-existed
with modern felids until around the end of the Pleistocene [69] in FIV origin and its dissemination could be
known.

suppressed people should have limited contact with
infected cats. FIV infection in immunocompromised persons, especially those with HIV infection, could also
heighten public health concerns because such coinfection
is probable during cohabitation with infected pets.
In addition, scientific evidence for the ancient spread of a
resistance allele or a pathogenic agent could become available through research on ancient DNA and this research
field could be determinant in the comprehension of the
interrelations with human genome, pathogenic agents
and their hosts in the last millennia. Recent advances in
ancient-DNA extraction have made it possible to retrieve
substantial amounts of ancient DNA sequences from at
least Pleistocene remains in order to analyse the
pathocenoses and the corresponding genetic responses.
As most of the human diseases are zoonoses, analyses of
human and animal remains must be made in conjunction.
This study shows also evidence that only an integrated
multidisciplinary approach has enabled us to understand
the evolutionary history of the CCR5-Δ32 allele.

Conclusion
In this study, we have proposed the hypothesis that in
Europe, the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are
the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading
(ostensibly by the Roman Empire or some other colonizers). A cat zoonosis could be the most plausible hypothesis and even if it is speculative, the implication of FIV
added to possible deleterious effects of the null allele
mutation has been suggested. Future studies will prove or
dismiss if in FIV pathogenesis, CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role. Moreover, this study shows that in the future
all pieces of the puzzle could be put together to see the
whole picture of the CCR5-Δ32 allele evolution.
Bibliographical analysis shows evidence that species-specificity of FIV might be less stringent than previously considered. The abundance of studies demonstrating the
capacity of viruses, including retrovirus, to cross species
raises questions about ongoing transmissions and renders
the study of the adaptations required for viruses to be
transmitted from one host species to another increasingly
relevant. In addition, although bibliographical analysis
shows that the FIV has the ability to infect primate cells in
vivo, it is not our intent to suggest that FIV represents a
health hazard. However, the apparent lack of pathogenicity of FIV infection in humans, which is still based on a
limited number of cases, contrasts strongly with the in
vitro lytic properties of these viruses in primate cells.
Moreover, as the analyses concern only healthy persons
this induces an important bias. Although the risks for
human are considered extremely small, from a public
health perspective it is often recommended that immuno-

Methods
Data sources
We have compiled bibliographical data concerning the
past distribution of felids which are now infected by species-specific pathogenic agents. Species descriptions and
all references are in Table 1.
Sequence analyses
All the FIV Pol protein sequences have been extracted
from GenBank. These sequences have been aligned with
the BioEdit software [225]. Phylogenetic analyses were
performed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [226]
in PHYLIP version 3.6 alpha 3 [227] accessed at http://
bioinfo.hku.hk/services/menuserv.html. Robustness of
nodes was estimated by running a bootstrap test with 100
replicates.
