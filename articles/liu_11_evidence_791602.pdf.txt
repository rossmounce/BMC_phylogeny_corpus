Abstract
Background: High-throughput screens have revealed large-scale protein interaction networks defining most
cellular functions. How the proteins were added to the protein interaction network during its growth is a basic and
important issue. Network motifs represent the simplest building blocks of cellular machines and are of biological
significance.
Results: Here we study the evolution of protein interaction networks from the perspective of network motifs. We
find that in current protein interaction networks, proteins of the same age class tend to form motifs and such coorigins of motif constituents are affected by their topologies and biological functions. Further, we find that the
proteins within motifs whose constituents are of the same age class tend to be densely interconnected, co-evolve
and share the same biological functions, and these motifs tend to be within protein complexes.
Conclusions: Our findings provide novel evidence for the hypothesis of the additions of clustered interacting
nodes and point out network motifs, especially the motifs with the dense topology and specific function may play
important roles during this process. Our results suggest functional constraints may be the underlying driving force
for such additions of clustered interacting nodes.

Background
In the post-genomic era, the study of networks has
obtained unprecedented attention and network-based
analyses have played fundamental roles in biological
research. Indeed, most genes and proteins function
through a complex network between them rather than on
their own [1]. Recently, advances in high-throughput
experimental technologies have made an ever-increasing
amount of data on protein interaction networks (PINs)
available. PINs provide a novel perspective for the study of
the principles driving the evolution of living organisms.
In the study of the evolution of PINs, one of the most
basic and important problems is to explore how the PIN

originated and grew. Many researchers have tried to
answer the question by multiple approaches. By the theoretical modeling, several evolutionary models of PINs
have been established [2-10]. By the analyses on real
PINs, several interesting and possible mechanisms have
been uncovered [11-16]. Based on the finding that proteins of similar phylogenetic profiles tend to interact
with each other, Qin et al. for the first time presented
the hypothesis that the evolution of PINs has undergone
the additions of clustered nodes [12].
Previous studies on the evolution of PINs focus either
on the individual protein level [11,17-27], interaction
level [11,14,28-30], functional module level [9,15,31-37]
or the whole network level [2-8,10,13,16]. Few study the
evolution of PINs from the perspective of network motifs
[38,39]. Network motifs are referred to as recurring interconnected patterns of specific topology in complex networks, and may represent the simplest building blocks of
cellular machines [38,40]. Meanwhile motifs are found to
be evolutionarily conserved topological units of cellular

networks, which suggests that they are of biological
significance [38]. Further, compared with functional
modules [41], owing to the definite definition of motifs,
they can be explicitly identified and enumerated in various cellular networks [40].
Considering the advantages of network motifs, in this
paper, we explore the evolution of PINs from the perspective of network motifs, and try to provide further
evidence for the hypothesis that the evolution of PINs
has undergone the additions of clustered interacting
proteins. First, we classify proteins based on their original time, and analyze the tendency between proteins of
the same/different age classes to form motifs in the PIN.
Further we investigate whether co-origins of motif constituents are affected by motif topologies and biological
functions. Then we focus on those age-homogeneous
motifs whose constituents are of the same age class, and
analyze the evolution and functions of their members.
Finally we discuss how our findings support the hypothesis of the clustered additions and the underlying driving force of the clustered additions.

Results
The tendency between proteins of the same/different age
classes to form motifs

To understand the evolutionary history of PINs from
the network motif perspective, we first analyze the tendency between proteins of the same/different age classes
to form motifs in the PIN.
We classify proteins based on their original ages. In
our work, we use orthologous groups of orthoMCL [42]
to construct the phylogenetic profile and further to
assess the original age of the protein. Each orthologous
group of orthoMCL is composed of orthologs and only
“recent paralogs” whose sequences are similar and thus
functions are likely to remain similar. “Ancient paralogs”
whose sequences have diverged and thus functions are
likely to diverge are assigned into different orthologous
groups, and thus their ages are assessed separately.
Therefore, using this method, we can crudely assign the
original age of a protein to the time when it obtained
today’s function. Actually, there is no single, optimal
method to define the original age of a protein, especially
for the protein derived from duplication which is a big
source of new gene origins [43,44]. On the one hand,
even though we can crudely assess the time when the
duplication event happened, in most cases it doesn’t
make sense to distinguish which copy is the ancestral
one and which copy is the created one from this duplication [45]. Therefore, it seems improper to assign the
original age of one of the duplicates or both of them to
the time when the duplication event happened. On the
other hand, for the research on the growth of PINs, it is
also improper to assign the original age of all proteins

derived from the direct or indirect duplication of a common traceable earliest ancestral protein to the time
when the traceable earliest ancestor emerged, because
new proteins directly or indirectly from the ancestor are
continuously produced at various stages during the evolution of PINs after this ancestor was created. And these
today’s descended proteins are likely to have been functionally significantly divergent from each other and from
the ancestor. Therefore, in our work, we try to define
the origin of a protein, taking the phylogeny and meanwhile the (sequence and) function as reference. Especially for a protein from duplication, when it evolved to
obtain significantly divergent sequence and function
from its ancestor, it is thought to be new. This definition of the original age simply takes sequences and
functions as reference, which not only avoids the troublesome reconstruction of the original and evolutionary
process of proteins, especially proteins from duplication,
but also provides us opportunities to infer the evolutionary process of today’s PINs from the functional
perspective.
As shown in Figure 1, we classify the yeast proteins
into 5 age classes based on taxonomy [46]. The most
ancient yeast proteins with age 5 are those which originated in the common ancestor of three domains of tree
of life (Eukaryota, Bacteria and Archaea) (cellular organisms class: node Cellular organisms). Proteins of the second class with age 4 are those whose traced ancestors
appeared before the radiation of eukaryota (and after
the radiation of the common ancestor of life) (eukaryota
class: node Eukaryota). Those with age 3 emerged before
the split of fungi and other fungi/metazoa (fungi/metazoa class: node Fungi/Metazoa group). Those of the
fourth class evolved before the split of S. cerevisiae and
other fungi (fungi class: node Fungi, node Dikarya, node
Ascomycota, node Saccharomyceta, node Saccharomycetales and node Saccharomycetaceae). The youngest class
contains proteins found only in S. cerevisiae (yeast
class).
To study the interconnection tendency between protein nodes of the same/different age classes, based on
network motifs, we define “evolutionary motif modes” to
characterize particular interconnected patterns of proteins of the same/different age classes (Figure 2). We
compute empirical P -value for each kind of evolutionary motif mode with specific topology to check the statistical significance of its enrichment or depletion in the
real PIN (see Methods). Based on the credible yeast PIN
of DIP_YEAST_CORE [47], we find that for the motifs
with specific topology, the number of evolutionary motif
modes ranges from enrichment to depletion as their
constituents gradually change from those of the same
age class to those of different age classes (Table 1). The
results indicate that in the PIN, proteins of the same

phylogenetic relationship of 138 species [46]. Inner nodes on the evolutionary tree represent ancestral organisms and inner nodes on the path
from root to S. cerevisiae indicate representative time points when the yeast proteins originated during evolution. The path that leads to S.
cerevisiae is highlighted in bold and 5 age classes are labeled with different colors. The inset table shows the age class distribution of the yeast
proteins in the PIN of DIP_YEAST_CORE. The inner nodes on the path from root to H. sapiens are also labeled. For the age classification of

age class tend to interact with each other and further to
cluster into motifs, while proteins of different age classes
tend to avoid interacting with each other and further to
avoid forming motifs.
We obtain the similar results on other PIN datasets,
such as YEAST_HC [10], HPRD_HUMAN_HIGH [48],
DIP_YEAST [47] and HPRD_HUMAN_ALL [48] (see
additional file 1: Table S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 and S9),

of which the last two datasets are not well qualitatively
controlled and thus are of relatively low quality. The
similar results across different datasets indicate that the
conclusion above is robust on different data quality and
even different organisms.
Here we group ten representative time points into five
age classes for yeast based on taxonomy (Figure 1). Actually all the conclusions in this paper keep unchanged

In addition, as we know, many ribosomal proteins are evolutionarily conserved and old. The ribosomal proteins in
the PIN may influence our results. We find that when
removing the ribosomal proteins annotated by FunCat
[49] from the PIN of DIP_YEAST_CORE, all the results in
the paper still hold (see additional file 1: Table S33, S34,
S35, S36, S37, S38, S39 and S40).

are two interconnected patterns for 3-motifs and six for 4-motifs.
Evolutionary motif modes of a 3-motif and a 4-motif of specific
topology are shown, different node colors indicating different
protein age classes. For example, for each 4-motif of specific
topology, in total there are five possible evolutionary motif modes
which are marked as #4, #3-1, #2-2, #2-1-1 and #1-1-1-1. The label
for an evolutionary motif mode indicates the number of nodes of
different age classes within the motif mode. For example, #4
indicates that all the four proteins within the motif mode are of the
same age class, and #2-2 indicates that two of the four proteins
within the motif mode are of one age class, while the other two
are of another age class.

Considering the length limitation of the table, here for 5-motif we only show

Actually for all possible motif modes and topologies, the results are consistent
(additional file 1: Table S1).

The influence of topologies and biological functions on
co-origins of motif constituents

Proteins of the same age class tend to form motifs,
while those of different age classes tend to avoid forming motifs. This finding means that in the PIN, age
homogeneity of motif constituents is higher than random expectation. In this part we further analyze
whether age homogeneity of motif constituents is different for different classes of motifs with special topology
or/and function in the real PIN. For this purpose, we
introduce the “age homogeneity rate” and the “age
homogeneity ratio”. The “age homogeneity rate” is
referred to as the fraction of motifs whose constituents
are of the same age class among a class of motifs with
specific topology or/and function. The “age homogeneity
ratio” is defined as the ratio of the age homogeneity rate
of the real network to its random expectation, which
can measure the extent to which a class of motifs with
specific topology or/and function affect co-origins of
their constituents.
We observe that in the PIN of DIP_YEAST_CORE,
motifs with different topologies indeed have different
age homogeneity rates (chi-square test, P <10-4 for 3, 4,
5-motifs), while this phenomena is absent in random
networks (Table 2). Especially, among the motifs with a
special number of nodes, the age homogeneity rates
seem to be correlated with the topological saturation
(Table 2). To quantify this relationship, we test the correlation between motifs’ topological saturation (which is
simply measured by the number of edges within the
motifs) and their age homogeneity (see additional file 1:
Table S11), and the correlation between the clustering
coefficient and age homogeneity for single proteins
(which is defined as the fraction of its interaction partners which are of the same age class as the protein) (see
additional file 1: Figure S1). In both cases we observe
week but significant positive correlations. Furthermore,
by analyzing the age homogeneity ratio, we find that the
constraints of motifs with a special number of nodes
and edges forcing their constituents’ co-origins seem to
rise as the number of nodes and edges increases.
To find out whether the biological functions of the
yeast proteins within the motifs affect their age homogeneity, here we only take those motifs whose constituents
share at least one common functional category into
account, and assign such motifs to the common

Age homogeneity rate is referred to as the fraction of the motifs whose
constituents are of the same age class. b Age homogeneity ratio is defined as
the ratio of the age homogeneity rate of the real network to its random
expectation which is calculated as the average age homogeneity rate of the
1000 random networks (the fourth column). c Considering the length
limitation of the table, here we only show six representative kinds of topology
for 5-motif. Actually for all possible topologies of 5-motifs, the results are
consistent (additional file 1: Table S10).

functional class. First, we find the conclusion that the
age homogeneity of motif constituents is higher than random expectation holds for most classes of motifs with
specific function (Table 3). Further, we find different biological functions have different age homogeneity rates
(chi-square test, P <10-4 for 3, 4-motifs) and age homogeneity ratios: motifs belonging to functional classes of protein fate, protein synthesis, and transcription tend to
have high age homogeneity ratios, while those belonging
to functional classes of energy, signal transduction and
metabolism low co-original constraints.
Finally, we also check the joint impact of motif topologies and functions on co-origins of motif constituents
(see additional file 1: Table S13). We find the conclusion
that age homogeneity of motif constituents is higher than
random expectation is also true for most classes of motifs
with specific function and topology. Different combinations of biological functions and topologies have different
joint constraints forcing co-origins of motif constituents
based on their age homogeneity ratios.
Evolutionary rates and functions of the proteins within
motifs whose constituents are of the same age class

To further analyze the evolutionary history of the PIN
from network motifs, we focus on those age-homogeneous

motifs whose constituents are of the same age class and
analyze them from the following aspects.
First, by computing the evolutionary rates, we find the
proteins within the age-homogeneous motifs co-evolve
to a significantly higher degree than those participating
in the other motifs (Figure 3A, B). Then, we further
observe that the constituents of these motifs with constituents of the same age class tend to share the same
biological functions (Table 4). From the other point of
view, the proteins within the motifs whose members
share at least one common functional category tend to
be of the same age class, compared with those within
the other motifs (see additional file 1: Table S14).
Further, compared with the other motifs, these agehomogeneous motifs tend to be within protein complexes (see additional file 1: Table S15). Finally, we find
these motifs also tend to have dense intraconnectedness
(see additional file 1: Table S16), which is consistent
with the finding that the motifs of high topological
saturation tend to be of high age homogeneity (Table 2
and Table S11).
In 2003, Wuchty et al. found in yeast, proteins that
participate in the motifs are more conserved than those
that don’t [38]. Here we further find that compared with
the other motif constituents, proteins participating in
age-homogeneous motifs significantly tend to co-evolve,
share the same functions and be densely interconnected,
and these motifs tend to be within protein complexes.

Discussion
Evidence for the hypothesis of the clustered additions
from network motifs

In 2003, based on the finding that proteins of similar
phylogenetic profiles tend to interact with each other
[12], Qin et al. first presented the hypothesis that the
evolution of PINs has undergone the additions of clustered nodes. Here we find proteins of the same age class
not only tend to interact but also tend to form motifs
(Table 1), which presents a more direct support for the
hypothesis of the clustered additions. Here, “the addition
of clustered interacting proteins during the evolution of
PINs” means that several proteins along with the interactions between them originated and joined the PIN
during a relatively short period of time.
We further explore the possibility of the clustered
additions by discussing two alternative scenarios which
could lead to the formation of these today’s age-homogenous motifs. One scenario is that these proteins
formed motifs just during almost the same period of
time when these proteins originated, that is, they were
clusteredly added during this period of time, and the
other is that the interactions between these constituents
gradually appeared during a long period of time after
these constituents originated, and ultimately formed

Protein functional categories are based on FunCat functional classification system [49]. Here we list their abbreviations and please refer to Table S12 in

today’s motifs from separated nodes. From the intuitive
and parsimonious view, we support the former one. As
we know, protein interactions are frequently conserved
across multiple organisms [50,51], which is also the theoretical basis for protein interaction prediction using
orthologs [52-56]. In our study, proteins within these
age-homogeneous motifs significantly tend to share
similar phylogenetic profiles (see additional file 1: Figure
S2), which means these proteins significantly co-occur
in different genomes. We have already known they form
motifs in yeast. Then based on the conservation of
interactions, we can speculate that their co-occurring

orthologous hits are likely to form motifs in other species. When a motif exists in multiple species, from the
most parsimonious perspective, the motif existed in the
ancestral species rather than gradually formed in child
species independently. This suggests that the proteins
within today’s age-homogenous motifs formed motifs
during almost the same period of time when these proteins originated, that is, they are much more likely to be
clusteredly added to the PIN during evolution.
Meanwhile, co-evolution (Figure 3A, B) and functional
homogeneity (Table 4 Table S14 and Table S15 in the
additional file 1) of the constituents within these age-

homogenous motifs are consistent with their clustered
additions. It is likely that after these proteins’ traced
ancestors were clusteredly added to the PIN (maybe as a
result of functional needs), they together played a functionally important role, and thus underwent similar
inner and outer pressure and co-evolved to further
maintain steady motif structure to “guarantee” biological
functions.
Our results from network motifs suggest that the proteins within age-homogeneous motifs tend to be clusteredly added historically during a (short) period of time.
However such tendencies of clustered additions are
affected by topologies and biological functions. Motifs
with specific function and dense topology were more
likely to be clusteredly added to the PIN (Table 2 and 3).

will be traced to the same origin and thus be assigned
the same original age, which will result in some agehomogeneous motifs in which some members are
("recent”) paralogous to other members. The members
of such age-homogeneous motifs may not be thought to
be clusteredly added to the network during the (short)
period of time when these members originated. Because
at the original time of these members, there is only one
ancestor of these paralogous members and such agehomogeneous motifs’ ultimate formation depends on
the later (recent) duplication event. However actually we
find the fractions of such motifs with recent paralog
pairs among all the age-homogeneous motifs are small,
which are only 2.4% for 3-motifs and 2.7% for 4-motifs.
Evidence for the hypothesis of the clustered additions
from protein complexes

The impact of “recent paralogs” on the issue of the

Another evidence for the additions of clustered interacting nodes comes from the analyses of yeast protein
complexes [57]. We find there are significantly more

The definition of “functional homogeneity rate” is similar to that of “age homogeneity rate”. It is calculated as the number of motifs whose members share at
least one common functional category divided by the total number of motifs.

age-homogeneous complexes whose constituents are all
of the same age class than random expectation based on
1000 experiments established by randomizing the corresponding relationships between proteins in the yeast
genome and their ages. Further, among the other ageheterogeneous complexes, there are also significantly
more complexes which are significantly enriched with
members from a special age class (the corresponding
upper-tailed P- value of hypergeometric cumulative distribution [58] is less than 0.05) than random expectation
(Figure 4A). These results still hold when only considering protein complexes without recent paralog pairs (see
the second part of Discussion for the details) (Figure 4B).
Functional constraints as the possible driving force of the
clustered additions

Qin et al. used natural selection to explain the additions
of clustered nodes [12]. They thought that a new function likely requires a group of interacting new proteins
and the growth of PINs is under functional constraints.
Indeed, we find co-evolution (Figure 3A, B) of the constituents of these age-homogeneous motifs, which suggests functional significance for a cluster of interacting
proteins. Also we find proteins within these age-homogeneous motifs tend to share the same biological functions (Table 4) and these motifs tend to be within
known protein complexes (see additional file 1: Table
S15). All the results indicate that these motifs of the
same age class tend to be functionally significant. What
is more, as we know, protein complexes are definite

Page 8 of 12

functional modules in the PIN. Their analytic results
(Figure 4) provide powerful evidence for functional constraints as the driving force of the additions of clustered
interacting nodes.

Conclusions
In the PIN, proteins of the same age class tend to form
motifs while those of different age classes tend to avoid
forming motifs. The constituents within the motifs with
specific function or dense topology tend to be under high
co-original constraints. Further the proteins participating
in the motifs with members of the same age class tend to
be densely interconnected, share the same functions and
evolve at similar rates, and these motifs tend to be within
protein complexes. These results suggest that the agehomogeneous motifs historically tend to be clusteredly
added to the PIN, especially those with dense topology
and specific function, providing evidence for the hypothesis of the additions of clustered interacting nodes from
the network motif perspective for the first time. Our
results also suggest functional constraints may be the
underlying driving force for such clustered additions.
Methods
Protein-protein interactions

For yeast, we use two protein-protein interaction datasets. One is from Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)
which catalogs experimentally determined protein interactions from a variety of sources (Version 20080114)
[47]. After removing self-interactions, we obtain 15410

Figure 4 The number of yeast protein complexes and their random expectation. We consider two kinds of protein complexes. One is
those whose members are all of the same age class, and the other is those which are significantly enriched with members from a particular age
class. The random expectation is the average of 1000 randomizations which is established by randomizing the corresponding relationships
between proteins in the yeast genome and their ages. The empirical P -values are all less than 10-3 . (A) The results are obtained considering all
yeast protein complexes. (B) The results are obtained only considering yeast protein complexes without recent paralog pairs (see the Discussion
part for the details).

yeast protein interactions between 4551 proteins
(DIP_YEAST). Especially, DIP provides a reliable, core
subset of DIP_YEAST which is denoted as DIP_YEAST_
CORE (Version 20071007). This core subset contains
protein interactions that have been computationally verified or observed in more than one large-scale experiment
or those that come from small-scale experiments [26].
After self-interactions are removed, DIP_YEAST_CORE
contains 5611 interactions between 2545 proteins. To
validate the universality of our analytic results, we use
the other yeast protein interaction dataset which contains
12051 non-self interactions between 3264 proteins. This
dataset denoted as YEAST_HC is from Kim and Marcotte [10] and is a reliable subset of literature-curated
yeast protein interaction data in BioGrid [59].
In addition, for testing the robustness of the result of
the interconnection tendency between the proteins of
the same/different age classes on PINs of other organisms, we also analyze the other two human PINs respectively denoted as HPRD_HUMAN_ALL (highthroughput and low-throughput experimental interactions, 22545 non-self interactions, 6919 proteins) and
HPRD_HUMAN_HIGH (low-throughput experimental
interactions, 17156 non-self interactions, 5704 proteins),
which are downloaded from Human Protein Reference
Database (HPRD) (Release 7) [48].
Yeast protein complexes

We use re-annotated, manually curated MIPS yeast protein complexes provided by de Lichtenberg et al. which
contain 199 complexes, 966 proteins [57]. Compared
with original MIPS complexes [60], the re-annotated
data reflect known dynamic expression information of
proteins and thus can better represent real complexes in
vivo . For example, in vivo Cdc28p can only interact
with a single cyclin at a time, however in MIPS Cdc28p
and all its 9 interacting cyclins are organized as a single
complex. To correct this, de Lichtenberg et al. annotated 9 complexes instead.
Age assessment of proteins

We use the GeneTrace algorithm with default parameters to assess each protein’s original age [61]. GeneTrace is an efficient algorithm that allows the
reconstruction of the most likely evolutionary scenario
of an individual protein, including the original time of
this protein, given a phylogenetic profile of the protein
and an evolutionary tree including all organisms
involved. Compared with the simple method of finding
orthologs in representative species [62-64], GeneTrace
algorithm takes gene loss and horizontal transfer events
into account to a certain extent, and thus is more precise in assessing protein ages. The phylogenetic profile
of a protein is defined as a binary vector based on the

Page 9 of 12

presence (1) or absence (0) of its orthologous hits in the
reference genomes. Here we use orthologous groups
from orthoMCL (Version 4.0) [42] to construct the phylogenetic profiles. Each orthologous group from
orthoMCL consists of orthologs and only “recent paralogs” derived from recent gene duplication which retain
similar sequences and are likely to retain similar functions. Those “ancient paralogs” from ancient duplication
events which are likely to exhibit divergent functions are
assigned into different orthologous groups of orthoMCL
[42]. Totally, the orthologous group data of orthoMCL
involve 50 prokaryotic and 88 eukaryotic genomes and
thus the phylogenetic profile here is a 138-dimention
binary vector. Phylogenetic tree including these 138 species is from NCBI Taxonomy common tree system
(Version 2010 Aug) [46] (Figure 1).
Network motifs and evolutionary motif modes

“Network motifs” are recurring, topologically distinct
interconnected patterns of nodes in complex networks
[38,40]. Based on network motifs, we define “evolutionary motif modes” as network motifs which characterize
particular interconnected patterns of proteins of the
same/different age classes (Figure 2). We use FANMOD
software [65] to detect network motifs and then Perl
programs to obtain evolutionary motif modes. FANMOD software implements RAND-ESU algorithm to
enumerate and sample the vertex-induced motifs [66].
For a given subset of the vertices of network G, the vertex-induced motif is unique. Therefore, there are not
motifs with the same vertices but with different topologies. This algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than
any other existing algorithms for this task [67].
Random age assignment and empirical P -value

If the ages of proteins don’t impact the interconnected
patterns of proteins of the same/different age classes in
the PIN, a random age assignment should give similar
interconnected patterns as seen in the real PIN. To
analyze the interconnection tendency of proteins of the
same/different age classes, we first generate 1000 random networks by randomizing the corresponding relationships between proteins and their ages in real
network. Then we use empirical P -value to evaluate
the statistical significance of enrichment/depletion of
each kind of evolutionary motif mode in the real network [68,69]. For each kind of motif mode of specific
topology, the empirical P -value is calculated as the
fraction of random networks in which its number is
not smaller than (upper tail) or not larger than (lower
tail) that in real network. The evolutionary motif
modes are significantly enriched/depleted in the real
network when the upper-tailed/lower-tailed P -value is
less than 0.05.

Functional annotation of yeast proteins

The molecular functions of yeast proteins are based on
Functional Catalogue (FunCat) annotations [49] from
MIPS/CYGD database [60]. FunCat is a hierarchically
structured functional classification system, and each
FunCat term can be traced to different annotation levels
in the hierarchies. Here we only focus on the first level
(see additional file 1: Table S12).
Yeast protein evolutionary rates

The evolutionary rate of a protein is defined as the ratio
between the number of non-synonymous substitutions
per non-synonymous site (dN ) and the number of
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS ). To
compute evolutionary rates of S. cerevisiae proteins, we
adopt S. paradoxus as reference species which is the
most closely related species to S. cerevisiae among all
the completely sequenced organisms. Amino acid
sequences and corresponding coding sequences (CDS)
of proteins of the two species are from Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) (for S. cerevisiae , Version 20Feb-2009 and for S. paradoxus , Version 14-Dec-2004)
[70]. S. cerevisiae-S. paradoxus orthologs are obtained
using Inparanoid program [71]. Pairs of orthologous
proteins are aligned using the ClustalW program [72]
and dN /dS s are calculated using PAML program [73].
