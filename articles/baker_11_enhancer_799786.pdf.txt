The Enhancer of split complex arose prior to the
diversification of schizophoran flies and is
strongly conserved between Drosophila and stalkeyed flies (Diopsidae)
Richard H Baker1*, Jennifer V Kuehl2,3 and Gerald S Wilkinson4

Abstract
Background: In Drosophila, the Enhancer of split complex (E(spl)-C) comprises 11 bHLH and Bearded genes that
function during Notch signaling to repress proneural identity in the developing peripheral nervous system.
Comparison with other insects indicates that the basal state for Diptera is a single bHLH and Bearded homolog
and that the expansion of the gene complex occurred in the lineage leading to Drosophila. However, comparative
genomic data from other fly species that would elucidate the origin and sequence of gene duplication for the
complex is lacking. Therefore, in order to examine the evolutionary history of the complex within Diptera, we
reconstructed, using several fosmid clones, the entire E(spl)-complex in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni and
collected additional homologs of E(spl)-C genes from searches of dipteran EST databases and the Glossina
morsitans genome assembly.
Results: Comparison of the Teleopsis E(spl)-C gene organization with Drosophila indicates complete conservation in
gene number and orientation between the species except that T. dalmanni contains a duplicated copy of E(spl)m5 that
is not present in Drosophila. Phylogenetic analysis of E(spl)-complex bHLH and Bearded genes for several dipteran
species clearly demonstrates that all members of the complex were present prior to the diversification of schizophoran
flies. Comparison of upstream regulatory elements and 3’ UTR domains between the species also reveals strong
conservation for many of the genes and identifies several novel characteristics of E(spl)-C regulatory evolution including
the discovery of a previously unidentified, highly conserved SPS+A domain between E(spl)mg and E(spl)mb.
Conclusion: Identifying the phylogenetic origin of E(spl)-C genes and their associated regulatory DNA is essential
to understanding the functional significance of this well-studied gene complex. Results from this study provide
numerous insights into the evolutionary history of the complex and will help refine the focus of studies examining
the adaptive consequences of this gene expansion.

Background
Expansion of gene families by gene duplication is a
common feature of evolutionary history and is expected
to provide a major source of novel genetic material
needed to facilitate phenotypic evolution [1-5]. While
most duplicates are rapidly lost from the genome, some

are retained because of increased dosage requirements,
the acquisition of new functions (e.g. neofunctionilization) or the splitting of the ancestral function between
the duplicate copies (e.g. subfunctionilization) [5,6]. The
genetic variation provided by gene duplication may be
as important for adaptive evolution as replacement substitutions or changes in regulatory DNA [2,4]. Genomiclevel comparisons that are now possible for closely
related species in a few groups have provided fine-scaled
resolution of shifts in gene family sizes and revealed

that rapid changes in gene family composition is pervasive [3,7,8]. The evolutionary pressures shaping the size
and structure of gene families can vary substantially in
different lineages. For instance, an analysis of the 12
Drosophila genomes estimated that approximately 10%
of all gene families are specific to a single lineage within
the genus [1]. Precise mapping of the phylogenetic pattern of gains and losses in gene family structure and
organization is necessary to understand the evolutionary
factors driving these changes.
One gene complex that appears to be specific to Drosophila relative to other insects and may play an important role in the evolution of this genus is the Enhancer
of split complex (E(spl)-C). This complex spans a 45 kb
region in Drosophila melanogaster and comprises seven
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (mδ,
mg, mb, m3, m5, m7, m8), four Bearded (Brd) class
genes (ma, m2, m4, m6) and a single gene (m1) thought
to act as a protease inhibitor [9]. All the bHLH and Brd
genes play a role in neurogenesis and function as negative regulators in the Notch signaling pathway [10-17].
Their primary role is to limit the number of progenitor
cells during neural specification. For instance, in the formation of the adult peripheral nervous system, small
clusters of cells acquire neural cell fate potential
through the expression of proneural proteins such as
Achaete and Scute. Only one of these cells, the Sensory
Organ Precursor (SOP) cell, will develop into the components of the adult bristle. In response to Notch signaling, the E(spl)-C proteins specify the identity of the
SOP by suppressing proneural protein expression in all
cells adjacent to the SOP, a process known as lateral
inhibition. Large deletions within the E(spl)-complex
produce excessive neuronal differentiation [14,18],
whereas elevated expression of the E(spl)-C proteins
reduces sensory organ cells [15].
Despite the neural hyperplasia resulting from large
deletions, it has been difficult to identify phenotypic
defects caused by fine scale mutations within the complex and deletion of an entire gene is rarely lethal
[17,19]. This pattern suggests strong functional redundancy among the genes [20]. Two other lines of evidence, however, indicate unique functional roles for
each of the E(spl)-C genes. First, individual genes exhibit
strong gene-specific expression patterns, particularly in
the imaginal discs [10,21,22]. Second, comparisons
between D. melanogaster and D. hydei indicate there
have been no gene losses within the complex since the
common ancestor of these species [20] suggesting that
all of the genes are functionally important and maintained by stabilizing selection. Therefore, the expansion
of the gene family may have been driven by selection
pressures for greater complexity and specificity of N signaling in different tissues [23].

With respect to regulatory structure, the E(spl)-C
genes are one of the best characterized loci in Drosophila. Although different members of the complex have
distinct patterns of gene expression, they share many
common features within their regulatory regions. The
majority of genes in the cluster are regulated by Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) and several proneural genes.
Numerous upstream cis-regulatory elements for these
proteins have been identified [24,25]. One regulatory
feature in particular, an inverted pair of Su(H) elements
separated by 17 basepairs (bp) and in close association
with a proneural binding site, appears to have strong
functional significance. This regulatory architecture
(termed a SPS+A element: Su(H) Paired Sites + proneural bHLH Activator binding site) resides upstream of
many genes in the complex and it’s relative location is
strongly conserved among Drosophila species [24,25].
SPS+A elements have also been found in other non-dipteran insects and in other genes unrelated to the Enhancer of split genes [25]. Functional assays indicate the
SPS+A element is a crucial component of the synergistic
signaling response mediated by Su(H), proneural proteins, and several co-repressors and activators [26-29].
Regulation of the E(spl)-complex is also affected by a
series of 3’ UTR motifs that are bound by micro-RNAs
(miRNAs) post-transcriptionally [30]. Similar to the cisregulatory elements, these motifs occur in the majority
of the E(spl)-C genes and exhibit strong conservation
among Drosophila species [12,16,31,32].
The E(spl)-complex is unusual among gene expansions
in that it involves the coordinated duplication of two
different types of genes that have no close paralogy, but
have functional overlap and share common regulatory
mechanisms. Several recent studies have examined the
evolutionary history of the complex [25,33,34] but have
focused primarily on non-dipteran taxa. The mosquito
species, Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti each contain a single homolog of the bHLH and Brd genes suggesting the expansion occurred after the split between
Nematocera and Brachycera. Comparison across the
Drosophila genomes indicates the gene composition and
much of the regulatory organization has remained stable
since the emergence of this genus, approximately 40-60
MYA. However, little is known about the structure and
regulatory content of the complex in dipteran species
that represent intermediate evolutionary steps between
Nematocera and Drosophila. This information is crucial
to understanding the evolutionary history of the complex and the selection pressures influencing its expansion. Therefore, using sequence data from several
fosmid clones from a genomic library, we reconstructed
the entire complex in the acalyptrate stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. In addition, we probed the recently
sequenced genome of the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans,

Baker et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:354

along with other dipterans with a well-represented EST
database, in order to reconstruct the history of the complex within schizophoran flies.

Methods
Study Organism

Teleopsis dalmanni is one of approximately 200 species
in the acalyptrate family Diopsidae. All species in the
family are characterized by the elongation of the head
into long stalks and many species, including T. dalmanni, are sexually dimorphic with respect to their eyestalks. Annotation of expressed sequence tag (EST)
libraries identified five contigs with significant homology
to E(spl)-C genes in Drosophila [35] and Comparative
Genomic Hybridization has placed all of these genes on
one of the two autosomes of T. dalmanni [36]. The
Acalyptratae is a large, derived group of flies that also
contains the families Drosophilidae and Tephritidae.
Relationships among acalyptrate families have proven
difficult to resolve, but in several analyses the Tephritidae and Diopsidae are closely related and share a common ancestor with Drosophila no more than 76 MYA
[37,38]. Alternatively, the Diopsidae were placed as the
basal acalyptrate lineage in a recent study, but this analysis was limited to mitochondrial genes [39]. Overall,
there is considerable debate concerning the monophyly
of the Acalyptratae [37-41], but a general consensus that
they are most closely related to the Calyptratae and
together form the Schizophora. This group contains
most of the well-studied dipteran species that do not
belong to the Nematocera, comprise roughly half of the
family-level diversity within Diptera, and are estimated
to have diverged 80-100 MYA [37]. Some studies
[38-40] have placed the Drosophilidae as closely related
to the Calyptratae within a paraphyletic Acalyptratae.
Fosmid Library Construction and Sequencing

A genomic library was constructed for T. dalmanni
using the CopyControl Fosmid Library Construction Kit
(Epicentre). These libraries accommodate inserts of
approximately 40 kilobases. Genomic DNA was prepared from 90 developing flies dissected from their
pupal case using a phenol/chloroform protocol previously applied to diopsids [42]. The flies were chosen
from a large, outbred population of T. dalmanni originally collected in 1999 near Ulu Gombak in peninsular
Malaysia and maintained at the University of Maryland.
The prep provided nearly 60 μg of total DNA, of which
20 μg was used to construct the library. The genomic
DNA was manually sheared using a syringe and ligated,
packaged and plated following the manufacturer’s protocol. Our library produced over 66,000 clones, thus providing approximately 4× coverage of the genome, which
is estimated to be 450 MB. All colonies were picked

Page 3 of 15

from bioassay plates using Q-bot automated colony
pickers (Genetix) and individually stored (at -70°) in
384-well plates. Restriction digest of 48 colonies using
KpnI indicated all but one of the clones contained
inserts between 30-40 kb.
Blast searches of ESTs generated from the developing
eye-antennal imaginal disc of T. dalmanni [35] identified homologs of five members of the E(spl)-complex–
mb, ma, m3, m4, m7–in Drosophila. Based on these
sequences, we designed primers for each gene (Additional file 1) in order to probe, using PCR, pooled aliquots of fosmid clones. Primers were also generated for
E(spl)m8 after initial sequencing of a fosmid clone containing E(spl)m7 provided the nucleotide sequence for
that gene. The pooling strategy we used combined all
samples from a single 384-well plate into one target
sample for PCR. A total of 171 plates were pooled in
this fashion. If the PCR for a given plate produced a
band for one of the E(spl)-C genes, we then pooled all
the wells for each row and column of that plate for a
second round of PCR. This round of PCR (involving 40
total reactions) identified the exact well location of the
fosmid clone containing the E(spl)-C gene. The general
reaction template of the PCR was 94°-2 m, (94°-30s, 52°30s and 72°-45s)× 35 cycles, and 72°-7 m. Overall, PCR
of the pooled fosmid plates identified 12 total fosmid
clones containing E(spl)-C genes and seven of these
were selected for sequencing. We generated a 3 kb subclone library for each selected fosmid by shearing the
fosmid into ~ 3 kb fragments using a Hydroshear device
(GeneMachines) and ligating the DNA into pUC18 vector. Colonies from the sub-cloned libraries were picked
from bioassay plates using a Q-bot and arrayed in 384well plates. All the clones from a single plate for each
fosmid were sequenced in both directions providing
approximately 10× coverage of the fosmid sequence.
Sequencing of the sub-clones was conducted at the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) using their standard rolling-circle amplification protocol http://www.jgi.doe.gov/
sequencing/protocols/prots_production.html. Quality
scores for the sequencing reads for each fosmid were
assigned to each base using Phred [43,44]. The reads
were assembled using Phrap [45] and manually curated
using Consed [46]. In a few cases, additional clones
from a sheared fosmid library were sequenced in order
to provide reads that spanned gaps between contigs in
the assembly. Fosmid contigs were assembled into a larger genomic contig using Phrap and Sequencher (GeneCodes). The assembled contig has been submitted to
Genbank under accession JN546230.
Evolutionary Analysis

Identification and annotation of the transcription units
within the T. dalmanni E(spl)-C genomic contig was

conducted by blasting (with Blastx) the entire contig
against the D. melanogaster NCBI protein database as
well as aligning the T. dalmanni EST sequences to the
genomic contig. We also performed syntenic comparison between the species using mVista [47,48]. In order
to identify homologs of E(spl)-C genes in other dipteran
species, we searched, using tBlastx, the NCBI EST database and Glossina morsitans supercontig database
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/
g_morsitans) for genes with strong similarity to T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster E(spl)-C genes. The G. morsitans sequence data were provided by the Glossina
morsitans group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
and can be obtained from maa@sanger.ac.uk. All ESTs
with a Blast hit lower than e-20 were placed in a
Sequencher folder and assembled together using a 95%
identity similarity cut-off. Consensus sequences for each
cluster were exported and translated into protein
sequences. For the E(spl)-C bHLH and Brd genes, we
aligned, using the Muscle alignment function [49] in the
Geneious analysis package [50], the protein sequences
from all E(spl)-C bHLH and Brd homologs for Bombyx
mori (outgroup), Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, G.
morsitans, T. dalmanni, Drosophila virilis, Drosophila
pseudoobscura, D. melanogaster and seven other dipteran species identified in the EST search. These include
the acalyptrate fruitfly Ceratitis capitata, two calyptrates–Haematobia irritans and the screw-worm fly
Cochliomyia hominivorax–and four nematoceran species–Lutzomyia longipalpis, Phlebotomus papatasi, Polypedilum vanderplanki and Rhynchosciara americana.
Phylogenetic relationships among these species are presented in Figure 1. A maximum likelihood tree was constructed from these aligned matrices (Additional file 2)

bootstrap replicates. Pairwise non-synonymous to
synonymous substitution ratios were calculated using
PAL2NAL [52].
In order to identify conserved regulatory domains, we
searched all non-coding DNA within the E(spl)-C complexes of T. dalmanni and G. morsitans for Su(H) binding sites (YGTGRGAA) and proneural A boxes
(RCAGSTG) [24]. An inverted pair of Su(H) sites with
an A box in close proximity constitutes the SPS+A
architecture found in many Drosophila E(spl)-C genes.
If this domain was found in any of the T. dalmanni or
G. morsitans genes, we extracted 200 bp of sequence
data on either side of the domain and aligned it to the
region containing the homologous SPS+A domain in
Drosophila using Dialign [53]. We also searched the 3’
UTR regions for the three conserved domains in Drosophila known to influence post-transcriptional regulation
[30-32]: the Brd box (AGCTTTA), GY box
(GTCTTCC), and K box (TGTGAT). For genes for
which we had EST sequence (in either T. dalmanni or
other non-Drosophila dipterans) the 3’ UTR region was
determined by the transcript sequence. For T. dalmanni
and G. morsitans genes for which there was genomic
sequence data, but not transcript sequence, we searched
1000 bp 3’ of the stop codon for that gene.

Results
The E(spl)-Complex in Teleopsis dalmanni and Glossina
morsitans

The seven T. dalmanni fosmids sequenced in this study
assembled into one primary contig spanning 145 kb that
contained a direct homolog of each of the E(spl)-C
genes found in Drosophila. Although spread out across
a larger region in T. dalmanni than D. melanogaster,
the organization of the complex in terms of gene order
and orientation is identical between the species (Figure
2a). One difference between the species is that T. dalmanni has an additional gene homologous to E(spl)m5
in Drosophila suggesting a recent duplication within
stalk-eyed flies. Pairwise comparison of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution rates between the duplicate copies (dN/dS = 0.088) did not indicate any signs
of positive selection operating on the genes following
duplication. Another difference between the species is
that, in Drosophila, the E(spl)-complex is adjacent to
groucho, a gene that is a Notch-mediated co-repressor
of E(spl)-C genes [54] and that has often been included
as a member of the complex [20,24]. In T. dalmanni,
however, the E(spl)-complex is adjacent to genes that
are homologous to anastral spindle 1 (ana1) and
CG5789 in D. melanogaster. These two genes are adjacent to each other and located on chromosome 3R
within 200 kb of the E(spl)-complex in D. melanogaster.
The percent identity scores for individual E(spl)-C genes

Baker et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:354

between T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster range from
75% (E(spl)mb) to 48% (E(spl)m8) among the bHLH
genes and from 57% (E(spl)ma) to 39% (E(spl)m6) for
the Brd genes (Figure 2b). There is little similarity in the
non-coding sequence data between the species although
there is a small region of conserved sequence data
between E(spl)mg and E(spl)mb (CNS1 in Figure 2b)
and upstream of E(spl)m3 (CNS2 in Figure 2b).
Homologs for most of the E(spl)-C genes (mδ, mg, mb,
m2, m4, m7, m8) were also found in G. morsitans indicating that the expansion of the gene complex is ancestral to the evolution of the Schizophora. All these genes
occurred in the same order and orientation as in D.
melanogaster and T. dalmanni. We were unable to
locate in the G. morsitans genomic contigs a full length
homolog for E(spl)ma, E(spl)m1, E(spl)m3, E(spl)m5,
and E(spl)m6. Both E(spl)m1 and E(spl)m6 are rapidly
evolving genes which may affect our ability to identify
the genes in G. morsitans, although a clear homolog of
E(spl)m1 (identity: 45%, blast score: 2e-34) was found in
the horn fly Haematobia irritans (Muscidae) suggesting
the gene was present in the acalyptrate-calyptrate ancestor. In the G. morsitans assembly, the intersection
between two supercontigs (0000482 and 0005687) spans
the region where E(spl)m5 should be located and one of
the contigs (0005687) contains a fragment with partial
similarity to E(spl)m5 genes in D. melanogaster (e-07)
and T. dalmanni (e-12). This fragment, however, lies
near the 5’ region of the gene and there is no upstream
start codon within the fragment’s open reading frame.
Similarly, E(spl)ma in G. morsitans is only a partial fragment of the gene but there is a string of Ns in the
supercontig (0000482) so the absence of the remaining
portion may result from an error in the contig assembly.
Additional sequence data is necessary to determine if E
(spl)ma and E(spl)m5 are functioning genes in G.
morsitans.

(bootstraps > 94%) and contains at least one calyptrate
and acalyptrate species. It is important to note that
absence of homologs for Ceratitis, Haematobia, and
Cochliomyia (e.g. E(spl)mδ) probably reflects the limitations of transcript sampling from EST studies and not
loss of these genes in these taxa.
Despite the clear differentiation among the individual
E(spl)-C genes, the relationships among them are not
well supported. Therefore, it is difficult to reconstruct
the pattern of gene duplication among the various
copies. E(spl)m8 and E(spl)m5 likely descended from a
single duplication event because homologs from these
genes comprise a strongly supported clade (100% bootstrap) but the pattern among the other genes suggests
that the expansion process was characterized by rapid
diversification followed by relative stasis. The phylogeny
also confirms the duplication event for E(spl)m5 in T.
dalmanni and further suggests that E(spl)m3 was lost in
G. morsitans because the two other calyptrates sampled
in the tree (Haematobia and Cochliomyia) contain
homologs of this gene.
The phylogeny for the Brd genes is presented in Figure 4. Closely related Brd genes that are not members
of the E(spl)-complex [16,30]–Tom, Ocho, Bearded–
were included in the analysis. Similar to the bHLH analysis, all the genes form relatively well-supported monophyletic clades and, with the exception of Bearded and
E(spl)m6, contain at least one calyptrate and acalyptrate
species. The relationships among the genes is not well
supported although there is some support (77% bootstrap) for a sister relationship between E(spl)ma and E
(spl)m4. In addition, the gene family as a whole is not
monophyletic in this tree (Ocho and E(spl)m4 are sister
to the nematoceran species rather than their paralogs in
other schizophoran species) but these relationships are
supported by bootstraps less than 10%.
Conservation of SPS+A binding sites

Evolution of E(spl)-complex within Diptera

In order to examine the evolutionary history of the
complex within Diptera we obtained all E(spl)-C homologs from several dipteran species whose genomes have
been sequenced and from seven additional species for
which EST data was available (Figure 1). Sequence from
the silkmoth Bombyx mori was used as the outgroup.
Phylogenetic analysis of all the bHLH genes aligned
together is presented in Figure 3. This tree clearly
demonstrates that the expansion of the E(spl)-complex
occurred after the split between Nematocera-Brachycera
and before the diversification of the Schizophora. All
the nematoceran species contain a single E(spl)-C bHLH
homolog that cluster in a monophyletic clade that is
basal to the other taxa. Each of the clades representing
the individual E(spl)-C genes is well supported

An inverted pair of Su(H) binding sites spaced 17 bp
apart with a proneural activation site (A box) in close
proximity constitutes the SPS+A regulatory architecture
that has been found in the upstream regulatory
sequence of numerous E(spl)-C genes and that plays an
important role in the regulatory control of these genes
[24,27,28,55]. Some genes have slight variants on this
architecture involving either smaller spacing between
the Su(H) site or the lack of a proneural box near the
Su(H) pair. A search of the T. dalmanni and G. morsitans contigs for both Su(H) sites and proneural boxes
identified several domains conserved between these species and D. melanogaster (Figure 5). Overall, T. dalmanni contained seven SPS+A domains and four SPS
pairs without an associated proneural box and there was
stronger conservation between T. dalmanni and D.

There is no associated A box in this conserved region,
or near the SPS pair in either species. Neither the protein coding gene nor the upstream regulatory region for
E(spl)m3 were found in G. morsitans.
In addition to the CNS1 location, E(spl)mδ, E(spl)mg,
E(spl)m7 and E(spl)m8 contain SPS+A domains conserved between T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster. In T.
dalmanni, the E(spl)mδ, E(spl)mg, E(spl)m7 and E(spl)
m8 domains are located 4970 bp, 553 bp, 469 bp and
338 bp respectively, upstream of the gene’s start codon
compared to 1419 bp, 353 bp, 761 bp, and 275 bp in D.
melanogaster. The pair of Su(H) sites in E(spl)mδ is
separated by 15 bp rather than the typical 17 bp (Figure
5), a feature also shared by Drosophila species [24,25].
The length conservation between T. dalmanni and D.
melanogaster suggest this spacing has functional significance and is under stabilizing selection. G. morsitans
does not appear to contain a SPS architecture in E(spl)

mδ and, for E(spl)mg, there is an inverted pair of Su(H)
sites but they are separated by only 7 bp. For E(spl)m7,
both T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster have a pair of Su
(H) sites with a relatively distant A box (232 bp in T.
dalmanni and 405 bp in D. melanogaster). G. morsitans
has a mutation (a deletion) in the first Su(H) binding
site that violates the consensus sequence and no A box
between the Su(H) site and the start of the gene. All
three species have a conserved SPS+A module (with two
A boxes on either side of the Su(H) pair) in E(spl)m8. E
(spl)m4 has a SPS module conserved between T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster but the A box present in D.
melanogaster is missing from T. dalmanni. In T. dalmanni, because of the inverted orientation of the E(spl)
m5 duplication, a single SPS+A domain lies upstream of
both genes.
The SPS+A configuration was originally defined as not
only having the inverted pairs of Su(H) sites separated
by 17 bp, but also having a T in the “Y” position of the

with sequence degeneracy relative to the canonical
structure can still drive expression [56].

upstream Su(H) site and a C in this position in the
downstream site [13,24]. Two Drosophila genes–E(spl)
mb and E(spl)m5–contained SPS pairs that have a C in
the “Y” position of the upstream site but they also have
spacer regions that differ from the typical 17 bp suggesting these domains may not be fully functional SPS+A
pairs and that the C resulted from relaxed functional
constraints [24,25]. One noteworthy feature of the T.
dalmanni enhancer elements is the high occurrence of
paired Su(H) sites with the canonical 17 bp spacing that
have a C in the “Y” position of the upstream Su(H)
sites. Four genes–E(spl)mb, E(spl)ma, E(spl)m2 and E
(spl)m5–have SPS modules with this nucleotide
sequence and two of these–E(spl)m2 and E(spl)m5–also
have an associated A box (Figure 5). This pattern suggests that the T nucleotide in the “Y” position of the
upstream site may not be a requirement of a fully

species while the fifth gene, E(spl)m3, may be conserved
between these groups but the available calyptrate EST,
from H. irritans, contains only 100 bp of nucleotide
sequence downstream of the conserved GY box (Figure
6). Three of the genes that are not fully conserved
across the species–E(spl)mδ, E(spl)m4, and E(spl)m5–
still have several domains in common. E(spl)mb and E
(spl)m7 are the two genes that exhibit no similarity in 3’

Discussion
Evolution of E(spl)-complex gene structure and
organization

Despite widespread study of the developmental genetics
of the E(spl)-complex in Drosophila [10-17], there is little consensus about the evolutionary pressures responsible for the origin and maintenance of this gene
expansion. Overall, the genes appear to be partially
redundant such that they can compensate for the loss of
one member of the complex, but they also all have
gene-specific expression patterns suggesting redundancy
alone is not sufficient to explain their evolution
[10,21,22]. It has been proposed that the presence of
efficient post-transcription regulation mediated by the
interaction between the 3’ UTR domains and miRNAs
facilitated duplication by minimizing the impact of deleterious gain-of-function effects that are likely to result
from the duplication events [31]. This hypothesis provides a mechanism for the initial stability of the gene
expansion but does not explain the fixation of the various copies or the selection pressures that maintain
their evolutionary conservation. Understanding the functional role of this complex in Drosophila provides only
partial information needed to explain its evolution. It is
also necessary to identify when the various gene expansions occurred and what phenotypic modifications arose
concurrently with the duplication events. In this study,
we begin to address this issue by reconstructing the E
(spl)-complex in a stalk-eyed fly and identifying homologs for every member of the complex among several
calyptrate species. These data clearly establish that the E
(spl)-complex expanded in entirety at or before the origin of the schizophoran lineage and has exhibited
remarkable conservation since that time.
At three levels of gene organization–amino acids,
promoter Su(H) binding sites, and 3’ UTR domains–
there is strong conservation among the orthologs from
different species but little hierarchical signal among
the paralogous copies. There are numerous molecular
features that identify a gene sequence from a given
species as belonging to a specific E(spl)-C gene, but
less information about how these genes are related to

Page 11 of 15

each other. This weak phylogenetic signal among the
members of the complex suggests that the expansion
occurred rapidly and it is possible that we will find no
species that have an intermediate stage of the expansion for the complex. This pattern of punctuated
duplication [57], does not appear to fit a classic birth/
death model of gene expansion [58], although we do
not currently have sufficient sampling of the entire
complex from enough species to evaluate this statistically. However, it is clear there have been no changes
in the complex during the 40-60 MY since the formation of Drosophila and going back to the base of the
Schizophora we only have evidence of the loss of E
(spl)m3 in G. morsitans and the gain of an additional
copy of E(spl)m5 in T. dalmanni. It is important to
note that the lack of additional copies of a given E
(spl)-C gene for taxa with EST data (that would indicate lineage specific duplication) is not an artifact of
our search methodology because in nearly all cases a
Blast search using a single E(spl)-C protein from T.
dalmanni or D. melanogaster was sufficient to return
all the paralogs of a given type (i.e. bHLH or Brd) that
were available for a species. For instance, blasting with
E(spl)mg returned hits for all five bHLH genes of C.
hominivorax included in Figure 3.
Some studies [25,34] have argued that E(spl)mb is the
original bHLH gene (and E(spl)ma is the original Brd
gene) because it has the highest amino acid similarity to
the single copy bHLH gene in Nematocera and the
orientation of E(spl)mb and E(spl)ma mirrors the bHLH
and Brd gene orientation in Nematocera. The orientation is suggestive of an orthologous relationship but
protein similarity is not necessarily indicative of a basal
status. There are numerous reasons, such as relaxed stabilizing selection or multiple duplications and divergence operating on the original source paralog, to
explain why the original copy would not have the highest protein similarity to genes in species without the
duplicated copies. In our tree, E(spl)mδ is the basal gene
in the tree but this should not be taken as evidence that
E(spl)mδ is the direct ortholog of the nematoceran gene.
First, the relationships among the genes in the tree are
not well supported so it is difficult to be confident in
the basal position of E(spl)mδ. Second, even if the tree
was well supported, a basal position on the tree only
indicates that E(spl)mδ was part of the original duplication event not that it is the direct ortholog of the nematoceran bHLH gene. For instance, the tree is consistent
with a scenario in which E(spl)m3 is the original copy,
duplicates and produce E(spl)mδ, duplicates again to
produce E(spl)mg and so on, as the source of all the
duplication events other than the E(spl)m5 - E(spl)m8
split. Unless a species is discovered that has two bHLH
and two Brd genes (i.e. represents the initial duplication

Baker et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:354
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/354

events) it is unlikely we will unambiguously identify the
original E(spl)-C genes.
Regardless of the origination source, the diversification
and subsequent stability of the E(spl)-C genes suggest
they have strong functional significance. The evolution
of schizophoran flies is characterized by an increase in
the stereotype patterning of large sensory bristles on the
notum called macrochaetes [59]. These structures are
absent from nematoceran flies, but are arranged in various array patterns in the Schizophora [59-61]. Given
the phylogenetic origin of the E(spl)-complex demonstrated in this study and the role of these genes in bristle formation, it is tempting to speculate that selection
pressures related to the sensory input provided by
macrochaetes was a primary factor driving the diversification of genes in this complex. The Achaete-Scute
complex, which contains the genes directly controlling
bristle development in the SOP and which are repressed
by E(spl)-complex genes in adjacent cells, is also
thought to have diversified by a series of gene duplications in the dipteran lineage leading to Drosophila after
the split with the Nematocera [34,62]. Therefore, it is
essential for additional studies to probe the genomes
and transcriptomes of several orthorraphous brachyceran species that are phylogenetically intermediate
between the Nematocera and Schizophora. Given sufficient taxonomic sampling, we might be able to uncover
an interspecific correlation between the evolution of
bristle morphology and the origin and diversification of
gene content and regulatory structure within the E(spl)complex. Attempts to connect phenotypic variation with
genetic variation at E(spl)-C loci at the intraspecific level
have proven to be difficult [63,64], so a comparative
approach may be more fruitful.
Evolution of E(spl)-complex regulatory DNA

The E(spl)-complex represents one of the most well
characterized regulatory systems in Drosophila and
functional analysis has highlighted the importance of
upstream SPS+A architecture in the regulation of E
(spl)-C genes [11,27-29,65]. Examination of the SPS+A
organization in the Teleopsis E(spl)-complex revealed
strong conservation with Drosophila indicating the functional significance of these modules. The regulatory
sequence of Teleopsis also points to some novel features
of the SPS+A organization including the identification
of a highly conserved SPS+A module in both species
(CNS 1) that has not previously been identified in Drosophila. E(spl)-C genes are noteworthy for the proximity
of the enhancer elements that regulate their gene
expression to the promoter sites of these genes. Transgenic constructs comprising relatively small regions of
regulatory sequences (.5 - 2 kb) are generally sufficient
to recapitulate gene-specific expression patterns [10].

Page 12 of 15

Given this organization, the identification of the strongly
conserved SPS+A module downstream of both E(spl)mg
and E(spl)mb is unexpected. That this module also exhibits complete conservation at the nucleotide level in the
regions spanning the two S binding sites and the A
binding site across Drosophila, Teleopsis and Glossina
(Figure 5) suggests that it plays a critical role in the regulation of E(spl)-C genes. Functional studies in Drosophila are necessary to determine whether this module
affects the expression of one or multiple genes within
the complex. In addition, sequence comparison of SPS
+A modules across multiple Drosophila species revealed
elevated levels of nucleotide conservation in the regions
between and adjacent to the paired S sites for several E
(spl)-C genes [25]. This pattern suggests these nucleotides may serve some functional role beyond providing
proper spacing between binding sites. Because of its
extreme conservation, the SPS+A module identified in
CNS1 provides an ideal experimental system to investigate the regulatory significance of this DNA and its
potential impact on species-level expression differences.
In addition to CNS1, the Teleopsis sequence revealed
two additional paired S sites, upstream of E(spl)ma and
E(spl)m2, that are not present in Drosophila, with the
latter belonging to the SPS+A class (Figure 5). Both
genes contain single upstream S sites in Drosophila.
Sampling of E(spl)-C regulatory sequence from additional taxa will be necessary to determine whether the
paired orientation was gained in the lineage leading to
Teleopsis or lost in Drosophila. A recent study in Drosophila [29] showed that experimental manipulation of
SPS+A regulatory organization from a paired to a single
S site, and vice versa, can reverse the transcriptional
dynamics of genes downstream of these sites. The proneural gene achaete contains a single S site and expression of the gene is repressed in the presence of Notch
signaling. When the regulatory organization is altered to
contain a paired S site module, transcription is activated
in the presence of Notch signaling. Conversely, E(spl)m8,
which contains the SPS+A module and is normally activated by Notch, is repressed by Notch when one of the
S sites is removed. Therefore, understanding the precise
evolutionary sequence of gains and losses in S binding
domains is critical for interpreting the functional significance of E(spl)-C regulatory architecture in Drosophila.
As with the SPS modules, there is strong conservation
of 3’ UTR domain organization between Teleopsis and
Drosophila. Several genes, such as E(spl)mg, E(spl)ma, E
(spl)m3 and E(spl)m8, have diverged very little since the
split between calyptrate and acalyptrate flies but others,
such as E(spl)m4 and E(spl)m7, have several lineage-specific domains [30]. How these differences in the evolutionary stability of 3’ UTR DNA correlates with
phenotypic variation is unclear. Despite a wealth of

Baker et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:354
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/354

research in the past decade on the biology of miRNAs
that bind to these UTR domains (see [66,67] for
reviews), little is known about the functional consequences of variation in domain organization. This limitation, combined with a lack of expression data for E
(spl)-C genes in any fly species other than D. melanogaster, makes it difficult to speculate on the evolutionary
significance of differences in 3’ UTR DNA across species
and E(spl)-C paralogs. A recent study in C. elegans has
demonstrated that multiple UTR domains from a single
gene group together into discrete modules that operate
in a combinatorial manner to repress gene expression
[68]. It is possible that a similar process exists for the E
(spl)-C genes, but additional comparative studies on the
3’ UTR domain structure and the expression patterns of
different genes in various tissues are needed to uncover
the regulatory logic utilized by this complex.

Conclusions
The E(spl) complex in Drosophila comprises several
bHLH and Bearded genes that function in neurogenesis
as negative regulators of the Notch signaling pathway.
Comparison with mosquitoes indicates the complex
arose after the split between nematoceran and brachyceran dipterans but details on the precise pattern of gene
family expansion remains unclear. Here, we reconstruct
the entire complex in the acalyptrate stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni, and combine this data with EST and
genomic sequence data from several other species to
demonstrate that the complex arose in entirety prior to
the diversification of schizophoran flies. Phylogenetic
relationships among the various paralogs in both gene
families suggest the history of the complex is characterized by rapid duplication and diversification followed by
relative stasis. Strong conservation is also evident among
both the 5’ and 3’ regulatory domains. Comparison of
non-coding E(spl)-C DNA between Teleopsis and Drosophila revealed a previously unidentified, highly conserved
SPS+A domain between E(spl)mg and E(spl)mb that presumably has strong functional significance, as well as
other canonical SPS domains not present in Drosophila.
The pattern of gene expansion for the E(spl) complex is
consistent with a role in the evolution of stereotypical
macrochaete bristle patterning but additional studies are
needed to demonstrate a clear association between E
(spl)-C diversification and bristle evolution.
