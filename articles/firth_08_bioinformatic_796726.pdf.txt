Abstract
Background: The genus Orbivirus includes several species that infect livestock – including
Bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV). These viruses have linear dsRNA
genomes divided into ten segments, all of which have previously been assumed to be
monocistronic.
Results: Bioinformatic evidence is presented for a short overlapping coding sequence (CDS) in the
Orbivirus genome segment 9, overlapping the VP6 cistron in the +1 reading frame. In BTV, a 77–79
codon AUG-initiated open reading frame (hereafter ORFX) is present in all 48 segment 9
sequences analysed. The pattern of base variations across the 48-sequence alignment indicates that
ORFX is subject to functional constraints at the amino acid level (even when the constraints due
to coding in the overlapping VP6 reading frame are taken into account; MLOGD software). In fact
the translated ORFX shows greater amino acid conservation than the overlapping region of VP6.
The ORFX AUG codon has a strong Kozak context in all 48 sequences. Each has only one or two
upstream AUG codons, always in the VP6 reading frame, and (with a single exception) always with
weak or medium Kozak context. Thus, in BTV, ORFX may be translated via leaky scanning. A long
(83–169 codon) ORF is present in a corresponding location and reading frame in all other Orbivirus
species analysed except Saint Croix River virus (SCRV; the most divergent). Again, the pattern of
base variations across sequence alignments indicates multiple coding in the VP6 and ORFX reading
frames.
Conclusion: At ~9.5 kDa, the putative ORFX product in BTV is too small to appear on most
published protein gels. Nonetheless, a review of past literature reveals a number of possible
detections. We hope that presentation of this bioinformatic analysis will stimulate an attempt to
experimentally verify the expression and functional role of ORFX, and hence lead to a greater
understanding of the molecular biology of these important pathogens.

Background

The Orbivirus genus is one of ≥12 genera within the family
Reoviridae. The Reoviridae have segmented linear dsRNA
genomes. There are 9–12 segments [1] and these are usually, but not always, monocistronic. Subgenomic RNAs
are unknown. Orbivirus genomes have 10 segments. Many

species infect ruminants while some infect humans.
Transmission is via arthropods – including midges, ticks
and mosquitoes. The type species is Bluetongue virus
(BTV) which causes severe and sometimes fatal disease,
particularly in sheep. BTV is endemic in many tropical
countries, but there have also been recent outbreaks in

Europe [2,3]. Another species is African horse sickness
virus (AHSV) which is a fatal disease of horses. AHSV is
endemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, but has
made incursions into Europe [4]. Recent outbreaks of BTV
in Europe may be a consequence of climate change –
allowing the midge vectors to expand their range [5].
The Orbivirus proteins, structure, assembly and replication
have been reviewed in [6-8]. The BTV core is composed of
two major proteins (VP3 and VP7). Transcription complexes – composed of three minor proteins (VP1 –
polymerase, VP4 – capping enzyme, and VP6 – helicase)
are located inside the core. Transcription occurs within
the intact core and full-length capped mRNAs from each
of the genome segments are fed out into the cytoplasm for
translation. An outer capsid (VP2 and VP5) surrounds the
core, but is removed during cell entry. There are four nonstructural proteins – NS1, NS2 and NS3/3A. VP6 is a
hydrophilic, basic protein that binds dsRNA and other
nucleic acids and functions as the viral helicase [9-13]. In
some, but not all, BTV serotypes, VP6 migrates as a
closely-spaced doublet [14]. This is apparently due to the
fact that in these serotypes the first VP6 AUG codon has
weak Kozak context while a second in-frame AUG codon
has medium context.
The genomes of RNA viruses are under strong selective
pressure to compress maximal coding and regulatory
information into minimal sequence space. Thus overlapping CDSs are particularly common in such viruses. Such
CDSs can be difficult to detect using conventional genefinding software [15], especially when short. The software
package MLOGD, however, was designed specifically for
locating short overlapping CDSs in sequence alignments
and overcomes many of the difficulties with alternative
methods [15,16]. MLOGD includes explicit models for
sequence evolution in double-coding regions as well as
models for single-coding and non-coding regions. It can
be used to predict whether query ORFs are likely to be
coding, via a likelihood ratio test, where the null model
comprises any known CDSs and the alternative model
comprises the known CDSs plus the query ORF. MLOGD
has been tested extensively using thousands of known
virus CDSs as a test set, and it has been shown that, for
overlapping CDSs, a total of just 20 independent base variations are sufficient to detect a new CDS with ~90% confidence.
Using MLOGD, we recently identified – and subsequently
experimentally verified – a new short CDS in the Potyviridae that overlaps the polyprotein cistron but is translated
in the +2 reading frame [17]. When we applied MLOGD
to the Orbivirus genome we also found evidence for a short
CDS overlapping the VP6 cistron. Here we describe the
bioinformatic analysis.

Results
Identification in BTV using MLOGD
The putative new CDS, ORFX, was first identified in a BTV
sequence alignment, using MLOGD. In the RefSeq [GenBank: NC_006008] (1049 nt), ORFX has coords 182..415
(77 codons) and therefore is completely contained within
the VP6 cistron (16..1005), overlapping it in the +1 reading frame (Figure 1). When applied to an alignment of 48
BTV sequences (see Methods; pairwise divergences ≤0.21
base variations per nucleotide and total alignment divergence ~0.77 independent base variations per column in
the ORFX region), MLOGD detected a strong coding signature for ORFX (Figures 2, 3). There are ~180 independent base variations across the alignment in the ORFX
region, thus providing MLOGD with a robust signal. Formally, and within the MLOGD model, p < 10-40. Indeed
Figure 2 shows four non-overlapping – and hence completely independent – positively scoring windows in the
ORFX region. Moreover, the MLOGD results showed that,
within the ORFX region, ORFX is more conserved at the
amino acid level than VP6 (Figure 2). Finally, inspection
of the MLOGD output showed that the ORF is present in
all of the 48 sequences (i.e. no premature termination
codons; Figure 2).
Nucleotide sequence analysis in BTV
In the 48-sequence BTV alignment (not shown), one can
observe the following:

• The ORFX AUG initiation codon is present in all 48
sequences and is at the same location in the alignment. All
have 'G' at +4; 46/48 have 'A' at -3 and 2/48 have 'G' at 3, giving the ORFX AUG codon a strong Kozak context
[18].
• As far as amino acid constraints in the VP6 reading frame
are concerned, there is no reason for the ORFX AUG
codon to be conserved. In every sequence, the overlapping
VP6-frame codons are gAU_Ggu. GAU codes for Asp, but
Asp could also be encoded by GAC.
• Many sequences contain ORFX-frame termination
codons just two codons 5' of the AUG codon. Thus initiation of ORFX at an upstream non-AUG codon, or via other
non-canonical mechanisms, appears unlikely.
• ORFX is always in the +1 frame relative to the VP6 reading frame.
• The length of ORFX is 77 aa in 44/48 sequences (UAG
termination codon) and 79 aa in 4/48 sequences (UAA
termination codon). The alignment is gap-free within
ORFX.

Genome map for BTV
Genome map for BTV. The putative new coding sequence – ORFX – is located on segment 9 (RNA9), in the +1 reading
frame relative to the overlapping VP6 cistron. Molecular masses are based on the unmodified amino acid sequences.

• All AUG codons upstream of the ORFX AUG codon are
in the VP6 reading frame. There are a maximum of two
upstream AUG codons in any given sequence, and the
Kozak contexts of the upstream AUG codons are nearly
always weak or medium (Table 1).

AHSV: AUG1 (weak) in VP6 frame. AUG2 (strong) in
ORFX frame. AUG[3-10] also in ORFX frame.

• There is only a single AUG codon (in a single sequence)
in the purine-rich ~70 nt region (Figure 4) directly
upstream of the ORFX AUG codon.

PHSV: AUG1 (weak) in VP6 frame. AUG2 (medium) in
ORFX frame (1 codon ORF). AUG3 (medium) in +2
frame (10 codon ORF). AUG4 (weak) and AUG5 (strong)
in ORFX frame. AUG[6-7] also in ORFX frame.

Nucleotide sequence analysis in other Orbivirus RefSeqs
The five non-BTV Orbivirus GenBank RefSeqs (see Methods) were inspected for a long ORF in the same location
and reading frame as ORFX relative to the annotated VP6
CDS. Such an ORF was found in all RefSeqs except SCRV
(Figure 5). The ORFX lengths are 143, 111, 113 and 83
codons in, respectively, AHSV, PHSV, YUOV and PALV.
We propose (see Discussion) that ORFX is not present in
SCRV. The following AUG codons are (potentially) used
in the various RefSeqs (Kozak contexts – in parantheses –
are assumed to be 'strong' if there is 'G' at +4 and an 'A' or
'G' at -3, 'medium' if one of these is present, and 'weak' if
neither are present):

BTV: AUG1 (weak) and AUG2 (medium) in VP6 frame.
AUG3 (strong) in ORFX frame. AUG[4-10] also in ORFX
frame.

PALV: AUG1 (weak) in VP6 frame. AUG2 (strong) in
ORFX frame. AUG[3-7] also in ORFX frame.

YUOV: AUG1 (weak) in VP6 frame. AUG2 (medium) in
ORFX frame (1 codon ORF). AUG3 (medium) in +2
frame (21 codon ORF; overlaps AUG4 [strong; +2 frame]
and AUG5 [medium; VP6 frame]). AUG6 (medium),
AUG7 (strong), AUG8 (strong) and AUG9 (medium) in
ORFX frame.
SCRV: AUG1 (medium) and AUG2 (strong) in VP6 frame.
AUG3 (medium) in ORFX frame (1 codon ORF). AUG4
(medium), AUG5 (strong) and AUG6 (strong) in VP6
frame. AUG7 (weak) and AUG8 (strong) in ORFX frame
(ORFXa; Figure 5). AUG9 (weak) and AUG10 (weak) in
ORFX frame (ORFXb; Figure 5).
MLOGD analysis of ORFX coding potential
MLOGD can not be used effiectively on an alignment of
the six RefSeqs because the pairwise divergences are too

MLOGD statistics for the alignment of 48 BTV sequences. The input alignment comprised a CLUSTALW [39] alignment of the VP6 amino acid sequences only, back-translated to nucleotide sequences. (1) The positions of alignment gaps in
each of the 48 sequences. In fact most of the alignment is ungapped, though a few sequences are incomplete. (2)–(4) The positions of stop codons in each of the 48 sequences in each of the three forward reading frames. Note the conserved absence of
stop codons in the +0 frame (i.e. the VP6 CDS) and in the +1 frame in the ORFX region. (5)–(8) MLOGD sliding-window
plots. Window size = 20 codons. Step size = 10 codons. Each window is represented by a small circle (showing the likelihood
ratio score for that window), and grey bars showing the width (ends) of the window. See [16] for further details of the
MLOGD software. In (5)–(6) the null model, in each window, is that the sequence is non-coding, while the alternative model
is that the sequence is coding in the window frame. Positive scores favour the alternative model. There is a strong coding signature in the +0 frame (5) throughout the VP6 CDS, except where the VP6 CDS overlaps ORFX. In this region there is a
strong coding signature in the +1 frame (6) indicating that ORFX is subject to stronger functional constraints than the overlapping section of VP6. In (7)–(8) the null model, in each window, is that only the VP6 frame is coding, while the alternative model
is that both the VP6 frame and the window frame are coding. Only the +1 (7) and +2 (8) frames are shown because the +0
frame is the VP6 frame which is included in the null model. Scores are generally negative with occasional random scatter into
low positive scores, except for the ORFX region which has consecutive high-positively scoring windows (7). Note that there
are four non-overlapping – and hence completely independent – positively scoring windows in the ORFX region (7). Formally,
and within the MLOGD model, p < 10-40. (9) Genome map for the reference sequence [GenBank: NC_006008]. (10) Phylogenetically summed sequence divergence (mean number of base variations per nucleotide) for the sequences that contribute to
the statistics at each position in the alignment. In any particular column, some sequences may be omitted from the statistical
calculations due to alignment gaps. Statistics in regions with lower summed divergence (i.e. partially gapped regions) have a
lower signal-to-noise ratio.

MLOGD statistics for BTV, AHSV, PALV and PHSV/YUOV alignments. Output plots from MLOGD used in the
'Test Query CDS' mode, applied to the ORFX region in BTV, AHSV, PALV and PHSV/YUOV sequence alignments. See [16] for
full details of the MLOGD software. The null model comprises the VP6 CDS and the query CDS is ORFX. In each plot, the top
panel displays the raw log(LR) statistics at each alignment position. There is a separate track for each reference – non-reference sequence pair (labelled at the right, together with the pairwise divergences; albeit not legible for the BTV alignment since
it contains so many – i.e. 48 – sequences). Stop codons (of which there are none except 3' terminal ones) in each of the VP6
and ORFX reading frames, and alignment gaps for each sequence, are marked on the appropriate tracks. The second panel displays the Σtree log(LR) statistic at each alignment position, where 'tree' represents a phylogenetic tree – see [16]. The third and
fourth panels display sliding window means of the statistics in the first and second panels, respectively. The fifth panel shows
the locations of the null and alternative model CDSs (i.e. VP6 and ORFX, respectively). The sixth panel shows the summed
mean sequence divergence (base variations per alignment nt column) for the sequence pairs that contribute to the Σtree log(LR)
statistic at each alignment position. This is a measure of the information available at each alignment position (e.g. partially
gapped regions have lower summed mean sequence divergence). The predominantly positive values in the fourth panel indicate
that ORFX is subject to functional constraints, at the amino acid level, over the majority of its length.

two most-closely related of the six RefSeqs and are not too

[Genbank:NC_007664] (YUOV), there were 32 amino
acid identities in ORFX while, in the corresponding region
of VP6, there were only 22 amino acid identities.

Discussion

Analysis of the ORFX peptide sequence
Application of blastp [19] to the ORFX peptide sequences
for the six RefSeqs revealed no similar amino acid
sequences in GenBank (14 Mar 2008), while tblastn identified only the ORFX region in other Orbivirus sequences
(as expected). Application of InterProScan [20] to the six
sequences returned no hits (protein motifs, domains etc).

Due to the segmented nature of their genomes, the Reoviridae may escape a fundamental problem that many other
eukaryotic viruses face – how to circumvent the host cell's
general rule of 'one functional protein per mRNA'. Nonetheless, of the 352 Reoviridae RefSeqs in GenBank (10 Mar
2008; 33 species × 9–12 segments per species), ~5% are
multicistronic. Among these are a few examples of fully
overlapping genes apparently translated via leaky scanning, for example in Phytoreovirus segment S12 or S9 [21]
and mammalian Orthoreovirus segment S1 [22,23].

The ORFX amino acid sequence appears to have greater
amino acid conservation than the overlapping region of
the VP6 CDS (e.g. Figure 2). In a comparison between
[Genbank:NC_006008] and three divergent BTV
sequences – [Genbank:DQ289044], [Genbank:D10905]
and [Genbank:DQ825671], all three showed greater
amino acid conservation (relative to NC_006008) in the
ORFX frame than in the VP6 frame in the ORFX region.
Specifically, there was respectively 87%, 78% and 100%
amino acid identity in the ORFX frame, but only 58%,
73% and 83% identity in the VP6 frame. Similarly, in a
comparison of [Genbank:NC_007753] (PHSV) with

For optimal leaky scanning [24], one would expect the
VP6 CDS to initiate at AUG1 with weak context and ORFX
to initiate at AUG2 with strong context. This indeed is the
situation in the AHSV and PALV RefSeqs. Although there
are two upstream VP6-frame AUG codons in many BTV
serotypes, leaky scanning still appears fairly straightforward in this virus as a translational mechanism for ORFX
(though potentially at a much lower abundance than
VP6). In the YUOV and PHSV RefSeqs, leaky scanning
may be possible, but requires scanning through or translation and reinitiation of two upstream short ORFs. It is
interesting, and possibly relevant, that in another Reoviri-

dae species – Avian reovirus – a novel, as yet not fully
understood, scanning-independent ribosome migration
mechanism is used to bypass two upstream CDSs in order
to translate the 3'-proximal CDS on the tricistronic S1
mRNA [25,26].
IRESs have not been reported in the Reoviridae and, at this
genomic location, use of an IRES would seem unlikely.
However, it has been shown that a variety of poly-purine
A-rich sequences – such as (GAAA)16 – can serve as efficient IRESs without the requirement for a complex RNA
secondary structure such as in the Picornaviridae IRESs
[27], so it is interesting to note that there is an A-rich polypurine tract just upstream of ORFX in all species except
SCRV (Figure 4). In the BTV RefSeq, for example, the 68 nt
immediately preceding ORFX comprise 32 A, 7 C, 25 G
and 4 U nucleotides. In fact the entire sequences (except
SCRV) are A- or AG-rich (Table 3). Nonetheless the region
just upstream of ORFX is a peak in A-richness (Figure 4).
Admittedly, this could be due to many other reasons (e.g.

frequencies for the six Orbivirus segment 9 RefSeqs in GenBank.

just amino acid coding constraints in VP6) and there is no
strong reason to suspect an IRES here.
SCRV lacks a long ORF in the correct reading frame and
location for an ORFX homologue. The number (six) and
contexts (3 are strong) of upstream AUG codons make
conventional leaky scanning to 'ORFXa' (38 codons; Figure 5) extremely unlikely. It is quite possible, therefore,
that no ORFX homologue is present in SCRV. This is not
too surprising – SCRV segment 9 is the most divergent,
and the shortest, of the six RefSeqs (Figure 5) [28]. SCRV
is also the only species of the six which is tick-borne
instead of insect-borne (BTV, AHSV and PALV are transmitted by midges; YUOV by mosquitoes).
At ~9.5 kDa, the putative ORFX product in BTV is too
small to appear on most published protein gels. Nonetheless there are unidentified low molecular mass bands in a
number of reported gels [29-32], often running near the
dye front, that may represent ORFX product. Furthermore,
ref. [33] (in vitro translation of the individual segments)
noted, with reference to excluded data, that segment 9
may encode a low molecular weight protein in addition to
VP6.
The ORFX product is largest in AHSV (~17 kDa in [GenBank:NC_006019] and ~20 kDa in [GenBank:U19881]).
Ref. [34] (in vitro translation of the individual AHSV segments, and comparison with proteins extracted from
infected cell lysate) clearly identified an additional nonstructural protein translated from segment 9 – termed

Page 8 of 10

Virology Journal 2008, 5:48

'NS3' – migrating ~1.5 kDa behind the 'NS4/4A' proteins
(equivalent to NS3/3A in our notation) translated from
segment 10. 'NS3' is a good candidate for ORFX product
migrating a little slower than expected, possibly as a result
of post-translational modification. The protein labelled
'VP6' in ref. [34] appears to be a truncated version of VP5
(translated from the same segment as VP5, and both were
shown to have similar partial protease digestion products). Interestingly the VP6 protein (our notation) is not
visible as a product of segment 9 translation in Fig. 6 of
ref. [34], but may be visible in Fig. 7 of ref. [34] (migrating
next to NS2), unless this is cross-contamination. An additional segment 9 product (~20 kDa), migrating ahead of
'NS4/4A', is also visible (albeit fainter) in Fig. 7 of ref.
[34]. If the 'NS3' band is post-translationally modified
ORFX product, then this band could be unmodified ORFX
product.
Ref. [35] also identified a number of low molecular mass
proteins in AHSV-infected cells – in particular P23, P20
and P21. Ref. [35] equated two of these (P20 and P21) to
the segment 10 products NS3/3A (~24/~22 kDa in
AHSV). The third protein may be ORFX product.
In addition to its small size, the fact that ORFX product
has not been widely reported suggests that it may be
present only in low abundance and/or only expressed at
certain stages (e.g. only in the insect vector) or cellular
locations.

Conclusion
We have identified a conserved ORF (ORFX) overlapping
the Orbivirus VP6 CDS in the +1 reading frame. ORFX
ranges from 77–169 codons in length, depending on species, and is present in all Orbivirus segment 9 sequences
analysed except for the highly divergent species SCRV. The
software package MLOGD – designed specifically for
identifying and analysing overlapping CDSs – finds a
strong coding signature for ORFX when applied to BTV,
AHSV, PALV and PHSV/YUOV sequence alignments. The
location and Kozak context of the VP6 and ORFX initiation codons is generally consistent with a leaky scanning
model for ORFX translation. ORFX product bears no
homology to known proteins.
We hope that presentation of this bioinformatic analysis
will stimulate an attempt to experimentally verify the
expression and functional role of ORFX product. Initial
verification could be by means of immunoblotting with
ORFX-specific antibodies or gel purification of ORFX
product from virus-infected cell protein extracts, followed
by mass spectrometry.

Methods
In GenBank, there are whole-genome RefSeqs for six Orbivirus species: Bluetongue virus (BTV), African horse sickness virus (AHSV), Peruvian horse sickness virus (PHSV),
Yunnan orbivirus (YUOV), Palyam virus (PALV) and
Saint Croix river virus (SCRV). All six genomes comprise
10 segments. The segments homologous to BTV segment
9 (encoding VP6) were identified by finding the best
blastp-match, among the 10 BTV translated segments, for
the longest ORF in each of the 50 non-BTV segments. The
identifications were verified, where possible, by information in the GenBank-file headers and in the literature
(AHSV [36]; YUOV [37]; PALV [38]; SCRV [28]).
As of 11 May 2007, there were 1273 Orbivirus sequences
in GenBank (i.e. including partial sequences), however
most of these are not segment 9. Incidently, none of these
sequences has more than one CDS annotated. Segment 9
sequences were extracted (a) using the GenBank-file DEFINITION headers, and (b) by finding the best blastpmatch for the longest ORF in each sequence among the 10
BTV translated segments. These were supplemented with
all GenBank (16 Mar 2008) tblastn matches to the ORFX
peptide sequences from the six RefSeqs (providing one
additional recent sequence). After removing duplicate
sequences, the following segment 9 sequences were
found: (1) the 6 RefSeqs for BTV, AHSV, PHSV, YUOV,
PALV and SCRV (all complete); (2) 47 other BTV
sequences (mostly complete VP6 CDS; all cover ORFX
completely; ~34 contain the full 5' UTR); (3) 2 other
AHSV sequences (full genome); and (4) 10 PALV partial
sequences (183 nt, completely contained in the ORFX
region).
