Abstract
Background: Interpretation of ever-increasing raw sequence information generated by modern genome sequencing
technologies faces multiple challenges, such as gene function analysis and genome annotation. Indeed, nearly 40% of genes in
plants encode proteins of unknown function. Functional characterization of these genes is one of the main challenges in modern
biology. In this regard, the availability of full-length cDNA clones may fill in the gap created between sequence information and
biological knowledge. Full-length cDNA clones facilitate functional analysis of the corresponding genes enabling manipulation of
their expression in heterologous systems and the generation of a variety of tagged versions of the native protein. In addition,
the development of full-length cDNA sequences has the power to improve the quality of genome annotation.
Results: We developed an integrated method to generate a new normalized EST collection enriched in full-length and rare
transcripts of different citrus species from multiple tissues and developmental stages. We constructed a total of 15 cDNA
libraries, from which we isolated 10,898 high-quality ESTs representing 6142 different genes. Percentages of redundancy and
proportion of full-length clones range from 8 to 33, and 67 to 85, respectively, indicating good efficiency of the approach
employed. The new EST collection adds 2113 new citrus ESTs, representing 1831 unigenes, to the collection of citrus genes
available in the public databases. To facilitate functional analysis, cDNAs were introduced in a Gateway-based cloning vector for
high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta. Herein, we describe the technical methods used in the library construction,
sequence analysis of clones and the overexpression of CitrSEP, a citrus homolog to the Arabidopsis SEP3 gene, in Arabidopsis as
an example of a practical application of the engineered Gateway vector for functional analysis.
Conclusion: The new EST collection denotes an important step towards the identification of all genes in the citrus genome.
Furthermore, public availability of the cDNA clones generated in this study, and not only their sequence, enables testing of the
biological function of the genes represented in the collection. Expression of the citrus SEP3 homologue, CitrSEP, in Arabidopsis
results in early flowering, along with other phenotypes resembling the over-expression of the Arabidopsis SEPALLATA genes.
Our findings suggest that the members of the SEP gene family play similar roles in these quite distant plant species.

Background
Citrus is one of the most widespread fruit crops with great
economic and health value [1]. But citrus is also one of the
most difficult plants to improve through traditional
breeding approaches due to undesirable reproductive
traits and characteristics. These include degrees of sexual
sterility and incompatibility, nucellar embryony (asexual
seed production), extended juvenility, and large plant
size, which affect cultural practice in the orchard. To overcome these drawbacks, new genomic approaches are
being developed, including generation of linkage maps,
markers, and EST collections, making possible physical
and genetic mapping in citrus. Furthermore, an International Citrus Genomics Consortium (ICGC) has been initiated to generate the full-genome sequence of sweet
orange (Citrus sinensis), as well as to sequence other citrus
species and varieties [1]. Prior to the establishment of the
ICGC, EST collections [2,3] have provided a first glimpse
of the citrus genome. Over the years, several different
groups have contributed to the generation of a total of
over 230,000 citrus sequences currently deposited at the
dbEST division of the GenBank. Among these, the Spanish
Citrus
Genomic
Project
(CFGP)
http://bio
info.ibmcp.upv.es/genomics/cfgpDB has made a significant contribution producing 25 standard cDNA libraries,
an EST collection of 22,635 high-quality reads [4], and
generating sequence data for over 54,000 ESTs from a normalized full-length cDNA library and 9 additional standard libraries [5]. EST sequencing along with other gene
discovery methods, represent an important initial step
towards functional characterization of the genes in the
genome.
Many methods for the construction of cDNA libraries
have been developed in recent years. Conventional cDNA
library construction approaches, however, suffer from several major shortcomings. First, the majority of cDNA
clones are not full-length, especially for mRNAs longer
than 2 kb. This loss of 5'-terminal sequences is typically
due to premature termination of reverse transcription or
blunt-end polishing of cDNA ends prior to subcloning. As
a result, cDNA 5' ends are significantly underrepresented
in cDNA libraries. Second, an adaptor-mediated cloning
process is still a common approach for cDNA library construction, leading to up to 20% of undesirable ligation byproducts (chimeras) and inserts of non-mRNA origin
(e.g., genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal
RNA, or adaptor dimers) [6]. In recent years, the annotation of genes has been greatly improved by the integration
of full-length cDNAs produced by the community [7-10].
The importance of isolating full-length cDNA clones relies
in the "value-added" features lacking in common ESTs.
Full-length cDNAs define the limits of the transcriptional
units and the coding region, and thus identify the immediate upstream basal promoter and enable sequence char-

acterization of 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR).
Furthermore, they provide a record of transcript diversity
due to modifications of the primary pre-mRNA transcript,
such as alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing,
alternate polyadenylation, and RNA editing. On the other
hand, cDNA libraries rich in full-length clones are a valuable tool for high-throughput gene function analysis [11].
A number of methods have been developed for cDNA
library preparations enriched in full-length sequences [1218] with most of them based on the mRNA cap structure
[12,14,15]. These methods require high quantities of
starting material (20-100 g of RNA) and complicated,
multi-step manipulations of the cap structure of mRNA
and cDNA intermediates, which often result in degradation of mRNA and isolation of short clones, no longer
than 1.5 kb-long [6]. By improving one of these methods,
Suzuki and co-workers obtained an average size of fulllength clones of 1.9 kb from lower amounts of starting
mRNA (5-10 g) [16,19]. The recently described SMART™
method exploits two intrinsic properties of Moloney
murine leukaemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase,
reverse transcription and template switching, and thus
yields larger average ORF size [6,20]. Moreover, directional cloning has been implemented by using SfiI endonuclease, whose variable target sequence allows for
designing adaptors with non-complementary ends, thus
avoiding their concatenation. As the SfiI recognition
sequence is very rare in eukaryotic genomes, the use of SfiI
also eliminates the need for methylation during cDNA
synthesis [21].
The differential abundance of various transcripts in any
particular cell type is a well recognized obstacle for the
efficient high-throughput analysis of cDNA libraries [18].
Usually 10-20 abundant genes (present at several thousand mRNA copies per cell) account for at least 20% of the
cellular mRNA mass, while several thousand of rare genes
(each represented less than 10 mRNA copies per cell) may
account for 20-40% of the mRNA mass [18]. Hence,
straightforward random sequencing of clones from standard cDNA libraries is inefficient for discovering rare transcripts, owing to the repeated occurrence of intermediate
and highly abundant cDNAs. Decreasing the prevalence
of clones representing abundant transcripts by normalizing the cDNA before sequencing may significantly
increase the efficiency of random sequencing and is essential for rare gene discovery [22,23]. The normalization
process generally utilizes second-order reaction kinetics of
re-association of denatured DNA, so that relative transcript concentrations within the remaining singlestranded cDNA fraction are equalized to a considerable
extent. Most of the normalization methods described differ in the process of isolation of the single-stranded (ss)
and double-stranded (ds) cDNA fractions but typically

employ one or more of the following: hydroxylapatite columns, magnetic beads, digestion of the ds-molecules by
restriction endonucleases or amplification of the ss fraction using suppression PCR [24]. One of the recently
described method takes advantage of the properties of a
particular nuclease, the DSN from the Kamchatka crab, to
specifically cleave ds-DNA in both DNA-DNA and DNARNA duplexes, allowing for the separation of the normalized ss-fraction [24-26]. DSN is a thermo-stable enzyme
active at 70°C, and therefore, the degradation of the dsfraction is carried out at the same temperature as the renaturation of cDNA. This helps to avoid a non-specific
hybridization of cDNA during the DSN treatment and,
hence, minimizes the loss of transcripts prone to the formation of secondary structures. The remaining normalized ss-fraction is then amplified using PCR [24,25].
Suitable cDNA for this procedure should contain known
flanking sequences for subsequent PCR amplification.
Furthermore, to avoid the preference towards shorter
products, a process of regulation of average length is recommended [27]. The use of this method requires that the
adapter sequences form inverted terminal repeats [25,27].
On the other hand, moving beyond gene discovery to
understanding gene function is facilitated by the ability to
easily express proteins in both homologous and heterologous biological contexts. The functional analysis of genes
typically requires each ORF to be over-expressed or
silenced, the purification of the expressed protein, production of antibodies, analysis of phenotypes, determination of intracellular localization, and analysis of
interactions with other proteins. This entails engineering
of multiple expression constructs for every gene of interest, which is time-consuming and laborious when using
traditional ligase-mediated cloning, posing a technical
barrier for high-throughput functional genomics or proteomics projects [28]. Hartley and co-workers described a
method called recombinational cloning that exploits the
accurate and site-specific recombination system utilized
by bacteriophage lambda in order to shuttle sequences
between plasmids bearing compatible recombination
sites [29]. This technology, commercially termed Gateway™ (Invitrogen), bypasses the need for traditional
ligase-mediated cloning, provides high specificity and
activity, while maintaining orientation of the transferred
DNA segment and yielding a high proportion of desired
clones [28-32].
We took advantage of the SMART™ protocol, the DSN
nuclease, and the Gateway technology to maximize acquisition of full-length and rarely-expressed cDNAs (from
various tissues and under different conditions), ready to
use for functional analysis purposes. Herein, we describe
the methods employed to generate a new citrus cDNA collection, giving rise to a new set of ESTs and unigenes. As a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

direct example of the practical application of our collection, we carried out the overexpression of a full-length
cDNA clone for the CitrSEP gene in Arabidopsis. The
resulting transgenic plants showed early flowering and
curly leaves, phenotypes that are consistent with a role of
CitrSEP as a bona fide citrus ortholog of the Arabidopsis
SEP3 gene. The protocol utilized in this study has thus
been proven to be successful for generating new EST collections to improve gene annotation and gene discovery
by functional characterization.

Results and Discussion
Full-length and normalized cDNA libraries
The Spanish Citrus Genomic Project (CFGP) was initiated
with the purpose of functional characterization of citrus
genes. It has generated an EST collection from standard
cDNA libraries covering a wide range of tissues and developmental stages, as well as biotic and abiotic stress conditions [4]. In addition, cDNA microarray platforms have
also been created [4,33]. In this work, we wanted to enrich
the EST collection with the addition of a significant
number of full-length cDNA clones. With this objective
we decided to use the SMART™ method, as it allowed us to
obtain large ESTs with few steps and from small quantities
of starting RNA. Furthermore, the subcloning advantages
of the Gateway system, which allows a captured target
sequence to be easily shuttled into a variety of destination
vectors, provides great advantages for future functional
analyses of the isolated gene. For that reason, we modified
the pENTR1A vector in order to make it suitable for the
directional cloning of citrus cDNAs. A detailed description
of the construction of the Gateway-based pENTR-SfiI is
shown in Methods and Additional File 1. The engineered
pENTR-SfiI cloning vector proved to be a useful tool for
the construction of the cDNA libraries as it rendered a very
high cloning efficiency and almost all of the clones generated contained cDNA inserts introduced in the direct orientation as single inserts (data not shown).

We constructed a total of 15 cDNA libraries (Table 1)
using the SMART™ method and the engineered Gatewaybased pENTR-SfiI cloning vector. In order to increase the
proportion of full-length clones, we also performed a size
selection of the cDNAs, by removing those cDNAs that
were shorter than 1 kb, presumably corresponding to partial cDNAs and/or cDNAs that could have already been
isolated in our standard cDNA libraries constructed previously [4]. Since EST collections are hampered by the presence of cDNA clones corresponding to highly expressed
genes, which limit the probability of isolation of new gene
sequences, we decided to include a normalization step in
the construction of 4 of the cDNA libraries to isolate ESTs
corresponding to rare or low-expressed genes. In order to
get wide transcriptome coverage, multiple libraries were
constructed from leaves, roots, shoots, flowers, ovaries

or developmental conditions (Table 1).
EST collection
A total number of 11,968 independent cDNA clones were
randomly isolated from the 15 cDNA libraries and singlepass sequenced from the 5' end of the clone to generate
the EST collection (Table 2). After low-quality and vector
trimming of raw sequences, a total number of 10,898
high-quality ESTs longer than 100 bp were obtained.
High-quality sequences were deposited in the dbEST division of GenBank (accession numbers FC868488FC870221, FC873874-FC876453, FC877373-FC877779,
FC923090-FC924869,
and
FC920173-FC921754,
FC929840-FC932655). Size distribution analysis showed
that, after trimming of vector and poor quality sequences,
most ESTs (89%) were longer than 600 bp, with an average sequence length of 673 nucleotides (Additional File
2A).

Since new sequences are to be incorporated with the previous CFGP collection, EST assembly was carried out
together with the other ESTs obtained in the CFGP. It
revealed that ESTs from our full-length libraries could be
clustered in 2240 singletons and 3902 contigs, yielding a
total number of 6142 putative unique transcripts or uni-

genes (Table 2). This number of unigenes is probably an
overestimation of the number of unique transcripts isolated, as failure to assemble ESTs from a single transcript
can result from alternate splicing, sequence polymorphisms, sequencing errors, and non-overlapping ESTs. To
estimate this internal redundancy, the 6142 putative unigenes were compared with each other using BLASTN.
Sequences with at least 90% nucleotide identity over a
minimum of 300 bp covering at least 75% of one
sequence were assumed to be derived from the same transcript or from different transcripts coming from the same
gene (e.g., alternative splicing and polyadenylation), and
were therefore clustered in super-contigs (see Methods).
This analysis resulted in 4691 unigenes remaining as singletons and 1451 unigenes being clustered in 666 supercontigs, indicating that the minimal number of identified
expressed genes was 5357.
The number of ESTs per contig ranged from 2 (1016 contigs) to 78 (one contig, corresponding to a lectin-related
protein), while most contigs (83%) contained 4 or fewer
ESTs, and only 15 contigs (0.8% of total) included more
than 20 EST sequences (Additional File 2B). ESTs that
constitute large clusters partially overlap, thus allowing
the reconstitution of the full-length sequence of genes
without having to use expensive and labor-intensive

primer walking sequencing. These redundant sequences
are also a source of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for molecular marker development, and 233 contigs were found to have putative SNPs (data not shown).
Improvement of the previous CFGP citrus EST collection
We estimated the contribution of our new EST collection
to the previous CFGP EST collection by calculating the
redundancy and novelty of the full-length libraries constructed in this study. Table 2 shows the distribution per
library of the number of ESTs, singletons, contigs, and
unigenes, as well as the absolute and relative values for
redundancy and novelty. Since we are interested in the
optimization of the sequencing effort for the entire
project, redundancy for each library was calculated as the
percentage of ESTs in this library that correspond to unigenes already obtained in the whole project. Although
this number is necessarily higher than redundancy within
the library, most libraries (11 out 15) had a level of redundancy below 25%, while in the most redundant library it
was higher (33%) but still acceptable. On the other hand,
novelty was calculated as the percentage of unigenes in
each library that have been isolated only from that particular library (unique unigenes). This number represents
the level of uniqueness of the library, which can also be
considered as an estimation of the capacity of the library
to provide new genes to the collection, or gene discovery.
The full-length libraries constructed in this study have
novelty range of 13-53%, with only 4 libraries having a
novelty lower than 20% and three of them exceeding 40%
(Table 2). The contribution of the full-length libraries to
the whole citrus EST collection is therefore indicated by
the low levels of redundancy and high percentages of novelty of these libraries. A major advantage of EST sequencing from multiple libraries is that it increases the
possibility of identifying genes that are putatively transcribed specifically within a certain tissue, during a particular developmental phase, or under some environmental
conditions. Our analysis indicates that 2438 unigenes
(24% of 6142) are specific for the newly constructed
libraries, despite the presence of 85,965 ESTs in the entire
CFGP collection, suggesting the utility of these new libraries.

We also compared the new citrus ESTs with the ESTs and
unigenes already available in the Citrus HarvEST database, which contains 229,570 ESTs. We estimate that the
new EST collection adds 2113 new citrus ESTs representing 1831 unigenes (Additional File 3). In other words,
around 20% of ESTs and 30% of unigenes generated were
not previously available in the public database and therefore represent new genes.

Citrus genes are those reported here and Arabidopsis genes are
those from TAIR. Data are shown as percentages.

Genomic coverage of the unigenes identified
We estimated the genomic coverage of the unigenes identified in the present work by comparing their functional
distribution to that of a full sequenced plant genome.
Table 3 shows the distribution of the citrus unigenes and
Arabidopsis genome along the main GO functional categories in the 'Biological Process' ontology. The distribution along the main functional categories in the three
different GO ontologies is showed in the Additional File
4. These results show that the different unigenes obtained
are involved in many different categories covering virtually every aspect of plant biology and offer a good representation of the citrus genome.
Full-length cDNA clones
Since libraries were constructed using oligo-dT for cDNA
synthesis and inserts were 5'-end sequenced, we estimated
the number of putative full-length cDNA clones generated

Page 6 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:428

by calculating the number of clones that had BLASTX
matches to proteins of the reference plant Arabidopsis
that included the first amino acid of the Arabidopsis protein (Table 2). A total of 3304 unigenes were identified as
having putative full-length clones by this method. In most
of these cases, the unigene sequence also contains additional sequence upstream of the start codon in the alignment, possibly corresponding to 5'-UTR. These putative
full-length unigenes represent 63% of the total number of
unigenes having matches with Arabidopsis proteins
(5248 unigenes), indicating that about 3870 unigenes
(63% of the total number of unigenes with some of the
clones coming from the libraries constructed herein) are
expected to have at least one full-length cDNA clone
among their components. However, identification of fulllength clones using this approach is a relatively crude
method, and these values must be only taken as a rough
estimate.
We next investigated the efficiency of the library construction protocol with regard to the enrichment in full-length
clones. The comparison with the results for the libraries
not enriched in full-length clones clearly indicates that
full-length libraries described here produced a considerably higher percentage of full-length unigenes (>40% in 14
out of 15 libraries; two of them >60%) (Table 2) than the
other standard libraries (none above 32%) [4]. Furthermore, full-length estimation by ESTs instead of unigene
sequences emphasized the benefits of the full-length
enrichment protocol. While the putative full-length ESTs
in other standard libraries account for 30% to 69% (44%
on average, subtraction libraries including a cDNA fragmentation step in their protocol were not considered, data
not shown), those in our full-length libraries comprise
67% to 86% (77% on average) (Table 2).
Efficiency of cDNA libraries normalization
Most normalization strategies are based on the reaction
kinetics of re-association of denatured DNA. However,
not all of them are amenable to full-length cDNA
approaches. The most widely used technology for normalization and substraction in large-scale gene discovery
relies on the re-association of nucleic acids in amplified
plasmid libraries [22,23] and consequently suffers from
cDNA-size cloning bias that can lead to under-representation of long cDNAs. To avoid the problems related to the
amplification of libraries, Carninci et al. [18] developed a
method to normalize and subtract cDNA before cloning.
In that method, a biotinylated driver (usually an aliquot
of the mRNA initially used for the cDNA library preparation) is employed to detect and eliminate abundant
cDNAs. However, this method has several drawbacks as it
requires high quantities of starting poly(A+) RNA and is
time-consuming [25].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

Among the different methods employed to separate the
normalized ss-cDNA fraction we chose normalization
with the thermostable DSN nuclease [24,25]. It displays a
strong preference for cleaving double-stranded DNA and
DNA in DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes compared with ssDNA and ss-RNA, irrespective of sequence length. Due to
the thermostable properties of the DSN enzyme, the degradation of the double-stranded fraction is carried out at
the same temperature as the re-naturation of cDNA. This
helps to avoid a non-specific hybridization of cDNA during the DSN treatment and, hence, the loss of transcripts
which are prone to the formation of secondary structures.
On the other hand, each cDNA population requires a specific normalization treatment (different quantities of DSN
enzyme). Those normalized cDNAs were then subjected
to amplification by PCR in order to identify the population that had undergone the best normalization. Aliquots
of the PCR reaction were extracted at different amplification cycles and tested by electrophoresis to identify the
samples showing a good normalization profile (Additional File 5). The profile of an efficiently normalized and
amplified cDNA was one whose overall signal intensity of
a smear (at its plateau) was similar to that shown for the
control, but does not contain distinguishable bands nor
shows smear in the high-molecular-weight region of the
gel (> 4.5 kb). Finally, a virtual northern [34] was carried
out to estimate the relative concentration of a highly
abundant clone in both the non-normalized and the normalized cDNA populations obtained from the second run
of amplification (Additional File 5C and 5D). The clone
C32009H03 from the contig aCL11contig11, whose consensus sequence shows similarity with the family of lectinrelated protein kinases, was selected as probe because it
was present at high copy number in the equivalent fulllength non-normalized cDNA library RVDevelop1, revealing the high expression of the corresponding citrus gene.
Equal amounts of normalized and non-normalized cDNA
samples were electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The reduction in the abundance of
the frequent clone, used as a radioactive probe, in the normalized sample became evident since much lower signal
intensity was detected when compared to that observed in
the non-normalized cDNA.
In summary, 4 out of the 15 full-length cDNA libraries
were normalized using this approach. Overall, the redundancy of these libraries is lower than that of non-normalized libraries (Table 2). Furthermore, when the
distribution of the number of ESTs per contig is compared, normalized libraries show a higher proportion of
contigs with a low number of ESTs and a lower proportion
of contigs represented by a high number of ESTs (Additional File 3). Finally, the new citrus ESTs collection added
almost 2000 new genes not previously represented in the

Page 7 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:428

Citrus HarvEST database, which already contains 229,570
ESTs. These results show a good efficiency for the normalization step and demonstrate the convenience of this
approach to improve the efficacy of the sequencing effort
at isolating new and/or low expressed transcripts in the
EST collections.
Functional analysis of citrus genes by transformation of
Arabidopsis plants
Arabidopsis is the reference system for plant biologists
[35] due to several characteristics, such as the availably of
its full-genome sequence and simplicity of transformation, which makes it an excellent system for functional
analysis of heterologous genes. For the ectopic expression
of citrus genes in Arabidopsis, we chose the destination
vector pMDC32 designed by Curtis et al. [31]. The backbone of this vector is derived from the pCambia series of
binary vectors for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. The Gateway cassette is adjacent to the dual 35S
CaMV promoter, so the expression of the heterologous
genes is under the control of this strong promoter.

To validate the system implemented in our cDNA collection for rapid functional characterization of citrus genes,
we selected a citrus member of the SEPALLATA gene family of transcription factors with MADS-box domain. Plant
MADS-box gene family participates in the determination
of floral organ identity. Among them, the SEPALLATA are
a class of MAD-box genes with a role as floral homeotic
genes that are required for the development of petals, stamens and carpels [36]. In Arabidopsis, the SEPALLATA
gene family is composed of four members (SEP1 to SEP4).
Triple mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking the activity of
three SEP1/2/3 genes produce flowers in which all organs
develop as sepals [36]. Moreover, over-expression of these
genes provokes alterations in organ identity as well as
early flowering and curly leaves [37]. In addition, other
SEPALLATA genes from different species have been
expressed in Arabidopsis. For example, overexpression of
either lily LMADS3 or wheat TaMADS1, both orthologs of
Arabidopsis SEP3, causes early flowering after producing
only four or five curly rosette leaves [38,39]. Thus SEP
gene function is easy to score by ectopic expression in a
validated heterologous system, like Arabidopsis.
To express a citrus SEP gene in Arabidopsis, we first
searched our citrus database for a full-length clone showing the highest homology to SEPALLATA genes. In alignment assays, the clone C32006D10, that had been
isolated from the cDNA library RVDevelop1, showed a
high degree of sequence identity (75%) with the Arabidopsis gene SEP3. The C32006D10 clone was completely
sequenced. It corresponds to a 999-nt transcript, with a
deduced protein sequence of 244 amino acids with a
molecular weight of 27.8 kDa (Figure 1 and Additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

File 6). Aminoacid sequence also showed a very high
sequence similarity to Arabidopsis SEP proteins (Figure
1A), indicating that the C32006D10 clone corresponds to
the citrus orthologs of the Arabidopsis SEP3 (Figure 1B).
Thus, the corresponding gene was named CitrSEP. More
recently, five citrus SEP genes (CitMADS1/3/5/6/8) have
been isolated and characterized [40]. Although CitrSEP is
almost identical to CitMADS3, they differ in the first 4
aminoacid residues (data not shown), with the aminoend sequence of CitrSEP (MGRG-) being identical to all
Arabidopsis SEP genes (Figure 1A), unlike the distinct Nterminal sequence of CitMADS3, MARGG-. Thus, CitrSEP
and CitMADS3 appear to correspond to different but
highly related citrus genes.
The CitrSEP cDNA clone was then transferred to the destination vector pMDC32 by means of LR clonase reaction as
detailed in Methods. This clone was introduced in Arabidopsis, and several hygromycin-resistant homozygous
lines were selected. Figure 2 shows the expression of
CitrSEP gene in transgenic lines L120-5 and L120-9,
which displayed the highest expression levels and were
thus selected for further analysis. Next, we tested the
expression of the endogenous SEP genes, as well as
CitrSEP, by qRT-PCR with gene-specific primers. Interestingly, along with the overexpression of the CitrSEP gene,
the endogenous SEP3 was also strongly upregulated in
these lines (Figure 2), while the other three SEP genes
were also affected but to a lesser extent (Additional File 7),
suggesting a positive feedback on its regulation whose
characterization goes beyond the scope of this work.
Recently, it has been reported that SEP3 interacts with
other MADS-box proteins, including other SEP, to form
multimeric protein complexes, suggesting a role as mediator of higher-order complex formation [41]. Transgenic
plants were grown to maturity and their phenotypes were
scored. Both lines bolted earlier than control plants, both
in long and short days (Figure 3A). In addition, leaves of
transgenic lines showed curly leaves (Figure 3B). All of
these phenotypes were indistinguishable from those
already reported for the overexpression of SEP genes in
Arabidopsis, suggesting that CitrSEP is indeed a functional
homolog of SEP3 in citrus.
The availability of an easy and efficient transfer method
enabling subcloning of full-length cDNAs into expression
vectors allows for the rapid analysis of gene function in
citrus. Although we fully sequenced the CitrSEP clone as a
proof of concept, the system implemented in our EST collection bypasses the need for cDNA sequencing, as clones
can be rapidly transferred regardless of their sequence
information, without restriction enzyme digestion utilized in classical cloning methods. We believe that this
collection can provide an enormous advantage for gene
validation in citrus. Furthermore, the enrichment of full-

length clones facilitates the task of genome annotation
once the whole-genome sequence becomes available in
the near future. The low percentage of redundancy among
the clones isolated so far guarantees that many other
genes can be successfully identified in new rounds of
clone selection and sequencing from these libraries.

Conclusion
We isolated a new set of 10,898 high-quality ESTs representing 6142 different genes from 15 normalized and
non-normalized cDNA libraries, using an integrated
methodology. These sequences provided 2113 new citrus
ESTs, representing 1831 unigenes, to the collection of citrus genes available in the public databases. Our collection

shows enhanced enrichment for full-length transcripts
thus facilitating downstream functional analysis of newly
discovered genes. For this purpose, citrus cDNAs were
introduced in a Gateway-based cloning vector for rapid
high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta. As
a proof of concept of the genomic tool generated, expression in Arabidopsis of the citrus SEP3 homologue,
CitrSEP, was shown to lead to early flowering, along with
other phenotypes mimicking the over-expression of the
Arabidopsis SEPALLATA genes. These findings suggest
that the SEP gene family performs similar roles in distantly related plant species, citrus and Arabidopsis, and
demonstrate the utility of the new full-length cDNA clone
collection for the analysis of gene function.

Methods
Plant material and treatments
Citrus leaves, shoots, roots, developing flowers, and fruits
were harvested from different citrus species (C. aurantium,
C. reshni, C. clementina (var. Clemenules), C. macrophylla,
and C. medica) subjected to different biotic or abiotic
stresses or at different developmental stages (Table 1).
Adult trees were grown under field conditions at the IVIA
(Moncada-Valencia, Spain). Young trees (6-month-old
seedlings) were grown in pots (20 cm in diameter × 30 cm

in height) in a greenhouse under natural light at 27°C and
60% humidity.
For the water stress treatment, plants were transplanted to
pots with dried substrate and tissues were collected at 0, 5,
10 and 24 hours after the treatment. Some of the water
stressed plants were watered after 24 hours and tissues
were collected 2 and 12 hours later. Salt stressed plants
were either watered with 200 mM NaCl (-1.04 MPa) and
tissues were collected at 3 hours, 24 hours and 4 days, or

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:428

were watered with 30 mM (-0.15 MPa) NaCl for 3 months
and with 60 mM (-0.32 MPa) NaCl for another 3 months,
and tissues were collected when the treatment was
brought to completion. For the iron chlorosis assay,
plants were watered with an iron scavenger, and foliar tissue was collected from the second, third and fourth bolting after the treatment. For the biotic stresses, plants were
infected with Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV), Citrus Exocortis
viroid (CEVd) or Hot Stunt Viroid (HSVd) by grafting plants
with bark pieces (containing a stem bud) from infected
plants at the IVIA (Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones
Agrarias Moncada, Valencia, Spain), and tissues were collected once the symptoms appeared. For the infection
with the oomycete Phytophthora citrophthora, the plants
were transferred to containers with a solution of
zoospores. Once the infection (foot rot) developed, roots
were collected. Some postharvest stresses, such as cold
stress or the infection with the fungus Penicillium digitatum, were assayed in harvested mature fruits. For the
cold treatment, fruits were stored at 2°C and the tissues
were collected at different times, from hours to several
months. Harvested mature fruits were infected with
spores of P. digitatum following wounding of the fruit surface and kept under high humidity conditions for 8, 12
and 24 hours. For developmental studies, different tissues
were taken at various developmental stages: leaves (2-3, 34, 4-5, 5-6 and 6-8 cm in length); apical meristems (1-2
cm long); inflorescences (3-4, 5-6 and 8-9 cm in length);
unpollinated ovaries (closed floral bud, petal fall, anthesis, and senescent); and fruits (1, 3, 7 and 14 days after
treatment of flowers with GA3).
Wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Col0) were grown in chambers under 16 h light - 8 h dark
regime, at 22°C. Seeds were surface-sterilized and selected
in Murashige and Skoog (MS) media.
RNA isolation for library construction
Total RNA was extracted from different organs and tissues
by phenol separation and LiCl precipitation according to
Bugos et al. [42] with minor modifications. Poly(A+) RNA
was isolated from total RNA using Oligotex mRNA kit
(Qiagen).
Development of a Gateway-based cDNA cloning vector
Prior to the construction of the full-length enriched
library we developed a cloning vector (pENTR-SfiI) allowing for both effective directional cloning by taking advantage of the nonsymmetrical cleavage of the SfiI restriction
enzyme and for the ease of subcloning provided by the
Gateway System. For that purpose, we performed several
modifications in the commercially available Invitrogen's
pENTR1A vector. Briefly, pENTR1A plasmid was digested
with EcoRI and XhoI to remove the ccdB gene. The pENTRSfiI vector was obtained by ligation of a SfiI adaptor, con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

taining two different recognition sequences for the SfiI
restriction enzyme (SfiIA and SfiIB, underlined), to the
digested vector arms. The adaptor was prepared by
annealing the oligonucleotides pENTR-SfiI-F (5'AATTCGGCCATTATGGCCTGCAGGATCCGGCCGCCTCGGCC-3')
and
pENTR-SfiI-R
(5'TCGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGGATCCTGCAGGCCATAATGGCCG-3') after heating for 10 minutes at 70°C and
slowly cooling at RT. The SfiI recognition sites in the oligos are underlined. EcoRI and XhoI sites were restored in
the pENTR-SfiI vector. Ligation product was used to transform competent JM110 E. coli cells. Although there is no
recognition DNA sequence in our SfiI recognition sites for
Dam or Dcm methylation, we observed that digestion
with SfiI was much more efficient in JM110 cells, which
are deficient in Dam and Dcm methylation, than in the
conventional DH5 competent cells. Prior to its use as
cloning vector, the pENTR-SfiI was digested with SfiI
(Roche) for 4 hours at 50°C and dephosphorylated by
incubation with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB) at
37°C for 90 minutes.
Construction of full-length enriched cDNA libraries
Additional File 1 outlines the methodology for cDNA construction followed in this work. For the construction of
the full-length enriched cDNA libraries we used the
SMART™ technology with minor modifications [6]. The
BD SMART™ PCR cDNA Synthesis kit (BD Biosciences)
was used for the synthesis of cDNA starting from 0.5 g of
poly(A+) RNA. The first-strand cDNA synthesis, dC tailing
and template switching and extension by RT were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
However, the primers used in the reaction were the BD
Biosciences'
oligonucleotides
SMART
IV
(5'AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTATGGCCGGG-3'), containing the SfiIA recognition site
(underlined), and the CDSIII/3' PCR primer (5'-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG-d(T)30N-1N-3'), containing the SfiIB recognition sequence (underlined). We
made 6 second-strand synthesis reactions for every cDNA
library. Three reactions were used to generate the fulllength cDNA libraries described here and the other three
reactions were stored to generate the normalized cDNA
libraries described below. For each of the second-strand
synthesis reactions, 2 l of the single stranded cDNA were
amplified by PCR in a Perkin Elmer 9400 thermal cycler
using the following parameters: an initial preheating at
95°C for 1 min and additional 16 cycles of 5 s at 95°C, 5
s at 65°C and 6 min at 68°C. The PCR mix was in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. Next, the cDNA
obtained in every second-strand reaction was blunt-ended
following the provided instructions. Once polished, the
cDNA was digested with 60 u of SfiI (Roche), purified
using the Qiaquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), and
electrophoresed in a 1× TAE 1% agarose gel. Fragments

ranging between 1 kb and 5 kb were purified with the
Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit. The ds-cDNA was then ready
to be ligated into the modified pENTR-SfiI vector. Ligation
was performed with 10 ng of pENTR-SfiI vector and 10 ng
of cDNA, with 2 u of T4 DNA ligase (Roche) in a final volume of 10 l. The reaction was incubated at 16°C for 18
hours. One half of the ligation reaction was used to transform One Shot MAX Efficiency DH5-T1 Competent
Cells (Invitrogen), and transformed cells were selected
onto LB agar plates supplemented with 50 g/ml kanamycin.
Normalization of cDNA and construction of normalized
cDNA libraries
For the normalization we took advantage of the properties
of the Duplex-Specific Nuclease (DSN) enzyme purified
from Kamchatka crab hepatopancreas (Evrogen) [24].
DSN displays a strong preference for cleaving ds DNA and
DNA in DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes. The substrates of the
DSN were the three ds-cDNA synthesis reactions left aside
during the full-length library construction described
above. Two reactions were stored before cDNA was bluntended as a control of the normalization and a third reaction was used for normalization.

Most of the normalized cDNA libraries were prepared
from the same mixture of ds-cDNA previously produced
to obtain the full-length cDNA libraries (Table 1 and
Additional File 1). The normalization process was carried
out following the protocol of a cDNA Normalization kit
provided by Evrogen with some modifications, to make it
suitable for the construction of our specific cDNA libraries. Purified ds-cDNA (120 ng) was mixed with 4 l of 4×
hybridization buffer (200 mM Hepes, pH 7.5 and 2 M
NaCl), in a 16 L-final volume, and aliquoted in 4 PCR
tubes. The ds-cDNA was denatured by incubating the
tubes at 98°C for 2 minutes. Then, re-hybridization was
performed by incubation at 68°C for 5 hours. Preheated
DSN master buffer (5 l per tube) was added and tubes
were incubated at 68°C for additional 10 minutes. Different enzyme amounts were assayed in each tube (1, 0.5,
0.25 and 0 Kunitz-unit). Degradation reaction was carried
out for 25 min at 68°C. To quench the reaction, 10 l of
DSN stop solution were added to each tube followed by
incubation at 68°C for 5 minutes. Reaction was finished
by cooling down the tubes on ice, and finally 20 l of
water were added to bring the final volume up to 40 l per
tube.
First run of amplification of the normalized cDNA
The PCR amplifications were performed using the reagents provided in Advantage 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences).
For the first run of amplification we designed new primers
suitable for maintaining the average cDNA length. Specifically, their sequences were internal and shorter than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

those employed in the synthesis of the ds-cDNA. As in the
previous normalization step, four PCR amplifications
were done individually, each of them containing 1 l of
the normalized cDNA with different concentrations of
DSN enzyme obtained in the previous step. The PCR master mix for all the four reaction tubes was prepared by
combining the following reagents in the order shown: 39
l of sterile water, 5 l of 10× Advantage PCR Buffer, 1 l
of 50× dNTP mix, 1.5 l of primer M1-5' 10 M (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3'), 1.5 l of primer M1-3'
10 M (5'-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGG-3') and 1 l of
50× Advantage Polymerase mix. The thermal cycling reactions were carried out in a preheated (95°C) Perkin-Elmer
9400 machine using the following parameters: 7 sec at
95°C, 10 sec at 66°C and 6 min at 72°C. As the optimal
number of cycles had to be established empirically for
each cDNA library to be done, a 10 l aliquot of each PCR
reaction was transferred to a clean tube after 7, 9, 11, 13,
and 15 PCR cycles. At the end of this process, we obtained
a series of 5 tubes from every initial PCR reaction (20 in
total).
An aliquot of 5 l from each tube was electrophoresed in
a TAE 1.5× agarose gel to determine the efficiency of normalization. The cDNA used in the next step was chosen
according to three characteristics: 1) overall signal intensity of the smear is similar to that shown for the control
(without DSN digestion) but does not contain distinguishable bands, 2) signal intensity of smear has reached
its plateau, and 3) the cDNA smear does not exceed 4.5
kb.
Second run of amplification of the normalized cDNA
Both the reaction that best fit in the normalization parameters and the non-normalized reaction (control) were
diluted 1:10. A second run of amplification was carried
out with an aliquot of 2 l from those dilutions. To
increase the amount of cDNA, three reactions of amplification were performed for the normalized cDNA. The PCR
master mix was prepared by combining the following reagents: 76 l of sterile water, 10 l of 10× Advantage PCR
buffer, 2 l of 50× dNTP mix, 4 l of primer M2-5' 10 M
(5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAG-3'), 4 l of primer M23' 10 M (5'-ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCG-3') and 2 l of
50× Advantage Polymerase mix. The thermal cycling reactions were carried out in a preheated (95°C) Perkin-Elmer
9400 machine with 12 cycles of 7 sec at 95°C, 10 sec at
66°C and 6 min at 72°C. Once finished, 300 l (100 l ×
3 reactions) of normalized cDNA were ready to be used in
the construction of the normalized cDNA library.
Last steps for the construction of the normalized cDNA
library
The next steps in the construction of the normalized
cDNA library (cDNA polishing, digestion and electro-

phoresis of digested cDNA, cDNA purification, ligation
into pENTR-SfiI vector and transformation of competent
E. coli cells) were identical to those described above for the
construction of the full-length cDNA libraries.
Virtual northern to assess the normalization efficiency
For a better assessment of the normalization efficiency we
performed a virtual northern to estimate the relative concentration of a highly abundant clone in both the nonnormalized and the normalized cDNA populations
obtained from the second run of amplification. Equivalent quantities of cDNA corresponding to the non-normalized and normalized samples subjected to the second
run of amplification were electrophoresed in a TAE 1.5×
gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by
a standard Southern blot analysis. A PCR was performed
to amplify the C32009H03 clone, which was previously
identified as highly abundant in our RVDevelop1 library,
using vector oligos (pENTR-F: 5'-GGCTTTAAAGGAACCAATTCA-3' and pENTR-R: 5'-GCAATGCTTTCTTATAATGCCAAC-3'). Ten nanograms of this PCR fragment were
used in a labeling reaction with [-32P]dCTP using Ready
to Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Bioscience), and reaction was purified from unincorporated nucleotides using
probe purification columns (NucTrap, Stratagene, or
Quick Spin, Roche). The DNA blot membrane was
hybridized according to the protocol described by Church
and Gilbert [43].
EST collection and sequencing
Colonies were randomly-selected from LB agar plates supplemented with 50 g/ml kanamycin. After manual picking, colonies were grown overnight in standard LBkanamycin media, and plasmids were isolated by alkaline
lysis method using PerfectPrep (Eppendorf) or Montage
(Millipore) kits. In addition, selected clones were stored at
-80°C as glycerol stocks. Sequencing reactions were carried out from the 5' end of the cDNA insert, with the
pENTR-F oligo (5'-GGCTTTAAAGGAACCAATTCA-3'),
using an ABI 3100 capillary automatic sequencer (Applied
Biosystems) with fluorescent dye terminator technology.
EST preprocessing and assembly
EST preprocessing and assembly was performed by using
EST2uni, an open, parallel software package for EST analysis and database creation http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/
est2uni[44]. EST2uni is a completely automated computer pipeline capable of converting, using the standard EST
analysis tools described below, a group of input sequence
trace files in a highly structured and annotated EST database with a user-oriented web interface for efficient data
mining. All of the data generated by the pipeline were
stored in a web-searchable MySQL database http://bio
info.ibmcp.upv.es/genomics/cfgp_fl/login.php. Base calling and quality scores assignment were made with Phred

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

[45] using default parameters. Low quality and cloning
vector trimming was performed by Lucy [46]. Contaminant vector sequences were detected and removed by SeqClean http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software using
the
NCBI
vector
database
UniVec
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html. Repeat
elements and low complexity region masking were done
with RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org and
SeqClean http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software,
respectively. After cleaning, sequences shorter than 100
nucleotides were discarded. Clean, high-quality EST
sequences obtained in the pre-processing step were then
assembled in contigs and singletons to obtain a nonredundant unigene set using TGICL http://comp
bio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software with default parameters. ESTs generated in this study were assembled together
with the rest of ESTs obtained in the whole CFGP http://
bioinfo.ibmcp.upv.es/genomics/cfgpDB in order to
improve the quality of the assembly.
To estimate the number of new ESTs and unigenes generated in this work, we compared the new citrus ESTs and
unigenes with the 229,570 Citrus ESTs in the HarvEST
database, version 1.25, as of June 9th 2009 http://har
vest.ucr.edu/, using BLASTN and Perl scripts. An EST is
considered as new if it has at least 25% of sequence with
less than 95% of identity to any other EST or unigene in
the HarvEST collection.
Functional annotation of unigenes
Unigene functional annotation was also done by using
the EST2uni software package. As a part of the whole analysis, EST2uni carried out BLASTX against the UniRef90
non-redundant protein database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
uniref[47] and the full set of Arabidopsis proteins provided by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)
http://www.arabidopsis.org using default parameters and
arbitrary non-stringent threshold of 10-5 for E-value. Unigenes were annotated with the description of the most
similar UniRef90 cluster of proteins or, when no significantly similar UniRef90 cluster was found, with the
description of the most similar Arabidopsis protein, if
any. Unigenes were annotated as highly similar to the first
BLAST hit when the E-value was lower than 10-15. BLASTX
hits with an E-value higher than 10-10 were not considered
for annotation. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of the
Arabidopsis most similar protein was used for GO annotation of the citrus unigenes. Functional motifs were also
identified by using a HMMER search [48] against the Pfam
database http://pfam.janelia.org[49].
Isolation and sequencing of a full-length CitrSEP clone
Clone C32006D10 (CitrSEP), with homology to the Arabidopsis gene SEP3 of the MADS-box gene family, was
selected. An aliquot (1 l) of the DNA prep was subjected

Page 13 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:428

to PCR amplification using the vector oligos pENTR-F and
pENTR-R (see above), and the PCR product was fully
sequenced using internal oligos.
Cloning into Gateway destination vectors
The transfer of the cDNA clone CitrSEP from the pENTRSfiI to the Gateway destination vector pMDC32 was performed using the LR clonase kit (Invitrogen). The reaction
mix was prepared by combining 2 g of plasmid
C32006D10, 2 g of pMDC32 plasmid, 4 l of 5× LR
clonase and 8 l of reaction buffer, and the sample was
then incubated at 25°C for 60 min. The reaction was then
treated with 2 l of proteinase K by incubation at 37°C for
10 minutes. An aliquot (1 l) from the recombination
reaction was used to transform One Shot MAX Efficiency
DH5-T1 Competent Cells (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer instructions, and cells were selected on LB
agar plates containing 50 g/ml of kanamycin. Selection
of positive clones was carried out by PCR analysis.
Transformation of Arabidopsis plants
The binary plasmid pMDC32 carrying the citrus clone
C32006D10 was used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 C58C1 Rifr (pMP90) [50] by electroporation using a Gene-Pulse apparatus (Bio-Rad). Col-0
Arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip
method [51]. T1 seeds were plated on MS media supplemented with 50 g/mL hygromycin for selection of transformants and 500 g/mL vancomycin to limit the growth
of Agrobacterium. T2 seeds were collected and
homozygous lines were selected based on hygromycin
resistance of the T3 progeny. Expression of the CitrSEP
gene in seedlings was assayed by semi-quantitative and
quantitative qRT-PCR, and homozygous lines showing
highest CitrSEP expression were selected and used for
functional characterization.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analysis of gene
expression
Total RNA was extracted from frozen rosette leaves using
the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was
eliminated during RNA purification by treatment with 50
units of DNaseI (RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) for 15
min at room temperature. Two micrograms of total RNA
were used to synthesize first strand cDNA, using the
SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR
(Invitrogen Life Technologies). cDNA synthesis reactions
were finally diluted in a volume of 80 L.

For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the ELONGATION FACTOR 1- (EF-1-) gene (At1g07940) was used as an internal control for quantification. Primers were used to
amplify a 532 bp fragment from EF-1- cDNA and a 535
bp fragment from CitrSEP cDNA. cDNA solution (1 L)
was used in PCR reactions (50 L final volume) in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/428

presence of 0.6 M of each clone-specific primer and 2.6
units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme (Roche). PCR reaction conditions were 5 min at 95°C, followed by 25 cycles
of 30 s at 95°C, 45 s at 60°C and 45 s at 72°C, and a final
extension of 10 min at 72°C. The products were detected
in a 1% (v/v) agarose 1 × TAE gel and stained with ethidium bromide before quantifying using the Gene Snap
(SynGene) program.
qRT-PCR was carried out using the SYBR® GREEN PCR
Master mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRISM 7000
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Final
reaction volume was 20 L, with 1 L of cDNA, 10 L of
SYBR® GREEN PCR Master mix, and 9 L of primer mixture, containing 0.66 M of each primer. The PCR program consisted of an initial incubation of 2 min at 50°C
followed by a de-naturation at 95°C for 10 min, and 40
cycles of amplification of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 min
at 60°C. Each sample was assayed in triplicates, and each
experiment was repeated at least twice. Expression levels
were calculated relative to the constitutively expressed
gene EF-1-. Normalization was carried out using the
Ct method (Applied Biosystems), where Ct was calculated for each sample as the difference between Ct of the
CitrSEP gene and Ct of EF-1-, and final relative expression level was determined as inverse of log2 of Ct (SEP) Ct (EF-1-). Primers used are listed in Additional File 8.
