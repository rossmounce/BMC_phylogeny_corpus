Multiple-locus, variable number of tandem repeat
analysis (MLVA) of the fish-pathogen Francisella
noatunensis
Øyvind J Brevik*, Karl F Ottem, Are Nylund

Abstract
Background: Since Francisella noatunensis was first isolated from cultured Atlantic cod in 2004, it has emerged as a
global fish pathogen causing disease in both warm and cold water species. Outbreaks of francisellosis occur in
several important cultured fish species making a correct management of this disease a matter of major importance.
Currently there are no vaccines or treatments available. A strain typing system for use in studies of F. noatunensis
epizootics would be an important tool for disease management. However, the high genetic similarity within the
Francisella spp. makes strain typing difficult, but such typing of the related human pathogen Francisella tullarensis
has been performed successfully by targeting loci with higher genetic variation than the traditional signature
sequences. These loci are known as Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeat (VNTR). The aim of this study is to
identify possible useful VNTRs in the genome of F. noatunensis.
Results: Seven polymorphic VNTR loci were identified in the preliminary genome sequence of F. noatunensis ssp.
noatunensis GM2212 isolate. These VNTR-loci were sequenced in F. noatunensis isolates collected from Atlantic cod
(Gadus morhua) from Norway (n = 21), Three-line grunt (Parapristipoma trilineatum) from Japan (n = 1), Tilapia
(Oreochromis spp.) from Indonesia (n = 3) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from Chile (n = 1). The Norwegian
isolates presented in this study show both nine allelic profiles and clades, and that the majority of the farmed
isolates belong in two clades only, while the allelic profiles from wild cod are unique.
Conclusions: VNTRs can be used to separate isolates belonging to both subspecies of F. noatunensis. Low allelic
diversity in F. noatunensis isolates from outbreaks in cod culture compared to isolates wild cod, indicate that
transmission of these isolates may be a result of human activity. The sequence based MLVA system presented in
this study should provide a good starting point for further development of a genotyping system that can be used
in studies of epizootics and disease management of francisellosis.

Background
The intensive culturing of fish in artificially high population densities facilitates disease outbreaks [1,2]. Standard
protocols for traditional fish health management, controlling and preventing diseases, have focused on vaccines, operational prophylactic measures and oral
treatment using therapeutic agents [3]. However, in
those cases where vaccines or treatments are not available, understanding the epizootiology becomes the key
to prevent outbreaks and pathogen dispersal [1]. Using
molecular tools for strain typing of pathogens, combined

with biological and ecological knowledge of both the
pathogen and the host, is a prerequisite in creating an
epizootiological understanding which can be applied in
management of diseases in both wild and cultured
populations.
Historically, the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) has
been an important marine resource in Norway, occurring naturally both as migratory and stationary populations [4-6]. These populations are divided into coastal
and oceanic populations, based on phenotypic and genotypic traits. The Norwegian coastal cod population is
considered to consist of several stationary sub populations dispersed along the Norwegian coast [7-12]. The
oceanic cod in Norwegian waters can be divided into

two populations, the North East Arctic cod and the
North Sea cod, both with seasonally dependent migratory behavior. The oceanic and some of the coastal
populations will, at certain times of the year, be present
in at the same locations.
During the last decade cod has been a species of
increasing significance and interest for the Norwegian
aquaculture industry [13]. Cod is now intensively cultured with full control of all life-stages, except for the
broodfish which are predominantly of wild origin [6,14].
The intensive production cycle of cod consists of three
separate steps, where the first step starts with the fertilization of eggs from broodstock held in large land based
tanks. The majority of broodfish consists of wild caught
cod from both costal and oceanic populations. After
hatching the fry is held in indoor tanks. The second
stage is on-growth, where the fingerlings are transferred
to net pens in the sea and held until they are moved to
production sites. Mixing of populations from different
broodstock companies occurs at the on-growth sites, i.e.
before redistribution to production sites. Mixing of
populations may also occur at the production sites due
to limited availability of fish from the different on-growing sites. Several generations can be present at one production site. The different operational sites are
dispersed along the Norwegian coast resulting in large
scale movement of cultured cod between different parts
of Norway [13,14].
In 2004 a Francisella species was isolated from farmed
cod in Norway showing clinical signs of a chronic granulomatous infection in kidney, spleen, liver and heart
[15]. The bacterium was initially characterized both as a
species, F. piscicida (GM2212) [16,17], and later in the
same year as a F. philomiragia subspecies, ssp. noatunensis (NCIMB 14265T) [18]. The F. philomiragia ssp.
noatunensis was later elevated to the rank of species, F.
noatunensis ssp. noatunensis, with F. piscicida as a heterotypic synonym [19-22]. Following the discovery, several annual outbreaks of francisellosis have been
diagnosed with main foci in the western parts of Norway [23]. The bacterium has been detected in cultured
fish from Rogaland to Nordland county (59-67°N), however, positive wild cod has only been identified south of
Sogn og Fjordane county (61°N), indicating a southern
natural reservoir of the bacteria [24]. After the discovery
of F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis, histological material
collected in 1988 from a broodfish population in Hordaland county, has been stained positive with antiserum
for the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate,
suggesting the presence of the bacteria in Norwegian
waters prior to the initial discovery [25].
During the last 10 years members of the genus Francisella have emerged as a global problem for aquaculture,
causing mortality among a wide range of aquatic hosts.

These Francisella isolates show high genetic similarities
with F. philomiragia and with each other at the 16S
rRNA-gene [15,26-32]. The close genetic relatedness has
been confirmed with sequencing of several housekeeping
genes showing identical sequences for Norwegian isolates [18]. A Chilean isolate from Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar) UA2660 [29] showed a high similarity to
the Norwegian cod isolates (NCIMB 14265T/GM2212)
and was therefore described as a new isolate of the F.
noatunensis ssp. noatunensis [19,22]. Fish pathogenic
Francisella isolates from Asia display high genetic similarity to UA2660 and NCIMB 14265T/GM2212 and constitute a separate subspecies, F. noatunensis ssp.
orientalis (Ehime-1) [19,20,26]. F. asiatica (PQ1104) isolated from tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) in Costa Rica is
identical with F. noatunensis ssp. orientalis (Ehime-1)
with respect to phenotype and signature sequences
(rRNA and housekeeping genes) [22].
Isolates of F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis from
Norway are identical when comparing 16S and housekeeping gene sequences [18,33], making genotyping and
studies of epizootics difficult. If an epizootiological
approach is to be applied for controlling and preventing
dispersal of Francisella spp. in aquaculture, a tool for
the identification of isolates is a necessity. Such a tool
will make it possible to differentiate between wild endemic and anthropogenic dispersed strains. This approach
also requires knowledge of the production history of
cod and some knowledge of natural occurring strains in
wild cod in the production areas. Targeting the housekeeping genes of bacterial fish pathogens has been
applied for strain identification [34], but due to identical
signature sequences this has not been possible to use on
F. noatunensis [18,24,33]. Similar problems are known
from epidemiological studies of human pathogenic bacteria like the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium ssp.
paratuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis and
the related F. tularensis [35-38] where evolutionary or
stochastic events have led to a dominance of highly fit
clones making strain identification difficult [39].
By using genetic markers with higher mutational rates,
like Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR), one
can construct allelic profiles in Multiple Locus VNTR
Analysis (MLVA) systems, making strain differentiation
of clonal bacteria populations possible [40-42]. MLVA
systems have already been applied in studies of F. tularensis isolates [43-46]. This study is an attempt to provide a sequenced based MLVA tool for studying the
epizootics of F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis in Norwegian cod farming. Our findings suggest that the MLVA
system presented in this study is suitable for strain typing of F. noatunensis isolates from Norwegian cod, and
the results indicate that there are only a few clades causing francisellosis outbreaks in Norwegian cod culturing.

Methods
Isolation of Francisella noatunensis ssp. noatunensis

All isolates of Francisella noatunensis ssp. noatunensis
(n = 22) included in this study were obtained from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) suffering from francisellosis, with
the exception of the type strain NCIMB 14265T [18] and
the Chilean Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) isolate UA2660
which were obtained from The National Collection of
Industrial, food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB) and Intervet Norbio AS, respectively (Table 1). The majority of

isolates were collected from cultured populations of cod
geographically dispersed along 1400 km of Norwegian
coast line during the period from 2004 to 2009. Four isolates were obtained from wild-cod, from the counties of
Aust-Agder, Vest-Agder, Rogaland and from the borders
of Rogaland and Hordaland (Table 1). An overview of geographical origin of isolates is presented in Figure 1. Isolates
of closely related Francisella spp., F. notunensis ssp. orientalis (n = 4) and F. philomiragia (n = 7), were also
included in this study. Isolate FoJ-001/02 (Ehime-1) was

designed using the Vector NTI Suite 9.0 program package
(InforMax Inc.). In addition, two pairs of flanking primers,
VNTR1-2F/R and VNTR2-2F/R were designed for the
purpose of nested PCR, as not all isolates were amplified
using the initial primers. The oligonucleotide primers
had Tm ranging from 40.9 to 55.4°C, and the annealingtemperature for each primer combination was therefore
optimized using gradient PCR with the isolate GM2212
DNA as template (Table 3). The amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction mixture containing 10 X buffer
(Promega) including 1.5 mmol-1 MgCl2, 2.5 mM dNTP
(Promega), 10 μmol-1 of each primer (Invitrogen), 2 μl
DNA and 0.6 U Thermal Ace™DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification was carried out in a Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf) with denaturation at 95°C for 5 min; 35
cycles with denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at X°C
(optimized annealing temperature Table 3) for 45 s and
extension at 72°C for 1 min, followed by prolonged extension at 72°C for 10 min and a short storage at 4°C. All
PCR-products were visualized using gel-electrophoresis. In
cases where the initial PCR did not amplify a target
sequence, several techniques were applied including
nested- (VNTR 1 and 2), touchdown- and gradient-PCR.
In the touchdown PCR, the amplification cycles were as
follows; denaturation at 95°C for 5 min; followed by
6 times of 3 cycles of; denaturation at 94°C for 45 s,
annealing for 45 s at 66-51°C with a reduction of 3°C at
each cycle, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. The rounds of
touchdown were immediately followed by 25 cycles with
denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 48°C for 45 s,
extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C
for 10 min before a short storage at 4°C. The gradient
PCR amplification was as follows: denaturation at 95°C for
5 min; denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, 2 and 4°C below and
over optimized annealing temperature (Table 3) for 45 s,
extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C
for 10 min before a short storage at 4°C.

(head kidney and/or spleen) from infected cod on agar
plates. Initial isolations were performed using blood agar
plates with 0.1% cysteine and 1% glucose as described by
Nylund et al. (2006) with subsequent growth in B1817
broth for cryopreservation [33]. However, most isolations
were performed using Cysteine Heart Agar (Difco) supplemented with 5% bovine blood (CHAB) as described in
Olsen et al. (2006) with slight modifications. These
included the addition of 50 μg ml-1 of ampicillin, 50-100
μg ml-1 of fungizone® and additional cysteine to a final
concentration of 0.2%. The ampicillin, fungizone®, bovine
blood and cysteine were added to the CHAB at 60°C. All
isolates were incubated at 20°C for 2-4 days (F. philomiragia) or two weeks (F. noatunensis). A Sanyo MIR-554 incubator was used for solid cultures whereas liquid culturing
was performed in an Infors Unitron incubator at 250 rpm.
Colonies from CHAB agar were dissolved in Eugon Broth
(Difco) for cryopreservation and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Genomic analysis

A preliminary genomic sequence from Francisella noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolate GM2212 (= F. piscicida,
DSM 18777T, CNCM-3511T, LMG24256T) was analyzed
for the presence of tandem repeat regions using the
software Tandem Repeats Finder [49]. This program
locates and displays tandem repeats in DNA sequences.
Loci with tandem repeats consisting of less than 15
nucleotides and more than four repeats were selected
(Table 2). The preliminary genomic sequence of F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolate GM2212 was generated
using the 454 pyro-sequencing technology [50,51] in cooperation with Intervet AS/ASA.

sequenced for each VNTR locus. PCR products were
purified using the E.Z.N.A Cycle-Pure Kit (OMEGA) as
described by the manufacturer. Sequencing was then
performed in both directions using the PCR-primers
(Table 3) and the ABI PRISM BigDye terminator chemistry (version 3.1) according to Applied Biosystems (ABI).
All sequences were assembled using the Vector NTI Suite
9.0 program (InforMax Inc.). Possible genetic location of
sequenced VNTR-loci was identified by GeneBank blastn
searches performed using the complete amplicon
sequence from each primer pair from either F. philomiragia or F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate.
Phylogenetic analysis

At each VNTR locus in a single taxon, the VNTR was
coded as a discrete character (i.e. 1-9, A-H) based upon
the specific number of repeats at the region in question.
These allele profiles were used to construct a data
matrix within the Mesquite System for Phylogenetic
Analysis (Maddison, W. P. and D.R. Maddison. 2009.
Mesquite: a modular system for evolutionary analysis.
Version 2.71 http://mesquiteproject.org). The datamatrix was exported as a nexus file into PAUP 4.0
(Swofford, D. L. 2003. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis
Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods). Version 4.
Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts)) for
phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining (NJ)
distance method [52]. The phylogenetic NJ analysis was
not bootstrapped as there were too few characters and
taxa for correct estimation of sampling error.

Test of VNTR stability

Since VNTR regions are considered to be one of the fastest evolving sequences of a genome, it was important to
test the stability of the selected VNTR regions both
in vitro and in vivo [53]. Mutations in VNTR regions have
been shown during in vitro growth of both Yersinia pestis
and Escherichia coli [54,55]. Therefore the effect of multiple passages of the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis
GM2212 isolate on VNTR stability was tested as follows: a
frozen first passage culture of the GM2212 isolate was
streaked for isolation on CHAB, one single colony was
transferred in each passage for 10 passages. DNA isolation,
PCR and sequencing were performed on a colony from
passage 10 as described above. PCR and sequencing were
performed for all VNTR loci for verification of copy numbers (GM2212-P10 Table 4). The in vivo stability of
F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate was tested
at different temperatures with material from challenge
experiments described below. Copy numbers at each
VNTR locus was confirmed through direct sequencing
using DNA extracted from kidney tissues of challenged
fish as templates (Table 4). Kidney tissue from one cod in
each group challenged with GM2212, and held at 10
(F10), 14 (F14) and 18°C (F18), was sampled for extraction
of bacterial DNA for direct sequencing. Tank conditions
for all groups were as for the challenge experiment of the
F10 group described in Nylund et al. (2006) [15]. The F14
and F18 group were bath challenged in 20 l of sea water
containing a final concentration of 2.25 × 106 bacteria/ml.
The bacterial suspension was prepared by inoculating

Results
Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) features

Sequencing of Francisella noatunensis and F. philomiragia
isolates (Table 1) showed variation in seven of the 11 tested
VNTR loci (Table 5). The remaining four VNTR loci were
discarded as they did not get amplified from all F. noatunesis isolates or showed no allelic variation among the isolates included in this study. The seven VNTR loci used in
this study had an allelic diversity ranging from two
(VNTR-5) to 17 (VNTR-4) alleles in all isolates included
(n = 33). The largest observed variation in allele sizes was
found in VNTR-4 and spanned from one to 32 repeats in
F. philomiragia isolates Fp080107-II and Fp1951, respectively. Primers for the seven informative VNTR loci
(Table 3) provided PCR-products for all F. noatunensis ssp.
noatunensis and orientalis isolates with the exception of
VNTR-1 in isolate UA2660 and VNTR-3 in Ehime-1.
VNTR-2 and 4 showed most variation among the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates (n = 22), with seven different

alleles in each, while only minor variation, two different
alleles, was found in VNTR-5. The F. noatunensis ssp. orientalis isolates (n = 4) had identical alleles at VNTR-5 and -6,
while VNTR-4 was shown to be the most polymorphic with
four different alleles. The repeats and attributes of each
VNTR locus in F. noatunensis can be viewed in table 2.
VNTR-4, -6 and -7 were successfully amplified from all isolates of F. philomiragia included in this study. It was not
possible to amplify VNTR-2 from the F. philomiragia isolate, Fp080107-I [48], and, with the exception of the amplification of VNTR-3 from DSM7535T, it was not possible to
amplify VNTR-1, -3 and -5 from these isolates (Table 5).
Among the F. philomiragia isolates most allele variation was
seen in VNTR-4, whereas no variations were detected in
sequences from VNTR-2 and -6. It is not known if the lack
of a PCR product for a given VNTR locus is a result of primer mismatch or absence of the VNTR locus in question.
Due to the preliminary status of the genome from which the
VNTR loci were identified, the genomic locations of the loci
remain unknown. Possible locations of the VNTR loci
within the genome of F. philomiragia were identified by
GeneBank blastn searches. The following matches were
identified (Table 6); VNTR-2 locus (186 bp query) matched
the intergenic segment located between the genes encoding
the Bor lipoprotein and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide
Phosphate -quinone reductase (1900473-1900533bp),
VNTR-4 sequence (394 bp query) matched the intragenic
segment in the DNA-directed DNA polymerase gene
(695610- 695415), VNTR-6 sequence (327 bp query)
matched the segment intragenically located in 50S ribosomal protein L10 gene (1129799-1130125) ,VNTR-7
sequence (458 bp query) matched the intragenically located
segment between and within the genes encoding the
FTN_1059 hypothetical protein and trigger factor protein
(1661303-1660846). No significant matches were identified
for VNTR-3. VNTR-5 and -1 were not amplified from DSM
7535, but a blastn search was performed using these VNTR
sequences obtained from F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis
GM2212 isolate. VNTR-5 displayed intragenic match for a
gene encoding the FTN_0396 hypothetical protein (495433496083) with 99% sequence-identity and E value of

Allele profiles

Variation in the VNTR loci was revealed by sequencing,
and these data were used to create allele profiles for all

isolates. Lack of amplifiable VNTR locus was interpreted
as a separate “missing” character. A complete overview
of the allele profiles is presented in Table 5. Analysis of
the seven VNTR loci revealed a total of 10 unique allele
profiles among the 22 F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis

The Blastn search was performed using the complete amplicon of the primer pairs. All locations were identified in F. philomiragia ATCC25017T (Accession number

isolate and these were termed profile I (n = 8), profile II
(n = 2) and profile III (n = 5); all isolates included in
these profiles were collected from farmed sites with the
exception of one wild isolate in profile II.
Profile I included the following isolates from farmed
cod: a) four isolates collected in the period of 2004-06
from the Rogaland county, b) one isolate from Sogn and
Fjordane county (2007) and c) three isolates from Møre
and Romsdal county (2006-07). The two isolates in profile II were collected from Rogaland (wild cod) and
Nordland (farmed cod) in 2006. A total of five isolates
were included in profile III: a) three isolates, including
two originating from broodfish populations, collected in
Hordaland county during the period 2005-06, and b)
two isolates, one sampled from farmed and one from a
wild/possible escaped farmed cod in Sogn og Fjordane
county in 2009. The remaining six cod isolates, including three isolates from wild cod, two from broodstock
populations (usually caught as wild cod) and one from a
production site, all possessed unique allele profiles. The
two isolates from wild cod in Aust- and Vest Agder
counties share allele profiles at five out of seven loci.
The allele profile of the Chilean isolate from Atlantic
salmon, UA2660, had a unique profile sharing only one
VNTR locus with the other isolates of F. noatinensis
ssp. noatunensis.
All seven VNTRs were obtained from the isolates of F.
noatunensis ssp. orientalis (n = 4) with the exception of
VNTR-1 from Ehime-1. None of the isolates had identical allele profiles and the allele profile of the Japanese
isolate Ehime-1, from farmed Three-line grunt (Parapristipoma trilineatum), was distinct from the three
Indonesian isolates from farmed tilapia (Oreochromis
spp.). None of the F. philomiragia isolates (n = 7) had
identical allelic profiles.
Phylogenetic relationship

The NJ phylogenetic analysis using the seven informative VNTR loci from the 33 Francisella spp. isolates
showed a subdivision of the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates (Figure 2). The majority of the isolates
from outbreaks of francisellosis in farmed cod group as

two distinct clades. These clades were named clade I
and III, as they correlate to the allele profiles (Table 5).
The phylogenetic analysis also separates the Chilean
UA2660 isolate from the Norwegian F. noatunensis ssp.
noatunensis isolates, and differentiated among the few
isolates of F. noatunensis ssp. orientalis, included.
Stability of VNTR loci

Examination of the stability of the VNTR loci revealed
changes in repeat numbers within two VNTRs of the F.
noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate (Table 4).
A shift in VNTR-1 was observed after 10 passages on
Cysteine Heart Agar with Blood (CHAB) at 20°C. This
mutation consisted of the addition of one repeat,
increasing the size from 7 to 8 repeats. There was also a
change in VNTR-6 after passage of isolate GM2212 in
cod held at 18°C. The number of repeats was reduced
from 10 to nine. The VNTRs did not change when the
isolate GM2212 was passed through cod held at 10 and
14°C. These results were verified by a repeating round
of PCR and sequencing. The remaining VNTRs were
not affected in this test.
Linkage disequilibrium

To avoid effects from host and geographical separation
the linkages disequilibrium was calculated for F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates (n = 22) only. The linkages disequilibrium was shown to be significant in the
LIAN 3.5 analysis, indicating a clonal population structure for the cod isolates. Standardized IAS was calculated
to 0.3925 at a significance of Ppara = 3.69 × 10-126.
Epizootiological data of isolates

There are several factors linking the isolates within
the F. noatunensis clades (Figure 2, Table 5). Clade I
consists of eight isolates where FnnR-001-04, -002-06,
004-06 and 017-05 were obtained from cod at one production site in Rogaland county during several outbreaks in the period of 2004-06 (Figure 1). These
isolates differ from an isolate (FnnH-016-08) obtained
from one of the broodfish company supplying the site.
On-growth sites were not involved. Three isolates

FnnMR-011-07, -013-07 and -005-06 of clade I were
from another county (Møre og Romsdal), and two of
these were obtained from cod with no traceable history.
The third isolate FnnMR-005-06 was obtained from a
site supplied by the same broodfish company as the host
for isolate FnnSF-012-07, which also belongs to clade I.
The latter isolate comes from another county, Sogn og
Fjordane. The host for FnnMR-005-07 was kept at an
on-growing site before transportation to the production
site in Møre og Romsdal. Clade III consists of five isolates, three from Hordaland (FnnH-007-06, -014-06,
NCIMB 14265T) and two from Sogn of Fjordane county
(FnnSF018-09,-019-09) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The latter two were sampled in the same fjord, FnnSF018-09
was isolated from farmed cod at a production site, while
Fnn-019-09 was isolated from a wild caught cod. The
wild caught cod had pellets in the gut and a morphology
suggesting that it originated from a production site
which lost fish during a francisellosis outbreak in 2009.
Of the last three isolates from clade III, one (NCIMB
14265T) was isolated from cod at a production site in

Hordaland, while FnnH-007-06 and FnnH-014-06 was
isolated from broodfish populations located at two sites
in the same county. This broodfish company was one of
the suppliers of cod to the production site in Sogn and
Fjordane (FnnSF018-09) and to one production site in
Hordaland (NCIMB 14265T). It is not known if the cod
at the two sites, Sogn and Fjordane and Hordaland
(FnnSF018-09 and NCIMB 14265T), were offspring
from the broodfish populations where FnnH-007-06 and
FnnH-014-06 were isolated.

Discussion
Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) system

Whole genome sequencing of bacteria has presented
new opportunities for identification of new genetic markers for separation of isolates. One such marker system
can be found by looking at VNTRs, i.e., single locus
sequences with short DNA repeats [40,57]. Micro satellites, a subset of VNTRs, with repeat motifs of nine bp
or less are often targeted due to higher mutational rate
[58,59]. However, such hyper variability, that may occur

Brevik et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:5
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/7/5

within some VNTRs, would complicate determination of
genetic relationships among strains using this method,
and hence, its use in phylogenetics may not be ideal
[45,54]. The mechanisms behind the length variation in
micro satellites is that of Slipped-Strand Mispairing
(SSM) during DNA polymerase mediated DNA duplication. However, mutations involving indels of large
copynumbers have been shown consistent with recombination-mediated events [54,59,60]. In Escherichia coli, an
average mutational rate of 6.4 × 10-4 was calculated over
28 VNTRs, and the rate seems to be dependent on
intrinsic properties such as numbers of repeats [54].
Variation in copy numbers at VNTR loci of certain sizes
may affect the efficiency of promoters, thus affecting the
coding potential of genes dependent on the genomic
locations and the indels of repeats [58,61-63]. For differentiation of bacterial isolates several VNTR loci are
combined in a Multiple Locus VNTR Analysis (MLVA),
a well established tool for epidemiological studies of
bacteria with highly fit clonal dominance [40-42,44,58].
One such bacteria is Francisella tularensis, the agent for
tularaemia [64]. This species consist of clonal geographical subspecies [39] that can be separated with the help
of VNTR markers [43-46,65]. A similar approach could
also be the solution for genotyping of Francisella isolates belonging to fish pathogenic Francisella spp.
Most MLVA systems applied in epidemiology are performed by multiplexing PCR-assays where VNTR size is
deduced by capillary electrophoresis allowing rapid
screening of large datasets [45]. Due to the relatively
few VNTR-loci included and that there were only 33
isolates available for analysis in this study, sequencing
was selected as a method for repeat number verification.
The sequencing also detected single nucleotide polymorphisms in addition to allele size. The future potential for use of multiplex PCR assays with dyed primers
and determining allele size by capillary electrophoresis is
still an option and is recommended for larger datasets.
This study presents a sequence based MLVA system
consisting of seven VNTR loci identified in the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate. When applied
to 33 Francisella strains including Norwegian and Asian
isolates of F. noatunensis, the MLVA provided the best
resolution shown for the fish-pathogenic Francisellae
so far. Due to the preliminary genome status of the
F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate a complete VNTR locus search has not been performed, thus
leaving the possibility for unidentified markers yet to be
discovered. Nonetheless strain typing of F. tularensis
isolates has been achieved with the use of as few as two
and six VNTR markers [43,65].
The exact location of the seven VNTR markers in the
F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis is not known, however,
blast searches indicate both intra- and intergenic

Page 11 of 14

location if the positions are homologous with that of the
F. philomiragia ATCC25017T isolate (Table 6).
The discriminatory power of the VNTR loci used in
this study, was not calculated as a Simpson`s index of
diversity. The reason for this is that the dataset does not
fulfill the criteria of a test population proposed by van
Belkum et al. (2007) [53], as isolates are predominately
from outbreaks in cultured populations of cod with
potential epizootic connections. The VNTR markers had
a typeability of 100% among the Norwegian isolates (n =
21), and with the exception of VNTR-1 and -3 for the
UA2660 and Ehime isolate respectively, all the VNTR
markers for F. noatunensis (n = 26) were amplified, indicating the usability of the typing system. Stability testing
showed variability within VNTR-1 and -6 from F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate when grown in
vitro for 10 passages at 20°C and in vivo in cod at 18°C.
Such single repeat changes are shown to occur in 80%
of mutational events with equal chance of being an
insertion or a deletion [54]. The sampled size was insufficient to assess the potential of hyper variable sites and
mutation rates in the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis
GM2212 isolate. VNTR mutational rates can differ
across loci [54,55], and could be a problem in studies of
phylogenetics and epizootics. Stability and introduction
of variation could be a result of bacterial phase variation
and thus a result of environmental factors such as nutritional substances present in the growth medium, temperature effects [60,63,66], or just simply be stochastical
events. However, four isolates (FnnR-001-04, -002-06,
004-06, 017-05) from different francisellosis outbreaks at
the same site during a two year period showed identical
allelic profiles indicating field stability and epizootic
coherence. The NJ dendrogram presented in this study
should not be viewed as a phylogenetic analysis as the
use of VNTRs and especially highly variable VNTRs create noise in the phylogenetic signal. The stability testing
in the study shows that this may be the case of the
VNTR-1 and VNTR-6. There are also too few isolates
and characters (VNTRs) included in the dataset to
attempt a proper analysis of genetic relationships.
F. noatunensis strains

A total of nine allele profiles were identified among the
Norwegian F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates (n =
21). Three of these contained more then one isolate
(profile I n = 8, profile II n = 2 and profile III n = 5)
and were identified using allelic profiles and visualized
in the NJ dendrogram. The remaining six isolates represent unique strains of which five originated from wild
cod and one from farmed cod (FnnH-020/09). Although
the dataset of Norwegian isolates is small the trend is
evident with only a few isolates occurring in outbreaks
of francisellosis in cod culture, and a high diversity of

Brevik et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:5
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/7/5

strains among the isolates from wild cod. The Chilean
isolate (UA2660) and the Norwegian cod isolates have
previously been reported to be highly similar based on
similarities in 16S sequence (99.8%) and in five housekeeping genes (Average Nucleotide Identity = 99.5%)
[22,29]. However, according to the VNTR analysis performed in this study, the UA2660 isolate from salmon
differs at six of seven markers compared to the Norwegian F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates from cod,
clearly separating them into two distinct branches in the
NJ dendrogram. The clear separation of these isolates
most likely reflects geographic origin and the ecological
differences between them (host-niche, freshwater vs.
marine environment). The allele profiles of the four F.
noatunensis ssp. orientalis isolates were unique, separating them into four different genotypes. Although the
sampling set is small it correctly reflects the geographical origin and, possibly, also the variation in niche.
There was no clear pattern in the clustering of the
F. philomiragia isolates.
Care is needed if phylogenetic relationships are to be
estimated based on VNTRs [54,58], however the deeper
nodes in the dendrogram (Figure 2) a) between the species of F. philomiragia and F. noatunensis, b) between
the subspecies F. noatunensis ssp. orientalis and F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis and c) among the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates of Norway (NCIMB 14265T)
and Chile (UA2660), were similar to the tree topology
obtained based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene and datasets from housekeeping genes [19,22].
Epidemiology of the F. noatunensis

Considering the results of the present study some reflections regarding the epizootics of the F. noatunensis are
possible. However, it is necessary to acknowledge the
shortcomings of the dataset as it covers about 40%
of the official diagnosed outbreaks of francisellosis
in Norway and that it only includes 4 wild isolates
collected in different counties.
Generally, the low allelic diversity among the isolates
collected from cultured cod compared to the isolates
from wild cod, indicate that the spreading could be a
result of human activity. This is also supported by the
fact that the production cycle of cod in Norway involves
transport of farmed cod along most of the Norwegian
coast. Similarly, human activity has also been suggested
as a cause for the geographical distribution of clonal isolates of Bacillus anthracis [37].
Although the VNTR markers provide a good starting
point for studies of epizootics it may still be difficult to
identify sources of infection as fish from different populations are mixed during the production, and, it is very
difficult to avoid interactions between cultured and wild
fish species. In the case of clade I with the isolates

Page 12 of 14

FnnR-001-04, -002-06, 004-06 and 017-05, the new generations of cod used for restocking after initial outbreak
were probably infected by the initial isolate in the population at that site. The source of the initial infection was
most likely cultured cod, since isolates belonging to the
same genotype have been found at production sites in
other counties, while the wild type isolate (FnnR-003/
06W) from the same county belonged to another clade.
In clade III, the isolates from a known broodfish supplier were identical to isolates from production sites
where the aforementioned broodfish company was one
of the suppliers of fish. Hence, all of these cases could
be a result of transmission through movement of offspring from broodfish. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the sites used for on-growth are
unknown. Vertical transmission would greatly impact
the disease management and needs to be addressed in
further studies.

Conclusions
We present the first VNTR analysis of fish pathogenic
Francisellae. Seven polymorphic microsatellites were
identified in a partial genome sequence of the F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis GM2212 isolate. A sequence
based MLVA system of these seven VNTR-loci was
applied to 33 aquatic Francisella isolates, including both
F. philomiragia (n = 7) and F. noatunensis isolates (n =
26). All VNTRs were amplified in the F. noatunensis isolates, with the exception of VNTR-1 in UA2660 and
VNTR-3 in Ehime-1. Among the Norwegian F. noatunensis ssp. noatunensis isolates (n = 21), including isolates from both farmed (n = 17) and wild cod, a total of
nine allelic profiles were identified. The majority of
farmed isolates were divided into two allelic profiles,
indicating low allelic variation in isolates from outbreaks
in cod culture compared to isolates collected from wild
cod. The allelic profile of the Chilean F. noatunensis ssp.
noatunensis isolate reflected the geographical and host
divergence when compared to Norwegian cod isolates.
All F. noatunensis ssp. orientalis isolates (n = 4) show a
unique allelic profile. The four VNTRs amplified from
F. philomiragia provided a unique allelic profile for all
these isolates. The results show that this MLVA system
should provide a good starting point for future studies
of epizootics of F. noatunensis.
