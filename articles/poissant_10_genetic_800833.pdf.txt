Genetic linkage map of a wild genome: genomic
structure, recombination and sexual dimorphism
in bighorn sheep

Abstract
Background: The construction of genetic linkage maps in free-living populations is a promising tool for the study
of evolution. However, such maps are rare because it is difficult to develop both wild pedigrees and corresponding
sets of molecular markers that are sufficiently large. We took advantage of two long-term field studies of pedigreed
individuals and genomic resources originally developed for domestic sheep (Ovis aries) to construct a linkage map
for bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We then assessed variability in genomic structure and recombination rates
between bighorn sheep populations and sheep species.
Results: Bighorn sheep population-specific maps differed slightly in contiguity but were otherwise very similar in
terms of genomic structure and recombination rates. The joint analysis of the two pedigrees resulted in a highly
contiguous map composed of 247 microsatellite markers distributed along all 26 autosomes and the X
chromosome. The map is estimated to cover about 84% of the bighorn sheep genome and contains 240 unique
positions spanning a sex-averaged distance of 3051 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 14.3 cM. Marker
synteny, order, sex-averaged interval lengths and sex-averaged total map lengths were all very similar between
sheep species. However, in contrast to domestic sheep, but consistent with the usual pattern for a placental
mammal, recombination rates in bighorn sheep were significantly greater in females than in males (~12%
difference), resulting in an autosomal female map of 3166 cM and an autosomal male map of 2831 cM. Despite
differing genome-wide patterns of heterochiasmy between the sheep species, sexual dimorphism in recombination
rates was correlated between orthologous intervals.
Conclusions: We have developed a first-generation bighorn sheep linkage map that will facilitate future studies of
the genetic architecture of trait variation in this species. While domestication has been hypothesized to be
responsible for the elevated mean recombination rate observed in domestic sheep, our results suggest that it is a
characteristic of Ovis species. However, domestication may have played a role in altering patterns of heterochiasmy.
Finally, we found that interval-specific patterns of sexual dimorphism were preserved among closely related Ovis
species, possibly due to the conserved position of these intervals relative to the centromeres and telomeres. This
study exemplifies how transferring genomic resources from domesticated species to close wild relative can benefit
evolutionary ecologists while providing insights into the evolution of genomic structure and recombination rates
of domesticated species.

evolution. However, such resources for free-living populations of non-model species are still rare because it is
difficult to acquire large enough pedigrees and associated sets of molecular markers [1,2]. The utility of
genetic linkage maps developed using pedigreed wild
populations has been demonstrated by pioneering studies on the genetic architecture of trait variation [3-8],
genetic constraints [9] and patterns of linkage

disequilibrium [10,11] under semi-natural settings. Yet,
we still know very little about these specific topics and
the potential to address a variety of additional subjects
remains largely unexploited [12]. The development of
linkage maps for additional natural populations is therefore clearly desirable.
The bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), a mountain
ungulate inhabiting western North America [13], is one
species for which linkage map construction using freeliving individuals is possible. DNA samples from intensively studied pedigreed populations have been collected
over many decades by field biologists (e.g. [14,15]) and a
large set of polymorphic microsatellite markers was
recently derived from domestic sheep genomic resources
[16]. A bighorn sheep linkage map would enable one to
dissect the molecular genetic basis of fitness-related
traits, study the molecular basis of inbreeding depression
and genetic rescue [14], and potentially reveal the molecular genetic basis of human-influenced evolution [17].
In addition to generating species-specific research
opportunities, a bighorn sheep map would shed light on
the levels of genomic re-organization between bighorn
and domestic sheep. While few differences are expected
between these species due to their recent divergence
(~3 million years [18]), shared karyotype [19] and ability
to produce fertile hybrids [20], enough time has elapsed
for rearrangements to accumulate [21]. For example,
numerous small-scale rearrangements have been documented between domestic sheep and the slightly more
genetically distant domestic goat, Capra hircus [22],
which can also interbreed with domestic sheep [23].
Reorganization has also been observed among domestic
sheep breeds [4,24]. A bighorn sheep linkage map could
therefore be used to detect recent chromosomal rearrangements in sheep species and would help with inferring
ancestral marker order for regions showing intra-specific
variation.
While genome structure is anticipated to be similar
between closely related sheep species, expectations for
sex-averaged and sex-specific recombination rates are
less clear. This is because domestication may have led
to an increase in recombination rates and unusual malebiased heterochiasmy in domestic sheep [25,26].
However, the role of domestication in the evolution of
mammalian recombination rates remains unclear due to
the absence of data on wild relatives [27,28]. A bighorn
sheep linkage map would enable such a comparison and
help to determine if domestication played a role in the
evolution of the atypical recombination patterns seen in
domestic sheep.
In this article, we report on the development of a firstgeneration bighorn sheep genetic linkage map based on
the genotyping of 252 polymorphic microsatellites in
498 animals from two pedigreed wild populations:

Page 2 of 12

National Bison Range (NBR), Montana, USA [14], and
Ram Mountain (RM), Alberta, Canada [15]. The availability of multiple mapping populations permitted a
comparison of intra-specific variability in map characteristics as well as the construction of a more contiguous
map that should in principle be more representative of
the species as a whole. Marker synteny and order were
then compared between bighorn sheep and domestic
sheep to test for recent chromosomal rearrangements.
Finally, we contrasted intervals between species in terms
of sex-averaged length and sexual dimorphism to gain
insights into the impacts of domestication on the evolution of mammalian recombination rates.

Results
Genotyping success and marker polymorphism

Genotyping success was high (~95%) in both populations and is summarised in Table 1 with additional
details available in Additional file 1: List of markers,
map position and variability. Marker diversity (number
of alleles and observed heterozygosity) and the number
of informative meioses tended to be greater in the NBR
population despite a smaller number of genotyped
individuals.
Population-specific maps

Linkage analysis for population-specific datasets yielded
very similar outcomes. For this reason, only salient features of these maps are presented here while specific
details are made available in Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Comparison of bighorn sheep populationspecific maps. In brief, all markers assigned to a linkage
group (LG) appeared to be part of the same chromosome in both populations. Map contiguity was slightly
greater in the NBR map, with 230 markers distributed
along 29 LGs compared to 232 markers distributed
along 34 LGs in the RM map. The NBR sex-averaged
map spanned 2910 cM while the RM sex-averaged map

spanned 2581.4 cM. For both populations, while the
overall female autosomal map was longer than the
equivalent male map (ratio of 1.13 in NBR and 1.06 in
RM), two chromosomes (5 and 15) had longer male
maps than female maps. In addition, NBR linkage
groups 10, 21, 24 and 25 were longer in the male map
while RM linkage groups 2a, 2b, 3c, 8a, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15,
16a, 18, and 19 were longer in the male map.
The most likely marker order differed between maps
in only one instance. This involved two tightly linked
markers on chromosome 1 (MCM137 and BM7145) for
which order was reversed between maps. However,
while support for the inferred order was moderate in
the NBR map (log 10 likelihood difference of 2.02,
MCM137-BM7145, 0.47 cM), support for the alternate
order in the RM map was weak (log10 likelihood difference of 0.34, BM7145-MCM137, 0.86 cM).
A comparison of the intervals present in both maps
revealed that localized sex-averaged recombination rates
were generally similar between populations (r2 = 0.61,
Additional file 3: Comparison of intervals present in
both population-specific bighorn sheep maps). The sum
of these intervals was accordingly similar (2382.9 cM in
NBR vs. 2427.8 cM in RM). In both populations, intervals were more often longer in the female map than in
the male map (102 vs. 61 in NBR and 92 vs. 72 in RM)
but only significantly so in the NBR population (NBR, p
< 0.01; RM, p = 0.14). Sexual dimorphism in interval
length (sexual dimorphism index, SDI) was significantly
more often in the same direction than not (94 out of
160, p < 0.05). However, interval-specific SDI was only
weakly correlated between populations (r2 = 0.03, 95%
CI = 0 - 0.14).
Integrated bighorn sheep map

Combining the two datasets in a single linkage analysis
produced a highly contiguous map (Figure 1, Additional
file 1). In that analysis, 247 markers were assigned to 27
LGs representing all ovine autosomes and the X chromosome. Since 7 markers were perfectly linked to
another marker, the map only truly depicted the locations of 240 unique mapped positions for an average of
8.9 ± 4.3 loci per chromosome. Sex-averaged intervals
were on average 14.3 ± 9.1 cM long and usually shorter
than 30 cM (Table 2, Additional file 1). The sex-limited
and pseudo-autosomal regions of chromosome X were
separated by slightly more than 50 cM in the sex-averaged map due to an absence of linkage in the male map
but we decided to leave the LG intact due to evidence
for tighter linkage (21.5 cM) in the female map.
OarFCB11 was excluded from chromosome 2 because it
was estimated to be more than 50 cM away from its closest neighbouring marker (INHA). BMS1247, BMS1948
and HBB2/ii could not be assigned to a chromosome

Page 3 of 12

while GHRHR was excluded due to having too few
informative meioses. The length of the complete sexaveraged map was 3050.9 cM while the autosomal
female and male maps were 3166.1 cM and 2832.2 cM
long (1.12 ratio), respectively. Intervals were significantly
more often longer in the female map than in the male
map (119 vs. 87, p < 0.05), however four chromosomes
(5, 15, 18 and 24) had longer male than female chromosome maps.
Comparison of bighorn sheep and domestic sheep maps

Synteny was highly similar between the bighorn sheep
and the domestic sheep International Mapping Flock
(IMF) maps with only three observed differences
(Figure 1). First, FCB19 mapped to chromosome X in
bighorn sheep but to chromosome 15 in domestic
sheep. Second, BM4005 mapped to chromosome 2 in
bighorn sheep but to chromosome 24 in domestic
sheep. Finally, neither of the two markers amplified in
bighorn sheep with the primer pair used for MCMA54
in domestic sheep mapped to the location of this marker
predicted from the IMF map (chromosome 21). Instead,
MCMA54/i and MCMA54/ii mapped to bighorn sheep
chromosomes 1 and 9, respectively. For the three other
primer pairs which amplified two unlinked markers in
bighorn sheep (TGLA377, BMS2466, MNS97A), one of
the markers mapped to its predicted position while the
other mapped to a different chromosome (TGLA377/ii,
MNS97A/ii and BMS2466/ii were assigned to chromosome 3, 5 and 10, respectively). One additional putative
difference between species was observed on chromosome 10 for markers not mapped in the IMF but
mapped in Soay sheep, a feral domestic sheep breed [8].
The most likely order for this region in bighorn sheep
was OarSEJ10, OarSEJ11, AGLA226 and OarSEJ13 versus AGLA226, OarSEJ10, OarSEJ11 and OarSEJ13 in
Soay sheep. The difference in log10 likelihood between
marker orders in bighorn sheep was 3.01.
The length of orthologous intervals was highly correlated between species (r 2 = 0.71, p < 0.01, Figure 2,
Additional file 4: Comparison of intervals present in bighorn sheep and domestic sheep maps) and their sum
very similar (3044 cM in bighorn sheep vs. 3001 cM in
domestic sheep; a difference of ~1.5%). This excluded
the intervals located at the tip of bighorn sheep chromosomes 5 (MNS97A/ii to WNT3K13, 6 cM) and 10 (OarSEJ10 to AGLA226, 0.5 cM) that have no equivalent in
the IMF map. Intervals did not tend to be larger in one
species than the other (105 larger in domestic sheep vs.
98 larger in bighorn sheep, p = 0.67). Based on coverage
of these intervals in the version 4.7 IMF map, we estimated the current genome coverage by the integrated
map in bighorn sheep to correspond to ~ 84% of the
domestic sheep linkage map.

sheep linkage groups (LGs) are on the left while the domestic sheep LGs are on the right. Lines connect orthologous loci. Markers not mapping
to the same location in the two species are in bold while markers only mapped in bighorn sheep are italicized. The thin vertical line connecting
OarFCB11to chromosome 2 indicates that this marker was assigned to that chromosome but was excluded from the linkage analysis for being
more than 50 centimorgans (cM) away from the closest neighbouring marker. That interval was not included in the total map length estimate
and its length in the figure is arbitrary. The ruler at the top left corner represents a cM scale.

Mean SDI in length (± 1 SD) considering only orthologous intervals was 0.10 ± 1.27 in bighorn sheep and
-0.34 ± 1.33 in domestic sheep. The positive mean SDI
in bighorn sheep reflected a tendency for larger intervals
in the female map (114 out of 197, p < 0.05) while the
negative mean SDI in domestic sheep indicated a tendency for larger intervals in the male map (120 out of
197, p < 0.01). Interval-specific SDI was significantly
correlated between species (r2 = 0.21, p < 0.01, Figure
3). The intercept and slope were both significantly positive (intercept ± 1 SE: 0.42 ± 0.08, p < 0.01; slope: 0.95
± 0.06, p < 0.01). In general, SDI values in bighorn
sheep tended to be greater than in domestic sheep (124
times out of 189, P < 0.001).

Discussion
As expected, marker synteny and order were generally
congruent between bighorn sheep maps. This suggests
that our dataset was mostly free of errors and justified

combining individual maps. The NBR population was
generally more informative than the RM population.
This was likely a consequence of the more complete
NBR pedigree combined with greater marker variability
resulting from recent admixture [14,16]. Nonetheless,
information provided by both populations was generally
complementary and ultimately allowed construction of a
highly contiguous map covering approximately 84% of
the species genome. This is greater coverage than for a
similar map for free-ranging red deer (Cervus elephus,
39% [3]) and almost on a par with one for Soay sheep
(Ovis aries, 90% [4]) for which virtually all genetic
resources developed for domestic sheep can be used.
The coverage of our map is therefore similar to a firstgeneration map for a domestic species and outstanding
for a wild species.
Recombination fractions were very similar between
bighorn sheep populations. Combining pedigrees into a
single analysis therefore likely resulted in map distances

that were generally representative of the species as a
whole. While genuine intra-specific differences may
exist in map distances, the integrated map is likely to
more accurately depict recombination fractions of individual populations than the estimates derived from the
population-specific maps. This is because interval

estimates for population-specific maps were often based
on relatively few informative meioses, especially in the
RM population. Relying on distances from the integrated
map in future downstream population-specific studies is
therefore advisable.
As predicted, marker synteny and order were generally
congruent between the Ovis species maps. This is in line
with the expectation of 1 to 2 rearrangements per million years in most mammalian lineages [20]. However, it
has to be acknowledged that marker coverage was generally too sparse to detect subtle rearrangements. Crossspecies comparison was also made difficult by the fact
that some primer pairs amplified two loci. For example,
BM4005 mapped to different locations in each species
but we are aware of a second locus for BM4005 in bighorn sheep that could not be reliably genotyped. Since
primers for BM4005 are also known to amplify multiple
sets of bands in domestic sheep [29], the BM4005 loci
mapped in the two species are probably not orthologous. Similarly, FCB19 mapped to chromosome X in
bighorn sheep but to chromosome 15 in domestic
sheep. This marker is definitely autosomal in domestic
sheep given that a fraction of males are undoubtedly
heterozygous (J. Maddox, unpublished data) so the discrepancy in map location is not spurious. However,
FCB19 markers amplified in the two species might not
be orthologous given that a single primer pair can
amplify multiple markers. In contrast, convincing evidence for cross-species rearrangement came from the
primers used to amplify MCMA54 in domestic sheep.
In that case, neither of the two markers amplified using
this primer pair in bighorn sheep mapped to the location of the MCMA54 locus in domestic sheep (the
MCMA54 primers amplified two band sets that both
mapped to chromosome 21 in domestic sheep vs. 1 and
9 in bighorn sheep). The comparison of our map with
the Soay sheep map [8] also suggested the presence of a
minor rearrangement on chromosome 10. While some
of these cases may depict genuine rearrangements, it is
clear from this study that the organization of the two
species genomes is very similar.
Genomic analysis in a close relative of domestic sheep
offered the opportunity to infer ancestral marker order
for chromosomal regions showing variation among
domestic sheep breeds [4,26]. For chromosome 1, the
order of two loci located in the rearranged region
(MCM137 and BM7145) was similar between the NBR
and the IMF maps [24]. On the other hand, the most
likely marker order in the RM map was similar to an
alternate order documented in Soay sheep [24]. Inferred
marker orders were arguably not significantly more
likely than the alternate orders. Yet, it is worth noting
that this chromosomal region was the only one for
which the most likely marker order differed between

Poissant et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:524
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/524

bighorn sheep maps. If both orders are present in bighorn sheep, it would mean that this region is either
prone to rearrangements or that polymorphism in marker order originated millions of years ago rather than
recently as hypothesised by McRae and Beraldi [24]. For
a second putatively varying region located on chromosome 12 [4], we only successfully amplified one
(BM4025) of the two markers used to infer rearrangement in domestic sheep (BM4025 and TGLA53). However, marker order in bighorn sheep for that region
appeared to be the same as in the IMF map based on a
marker located only 2 cM away from TGLA53 in
domestic sheep (CSAP01E). Therefore, the IMF
appeared to portray the ancestral marker order.
The comparison of orthologous intervals suggested
high similarity in localized sex-averaged recombination
rates between the Ovis species. While the near perfect
concordance in total map length (~1%) may be coincidental, given that variation in the order of 10% has been
documented among domestic sheep breeds [4], it nonetheless strongly suggests little difference between species. Assuming that results were not unduly biased by
missing and erroneous genotypes (which can be a concern when using CRI-MAP in complex pedigrees
[2,30]), it appears that the elevated recombination rates
observed in domestic sheep are a characteristic of Ovis
species rather than a consequence of domestication.
Alternatively, recombination rates may have increased
rapidly in both species since their recent divergence as a
consequence of domestication in domestic sheep and
for a different reason in bighorn sheep. But, this later
explanation seems unlikely since the evolution of mean
recombination rates in mammals is generally slow and
most likely governed by neutral processes [28].
Contrary to what has been found for domestic sheep,
recombination rates in bighorn sheep tended to be
greater in females than in males. The unusual pattern
observed in domestic sheep therefore appeared to be species-specific. This finding is not overly surprising given
the low phylogenetic inertia of the trait [31]. The magnitude of heterochiasmy in sheep species is also arguably
modest when compared with species such as the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus, ratio of 5.7:1 [32])
or the zebrafish (Danio rerio, ratio of 2.74:1 [33]). Yet,
the presence of male-biased recombination in domestic
sheep remains puzzling given that recombination in placental mammals is generally female-biased [26]. An intuitive explanation is that altered sex-specific recombination
patterns in domesticated mammals (cattle are also atypical, exhibiting no heterochiasmy [34]) might be an incidental result of strong artificial selection during the
process of domestication. Alternatively, the unusual heterochiasmy pattern documented in the domestic IMF
might simply be an artefact resulting from the facts that

the population size was small, all sires descended from a
single grand-sire and there were only three maternal
grandsires compared to 13 granddams. Knowing that
recombination rates can vary substantially among individuals, and that such differences can have a large genetic
component (e.g. [35]), it could be that the paternal
grand-sire was characterised by an uncommonly high
recombination rate breeding value and/or that some of
the maternal grandsires were characterised by uncommonly small recombination rate breeding values (assuming that male and female recombination rates are
positively genetically correlated [36]). A comparison of
sex-specific recombination rates in additional domestic
sheep pedigrees might answer this question.
As in other taxa (e.g. [37,38]), great variability was
observed in patterns of heterochiasmy across and along
chromosomes. For example, recombination appeared to
be male-biased for a few chromosomes despite the presence of a genome-wide tendency for greater recombination in females. However, no clear pattern emerged at
the chromosomal level with the NBR and RM maps
yielding mainly inconsistent results. At the interval
scale, patterns of sexual dimorphism were conserved
across populations and species. This means, for example, that genomic regions characterized by low SDI
values in one species were mirrored by similarly low
SDI values in the other species. This could be due to
conserved sex-specific and/or sex-biased recombination
hot-spots. However, fine-scale analyses of recombination
rates in other pairs of closely related species (e.g. human
and chimpanzee [39,40]) suggest that this is unlikely at
the inter-specific level. Inter-specific congruence in localized recombination rate sexual dimorphism could also
be due to the position of intervals along chromosomes
relative to centromeres and telomeres, irrespective of
the exact location of individual hot-spots. For example,
in humans, recombination tends to be greater in females
near centromeres but greater in males near telomeres
(reviewed in [41]). In domestic sheep, recombination in
telomeric and centromeric regions is usually greater in
males (J Maddox, unpublished data). To verify if a similar pattern was also present in bighorn sheep, we contrasted bighorn sheep interval-specific SDI to the
relative distance of these intervals from centromeres and
telomeres inferred from the location of these intervals in
the IMF map. A pattern similar to that seen in domestic
sheep was observed, with recombination being greater
in males near centromeres and telomeres while being
greater in females in more central parts of chromosomes
(Figure 4).

Conclusion
We constructed a first-generation bighorn sheep linkage map using DNA from two wild pedigreed

in return. For example, we have demonstrated how linkage mapping in bighorn sheep can be used to infer
ancestral marker order in domestic sheep. Also, by comparing the domestic sheep map with the map of a close
wild relative, we were able to determine that the elevated recombination rates observed in domestic sheep
were likely a characteristic of Ovis species while the
unusual male-biased heterochiasmy might have been a
consequence of domestication. Finally, we have demonstrated that interval-specific patterns of sexual dimorphism could be conserved among closely related species,
possibly due to the position of these intervals relative to
centromeres and telomeres.

population and genomic resources originally developed
for domestic sheep. Since bighorn sheep and domestic
sheep genomes are very similar, future efforts to
increase marker density in specific chromosomal
regions should be relatively straightforward. This could
be achieved using bighorn sheep single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) markers recently discovered
using the OvineSNP50 Beadchip [42], additional
microsatellites already mapped in domestic sheep and/
or by taking advantage of the recently acquired domestic sheep genome sequence [43] to develop novel markers. The high similarity between the genomes of the
two species should also greatly facilitate future efforts
to assemble a bighorn sheep genome sequence and to
develop additional SNPs.
The main reason for developing genomic resources in
bighorn sheep is to allow studies of complex trait
genetic architecture and evolution under natural settings. In the NBR population, genomic resources will
enable investigations into the genetic basis of fitness,
inbreeding depression and genetic rescue [14]. In RM, it
will be possible to study the genetic architecture of additional traits including body mass, horn size and animal
personality [15,44]. Finally, genomic information could
eventually be combined with population genetic
approaches to study adaptive population differentiation
[45], especially in the context of parasitism [46] and
selective harvesting [47].
While resources developed for domestic sheep are
obviously highly useful to bighorn sheep research, genomic research in bighorn sheep can also yield valuable
information through comparisons with domestic sheep

Methods
Study populations
National Bison Range

The NBR population was established by transplanting
four rams and eight potentially pregnant ewes from
Banff National Park (Alberta, Canada) in 1922 [14]. The
population remained isolated until the introduction of
five rams in 1985 and 10 sheep (three rams and seven
ewes) from 1990 to 1994. Fourteen of these more
recently introduced animals were derived from a native
Montana population (Sun River) while one ewe was
from a native Wyoming herd (Whisky Basin). Individuals from these latter introductions were highly successful [14], resulting in relatively high levels genetic
diversity and linkage disequilibrium [16]. All sheep were
individually recognizable through physical characteristics
from 1979 onward and collection of blood/tissue samples for genetic analysis began in 1988. Our analyses
included a combination of descendants from the original
introduction, recent immigrants and admixed
individuals.
Ram Mountain

The RM population is native to a small isolated mountain range located about 50 km east of the Canadian
Rockies in Alberta, Canada [15]. Immigration and emigration is highly restricted and mainly limited to
exchanges with a smaller unmonitored herd located on
the same mountain range. Animals were captured in a
corral trap baited with salt and marked with unique tags
as lambs or yearlings. Population monitoring began in
the early 1970s and collection of hair/blood/skin samples for genetic analysis began in 1988.
Mapping pedigrees

In both populations, parentage was originally determined with ~30 microsatellite loci using the 95% confidence threshold in Cervus [48]. For the RM population,
the markers used are presented in [15] and references
therein. For the NBR population, the markers included
the ones listed in [14] as well as BL25, BM1225,

Poissant et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:524

BM1818, BM4505, BM4630, BM848, BMC1222, MAF92,
OarJMP29, TGLA126, TGLA387, EPCDV21, MCMA54/
i and MCMA54/ii. Laboratory methods are detailed in
[14,15] and references therein. References for primer
sequences are available in Additional file 1. Reconstructed pedigrees were used to identify animals
expected to contribute the most information for linkage
mapping purposes (e.g. large sibships and their parents)
and these animals were then genotyped at more than
200 microsatellite loci (details below). Once genomewide genotypes were obtained, animals for which genotyping success was low (< 65%) were discarded and the
pedigrees were updated based on new parentage analyses. Following these steps, no more than 2-3 mismatches were observed between parent-offspring pairs.
The software Pedcheck [49] was then used to identify
Mendelian inconsistencies which were corrected when
possible or otherwise eliminated by deleting the genotypes of the individuals involved. The resulting NBR and
RM mapping pedigrees spanned seven and six generations and included 212 and 286 related individuals,
respectively. Pedigree illustrations produced using Pedigree Viewer [50] are available in Additional file 5: Bighorn sheep mapping pedigrees. The NBR pedigree
contained 184 paternal links (42 sires, mean ± 1 SD of
4.4 ± 3.5 offspring per sire) and 173 maternal links (51
dams, 3.4 ± 2.1 offspring per dam). The RM pedigree
consisted of 168 paternal links (43 sires, 3.9 ± 3.3 offspring per sire) and 172 maternal links (71 dams, 2.4 ±
1.3 offspring per dam).
Microsatellite selection and genotyping

In addition to markers used for the initial pedigree
reconstruction, microsatellites putatively distributed
throughout the genome of our focal species were identified using the domestic sheep IMF map version 4.7
[16,51]. Markers were selected based on their predicted
genomic location and level of polymorphism (assessed
in ~30 individuals/population) with the aim of optimising genomic coverage and meiotic information. Most
but not all markers were typed in both populations.
Eleven markers were only genotyped in the NBR population while 17 were only typed in the RM population
(see Additional file 1). Laboratory methods are available in [16] and references for primer sequences
[8,16,51-55] are presented in Additional file 1. In total,
252 markers, amplified using 244 pairs of primers (8
primer pairs amplified two markers: BM3212,
BMS2466, HBB2, MCMA54, MNS97A, MNS101A,
TGLA176, TGLA377), were included in the linkage
analysis. Descriptive statistics (typing success, number
of alleles and observed heterozygosity) were obtained
using MSA 4.05 [56].

Linkage analysis

We constructed population-specific linkage maps as well
as an integrated map where populations were treated as
independent families using CRI-MAP [57]. The same
construction procedure was used for all maps. First,
two-point linkage analyses were performed for all pairs
of markers assuming equal recombination rates between
the sexes using a modified version of CRI-MAP developed by Liu and Grosz [58]. The program AUTOGROUP [58] was then used to identify sets of markers
likely residing in the same LG (pairwise LOD scores >
4). For markers unassigned to a LG following that analysis, two-point LOD scores were inspected and in cases
where the most likely linkage was with a marker known
to be adjacent in the domestic sheep IMF map, the marker was assumed to be part of the same LG in bighorn
sheep. In cases where multiple bighorn sheep LGs were
composed of markers known to be part of the same
chromosome in domestic sheep, two-point LOD scores
between markers residing at the end of each bighorn
sheep LG were inspected and linkage was assumed
when the LOD scores were among the highest for these
respective markers. For each putative LG, the most
likely marker order was recovered using the BUILD and
FLIPSn options of a CRI-MAP version recently developed by Jill Maddox and Ian Evans (2.503) that more
efficiently deals with large datasets. Specifically, we first
constructed LGs using BUILD and a LOD > 3 threshold.
Markers were then successively added to these LGs
using less stringent LOD thresholds of 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.
The FLIPSn option was then used to compare the likelihood of alternate orders produced by shuffling up to
five adjacent loci and markers were re-ordered when a
more likely order was identified. Doubtful tight double
recombinants were identified using the CHROMPIC
option of CRI-MAP and responsible erroneous genotypes were corrected when present. Finally, sex-averaged
and sex-specific recombination fractions for individual
LGs were estimated using the FIXED option of CRIMAP 2.503 and transformed to centimorgans (cM)
using the Kosambi map function [59]. In cases where
estimated sex-averaged intervals were greater than 50
cM, LGs were broken in two and separate analyses were
performed for markers on each side of the interval.
Comparison of linkage maps

In order to assess intra- and inter-specific variability in
genomic structure and recombination rates, we compared the NBR and RM linkage maps as well as the bighorn sheep integrated map and domestic sheep IMF
map version 4.7. Differences in marker synteny and
order were identified by visual inspection. In cases
where the most likely marker order differed between

Poissant et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:524
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/524

populations/species, support for alternate orders was
determined by comparing log10 likelihoods. The relative
sex-averaged length of different maps was compared by
summing the length of intervals that were present in
both maps (raw data available in Additional file 3 and
Additional file 4).
To test for a genome-wide difference in sex-averaged
recombination rate between population/species, we used
two-tailed sign tests contrasting the number of shared
intervals greater in length in one map than in the other.
We also used reduced major axis regression to describe
the relationship between interval-specific sex-averaged
recombination rates between populations/species. The
slopes, intercepts and their errors were obtained using
the formula from Sokal and Rohlf [60] implemented in
the software RMA version 1.17 [61]. Confidence intervals including the ones for correlation coefficients were
obtained by performing 10000 bootstraps.
To assess variation in heterochiasmy across populations and species genomes, we quantified sexual
dimorphism for individual intervals using the sexual
dimorphism index (SDI) of Lovich and Gibbons [62].
This index is considered the best estimator of sexual
dimorphism because it is intuitive, linear, symmetrical,
and directional [63]. The SDI was obtained by subtracting 1 from the ratio of the largest sex-specific
value to the smallest sex-specific value. Following convention, estimates were then made positive when the
female value was largest and negative when the male
value was largest. We tested for the presence of genome-wide bias in sexual dimorphism using sign tests
and described the relationship in interval-specific sexual dimorphism between maps using reduced major
axis regression.
Since the length of an interval partly depends on the
subset of markers included in a linkage analysis, we
assessed the validity of comparing intervals between
maps constructed using different number of markers
(the domestic sheep IMF map 4.7 contains about 1400
markers). To accomplish this, we repeated cross-species
analyses using information derived from additional linkage maps based solely on markers mapped in both species. Results and conclusions were essentially the same
as for previous analyses and are therefore not presented.
These maps are available in Additional file 6: Bighorn
sheep and domestic sheep linkage maps based on shared
markers only.
