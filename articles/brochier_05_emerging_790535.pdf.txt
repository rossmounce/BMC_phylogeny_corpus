Abstract
Background: The concept of a genomic core, defined as the set of genes ubiquitous in all genomes of a
monophyletic group, has become crucial in comparative and evolutionary genomics. However, it is still a
matter of debate whether lateral gene transfers (LGT) may affect the components of genomic cores,
preventing their use to retrace species evolution. We have recently reconstructed the phylogeny of
Archaea by using two large concatenated datasets of core proteins involved in translation and
transcription, respectively. The resulting trees were largely congruent, showing that informational gene
components of the archaeal genomic core belonging to two distinct molecular systems contain a coherent
signal for archaeal phylogeny. However, some incongruence remained between the two phylogenies. This
may be due either to undetected LGT and/or to a lack of sufficient phylogenetic signal in the datasets.
Results: We present evidence strongly favoring of the latter hypothesis. In fact, we have updated our
transcription and translation datasets with five new archaeal genomes for a total of 6384 and 2928 amino
acid positions, respectively, and 25 taxa. This increase in taxonomic sampling led to the nearly complete
convergence of the transcription-based and translation-based trees on a single phylogenetic pattern for
archaeal evolution. In fact, only a single incongruence persisted between the two phylogenies. This
concerned Methanopyrus kandleri, whose placement remained strongly biased in the transcription tree due
to its above average evolutionary rates, and could not be counterbalanced due to the lack of availability of
closely related and/or slower-evolving relatives.
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of evidence that the phylogenetic signal harbored
by components of the archaeal translation apparatus is confirmed by additional markers belonging to a
second molecular system (i.e. transcription). This rules out the risk of circularity when inferring species
evolution by small subunit ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein sequences, since it has been suggested
that concerted LGT may affect these markers. Our results strongly support the existence of a core of
proteins that has evolved mainly through vertical inheritance in Archaea, and carries a bona fide
phylogenetic signal that can be used to retrace the evolutionary history of this domain. The identification
and analysis of additional molecular markers not affected by LGT should continue defining the emerging
picture of a genuine phylogenetic core for the third domain of life.

Background
The discovery that Lateral Gene Transfers (LGT) play a
major role in the evolution of prokaryotic organisms has
raised concerns about the possibility of reconstructing
species phylogenies [1]. Some biologists even believe that
LGT have obscured the phylogenetic record to such an
extent that the task may be in fact hopeless [1,2]. However, others have argued that the careful selection of a
'core' of genes that have been refractory to transfer may
help solving (at least partly) this conundrum [3-6]. The
genomic core concept, i.e. the set of homologous genes
present in all -or most-genomes of a phylogenetically
coherent group, has become crucial in comparative and
evolutionary genomics [7]. Indeed, the identification of
'genomic cores' can provide crucial information on the
composition of ancestral genomes [8,9], as well as on
organisms evolution at various phylogenetic depths
[6,10,11]. However, homology-based analyses to define
core genes cannot discriminate between vertically transmitted components and horizontally exchanged ones (i.e.
"cryptic orthologous replacements" [7]). Thus, it is still a
matter of debate whether Lateral Gene Transfers (LGT)
may affect the components of genomic cores, preventing
their use to retrace species evolution. Nevertheless, the
extent and nature of the horizontal component of
genomic cores can be identified by molecular phylogeny.
The use of conserved gene cores to retrace species evolution has mainly focused on the translation apparatus,
since the ribosome appears to be one of the best conserved macromolecular machines in the living world. The
concatenation of either bacterial and archaeal ribosomal
protein sequences has produced global phylogenies that
are roughly similar to those obtained with both small and
large ribosomal subunit rRNA genes (16S and 23S rRNA)
[4,5,11]. Moreover, careful individual analyses have indicated that ribosomal proteins have been apparently never
exchanged between the three Life domains, and rarely
between different lineages within domains [4,5,12,13].
However, it may be argued that concerted LGT involving
rRNA and ribosomal protein genes, since they belong to
the same macromolecular machinery, could escape detection in such analyses. Nevertheless, this hypothesis could
be discarded if phylogenies based on additional sets of
genomic core proteins belonging to other molecular
machineries are congruent with those of the components
of the translation apparatus.
Accordingly, we have recently performed an in-depth
analysis of proteins involved in transcription and translation from Archaea [11]. Individual phylogenies of these
proteins confirmed that the components of these informational molecular machineries are little affected by LGT
in the archaeal domain, and permitted the assembly of
two large concatenated datasets of likely vertically-transmitted genes to reconstruct the phylogeny of the third

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/36

domain of life [11]. The trees based on the 'translation'
dataset (53 ribosomal proteins, Figure 1A) and the 'transcription' dataset (11 RNA polymerase subunits and 3
transcription factors, Figure 1B) were globally congruent,
suggesting that the two informational systems contain a
coherent phylogenetic signal for the archaeal phylogeny
[11]. However, a number of incongruent nodes remained
between the two trees (Figure 1A and 1B). First, the hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri was
close to other methanogens in the translation tree (Figure
1A), whereas it emerged with a strong statistical confidence at the base of the euryarchaeal phylum in the transcription tree (Bootstrap Value BV = 90%, Figure 1B). A
second incongruence concerned the position of the euryarchaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, since this archaeon was
grouped, albeit with weak support (BV = 41%), with Thermoplasmatales in the translation tree (Figure 1A),
whereas in the transcription tree it was strongly placed as
sister group to the clade composed of Methanosarcinales
and Halobacteriales (BV = 100%) (Figure 1B). Finally,
although in both phylogenies Methanobacteriales and
Methanococcales were located in-between Thermococcales and a large clade comprising Thermoplasmatales,
Archaeoglobus, Methanosarcinales and Halobacteriales,
they were paraphyletic in the translation tree (Figure 1A)
whereas they were monophyletic in the transcription tree
(Figure 1B).
In the case of M. kandleri, we suggested that the discrepancy between the translation and transcription trees was
likely due to the very fast evolutionary rate of its RNA
polymerase subunits (reflected by the very long branch of
M. kandleri in the transcription tree, Figure 1B). Such an
accelerated rate of evolution may be due to the lack in this
archaeon of the critical transcription factor TFS [11,14]. A
Long Branch Attraction (LBA) artefact [15] between the
very long branch of M. kandleri and the outgroup (i.e. Crenarchaeota) may thus be responsible for the basal position of this methanogen in the transcription tree. In
contrast, the incongruence between the two trees in the
position of A. fulgidus, and in those of Methanobacteriales
and Methanococcales may be either due to undetected
LGT, and/or result from an insufficient phylogenetic signal in the two protein datasets. Only in the latter case
should an increased taxonomic sampling help resolving
this incongruence, whereas if LGTs are responsible, the
addition of more taxa should not increase resolution and
will possibly add more confusion. The recent sequencing
of several new genomes from Euryarchaeota now permits
tackling these two alternatives.

Results and discussion
We have updated our previous datasets of the components of the translation and transcription machineries
[11] to include a total of 25 Archaea. In particular, we

and transcription factors (B)
Unrooted Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees based on concatenation of ribosomal proteins (A) and RNA polymerase subunits
and transcription factors (B). For clarity, the two datasets from Brochier et al. (2004) were scaled down to the same number
of species by removing Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosarcina acetivorans from the transcription dataset. Numbers at nodes
are bootstrap values (BV). The scale bars represent the number of changes per position for a unit branch length. Trees were
produced by exhaustive searches performed by PROTML. Branch lengths and likelihood values were calculated by TREE-PUZZLE (JJT model including a Γ-correction (8 categories of sites)). Numbers at nodes are bootstrap values computed with PUZZLEBOOT from 1000 replications. Asterisks indicate constrained nodes (supported by BV = 100% in preliminary NJ and
heuristic ML analyses). The names of groups showing incongruent positions between the two trees are underlined.

included the psychrophilic methanogen Methanogenium
frigidum [16] and the mesophilic methanogen Methanococcoides burtonii [16]-two lineages belonging to Methanomicrobiales [17] and Methanosarcinales [18],
respectively. We also included the halophile Haloferax volcanii [19], the Thermococcale Thermococcus gammatolerans
(Yvan Zivanovic and Fabrice Confalonieri, personal communication), and Nanoarchaeum equitans, a highly divergent archaeon that has been suggested as the

representative of a new archaeal phylum, the Nanoarchaeota [20-22]. As in our previous studies [5,11] we did not
include any eukaryotic outgroup in order to limit biases
due to LBA.
As described previously [11], separated phylogenetic analyses were performed on each of these new datasets in
order to identify and remove potential lateral gene transfer (LGT) events (data not shown). Despite the fact that

most relationships were largely unresolved in several trees
due to the small size of most proteins, we checked for any
possible strongly supported departure from undisputed
nodes in the archaeal phylogeny, such as the clades of
Thermoplasmatales, Halobacteriales, Sulfolobales, Thermococcales, Methanosarcinales and Methanococcales.
Following the addition of novel taxa, no new clear-cut
case of LGT could be observed with respect to these nodes,
confirming that transfers are indeed very rare for these
markers[5,11]. A few proteins gave an instable placement
for Nanoarchaeum equitans. However, since the position of
this taxon in the archaeal phylogeny has not yet been
firmly tested, we did not judge these proteins as clear-cut
cases of LGT. The 53 ribosomal proteins and the 14 proteins involved in transcription were thus concatenated
into two large 'translation' and 'transcription' datasets,
whose sizes were 6384 and 2928 amino acid positions,
respectively.
Exhaustive Maximum Likelihood (ML) searches were performed on the two updated translation and transcription
fusion datasets, with a few constraints given to undisputable nodes (i.e. supported by BV = 100% in preliminary
Neighbor Joining and ML heuristic analyses (not
shown)). The best ML topologies for the translation and
transcription datasets are presented in Figure 2A and 2B,
respectively. Topologies not significantly less likely than
the ones presented in Figure 2 differed by minor rearrangements on nodes that are feebly supported by bootstrap, such as the branching order within halobacteriales
in the transcription tree, or the grouping of methanopyrus
with methanococcales/methanobacteriales in the translation tree (not shown).
Interestingly, the addition of five new archaeal taxa led to
convergence of the transcription and translation trees on
a coherent phylogenetic pattern, to the exclusion of the
position of M. kandleri-still emerging after Thermococcales in the translation tree (Figure 2A), but recovered as a
very long branch at the base of the euryarchaea in the transcription tree (Figure 2B)-(the same trees were obtained
when removing M. kandleri from the datasets, data not
shown). This only incoherence between the two phylogenies is most likely due to the fact that the LBA artefact
affecting the position of M. kandleri in the transcription
tree persisted even after increase in taxonomic sampling,
due to unavailability of closely related and slower evolving species. Nanoarchaeum equitans emerged as a separate
branch distinct from those leading to Crenarchaeota and
Euryarchaeota domains, in both translation and transcription trees (Figure 2A and 2B), supported by strong bootstrap values (BV = 100%). This position is congruent with
previous results based on ribosomal proteins concatenation [22]. T. gammatolerans branched off of at the base of
Thermococcales, that were confirmed as the first emerging

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/36

euryarchaeal phylum, as in our previous studies [5,11].
Interesting, Methanobacteriales and Methanococcales
formed now a monophyletic group in both translation
and transcription trees (BV = 55% and 82%, Figure 2A and
2B, respectively). This suggests that the paraphyly of these
groups observed in our previous translation tree (Figure
1A) was likely incorrect due to a lack of phylogenetic signal rather than to a LGT bias. The Methanobacteriales/
Methanococcales monophyletic group is sister to a large
cluster including both methanogenic and non-methanogenic species: A. fulgidus, the three Thermoplasmatales,
the three Halobacteriales and the five Methanomicrobia
(Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales) (BV = 97%
and BV = 77%, Figure 2A and 2B, respectively). This supports the hypothesis of an ancient origin of methanogenesis in Archaea followed by subsequent loss in some
lineages (A. fulgidus, Thermoplasmatales and Halobacteriales). Moreover, the position of A. fulgidus, while left
uncertain in our previous analyses (i.e. either sister-group
of Thermoplasmatales in the translation tree, or of Halobacteriales/Methanomicrobia in the transcription tree,
Figure 1A and 1B, respectively) was now robustly indicated as sister to Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales
and Halobacteriales in both translation and transcription
trees (BP = 85% and 96%, respectively, Figure 1A and 1B).
The strong placement of A. fulgidus in our updated translation tree is likely due the stabilisation of the node following addition of new taxa. This result further supports
the hypothesis of a late and independent emergence of
aerobic respiration in Euryarchaeotes (Halobacteriales),
possibly via the recruitment of bacterial genes. Finally,
both translation and transcription trees confidently
grouped M. burtonii and M. frigidum with the three Methanosarcina (BV = 100% and BV = 100%, Figure 2A and BV
= 100% and BV = 79%, Figure 2B, respectively) within the
Methanomicrobia group. The very close relationship
between M. burtonii and the three Methanosarcinales
constitutes a novel phylogenetic argument justifying its
inclusion in the order Methanosarcinales, at present based
only on 16S rRNA phylogeny [18].

Conclusion
The congruence we obtained between the archaeal phylogenies based on the components of the translation and
transcription machineries strongly supports the existence
of a core of genes that evolved mainly through vertical
inheritance in Archaea, and carry a bona fide phylogenetic
signal that can be used to infer the phylogeny of this
domain. Our results confirm also that the addition of new
taxa strongly improves phylogenetic inference, and support the idea that evolutionary considerations should be
included in the choice of new genomes to be sequenced.
However, our conclusions should not be considered as
the "last word" on the subject. For example, the misplacement of M. kandleri at the base of Euryarchaea in the tran-

scription tree was not cured by the increase in taxonomic
sampling. The inclusion of sequences from slower evolving and close relatives, when they will be available, may
help resolving this bias. Similarly, the very long branch
displayed by N. equitans (Figure 2A and 2B) suggests that
its placement as a separate branch distinct from that leading to Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, although congruent between the transcription and translation trees,
should be taken with caution due to the risk of an LBA
artefact. The analysis of the components of additional
molecular systems and the inclusion of more taxa may
eventually lead to a confident placement for these two
interesting species in the archaeal phylogeny.
Finally, our results make us confident that the construction of a phylogeny that retraces the vertical history of the
archaeal domain is a feasible task. The identification and
analysis of additional molecular markers not affected by
LGT on large phylogenetic scales and their phylogenetic
analysis by approaches that minimise reconstruction artefacts should continue defining the emerging picture of a
genuine phylogenetic core for the Archaea. The application of a similar strategy to the bacterial and eukaryal
domains could also lead to a bona fide reconstruction of
their respective evolutionary histories.

Methods
In order to update the datasets of our previous analysis
[11], we included the two methanogens Methanogenium
frigidum [16] and Methanococcoides burtonii [16], the halophile Haloferax volcanii [19], the Thermococcale Thermococcus gammatolerans (Yvan Zivanovic and Fabrice
Confalonieri, personal communication), and Nanoarchaeum equitans. In addition, the sequences of the two
Methanosarcinales Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosarcina acetivorans were added to the ribosomal dataset.
Sequences were retrieved by TBLASTN at genome
sequencing web sites for H. volcanii http://
halo.umbi.umd.edu/cgi-bin/blast/blast_hvo.pl, M. burtonii and M. frigidum http://psychro.bioinformat
ics.unsw.edu.au/genomes/index.php, or using BLASTP in
NCBI for N. equitans, M. acetivorans and M. mazei [23]. For
each dataset, novel sequences were manually added to
previous alignments by using the ED program of the
MUST package [24]. Regions were the alignment was
ambiguous were removed from the each dataset.
Trees were computed by a number of different
approaches. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees were calculated
by the NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP package [25],
using Maximum Likelihood (ML) distance matrices (JTT
model including a Γ-correction) computed by TREE-PUZZLE 5.1 [26]. Heuristic ML trees were computed using
PHYML with the JTT model including a Γ-correction [27].
Exhaustive tree topology searches with limited constraints

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/36

were performed using PROTML of the MOLPHY package
[28]. The likelihoods and branch lengths of ML topologies
were performed by TREE-PUZZLE (JTT model including a
Γ-correction). For exhaustive ML searches, constraints
(asterisks in Figures 1 and 2) were given to undisputable
nodes (supported by BV = 100%), based on preliminary
NJ and ML heuristic analyses (not shown).
The SEQBOOT program of the PHYLIP package [25] was
used for the generation of bootstrapped datasets, and
PUZZLEBOOT [29] and CONSENSE in the PHYLIP package [25] were used for bootstrap value calculations on
1000 replications and consensus tree reconstructions,
respectively.
Datasets and their corresponding phylogenies are available on request from CB.
