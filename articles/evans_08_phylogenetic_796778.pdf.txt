Abstract
Background: Polypodium hydriforme is a parasite with an unusual life cycle and peculiar
morphology, both of which have made its systematic position uncertain. Polypodium has traditionally
been considered a cnidarian because it possesses nematocysts, the stinging structures
characteristic of this phylum. However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies using 18S rDNA
sequence data have challenged this interpretation, and have shown that Polypodium is a close
relative to myxozoans and together they share a closer affinity to bilaterians than cnidarians. Due
to the variable rates of 18S rDNA sequences, these results have been suggested to be an artifact
of long-branch attraction (LBA). A recent study, using multiple protein coding markers, shows that
the myxozoan Buddenbrockia, is nested within cnidarians. Polypodium was not included in this study.
To further investigate the phylogenetic placement of Polypodium, we have performed phylogenetic
analyses of metazoans with 18S and partial 28S rDNA sequences in a large dataset that includes
Polypodium and a comprehensive sampling of cnidarian taxa.
Results: Analyses of a combined dataset of 18S and partial 28S sequences, and partial 28S alone,
support the placement of Polypodium within Cnidaria. Removal of the long-branched myxozoans
from the 18S dataset also results in Polypodium being nested within Cnidaria. These results suggest
that previous reports showing that Polypodium and Myxozoa form a sister group to Bilateria were
an artifact of long-branch attraction.
Conclusion: By including 28S rDNA sequences and a comprehensive sampling of cnidarian taxa,
we demonstrate that previously conflicting hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic placement of
Polypodium can be reconciled. Specifically, the data presented provide evidence that Polypodium is
indeed a cnidarian and is either the sister taxon to Hydrozoa, or part of the hydrozoan clade,
Leptothecata. The former hypothesis is consistent with the traditional view that Polypodium should
be placed in its own cnidarian class, Polypodiozoa.

Background
Polypodium hydriforme is an endocellular parasite whose
unusual life cycle, peculiar morphology, and high rates of
DNA evolution, have led to much controversy regarding
its phylogenetic position within metazoans [1-5]. Polypodium spends most of its life inside the oocytes of acipenseriform fishes (sturgeons and paddlefish). During this
time, Polypodium develops from a binucleate cell into an
inside-out planuliform larva and then into an elongate
inside-out stolon; the epidermal cell layer is located internal to the body and the gastrodermis is located externally
[6-8]. The embryo, larva and stolon are surrounded by a
protective polyploid cell, which also functions in digestion [7]. Just prior to host spawning, Polypodium everts to
the normal position of cell layers, revealing tentacles scattered along the stolon. During eversion, the yolk of the
host oocyte fills the gastral cavities of the parasite, supplying the future free-living stage with nutrients [6,7]. Finally,
upon emerging from the host egg in fresh water, the freeliving stolon (Figure 1A) fragments into individual medusoid-like forms (Figure 1B) that go on to multiply by
means of longitudinal fission, form sexual organs, and
ultimately infect host fish with their gametophores [6-9].
Two conflicting hypotheses have been proposed regarding
the phylogenetic placement of Polypodium. The first, more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/139

traditional hypothesis is that Polypodium is a cnidarian.
Some have suggested it is nested within a derived group of
hydrozoans, the Narcomedusae [10-13] or the cnidarian
class Scyphozoa [14]; while others have suggested it
belongs to a separate cnidarian class, Polypodiozoa
[1,15,16]. The assignment of Polypodium to Cnidaria is
based primarily on morphological evidence, most notably
the fact that Polypodium possesses nematocysts [17,18],
the stinging structures characteristic of all cnidarians. In
addition, the presence of tentacles and overall body-plan
organization of Polypodium are reminiscent of cnidarians,
although it is unclear if the adult free-living stage is
homologous to a polyp or medusa stage. This hypothesis
is supported by a cladistic analysis of small subunit
nuclear ribosomal DNA (18S rDNA) sequences in conjunction with morphological characters (including nematocysts) [2]. In this study, Polypodium falls within the
medusozoan clade of cnidarians, although the non-cnidarian placozoan, Trichoplax [19,20], also fell within this
clade, rendering Cnidaria paraphyletic.
The second hypothesis is that Polypodium is the sister
taxon to Myxozoa, a diverse group of parasites in aquatic
animals, and that Polypodium + Myxozoa is the sister group
to Bilateria [2-4]. This hypothesis is derived from cladistic
analyses utilizing 18S rDNA sequences [2-4]. However,

because Polypodium and myxozoans have unusually high
divergence rates in their 18S rDNA sequences, these cladistic analyses have been criticized by a number of
authors who suggest that the data might be unduly
affected by long-branch attraction (LBA) [5,21,22].
Despite some attempts to overcome the effects of LBA
through the use of a maximum likelihood (ML) approach
[21-23] and pruning long branches [5,22], these results
have been largely silent on the placement of Polypodium.
For instance, Kim et al. [22] applied a maximum likelihood approach to 18S rDNA sequence data and found
that myxozoans and Polypodium did not group together.
Instead, Polypodium was part of an unresolved polytomy
that included several cnidarian lineages and Trichoplax, as
well as myxozoans + Bilateria. Most recently, JimenezGuri et al. [24] utilized multiple protein-coding gene
sequences in a ML analysis and found the myxozoan, Buddenbrockia plumatellae nested within cnidarians. Unfortunately, this study had relatively limited sampling of
cnidarians and did not include Polypodium.
In an attempt to resolve this controversy, we sequenced an
additional marker in Polypodium, a partial gene sequence
of the large nuclear ribosomal unit (28S rDNA), and
greatly expanded the taxonomic sampling of cnidarian
sequences. Using this approach, we provide evidence that
Polypodium is nested within Cnidaria and does not group
with myxozoans.

Results
Sampled taxa
All taxa used in this study are arranged taxonomically in
Table 1. 155 sequences were obtained from GenBank. 45
new cnidarian sequences for 18S and 59 for 28S (including 2 new 18S and 2 new partial 28S from Polypodium
taxa) were generated for this study and deposited in GenBank (see Table 1 for accession numbers). Polypodium
hydriforme sequences were obtained from both North
American and Eurasian hosts. Eurasian samples were collected from two individuals of Acipenser ruthenus. North
American samples were collected from Polyodon spathula
and Scaphirhynchus platorynchus. This is the first reported
presence of Polypodium infection in Scaphirhynchinae.
While Polypodium was recovered from the oocytes of S. platorynchus, the sample from which we extracted sequence
data was found externally attached to its presumed host.
More specific collection data for Polypodium specimens are
associated with each sequence submitted to GenBank (see
Table 1 for accession numbers).

All Polypodium sequences were newly generated for this
study. We did not include the previously published 18S
Polypodium sequence (GenBank accession number
U37526) because of concern over the quality of the
sequence which included a number of ambiguities. Fur-

thermore, while the two new Polypodium 18S sequences
(from hosts Acipenser ruthensus and Polyodon spathula) differed from each other by a total of 8 sites they differed
from #U37526 by 77 and 83 sites respectively. These differences included a large number of insertions and deletions. The two new 28S sequences (from hosts Acipenser
ruthensus and Scaphirhynchus platorynchus) only differed
from each other by 2 sites.
Position of Polypodium
The complete combined dataset of 18S rDNA and partial
28S rDNA contains 4842 characters, 2901 of which are
variable and 2124 parsimony informative. Both the ML
and parsimony topologies reconstructed from the combined dataset suggest that Polypodium is nested within a
monophyletic Cnidaria, and myxozoans are the sister
taxon to bilaterians (Figure 2). The ML bootstrap values
supporting a monophyletic Cnidaria (including Polypodium), a monophyletic Medusozoa (including Polypodium) and the Polypodium + hydrozoan clade are 73, 67
and 73 respectively (Figure 2A, and Additional file 1). Parsimony analysis of the combined dataset differs from that
of ML in that Polypodium is nested within a group of
hydrozoans, the leptothecates (Figure 2B). The parsimony
bootstrap values supporting a monophyletic Cnidaria and
Hydrozoa, with Polypodium nested within these clades are
50 and 51 respectively (Figure 2B). The clade nested
within hydrozoans, that includes Polypodium + leptothecates is weakly supported in the sub-sampling tests with a
bootstrap value of less than 50.

The analyses using partial 28S rDNA sequences alone
(129 sampled taxa) contains 1756 characters, 1196 of
which are parsimony informative. The ML topology using
this dataset reveals Polypodium nested within Cnidaria,
specifically within leptothecate hydrozoans, (Additional
file 2). This analysis however fails to recover a monophyletic Cnidaria, as the anthozoans are placed outside
the Cnidaria + Bilateria clade. Analysis of the 18S rDNA
dataset alone (132 taxa, 3038 characters, 1469 parsimony
informative) under both optimality criteria conflicts with
the combined and partial 28S topologies. The 18S rDNA
topology for both criteria place Polypodium at the base of
Bilateria (Figure 3A, Additional files 3, 4 and 5). However,
the ML topology also reflects a sister relationship between
Polypodium and myxozoans (Figure 3A and Additional file
3A) while the parsimony topology does not (Additional
files 4 and 5). Moreover, under parsimony criteria the
position of myxozoans is dependent upon how gaps are
coded: if gaps are coded as a fifth character state, myxozoans are placed as a highly derived clade of bilaterians
(Additional file 4); if gaps are coded as missing, myxozoans are placed as sister to all metazoans (Additional file
5). The 18S analysis showing placement of Polypodium
with Bilateria, and more specifically as sister to myxo-

zoans, is consistent with previously reported studies using
the same marker [2-4], but raises similar concerns of longbranch attraction [5].
Test of long-branch attraction
Myxozoans and Polypodium have unusually high rates of
evolution in their 18S and 28S rDNA sequences relative to
the other sampled taxa. To investigate the influence of
myxozoans on the placement of Polypodium, we removed
the myxozoans from our three datasets and re-ran each
analysis. Under the ML analysis of 18S rDNA, the removal
of myxozoans results in the placement of Polypodium
nested within Cnidaria (Figure 3B and Additional file 3B).
This result suggests that the placement of Polypodium at the
base of bilaterians in the 18S analysis (Figure 3A) was
indeed an artifact of LBA. The placement of Polypodium
within Cnidaria was not effected by the removal of myxozoans in the 28S (Additional file 6) and combined datasets (Additional file 7).

To investigate the possible role of LBA on myxozoan
placement, we removed Polypodium from the combined
ML analyses and found that it did not affect the position
of Myxozoa at the base of the Bilateria (not shown). Given
that bilaterians also form long branches, we tried removing all bilaterian sequences in the combined ML analysis.
This resulted in a Myxozoa + Polypodium clade nested
within Cnidaria (not shown). However, when Polypodium

and bilaterians were removed, myxozoans fell outside the
cnidarians (not shown). Similar effects of myxozoan
placement to long-branches were also found in parsimony analyses of the combined dataset (not shown).

Discussion
Polypodium is a cnidarian
Our metazoan dataset of 18S and partial 28S rDNA
sequences, with a large taxonomic sample of cnidarians,
places Polypodium within a monophyletic Cnidaria. This
accords with the fact that Polypodium possesses nematocysts [17,18] and a cnidarian-like body plan [7-9,12]. The
precise placement of Polypodium within Cnidaria is less
certain. The ML combined analysis places Polypodium as
sister to Hydrozoa (Figure 2A), a hypothesis consistent
with the suggestion that Polypodium be considered a separate class of cnidarians, Polypodiozoa [1]. By contrast, the
combined parsimony analysis (Figure 2B) and the ML
analyses of 28S alone (Additional file 2 and 6) place Polypodium within the hydrozoan clade Leptothecata. Given
that leptothecates have relatively high rates of evolution
within hydrozoans, one possible explanation for the conflicting hypotheses is that the placement of Polypodium
within leptothecates is an artifact of LBA and that the combined data, in conjunction with the ML approach (Figure
2A), overcame this localized LBA artifact.

Evolution of Polypodium life-history characters
Although the fresh water habitat of Polypodium is unusual
for cnidarians, it is not unheard of, especially within
hydrozoans. For instance, the model organism Hydra and
the jellyfish Craspedacusta are both exclusively fresh-water
hydrozoans. Hydra and Craspedacusta are distantly related
[25] and our analyses do not indicate a close phylogenetic
affinity of Polypodium to either of the clades containing
these taxa. Thus, it appears that in the evolution of cnidarians, invasion to fresh-water habitats has happened at
least three separate times.

Although Polypodium is the only known intracellular cnidarian parasite, other cnidarians have adopted parasitic
life-styles [11,26-29]. For example, parasites belonging to
the Narcomedusae (Hydrozoa) have been reported to live
in the stomach cavities of other narcomedusae [11,27]
and anthomedusae [27]. In addition, the sea anemone
Edwardsiella lineata parasitizes the stomach cavity of the
ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi [28] and the anemone
Peachia quinquecapitata is reported to parasitize the stomachs of hydromedusa [29].
Effects of long-branch attraction
The well-documented effects of long-branch attraction
artifacts (reviewed in Bergsten [30]) are particularly concerning when investigating relationships amongst earlydiverging metazoans, where rates between lineages vary
greatly [22]. Suggestions for avoiding LBA artifacts include
choice of appropriate markers [31,32], increased taxonomic sampling to effectively break up long branches
[33,34] and utilization of best-fit models that incorporate
rate variation [21-23]. Previous conflicting reports that
show Polypodium and myxozoans form a sister taxon to
Bilateria [2-4] can be explained by limited taxon sampling
and an inadequate number of informative characters in
their analyses, both of which confound long-branch problems. In this study, the increased taxonomic sampling of
cnidarians and the addition of 28S rDNA sequence data
proved critical to placing the highly divergent Polypodium
taxon within Cnidaria. The choice of optimality criteria
(ML vs. parsimony) both supported Polypodium as a cnidarian but did affect the placement within Cnidaria.
Polypodium and Myxozoa
Our analyses are inconclusive in the placement of Myxozoa within metazoans. We found that myxozoans consistently grouped with long-branched taxa and that removal
of long-branches resulted in myxozoans being placed to
the next longest branch. For example myxozoans group
with Polypodium in the absence of Bilateria and group with
Bilateria in the absence of Polypodium (not shown).

Jimenez-Guri et al. [24] sampled the myxozoan, Buddenbrockia, and found it to fall within Cnidaria, as the sister

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/139

group to two hydrozoan representatives and a single scyphozoan. Previous studies have suggested a sister group
relationship between cnidarians and myxozoans [2-4],
and some morphological evidence has been used to support this view [35]. Although our present study does not
support this relationship, further investigation is merited.
Myxozoans are a highly diverse group (reviewed in Kent et
al. [36]) that comprise two clades, the Myxosporea and
the Malacosporea [37]. We were only able to include 28S
rDNA sequences from myxosporeans, although the malacosporean Buddenbrockia was included in our 18S analysis
and found to group with other myxozoans and outside of
Cnidaria. Future studies with a comprehensive sampling
of myxozoans together with Polypodium, in a dataset that
includes a large taxonomic sampling of cnidarians,
should shed further light on the relationships between
myxozoans and Polypodium.

Conclusion
Although previous molecular phylogenetic hypotheses
conflicted with the traditional interpretation of cnidarian
affinity for Polypodium, the molecular evidence we present,
using an augmented dataset, ultimately confirms and reconciles this traditional hypothesis and suggests that Polypodium is indeed a cnidarian. This study also reaffirms the
importance to large taxonomic sampling and inclusion of
additional informative characters for avoiding longbranch attraction artifacts.

Methods
DNA isolation, amplification and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy kits
according to manufacturer's protocol (QIAGEN Inc., Mississauga, ON) or a standard phenol/chloroform protocol.
The latter method involved tissue digestion with proteinase K (20 mg/ml) in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-CL pH 8.0,
5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 2%SDS), extraction
with phenol/chloroform (1:1), precipitation with 2.5 vol.
95% EtOH, and elution in TE or H2O.

An approximately 1.8 kb portion of the gene coding for
18S was amplified and sequenced with universal eukaryotic primers as described by Medlin et al. [38], with the
annealing temperature modified to 57°C. With the exception of Polypodium samples, a nearly complete, roughly 3
kb portion of the gene coding for 28S was amplified and
sequenced with an approach modified from that reported
in Collins et al. [25]. 28S was directly amplified in two
fragments
with
combinations
of
primers
F63mod+R2077sq and F1379+R3264 from Medina et al.
[39] or newly developed medusozoan specific primers
F97+R2084 and F1383+R3238 (F97: CCYYAGTAACGGCGAGT, R2084: AGAGCCAATCCTTTTCC, F1383:
GGACGGTGGCCATGGAAGT, and R3238: SWACAGATGGTAGCTTCG). Amplifications of 28S were conducted

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:139

with the following thermal profile: 4 minutes at 94°C; 30
cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 1 minute at 45°C, and 3
minutes at 72°C; and 10 minutes at 72°C. For Polypodium,
a portion of the 5' end of 28S (approx. 0.8–1.0 kbps) was
amplified using two universal metazoan primers (fw1and
rev2) as reported by Sonnenberg et al. [40]. Sequencing
was carried out using amplification primers and F635sq
and R635sq from Medina et al. [39].
All gene fragments were purified and sequenced by
Cogenics, Inc. (Houston, TX) and assembled and edited
using Sequencher v4.5 (Gene Code Co., 2005). Sequences
for each marker were aligned using the program MUSCLE
[41]. The 28S sequence alignment was then trimmed to
reflect only that region which included sequence data for
Polypodium. This trimmed 28S dataset was analyzed separately and used in conjunction with the complete 18S
sequences to create the combined dataset.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both maximum likelihood (ML) and parsimony criteria. ML
searches were performed using GARLI v0.951.OsX-GUI
[42] under an assumed GTR model with rates estimated
from the data. The assumed model of nucleotide substitution was selected by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as implemented in ModelTest [43]. Each run
was repeated 10 times from random starting trees using
default termination conditions. Each run gave identical
topologies and similar likelihood scores. 100 bootstrap
replications were run in GARLI v0.951.0sX-GUI [42]
under the same parameters.

To assess the effect that omitting length-variable regions
has on topology, we removed these regions from the combined dataset, using the less stringent settings of Gblocks
[44]. This dataset contained 126 metazoan taxa, 2415
characters, 1391 of which are parsimony informative. We
found that removal of length-variable regions had no
effect on the placement of Polypodium and minimal effect
on overall topology in our combined ML analyses (Additional file 8). Therefore we performed all other analyses
with the complete datasets, including the more variable
regions.
Parsimony analyses were performed using TNTv.1.1 [45].
Separate tree searches were performed with gaps coded as
missing and gaps coded as a fifth state. However, with one
exception (see results for myxozoan placement with 18S
data) there was no significant difference in topology.
Numerous search methods available in TNT were utilized
to search the tree space but the following approach was
found to consistently recover trees with minimum lengths

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/139

from our datasets. The implemented search was a driven
new technology search with a random seed of 0 (where 0
= time). Default settings for sectorial searches (RSS and
CSS) and tree fusing were used [46], with 5 replicates per
repetition, and a requirement that the global optimum be
found 20 times. TBR branch swapping was performed on
the resulting trees and a strict consensus was calculated.
TNT was used to calculate standard bootstrap values
(1000 replicates). Alignments and trees for 18S, 28S and
combined datasets have been submitted to TreeBASE
http://www.treebase.org/treebase/index.html.
