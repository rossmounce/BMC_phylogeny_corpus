Abstract
Background: Hydrophobins are fungal proteins that can turn into amphipathic membranes at
hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces by self-assembly. The assemblages by Class I hydrophobins are
extremely stable and possess the remarkable ability to change the polarity of the surface. One of
its most important industrial applications is its usage as paint. Without detailed knowledge of the
3D structure and self-assembly principles of hydrophobins, it is difficult to make significant progress
in furthering its research.
Results: In order to provide useful information to hydrophobin researchers, we analyzed primary
structure of hydrophobins to gain more insight about these proteins. In this paper, we presented
an in-depth primary sequence analysis using batch BLAST search of the database, sequence filtering
by programming and motif finding by MEME. We used batch BLAST to find similar sequences in the
NCBI nr database. Then we used MEME to find out motifs. Based on the newly found motifs and
the well-known C-CC-C-C-CC-C pattern we used MAST to search the entire nr database. At the
end, domain search and phylogenetic analysis were conducted to confirm the result. After
searching the nr database with the new PSSM-format motifs identified by MEME, many sequences
from various species were found by MAST. Filtering process by pattern, domain and length left 9
qualified candidates.
Conclusion: All of 9 newly identified potential hydrophobins possess the common pattern and
hydrophobin domain. From the multiple sequence alignment result, we can see that some of them
are grouped very close to other known hydrophobins, which means their phylogenetic relationship
is very close and it is highly plausible that they are indeed hydrophobin proteins.

Background
Hydrophobins play a very important role in fungal
growth and development. They are a class of small fungal

proteins, which are responsible for the formation of aerial
hyphae and attachment of hyphae to hydrophobic surfaces [1]. The remarkable ability of self-assembly at

hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces makes hydrophobins
interesting and unique, not only in biology but also in
industrial applications. There are two main classes of
hydrophobins: class I and class II. These two classes have
been distinguished based on the differences in their
hydropathy patterns and biophysical properties [2]. The
membrane formed by self-assembly of Class I hydrophobins is more stable than the one formed by Class II. It is also
characterized by a rodlet structure, which does not exist in
Class II hydrophobins. More interestingly, this structure is
observed in amyloid proteins, which suggests similarities
in structure and self-assembly mechanism.
SC3, a glycosylated hydrophobin, is the most extensively
studied class I hydrophobin to date [3]. It contains the
only known motif in hydrophobins, the eight-cysteine
residues [4]. The cysteines form four disulfide bridges,
which keep SC3 from self-assembling and account for
controlled assembly at hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces [5]. They also divide the entire molecule into four
loops with N-terminal sequence of nearly 30 amino acids.
On the other end of the sequence, the C-terminal region
only contains 6 amino acids [6].
It is assumed that self-assembly of class I hydrophobins is
accompanied by conformational changes as it is the case
for SC3. The intermediate α-helix state changes into the
stable ultimate β-sheet form at water-air interface. However, study of class I hydrophobin EAS from Neurospora
crassa by NMR found no obvious structure other than a
small core region composed of three antiparallel βstrands, which is probably stabilized by the four disulfide
bridges [7]. This discrepancy in both structure and
sequence is a major hurdle in studying hydrophobins and
their unique self-assembly properties. In this paper, we
use computational tools to extract information from
hydrophobin sequences and identify conserved motifs to
find new members of the hydrophobin family.

Results
Batch BLAST search for all hydrophobin sequences and
identification of new conserved motifs
A total of 183 sequences containing the key word hydrophobin were found including 22 sequences in UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot and 161 sequences in UniProtKB/TrEMBL,
most of which were fragments only. No filtering was performed only because we did not want to lose any potential signals. All 183 sequences, including fragments, were
used to conduct batch BLAST search against nr database
on NCBI server. A perl program was used to perform this
task. By doing so, all potential hydrophobins should have
been found in one or more search results. 6715 sequences
were returned by the batch BLAST. All results were automatically filtered by the presence of the word hydrophobin in their description. After elimination of identical
sequences, judged by GI number, and the sequences that
don't have the eight-cysteine residues pattern (C-CC-C-CCC-C) by the perl program, 128 hydrophobin non-fragment sequences were dug out from the nr database and
put into an Excel file. Also, the program retrieved all relative information on each individual sequence of these 128
hydrophobins to prepare for the conserved motif search.

Highly similar sequences were removed to reduce bias on
conserved motif search. Only 110 sequences were used as
input to MEME to conduct conserved motif search. Considering the high diversity among the hydrophobin
sequences, the maximum motif number was set to 10. The
first 6 motifs were reasonable and therefore used as input
to MAST program. They are in PSSM format; however the
consensus sequences are shown in the Table 1.
Identification of new hydrophobins
Using motifs obtained from MEME, we conducted a
MAST search and analyzed the results with a perl program.
It removed not only all the identical sequences but also
the ones used as input from the search results. The e-value
for qualified sequence is 10.

As we have mentioned before, in order not to miss any signal, we have set the maximum motif number to 10, which

6 motifs are selected to search the NCBI nr database. All of these 6 motifs exist in at least 1 of the returned sequences. This raised the possibility
of retrieving the positive signal as well as the noise. Pattern and domain analysis were conducted to compensate this side effect, which will be
described later.

leads to the increase in the number of false positives. Pattern matching and domain analysis have been conducted
to filter the results from the last step. First, any known
hydrophobin sequences in the returned sequences were
removed (111 sequences removed). Then, all the
obtained sequences have been scanned with the eightcysteine-residue pattern (19 sequences removed). All
sequences containing more or less cysteine residues have
been filtered out. The sequence gi:71020699 hypothetical
protein was also filtered out because its length is far larger
than any other known hydrophobin sequence. At last,
domain analysis with SMART on each individual
sequences was conducted. The existence of hydrophobin
domain has to be positive to keep the sequence in the candidate list (6 sequences removed).
In total, 9 strong candidates as potential hydrophobins
were found among five species, Aspergillus nidulans,
Agrocybe aegerita, Gibberella zeae, Metarhizim anisopliae
and Ustilago maydis. The details are listed in Table 2.
These nine hydrophobins have not been named as hydrophobins and not reported previously, and are found for
the first time in the study.
Pattern and domain analysis
As we described, conserved motifs were used to search for
potential novel hydrophobins, pattern and domain analysis were further used to filter the results. Consequently,
all these 9 new hydrophobin sequences have at least one
of the 6 conserved motifs we first found in this study. In
Figure 1, we aligned the second motif in these 9 sequences
and other known hydrophobin sequences (5 sequences),
and this motif is highly conserved among all the
sequences including new and known hydrophobin
sequences, indicating the motifs we identified in the study
are useful for finding potential new hydrophobins. We
also did a multiple sequence alignment (figure 2) which
clearly shows the hydrophobin pattern in all the newly
identified hydrophobin sequences. In figure 3, we can

clearly see the detail location of the hydrophobin domain
in each newly identified hydrophobin sequence.
Phylogenetic tree
All the potential hydrophobins found in our analysis were
used to build a phylogenetic tree that also included
selected known hydrophobins. The purpose of phylogenetic analysis is to study the evolutionary relationship
between the hydrophobins identified here and the other
known hydrophobins and also to perform a final check
on the reliability of the results obtained. We selected 15
sequences from the input sequence pool along with 9 new
identified sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree. The
results are shown in Figure 4. We can see that most new
identified hydrophobins are grouped together with other
reference sequences, which supports our results.

Discussion
The unique property of hydrophobins to self-assemble at
hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces makes them interesting candidates for use in medical and industrial applications [8]. The high stability of the Class I hydrophobins
have made them ideal candidates for industrial application. For example, hydrophobins could be used as a protection layer of many instruments against damage from
other chemical reagents. It could also be used to change a
hydrophobic surface into a hydrophilic one and vice
versa. In addition, the size and properties of rodlets
formed by class I hydrophobins make them useful for
application in nanotechnology. Another very important
application is the use of hydrophobins as an intermediate
to attach cells or molecules to surfaces with different properties. Each hydrophobin is slightly different from the others, which makes it possible to find a suitable
hydrophobin for a specific application. This underlines
the need to identify new hydrophobins.
The best way of making use of hydrophobins is structure
determination. In order to facilitate research in hydrophobin structure, a database is currently under develop-

ment. This database will store not only all common
protein properties but also properties specific to hydrophobins, such as self-assembled layer stability. Users can
make various queries against the database, such as all the
hydrophobin sequences in a specific species. With more
and more hydrophobins discovered, more information
will be answered by sequence analysis.

Conclusion
All of 9 newly identified potential hydrophobins possess
the common pattern and hydrophobin domain. The
result of the multiple sequences alignment has shown that
some of the newly identified potential hydrophobin
sequences are closely grouped to other known ones,
which strongly supported the result of this research. The
phylogenetic relationships between them are very close.
Besides, we have also identified a pattern which exists in
almost all hydrophobin sequences. It could become a very
accurate criterion in new hydrophobin identification and
it could also facilitate the research on the unique property
of hydrophobin family.

Methods
The entire workflow is given as following (Figure 5). It
gives an overview of the methods used in this paper.
Prepare sequences
Key word hydrophobin was used to search the UniProt
Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL http://

www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/sprot-search-ful) to find existing
hydrophobin protein sequences. Both whole length
sequences and fragments are included to insure the maximum coverage of hydrophobin sequence information.
Batch BLAST
A perl program was used to conduct batch BLAST against
NCBI database http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/. In order to
keep noise at the lowest level, all qualified hydrophobin
sequences contained the eight-cysteine residue pattern (CCC-C-C-CC-C) along with word hydrophobin in their
sequence description. The perl program also conducted
filtering based on the criteria.
Multiple Sequence alignment and highly identical
sequences elimination
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/ available at
the European Bioinformatics Institute web site [9]. Based
on the result, highly identical sequences were removed to
reduce the bias on the conserved motif search.
Conserved motif search
MEME http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/intro.html[10] and
PRATT http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pratt/[11] were used to dig
out conserved motif information. The output of the program is completed studied and then used as input to the
next step of the pipeline.

Database search for new hydrophobins
MAST http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/mast.html[12], bundled with MEME, was used to search for new hydrophobin sequences against nr database (non-redundant
protein database). Huge amount of sequences are
retrieved. A perl program is written to eliminate replications based on genbank ID.

Domain analysis of identified hydrophobins
SMART http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/[13] domain
analysis tool was used not only to predict the domain
architecture of identified sequences but also to filter the
results. A domain alignment between the newly identified
potential hydrophobins and the known hydrophobins is
conducted based on the result of this research.
