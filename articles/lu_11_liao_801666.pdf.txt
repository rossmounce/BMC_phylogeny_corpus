Abstract
Background: Liao ning virus is in the genus Seadornavirus within the family Reoviridae and has a genome
composed of 12 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). It is transmitted by mosquitoes and only isolated in
China to date and it is the only species within the genus Seadornavirus which was reported to have been
propagated in mammalian cell lines. In the study, we report 41 new isolates from northern and southern Xinjiang
Uygur autonomous region in China and describe the phylogenetic relationships among all 46 Chinese LNV isolates.
Findings: The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the isolates evaluated in this study can be divided into 3
different groups that appear to be related to geographic origin based on partial nucleotide sequence of the 10th
segment which is predicted to encode outer coat proteins of LNV. Bayesian coalescent analysis estimated the date
of the most recent common ancestor for the current Chinese LNV isolates to be 318 (with a 95% confidence
interval of 30-719) and the estimated evolutionary rates is 1.993 × 10-3 substitutions per site per year.
Conclusions: The results indicated that LNV may be an emerging virus at a stage that evaluated rapidly and has
been widely distributed in the north part of China.

Findings
Liao ning virus (LNV) which is the member within the
genus Seadornavirus family Reoviridae was composed of
12 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The Seadornaviruses
include three species, Banna virus (BAV), Kadipiro virus
(KDV) and LNV [1]. BAV was initially isolated from
patients with encephalitis and appears to be pathogenic to
humans [2]. Though there have been no confirmed reports
of human disease due to LNV, this virus replicates in
mammalian cells and causes viraemia and haemorrhage in
mice [1], suggesting LNV may be pathogenic to humans
or animals [1]. Recently, LNV isolates from mosquitoes
have been obtained from several regions in north China
[3-5]. Here, we report additional isolates from northern
and southern Xinjiang province and describe the phylogenetic relationships among Chinese LNV isolates.
A total of 41 new LNV isolates were obtained from mosquitoes during 2006 to 2008 at sites in Xinjiang province
(Figure 1). Mosquito samples were collected from July
to September during 2006 to 2008 from several sites in

Xinjiang province (Latitude39°to 47°N, Longitude 75° to
86°E). Mosquitoes were collected in the evening hours
using UV-light traps placed in livestock sheds near human
houses. Mosquitoes were sorted into pools of 50 to 100
specimens according to species. Viruses were isolated and
41 new LNV isolates were identified using previously
described procedures [5]. Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Cat
No. 10296-028) was used to extract total RNA. cDNA was
prepared using Ready-to-Go™ You prime First-Strand
Beads Kit (Amersham Biosciences Co.) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. A 576 bp gene fragment from
the 10th segment was amplified from the cDNA using previously published primers [1,5]. This segment was predicted to encode the LNV’s outer protein which is
expected to vary noticeably from one strain to another [1].
PCR products were recovered with purification kits
(Qiagen) and then were sequenced directly.
The MrModeltest version 2.3 http://www.softpedia.
com/get/Science-CAD/MrModeltest.shtml software program was used to examine 24 models of nucleotide substitution to determine the model most appropriate for
Bayesian coalescent analysis of the LNV dataset. The
general time reversible evolutionary model incorporating
a gamma distribution (GTR + G) was found according to
the Akaike information criterion. Both strict and relaxed

(uncorrelated exponential and lognormal) molecular
clocks [6] were employed to explore and the relaxeduncorrelated lognormal molecular clock was the best
supported model, according to the estimated Bayes factor
using the TRACER program. Preliminary analyses
revealed that the population dynamics of LNVs supported a model of Bayesian skyline models [7]. The dataset was examined with Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods implemented in the BEAST
package using a chain length of 100,000,000 generations
with 10% removed as burn- in. All runs were checked for
convergence by using the TRACER program http://tree.
bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/. The rate of nucleotide substitutions per site per year and the date of the time of
most common ancestor (TMRCA) for these viruses were
estimated. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was
constructed and converted to a graphics format using
Figtree software version 1.2.2 http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/
software/figtree/.
By a Bayesian MCMC approach, the mean rate of
nucleotide substitution for the10th segment of Chinese
LNVs was 1.993 × 10-3 per site per year (95%HPD,3.664 ×
10-4 to 4.667 × 10-3 substitutions per site per year). Based
on this nucleotide substitution value, the TMRCA of
Chinese LNVs is estimated to be 318 (95%HPD, 30-719)
(Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 46 LNV isolates (Table 1). Of these, 41 were obtained in this study:
31 from Culex spp. in Kashi, southern Xinjiang in 2006;
7 from Culex spp. and Aedes dorsalis in Bayinguoleng,

southern Xinjang in 2007; 3 from Aedes dorsalis in Aletai, northern Xinjiang in 2008(Figure 1). The other LNV
isolates evaluated include: NE9712 and NE9731 isolated
from Aedes dorsalis in Liaoning province in 1997 [1];
QH07130 isolated from Culex modestus in Qinghai province in 2007 [4]; SX0771 and SX0794 isolated from
Culex pipiens and Aedes dorsalis in Shanxi province in
2007 [5] (Figure 1). The MCC tree shows that the LNV
isolates evaluated in this study can be divided into 3 different groups that appear to be related to geographic
location (Figure 2). The Xinjiang isolates are all clustered in Group A, regardless of the mosquito species
from which they were isolated. Qinghai, Shanxi and one
of the Liaoning isolates NE9712 are included in group B
and another Liaoning isolate LNVNE9731 also from the
initial isolation site of LNV was evolved independently
(Figure 2). The divergence time of each lineage of the
46 LNV isolates were also estimated by Bayesian analysis. Results showed that group A (NE9731) was the oldest lineage based on the analysis of current LNVs. As
well as the diverged time of Group B and Group C was
37.7 and 18.47, respectively. Data showed that the
nucleotide and amino acid homology between the 41
LNV isolates are between 77.1-100% and 68.3-100%,
respectively, with NE 9731 from Liaoning province the
most divergent one.
Arbovirus undergoes substantially slower rates of evolution [8]. For example, the evolution rates of Dengue
virus and bluetongue virus are about 10 -4 [9,10]. Our
results showed that the evolution rate of LNV was 1.993
× 10-3 which is faster than other arbovirus. In addition,
the TMRAC of LNV was estimated to be 381 years,
indicating LNV is an emerging virus and at a stage that
evaluated rapidly to accommodate the host and the
environment now. Also, the nucleotide and amino acid
homology rate showed high identity within each group
and much divergent between the groups. The geographical characteristic implies that LNV could raise natural
circle in the locality though the diverged time of each
group was quite recent.
In recent years, arbovirus surveillances have been done
in many provinces. Japanese encephalitis virus, Tahyna
virus, Getah virus and other arboviruses were isolated
nationwide [11-13]. But all of the LNV isolates have been
obtained only in region extending from Latitude 36°N to
47°N in the northwest to northeast part of the country.
So for what reason, the virus has only been isolated from
such a narrow geographic is too be studied.
LNV seemed to be at a stage of evolving rapidly than
most of the arbovirus. Also it is much divergent between
each subtype. Can such virus genetic differences have
pathogenicity differences? LNV is pathogenic to mice,
and seasonal encephalitis in the absence of Japanese
