Abstract
Background: Phenylobacterium zucineum is a recently identified facultative intracellular species
isolated from the human leukemia cell line K562. Unlike the known intracellular pathogens, P.
zucineum maintains a stable association with its host cell without affecting the growth and
morphology of the latter.
Results: Here, we report the whole genome sequence of the type strain HLK1T. The genome
consists of a circular chromosome (3,996,255 bp) and a circular plasmid (382,976 bp). It encodes
3,861 putative proteins, 42 tRNAs, and a 16S-23S-5S rRNA operon. Comparative genomic analysis
revealed that it is phylogenetically closest to Caulobacter crescentus, a model species for cell cycle
research. Notably, P. zucineum has a gene that is strikingly similar, both structurally and functionally,
to the cell cycle master regulator CtrA of C. crescentus, and most of the genes directly regulated by
CtrA in the latter have orthologs in the former.
Conclusion: This work presents the first complete bacterial genome in the genus
Phenylobacterium. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that the CtrA regulon is well conserved
between C. crescentus and P. zucineum.

Background
Phenylobacterium zucineum strain HLK1T is a facultative
intracellular microbe recently identified by us [1]. It is a
rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium 0.3–0.5 × 0.5–2 μm
in size. It belongs to the genus Phenylobacterium [2], which
presently comprises 5 species, P. lituiforme (FaiI3T) [3], P.

falsum (AC49T) [4], P. immobile (ET) [2], P. koreense (Slu01T) [5], and P. zucineum (HLK1T) [1]. They were isolated
from subsurface aquifer, alkaline groundwater, soil, activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, and the
human leukemia cell line K562, respectively. Except for P.
zucineum, they are environmental bacteria, and there is no

evidence that these microbes are associated with eukaryotic cells. The HLK1T strain, therefore, represents the only
species so far in the genus Phenylobacterium that can infect
and survive in human cells. Since most, if not all, of the
known microbes that can invade human cells are pathogenic, we proposed that HLK1T may have pathogenic relevance to humans [1]. Unlike the known intracellular
pathogens that undergo a cycle involving invasion, overgrowth, and disruption of the host cells, and repeating the
cycle by invading new cells, HLK1T is able to establish a
stable parasitic association with its host, i.e., the strain
does not overgrow intracellularly to kill the host, and the
host cells carry them to their progeny. One cell line
(SW480) infected with P. zucineum has been stably maintained for nearly three years in our lab (data not shown).

plasmid are 71.35% and 68.5%, respectively. There are
3,861 putative protein-coding genes (3,534 in the chromosome and 327 in the plasmid), of which 3,180 have
significant matches in the non-redundant protein database. Of the matches, 585 are conserved hypothetical proteins and 2,595 are proteins with known or predicted
functions. Forty-two tRNA genes and one 16S-23S-5S
rRNA operon were identified in the chromosome.

In this report, we present the complete genome sequence
of P. zucineum.

On the basis of COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups)
classification, the chromosome is enriched in genes for
basic metabolism, such as categories E (amino acid transport and metabolism) and I (lipid transport and metabolism), accounting for 8.29% and 6.09% of the total genes
in the chromosome, respectively. On the other hand, the
plasmid is enriched for genes in categories O (posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones) and T

Results
Genome anatomy
The genome is composed of a circular chromosome
(3,996,255 bp) and a circular plasmid (382,976 bp) (Figure 1; Table 1). The G + C contents of chromosome and

There are 7 families of protein-coding repetitive sequences
and a family of noncoding repeats in the genome (Table
2). Notably, identical copies of repeats 02–04 were found
in both the chromosome and the plasmid, suggesting
their potential involvement in homologous recombination.

(signal transduction mechanisms), constituting 12.96%
and 9.72% of the total genes in the plasmid, respectively.
As to genes in the plasmid that cope with environmental
stimuli, about half of the genes in category O are molecular chaperones (17/32), including 2 dnaJ-like molecular
chaperones, 2 clusters of dnaK and its co-chaperonin grpE
(PHZ_p0053-0054 and PHZ_p0121-122), a cluster of
groEL and its co-chaperonin groES (PHZ_p0095-0096),
and 9 heat shock proteins Hsp20. Of 23 genes in category
T, there is one cluster (FixLJ, PHZ_p0187-0188), which is
essential for the growth of C. crescentus under hypoxic
conditions [6].
General metabolism
The enzyme sets of glycolysis and the Entner-Doudoroff
pathway are complete in the genome. All genes comprising the pentose phosphate pathway except gluconate
kinase were identified, consistent with our previous experimental result that the strain cannot utilize gluconate [1].
The genome lacks two enzymes (kdh, alpha ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase and kgd, alpha ketoglutarate decarboxylase), making the oxidative and reductive branches of the
tricarboxylic acid cycle operate separately. The genome
has all the genes for the synthesis of fatty acids, 20 amino
acids, and corresponding tRNAs. Although full sets of
genes for the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine were
identified, enzymes for the salvage pathways of purine
(apt, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; ade, adenine
deaminase) and pyrimidine (cdd, cytidine deaminase;
codA, cytosine deaminase; tdk, thymidine kinase; deoA,
thymidine phosphorylase; upp, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase; udk, uridine kinase; and udp, uridine phosphorylase) were absent. The plasmid encodes some
metabolic enzymes, such as those participating in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the citric acid

cycle. However, it is worth noting that the plasmid has a
gene (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) that is the
only copy in the genome (PHZ_p0183).
Like most other species in the genus Phenylobacterium, the
strain is able to use L-phenylalanine as a sole carbon
source under aerobic conditions [1]. A recent study
revealed that phenylalanine can be completely degraded
through the homogentisate pathway in Pseudomonas putida U [7]. P. zucineum may use the same strategy to utilize
phenylalanine, because all the enzymes for the conversion
of phenylalanine through intermediate homogentisate to
the final products fumarate and acetoacetate are present in
the chromosome (Table 3).
Functional elements responding to environmental
transition
HLK1T is able to survive intracellularly and extracellularly.
Consistently, the genome contains the fundamental elements to support the life cycle in different environments.
The genome contains abundant two-component signal
transduction proteins, transcriptional regulators, and heat
shock response proteins, enabling the strain to respond to
extra- and intra-cellular stimuli at transcriptional and
post-translational levels. Among the total of 102 twocomponent signal transduction proteins (91 in the chromosome and 11 in the plasmid), there are 36 histidine
kinases, 48 response regulators, and 18 hybrid proteins
fused with histidine kinase and response regulator. Sixteen pairs of histidine kinase and response regulator (1 in
the plasmid) are adjacently aligned and may act as functional operons. These tightly linked modules make twocomponent signal transduction systems respond to environmental changes efficiently. The genome encodes 170
transcriptional regulators (16 in the plasmid) (Table 4).
Notably, we annotated the proteins of 93 bacteria (see

methods – comparative genomics) with the same annotation criteria used for P. zucineum and found that the fraction of two-component signal transduction proteins and
transcriptional regulators was positively correlated with
the capacity for environmental adaptation (Figure 2). The
genome contains 17 extracytoplasmic function (ECF)
sigma factors (3 in the plasmid) (Table 5). ECFs are suggested to play a role in environmental adaptation for Pseudomonas putida KT2440, whose genome contains 19 ECFs
[8]. P. zucineum has 3 heat shock sigma factors rpoH (2 in
the plasmid) and 33 heat shock molecular chaperons (17
in the plasmid) (Table 6), which can cope with a variety
of stresses, including cellular energy depletion, extreme
concentrations of heavy metals, and various toxic substances. [9].

genes related to chemotaxis (Table 7), and 43 genes for
the biogenesis of the flagellum (Table 8).
The genome contains sec-dependent, sec-independent,
typical type II (Table 9) and IV secretion systems (Table
10), which are known to play important roles in adapting
to diverse conditions [10,11].
To better understand the roles of proteins responsible for
environmental transition, we computed the distributions
of those proteins in 5 representative alphaproteobacteria
with typical habitats (see methods – comparative genomics). Like other multiple bacteria and facultative bacteria,
which can survive in multiple niches, P. zucineum encodes
a higher fraction of ECFs, transcriptional regulators and
two-component signal transduction proteins than obligate bacteria (Table 9). Notably, P. zucineum has the largest number of heat shock related proteins (Table 6), in
comparison to the 5 representative alphaproteobacteria

Adaptation to an intracellular life cycle
To survive intracellularly, P. zucineum must succeed in
adhering to and subsequently invading the host cell [12],

The genes involved in defense against oxidative stress
include superoxide dismutase (PHZ_c0927, PHZ_c1092),
catalase (PHZ_c2899), peroxiredoxin (PHZ_c1548),
hydroperoxide reductase (ahpF, alkyl hydroperoxide

It is well known that the pilus takes part in adhering to
and invading a host cell [12]. We identified one pili biosynthesis gene (pilA) and 2 operons for pili biosynthesis
(Table 11).

the species share only 57.8% (2,231/3,861) of orthologous proteins. Categories J (translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis), F (nucleotide transport and
metabolism), and L (replication, recombination and
repair) are the top 3 conservative COG categories between
the species, sharing 88.01%, 81.67%, and 80.65% of the

and

[PHZ_c0446, PHZ_c0523]).
Since intracellular free Fe is not sufficient to support the
life of bacteria, to survive intracellularly, they must use
protein-bound iron, such as heme and transferrin, via
transporters and/or the siderophore system. The P. zucineum genome has one ABC type siderophore transporter
system (PHZ_c1893-1895), one ABC type heme transporter system (PHZ_c0136, PHZ_c0139, PHZ_c0140),
and 60 TonB-dependent receptors which may uptake the
iron-siderophore complex (Table 12).
Comparative genomics between P. zucineum and C.
crescentus
Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that P. zucineum is phylogenetically the closest to C. crescentus [18]
(Figure 4), consistent with the phylogenetic analysis
based on 16S RNA gene sequences (Figure 5).

Though the genome size and protein number of P. zucineum (4.37 Mb, 3,861 proteins) are similar to those of C.
crescentus (4.01 Mb, 3,767 proteins), no large-scale synteny was found between the genomes. The largest synteny
region is only about 30 kb that encodes 24 proteins. The
conservation region with the largest number of proteins is
the operon encoding 27 ribosomal proteins. In addition,

Comparison of cell cycle genes between P. zucineum and
C. crescentus
Since P. zucineum is phylogenetically closest to C. crescentus, and since the latter is a model organism for studies of
the prokaryotic cell cycle [19,20], we compared the genes
regulating the cell cycle between these species.

The cell cycle of C. crescentus is controlled to a large extent
by the master regulator CtrA, which controls the transcription of 95 genes involved in the cycle [19,20]. On the
other hand, ctrA is regulated at the levels of transcription,
phosphorylation, and proteolytic degradation by its target
genes, e.g., DNA methyltransferase (CcrM) regulates the
transcription of ctrA, histidine kinases (CckA, PleC, DivJ,
DivL) regulate its activity, and ClpXP degrades it. These
regulatory 'loops' enable CtrA to precisely control the progression of the cell cycle.
P. zucineum has most of the orthologs mentioned above
(Table 13). Among the 95 CtrA-regulated genes in C. crescentus, 75 have orthologs in the P. zucineum genome
(Additional file 1). The fraction of CtrA-regulated genes
with orthologs in P. zucineum (76.9%, 73/95) is significantly greater than the mean level of the whole genome
(57.8%, 2,231/3,861), indicating that the CtrA regulatory
system is highly conserved. Genes participating in regulating central events of the cell cycle, such as CcrM
(CC0378), Clp protease (CC1963) and 14 regulatory proteins, except for one response regulator (CC3286), are
present in the P. zucineum genome. The genes without
counterparts in P. zucineum are mostly for functionally
unknown proteins.
Notably, the sequence of CtrA is strikingly similar
between P. zucineum and C. crescentus, with 93.07% identity of amino acid sequence and 89.88% identity of nucleotide sequence. In addition, they share identical
promoters (p1 and p2) [21] and the motif (GAnTC) recognized by DNA methyltransferase (CcrM) (Figure 6)
[22], suggesting that they probably share a similar regulatory loop of CtrA.
Consistent with the results from in silico sequence analysis, the CtrA of P. zucineum can restore the growth of temperature-sensitive strain LC2195 (a CtrA mutant) of C.
crescentus [23] at 37°C, indicating that the CtrA of P. zuci-

neum can functionally compliment that of C. crescentus in
our experimental conditions (data not shown).
Taken together, the comparative genomics of P. zucineum
and C. crescentus suggests that the cell cycle of the former
is likely to be regulated similarly to that of the latter.
Presence of ESTs of the strain in human
Since P. zucineum strain HLK1T can invade and persistently
live in several human cell lines [1], we were curious about
whether this microbe can infect humans. By blasting
against the human EST database (dbEST release 041307

sequence of P. zucineum, we found 9 matched ESTs (Table
14), of which 3 were from a library constructed from tissue adjacent to a breast cancer, and 6 were from a library
constructed from a cell line of lymphatic origin. The preliminary data suggest that P. zucineum may invade
humans.

This work presents the first complete bacterial genome in
the genus Phenylobacterium. Genome analysis reveals the
fundamental basis for this strain to invade and persistently survive in human cells. P. zucineum is phylogeneti-

to our recent publication [1], P. zucineum was classified as "facultative". 3Given that G. oxydans is often isolated from sugary niches (such
as flowers and fruits) and associated soil (such as garden soil and baker's soil) [43], we classified G. oxydans as "multiple".

subsequent gene identification was carried out as
described in our earlier publications [28-30]. Briefly, during the shotgun sequence phase, clones were picked randomly from three shotgun libraries and then sequenced
from both ends. 44,667 successful sequence reads (>100
bp at Phred value Q13), accounting for 5.47× sequence
coverage of the genome, were assembled into 563
sequence contigs representing 60 scaffolds connected by
end-pairing information.

The finishing phase involved iterative cycles of laboratory
work and computational analysis. To reduce the numbers
of scaffolds, reads were added into initial contig assembly
by using failed universal primers as primers and by using
plasmid clones that extended outwards from the scaffolds
as sequence reaction templates. To resolve the low-quality
regions, resequencing of the involved reads in low quality
regions with universal primers and primer walking the
plasmid clones were the first choice, otherwise, rese-

quencing with alternate temperature conditions resolved
the remaining low-quality regions. New sequence reads
obtained from the above laboratory work were assembled
into existing contigs, which yielded new contigs and new
scaffolds connected by end-pairing information. Then,
consed interface helped us to do nest round of laboratory
work based on new arisen contig assembly. After about
four iterative cycles of the above "finish" procedures to
close gaps and to resolve the low-quality regions, the PCR
product obtained by using total genomic DNA as template was sequenced from both ends to close the last physical gap. In addition, the overall sequence quality of the
genome was further improved by using the following criteria: (1) two independent high-quality reads as minimal
coverage, and (2) Phred quality value = Q40 for each
given base. Collectively, 3,542 successful reads were incorporated into initial assembles during the finishing phase.
The final assembly was composed of two circular "contigs", of which a smaller one with a protein cluster
(including repA, repB, parA and parB) related to plasmid
replication was assigned as the plasmid, and the larger
one was the chromosome.

List of top 10 complete sequenced bacteria closest to
P. zucineum. All 10 are alphaproteobacteria. Among all the
sequenced bacterial genomes, C. crescentus shares the greatest number of similar ORFs with P. zucineum

with intensive manual alignment. We identified and
annotated the protein profiles of chromosome and plasmid with the same workstream. For the chromosome, the
first set of potential CDSs in the chromosome was established with Glimmer 2.0 trained with a set of ORFs longer
than 500 bp from its genomic sequence at default settings
[34]. The resulting 5,029 predicted CDSs were BLAST
searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein database to determine their homology [35]. 1,174 annotated
proteins without the word "hypothetical" or "unknown"
in their function description, and without frameshifts or
in-frame stop codons, were selected as the second training
set. The resulting second set of 4,018 predicted CDSs
(assigned as "predicted CDSs") were searched against the
NCBI non-redundant protein database. Predicted CDSs
that accorded with the following BLAST search criteria
were considered "true proteins": (1) 80% of the query
sequence was aligned and (2) E-value ≤ 1e-10. Then, the
ORFs extracted from the chromosome region among "true
proteins" were searched against the NCBI non-redundant
protein database. The ORFs satisfying the same criteria as
true proteins were considered "true ORFs". Overlapping
proteins were manually inspected and resolved, according
to the principle we described previously [30]. The final
version of the protein profile comprised three parts: true
proteins, true ORFs, and predicted CDSs located in the
rest of the genome. The translational start codon of each
protein was identified by the widely used RBS script [36]
and then refined by comparison with homologous proteins [30].
To further investigate the function of each protein, we
used InterProScan to search against the InterPro protein
family database [37]. The up-to-date KEGG pathway database was used for pathway analysis [38]. All proteins were
searched against the COG database which included 66
completed genomes [39,40]. The final annotation was
manually inspected by comprehensively integrating the
results from searching against the databases of nr, COG,
KEGG, and InterPro.

MEGA [41]. The gammaproteobacterium E. coli was used
as the outgroup to root the tree. To illustrate the evolutionary history of heat shock related proteins (RpoH,
DnaK and GrpE), neighbor-joining trees based on the 16S
rRNA genes and the above three proteins of 5 representative alphaproteobacteria (Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, Brucella suis 1330, C. crescentus CB15, Rickettsia conorii str.
Malish 7, Gluconobacter oxydans 621H), P. zucineum and E.
coli O157:H7 EDL933 were constructed.
Comparative genomics
Sequence data for comparative analyses were obtained
from the NCBI database ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gen
bank/genomes/Bacteria/. The database has 520 completely sequenced bacterial genomes (sequences downloaded on 2007/06/05). All P. zucineum ORFs were
searched against the ORFs from all other bacterial
genomes with BLASTP. The number of P. zucineum ORFs
matched to each genome with significance (E value = 1e10) was calculated.

To illustrate the contribution of transcriptional regulators
and two-component signal transduction proteins to environmental adaptation, we compared the mean fraction of
these two types of proteins in bacteria living in 6 different
habitats, as described by Merav Parter [42]. These are: (1)
obligate bacteria that are necessarily associated with a
host, (2) specialized bacteria that live in specific environments, such as marine thermal vents, (3) aquatic bacteria
that live in fresh or seawater, (4) facultative bacteria, freeliving bacteria that are often associated with a host, (5)
multiple bacteria that live in many different environments, and (6) terrestrial bacteria that live in the soil. For
bacteria with more than one sequenced strain, we chose
only one strain for the comparative study. The numbers of
bacterial species in each group were: 26 obligate, 5 specialized, 4 aquatic, 28 facultative, 27 multiple, and 3 terrestrial. We annotated the proteins of these 93 species
with the same workflow used for P. zucineum and calculated the mean fraction of transcriptional regulators and
two-component signal transduction proteins.
In addition, we annotated the ORFs of 5 representative
alphaproteobacteria with different habitats (multiple bacteria S. meliloti 1021 and G. oxydans 621H, facultative bacterium B. suis 1330, aquatic bacterium C. crescentus CB15,
and obligate bacterium R. conorii str. Malish 7) using the
same workflow and computed the distributions of proteins involved in environmental adaptation.

starting with initial codon "ATG.".

Ortholog identification
All proteins encoded by one genome were BLASTP
searched against a database of proteins encoded by
another genome [35], and vice versa. The threshold used in
these comparisons was 1e-10. Orthology was identified if
two proteins were each other's best BLASTP hit (best reciprocal match).
Data accessibility
The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited
in the GenBank database. The accession numbers for
chromosome and plasmid are CP000747 and CP000748,
respectively.
