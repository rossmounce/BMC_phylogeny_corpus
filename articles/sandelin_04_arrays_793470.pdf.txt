Abstract
Background: Evolutionarily conserved sequences within or adjoining orthologous genes often
serve as critical cis-regulatory regions. Recent studies have identified long, non-coding genomic
regions that are perfectly conserved between human and mouse, termed ultra-conserved regions
(UCRs). Here, we focus on UCRs that cluster around genes involved in early vertebrate
development; genes conserved over 450 million years of vertebrate evolution.
Results: Based on a high resolution detection procedure, our UCR set enables novel insights into
vertebrate genome organization and regulation of developmentally important genes. We find that
the genomic positions of deeply conserved UCRs are strongly associated with the locations of
genes encoding key regulators of development, with particularly strong positional correlation to
transcription factor-encoding genes. Of particular importance is the observation that most UCRs
are clustered into arrays that span hundreds of kilobases around their presumptive target genes.
Such a hallmark signature is present around several uncharacterized human genes predicted to
encode developmentally important DNA-binding proteins.
Conclusion: The genomic organization of UCRs, combined with previous findings, suggests that
UCRs act as essential long-range modulators of gene expression. The exceptional sequence
conservation and clustered structure suggests that UCR-mediated molecular events involve
greater complexity than traditional DNA binding by transcription factors. The high-resolution UCR
collection presented here provides a wealth of target sequences for future experimental studies to
determine the nature of the biochemical mechanisms involved in the preservation of arrays of
nearly identical non-coding sequences over the course of vertebrate evolution.

Background
Comparative genome sequence analysis, often termed
phylogenetic footprinting, has proven successful for the

identification of cis-regulatory regions[1,2]. Recent computational and experimental studies have identified a
small number of large, highly conserved enhancers, or

'global control regions', associated with the regulation of
important developmental genes such as DACH [3], SOX9
[4], Dlx bigene [5,6], and HOX-D [7,8] clusters. These regulatory regions can act at distances of several hundred
kilobases from their target genes, while at the same time
conferring an equivalent expression pattern to reporter
genes over much shorter distances (e.g. [3]). A recent computational analysis proves that such highly conserved elements (termed ultra-conserved elements (UCRs)) are
occurring far more often than expected [9]. In the study by
Bejerano et al., UCRs are defined as regions perfectly conserved between human and mouse longer than 200 base
pairs (bp). The study reports a significant association of a
non-transcribed subset of those elements with DNA-binding proteins; an equivalent observation has been made
independently by Boffeli et al.[10] for a limited number of
most highly conserved elements between human and
pufferfish. The stringent criteria for conservation applied
in the two studies miss many known enhancer elements
that are shorter than 200 bp, and highly conserved across
all vertebrates. For instance, in a recently published study,
Sabarinadh et al. [11] described a number of non-transcribed regions flanking the genes of HoxD gene cluster
that are highly conserved across vertebrate genomes.
In this paper, we define a set of UCRs using high-resolution criteria that detect segments conserved between the
human, mouse and pufferfish genomes. Analysis of this
set provides insights into a previously unrealized organizational structure of UCRs in vertebrate genomes. We conclusively show that clusters of UCRs are globally
associated with many of the genes that act as master regulators during vertebrate development. The clustered distribution of these regions along chromosomes and,
importantly, around their presumptive target genes suggests that gene regulation involves the coordinated action
of numerous, widely dispersed elements.

Results
Definition and genomic environment of ultra-conserved
non-coding regions (UCRs)
We initiated this study by applying comparative genomics
to identify putative regulatory regions for a number of
evolutionary conserved homeodomain transcription factors that control neural cell fate determination [12,13].
When we examined the genomic landscapes surrounding
homeodomain gene loci, we consistently found non-coding regions that exhibited a striking degree of sequence
conservation between human and mouse over a minimum of 50 bp. Many of these regions are at least partially
conserved over extended periods of evolution. The
observed nucleotide identities between human and
mouse sequences exceed even those of exon sequences
encoding identical proteins. Such striking sequence conservation has previously been anecdotally associated with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/99

long-range enhancers for several developmental genes [38].
To test whether the association of UCRs with regulatory
genes reflected a global genomic trend, we identified a
comprehensive set of human/mouse/pufferfish UCRs for
detailed analysis. We defined minimum requirements for
a UCR (see Methods) and performed a genome-scale computational analysis that retrieved 3583 human/mouse/
pufferfish UCRs. Since one of the requirements is that the
UCRs are not overlapping actively transcribed genomic
regions, they would belong to type II UCRs defined by
Bejerano et al. [9].
The median UCR length was 125 bp, but extreme lengths
(>1000 bp) were observed. Qualitative assessment of
"genescapes", the gene structures, surrounding UCRs
revealed them to be present either in introns, in dense
clusters around a group of genes or in 'gene deserts' (up to
several thousands kilobases from known genes). There
appeared to be a strong association between locations of
our set of UCRs and genes encoding transcription factors
– even stronger than that reported by Bejerano et al.[9]
[see Additional file 1 and 2]. This observation will be
proven in the subsequent analysis.
UCRs are strongly associated with DNA-binding proteins
To quantitatively assess the characteristics of genes proximal to UCRs, we analyzed the over-representation of gene
annotations. We retrieved the InterPro [14] domain annotation for all genes adjacent to or containing UCRs. A statistical assessment (Fisher's exact test) of the observed
domain biases for these genes was performed to assess the
probability that the domain distributions were the same
for the UCR genes as compared to the set of all genes. Even
with a conservative (Bonferroni) correction for multiple
testing [15], structural domains of transcription factors are
significantly over-represented (P-value 9.33e-66) within
the gene annotations (Table 1) [all domains are listed in
Additional file 3 and 4]. In order to obtain robust results,
we chose the four domains from Table 1 present in the
highest number of proteins (homeobox, C2H2 zinc finger, forkhead and nuclear steroid receptor). We examined
the extent to which all known genes containing each of
these four transcription factor domains co-localize with
UCRs (Figure 1). We found that a high proportion of these
genes (163/1084; P-value 7.33e-11) are in genomic neighborhoods (<8 kb) of UCRs: more than 30% of all homeodomain-encoding genes have an UCR within 8 kbp (90/
237; p-value 8.67e-11), and more than 55% have one
within 100 kb (133/237, P-value 7.78e-11). The UCR
association rates (the fraction of genes with an UCR closer
than 8 kb, compared to the expected value) for genes
encoding forkhead (8/31, P-value 6.6e-11), nuclear steroid receptor (9/38, P-value 2.81e-9) or zinc finger

domains (56/751 P-value 8.12e-11) were noted as significant as well. These data provide strong evidence that the
UCRs are spatially associated with genes encoding regulatory proteins.
UCRs clusters encompass the entire gene loci of key
developmental genes
In order to visualize the distribution of UCR locations
across the human genome, we generated a UCR density
map for each chromosome [see Additional file 5]. Figure
2a shows such a map for chromosome 2. Visual inspection reveals an obvious qualitative tendency of UCRs to
occur in large clusters, which was validated by a quantitative comparison of the distributions of nearest-neighbor
distances between UCRs and a neutral background model
(P-value 8.02e-16; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). There is no
observed correlation between regions of high gene density
and UCRs, consistent with previously reported observations that larger conserved regions can be located in gene
deserts [3]. As previously noted, many of the UCRs are
adjacent to homeobox protein-encoding genes (Figure 1a,
Figure 2b). It is interesting to note that the over-representation of UCRs near homeobox genes extends up to 300
kbp away from the transcription start site (Figure 1b). This
is consistent with numerous observations that control
regions need not be proximal to targeted genes, but can be
located hundreds of kilobases from the transcription start
site [3,7,16]. A similar trend is observed for UCRs near
C2H2 zinc finger genes, with over-representation of UCRs
extending up to 150 kbp away (Figure 1c). Large clusters

of UCRs can span regions of several hundred kilobases
around inferred target genes. For the 50 largest UCR clusters we generated comprehensive views of the chromosomal neighborhood (Figure 3). We find that 41 of the 50
clusters span one or more genes known to be expressed in
embryonal development, including fundamental master
regulator genes (i.e. the HoxD cluster, Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2 and
Pbx3) [for detailed annotated lists of genes associated
with UCR clusters, see Additional files 6 and 7]. To provide access to the entire set of UCRs, we have implemented a basic UCR browser http://mordor.cgb.ki.se/
UCRbrowse/ with links to the UCSC genome browser
[17].
Rare duplications of UCRs across evolution
We performed a global pairwise comparison of all UCRs,
in order to determine if UCR duplication was common
across evolution. We discovered only five sets of duplicated UCRs, all of which are adjacent to corresponding
duplicated genes. For example, duplicated UCRs are
present in the introns of SOX5 (on chromosome 12) and
SOX6 (on chromosome 11), two highly similar genes
involved in chondrocyte differentiation [18]. Of special
interest is the conservation of UCRs in the Iroquois (IRX)
gene clusters. IRX genes are situated in two clusters of
three genes each, present on human chromosomes 5 and
16 [19]. Similarly positioned arrays of UCRs are present in
each of the four intergenic regions between the IRX genes
(Figure 4). The great majority of UCRs, while conserved
across vertebrate evolution, show no similarity between

the clusters within the species. An intriguing exception is
the set of four UCRs that are highly similar in both cluster
position and nucleotide sequence.

Exceptional mechanisms are brought to bear to retain
UCRs over hundreds of millions of years of parallel evolution. UCRs are more strongly conserved than sequences
encoding identical proteins, and exhibit sequence identity
exceeding essentially all known cis-regulatory sequences.
The retention properties suggest that UCRs have important functions in the vertebrate genome.

The observed UCRs could fall into multiple functional
categories, including enhancers of transcription, regulators of chromatin structure and unknown genes for noncoding transcripts. A small subset of UCRs have been

The human genome contains numerous ultra-conserved
regulatory sequences that are shared broadly across vertebrates. These UCRs occur in arrays of highly conserved regulatory elements spanning large chromosomal regions. The
clusters are co-localized with genes encoding key proteins
for the regulation of development, with a particular correlation with genes encoding transcription factors. The
strength of association between UCRs and diverse classes
of DNA binding transcription factors validates that a relatively simple definition of UCRs captures a biologically
meaningful set of functional sequences. The presence of
non-coding UCRs is predictive for the presence of genes
implicated in development, differentiation and malignancies. The list presented in [Additional file 6] hints at
potentially crucial roles of currently uncharacterized transcription factor genes, while the collection of reported
UCRs provides a wealth of regulatory locations for further
study.

This plot summarizes the distribution of distances to all
UCRs on the same chromosome for each gene in the subset.
There is a visible over-representation of UCRs up to 300 kb
from homeobox genes, and up to 150 kb from C2H2 zinc finger genes.

The high conservation and length of UCRs compared to
binding sites for single transcription factors suggests that
the mode of regulation must involve more than the binding of small number of transcription factors. Homeotypic
clusters of binding sites, as seen in developmental genes
in Drosophila melanogaster [20], represent one regulatory
mechanism that could explain the occurrence of long,
conserved non-coding regions. However, as transcription
factors tolerate considerable variation between functional
binding sites, a homeotypic cluster of binding sites as such
cannot warrant the extreme level of conservation observed
in UCRs. Alternatively, the recent emergence of the role of
microRNAs in regulation suggests that there could be
additional non-coding genes in the human genome, perhaps at the sites of ultra-conservation.

UCRs. UCR locations are shaded in yellow.

The clustering of UCRs suggests that UCR-mediated transcriptional regulation may involve molecular events on a
greater scale, possibly involving chromatin structure. This
potential link to chromatin structure is suggested by the
striking pattern of UCRs in the IRX gene clusters. Most of
the UCRs have no similarity between the two clusters,
with the exception of a set of four UCRs that have retained
both mutual sequence similarity and spatial position (Figure 4). It is tempting to assume that the retention of their
mutual similarity is a consequence of IRX cluster co-regulation, the mechanism of which remains unknown.

realized. Our findings include critical new information
about UCR clusters, particularly with regards to patterns
of conservation, their genomic organization, and the
insights they provide into potential chromatin regulating
mechanisms. These mysterious regions retained over hundreds of millions of years of evolution appear to contribute to a novel mechanism of developmental regulation.
Detailed studies of UCRs that will ensue from the discoveries reported here promise to advance our understanding
of vertebrate development.

Methods
Based on the preservation of nearly identical sequences
over ~450 million years of vertebrate evolution, it is reasonable to postulate the influence of exceptional biochemical mechanisms. Numerous hypotheses could
account for the observed data, broadly falling into two
categories – active mechanism(s) resulting in the decrease
of mutational frequency in UCRs, or negative pressure
consistent with evolutionary selection against such mutations. Given the breadth of possibilities, we leave postulation until further data emerges.

Conclusion
Since Bejerano et al.[9] focused on larger regions (200 bp)
of perfect nucleotide identity compared to our more permissive settings (95% sequence identity over 50 bp), the
genomic arrangement of UCR-containing regions with
respect to their presumptive target genes was not fully

Definition of UCRs applied in this study
We defined UCRs as non-protein coding genomic regions
having a sequence identity > 95% over a 50 bp sliding
window of length in human/mouse comparison (based
on the tight alignments track from the UCSC genome
browser database[17], using human and mouse assemblies hg15 and mm3, respectively). As a further constraint,
an UCR must overlap with sequences conserved between
the human and pufferfish genomes, as defined in the
UCSC genome browser databases (a BLAT [21] alignment
between human and pufferfish with a minimum BLAT
score of 20). In order to avoid inclusion of coding
sequence, we required that a UCR must not overlap a
mouse or human cDNA mapped to the genome (based on
cDNA tracks from from the UCSC genome browser database[17]) or overlap putative coding regions predicted by
GenScan [22].

not contain any of the probed protein domains were located manually (boxed), such as the autism susceptibility gene (chromosome 7, number 37) and the DACH gene (chromosome 13, number 10). The numbers correspond to annotations in [Additional
file 6 and 7]. The figure was created with the help of the Bio::Graphics Perl library[27].

Calculation of UCR and gene distributions
The distribution of UCRs in the genome was calculated by
counting the number of UCRs within a 500 kilobase (kb)
window which was progressively slid over each chromosome in 100 kb intervals. The same approach was used to
estimate the gene density; specifically by summing the
number of bases within the window that aligned with
human mRNA (from the UCSC Genome Browser
database).

was significantly different from the expected, we used the
chi-squared test.

Gene-UCR distance calculation
Distances between a given gene and UCR on the same
chromosome were defined as the shortest distance
between the starting points and/or endpoints of UCR and
gene in the human genome (UCSC assembly hg15), using
EnsEMBL [23] gene annotation. Genes based solely on
ESTs or computational predictions were not included.

Estimation of domain over-representation in genes closest
to UCRs
For each UCR, the closest upstream and downstream gene
within 2 Mbp was identified (UCRs inside introns of
genes were analyzed separately). EnsEMBL InterPro [14]
domain annotation was used to tabulate a contingency
table consisting of the positive sample counts (number of
genes in the set containing a certain domain), negative
sample counts (number of remaining genes in the set),
background positives (number of genes containing the
same domain in the genome) and background negatives
(remaining genes). For clarity, a given gene was only
counted once, and multiple occurrences of the same
domain within the same protein were not counted.

Estimation of significance of Gene-UCR distances
The distances from genes within a set (for instance, all
forkhead domain-containing genes) to the closest UCRs
were calculated as above. The expected fraction of geneUCR distances smaller than 8 kb was estimated by simulation: UCR genome coordinates were randomly chosen
and distances measured as above. The simulation process
was repeated 1000 times and the average fraction
reported. In order to estimate if the observed distribution

For each domain found in the UCR-proximal genes, we
tested the null-hypothesis that the sample and background sets are drawn from the same population versus
the alternative hypothesis that the sample set has a higher
frequency of the domain, using Fisher's Exact Test [24]
from the R statistical package http://www.r-project.org.
Since the number of tests is considerable, we corrected for
multiple sampling using the conservative Bonferroni
method [15], in which the number of tests is multiplied

with the P-value from the Fisher test with the number of
unique domains tested (837). An analogous analysis was
performed with genes containing one or more UCRs
within their introns [see Additional file 4].
Estimation of clustering tendency
We used the distances between consecutive UCRs as a statistic indicating clustering. A neutral background distance
distribution was created by assigning UCRs genome coordinates randomly, and subsequently measuring distances
between consecutive UCRs. This process was repeated
1000 times. We compared the distance distribution
between naturally occurring UCRs and the background
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [25], which assigns a
probability that two distributions are similarly shaped.
UCR sequence similarity analysis
All possible pairs of UCRs were aligned using NCBI
BLASTN [26] with standard settings. For any pair to be
reported as near-identical, we required an HSP of at least
50 bp and a pairwise sequence identity exceeding 75%.

Authors' contributions
AS collected the data and performed most steps of bioinformatic and statistical analysis presented in the paper. He
produced all the Figures in the paper and Table 1, and cowrote the manuscript. PB made initial analyses of putative
regulatory elements on selected genes involved in neural
tube development. He discovered a number of super-conserved regions in the process, which helped create the
rules for their genome-wide computational detection. He
also co-wrote the first versions of the manuscript. SB participated in the annotation of the gene set and in the creation of software for the visualization of results. PE
prepared genome sequence and annotation data for
human, mouse and pufferfish. He and AS designed the
statistical tests applied in the study. JK participated in the
initial analyses and data extraction with PB. WWW participated in result interpretation, design of statistical tests,
and writing later versions of the manuscript. JE initiated
and co-supervised the study, which has the roots in his
research in developmental neurobiology. He also cowrote the manuscript. BL designed and supervised the
bioinformatic study, developed the initial framework for
the analysis of the genomic sequences, made an independent observation about high incidence of clustering of
super-conserved regions around genes encoding DNAbinding proteins, and annotated the UCR clusters with colocalizing genes. He also co-wrote the manuscript.

Genes associated with enumerated UCR clusters from Figure 3. UCRs
were counted by sliding a 500 kb window along the chromosomes. Overlapping UCR-containing windows were merged into a single cluster span.
The cluster span coordinates correspond to the human genome NCBI build
33 (UCSC hg15, April 2003). A more exhaustive list is found in [Additional file 7]
