Analysis of the unexplored features of rrs
(16S rDNA) of the Genus Clostridium
Vipin Chandra Kalia*, Tanmoy Mukherjee, Ashish Bhushan, Jayadev Joshi, Pratap Shankar, Nusrat Huma

Abstract
Background: Bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny based on rrs (16S rDNA) sequencing is being vigorously pursued.
In fact, it has been stated that novel biological findings are driven by comparison and integration of massive data
sets. In spite of a large reservoir of rrs sequencing data of 1,237,963 entries, this analysis invariably needs
supplementation with other genes. The need is to divide the genetic variability within a taxa or genus at their rrs
phylogenetic boundaries and to discover those fundamental features, which will enable the bacteria to naturally
fall within them. Within the large bacterial community, Clostridium represents a large genus of around 110 species
of significant biotechnological and medical importance. Certain Clostridium strains produce some of the deadliest
toxins, which cause heavy economic losses. We have targeted this genus because of its high genetic diversity,
which does not allow accurate typing with the available molecular methods.
Results: Seven hundred sixty five rrs sequences (> 1200 nucleotides, nts) belonging to 110 Clostridium species
were analyzed. On the basis of 404 rrs sequences belonging to 15 Clostridium species, we have developed species
specific: (i) phylogenetic framework, (ii) signatures (30 nts) and (iii) in silico restriction enzyme (14 Type II REs)
digestion patterns. These tools allowed: (i) species level identification of 95 Clostridium sp. which are presently
classified up to genus level, (ii) identification of 84 novel Clostridium spp. and (iii) potential reduction in the number
of Clostridium species represented by small populations.
Conclusions: This integrated approach is quite sensitive and can be easily extended as a molecular tool for
diagnostic and taxonomic identification of any microbe of importance to food industries and health services. Since
rapid and correct identification allows quicker diagnosis and consequently treatment as well, it is likely to lead to
reduction in economic losses and mortality rates.

Background
Bacterial identification becomes a challenge particularly
in case they are either involved in an industrial process
with heavy investments at risk or are a serious threat to
human beings. Sequencing of the rrs (16S rDNA) of
bacteria is vigorously pursued for correct identification
and classification [1-3]. It has led to a large database of
1,237,963 entries http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/. The key
questions which we are addressing: Whether there are
certain latent and as yet un-explored features in the
nucleotide sequences of the rrs, which can be used to
define the phylogenetic limits of a particular genus or
species? Are there certain unique patterns of nucleotide

strings (length and order) and signatures within them,
which can enable tracking the identity of an organism
within the phylogenetic framework? In fact, it has been
stated that novel biological findings are being driven by
comparison and integration of massive data sets [4].
They also predict that numerous tools will be designed
to use such large and well organized data. Comparative
analyses of rrs sequences of Clostridium spp. can be
exploited to develop molecular tools for defining the
genetic variability and tracking the evolutionary events.
Clostridium represents a large bacterial genus of significant biotechnological as well as medical importance.
The diversity of its economic importance varies from
production of solvents - Clostridium beijerinckii, C. acetobutylicum, C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum and C. sachharobutylicum [5], biofuels such as ethanol and hydrogen
- Clostridium thermocellum and C. acetobutylicum [6-9],

indigo dye and flax retting to enzymes as therapeutic and
cosmetic agents [10]. The potential of Clostridium butyricum to naturally produce 1,3-propanediol holds promise
as base material for fiber - poly(propylene terapthalate)
industry [11]. Cheese (Gonda and Grana) industry is
invariably plagued by defects caused by Clostridium tyrobutyricum, C. beijerinckii, C. butyricum and C. sporogenes
[12,13]. In contrast are the Clostridium strains with medical relevance particularly those with abilities to produce
some of the deadliest toxins, leading to devastating clinical conditions [14-16]. Production of potent extracellular
toxins by Clostridium spp. especially those due to
C. botulinum, C. perfringens, C. tetani and C. difficile
result in diseases such as botulism, gas gangrene, tetanus,
pseudomembranous colitis and food-borne illness in man
and animals [17-23]. To summarize, members of the
Clostridium spp. are responsible for economic and medical problems [24].
Multiple methods have been employed for the identification of strains and/or samples of Clostridium and
its species, such as PCR-ribotyping combined with
DNA-DNA reassociation [25,26], Amplified fragment
length polymorphism (AFLP) [17], Randomly amplified
polymorphic DNA [27], Multilocus sequence typing
[28], Restriction enzyme (RE) analysis [29,30] and
Microarray [31].
The heterogeneity of Clostridium species
C. botulinum

The heterogeneity of C. botulinum is evident from the
variability of neurotoxins produced by them. Genetic studies reveal complex relationship between their taxonomy
and toxin types, which needs a thorough re-examination.
Certain non-toxigenic strains of C. botulinum, which
have been genotypically shown to be authentic members
of this species possess cryptic/silent genes or sequences
coding for BoNT [32] but are functionally categorized as
“non-producers”. The complexity of the identification
process is further enhanced by strains which phenotypically resemble Clostridium baratii and C. butyricum yet
produce BoNT types F and E, respectively [33]. So these
strains are referred to as C. botulinum in spite of
the observations made on their DNA-DNA pairing hybridization, rrs sequencing and BoNT-encoding plasmids,
etc. [16].
C. acetobutylicum

Different studies have provided evidences to support
high genetic variability within C. acetobutylicum [34].
C. acetobutylicum is phylogenetically close to C. felsineum but DNA-DNA hybridization studies classify them
as distinct species [34,35]. A genome wide comparison
of C. acetobutylicum with Bacillus subtilis reveals significant local conservation of gene order [36]. Such high
homology between proteins from other taxa emphasizes

Page 2 of 35

the potential of horizontal gene transfer, which leads to
microbial evolution [16,36-38]. Interestingly, B. subtilis
itself has been shown to be very heterogeneous [3,39].
Clostridial and Bacillus binary toxins share 80-85% identity within the i toxin family [40]. Phylogeny and evolutionary relationship within Clostridium are poorly
understood even today [28].
The needs of the genus Clostridium

Clostridium are phylogenetically extremely heterogeneous bacteria [35,41], with many non-spore formers
grouped along with spore forming Clostridium spp.
[42]. Clostridium contains both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative species - C. phytofermentans shows a
Gram-negative reaction in spite of possessing a Grampositive cell wall ultrastructure [43]. In view of multiple hindrances encountered in accurately identifying
these organisms it becomes difficult to establish a
good co-relation between their pathogenic potential
and disease manifestation [44]. The need is to have a
reliable identification system [17] and to recognize distinct genetic-based clusters, which would help to establish a phenotype to genotype co-relation and lead to a
clear taxonomic classification [45]. Since symptoms can
be confusing, the need is to develop molecular genetics
tools for improved diagnosis of Clostridium species
[46]. Another, equaling challenging scenario is encountered due to their GC content, which varies from 24
mol% (C. perfringens) [47] to 58 mol% (Clostridium
barkeri) [48]. Such a wide range of GC content is perhaps too great for a single genus [42] and may even
demand re-classification.
A new dimension to establish evolutionary relationship among bacteria in general and specifically Clostridium species has been added by the availability of a
large reservoir of rrs sequencing data http://rdp.cme.
msu.edu/. Another important development has been the
1173 sequenced genomes http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genomes/lproks.cgi including 224 Firmicutes consisting
of 24 Clostridium spp. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi. All these put together are expected to
prove helpful in redefining microbial taxonomy and
phylogeny [3,4]. It may be remarked that studies based
on rrs sequences need to be supplemented with information on other genes for authentic segregation of isolates [3]. Recent studies based on certain ‘latent’ features
(unique signatures and in silico RE digestion patterns) of
rrs alone could very clearly distinguish the two subgroups of B. subtilis [3], where as others have resorted
to gyrA gene to elucidate this genetic variability [39]. It
also proved instrumental in evaluating the biodiversity
of Stenotrophomonas spp. [49]. The sequence of the 16S
rDNA contains potential opportunities to characterize
and differentiate species.

In this study, we have used rrs sequences to identify
molecular markers, which may be sufficient enough to
segregate Clostridium spp. Here, we have carried out
comparative analyses of rrs sequences belonging to 15
Clostridium species as reference sets for generating
species specific: (i) phylogenetic frameworks, (ii)
signatures (30 nucleotides, nts) and (iii) in silico RE
digestion patterns with 14 Type II REs. These tools
were then used for identifying: (i) Clostridium sp. up
to species level, (ii) identifying potential novel species,
and (iii) tracking phylogenetic relationships among the
other Clostridium species, which have fewer members
at present.

chose 404 for generating phylogenetic framework for
the following 15 species belonging to the first group
(Table 1): C. botulinum - 128, C. perfringens - 92,
C. butyricum - 32, C. acetobutylicum - 24, C. beijerinckii
- 23, C. novyi - 17, C. kluyveri - 14, C. pasteurianum 13, C. sporogenes - 11, C. colicanis and C. sardiniense 9 each, C. baratii, C. chauvoei, C. subterminale and
C. tetani - 8 each. The species-specific phylogenetic framework developed here was used as a tool for (i) identifying 179 organisms Clostridium sp. up to genus level,
and (ii) establishing the phylogenetic relationships
among 182 organisms reported to be occur in low frequency (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Results
The genus Clostridium has been reported (from RDP/
NCBI sites: http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/ to consist of 110 species. For this study,
the selected 765 rrs sequences (> 1200 nts) belonging to
these 110 Clostridium species have been grouped into
three categories (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S1): (i)
15 Clostridium spp. with relatively higher number
(8-128) of identified organisms, (ii) 94 Clostridium spp.
(including 9 un-classified species and 5 species of
Eubacterium) with relatively low frequency (1-15) of
identified organisms and (iii) 179 organisms identified
only up to genus level - Clostridium sp. Out of a total
of 765 rrs sequences of different Clostridium species, we

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences of 128
strains of C. botulinum revealed their segregation into
4 major clusters (CBoI-CBoIV) (Additional file 2:
Figure S1). These different clusters were represented
by 3-83 strains. These four clusters may be representing 4 distinct lineages (I-IV) of C. botulinum, which
have been segregated on the basis of neurotoxin
(BoNTs) produced by them [20,50]. This segregation at
this stage was supported by varied Bootstrap Value
(BV): CBoI showed a BV in the range of 4-536 and
exceptionally a value of 1000, indicating very high
genetic variability among its members. Members of the
cluster CBoII had BV in the range of 242-1000. A relatively low genetic heterogeneity was recorded among
members of clusters CBoIII and CBoIV, where BV varied from 495-1000. In view of the high genetic variability among the different isolates, we selected four rrs
sequences to represent CBoI, whereas two sequences
each were selected for representing the rest three clusters: CBoII-CBoIV. In all, the 10 representative
sequences including the type strains S000414699 and
S000260209 were short listed. These rrs sequences
were distributed all along the phylogenetic tree of
C. botulinum. Further analyses based on nucleotide
signatures and in silico RE digestion patterns
supported the selection of these representatives.
C. perfringens

A phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences of 92
strains of C. perfringens showed 9 distinct clusters
(CPeI-CPeIX) (Additional file 2: Figure S2) each consisting of between 3-20 strains. Four out of these 92 strains
did not fell into any of these clusters. High genetic
diversity among the different strains of C. perfringens
was supported by low BV in each of the clusters. A total
of ten representative sequences, including the one of the
type strain (S000721508) were selected from 6 clusters
(CPeI-CpeIV, CPeVI-CPeVII) for developing phylogenetic framework.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/18

C. butyricum

The 32 different rrs sequences of C. butyricum were distributed largely on 6 different clusters (CBuI-CBuVI)
(Additional file 2: Figure S3) of the phylogenetic tree.
These different clusters were represented by 2-8 strains
each. The low BV in different clades is a clear reflection
on the high genetic heterogeneity within this Clostridium species. In order to represent the genetic heterogeneity of this Clostridium species in the phylogenetic
framework, 3 rrs sequences were short listed (including
one type strain (S000116309) from different clades CBuII, CBuV and CBuVI.
C. acetobutylicum

The 24 strains of C. acetobutylicum were very heterogeneously distributed on their rrs sequence based phylogenetic tree. The two major clades (CAcI-CAcII)
(Additional file 2: Figure S4) consisted of 9 and 5
sequences each, with a BV in the range of 393-1000 and
338-698, respectively. The rest 10 sequences were segregated into 9 different branches with a BV ranging from
7-369 and exceptionally it was 1000. The selection of
five rrs sequences to develop a phylogenetic frame
work was done in order to cover maximum range of
the genetic diversity. Two of the selected strains
(S000437209 and S000000299) represented the extreme
ends of the phylogenetic tree, whereas the type strain
S000628106 was located almost in its middle. A support
to high genetic variability within C. acetobutylicum has
been reported [34], with high potential for horizontal
gene transfers [36].
C. beijerinckii

The 23 sequences of rrs of C. beijerinckii further supported the genetic heterogeneity within Clostridium.
Four distinct clusters (CBeI-CBeIV) (Additional file 2:
Figure S5) each containing 3-8 strains were represented
by highly variable BVs: 197-1000, 95-135, 86-824, and
160-1000, respectively. Three sequences were selected to
represent the diversity of the evolutionary tree: 2 from
CBeI and the type strain (S000014607) from CBeIV.
C. novyi

phylogenetic tree were selected for further use as framework sequences.
C. pasteurianum

The low genetic diversity among the 13 strains of
C. pasteurianum was evident in their rrs sequence based
phylogenetic tree. It showed a major cluster (CPaI)
(Additional file 2: Figure S8) (containing 4 strains),
whereas the rest of the sequences were distributed on
independent branches with a maximum of two in a
group. A total of three strains, including the type strain
(S001792892), were selected for framework sequences.
C. sporogenes

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from 11
strains of C. sporogenes formed a single group (Additional file 2: Figure S9). Two strains, including type
strain (S000260539) and another from the extreme end
of the tree were selected for framework sequences were
taken to represent maximum diversity within this
species.
C. colicanis

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from 9
strains of C. colicanis showed no clear cut grouping as
evident by the low BV (Additional file 2: Figure S10).
Two strains, including type strain (S000366397), representing the two extreme ends of the phylogenetic tree
were selected as framework sequences.
C. sardiniense

High genetic diversity in the phylogenetic tree based on
the rrs sequences from 9 strains of C. sardiniense was
supported by low BV in most of the branches (Additional file 2: Figure S11). Three strains, including type
strain (S000539075), were selected as framework
sequences to represent maximum genetic diversity
within the species.
C. baratii

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from 8
strains of C. baratii showed a single major group with
high BV among most of the strains (Additional file 2:
Figure S12). Three strains, including type strain
(S000009597), were selected for framework sequences.

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from 17
strains of C. novyi showed 4 distinct clusters (CNoICNoIV) (Additional file 2: Figure S6) with 1-6 strains
each. Only one strain (S000750034) was on an extreme
end of these clusters. Four strains, including the type
strain (S000016169) spanning the whole phylogenetic
tree were taken into consideration while developing the
framework.

C. chauvoei

C. kluyveri

C. subterminale

A phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences of 14
strains of C. kluyveri formed 4 distinct clusters (CKlICKlIV) (Additional file 2: Figure S7) each containing at
least 2 strains and a maximum of 6 strains. Two of the
14 strains, present almost at the extreme ends of the

The genetic diversity within the rrs sequences of 8
strains of C. subterminale was quite low, as evident
from the phylogenetic tree (CSuI-CSuII) (Additional
file 2: Figure S14). Two representatives, one from each
cluster, including the type strain (S000389872) were

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from 8
strains of C. chauvoei showed no clear cut grouping as
reflected by the wide range of BV, which varied from
246-1000 (Additional file 2: Figure S13). Two strains,
including type strain (S000437764), one from either end
of the tree were selected for developing the phylogenetic
framework.

found to be sufficient for developing the phylogenetic
frame work.
C. tetani

Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from 8
strains of C. tetani species showed three small groups
(CTeI-CTeIII) (Additional file 2: Figure S15). Two
strains, including type strain (S000260778), one from
each end of the tree were selected for framework
sequences to ensure inclusion of maximum diversity
within the species in the study.
A total of 56 rrs sequences were short listed to represent the genetic diversity in 15 different Clostridium
species (Table 2). A reference phylogenetic tree based
on framework sequences (Figure 1) shows clear cut segregation of rrs sequences into separate clades, each consisting of members of C. butyricum, C. chauvoei,
C. colicanis, C. kluyveri, C. perfringens and C. tetani. In
contrast, C. acetobutylicum was found to be segregated
into two groups (i) one close to C. pasteurianum (BV
874) and (ii) another showing high similarity with
C. beijerinckii and C. butyricum. High heterogeneity was
observed between C. baratii and C. sardiniense. The
most heterogeneous group was represented by the
strains of C. botulinum. Four different associations were
recorded between C. botulinum and (i) C. sporogenes,
(ii) C. subterminale, (iii) C. novyi and (iv) a group of
C. acetobutylicum and C. butyricum The most interesting feature of the reference phylogenetic framework tree
were (i) completely independent placing of C. chauvoei,
C. kluyveri, C. tetani and (ii) close relationships among

(a) C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum and

C. botulinum, C. pasteurianum and C. subterminale (BV
874-926).
Validation of species-specific phylogenetic framework
sequences

In our quest to validate the phylogenetic framework
sequences, different phylogenetic trees were drawn on
the basis of 404 rrs sequences belonging to 15 different
Clostridium species along with 56 reference sequences.
Seven different phylogenetic trees (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8) very clearly showed that the Clostridium isolates
segregated well within their respective phylogenetic framework sequences except C. acetobutylicum (Figure 2).
In the case of C. acetobutylicum eighteen rrs sequences
segregated well with the type strain (S000628106) and 2
framework sequences and the rest six (including two
frame work sequences) formed an independent group,
which was quite close to C. beijerinckii along with
C. butyricum.
(i) Phylogenetic relationships of Clostridium sp

The phylogenetic framework of rrs sequences described
above was used to check if 179 isolates identified as
Clostridium sp. can be classified among these Clostridium species reported to occur with high frequency
(Figures 9, 10 and 11). Out of these 179 Clostridium sp.,
95 were found to segregate among 15 Clostridium

species with a high BV (Figures 9 and 10, Table 3):
C. acetobutylicum - 29, C. subterminale - 20 (Figure 9),
C. tetani - 7, C. baratii and C. botulinum - 5 each,
C. sporogenes/C. botulinum and C. chauvoei - 4 each,
C. pasteurianum and C. kluyveri - 3 each, C. botulinum/
C. butyricum - 2 and C. perfringens - 1 (Figure 10). A
unique case of 11 Clostridium sp. was their association
with C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii albeit with
low BV of 350-460 (Figure 10). However, subsequent
analyses (signatures and in silico RE digestion pattern)
revealed that these 11 Clostridium species can be classified as C. beijerinckii. Incidentally, none of the Clostridium sp. was found to belong to C. sardiniense, C. novyi
and C. colicanis. A group of 84 rrs sequences of Clostridium sp. could not be grouped among the 15 known
Clostridium species (Figure 11). Since these 84 isolates
have the potential to be classified as novel Clostridium
species, these were also checked for their phylogenetic
relationships with Clostridium spp. with low frequency
of occurrence.

Page 17 of 35

(ii) Phylogenetic relationships of Clostridium species with
low frequency occurrence

A total of 182 rrs sequences of Clostridium isolates
belonging to 80 distinct species and 7 groups which
have been classified as swine manure, intestinal bacterium, Eubacterium, etc. (Additional file 1: Table S1) were
found to form distinct phylogenetic groups (Figures 12
and 13, Additional file 3: Figure S16). The evolutionary
relationship among the 68 rrs sequences of Clostridium
spp. (Table 4) which have been reported so far to occur
with a low frequency formed a few very distinct and
independent groups along with those occurring with
relatively high frequency, for example - C. subterminale
and C. estertheticum. Although these appear to be close
on a single clade but are phylogenetically quite distant
as evident by low BV 385. Another clade, which harbored C. subterminale was associated quite closely (BV
703) with Clostridium tunisiense, and red sea bacterium
on one clade, Clostridium sulfidigenes, C. thiosulfatireducens and bacterium isolates (BV 852-1000) on a

Clostridium spp. known to occur with low frequency were found to be phylogentically close to Clostridium spp. used for developing Framework (Table 2) were
also similar with respect to their in silico REb digestion pattern and uniquec nucleotide signatures (30 nts in lengths) (Table 6) c+/- denotes presence/absence of a

second clade and yet another branch carried swine manure bacterium (BV 961). The two species - C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii reported to occur with high
frequency were weakly grouped along with Clostridium
diolis (BV 219), C. chromoreductans (BV 398), and
C. corinoforum and C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum (BV
643), but showed strong association with C. roseum (BV
998), C. puniceum and C. favososporum (BV 823),
(Figure 12). These diverse Clostridium species are quite
heterogeneous and reflect their individual identities.
However, their grouping together indicates the possibility of their common origin, which was quite high in the
case of C. kluyveri branching with C. tyrobutyricum (BV
1000) but moderate in the case of Clostridium ljungdahlii (BV 548). C. botulinum, which is known to be genetically quite heterogeneous, showed close relationship
with Eubacterium and rumen bacterium (BV 664-932)
on one hand and with C. neonatale on the other (BV
996). Similarly, C. acetobutylicum showed strong association with Clostridium aurantibutyricum, C. felsineum
and C. roseum (BV 998-1000). It also branched along
with Clostridium collagenovorans albeit with a relatively
low BV of 615. C. botulinum and C. novyi shared a
branch on the phylogenetic tree along with C. haemolyticum (BV 932-1000). C. tetani is a unique Clostridium
sp. which appears to be of independent origin; however,
it showed closeness to Clostridium cochlearium and
C. tetanomorphum (BV 982-1000). C. chauvoei was
found to be close to Clostridium carnis and C. septicum

(BV 995-1000), whereas C. pasteurianum showed high
homology with C. acidisoli and C. akagii (BV 1000) and
less homology with Clostridiales in general (BV 670)
(Figure 12). Thirty one rrs sequences of Clostridium
isolates belonging to swine fecal, unidentified eubacterium and clostrideaceae bacterium (Additional file 1:
Table S1), which did not cluster with Clostridium spp.,
were found to have an overall low phylogenetic relationship (Additional file 3: Figure S16). The evolutionary
relationship among the rest 83 of 182 rrs sequences of
Clostridium spp. which have been reported so far to
occur with a low frequency formed a few very distinct
and independent groups (Figure 13).
(iii) Phylogenetic relationships of novel Clostridium species

Out of 179 isolates of Clostridium sp., 84 rrs sequences
which have the potential to be classified as novel were
found to be represented by 56 groups (Additional file 4:
Table S2). A quite low BVs among them implies high
genetic heterogeneity (Additional file 5: Figure S17). To
further verify if these 84 Clostridium sp. are of independent origin, their phylogenetic relationships were
checked with Clostridium spp. reported to occur with
low frequency (Additional file 4: Table S3). It can be
seen from the phylogenetic trees (Additional file 6:
Figures S18 and S19) that they are quite independent as
supported by low BV. The possibility of assigning these
84 rrs sequences to novel Clostridium species was
further supported by subsequent analyses - nucleotide
signatures and in silico RE digestion patterns.

In silico restriction enzyme activity

Our recent studies [3,49] have revealed a high level of
latent characteristics within rrs sequences based on in
silico digestion with 14 Type II REs. These in silico
digestions have resulted in predicting clear cut fragment
lengths in the rrs with six REs: AluI, BfaI, DpnII, HaeIII,
RsaI and Tru9I [3,49]. In the present study, 7 REs AluI, BfaI, DpnII, HaeIII, RsaI, SmaI and Tru9I were
found effective in drawing meaningful conclusions
(Figures 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20). RE sites for
BamHI, NotI, PstI and SacI were almost completely
absent from the rrs sequences of all the strains of 15
Clostridium spp. and thus proved to be ‘’non"-cutters
(Additional file 7: Table S4). Another group, which did
not permit clear cut conclusions to be drawn was composed of the following three REs: EcoRI, HindIII, and
NruI, with one RE site each (leading to two fragments
of varied lengths) in most of the Clostridium strains.
AluI

In silico digestion of rrs sequences of 15 different
Clostridium spp. with RE - AluI resulted in 4-8 fragments. The segregation of Clostridium species was evident at two levels - (i) intra-species and (ii) inter-species.
Intra-species variation was observed among C. pasteurianum - rrs sequences, which were found to possess 4-7 RE
- AluI digestion sites. Two fragments of 186-610 nts were
found in all the four groups. At the 5’ end, upstream of
the 186 nts fragments, the RE sites were not detectable
such that the two fragments of 12 and 49 nts seem to
have merged together to generate a 61/62 nts long

Page 22 of 35

fragment. Similarly on the 3’ end, the merger of the two
fragments of 207 and 142 nts resulted in a larger nucleotide fragment of 349 nts (Figure 14).
Intra-species level segregation was also evident in case
of C. botulinum. Here, the 120/128 rrs sequences were
found to be distributed into 5 groups of 5, 10, 21, 22
and 62 sequences each. The largest group of 62
sequences of C. botulinum had 5 RE - AluI digestion
sites resulting in the following fragments between them:
170-795-265-85 nts. The next group of 21 sequences of
C. botulinum was quite close to the former. However, it
lacked a RE site at the 5’ end, such that one could not
predict the presence of 170 nts sized fragment. The two
smaller groups of 10 and 22 rrs sequences of C. botulinum had 6-7 RE - AluI sites each. These two groups
shared the following fragment sizes and the order of
their occurrence: 566-228/230-205/207-57-109 nts. The
later group of 22 of C. botulinum sequences had an
additional RE site which led to the prediction of a 170
nts fragment at the 5’ end of this gene. It may be
remarked that these four groups differed because of the
absence/presence of RE sites (Figure 14).
Variability in the RE - AluI sites among rrs sequences
of C. acetobutylicum was also quite high. Out of 24 rrs
sequences, 17 of them showed two RE - AluI sites
resulting in clear cut fragment of 797 nts. On the other
hand, a small group of 3 sequences had additional RE
sites, which resulted in additional fragments of 170 nts
at 5’ end and 266 nts at 3’ end. C. butyricum 3/32 and
3/24 C. acetobutylicum rrs sequences show high homology in their RE - AluI digestion pattern. C. baratii and

C. sardiniense had similar RE patterns leading to the
following order of fragments - 186-604/605-206-57-109
nts. The situation of C. colicanis was unique as it
resembled C. baratii and C. sardiniense except in the
absence of a RE - AluI site resulting in the merger of
206-57 nts fragments into a single fragment of 264 nts.
On the other hand, C. colicanis showed high resemblance in its in silico RE digestion pattern to most
C. perfringens (66/92 sequences) (Figure 14).

A perusal of all the numbers and the order of occurrence of the fragments predicted to be generated by RE
-AluI in silico digestion enabled us to segregate the
following: (i) C. acetobutylicum (17/24 sequences), (ii)
C. chauvoei, (iii) C. colicanis, (iv) C. kluyveri, (v) C. pasteurianum, (vi) C. perfringens, and (vii) C. subterminale
(Additional file 4: Table S2). C. sporogenes/C. botulinum
(62/128 sequences) are indistinguishable here but can be
distinguished on the basis of other REs (Figure 14).

BfaI

With RE - BfaI in silico digestion of rrs sequences of
15 Clostridium species predicted the presence of 5-8
fragments of distinct nucleotide sizes. Intra-species
level variability among RE - BfaI generated fragments
was evident in C. acetobutylicum and C. botulinum.
RE digestion of C. acetobutylicum rrs sequences
resulted in segregating them into two populations - (i)

16/24 sequences and (ii) 4/24 sequences. These two
populations of C. acetobutylicum showed high similarity in RE pattern towards their 3’ end: 146-159/160161/164-68-126 nts fragments. They differed by the
presence of two additional RE - BfaI sites, which
resulted in two more fragments of 378-29 nts towards
the 5’end of the 4/24 rrs sequences of C. acetobutylicum (Figure 15).

On the basis of RE - BfaI in silico digestion of rrs of
C. botulinum, high genetic heterogeneity was evident
among the 128 isolates. The four groups of C. botulinum were composed of as follows: (i) 57, (ii) 27, (iii) 9,
and (iv) 34/128 sequences. All the four groups of
C. botulinum could be easily distinguished on the basis
of their RE - BfaI digestion fragment lengths. The first
group of 57/128 C. botulinum had a unique RE - BfaI
digestion pattern: 195-20-163-29-146-185-331 nts in

Page 25 of 35

their rrs. Second group of 27/128 C. botulinum had
similarity only with C. sporogenes for their RE - BfaI
digestion pattern: 378-29-146-185-331 nts in their rrs.
It differed from the first group due to merger of three
fragments 195-20-163 at the 5’ end in to a single fragment of 378 nts in the latter. The third group of 9/128
C. botulinum were found to possess an in silico RE BfaI digestion pattern: 378-29-146-158-231-126 nts in
their rrs sequences. It was similar to that observed in
C. novyi and C. tetani. The fourth cluster of C. botulinum (34/128 sequences), did not show any genetic
variability with respect to RE - BfaI in silico activities
with respect to those observed in C. beijerinckii,
C. butyricum, C. sardiniense, C. subterminale, and
C. acetobutylicum (4/24 sequences) (Figure 15). This
feature implies that these species might have a common phylogenetic origin.
On the basis of inter-species variation in the RE - BfaI
sites on the rrs the following Clostridium species can be
distinguished from the rest of the species: C. acetobutylicum (16/24 sequences), C. baratii, C. botulinum
(57/128 sequences), C. chauvoei, C. colicanis, C. kluyveri,
C. pasteurianum and C. perfringens (Additional file 4:
Table S2).
DpnII

In the case of in silico digestion of rrs sequences with
RE - DpnII, a large intra-species variation was evident in
the cases of 9 different Clostridium species: (i) C. acetobutylicum, (ii) C. baratii, (iii) C. beijerinckii, (iv) C.

botulinum, (v) C. butyricum, (vi) C. kluyveri, (vii) C.
novyi, (viii) C. pasteurianum and (ix) C. perfringens. On
the other hand, interspecies variation was evident in the
cases of C. chauvoei, C. colicanis, C. sardiniense, C. subterminale and C. tetani. In spite of high homology
among different Clostridium species in terms of the
order, number and length of the fragments generated by
RE - DpnII, the following seven Clostridium species:
C. butyricum, C. chauvoei, C. colicanis, C. kluyveri,
C. subterminale and C. tetani could still be easily distinguished (Figure 16, Additional file 4: Table S2). On the
other hand, in spite of certain unique features in
C. acetobutylicum and C. perfringens, intra-species variation did not allow complete segregation and may need
supplementary information from other REs.

In silico RE - HaeIII, RsaI, SmaI and Tru9I digestion of
rrs of 15 Clostridium species resulted in predicting the
presence of 1-12 sites. Due to high variation in the characteristics of the nucleotide fragments within and
among Clostridium species, a unique RE digestion pattern was observed in in the following cases: (i) C. chauvoei, C. colicanis, C. kluyveri and C. tetani with HaeIII
(Figure 17, Table 5), (ii) C. novyi with RsaI (Figure 18,
Table 5), (iii) C. colicanis with SmaI (Figure 19, Table 5)
and (iv) C. baratii, C. novyi and C. sardiniense with
Tru9I (Figure 20, Table 5). It implies limited scope for
exploiting these REs for identification purposes.
In silico RE digestion of rrs of 15 Clostridium species
enabled us to identify unique features (order of occurrence and length, nts) of this gene which can be used as
bio-markers (Table 5). C. butyricum, C. perfringens and
C. sardiniense could be distinguished from all other
Clostridium spp. on the basis of the in silico digestion
with RE - DpnII, BfaI and Tru9I, respectively. C. baratii,
C. novyi, C. pasteurianum, C. subterminale and C. tetani
could be distinguished from the rest of the species on
the basis of in silico digestion pattern of their rrs with
all REs except SmaI. The most interesting features seem
to reside in the rrs sequences of C. chauvoei, C. colicanis
and C. kluyveri, which possessed unique pattern of
active sites for 4-5 different REs such that any one of
these was sufficient to identify them. In the cases of
C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum and
C. sporogenes, no unique pattern could be detected. For
the groups comprised of (i) C. botulinum - C. sporogenes
and (ii) C. acetobutylicum - C. beijerinckii, we could not
detect any unique RE digestion patterns and may need
to be compared with a combination of REs. The close
phylogenetic relationship between C. botulinum and
C. sporogenes has been reported previously also [51].
Since they differ on the basis of their phylogenetic
relationship (Figures 1, 4 and 5), it appears that C.

In the cases of C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum and C.

separately. The different groups are based on their phylogenetic relationship
(Figure 1). It is further assumed here that C. beijerinckii is a part of population
comprised of C. acetobutylicum and similarly C. sporogenes is a part of C.
botulinum.

beijerinckii is a part of population comprised of C. acetobutylicum and similarly C. sporogenes is a part of isolates
belonging to C. botulinum. Alternatively, the issue can be
resolved by creating new species by subdividing C. acetobutylicum and C. botulinum.
Validation of framework sequences by in silico RE activity
on 16S rDNA sequences of organisms identified as
Clostridium sp

The second level of investigation after segregating
Clostridium sp. (95 isolates) (Table 3) on the basis of
phylogenetic frame work was to validate them on the
basis of unique RE digestion patterns deduced from the
rrs sequences of 15 known Clostridium spp.
C. acetobutylicum

In the case of C. acetobutylicum, two distinct populations were observed in the initial phylogenetic tree
which was based on rrs sequences of 24 isolates of this
species. A similar trend of two major groups was very
clearly evident also on the basis of RE - AluI in silico
digestion patterns: (i) 186-611-264 nts and (ii) 798 nts.
The 29 Clostridium sp., which we could classify as
C. acetobutylicum on the basis of phylogenetic framework (Table 3) were further supported by RE digestion
patterns of their rrs sequences. Here also we could
observe that the total population was composed of 2

Kalia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/18

different groups, consisting of 12 and 17 organisms
each. The two groups segregated due to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) at RE sites. Modifications in
RE sites can arise primarily through single nucleotide
insertion, deletion and/or substitution [52].
C. beijerinckii

High homology between C. beijerinckii and C. acetobutylicum was evident due to similarities in in silico digestion pattern generated by the action of most of the REs
employed in this study especially - AluI, BfaI, HaeIII,
RsaI, SmaI and Tru9I. However, it was “unique” in its
RE pattern with respect to DpnII. The rrs sequences of
C. beijerinckii on digestion with RE - Tru9I showed a
pattern of 114-40-363-26-251-34-52-56-76-76-117 nts,
which is quite similar to that recorded with a proportion
of C. acetobutylicum population. However, these could
be distinguished on the basis of RE - DpnII in silico
digestion fragments 287 or 287-1196 nts found in rrs
sequences of C. acetobutylicum, but were absent in
these 13 newly identified C. beijerinckii isolates. Thus,
we recommend the usage of a combination of DpnII
and Tru9I to validate the identification of 13 Clostridium sp. as C. beijerinckii (Table 3).
C. subterminale

The phylogenetic framework based on 8 rrs sequences
of C. subterminale allowed identification of 2 unique in
silico RE digestion patterns with AluI and DpnII. The
validation of 20 Clostridium sp. which could be classified as C. subterminale through phylogenetic framework
(Table 3) was done through in silico RE digestion of
their 16S rDNA with both the REs. Thus in silico digestions supported the segregation of these Clostridium sp.
as C. subterminale. Two of three populations were distinct on the basis of the uniqueness of their fragment
characteristics - number, length and order of occurrence
(i) RE - AluI a) 345-450-347 nts and b) 170-796-207143 nts and (ii) RE - DpnII a) 285-565-632 and b) 273565 nts. However, the third group of isolates identified
as C. subterminale was intermediate to the other two
populations with respect to the patterns obtained with
both the REs - AluI and DpnII.
C. botulinum and C. sporogenes

C. botulinum sp. produces seven serotypes (A through
G) of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) [16,20]. It shows
4 distinct lineages (I-IV) [33,50], where good correlations have been found between their phenotypes and
phylogenetic classification: (i) Group I - proteolytic C.
botulinum types A, B and F which are close to C. sporogenes, (ii) Group II consists of saccharolytic types B, E
and F, (iii) Group III includes types C and D and C.
novyi type A and (iv) Group IV has Clostridium argentinense (C. botulinum type G) and C. subterminale [32].
Based on DNA S1 nuclease analysis, C. botulinum was
found to be genetically close to C. sporogenes at the

Page 27 of 35

species level, however, the later was proposed to be conserved for non-toxigenic strains [51].
In a phylogenetic tree based only on the framework
sequences, C. botulinum and C. sporogenes were found
to occur together on a single clade. A comparison of the
different in silico RE digestion patterns of rrs of C. sporogenes and C. botulinum showed exact homology in the
cases of REs - AluI, BfaI, HaeIII, RsaI, Tru9I and SmaI
except DpnII (Figures 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20). In
the case of DpnII, C. sporogenes was segregated into 2
populations, where one of them showed exact homology
with C. botulinum and the other one was different and
unique in comparison to all other Clostridium species.
It may not be too inappropriate to suggest that C. sporogenes is perhaps a sub-species of C. botulinum or it may
find its appropriate place if C. botulinum can be reclassified as 4 different sub-species. This proposal finds support from the RE pattern of sequences of Clostridium
species (S000357670 and S000357671) which had been
classified as C. sporogenes with the help of phylogenetic
frame work. Nine Clostridium sp. which appeared close
to C. botulinum, C. sporogenes and C. novyi (Table 3)
were found to be similar to each other with respect to
the in silico activities of one or more REs - Tru9I,
HaeIII, AluI and BfaI.
Other Clostridium spp

The rest 24 Clostridium sp. identified up to species level
on the basis of phylogenetic framework (Table 3), could
be supported also by high similarity in the in silico RE
digestion pattern of their rrs: (i) C. tetani - HaeIII, (ii)
C. chauvoei - AluI and BfaI, (iii) C. kluyveri - AluI, (iv)
C. pasteurianum and C. perfringens - BfaI and (v)
C. baratii - Tru9I and BfaI (Figures 14, 15, 17 and 20).
The phylogenetic relationships observed among Clostridium spp. reported to occur with low frequency
formed quite distinct clusters. Sixty eight rrs sequences
belonging to 37 species were found to clusters along
with 14 Clostridium spp. used for framework analysis.
The close relationship among the different Clostridium
spp. was validated by comparing their in silico analysis
RE digestion pattern of their rrs (Table 4), which
matched invariably with the unique RE pattern of
known Clostridium spp. It is perhaps the first report
where in 37 different Clostridium species have been
segregated among 14 groups based on phylogeny and
in silico RE digestion pattern of their rrs.
Nucleotide signature analysis - frequency and distribution
pattern

To further validate the segregation of Clostridium sp.
done on the basis of phylogenetic frame work, we investigated them for the presence of nucleotide signatures
(30 nts) deduced from isolates of the 15 known
Clostridium spp. The validity of the nucleotide

Kalia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/18

signatures was done through the frequency of occurrence of the reference organism among the top 10 hits
(BLAST).
The sequences of 8-128 data sets submitted groupwise to MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation)
program http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_5_0/cgi-bin/
meme.cgi revealed ten signatures (30 nts) for each species. Regular expression diagram of signatures (nts)
(Additional file 8: Figures S20,S21,S22,S23,S24,S25,S26,
S27,S28,S29, S30,S31,S32,S33,S34,S35 and S36) and the
frequency of occurrence of motifs obtained through
MEME for different taxonomic groups have been presented with reference to 15 Clostridium spp. (Additional
file 9: Tables S5-S20).
Out of the 10 signatures (30 nts), identified in each of
the 15 different Clostridium spp., unique signatures in
the rrs sequences (Table 6) were found in the following
cases: C. beijerinckii and C. sporogenes - 1 each,
C. butyricum - 2, C. colicanis - 4, C. kluyveri, C. pasteurianum and C. perfringens - 5 each, C. chauvoei - 6 and
C. tetani - 9. However, using similar strategy, no unique
signatures could be identified in the cases of (i) C. baratii and C. sardiniense, (ii) C. botulinum, C. novyi and
C. subterminale and (iii) C. acetobutyilicum. These latter
6 Clostridium spp. have been dealt with separately as
detailed below.
C. baratii and C. sardiniense

Out of 10 signatures deduced among the rrs sequences
of 8 isolates of C. baratii only two - M3 and M6 could
be designated as “unique”. In fact, these two signatures
were absent from all other Clostridium spp. except C.
sardiniense. Similarly, in C. sardiniense 6 out of 10
nucleotide signatures were found to be “unique” to it
but were present in the overall rrs sequence of C. baratii. We may conclude that although these two Clostridium spp. did not show any exact resemblance in their
signatures, however, they shared 19 out of 20 signatures
in their overall rrs sequence. Thus it is difficult to use
them for segregating the two Clostridium species. This
observation of high homology is further supported by
the fact that C. baratii and C. sardiniense are phylogenetically present on a single clade and had high BV in the
range of 654-999 (Figure 1). In spite of such high similarity they could be separated on the basis of nucleotide
signature (M2) of C. baratii - 5-TATTGTTAGTTGCTACCATTTAGTTGAGCA-3’ (which incidentally was
present in most other Clostridium species).
C. botulinum and C. acetobutylicum

Organisms belonging to C. botulinum were segregated
phylogenetically into 4 groups. Distinct nucleotide signatures could be detected on segregating 128 rrs
sequences of C. botulinum isolates into two groups - i)
83 equivalent to CBoI of the phylogenetic tree (Additional file 2: Figure S1) and ii) 45 representing (CBoII-

Page 28 of 35

CBoIV) (Additional file 2: Figure S1). The first group of
83 isolates had 5 unique nucleotide signatures, which
could be used to distinguish them from all other Clostridium species except C. sporogenes isolates. On the other
hand, 45 rrs sequences of isolates belonging to CBoIICBoIV could not be distinguished on the basis of the 10
nucleotide signatures deduced from their rrs sequences.
Previous reports of screening with four REs and 30 primers combinations revealed that HindIII and HpyCH4IV are effective in demonstrating extensive diversity
among C. botulinum type E, whereas C. botulinum
Group I indicted low genetic diversity [50,53,54]. A
similar scenario was evident also in the case of C. acetobutylicum. It prompted us to conclude that C. acetobutylicum and C. botulinum perhaps represent ancestral
Clostridium species.
Validation of framework sequences for Clostridium sp:
nucleotide signatures

To validate the categorization and classification of 95 rrs
sequences of Clostridium sp. belonging to 13 Clostridium spp. (Additional file 9: Table S21), we looked up
for 10 nucleotide signatures of the reference framework
sequences in them. Of these 10 signatures, the emphasis
has been laid on i) the signatures unique to a particular
Clostridium sp. and ii) presence of rest of the signatures.
On the basis of these two criteria, we may conclude that
Clostridium spp.: C. subterminale - 16/20 sequences, C.
tetani - 2/7 sequences, C. perfringens - 1/1 sequence, C.
pasteurianum - 4/4 sequences, C. baratii and C. sardiniense - 5/5 sequences showed quite close match with
the reference framework sequences. On the other hand,
C. beijerinckii had only one unique signature which was
absent in 13/13 sequences of Clostridium sp. but due to
the presence of all other signatures we may conclude
that they are quite close to the reference framework
sequences. Similarly, C. acetobutylicum showed that
29/29 Clostridium sp. were quite similar to the reference
sequences. This implies that in these cases signature
analysis supports the framework sequence based analysis. However, in the following Clostridium spp., the
identified Clostridium sp. did not show much homology
with respect to the signatures found in the reference
framework sequences: (i) C. botulinum, (ii) C. chauvoei,
C. kluyveri, C. novyi and C. sporogenes.

Discussion
Molecular techniques have added new dimensions and
sensitivity to the phylogeny and taxonomy of organisms.
The most remarkable and widely acknowledged are the
unique features of highly conserved gene - rrs [55].
Based on rrs sequencing Collins et al. revealed the polyphyletic nature of Clostridium sensu stricto [35]. Since
then there have been many additions and rectifications

Out of the two groups of 45 and 83 organisms, no unique signature could be detected in the first group,
b

in the classification of Clostridium [56,57]. There are
two major issues with respect to Clostridial taxonomy
and phylogeny. First is the high genetic diversity - GC
content, which varies from 24 mol% (C. perfringens) [47]
to 58 mol% (C. barkeri) [48]. It is perhaps too wide a
range to encompass a single genus [42] and may need
revision. Secondly, Clostridium comprises a very heterogeneous group of bacteria representing more than 110
spp., with a large proportion having only 1-5 strains.
The question is whether we should split the genus Clostridium (especially C. acetobutylicum and C. botulinum)
and/or we may merge quite a few of its species (small
sized). In certain cases of recent speciation events,
where rrs is not sufficient to discriminate phylogenetically close relatives, one resorts to DNA-DNA reassociation technique [58]. In spite of an ever increasing
knowledge about various conserved genes for distinguishing microbes [3], rrs continues to be quite effective
in segregating and even in reclassifying quite a few
microbial isolates as new genera and species. A large
number of organisms reported initially as Bacillus species [59] have been reclassified as genus Geobacillus
[60], Sporosarcina [61], or Marinibacillus marinus [62].
In fact, many species of Clostridium [35] have also been
reclassified as new genera, such as Sedimentibacter [63].
The three Clostridium spp. - C. carboxidivorans, C. drakei, and C. scatologenes, which showed high (99.7-99.8%)
sequence similarity for their rrs sequences [64] were
later found to be distinct species based on their DNADNA reassociation values [58]. In spite of such high
volume of data available on rrs http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/,
the fact remains that it needs support from other genes
to arrive at authentic conclusions. Does it imply that rrs
is already at its dead end? or Do we need to look deeper
into the latent and as yet un-explored features of this
wonderful gene?

Our recent studies on the diversity of Bacillus spp. [3]
and Stenotrophomonas isolates [49] revealed certain very
interesting ‘latent’ features of rrs. We could designate
rrs of certain isolates as phylogenetic framework
sequences. These were supported by species specific
unique signatures and in silico RE patterns. Together, all
these features of rrs allowed us to (i) classify Bacillus
sp., reveal novel lineages and distinguish the two subgroups of B. subtilis [3] and (ii) evaluate the biodiversity
of Stenotrophomonas isolates [49]. These studies indicate
towards unexplored features within the rrs to define and
circumscribe the genus Clostridium sensu stricto [52].
The species-specific phylogenetic framework developed here proved instrumental as a tool to deducing the
limits of genetic diversity within 15 Clostridium spp.
The validity of the phylogenetic framework sequences
was established by clear cut segregation of members of
a given Clostridium sp. against a total of 56 rrs
sequences (Table 2, Figure 1). High genetic heterogeneity was recorded among members of C. acetobutylicum
and C. botulinum in our study. It has been previously
supported by significant differences in their physiological and genetic characteristics [65,66]. Within the 56
framework sequences of 16S rDNA of 15 Clostridium
spp. based phylogenetic tree, we observed the 5 framework sequences of C. acetobutylicum to segregate in to
two groups: (i) 2 sequences were close to C. beijerinckii
and C. butyricum and (ii) 3 were close to C. pasteurianum (Figure 1). The findings in our study find support
from previous phylogenetic studies based on concatenated sequences of 37 proteins, which showed that
C. acetobutylicum clusters along with C. beijerinckii in
addition to other species such as C. botulinum, C. kluyveri, C. novyi, C. perfringens, and C. tetani with 100%
BV [52]. In fact, 24 strains belonging to C. acetobutylicum were reclassified as either C. beijerinckii (Sub group

Kalia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/18

3) or C. saccharobutylicum [25,46]. Here, we observed
that some strains of C. acetobutylicum are phylogenetically close to C. felsineum, however DNA-DNA hybridization study [34] shows them to be distinct species.
Similarly, C. botulinum is well known to for its
segregation on the basis of a wide range of neurotoxins
produced by them [16,28,67]. Here in our study,
C. botulinum 16S rDNA sequences showed 4 clear
grouping in accordance with those reported in literature
[32]: (i) C. sporogenes, (ii) a group of C. butyricum and
C. acetobutylicum, (iii) C. novyi and (iv) C. subterminale.
This close relationship among the species of Clostridium
cluster I (C. botulinum, C. acetobutylicum and C. novyi)
finds support from the presence of 4 amino acid insert
in a highly conserved region of Gyrase A protein, which
could not be traced in any other Clostridia or other
group of bacteria [52]. High phylogenetic closeness
based on rrs has been reported between C. botulinum
and C. sporogenes [18,68] and C. botulinum type G and
C. subterminale [32]. Three distinct lineages of C. botulinum were confirmed by AFLP analysis of their rrs
sequences [32]. In the present work, other close
relationships were observed among (i) C. baratii, C. colicanis and C. sardiniense (BV 840-1000) and (ii) C. botulinum and C. novyi (BV 703-1000). A complete
molecular typing of C. botulinum is needed for correct
classification of this species [50]. In depth analysis of rrs
reported here can in fact provide enough supplementary
information to counter multilocus sequence typing
recommended for elucidating phylogeny of C. botulinum
[28]. On the basis of the evidences provided here (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Figures 1, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 and
20), we further propose here that C. botulinum needs to
be reclassified in to 4 different (sub)-species, as is generally believed by many researchers [16]. The validity of
Framework sequences was further confirmed in the case
of the classification of 95 Clostridium sp. up to species
level, by in silico RE digestions especially - AluI, BfaI
and DpnII (Figures 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20).
Our present analysis which shows a close phylogenetic
relationship between C. subterminale and certain Clostridium spp. such as C. argentinense, C. estertheticum,
and C. thiosulfatireducens (Table 4), finds support from
the previous reports of Spring et al., [69]. Although
C. tetanomorphum has been observed to be close to
C. subterminale and C. thiosulfatireducens with a 97%
BV [70] but we found it to be close to C. tetani (BV
982). Unlike previous studies [17,42,71], we could
demonstrate closer relationships among (i) C. puniceum,
C. beijerinckii and C. butyricum and (ii) C. haemolyticum and C. novyi with a much smaller number of rrs
frame work sequences.
Quite a few species of other Clostridial genera in
Cluster I belong to Eubacterium moniliforme, E.

Page 31 of 35

terantellae, Ancerobacter polyendosporus, Sarcina ventriculi and S. maxima [42]. As far as Eubacterium is
concerned, several Clostridium spp. have been reclassified within newly created genera: Moorella and Oxobacter [45] or within Eubacterium itself [35]. C.
barkeri, a member of Cluster XV was found close to
Eubacterium limosum with a level of similarity as high
as 95% [35]. In Cluster XVI: phylogenetically significant association was observed among the 3 species Eubacterium biforme, C. innocuum, and Streptococcus
pleomorphus [35]. In the present study, Eubacterium
combesii, E. moniliforme and E. budayi were found to
cluster with C. botulinum, C. baratii and C. sardiniense, respectively.
High similarity in the nucleotide signatures within rrs
sequences of C. acetobutylicum and C. botulinum
prompt us to speculate that C. acetobutylicum and
C. botulinum might have common ancestor. In fact,
these two Clostridium spp. shared 34-35% of the total
rrs sequences. Similarly, we have observed that certain
signatures are common to almost all the 15 Clostridium
spp. which were used for developing framework
sequences. It may be remarked that at least 18 common
signatures (30 nts) were distributed along the length of
the rrs (Additional file 10: Table S22). The most unique
features were the positions of signatures with maximum
frequency, which varied from 394-1170, implying higher
susceptibility of the flanking regions to genetic modifications. In fact, such large core regions were also observed
in Bacillus sp. [3]. It can be concluded that about 540
nts were shared by different Clostridium spp. and may
represent those sequences which are highly conserved
during evolution and may be designated as representatives of the genus Clostridium.

Conclusions
rrs sequences have certain features such as nucleotide
signatures (25 to 30 nts long) and unique RE digestion
patterns which can be exploited for (re)defining bacterial
taxonomy and phylogeny. This approach enabled us to
develop species specific phylogenetic framework. These
genetic tools allowed us to categorize Clostridium isolates which have been classified presently up to genus
level into (i) well defined Clostridium spp. and (ii) as
novel species. It also holds promise to reduce the
number of Clostridium species represented by small
populations. This integrated approach is quite sensitive
and can be easily extended as a molecular tool for diagnosis of microbes used in food industries and health
departments.
It appears as if we are reiterating (today in 2010) the
statement made by Prof. C.L. Oakley, almost 6 decades
ago: “Little is gained by multiplying genera to include
rare or imperfectly-described forms, though increase in

Kalia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/18

our knowledge may justify subdivision of the genus
(Clostridium) in the future.” [72].

Methods
Sequence data

The rrs sequences (> 1200 nts) chosen for this study
corresponds to a total of 765 isolates belonging to the
genus Clostridium (from RDP/NCBI sites: http://rdp.
cme.msu.edu/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. These
included sequences belonging to isolates of C. botulinum - 128, C. perfringens - 92, C. butyricum - 32,
C. acetobutylicum - 24, C. beijerinckii - 23, C. novyi 17, C. kluyveri - 14, C. pasteurianum - 13, C. sporogenes
- 11, C. colicanis and C. sardiniense - 9 each, C. baratii,
C. chauvoei, C. subterminale and C. tetani - 8 each,
Clostridium sp. - 179 and Clostridium spp. having members with low frequency (Table 1). The first fifteen sets
of Clostridium species consisting of 404 rrs sequences
were used as the reference species set for generating
species specific: (i) phylogenetic framework, (ii) signatures and (iii) in silico RE digestion pattern. These tools
were then used for identifying (i) Clostridium sp. up to
species level and (ii) developing phylogenetic relationships among the other Clostridium species, which are
represented by relatively smaller number of isolates.
Phylogenetic Analyses

For phylogenetic analyses, rrs sequences of each of
these 15 species were assembled and aligned using the
multiple alignment program - ClustalX version 2.0.12
[73]. To estimate evolutionary distance, pairwise distances between all species were calculated with the
DNADIST of the PHYLIP 3.69 package [3,74]. The
resultant distance matrix was then used to draw a
neighbour joining tree with the program NEIGHBOR.
The program SEQBOOT [74] was used for statistical
testing of the trees by resampling the dataset 1000
times. The trees were viewed through TreeView
Version 1.6.6 [75], Phylodraw [76], MEGA [77] (Additional file 2: Figures S1,S2,S3,S4,S5,S6,S7,S8,S9,S1,S11,
S12, S13,S14 and S15). For each of these 15 data sets, a
‘guide’ tree was made and 2-10 representative
sequences were selected to develop framework
sequences for the rest of the study. Thus a reference
set of 56 rrs sequences was selected and regarded these
as likely candidates that could give information about
the organismal phylogeny (Figure 1). These framework
sequences were validated by using 404 rrs sequences
from 15 Clostridium species (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and 8). Subsequently, these 56 framework sequences
were used to reclassify the Clostridium sp. (Figures 9,
10 and 11) and show phylogenetic relationships among
other Clostridium spp. (with small populations) (Figures
12 and 13, Additional file 3: Figure S16).

Page 32 of 35

In order to establish whether the 84 rrs sequences of
Clostridium sp. which could not be clearly segregated
among 15 Clostridium species (Figure 11), they were
checked for their phylogenetic relationship with 80 Clostridium spp. (consisting of small populations) in the following manner. Initially, these 84 sequences (Figure 11)
were reduced to 56 representative sequences on the
basis of their distribution on the phylogenetic tree
(Additional file 5: Figure S17). Two phylogenetic trees
of 28 sequences each were drawn (Additional file 6:
Figures S18 and S19) along with 83 sequences of 80 different Clostridium sp. (Additional file 4: Table S3).
Restriction Enzyme Analyses

A total of 14 Type II REs http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/
rebase.html were considered for these analyses: (i) 4 nts
cutters - AluI (AG↓CT), BfaI (C↓TAG), DpnII
(↓GATC), HaeIII (GG↓CC), RsaI (GT↓AC), Tru9I
(T↓TAA), (ii) 6 nts cutters - BamHI (G↓GATCC), EcoRI
(G↓AATTC), HindIII (A↓AGCTT), NruI (TCG↓CGA),
SacI (GAGCT↓C), SmaI (CCC↓GGG), PstI (CTGCA↓G)
and (iii) 8 nts cutter - NotI (GC↓GGCCGC) [3]. All the
15 Clostridium species considered for developing the
phylogenetic framework were checked for all the 14
Type II RE using the online software: Restriction
Mapper Version 3 http://www.restrictionmapper.org/.
Sequences (one at a time) were entered in the restriction mapper site by removing all non base characters,
results obtained were analyzed and consensus pattern
was determined for each species depending upon its frequency of occurrence and the nucleotide fragment
lengths of the sequences. The different Clostridium sp.
and Clostridium spp. with low frequency of occurrence
were checked for these consensus RE patterns.
Clostridium Species-Specific Signatures

MEME has been used here for searching novel motifs or
signatures in sets of biological sequences. MEME works
by searching for repeated, ungapped sequence patterns
that occur in the DNA or protein sequences [78,79].
MEME searches can be performed via the web server
http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_4_0/intro.html and its
mirror sites [79]. To successfully discover motifs with
MEME, it is necessary to choose and prepare the input
sequences carefully. Ideally, the sequences should be,
1000 base pairs long [80]. In our analysis, sequences of
each of the 15 data sets in FASTA format were submitted group wise in MEME program Version 4.4.0
http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_4_0/intro.html. In order
to obtain maximum number of motifs in our sequences,
we modified default settings from 3-10 motifs. The
default value of motif widths, set between 6 (minimum)
and 50 (maximum) were modified and re-set between
25 and 30, respectively. We used default setting zero or

Kalia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/18

one motif per sequence to get the occurrence of single
motif which is distributed among the sequences. MEME
search stops when this number of motifs has been
found, or when none can be found with E-value less
than 10000 http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_4_0/intro.
html. Since, it posed a restriction of using 60000 characters at a time, we also used its stand alone format
(MEME program Version 4.3.0) for our study for generating nucleotide signatures for data sets having greater
than 60000 characters (for example in the cases of
C. botulinum and C. perfringens, (Additional file 8:
Figures S20,S21,S22 and S23, Additional file 11: Tables
S23,S24,S25 and S26), where a large data was compressed for easy comprehension. Each of the 10 signatures (30 nts) (Additional file 9: Tables S5-S20) was
checked through BioEdit [81] for its frequency of occurrence among all the sequences of all the 15 Clostridium
spp. and the ones with highest frequency that did not
appear in other Clostridium spp. were considered as
unique to this species. In the case of 128 rrs sequences
of C. botulinum, we could not detect any unique signatures. We thus divided the C. botulinum isolates into
two groups of 83 and 45 on the basis of their distribution on the phylogenetic (guide) tree (Additional file 2:
Figure S1). The rrs sequences of these two groups were
then analyzed through MEME for identifying unique
nucleotide signatures. These unique motifs were used as
query sequence to validate the Clostridium spp. segregated through phylogenetic framework. The MEME
result gives a graphic representation and Motifs in
regular expression format.
