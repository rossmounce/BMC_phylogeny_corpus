Use of Multiple Displacement Amplification as
Pre-polymerase Chain Reaction (Pre-PCR) to
amplify genomic DNA of siphonapterids
preserved for long periods in scientific collections
Daniel M Avelar†, Pedro M Linardi*†

Abstract
The recently developed Multiple Displacement Amplification technique (MDA) allows for the production of a large
quantity of high quality genomic DNA from low amounts of the original DNA. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the MDA technique to amplify genomic DNA of siphonapterids that have been stored for
long periods in 70% ethanol at room temperature. We subjected each DNA sample to two different methodologies: (1) amplification of mitochondrial 16S sequences without MDA; (2) amplification of 16S after MDA. All the
samples obtained from these procedures were then sequenced. Only 4 samples (15.4%) subjected to method 1
showed amplification. In contrast, the application of MDA (method 2) improved the performance substantially, with
24 samples (92.3%) showing amplification, with significant difference. Interestingly, one of the samples successfully
amplified with this method was originally collected in 1909. All of the sequenced samples displayed satisfactory
results in quality evaluations (Phred ≥ 20) and good similarities, as identified with the BLASTn tool. Our results
demonstrate that the use of MDA may be an effective tool in molecular studies involving specimens of fleas that
have traditionally been considered inadequately preserved for such purposes.
Findings
The Neotropical region (excluding Mexico) contains 52
genera and about 280 species of fleas, and one of the
most important families is Tungidae [1-3]. Females of
the genus Tunga Jarocki, 1838 (Tungidae) penetrate into
the skin of their hosts, including armadillos, anteaters,
rodents, pigs, humans, dogs and other domestic animals
[4]. After mating, gravid females undergoes hypertrophy,
becoming a neosome 5-10 mm in size [5-7]. Taxonomic
knowledge regarding siphonapterids is based primarily
on morphological analysis of specimens permanently
mounted on slides or preserved in 70% ethanol [3].
With the advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and other molecular approaches, DNA has become an
excellent tool to study phylogenetic relationships [8].

However, in fleas few studies have analyzed genetic
diversity in preserved specimens [9-11].
Many species of fleas have been identified from a
small number of adult specimens mounted on permanent slides or adults and neosomes preserved in 70%
ethanol at room temperature in scientific collections
[12]. The DNA of samples preserved under these conditions for long periods is generally of poor quality and is
often degraded, preventing its use in molecular studies
[13]. Recently, some newly-developed methods have
demonstrated high efficiency in the amplification of
whole genomes from small amounts of template DNA.
One of theses is the multiple displacement amplification
method (MDA), a process that uses the bacteriophage
29 DNA polymerase and exonuclease-resistant, thiophosphate-modified, degenerate hexamers to amplify
genomic DNA from crude or pure sources and that has
been used in some studies [14-19]. The enzyme 29
DNA polymerase replicates DNA at a constant temperature of 30°C in a few hours without a thermal cycler

and includes more complete genome coverage and
unbiased amplification compared with PCR-based methods [14]. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use
of MDA for the amplification of genomic DNA from
siphonapterids preserved in scientific collections for
long periods in 70% ethanol at room temperature.
Twenty-six of the samples analyzed were obtained
from specimens deposited in the ectoparasites collection
of the Department of Parasitology at the Universidade
Federal de Minas Gerais and the Museum of Zoology at
the Universidade de São Paulo. All of the samples were
preserved in 70% ethanol at room temperature
(Table 1). Samples used as controls [two Ctenocephalides felis felis (Bouché, 1835) and two Tunga penetrans
(L., 1758)], were collected and preserved in absolute
ethyl-alcohol and stored at - 20°C.
Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue
Kit (QIAGEN). Samples of adult fleas or neosomes
(Figure 1) were used as the sources for DNA extraction.
The specimens (a flea or a neosome) were dissected,
mechanically shredded, and incubated with lysis buffer
containing Proteinase K for 4 h. Afterwards, we followed
the recommended protocols supplied by the manufacturer [10]. Following extraction, we subjected each sample to two different methodologies: (1) amplification of
mitochondrial 16S sequences without MDA; (2) amplification of 16S after MDA. The exoskeletons obtained
from the dissection were permanently mounted on
slides [3]. The Repli-g® Fast Mini kit (QIAGEN) was
used for MDA of siphonapterid DNA, according to the

manufacturer’s instructions. The MDA-DNA preparations were stored at -20°C.
PCR amplification of DNA from single flea or neosome
samples was performed using the primers Sen-mt16S
TAC ATA ACA CGA GAA GAC C and Rev-mt16S GTG
ATT GCG CTG TTA TCC, as previously described [20].
The HotStar MasterMix Kit was used for PCR reactions,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN).
The samples were scored as positive for amplification if a
PCR product of approximately 200 bp was detected.
No-template control reactions were routinely performed.
PCR products were purified using a QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). The BigDye® Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS) was
used for sequence determination by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed in an
automatic sequencer (3130 × l APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS).
The sequences produced were analyzed using the
CodonCode Aligner software (Phred algorithm) for the
analysis of sequencing quality. Additionally, the samples
obtained were submitted to the BLASTn tool from the
National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
to evaluate sequence similarity. The chi-square test with
the Yates correction was used to compare the two
methodologies: without or with MDA.
Morphological analysis identified the following species
[3,21]: Tunga penetrans, T. bondari Wagner, 1932,
T. caecata (Enderlein, 1901), T. terasma Jordan, 1937,
T. travassosi Pinto & Dreyfus, 1927, Tunga sp. and
C. felis felis (Table 1).

Without the use of MDA, only four samples (15.4%)
displayed successful amplification of the 16s sequences
(one of C. felis felis, collected in 2008; one of T. penetrans, collected in 2007 and two of T. caecata, collected
in 2005 and 2007) (Figure 2). In contrast, application of
the MDA technique permitted amplification from 24
samples (92.3%), presenting significant differences
between the methods employed (c2 = 27.92; p < 0.01).
These samples varied greatly in their collection times:
T. penetrans (N = 5, in 2002 and 2007); T. travassosi
(N = 2, in 1916 and 1966); T. caecata (N = 6, in 1970,
1980, 1990, 2005, 2006, 2007); T. terasma (N = 2, in
1996, 2003); T. bondari (N = 1, in 1909); Tunga sp.
(N = 2, in 2000); C. felis felis (N = 6, in 1979, 1988,
1998, 2008) (Figure 3). Both amplification protocols
(with and without the use of MDA) generated fragments
of approximately 200 bp when performed on positive
control samples.
All the sequences obtained showed satisfactory quality
(Phred ≥ 20) (Figure 4). The samples of T. penetrans

evaluated using the BLASTn tool showed a 100% degree
of similarity with the reference sequence. The other
samples did not have specific sequence references, but
the primary matches identified were always to samples
belonging to the same genus (Figure 5).
Collections are vital for taxonomic research and the
study of biodiversity [22]. Otherwise, insects preserved
in absolute or 70% ethanol and maintained at room
temperature show a loss in the quality and quantity of
DNA, compromising their use in genetic analysis [13].
Our results support this observation, as we were only
able to amplify the 200 bp fragment corresponding to
the 16S region of the mitochondrial rDNA from recently
preserved samples.
In this study, we demonstrate the highly effective use of
a commercially available MDA-based method for whole
genome amplification of siphonapterid DNA from samples of adults and neosomes preserved in 70% ethanol at
room temperature. The use of the MDA technique prior
to the amplification of the target DNA (mtDNA 16S)
allowed us to detect the 200 bp fragment in samples preserved under non-ideal conditions for long periods,

including from one specimen collected in 1909. MDAbased commercial kits have been successfully used in the
amplification of total genomic DNA from a wide range of
organisms, including humans [23], dogs [17], pygmy elephantids [19], nematodes [18], mites [16] and insects
[15]. A question raised by some authors is the possibility
of amplification of contaminating DNA, instead of DNA
from the target organism [18]. The similarity analysis
performed using the BLASTn tool excluded the possibility of contamination, since the sequences obtained
showed a 100% similarity to known samples (T. penetrans). For samples lacking reference sequences in the
NCBI database, the primary matches identified were all
from specimens belonging to the same genus, reinforcing
the absence of contamination.
One of the possible applications of the MDA technique is its use in the amplification of DNA from samples
with historical value that have been maintained in scientific collections [15,16,18]. The results obtained here
support this idea, as this is the first reported use of the
MDA technique in the amplification of DNA from fleas
stored in museums. It is important to point out that,
concerning tungid fleas, a large part of samples preserved in scientific collections is constituted by

neosomes removed from several sites of their hosts
(Figures 1, 2). Although some museums do not allow
dissection of type specimens due to the risks of damage
[24], sometimes it is necessary to dissect neosomes for
identification, since that a dissected specimen is not a
damaged specimen. Among siphonapterids, many species are morphologically indistinguishable (eg, some
female fleas Rhopalopsyllidae) or have their identification difficult due to loss of structures (eg, loss of legs
and bristles in Tungidae, during the formation of the
neosome) [3,21]. Moreover, the morphological characteristics used in the identification of species of fleas are
often autapomorphic, having limited use for phylogenetic reconstruction [11]. On that account, sometimes
fleas need to be genotyped. Otherwise, fleas act as vectors of several diseases, including bacteria, Protozoa and
helminths [25-27], in which the quantity of endosymbionts available for molecular analysis is often limited.
The combined application of MDA and conventional
protocols for siphonapterid DNA amplification may be a
valuable new tool for molecular studies concerning taxonomy, phylogeny and epidemiology, involving samples
of fleas that have, until now, been considered inadequately preserved for such purposes.
