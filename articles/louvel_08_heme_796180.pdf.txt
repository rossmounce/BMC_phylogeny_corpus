Abstract
Background: Heme is typically a major iron source for bacteria, but little is known about how
bacteria of the Leptospira genus, composed of both saprophytic and pathogenic species, access
heme.
Results: In this study, we analysed a two-component system of the saprophyte Leptospira biflexa.
In vitro phosphorylation and site-directed mutagenesis assays showed that Hklep is a histidine kinase
which, after autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine, transfers the phosphate to an essential
aspartate of the response regulator Rrlep. Hklep/Rrlep two-component system mutants were
generated in L. biflexa. The mutants could only grow in medium supplemented with hemin or δaminolevulinic acid (ALA). In the pathogen L. interrogans, the hklep and rrlep orthologous genes are
located between hemE and hemL genes, which encode proteins involved in heme biosynthesis. The
L. biflexa hklep mutant could be complemented with a replicative plasmid harbouring the L.
interrogans orthologous gene, suggesting that these two-component systems are functionally
similar. By real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we also observed that this twocomponent system might influence the expression of heme biosynthetic genes.
Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that the Hklep/Rrlep regulatory system is critical for the
in vitro growth of L. biflexa, and suggest that this two-component system is involved in a complex
mechanism that regulates the heme biosynthetic pathway.

Background
Leptospires are spirochetes divided between saprophytic
and pathogenic species that remain poorly understood
because of the limited availability of genetic tools. For
example, targeted gene inactivation is not feasible in pathogenic Leptospira species.
Iron is an essential nutrient for the growth of leptospires
like for most of the bacteria and the ability to acquire iron
certainly contributes to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria. We previously showed that leptospires can take up a

wide diversity of iron sources including heme, which is
the most abundant iron source in host [1]. We also
showed that L. biflexa possesses genes encoding putative
heme acquisition systems such as TonB-dependent receptors and ABC transporters and a putative heme oxygenase
that could allow the release of iron from heme [2]. Heme
is a ubiquitous molecule involved in many major cellular
processes. For example, heme is a cofactor for catalases
and peroxidases and is an integral component of the electron transport chain where it serves as an electron carrier
for cytochromes. Leptospira spp. possess genes that encode

enzymes for the heme biosynthetic pathway unlike the
spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum. In
a previous study [3], we showed that inactivation of hemH
in L. biflexa, which encodes the ferrochelatase that introduces one iron molecule into the porphyrin ring, generates heme requirement. Taken together, our previous
results argue that hemin is an iron source as well as an
heme source for leptospires. Free heme is toxic to bacterial
cells, so heme biosynthesis is usually tightly regulated.
However, little is known about how organisms regulate
both the acquisition of exogenous heme and synthesis of
heme [4].
We used transposon mutagenesis to generate a mutant
library in the saprophyte L. biflexa that we screened onto
media with or without hemin supplementation [2]. A
heme-requiring mutant was isolated with an insertion in
a gene that was predicted to encode the regulator of a twocomponent system. Such systems regulate gene expression
in many bacteria in order to support a physiological
response. Two-component systems detect a wide variety
of environmental signals, including iron availability [5,6].
These systems typically comprise a membrane-associated
sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic transcription regulator.
The sensor autophosphorylates in response to stimuli and
then transfers the phosphate group to the response regulator, which binds to specific promoters and, thus, acts as
a transcriptional regulator [7]. Two-component systems
are involved in many processes such as motility, virulence
gene expression, and oxidative stress response [7].
In this study, we investigated the biochemical and physiological properties of this two-component system of L.
biflexa to elucidate its role in heme metabolism.

Results
L. biflexa hklep and rrlep mutants only grow with heme
and heme precursor
Himar1 mutagenesis was previously used to identify genes
involved in heme utilization by L. biflexa [2]. One of the
transposon mutants, which was only able to grow in
EMJH supplemented with hemin, but not in EMJH alone,
exhibited the transposon into a putative gene encoding
the response regulator of a two-component system (Figure
1A). RT-PCR results showed that the two genes, rrlep and
hklep, of this putative two-component system are co-transcribed as an operon in L. biflexa (data not shown). To
investigate the functions of these two-component signalling genes in L. biflexa, we constructed rrlep and hklep deletion mutants by targeted gene replacement. Again, the
resulting mutant strains were unable to grow on EMJH
medium unless exogenous hemin was added (Figure 2).
These mutants were also able to grow in EMJH medium
supplemented with haemoglobin and δ-aminolevulinic
acid (ALA) a key intermediate in heme biosynthesis path-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/25

way, but not with other potential sources of iron, e.g. iron
salts or desferrioxamine. These results then indicate that
only a source of heme or a precursor could support the
growth of the mutant strains in EMJH (Figure 2).
Transformation of each mutant strain with the replicative
plasmid harbouring the respective two-component signalling gene of L. biflexa restored a wild-type growth in EMJH
medium (Figures 2 and 3). These results indicate that the
growth defect was due to the inactivation of the two-component system and not to second-site mutations. It also
suggests that there is no cross-talk between regulators and
kinases of other cognate pairs of two-component systems
in the bacterium. We concluded that the system has a crucial role in the survival of leptospires in EMJH and for
heme supplying.
The homologous two-component system of the pathogen
L. interrogans is genetically linked to heme biosynthesis
genes
The complete genome sequences of four pathogenic Leptospira are available, namely L. interrogans serovar Lai, L.
interrogans serovar Copenhageni, and two strains of L.
borgpetersenii serovar Hardojobovis [8-10]. The L. biflexa
two-component system was found in these four pathogenic strains and the proteins share 66% and 69% similarities with LB014 sensor and LB015 regulator of L.
interrogans, respectively (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, the twocomponent system found in the pathogens is genetically
linked to the genes of the heme biosynthesis pathway, as
it is also the case in the phylogenetically distant deltaproteobacteria Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (data not shown).
These genomic data may support a functional association
between the two-component system and the biosynthesis
of heme. The L. biflexa hklep mutant was complemented
by the putative sensor gene of L. interrogans (LB014) carried on the shuttle vector (Figure 3). However, expression
of the regulator gene of L. interrogans (LB015) of both
LB014 and LB015 (data not shown) in the L. biflexa rrlep
mutant did not restore wild-type growth (Figure 3). This
may indicate that the heterologous expression of the L.
interrogans regulator does not allow interactions with the
L. biflexa sensor or L. biflexa target DNAs. In conclusion,
the orthologous two-component systems in L. biflexa and
L. interrogans are partially replaceable and functionally
similar.
Signal transduction through Hklep/Rrlep relies on
phosphorylation capabilities
Sequence analysis of the two-component system of both
L. biflexa and L. interrogans reveals that it is a classical His/
Asp-dependent two-component system consisting of a
histidine protein kinase and a response regulator with
receiver and transmitter domains. The first reaction in the
signalling cascade consists in the autophosphorylation of

a highly conserved histidine residue of the histidine
kinase. By incubating with [γ-32P]ATP, the recombinant
Hklep protein was rapidly phosphorylated (Figure 4a).
The phosphorylation assays also allowed the observation
of a secondary signal corresponding to twice the expected
size of Hklep, suggesting that Hklep may form homodimers (Figures 4 and 5). Following the autophosphorylation
of the sensor kinase, the phosphate group is typically
transferred to an aspartyl residue of the conserved N-terminal receiver domain of the response regulator. By incubating Rrlep with the phosphorylated Hklep, we observed
both phosphorylation of the regulator and reduction of
the phosphosignal of the kinase (Figure 4B). The amount
of labelled Rrlep also decreased during the course of the
experiment, possibly due to unstable phosphorylation.
Based on sequence alignments of other two-component
systems, the histidine residue at position 98 in Hklep was
predicted to be the auphosphorylation site, and the aspartate D53 of Rrlep the site of phosphotransfer (data not
shown). To confirm the identity of the phosphate-donor

and -receiver residues, we mutated the H98 and D53 of
Hklep and Rrlep, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. In vitro phosphorylation assays showed that
Hklep(H98A) was not able to autophosphorylate anymore (Figures 3 and 5) and that Rrlep(D53A) was not
subject to phosphotransfer and did not stimulate the
dephosphorylation of the kinase (Figures 3 and 5). In
addition, the mutated alleles were unable to complement
the hklep and rrlep mutant strains (Figure 3). In conclusion, H98 and D53 are key residues for the phosphorylation mechanisms of the L. biflexa Hklep/Rrlep twocomponent system.
Rrlep/Hklep may regulate the expression of heme
biosynthesis genes
The C-terminal region of Rrlep (residues 110 to 227) is
predicted to contain a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding
motif. The response regulator may bind to target DNAs via
this domain while being phosphorylated. Furthermore,
two-component response regulators typically autoregulate their own expression. Quantitative Reverse Transcrip-

Growth of
Growth of L. biflexa hklep and rrlep mutant strains in EMJH medium. A. The rrlep and hklep mutants grew as well as
the wild-type strain (wt) in EMJH liquid medium supplemented with hemin or δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). However, the
mutants did not grow in EMJH liquid medium. B. Complementation of the L. biflexa rrlep mutant. Transformation of L. biflexa

supplemented with hemin. The growth of the rrlep mutant complemented by the rrlep wild type gene was similar to the wild
type growth onto EMJH plates. Strains were incubated at 30°C for one week.

tion-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays showed that inactivation of
rrlep gene in L. biflexa led to a four-fold decrease in transcript level of hklep (data not shown). The expression of
this two-component system is therefore likely to be
autoregulated by the response regulator. No significant
change was observed in the relative expression of the twocomponent signalling genes in the wild-type strain cultivated with or without hemin or δ-aminolevulinic acid
(data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest
that another regulator is involved in the regulation of this
two-component system.

higher with hemin than without hemin in the wild-type
strain of L. biflexa (data not shown). Expression of
hemAEL was significantly decreased, from 2 to 10 fold, in
hklep and rrlep mutants relative to the wild-type strain.
Conversely, hklep and rrlep mutations displayed weaker
effects on hemH expression. We concluded that heme biosynthesis genes may be regulated in response to heme
availability. The Hklep/Rrlep two-component system may
regulate hemAEL genes but not, or differently, hemH,
which is transcribed in the opposite direction and then
apart from the heme biosynthetic genes.

Since the L. interrogans two-component system (LB014LB015) is clustered with heme biosynthetic genes (Figure
1), we investigated the expression of L. biflexa hem genes
in response to heme availability by qRT-PCR. We compared the expression of hemL, leading to δ-aminolevulinic
acid synthesis, hemE, hemA and hemH in L. biflexa wildtype and mutant strains in media supplemented with low
(2 μM) or high (10 μM) level of hemin (Figure 6). Our
results showed that hemAELH expression was 2 to 4 fold

The periplasmic loop of the kinase is not essential but the
cytoplasmic region is not sufficient to ensure physiological
function
Hklep is a sensor histidine kinase with two predicted Nterminally located transmembrane segments that may
anchor the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane of L. biflexa. The extracytoplasmic region between transmembrane
segments is usually involved in the detection of environmental stimuli in other sensor kinases. Since we assumed

the inner membrane through two transmembrane segments (TM1-TM2) separated by a periplasmic loop (PL) that could correspond to the sensing domain. The residue histidine 98 is predicted to be the site of phosphorylation. The asterisk marks its
mutation into an alanine residue in Hklep(H98A). In HklepΔ, the periplasmic loop is replaced by another sequence (see Materials and Methods). In Hklep (80–253), the putative sensing domain is deleted and the original promoter of hklep is replaced by a
leptospiral promoter. (B) The L. biflexa Rrlep protein is composed of two domains. The residue aspartate 53 is predicted to be
the site of phosphorylation. The asterisk marks its mutation into an alanine residue in Rrlep(D53A). Lbi and Lint refer to the L.

The expression of HklepH98A, Hklep(80–253), Rrlep(D53A), or Rrlep-Lint (LB015) failed to complement their respective mutant and was characterized by an absence of growth (-) in EMJH medium like observed for hklep and rrlep mutants.

that the periplasmic loop region of Hklep is involved in
the detection of the environmental signal, the corresponding 32 amino acids (residues 31 to 62) were
replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting plasmid construct was then used to complement the L. biflexa
hklep mutant. The hklep gene lacking the original periplasmic loop was still able to complement the hklep mutant,
i.e. it restores a wild-type growth in EMJH without hemin
(Figure 3). This suggests that the periplasmic loop is not
involved in the recognition of the signal. Nevertheless, L.
biflexa hklep mutant could not be complemented with a
Hklep protein lacking both the predicted transmembrane
segments and the periplasmic loop (Figure 3).

Discussion
To isolate hemin-requiring mutants, we used transposon
mutagenesis in L. biflexa and identified the Hklep/Rrlep
two-component system. In this study, we showed that
Hklep is a histidine kinase which, after autophosphorylation of H98, transfers the phosphate to D53 of the
response regulator Rrlep.
The mutants of this two-component system can only grow
in medium supplemented with hemin or δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) but not with other iron sources, suggesting that the mutants need to acquire exogenous
hemin as an heme source instead of an iron source. This
also suggests that Hklep/Rrlep contributes to the regula-

tion of steps leading to ALA synthesis. Although significant differences were detected in the relative expression of
the hemAEL genes in the mutant versus the wild-type, we
do not have conclusive evidence for direct regulation of
hem genes by the two-component system. We postulate
that the two-component response regulator may be connected in interacting networks and cascades of regulation.
Most bacteria possess many two-component systems, and
the L. interrogans genome is predicted to encode 25 [11],
that are required to control the activity of many genes in
response to a variety of environmental signals. A key
aspect of any regulatory system is the identity of the environmental signal to which the system responds. Our data
suggest that the Hklep/Rrlep system senses environmental
and/or intracellular heme. Two-component system
kinases are supposed to detect environmental signals
through their periplasmic domain [7]. Our results showed
that the predicted periplasmic loop is not essential for the
function purpose of the system. However, it remains possible that the N-terminal domain of Hklep, including the
putative membrane-spanning regions, plays a role in signal detection.
Biosynthesis of porphyrins and related compounds proceeds via a common set of intermediates from ALA
through the first cyclic tetrapyrrole, uroporphyrinogen III,
at which point the pathway splits into two branches, one
leading to reduced products such as siroheme and vitamin

including hemes, bilins, and bacteriochlorophylls. The
expression of hem genes is usually transcriptionally regulated in response to exogenous heme concentration [4]. In
L. biflexa, the transcription of the hem genes that we studied is significantly increased on hemin addition. Hklep/
Rrlep may be, at least indirectly, responsible for the regulation of several hem genes.
The orthologous two-component systems in pathogenic
Leptospira spp. are arranged in a novel fashion, distinct
from that in typical bacterial heme biosynthetic loci, and
this provides genetic evidence for hem reorganization in
Leptospira. Transcription analyses in L. interrogans showed
that hemE and hemL are co-transcribed with hklep and
rrlep, consistent with an operon organization of hem and
two-component signalling genes (data not shown). The
biological significance of this gene association remains
open, but strengthens the role of the two-component system in heme metabolism.

with the appropriate antibiotics and chemicals.

described [15]. Plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).

control, the 23S rRNA (23S rRNA = 1.0) was used for normalization of transcript levels. Experiments were performed
in triplicate from distinct cultures to establish standard deviations.

Conclusion
The in vivo characterization of L. biflexa hklep and rrlep
mutants argues for a role for this regulatory system in
heme metabolism. However, the precise role of this twocomponent system remains unclear and further investigations will be necessary for identifying both its signal and
target. Further investigation should also include the study
of biochemical properties and transcriptional regulation
of the homologous two-component system in the pathogens. As heme transport, storage, and metabolism are
important for pathogenic bacteria [12], this system might
contribute to the pathogenicity potential of leptospires.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc strain Patoc I and L. interrogans serovar Lai strain Lai were grown at 30°C in EMJH
[13,14]. When necessary, media were supplemented with
2 to 10 μM hemin, 10 μM haemoglobin, or 50 μM δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Kanamycin and spectinomycin
were added at 40 μg ml-1. Escherichia coli XL10 (Invitrogen) and E. coli RosettaBlue(DE3) (Novagen) were grown

For transcription studies, RNAs were isolated from exponential phase cultures of L. biflexa grown in EMJH, EMJH
with 2 or 10 μM hemin or EMJH after an overnight incubation of the cells with 0.25 mM 2,2'-dipyridyl. Total
RNAs were extracted using Tri-reagent solution and
DNase I treatment following the manufacturer recommendations (Ambion Inc.). Absence of DNA contamination was checked by PCR. RNA concentrations were
measured by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. RNAs were
analyzed by RT-PCR using SuperScript One Step RT-PCR
with Platinium Taq (Invitrogen). Quantitative reversetranscription PCR was performed in two steps as previously described [16]. Data from amplifications were analysed with the quantification program RelQuant (Roche).
The relative expression of the target genes was normalized
to the 23S rRNA. Quantitative expressions were evaluated
in triplicate from three independent RNA extractions.
Recombinant protein expression and purification
To overproduce the proteins in E. coli, the full-length rrlep
and the truncated hklep (region corresponding to residues
90–300) coding sequences from L. biflexa were amplified
by PCR (nucleotide sequences of primer pairs available on
request) and cloned into the HindIII and XhoI restriction
sites of pET30a(+) (Novagen), generating pETrrlep and
pEThklep, respectively. E. coli RosettaBlue(DE3) strain
(Novagen) harbouring the pET30a(+)-based constructs
were grown in LB supplemented with 25 μg chloramphenicol ml-1 and 50 μg kanamycin ml-1 at 37°C to a OD600 of
0.6–0.8. IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) was
added at a final concentration of 1 mM and the cultures
were further incubated for several hours. E. coli cells were
washed into lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM
NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), lyzed by freezing and thawing
followed by sonication, then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for
20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was recovered and incubated with Ni2+-agarose beads (Qiagen). In every case, the
purity of the studied proteins was > 90 %, as judged by
Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration
was determined by Bradford protein assay (Biorad). To
differentiate the proteins on gel, we produced Hklep with
a N-terminal His-tag (31 kDa) and Rrlep without a His-tag
(27 kDa). His-tagged proteins were eluted using a 250
mM imidazole-containing buffer. His-tag was removed by
incubation with enterokinase as recommended by the
manufacturer (Novagen).

Mutagenesis of the Hklep and Rrlep proteins
The hklep and rrlep genes of L. biflexa were cloned into the
spectinomycin-resistance conferring L. biflexa-E. coli shuttle vector pGSLEP [17] to generate pGSLhklep and pGSLrrlep, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of Hklep
(LEBBIa1423) and Rrlep (LEPBIa1422) was performed by
PCR amplification of pGSLhklep/pGSLrrlep or pEThklep/
pETrrlep vectors using oligonucleotide primer pairs carrying the mutations and Pwo polymerase (Roche). The chosen mutations consisted in replacing the histidine kinase
H98 and the response regulator D53 by an alanine leading to either pGSLhklep(H98A) and pEThklep(H98A) or
pGSLrrlep(D53A) and pETrrlep(D53A), respectively. The
periplasmic loop of the kinase protein (pGSLhklepΔ) was
replaced by using a two-steps overlap method. Region of
Hklep comprised from the amino acids F31 to S62 was
replaced by the sequence N-GSA SAG ASG SGA-C
(encoded by the underlined sequences of the primers, see
below). Nucleotides from 1 to 93 and from 186 to stop
codon were amplified separately with the following
primer pairs 5'-TGCAAACGAAGCTCCAGCGGAG-3'/5'tgctccagatccagatgctcctgcagatgcagatccCCCTAAAATCCACCACCAGAC-3' and 5'-ggatctgcatctgcaggagcatctggatctggagcaTTTTTCCTTTCGATGTTAACAC-3'/5'TGTTTTGGCCCACTCTACACGG-3', respectively, and Pfx
polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were then used as
templates to generate the full-length coding sequence.
Hklep protein was also restricted to its cytoplasmic
domain (Hklepc) and the truncated hklep gene (residues
90 to 300) was fused to L. interrogans hsp10 promoter
(pGSLPhklepc). The expression and in vivo stability of
Hklepc were confirmed by western blotting using anti-His
tag antibodies (data not shown).
Gene inactivation and complementation of L. biflexa
strains
A 6,000 mutant library of L. biflexa was generated by random transposon mutagenesis using Himar1 as previously
described [2]. The mutants were screened onto media
with and without 10 μM hemin and we identified the
mutants that were not able to grow without hemin. The
transposon insertion site was identified by LM-PCR as previously described [18]. Targeted gene inactivation in L.
biflexa was carried out as previously described [15]. The
recombinant vectors pGSLrrlep, pGSLhklep, pGSLrrlep(D53A), pGSLhklep(H98A), pGSLhklepΔ, and
pGSLPhklepc were used for functional complementation
of the L. biflexa mutant strains. L. interrogans serovar Lai
homologous genes (LB014 and LB015) were also cloned
into pGSLEP [17] and tested for complementation. All
plasmid constructs were checked by sequencing.
In vitro phosphorylation assays
Proteins were dialyzed against the phosphorylation buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/25

mM DTT, and 10 % glycerol). For autophosphorylation
assays, 4–6 μM of Hklep or Hklep(H98A) were incubated
with 0.4 μM ATP containing 20 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h 30
at room temperature. For phosphotransfer assays, 4–6 μM
of Rrlep or Rrlep(D53A) were added to Hklep. The reaction was further incubated for 5 min to 1 h and stopped
by SDS buffer. Proteins were then resolved on 12 % SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized using
Coomassie blue staining or X-ray autoradiography.
Sequence analysis and nucleotide sequence accession
number
The DNA sequence data were analyzed with BLAST [19],
SMART [20], and TMPRED [21] programs. The nucleotide
sequence of the locus containing the L. biflexa two-component signalling genes is deposited under accession
number EF577043.

Authors' contributions
