Abstract
Background: The functional sites of a protein present important information for determining its
cellular function and are fundamental in drug design. Accordingly, accurate methods for the
prediction of functional sites are of immense value. Most available methods are based on a set of
homologous sequences and structural or evolutionary information, and assume that functional sites
are more conserved than the average. In the analysis presented here, we have investigated the
conservation of location and type of amino acids at functional sites, and compared the behaviour
of functional sites between different protein domains.
Results: Functional sites were extracted from experimentally determined structural complexes
from the Protein Data Bank harbouring a conserved protein domain from the SMART database. In
general, functional (i.e. interacting) sites whose location is more highly conserved are also more
conserved in their type of amino acid. However, even highly conserved functional sites can present
a wide spectrum of amino acids. The degree of conservation strongly depends on the function of
the protein domain and ranges from highly conserved in location and amino acid to very variable.
Differentiation by binding partner shows that ion binding sites tend to be more conserved than
functional sites binding peptides or nucleotides.
Conclusion: The results gained by this analysis will help improve the accuracy of functional site
prediction and facilitate the characterization of unknown protein sequences.

Background
Protein function is determined by the spatial configuration and type of amino acids at functional sites. Knowledge of functional sites provides valuable information for
the assignment of molecular function, potential physiological binding partners and hence drug design. Tasks performed by functional sites range from the binding of
small molecules like ions, cofactors, metabolic substrates
or high molecular weight compounds such as nucleic

acids and peptide chains, to catalysing chemical reactions
in the active centre of enzymes.
The exponentially growing number of uncharacterised
protein sequences in the public databases has turned the
development of automatic identification of functional
sites into an important research field and many computational methods focusing on this area have been described
in recent years (for review see [1-3]). In contrast to

structural approaches that search for ligand binding pockets on the protein surface using molecular modelling
[4,5], network analysis [6], or compare the protein surface
to structures with known interacting sites [7,8], many
methods are based on a set of homologous sequences
combined with evolutionary or structural information.
The evolutionary trace (ET) method [9,10], for example,
searches for a structural cluster of conserved residues.
Beginning with a sequence identity tree from a set of
homologous proteins, the tree is scanned for subgroupspecific residues, which are invariant within the subgroup
but vary between subgroups. These residues, called evolutionary trace residues, and the residues that are invariant
in all sequences are then mapped onto a representative 3D
structure and clusters of high ranking residues, corresponding to the inner nodes of the tree, are searched.
These clusters usually coincide with the functional center
of the protein. Improvements of the ET method use
sequence weights based on their similarity (weighted evolutionary tracing) and an amino acid substitution matrix
to account for biochemically similar amino acids in the
identification of the trace residues [11], they consider the
evolutionary distance between proteins due to the phylogenetically biased databases [12] or allow different rates
of amino acid substitutions at protein sites [13]. A similar
approach is focusing more on structural information and
calculates a conservation score at each position under
consideration of the behaviour of spatial neighbours [14].
Most of the above mentioned methods assume that functional sites are under high selective pressure and conserved within the protein, so that functional sites can
easily be detected by lower rates of amino acid substitutions. However, functional sites can vary in subfamilies
and homologous protein sequences can perform different
functions using a different set of functional residues.
Accordingly, interaction interfaces can vary in their location in distant homologues and this has to be considered
if interaction interfaces are inferred from homologous
proteins [15,16].
Prior to their prediction, it is necessary to understand the
arrangement and properties of functional sites, as well as
how protein families and single sequences differ in their
use. Effort towards this direction has been made by several
groups, who studied physicochemical properties of protein-protein interaction interfaces found in homodimer,
heterodimer or intra-chain domain complexes [17-21], as
well as protein-DNA interaction interfaces [22].
Here, we perform a large-scale analysis of functional sites
extracted from experimentally determined protein-ligand
complexes stored in the protein data bank (PDB) [23],
grouped by the presence of conserved protein domains
described in the SMART database [24]. The classification

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/210

into protein families enables us to find differences in
amino acid conservation and use of specific locations for
functional sites between the families. The analysis shows
that domains vary strongly in the conservation of interacting sites and provides useful information for the prediction of interacting sites based on homologous protein
sequences.

Results and discussion
Our analysis of interacting sites is based on conserved protein domains found in the structures of the protein data
bank (PDB). Family sequence alignments of protein
domains were retrieved from the SMART database and
used to scan the protein sequences of the PDB with
domain-specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Wherever a domain was identified, all interactions between an
amino acid belonging to this domain and any ligand were
extracted and the position of the interacting amino acid
was transferred onto the HMM consensus.
Table 1 lists the number of sequences with ligand interactions extracted from PDB and the number of interacting
sites found in these sequences [see Additional file 1]. The
HMM consensus was used as a reference sequence to be
able to compare the location of interactions among different sequences of a domain family. The positions in the
consensus sequence correspond to positions shared by
most sequences of the domain family (match states) and
most domains interact only in regions for which an HMM
match state exists. In contrast, if the interacting position
corresponds to an insert state in the alignment to the
HMM consensus, the information of interaction could
not be transferred to the domain consensus. There are several domains, which have a comparatively large number
of interacting sites located in loop regions. These amino
acid sites are only present in subfamilies of the domain
and are lacking an HMM match state, so that mapping the
information of interaction onto the HMM was not possible. An overview of the number of interactions at HMM
insert states for all investigated protein domains is given
in table 1 [see Additional file 1]. In domains of the immunological system, e.g. the immunoglobulin (IG) and
immunoglobulin V type (IGv) domains, up to 50% of the
interacting sites are located in these regions. Strikingly,
other extra-cellular domains (fibronectin type 3 (FN3), Ctype lectin (CLECT), leucine rich repeat C-terminal
domain (LRRCT)) also present a large number of interacting sites in loop regions. These domains all have a common involvement in highly specific recognition processes,
where any restrictions in the choice of amino acid or structural constraints would be disadvantageous for the function of the domain. The loop regions without any match
states exactly fulfil this condition and therefore biochemical properties of the domain can be fine-tuned to complement the appearance of the ligand. The increased use of

Distribution of interaction scores
Distribution of interaction scores. The interaction score
reflects the importance of a functional sites in establishing an
interaction. Surprisingly, only few interacting sites are absolutely conserved in their location within the whole protein
family and characterized by high interaction scores. The
majority of interacting sites feature small interaction scores.
This shows that these sites are only used by a few sequences
of the domain family for establishing an interaction, which can
also be caused by the different nature of ligands.

variable loop regions for functional sites seems to be a
common characteristic of extracellular highly ligand-specific domains.
Conservation of location of interacting sites
In order to compare the use of specific interacting positions within a domain family we introduced a score (ConsInt) to measure the conservation of interaction at a given
site in the family alignment. The score reflects the importance of an amino acid site in domain interactions and
ranges between 0 and 1. Scores greater than 0 mean that
at least two non-identical sequences interact at this position, and a score of 1 arises if all sequences interact at this
position. For the comparison of the interaction scores and
amino acid conservation, we only calculated the score for
sites, where the interaction is achieved by atoms of the
amino acid side chain. These scores are generally smaller
than those calculated for side chain and backbone interactions, because side chain interactions are only part of the
total interactions and many sites are very flexible in the

The distribution of interaction scores is shown in figure 1.
It is remarkable that there are only a few positions in all of
the investigated domains with the maximum interaction
score. Smaller interaction scores can emerge from the use
of ligands with distinct functions in the PDB data, for
example, if a domain is in complex with its native substrate or another time with a regulatory protein that binds
to a remote part of the domain. Absence of the substrate
in the latter case leads to lower interaction scores for
important functional sites: even medium interaction
scores can indicate significant interactions. A large proportion of amino acid sites have very low interaction scores,
presenting sites that are only occasionally involved in
interactions or that are specific to a subgroup. Subgroups
tend to use the same functional positions, while the functional sites can vary between subgroups. This behaviour is
also reflected in the distance trees of the domains. The carbohydrate binding RICIN domain in figure 2 exemplifies
the divergence of functional sites within a domain family.
By inspecting the arrangement of functional sites in the
different RICIN sequences, the RICIN family can be
divided into three main subgroups of distinct functions.
While one subgroup possesses two carbohydrate binding
sites and a peptide binding region (group II in figure 2),
one subgroup is limited to the N-terminal carbohydrate
binding region (group I) and one to the C-terminal carbohydrate binding region (group III). Absence of a carbohydrate binding site in the first or third group is unlikely to
be an artefact of the crystallization process, since the
domains were crystallized in complex with an adjacent
sugar bound domain. The classification observed by the
interaction profile is also reflected in the cladogram given
to the left of the interaction profile. Interestingly, the subgroups that preserved only one of the carbohydrate binding sites originate from proteins with tandem RICIN
domains, which arose from gene duplications [25], so
that the proteins are again provided with two carbohydrate binding sites. A single RICIN domain can be divided
into three subunits of approximately 40 amino acids in
lengths that have evolved from an ancient galactose binding peptide [26]. These subunits represent the differently
specialized binding sites in the domain family. In proteins
carrying two RICIN domains, only the first subunit of the
first RICIN domain and the last subunit of the second
RICIN domain preserved their ability to bind carbohydrates, while one subunit has specialized on binding peptides (subgroup II in figure 2). The RICIN domain is a
good example how homologous sequences belonging to
different subfamilies of a domain specialized on binding
different ligands and thus, on various functions. The func-

glycosylation site, but do not specifically interact with saccharides. The unrooted tree reflects the classification into three main
subgroups with different interaction sites. Group II harbours two sugar-binding sites, group I and III originate from tandem
RICIN domains, in which group I preserved the N-terminal sugar-binding site and group III the carboxy-terminal binding site.

tional sites are no longer conserved throughout the whole
family and they could not be inferred from homologous
sequences. However, functional sites can be predicted, if
the information is taken from the most closely related
sequences.
Alternating locations of functional sites are especially
prominent in DNA binding domains, like the C2H2-zinc
finder and homeodomains [22]. Another example is the
high mobility group (HMG) domain, which is shown in
complex with its target DNA in figure 3. Here, an amino
acid side chain pointing into the DNA helix recognizes the
DNA bases of the target sequence. This key position is
located in the loop connecting the first and second alpha
helix of the domain. The contact is carried out by a serine

residue in figure 3a (pdb id: 1hry[27]). In contrast, a phenylalanine establishes the contact in figure 3b (pdb id:
1ckt[28]) and the serine residue corresponding to the
structure shown in 3a is pointing away from the DNA
helix. In the sequence alignment, these two key positions
are located adjacent to each other. Many other domains
show this variability in the location of interacting amino
acid residues and profit from the flexibility to fine-tune
substrate specific binding sites based on the same structurally conserved protein fold.
Amino acid conservation of interacting sites
Having observed great differences in the location of interacting sites within conserved domains, the question arises
how these sites behave with regard to their amino acid

conservation. It is generally believed that interacting sites
are more highly conserved than non-interacting solventassessable sites. However, about one third of all interactions in our analysis were achieved by backbone atoms
only, so that the kind of amino acid has no direct effect on
the interaction. For the remaining two thirds, which
account for side chain interactions, we calculated a score
for the conservation of amino acid similar to the interaction score ConsInt. We next compared the relative frequency distribution of the amino acid conservation score
of interacting sites with the one of non-interacting sites,
which are composed of amino acids located in the core of
the domain as well as non-interacting surface residues.
The distribution of interacting sites is slightly shifted to
higher amino acid conservation scores (figure 4). This
shift is clearly visible and is statistically significant (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test: p-value < 2, 2 ×10-16), although
the data have not been restricted to surface residues. Our
finding that interacting sites are more highly conserved,
on average, is in accordance with the results of other
groups who reported that domain-domain interfaces are
better conserved than the rest of the surface residues [29].
Strikingly, there are many interacting sites with very low
amino acid conservation scores. A possible explanation
could be that very few residues of the interaction interface
are important for a stable interaction and conserved in
their amino acid. It has been shown that only a subset of
interface residues contribute a crucial part to the binding
energy, while residues around these so-called hot spots are

less conserved [30,31]. Another explanation could be the
increased specificity for various ligands. The data set contains orthologous sequences, which might be conserved
in function and substrate specificity and paralogous
sequences, which might have accumulated mutations
throughout evolution and adopted new substrate
specificity. The zinc finger domain, for example, interacts
mainly through an aromatic residue with the nucleic acid,
but specificity is provided by a nearby position, which can
vary in its amino acid and is also interacting with the bases
of the nucleic acid (figure 5). Hence, the variety of amino
acids at functional sites could be advantageous to recognize numerous different ligands by the same domain
family.
Correlation of interaction and amino acid conservation
In order to test whether often-used interacting sites coincide with highly conserved sites we plotted the interaction
score against the amino acid conservation score (figure 6).
Since our dataset includes various ligands, which might
have different preferences in terms of the amino acid conservation or interaction, we divided the data by the type of
ligand. Groups analyzed correspond to peptides, nucleotides, ions and all ligands, including those, which could

not be classified into one of the prior groups. Statistical
analysis detected a significant positive correlation
between the interaction score and its amino acid conservation in all observed groups (see figure 6 for details). The
trend to higher interaction scores with increasing amino
acid conservation is clearly visible if the data are divided
into groups and the median calculated for each group. The
median values of ion binding sites are shifted to higher
amino acid conservation scores compared to the other
three ligand groups, indicating that ion binding sites are
more highly conserved than sites binding peptides, nucleotides or other small molecules. The highest median interaction scores are found in the group of nucleotide ligands,
consequently nucleotide binding sites preferentially use
the equivalent positions in homologous sequences. Interestingly, sites interacting with peptides are not less conserved in their amino acids but are more flexible in the
location of interaction compared to nucleotides. An unexpected finding is the great variance of amino acid conservation scores for high interaction scores, especially in the
nucleotide and peptide group. This indicates that these
interacting sites are very flexible in the type of amino acid
and specialized to complement the ligand and to increase
specificity of the protein-ligand interaction.

Conclusion
Our analysis reveals that functional sites can be highly variable in their amino acid conservation and very flexible in
using various locations in the protein domain. The properties of functional sites are dependent on the protein
family and can vary from highly conserved, as observed in
enzymes involved in DNA replication, to protein families
that are highly variable with various amino acids at various locations, as for example immunoglobulins or carbo-

hydrate-binding domains. Similar results were obtained
by other groups. Pachenko and co-workers analyzed 86
domains from the CDD database and report that functional sites of homologous sequences can greatly differ in
their physicochemical properties and their location in the
three-dimensional structure [32]. Variability in functional
sites was also described by Devos and Valencia. By comparing the conservation of binding sites in structural
alignments, they found high conservation in diverged
sequences contrasting highly similar sequences with different interacting sites [33]. Our findings present valuable
information for the improvement of methods to predict
functional sites. In most of these methods, the prediction
is based on a set of homologous sequences. This approach
results only in reliable predictions if the investigated protein family is conserved in most of the functional sites.
Approaches to improve the accuracy of prediction have
been made recently by using orthologous proteins with
presumably the same ligand specificity [34] or by sub-typing protein families [35]. With the growing number of
sequences within protein families, trends that consider
variability of functional sites and use subgrouping aided
by experimental information might become widely
accepted in the future and promise to be successful in the
prediction of functional sites.

Methods
Data set
The analysis is based on the October version of PDB
(27969 structures). All protein sequences extracted from
PDB files were scanned against all SMART domains (667)
using hmmsearch from the HMMER package (version
2.3.2) [36]. Profile HMMs were retrieved from the SMART
family alignments and score thresholds were used as
assigned by SMART for each individual domain [37]. The
search resulted in 8747 protein structures containing at
least one of 480 SMART domains. For those structures
containing a protein-ligand interaction, we calculated the
distance for each atom of all protein compounds to each
atom of all ligands. We considered amino acids as
interacting if the distance of any atom of the amino acid
to any atom of the ligand was smaller than 4 Angstrom,
which is a very conservative threshold and is in the range
of the two oxygen atoms in a hydrogen bond. Interactions
to water molecules were neglected, as well as interactions
between identical chains, because homodimers can
present artefacts arising from the crystallization process.
We are aware of losing information about naturally occurring homodimers. If more than one model of the protein
structure exists, for example in the case of NMR data, all
models were taken into account and a position was
treated as interacting if more than 50% of all models harbour an interaction at this position. For each domain family, a multiple sequence alignment was generated from the
sequences identified in the PDB scan for SMART domains.

The alignments were created with hmmalign (HMMER
package), according to the SMART profile HMMs.
Distance trees were created with PROTDIST and FITCH,
both from the Phylip package [38].
A problem with using the protein data bank is the overrepresentation of some proteins, while others are completely absent. To deal with the biased nature of the
database, we used sequence weights, correlated to the evolutionary distance between the sequences. The distance is
small for similar sequences, so that these proteins are
weighted with a negligible small factor. Although many
proteins are redundant in our dataset it is advantageous to
consider all proteins because they can be bound to different ligands or the complex crystallized under different
conditions. The most important interacting sites should
clearly stand out in the large scale analysis.
Ligands interacting with protein domains were, wherever
possible, classified into groups of peptides, nucleotides or
ions. The group of ions was restricted to small ions and
excluded typical buffer anions. The groups of peptides
and nucleotides also included modified molecules that
are functionally alike. We also analysed all ligands
together, including carbohydrates, buffer ions and other
small molecules.
Calculation of scores
For each alignment position consistent with the HMM
consensus sequence, we calculated a position-specific
interaction conservation score (ConsInt) to describe how
well a position is conserved in ligand interactions within
the domain family.

noticeably higher scores. The score takes into account the
phylogenetic distances between the sequences so that
highly similar sequences are weighted more weakly, in
contrast to interacting sites in divergent sequences, which
are weighted more strongly.
Similar to the interaction score, a position specific amino
acid conservation score (ConsAA) was calculated.

on the VTML 160 substitution matrix [39]. The conservation score was normalized between 0 (low aa conservation) and 1 (high aa conservation) ranging from the
lowest to the highest score of the amino acid substitution
matrix. It is important to note that our amino acid conservation scores do not describe protein families as found in
the SMART database, but only the data set used in our
analysis, so that the amino acid conservation score can be
compared with the interaction conservation score for each
position in the family alignment.
The software suite R was used for the statistical analyses
[40]. The concentration of data points on vertical lines
found for higher amino acid conservation scores in the
scatter plots of figure 6 are an effect of the discrete values
of the amino acid substitution matrix and the few substitutions at conserved sites.

where N is the number of sequences in the alignment,
Dist(seqa, seqb) is the phylogenetic distance between
sequence a and b obtained from the phylogenetic tree and
Inti takes a value of 1 if sequence a and b both interact at
position i, and 0 otherwise. The score ranges from 0 to 1
and is 1 if all sequences interact at the position of interest.
To obtain a score greater than 0 for a certain position at
least two non-identical sequences have to interact at this
position. In this way, interactions to non-physiological
ligands like artificially synthesized peptides should be
lost, and important interacting positions should have

Table 1 – Interacting sites in protein domains For each domain, the
number of domains with ligand interactions extracted from PDB (#
PDB), the number of interacting sites corresponding to HMM match
states (int sites), the number of interacting sites corresponding to HMM
insert states (loop sites), the percentage of insert state interacting sites
from the total number of interacting sites (% loop) and the number of
interacting sites in the domain consensus (domain int sites) are given. The
last column considers conserved positions in the domain consensus
sequence, while all other columns count sites in sequences belonging to the
domain family. The number of conserved interacting sites (domain int
sites) can be 0 despite plenty of interacting sites in family sequences if the
site-specific interaction score does not yield a positive value due to identical
sequences. Abbreviations of domain names are according to SMART [24].
