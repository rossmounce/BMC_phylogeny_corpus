Abstract
Background: Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is endemic in western China, resulting in important public health
problem. It is essential to evaluate the prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection for designing control
policy. In the present study we report for the first time prevalence of Leishmania infection in dogs living in
Jiuzhaigou County (Sichuan Provence, China), which is not only an important endemic area of CanL but also a
tourism scenic spot, detected by PCR, ELISA and dipstick test. The results could provide key information for
designing control programs against canine and human leishmaniasis. In addition, the complete sequence of the
Leishmania isolate from Sichuan Province has not been reported to date and we present the sequences of 116
base-pair (bp) fragment of the conserved region in the minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the results of
phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of the amplified fragment.
Results: The proportion of dogs infected with Leishmania in Jiuzhaigou County was 36.79%, 9.43%, and 51.88%
detected by ELISA, dipstick test, and PCR, respectively. The ELISA and PCR tests were more sensitive than dipstick
test. The PCR method is the most sensitive way to detect dogs infected with Leishmania parasites. The total
positive rate for infected dogs in the area was 59.43% by the three methods. The PCR products of 116-bp
fragment amplified from the kDNA conserved region of dog blood samples and laboratory maintained L. infantum
were DNA sequenced and the variation of the sequences was observed. The phylogenetic tree based on the
sequences of 116-bp fragment reveals that L. infantum is more genetically related to visceralizing species L.
donovani than to the Leishmania species associated with cutaneous disease.
Conclusions: More than half of dogs living in the endemic Jiuzhaigou County were infected by L. infantum.
Control measures, such as treatment or eradication of infected dogs, or prohibition of maintaining dogs, must be
taken against these infected dogs due to their role in the transmission of the infection to vectors. The
phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of conserved region in kDNA of Leishmania can effectively distinguish
species of Leishmania.

Background
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe vector-borne
parasitic disease of humans and other mammals caused
by protozoa of the Leishmania donovani complex [1,2].
The disease is endemic in 61 countries and is responsible for the annual loss of an estimated 1.81 million

disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) and 57,000 lives
[3].Clinically and epidemiologically, there are two main
forms: zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) and anthroponotic visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) [4]. ZVL, caused by
L. infantum or Leishmania chagasi, is mainly distributed
in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America [5-9]. In
most of those regions, canine infection with L. infantum
is the cause of disease in dogs and as a reservoir for
human VL. Accurate and rapid detection of CanL is of
great importance to prevent transmission to humans.
Clinical diagnosis of CanL is difficult due to its variable
symptomatology [10,11] and that it is usually

asymptomatic at the early stage of infection [12]. Identification of the infected dogs in endemic areas has major
public health implications. It was demonstrated that not
only symptomatic dogs but also asymptomatically
infected dogs were the sources of the parasite for vector
sandflies and as a consequence play an active role in the
transmission of Leishmania to humans [13-17]. Thus,
the evaluation of the prevalence of canine Leishmania
infection in endemic areas is very important for the epidemiological study and control of leishmaniasis.
VL is still an important public health problem in
China and is currently endemic or re-emerging in more
than 50 counties in six provinces or autonomous
regions in western China including Xinjiang, Gansu,
Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia [18-22].
Among them, Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Shanxi are
ZVL endemic areas with dogs as a major reservoir host.
In these areas CanL is caused by L. infantum infection
and transmitted by wild Phlebotomus chinensis. The
elimination of domestic dogs in endemic areas dramatically reduced the human VL cases, confirming the
infected dogs are the major source of the human infection [19]. The data from National Diseases Reporting
Information System (NDRIS) operated by the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)
[23] revealed that human VL cases increased continuously in these endemic areas during the past years. Lack
of information about CanL prevalence in these endemic
areas makes it unclear whether the dog infection is
blamed to the re-emerge of the disease in the areas of
western China. Therefore, determination of canine
Leishmania infection is important to understand the
transmission and to the control of leishmaniasis in the
endemic areas.
Serological antibody tesst and PCR detection have
been extensively used to investigate canine infection
with L. infantum [24-28]. Some studies demonstrated
that PCR method was more sensitive and specific than
parasitological and serological methods [29-31]. Jiuzhagou County of Sichuan Province is not only an important CanL endemic area but also a famous tourism
resort. The prevalence of CanL has never been investigated in this area. In this study we investigated the prevalence of Leishmania infection in dogs in this county
by using PCR detection compared with serological tests.
A 116-bp fragment of minicircle kDNA conserved
region of different Leishmania species was amplified
from infected dog blood samples with primers K13AK13B [32,33] and the PCR products were DNA
sequenced. The DNA sequences of this fragment isolated from dogs in this county were compared with the
reported sequences of L. infantum and other Leishmania species isolated from other regions.

Materials and methods
Study site

The study was carried out in the Jiuzhaigou County,
Sichuan Province, an endemic area of CanL. The county
(32°53’ ~ 33°32’ N, 103°27’ ~ 104°26’E) is located in
mountainous area of Sichuan in southwestern China
(Figure 1). It has a annual mean temperature of 7.3°C
and varied from 16.8°C in the summer to -3.7°C in the
winter, with a mean annual rainfall of 700~800 mm.
The capital town of the county and several adjacent
townships have an altitude of 1,140~2,000 meters above
sea level and are visceral leishmaniasis endemic areas
with dogs as major hosts. In recent years, about 20
human VL cases were reported per year, and the incidence rate was about 1/2,000.
Animals and sampling

The protocol for sampling had been reviewed and
approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the
National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention in hanghai. Oral
informed consent was obtained from the owners of
dogs. About 2,000 dogs lived in VL endemic area of
Jiuzhaigou County. For the sample calculation, the formula applied was n = p (1-p) (1.96/D)2 = 97 dogs, with

a 10% error level and a confidence level of 95%, where p
= 50%. This is estimated based on investigations carried
out in other parts of world [25-31]. Based on the calculation 106 household dogs from different breeds were
randomly collected in present study at the capital town
of the county and adjacent villages in May of 2010. All
tested dogs were older than 7-months (going through at
least one sandfly season during May to September) and
examined for clinical signs of the disease, including dermatological lesions, ocular changes, weight loss, apathy,
lymph node, and spleen enlargement. Five ml of blood
samples were taken from the foreleg vein of each dog in
EDTA-coated polypropylene tubes for isolating parasite
DNA for PCR test, and 2 ml of the blood sample was
taken for separating sera for the detection of specific
antibodies to Leishmania. Whole blood and sera were
stored at -80°C.
Dipstick test

The dipstick test, recombinant k39 antigen-based immunochromatographic strip test to detect anti-Leishmania
antibody (the Kalazar Detect, batch JL1019; InBios, Seattle, WA), was carried out in the field according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
ELISA

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
performed as previously described [24] by using cultured
L. infantum (MCAN/CN/90/SC) promastigote antigen
coating microtiter plates. Sera collected from 23 uninfected dogs with L. infantum in the endemic area were
tested for cutoff of IgG-specific ELISA determinations
(mean plus 3 standard deviations).The sera from two
sick dogs with confirmed L. infantum infection were
used as the positive control.

dATTTTACACCAACCCCCAGTT-3’) described by
Rodgers et al. [30] were used to amplify a 116-bp of
fragment in the conserved region of Leishmania kDNA
minicircles. The primers were synthesized by Shanghai
Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Service
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). PCR amplification was carried out as described previously [34] by using Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega) and the extracted DNA samples
as templates. A positive control containing 10 ng of
genomic L..infantum (MCAN/CN/90/SC) DNA, and a
negative control without template DNA were included.
PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis through
2% agarose gels.
Cloning and sequencing of 116-bp fragment

The PCR products of 116-bp fragment are too short for
sequencing directly and thus cloned into pGEM-T vector using a TA cloning kit (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instruction. The recombinant plasmid was
sequenced with vector flanking primers T7/SP6 by
Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology &
Service Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses

DNA sequences were analyzed using GENEDOC (Free
Software Foundation, Inc. Boston, USA) and aligned
using Clustal X [35]. The phylogenetic relationship of
the amplified fragments from endemic dog samples and
the 116-bp sequences from different species of Leishmania deposited in GenBank was built-up with MEGA version 4.0 [36] and UPGMA [37]. Evolutionary distances
were calculated using the method proposed by Jukes
and Cantor [38]. Bootstrap analysis [39] was performed
with 1000 replicates.
Statistical analysis

DNA extraction
(i) Cultured parasite

The Leishmania isolate MCAN/CN/90/SC was originally
obtained from a dog with leishmaniasis in Sichuan Province and maintained in our laboratory. The parasite
was grown in NNN medium at 24°C for 18 days. DNA
extraction from cultured parasite was carried out as
described by Reale et al [26].
(ii) Dog blood

The DNA was extracted from dog blood samples using E.
Z.N.A. SQ Blood DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tech, Inc.) according to manufacturer’s instruction. The extracted DNA was
washed with 70% ethanol (vol/vol), and suspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0).
DNA amplification by PCR

Leishmania genus-specific oligonucleotide primers K13A
(5’-dGTGG GGGAGGGGCGTTCT-3’) and K13B (5’-

Since true-negative values detected by each test were
unknown, in the present study the sensitivity of each
test was defined against the total number of samples
positive with at least one method following the method
described by Lachaud L et al. [40].
Epi Info Tm 6.0 (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used
for data statistical analysis by the X2 test for the comparison between PCR, ELISA, and dipstick in the detection of CanL.

Results
Serological and PCR detection results

A total of 106 dogs, which went through at least one
sandfly season, were chosen for serological tests and
PCR detection. Six out of 106 (5.66%) dogs presented
one or more clinical signs of CanL while other 100 dogs
were asymptomatic (94.34%). Results for clinical status,
serology (including ELISA and dipstick test), and PCR

detection are shown in Table 1. Only five dogs were
positive demonstrated by all methods in which three of
them showed clinical signs. Thirty-nine of the dogs
were positive by ELISA with five of them showed clinical signs. One dog with clinical signs of leishmaniasis
was negative by ELISA. Ten of the dogs were positive
by dipstick test in which only three of them showed
clinical signs. The presence of parasite DNA was
detected in 55 dogs, all six dogs showing clinical signs
showed positive for parasite DNA.
The sensitivity of each technique was calculated using
the total number of samples positive with at lease one
method [38]. Thus, the sensitivities of PCR, ELISA, and
dipstick test for detection of canine infection with Leishmania in the endemic area were 87.30% (55/63), 61.90%
(39/63) and 15.87% (10/63), respectively (Table 2). The
results showed that PCR detection was the most sensitive method compared to ELISA (p = 0.001) and dipstick (p < 0.001), and ELISA method was more sensitive
than dipstick test (p < 0.001).
DNA sequence and phylogenetic analyses

Twenty PCR products amplified from dog blood samples and one PCR product from cultured L. infantum
were subcloned into pGEM-T vector and 10 clones
from each PCR product were randomly picked for DNA
sequencing. Alignment of the obtained sequences
showed that amplified 116-bp sequences contained large
variations among the samples from dog blood or from
the cultured parasite. Based on the sequence variation
two classes of the sequence were divided. The main difference is that two stretches of sequence AAAA in Class
I were mutated to TTTT in Class II (Figure 2). Forty
more clones from cultured parasite DNA PCR products
were sequenced and the variation was confirmed with
80% of Class I and 20% of Class II.
The two classes of 116-bp fragment sequences isolated
from the conserved region of Leishmania kDNA minicircles from laboratory-maintained L. infantum MCAN/

CN/90/SC were submitted to GenBank (Bankit) (accession nos.: Class I: HQ585883; Class II: HQ585885). The
phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the
sequence comparison of class I 116-bp fragment of
Leishmania kDNA minicircles conserved region among
laboratory-maintained L. infantum MCAN/CN/90/SC
and other Leishmania species available in the GenBank
(Figure 3). As seen in shown in Figure 2, L. infantum
isolate MCAN/CN/90/SC used in this study was different from but closely related to the three other existing L
infantum isolates. However, L. donovani and L. infantum were linked in a grouping different from the Leishmanias associated with cutaneous disease.

Discussion
Currently, two epidemiological types of VL, anthroponotic (AVL) and zoonotic (ZVL), exist in western China
[19,41]. AVL is endemic only in the oases of the plains
of Kashi prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region. Most cases occur in juvenile and adult people.
ZVL can be divided into two subtypes, namely mountainous and desert sub-type [22]. The desert sub-type is
endemic in the northwestern desert regions of China,
including Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia [22].
These regions were uncultivated deserts for a long time

before being populated by immigrants who introduced
agricultural activities, consequently, autochthonous
infantile kala-azar occurs. This region is considered to
be a natural nidus of kala-azar-infected wild animals
that are presumably considered to be the source of
human infection. The wild species, Phlebotomus wui
and Phlebotomus alexandri, are the vectors infesting different specific landscapes, dry desert region and the
stony desert, respectively [22,41]. The mountainous subtype occurs in the western mountainous and hilly
regions of Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces of China. Patients are mostly children younger
than ten years old, and infants are commonly infected.
These patients are distributed sporadically. The vector
of this form is wild P. chinensis [22,41]. Elimination and
prohibition of dogs in the endemic area markedly
reduced the number of human cases, thus dogs are
likely the principal source of infection for the mountainous sub-type [18]. Therefore, evaluation of prevalence
of Leishmania infection in dogs is of great importance

to understand the epidemiology of the mountainous
sub-type of ZVL and to prevent transmission of human
VL. In this study we collected blood samples from dogs
in an endemic area of Jiuzhaigou County, China and
evaluated the prevalence of L. infantum infection in
these dogs using PCR, ELISA, and immunochromatographic dipstick tests.
According to our results, among 106 dogs studied, 6
(5.66%) dogs presented CanL signs and 100 (94.34%)
dogs were asymptomatic. The seroprevalence of dog
infection in Jiuzhaigou County is 36.79% by ELISA,
higher than those obtained by various authors throughout the Mediterranean basin [42-44]. However, the positive rate detected by dipstick test (9.43%) is much lower
than that detected by ELISA in this study. The highest
positive rate (51.88%) was found in the PCR detection
of parasitic DNA in the blood samples of dogs with significant higher than that of ELISA (p = 0.001) and dipstick (p < 0.001), indicating the PCR method is the most
sensitive to detect Leishmania infection in dogs. The
result is consistent with that found by other studies
[25,45,46].
In epidemiological studies on CanL, serological and
parasitic DNA detection are sensitive and specific to
detect Leishmania infection in dogs [24,25,31,42]. For
detection of symptomatic dogs, the two methods
obtained comparable sensitivity in this study, while in
detection of asymptomatic dogs PCR method was more
sensitive than serological methods. The probable reason
is that asymptomatic infection dogs may have low infective burden and therefore the lower levels of anti-Leishmania antibodies [47] while PCR can detect as few as a
single parasite theoretically. In this study, most of dogs
(94.34%) were asymptomatic, resulting in lower positive
rates detected by serological methods than that by PCR.
In addition, asymptomatic but seropositive dogs may
indicate previous contact with parasite with some of
these seropositive dogs being PCR-negative [42]. The
biopsy samples of lymph node, bone marrow, skin or
conjunctive were usually taken to detect Leishmania
infection by PCR and can yield excellent sensitivity
[40,42]. Lachaud L. et al demonstrated that PCR method

Wang et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:69

targeting kDNA (K13A-K13B) using peripheral blood
effectively detected the parasite in symptomatic or
asymptomatic infected dogs [48], while other study indicated that blood sample reduces the sensitivity of the
test [25]. However, the PCR test based on blood is
advantageous than tissues because blood sample can be
obtained safely and less invasively, and relatively easy to
process. In diagnosis of symptomatic dogs with leishmaniasis rk39 dipstick gave reliable results [49,50], however, our results demonstrated that the test is not
suitable to detect asymptomatic infection of dogs with
Leishmania. The probable reason is that k39 antigen is
only expressed during active infections [51,52].
The prevalence of Leishmania infection in dogs that
we found in Jiuzhaigou County is very high (total
59.43%), especially in asymptomatic dogs up to 57% (57/
100). Some studies indicated that asymptomaticlly
infected dogs with Leishmania were not infective to
sandflies [53,54], while some others demonstrated that
asymptomatically infected dogs were the sources of the
parasite for vector sandflies and as a consequence play
an active role in the transmission of L. infantum to
human [13-17]. The high prevalence of Leishmania
infection in dogs in regions where leishmaniasis is endemic has to be taken into account in any campaign aiming at controlling CanL. In fact, some authors have
demonstrated that removing seropositive dogs is an
insufficient method to eradicate CanL [55,56]. In this
study we found that Leishmania DNA could even be
detected in serologically negative dogs. These seronegative dogs are also possible sources of Leishmanial transmission. These data provide a better estimation of
transmission level of the parasite in the endemic area,
therefore are essential for designing and implementing
appropriate control measures.
The results of this study demonstrated that the amplification of 116-bp fragment in the conserved region of
Leishmania kDNA minicircles could be used for detection of parasite DNA in the blood samples of infected
dogs. The sequence data of the PCR products also
showed the significant diversity among the samples isolated from different dogs and from lab maintained strain
of L. infantum (MCAN/CN/90/SC). More than 20% of
the amplified 116-bp fragments showed two stretches of
sequence AAAA mutated to TTTT and therefore
named as Class II compared to the regular Class I type
with no mutations. Based on our findings and the findings of others [32,57], it suggests that a certain percentage of sequence divergence existed in the constant
region of the minicircle classes not only among species
but also within the species or even within the same
parasite. It could be due to recombination or mutation
events occurring in the kDNA molecules [43]. Based on
the divergence existing in the constant region of the

Page 6 of 8

minicircle classes among Leishmania spp., in this study
we constructed a phylogenetic tree revealing that L.
infantum isolate MCAN/CN/90/SC used in this study
was closely related to three other existing L infantum
isolates, and more genetically related to other visceralizing species such as L. donovani than to those Leishmania species associated with cutaneous disease. Therefore,
the sequence data of Leishmania kDNA minicircles
could possibly be used for distinguishing species or
strains of Leishmania. It is the plan to collect parasite
samples from different endemic areas of China to
genetically type the strains or isolates of L. infantum
based on the diversities of the Leishmania kDNA
minicircles

Conclusions
The results from present study demonstrated that more
than half of dogs living in endemic Jiuzhaigou County,
China, were infected by L. infantum. Control measures,
such as treatment or eradication of infected dogs or
prohibition of maintaining dogs, must be taken against
these infected dogs due to their role in the transmission
of the infection to vectors. The phylogenetic tree based
on sequences of Leishmania kDNA conserved region
provides useful way to distinguish Leishmania species.
