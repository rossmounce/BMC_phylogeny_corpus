Abstract
Background: Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and congeneric species are the most common
North American mammals. They represent an emerging system for the genetic analyses of the
physiological and behavioral bases of habitat adaptation. Phylogenetic evidence suggests a much
more ancient divergence of Peromyscus from laboratory mice (Mus) and rats (Rattus) than that
separating latter two. Nevertheless, early karyotypic analyses of the three groups suggest
Peromyscus to be exhibit greater similarities with Rattus than with Mus.
Results: Comparative linkage mapping of an estimated 35% of the deer mouse genome was done
with respect to the Rattus and Mus genomes. We particularly focused on regions that span synteny
breakpoint regions between the rat and mouse genomes. The linkage analysis revealed the
Peromyscus genome to have a higher degree of synteny and gene order conservation with the
Rattus genome.
Conclusion: These data suggest that: 1. the Rattus and Peromyscus genomes more closely
represent ancestral Muroid and rodent genomes than that of Mus. 2. the high level of genome
rearrangement observed in Muroid rodents is especially pronounced in Mus. 3. evolution of
genome organization can operate independently of more commonly assayed measures of genetic
change (e.g. SNP frequency).

Background
The cricetid genus Peromyscus constitutes the most abundant and speciose group of North American mammals.
Though superficially similar in appearance to rats and

mice, deer mice represent a more distantly related lineage.
Mouse and rat are thought to have diverged from each
other ~10–12 million years ago (mya) while they last
shared a common ancestor with the deer mouse (P. man-

iculatus) lineage ~25 mya [1]. The P. maniculatus species
complex is a series of semi-interfertile populations spanning nearly every habitat on the continent and is consequently an emerging tool for the study of natural
mammalian genetic variation. Facilitating such research is
the existence of captive stocks derived from individual
populations. Utilizing two of these stocks, we have developed a comparative genomic map for the deer mouse to
further research of this genus and to provide insight into
the genome rearrangements seen in rats, mice, and other
mammals.
Comparative genomic analyses can reveal substantial
amounts of information about the biology and evolution
of species and are one of the keys to deciphering the roles
that genomic structure and organization play in areas
such as development, gene expression, and speciation.
These analyses, however, are limited to portions of the
genomes that have been mapped in all the species being
compared and may be compromised by uncertainty of
gene orthology and order between any two species.
Although whole-genome sequences are available for
many species, proper genome annotation is difficult and
typically requires additional resources (e.g. meiotic linkage and radiation hybrid cell maps) [2]. As a result, both
cytogenetic methods and genetic linkage mapping are still
essential tools for the analysis of genomic organization.
While cytogenetic methods are effective for discerning
large regions of chromosomal homology and conserved
synteny, linkage maps are able to detect rearrangements of
gene order within these fragments and pinpoint the locations of synteny breakpoints. Such detailed genomic comparisons require ordered linkage maps that include
orthologous Type I (gene coding) loci to provide landmarks that can be identified in the genomes of multiple
species. Comparative analyses using such a combined
approach may reveal many more chromosomal rearrangements and novel synteny groups.
Two of the most complete mammalian genomic maps are
associated with the most used biomedical models, the rat
(Rattus norvegicus) and mouse (Mus musculus), which both
belong to the rodent family Muridae. Rodentia is the largest mammalian order, containing > 2000 of the ~4600
recognized species and the murids constitute the majority
of these [3]. Murid genomes analyzed to date not only
show more rapid nucleotide mutation rates [1,4] but also
higher rates of chromosomal rearrangement than other
mammals. Murid chromosomal divergence rates are estimated to be one rearrangement per million years; ten
times the rate for most mammalian genomes [5,6]. Furthermore, such events are punctuated over time rather
than having a steady-state mutation pattern [7]. This elevated rate of rearrangement has resulted in greater karyo-

typic divergence between rat and mouse than between
much more distantly related species (e.g., humans vs.
domestic cats) [8] and has hampered reconstructions of
ancestral rodent and mammalian genomes [9-12]. As a
result, interpreting the evolutionary trajectory of chromosome segments between these model organisms and
humans has proven difficult [13]. An outgroup to the two
mapped murid genomes that is less divergent than human
could alleviate these problems by aiding in the construction of a more accurate ancestral rodent genome.
Here we describe the initial results of the first intermediate-density comparative genomic map for the deer mouse
covering an estimated 35% of the deer mouse genome.
These data suggest the deer mouse genomic organization
more closely resembles that of rat than mouse, despite the
much more recent common ancestor shared by the latter
two species. Considered with cytogenetic data [14] and
ancestral karyotype reconstructions [10,12], our analysis
further suggests that the deer mouse and Rattus genomes
have undergone fewer large scale rearrangements than
Mus.

Results and Discussion
Design
We employed a standard backcross design for these studies utilizing P. maniculatus bairdii stock derived from
Washtenaw Co. MI (BW) and P. polionotus stock derived
from Ocala Nat'l forest in Florida (PO). While neither
population is completely inbred, both originated from a
limited number of founders and have been maintained as
closed colonies. Thus, identifying fixed differences
between the two (e.g., SNPs) was typically not difficult.

Map construction for P. maniculatus was conducted using
both the Rattus and Mus maps as references [15,16] and
using assays designed to span rat-mouse synteny breakpoints. We use the term breakpoint when referring to a
break between linkage groups as defined by Pevzner and
Tesler [13]. In all, we have genotyped 103 Type I gene
markers from 18 different Rattus chromosomes on our
backcross panels. Table 1 presents the complete list of
markers used in our mapping study, their respective locations in the mouse and rat genomes, and the source of the
primer sequences. The figures presented here though,
focus on the markers around the breakpoint regions
between Mus and Rattus genomes that are informative for
this comparative analysis.
Our backcross panels facilitated linkage of markers at distances ranging from 1.2 cM to 35.8 cM. There are a few
instances, however, where marker co-segregation occurs.
These may be due to recombination "cold-spots", segmental inversions between the BW and PO strains, or sim-

Mapping of loci from Rattus Chrs 10 and 14
Our previous analysis of the Peromyscus genome using loci
from Mus Chr 11 [17] indicated that there are two separate
deer mouse linkage groups. ZOO-FISH data by Mlynarski
et al. (submitted, BMC Evolutionary Biology) also supported this conclusion. These linkage groups correspond
to Rattus Chrs 10 and 14 and the resulting chromosomal
breakpoint is shared with the Rattus genome relative to
the Mus genome (Figure 1). This breakpoint is also shared
in other species, including human, chimpanzee, dog, and
pig [11,18]. This conserved similarity led us to consider
whether the deer mouse genome might share a higher
degree of chromosomal similarity with Rattus than to Mus.

To explore this possibility, we expanded the existing linkage groups using loci whose orthologs lie on Rattus Chrs
10 and 14 but are not located on Mus Chr 11 (Figure 1).
For the Rattus Chr 10 homology group, we generated
markers for Btbd12 and Gbl, which correspond to regions
of Mus Chr 16 and 17, respectively. Single loci for each
segment were sufficient because the Mus Chrs 16 and 17
segments are small and most of Rattus Chr 10 is homologous with Mus Chr 11. We found both markers to be
clearly linked to the terminal locus from Rattus Chr 10,
Xbp1, with very high LOD scores (>30) indicating rat
genome homology. However, all three markers co-segregated. At a distance of only 1.9 Mb in the Rattus genome,
these markers are likely to be closer in the deer mouse
than our panel is able to resolve.

ination of additional informative regions where synteny
breakpoints occur between the Mus and Rattus genomes.
While not comprehensive for every chromosome, this
strategy accelerated our examination of chromosome evolution for the deer mouse genome and helped determine
the best reference genome for future deer mouse genome
mapping.
Mapping the Informative Regions of Rattus Chr 1
We next chose markers that spanned Rattus Chr 1, focusing our efforts within the regions surrounding the breakpoints between Mus Chrs 7, 17, 10, and 19 (Figure 2).

their orthologous genes in Peromyscus. The break in the continuity of the Peromyscus linkage groups indicates a lack of
detectable linkage between the groups.

Using a similar strategy, we also expanded the Rattus Chr
14 homology group using two loci from Mus Chr 5 that
have orthologs on Rattus Chr 14, Afp and Hip2. Similar to
both Rattus and Mus genomes, Afp and Hip2 are linked in
the deer mouse at a distance of 33.6 cM (LOD = 4.4) (Figure 1). Similar only to the Rattus genome though, we
found linkage in the deer mouse between Hip2 and the
Mus Chr 11 marker Xbp1 at a distance of 19.0 cM (LOD =
11.1) (Figure 1). The marker intervals for this group were
larger than those of the Rattus Chr 10 markers and
allowed us to map 83.0 Mb (~82%) of Rattus Chr 14 in
the deer mouse with only a few markers. Our results again
show a greater similarity between Peromyscus genome
organization and the Rattus genome than either to the Mus
genome.
The high degree of Rattus genome similarity that we found
for these two deer mouse linkage groups warranted exam-

Within the Mus Chr 17 homology segment, we established linkage between Tcp10b and Pacrg at 3.6 cM and
between Pacrg and Mas1 at 2.3 cM with LOD scores of
19.4 and 21.8, respectively. These distances are concordant with those for both the Rattus and Mus genomes. We
had also previously shown linkage between Tcp10b and
Mas1 using the deer mouse radiation hybrid panel [17].
We then genotyped the Mus Chr 10 marker Plagl1 to test
for linkage to the Mus Ch17 markers and found Mas1 to
be linked at a distance of 21.2 cM (LOD = 7.1). This linkage conservation is again consistent with the Rattus
genome but not with Mus.
We next tested for linkage between the Mus Chr 17 and
Mus Chr 7 homology segments of Rattus Chr 1 and found
no linkage in Peromyscus between any Mus Chr 17 markers
and the Mus Chr 7 marker Usp29, which is only 17.8 Mb
away on Rattus Chr 1. We made no further efforts to
extend the Mus Chr 7 linkage group, as Usp29 is only 5.93
Mb from the centromeric end of Mus Chr 7 and additional
markers in this region were unlikely to yield a different
result. We also tested for linkage between the Mus Chr 17
marker Mas1 and the Mus Chr 7 markers Usp29 and Myod1
on a PO × PO/BW backcross panel. This was to ensure that
our negative linkage results were not a result of aberrant
interspecific chromosomal recombination in the BW ×
BW/PO panel. Again, Mas1 did not link to either locus.
The lack of linkage between Mus Chr 17 and Mus Chr 7
homology segments in the deer mouse genome constituted the first example of a common breakpoint between
the deer mouse and Mus genomes when compared to Rattus.

is also linked to a second Mus Chr 19 marker Prpf19 at a
distance 4.9 cM (LOD = 13.4 cM).
Overall, our data for Rattus Chr 1 loci show that the two
deer mouse linkage groups span two Mus genome breakpoints but only one Rattus genome breakpoint, which
shows a continued bias towards similarity with the Rattus
genome. Our results also imply that the Mus genome has
been more rearranged in this region.
Breakpoint Mapping of Rattus Chr 4 and Chr 6 Loci
To broaden the scope of the deer mouse map and help
reduce bias resulting from any localized phenomenon
such as segmental inversions, we acquired data for markers from multiple Rattus chromosomes. Rattus Chrs 4 and
6 were priority candidates because of the simple breakpoint arrangements and well-conserved gene orders
between Rattus and Mus.

Rattus Chr 4 is represented by the entirety of Mus Chr 6
and approximately 30 Mb of the centromeric end of Mus
Chr 5. To test for a conserved organization in the deer
mouse genome, we typed two markers from each side of
the breakpoint on our backcross panel (Figure 3). We

Although uninformative for our comparative rearrangement analyses, we established linkage homology in the
deer mouse for the large (~130 Mb) Mus Chr 7 section of
Rattus Chr 1 using five markers: Usp29, Q8C5Y2, Ube3a,
Rab6ip1, and H19. Althoughthe RIKEN cDNA marker
Q8C5Y2 has not been accurately mapped in either Rattus
or Mus, BLAST results indicated intervals between
Q8C5Y2 and Usp29 at 26.4 Mb for the Rattus genome and
37.3 Mb in the Mus genome. In support of our placement,
the Mus Chr 7/Rattus Chr 1 marker Ube3a co-segregated
with Q8C5Y2 in the deer mouse. Our data for these five
Mus Chr 7 markers showed high conservation of linkage
and gene order with both Rattus and Mus genomes (Figure
2) with LOD scores all well above the 3.0 threshold. Our
results for the Mus Chr 7 region were also concordant with
a previous study [19] from which we utilized two of the
same markers, Usp29 and H19.
We also found genome homology between Rattus and the
deer mouse genome by markers spanning the breakpoint
between the Mus Chr 7 and Chr 19 regions of Rattus Chr
1. The Mus Chr 7 marker H19 is linked to the Mus Chr 19

found the two Mus Chr 5 markers, Srpk2 and Sri, are
linked to each other at 1.2 cM (LOD = 22.0) and the two
Mus Chr 6 markers, Ccdc132 and 1700016G05Rik, are
linked to each other at a distance of 7.6 cM (LOD = 14.8).
Spanning the breakpoint, we found that Sri and Ccdc132
are linked to each other at a distance of 13.3 cM (LOD =
10.3). Overall, our results span about 30% of Rattus Chr 4
and show conservation of the Rattus gene order. However,
the linkage between Sri and Srpk2 was shorter than
expected and may be due to a recombination cold-spot,
an interspecific inversion, or a deletion.
Our mapping of Rattus Chr 6 loci consisted of ten markers: Sos1, Ppp1cb, Preb, Dnmt3a, Allc, 493504H06Rik, Pygl,
Clec14a, Pcnx, and 1700001K19Rik. These markers span
Mus chromosomes 17, 5, and 12 and our results yielded
two separate linkage groups (Figure 4). The deer mouse
linkage group homologous to the centromeric end of Rattus Chr 6 consists of five loci and represents three different
chromosomes in Mus. This group is conserved in both
synteny and gene order with the Rattus genome. From Mus
Chr 17, Sos1 is linked to the Mus Chr 5 marker Ppp1cb at a
distance of 11.0 cM (LOD = 12.6). Within the Mus Chr 5
segment, Ppp1cb is linked to Preb at a distance of 6.1 cM
(LOD = 16.8). A second Mus breakpoint is spanned by the
linkage between Preb and the Mus Chr 12 marker Dnmt3a
at a distance of 5.2 cM (LOD = 16.4). Also from Mus Chr
12, Allc represents the terminal marker and links to
Dnmt3a at an interval of 16.5 cM (LOD = 7.6).
The five remaining markers from Mus Chr 12 form a second linkage group in Peromyscus. Although synteny with
both Rattus Chr 6 and Mus Chr 12 is conserved, we discovered an inversion with respect to both Mus and Rattus
involving markers Clec14a and Pygl (Figure 4). Defining
this inversion, Pygl is linked to 493504H06Rik at a distance of 4.2 cM (LOD = 9.2) while Clecl4a is linked to the
more telomeric marker Pcnx at a distance of 18.2 cM
(LOD = 6.3). We also found that Clec14a and Pygl have
smaller distance interval at 1.3 cM (LOD = 21.2) than
would have been expected from the physical intervals in
Mus (11.9 Mb) and Rattus (13.4 Mb). Forming the end of
the linkage group, Pcnx was linked to 1700001K19Rik at a
distance of 25.3 cM (LOD = 3.9).
The spanning of two Mus genome breakpoints by the deer
mouse linkage groups again indicates a more Rattus-like
genome organization. However, the breakpoint between
the two Peromyscus linkage groups flanked by the two Mus
Chr 12 markers Allc and 493504H06Rik represents a
unique rearrangement that differs from both the Rattus
and Mus genomes. ZOO-FISH results from Mlynarski et
al. (submitted, BMC Evolutionary Biology) also concur
that Rattus Chr 6 is indeed represented by two separate
chromosomes in the deer mouse.

Mapping Loci from Mus Chr 1/Rattus Chrs 5, 9, and 13
To avoid possible bias towards finding only Rattus
genome similarity, we also selected markers to span Rattus
synteny breakpoints in relation to the Mus genome. This
involved markers that span approximately 89% of Mus
Chr 1 but are located separately in Rattus on Chrs 5, 9, and
13 (Figure 5). With exception of the Rattus Chr 9 marker
Col9a1, we found linkage between all of the markers
within their Rattus chromosome homology groups but
not between them, indicating a bias toward Rattus
genome similarity.

For the Rattus Chr 5 region, we detected non-segregating
linkage between Oprk and Tram in the deer mouse with a
strong LOD score of 20.8. To further investigate Rattus
genome homology, we employed a third Rattus Chr 5
marker, Ube2j1, which is located on Mus Chr 4. Consistent
with Rattus genome organization, Ube2j1 linked strongly
(LOD = 23.5) but without segregation to Oprk1 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/65

However, Col3a1 is surprisingly not linked to Col9a1,
which represents a deviation from the Rattus genome. To
confirm these results, we also tested Mut, a marker that is
closely linked to Col9a1 on Rattus Chr 9 (Figure 6). Mut is
located 7.13 Mb from Col9a1 on Rattus Chr 9 but in Mus
is located separately on Chr 17. Mut did not link to Col3a1
but did co-segregate with Col9a1 (LOD = 12.0), thus identifying a linkage similarity between the Rattus and deer
mouse genomes. The breakpoints present in the deer
mouse and Mus maps for this region are offset and may
represent breakpoint area re-usage and a rearrangement
hotspot [13]. However, more detailed mapping using
markers located between Col9a1 and Col3a1 on Rattus Chr
9 are needed to refine the breakpoint location. We discovered additional Rattus Chr 9 similarity using the marker
Lama, which represents a second and separate region of
Mus Chr 17 than that of Mut (Figure 6). We found Lama1
and Fn1 are linked in the deer mouse at a distance of 32.7
cM (LOD = 4.7).

Mapping Loci from Mus Chr 8/Rattus Chrs 16, 17, and 19
As another test of Peromyscus genome homology to Mus,
we performed an analysis using six loci from Mus Chr 8
that form two linkage groups in the Rattus genome (Figure
7). We selected markers in each group that are less than
20.Mb apart in the Rattus genome to facilitate deer mouse
linkage detection. Additionally, the two markers that
flank the breakpoint, 9130404H06Rik and Elmod2, are
about 16.0 Mb apart in Mus, which is well within the
range of our mapping panel.

As with the Mus Chr 1 analysis, we found linkage with
highly significant LOD scores but only within the individual Rattus chromosomal groups, not between them. For
the Rattus Chr 16 segment, Adam3 and Mtus1 are linked at
distance of 8.4 cM (LOD = 14.8) and Mtus1 is linked to

linked to the terminal marker 9130404D08Rik at a distance of 7.0 cM (LOD = 16.4). The two markers from Rattus Chr 19, Elmod2 and Pmfbp1, are linked 10.3 cM (LOD
= 12.5).
Based on suggestions from ZOO-FISH results (Mlynarski
et al., submitted BMC Evolutionary Biology), we also
examined an additional chromosomal segment for linkage. Representing Rattus Chr 17 and Mus Chr 2, Sec61a2
links to the Rattus Chr 19/Mus Chr 8 marker Pmfbp1 at a
distance of 30.1 cM (LOD = 3.7). This linkage indicates a
clear deviation from both the Rattus and Mus genomes by
the deer mouse genome and highlights the benefit of performing cytogenetic analyses in tandem with meiotic linkage mapping.
Linkage Testing of Mus Chrs 17, 5, and 13 Loci
We performed additional tests for Mus genome similarity
within the deer mouse using loci from Mus Chrs 17, 5, and
13 (Figures 8, 9, and 10). These results also came out negative for Mus genome similarity. Mus chromosomes 17
and 5 are two of the most rearranged chromosomes in the
Mus genome compared to the Rattus genome. Mus Chr 17
and has seven different regions representing five different
Rattus chromosomes (Figure 8) and Mus Chr 5 has four
major regions representing four Rattus chromosomes and
three very small segments representing three additional
Rattus chromosomes (Figure 9). Positive linkage results

and Mas1 (Figure 8).
We conducted a similar test for several markers from Mus
Chr 5 (Figure 9). Eleven markers representing five Rattus
chromosomes were tested for linkage. As in the Mus Chr
17 analysis, linkage was found only between markers
located on the same Rattus chromosomes.
Two Mus Chr 13 markers, Clptml1 and Spz, also failed to
show linkage despite being only about 19.6 Mb apart in
the Mus genome, thus further reinforcing the linkage
group disparities between the deer mouse and Mus
genomes. Clptml1 is located in Rattus Chr 1 and Spz1 is on
Rattus Chr 2 (Figure 10).

Conclusion

mouse would have been a strong indicator of Mus homology.

Genome Mapping and Genomic Evolution
Development and availability of multiple mapping tools
is essential for accurate and timely exploration of any species' genome. Three methods have already been employed
in mapping small portions of the deer mouse genome in
the form of cytogenetics [14,20], meiotic segregation analysis [17,21-25], and a whole-genome radiation hybrid cell
panel [17]. These tools are most powerful when used in
combination, as exemplified by Rowe et al. [2] for Mus
and by Menotti et al. [26] for the cat.

For Mus Chr 17, six markers (Tcp10b, Mas1, and Pacrg
from Rattus Chr 1; Gbl from Rattus Chr 10; Lama1 from
Rattus Chr 9; and Sos1 from Rattus Chr 6) were tested for
linkage in all possible arrangements despite having
already been assigned to other deer mouse linkage groups.
No linkage was found other than that which already

research, we tested whether the deer mouse genome displayed organizational homology to that of Mus musculus,
Rattus norvegicus, or a combination of both. Our results
indicate a large degree of gene order and synteny conservation by the deer mouse genome with that of Rattus.
Our analysis was done by establishing linkage over
approximately 35% of the deer mouse genome using gene
markers that predominantly spanned junctions of largescale genome rearrangements between the Rattus and Mus
genomes. While using the Rattus genome as the reference,
we tested 13 Mus genome breakpoints. Ten of the 13
breakpoints spanned by the Rattus genome were similarly
linked in the deer mouse genome. In contrast, only one of
12 Rattus genome breakpoints that we examined while
using the Mus genome as a reference closely coincided
with any linkage breakpoints that we found in deer mouse
genome. These data demonstrate that the organization of
the deer mouse and Rattus genomes are more similar to
each other than either is to Mus.
There are three instances, however, where the deer mouse
map differs from both the Rattus and Mus maps. Two
examples are located between markers Allc and
493504H06Rik (Figure 4) and between markers Col9a1
and Col3a1 (Figure 6). Approximately 21 Mb separates the
latter pair in both Rattus and Mus, so additional markers
will need to be applied to the deer mouse panel to better
pinpoint the location of this breakpoint. The third
instance is the unique deer mouse linkage of Sec61a2 to
Pmfbp1. Collaborative efforts have also helped to inform,
as well as confirm, some of these data using additional
tools such as ZOO-FISH analyses using flow-sorted whole
chromosome probes (Mlynarski et al., submitted BMC
Evolutionary Biology). The strong organizational similarity of the deer mouse genome with the Rattus genome
rather than the more morphologically similar Mus musculus suggests that a significant amount of rearrangement
occurred in the Mus genome after the divergence of the cricetid and murid lineages. Concomitantly, our results suggest that the genomic organizations of Rattus and
Peromyscus are more representative of the ancestral
muroid genome than the Mus genome, which is in agreement with previous literature that indicated a higher rate
of genome rearrangement for Mus [5,6]. Most eutherian
genomes have 30 to 40 blocks of homology with the
human genome while the Mus genome is extraordinary
with approximately 200 homology blocks. However, the
Mus genome is not unique in having higher relative rearrangement rates, as the canine and gibbon genomes have
approximately twice the average number of homology
blocks [27].
Our results also show that genome rearrangement can act
independently from other forms of genome evolution,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/65

such as sequence mutation. Although rodent sequence
mutation rates are higher compared to other mammals,
such measurements of genome evolution show Mus and
Rattus shared a common ancestor significantly more
recently than either have with Peromyscus. Our data does
not propose to change this phylogeny but rather merely
highlights that DNA sequence variation and chromosome
rearrangement are independent processes and greater
understanding of both processes can provide different
insights into the evolution of the structure and function of
the eukaryotic genome.

Methods
Development of a P. maniculatus Backcross Panel
We chose interspecific backcross analysis in order to maximize genetic polymorphism and for the ease of linkage
analysis [28]. The two species used in the cross were the
deer mouse (P. maniculatus bairdii; BW) and the old field
mouse (P. polionotus subgriseus; PO) and were obtained
from the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the University
of South Carolina [29]. We set up the initial crosses in
only one direction, BW females × PO males, to generate
interspecific hybrid F1's. The direction of this cross is
essential, as the reciprocal cross results in lethal overgrowth of the offspring [30].

We created two separate backcross panels, BX116 and
BX2, for the linkage analysis. For the BX116 panel, we
bred twelve hybrid (plt BW × PO) F1 animals with 12
unrelated plt BW animals to generate 116 backcross progeny. Backcrosses to BW can be performed using both
female and male F1 hybrid animals, as both matings will
give viable offspring. However, all but one of the matings
used for this panel were F1 × BW (Ǩ × ǩ).
We used a similar strategy for the BX2 panel but the plt BW
stock was substituted with wild-type BW stock. The plt
allele originated in a different subspecies of P. maniculatus
than the BW stock to which it was crossed. This additional
backcross panel was designed to circumvent intraspecific
SNP variation and possible recombination problems due
to chromosomal inversions that are known to exist within
some P. maniculatus sub-species.
To create the BX2 panel, we crossed four F1 males from
separate unrelated Ǩ BW × ǩ PO matings to non-sibling
BW females, which were generated from separate matings.
This resulted in four unrelated backcross families. We
obtained twenty-two Ǩ BW × ǩ F1 offspring from each of
three of these backcross matings and 20 offspring were
obtained from the fourth for a total of 86 backcross animals. These were grouped in a 96-well tray along with the
eight parentals and a positive and a negative control. We
employed this strategy to minimize variation within families while maximizing information between families.

Page 11 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:65

Similarly, the strategy of crossing F1 hybrid males with
BW females minimized variation due to gender-based differences in recombination frequency.
We extracted genomic DNA from all backcross parents
and progeny for the BX116 panel from 1.0 cm tail snips
with the Qiagen DNEasy Tissue Kit using the manufacturers protocol (Qiagen, Inc.). Genomic DNA for the BX2
panel animals was extracted using a phenol/chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol extraction method to increase yields.
Marker Development
We obtained primer sequences for some Type I markers
from published sets of orthologous gene markers. These
are termed UMPS, CATS, and TOASTs [31-33]. Primer
sequences for Il23a, Mas1, H19, Sos1, and Grb10 were
developed or obtained from published Peromyscus data
[34-36]. Trp53 primers were developed from P. maniculatus sequence and were kindly provided by Michael
McLachlan. We developed all other primers from P. maniculatus EST sequences (Weston Glenn et al., submitted
BMC Genomics). Deer mouse EST clones were used for
marker design because of greater PCR amplification success (>80% versus ~60% for the published sets).

We designed all the markers to be ~400 bp–1500 bp and
to span an intron to increase polymorphism detection.
This was done by aligning deer mouse DNA sequences to
Mus musculus genomic sequences using cross-species
megaBLAST (NCBI). Some critical markers however,
spanned larger introns and resulted in amplicons slightly
larger than the ideal size parameters.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/65

markers, Sparc, Xbp1, Grb10, and Ugp2 required 2.0 mM
MgCl2.
For all markers, 5 μL of each amplification product was
visualized by gel electrophoresis. The remaining 5 μL portion of the PCR products was treated for sequencing with
5 units Exonuclease I and 0.75 units Shrimp Alkaline
Phosphatase (SAP) and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes
followed by heat-inactivation at 80°C for 15 minutes. For
sequencing reactions, 2.0μL of purified PCR product was
direct sequenced with BigDye (v3.1) (ABI) on an ABI
3130 × l according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Sequence identities were verified by cross-species megaBLAST or BLASTN search to the Mus musculus genome. Any
predicted simple size polymorphisms between BW and
PO were tested by gel electrophoresis using amplification
products from BW, PO, and BW/PO mix (equal ratio)
DNAs. Markers not showing size polymorphisms were
further analyzed for species-specific RFLPs by sequence
comparison using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation), the TCAG program available as part of the Biology Workbench software utilities provided at the San
Diego Supercomputer Center [37], or with the SNP-RFLPing program [38]. Candidate enzymes were chosen from
those predicted by the software. RFLP tests for each
marker and enzyme were conducted according to manufacturer's protocols on 10 μL PCR products from a template test panel consisting of DNA from BW, PO, a BW/PO
mix (equal ratio), and a negative using only TE. All RFLP
products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Any essential markers that could not be genotyped by either size
polymorphism or RFLP were sequenced on all the backcross animals and their parents.

PCR cycling conditions for all Type I markers were optimized for P. maniculatus and P. polionotus DNA using a MJ
Research PTC-200 DNA Engine gradient thermal cycler
and are defined as follows: 1) Standard: 95°C for 14.5
min followed by 35 cycles of (95°C for 30 s, 48–65°C for
30 s, 72°C for 30 s per 0.5 kb), 72°C for 10 min, 4°C
hold. 2) Touchdown65 (TD65): 95°C for 14.5 min followed by 20 cycles of (95°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s minus
0.5°C/cycle for 20 cycles, 72°C for 30 s per 0.5 kb) followed by 15 cycles of (95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 30 s per 0.5 kb), 72°C for 10 min, 4°C hold. If no
product was obtained using Touchdown65, the starting
annealing temperature was changed to 60°C or 55°C,
with the final annealing temperature remaining 10°C
lower than the starting temperature.

PCR Typing of the Backcross Panel
We tested the backcross panel parental mice with each
marker prior to use on the backcross panel. We typed then
typed the markers on all possible backcross animals
whose parents exhibited the expected genotype. On the
BX116 panel, no fewer than 73 animals were used for data
to establish linkage between any two markers with exception of Gbl to Hba and Hba to Canx, of which both only
used 39 animals due to the small usable data set for Hba.
For the BX2 panel, no fewer than 60 animals were typed
between any two markers with the exception of Mut and
Col9a1, for which only 40 animals could be genotyped in
common.

PCR was performed using 20 ng of genomic DNA in a 10
μl reaction containing 1 μl 10× Qiagen HotStar buffer (1.5
mM MgCl2), 200 μM each dNTP, 0.4 μM forward primer,
0.4 μM reverse primer, and 1 unit Qiagen HotStar Taq
polymerase. Some difficult templates required the use of
Qiagen Q-solution at either 1× or 0.5× strength. Four

Data Analysis
We performed backcross linkage analysis using Map Manager QTX software [39]. A minimum LOD score of 3 was
used to establish linkage. Ordering of markers typed on
the backcross data was determined by subjecting the data
to the "ripple test", which evaluated local permutations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/65

and selected the optimal order based on minimum breakage. Once linkage and gene order was established with
high degree of confidence, omitted or unavailable genotypes could sometimes be inferred by Map Manager, as
double crossovers between closely linked markers are rare.
The procedure of inferring genotypes did not change any
gene orders but typically tightened linkages slightly and
raised LOD scores.

This manuscript is dedicated to Dr. Wallace D. Dawson, a pioneer in Peromyscus research. Wally led the way in recognizing and exploiting the unique
potential offered by the genus to study the genetic underpinnings of mammalian biology, including speciation, habitat adaptation, and behavior.
Herein is presented a continuation of his initial work developing a Peromyscus linkage map. We would also like to thank Gabor Szalai, Michael Felder,
Travis Glenn, and Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena for their valuable
comments and suggestions. Support for this work was provided by grants
from the American Cancer Society (RSG-03-070-01-MGO), NSF (MCB0517754) (PBV); UCONN Research Advisory Council, (RJO); and NSF
(DEB-0344710) and NIH (P40-RR14279 and RO1-M069601), (MJD).
