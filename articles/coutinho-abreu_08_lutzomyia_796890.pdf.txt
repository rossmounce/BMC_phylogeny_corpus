Abstract
Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the principal vector of Leishmania infantum chagasi
in the Americas, and constitutes a complex of species. Various studies have suggested an incipient
speciation process based on behavioral isolation driven by the chemotype of male sexual
pheromones. It is well known that natural barriers, such as mountains and rivers can directly
influence population divergence in several organisms, including insects. In this work we investigated
the potential role played by the Sao Francisco River in eastern Brazil in defining the current
distribution of Lu. longipalpis s.l. Our studies were based on analyses of polymorphisms of the
cytochrome b gene (cyt b) sequences from Lu. longipalpis s.l. available in public databases, and from
additional field-caught individuals. Altogether, 9 distinct populations and 89 haplotypes were
represented in the analyses. Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations were grouped according to their
distribution in regards to the 10°S parallel: north of 10°S (<10°S); and south of 10°S (>10°S). Our
results suggest that although no polymorphisms were fixed, moderate genetic divergences were
observed between the groups analyzed (i.e., FST = 0.184; and Nm = 2.22), and were mostly driven
by genetic drift. The population divergence time estimated between the sand fly groups was about
0.45 million years (MY), coinciding with the time of the change in the course of the Sao Francisco
River, during the Mindel glaciation. Overall, the polymorphisms on the cyt b haplotypes and the
current speciation process detected in Lu. longipalpis s.l. with regards to the distribution of male
sexual pheromones suggest a role of the Sao Francisco River as a significant geographical barrier in
this process.

Background
Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the vector of Leishmania infantum chagasi, the causative agent of
visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the New World [1-3]. This
sand fly species has a wide, though discontinuous distri-

bution ranging from southern Mexico to northern Argentina [4]. The pattern of distribution of this sand fly is
directly associated with a notable population divergence
due to a reduced gene flow, allowing the appearance of
sibling species [5]. In the last few years many investigators

suggested the existence of at least four sibling species of
Lu. longipalpis s.l. in South and Central Americas, based on
the study of various chromosomal and molecular markers
[6-11].

geological history of the Sao Francisco River [16]. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to link the ongoing speciation of Lu. longipalpis s.l. in eastern Brazil with a significant natural barrier.

Recent studies also have suggested the presence of sibling
species in eastern Brazil [12,13]. These studies relied on
the characterization of different male sexual pheromones,
the "love songs" resulted from male wing vibration during
courtship, as well as microsatellite markers and speciation
genes. As many as five different chemotypes of sexual pheromones were characterized from Lu. longipalpis s.l. in Brazil [14]. Three of the chemotypes are pheromones of the
homosesquiterpene family, 3-methyl-α-himachalene
(3MαH), (S)-9-methyl-germacrene-B (9MGB) and (S)-9methyl-germacrene-B+ (9MGB+) (the latter two can be
differentiated based on the amounts of 9MGB produced).
Two other chemotypes are members of the diterpene family: cembrene-1 and cembrene-2. Interestingly, different
chemotypes can be associated with different male copulation sounds or love songs generated by wing flapping:
3MαH is associated with the copulation songs Pulse
songtype1; 9MGB is associated with either the Pulse
songtype2 or the Pulse songtype3; cembrene-1 production is associated with Burstsong [15]. No copulation
songs have been associated with the production of pheromones 9MGB+ and cembrene-2 [3,14,15].

Methods

Lu. longipalpis s.l. in eastern Brazil is comprised of sibling
species [3]. However, studies have yet to demonstrate a
link between these sibling species and geographic barriers
that potentially participate in the speciation process of
this sand fly. One such barrier is the Sao Francisco River,
the second largest river in Brazil extending 3160 km. The
Sao Francisco runs generally north behind the coastal
range before turning east to form the border between the
state of Bahia and the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas.
It enters the Atlantic Ocean between the states of Alagoas
and Sergipe (Figure 1A). Until the Mindel glaciation
period (0.4 million years ago – MY) the Sao Francisco ran
northward towards the State of Piaui (Figure 1B). During
the Mindel glaciation, the course of the river was altered
to its current location [16], as shown in Figure 1.
Natural geographical barriers such as rivers have been
shown to significantly influence genetic diversification
and speciation in distinct taxa [17-21]. Thus, we analyzed
the population structuring of Lu. longipalpis s.l. in eastern
Brazil based on different haplotypes of the cytochrome b
gene (cyt b), and investigated the role of the Sao Francisco
River in the speciation of this sand fly. Our results suggest
that the natural barrier represented by the Sao Francisco
River in Lu. longipalpis s.l. has played a significant role in
the development of sibling species of this sand fly. The
data are supported by evidence from recent studies on the

Sand flies
Lu. longipalpis s.l. used in this study were captured in five
separate locations (Figure 1 and Table 1) using CDC light
traps. Trapping of sand flies was done as described previously [22]. Adult sand flies were killed by freezing at 20°C and identified as described [4].
DNA Extraction, Amplification and Sequencing
The DNA samples were prepared as reported previously
[22], and amplification of cyt b was performed using the
primers
N1N5'GGCAYWTTGCCTCGAWTTCGWTATGA3' and CB35'CAYATTCAACCWGAATGATA3' [23]. PCR reactions
were routinely carried out in 50 μl volume containing 10
pmoles of each primer, 1 ng of Lu. longipalpis s.l. DNA, 5
μl of 10× PCR buffer with 2 mM of MgCl2 (Biotools, B&M
Labs, S.A. Madrid, Spain), 60 μM of dNTPs and 1.5 units
of Taq DNA polymerase (Biotools). PCR reactions were
performed as follows: a hot start at 94°C/3 min, followed
by five cycles at 94°C/30 sec, 38°C/30 sec and 72°C/90
sec, and 35 cycles at 94°C/30 sec, 42°C/30 sec and 72°C/
90 sec. The PCR products were purified with the Nucleospin Extract kit (Macherey-Nagel Inc., Easton, PA) and
cycle-sequenced using the BigDye sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer instructions. The sequencing reactions were performed using an ABI PRISM® 3100 sequence analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). Each sample was sequenced twice
and the sequencing quality was assessed using Phred [24]
with a cutoff value of 25. The haplotypes were assembled
using CAP3 [25].
Analysis of Genetic Variability
Analyses of genetic variability were performed in 34 haplotypes identified from Lu. longipalpis s.l. used in this
work, including haplotypes described previously [26,27].
The indexes of genetic variability were estimated using
DnaSP 4.10 [28]. The parameters measured were: the
number of haplotypes (h); the haplotypic diversity (Hd);
the number of segregating sites (S); the pairwise nucleotide diversity (π); the net nucleotide substitution (dA);
and the average number of nucleotide substitutions (dXY).
The θ parameter (2Neμ) was estimated for θπ and θs. θπ is
based on the average pairwise number of differences
between sequences [29] and θs is estimated from the
number of segregation sites in a population [30]. The following tests were performed to determine whether the
pattern of polymorphisms were in accordance with the
model of neutral evolution: D [31], D* and F* [32], and

Fs [33]. The Fs test was also used to assess population
expansion.
The extent of nucleotide differentiation (FST) [34] and the
level of gene flow (Nm) [35] among the populations also
were analyzed using DnaSP 4.10 [28]. The FST values were
plotted in a matrix and used to create a distance-based
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree using MEGA v3.1 [36]. The
Kimura-2P (K2P) genetics distance between clades of the
NJ tree was also calculated using the MEGA v3.1 software.

The genetic distances were used to calculate the time of
divergence between clades, based on the rate of mutation
of 2.3% sequence divergence per million years [37]. The
minimum spanning networks and the mismatch distributions were obtained using Arlequin v2.0 [38]. Raggedness
tests were performed to determine whether mismatch distributions fit the model of stable or expanding populations [39-41]. Also, we assessed the significance of the
effect of geographic distance on differentiation via the
Mantel test [42]. This test was based on the linear regres-

sion between the value of the FST/(1 - FST) [43] and the
geographical straight-line distance (in kilometers, Km)
between each population pair. Geographic distances
between capture sites were obtained from the Coordinate
Distance Calculator [44]. Results of the Mantel test were a
reflection of 1,000 permutations using Mantel v1.18 [45].
The populations analyzed in this study were combined
into two groups, taking into account the sand fly distribution in relation to the 10°S parallel. Thus, individuals that
were originally captured north of the 10°S parallel were
named <10°S; and those captured south of the 10°S parallel, >10°S

Results
In this work we analyzed phylogeographic patterns of natural populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l.. in the Brazilian NE
region. Our studies were based on polymorphisms of a
261 bp DNA fragment from the 3' end of the cyt b gene.
The phylogenetic signal shown by this short fragment was
higher than those presented by fragments of 318 and 489
nucleotides (unpublished data). Our analyses included
twenty nine haplotypes previously described [26,27] and
five novel haplotypes identified from Lu. longipalpis s.l.
from the Brazilian NE.
Out of 11 Lu. longipalpis s.l. individuals sequenced, nine
distinct haplotypes were identified, including seven
described earlier [26,27]: Ll-8 from Calumbi; Ll-3 (present
in two individuals) and Ll-9 from Itamaracá; Ll-15 from
João Pessoa; and Ll-9 and Ll-10 from Patos (Table 1). Five
novel haplotypes were named Ll-34 and Ll-35 (from
Calumbi), Ll-36 (from João Pessoa), and Ll-37 (from
Patos). A total of 34 haplotypes (including the ones
described by [26,27]) and their frequencies were analyzed
as indicated above. The haplotypes differed up to six
mutation steps and the polymorphic sites displayed no
more than two variant nucleotides. The relationship

between transition and transversion among the haplotypes was 25:1, with only five substitutions being nonsynonymous (at position 26, a Leu to Ser change, L26S;
then, S53N, P161L, V190M, N254S).
Our data shows that Ll-2 is the most frequent haplotype
and the haplotypic diversity is high (0.947) despite the
geographically widespread distribution of haplotypes Ll1, Ll-2 and Ll-7 (Tables 2 and 3). Furthermore, no genetic
differences were found between the populations of
Juazeiro and Natal, Juazeiro and Patos, Natal and Patos,
Natal and Calumbi, and Patos and Calumbi. In contrast,
the highest genetic distance was estimated between populations of Itamaraca and Monte Santo (dA = 0.496%; Table
4).
A FST distance-based Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was
obtained for all populations investigated in this study.
Two clades were identified: (I) including the populations
of Natal, Patos, Juazeiro, João Pessoa, and Itamaracá; and
(II) including the populations of Calumbi, Pancas, Monte
Santo, and Feira de Santana (Figure 2). In light of the low
level of genetic structuring and geographic distribution
the two clusters seen in Figure 2 were referred to as group
<10°S (for populations north of 10°S parallel) and group
>10°S (for populations south of 10°S parallel). According
to its geographic localization the population of Calumbi
was also included in <10°S.
The net nucleotide substitution (dA) between the groups
<10°S and >10°S was 0.217% (Table 6). The estimates of
haplotypic diversity within each group were high (Table
3), although some haplotypes (Ll-1, Ll-2, Ll-7 e Ll-8) presented a widespread geographic distribution. The average
number of nucleotide differences (π) varied from 0.7% to
1.2% per site, or from 1.85 to 3.18 per nucleotide (Table
3), and no site were fixed at different nucleotides between
groups. Within the 55 haplotypes from the group <10°S,

Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations are indicated by a vertival 3 letter code: Natal (NTL), Patos (PTS), João Pessoa (JPS), Itamaracá (ITA), Calumbi (CLB), Juazeiro (JZR), Monte Santo (MST), Feira de Santana (FST) and Pancas (PNC). GenBank accession
numbers for haplotypes Ll-1 to Ll-33 were reported in [26, 27]. GenBank accession numbers for Ll-34 to Ll-37 are EF107662 to EF107665, respectively.

18 (32.7%) were singletons. In contrast, a lower proportion of singletons (20.6%, or 7 out of 34) was observed
within the group >10°S.
Intra-population group analysis showed values of genetic
structuring (FST) and gene flow (Nm) of 0.078 and 5.92
for the group <10°S (Table 6). Equivalent results were
also obtained for the group >10°S (FST = 0.136 and Nm =
3.16, Table 6). The values of FST among the two groups
support moderate genetic divergence and higher gene
flow values (FST = 0.184 and Nm = 2.22, Table 6), whereas
the pattern of genetic structuring did not follow the model
of isolation by distance (Figure 3).
To assess gene flow between the various populations
investigated, we applied the minimum spanning network
(MSN) analysis (Figure 4). The MSN constructed with all

34 different haplotypes (Figure 4A) shows that most of
the haplotypes shared by groups <10°S and >10°S were
positioned at the interior nodes, representing ancestral
haplotypes [46,47]. Thus, the Nm of 2.22 migrates per
generation between groups <10°S and >10°S may reflect
a greater influence from the shared ancestral polymorphisms than by ongoing gene flow, according to the outline of the MSN. Nevertheless, ongoing gene flow between
these populations is still possible, as alternate connections between the terminal haplotypes are observed (Figure 4A).
MSN analysis was separately applied to the population
groups <10°S and >10°S (Figure 4B and 4C). In both
cases, interior shared haplotypes were also observed for
each group. However, the existence of shared haplotypes
at the tips of the networks, and the connections between

Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations are: Natal (NTL), Patos (PTS), João Pessoa (JPS), Itamaracá (ITA), Calumbi (CLB), Juazeiro (JZR), Monte Santo (MST),
Feira de Santana (FSN) and Pancas (PNC).

terminal haplotypes of distinct populations points to
ongoing gene flow in each case, consistent with panmitic
populations. For the group <10°S (Figure 4B) the strong
gene flow is supported by the shared haplotype positioned at the tip (Ll-9), and by several connections
between terminal haplotypes of distinct populations (Figure 4B). For the group >10°S, despite the presence of
shared ancestral haplotypes, terminal haplotypes from
three populations were connected (Figure 4C), suggesting
ongoing
gene
flow.

(Tables 3 and 7). On the other hand, the Fs test [33]
showed significant values for the same population groups.
The mismatch distribution for groups <10°S and >10°S
was unimodal (not shown), with very small raggedness
statistics (0.025 and 0.050, respectively).

Neutrality tests [48] performed between the groups <10°S
and >10°S resulted in negative values. Although the estimates of θs and θπ are higher than those of π, the D test
[31] and the D* and F* tests [32] were not significant

The model of isolation by distance was tested through linear regression between the geographic distances and the
values of FST/(1-FST). We found that the pattern of genetic
structuring of the populations was in disagreement with

The genetic distances (K2P) between groups was 1.2%,
between groups <10°S and >10°S. Based on cyt b molecular clock, the divergence time between these groups were
estimated to be 0.45 million years ago (MY).

Lu. longipalpis s.l. are as shown on Table 4. FST (italics) and distances in Km (bold) are shown

the model of isolation by distance (r = 0.347, P = 0.9628;
Figure 3).

Discussion
According to [14], there are five reproductively isolated
populations of L. longipalpis s.l. in Brazil separated on the
basis of chemotypes of the sexual pheromones they produce. The sexual pheromone 9MGB (chemotype 1) is produced by Lu. longipalpis s.l from Lapinha (MG); 3MαH
(chemotype 2) is produced by flies from Jacobina (BA);
cembrene-1 (chemotype 3) is found in flies from Sobral
(CE), Santarem (PA), and Estrela de Alagoas and Costa do
Sol (AL); cembrene-2 (chemotype 4) by flies from Jaiba
(MG); finally, 9MGB+ (chemotype 5) by flies from Sobral
(CE) and Montes Claros (MG).
Here, the genetic structuring of ten Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations from eastern Brazil was estimated through the
analysis of 26 segregating sites of a partial segment of 261
nucleotides from the mitochondrial gene cyt b. The populations studied were clustered in two groups (as indicated
in Materials and Methods), with individuals in group
<10°S correspond to the sand flies that produce the chemotype 3 (cembrene-1 and 9MGB+); and those in the group
>10°S to chemotypes 1, 2 and 5 (9MGB, 3MαH and
9MGB+).
Intra-population analyses of groups <10°S and >10°S
revealed low and moderate genetic differentiation. However, in both cases, the values of Nm (Tables 4) were above
the threshold required for differentiation by genetic drift

(Nm < 2, [49]). Also, the presence of several tip connections between haplotypes of distinct populations, and a

In contrast, inter-population analyses revealed moderate
genetic differentiation and effective number of migrants

Neutrality tests (for both neutral evolution and population
demography) were performed as indicated in the text. Significant
values were those which P < 0.05, indicated by (1).

Since population expansion interferes with the estimates
of gene flow [39-41], the Nm values obtained may be
overestimated obscuring the actual population structuring. This, along with the prevalence of ancient introgression, rather than ongoing gene flow, indicates that genetic
drift is mainly responsible for the moderate genetic differentiation between these groups.
Our results from the cyt b molecular clock suggest that the
time of divergence between the Lu. longipalpis s.l. in groups
<10°S and >10°S occurred around 0.45 MY. A similar
divergence period (0.39 MY) was estimated between the
populations of Baturite (located north the 10°S parallel)
and Jacobina (located south of the same parallel). That
estimation was based on the analysis of the molecular
clock of the cytochrome oxidase II gene, according to a
genetic distance of K2P = 0.009 [7], and a rate of divergence of 2.3% per MY [37]. The estimated time of divergence between the two groups investigated here
correspond to the Mindel glaciation (0.38–0.41 MY) that
took place during the Early to Middle Pleistocene, and was
associated with the shift in the Sao Francisco River's
course [16].
The Sao Francisco River is the second largest river in Brazil, separating the States of Pernambuco (PE) and Ceara
(CE) from Bahia (BA) and Minas Gerais (MG). On its
original course, the river flowed from MG, bearing northward through BA and continuing towards the coast of the
State of Piaui (PI) through what is today the Piaui River
and the Parnaiba River Basins. Following the uplift of the
Parnaiba River Basin and the formation of a transversal
geological fault to Northeastern coast, the course of the
Sao Francisco River was altered to its current location [16],
as shown in Figure 1A.

between the groups <10°S and <10°S (Table 6). The Fs
test and the smoothness of the mismatch distribution
indicated that these groups are in geographic expansion.

The reduced gene flow between sibling species and moderate genetic differentiation between groups <10°S and
>10°S are consistent with a distribution pattern likely
driven by the Sao Francisco River. Additionally, the estimated time of the divergence of these two groups coincides with the change of the river course. However, this
divergence cannot be associated with reduced gene flow as
mitochondrial DNA is prone to introgress through incipient species boundaries [50], and as demonstrated via cyt b
gene analysis of Lu. longipalpis s.l. sympatric cryptic species

[51]. Taken together, the data suggest that the Sao Francisco River is a significant geographic barrier between
populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l., and could also have contributed to the current level of population diversity seen
for this sand fly.
This putative role of the Sao Francisco River in the speciation of Lu. longipalpis s.l. may also explain the current distribution of male sexual pheromones chemotypes. A
plausible scenario is based on the suggestion that 9MGB
represents an ancestral chemotype pheromone and that
the diterpenes (i.e., cembrene-1 and 2) are more recent
chemotypes [14]. Dispersal of Lu. longipalpis s.l. belonging
to the Brazilian clade [7] is estimated to have occurred in
the Plioceno-Pleistocene [52] when the Sao Francisco
River flowed on a South-to-North direction [16]. Thus, the
Sao Francisco River would have served as a barrier to the
introduction of the 9MGB chemotype in the Brazilian NE
coast.
The current chemotype distribution in the Brazilian NE
possibly followed a process similar to what is described
for the ring species hypothesis [53]. Under this hypothesis
Lu. longipalpis s.l. would have reached the coastal areas of
the NE by circumventing the River's nascent, along its west
margin, in Minas Gerais, South Eastern Brazil (as shown
in Figure 1B). This process led to the adaptation to different habitats, and to differentiation into a population producing the cembrane-1 chemotype presently found in the
NE of Brazil. This idea is supported by the presence of Lu.
longipalpis s.l. in the Brazilian SE producing different pheromone chemotypes, such as 9MGB found in Lapinha
Cave, cembrene-2 in found in Jaiba, and 3MαH found in
Jacobina [14,54]. This scenario also supports the suggestion that Lu. longipalpis s.l. sibling species currently found
in Sobral were the result of vicariance 1MY ago [55], and
prior to the change in the course of the Sao Francisco
River. Thus, the sympatric species in Sobral were isolated
by the Sao Francisco River, leading to the development of
9MGB+ on the west and cembrene-1 on the east margins.
Following the shift of the Sao Francisco River these species
reached the current secondary contact proposed by [55]
(Figure 1A). Our results suggesting greater similarity
between Lu. longipalpis s.l. from Juazeiro (located on the
southern rim of the Sao Francisco River) and flies belonging to group <10°S in comparison to flies belonging to
group >10°S can be explained by a recent break-down of
this geographic barrier, either by a recent geographic accident or through human activity in the region. This is consistent with our data indicating that no ongoing
mitochondrial DNA haplotype exchange is detected
between individuals from Juazeiro and individuals from
group >10°S (Figure 4A).

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/1/1/16

Lu. longipalpis s.l. secreting cembrene-1 also are present in
areas other than the Brazilian NE [14,54,56]. In two such
areas (Marajo Island and Santarem), the presence of cembrene-1 was possibly due to a recent geographic expansion after the change in course of the Sao Francisco River.
A study using microsatellite analysis indicated strong similarities between Lu. longipalpis s.l. from Marajo Island and
flies from either Sobral or Natal [56]. Accordingly, our
data supports a pattern compatible with population
expansion from the latter two locations towards the
former based on the mismatch distribution. In regards to
the cembrene-1 population currently found in Espirito
Santo do Pinhal, Sao Paulo [57], biogeographic and
genetic studies are necessary in order to explain its origin.

Conclusion
Based on the data presented here we propose that the Sao
Francisco River restricted gene flow between Lu. longipalpis
s.l., participating in speciation processes of this sand fly.
This paper contributes to our understanding on the
expansion of Lu. longipalpis s.l. in Brazil and provides
novel clues in regards to several aspects of the divergence
of this important vector species.
