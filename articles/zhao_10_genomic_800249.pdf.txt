Abstract
Background: Peptide transporter (PTR) family whose member can transport di-/tripeptides and nitrate is important for
plant growth and development. Although the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome has been sequenced for a few years, a
genomic survey, characterization and expression profile analysis of the PTR family in this species has not been reported.
Results: In this study, we report a comprehensive identification, characterization, phylogenetic and evolutionary
analysis of 84 PTR family members in rice (OsPTR) as well as their whole-life expression patterns. Chromosomal
distribution and sequence analysis indicate that nearly 70% of OsPTR members are involved in the tandem and
segmental duplication events. It suggests that genome duplication might be a major mechanism for expansion of this
family. Highly conserved motifs were identified in most of the OsPTR members. Meanwhile, expression profile of OsPTR
genes has been analyzed by using Affymetrix rice microarray and real-time PCR in two elite hybrid rice parents,
Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Seven genes are found to exhibit either preferential or tissue-specific expression during
different development stages of rice. Under phytohormone (NAA, GA3 and KT) and light/dark treatments, 14 and 17
OsPTR genes are differentially expressed respectively. Ka/Ks analysis of the paralogous OsPTR genes indicates that
purifying selection plays an important role in function maintenance of this family.
Conclusion: These investigations add to our understanding of the importance of OsPTR family members and provide
useful reference for selecting candidate genes for functional validation studies of this family in rice.
Background
Nutrient transport is essential to life and occurs in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is well established that
peptide transporters play an important role in the nutrition of bacteria, yeasts and animals [1]. However, the role
of transporters of small peptides (2-6 amino acids) in
plants is less well defined [2]. Peptide transporter (PTR)
family (TC 2.A.17), also called the proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family [3,4] is a family consists of di-/tripeptides transporters [5]. Besides, some
plant PTRs acted as nitrate transporters are termed as the
members of Nitrate Transporter 1 family (NRT1, [6]).
PTR proteins in plants show significant sequence homology and contain several transmembrane (TM) regions,

with a large hydrophilic loop among TMs. Generally, the
identified PTR members in plants fall into three types
based on the nature of their substrates: di-/tripeptides
transporter, nitrate transporter and other substrates
transporter [6].
AtPTR2 (At2g02040) was the first identified di-/tripeptides transporter in Arabidopsis [7-10] and had high
mRNA expression levels in 3-d-germinating seed, root
and young leaf [8]. The antisense plants of AtPTR2 exhibited delayed flowering time and arrested seed development [9,11]. AtPTR1 (At3g54140) transported di-/
tripeptides with low selectivity as well as substrates lacking a peptide bond. AtPTR1 was expressed in the vascular
tissue throughout the plant, indicative of a role in longdistance transport [10]. AtPTR3 (At5g46050) was a salt
stress and mechanical wounding inducible gene, JA and
SA were both involved in regulation of it [12,13]. AtPTR5
(At5g01180) which mediated high-affinity transport of
dipeptides was most likely supplying peptides to maturat-

ing pollen, developing ovules and seeds. Overexpression
of it resulted in enhanced shoot growth and increased N
content [14]. The barley peptide transporter gene,
HvPTR1, had seed-specific expression. Transport activity
of HvPTR1 was regulated by phosphorylation in response
to rising levels of amino acids in the germinating grain
[15-17]. Functional di-/tripeptides transporters also have
been reported in Nepenthes (NaNTR1, [18]), faba bean
(VfPTR1, [19]) and Hakea actites (HaPTR4, [20]).
Although PTR is the abbreviation of peptide transporter, many cloned PTR members in plants are nitrate
transporters, especially in Arabidopsis. AtNRT1.1
(At1g12110, CHL1), a dual-affinity nitrate transporter,
was regulated by phosphorylation and involved in
nascent organ development [21-26]. AtNRT1.2
(At1g69850, NTL1) encoded a low-affinity nitrate transporter. RNAi plants of it exhibited reduced nitrateinduced membrane depolarization and nitrate uptake
activities [27]. The characterization of AtNRT1.4
(At2g26690) revealed the special role of petiole in nitrate
homeostasis [28]. AtNRT1.5 (At1g32450) and AtNRT1.6
(At1g27080) were both plasma membrane proteins.
AtNRT1.5 was expressed in root pericycle cells close to
the xylem and participated in root xylem loading of
nitrate [29] while AtNRT1.6 was only expressed in reproductive tissue and involved in delivering nitrate from
maternal tissue to the developing embryo [30]. CsNitr1, a
nitrite transporter in Cucumis sativus, had two isoforms:
CsNitr1-S and CsNitr1-L. In contrast to that CsNitr1-S
enhanced the efflux of nitrite from the cell, CsNitr1-L
might load cytosolic nitrite into chloroplast stroma [31].
Amino acids and other substrates can also be transported by some PTRs. BnNRT1.2, isolated from Brassica
napus could transport both nitrate and histidine [32].
AgDCAT1 localized at the symbiotic interface was a
dicarboxylates transporter in Alnus glutinosa and the
mRNA of AgDCAT1 was only detected in the nodules
[33].
In rice, only two PTR genes have been functionally verified. OsNRT1 (LOC_Os03g13274), which displayed lowaffinity nitrate transport activity was constitutively
expressed in the most external layer of the root, epidermis and root hair [34]. SP1 (LOC_Os11g12740) which
determined the panicle size had high expression level in
the phloem of the branches of young panicles. Phylogenetic analysis implied that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter, however, neither nitrate nor other compounds
transport activity could be obtained from it [35].
As the main staple food for a large segment of the world
population, rice also serves as a model plant for monocotyledon species [36,37]. Nutrient transport is critical for
plant growth and development, in which PTR family
members may play important roles. This work focused on
a comprehensive identification, characterization, phylo-

genetic and evolutionary analysis of all the PTR family
members in rice (OsPTR) as well as their whole-life
expression profiling. Moreover, it has been demonstrated
that the expression of some OsPTR genes is regulated
phytohormone (NAA, KT and GA3) and light/dark treatments.

Results
Collection and identification of PTR genes in rice

Domain search (PF00854) of MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project (MSU RGAP) database released 125
sequences, out of which 91 were unique. Keywords
"PTR", "peptide transporter" and "proton-dependent oligopeptide transport" searching identified 58, 85 and 10
genes respectively. BLASTP and TBLASTN searches
against rice genome in three databases: MSU RGAP,
NCBI and KOME released 95, 85 and 116 sequences
respectively. By removal of the same sequences and different transcripts of the same gene, we initially identified
93 putative PTR genes in rice. Protein sequences of these
genes were subjected to Pfam and SMART searches for
the presence of PTR domains. As a result, seven genes
whose protein contained only partial PTR domain and
two genes annotated as retrotransposons were excluded
from further analysis. Taken together, a total of 84 genes
were predicted to encode PTR proteins in rice. Eightythree genes had corresponding locus IDs in MSU RGAP
database and one gene (Os01g0960900) was only found in
NCBI. For convenience, all the "LOC_" prefix of MSU
RGAP locus IDs were omitted representing OsPTR genes
or proteins for further analysis. Meanwhile, similar methods were used and 53 PTR family members in Arabidopsis (AtPTR) were identified. The detailed information
about the full-length cDNA, transcript, chromosomal
position, BAC accession, gene structure for each OsPTR
gene and characteristics of corresponding proteins can be
found in Additional file 1. Protein structures predicted by
SMART are shown in Additional file 2. The putative
transmembrane (TM) regions in each OsPTR protein are
listed in Additional file 3.
Chromosomal localization and gene duplication

To further investigate the relationship between the
genetic divergence within the PTR family and gene duplication in rice, the chromosomal location of each PTR
gene was determined from the genomic sequence of rice.
The 84 OsPTR genes were dispersed on all the rice chromosomes except chromosome 9. Their chromosomal distribution pattern revealed that certain chromosomes and
chromosomal regions had a relatively high density of
OsPTR genes. For instance, chromosome 1 had the highest density with 19 members, followed by chromosome
10 had 14 members. Ten genes were located on chromosome 4, eight genes on chromosome 3, 5 and 6, five genes

on chromosome 11 and four genes on chromosome 2 and
12, and only two genes on chromosome 7 and 8. For most
chromosomes, OsPTR genes were present only on half
arm of the chromosome or in clusters, i.e., no OsPTR
gene appeared on the short arm of chromosome 2, 4 and
5 and most of the genes on chromosome 1 and 10 were
clustered together (Figure 1).
Analysis of the MSU RGAP segmental duplication
database revealed that 21 OsPTR genes (11 pairs) could

be assigned to rice segmental duplication blocks (Figure
1). Os02g47090 participated in two segmental duplications with Os04g50940 and Os10g42870 respectively. The
overall identities of the protein sequences of these genes
ranged from 37.6% to 76.1%. A total of 44 genes (14 clusters, nine genes also involved in segmental duplication)
were considered as tandem duplications according to the
criterion adopted in our analysis, including the largest
cluster of nine genes on chromosome 1, two four-gene

position of centromeres. The scale on the left is in megabases (Mb). Respective chromosome numbers are indicated at the top of each bar. The chromosome order has been arranged to bring duplicated regions in the vicinity. The segmental duplication genes have been connected by straight line.
In case of tandemly duplicated genes present in clusters, the genes are marked with rectangles of different colors.

clusters on chromosome 10 and 5, five three-gene clusters on chromosome 3, 4, 6 and 11, six two-gene clusters
on chromosome 1, 5, 6, 10 and 12 (Figure 1). The protein
homology of these genes varied from 22.9% to 89.5%.
Interestingly, all the tandemly duplicated genes in the
same cluster had the same direction of transcription
except Os06g13200 and Os06g13210. This might suggest
the conserved behavior of tandem duplications in this
family. Of the 84 OsPTR genes, 66.7% (56 of 84) involved
in the duplication events. Moreover, most of the duplicated genes had relative close phylogenetic relationship
(see below). Therefore, segmental and large-scale tandem
duplication events appeared to have exclusively contributed to the expansion of the OsPTR gene family. Similar
manner of member duplication had also been described
in some large gene families in rice, for instance, the
ankyrin repeat gene family [38] and the bHLH family
[39].
Phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment

To examine in detail the phylogenetic relationship and
functional divergence of OsPTR members, the aligned 84
OsPTR protein sequences were used to construct the
joint unrooted phylogenetic tree. Our result suggested
that the OsPTR proteins could be classified into five
major subfamilies designated from I to V, with high bootstrap value support (Figure 2). This exercise resulted in
five distinct subfamilies similar to that in Arabidopsis
reported by Waterworth and Bray [2]. Within the five
subfamilies formed, subfamily I, II and III were found to
be more closely related to each other in comparison to
subfamily IV and V. Subfamily I had the largest 30 PTR
members and fell into three groups. Subfamily II, containing 21 PTR members was further divided into two
groups. Subfamily III also including two groups contained 11 members. Subfamily IV had 16 members and
subfamily V consisted of six members which had relative
phylogenetic distance from other members. We identified 29 pairs of OsPTR genes that were close paralogs on
the terminal node of phylogenetic tree. Tandem duplication contributed to 16 pairs of them and segmental duplication contributed to three pairs. These results
furthermore illustrated that segmental and tandem duplication events were the dominant pattern in the expansion
of OsPTR family members. To well understand the evolutionary history of OsPTR family, the amino acid
sequences of PTR domains in each OsPTR protein were
used for further phylogenetic analysis and similar tree
was obtained. This result indicated that the main characteristic of OsPTR family was determined by the PTR
domain.
In order to investigate the relationship between the
function and phylogenetic subfamily formation of PTR
members as well as identify some orthologous genes, a

Page 4 of 20

combined phylogenetic tree with OsPTR and AtPTR proteins was also established (Additional file 4). As a result,
similar subfamilies were formed compared to the tree of
OsPTR. Each subfamily contained both Arabidopsis and
rice PTR members. However, most of the members were
clustered in species-specific distinct clades, and only four
pairs of orthologs (Os01g01360 and At5g13400,
Os01g37590 and At2g26690, Os06g15370 and
At1g68570, Os05g27010 and At2g40460) could be figured
out. This result indicated that the main characteristics of
PTR family in rice and Arabidopsis were formed before
the split of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
and then evolved separately in a species-specific manner.
Moreover, the difference in the total number of OsPTR
and AtPTR was mainly due to the variation in the number
of subfamily I genes, which were 30 in rice and eight in
Arabidopsis. Of the 30 subfamily I PTRs in rice, 21 were
tandemly or segmentally duplicated genes.
The alignments and comparison of the OsPTR fulllength protein sequences and the PTR domain sequences
illustrated that most of the amino acids in TM regions in
or out of the PTR domain in members of the same phylogenetic subfamily were very conservative. On the contrary, the amino acids outside the TM regions were in
great variation. In addition, some loop areas between the
TM regions in the PTR domain of different members varied significantly both in length and amino acid composition. The alignment of the subfamily III members is
shown in Figure 3 as an example. Due to the conservatism
of the PTR domain and function variety of the PTR members, the diversity of the amino acids in the loop and
beyond the PTR domain areas might be the major force
of functional discrepancy of each PTR member.
From the comparison of the protein sequences and
sequences alignment, we found three special motifs that
were highly conserved in most of the OsPTR members.
Motif 1 (NLVxYL) was found nearly before the N terminal
of the PTR domain. Motif 2 whose sequence was
LYLxxxGxGGxK(R)xxxxxFGADQFD was located at the
end of the first TM region of the PTR domain or
stretched into the following hydrophilic loop before the
second TM region. Following the motif 2, before/in or at
the end of the second TM region of the PTR domain,
motif 3 (FFNWY) was identified. The HMM logos of
these motifs in OsPTR are shown in Figure 4a and their
locations can be found in Figure 3. In most AtPTR members, similar conserved motifs could also be figured out
(Figure 4b). However, motif 2 and 3 in AtPTR were
located between the second and third TM regions of the
PTR domain. Sequence screening of motif 2 in InterProscan and Uniprot databases retrieved only PTR family
members. Therefore, we supposed that this motif was a
newly identified signature sequences associated to the
plant PTR family.

Expression profiling of OsPTR genes in whole-life cycle of
rice

Probes for 81 of 84 OsPTR genes could be found in our
expression database. To analyze the expression profiles of
the OsPTR genes, the signal values of the 81 OsPTR genes
represented on the array were extracted. Average signal
values for the 81 OsPTR genes from two or three biologi-

cal replicates of each sample are given in Additional file 5.
A hierarchical cluster displayed of logarithm of average
signal values for the 81 OsPTR genes in selected tissues in
Minghui 63 (MH63) is presented in Figure 5a. Three
genes (Os01g65140, Os05g35650 and Os06g13200) had
no corresponding probe set. Therefore, real-time PCR

was used to study the expression pattern of these genes
(Figure 5b).
Based on hierarchical clustering, expression pattern of
OsPTR genes could be divided into five major groups.
Group 1 consisted of 25 genes which showed high expression levels in all the tissues expect six genes that showed
relatively low expression in certain tissues (Os03g60850
in Sta, Os03g04570 in Ste1, P1, Sta and E3, Os06g15370
in FL1, FL2 and Ste1, Os10g02240 in P1-P3, Os10g33170
in Se, Sta, E1 and E3 and Os12g44100 in P1-P3). Conversely, group 2 contained 10 genes that showed low
expression level in the whole life cycle. Group 3 was comprised of 16 genes that showed relatively high expression
level in both vegetative tissues and hull. All these genes
had low expression level in early panicle and endosperm
stages. Group 4 comprised of 16 genes with medium
expression level in all the tissues except that Os04g56560
had high expression in root, Os01g65120 in E2,
Os11g23890 in E1-E2 and Os01g55600 in E1-E3. The rest
14 genes belonged to group 5 although these genes had
different expression patterns. For example, Os04g41400
had high expression signal in root and stamen,
Os04g59480 showed high expression in FL2, Os11g12740
had high expression in panicle and stem. Interestingly,
Os01g65110, Os01g55610, Os11g17970, Os10g42900 and
Os06g21900 all showed relatively high expression in
endosperms. The expression patterns of most OsPTR
genes in Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) were similar to that in
MH63 and the corresponding hierarchical cluster was
shown in Additional file 6.
For further study regarding the expression pattern and
looking inside the putative functions of OsPTR family
members, we employed the analysis of preferential and
tissue-specific expression genes in MH63 and ZS97. The
identified preferential expression genes were mainly
expressed in stamen and root. Os04g41410 was preferentially expressed in stamen of one day before flowering and
Os04g50950 was in root of seedling with two tillers in
MH63. In ZS97, Os01g65110 and Os12g44100 were identified as stamen preferential expression genes, while
Os02g47090 and Os04g50950 were preferentially
expressed in root (Figure 6a). The check of our whole
genome expression profile of rice for different tissues
obtained several tissue-specific expression genes including Os04g50940 in root of MH63 and in flag leaf of 14day after flowering in MH63 as well as ZS97, Os02g47090
in root of MH63 and ZS97 and Os01g55600 in
endosperm of 14-day after pollination in ZS97 (Figure
6b).
The hierarchical cluster of the AtPTR genes in 24 development stages released the expression profile of 51 genes
except At1g72125, At3g45660 and At3g54450 (Additional
file 7). Obviously, the expression patterns of AtPTR genes
fell into the similar groups as OsPTR genes. Some tissue-

Page 9 of 20

specific expression AtPTR genes could also be identified,
for example, At1g27040, At4g21680 and At3g25260 in
seed and siliques, At3g45710 and At3g45700 in root.
Most of the AtPTR genes had relatively low expression
level in mature pollen except At1g62200, At5g28470 and
At5g01180. These genes were most likely supplying nutrition to maturating pollen. Some of the orthologous
OsPTR and AtPTR genes showed the similar expression
pattern such as Os06g15370 and At1g68570, Os05g27010
and At2g40460. They both had high expression level in all
the tissues. However, no more apparent relationship
between the expression pattern and sequence similarities
of OsPTR and AtPTR members could be pointed out.
Expression regulation of OsPTR genes under
phytohormone and light/dark treatments

To determine the OsPTR genes in response to phytohormone treatments, microarray analysis was performed.
We identified six and nine OsPTR genes that were differentially expressed under one or more of the phytohormone treatments compared with the control in MH63
and ZS97, respectively (Figure 7). Among these genes,
only one gene (Os01g37590) was in common for two genotypes and it was down-regulated under three phytohormone treatments. The expression profile of the remaining
genes in two genotypes was different. For instance, in
MH63, Os01g67630 and Os10g42900 were down-regulated under NAA and GA3 treatments while Os04g56560
and Os06g38294 were down-regulated specifically to KT
and GA3 treatment, respectively. Os01g0960900 was upregulated specifically to NAA treatment. Five genes were
up-regulated and four genes were down-regulated in
ZS97. The up-regulated genes were Os01g65100,
Os01g65169, Os01g65190, Os01g65200 and Os04g50930
while the down-regulated genes were Os01g37590,
Os06g13210, Os11g12740 and Os12g12934. Os01g37590
and Os12g12934 were both down-regulated under three
phytohormone treatments. Os01g65169 and Os04g50930
were both up-regulated under NAA and KT treatments.
Os01g65100 was up-regulated under NAA and GA3
treatments. Os01g65190 and Os11g12740 showed differential expression specifically to KT treatment while
Os01g65200 and Os06g13210 showed differential expression to GA3 treatment. The fold changes with respect to
control of differential expression genes under phytohormone treatments are given in Additional file 8.
To investigate possible light regulation of OsPTR genes,
the expression profile of OsPTR genes in seedlings (plumule and radicle) treated with light or dark for 48 hours
after emergence was also analyzed. Twelve and seven
genes were differentially expressed under light compared
to dark in plumule and radicle, respectively (Figure 8a
and 8b). Eight genes (Os01g65150, Os05g35594,
Os06g15370, Os06g49220, Os10g22560, Os10g33170,

expression in plumule and four genes (Os02g37040,
Os03g04570, Os10g02240 and Os11g23890) in radicle in
MH63. Interestingly, all the differentially expressed genes
were up-regulated in plumule under light compared to

dark while two of four genes in radicle were down-regulated. Os01g65150 was up-regulated nearly 10-fold under
light compared to dark in plumule. In ZS97, five genes
(Os03g01290, Os08g41590, Os10g02080, Os10g33210
and Os11g17970) were differentially expressed in plu-

mule and three genes (Os10g02080, Os11g17970 and
Os12g44100) in radicle. Interestingly, two genes
(Os10g02080 and Os11g17970) were differentially
expressed in both plumule and radicle in ZS97. The fold
changes with respect to control of light/dark regulation
genes are listed in Additional file 8.
Ka/Ks analysis and express pattern divergence of
paralogous OsPTR genes involved in duplication

To explore the mechanism of gene divergence after duplication, the coding sequences of the paralogous OsPTR
genes involved in duplications were used to calculate the
synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution
rate after duplication. The Ka/Ks ratio provides information about the degree of positive selection across all
nucleotides in a gene since divergence. Generally, Ka/Ks
= 1 means neutral selection, Ka/Ks < 1 indicates purifying
selection and Ka/Ks > 1 shows the accelerated evolution
with positive selection [40]. The Ka/Ks analysis demonstrated that Ka/Ks ratios for all the paralogous OsPTR
genes were always less than one, most of them even close
to zero, suggesting that purifying selection might be
largely responsible for function maintenance of this family (Table 1).
Comparison of expression pattern shifts of the duplicated paralogous genes can reflect the divergence
hypotheses that a duplicate gene pair might be involved
in: nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization [41]. The expression profile of the 17
pairs of paralogous OsPTR genes with corresponding
probes was extracted for analysis. Obviously, the 17 pairs
of paralogous OsPTR genes had divergent expression patterns. It seemed that all the three hypotheses influence
the fate of the duplicated genes. Two pairs of genes
(Os01g55600 and Os01g55610, Os01g65150 and
Os01g65169) showed almost the same expression pattern
in both copies, indicating they were just formed due to
duplication (Figure 9a). The fate of four pairs in Figure 9b
could be described as nonfunctionalization, where one
copy of the paralog lost expression in all tissues. Subfunctionalization explained for five pairs of paralogous genes,
in which the expression patterns of both copies were
complementary to the pattern before duplication (Figure
9c). The divergence hypotheses of the rest six pairs of
paralogous genes were assigned as neofunctionalization,
where the expression of one copy had an obvious increase
in one or more tissues (Figure 9d).

Discussion
Di-/tripeptides and nitrate transport is important for various aspects of plant growth and development, in which
peptide transporter family members may play important
roles. Considering the potential functional diversity of
PTR members associated with nutrient transport and

Page 13 of 20

only a few PTR family members have been described in
higher plants, it was timely and quite relevant for us to
characterize the rice PTR family. Combination of the
whole genome sequence data, sequences alignment and
high-throughput expression analysis undertaken in this
investigation provides an insight into all the 84 members
of PTR family in rice.
Duplication played an important role in the expansion of
the OsPTR family

It is well known that gene duplication is important for
gene family evolution and diversity, which can occur via
three major mechanisms: segmental duplication, tandem
duplication and retroposition [42]. Due to repetitive plant
genome duplications, certain plant genomes are likely to
harbor relatively large members of a gene family, as compared to animal genomes [43]. The PTR families in rice
and Arabidopsis are very much in line with the statement
and showed increased family members in order to adapt
for specific functions. The number of 84 OsPTR and 53
AtPTR members is far greater as compared to the low
number of six in human, four in C. elegans, three in Drosophila and two in yeast [44]. It may indicate the importance of these transporters in plant growth and
metabolism. Nearly 70% of the 84 OsPTR genes are duplicated genes, 21 genes (25%) are found to be involved in
the segmental duplication while 44 (53.4%) participated
in tandem duplication. Our analysis also indicated that in
subfamily I, duplication events were largely responsible
for the number difference of the member between
OsPTR and AtPTR. It demonstrates that the OsPTR family may undergo extensive and rapid genomic changes
which can maintain relative large number of member and
lead to expression divergences between duplicate genes,
further contributing to the establishment of novel gene
functions [45].
Phylogenetic relationship and functional diversity among
the OsPTR members

The phylogenetic analysis reveals that the OsPTR family
can be further divided into five subfamilies. The combined phylogenetic tree of OsPTR and AtPTR showed
similar subfamily formation whereas most PTR members
were clustered in species-specific clades and only four
pairs of orthologs could be identified. It suggests that the
members of the PTR family have diverged from each
other primarily due to speciation and then undergone
significant changes since the monocot/dicot split.
However, highly conserved motifs have been identified
in most members of AtPTR and OsPTR. We further
adopted the sequence alignment including the PTR
members in plant, animal, human and prokaryotic organisms. It was surprising to find that the three motifs could
be found in most eukaryotic PTR members but changed a

lot or lost in the prokaryotic PTR members, especially
motif 2 and motif 3. Moreover, some members such as
Os01g65120, Os04g50930, Os12g13790 and At2g38100
which had far phylogenetic relationship from other PTR
members, had great amino acid variation in motif 2 and
motif 3. We inferred that motif 2 and motif 3 might be
important characteristic logos of the eukaryotic PTR
members and played considerable roles in the function
formation of the PTR family. Further research may
employ the point mutations introduced into these motifs,
which should cause a loss of function of the corresponding protein. This experimentation could indicate the
essentiality of these motifs for the formation of the transporter pore and the interaction with the substrates.
The sequence similarity among the OsPTR members
seemed to show little relationship with their putative
transporter type classification. In addition, we found that
gene structures, intron phases of OsPTR genes and distribution of TM regions in the proteins had no relationship
with their phylogenetic subfamily and transporter type
classifications. As most OsPTR proteins had PTR as their
only recognizable domain (See Additional file 2), we
adopted the MEME method [46], in order to identify
some new motifs or domains. However, the conserved
motifs investigated by MEME were all TM regions (data
not shown). We infer that the substrate selection of
OsPTR proteins may be decided by their three dimensional structures. The determination of the di-/tripeptide,
nitrate and other type transporters in this family by
mutagenesis or crystal structure studies should solve the
puzzle that di-/tripeptides, nitrate and other substrates of
PTR proteins are very different in structure but they
share the same transporter family - PTR [6].
Expression pattern divergence of the OsPTR genes

Microarray provides a rich resource for investigating the
evolution of gene expression. The temporal and spatial
expression patterns of OsPTR genes are useful information for establishing their putative functions. Our
microarray analysis indicated that the expression patterns
of the 81 OsPTR genes could be classified into five
groups. We also identified some preferential or tissuespecific expression OsPTR genes. Of the 81 genes analyzed in this study, only seven were found to exhibit either
preferential or tissue-specific expression during different
development stages of MH63 and ZS97. Interestingly,
these genes were most preferentially or specifically
expressed in root and stamen. Os02g47090, Os04g50940
and Os04g50950 were preferentially expressed in root.
Moreover, these three genes were in the same phylogenetic clade that belonged to the group three of subfamily
I. In Arabidopsis, the expression of AtNRT1.1 was found
concentrated in the tips of primary and lateral roots [26].
AtNRT1.2 was primarily expressed in root hairs and the

Page 16 of 20

epidermis in both young and mature regions of roots [27].
OsNRT1 was constitutively expressed in the most external layer of the root, epidermis and root hair [34]. Our
data showed that OsNRT1 had high expression levels in
all the tissues especially in root. Os03g13240 and
Os03g13250 were the paralogs of OsNRT1. Moreover,
these three genes formed a tandem duplication cluster.
Os03g13240 and Os03g13250 showed similar expression
patterns with OsNRT1 and Os03g13250 had the highest
expression level in root. It can be inferred that these rootpreferentially or -specifically expressed OsPTR genes
might be nitrate transporters and play important roles in
root formation and development. AtNRT1.4 was
expressed in the leaf petiole and participated in regulating leaf nitrate homeostasis [28]. The ortholog of
AtNRT1.4 in rice was Os01g37590 which continuously
expressed in vegetative tissues with high level in leaves.
Expression of Os04g50940 was specific in flag leaf of 14day after flowering both in MH63 and ZS97. Therefore,
we infer that Os01g37590 and Os04g50940 might be participated in the development of leaf as well as the nutrient
transporting in and/or out of leaf.
In addition, we also identified three genes
(Os01g65110, Os04g41410 and Os12g44100) that were
preferentially expressed in stamen and one gene
(Os01g55600) in endosperm. One interesting phenomenon in our dendrogram was that three-quarter of the
OsPTR genes had significant low expression level in panicles of different development stages. SP1 whose transcription accumulated in panicle was one of the
exceptions. SP1 was highly expressed in the phloem of
the branches of young panicles, which was consistent
with the predicted function of SP1 and the phenotype of
sp1 mutant [35]. It can be demonstrated that some PTR
members might also play roles in nutrient transport in
reproductive organ development.
Potential involvement of OsPTR members in
phytohormone and light/dark regulations

Little attention has been paid on the functions of PTR
members in phytohormone and light/dark regulations.
Until now, AtNRT1.1 was the only reported PTR gene
that was involved in these regulations. AtNRT1.1 was regulated by auxin in both shoots and roots and involved in
light-induced stomatal opening [47,48]. However, our
microarray data showed that the expression patterns of
more than one-third OsPTR genes changed significantly
under phytohormone and light/dark treatments. Fourteen OsPTR genes are regulated by at least one phytohormone and 17 OsPTR genes are involved in the regulation
of light/dark treatment in MH63 and ZS97. From these
results, it can be speculated that these differentially
expressed OsPTR genes may play an important role in the
transport of regulatory molecules (e.g. hormone-peptide

Zhao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:92
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/92

conjugates) and other metabolites induced by regulation
of phytohormone and light/dark treatments. For example, IAA is an important plant growth phytohormone and
95% of the IAA pool is sequestered in an inactivated conjugated form, e.g. IAA can be conjugated to single amino
acids, peptides or proteins via amide bonds. These conjugates may be involved in regulating phytohormone activity in response to plant growth and development, as well
as facilitating hormone transport [49]. It seems that the
proteins of those OsPTR genes regulated by NAA might
have IAA conjugates transport activity.
Fate of the paralogous OsPTR genes after duplication

From the Ka/Ks analysis of the paralogous OsPTR genes,
it is obvious that purifying selection plays an important
role in function maintenance of this family. However,
comparison of the expression data implied that after
duplication, the paralogous pairs may have been evolved
in different hypotheses to gain functional divergence.
Expression data shows that some of these duplicated
genes have undergone subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization, which contribute to the possibility of maintenance and divergence of a paralogous set of genes.
Some paralogs have adopted nonfunctionalization which
contributes to the likelihood of loss of one member in a
pair of paralogous genes. However, sufficient experimentation is required to prove these hypotheses.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the results of this study display the
genomic framework, characterization, conserved motifs,
duplication manner and evolutionary analysis of the 84
OsPTR members, along with their expression profiles
during whole-life stages as well as under phytohormone
and light/dark treatments. These data will provide the
basis for understanding the evolutionary history of PTR
members and their roles in rice growth and development.
The findings in our work would be useful in selecting
candidate genes for functional validation studies of PTR
members in rice. However, future research by adopting
RNAi/overexpression strategies or insertion mutagenesis
is required to elucidate the precise role of individual
OsPTR gene.
Methods
Database screening and mining

Three methods were used to identify all putative PTR
members in rice. First, domain search was executed on
website of MSU RGAP http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/
domain_search.shtml. Second, key words "PTR", "peptide
transporter" and "proton-dependent oligopeptide transport" were used as queries to search against the annotation database of rice genome (Release 6.1 of MSU RGAP).
Third, BLASTP and TBLASTN searches with the con-

Page 17 of 20

served sequence of PTR download from Pfam http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ as query were carried out in three
databases: MSU RGAP http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/,
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the Knowledge-Based
Oryza Molecular Biological Encyclopedia (KOME, http://
cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA). The parameters of blast
searches were set as follows: max target sequences-500
and expect value less than 10. The Pfam search (E value <
1.0) and SMART http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ search
(normal mode, including outlier homologues and homologues of known structure, Pfam domains, signal peptides, internal repeats and intrinsic protein disorder)
were used to confirm the presence of PTR domain in
each predicted protein. Information about the transcript,
chromosomal position, full-length cDNA, BAC accession, gene structure for each gene and characteristics of
proteins were obtained from MSU RGAP. The structure
of each OsPTR protein was predicted in SMART. To predict the putative TM regions in each OsPTR protein, the
TMHMM Server v2.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
TMHMM/ was applied with default settings.
Chromosomal localization and gene duplication

The physical positions of OsPTR genes were used to map
these genes onto the corresponding rice chromosomes.
The distribution of OsPTR genes on chromosomes was
drawn by using the MapChart software [50] and modified
manually with annotation. The presence of OsPTR genes
on duplicated chromosomal segments was investigated
by searching the segmental genome duplication of rice at
MSU
RGAP
http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/
segmental_dup/index.shtml with the maximum length
distance permitted between collinear gene pairs of 500
kb. Gene distributed nearby and separated by five or
fewer genes were considered to be tandem duplicates.
Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment

ClustalX version 1.83 [51] was used to perform the multiple sequence alignment and generate the unrooted phylogenetic tree based on the protein sequences of OsPTR
members with neighbor-joining method [52]. Bootstrap
analysis was performed using 1000 replicates. The phylogenetic tree was displayed and annotated using MEGA
software version 4 [53]. The combined tree with OsPTR
and AtPTR proteins was generated using the same
method. The multiple sequence alignment generated by
ClustalX was modified manually and the conserved
sequences were annotated according to the results of
SMART and Pfam searches. The sequence alignment of
the conserved motifs was submitted to the hmmbuild
program of Mobyle [54] to build a profile HMM. Then
the profile HMM was submitted into LogoMat-M [55] to
draw the HMM logo.

Rice materials and treatments

RNA samples used for microarray hybridization were
obtained from two elite hybrid rice parents MH63 and
ZS97 growing in normal field conditions at different
developmental stages. For phytohormone treatments,
seedlings at trefoil stage of MH63 and ZS97 were both
treated with solutions of 0.1 mM NAA, GA3 and KT
respectively. Samples were collected at the time points of
5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after treatment and the samples
under the same phytohormone treatment of different
time points were mixed together. For light/dark treatments, seedlings at the plumule and radicle stages of
MH63 and ZS97 were placed under 48 hours continuous
light or darkness (when plumule was about 1-2 cm and
radicle was about 2-3 cm in length) after emergence and
harvested at the assigned time respectively.
Microarray expression data analysis

Expression profile data of OsPTR genes was extracted
from CREP database http://crep.ncpgr.cn of our lab that
composed of hybridization of RNA samples from 39 tissues/organs covering the whole life cycle of rice with the
Affymetrix rice microarray. The microarray data have
been submitted under the accession number GSE19024
[56] into the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
Thirteen vegetative and 11 reproductive samples of different developmental stages that could cover the whole
life cycle of rice were used for OsPTR expression profile
analysis in this study. The detailed information of samples
used in analysis is listed in Additional file 9.
Probe sets with the entire set of 11 probes (8-10 in
some cases) present on the array with 100% identity over
the corresponding genes were considered to be significant. Wherever more than one probe set was available for
one gene, the probe set located on the 3' end was given
preference. After normalization and variance stabilization, the average signal value of replicates for each probe
set was used for analysis. Expression values of each gene
were logarithmized in hierarchical cluster analysis and
the heatmap were performed using R version 2.9.0 http://
www.r-project.org/ with the method of complete linkage.
The expression profile data of AtPTR genes was extracted
from
AtGenExpress
(http://www.weigelworld.org/
resources/microarray/AtGenExpress, [57]). Hierarchical
cluster analysis and the heatmap drawing were used the
same method as OsPTR.
To identify preferentially expressed genes, a student-t
test was adopted. A gene was considered as preferential
expression gene only if the signal value of the gene in a
designated sample was more than two-fold and had a P
value less than 0.05 as compared with the other samples.
Also, a check of our whole genome expression profile
data of rice for different tissues was used to identify tissue-specific expression genes [56]. Under phytohormone

Page 18 of 20

and light/dark treatments, genes that were up- or downregulated more than two-fold with P value less than 0.05
as compared to control were considered as differential
expression genes.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis

Real-time PCR reactions were carried out using the same
RNA samples that were used for microarray. The
sequences of primers used for real-time PCR are:
Os01g65140 (F: AACTGGCTTCTGGCGAAAGAA, R:
CGGAAGCAGCTTGACGAATAA), Os05g35650 (F:
GGCAGCTGGTTCTCCAACAA,
R:
CGGCGATCAGCCAGTAGAAG), Os06g13200 (F: GCTCATGTTCGCGGTCATCT, R: TCCATCAACATCCCCTGCTT)
and Actin1 (F: TGGCATCTCTCAGCACATTCC, R:
TGCACAATGGATGGGTCAGA). First-stand cDNA
was synthesized from DNaseI-treated total RNA using
Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Realtime PCR were performed in 25 Î¼l reaction mixture with
1 Î¼l of first-strand cDNA, 12.5 Î¼l 2Ã SYBR PremixÂ® Ex
Taqâ¢ (TaKaRa), 0.5 Î¼l 50Ã ROX reference dye II and 0.5 Î¼l
of each primer. The reactions were carried out using ABI
PRISM 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). The following
program was used: 95Â°C for 10 s; 45 cycles of 95Â°C for 5 s,
60Â°C for 34 s. Rice Actin1 was used as internal control.
The relative expression levels were analyzed as described
previously [58].
Ka and Ks calculations

The paralogous PTR genes in rice were inferred from the
phylogenetic tree analysis. Pairwise aligned paralogous
protein sequences generated by the ClustalW2 http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/ were used as the alignment guides. PAL2NAL (http://www.bork.embl.de/
pal2nal/, [59]) was used to convert the multiple sequence
alignment of proteins and the corresponding mRNA
sequences into a codon alignment. Then the calculation
of non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates were carried out on the PAL2NAL website
automatically by using the codeml program in PAML
[60]. By performing the EMBOSS Pairwise Alignment
Algorithms on EBI http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/
align/, we analyzed the protein identities between paralogs of OsPTR.
