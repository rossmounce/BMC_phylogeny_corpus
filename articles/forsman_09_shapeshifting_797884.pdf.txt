Abstract
Background: Corals are notoriously difficult to identify at the species-level due to few diagnostic
characters and variable skeletal morphology. This 'coral species problem' is an impediment to
understanding the evolution and biodiversity of this important and threatened group of organisms.
We examined the evolution of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and
mitochondrial markers (COI, putative control region) in Porites, one of the most taxonomically
challenging and ecologically important genera of reef-building corals.
Results: Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were congruent, clearly resolving many traditionally
recognized species; however, branching and mounding varieties were genetically indistinguishable
within at least two clades, and specimens matching the description of 'Porites lutea' sorted into three
genetically divergent groups. Corallite-level features were generally concordant with genetic
groups, although hyper-variability in one group (Clade I) overlapped and obscured several others,
and Synarea (previously thought to be a separate subgenus) was closely related to congeners
despite its unique morphology. Scanning electron microscopy revealed subtle differences between
genetic groups that may have been overlooked previously as taxonomic characters.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the coral skeleton can be remarkably evolutionarily
plastic, which may explain some taxonomic difficulties, and obscure underlying patterns of
endemism and diversity.

Background
Coral species are notoriously difficult to identify, which is
an impediment to understanding their ecology, evolution, and biodiversity. Coral species descriptions are traditionally based solely on skeletal morphology, which is
known to exhibit variation unrelated to reproductive isolation or evolutionary divergence [1-3]. Coral skeletal

morphology can be remarkably phenotypically plastic,
responding to a wide variety of parameters such as light,
sedimentation, water motion, water chemistry, and ecological interactions [2,4]. Adding to taxonomic confusion,
the conceptual nature of the coral species is a subject of
intense debate, particularly regarding the permeability of
reproductive boundaries between morphological 'spe-

cies'. Molecular tools are clearly needed to delineate species boundaries, and to reveal patterns of their evolution
and biodiversity. However, molecular studies have met
with considerable technical challenges, and fueled additional controversy over the extent and evolutionary significance of hybridization between species [4-6].
Mitochondrial DNA is one the most widely used and
informative molecular markers in Metazoa; however, the
Anthozoan mitochondrial genome evolves unusually
slowly, providing little phylogenetic resolution at or
below the family or genus level [7,8]. The nuclear ribosomal ITS region (a portion of the ribosomal cistron consisting of two rapidly evolving internal transcribed spacers
and the 5.8S gene) is among the most widely used molecular markers for species-level studies in plants [9], fungi
[10], and corals [11-29]. Despite wide use of the ITS
region, the multi-copy marker presents challenges, particularly when disparate variants are found within a single
genome. Highly divergent ITS copies are thought to be
found exclusively within organisms that have a history of
hybridization between disparate parents [30,31], and the
thousands of copies in a typical Eukaryotic genome are
thought to be homogenized by recombinant processes
(concerted evolution) in frequently interbreeding groups
[32,33].
Alvarez & Wendel [9] and Vollmer & Palumbi [34] cautioned however that it is difficult to distinguish between
introgression from hybridization and incomplete lineage
sorting of ancestral polymorphisms. Vollmer & Palumbi
[34] argued against using the ITS region in corals altogether based on observations in Acropora, a genus with
many species that are known to hybridize [6,35]. However, Acropora contains the highest known levels of ITS
intra-genomic variation observed in Metazoa [13] from
pseudogenes originating from an ancient hybridization
event [24]. A broad survey of ITS intra-genomic variation
in corals showed that problematic variation was a rare
exception found only in Acropora and not as a general rule
in other coral taxa [29]. ITS intra-genomic variation is low
in Porites and the phylogenetic signal is strong relative to
noise from alignment ambiguities, which may be reduced
with increased taxonomic sampling [21,23].
The majority of species-level phylogenetic studies on corals failed to resolve closely related morphospecies, which
has fueled debate about the nature of the coral species,
and raised questions about the evolution of the most
widely used molecular markers. The present study examines congeneric species across a range of evolutionary
divergences with comparatively broad taxonomic sampling to determine if skeletal morphology is evolutionarily constrained or labile. We explore patterns of evolution
and biodiversity in Porites with both the ITS region and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/45

mitochondrial markers (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
and the 'putative control region').
Porites provides an excellent example of the 'species problem' in corals [36], where highly variable morphology
defies classification into discrete species groups. Porites
provide a major structural component of coral reefs
worldwide and are among the most ecologically important (in terms of abundance, global distribution, and variety of habitats occupied) yet taxonomically challenging
genera of reef building coral.

Results
Three hundred and seven ITS region sequences from 91
individual coral colonies were aligned and compared
(Table 1). Redundant (99% identical or higher) ITS region
sequences within each individual were omitted from the
alignments, leaving 188 sequences for phylogenetic analysis. The non-gap coded ITS alignment was 895 sites long,
with 440 variable and 317 parsimony informative sites.
Coding gaps resulted in no major changes in topology,
but resulted in slightly higher clade support values for
some deeper nodes (not shown). Pair-wise nucleotide distance between sequences within individual colonies was
uniformly low (mean intra-genomic distance = 0.005 ±
0.001 SE). Pair-wise nucleotide distance between individuals within significant clades (mean intra-specific distance = 0.009 ± 0.002 SE), was an order of magnitude
lower than the distance between significant clades (mean
inter-specific distance = 0.118 ± 0.005 SE).
ITS phylograms supported traditional species designations, with the exception of four Pacific clades: I, II, III and
V (Figure 1). Branching and mounding morphospecies
were genetically indistinguishable within these clades, yet
deep genetic differences were observed in corals with very
similar colony morphology and corallite appearance.
Clade I contained both branching and mounding morphospecies collected across a broad geographic range
(Caribbean, Eastern Pacific, Hawaii, Indo-West Pacific).
Branching morphospecies (P. cylindrica, P. compressa, P.
duerdeni, and P. annae) were genetically indistinguishable
from each other, and from mounding morphospecies (P.
lobata, and P. solida). P. compressa and P. duerdeni are
thought to be endemic to Hawaii [37], yet they exhibited
no fixed differences from other samples in Clade I. Both
colony and corallite-level characters appeared highly variable within this clade. Corallite-level characters such as
number or size of pali, free or fused triplets (see [4] for an
illustration of taxonomic characters) were highly variable,
often within the same colony, although all Clade I specimens tended to have relatively high corallite walls (Figure
2). Clade I exhibited morphological variation that often
overlapped and obscured Clades II, and V. Clade I corallite appearance ranged from P. solida-like (large deep calyx,

pali, fused triplet) at opposite ends of a spectrum with P.
lobata-like morphology as an intermediate.
Clade II also contained a mixture of branching and
mounding corals (mounding P. evermanni from Hawaii,
P. sp from Panama, and branching P. annae from Samoa
and Hawaii). P. evermanni is either thought to be a Hawaiian endemic [4], or a synonym of P. lutea [37]. P. evermanni
was
genetically
indistinguishable
and
morphologically very similar to P. sp from Panama, and
genetically indistinguishable from the branching Samoan
P. annae, yet it was deeply divergent from P. lutea from
Samoa (Clade V). Traditional corallite-level characters in
Clade II were similar to some individuals in the highly
variable Clade I; however, scanning electron microscopy
revealed subtle differences between Clade II and other
clades; walls, denticles, pali, and columella tended to have
similar height, with more evenly spaced and deeper interstitial holes (Figure 2).
Clade III contained P. monticulosa and P. rus, which are so
distinct at the corallite level that they have been consid-

ered to belong to a separate subgenus (Synarea). Clade III
was, unexpectedly, a closely related sister group to Clade
II. Clade IV contained P. brighami (only one individual), a
species that forms small (< 10 centimeters diameter) gray
colonies with deep funnel-like calices. Clade V consisted
primarily of P. lutea from Samoa (including an extremely
large colony, approximately 19 m in diameter) and an
individual identified as P. lobata that was genetically distinct from other Clade V individuals. Clade VI consisted of
P. sp2, a putative new species that forms small colonies
with stout small branches and shallow calices. Clade VII
contained two sub-clades of P. astreoides; one contained
individuals from Belize, the Gulf of Mexico, and Brazil,
while the other contained individuals from Brazil and
Panama. Clade VIII contained P. lichen from Samoa, with
two divergent ITS sequence types with one intermediate
(possibly recombinant) sequence. Clade IX consisted of P.
hawaiiensis (which is referred to as P.cf.bernardi by Fenner
[37]), a brooding species with crawling larvae (pers. obs.)
that forms very small (< 10 centimeters in diameter)
encrusting colonies. Clade X contained a monophyletic
group of P. divaricata from Belize, nested within P. furcata
from Panama (NJ trees, not shown, show weakly sup-

ported reciprocally monophyletic groups). Clade XI contained reciprocally monophyletic groups of P. sverdrupi
from Mexico, and P. panamensis from the Pacific coast of
Panama. Clade XII contained only P. colonensis from the
Atlantic coast of Panama.
Nuclear and mitochondrial data sets had a very similar
overall topology (Figure 3). The COI alignment consisted
of 638 sites, 38 of which were variable, and 22 were parsimony informative. The 'putative control region' alignment had 293 sites, 41 of which were variable, and 13
were parsimony informative. A partition homogeneity
test indicated no significant differences between the mitochondrial and ITS data sets (missing and ambiguous characters excluded, p = 0.349; included, p = 0.298). The ITS
tree had longer branch lengths, more significant groups,

and fewer polytomies than the mitochondrial tree. The
mitochondrial data supported many of the same clades as
the ITS data sets, although there was some discordance
between nuclear and mitochondrial trees, particularly
within Clade I. Clade I and II in the mitochondrial tree
were more consistent with divisions between branching
and mounding morphologies, although not reciprocally
monophyletic and not supported by NJ and MP trees (Figure 3). The mitochondrial data were unable to resolve P.
sp.2, P. lichen, and P. hawaiiensis, whereas the ITS data
showed deep divergence between the three taxa.

Discussion
In contrast to most molecular studies on corals, the
present study finds clear genetic breaks and deep divergence between many congeneric species, which is likely to

have resulted from taxonomic sampling across a comparatively broad range of evolutionary divergence, and geographic regions. The majority of genetic breaks are
consistent with morphospecies designations, with the
exception of three Pacific clades (Clade I, II and V) that
exhibit highly variable colony morphology. Several shallow Pacific clades contained both branching and mounding varieties that were genetically indistinguishable.
Conversely, specimens that appeared very similar (matching the species description of P. lutea) sorted into several
clades that were deeply genetically divergent.
Corallite-level traits appeared more broadly consistent
with genetic groups although these traits also exhibited
rapid evolution and high variability, particularly within
Clade I and between Clade I, II, and III. P. monticulosa and
P. rus are so distinct from other Porites at the corallitelevel, that Verrill [38] placed them into a separate subgenus (Synarea); therefore it was surprising that Clade III
was not more distantly related to other Porites, but it illustrates how evolutionarily labile corallite morphology can
be. Most molecular studies on corals have echoed similar
findings that skeletal morphology is a poor indicator of
underlying biodiversity. Morphology has been shown to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/45

be deceiving from species to family levels [e.g. [35,3]].
Fukami et al. [3] found unexpected morphological convergence at the family level that obscured deep divergence
between the Atlantic and Pacific. Although divergence was
deep between Atlantic and Pacific Porites, there was no
clustering by oceanic region observed in this study, perhaps because the genus is ancient and was able to persist
through regional mass extinction, and can survive conditions in the far Eastern Pacific, where few other corals
exist.
It is difficult to determine if the highly evolutionarily flexible skeletal morphology observed in Clades I and II
results from hybridization, incipient speciation, polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, or a combination thereof.
Discordance between the nuclear and mitochondrial data
within Clade I (Figure 3) could be due to hybridization
and nuclear introgression between several distinct maternal lineages, or recent speciation and contrasting rates of
lineage sorting, or an artifact of differences in phylogenetic resolution among molecular markers. Hybridization
or incipient speciation would be expected to result in less
continuous trait variation than polymorphism or phenotypic plasticity. Vaughan [39] described 20 formae of P.
compressa and 6 formae of P. lobata. P. compressa formae
varied "continuously" from a semi-mounding form with
a knobby surface to long slender branches, and P. lobata
contained variation that was "enormous and bewildering". Although branching varieties in Clade I tend to occur
more frequently in shallow water, both morphotypes frequently co-occur side-by-side in the same habitat. Further
work is necessary to determine if these morphologically
flexible clades represent hybrid or incipient species complexes, or if skeletal morphology is phenotypically plastic
and/or a polymorphic trait maintained by natural selection in a heterogeneous environment.
This study represents important progress towards understanding the evolution and biodiversity of corals, and provides a foundation for future work. The genus Porites
provides an excellent study system; it is abundant and
ubiquitous in the tropics with an excellent fossil record,
and corallite level characters that are well suited for quantitative morphometric analysis [40,41]. Future corallitelevel morphometric work is likely to be highly informative about the nature of morphological variation observed
in Clade I and II, and provide a means to test various alternative hypotheses and provide insights into coral evolution and biodiversity. The phylogenetic work is also an
important starting point for studying the evolution of a
variety of traits; for example, it is interesting to note that
Clades I-V tend to contain broadcast spawning species
such as P. lobata, P. compressa, and P. cylindrica, while
Clades VI-XII tend to contain brooding species such as P.
astreoides, P. porites, and P. hawaiiensis. This study also

raises questions about the endemic status of several species, and demonstrates that patterns of biodiversity in this
group are not as they appear and are in need of reevaluation. The range of P. evermanni may extend beyond
Hawaii, because genetically indistinguishable and morphologically similar corals were found in Panama. Likewise, the Hawaiian endemics, P. compressa and P. duerdeni,
were not genetically distinct and are morphologically very
similar to more widespread branching species (P. cylindrica and P. annae). The putative new species P. sp2. is one
of the most common varieties in American Samoa, but it
was not previously known if it was genetically distinct.
This study demonstrates that our understanding of coral

biodiversity may be obscured by deceptive patterns of
morphological variation.

Conclusion
Untangling the coral 'species problem' will require a variety of tools and multiple lines of evidence. Here, we demonstrate that integration of taxonomy with analysis of
multiple molecular markers reveals cryptic patterns of
species diversity within the genus Porites. Cytochrome c
oxidase subunit 1 (COI) has very low levels of polymorphism and has limitations as a useful tool for delimitating
coral species [42]; however, it was informative when combined and compared in a multiple marker approach. The

ITS region was particularly informative in this genus, and
can be a valuable tool for elucidating patterns of evolution
and biodiversity in corals. Since coral ecosystems are
increasingly threatened, there is a need to characterize and
understand coral species in terms of interbreeding groups
as opposed to nominal morphological units. Our
approach shows that morphological characters previously
thought capable of delineating species must be reexamined to accurately understand patterns of evolution, endemism, and biodiversity in reef-building coral. Species
definitions based solely on evolutionarily labile, polymorphic, or phenotypically plastic traits are likely to be
misleading and confound attempts to identify, understand, and conserve coral biodiversity or to recognize its
loss.

Methods
Samples were collected by, or in consultation with individuals who are considered to be taxonomic authorities
for a given geographic region. Voucher specimens were
compared to museum type specimens and original species
descriptions when possible. Sample identifications generally followed Veron [4]; however, since misidentification
is a major problem in this genus, identifications should be
considered tentative until the genus is revised, or until
morphometric analysis (e.g. [40,41]) can verify similarity
to type specimens. Voucher specimens and photographs
are available upon request. Scanning electron microscope
(SEM) images were obtained to examine selected samples
of interest in further detail. Voucher collection, DNA
extraction, PCR, cloning and sequencing methods were
followed as described previously [21,23]. All samples
were sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions. Several new primers were designed for this study
with the aid of Primer 3 v 0.4.0 [43]. The primers amplify
the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene
(ZCO1 5'-TCA ACT AAT CAT AAA GAT ATT GGT ACG-3',
ZCO1R 5'-TAA ACC TCT GGA TGC CCA AA-3') and the
nuclear ribosomal ITS region (ITSZ1 5'-TAA AAG TCG
TAA CAA GGT TTC CGT A-3', ITSZ2 5'-CCT CCG CTT ATT
GAT ATG CTT AAA T-3'). The "putative mitochondrial
control region" was amplified with primers from Volmer
& Palumbi [6]. Sample locations, collector, and GenBank
accession numbers are listed in Table 1; AY320289–
AY320352, AY322575–AY322612, and AY458021–
AY458063, were from previous work [23]. Two hundred
and eighty four sequences were cloned and twenty-three
sequences were direct sequenced from 91 individual coral
colonies (there were few nucleotide differences between
sequences that were cloned or direct sequenced from the
same coral colony), averaging 3.4 sequences per individual. The mitochondrial markers had very low levels of polymorphism and did not amplify well in all samples,
therefore only a few representative individuals were
sequenced from each ITS group.

Phylogenetic Analysis
The ITS sequences were aligned using the default parameters in MUSCLE v3.6 [44]. Gaps were coded as present or
absent using the 'simple' gap coding method employed in
GapCoder v1.0 [45]. Preliminary analysis (not shown)
indicated that including coded gaps slightly increased
bootstrap support for some deeper clades, with no major
changes in topology. The complete ITS data set was run for
10 million generations in MrBayes 3.1.2 [46], until the
standard deviation of the split frequencies was below
0.01, with a burn-in period of 2.5 million generations.
Neighbor Joining (NJ), and Maximum Parsimony (MP)
trees were generated in PAUP*4.01b.10 [47] with 1000
bootstrap replicates. NJ trees used the BioNJ method with
the ML distance model selected in Modeltest V.3.7 [48].
ML models were selected by the Akaike information criterion for the nuclear (GTR+I+G) and mitochondrial
(K81uf+G) partitions. In order to compare ITS and mitochondrial data sets, inclusive consensus sequences of all
ITS molecular clones for 36 individuals that were successfully sequenced for both mitochondrial gene regions were
generated in BioEdit v7.0.5.2 [49]. The three data partitions were concatenated, and compared using the incongruence length difference (ILD) test, implemented as
partition homogeneity in PAUP*4.01b.10 [47]. The TBR
branch swapping method was used with 1000 replications, random addition for 3 replicates, nchuck = 2,
chuckscore = 1. Nuclear and mitochondrial data partitions were each run for 2 million generations in MrBayes
3.1.2 [46], with a burn-in of 5 hundred thousand generations. MEGA 4.0 [50] was used to estimate pair-wise
genetic distance and to visualize phylogenetic trees.
