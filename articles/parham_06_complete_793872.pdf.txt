Abstract
Background: The big-headed turtle (Platysternon megacephalum) from east Asia is the sole living
representative of a poorly-studied turtle lineage (Platysternidae). It has no close living relatives, and
its phylogenetic position within turtles is one of the outstanding controversies in turtle systematics.
Platysternon was traditionally considered to be close to snapping turtles (Chelydridae) based on
some studies of its morphology and mitochondrial (mt) DNA, however, other studies of
morphology and nuclear (nu) DNA do not support that hypothesis.
Results: We sequenced the complete mt genome of Platysternon and the nearly complete mt
genomes of two other relevant turtles and compared them to turtle mt genomes from the
literature to form the largest molecular dataset used to date to address this issue. The resulting
phylogeny robustly rejects the placement of Platysternon with Chelydridae, but instead shows that
it is a member of the Testudinoidea, a diverse, nearly globally-distributed group that includes pond
turtles and tortoises. We also discovered that Platysternon mtDNA has large-scale gene
rearrangements and possesses two, nearly identical, control regions, features that distinguish it
from all other studied turtles.
Conclusion: Our study robustly determines the phylogenetic placement of Platysternon and
provides a well-resolved outline of major turtle lineages, while demonstrating the significantly
greater resolving power of comparing large amounts of mt sequence over that of short fragments.
Earlier phylogenies placing Platysternon with chelydrids required a temporal gap in the fossil record
that is now unnecessary. The duplicated control regions and gene rearrangements of the
Platysternon mtDNA probably resulted from the duplication of part of the genome and then the
subsequent loss of redundant genes. Although it is possible that having two control regions may
provide some advantage, explaining why the control regions would be maintained while some of
the duplicated genes were eroded, examples of this are rare. So far, duplicated control regions have
been reported for mt genomes from just 12 clades of metazoans, including Platysternon.

Background
Molecular studies have made significant contributions to
our understanding of higher-level turtle evolutionary relationships [1-3], but there are still some areas of uncertainty or apparent conflict between data sets. One of the
major outstanding issues is the placement of the enigmatic "big-headed turtle" of Asia (Platysternon megacephalum; Fig. 1). Platysternon megacephalum is the sole living
representative of a poorly-studied turtle lineage (Platysternidae), and its phylogenetic position within turtles is not
easily established. It ranges from Myanmar, Thailand,
Laos, and Vietnam to southern China where it inhabits
rocky mountain streams. Platysternon feeds on a variety of
prey, including freshwater crustaceans and molluscs. To
effect this durophagous diet, Platysternon has evolved
powerful jaw muscles and a correspondingly hypertrophied cranium. In addition to its large head, it also has an
unusually long tail for a turtle.
Two hypotheses are the strongest contenders for the phylogenetic position of Platysternon, with proponents of each
position coming from molecular and morphological systematists. Based on some studies of its morphology
[1,4,5] and mitochondrial DNA [1], Platysternon has been
phylogenetically linked to New World snapping turtles
(Chelydridae; Fig. 2). Indeed, Platysternon and chelydrids
(two extant species) are superficially similar since both
have large heads and long tails. However, other morphological comparisons [6-8] and studies of serology [9] have
supported a relationship to the more diverse (~150 extant
species) group that includes pond turtles and tortoises
(Testudinoidea). Testudinoids are found on all continents
except Australia and Antarctica, but are particularly
diverse in Asia and North America.
Multiple studies have differed in the placement of Platysternon, with the results contrasted in Figure 2. Recent studies of the phylogenetic position of Platysternon using
nuDNA (RAG-1 and U17 snoRNA) strongly supported
testudinoid affinities [2,3]. One of these studies [3] gave a
detailed review of the conflicting signals from other data
sets (mtDNA and morphology). These authors acknowledged the dissenting voices on the "Platysternon as a chelydrid" scheme from morphologists, but it should be noted
that all such morphological hypotheses were not proposed in an explicit cladistic framework. Meanwhile, the
most recent cladistic analysis of osteological characters
[10] could not resolve the position of Platysternon beyond
placing it in the same major clade (Cryptodira) that
includes most extant turtle lineages including the testudinoids and chelydrids, but also softshell turtles (Trionychia), mud turtles (Kinosternoidea), and sea turtles
(Chelonioidea). The combined phylogenetic analysis of
short sequences of mtDNA (fragments of cob and rrnS)
placed Platysternon next to chelydrids [1].

tail.

In order to pursue a definitive resolution of this issue, we
sequenced the complete mt genome of Platysternon and
nearly complete mt genome of a chelydrid and kinosternoid and compared these data to mt genomes published
for other turtle lineages. In the process, we discovered several unusual mt genomic features that further distinguish
this enigmatic turtle. We describe these genomic features
and review the phylogenetic position of Platysternon.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic position of Platysternon
Our phylogenetic analyses of 7.2–16.2 kilobases (kb) of
mtDNA for 12 turtles (>182 kb total) using maximum
parsimony (MP, L = 19481), Bayesian inference (BI, harmonic mean -lnL = 94787.18), and maximum likelihood
(ML, -lnL = 95683.6880) methods place Platysternon
within Testudinoidea (Fig. 2, 3). Although the MP bootstrap values for testudinoid affinities are not strong, the
traditional hypothesis linking Platysternon with Chelydridae was rejected by statistical tests of hypothesis compatibility (MP, Wilcoxon signed ranks test: L difference = 68,
z = -2.2489, p = 0.0245; ML, SH test: -lnL difference =
38.5531, p = 0.0336). Although our tree agrees with the
nuDNA [2,3] in refuting an affinity to Chelydrids and
placing Platysternon firmly within Testudinoidea, our
results differ by weakly placing Platysternon as sister to the
Emydidae rather than sister to Testuguria. While MP constraint searches that retained only those trees wherein
Platysternon is sister to the Testuguria are significantly
longer than the unconstrained estimate of turtle phylogeny (Wilcoxon signed ranks test: L difference = 62, z = 2.0769, p < 0.0001), identical ML constraint searches
failed to produce topologies that were significantly worse
solutions than the unconstrained ML tree (SH test:
15.4560, p = 0.264). Furthermore, the placement of
Platysternon with Testuguria received weak nodal support

Mt genomic
Mt genomic features of Platysternon. Typical arrangement of vertebrate mitochondrial genes including a single control
region compared to that of Platysternon. All genes are transcribed from left to right except where indicated by arrows. The
genes that are rearranged in Platysternon are indicated in bold while the duplicated control regions are designated by numerals
(cr1, cr2). The grey boxes in the Platysternon genome represent non-coding regions (perhaps degraded duplicated copies of
genes) that are not present in typical vertebrate mt genomes. This figure illustrates how sequences from two non-adjacent
regions were inserted between trnI and trnQ.

in the nuDNA studies (52 or <50 MP bootstrap) [2,3] so
the difference here is not seen as an important conflict
between mtDNA and nuDNA. Other conflicts between
the mtDNA and nuDNA involve the outgroups of Testudinoidea within Cryptodira, though both agree that Trionychia is the most basal cryptodiran clade [1,3] (Fig. 2).
Where the nuDNA phylogenies differ from our tree, the
nodal support in the nuDNA studies is either weak (<50
MP bootstrap) or else the topology differs depending on
which phylogenetic method of searching was used. As
would be expected, a combined analysis (MP, L = 21819;
BI, harmonic mean -lnL = 103,332.71) can not resolve
these conflicts (Fig. 4). Additional large mtDNA
sequences as well as those from additional nuDNA markers may help resolve these discrepancies.
Our phylogeny reconciles the previous conflict between
mtDNA and nuDNA [2] by agreeing with the nuDNA data
that Platysternon is a testudinoid. The fact that our large mt
alignment results in a phylogenetic hypothesis that is congruent with the nuDNA rather than the analyses based on
small (< 5 kb) mt sequences highlights the utility of generating large mt sequences for higher-level systematics
[11]. Because independent genetic markers (mtDNA and
nuDNA) support testudinoid affinities, and there is no
strong morphological argument for chelydrid affinities
[10], the continued recognition of Platysternon as a chelydrid is no longer tenable.

The paleontological record is consistent with the "Platysternon as a testudinoid" hypothesis. The oldest fossil
referred to the stem lineage of Platysternon (the Platysternidae), are from the Paleogene of Asia (55–60 mya)
[12,13], at about the same time we find the oldest testudinoids [14,15]. Chelydrids, on the other hand, are significantly more ancient, extending back into the middle
Cretaceous (~90 mya) [16]. Consequently, the recognition of Platysternon as a testudinoid alleviates a major temporal disparity of ~30 million years. Despite this apparent
congruence, it is important to realize that the reported fossil record of platysternids is poor and in need of review
and confirmation [17]. The described material from Asia
is based largely on fragmentary specimens that have not
been subjected to rigorous phylogenetic analysis
[12,13,18-21]. Meanwhile, potentially relevant fossil
specimens of possible platysternids in Europe [22] and
North America ("Emydid C" [14]) have been mentioned
in the literature, but have not been adequately described.
The possibility of early platysternids in North America is
especially intriguing because our study supports a sister
relationship to Chrysemys, our representative of the largely
North American clade Emydidae. However, until more
specimens are brought to light, the paleontological perspective on platysternid origins remains highly speculative.
Genomic features of Platysternon mtDNA
The mtDNAs of vertebrates almost universally contain the
same set of 37 genes plus a large, non-coding portion

Page 6 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:11

commonly called the "control region" because it contains
signals that regulate transcription and replication [23].
Gene rearrangements are not unheard of, but are very
uncommon. The mitochondrial genome of Platysternon is
unusual by having large-scale gene rearrangements and a
duplication of the control region (Fig. 5), the two copies
of which share 808 nucleotides of identical sequence, and
beyond which have no apparent sequence similarity. One
of these non-coding regions (1,134 bp) occupies the typical position of the control region (cr) and so we call this
"cr1" and the other (1,140 bp) we call "cr2." The ~1,100
bp paralogs have 808 identical positions in the middle
that are flanked on either side by polymorphic sequences.
One protein coding gene (nad5) and five tRNA genes are
in derived positions. These have transposed from two portions of the genome (trnH, trnS, trnL, nad5 and trnT, trnP,
cr) that are ancestrally near to one another, but separated
by nad6, trnE, cob (Fig. 5). In Platysternon, both of these
regions are inserted between trnI and trnQ, are separated
by a block of non-coding sequence. This is the first true
gene rearrangement reported for a turtle. In the pancake
tortoise, Malacochersus, the cr and trnF are duplicated [24];
however, since the second cr of the pancake tortoise is
highly degraded, the two trnF are essentially adjacent (i.e.,
no coding regions are out of sequence). The translocation
of the cr and mt genes to between trnI and trnQ is interesting because this is the same position that contains a duplicated cr and rearranged tRNA genes in another reptile
clade, the advanced snakes [25], and because this has
been noted otherwise as a rearrangement "hot spot."
The arrangement of the Platysternon genome can be modelled by the "duplication-random loss" model [26]
whereby a duplication and transposition of part of the
genome occurred, then additional rearrangements
resulted from the loss of supernumerary genes. Since the
transposed genes in Platysternon are ancestrally separated
by only a block of three genes, it may be that the originally
duplicated and transposed region included the entire portion from trnH through the cr. This observation bolsters
speculation that the non-coding region now found
between nad5 and trnT is the degenerating vestige of what
was the duplicated nad6, trnE, and/or cob and, similarly,
that the non-coding region between nad4 and nad6 is the
vestige of a copy of trnH, trnS, trnL, and/or nad5. The study
of recent duplication events demonstrates that when parts
of the genome are duplicated, redundant sequences are
rapidly lost [27], and cr duplications have been otherwise
associated with gene rearrangements [28].
It is unusual that there should be two similar control
regions in Platysternon, and uncertain whether this indicates a very recent duplication, maintenance by selection,
or some error correction mechanism resulting in their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/11

evolving in concert. Duplicated control regions have previously been reported for just 11 clades spanning the
diversity of Metazoa [25,28-30]. Some experimental data
suggest that mt genomes with two crs have a selective
advantage in replication over those with one cr [32], but
there are clearly cases where one copy of a duplicated cr is
degrading [24,28,33].
The maintenance of duplicated sequences is not restricted
to crs. A recent study reported seven instances from
diverse metazoans, in which reported sequences of coding
regions were duplicated [24]. To this we can add the
duplication of trnK in the reptile Sphenodon [29]. Whether
all of these duplications represent cases of stable functional redundancy in coding regions or merely result from
recent duplications and have not degraded into pseudogenes remains to be tested.

Conclusion
Platysternon is not related to chelydrids, but is instead a
member of the Testudinoidea, the group that includes
pond turtles and tortoises. Testudinoids diversified rapidly in Asia and North America during the Paleogene (50–
60 mya) [14,15]. Additional taxon sampling will help
establish the phylogeny for extant testudinoids, including
whether Platysternon is actually more closely related to
emydids or testugurians. However, the best understanding of the timing and geography of this radiation will
require the additional description and analysis of important, but neglected, fossil specimens.
The features of the Platysternon mitochondrial genome
expand our knowledge of variation within vertebrate
mitochondrial genomes, adding a new case of duplicated
control regions. Moreover, the unusual mt genome of
Platysternon and the pancake tortoise (Malacochersus [24])
are good examples of how additional sequencing of turtle
mt genomes can improve our knowledge of mitochondrial variation and evolution. At the time of this writing,
just ~6% of turtle diversity (18 of ~300 species) have large
(> 5 kb) mt sequences reported (16 of these are complete).

Methods
Laboratory protocols
Our new sequences are derived from three museum specimens: 1) Platysternon megacephalum (MVZ 230486) from
Hainan Island, China; 2) Chelydra serpentina (MVZ
137436) from North Carolina, USA; 3) Kinosternon flavescens (MVZ 164999) from Texas, USA. Genomic DNA was
extracted from frozen liver using the Qiagen QIAamp tissue kit. Amplification of genomic DNA was conducted
using rTth long PCR enzyme (Applied Biosystems) with a
denaturation at 94°C for 15 sec, annealing at 46–50°C for
20 sec, and extension at 68°C for 60 sec for a total of 38

species: K. flavescens (B-I), C. serpentina (A-G, C-H, D-J), P.
megacephalum (A-G, C-H, D-J, E-F).
Amplification products were sheared randomly into fragments of approximately 1.5 kb by repeated passage
through a narrow aperture using a Hydroshear device.
After end-repair, the sheared DNA was gel purified, ligated
into a plasmid vector, and then transformed into bacterial
cells to construct a library of random fragments. Automated colony pickers introduced single clones into bacterial broth with 10% glycerol in 384-well format. We
sequenced 96 or 192 clones per amplification for 192–
576 clones per species (192 for K. flavescens, 384 for C. serpentina, 576 for P. megacephalum). These plasmid clones
were processed robotically for rolling circle amplification
[34,35]. Sequencing reactions and reaction cleanup were
done using SPRI [36]. Sequences were determined using
ABI3730xl DNA sequencers and then were assembled
based on overlap to form deep contigs 5X->50X).
Phylogenetic analyses and hypothesis testing
The three new DNA sequences (Platysternon [GenBank# =
DQ_256377, 19,043 bp complete mt genome], Chelydra
[DQ_256378, 14,567 bp sequence from rrnS to cob position 415], Kinosternon [DQ_256379, 7,288 bp sequence
from trnL(taa) to trnR]) were aligned manually with those
from nine other species from GenBank (Chelonia
Chrysemys
[NC_002073], Dogania
[NC_000886],
[NC_002780], Geochelone [DQ_080041], Manouria
[DQ_080040], Mauremys/"Chinemys" [NC_006082], Pelodiscus [NC_006132], Pelomedusa [NC_001947], Testudo
[DQ_080049]). With the exception of Platysternon, no
noteworthy, unusual genomic features were found in the
new sequences. However, we did note that Kinosternon
lacks the "extra" nucleotide that causes a translational
frameshift in nad3 in all other turtles where known
[24,37].

For our alignment, protein-coding genes were constrained
to align by codon and tRNA-coding genes were constrained to align by regions of potential secondary struc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/11

ture [38]. We excluded highly-variable regions that were
difficult to align including the control region, 225 positions from other non-coding regions, 79 positions of rrnS,
and 317 positions of rrnL. A total of 170 positions were
excluded from the alignment of tRNA genes: the D-loop
region was excluded from trnH, trnS, trnL(taa); and both
the D- and T-loop regions were excluded from trnF, trnV,
trnI, trnW, trnK, trnR, trnT, and trnP. We excluded a total
of 151 positions from the protein coding gene nad5. The
final alignment contains 15,289 positions and provides
4,901 parsimony informative characters.
We used maximum parsimony (MP) [39], maximum likelihood (ML) [40], and Bayesian inference (BI) [41] phylogenetic methods to infer phylogenetic trees. We
conducted the MP and ML analyses with PAUP* 4.0b10
[42] and BI analyses with MrBayes 3.1.1 [43,44]. We executed MP analyses with the branch and bound search
option, which guarantees an exact solution. To assess
nodal support for the MP analysis, we used the bootstrap
resampling method [45] employing 1000 pseudoreplicates of heuristic searches using TBR branch swapping and
100 random sequence additions pseudoreplication in
PAUP*. We also obtained decay indices (="branch support") [46] for all nodes.
To determine the most appropriate model of DNA substitution for reconstructing turtle relationships under ML,
we evaluated the fit of various models of molecular evolution to our data via the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) [47] with the program Modeltest 3.06 [48]. We performed ML analyses under the optimal model (GTR + I +
G) with the heuristic search algorithm using TBR branch
swapping with 10 random sequence additions, simultaneously estimating parameter values (with 10 Γ rate categories) and tree topology (i.e., no initial parameter estimates
or starting tree). We then successively re-estimated parameter values and searched for trees until we obtained a stable topology and ML score [49].
We also performed ML-based BI analyses to search for
additional tree topologies. Because MrBayes can perform
mixed model phylogenetic analyses using different models of evolution [44] we assessed the best fit model of evolution for each mtDNA gene via the AIC with the program
MrModeltest 2.1 [50]. However, to avoid over-parameterization, we combined mitochondrial loci into the same
data partition if they belonged to the same functional type
(either rRNA, tRNA, or protein coding DNA) and conformed to the same model of evolution. This resulted in

trnS(nct) = HKY+I; (12) trnI, trnL(taa), trnW = K80+G.
We then performed mixed-model BI tree searches, allowing separate parameter estimates under the chosen models of DNA substitution for each data partition. We did
not specify nucleotide substitution model parameters or a
topology a priori. We ran BI analyses for 3 × 106 generations using the default temperature (0.2) with four
Markov chains per generation, sampling trees every 100
generations. We then computed a 50% majority rule consensus tree after excluding those trees sampled prior to the
stable equilibrium (after the first 1 × 105 generations).
Nodal support is given by the frequency of the recovered
clade, which corresponds to the posterior probability of
that clade under the assumed models of sequence evolution [43,51].
We assessed the congruence between our hypothesized
placement of Platysternon and those proposed by other
molecular genetic analyses using constraint searches and
subsequent topology tests in PAUP*. First, we constrained
the MP and ML searches to retain only those trees with a
Platysternon + Chelydra clade, consistent with previous
mtDNA analyses [1]. Second, we constrained the MP and
ML searches to retain only those trees with a Platysternon +
Testuguria clade, consistent with a previous nuDNA analysis [3]. We then compared the constrained and unconstrained MP estimates of turtle phylogeny using a twotailed Wilcoxon signed-ranks test [52], and compared the
constrained and unconstrained ML phylogenies using a
one-tailed multiple-comparisons likelihood ratio test [53]
with 1000 RELL bootstrap pseudoreplicates.
Finally, we also performed phylogenetic analyses of a data
matrix that combined our mtDNA data with nuDNA from
two relevant studies [2,3]. The combined analyses were
performed using the same parameters used for the
mtDNA analyses given above and with the models for the
nuDNA specified in those other studies [2,3]. Because
there is non-overlapping taxonomic coverage between the
three studies (ours and the two nuclear studies) we had to
use Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that had data
from more than one species. These "chimeras" are a major
problem in turtle systematics, especially in paleontological studies where the inclusion of broadly paraphyletic
OTUs is a recurring phenomenon [10]. We tried to avoid
this problem by combining nuDNA and mtDNA
sequences from only the most closely related taxa to
ensure that our OTUs would be monophyletic with
respect to one another. The one exception is the trionychids. In that case we combined the RAG-1 sequence for
Apalone with the large mt sequence from Pelodiscus (no
U17 snoRNA data is available for any trionychid). This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/11

combination was arbitrary since Apalone is just as closely
related to Dogania as Pelodiscus, but this should not impact
our results since all studies agree on the phylogentic position of these taxa within Cryptodira. The following list
gives the OTU name used in Figure 5 followed by the
accession numbers for the nuDNA sequences used (EMBL
number for U17 snoRNA, GenBank number RAG-1):
Pelomedusa (AJ306565, AY687922), Trionychidae [Dogania (no nuDNA), Pelodiscus (no U17 snoRNA, AY687901
from Apalone), the analyses were run with two separate trionychid OTUs and they were collapsed into a single terminal in Figure 5], Kinosternidae (AJ306562, AY687911
from Sternotherus), Chelydra (AJ306559, AY687906), Chelonia (AJ493419, AY687907), Emydidae [mtDNA from
Chrysemys, nuDNA from Trachemys (AJ306564,
AY687915)], Platysternon (AJ493418, AY687905), Geoemydidae [mtDNA and RAG-1 from Mauremys
(AY687914), U17 snoRNA from Cuora (AJ493422)],
Manouria (no nuDNA), Geochelone (AJ306561,
AY687912), Testudo (AJ306563, no RAG-1).
Phylogenetic taxonomy
Most of the suprageneric clade names used in this study
are based on a recent review of phylogenetic nomenclature for turtles [54]. We follow all of the protocols of that
study with the exception of italicizing phylogeneticallydefined clade names. Although most of the relevant phylogenetic definitions can be found in that study, a few
names require additional discussion. For example, the
first worker to hypothesize a close affinity of Platysternon
and testudinoids [6] also coined the name Cryptoderinea
to accommodate this grouping. Cryptoderinea has been
phylogenetically codified, but can only be considered
valid if Platysternon is sister to Testudinoidea [54]. If Platysternon is nested within Testudinoidea, as proposed here
and in other genetic studies [2,3], then Playsternon should
be considered a testudinoid and the name Cryptoderinea
should not be used [54].

Secondly, the phylogenetically-defined name Bataguridae
was proposed for the testudinoid clade that include most
Asian hard-shelled turtles [54]. However, according to a
strict application of the rules of the International Congress of Zoological Nomenclature, there is an argument
for the use of the name Geoemydidae for the same clade.
In order to foster consensus during the transition from
Linnaean taxonomy [55] to PhyloCode [56], we use the
name Geoemydidae for this group.
Finally, despite the fact that a previous study [1] had proposed the name "Testudinoidae" for the clade that
includes geoemydids and testudinids, the phylogenetic
system used here [54] recommended using a new name,
Testuguria. Testuguria was coined because Testudinoidaewas deemed too phonetically similar to clade names of

the next higher and lower levels (Testudinoidea and Testudinidaerespectively). Although not explicitly listed as
an objective synonym of Testuguria, Testudinoidae was
given in the list of Testudo derivatives as an example of
what kind of names to avoid. It is important to note that
priority can not be invoked because, at the time of this
writing, there is no official starting date for the validity of
phylogenetically defined definitions. When the time
comes to codify these names there will have to be a discussion as to which name (Testuguria or Testudinoidae)
should be used. We strongly recommend the use of Testuguria for the reasons given above.
