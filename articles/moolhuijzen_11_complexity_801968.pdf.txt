Abstract
Background: Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Rmi) a major cattle ectoparasite and tick borne disease vector,
impacts on animal welfare and industry productivity. In arthropod research there is an absence of a complete
Chelicerate genome, which includes ticks, mites, spiders, scorpions and crustaceans. Model arthropod genomes
such as Drosophila and Anopheles are too taxonomically distant for a reference in tick genomic sequence analysis.
This study focuses on the de-novo assembly of two R. microplus BAC sequences from the understudied R microplus
genome. Based on available R. microplus sequenced resources and comparative analysis, tick genomic structure
and functional predictions identify complex gene structures and genomic targets expressed during tick-cattle
interaction.
Results: In our BAC analyses we have assembled, using the correct positioning of BAC end sequences and
transcript sequences, two challenging genomic regions. Cot DNA fractions compared to the BAC sequences
confirmed a highly repetitive BAC sequence BM-012-E08 and a low repetitive BAC sequence BM-005-G14 which
was gene rich and contained short interspersed elements (SINEs). Based directly on the BAC and Cot data
comparisons, the genome wide frequency of the SINE Ruka element was estimated. Using a conservative approach
to the assembly of the highly repetitive BM-012-E08, the sequence was de-convoluted into three repeat units, each
unit containing an 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoding gene sequence (rDNA), related internal
transcribed spacer and complex intergenic region.
In the low repetitive BM-005-G14, a novel gene complex was found between to 2 genes on the same strand.
Nested in the second intron of a large 9 Kb papilin gene was a helicase gene. This helicase overlapped in two
exonic regions with the papilin. Both these genes were shown expressed in different tick life stage important in
ectoparasite interaction with the host. Tick specific sequence differences were also determined for the papilin gene
and the protein binding sites of the 18S subunit in a comparison to Bos taurus.
Conclusion: In the absence of a sequenced reference genome we have assembled two complex BAC sequences,
characterised novel gene structure that was confirmed by gene expression and sequencing analyses. This is the
first report to provide evidence for 2 eukaryotic genes with exon regions that overlap on the same strand, the first
to describe Rhipicephalinae papilin, and the first to report the complete ribosomal DNA repeated unit sequence
structure for ticks. The Cot data estimation of genome wide sequence frequency means this research will underpin
future efforts for genome sequencing and assembly of the R. microplus genome.

Background
The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus
(Rmi), is one of the most economically important ticks
affecting the global cattle population [1]. Currently, Rmi
and its associated pathogens can be transmitted to cattle
and lead to severe agricultural losses in milk and beef
production and restrict the movement of livestock. The
most affected regions of the world are tropical and subtropical countries including northern Australia, Mexico,
South America and South Africa, with threats to USA
cattle populations at southern borders with Mexico [2].
The genome sizes of three species of ixodid ticks,
Ambylomma americanum [3], Boophilus (Rhipicephalus)
microplus and Ixodes scapularis (Isc) [4] have been estimated using Cot DNA reassociating kinetics, a procedure
also used to estimate repetitive DNA in genomes [4]. The
Rmi genome has an estimated size of 7.1 Gb, three times
the size of the Isc genome (2.3 Gb) [4,5]. The Rmi genome is found to be composed of foldback (FB), highly
repetitive (HR) and moderately repetitive (MR) elements,
in the following proportion 0.82% FB, 31% HR, 38% MR,
and 30% unique DNA, similar to Isc [4]. A short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) Ruka element, containing RNA polymerase III promoters, is major component
of eukaryotic genomes that are particularly abundant in
the heterochromatic compartment of vertebrates and
plants as reviewed Kidwell and Sunter [6,7]. SINE transposable elements have the ability to move to new locations based on reverse transcription prior to genomic
integration. Most SINEs are derived from tRNA [8],
although some, such as the Alu family which accounts
for approximately 10% of the human genome, are
thought to originate from 7SL RNA sequences [9]. It has
been shown in R. appendiculatus that secondary structure predictions indicate Ruka could adopt a tRNA structure similar to a serine tRNA [6].
The Isc Genome Project (IGP) [10,11], is the first tick
genome sequencing effort and currently a major resource
for tick comparative genomic analyses. This project has
influenced the rapid rise in the number of sequences for
tick DNA in NCBI [12]. The current Isc genome draft,
represented by 369,492 supercontigs, (1.7 Gb) of linear
genomic sequence was used in this analysis to identify
conservation with available Rmi genomic DNA.
To provide insights into the complexity of the tick
genome and that of specific BAC genes, the following
Rmi sequence resources were available for analysis. The
BmiGI Version 2 gene index [13] containing 13,643
non-redundant tentative consensus gene sequences. Rmi
Cot reassociating kinetics genomic sequence, that has
been demonstrated as a useful tool to explore the gene
space of large genome species [14]. A BAC end library,
created with the view to probe the Rmi genome for

BAC sequencing [15]. A suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) to identify transcripts associated with host
attachment and/or feeding, which identified both a large
increase in rRNA transcripts thought to be associated
increase protein production during tick feeding, and the
production of a number of enzymes including serine
protease inhibitors (Serpins) [16]. The results for these
analyses are described.

Results
Selection of BAC clones for gene content: Serpin and rRNA

In order to select BAC clones for sequencing, BAC end
sequences (BES) [17] were assessed against, the NCBI
CDD [18], the BmiGI [13,19,20], and the SSH transcripts
[16] (Additional file 1). The BAC clone BM-005-G14
(GenBank:HM748961) was identified in the BAC end analysis with significant alignment to a serpin conserved
domain (CDD) [18] cd00172. The second BAC BM-012E08 (GenBank:HM748964) was selected and sequenced
based on significant alignment to Rmi EST sequence
BEAE880F/R, a transcript highly expressed in tick
responding to cattle [16].
The following result section describes the genomic;
gene and comparative analyses for the BAC sequences
BM-005-G14 and BM-012-E08.
Analyses for BAC BM-005-G14: low repetitive, gene rich
genomic region
BAC assembly and analysis

The BAC clone BM-005-G14 was sequenced at 6.7× coverage (1,536 Sanger reads, insert size 135 Kb). The reads
were de novo assembled with phred/phrap [21] into six
contigs greater than 2 Kb and length 136,422 Kb. The BES
positioning in two contigs confirmed the correct contig
assembly. The final contig set was ordered and oriented by
read linkage results, BES positioning and gene annotations.
The BAC sequence was finished with gap closure into a
135 Kb genomic sequence (GenBank:HM748961). Gene
prediction and comparative analysis identified regions of
similarity to seven genes displayed in Figure 1. The forward strand contained: a papilin with a CDS length of
8,361 bp consisting of forty exons that span BAC sequence
position 2,190 to 88,307 bp; a helicase with a CDS length
of 4,800 bp consisting of four exons that span BAC
sequence position 6,015 to 14,766 bp; a hypothetical protein (H1) with a CDS length of 2,394 bp consisting of eleven exons that span BAC sequence position 93,878 to
10,9076 bp. On the complementary strand; a pogo transposable element with a CDS length of 615 bp consisting of
three exons that span BAC sequence position 49,728 to
50,977 bp; a hypothetical protein (H2) with a CDS length
of 720 bp consisting of two exons that span BAC sequence
position 110,728 to 111,698 bp; a hypothetical protein with

Figure 1 BAC BM-004-G14 (135 Kb) Gene Structure and Cot sequence frequency. Genes and Ruka elements (R1-R6) are displayed over a
heatmap of Cot sequence frequency (log2), blue (low) = 0 and red (high) = 10, genes include a papilin, a nested helicase-like protein, a pogo
element protein, two hypothetical proteins (H1 and H2), an endonuclease reverse transcriptase protein (ERT) and a serpin. Low complexity
regions are shown over the heatmap (green arrow). Exon overlaps are circled in read.

a CDS length of 2,931 bp consisting of eleven exons that
span BAC sequence position 112,452 to 122,035 bp. The
hypothetical protein was conserved to Isc and similar to
an endonuclease reverse transcriptase (ERT) in Bos taurus,
the predicted CDS also contained a serpin domain (see
later serine protease inhibitor result section). A final serpin
with a CDS length of 2,766 bp consisting of ten exons that
span BAC sequence position 123,297 to 133,688 bp
(Figure 1).
Two genes of particular interest to the study were the
serine protease inhibitor (serpin) (cd00172), originally
targeted to select this BAC sequence, and the large multiple domain papilin gene spanning approximately 90
Kbp of the 135 Kb BM-005-G14 BAC sequence. The
papilin an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that shares
a conserved protein domain order in orthologous genes
was then selected for further investigation.
Papilin and Helicase cDNA: resolving nested genes

A sequenced final papilin product of 8,761 bp, was
merged from three cloned products, the 5’ Race to primer AdamS_R1 product length of 867 bp, primer
regions papilin57383F to PapilinR3 product length 7,723
bp and pap12440F to pap13230R direct sequence product length 813 bp (primers can be found in Additional
file 2). The conserved domains are as follows: a Thrombospondin type 1 protein (TSP) domain (pfam00090)
positioned 349-510 bp, an ADAM-TS Spacer 1 positioned 823-1167 bp (pfam05986), a set of four TSP
domains in sequence positions 1204-1371,13871548,1561-1737,1724-1896 bp (pfam00090); ten BPT1/
Kunitz family domains (KU) (cd00109) serine protease
inhibitors can be found at positions 4654-4815,48314992, 5008-5169, 5185-5343, 5371-5532, 5545-5706,

5749-5907,5920-6081,6121-6279,6355-6510 bp; a whey
acidic protein-type four-disulphide core domain (WAP)
(pfam00095) in position 6901-7065 bp; a set of three
immunoglobulin family (IG) (pfam07679) domains in
positions 7198-7434, 7447-7680, 7864-8979; and a final
protease and lacunin domain (PLAC) (pfam08686) positioned in the 8110-8208 bp region. Nested in intron 2
of the papilin, and on the same coding strand, is the
helicase. This helicase gene overlapped exon regions
with papilin exons 2 and 3 (Figure 1). Helicase exon 3
position 9,987-10,727 bp and papilin exon2 position
10,625-10,727 bp share 102 bp. The second shared exon
region of 86 bp length was located between helicase
exon4 position 14680-14766 bp and papilin exon3 position 14,680-14,813 bp. The shared overlap regions,
circled in red in Figure 1, are shown in more detail in
the sequence alignment, Additional file 3.
The expression of the papilin and helicase were determined in a number of tick life stages.
Papilin and Helicase qRT-PCR: gene expression in tick life
stages

The gene expression fold change relative to pooled
cDNA for a number of life stages were tested for both
papilin and helicase genes. In quantitative real-time
PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, it was demonstrated that
expression of the papilin gene (white bar) was the strongest in tick larvae sensing and trying to attach to the
host (Figure 2). The helicase (white bar) shows greatest
up regulation in the ovaries of female ticks semiengorged (17 days old) attach to the host. The papilin
(grey bar) also showed differential up regulation in the
ovaries. Confirming differential expression in at least
two tick life stages tested.

are Helicase (white) and Papilin (grey).

As the papilin had increased expression in tick larvae
sensing and trying to attach to the host, sequence level
differences were examined between ixodid (tick) and
mammalian (host) species for this gene, which is important in host and tick interaction.

m000024) and B. taurus (XM_002700672.1) was summarised to view domain differences, see Figure 3. The
domain structure and number was closely conserved in the
invertebrate species. Of interest however, the helicase
domain nested in Rmi was also found in the Isc, the papilin
sequence is not found in the later release 1.1. The number
of conserved domains differed the greatest in Bos taurus
(GenBank: XP_002700718.1) as compared to Rmi. The full

papilin protein multiple sequence alignment between
R. microplus and Bos taurus (XP_002700718.1) can be
found in Additional file 4. These differences in domains
include an extra full TSP domain and two fragments highlighted in blue in Rmi, a single bovine BTI/Kunitz serine
protease inhibitor compared to the set of ten in Rmi (red)
and the absence of a WAP domain upstream of the IG
-set. The multiple protein sequence alignment of Rmi

C. elegans (NP_505017.1) (Figure 5A). Evolutionary analyses shows that mammalian (host) papilin diverge at an
earlier time than the divergence of hexapoda papilin
from tick papilin (Figure 5B).
The serpin downstream of the papilin on the negative
strand was investigated for gene synteny in other
species.
Serine Protease Inhibitor: Serpin pseudogenes

Downstream of the papilin, a full CDS for serpin was
predicted. The predicted serpin domain structure, however, was fragmented with the N-terminus and C-terminus rearranged, exon2 residues 266-364 and exon9 1-63
residues. Attempts to sequence the serpin cDNA resulted
in a 500 bp product. A single PCR product based on forward primer (SerpF3) in exon5 and reverse primer
(SerpR2) in exon9 was sequenced (Additional file 2). The
small product sequenced matched only 148 bases of predicted exon5 and 231 bases of predicted exon9 (exons

6-8 were not in alignment). Conserved serpin domain
analysis found also two fragments in predicted ERT gene
exon2 residues 115-189 and exon4 residues 185-364. To
determine whether the adjacent position of a serpin with
papilin is common, a search of mosquito, fly genomes
and Isc found no evidence of a serpin downstream from
the papilin indicating this arrangement as not conserved
within arthropods.
To gain better insight to genomic structures a Cot
DNA comparison to the BAC sequence was undertaken.
BAC and Cot comparison: element genome wide frequency
estimation

DNA reassociating kinetics based Cot filtration of genomic DNA was used to reduce the concentration of repetitive DNA sequences that dominate the Rmi genome, in
order to analyse the “gene-rich” single/low-copy and the
moderate repetitive DNA fractions [14,24]. Two fractions
of moderate to low repetitive regions of Rmi’s genome

were selectively obtained from Cot filtration [14] and
then analysed with BM-005-G14 BAC sequence, to assay
the frequency of specific BAC sequence within the entire
genome. Cot696 and Cot69 DNA 454 read sequences
were mapped to BM-005-G14 to determine the frequency that the BM-005-G14 sequences were found in
the Cot selected fraction of the tick genome. The read
depth in a 100 bp window over total mapped read (bp)
was calculated and the log2 value plotted as a heatmap
(Figure 1). Six Sine Ruka elements [6] (R1-R6) were identified in BM-005-G14 (Figure 1) at positions 16,28316,459, 37,204-37,398, 50,357-50,535, 83,819-83,996,
102,593-102,771, 126,277-126,452, the Pogo gene appear
in the white-red bands, and (as expected) low frequency
papilin and serpin in blue bands. Other regions of high
frequency were identified as a 321 bp ATCT repeat positioned at 4,864-5186 and, a 124 bp TTTC repeat positioned at 878-1,004 bp and 241 bp CAA repeat in region
122,719-122,961, these are shown as green arrows over
the heatmap in Figure 1. The overall estimate of BAC
sequence coverage was 38.80% and 41.59% respectively
for Cot 696 and Cot 69.
Based on the proportion of mapped reads relative to
the total sequenced reads from the two Cot DNA
experiments the genome wide frequency of a single 195
bp Ruka element (R2) at position 37,204-37,398 was
estimated. The frequency of Rmi Ruka element in the
genome was estimated based on the extrapolation of the
two Cot fractions back to time zero to represent 0.42%
(29 Mb) of the 7.2 Gb genome (Additional file 5).
Although this estimate is approximate, the frequency of
this specific Rmi Ruka element therefore in the genome
is estimated to be at least 152,923 copies.
Analysis for BAC BM-012-E08: highly repetitive genomic
region
BAC assembly and analysis

The BAC clone BM-012-E08 was sequenced (1536 Sanger
reads) at an expected size based on restriction digest of 65
Kb (not shown). Due to the complexity of BM-012-E08
BAC, the assembly metrics were tested to de-convolute
the sequences (Additional file 6, 7). In summary, a conservative assembly approach [25] assembled less reads and
produced more singletons but increased the length of the
total assembly. BM-000-E08 was assembled into a 52 Kb
consensus based on 18 contiguous sequences greater than
1 kb in size.
As very few arthropod retroelements and a large percentage of small RNA (17%) were identified with
RepeatMasker [26], eight de novo interspersed repeat
motifs were identified and masked for gene predictions.
An almost complete, 18S ribosomal RNA gene, internal
transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene,
ITS 2, and 28S ribosomal RNA gene, was identified by

Page 6 of 16

best sequence similarity to Amblyomma americanum
(GenBank AF291874) (Additional file 6). In the assembly, there is evidence of at least three ribosomal 18S 5’
and 28S 3’ units. In Figure 6, the rDNA BAC positions
are shown as blue arrows, BAC end positions in green,
and the intergenic regions in brown. The remaining
sequence not accounted for contained repetitive DNA
sequence, similarly found in the highly repetitive intergenic regions between the repeating rDNA units. In
Figure 6, the dot matrix of the best (parsimonious)
ordered and oriented contigs display three rDNA units
and repetitive intergenic regions aligned against a single
unit.
The junction of the repeat motifs and the rRNA were
tested by PCR, direct sequenced and clones sequenced to
prove sequence and assembly accuracy. Three BAC repeat
junction positions were confirmed by PCR and shown in
Figure 6 as red markers on the horizontal axis of the dot
plot (17 K, 22 K and 38 K). Primer sequences and gel pictures can be found in Additional file 2 and Additional files
8 and 9 respectively. In Additional file 8, lanes 1 and 2
confirmed marker 22 K downstream of the 28S unit in the
large repeat region (dark blue glyph). Lanes 5 and 6 confirmed marker 38 K upstream of the 18S unit in the large
repeat region. Marker 28 K confirmed downstream of the
28S unit in the smaller dense repeat region in contig6
Figure 6, this is repeated in contg-rep_c50 and contig1.
The rDNA structure was further investigated.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) structure analysis

At least three full ribosomal 18S and 5.8S repeat units
could be ordered although the 28S unit assembly was
partial in the first repeating unit1, and in unit 3 contained a break point ITS (1 Kb) as compared to the
Ambylomma americanum rRNA sequence. The rDNA
repeat elements and ribosomal units were then tested by
PCR to validate the gene size and to reveal more detail
on the rDNA repeat unit and a putative interrupter
sequence in LSU sequence that had previously been identified in the Drosophila genome [27]. Long range PCR
confirmed rRNA unit size of 7-8 Kb (lane 2) and a large
intergenic repetitive region of 8-9 Kb (lane 6) (Additional
file 9). The 28S breakpoint/large interrupter region could
not be confirmed by PCR, position is highlighted yellow
in Figure 6 (~42 Kb), tested primer sets 15 K and 18 K
can be found in Additional file 2. The BAC assembly and
long range PCR confirmed the rRNA unit size of 8 Kb
and a large intergenic repetitive region of at least 9 Kb.
The Rmi 18S sequences were then analysed for tick specific differences.
Tick ribosomal DNA comparative studies: Identifying tickspecific sequence differences

To identify sequence differences in rRNA protein binding sites the 18S small subunit (SSU) was aligned to the
16S E. coli SSU and bovine18S.

Figure 6 BAC BM-012-E08 50 Kb sequence, with a repetitive 8 Kb intergenic spacer (brown), and rRNA 18S, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 and 28S
(blue) together make the repeat unit structure (light blue). The BES start position are indicated by a green arrow and *copies. Below is BAC

Analysis of three E. coli complex binding sites found a
number of sites with conserved changes in tick as compared to mammals. Sites were also identified conserved
in E. coli and mammals, and a conserved change found
in tick (Figure 7).
In Figure 7, regions for rRNA protein binding [28] have
been highlighted to identify regions of differences in
E. coli 16S (Embl: X80725) and tick and mammalian 18S
sequences. Represented in the multiple sequence alignment are five tick species, A. americanum (GenBank:
AF291874.1), A. glauerti (GenBank:AF115372.1), A. variegatum (GenBank:L76346.1), A. tuberculatum (GenBank:L76345.1), A. maculatum (GenBank:L76344.1) and
R. microplus 18S RNAmmer prediction [29], the ticks’
hosts B. taurus (GenBank:DQ222453.1) and H. sapiens
(GenBank:NR_003286.2). In E. coli 16S protein binding
site complexes are highlighted in the following E. coli
sequence regions: S7_S9_S19 complex (red) 936-965,

alignment and annotation can be found in Additional file
10. The protein rRNA binding site for protein S7 in E.
coli (1236-1240, 1373-1383 bp) shows a single SNP
between the tick and mammalian sequences. In Figure 7
the top blue boxed alignment subset shows a highly conserved region between 18S and 16S sequences (R. microplus 1122-1160 bp) with an example conserved SNP
change G- > A in tick, this was confirmed in all three 18
s units. A total of 3.2% (59) of Rmi 18S sequence were
conserved SNPs. The lower boxed alignment subset
(R. microplus 791-818 bp) shows more differences in the
conservation with the S8_S15_S17 binding complex in E.
coli. In 18S sequences only, a total of 63 Rmi positions
showed conservation in all tick species and a conserved
change in B. taurus and H. sapiens.
To examine if this BAC sequence had the same variation at the R2 retrotransposon target site of the LSU
[30], the Rmi rDNA LSU positioned at 19240-23971 bp
(19 K unit) and 35316-40798 bp (35 K unit) were
aligned. The specific variation of conserved SNPs

BAC and Cot comparison: element genome wide frequency
estimation

To estimate the genome wide frequency of elements in
this highly repetitive BAC, a single Cot fraction Cot 696
was used to align to BM-012-E08. The reads were
mapped to the BAC sequence at 100% identity and 90%
read coverage, shown beneath the dot matrix in Figure
6. Reads could not be aligned to the densely repetitive
rDNA intergenic regions, it was also noted that the
short interspersed Ruka element found in BM-005-G14
was absent in BM-012-E08.

Discussion
In the absence of a reference genome we describe the de
novo assembly and in-depth analysis of two Rmi BAC
clones, selected for the following two reasons. The first for

gene content, based on Rmi expression analyses identified
as important during feeding and protein production during fast growth stages of tick development. The second
reason was for BAC clones with different genomic complexity, to make Cot DNA comparisons. In this study of
two very different BAC regions newly reported features for
eukaryotes and Chelicerate genomes are described.
The following discussion sections address the study of
both the selected BAC sequences.
Tick genomic structure: assembly and predictive models

The correct assembly of tick genome is a challenge due
its repetitive nature, and the lack of predictive models
for gene structures. The BAC assembly, due to low genome level synteny with the Ixodes scapularis assembly,
depended on the comparative analysis of transcript and
the positioning of BES.
The correct assembly of the BM-005-G14 contig set
was dependant on the correct BES positioning, while the
ordering and orientation was aided by the BES positioning and transcript alignments.
Given the complexity of BM-012-E08, different assembly tools were trialled under different options. Assembly

tools with uniform read distribution take a cautionary
approach in contig building, and sometimes create two
contigs when it could have created one. This feature
reduces over compression of repeats during the contig
building phase and ensures that, for example rRNA
stretches which are present multiple times in a the genome will also be present approximately the same number of times in the result files [25]. The repeat motifs,
intergenic regions, rRNA sequences and rDNA unit size
were confirmed by PCR. However the assembly gaps
and insertions show clear deviations from the perfect
repeat unit size. This is the first Rhipicephalinae assembly of rDNA and the first known attempt at assembly in
Arthopoda of three external intergenic repetitive units
between the rDNA repeating subunits.
Tick gene structure: predictive models

The complexities of gene predictions included intronic
regions of nested repeat elements, multiple short exons
and overlapping regions complicating the delineation of
exon coding regions. Overlapping genes have been
reported in Drosophila but these genes were on different
stands [31]. In eukaryotic research this is the first
description of same strand gene overlap between two
genes, the papilin and helicase.
In Drosophila, papilin an extracellular matrix glycoprotein is found to be involved in, (1) thin matrix layers during gastrulation, (2) matrix associated with wandering,
phagocytic hemocytes, (3) basement membranes and (4)
space-filling matrix during Drosophila development [32].
Essential also for normal embryonic development Caenorhabditis elegans [33]. This is also the first Chelicerate fulllength papilin cDNA sequence produced. Our papilin
gene model (refer to methods) was confirmed by other
arthropod species. The papilin nested helicase was also
found within the Isc genome supercontigs (version 1), this
inclusion of the helicase shows a level of gene synteny is
present in this region between the two distant hard tick
species.
It has been reported that inhibiting papilin synthesis
in Drosophila or Caenorhabditis causes defective cell
arrangements and embryonic death. Ectopic expression
of papilin in Drosophila causes lethal abnormalities in
muscle, Malpighian tubule and trachea formation. It has
been suggested that papilin influences cell rearrangements and may modulate metalloproteinases during
organogenesis [32-35].
These function/activities relate to the following specific
domains. An interesting gene domain complex the tick
derived Kunitz type inhibitors act as antihemostatic factors
[36]. Hematophagous organisms must overcome host
hemostasis in order to locate blood and maintain its flow
during ingestion [37]. Salivary components produce antihemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive

Page 9 of 16

effects that may facilitate feeding, as well as transmission
of tick-borne pathogens [37]. The number of Rmi KU
domains (x10) present compared to bovine (x1) indicates,
based on this domains function, an important change in
this genes structure for tick survival.
The whey acidic protein-type four-disulphide core
domain (WAP) has protein family members that include
the whey acidic protein, elafin (elastase-specific inhibitor) known to have anti-microbial acitivity [38], catrinlike protein (a calcium transport inhibitor and other
extracellular proteinase inhibitors. A significant
sequence variance in bovine was the absence of the
WAP domain (Figure 4).
Isoforms of papilin have been found in a number of
Arthropoda species, six in Drosophila and two in Apis.
Given the size and complexity of the Rmi papilin, isoforms may exist that are yet to be investigated.
The helicase was identified nested as a separate gene
between the first 5’ thrombospondin and the Adam-TS
spacer of the Rmi papilin. RACE sequencing from the
Adam-TS spacer domain exon in the 5’end direction
produced the complete papilin product minus the helicase insertion, confirming our gene model.
The discovery of shared exon regions for 2 eukaryote
genes, the papilin and helicase, is quite novel. Nested
genes do occur in eukaryotes [31], nested genes in
D. melanogaster and C. elegans have been found exclusively as embedded sequences in introns. Kumar 2009,
reviewed that in D. melanogaster nested intronic genes
constitutes approximately 6% of the organism’s total gene
complement, and 85% of these nested genes are predicted
to encode protein. For example the gart locus, the Pcp
gene is nested in intron 1 of the ade3 gene on the complement strand. A nested ketoreductase was identified in
an A. aegypti papilin - however not with exon overlap as
shown for the helicase identified here. In the mouse genome, 28 overlapping gene pairs had partial overlapping
exons, and did not encompass the entire coding sequence
of either gene. In the human genome 51 exon overlaps
on opposite strands, again were partial. Neither the
human nor the mouse genome contains any overlapping
genes that share coding sequences on the same strand.
Further the majority of nested intronic genes are functionally unrelated and typically not co-expressed with
their external host genes. Therefore further functional
analysis of this gene’s novel arrangement warrants investigation. No helicase element was found nested in the
bovine intron region of papilin.
The initial identification of the serpin domain led to
the adjacent papilin gene described above. No syntenic
evidence was found for the down stream serpin region
in Isc. Full investigation of this gene family within Rmi
genomic sequence and the I. scapularis genome remains
to be investigated.

The genes for ribosomal DNA are tandem repeated
clusters in the heterochromatic regions of metazoan
genomes [27,39], in Drosophila 77% of heterochromatin
sequence is composed of fragmented and nested transposable elements and other repeated DNAs [39]. It has
been reported in vertebrate the splitting and apparent
splicing of ribosomal RNA occurs, and during processing, in mammalian nuclear 28S pre-rRNA, tissue-specific elimination of an ‘intron’ bearing a hidden break site
occurs [40,41]. An almost complete, 18S ribosomal RNA
gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1, 5.8S ribosomal
RNA gene, ITS 2, and 28S ribosomal RNA gene, was
identified by sequence similarity to Amblyomma americanum (GenBank AF291874; [30]), which is the only
other tick rDNA sequence analysed at this level of coverage. A similar unit was not identified in the Ixodes
scapularis genome highlighting the difficulty in the
assembly of this region. The Rmi rDNA units have been
identified as novel due to the lack of the R2 retroelement previously identified in Amblyomma and now confirmed in this study, even though the R2 retroelement
binding site hard tick sequence difference was conserved. The fragmented nature of the LSU makes it possible that the BM-012-E08 BAC clones are derived from
the end of an array of rDNA units in the genome where
incomplete and rearranged rDNA units may occur.
Tick DNA comparative studies: Identifying tick-specific
sequence differences

A number of conserved changes within rRNA protein
binding sites between the ticks as compared to mammals
were found. The hard tick specific sequence differences
(SNPs) were also found in the LSU R2 retroelement target site.
Due to the uniqueness of tick rDNA sequences it is
feasible that tick rRNA could be a target for drug development analogous to the use of bacterial rRNA as antibiotic targets. Consistent with this possibility, a number
of conserved changes within rRNA protein binding sites
between the tick as compared to mammal were found.
The hard tick specific sequence differences (SNPs), were
also found in the LSU R2 retroelement target site.
Tick gene expression analysis

The qRT-PCR analysis of the papilin described confirmed differential increased expression in two life
stages, most prominently in larvae trying to attach to
the host (Figure 2). It was also demonstrated that the
helicase is strongly expressed in ovaries of feeding
females. Helicases are often utilized to separate strands
of a DNA double helix or a self-annealed RNA molecule
using the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a process characterized by the breaking of hydrogen bonds between
annealed nucleotide bases. The differential expression of

Page 10 of 16

both the papilin and helicase in adult female ovaries
suggests that is perhaps a conserved functional
arrangement.
The abundance of RNA proteins as identified in the
subtraction library study was not surprising due to
increased protein production during feeding. Anderson
et al. 2008 reported that the abundance ribosomal protein coding genes is not unusual for a transcriptome
analysis and illustrates the high degree of redundancy
found in such libraries, especially the occurrence of
numerous sequences coding for proteins involved in
protein synthesis such as ribosomal RNA, e.g. 40S, 60S
and other ribosomal genes [42].
The analysis of genome sequence via back end
sequencing and Cot DNA

The Rmi genomic DNA that was enriched for single/
low-copy and moderately repetitive DNAs [14] along
with BAC end sequencing have provided valuable
insights into Rmi genomic structure. Mapping the reads
of the Cot DNA to the BAC sequencing identified
regions of high repetitive content in BM-012-E08 complex intergenic region by the absence of mapped reads.
Also moderately repetitive regions could be identified
such as the RUKA element in BM-005-G14.
In particular using the two Cot filtrations, we were
able to estimate the frequency of any specific genomic
sequence within the entire genome. As an example presented, major frequency peaks were identifiable and the
relative frequency of the sine Ruka [6] element in the
genome was estimated for BM-005-G14. Although
absent from the euchromatic section of the relatively
compact 1.8 Gb genome of Drosophila melanogaster
[43], several distinct families of SINEs with copy numbers of up to 590 Kb per genome have been described
in Aedes aeygpti, the mosquito vector of the yellow fever
virus [44,45]
The frequency of a single Rmi Ruka element in the
genome was estimated based on the extrapolation of the
two Cot fractions to represent 0.42% of the genome, at
least 152,923 copies.
A previous examination of 3 BAC sequences, and the
(DFCI) Gene Indices [46] for the four ixodid tick species, A. variegatum [47], R. appendiculatus (Rap) [48],
B. (R.) microplus [19] and I. scapularis [49], estimated
that the Ruka repeat sequences comprise approximately
1.6% (4 kb) of the 250 Kb of Rap genome (BAC
sequence). Then on the following assumptions (1) that
these Rap BAC contigs are representative, and (2) a genome size for R. appendiculatus of 1 Gb, that a total of
65,000 copies of Ruka could be predicted [6]. Since our
estimation in Rmi is based on a single element we
expect the number of Ruka families will occupy a much
larger fraction of the genome than previously estimated.

Conclusion
This analysis builds on the previous report by Guerrero
et al 2010, to characterise genomic DNA in the tick Rhipicelphalus microplus, The complete secreted extracellular matrix protein gene papilin primarily found in
basement membranes and essential for embryonic development, was assembled and cDNA sequenced. This is
the first reporting in eukaryotes of same strand exon
overlap between the sequenced products of papilin and
helicase. Detection of these types of overlaps is a complication for current de-novo gene prediction tools. In a
second BAC clone, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was
assembled into three repeat units, the first rRNA assembly in Rhipicephalinae, and the first attempt to assemble
sequence of the rDNA repeat units and intergenic
spacer in arthropods.
In both papilin and rRNA, tick specific sites of
sequence variation were identified in tick R. microplus
relative to the host Bos taurus, in a detailed comparison
to identify targets for disrupting the pathogen-host
interaction. In addition expression analysis of papilin
and helicase demonstrated striking tissue specific
expression in response to sensing the host prior to
attachment for feeding.
Finally the two Cot-filtration resources provided a
means to estimate the frequency of an element in the
context of the whole genome.
In order to place the BAC sequences into a whole
genome context, the BAC sequences were probed with
454 sequenced Cot 69.56 secs and 696.6 secs DNA. This
analysis allowed the representation of specific BAC
sequence to be estimated within the respective Cot
DNA sequences and thus estimate the frequency of
sequence occurrence in the whole R. microplus genome.
The BAC, BAC end sequences (BES) and Cot DNA
have allowed an in-depth analysis of selected R. microplus
genomic DNA, and in terms of sequencing towards a
whole genome provided a valuable insight into R. microplus genomic structure.
Methods
BAC end sequences

Glycerol plates with BAC clones (1,125 96-well plates)
were submitted to Beckman Coulter Genomics (Beverley,
MA, USA) to obtain approximately 12,000 reads using bidirectional sequencing of the clones. The Beckman Coulter Genomics protocol is described as follows: clones were
picked from the 96 well plates, cultured and DNA was
purified using SPRI®; following dye-terminator fluorescent
sequencing the product was purified using CleanSEQ®
with sequencing fragments detected via ABI3730xl capillary electrophoresis. The total 10,582 BAC end sequences
(BES) provided as trace files from Agencourt were clipped

of the vector (pECBAC1) with cross_match, Phrap package version 0.990329 [21]. Sequences greater than 500 bp
have been deposited GenBank GSS under HN108288HN118367.
BAC Genomic DNA extraction, library construction, and
BAC screening and sequencing

Ticks from the Deutsch strain of R. microplus were
reared at the USDA-ARS Cattle Fever Tick Research
Laboratory in Mission, TX [50]. Genomic DNA extraction, library construction, and BAC screening are as
described by Guerrero et al., [14].
BAC sequencing

BAC vector used was pECBAC1 and the cloning site
BamHI. BAC libraries were sequenced using 3-4 kb insert
high copy shotgun library methods aiming for 8-fold coverage of 1,008,000 bases (high copy) using Sanger Sequencing ABI technology as described for the BAC end
sequencing above (Beckman Coulter Genomics, MA,
USA).
phred 20 read lengths greater than 700 bp and pass
rates: > 90% and x6 coverage.
BAC assembly

BAC Sanger assemblies were conducted with phred/
phrap [51], CAP3 [52] and Phusion [53] and MIRA [25].
The BES were mapped to the assembly with BLAT [54]
at 100% percent sequence identity. Dot plot matrices
were generated using Dotter64 [55]. Beckman Coulter
Genomics (MA, USA) closed the sequence gaps based on
pair end read linkage. The following BAC sequences have
been deposited in GenBank, BM-005-G14 (HM748961)
and BM-012-E08 (HM748964).
The correct orientation and ordering of the contigs was
based on pair-end read assembly linkage results, back end
sequencing positioning and gene annotation, as comparative analysis of Rmi papilin to a number of species show
ordered domain conservation. The finished BAC with gap
closure was 135 Kb, close to the estimated restriction
digest size, with the papilins’ coding region of 8 Kbp spanning a genomic region of 86 Kbp. The papilin gene was
first predicted with Genscan HumanIso model from the 2
large coding sequences CDS8 and CDS6 (6,663 and 4,077
bp respectively), which covered all the papilin protein
domains, except the initial 5’ end thombospondin domain.
In addition, CDS8 contained a helicase domain (not previously identified in papilin), an Adam-TS-spacer 1 and
the second expected thombospondin domain. CDS6 contained all the remaining papilin domains, KU domains
x10, WAP, IG x3, and the final 3’end PLAC domain.
Direct cDNA sequencing confirmed the BAC data and 5’
RACE assisted to confirm the presence of the missing

Moolhuijzen et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:254
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/254

thrombospondin domain and our model subsequently
proposed the presence of 2 genes, the papilin and the
helicase.
BES analyses

BlastN [56] nucleotide similarity searches were conducted
on Dana Faber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Gene Indices
BmiGI [13,19], IscGI [49], subtraction library cDNA
[16] and iscapularis.preliminary.TRANSCRIPTS_JCVIIscaW1.0.5. and NCBI [57] datasets that included, (nr, est,
genomic, refseq, GSS, WGS).
BlastX [56] protein similarity searches were conducted
on NCBI [57] (nr, patent), and Ixodes scapularis peptide
gene predictions 1.1 iscapularis. PEPTIDES-IscaW1.1
protein datasets.
Domain and protein family identification was conducted with RPSBlast, on NCBI Conserved Domain
Database (CDD) [18] database.
BLAT [54] ixodes_scapularis_supercontigs.
Gene prediction

Genscan [58] (model for human isoforms) was used to
assemble the BAC contigs. Bioperl [59] scripts were
used to parse alignments and identify conserved regions.
The In-silico workflow was designed based on open
source applications and CCG Grid computing [60].
Sequence alignment and phylogeny

ClustalW [22] was used for multiple sequence alignments and multiple sequence alignments for manuscript
were displayed in Jalview [61].
Phylogeny analysis was conducted with Phylip version
3.6 [23] protein distance algorithm and Neighbor-Joining method [62] and bootstrap test of 100 replicates.
The molecular clock test was performed by comparing
the ML value for the given topology with and without
the molecular clock constraints under Jones-TaylorThornton (1992) model [63,64]. Evolutionary analyses
were conducted in MEGA4 [64].
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [62]. The bootstrap consensus tree
inferred from 500 replicates was taken to represent the
evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. The percentage
of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown
next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with
branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the method [65]
and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site. The analysis involved 7 amino acid
sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated. There were a total of 1124 positions in
the final dataset.

Repeat identification

Arthropod known repeats were identified with RepeatMasker version 3.2.6 [26]. Repeatscout [66] was used for
the de-novo identification of repeat motifs. Perfect tandem repeats were identified with SSR finder Perl program. Sine RUKA elements were identified based on
BlastN [56] homology to GenBank: EU018139.1 (9,94710,084 bp), percentage identity greater than 84% and
coverage greater than 69%.
cDNA preparation

Total RNA was extracted from tick samples using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA). Tissue was
ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle with
liquid nitrogen and the powder transferred to a tube of Trizol with 1 mm glass beads. This mix was further homogenised for 45 seconds in a MiniBeadbeater-96 (Biospec
Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA) then the RNA was
extracted using chloroform and isopropanol. Double
stranded cDNA was created from 25 μg of total RNA
using a SuperScript™ Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis
Kit following Kit protocols (Invitrogen Corporation, CA,
USA).
Papilin PCR amplification and sequencing

Primers based on BAC sequences were designed with
EMBOSS eprimer3 [67] and a minimum GC clamp of 2.
Synthesis of primer sequences were by Sigma Aldrich
(MO, USA) and sequences are presented in Additional
file 2. The full papilin cDNA was PCR amplified from
cDNA extracted from frustrated larvew and cloned in
three steps. A 7723 bp product was amplified between
primers Papilin57383F and PapilinR3 (designed from predicted coding sequence) using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany) using Expand Long Template Buffer 2. This
reaction was thermocycled in a DNA Engine (PTC-200)
Peltier Thermal Cycler (Biorad Laboratories, CA, USA).
The purified product was transformed into chemically
competent One Shot® TOP10 cells using a TOPO-XL®
PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA). For
each transformation, DNA was prepared from six clones
using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA).
Plasmid inserts were sequenced using Big Dye Vers 3.1
technology (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and were run
on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Griffith University DNA Sequencing Facility, School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Griffith University,
Qld, Australia). Sequences were edited and aligned in
Sequencher (Vers 4.8 Gene Codes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA). Additional sequencing primers were
designed manually (Additional file 2).
The start codon for the papilin gene was determined
following 5’ amplification of the cDNA ends from larval

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/254

cDNA using the SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit as described by the kit manufacturer (Clontech
Laboratories Inc., CA, USA). The 5’-RACE PCR used an
Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., CA,
USA) using the kit 5’ RACE UPM primer and the gene
specific reverse primer AdamSR1 designed within the
Adam spacer region of the papilin gene (Additional
file 2). The gel-purified product was cloned into chemically competent One Shot ® TOP10 cells using a
TOPO® TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Corporation, CA,
USA). Clone inserts were sequenced as described above.
The papilin stop codon was determined from the predicted coding sequence and a primer was designed
anchored at the stop position PapStopR1 (Sup). A 611
bp product was PCR amplified between primers
Pap12440F to PapStopR1. The product was cloned and
sequenced as described above.
Papilin cloned products

Final papilin product was 8,761 bp, from the 5’ Race to
primer AdamS_R1 product length 867 bp, and from primer regions papilin57383F to PapilinR3 product length
7,723 bp and pap12440F to pap13230R direct sequence.

(GUDSF). Sequences were edited and aligned in
Sequencher (Vers 4.7 Gene Codes Corporation).
Amplified products were cloned using the pCR2.1 TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen Corporation, CA,
USA). Transformed cells were plated on to LB agarose
plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown overnight at 37°C. Colonies were picked and cultured in LB
medium broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. PCR
reactions were performed on 1 μl of the cultured broths
and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm
insertion. Plasmid DNA was purified as described above.
BM012-E08 Long range PCR

Tick genomic DNA was prepared following tissue grinding
as described above for cDNA preparation and subsequently purified using the QIAamp DNA mini-kit as
described by the manufacture (QIAGEN, CA, USA). The
Expand Long Template PCR system was used to amplify
the DNA under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) in a
BioRad DNA Engine Peltier Thermal Cycler. Direct
sequencing was undertaken as described above. All
sequence alignment graphs were generated with Bioperl
[59].

Helicase PCR amplification and sequencing

A second large PCR product 4886 bp in length was
amplified from the larval cDNA between primers PapilinORFF2 and Papilin54900R. The 3’ end of the product
has a 229 bp overlap with the papilin gene (exon 2 and
3, 5’ of the Adam spacer). The product was amplified
using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and was cloned
and sequenced as described above for the large papilin
clone. Internal primers were designed to sequence the
complete clone that was found to contain a helicase
gene (Additional file 2).
BM-12-E08 PCR

PCR 50 μl reaction contained Advantage 2 SA PCR buffer,
10 mM of dNTP mix, 10 μM of each primer, 100 ng of
DNA template and Advantage 2 polymerase mix as
recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech Laboratories Inc., CA, USA), Cycling Parameters (BIORAD DNA
Engine Cycler): Initial denaturation for 2 mins at 94°C followed by 29 cycles of denaturation 1 min 94°C, annealing
1 min 55°C, and extension 1 min 72°C, with a final extension of 7 mins 72°C. The products were visualised following agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2%) containing Gel Red
(Jomar Bioscience Pty Ltd, SA, Australia). PCR products
and purified plasmid DNA were sequenced using Big Dye
Vers 3.1 technology (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and
were run on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyser at Griffith University DNA Sequencing Facility

qRT-PCR analysis

Primers were designed manually within targeted exon
regions for the helicase and papilin transcripts described
in this study (Additional file 2). Methods for qRT-PCR
analysis were described previously by Lew-Tabor et al.
(2010), utilising tick extracts prepared from different
tick organs and stages, normalised against 2 housekeeper genes (Actin and rRNA 18S) and against a
pooled cDNA sample.
Cot selected genomic DNA

The Cot filtration on Rmi genomic DNA was performed
as previously described [14], to enrich for single/low-copy
and moderately repetitive DNAs. The two “conditions” are
called Cot69 and Cot696. Starting DNA concentrations
for both were 200 micrograms of sheared genomic DNA.
Time for renaturation was 1 hr, 48 min, 6 sec for sample
Cot696 (Cot of 695.6) and 10 min 49 sec for sample Cot69
(Cot of 69.56). Renaturation was conducted at 70 degrees
C, at 0.03 M NaPO4. Sequencing results form these two
Cot-selected samples have been deposited in GenBank
SRA, submission: SRA012677.4/SID00001.
Cot DNA 454 read sequence was mapped to the BAC
sequence using the Newbler GS-FLX reference mapper,
version 2.0.00.20 [68] and BLAT [54]. The total read
number was calculated for each BAC window size 100
bps (read number per 100 bp window). The percentage
