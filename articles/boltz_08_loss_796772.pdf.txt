Abstract
Background: Secretory and transmembrane proteins traverse the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and Golgi compartments for final maturation prior to reaching their functional destinations.
Members of the p24 protein family, which are transmembrane constituents of ER and Golgi-derived
transport vesicles, function in trafficking some secretory proteins in yeast and higher eukaryotes.
Yeast p24 mutants have minor secretory defects and induce an ER stress response that likely
results from accumulation of proteins in the ER due to disrupted trafficking. We tested the
hypothesis that loss of Drosophila melanogaster p24 protein function causes a transcriptional
response characteristic of ER stress activation.
Results: We performed genome-wide profiling experiments on tissues from Drosophila females
with a mutation in the p24 gene logjam (loj) and identified changes in message levels for 641 genes.
We found that loj mutants have expression profiles consistent with activation of stress responses.
Of particular note is our observation that approximately 20% of the loci up regulated in loj mutants
are Drosophila immune-regulated genes (DIRGs), many of which are transcriptional targets of NFκB or JNK signaling pathways.
Conclusion: The loj mutant expression profiling data support the hypothesis that loss of p24
function causes a stress response. Genes involved in ameliorating stress, such as those encoding
products involved in proteolysis, metabolism and protein folding, are differentially expressed in loj
mutants compared to controls. Nearly 20% of the genes with increased message levels in the loj
mutant are transcriptional targets of Drosophila NF-κB proteins. Activation of NF-κB transcription
factors is the hallmark of an ER stress response called the ER overload response. Therefore, our
data are consistent with the hypothesis that Drosophila p24 mutations induce stress, possibly via
activation of ER stress response pathways. Because of the molecular and genetic tools available for
Drosophila, the fly will be a useful system for investigating the tissue-specific functions of p24
proteins and for determining the how disrupting these molecules causes stress responses in vivo.

Background
Proper functioning of the ER is critical for cell survival and
function. Perturbations in protein folding in the ER or in
trafficking of secretory proteins are associated with a large

number of human maladies, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, and can lead to chronic inflammation and cancer [Reviewed in [1-5]]. The ER is the first
cellular compartment in which secretory and membrane

proteins undergo post-translational modification as they
progress through the cellular membrane systems to their
final functional location. When ER homeostasis is disrupted or trafficking is blocked, cells attempt to correct the
problem via induction of stress response pathways such as
the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the ER overload
response (EOR), phylogenetically conserved mechanisms
for dealing with cellular assaults [Reviewed in [4,6-12]].
The UPR and EOR signaling programs can be activated by
the presence of unusually large amounts of proteins
within the ER that are not trafficked to the Golgi. For
instance, the UPR is induced when mutant proteins cannot be properly folded and accumulate within the ER
lumen. The EOR, which is characterized by activation of
the Rel transcription factor NF-κB and its downstream signaling pathways, is stimulated by events such as viral
infection that produce overwhelming amounts of nonmutant proteins [Reviewed in [13]].
The UPR attenuates translation to decrease overall protein
load in the ER and activates transcription of genes encoding chaperones, oxidoreductases, and other proteins necessary for folding and post-translational modification.
Genes involved in protein metabolism are up regulated as
well. The activated UPR also targets improperly folded
proteins to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and up regulates genes necessary for protein metabolism. Cells unable to overcome ER stress may ultimately
die by apoptosis [Reviewed in [4,6-10]].
Three cellular signal transduction pathways mediate
downstream UPR or EOR events [Reviewed in [4,6-10]].
In mammals PERK, Atf6 and Ire-1 are ER transmembrane
proteins, with N-termini in the ER lumen and C-termini
in the cytoplasm, which serve as sensors for changes
within the ER, including alterations in calcium levels,
redox environment or levels of nascent proteins. Translational attenuation, which decreases the overall amount of
nascent protein requiring ER modification and folding, is
mediated by PERK kinase activation by autophosphorylation. Subsequent PERK inactivation of the eIF2α translation initiation factor via phosphorylation is responsible
for the resulting translational attenuation.
Upon UPR induction, the Ire-1 endonuclease is also phosphorylated, allowing cleavage of the Xbp1 mRNA to produce a functional bZIP transcription factor that positively
regulates expression of downstream genes such as ER
chaperones. Ire-1 also targets a subset of mRNAs encoding
membrane and secreted proteins for degradation [14].
The third UPR signal, Atf6 is a transcription factor that is
released from the ER during cellular stress, moves to the
Golgi for final modification, and then activates transcription of downstream genes including chaperones and

Xbp1. There are Drosophila counterparts to PERK (PEK in
Drosophila), Atf6, Ire-1 and Xbp1 [[15-17], Reviewed in
[11]], although the genes and their targets are largely
unstudied in this model system.
One or more of the signaling cascades involved in the
UPR also activate the EOR and NF-κB. This NF-κB activation occurs post-translationally, possibly as a result of
PERK-mediated translational attenuation of the NF-κB
inhibitory partner I-κB [18,19]. Other data suggest a
model in which NF-κB is a downstream target of Ire-1
through an interaction between Ire-1 and the E3 ubiquitin
ligase Traf2 that leads to NF-κB activation [20]. Yeast do
not have NF-κB homologs and lack two of the UPR signaling pathways found in multi-cellular organisms; all
known UPR signaling in yeast is regulated by Ire-1.
It is not clear that activation of the UPR and EOR are
entirely separable events since both responses require
components of the same ER stress-activated signaling cascades [21]. Several chemical agents that induce the UPR
also trigger the EOR, although some inducers may be
pathway specific [Reviewed in [13]]. One possibility is
that the EOR is a later response to stresses that cannot be
overcome by the initial UPR activation [21]. Early UPR
activation may induce "adaptation genes", and, if the
stress cannot be overcome, the "alarm genes" characteristic of the EOR may be induced in a final effort to save cells
before they initiate apoptosis [21].
Members of the p24 protein family are constituents of ER
and Golgi-derived vesicles and are hypothesized to function in a variety of ways in intracellular protein trafficking
[Reviewed in [22]]. Since loss of p24 function reduces trafficking of specific proteins [23-25] and induces the UPR in
yeast [26], we reasoned that loss of p24 expression in Drosophila should similarly reduce protein trafficking and
induce an ER stress response. Because we expected trafficking of otherwise normal proteins to be affected in p24
mutants, we further predicted that the Drosophila stress
response would differ from that in yeast by more closely
resembling the EOR rather than the UPR and that the
response would be activated by the PEK or Ire-1 pathways.
Our genome-wide expression profiling and genetic interaction studies are consistent with the hypotheses that loss
of p24 function leads to activation of stress responses in
metazoans and that both the PEK and Ire-1 pathways may
be involved in these responses through activation of the
NF-κB proteins Dif and Rel.

Results
Since deletion of a yeast p24 protein induces an ER stress
response [26], we predicted that loss of a Drosophila p24
protein, Loj, would elicit a similar response in flies.
Because flies contain all three stress response pathways

(PEK, Atf6, Ire-1) while yeast only have the Ire-1-mediated
response, we expected that loss of trafficking due to a p24
mutation might induce multiple ER stress-activated signaling pathways. Since one characteristic of ER stress
responses is transcriptional activation of numerous gene
products to ameliorate the stress, we utilized a genomic
profiling approach to determine the genes with altered
expression in loj00898/loj04026 mutants (henceforth referred
to as loj mutants) compared to controls. We showed previously that this allelic combination is strongly hypomorphic and probably genetically null [27].
loj transcripts and proteins are highly expressed in the follicle cells of developing eggs and in the central nervous
system (CNS) [27,28] as well as in other tissues such as
the gut and fat body (K.A. Boltz, S. Grady, and G.E. Carney, unpublished results). For our analyses, female abdomens containing the ovaries, genital tract, fat, and gut
tissue were dissected away from the remainder of the body
(head/thorax), which contains the entire CNS as well as
the fat surrounding the head. Mutant and control samples
from either the abdomen or head/thorax were used to
generate labeled samples for microarray analyses using
Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays. We identified a
similar number of expression changes in each of the two
samples using a 1.5-fold cut-off (p < 0.001 for all data
extraction methods for each sample). In the abdominal
preparations 366 genes showed transcriptional changes,
and 372 genes were identified in the head/thorax samples.
Ninety-seven of the genes are common to both tissue
preparations (Table 1).
Of the 641 genes showing transcriptional changes in one
or both tissues, approximately one fifth (131 genes) are
up regulated by various pathogens or septic injury (Table

2); many are targets of the Toll or Imd signaling cascades
[29-37]. The Toll pathway in Drosophila regulates immune
response to pathogens and septic injury by activating the
NF-κB transcription factors Dorsal (Dl) and Dif [38-41],
while the Imd pathway branches downstream of TAK1 to
activate Jun kinase (JNK) and Relish (Rel) signaling in
response to pathogens or injury [31]. Rel is the third NFκB transcription factor in Drosophila that controls humoral
immune responses [42]. Since activation of NF-κB is the
hallmark of the EOR, our data showing increased levels of
numerous immune responsive and NF-κB target genes
suggest that a stress response that includes the EOR is activated in loj mutant females.
Expression changes common to both tissues
While the majority of the genes identified in our analyses
were specific to either the abdomen or the head/thorax
samples, numerous changes were common to both tissue
preparations. Twenty genes had decreased levels (including loj, see Additional file 1) in both mutant tissue samples, while 77 genes showed increased expression in loj
mutants compared to controls (see Additional files 1 and
2). Seventeen of these 97 genes were found previously to
be transcriptionally responsive to the ER stress inducing
agent tunicamycin [43]. Fourteen of our genes show a
similar response to tunicamycin-induced changes, while 3
genes show the opposite pattern (see Additional files 1
and 2). Tequila, which is down regulated in loj mutants
(see Additional file 1), is also repressed in tissue culture
cells in which the UPR has been induced by dithiothreitol
treatment; this decrease is dependent upon Ire-1 but not
Xbp1 [14].

Of the genes identified in both tissue data sets, 36 are
known or likely Drosophila immune-regulated genes

(DIRGs), the majority of which are targets of Toll or Imd
signaling (see Additional file 2). GADD45β is an ER stress
response gene that is regulated by NF-κB and exerts an
anti-apoptotic effect by down regulating JNK signaling
[44]. Also up regulated in this common data set are genes
encoding small immune peptides such as Cecropins and
Attacins as well as the gram-positive bacteria peptidoglycan receptor PGRP-SA (see Additional file 2). The NF-κB
gene Rel also has increased transcript levels in the loj
mutant tissues.
To validate our microarray data, we used qPCR to test a
subset of genes with altered expression profiles in both tissue samples. Each tissue was assayed independently and
showed the expected directional change (see Methods and
Additional files 1 and 2). For most of the genes tested, the
gene expression levels are significantly different between
loj mutants and controls in both tissues (p < 0.05). In only
one instance (GstD5) was the difference non significant
for either tissue.
Mutations in the p24 gene eclair also have elevated levels
of immune-regulated products
We anticipated that increased expression of immune
responsive and NF-κB target genes would be a general
response to p24 gene mutations in multi-cellular animals.
In Drosophila, mutations in two other p24 genes, eclair
(eca) and baiser (bai), cause oviposition defects similar to
those observed for loj mutants [27,45]. Both eca and bai
are co-expressed with loj in ovarian follicle cells and are
expressed in the CNS [28].

We generated viable eca mutant females and tested them
for increased expression of four of the immune regulated
genes that are up regulated in loj mutants (See Methods).
Expression of CG6687, Tsp42Ed and Frost is significantly
increased in eca mutants relative to controls, while
Socs36E is not significantly increased in eca mutants (data
not shown). These results indicate that activation of NFκB and immune-regulated genes may be a general
response to p24 loss-of-function mutations.
Expression changes in the abdomen
The egg tissue of the Drosophila abdomen expresses Loj
throughout all stages of development, with particularly
strong expression observed at stage 10 in the somaticallyderived follicle cell layer [27,28], whose primary function
is secreting factors needed for eggshell formation. Lowlevel Loj expression is also observed in the nurse cells
[27,28] that produce mRNAs and other factors necessary
for embryonic development. Our recent analysis indicates
that the Loj protein is highly expressed in other adult
abdominal tissues as well, including the fat body and the
gut (K.A. Boltz, S. Grady, and G.E. Carney, unpublished
results).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/212

We identified a set of 366 genes with altered expression
patterns in loj mutant abdominal tissue. Of these loci, 269
were noted only in the abdomen while the remaining 97
were also detected in the head/thorax samples (Table 1;
see Additional files 3 and 4). Forty-seven of the 269 abdomen-specific genes were previously determined to be
immune responsive. Most are transcriptional targets of
Toll or Imd signaling while others are components of JNK
signaling pathways (see Additional file 3). General
immune-responsive genes are overrepresented in this data
set (p = 4.915 × 10-17, Fisher's Exact Test) as are components of JNK signaling (p = 9.192 × 10-5, Fisher's Exact
Test).
The abdominal tissue also differentially expressed 222
genes with no known function in immunity (see Additional file 4). Most of the published genome profiling
experiments that identified immune response genes used
an earlier version of the Drosophila genome array [2932,35] that lacked many of the transcriptional units on
the Drosophila Genome 2.0 chips used in this study. Therefore, some of the genes in Additional file 4 likely have previously unrecognized roles in the immune response.
Genes in the up-regulated class have functions consistent
with involvement in a UPR response (see Additional file
4). CG14207 encodes a small Hsp20-like chaperone.
CG33486 encodes an asparagine synthetase, a protein previously implicated in the mammalian ER stress response
[46]. The predicted function of CG4415 is unfolded protein binding, suggesting it functions in the UPR as well.
Many other up-regulated genes encode proteins with predicted functions such as proteolysis and peptidolysis,
metabolism and oxidoreductase activity.
Expression changes in the head/thorax
A subset of cells in the CNS also has high-level Loj expression, and CNS expression of loj in loj mutants rescues egg
laying and fertility [28]. We separated the loj CNS effects
from those occurring in developing eggs and gut by dissecting the abdomen (containing the ovaries and gut but
not CNS tissue) away from the remainder of the fly.

We identified a set of 275 genes differentially regulated in
these samples compared to those from abdomens (Table
1; see Additional files 5 and 6). Many up-regulated genes
function in processes such as lipid and protein metabolism. Again, approximately 20% of the genes have been
implicated in immune signaling (Table 2; see Additional
file 5). Immune responsive as well as JNK pathway components are also overrepresented in the head/thorax preparations (Immune gene p = 1.594 × 10-19; JNK p = 3.110
× 10-3; Fisher's Exact Test).

loj interacts genetically with members of the NF-κB
genetic signaling pathways
The Toll and Imd pathways activate different, but sometimes overlapping, immune-responsive genes depending
upon the pathogen [32,47]. In adult flies, the NF-κB protein Dif is the Toll signaling effecter molecule in response
to immune challenge, while the adult function of Dl is not
clear. Rel functions downstream of Imd signaling to activate DIRGs [Reviewed in [48]]. The fact that we observed
increased message levels of signaling molecules that lie
downstream of each pathway begs the question as to
whether the three Drosophila NF-κB proteins are activated in the loj mutant. Therefore, we tested for genetic
interactions between loj and the three Drosophila NF-κB
genes to identify which may be involved in the stress
response.

Since loj is expressed throughout development [27], we
anticipated that activation of the ER stress response in loj
mutants would be important for survival to adult eclosion
from the pupal case. If NF-κB proteins are needed for
stress response activation to survive pupation, we
expected that reducing NF-κB levels in the loj mutant
would affect adult survival. When we assayed eclosion
rates in double mutant combinations of loj with Dif, dl or
Rel, we found that fewer than the expected number of Dif;
loj or loj, Rel mutant offspring emerged from the pupal
case (Table 3). These results suggest that the Dif and Rel
proteins are needed in loj mutants to ameliorate the stress
response so that animals can survive development.

Discussion
When the ER has an unusually high burden of protein
products due to viral infection, mutation, or other
assaults, mechanisms are activated to reduce the ER protein load. Our results that stress response genes are activated in p24 mutants suggest that loss of p24 protein
function causes stress, possibly by disrupting ER homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that a large proportion of the
genes with altered transcriptional profiles in a loj p24
mutant genetic background are known or suspected targets of immune signaling pathways regulated by the Drosophila NF-κB proteins Dif and Relish; function of each of
these proteins is needed for loj mutants to survive to adulthood. Activation of NF-κB is the signature event in the
EOR response to increased ER protein load.
The loj p24 mutant activates stress response genes
We discovered transcript-level changes in genes encoding
factors involved in protein metabolism and folding that
are consistent with induction of the UPR. However, we
did not identify all of the genes found in a previous study
on tunicamycin-induced ER stress in Drosophila [43],
which identified approximately 600 transcriptional
changes in untreated compared to tunicamycin-treated

For tests with Dif, dl, and imd each of the four expected progeny
classes should be represented at equal frequency (25% each). Only
two types of progeny are produced in the loj00898, RelE20/TM3, Sb
cross, so each class should account for 50% of the offspring.
Homozygous loj00898, loj04026, Dif2 or dl1 mutations independently affect
adult viability, while RelE20 and imdEY08573 stocks are maintained as
homozygotes. Adult eclosion is dramatically reduced when Dif2 or
RelE20 (but not dl1 or imdEY08573) homozygous mutations are
introduced into the loj00898 homozygous mutant background. Similar
results were obtained for 5 independent loj00898, RelE20 recombinant
strains and different genetic backgrounds containing imdEY08573. Large
numbers of loj00898, RelE20/RelE20 and loj00898, RelE20/loj00898 (or loj04026)
survive to adulthood (70–100% of expected), indicating that the
decreased eclosion of loj00898, RelE20 animals is largely due to effects
from mutations in both genes. Although homozygous mutations in loj
or dl decrease adult viability, we did not observe additional, large
effects when both genes are mutated in 2 different genetic
backgrounds.

flies using a 1.5-fold change threshold. Tunicamycin activates the UPR as well as the EOR [13].
In yeast, loss of p24 function results in increased splicing
of the Ire-1 target Xbp1 [26]. We did not find evidence for
increased transcription of Xbp1 in our p24 mutant microarray experiment, which is consistent with the Girardot et
al. report (2004) showing that the UPR transcriptional target Xbp1 is not up regulated in tunicamycin-treated flies.
Furthermore, a second RT-PCR-based assay did not reveal

Page 5 of 11

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:212

increased splicing of Xbp1 in loj compared to control animals (data not shown) nor did we observe activation of
Xbp1-EGFP [16] expression in loj mutants. The fact that
increased Xbp1 transcription and splicing are not detected
could be because these responses occur prior to the time
point of our assays. Alternatively, some aspects of the
tunicamycin and p24 mutant stress responses may be
independent of Xbp1 signaling. Activated Atf6 increases
expression of Xbp1 during ER stress [49], but Atf6 signaling has not been implicated in NF-κB activation during
the EOR.
Our study identified 641 expression changes, 92 of which
were demonstrated previously to be tunicamycin sensitive. Sixty-five transcripts had the same directionality as in
Girardot et al. (2004) [43], while the remaining 27 show
opposite patterns (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The
tunicamycin experiment differed from ours in that the
researchers used wild-type Drosophila adult male bodies
and probed an earlier version of the Drosophila genome
array with lower transcriptional coverage. Some of the differences in the two studies may be due to sex, genetic
background and assayed transcripts. Additionally, the loj
mutants should be chronically stressed due to loss of p24
function throughout development; the tunicamycintreated animals experienced an acute stress response since
they were assayed 24 hrs after being placed on sugar
medium containing tunicamycin [43]. Therefore, we
expect that many differences in the two studies are due to
differential effects from chronic compared to acute stress
responses.
Our most interesting finding is the large number of
immune-responsive genes with altered transcriptional
profiles in the loj p24 mutant. Since the majority of currently published studies on Drosophila immune-responsive genes used the Affymetrix version 1 Drosophila
Genome Arrays (based upon Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Project v4.0), they could not identify all
immune-regulated loci. Based upon their predicted functions, immune-regulated candidates from our study
include Cht4 (see Additional file 1), ImpL2 and CG33093
(see Additional file 4).
loj interacts genetically with Dif and Rel
Recognizing that increased DIRG message levels could be
explained by activation of one or more Drosophila NF-κB
proteins, we tested for genetic interactions between loj and
Dif, dl or Rel. We found that Dif2; loj and loj00898, RelE20
mutant combinations dramatically reduced adult
eclosion, while effects of the dl1; loj00898 double mutant
combination did not differ from dl1; loj00898/+ or dl1/+;
loj00898. These results indicate that NF-κB and loj mutations interact with one another. The results suggest that
the loj mutant stress response is needed for loj mutant ani-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/212

mals to survive development and that this response is partially mediated by Dif and Rel. It is possible that the two
mutations independently make a "sick" fly worse off.
However, Dif and Rel are not required for viability, and
neither dl nor imd mutations enhance the loj mutant phenotype, although both genes affect viability in loj/+ animals.
In our study we did not identify expression changes in all
of the known immune-regulated genes. If both Dif and
Rel are activated in the loj mutant, one might expect that
all potential NF-κB target genes should be affected. However, NF-κB target sites in immune-responsive promoters
are variably responsive to NF-κB and can be modulated by
other factors to provide specialized immune responses
[50], possibly in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, the
loj mutant may not activate all possible NF-κB targets
because other cellular factors are needed for a strong
response.
Mechanisms for stress-induced activation of NF-κB
In mammals two potential mechanisms for ER stressinduced NF-κB activation have been described. The first
involves PERK-mediated translational inhibition of the
NF-κB inhibitor protein IκB [18,19]. In Drosophila loss of
IκB could only affect Dif signaling since Dif, but not Rel,
is maintained in an inactive form through an association
with the Drosophila IκB protein Cactus [48]. Degradation
of Cactus and release of its inhibitory effect on Dif allows
downstream transcriptional changes. In contrast, the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Rel is a bi-partite protein containing inhibitory as well as activating domains.
Similarly to the mammalian p105 and p100 NF-κB proteins, Rel activation involves a proteosome-mediated
cleavage event that releases the inhibitory domain from
the activating domain. Therefore, it is unlikely that PEKmediated translational attenuation of an inhibitor molecule functions in Rel activation.

The second proposed mechanism for mammalian NF-κB
activation due to ER stress is mediated by Ire-1 via an
interaction with the TNF-receptor-associated factor 2
(Traf2) [20]. Traf2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates
NF-κB and JNK signaling [[51], Reviewed in [52]]. Drosophila encodes a Traf2-like molecule, and there is evidence that Drosophila Traf proteins are involved in Toll,
Imd and JNK signaling [53-56]. One possible scenario for
NF-κB activation due to ER stress in Drosophila is that Ire1 modulates the Rel-induced ER stress pathways while Pek
translational attenuation regulates Dif signaling.
In yeast, loss of p24 protein function causes an ER stress
response, one consequence of which is secretion of the
heat shock protein and ER stress sensor BiP [26]. Interestingly, there is evidence in mammals that BiP and related

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:212

heat shock proteins bind to and activate Toll-like receptors [Reviewed in [57-59]]. Therefore, it may be possible
to induce NF-κB independently of PEK, Atf6 or Ire-1 if BiP
is secreted. In Drosophila, the Toll receptor regulates Dif
and Dorsal signaling. Even if BiP activation of Toll receptors plays a role in stress-induced NF-κB activation, it cannot account for the observation that Rel, which is not
regulated by Toll signaling, is induced and interacts genetically with loj. Since imd regulates Rel but does not interact
genetically with loj, Rel signaling in this p24 mutant context could be mediated by the Ire-1/Traf2 pathway rather
than via Imd. Similarly, the Ire-1/Traf2 pathway may
modulate the JNK response genes that are up regulated in
loj mutants (see Additional files 2, 3 and 5). Because Rel
activation requires Rel cleavage rather than disruption of
an inhibitory protein interaction, it is unlikely that Rel
activation is immediately downstream of Pek.
Our analysis did not identify the same set of stress-responsive genes previously shown to require Ire-1 but not other
components of the UPR/EOR response [14]. Only one
locus, Tequila, is down regulated in both experiments.
However this difference in affected genes may be due to
the stressors or the time periods examined.

and reduced Oamb protein expression impairs female
ovulation [63]. Loss of octopamine signaling via
decreased trafficking of the receptor or molecules
involved in octopamine or Oamb production could
account for the egg-laying defect in loj mutants.
In both loj mutant tissue samples the p24-2 gene
(CG33105) is up regulated (see Additional file 1). p24-2 is
a member of the Drosophila p24-alpha subfamily, while
loj is a member of the p24-gamma subfamily [22,28]. It is
possible that p24-2 can substitute for some loj functions
during development or in the adult. We plan to test these
hypotheses during future investigations into p24 protein
function in flies.

Conclusion
The genetic profiling data support our assertion that loss
of p24 function induces a stress response that includes
increasing the levels of NF-κB target gene transcripts, a
hallmark of the EOR. Furthermore, the decreased viability
of double mutants for loj and Dif or Rel suggests that these
NF-kB proteins and their downstream signaling pathways
play important roles in ameliorating the stress response.

Methods
There are other possibilities for the observed increases in
NF-κB target genes in the loj mutant. One is that the
observed stress response results from tissue damage occurring in loj mutants. Tissue damage could activate NF-κB
and stress response genes in the fat body. Another possibility is that increased levels are due to increased message
stability rather than activation of NF-κB in the adult. We
cannot rule out the possibility that changes in stability of
NF-κB target gene transcripts, rather than NF-κB activation, account for the observed expression differences
between loj and wild-type females.
Do loj p24 mutants have a trafficking defect?
Since loj mutants have increased expression of many genes
implicated in ER stress responses and loj mutations interact genetically with mutations in two NF-κB genes, it is
likely that intracellular trafficking is reduced in loj
mutants. Genes that encode components of the eggshell
(dec-1, Vm32E and Cp15) are down regulated in abdominal tissue (see Additional file 4). It is possible that trafficking of these proteins or is slowed in loj mutants and
provides feedback inhibition of transcription. Alternatively, these products may be decreased in the loj mutant
because egg production is slowed and fewer eggs of the
stages that express these genes are present in loj females.

Another interesting finding is that transcript levels of the
octopamine receptor Oamb are also decreased in the loj
mutant (see Additional file 4). Octopamine signaling is
required for egg laying in flies and other insects [60-62],

Drosophila Stocks
Drosophila melanogaster stocks and cross progeny were
maintained at 25°C on a 12 h light-dark cycle using a
standard cornmeal, sugar, agar and yeast culture medium.
The loj00898 and loj04026 alleles were described previously
[27]. The eca1 allele was provided by S. Bartoszewski [45].
dl1 and Df(3R)GB104, red/TM3, Sb Ser (which removes
eca) were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center (stock numbers 3236 and 1937, respectively). The Dif2 [41] and RelE20 [42] alleles used in this
study were provided by B. J. Taylor. A description of each
allele is available in Flybase (see Availability and requirements section for URL).
Microarray Analyses
Females of the genotypes loj00898/loj04026, loj00898/+, and
loj04026/+ were collected as virgins within 1–2 h of the
beginning of the 12 h lighted portion of the light-dark
cycle, kept in glass vials in groups of 20 or fewer flies, and
aspirated singly into new vials on day 3 after collection.
On day 4, a single wild-type male was aspirated into a vial
containing a single female and observed for mating. Only
females that mated within 30 min for 18–30 min were
collected for subsequent RNA extractions. Female abdomens were dissected away from the head/thorax 3 hours
after the end of the mating period and each of the two tissue types (abdomen or head with thorax) was quick-frozen in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA from
abdomen or head/thorax tissue was extracted in Trizol
using the manufacturer's protocol. Twelve female tissue

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:212

samples were collected for each of 6 independent RNA
extractions for loj00898/loj04026. Our control samples consisted of 6 loj00898/+ and 6 loj04026/+ samples combined
together for each of 6 independent RNA extractions. Three
experimental (loj00898/loj04026) and three control RNA
samples for each set of tissue were used for array hybridization. Sample labeling and hybridization to Drosophila
Genome 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) was performed at the
University of Kentucky Microarray Core Facility using
standard Affymetrix protocols for a total of 12 arrays (3
sets of experimental and control samples for each of the
two tissues).
Cyber-T was used to perform Bayesian statistical analyses
on expression values derived from dChipPM-MM and
dChipPM [64] and GCOS (Affymetrix) essentially as
described previously [65]. We set stringent parameters
and required that the final set of genes with altered expression levels have a significance value of p < 0.001 for all
three expression values (dChipPM-MM, dChipPM and
GCOS) and show at least a 1.5-fold difference from the
control samples. This analysis left us with a data set of 641
genes with expression changes in one or both tissues.
Real-time PCR (qPCR)
To validate the microarray results, the remaining twelve
RNA samples (3 experimental and 3 control preparations
for each of the two tissues) were used to prepare independent cDNA samples with the Superscript 1st Strand
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). cDNA preparations were
diluted 1:15, and 1.5 ul was used in each reaction for
qPCR using the SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in the ABI7700 or
ABI7500 Fast Real-time PCR system using the default run
parameters. For each plate, a melting curve analysis was
performed at the end of each run to test for primer specificity. Additionally, selected reactions were electrophoresed on agarose gels to view PCR products as a
second test for presence of the correct product.

Each plate also contained reactions to test for amplification specificity in the presence or absence of template.
rp49 primers were used for control amplification reactions
[27]. cDNAs from abdomen or head/thorax preparations
were analyzed separately. We selected 9 up-regulated
(AttC, CG6188, CG6687, CG15829, Frost, GstD5, IM23,
Socs36E, Tsp42Ed) and 5 down-regulated candidates
(CG8768, CG13793, ninaD, Tequila, UGP) for this analysis
and report the average fold changes from the tissues in
Additional files 1 and 2. In every case, samples showed a
transcriptional change in the direction expected from
microarray analyses and in most instances the differences
between loj mutants and controls were significantly different (p < 0.05) in both sample preparations. GstD5 transcripts were increased in loj head/thorax and abdomen

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/212

samples but the results were not significantly different
from controls. Down regulation of loj transcripts in loj
mutant tissue was reported previously [27].
To test eclair (eca) mutants for increased expression of
immune response genes, we performed a similar protocol
on cDNA prepared from eca/Df(3R)GB104 and control
(equal numbers of eca/+ and Df(3R)GB104/+) females
using primers that specifically amplified gene products
that are downstream of various stress or immune-activated pathways: CG6687 (Toll/Imd), Tsp42Ed (Imd/JNK),
Frost (Toll) and Socs36E (JAK/STAT). We were not able to
collect bai mutant females for analysis due to lethality of
bai mutations.
Viability Assays
We determined the number of animals of each of the possible genotypes that eclosed from stock vials for the following strains: (1) w; Dif2, cn bw/Cyo, ftz-lacZ; loj00898/
TM3, Sb ftz-lacZ (701 total animals scored); (2) loj00898,
RelE20/TM3, Sb (321 total animals scored); (3) dl1 cn1 sca1/
Cyo; loj00898/TM2 (128 total animals scored); (4) w; imd
EY08573/Cyo; loj00898/TM6b, Tb (205 total animals
scored). We also crossed loj00898, RelE20/TM3, Sb females to
either loj00898/TM3, Sb (206 animals scored) or RelE20/
TM3, Sb (77 animals scored) males and determined the
progeny genotypes. w; Dif2, cn bw/Cyo, ftz-lacZ; loj00898/
TM3, Sb ftz-lacZ was crossed to w; Dif2, cn bw/Cyo, ftz-lacZ;
loj04026/TM3, Sb ftz-lacZ (210 animals scored) to assay
interactions between Dif2and loj transheterozygous
mutants. A similar cross with dl1 in the loj00898or loj04026
background did not produce any dl1homozygous progeny
(data not shown). Stocks were maintained in noncrowded conditions and the number of animals of each
genotype that eclosed was determined on multiple days
over a multi-week period. Vials were cleared the day
before adult offspring were counted.

For strains containing Dif or dl alleles, each of the 4 possible genotypes from the stock cross is predicted to equally
represented due to Mendelian segregation. Since loj and
Rel are both on the 3rd chromosome, there are only two
possible genotypes from the stock cross from loj00898,
RelE20/TM3, Sb. The percentage of expected animals eclosing was calculated by dividing the total number of adult
animals of a given genotype by the total number of animals of the stock genotype.
From the crosses of loj00898, RelE20/TM3, Sb to either
loj00898/TM3, Sb or RelE20/TM3, Sb there are three classes of
expected progeny (e.g., (1) loj00898, RelE20/TM3, Sb (2)
loj00898/TM3, Sb and (3) loj00898, RelE20/loj00898) that
should each account for one-third of the total number of
offspring. We are not able to distinguish the two classes of
progeny that contain the TM3, Sb chromosome. There-

fore, we calculate the percentage of expected loj00898,
RelE20/loj00898 progeny by dividing the total number of
loj00898, RelE20/loj00898 progeny by one-half of the total
number of TM3, Sb progeny.
