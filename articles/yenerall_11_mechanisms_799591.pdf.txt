Mechanisms of intron gain and loss in Drosophila
Paul Yenerall1, Bradlee Krupa2 and Leming Zhou3,4*

Abstract
Background: It is widely accepted that orthologous genes have lost or gained introns throughout evolution.
However, the specific mechanisms that generate these changes have proved elusive. Introns are known to affect
nearly every level of gene expression. Therefore, understanding their mechanism of evolution after their initial
fixation in eukaryotes is pertinent to understanding the means by which organisms develop greater regulation and
complexity.
Results: To investigate possible mechanisms of intron gain and loss, we identified 189 intron gain and 297 intron
loss events among 11 Drosophila species. We then investigated these events for signatures of previously proposed
mechanisms of intron gain and loss. This work constitutes the first comprehensive study into the specific
mechanisms that may generate intron gains and losses in Drosophila. We report evidence of intron gain via
transposon insertion; the first intron loss that may have occurred via non-homologous end joining; intron gains via
the repair of a double strand break; evidence of intron sliding; and evidence that internal or 5’ introns may not
frequently be deleted via the self-priming of reverse transcription during mRNA-mediated intron loss. Our data also
suggest that the transcription process may promote or result in intron gain.
Conclusion: Our findings support the occurrence of intron gain via transposon insertion, repair of double strand
breaks, as well as intron loss via non-homologous end joining. Furthermore, our data suggest that intron gain may
be enabled by or due to transcription, and we shed further light on the exact mechanism of mRNA-mediated
intron loss.

Background
Spliceosomal introns, segments of RNA that are excised
by the spliceosome during the processing of pre-mRNA
in eukaryotes, are found in varying quantities and positions among orthologous genes. By identifying orthologs,
aligning gene sequences, and coupling intron absences/
presences with known species phylogenies, numerous
studies have identified the number of intron gains and
losses that have occurred among species throughout
evolution [1-11]. However, very little is known about
the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes
[12,13].
As a deeper understanding of gene expression
emerges, it is evident that introns not only increase proteome diversity through their well known role in alternative splicing [14], but also influence every stage of
pre-translational gene expression [15]. Important

regulatory elements such as miRNAs and snoRNAs are
commonly found within introns in animals [16], and
recently introns in the human genome have been shown
to harbor thousands of non-coding RNAs, key regulators
of gene expression [17]. The splicing process alone has
been shown to increase transcriptional efficiency and
the nuclear export of transcripts [15,18-21]. Therefore,
understanding the molecular mechanisms that create
and remove introns provides insight into one of the
mechanisms by which eukaryotic organisms develop
greater regulation and complexity.
Two previously hypothesized mechanisms of intron
loss are Reverse Transcriptase-Mediated Intron Loss
(referred to as RTMIL in this work) [22] and Genomic
Deletions. RTMIL occurs when cDNA, either directly or
after retroposition into the genome, recombines with an
intron-present gene, resulting in the precise deletion of
intron(s) [23]. Genomic deletions are general genomic
deletion events that, by chance, delete an intron [24].
Therefore, the genomic deletion of introns may occur
via various molecular mechanisms and may produce

precise or imprecise intron losses. Recently, double
strand break repair (DSBR) by non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) has been implicated as a common means
for the genomic deletion of introns [25]. RTMIL has
been demonstrated in yeast [26,27], and general genomic deletions are known to occur. However, the prevalence of each proposed mechanism of intron loss is
unknown.
Previously hypothesized mechanisms of intron gain
include: Intron Transposition [28], in which an intron
transposes or “reverse splices” into a previously intronless position in a transcript, and this transcript is then
reverse transcribed and recombined with the original
gene; Transposon Insertion [29], in which a transposon
inserts into a gene and forms a spliceable intron; Tandem Genomic Duplications [30], in which the tandem
duplication of a gene segment creates a spliceable
intron; Intron Transfer [31], in which a paralog transfers
an intron via gene conversion to an intron-absent position; Insertion of a Group II Intron [28], in which a
group II intron (a type of intron known to reverse splice
or retrohome in some organelle genomes) inserts into a
nuclear gene and creates a spliceosomal intron; Intron
Gain During Double Strand Break Repair [4], in which a
DNA segment that may function as a spliceable intron
is inserted during DSBR; and Intronization [32,33], in
which mutations in exonic sequence produce functional
splice signals, forming a new intron with previously exonic sequence.
Unlike most mechanisms of intron gain and loss
which involve the insertion or deletion of DNA segments, Intron Sliding [34-36] has been hypothesized to
present the appearance of concurrent intron loss and
gain without removing or inserting DNA. This may
occur when orthologous introns “slide” through a gene,
while leaving the coding sequence largely unaffected. If
the intron slides far enough from its original position, it
may appear as if a gene has both lost and gained an
intron. Evidence of intron sliding in Drosophila exists
[34]; however, there is debate over the viability of this
mechanism [35-38].
Out of all the proposed mechanisms of intron gain
and loss, only RTMIL has been shown to occur in vivo
[26,27]. Therefore, in order to find support for the
occurrence of other proposed mechanisms of intron
gain or loss, researchers have attempted to identify
intron gains or losses that appear to have occurred via a
specific mechanism. Evidence has been found to support
the occurrence of: intron loss due to genomic deletions
in Drosophila and Pufferfish [39,40]; intron gain by
intron transposition in Oikopleura [5]; intron gain by
transposon insertion in maize, rice and Oikopleura
[5,41,42]; intron gain by intron transfer in Chironomus
thummi and Aspergillus fungi [11,31]; intron gain by

tandem genomic duplications in a multitude of eukaryotes [34,43,44]; intron gain during DSBR in Daphnia
pulex and Aspergillus fungi [4,11]; intron gain by intronization in Cryptococcus and Caenorhabditis [33,37];
and intron sliding in Drosophila [34]. However, these
findings are insufficient to prove the existence of any
proposed mechanism. In order to determine if these
proposed mechanisms of intron gain or loss are universal mechanisms operating in all eukaryotes, as opposed
to either singular events or mechanisms that only occur
in a few species, multiple unambiguous instances of
each mechanism must be located in all eukaryotic
kingdoms.
Only a few of the proposed mechanisms of intron gain
or loss have been shown to occur in Drosophila
[6,34,39]. Therefore, we chose to investigate the ability
of all proposed mechanisms to operate in Drosophila.
To this end, we first identified high confidence cases of
intron gains and losses among 11 Drosophila species (D.
melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, D. sechellia,
D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. persimilis, D.
willistoni, D. mojavensis, and D. grimshawi). We then
analyzed these events extensively for signatures of previously proposed mechanisms of intron gain and loss.
These 11 well-sequenced and well-annotated Drosophila
species enabled us to identify intron gains and losses
that have occurred relatively recently (2-40 million years
ago) [45]. This fine time scale allowed us to analyze
these events before extensive sequence divergence may
have occurred, which has the potential to disguise the
mechanism(s) underlying these events.

Results
Within the final dataset of 353 orthologs, we identified
189 intron gains and 287 intron losses with 112 gains
and 94 losses located at ancestral nodes (Figure 1) and
77 gains and 193 losses located within a single species
(Table 1). Using a different dataset, we support previous
findings of widespread heterogeneity in the rates of
intron gain and loss among Drosophila species [6].
Overall, in comparison to introns from all 11 Drosophila
species (59% AT content, average size 1015 bp), gained
introns were of similar composition but shorter in
length (64% AT content, average size 398 bp). Additionally, in accordance with previous research in Drosophila
[1,6], these gained introns were biased towards the 5’
end of genes (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.0421,
Figure 2).
Mechanisms of Intron Loss
Reverse Transcriptase-Mediated Intron Loss

Because RTMIL leaves behind no distinct mechanistic
signatures, it is only possible to determine its prevalence
by analyzing intron deletion biases. These biases arise

due to the involvement of reverse transcriptase during
RTMIL. Reverse transcriptase has been proposed to be
primed on the poly(A) tail of mRNA [22] and transcribe
from the 3’ end to the 5’ end of mRNA. However,
reverse transcriptase may not always reach the 5’ end of
mRNA [46]. Therefore, if intron deletions have commonly occurred via RTMIL, intron deletions are
expected to be biased towards the 3’ end of genes. Some
researchers have identified this bias [1,2,24,44], but

others have not [5,6,9,40,42]. Previous reports on the
distribution of intron loss positions in Drosophila have
been conflicting [1,6]. We found lost intron positions to
be uniformly distributed throughout the length of genes
that experienced intron loss(es) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, p = 0.2112, Figure 3). Other hypothesized mechanistic pathways of RTMIL, whereby RTMIL may delete
internal or 5’ introns without deleting 3’ introns [44,47],
may explain this distribution. Alternatively, RTMIL may

have not deleted the majority of lost introns in our
dataset.
Because RTMIL is transcript-mediated, if RTMIL was
a frequent mechanism of intron loss, genes that have
lost introns should commonly be germline expressed
[23]. To test this assumption, we extracted the D. mel
ortholog of each gene that experienced an intron loss
from our dataset. We then checked these orthologs for
moderate germline expression using data downloaded
from Flybase [45], the modENCODE project [48], and
FlyAtlas [49]. Using this dataset, 187 out of the 287
genes that experienced intron loss were shown to have
moderate germline expression. In comparison to the frequency in which we found genes to be germline
expressed in D. melanogaster (7, 212 out of 13, 752), we
found a significant bias for genes that experienced
intron loss to be germline expressed (Pearson chi-square
test, p < 0.05).
Another deletion bias expected if RTMIL has commonly deleted introns is the frequent loss of adjacent

Page 4 of 11

introns. Previous investigations have found adjacent
introns to be lost more commonly than would be
expected purely by chance [1,11,24,50]. Our dataset contained a total of 9 adjacent intron losses that appear to
have occurred simultaneously in the genes Dwil
\GK21739, Dsec\GM16466, and Dwil\GK24430. We
would have expected 2.7 adjacent intron losses to have
occurred purely by chance [1]. Therefore, our dataset
show a significant bias for adjacent introns to be lost
(Pearson chi-square test, p < 0.05).
In one gene that experienced adjacent intron losses,
Dwil\GK24430, the first and last introns were conserved
while two internal introns were lost. Because these
losses were adjacent and appear to have occurred simultaneously, we assume these introns were deleted by
RTMIL. The exact mechanism by which RTMIL may
remove internal or 5’ intron(s) but conserve 3’ intron(s)
has proved elusive but received considerable attention
[9,11,13,44,51,52]. The most commonly proposed
mechanism to account for internal or 5’ intron loss(es)
by RTMIL is the formation of a double stranded mRNA
secondary structure upstream from the 3’ conserved
intron position(s). This secondary structure then “selfprimes” reverse transcription during RTMIL, excluding
the conserved intron position(s) from reverse transcription and subsequent recombination (i.e. intron loss)
[9,44,51,52]. Because the ortholog of Dwil\GK24430 in
D. melanogaster, elgi, was shown to have high expression levels in the ovaries of adult flies [48] and orthologs
of Dwil\GK24430 have highly similar sequences (which
suggests that the coding sequence has been conserved),
Dwil\GK24430 was investigated for the ability to have
self-primed reverse transcription during RTMIL. We
determined the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of
Dwil\GK24430 using the Augustus program [53], determined the polyadenylation site using PolyAPred [54],
appended poly(A) tails of various lengths, and ran these
predicted mRNA sequences through the RNA folding
program mfold [55]. All predicted secondary structures
could not account for the pattern of intron losses that
occurred in Dwil\GK24430. Therefore, it is not likely
that the self-priming of reverse transcription during
RTMIL accounted for these internal intron losses.
Genomic Deletions

Similar to intron loss via RTMIL, the precise genomic
deletion of an intron is difficult to confidently detect
after its occurrence. Therefore, we identified imprecise
intron losses. To locate imprecise losses, we examined
the former intron-exon junctions of all lost introns. If
the intron deletion event appeared to have inserted
nucleotides into the coding sequence of the gene, these
inserted nucleotides were extracted and compared to
conserved orthologous introns using the FASTA program [56]. Using this method we identified an imprecise

intron loss that may have occurred via NHEJ (Figure 4),
a recently hypothesized mechanism of intron loss [25].
Direct repeats that likely flanked this intron prior to
deletion may have mediated deletion by providing a
recessed microhomology for efficient ligation during
NHEJ [57].
Because introns flanked by direct repeats have been
hypothesized to be preferentially deleted via genomic
deletions [47], it is expected that throughout evolution,
introns flanked by direct repeats will be preferentially
lost. Therefore, in an attempt to determine the prevalence of intron loss via genomic deletions in our dataset,
for each intron loss identified within a single species we
searched the intron-exon junctions of the closest (in
evolutionary distance) conserved orthologous intron for
the presence of direct repeats ≥ 5 bp in length. In our
dataset, 27% of these introns were flanked by direct
repeats, nearly identical to the percent of direct repeats
found flanking 100 randomly selected conserved introns
(26%). This suggests that RTMIL may have deleted the
majority of introns in our dataset. However, it is possible that sequence divergence throughout evolution may
have eliminated many direct repeats that originally
flanked these conserved orthologous introns.
Mechanisms of Intron Gain
Transposon Insertion

To identify intron gains that occurred via transposon
insertion, all gained intronic sequences were compared
to the canonical transposon sequences from Flybase [45]
using the FASTA program [56]. A hit between the third
intron in Dsec\GM26034 and the retrotransposon
Doc1053 occurred with 98.4% similarity and 99% coverage. Target site duplications (TSDs) are located at the 5’
end and 15 nucleotides downstream from the end of
this intron, indicating that the insertion of Doc1053
alone resulted in intron gain (Figure 5).
Double Strand Break Repair

DSBR has recently been proposed to result in intron
gain if NHEJ inserts filler DNA that may function as a
spliceable intron [4,58]. It has been shown that this filler
DNA may be preferentially of mitochondrial origin
[59,60]. To identify cases of intron gain that occurred
via the repair of double strand breaks, we compared all

gained intronic sequences to their respective nuclear
and mitochondrial genomes. Eight gained introns (Dwil
\GK13533 intron 2, Dana\GF12884 intron 3, Dper
\GL20060 intron 2, Dmel\CG9297 intron 4, Dmoj
\GI21017 intron 5, Dmoj\GI21017 intron 6, Dvir
\GJ24248 intron 8, and Dwil\GK24841 intron 1, average
length = 113 bp) matched to their respective mitochondrial genomes with ≥ 90% query sequence coverage and
e-value ≤ 0.1, suggesting that these introns may have
been inserted via NHEJ. One of these introns, Dwil
\GK24465 intron 5, displayed significant similarity to a
mitochondrial sequence (Figure 6). Many other hits
were found with lower coverage levels (60-70%) but better e-values (e ≤ 10-4).
Because direct repeats frequently flank filler DNA
inserted via NHEJ [61], to determine the prevalence of
intron gain via NHEJ in our dataset we searched the
intron-exon junctions of all gained introns for direct
repeats of length ≥ 5 bp. We identified direct repeats
flanking 19 out of 77 gained introns; however, in comparison to a random set of 100 conserved introns (26 of
which were flanked by direct repeats), this level did not
reach statistical significance. This suggests two possibilities. One is that direct repeats may not commonly flank
DNA inserted by NHEJ in Drosophila, as the frequency
and size of direct repeats inserted by NHEJ when using
filler DNA has been shown to vary in different organisms and cell types [61-63]. Alternatively, NHEJ may not
be a common mechanism of intron gain in Drosophila.
Transcription-Mediated Intron Gain?

We did not identify any intron gains that occurred via
intron transposition in our dataset, the only proposed
transcript-mediated mechanism of intron gain. However,
genes that have experienced intron gains are highly
overrepresented in our germline expression dataset (135
out of 189, Pearson chi-square test, p < 0.01), similar to
findings in Caenorhabditis [10]. This overrepresentation
of germline expression in genes that have experienced
intron gain suggests that intron gain may be enabled by
or due to transcription.
INTRON SLIDING

Intron sliding, the sliding or relocation of orthologous
introns, has been proposed to be a rare event that may

move introns very small distances [35,37,38]. We identified 4 introns that appear to have slid more than 10 bp
while leaving the coding sequence largely unaffected. To
ensure that these were bona fide cases of intron sliding,
as opposed to concurrent intron losses and gains, we
compared the sequence of introns that appeared to have
slid to the sequence of their closest (in evolutionary distance) suspected orthologous introns. Three cases of
intron sliding displayed moderate similarity between
these introns (e-value ≤ 0.1), while one, the fourth
intron in Dwil\GK22863, displayed significant similarity
to its suspected ortholog intron, intron four in Dper
\GL17458 (Additional file 1, Figure S2), indicating that
this intron experienced intron sliding.

Discussion
Prior investigations into intron gain and loss in Drosophila [1,6] have yielded different results from the ones
presented here. Our results differ greatly from those of
Coulombe-Huntington and Majewski [1], who reported
intron loss to be much more prominent than intron
gain in Drosophila. This difference can be attributed to
different methodology and datasets. Coulombe-

Huntington and Majewski mapped splice site junctions
from D. melanogaster onto the other 10 Drosophila species used in this study, whereas we used high quality,
full genome annotations produced by the Drosophila
research community [45] for the 11 species. As Coulombe-Huntington and Majewski noted, their methodology did not detect events that had occurred in the other
10 Drosophila species, and was therefore unable to
detect intron gain events that had occurred in other
species. Our results are also slightly different from those
of Farlow et al. [6]. This is likely due to different methods of gene annotation in Drosophila species other than
D. melanogaster. Farlow et al.’s annotations primarily
relied upon GeneWise [64], whereas the annotations
employed here were produced using a compilation of
various ab initio and extrinsic methods [45]. This produced markedly different ortholog datasets; only 734 of
our initial 1, 611 orthologs overlap between these two
studies. Other differences include our use of a distant
outlier, A. gambiae, which greatly increased the power
of Dollo parsimony at peripheral branches, and our
inclusion of D. sechellia and D. persimilis. Finally, it
should be noted that the stringent criteria employed

was significantly lower (Pearson chi-square test, p < 0.05) than the score between the original sequences.

here was designed specifically to eliminate the maximal
amount of false-positive intron gain and loss events,
rather than to identify the precise number of intron gain
and loss events among the Drosophila species. Therefore, the number of intron gains and losses reported
here may not necessarily reflect the rate of intron turnover in Drosophila.
Our analyses suggest that intron loss frequently occurs
via RTMIL in Drosophila. Adjacent introns were lost
more frequently than would be expected purely by
chance, and genes experiencing intron loss were commonly germline expressed. However, intron deletions
were not biased towards the 3’ end of genes (Figure 3),
as would be expected if RTMIL deleted the majority of
introns. Nonetheless, we did not find evidence suggesting that introns were frequently lost via the precise
genomic deletion of introns. There are a number of proposed mechanisms that may explain 5’ or internal intron
loss by RTMIL without the loss of 3’ intron(s). Our data
suggest that the most commonly proposed mechanism,
the self-priming of reverse transcription during RTMIL
[9,44,51,52], may not frequently produce internal intron
losses via RTMIL in Drosophila. An alternative explanation for 5’ or internal intron loss by RTMIL without the
loss of 3’ intron(s) was proposed by Sharpton et al. in C.
elegans. Researchers elegantly demonstrated that genes
experiencing two or more 3’ intron losses (presumably
by RTMIL) are preferentially recombined during meiosis
at their 3’ ends with alleles that have not experienced
intron loss [44]. This may have accounted for the uniform distribution of intron losses found in this study in
Drosophila (Figure 3).
A recent study suggested that NHEJ may play a prominent role in both intron gain and loss [25], and our
investigation in Drosophila supports this idea. Similar to
previous research [4,11], we identified intron gains that
likely occurred via NHEJ using mitochondrial DNA (an
example is shown in Figure 6). We also identified the
first case of an intron loss that may have occurred via
NHEJ (Figure 4). The ability of NHEJ to both create and
remove introns suggests an interesting scenario in
intron evolution: introns gained by NHEJ may commonly be flanked by direct repeats [61], and introns
flanked by direct repeats may be preferentially deleted
by NHEJ [47,57]. This may be a mechanism by which
new introns are “screened” for selective advantages.
Under selection pressure, new introns that provide an
advantage to the species may be conserved, whereas
those that do not may be lost.
For mechanisms of intron gain, we identified an intron
gain that unambiguously occurred via the insertion of a
transposable element (Figure 5). In combination with
previous findings of intron gain via transposon insertion
in maize, rice, and Oikopleura [5,41,42], this strongly

Page 7 of 11

suggests that transposons may create novel introns in all
eukaryotes that harbor active transposons.
In our dataset, 187 gained introns do not appear to
have been definitively created by any of the proposed
mechanisms of intron gain. It is possible that sequence
divergence has obscured the source of some of these
introns. However, this finding is perplexing, especially
for the 7 gained introns found between D. per and D.
pse, which likely radiated only 2 million years ago [65].
We identified a significant bias for genes that have
experienced intron gain to be germline expressed, which
suggests that transcription may play a prominent role in
intron gain. Nonetheless, we find no evidence of intron
gain via intron transposition, the only proposed transcript-mediated mechanism of intron gain. Furthermore,
intron gains in Drosophila are biased towards the 5’ end
of genes (Figure 2) [1,6], indicating that reverse transcription may not play a significant role in intron gain.
This is further supported by a recent investigation into
the role of reverse transcriptase in intron gain and loss
[66]. Together, these findings suggest that the act of
transcription itself may promote or cause intron gain.
We speculate that this may be due to transcription-associated recombination (TAR). TAR generally uses homologous recombination [67]; however, TAR has been
shown to occasionally use non-homologous recombination [68,69] and is functionally different from homology-directed DSBR [70]. It is therefore possible that
TAR may occasionally insert DNA segments that function as introns. However, a deeper understanding of
TAR, which is still poorly characterized, is necessary to
fully explore this possibility. Alternatively, uncharacterized errors by or interactions with the transcriptional
machinery may facilitate or result in intron gain.
Finally, we identified one unambiguous case of intron
sliding in Drosophila. A previous investigation that
located near intron pairs also found evidence of intron
sliding in Drosophila [34]. This report, in combination
with our findings, strongly suggests that intron sliding
occurs in Drosophila. However, we do note that intron
sliding does not appear to occur in all organisms
[35,37]. Therefore, further research into the possibility
of this mechanism to operate in other species is
necessary.

Conclusion
The use of 11 well-annotated Drosophila species and an
annotated outlier, A. gam, as well as the strict criteria
used to identify intron gains and losses, likely produced
a low false-positive rate. Publicly available data for Drosophila - such as mitochondrial genome sequences,
extensive expression data, and a well-characterized
transposon set - provided us with excellent tools to
determine if intron gains or losses occurred via any

Yenerall et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:364
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/364

previously proposed mechanisms. Combined, this data
enabled us to identify intron gains that occurred via
transposon insertion and double strand break repair.
Furthermore, our data suggest that transcription may
promote or occasionally cause intron gain. We speculate
that this may occur via TAR or uncharacterized errors
by or interactions with the transcriptional machinery.
However, the definitive mechanism by which this may
occur eludes us and awaits further investigation.
As research progresses, the exact molecular mechanisms of intron loss are becoming more clear. Our data
suggest that RTMIL was responsible for the majority of
intron losses identified in this study. However, we also
found evidence suggesting that the self-priming of
reverse transcription during RTMIL may not occur. It is
likely that a different hypothesis may account for internal or 5’ intron losses via RTMIL [44]. We also identified the first case of intron loss that may have occurred
via NHEJ (Figure 4) and speculate that the ability of
NHEJ to both generate and delete introns may act as a
“screening” mechanism for new introns. Finally, we
identified one unambiguous case of the controversial
mechanism of intron sliding.
In order to identify and fully understand the molecular mechanisms of intron gain and loss, further research
into the ability of proposed mechanisms to operate in
other species is necessary. It is likely that different
mechanisms operate with varying intensities in different
species. Consequently, the use of various species
increases the chances of detecting these events. Also,
demonstration of these mechanisms in multiple eukaryotic kingdoms is necessary to determine whether these
are common mechanisms of intron gain or loss, singular
events, or mechanisms that occur in only one species.
Investigations at the population level may prove particularly fruitful as they will likely identify events before
sequence divergence may obscure their mechanistic origin. Furthermore, it would be even better if in vitro or
in vivo experiments can be designed and conducted to
verify these mechanisms. For example, a recent in vivo
study found that the insertion of a group II intron into
a nuclear gene abolishes gene expression [71], strongly
suggesting that group II introns no longer create spliceosomal introns. An interesting assay for future
research would be to test the ability of NHEJ to delete
or insert introns by continuously inducing a double
strand break under certain conditions.

Methods
Obtaining Orthologs

Most data files (transposons, chromosomes, gene
regions, coding regions, intron sequences and annotation files) for the 11 Drosophila species investigated

Page 8 of 11

were downloaded from Flybase (release FB2011_01)
[45]. Mitochondrial genomes were obtained from GenBank [GenBank: NC_005780, NC_001322, NC_001709,
BK006335-BK006341]. To ascertain orthologous genes,
an all-against-all comparison among coding sequences
of all 11 species was performed using the FASTA program [56]. Only reciprocal best hits with e-value ≤ 10-30,
similarity ≥ 70% and query sequence coverage ≥ 80%
were selected and used to construct an orthologous
gene matrix. Considerable debate exists as to the best
method of ortholog detection; however, we chose to
identify orthologs using reciprocal best hits as this has
been shown to produce very low false-positive rates
[72]. This process yielded 1, 611 orthologs. Orthologs
lacking introns in all 11 species were discarded, yielding
a matrix of 1, 405 orthologs. The orthologs in this
matrix are 97% identical to Flybase’s ortholog dataset.
The 9 genes that did not match to Flybase’s ortholog
dataset did not experience any intron gain or loss events
and therefore did not affect our final results.
Generating Alignments

Artificial introns composed of 30 X’s were insertd into
intronic positions in each coding sequence and each
group of orthologs was globally aligned using the
ClustalW program [73] with gap open penalty 80,
gap extension penalty 0, gap separation penalty 10 and
transition weight 1. An example of a global alignment
using artificial introns is shown in Additional file 1,
Figure S3. Homogenous artificial introns of length 30
were used for two reasons: they assign consistent
weight to each intron position during alignment and
produce alignments that are easily readable for further
analyses. An ad hoc program was then created to
locate orthologous introns and convert each alignment
into an intron absence/presence (0/1) matrix. All
alignments were manually inspected for sequence
identity flanking intron positions. If the alignment
flanking an intron had a low similarity level, the corresponding 0/1 column in the matrix was deleted,
removing these intron(s) from further analyses (an
example of an excluded intron is shown in Additional
file 1, Figure S4). This criterion eliminated 1006 multiple sequence alignments, leaving 399 alignments for
further analyses.
Identifying Intron Gains and Losses

All multiple sequence alignments were then categorized
into 2 groups: those that had discordant intron presences/absences nested within the 11 Drosophila species
(Group A, 252 alignments) and those that did not
(Group B, 147 alignments). For Group B, if possible an
ortholog in Anopheles gambiae (A. gam) was located to

Yenerall et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:364
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/364

be used as an outlier. A. gam’s genome was downloaded
from the UCSC genome browser [74] and mRNA
sequences were downloaded from the RefSeq database
[GenBank:PRJNA163] [75]. The annotation of A. gam
was generated by mapping mRNA sequences back onto
A. gam’ was generated by mapping mRNA sequences
back onto A. gams’s genome using the program ESTMapper [76]. Orthologs were identified using the
FASTA program and extracting reciprocal best hits with
e-value ≤ 10 -30 , similarity ≥ 60% and query sequence
coverage ≥ 60%. If an ortholog was found in A. gam,
alignments in Group B were regenerated and reexamined. For alignments in Group B, if no ortholog could
be located in A. gam, the alignment was excluded. This
criterion removed 46 alignments, resulting in the final
dataset of 353 multiple sequence alignments (see Additional file 2 for all orthologs used in final analyses).
Intron absence/presence matrices for both Group A and
B were then processed separately through the program
Malin [77] to identify intron gains and losses using
Dollo parsimony. Example alignments of intron gains,
losses, and alignments that required the outlier A. gam
can be found in Additional file 1, Figures S5-S9.
Intron Quality Controls

The ability to accurately identify intron gains and losses
relies upon accurate gene annotation. The multitude of
comparative and ab initio gene finding programs that
were used to annotate genes in the 11 Drosophila genomes and the use of well annotated D. melanogaster
genes during the annotation of the other 10 Drosophila
genomes greatly increased the reliability of these annotations [78]. However, since some annotations in the Drosophila species other than D. melanogaster may lack
experimental validation, annotation errors may exist.
Therefore, we applied quality controls to each intron
identified as an intron gain in a single species. First, we
excluded all intron gains located within a single species
that were length 3 n (where “n” is an integer) and did
not contain a premature termination codon (PTC) (i.e.
DNA segments that, if included in the predicted transcript, would not be expected to elicit nonsensemediated decay). This criterion was based on a recent
study in Drosophila that also used computationally
annotated introns to identify intron gains and losses. In
that study, 86% of predicted intron gains that were
located in a single species and were length 3 n without
PTCs were annotation errors as opposed to novel
introns [6]. Secondly, we removed all intron gains
located in a single species with noncanonical splice sites.
Ancestral intron gains (intron gains found in more than
one species) and intron losses were not subject to
increased scrutiny as the detection of these events is
relatively straightforward.
