Abstract
Background: Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite variants have been identified in several geographical areas. The real
implication of the genetic variation in this region of the P. vivax genome has been questioned for a long time. Although
previous studies have observed significant association between VK210 and the Duffy blood group, we present here
that evidences of this variation are limited to the CSP central portion.
Methods: The phylogenetic analyses were accomplished starting from the amplification of conserved domains of 18
SSU RNAr and Cyt B. The antibodies responses against the CSP peptides, MSP-1, AMA-1 and DBP were detected by
ELISA, in plasma samples of individuals infected with two P. vivax CS genotypes: VK210 and P. vivax-like.
Results: These analyses of the two markers demonstrate high similarity among the P. vivax CS genotypes and
surprisingly showed diversity equal to zero between VK210 and P. vivax-like, positioning these CS genotypes in the
same clade. A high frequency IgG antibody against the N- and C-terminal regions of the P. vivax CSP was found as
compared to the immune response to the R- and V- repetitive regions (p = 0.0005, Fisher's Exact test). This difference
was more pronounced when the P. vivax-like variant was present in the infection (p = 0.003, Fisher's Exact test). A high
frequency of antibody response against MSP-1 and AMA-1 peptides was observed for all P. vivax CS genotypes in
comparison to the same frequency for DBP.
Conclusions: This results target that the differences among the P. vivax CS variants are restrict to the central repeated
region of the protein, mostly nucleotide variation with important serological consequences.
Background
The circumsporozoite surface protein (CSP) is the most
abundant polypeptide present in the sporozoite covering.
This protein is involved in the motility and invasion of the
sporozoite during its entrance in the hepatocyte [1,2].
Some years ago, CSP was studied as the main goal for
anti-malarial vaccine development; however the existence of variations in the repetitive sequence of its central
portion has been hindering these studies. Plasmodium
vivax CSP sequences analyses revealed that parasites

have repeats belonging to one of two types of nonapeptide repeat units, GDRA(A/D)GQPA or ANGA(G/D)(N/
D)QPG, named VK210 or VK247 respectively [3,4]. In
1993, a new human malaria parasite from a P. vivaxinfected person was identified by Qari et al [5], who
named it P. vivax-like. The CSP sequence of P. vivax-like
has an 11-mer repeat sequence, APGANQ(E/G)GGAA,
and is different to the two previously described variants
[5,6].
All P. vivax CS genotypes have a worldwide distribution
and have been identified for several authors [7-17]. In
Brazil, the occurrence of the three genotypes in pure and
mixed infections was described [11,17]. Seroreactivity
tests have identified the presence of three variant genotypes in samples from the State of São Paulo [10,16] and

in indigenous populations [8,9] and other communities of
the Amazon region [13]. Studies have also reported differences in the infectivity of anophelines to the variant
genotypes, indicating that Anopheles darlingi and Anopheles pseudopunctipennis were more susceptible to the
infection by VK210 [18,19]. These findings could be a
consequence of differences in the emergence of this genotype in specific geographical regions or suggest that the
VK210 genotype is the best-adapted variant in the world
[11].
The successful of the vaccine against malaria can be
related to the immunological intervention in the development of the parasite in the human host or mosquito vector. To improve the health and quality of more than one
billion people around the world, several efforts have been
addressed for the identification and antigenic characterization of different P. vivax antigens, among these the
preerythrocytic antigens such as circumsporozoite protein (CSP) [20], the blood-stage proteins as merozoite
surface protein 1 (MSP-1) [21,22], apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) [22,23], and the Duffy binding protein
(DBP), an merozoite antigen that interacts with the Duffy
blood group in the host cells surface [22,24]. Currently,
several authors have considered the CSP of P. vivax as the
major target for the development of recombinant malaria
vaccines, since the synthetic peptides starting from this
protein induce a high and specific humoral response as
the induced by natural exposure of humans to malaria
[25-31]. Moreover, starting from the description of the P.
vivax CS genotypes, VK210, VK247 and P. vivax-like, several studies proposed the existence of differences among
those that seem to go besides variations in the repetitive
portion of the protein, as geographical distribution,
transmission intensity, vectorial competence, immune
and treatment responses and drug resistance
[11,18,19,32-34].
Many studies are being conducted to better understand
the age and origin of the P. vivax as a human parasite
[35,36]. Low microsatellite and tandem repeat variability
indicate that P. vivax infected humans recently (10,000
years ago) [37]. Indeed, a different study based on polymorphisms of two nuclear and one mitochondrial gene
places this parasite origin between 45,000 and 81,000
years ago [35]. In addition, P. vivax seems to be related to
the clade of parasites found in Asian cercopithecines,
indicating its origin in Asia via a host-switch from parasites found in non-human primates, such as macaques
[35,36,38]. Little it is known about the characterization of
the P. vivax variants, since analyses of the non-repetitive
portion of CS gene showed that these genotypes belong
to a same clade, including several types of primate Plasmodium species [35,39]. Nevertheless, the important
question remains whether the P. vivax CS repeated region
is a limited, mostly simple base variation [40] or if these

Page 2 of 8

variants represent the existence of a new species or subspecies of Plasmodium causing human malaria, with
major biological consequences [6].
Here, this work contributes to the understanding of the
implication of the central repetitive region variation of
the CS in the P. vivax genome by phylogenetic tools and
to the evaluation of the humoral immune response
against different parasite antigens.

Methods
Subjects

After given written informed consent, peripheral blood
samples were drawn from malaria patients living in four
Brazilian Amazon endemic areas (Macapá, Amapá State;
Novo Repartimento, Pará State; Porto Velho, Rondônia
State and Plácido de Castro, Acre State). All individuals
enrolled in this study complied with the following criteria: they sought medical assistance for clinical malaria
symptoms, were over 18 years old and had a positive
malaria diagnosis by thick blood film for P. vivax. The
genomic DNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform
method [41] or using a commercially available kit (EasyDNA™, Invitrogen, USA), and a semi-nested PCR was
performed using P. vivax-specific small-subunit (SSU)
rDNA primers to confirm the Plasmodium diagnosis
[42]. The P. vivax CS genotypes were determined as
described by Alves et al [43].
Molecular analyses

For the phylogenetic reconstruction, a subset of the P.
vivax field samples was used and data for non-human
Plasmodium spp. samples were obtained from GenBank.
Natural hosts type, geographic origins and GenBank
accession numbers of the out groups are described in
additional file 1: Hosts type, geographic origins and GenBank accession numbers of the out groups. All amplification reactions were performed in a thermocycler (DNA
MasterCycler; Eppendorf, USA). The PCR-amplified
products were purified by using GFX (GE Healthcare,
United Kingdom) and EXOSAP (USB, USA) PCR purification kits, according to the manufacturer's protocol.
DNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye™ Terminator V3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit on ABI 3100 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Amplification of the molecular markers
18 small sub unit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene analyses

The amplification of a target area between variable
regions 7 and 8 of the 18 SSU rRNA gene from P. vivax
was designed as described by Santos-Ciminera et al [44].
PCR was performed using the primer pairs VAR1 (5'CTT GGA TGG TGA TGC ATG GCC - 3') and VAR2
(5'- ATC TTT CAA TCG GTA GGA GCG AC - 3'). The
reaction mixture contained buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl with

Souza-Neiras et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:178
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/178

pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 200 μM of each of the four dNTPs,
10 μM of each oligonucleotide primer, 1 μg DNA template and 0.5 U of ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) to a final volume of 25 μL. All amplification
cycles included to an initial cycle of 95°C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 68°C for 1 min, and
72°C for 1 min, then a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
Cytochrome B gene analyses

The cytochrome B (Cyt B) sequences were amplified by
PCR using sets of primers: PC1 (5'- GCTACAGGTGCATCTCTTGTATTC - 3') and PC2 (5' - CACTTACAGTATATCCTCCACATAACCA - 3'). A reaction mixture
of buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 200 μM of
each of the four dNTPs, 10 μM of each oligonucleotide
primer, 1 μg DNA template and 0.5 U of ampli-Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen, USA). The amplification conditions were as follows: first, 1 min at 94°C, followed by 30
cycles with 0.5 min of denaturation at 94°C, annealing at
40°C for 0.5 min and elongation at 72°C for 1.5 min. After
30 cycles, a final elongation step at 72°C for 3 min was
carried out. The agarose gels were stained with ethidium
bromide and analysed with a Gel Doc 2000 illuminator
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses

The sequences were edited and aligned with the programs MEGA (version 4.1) and BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor by the CLUSTAL W tool. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed with neighbor-joining (NJ),
using the program MEGA (version 4.1), with p distance
which takes into account the possibility of high bias in the
transition/transversion and in G+C content, derived of
the position of the first, second and third codon [45]. The
reliability of the NJ trees is assessed by the bootstrap
method with 500 replications [46].
Assessment of the serological response against P. vivax CS
genotypes in the current infections

IgG antibodies against four CSP peptides (N-terminal [N]
and C-terminal [C], repetitive region corresponding to
the VK210 [R] and repetitive region corresponding to the
VK247 [V]) [47], MSP-1 N- terminal fragment (rPv200L)
[48], recombinant peptide of the AMA-1 [49] and of the
DBP [50] were detected by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), in plasma samples in infected individuals with P. vivax CS genotypes.
Statistical analysis

The serological data were performed using R version
2.8.1 statistical software The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria [51]. Differences among the
frequencies of responders were analysed using Pearson's
chi-square or, alternatively, the Fisher's exact test. Differences were considered significant when p-value ≤ 0.05.

Results
Phylogeny of P. vivax CS genotypes, VK210 and P. vivax-like

The analyses of the two markers show high similarity
among the P. vivax CS genotypes, with nucleotide diversity equal to zero (p = 0.224, t Student's test), positioning
the genotypes VK210 and P. vivax-like in the same clade
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). The genetic distances between CS
genotypes from the Plasmodium species analysed are
described in Additional file 2 and Additional file 3:
Genetic distances between 18 SSU rRNA and Cyt B genes
from Plasmodium spp. The blood samples infected with
VK247 genotypes were not included in this study,
because of the reduced numbers of VK247 samples (n =
4) and low quality of the material.
Antibody response against the CSP, MSP-1, AMA-1 and DBP
peptides

A higher frequency IgG antibody against the N- and Cterminal regions of the P. vivax CSP was found as compared to the immune response to the R- and V- repetitive
regions (p = 0.0005, Fisher's exact test). Antibody
responses against the peptides of the CSP repetitive central region [R] and [V] compared displayed a lower frequency against the [V] peptide, which corresponds to the
central region of the VK247 variant, in individuals with
VK210 genotype (p < 0.005, Fisher's exact test). When P.
vivax-like genotype was present in the infection a lower
antibody response against [R] and [V] peptides was
observed (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). None other significant association was found with de CS genotypes in
the infection (Table 1).
A high frequency of antibody response against MSP-1
and AMA-1 peptides was observed for all P. vivax CS
genotypes in comparison to the same frequency for DBP.
A high frequency of antibody response against MSP-1
(rPv200L) and AMA-1 peptides was observed for all the
P. vivax CS genotypes (Table 2) in comparison to same
frequency for DBP (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). However, significant differences were not observed among the
immune responses of individuals infected with the P.
vivax CS genotypes for none of the analysed peptides.

Discussion
Starting from the description of the P. vivax CS genotypes, VK210, VK247 and P. vivax-like, several studies
proposed the existence of differences among those that
seem to go besides variations in the repetitive portion of
the protein, as geographical distribution, transmission
intensity, vectorial competence, immune and treatment
responses and drug resistance [11,18,19,32-34]. The real
implication of the genetic variation in this region of the P.
vivax genome has been questioned for a long time.
Although previous studies of our group have observed
significant association between VK210 and the Duffy

blood group [17], this work presents here evidences of
this variation is limited to the CSP central portion.
Studies based on molecular marker analysis represent
an important tool for the phylogenetic characterization of
malaria parasites. Similarities between P. vivax-like and
Plasmodium simiovale have been reported in phylogenetic studies with conserved domains of the CS gene and,
some authors suggested that this variant genotype could
be a subspecies or a new species [6]. However, previous
phylogenetic studies were designed with the CS gene as

the only molecular marker in a way that prevents an
explanation on the evolutionary relationship among the
three CS genotypes as well as its relativity to other primate parasites that possess molecular similarities with P.
vivax [35]. In this study, the results were obtained
through the phylogenetic analysis of the 18 SSU rRNA
and Cyt B Plasmodium spp. recognized markers and surprisingly showed diversity equal to zero between both P.
vivax CS genotypes, VK210 and P. vivax-like. This analyses positioned VK210 and P. vivax-like as members of the

same clade, in accordance with previous data [35].
Although the absence of VK247 genetic sequences, a limitation of the present study, the results point to the fact
that P. vivax CS genotypes merely represent markers of
intra-specific genetic variations.
Supporting the above mentioned hypothesis, the evaluation of the serological response profile against the different parasite peptides corroborates the idea that this
variation is restricted to central portion of CSP, once significant associations were not observed between the
presence of certain genotype and frequency of the antibodies responses against the three analysed merozoite
peptides, MSP1 (Pv200L), AMA-1, DBP and against the
CSP conserved fractions in the sporozoite, N-terminal
and C-terminal. Besides, when the antibody responses
against the peptides corresponding to the CSP repetitive
central region were evaluated, significant associations
were detected against the peptides [R] and [V], which
corresponds to the protein sequences of VK210 and
VK247 genotypes, respectively. In individuals infected by
the VK210 genotype, a lower antibody response against
[V] was observed whereas in those infected by the P.

vivax-like genotype observed an even lower antibody
response against these two fragments ([R] and [V]) were
observed. Once VK210 represents the classic P. vivax CS
variant form and also the most prevalent in all Brazilian
endemic areas [17], these results were expected. Moreover, the repeated region of the P. vivax-like CS is the
most genetically distinct compared to the other variants
[5,6].
The report that variations in the central repetitive portion of CSP do not provide significant differences in antibody responses against P. vivax merozoite and sporozoite
conserved regions peptides represents key information in
the future design of vaccine assays. On the other hand,
studies based in CSP should consider the influences of
this variation in the modulation of the epidemiology and
to consider the use of chimerical constructs including the
sequences of the different CS genotypes in order to
obtain a vaccine indeed protecting.

Conclusion
These results target that the differences among the P.
vivax CS variants are restrict to the central repeated
