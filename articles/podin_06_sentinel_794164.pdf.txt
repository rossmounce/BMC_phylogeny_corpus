Abstract
Background: A major outbreak of human enterovirus 71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease
in Sarawak in 1997 marked the beginning of a series of outbreaks in the Asia Pacific region. Some
of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety
in the region.
Methods: We established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand, foot and mouth disease in
Sarawak, Malaysia, in March 1998, and the observations of the first 7 years are described here. Virus
isolation, serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat, rectal, vesicle and other swabs.
Results: During this period Sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71, in 2000 and
2003. The predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997, 2000 and 2003 were all from
genogroup B, but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each
other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and
Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. Although vesicles were most likely
to yield an isolate, this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat
swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information.
Conclusion: Knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow
public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an
effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease.

Background
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common
acute viral illness that primarily affects infants and young
children, and often occurs in clusters or outbreaks. It is
characterized by rapid onset of fever and sore throat,
accompanied by vesicles and ulcers on the gums, tongue,
buccal mucosa and palate. Punctate and usually transient
skin lesions appear on the palms, soles and occasionally
on the buttocks, knees or other areas. While the fever and
rash may subside rapidly, the mouth lesions may last
more than a week, and virus may continue to be shed for
several weeks [1]. In temperate countries HFMD occurs
during the summer but in the tropics HFMD can occur at
any time during the year.
The major causative agents of HFMD are coxsackievirus
A16 (CVA16), human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) and coxsackievirus A10 (CVA10) of the genus Enterovirus in the
family Picornaviridae [2]. Other enteroviruses isolated
from HFMD cases are the other species A human enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus A (CVA) 4, CVA5, CVA6 and
CVA7, and coxsackievirus B (CVB) 1, CVB2, CVB3 and
CVB5 [2-4]. Unlike other aetiological agents of HFMD
that normally cause mild disease, HEV71 infection has
been reported to cause neurological disease manifesting
as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or poliomyelitis-like
acute flaccid paralysis[5]. First isolated from a child suffering from encephalitis in California in 1969, HEV71 was
further isolated from 23 cases with severe neurological
disease in California during the next three years[3]. Historically, HEV71-associated outbreaks have been reported
in Australia in 1972[6], Japan in 1973 and 1978[7], Bulgaria in 1975[8] and Hungary in 1978[9].
In the past decade, countries in the Asia-Pacific region
have experienced an increased occurrence of HEV71-associated HFMD outbreaks[10]. HEV71 outbreaks have been
reported in Sarawak in 1997, Taiwan in 1998, Perth in
1999, then in Singapore, Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan in
2000 [11-17].
In an outbreak of HEV71 in 1997 in Sarawak, a state of
Malaysia on the island of Borneo, a cluster of unusual paediatric deaths due to encephalitis and cardiac failure was
observed[12,13]. This raised a lot of fear and anxiety and
because of the heightened concern about HEV71 in
Sarawak, we implemented a sentinel surveillance programme for HFMD beginning in March 1998. This programme was set up as part of the operational functions of
the Sarawak Health Department and was approved by the
Director of Health. The principles of the Helsinki Declaration were followed throughout the surveillance operation.
Our aims were to investigate the epidemiology of this
common childhood disease in Sarawak, and to determine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/180

if there were any differences in the patterns of transmission of HEV71, CVA16 and other aetiological agents of
HFMD. It was also the aim of this programme to provide
data of practical value for doctors and public health personnel with a view to efficient and effective virological
surveillance of HEV71, in particular, to provide an early
warning system for HEV71 outbreaks. This paper
describes the preliminary observations from our surveillance programme from March 1998 through June 2005.

Methods
Sentinel clinic programme
In early 1998 after discussion with a number of community paediatricians, our team set up a protocol for a sentinel surveillance programme for HFMD. The doctors who
had consented to actively participate were provided with
a standard reporting and specimen collection form, sterile
swabs and virus transport medium, a telephone number
for obtaining assistance for transport of specimens to the
laboratory and a facsimile number to report cases to the
Health Department. All sentinel clinic doctors obtained
parental consent before swabs were taken. Sentinel clinic
doctors were provided with feedback on viruses isolated
from their patients and contact was maintained through
both outbreak and inter-outbreak periods to assure doctors that the surveillance programme was active and ongoing. Data obtained in this manner were expected to
provide accurate information about disease trends and
molecular epidemiology of the relevant viruses.
Patients and specimens
Three specialist paediatric clinics located in the towns of
Kuching and Sibu in the state of Sarawak actively participated in this study from March 1998. In 2000 we included
a fourth specialist clinic in Sibu. Two government polyclinics in Kuching and Sibu also participated as sentinel
clinics. All children presenting to the sentinel clinics with
a history of oral or other skin lesions typical of HFMD
were enrolled into the surveillance study, and throat and
rectal swabs were obtained from each child enrolled in the
first 18 months. Where possible, swabs were also
obtained from mouth ulcers, vesicles and other skin
lesions. After a preliminary analysis of data from the first
18 months, the protocol was modified to require only
throat swabs from sentinel clinics. Rectal swabs were
optional and doctors were requested to provide vesicle
swabs whenever possible. Specimens were to be transported on ice to the laboratory in 2 ml of viral transport
medium (VTM) where they were vortexed, freeze-thawed
and aliquoted.
Virus isolation
Since the primary objective of programme was a sentinel
surveillance system for HEV71 HFMD, we inoculated
specimens into human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells

Page 2 of 10

BMC Public Health 2006, 6:180

susceptible to both CVA16 and HEV71. It was not a particular objective of this exercise to identify the minor causative agents known to be associated with HFMD and
hence we did not include multiple cell lines as part of our
virus isolation protocol. RD cell cultures normally
showed the characteristic enterovirus CPE in 2 to 10 days
and were harvested after the monolayer showed extensive
CPE. A blind passage was done with all cultures showing
no CPE after 10 to 14 days.
RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from all culture harvests using Tri Reagent LS (Molecular Research Centre, Cincinnati, OH,
USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
dry RNA pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of sterile ultra high
quality RNase-free water and stored at -80°C until use.
RT-PCR for identification of enterovirus
The presence of enterovirus RNA in culture fluids was
determined by a previously described pan-EV RT-PCR
method[18] with some modifications. The duration of all
the steps in the PCR was reduced to one minute and the
final extension was reduced to 5 minutes.
RT-PCR for specific identification of HEV71
From 1998 through 2002, specimens positive using the
pan-EV primers were tested for the presence of HEV71
genome by RT-PCR using the primers 159S and 162A,
which anneal to the VP1 gene of HEV71. Dr. Mark Pallansch (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta) generously
made the primer sequences available to us prior to publication[19]. All PCR products were sequenced to confirm
the identification. In 2002, we changed our protocol for
identification of HEV71 due to problems of misidentification of local strains of CVA16 as HEV71 using the primer
set 159S/162A[20]. Currently, HEV71 specific primers
designed in-house are used for specific identification of
HEV71[20]. All primers used are listed in Table 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/180

DNA sequencing of PCR products
Sequencing reactions were performed using the Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 3.0 or 3.1
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Serotype identification of non-HEV71 enteroviruses
isolated
Molecular serotyping of non-HEV71 enteroviruses isolated was carried out using the methods and sequences
published by Oberste and colleagues[21] and Chu, Ishiko
and colleagues[22,23]. Prior to 2002, serotyping of
selected non-HEV71 enteroviruses was performed exclusively according to Oberste's method. When Ishiko's
method[23] was published in 2002, we made a comparison of the methods by serotyping new isolates using both
methods. We determined that for human species A enteroviruses circulating in our region, Ishiko's primers gave
identical serotype identification to that obtained using
Oberste's method[21]. Since there was no discrepancy
between the methods, we modified Ishiko's primers to
convert the method from a semi-nested to a non-nested
method for ease of use. Our modifications were verified
and described by Cardosa and colleagues[24]. We then
retrospectively retested all non-HEV71 enteroviruses isolated prior to 2002 using the modified method.
Confirmation of HEV71 identification
A subset of isolates identified by sequencing of VP4 were
subjected to confirmation by using VP1 specific primers
and DNA sequencing of the PCR products, as described
previously[24].
Phylogenetic analysis
DNA sequences of VP1 and VP4 gene products generated
by RT-PCR from isolates were used in this analysis essentially as previously described[24]. The software package
ClustalX[25] was used for alignment and to generate a
bootstrapped phylogenetic tree using the neighbour joining method according to Saitou and Nei[26].Primers and

through our APNET (The Asia-Pacific Enterovirus Surveillance Network) website[28].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the software package JMP Statistics version 5.01(SAS Institute Inc., USA)
and Prism 4 for Macintosh (Graphpad Software, Inc.,
USA).

Results
The first 18 months
The first provisional protocol we provided to the sentinel
clinics for the collection of specimens required both
throat and rectal swabs and vesicle or ulcer swabs where
possible. Results from virus isolation studies of specimens
obtained from both sentinel clinics as well as hospitals
during this period were used to review the protocol that
was originally implemented. A total of 579 specimens
from 263 children with a clinical diagnosis of HFMD were
received during the 18-month period from March 1998
through August 1999. The age of the children ranged from
6 months to 13 years, with 153 (58.2%) males and 110
(41.8%) females.

All specimens received were subjected to virus isolation.
Fifty specimens from 44 children, of a total of 579 (8.6%)
specimens, were too heavily contaminated with bacteria.
Twenty four of the contaminated specimens were rectal
swabs, 19 were throat swabs and 7 were from various skin
lesions. All remaining uncontaminated cell culture harvests were tested for enteroviruses by using the pan-EV set
of primers and 235 of the 529 (44.4%) specimens tested
yielded an enterovirus, but only 15 of the 235 (6.4%)
enteroviruses were HEV71. These specimens were from
259 children and an enterovirus was isolated from 153
(59.1%) children. Only 6 (3.9%) of the children had
HEV71.
From this early set of specimens, we were able to isolate
an enterovirus from 44% of the throat swabs, 40% of the
rectal swabs, 44% of the mouth ulcers and 66% of the vesicle swabs. Clearly vesicle swabs are very useful specimens,
but only 18% of the children had had vesicle swabs taken
because not all children presented with skin lesions filled
with abundant fluid. Since throat swabs provided a reasonably high yield of enterovirus isolates, we made the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/180

decision in 2000, to require throat swabs as the primary
specimen from the sentinel clinics, with vesicle swabs
where possible, while rectal swabs were not required. This
served to reduce the laboratory workload during an outbreak.
Epidemiological curves – 7 years (1998–2005)
Our laboratory received 4290 specimens from 2950 children from March 1998 through June 2005, with a male to
female ratio of 1.35:1. The histogram in the top panel of
Figure 1 shows the distribution of HFMD cases seen in our
sentinel clinics during this period. There have clearly been
two large outbreaks of HFMD in 2000 and 2003 (bottom
panel of Figure 1), with some sporadic activity between
these peaks. The dominant enterovirus serotype isolated
during both the outbreaks was HEV71 as shown in the
middle panel of Figure 1. CVA16 was always isolated during HEV71 outbreaks as well but was also isolated in interoutbreak periods. Other species A human enteroviruses
such as CVA2, CVA4, CVA5, CVA10 and CVA12 were also
isolated in inter-outbreak periods.
Phylogenetic analysis of HEV71 strains isolated
Phylogenetic analysis of the HEV71 strains isolated in
Sarawak from 1998 to 2005 show that both genogroup B
and genogroup C strains circulated in Sarawak during this
period (see Figures 2 and 3). We have used both VP4 and
VP1 genes in the phylogenetic analysis in order to be certain that there is no major discrepancy in genotyping associated with using VP4 and VP1 gene regions. Furthermore,
we wish to provide both options to other groups who may
wish to compare their data with ours since it is known that
many groups may still use VP4 sequencing as a first step
in molecular identification of human enteroviruses.
Although both genogroup B and genogroup C HEV71
strains co-circulated in Sarawak, the predominant genogroup in both the HEV71 outbreaks of 2000 and 2003 was
genogroup B. Besides co-circulating with genogroup B
strains during outbreaks, genogroup C viruses also
appeared sporadically between outbreaks along with
other species A human enteroviruses. We never isolated a
genogroup B HEV71 in non-outbreak periods. The distribution of genogroup B and genogroup C HEV71 strains
during the surveillance period is shown in the bottom
panel of Figure 1.

The phylogenetic trees in Figures 2 and 3 also show that
the genogroup B viruses circulating in Sarawak during the
surveillance period were from 2 distinct clusters that were
also distinct from the genogroup B virus that caused the
large outbreak in Sarawak in 1997. These clusters have
been named subgenogroup B3 (1997 outbreak), B4 (2000
outbreak) and B5 (2003 outbreak). The genogroup C
viruses circulating in Sarawak were all from subgenogroup
C1.

Distribution
Distribution of HFMD cases reported by Sarawak sentinel clinics and enteroviruses isolated from March 1998
through June 2005. The top panel shows the distribution of cases of HFMD seen by our sentinel clinics. The middle panel
shows the distribution of different enteroviruses isolated from specimens submitted by our sentinel clinics. The bottom panel
shows the distribution of HEV71 isolates alone.

Genogroup shift observed in the outbreak of 2003
By 2003 we had already established and fine-tuned our
methods for rapid identification and genotyping of
HEV71 and all genotyping of virus isolates was performed

immediately after confirmation of HEV71. To our surprise
we observed a shift in genogroup from C to B in the early
phase of the outbreak. The first cases of HEV71 associated
HFMD presenting to our sentinel clinics were determined

to have HEV71 of genogroup C1. The number of HFMD
cases being admitted to hospitals also began to rise in
early February and continued to rise through the next
month (data not shown). We found that the number of
HEV71 isolates recovered from both patients admitted to
hospitals and patients presenting to our sentinel clinics
during this period followed this trend. HEV71 of genogroup B5 was isolated in small numbers in the first 6
weeks of the outbreak (epidemiological week 5 to 10) and
as the numbers of genogroup C1 viruses isolated began to
decline, the numbers of genogroup B5 viruses isolated
began to rise, showing a dominance of genogroup B5
viruses from epidemiological week 11 onwards. To illustrate this, we have taken a snapshot of data available at
epidemiological week 20 [see additional file 1] to show
the virological situation at that point in time. Thus, in

2003 there were in fact 2 clusters of HEV71 cases emerging. The main outbreak was associated with HEV71 genogroup B5, but this was preceeded by a smaller cluster of
cases infected with HEV71 genogroup C1.
Rapid rise in the number of HFMD cases during an HEV71
outbreak
The HFMD epidemiological curves for the outbreak years
2000 and 2003 were plotted according to epidemiological
week (Figure 4) and show clearly that the first HFMD
cases began to be seen early in the year. By week 7 a clear
rise in the number of cases was seen. This early rise in
cases differs from the summer outbreaks seen in temperate countries, and we suggest that the HEV71 outbreaks in
Sarawak preceed the summer outbreaks of countries in the
northern hemisphere in each year. In 2000 the HFMD
outbreak stretched to the end of the year, peaking between

weeks 11 to 13. The 2003 outbreak was cleaner, rising
around the same time as the 2000 outbreak, but peaked at
week 12 and declined sharply to very few cases by week
19. However, the epidemiological curves of HEV71 cases
were similar in both 2000 and 2003. The number of
HEV71 cases in 2000 dropped sharply by the end of June
(by week 27) being replaced largely by CVA16 until the
end of the year (see Figure 1). In 2003, the number of
HEV71 cases declined sharply by the end of April (by
week 18) and were no longer detected by the end of June,
coinciding with the last HFMD cases seen that year. Interestingly this outbreak coincided with the SARS outbreak
in the region and the public health measures put into
place during this time evidently served to control the
transmission of enteroviruses as well.
Community paediatric clinics – detailed study of cases
A detailed analysis was done on data collected from two
sentinel clinics, coded S1 and S2, which had sent samples
to our laboratory consistently and reliably throughout the
seven-year study period. A total of 2570 specimens were
collected from 1894 cases during the 7 years. Of the 1894
cases, specimens from 1804 (95%) were subjected to virus
isolation. A total of 2272 specimens were subjected to
virus isolation, thus ensuring that the majority of specimens from the majority of cases were tested (88.4% of
specimens from 95% of cases).
a. Virus isolation
An analysis of the proportion of the different types of
specimens and the virus yield obtained is shown in Table
2. More than 2000 specimens from outbreak and nonoutbreak periods were tested from 1998 to 2005. Enteroviruses were grown from 21.6% of those tested. Throat
swabs comprised 72.3% of the total number of specimens
tested and 25.4% of these yielded enteroviruses. Detailed

information about the enterovirus serotypes isolated during this surveillance programme is also provided [see
additional file 2]. Although on the whole, the virus isolation success rate was much lower than anticipated from
the results for the first 18 months, it remained the case
that throat swabs were more useful than the rectal swabs
which yielded non-polio enteroviruses in only 5.8% of
the samples tested. It should be noted however, that the
first 18 months of the study coincided with an inter
HEV71 epidemic period, with mostly CVA16 and nonHEV71 species A human enteroviruses causing HFMD. We
have compared the virus isolation yields during HEV71
outbreak (2000 and 2003) years with the yields during an
HFMD outbreak caused by non-HEV71 enteroviruses
(2002) and we found that we successfully isolated virus
from 40% of specimens collected in 2002 but only 20%
of viruses during the HEV71 outbreak years, suggesting
that HEV71 is more difficult to isolate than CVA16 and
other species A enteroviruses. The virus isolation rate in
the first 18 months (44%) is therefore comparable to that
obtained later, when HEV71 was not circulating.
b. Age distribution
There were 491 children from whom a non-polio enterovirus was isolated. Of these, 8 were excluded from the
analysis because of missing information on their age at
presentation. The children ranged in age from 18 days to
155 months, with a mean of 32.2 months and a median
of 27.5 months. There were 3 dominant serotypes of
enteroviruses isolated from these 483 children and we
asked the question if different serotypes of enteroviruses
caused infection in children of different ages. Table 3
shows the mean ages of the children who had CVA16,
HEV71 and CVA10 infection. Comparison of means for
each pair using an unpaired t test at an alpha of 0.05,
showed that there was no significant difference in the
mean ages of the children in the different groups (CVA10
versus CVA16: P = 0.0872; CVA10 versus HEV71: P =
0.1800; CVA16 versus HEV71: P = 0.6992).

Discussion
Following the 1997 outbreak of EV71 associated HFMD
in Sarawak, Malaysia, the Health Department installed a
sentinel surveillance programme with the expectation that
we would be able to study epidemiological trends and
begin to predict when to expect outbreaks with sufficient
accuracy in order to implement public health interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. Although the
surveillance programme is still ongoing in Sarawak, we
have sought to glean some preliminary information from
the data generated over the first 7 years of the programme.
During this time there have been 2 outbreaks of HEV71 in
Sarawak with smaller clusters of HFMD associated with
CVA16 and other species A human enteroviruses occurring concomitantly with as well as independently of the

two HEV71 outbreaks. A recent report on a similar surveillance programme in Yamagata Prefecture in Japan (1998–
2003) suggests that in Yamagata there is frequent importation of HEV71 from surrounding countries seeding the
clusters of cases seen annually in this community[10]. The
HEV71 strains in this study were isolated from small clusters of cases that tended to be seen in the summer months
while in our situation we observed outbreaks of HEV71
every 3 years with cases being seen much earlier in the
year, well before the northern summer. In 2003 both
Sarawak and Yamagata experienced a large outbreak and
in both situations, a genogroup shift from C to B was
noted.
It is interesting that in Sarawak, of the genogroup C
viruses, only genogroup C1 strains have been observed,
while genogroup B viruses appear to be changing from
outbreak to outbreak, suggesting that it is likely that genogroup B viruses are evolving within Borneo and that the
outbreaks we have experienced are being seeded from
within rather than from imported viruses. Since the outbreaks in Sarawak typically begin early in the year, it is
also possible that genogroup B strains generated in
Sarawak may seed HEV71 outbreaks in the region, which
typically occur later than the Sarawak outbreaks. This temporal sequence of regional outbreaks is also true of those
occurring in Singapore and in Peninsula Malaysia.
The data we have obtained through 7 years of our sentinel
surveillance programme for HFMD in Sarawak have provided useful clues to understanding the epidemiology of
HEV71 in the state. It is clear that the appearance of
HEV71 associated HFMD in sentinel clinics signals the
start of an outbreak, but the rise in the number of cases is
so rapid that this approach is not a suitable early warning

system. In 2003 there were only 5 weeks between the time
the first HEV71 cases were seen and the peak of the outbreak. Clearly this could be explained by rapid and effective response by the public health teams, but we have no
way to know.
Alternatively, the 3-year cycle of HEV71 outbreaks we
have observed could, if verified in the coming years, provide public health officials with the relevant information
to plan and to implement their intervention programmes
to reduce the disease burden in the years when an HEV71
outbreak is expected. Although this is not expected to prevent the outbreaks entirely, effective public health measures put into place early enough can limit the spread,
reduce mortality and reduce the burden on the community and the health system.
It is important to note that epidemiological curves showing HFMD alone, without distinguishing the infecting
agent for each case, can stretch broadly over many
months, with non-HEV71 enteroviruses continuing to be
isolated after cessation of HEV71 activity. This was especially evident in 2000, when HEV71 associated fatal cases
were reported in neighbouring Singapore in September
and October 2000[29], and the media attention surrounding these events generated a high index of suspicion
in Sarawak as well. No HEV71 was isolated in Sarawak
after August that year, but numerous CVA16 continued to
be isolated until the end of 2000. Thus even though sociological factors affect the shape of the HFMD epidemiological curves in Sarawak, epidemiological curves
specifically showing genogroup B strains of HEV71 were
consistently sharp and well defined in 2000 and 2003.

The mean and median age of children with HFMD was 36
months and 30 months respectively, but the mean ages
did not differ between the groups infected with the different serotypes. It is thus intriguing that HEV71 has caused
much larger and sharper outbreaks than either CVA16 or
CVA10. This suggests that HEV71 has the capacity to
spread rapidly through the susceptible population and
then become quiescent in the community. In the third
year after any HEV71 outbreak, the whole cohort of children under 3 years of age has not been exposed to HEV71
and all of these children are then susceptible, providing
the conditions for another sweeping transmission of
HEV71 through the community. The annual birth cohort
in Sarawak is 48 to 49 thousand and thus in 3 years there
are up to 150,000 susceptible children in the state.

Authors' contributions
All the virology and molecular biology was conducted by
the team from Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. Members of
the Sarawak Health Department provided logistic support
in the collection of specimens and data from the community, and also in the communication of trends and public
health measures to the primary care doctors. The surveillance system was conceived of by MTA, planned and executed by MJC, FO and AK. BT and TYW were key players
in the primary healthcare setting. All authors have read
and approved this manuscript.

According to the trends we have reported, we expect that
the next outbreak of HEV71 in Sarawak will be in 2006. At
the time of writing we have already begun to pick up
HEV71 cases in our sentinel programme and from past
experience, an outbreak in Sarawak is often followed by
outbreaks in other countries in the region. We have therefore decided to put our data into the public domain in
order that other public health practitioners in the Asia
Pacific region may benefit from this experience and prepare for a spread of HEV71 in the region once again in the
months to come.

Conclusion
The main conclusions arising out of this preliminary
report are described below:
a. HEV71 outbreaks have occurred every 3 years in
Sarawak starting in 1997. All the 3 outbreaks (1997, 2000
and 2003) have been caused by genogroup B viruses and
furthermore, each of the 3 outbreaks has been associated
with genogroup B viruses that are genetically distinct from
each other.
b. HEV71 of subgenogroup C1 has been isolated throughout the 7 years of the surveillance programme and are
closely related to each other and to genogroup C1 viruses
isolated elsewhere. Sarawak has so far not experienced
large HFMD outbreaks caused by HEV71 of genogroup
C1. Indeed HEV71 of subgenogroup C1 behave much like
other species A enteroviruses, occurring sporadically
throughout the surveillance period.
c. In Sarawak, occurrence of HEV71 genogroup B infections is tightly clustered, with cases rising and falling very
rapidly.
