Dioecious Silene latifolia plants show sexual
dimorphism in the vegetative stage
Jitka Zluvova*, Jiri Zak, Bohuslav Janousek, Boris Vyskot

Abstract
Background: Prior to this study, no differences in gene expression between male and female dioecious plants in
the vegetative state had been detected. Among dioecious plants displaying sexual dimorphism, Silene latifolia is
one of the most studied species. Although many sexually dimorphic traits have been described in S. latifolia, all of
them are quantitative, and they usually become apparent only after the initiation of flowering.
Results: We present RT-PCR-based evidence that in S. latifolia, sexual dimorphism in gene expression is present
long before the initiation of flowering. We describe three ESTs that show sex-specific (two male specific and one
female specific) transcription at the rosette stage before the first flowering season.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study provides the first molecular evidence of early pre-flowering sexual
dimorphism in angiosperms.

Background
Sexual dimorphism (the systematic difference in form or
other trait(s) not present in sexual organs between individuals of different sex in the same species) is a widely
studied phenomenon in animal models [1] and in
humans [2]. Much less is known about sexual dimorphism in vascular dioecious plants (reviewed in [3]).
Among vascular plants displaying sexual dimorphism,
Silene latifolia is (together with Fragaria virginiana [4]) the most studied species. The first study on sexually
dimorphic traits in S. latifolia was performed already in
the 19th century [5], and since that time many sexually
dimorphic traits have been described (e. g., [6-9]). However, the only known genes involved in sexual dimorphism are those involved in the control of flower
development. During flower development, sexual
dimorphism starts to occur very early. At the morphological level, the central zone of the floral meristem is significantly smaller in males than in females [10]. This is
caused by cell division arrest in male tissues [11]. The
difference between male and female flower bud morphology is preceded by differences at the gene expression level. Developmental pathways involved in the

switch of male or female flower program have been also
identified [12,13].
The differential expression of some genes probably
results from different modes of selection operating in
males and females: males are limited in their reproductive success by access to mates, whereas females are
more limited by resources [14]. In animals, the evolution
of the sexual dimorphism is primarily driven by competition between males and selection for traits recognized
by females as marks of male fitness (reviewed in [15]).
Similar principles are probably also at work in animal
pollinated plants. In S. latifolia, odor-compounds
involved in pollinator attraction differ significantly
between sexes, suggesting that selection for higher
attractiveness among competing males is mediated by
the sensory ecology of the pollinator [16]. In addition,
males produce on average up to 16 times more flowers
than pollinated females [17]. This difference in flower
number is probably driven by a combination of male
competition, and, at least partly, by a higher consumption of resources by developing seeds in pollinated
female flowers, which probably results in a trade off
between seed size and flower number. The difference
in flower number is, indeed, less pronounced in nonpollinated females, which produce on average 4 times
fewer flowers than males [17,18]. Yet, selection for
increased flower number in males is hypothesized to be

the primary mechanism for the further evolution of sexual dimorphism in other traits [8]. It also seems reasonable to expect that differences in the vegetative parts of
plants evolved in concert with different flowers types or
architecture of inflorescences carried by the plant [3].
Dawson and Geber [3] pointed out that many sexually
dimorphic traits could evolve as a consequence of their
correlation with other sexually dimorphic traits and so
they need not be of adaptive value. Correlations between
flower size and the size of the stem leaves have been
reported by several independent studies (reviewed by
[3]). Steven et al. [18] suggested that variation in sexlimited genes with pleiotropic effects and/or linkage
between sex limited loci occurs in S. latifolia. They statistically predicted that selection for increased flower
numbers in males along with weak selection for
increased flower size in females could lead to dimorphic
evolution in several other traits including leaf mass [18].
Almost all of the sexually dimorphic traits in S. latifolia described so far become apparent only after the
initiation of flowering. Notable exceptions to this pattern include: sex-dimorphism in the long-term survival
of buried seeds and burial induced dormancy in S. latifolia [19], sex-dimorphism in emergence time [20] and
in the time to flowering [20,21]. We present the first
molecular evidence that sexually dimorphic gene expression is present in S. latifolia even at the rosette stage, a
long time before the initiation of flowering, and describe
three ESTs with sex-specific gene expression.

Results and discussion
We re-tested the expression patterns of 22 available
S. latifolia ESTs previously described according to
Northern blots or Virtual Northerns [22-24] as preferentially expressed in male flowers and/or early stamen (for
the list of the ESTs chosen for this study, see Additional
file 1: Supplementary table S1). Fewer genes than previously claimed have expression limited to male flower
buds suggesting the importance of RT-PCR analyses in
this case. Only six out of 15 genes previously described
as male flower bud specific were expressed in male
flower buds only and not in the leaves or in female
flower buds (Figure 1A). Two genes, originally described
as male flower bud specific, were expressed in male
flower buds earlier than in female flower buds (Figure
1B). Twelve genes were expressed in all samples tested
(Figure 1C). For the comparison of the previously published data and our results see Additional file 2: Supplementary table S2. We also found one EST (Men-470)
expressed exclusively in male flower buds and leaves
and one EST (CCLS79.1) expressed exclusively in female
flower buds and leaves (Figure 1D). We also serendipitously found one new 550 bp long EST as a “by-product” of PCR amplification of Men-262 (Figure 1D) and

Figure 1 RT-PCR analyses of all the studied ESTs. Expression was
investigated by RT-PCR analysis on the tissues indicated above each
lane. The ESTs amplified are indicated on the right. Male buds of
two mm length represent the stage when meiosis starts in anthers.
Female meiosis starts in eight mm long female buds. Further details
concerning the flower development in S. latifolia are summarized in
Additional file 6: Supplementary table S4 (according to Farbos et al.
[47]). (A) ESTs expressed exclusively in male flower buds. (B) ESTs
starting to be expressed in male flower buds earlier than in female
flower buds. (C) ESTs expressed in leaves and flower buds of both
sexes. (D) ESTs showing sex specific expression in all the studied
tissues. Two of them (Serendip2, and Men-470) are showing male
specific expression while CCLS79.1 gene shows female specific
expression. Men-262 is included to illustrate that Serendip2 is
amplified with the same pair of primers and it serves also as a proof
of the sufficient quality of templates.

named it Serendip2 [GenBank: GU120088]. Serendip2
was expressed exclusively in male flower buds and
leaves.
To elucidate the discrepancy between the expression
patterns found here and those presented in previous
research [22-24], we performed a homology search of
the studied ESTs followed by a search for putative
orthologous sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana (for the
results, see Additional file 1: Supplementary table S1
and Additional file 3: Supplementary figures S1-11) and
their expression patterns according to Genevestigator
V3 [25,26] (for the results, see Additional file 1: Supplementary table S1; Genevestigator workspace file is
included as Additional file 4). We found that the gene
expression patterns described in A. thaliana were not in
a contradiction to our results (cf. Additional file 1: Supplementary table S1 and the Figure 1).
In this article, we present sex-specific expression patterns of Men-470, Serendip2 and CCLS79.1; they are
expressed in a sex-specific manner not only in flower
buds, but also in the leaves of plants in the vegetative
stage of development. At this stage, no expression of
genes involved in the flower formation is present in A.
thaliana (reviewed in [27]). Men-470 has already been
studied using RT-PCR by other authors [24], who
reported expression both in male and female flowers
and in leaves (sex not specified). Using our primers, we
observed transcription in males in all tissues studied,
but no transcription in females. This result suggests that
the expression of the copy amplified by our primer pair
is already sex specific in the rosette stage. We can
exclude the alternative possibility that our primers
amplified only the Y-linked copy of Men-470 by amplifying the sequence from females (XX). Serendip2 is a
new EST that was found in this study. Serendip2 has an
open reading frame along the whole sequence, but it has
no homology to any known gene either at the DNA or
protein level. The most interesting case is probably the
CCLS79.1 gene. This sequence was amplified from genomic DNA samples of both females and males, suggesting
that the difference in expression is not caused by sex
linkage. The results we obtained in CCLS79.1 differ
from the results obtained previously in Northern blots
[22] that showed expression both in male and female
flower buds and no expression in male leaves. The different results of our study can be explained by the fact
that RT-PCR can selectively amplify one of several
copies present in the genome.
Our results clearly show that male and female S. latifolia plants differ in the expression of at least three
genes long before the initiation of flowering; this situation is analogous to the pregonadal stage in mammals
[28]. Growth differences and sex specific expression are
present in mammalian embryos in the preimplantation

Page 3 of 5

stage, long before the formation of sex organs. Similarly,
sex-dimorphic gene expression has been found in gastrulating chicken embryos [29]. The main difference
between plant and animal bodies is that plants do not
possess a true germline and sexual organs develop relatively late in plant life. Given this pattern, our discovery
of sexual dimorphism at the rosette stage is surprising.
Indeed, contrary to animals, sexual dimorphism in
plants at the vegetative stage before inflorescence initiation seems to be extremely rare. In classical dioecious
model species, the earliest differences between male and
female individuals are apparent in the inflorescence
shape (in hop (Humulus) or hemp (Cannabis)). Spatial
sex segregation, which is caused by differential seed germination and seedling survival (reviewed by [30]), is an
indirect indication of the existence of sexual dimorphism in the vegetative stage of plants [31]. Additionally,
the salt grass Distichlis spicata, a species characterized
by spatial segregation of sexes, shows sex specific differences in susceptibility to colonization by a mycorrhizal
fungus [30]. In this species, the sex specific differences
even result in a strong inter-sexual competition [32]. As
already listed in introduction, there are only a few indirect indications of the sexually dimorphic sex expression
in the early vegetative state in S. latifolia that were
obtained by previous studies [19-21]. The differences in
expression patterns of three ESTs found in this study
are the first qualitative differences between the sexes in
the vegetative stage in S. latifolia. They are also the first
described sequences in plants connected with the sexual
dimorphism in the vegetative stage.
The existence of the sex specifically expressed genes
in S. latifolia in the rosette stage suggests that there
may be some, as yet undetected, physiological differences between sexes. We speculate that such hidden
sexual dimorphism may be present in many dioecious
species, and this study should inspire other scientists to
test other dioecious species for sexual dimorphism in
early vegetative stages. The existence of sexually
dimorphic patterns means that the S. latifolia plants
“know” their sex a long time before flowering, and this
situation probably enables the plants to prepare for
flowering in a sex specific manner.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this study provides the first molecular evidence of early pre-flowering sexual dimorphism in
angiosperms.
Methods
Orthology identification and search for the expression
patterns in A. thaliana

Orthology data were obtained from OrthoMCL [33].
Files containing protein sequence data and orthology

group information were downloaded from OrthoMCL
version 4, currently containing genes from nine green
plant genomes. The OrthoMCL clustering method provides a convenient, but necessarily imperfect means of
estimating orthology and paralogy ([34], [35]). The highest BLAST hits can, in some cases, occur due to domain
homologies, rather than homology to orthologs [36]. We
performed phylogenetic analysis to avoid this misleading
orthologue identification. Sequences for phylogenetic
tree construction were obtained via a BLASTX homology search of the database of non-redundant protein
sequences at NCBI (nr). All ESTs showing significant
homology to known sequences were subjected to phylogenetic tree construction to further confirm their orthologues in other plant species. For the phylogenetic
analysis, translated sequences were aligned using
ClustalW version 1.83 [37], and the alignment was
manually corrected using Seaview [38]. Ambiguously
aligned parts of the sequences were excluded using
Gblocks [39]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by
the maximum likelihood algorithm using PhyML version
3.0.1 [40] using the LG + Γ4 + I model [41] and they
were visualized using Dendroscope [42]. Branches were
tested for reliability by approximate likelihood-ratio test
[43]. Phylogenetic trees were rooted using an appropriate outgroup. Putative orthologues in A. thaliana were
detected at all A. thaliana genes that grouped with a
respective Silene latifolia EST with a high degree of
confidence. The cut-off to detect orthology was set to
0.7. The expression patterns of the A. thaliana orthologues were searched using Genevestigator V3 [25,26].
Extraction of nucleic acids and RT-PCR

S. latifolia plants were grown as described by Markova
et al. [44]. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously [45]. The sex of the plants was estimated at the
rosette stage based on the length polymorphism
between X and Y copy of the gene SlssX/Y (using the
primers c2B12+1 and c2B12-2)[46]. RNA from a bulk
sample of six male or female plants was isolated from
rosette leaves (before the first flowering season; at the
eight leaves stage) and flower buds of four different
sizes (smaller than 1 mm, between 1 and 2 mm,
between 2 and 3 mm and bigger than three mm). For
RNA isolation and reverse transcription, we used the
same procedures as described previously [12]. To verify
the results, RT-PCR was also performed on a single
male and a single female with the same results as the
bulk analysis. A list of all PCR primers and conditions
used in this study is provided in Additional file 5: Supplementary Table S3. PCR products were analyzed on
agarose gels and visualized under UV light in the presence of ethidium bromide. Expression was classified in
a qualitative manner as present or absent.
