Planctomycetes dominate biofilms on surfaces of
the kelp Laminaria hyperborea
Mia M Bengtsson*, Lise Øvreås

Abstract
Background: Bacteria belonging to Planctomycetes display several unique morphological and genetic features and
are found in a wide variety of habitats on earth. Their ecological roles in these habitats are still poorly understood.
Planctomycetes have previously been detected throughout the year on surfaces of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea
from southwestern Norway. We aimed to make a detailed investigation of the abundance and phylogenetic
diversity of planctomycetes inhabiting these kelp surfaces.
Results: Planctomycetes accounted for 51-53% of the bacterial biofilm cells in July and September and 24% in
February according to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. Several separate planctomycetes lineages
within Pirellulae, Planctomyces and OM190 were represented in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and the most
abundant clones belonged to yet uncultured lineages. In contrast to the abundance, the diversity of the
planctomycete populations increased from July to February and was probably influenced by the aging of the kelp
tissue. One planctomycete strain that was closely related to Rhodopirellula baltica was isolated using selective
cultivation techniques.
Conclusions: Biofilms on surfaces of L. hyperborea display an even higher proportion of planctomycetes compared
to other investigated planctomycete-rich habitats such as open water, sandy sediments and peat bogs. The
findings agree well with the hypothesis of the role of planctomycetes as degraders of sulfated polymeric carbon in
the marine environment as kelps produce such substances. In addition, the abundant planctomycete populations
on kelp surfaces and in association with other eukaryotes suggest that coexistence with eukaryotes may be a key
feature of many planctomycete lifestyles.

Background
Bacteria belonging to the phylum Planctomycetes have
revealed several remarkable features that set them apart
from other bacteria. Their cryptic morphology led early
microbiologists to mistake them for fungi, and the discovery of their cell compartmentalization, featuring
membrane bounded organelles, raised fundamental
questions about the evolution of eukaryotes [1,2].
Further, the unique anammox metabolism found in
some planctomycetes has revolutionized the view of
microbial nitrogen cycling [3]. The planctomycetes also
possess cell walls without peptidoglycan, a characteristic
that they share only with the obligate intracellular bacteria within Chlamydiae. In addition to the interest
sparked by these unusual and fascinating features,

planctomycetes have in later years attracted considerable
attention because of their presence in a wide variety of
environments on earth. By investigating bacterial communities using molecular methods (sequences coding
for 16S rRNA), planctomycetes have been repeatedly
detected in soil, sediments, marine and freshwater systems and in terrestrial hot springs to mention just a few
(for a detailed review see [4]). However, their metabolic
potential and function in these ecosystems is often
unclear, as 16S rRNA gene sequence investigations only
rarely give clues to ecological roles.
In the marine environment, DeLong and co-workers
[5] found that planctomycetes were more abundant in
clone libraries from marine aggregate (marine snow)
attached bacteria than from free-living bacteria. Since
then, results from several studies suggest that planctomycetes favor a biofilm lifestyle, adhering to surfaces in
aquatic environments including marine sediments [6]

(among others), diatom cells [7], seaweeds and other
aquatic macrophytes [8,9]. Rhodopirellula baltica is an
extensively studied marine particle-attached planctomycete. Its genome sequence reveals a large number of
genes involved in the breakdown of sulfated polysaccharides [10], a carbon source found in marine photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae and seaweeds,
who’s detrital material is thought to generate marine
snow. Such genes are also encountered in other planctomycete genomes and planctomycete-derived metagenomic fosmid libraries from seawater collected in
upwelling zones [11]. The overrepresentation of such
genes, and the association of R. baltica and other planctomycetes with marine snow has led to the hypothesis
that heterotrophic planctomycetes are specialized degraders of sulfated polymeric carbon, for example in marine
snow [10,11]. Given the significance of marine snow as
part of the so-called “biological pump” of carbon in the
oceans [12,13], planctomycetes may thereby be playing a
crucial role in global carbon turnover [11]. Still, quantitative data on the distribution of planctomycetes in the
marine environment and elsewhere is still scarce, and
very little is known about the yet uncultured planctomycete lineages that are assumed to carry out the bulk of
these globally critical processes.
Kelps are large brown seaweeds of the order Laminariales. They often form dense stands along rocky coastlines that are referred to as kelp forests. Kelp forest
ecosystems are some of the most productive ecosystems
in the world [14]. Their immense importance for coastal
biodiversity, productivity and human economy has long
been recognized in temperate regions of the world and
is only beginning to be understood in the tropics [15].
Kelp forests along the Atlantic coasts of Europe are
dominated by the large kelp Laminaria hyperborea.
Bacteria associated to kelp are believed to be important
in the carbon and nitrogen turnover in kelp forest food
webs [16,17], but it is still not known what types of
bacteria are involved in these processes. Recently, the
seasonal dynamics of the cell density and bacterial community composition in biofilms on L. hyperborea were
addressed. In this study, planctomycetes were frequently
detected throughout the year but their abundance and
phylogenetic relationships were not considered [18]. In
order to address the importance of this group of bacteria in kelp forests, we therefore aimed to take an indepth look at the abundance and phylogenetic diversity
of planctomycete communities inhabiting L. hyperborea
surface biofilms. This was achieved by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to quantify their
abundance and visualize their distribution in the biofilm
as well as 16S rRNA gene clone library construction to
elucidate their phylogenetic relationships, community

composition and diversity at different times of the year.
In addition, a selective cultivation approach was used to
assess the culturability of planctomycetes from kelp
surfaces.

Results
Abundance of planctomycetes in kelp surface biofilms

Quantification of planctomycetes in samples from July
2007, February 2007 and September 2008 using FISH
showed that they make up a large part of the kelp surface biofilm community in all three sampling occasions.
In July and September they dominated the community,
with cells hybridizing with the Planctomycetes-specific
probe Pla46 [19] accounting for over 50% of the total
DAPI stained cells on average (Table 1 and Figure 1).
In February, the planctomycetes were less abundant;
with Pla46 hybridized cells corresponding to an average
of 24% of total DAPI stained cells. Samples that were
also subjected to hybridization with the Pir1223 [20]
probe showed similar percentages (±1%) of hybridized
cells as the with Pla46 probe (results not shown).
Inspection of the cloned 16S rRNA gene sequences
revealed that the Pir1223 target sequence was present
in all clones except those belonging to the OM190 lineage (see the following sections) suggesting that the specificity of this probe needs to be reevaluated. The
different formamide concentrations (20-40%) used in
hybridization with the Pla46 probe did not change the
proportion of Pla46 hybridized cells significantly (results
not shown). The average proportion of the DAPI
stained cells that hybridized with the Eub338 probes
was 79% in July, 74% in September and 52% in February
(Table 1 and Figure 1).
Cell distribution of planctomycetes in the biofilms

Fluorescence microscopy images of DAPI and FISH
stained biofilm cells revealed a complex and variable
microscopic landscape. The microbial cells appeared to
be unevenly distributed on the kelp surface, often occurring in clusters (Figure 2a, c and 2g) or growing along
straight lines (Figure 2c). Planctomycetes cells were
found within all these structures, and appeared to grow
evenly intermingled with other cells (Figure 2b, d and
2f). Fluorescence microscope images showed DAPI and
FISH signals corresponding to different cell morphologies in the biofilm, ranging from long filaments, cocci of
different sizes and small rods (Figure 2). The planctomycete FISH signals were always in the shape of small and
medium sized cocci (Figure 2b, d and 2f) and displayed
the “ring” shape typical of planctomycete cell organization [19] (Figure 2b inset). The Eub338 FISH signals
included the whole range of morphologies (Figure 2h)
and were both ring-shaped and solid.

Phylogenetic diversity of planctomycetes from kelp
surface biofilms

Three clone libraries, from February 2007, July 2007 and
September 2008, constructed with the Planctomycetesspecific primer Pla46f and the general bacterial primer
1542r were analyzed to gain insight into the phylogenetic diversity of the planctomycetes growing in kelp

One strain, named “P1”, belonging to Planctomycetes
was isolated from kelp surface biofilm material from
September 2008. It displayed morphological features
typical for Rhodopirellula baltica, with ovoid cells and
rosette formation (Figure 3). It formed pink colonies on
M30 solid media that were visible after approximately
seven days of incubation in room temperature after
inoculation. It was closely related to the type strain of
Rhodopirellula baltica (Figure 4, 99.5% 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity) and to Rhodopirellula strain K833

isolated from seawater in Iceland [21] (Figure 4, 99.9%
sequence similarity). However, it was not closely related
to any of the clone library sequences from kelp surface
biofilms (Figure 4).

surface biofilms. In total, 266 clones were sequenced in
the forward direction from the three clone libraries,
resulting in partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of
approximately 850 basepairs. Of these, only 9 sequences
(3.4%) did not classify as belonging to Planctomycetes
and were discarded from the further analyses. These
unspecific sequences classified as Deltaproteobacteria
(three), Gammaproteobacteria (two), Actinobacteria
(two) and Verrucomicrobia (one) while one remained
unclassified using the Greengenes G2Chip classifier [22].
The remaining 257 partial planctomycete 16S rRNA
gene sequences clustered into 23 OTUs at 98% sequence
similarity. Other OTU definitions (95-99%) gave different numbers of OTUs, but the general trends observed
in the dataset were the same. One to six representative
clones of each OTU were selected for sequencing in the
reverse direction in order to assemble near full-length
16S rRNA gene sequences. Of the assembled sequences,
three were removed from the analyses because of poor
sequence quality and two because of indications of chimeric origin. The remaining 46 near full-length planctomycete 16S rRNA gene sequences have been deposited
to GenBank under the accession numbers HM369064 to
HM369109, and the sequence of the P1 isolate under
HM369063.
The clone libraries from February, July and September
showed considerable overlap in OTU composition (Figure 5). The July library had the lowest OTU richness
and consisted of a subset of the OTUs detected in the
other two libraries. The highest OTU richness and the
most unique OTUs (seven) were found in February.
September was intermediate in OTU richness and the
number of unique OTUs (Figs. 5 and 6). The diversity
of the three clone libraries is illustrated in Figure 6
using rarefaction curves showing the expected number

Page 5 of 12

of OTUs encountered with clone sampling effort. July
displays a near asymptotic curve, indicating low diversity, while September is intermediate and February displays the highest diversity. The Shannon diversity index
and the Chao1 richness estimates for the clone libraries
(Table 1) show the same relative diversity pattern.
The phylogenetic analysis of the near full-length
sequences obtained in this study and other planctomycete sequences obtained from the Silva reference database [23] revealed that highly divergent lineages of the
Planctomycetes phylum are represented in kelp surface
biofilms (Figure 4). The kelp surface biofilm clone
sequences appear to cluster within five major lineages
that have been labeled as: “RB1” and “RB2” (defined in
this study), Rhodopirellula, Planctomyces and “OM190”.
The “RB1” and “RB2” lineages appear more closely
related to the Rhodopirellula and Blastopirellula genera
than to the Pirellula genus and were given their labels
based on that (RB = Rhodopirellula/Blastopirellula). Yet
the phylogenetic analyses do not place them consistently
with either of the genera. Sequence similarities of
86-90% to Rhodopirellula baltica and Blastopirellula
marina indicate that they probably represent distinct
phylogenetic lineages that could correspond to new
genera according to conventional taxonomical practice.
The “RB1” lineage was by far the most represented in
all three clone libraries (Figure 4). Sequences that cluster within the “RB2”, Rhodopirellula and Planctomyces
lineages were only represented in September and February, indicating a seasonal difference, while OM190
representatives were present at low numbers in all three
clone libraries (Figure 4).

Discussion
To our knowledge, the kelp surface biofilms investigated
in this study display the highest proportion of bacteria
belonging to Planctomycetes reported in a natural bacterial community so far. This observation is consistent
with earlier results from a DGGE based study on seasonal variation of Laminaria hyperborea (kelp) surface
biofilm communities [18]. Other habitats where a high
abundance of planctomycetes has been reported include
seawater during a diatom bloom where planctomycetes
related to Pirellula were detected attached to diatom
cells and were among the dominant lineages in the
bloom samples [7]. In investigations of sandy sediments
containing algal cells [24,25], planctomycetes were also
abundant, accounting for up to 20% of total cells,
accompanied by Cytophaga/Flavobacteria. Gade and coworkers [20] used order-, genus- and strain specific
FISH probes to detect planctomycetes in a range of
aquatic habitats and recorded abundances up to 11% of
total cells in some lakes. Peat bogs with Sphagnum
moss have also been reported to harbor abundant (up to

13% of total bacterial numbers) planctomycete populations [26]. Similarly to kelp surfaces, these environments
are all highly influenced by photosynthetic eukaryotes.
The studies mentioned above have all quantified
planctomycetes using specific FISH probes. Several
other studies have detected planctomycetes using PCR
based cloning and fingerprinting methods followed by
sequencing. Two of the most frequently used general
bacterial PCR primers, targeting the 16S rRNA gene
around E. coli positions 8-27 and 338-355, contain mismatches against planctomycete sequences [27,28]. This
may have caused planctomycete abundances to be
underestimated in many habitats, leading investigators
to turn their attention towards bacterial groups that
appear more abundant. Despite awareness of this problem, the literature and the sequence databases probably
reflect a tradition of neglect towards the planctomycetes.
In the light of this, it is difficult to say whether the
dominance of planctomycetes on Laminaria hyperborea
surface biofilms represents a unique feature of this

habitat, or if other planctomycete-dominated bacterial
communities have been overlooked until now. For
example, Staufenberger and co-workers [29] did not
detect planctomycetes in surface biofilms of another
species of kelp (Saccharina latissima) using general bacterial primers for cloning and DGGE analysis. Yet, use
of different primers has let to the detection of planctomycetes on both the kelps S. latissima and Laminaria
digitata (Bengtsson, unpublished results).
A possible explanation for the suitability of kelp as a
habitat for planctomycetes is its content of sulfated
polysaccharides, a class of molecules that some marine
planctomycetes are known for being able to degrade
[10]. For example, Laminaria hyperborea contains fucoidan, a class of complex brown algal sulfated polysaccharides. These substances are secreted to the surface of
L. hyperborea via mucilage channels [30]. It is reasonable to assume that planctomycetes living on kelp surfaces utilize substances produced by the kelp, for
example fucoidan, as carbon sources. However, the presence of suitable carbon sources appears insufficient to
explain the observed dominance of planctomycetes, as
they must not only be able to grow and divide, but also
outcompete other bacteria to be successful. Another
contributing factor to the success of planctomycetes on
kelp surfaces may be resistance to chemical antimicrobial defense compounds produced by the kelp. Antibacterial activity has been detected in extracts from many
species of kelp, yet the substances responsible for the
activity have often not been identified [31]. The lack of
peptidoglycan in planctomycete cell walls makes them
resistant to conventional cell wall targeting antibiotics
like ampicillin. Resistance to other antibiotics, targeting
for example protein synthesis (streptomycin) has also
been reported in some marine planctomycetes [32,33].
In many cases the reference sequences that are the
most closely related to kelp surface planctomycetes are
obtained from other marine eukaryotes such as for
example red and green seaweeds, corals, crustaceans
and sponges (Figure 4). The frequent association of
planctomycetes to eukaryotes has previously been noted
[34]. This could point to a general lifestyle pattern of
heterotrophic planctomycetes. They may combine an
affinity for sulfated polysaccharides and other polymeric
carbon molecules [10,11] produced by their eukaryote
hosts with a resistance to eukaryote chemical defense
molecules. The resulting competitive advantage over
other bacterial groups that are utilizing the same kind of
substrates, for example the Bacteroidetes [35] might be
one of the keys to the success of planctomycetes in a
wide variety of environments on earth.
Our results show differences between the different
sampling times (February, July and September), in planctomycete abundance, OTU composition and diversity.

Page 8 of 12

For example, in February there is a relatively low abundance of planctomycetes (Figure 1) compared to July and
September. This may be linked to the age of the kelp
tissue, as the kelp lamina is older in February compared
to in July and September due to the seasonal growth
cycle of the kelp. Aging of the kelp tissue could be associated with lowered antibacterial chemical defense by the
kelp, as the old kelp lamina is to be shed soon after
February, and does therefore not need to be defended
against microbial colonization. Without the presence of
chemical defense substances, the planctomycetes could
loose their competitive advantage over other bacterial
groups, explaining their lower abundance in February.
The senescence of the kelp tissue as it ages could also
cause the appearance of new niches involved in degradation of different kelp constituents, thereby enabling the
more diverse planctomycete communities that are
observed in February compared to July and September
(Table 1, Figure 6).
Among the different planctomycete lineages that
are represented on the kelp, the lineage defined as “RB1”
in this study appears to be the most abundant, accounting for a majority of the clones at all sampling times
(Figure 4). The high abundance of RB1 planctomycetes
may thus be the cause of the observed dominance of
planctomycetes on kelp surfaces (Figs. 1 and 2). Their
high abundance implies a lifestyle that makes them particularly successful on kelp surfaces. Yet the lineage also
includes reference sequences from a variety of other marine habitats, indicating that RB1 is not a kelp-specific
lineage. The RB1 and RB2 lineages, defined in this study,
are clearly related to the “Pirellulae“, a lineage including
the genera Pirellula, Rhodopirellula and Blastopirellula
(formerly all included in the genus Pirellula). Yet our
phylogenetic analyses did not place them reliably with
any of the described genera, indicated by the bootstrap
support for the relevant branches in Figure 4. There are
no sequences of cultured strains within the RB1 and RB2
lineages available in the databases. Another uncultured
lineage, the so-called OM190 planctomycetes (Silva taxonomy) is also represented by clones from kelp surfaces
at all sampling times, yet in low numbers. This is a lineage that appears to branch off deeply in the planctomycete tree and representatives have been detected in a
variety of environments including seawater [36], soil [37]
and marine eukaryotes [8,38]. These lineages have yet to
be cultured and described and will reveal valuable information on planctomycete metabolism and evolution if
cultivation is successful.
Using conventional approaches, the Rhodopirellula sp.
strain P1 could easily be isolated. Several closely related
strains have been brought into culture earlier [21]. However, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of P1 does not correspond to any of the abundant OTUs detected on the

Bengtsson and Øvreås BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:261

kelp surfaces, for example within the RB1 lineage. Kelp
surfaces are nevertheless a promising source for isolation of novel planctomycete strains, using more ambitious and creative approaches that take into account the
environmental factors experienced by bacteria on kelp
surfaces. The rewards awaiting such attempts can be
substantial, given the representation of highly divergent
lineages of the planctomycete tree in kelp surface
biofilms.

Conclusions
Kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) surface biofilms have a
uniquely high relative abundance of planctomycetes.
Several distinct lineages are represented, and the diversity and composition of the planctomycetes change
during the year, probably influenced by aging of the
kelp tissue. The finding of abundant planctomycete
populations in kelp surface biofilms agrees well with
the view of heterotrophic planctomycetes as surface
attached, specialized degraders of sulfated polysaccharides in the marine environment, as kelps are known to
produce such substances. Furthermore, we wish to
extend this view by hypothesizing that many heterotrophic planctomycetes share a preference of intimate
coexistence with eukaryotes, which may be linked to
antibiotic resistance. The study addresses the urgent
need for more detailed, quantitative knowledge on the
diverse marine planctomycetes.
Methods
Sample collection and preparation

Kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) was collected at one site
near Bergen, Norway (60° 09.706’ N, 5° 02.371’ E) in
February 2007 and in July 2007. These sampling times
were selected based on a previous study that detected
low (February) and high proportions (July) of planctomycetes at these times [18]. In addition, kelp was
sampled at the same site in September 2008 to obtain
fresh biofilm material for cultivation of planctomycetes. Six replicate kelp individuals were collected
from a depth of 5 to 9 m by dredging from a boat at
each sampling occasion and were kept cool until
further processing (a few hours). Biofilm samples
were obtained from the middle part of the kelp
lamina (blade) of each kelp individual. The lamina
areas used for biofilm sampling were thoroughly
washed with sterile seawater. Biofilm for DNA extraction was sampled by scraping off material from the
kelp surface with a sterile scalpel as described previously [18]. Biofilm for FISH was sampled by cutting
out whole pieces of the kelp lamina in order for the
attached biofilm to remain intact. Sample collection
and preparation procedures are described in greater
detail in [18].

FISH

Kelp lamina pieces (1 × 0.5 cm) were fixed in 2% buffered paraformaldehyde overnight, washed twice in 50%
EtOH in PBS and stored in the same solution at -20°C.
Prior to FISH, the kelp pieces were dehydrated in 96%
EtOH and air-dried. Each sample kelp piece was further
divided into 0.5 × 0.5 cm pieces, that were used for
hybridization either with the general Bacterial probe mix
Eub338 I-III [28] or the planctomycete specific probe
Pla46 [19]. In addition, a subset of samples were hybridized with the probe Pir1223 [20] that is reported to be
specific for the genera Pirellula, Blastopirellula and Rhodopirellula (formerly all included in Pirellula). Several
samples were also hybridized with the Non338 probe to
check for signals caused by unspecific hybridization or
autofluorescence of bacterial cells. All probes were
bound to the fluorochrome Cy3, as previous investigations have shown that it gives superior fluorescence signals over the otherwise troublesome autofluorescence of
the kelp cells compared to other fluorochromes such as
fluorescein (Bengtsson, unpublished data). The formamide concentrations in the hybridization solution for
the respective probes were 35% for the Eub338 I-III
mix, 30% for Pla46 and 30% for Pir1223. Formamide
concentrations of 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40% were evaluated
on a subset of the September samples for the Pla46
probe. FISH was carried out according to [39] with
some modifications. In summary, the dry kelp pieces
were soaked in hybridization solution and hybridized at
46°C for 3 hours inside capped 0.5 ml plastic tubes.
After stringent washing and subsequent washing with
dH2O, the kelp pieces were counter-stained with DAPI
and mounted on glass slides as described in [18].
Fluorescence microscopy

Digital images of randomly selected microscopic fields
were captured for counting of DAPI stained cells and
FISH hybridized cells. Image capture and counting were
carried out as previously described [18]. The percentage
FISH hybridized cells of the total cell count (DAPI
stained cells) was calculated for every individual microscope field captured, and an average percentage was calculated for each sample.
Isolation and cultivation of planctomycetes from kelp
surfaces

Freshly scraped off biofilm material from September
2008 suspended in sterile seawater was used to inoculate
M30 medium [4] diluted in 3/4 parts sterile seawater
supplemented with ampicillin (0.2 mg/ml). After growth
was detected, the liquid culture was plated out on M30
medium solidified with gellan gum (Gelzan, SigmaAldrich), and individual colonies were picked and replated several times to obtain pure cultures.

DNA extraction

Scraped off biofilm was suspended in sterile filtered
and autoclaved seawater and the cells were pelleted by
centrifugation. DNA was extracted from the pellets as
previously described [18]. Equal volumes of the DNA
extracts from the 6 replicate kelp plants from each
sampling time were pooled into one sample per sampling time. The purpose if this was to obtain an overall
picture of the planctomycete populations at each sampling time. Variation in OTU composition between
individual kelp laminae is not captured by this
approach, but has been addressed previously for the
whole bacterial communities [18]. The pooled DNA
extracts (from February 2007, July 2007 and September
2008) were used for the subsequent PCR amplification
and clone library construction.
PCR amplification and clone library construction

The Planctomycetes specific forward primer Pla46f
(5’-GGA TTA GGC ATG CAA GTC-3’) complementary
to the Pla46 FISH probe [19] and the general bacterial
reverse primer 1542r (5’-AAG GAG GTG ATC CAG
CCG CA-3’) [40] were used to amplify a near full length
fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of Planctomycetes. PCR
conditions were: 94°C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94°C for 1
min, 60°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min, and final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. Each 25 μl PCR reaction contained nuclease-free water, F511 buffer (Finnzymes), 0.1
mM of each dNTP (F506L, Finnzymes), 0.02% BSA, 0.5
μM of each primer, 0.02 U Dynazyme II F501-L (Finnzymes), and approximately 30 ng template DNA. Three
clone libraries, one from each sampling occasion, were
constructed using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Ninety-six clones were picked from each clone
library. Cloned fragments were reamplified using the
supplied M13 primer pair according to the manufacturers instructions.
Sequencing and sequence processing

All cloned fragments were sequenced in one direction
using the Pla46f primer. Sequencing was carried out with
the BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) at
the Bergen Sequencing Facility http://www.seqlab.uib.no
using an ABI 3700 sequencing system. Base calling from
the chromatogram files was done using the Phred software [41] (version 0.020425.c). The resulting sequences
representing partial fragments of the 16S rRNA gene
were used to select a subset of clones to sequence in the
reverse direction in order to obtain near complete length
16S rRNA gene fragments. The sequences were trimmed
to approximately 750 bp of good quality sequence and
aligned against the Silva seed alignment (release 102)
using the SINA web aligner [23]. The alignment was
imported into the ARB software package [42] (version

Page 10 of 12

5.0) and was manually edited to improve alignment quality. The resulting alignment was used to create a distance
matrix in ARB, which was used to cluster the sequences
into OTUs using the furthest neighbor algorithm in the
Mothur software [43] (version 1.9.0). Rarefaction and
overlap analysis were carried out in Mothur. The Shannon diversity index and the Chao1 richness estimate was
calculated in the R statistical environment ([44], functions: diversity and estimateR, package: vegan). Based on
the OTU clustering, one to six representatives of each
OTU were sequenced in reverse using the 1542r primer.
The resulting sequences were assembled using CAP3
[45] with the corresponding forward sequences to build
contigs spanning nearly the full length of the 16S rRNA
gene. The contigs were manually cropped to roughly the
same length using the Phred base quality scores of the
ends of the contigs as a guide. The resulting same-length
(about 1250 bp), good quality contiguous sequences were
checked for chimeras using Bellerophon [46] through the
online Greengenes interface [22]. The Rhodopirellula sp.
strain P1 was sequenced in forward and reverse direction
several times with different 16S rRNA gene primers. The
individual sequence reads were manually assembled into
one full-length consensus sequence.
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction

The near full-length sequences were aligned using the
SINA web aligner, imported into ARB and edited as
described in the previous section. Reference sequences
that were closely related to the clone sequences from
this study and sequences from cultured planctomycetes
were selected from the SILVA database and were
included in the tree calculations. Several tree calculation methods including neighbor joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP)
were used in combination with different conservatory
filters in ARB and the tree topologies compared to
ensure a reliable result. The final ML tree was calculated in ARB with 175 sequences using PhyML [47]
applying bootstrap analysis (1000 bootstraps) and no
filter. Four Verrucomicrobia sequences (accession numbers: AY271254, DQ302104, AB297805, AB297806)
were used as an outgroup in the tree calculation. The
tree was edited by removing some of the reference
sequences for clarity of presentation and the final
result is shown in Figure 4.
