Abstract
Background: Archaeosomes (ARC), vesicles prepared from total polar lipids (TPL) extracted from selected genera and
species from the Archaea domain, elicit both antibody and cell-mediated immunity to the entrapped antigen, as well as
efficient cross priming of exogenous antigens, evoking a profound memory response. Screening for unexplored Archaea
genus as new sources of adjuvancy, here we report the presence of two new Halorubrum tebenquichense strains isolated
from grey crystals (GC) and black mood (BM) strata from a littoral Argentinean Patagonia salt flat. Cytotoxicity,
intracellular transit and immune response induced by two subcutaneous (sc) administrations (days 0 and 21) with BSA
entrapped in ARC made of TPL either form BM (ARC-BM) and from GC (ARC-GC) at 2% w/w (BSA/lipids), to C3H/HeN
mice (25 μg BSA, 1.3 mg of archaeal lipids per mouse) and boosted on day 180 with 25 μg of bare BSA, were determined.
Results: DNA G+C content (59.5 and 61.7% mol BM and GC, respectively), 16S rDNA sequentiation, DNA-DNA
hybridization, arbitrarily primed fingerprint assay and biochemical data confirmed that BM and GC isolates were two nonpreviously described strains of H. tebenquichense. Both multilamellar ARC mean size were 564 ± 22 nm, with -50 mV
zeta-potential, and were not cytotoxic on Vero cells up to 1 mg/ml and up to 0.1 mg/ml of lipids on J-774 macrophages
(XTT method). ARC inner aqueous content remained inside the phago-lysosomal system of J-774 cells beyond the first
incubation hour at 37°C, as revealed by pyranine loaded in ARC. Upon subcutaneous immunization of C3H/HeN mice,
BSA entrapped in ARC-BM or ARC-GC elicited a strong and sustained primary antibody response, as well as improved
specific humoral immunity after boosting with the bare antigen. Both IgG1 and IgG2a enhanced antibody titers could be
demonstrated in long-term (200 days) recall suggesting induction of a mixed Th1/Th2 response.
Conclusion: We herein report the finding of new H. tebenquichense non alkaliphilic strains in Argentinean Patagonia
together with the adjuvant properties of ARC after sc administration in mice. Our results indicate that archaeosomes
prepared with TPL from these two strains could be successfully used as vaccine delivery vehicles.

Background
In 1997, the pioneering work of Sprott showed that
parenteral administration of nano-sized vesicles (archaeosomes, ARC) prepared with total polar lipids (TPL)
extracted from microorganisms of the Archaea domain of
life [1], produced a strong humoral response in mice [2].
Archaeal lipids exhibit radically different hydrocarbon
backbones and polar head groups, as compared to polar
lipids synthesized by organisms from Eukarya and Bacteria
domains. Archaeal lipid backbones possess ether linkages
and isoprenoid chains, mainly phytanyl and bysphythanediyl archaeols and caldarchaeols- in sn-2,3 enantiomeric
configuration, in contrast to the ester linkages, straight
fatty acyl chains and sn-1,2 configuration of the glycerophospholipids from Eukarya and Bacteria domains [3].
Ether links are more resistant to acid hydrolysis than esters
and the backbone/head group cross section of archaeal
lipids is almost two folds higher than that of glycerophospholipids from Eukarya and Bacteria domains [4,5]. The
same as liposomes, ARC can be prepared by self association of archaeal lipids upon a small input of energy in
aqueous media (thin film hydration). However, beyond
those apparent similarities, there are remarkable structural differences: the ARC surface is highly entropic, possessing half the surface tension than that of liposomes
[5,6] and its permeability to protons and sodium cation is
nearly one third of that determined for liposomes; the
inclusion of macrocyclic archaeols and caldarchaeols further impairs ARC permeability to water and small solutes
[7,8].
Those structural features make the ARC capable of establishing unique interactions with the biological environment, specifically eliciting adjuvancy to foreign proteins
upon subcutaneous administration in preclinical models
by strongly stimulating both the humoral as well as the
cellular response, together with a sharp memory recall.
Additionally, lipopolysaccharides are absent in Archaea
[9] and, opposite to conventional immunomodulators
that usually must be included into the liposomal structure
[10,11], no toxicity has been found after parenteral
administration of ARC, even at high or multiple dosage
[12,13].
For strategic development of Third World countries, it is
of crucial importance to count on vaccines of unproblematic storage-conservation, with high resistance to hydrolysis, oxidation and mechanical destruction, or easily
reconstitutable upon lyophilization [14]. Adjuvants
should preferably be biodegradable, non toxic, abundant,
cheap and available from sustainable sources. Because
ARC are suitable candidates to fulfill those requirements,
it is relevant to survey the adjuvant properties of ARC
made of TPL extracted from unexplored archaeal genera
and species. In such context, we determined the cytotoxic-

ity, intracellular transit and adjuvant activity of ARC prepared with total polar lipids of two H. tebenquichense
strains isolated from Argentine Patagonia, upon two subcutaneous BSA doses followed by a single boosting inoculation in C3H/HeN mice.

Results
Strain isolation, growth and characterization
Halophilic archaea isolated from the upper gray crystals
(GC) and the deeper black mud (BM) strata grown in
enriched medium were characterized as disc-shaped (0.2
× 0.8 mm), motile Gram-negative microorganisms. Differentially, GC and BM colonies exhibited orange-red and
reddish pigmentation, respectively. However, when
grown in basal medium, a mixture of pleomorphic rods
and disc-shaped motile archaebacteria displaying undefined Gram staining was observed.

The colonies grew in 1020% NaCl-containing media,
without Mg+2 requirements, but optimum growth
occurred at 20% NaCl, 40°C and pH 7.3 7.5. Remarkably, GC was able to grow at increased temperature (50°C).
Both colonies were non-alkaliphilic, aerobic, oxidase and
catalase positive. Only GC produced acid from a fructose
source. Fructose, pyruvate, trehalose and galactose, but
not starch, were used as sole carbon and energy sources by
both colonies (Table 1). Both GC and BM organisms were
chloramphenicol resistant and experienced no lysis even
in the total absence of sodium salt.
For each isolate, a nearly complete 16S rDNA gene region
(1300 bp) was sequenced (GenBank accession numbers
GQ182977 and GQ182978) and compared with the same
segment from other halophilic archaea. Phylogenetic
analyses showed that both isolates belong to the Archaea
domain and are related to the Halorubrum cluster, with the
highest similarity to Halorubrum tebenquichense (98%).
The G+C contents of the two isolates and the reference
strain ALT-92T [15] were determined. BM and GC had a
G+C content of 59.5 and 61.7 mol%, respectively (Table
1), whereas ALT-92T presented 63.2 mol%. On the basis
of the ad hoc committee recommendations [16,17] of a
threshold value of 70% DNA-DNA similarity for the definition of bacterial species, the two strains formed an
homogeneous cluster with a high degree of internal similarity (DNA-DNA similarity > 90.5%) and should be considered as members of the same H. tebenquichense species.
The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) or
arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR)
DNA fingerprinting technique provides one of the most
sensitive and efficient of current methods for distinguishing different strains of a species [18]. In order to corroborate such differences between the two isolates, AP-PCR
fingerprint analysis was performed (Figure 1). The band

pattern showed visible differences between BM and GC
fingerprint (absence or presence of 2, 4, 6 and 7 bands),
in concordance with biochemical tests and 16S rDNA
sequence data. In sum, differences in fructose metabolism, utilization of starch and optimum growth conditions (Table 1), together with those revealed by the APPCR, suggested that BM and GC isolates were different not
only from those described for H. tebenquichense ALT-92 T

[15], but also between each other and could be classified
as new H. tebenquichense strains.
Lipid extraction and characterization
The TPL, defined as the acetone insoluble portion of the
total lipids, extracted from frozen cells obtained from a
batch of 8 litres, ranged between 90 and 120 mg for each
isolate.

A high content of phosphate groups is reported in the literature for the Halorubrum genus. Hence, for TPL quantification two colorimetric methods were applied: one, for
detecting total phosphate (Bötcher) and the other for
detecting organic phosphate (Stewart). Two calibration
curves were prepared employing dry mass of TPL as standards that resulted linear between 1040 μg for Bötcher and
20400 μg for Stewart, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.997, for each source of TPL.
On the other hand, calibration curves using inorganic
phosphate (NaH2PO4) as standard were prepared with the
aim of determining the phosphate percentage of archaeal
lipids by the Bötcher method. A linear plot of dry mass of
TPL vs. μg inorganic phosphate was determined and the
relative amount of phosphate in the extracted TPL was
similar for both isolates, in the order of 6.25% w/w.
ESI -MS polar lipids profile
The ESI-MS spectrum (negative ions) analyses of the TPL
of H. tebenquichense, BM and GC showed three main peaks
at m/z 805, 899 and 1055.9 (Figure 2). In addition, GC
displayed intense ion peak at m/z 1521 that was less
intense for H. tebenquichense and BM extracts. The peaks at
m/z 731.5 (diagnostic of PA) and 886 (PGS) that were
reported for Halorubrum sp. [19] could not be detected in
any of our samples. Negative ion ESI-MS (Figure 2A, B and
2C) identified major signals corresponding to PG m/z
805.7, PGP-Me m/z 899.5 (as monocharged peak), 449
(as bicharged peak) and S-DGD m/z 1055.7 (as monocharged peak). The diagnostic peak of archaeal cardiolipin
(BPG) at m/z 760 (as bicharged peak) and 1521 (monocharged peak) was detected only as a small signal in the
three TPL extracts.

ARC characterization
As revealed by transmission electron microscopy, the two
ARC preparations were multilamellar, with a mean size of
564 ± 22 nm and zeta-potential near to -50 mV. BSA
incorporation did not modify size or zeta potential, the
protein/lipid ratio was 20 μg/mg and the encapsulation
efficiency around 34%.
ARC uptake by cells and cellular toxicity
None of the ARC or HSPC:cholesterol liposomes significantly reduced the viability of non phagocytic cells (Vero
cell line) upon 24 h incubation (Figure 3A). On the other
hand, 10 μg/ml ARC-GC was non cytotoxic but the higher
concentrations reduced cell viability by 25%, while
increased concentrations (up to 100 μg/ml) of ARC-BM
and HSPC:cholesterol liposomes did not affect cultured
macrophages (J-774 cell line) (Figure 3B).

As shown in Figure 4A, and independently of the TPL
source, a minimal time period of 30 min was required for
ARC uptake by phagocytic cells, as judged by the detection
of intracellular fluorescence after incubation with both
ARC-HPTS/DPX. In addition, J-774 macrophages incubated 45 min with both ARC- HPTS/DPX showed punctual fluorescence (as shown by arrows in Figure 4A) that
resulted from the confinement of the HPTS/DPX into
vesicular compartments in the cytoplasm. In case membrane fusion between ARC and the phagosome occurred,
the ARC inner content should be released to the cytoplasm. Consequently, the HPTS would be dequenched
from DPX and an homogeneous brightness filling the
cytoplasm should be observed [20,21]. However, the
punctual emission upon excitation at 440 nm, indicating
confinement of the pair HPTS/DPX in acidic compartments, remained unchanged. Hence, the ARC did not
fuse/disrupt, staying inside the phagosomes for at least 60
minutes (Figure 4B).
Antibody response
To evaluate the adjuvant activity of both ARC formulations, we tested the antigen-specific humoral immune
response after immunization of mice with BSA-loaded
ARC. Following sc inoculations at 0 and 21 days, mice
responded by day 28 with similar anti-BSA antibody
(total IgG) titers for both ARC-BM/GC-BSA (Figure 5A),
and presented a strong enhancement (~2 log, p < 0.01) of
antibody titers over those of BSA and BSA-Al groups.
Immunization with either empty ARC-BM/GC failed to
evoke any anti-BSA IgG response, whereas only one out of
four mice receiving adjuvant-free BSA displayed detectable specific antibodies. Mean titers in ARC-BM/GC-BSA
groups were sustained until at least day 60 and declined
by day 135. In all cases, very little anti-BSA IgM reactivity
was detected throughout the study (data not shown).

To investigate the ability of ARC to generate long-term
memory immunity, a boost-dose with BSA alone was
injected on day 180. Three weeks later, a significantly
higher serum antibody response (>1 log, p < 0.05) was
detected in ARC-BM/GC-BSA compared with the BSA
group (Figure 5B).
We further examined the IgG isotype distribution in the
sera of immunized mice on day 200. Both IgG1 and IgG2a
increased antibody titers could be demonstrated in longterm responses from ARC-BM/GC-BSA groups (Figure 6).

The extreme halophilic archaea genus Halorubrum is
worldwide distributed [22-28] either at high altitude as
well as under the sea level [15,25,29]. The only Halorubrum species so far described in South America is the Halorubrum tebenquichense ALT6-92 strain isolated from the
water of Lake Tebenquiche at the unique environment of
the Atacama saltern, located in northern Chile at 2300
metres above sea level [15]. Here we report the finding of
new H. tebenquichense non alkaliphilic strains in a salt flat
from the littoral of the Argentinean Patagonia, the Salina
Chica in Península de Valdés (42° 32' S, 63° 59' W), at the
province of Chubut. Remarkably, the Salina Chica is separated from Lake Tebenquiche by the highest (nearly 7000
m) and younger (70 million years) mountains in America,
the Cordillera de los Andes, distant 2500 km south-east
away and placed 40 meters below sea level in a zone of
temperate weather.
The membranes of extremely halophilic archaea such as
H. tebenquichense have several unique characteristics that
vary little within specific genera [30]. Phospholipids with
ethanolamine, inositol, and serine head groups are generally absent and specific phosphatidylglycerol phospholipids, sometimes including several sulfated glycolipids,
predominate. Extreme halophiles contain 5080% archaetidylglycerol methylphosphate (PGP-Me), an archaeal
analogue of phosphatidylglycerol methylphosphate [31]
that contributes to membrane stability in hypersaline
environments [32], archaetidylglycerol (PG), and also
some strains have minor amounts of sulfated PG [33].
Analysis of ESI-MS spectra of polar lipid isolates from H.
tebenquichense, BM and GC, through comparison with the
reference data [34,35] suggested the main phospholipids
present in the extracts were phosphatidylglycerol (PG),
phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl ester (PGP-Me)
and sulfated diglycosyl diphytanylglycerol diether (SDGD). The prominent peak at 1055.9 corresponded to SDGD and is representative of the Halorubrum genus [36].
The archaeal cardiolipin, bisphosphatidyl glycerol (BPG)
was only found as traces in the three samples. While the
complete lipid quantitation from each sample as well as
the RMN identification of the S-DGD sulfonolipid will be
accomplished in ongoing research.
Up to now, only ARC made of TPL extracted from Methanobrevibacter smithii, a methanogen archaea, are known
to enhance the recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells [37,38], induce co-stimulatory molecules
expression [38], elicit CD8+ cytotoxic responses even in
the absence of CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes [39], and to
evoke a profound memory response, those all important
stimuli that other vesicular systems such as liposomes,
niosomes and ISCOMS are unable to trigger [40]. Additionally, although inflammation in innate responses can

bodies were raised by both ARC-BM/GC-BSA, suggesting
induction of a mixed Th1/Th2 response, in agreement
with a previous report [39]. Our preliminary finding of
humoral immune memory response elicited by ARC from
extreme halophiles, together with established data on primary CTL and memory responses from ARC made of TPL
from methanogens and hyperthermophiles, suggests that
the headgroups are of crucial importance in the induction
of immune responses, as recently determined by employing synthetic glycoarchaeols [45,46].

enable further adaptive responses [41], ARC made of TPL
from M. smithii evoke immunologic memory in the lack of
visible inflammation, activating dendritic cells in the
absence of IL-12-dependent initial inflammatory
response [42].
As regard to the extreme halophiles, ARC made of TPL
extracted from Halobacterium salinarum was reported to
induce a robust initial CTL and antibody response in mice
[43]. Such titers, however, were not increased after boost
administration and failed to induce a significant memory
response. Only ARC made of TPL extracted from the
hyperthermophile Thermoplasma acidophilum produced
the most intense antibody memory responses to antigen
challenge, together with a parallel induction of intense
cell cycling in CD4+ T cells suggesting efficient maintenance of T-cell memory [43]. A further study showed that
among ARC from nine archaeal strains tested, all triggered
remarkable primary CTL responses but only M. smithii
and T. acidophilum, both rich in caldarchaeols, evoked a
strong recall at > 50 weeks [44].
This is the first report of adjuvancy after parenteral administration of ARC-BM/GC-BSA. Both ARC elicited a strong
and lasting primary antibody response, and remarkably in
the absence of caldarchaeols in their lipid compositions,
an enhanced memory humoral response after boosting
with the bare antigen in C3H/HeN mice upon subcutaneous immunization. ARC-BM/GC-BSA initially triggered
higher antibody titers than BSA formulated in alum adjuvant. Additionally, IgG isotype analysis of immunized
mice revealed that both BSA-specific IgG1 and IgG2a anti-

To sum up, even though our results for IgG isotyping in a
single strain of mice (C3H/HeN) may not be extrapolated
to the response in humans, it is promising to note that, in
preclinical evaluation in animal model, ARC-BM/GC-BSA
would appear as an efficient adjuvant delivery system to
promote both humoral and, probably, cell-mediated
immunity to the entrapped antigen.

Conclusion
Two sc immunizations with either ARC-BM/GC-BSA, plus
a boost with BSA alone rendered a long term humoral
response stronger than that achieved with BSA formulated
in alum.
Remarkably, our results were elicited in C3H/HeN mice,
less prone to render potent humoral responses than
BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds [43]. Such preliminary
results merit deeper insights on the search of CD8+ CTL
activity and the induction of this type of long term memory upon sc immunization with ARC. As judged by the
phagosomal traffic followed by the pair HPTS/DPX
loaded in ARC, our results indicated that there was neither
fusion nor ARC content delivery to the cytoplasm, for at
least 60 minutes post ARC uptake. Hence, cytoplasmic
delivery of hydrosoluble material loaded in ARC-BM/GC
should not happen, could either take longer than 60 minutes (considering that ARC-BM/GC were multilamellar,
with negative zeta potential at physiological pH, both factors that impair or delay intermembrane fusion) or could
occur through mechanisms other than the fusion mechanism recently reported for Methanobrevibacter smithii
archaeosomes [47]. Finally, in spite of their TPL invariance, extreme halophilic archaea are source of glycolipid
fractions that probably markedly influence the induction
of primary responses and memory recall [30]. In view of
that, the complete composition of ARC TPL and the mechanisms of recruitment, uptake and intracytoplasmic traffic
of this antigen-delivery system are currently being analyzed in parallel with the ARC ability to induce expression
of co-stimulatory molecules on professional APC.

Culture growth and characterization
Soil samples were collected from Salina Chica, Península
de Valdés, Chubut, Argentina. Samples were classified
according to their strata source as upper grey crystals (GC)
and deeper black mud (BM). Isolation of microorganisms
from each strata was done by seeding an aliquot on basal

Salt requirement for maintaining stability of the cell envelope was determined as described by Oren [49] by measuring the loss of turbidity of cell suspensions in medium
of decreasing concentrations of NaCl (8, 6, 4, 2 and 0% w/
v).
Biomass was generated in 8 l batch cultures in basal
medium supplemented with yeast extract, glucose and
antifoam (20 μl/l). Cultures were monitored by absorbance at 660 nm and harvested in late stationary phase for
storage as frozen cell pastes.
DNA isolation, G+C content
The DNA was isolated using a French pressure cell
(Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY) and was purified by
chromatography on hydroxyapatite as described [51]. The
G+C content (mol%) of the DNA was determined by the
midpoint value of the thermal denaturation profile (Tm)
with a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer at 260 nm, programmed for temperature increases of 1.0°C/min [52].
Tm was determined by the graphic method described by
Ferragut and Leclerc [53] and the G+C content was calculated using Owen and Hill's equation (1979).

DNA Fingerprint
DNA from the isolates was used for arbitrarily primed
PCR (AP-PCR) fingerprint assay. Three small primers were
used: T3GC (5' CCCAKTCGTGAWTCATGCT 3'), T3R, (5'
TCCTCAYTTAATNAMCATGCT 3') and Rsh (5'
ATCAAAAT 3'). PCR was performed for 35 cycles, starting
with 10 s of denaturation at 92°C followed by 60 s of
annealing at 30°C and 90 s of elongation at 72°C. The
reaction mixture contained 10 ng of genomic DNA, 3 mM
MgCl2, 1 μM of each primer, 0.2 μM of dNTPs, and 2 U of
Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl.
The PCR results were visualized in a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Image Kodak Software.

Serum samples were collected three weeks after boosting
and ELISA analyzed for IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2a). Values represent mean titers ± SEM.
PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene coding sequence
and sequencing
Purified genomic DNA was used for PCR amplification of
the16S rDNA gene. The following two sets of primers were
used on the basis of the highly conserved regions of halobacterial 16S rDNA sequences as described by Ihara [48]:
f1 (5' ATTCCGGTTGATCCTGC 3'), r1 (5' TTTAAGTTTCATCCTTG 3') and f2 (5' AACCGGATTAGATACCC 3'),
r2 (5' GTGATCCAGCCGCAGATTCC 3'). PCR was performed with 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 37°C and
90 s at 72°C. The PCR products were analyzed by 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis. The products were purified
from the gel using S.N.A.P.™ Gel Purification Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced directly by the dideoxy chain termination method [54].
Phylogenetic analysis
The obtained sequences were compared with previously
described 16S rDNA sequences of halophilic archaeas
from the NCBI database. The sequences were aligned by
using CLUSTAL X 1.83 [55,56] and phylogenetic trees
were constructed by the neighbour-joining method with
Kimura two-parameter calculation in MEGA 3.1 software.
The confidence levels for branching orders were evaluated
by the bootstrap method [57].
DNA-DNA hybridization
DNA-DNA hybridization studies were performed as
described by De Ley [58] under consideration of the modifications described by Huss [59] using a Cary® 100 Bio
UV/VIS-spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostatted 6 × 6 multicell changer and a temperature controller with in-situ temperature probe (Varian, Inc).

Lipid isolation
Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer as
modified for extreme halophiles [60], from frozen and
thawed biomass of each colony with Cl3CH:CH3OH:H2O
(1:2:0.9; v:v), and the total polar lipid (TPL) fraction was
collected by precipitation from cold acetone. Phospholipids of the TPL were quantified by Bötcher [61] and Stewart
[62] methods.
ESI-MS analysis
ESI-MS analysis was performed using a Thermo Finnigan
LCQ Ion Max mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan MAT,
San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a electrospray ionization source. Analyses were carried out in the loop injection mode with dried lipid extracts dissolved in
chloroform-methanol (1:1 vol/vol). Samples (5 μl)
injected via a 10 μl loop were transferred to an MS electrospray interface (ESI) at flow rate of 10 μL/min. Interface
conditions were as follows: nebulizer gas (air) 12 l/min,
curtain gas (nitrogen), 1.2 l/min needle voltage 5.0 kV
(negative ions), mass range 50 2000 amu.
ARC preparation and physicochemical characterization
Two different types of ARC were prepared from TPL isolated from each colony: ARC-GC and ARC-BM. Briefly, 20
mg of TPL from CHCl3: CH3OH (9:1, v/v) solution was
rotary evaporated at 40°C in round bottom flask until
organic solvent elimination. The thin lipid film was
flushed with N2 and hydrated at 40°C with 1 ml of 10 mM
Tris-HCl buffer plus 0.9% w/v NaCl, pH 7.4 (Tris buffer)
(empty ARC) or with 1 ml of 10 mg/ml BSA solution in
Tris buffer (ARC-CG/BM-BSA). The resultant suspensions
were sonicated (20 min in a bath type sonicator 80 W, 40
KHz) and submitted to 5 cycles of freeze/thaw between
80 and 37°C. Free BSA was removed by centrifugation
and washing with Tris buffer (10000 × g for 20 min).
Liposomes made of HSPC:cholesterol (1:1 mol:mol) were
prepared in the same way.

The BSA/phospholipid weight ratio from each preparation was determined by phospholipid and protein quan-

titation. Phospholipids were quantified by Bötcher [61]
whereas BSA content was measured by Bradford [63].
Mean ARC size was determined by dynamic light scattering with a 90 Plus Particle size analyzer (Brookhaven
Instruments) and Zeta potential was determined with a
Zetasizer 4 (Malvern). Electron microscopy images of ARC
upon phosphotungstic acid negative staining were
obtained with a TEM Jeon 1210, 120 Kv, equipped with
EDS analyzer LINK QX 2000.
Cytotoxicity
Upon incubation with ARC, cell viability was measured as
mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity employing a tetrazolium salt (XTT) on Vero cells and the murine macrophage-like cell line J-774 [64].

Cells maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2, in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2
mM glutamine, 100 UI/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well
in 96-well flat bottom microplates. Culture medium of
nearly confluent cell layers was replaced by 100 μl of
medium containing 10, 100, 500 or 1000 μg/ml of lipids.
Upon 24 h at 37°C, the cells were washed with 0.1 M
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2, and incubated
with 200 μg/ml of XTT for 4 h. XTT solution was removed
and the extent of reduction of XTT to formazan within the
cells was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450
nm using an ELISA reader. Liposomes made of HSPC:cholesterol (1:1, mol:mol) were used as control.
Cell uptake
Cell uptake and intracellular fate of ARC loaded with the
fluorophore/quencher pair HPTS/DPX was followed
upon incubation with J-774 macrophages by fluorescence
microscopy. ARC loaded with HPTS/DPX was prepared as
stated before, except that the lipid films were hydrated
with a solution of 35 mM HPTS and 50 mM DPX in Tris
buffer. J-774 cells grown to near confluence on rounded
coverslips in 24-well plate were incubated with 10 μg/ml
μg of ARC-GC/BM-HPTS/DPX at 37°C for 10, 20, 30, 45
and 60 min. After incubation, suspensions were removed,
cells were washed, and coverslips were mounted on a fluorescence microscope. Cell-associated HPTS fluorescence
was monitored using a Nikon Alphaphot 2 YS2 instrument.

Similarly, the intracellular fate of both fluorescent ARC
upon 45 min-incubation with J-774 cells was followed by
monitoring the HPTS fluorescent signal along 1 h.
Immunization
Female 68-week-old C3H/HeN mice were obtained from
University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and maintained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/71

under standard conditions. The study was conducted following the Institutional Experimental Guidelines for Animal Studies. Groups of five animals were immunized
subcutaneously (sc) on days 0 and 21 with 25 μg of BSA;
25 μg of BSA with added 100 μg of Al2O3 (BSA-Al, Alhydrogel®, Superfos Biosector, Vedbaek, Denmark) or 25 μg
of BSA entrapped in any type of ARC (ARC-GC-BSA or
ARC-BM-BSA; 1.3 mg of archaeal lipids each ARC). Control mice were injected with equivalent amount of empty
TEB. All groups were boosted with 25 μg of adjuvant-free
BSA on day 180.
Evaluation of antibody response
Blood was collected from the tail vein at various timepoints after immunization, as specified in the figure legends, and sera were analyzed by ELISA for the presence of
anti-BSA antibodies. Briefly, microtiter plates (Nunc,
Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4°C with 45
μg/ml BSA diluted in 0.1 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer
(pH 9.6) and then blocked for 1 h at 37°C with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (0.2% PBST) after washing with
0.05% PBST. Another wash as above described was followed by the addition of 100 μl of 3-fold dilutions of individual sera in 0.05% PBST. After 2 h at 37°C and further
washing, the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Pierce, Rockford, IL) diluted 1:2000 in 0.025% PBST. For
antibody isotyping, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
rat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a revealing antisera
(PharMingen, San Diego, CA), diluted 1:1000, were used.
The plates were further washed and the reactions were
developed by adding the ABTS substrate [2, 2'-azino-bis
(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo]. Color was allowed to develop for
approximately 10 min at room temperature in the dark.
The optical density was measured at 405 nm using an
ELISA reader (Multiskan Ex, Thermo Labsystems, Finland). Antibody titers are represented as end-point dilutions exhibiting an optical density of 0.3 units above
background.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out with the Prisma 4.0
Software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). Group means
were evaluated by ANOVA with Tukey's analysis to compare individual groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered
significant.
