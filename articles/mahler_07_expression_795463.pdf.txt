Abstract
Background: The intermediate filament Nestin has been reported as a marker for stem cells and
specific precursor cell populations in the developing mammalian central nervous system (CNS).
Nestin expressing precursors may give rise to neurons and glia. Mouse nestin expression starts at
the onset of neurulation in the neuroectodermal cells and is dramatically down regulated when
progenitor cells differentiate and become postmitotic. It has been reported that in the adult
zebrafish (Danio rerio) active neurogenesis continues in all major subdivisions of the CNS, however
few markers for zebrafish precursors cells are known, and Nestin has not been described in
zebrafish.
Results: We cloned a zebrafish nestin gDNA fragment in order to find a marker for precursor cells
in the developing and postembryonic brain. Phylogenetic tree analysis reveals that this zebrafish
ortholog clusters with Nestin sequences from other vertebrates but not with other intermediate
filament proteins. We analyzed nestin expression from gastrula stage to 4 day larvae, and in postembryonic brains. We found broad expression in the neuroectoderm during somitogenesis. In the
larvae, nestin expression progressively becomes restricted to all previously described proliferative
zones of the developing and postembryonic central nervous system. nestin expressing cells of the
forebrain also express PCNA during late embryogenesis, identifying them as proliferating precursor
or neural stem cells. nestin is also expressed in the cranial ganglia, in mesodermal precursors of
muscle cells, and in cranial mesenchymal tissue.
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that in zebrafish, like in mammals, the expression of the
intermediated neurofilament nestin gene may serve as a marker for stem cells and proliferating
precursors in the developing embryonic nervous system as well as in the postembryonic brain.

Background
The intermediate filament Nestin has been reported as a
marker for stem cells as well as precursor populations of
specific cell types in the developing mammalian central
nervous system (CNS) giving rise to both neurons and glia

[1,2]. Nestin is classified as type IV neurofilament, which
together with microfilaments and microtubules constitute
a major component in the cytoskeleton. In contrast to
other more general cytoskeletal elements, intermediate filaments are expressed in a cell type specific manner, and

major differentiation steps are marked by the transition
from one intermediate filament type to another. With the
onset of neurulation neuroectodermal cells start to
express nestin. The expression is dramatically down regulated when progenitor cells differentiate and become
postmitotic [2-4], reviewed in [5].
nestin mRNA also has been reported to be expressed in the
developing myotome [6] and skeleton muscle precursors
[2,6], as well as in mesenchymal pancreatic cells [7], the
intestine [8], and cranial ganglia [9].
While Nestin has been investigated extensively in mammalian systems, including rat [2], mouse [10], and human
[11], as well as in chick [12], it has not been reported for
fish so far. Zebrafish have evolved as a genetic and experimental model organism that is ideally suited to study
basic principles of neural development [13-15]. It has
been reported that in the adult zebrafish active neurogenesis continues in all major subdivisions of the CNS [16].
Thus, zebrafish serve as an excellent model for studying
neural stem cells and neural regeneration. In detailed
BrdU incorporation studies, distinct proliferation zones
have been identified in all subdomains of the zebrafish
brain along the rostrocaudal CNS axis [16-18]. It appears
that, like in mammals, neuroblasts are also continuously
generated in neurogenic niches in the subependymal/subventricular regions of the brain.
While BrdU incorporation studies may identify neural
stem cells, these experiments are not easily integrated into
most experimental setups. Other markers used to identify
zebrafish neural stem cells include: PCNA [19], MCM5
[15,20], and anti-phospho-histone antibodies. However,
these markers are not restricted to neural proliferating
cells. To identify a specific marker for neural stem cells
and precursors, we cloned and analyzed the expression of
a zebrafish Nestin ortholog.

fragment covering the second exon, we generated antisense probes, and investigated nestin expression in the
developing zebrafish brain.
Expression of nestin during zebrafish somitogenesis and in
neuronal tissues
We assayed the nestin expression pattern by in situ hybridization with an antisense RNA probe in zebrafish embryos
and larvae staged from 60 % epiboly up to 96 hours post
fertilization (hpf). We also determined nestin expression
in sections of the post-embryonic zebrafish brain at 28
dpf.

nestin expression was not detected before the 3 somite
stage (10–11 hpf) (Fig. 2A,B). Earliest expression of nestin
was detected during mid-neurulation (Fig. 2C–F"). At this
stage nestin is expressed in a domain laterally adjacent to
midline cells. Control embryos processed with a sense
RNA for nestin show no obvious staining at this stage (Fig.
2D). Serial sections reveal that adaxial mesoderm cells
express nestin in the trunk, and in the posterior trunk nestin is expressed in the neural plate (Fig. 2F–F"). At 18
somite stage nestin is also expressed in premigratory and
migrating neural crest cells (data not shown).
At 24 hpf nestin is widely expressed throughout the developing nervous system (Fig. 2G). A similar widespread
expression has been reported for comparable stages of
mouse development [1,3]. Zebrafish nestin expression is
restricted to more defined regions of the CNS as the
embryo further develops. We will now first describe the
non-neuronal expression domains and later focus on the
CNS expression.
Outside of the nervous system, mammalian nestin has
been reported to be expressed in head mesenchyme and
muscle precursors [6]. In contrast to nestin expression in
mouse, zebrafish nestin was detected neither in developing somites nor in the myotome of mature somites. In fin

Results
A zebrafish nestin ortholog
In order to find a marker for precursor cells in the developing zebrafish brain we analyzed nestin (nes) homologous genes in zebrafish. We compared nestin sequences
from various different species and performed a blast
search of zebrafish genomic sequences to identify whether
there are duplicated zebrafish nestin genes. We identified
a single nestin ortholog with the ENSEMBL gene number
ENSDAR00000040236 [21]. We compared the predicted
mRNA as well as other zebrafish intermediate filaments
with protein sequences from other species. Phylogenetic
tree analysis revealed that the predicted zebrafish Nestin
protein clusters with mouse, human, and chicken Nestin,
but not with the other intermediated neurofilaments (Fig.
1). Using PCR on genomic DNA we cloned a 704 bp nestin

joining method). For each protein either the NCBI, SwissProt or Ensembl ID numbers are noted.

buds nestin is expressed at 2 dpf in two stripes of mesoderm which will give rise to muscle tissue (Fig. 2I'). Further, from 4 dpf on nestin is expressed in craniofacial
mesenchyme adjacent to the ethmoid plate (eth) and palatoquadrate (pq) (Fig. 2K"; Fig. 4F,I,S) and weakly in epithelial cells of the gut (Fig. 2K"; Fig. 4Q) [8].

Expression of nestin in the central nervous system (CNS)
At 24 hpf nestin is expressed widely throughout the developing nervous system. Comparing nestin expression at 2
dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf in zebrafish embryos reveals that nestin expression becomes progressively restricted to
domains where the progenitor cell pools have been identified [18]: Ventricular zones (VZ) in the telencephalon
(TC) and diencephalon (DC), the midbrain hindbrain
boundary (MHB), and the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) of
the retina (Fig. 2G,I,J,K). From 2 dpf to 4 dpf, in the TC
and DC, nestin expression starts to be restricted to the ventricular zones in the region of the subpallium and the ventral DC (Fig. 3A–I;). At 2 dpf nestin expression in the
ventricular region of the DC is difficult to discern in whole
mount ISH embryos because of the broad expression
domain in the pretectal area (Fig. 3G). At 4 dpf the expression in the DC becomes more distinct (Fig. 3F). The pretectal nestin expression domain becomes also more
restricted with further development of the nervous system
and at 4 dpf it is restricted to very faint expression in a
domain close to the ventricle (Fig. 3C). In the retina nestin
expressing cells are initially detected in a broad zone
including the ganglion cell layer (Fig. 3M–O). Similar to
the diencephalon, nestin expression in the retina continuously regresses and by 4 dpf becomes restricted to the ciliary marginal zone, which constitutes the retinal
proliferation zone [22,23] (Fig. 3O). Further posterior in
the area of the MHB, the distribution of nestin positive
cells also becomes more localized to the ventricle walls
(Fig. 3G,H,I) from 1 dpf to 4 dpf. The MHB is clearly lined
by a row of nestin expressing cells at 3 dpf (Fig. 3K). In the
hindbrain initially broad nestin expression becomes
restricted to cell populations adjacent to the ventricle and
to some dorsal areas. Expression in the cerebellum also
progressively decreases (Fig. 2J,J"; Fig. 3A–C).

Further we performed sections through 2 dpf and 4 dpf
embryos to analyze in more detail the nestin expression
pattern especially in regions, which were difficult to examine by transmitted light microscopy of whole-mount in
situ hybridized embryos. In the TC nestin expression is
restricted to ventricular zones (Fig. 4A). From 2 dpf to 4
dpf nestin expression in the area of the dorsal TC and the
pretectal area is strongly down regulated (Fig. 4A–F). In
the DC cells close to the ventricle express nestin predominantly in the dorsal part of the ventricular region of the
DC (Fig. 4D,E). In parts of the intermediate hypothalamus nestin is expressed at 4 dpf (Fig 4N,O). Transversal
sections at the level of the MHB through 2 dpf and 4 dpf
zebrafish embryos revealed a strong nestin expression in
this area (Fig. 4G–I) and correlates with regions of ongoing active neurogenesis [24]. Further, in the HB a cluster
of cells bilaterally adjacent to the midline expresses nestin
(Fig. 2I'; Fig. 4J). At 4 dpf expression in the hindbrain is
almost completely absent, except for some scattered nestin

expressing cells in the medulla oblongata (Fig. 4P). Sections as well as whole mount ISH revealed, that nestin is
expressed throughout the spinal cord, except for the floorplate (Fig. 2I,I"; Fig. 4M). Zimmerman and colleagues [6]
report that in the nestin:lacZ transgenic mice nestin:LacZ
is not expressed in the floorplate and ventral midline. nestin mRNA is detectable in the ventral root of the spinal
cord (Fig. 2I"). Mammalian motor neurons do not express
nestin [6], but an antibody against Nestin protein (rat401)
stains rat ventral root before axon outgrowth [1].
Expression of nestin in the peripheral nervous system
(PNS)
nestin in mammals is strongly expressed in ganglia of the
posterior cranial nerves [9]. We also find strong expression at 2 dpf and 3 dpf in the octaval ganglion (ganglia of

the n. octavus, VIII, vestibulocochlear nerve) (Fig. 2I'; Fig.
4J,K), the anterior and posterior part of the lateral line
ganglia (associated with parts of VIIIth ganglion) (Fig. 2I';
Fig. 4H), the facial ganglia (n. facialis, VII) (Fig. 4H), and
the ganglia of the nervus vagus (X) (Fig. 4K,L). The ganglia
of the nervus vagus and the lateral line ganglia at this stage
may contain a mixture of already differentiated cells and
progenitor cells, with the latter situated more proximal to
the midline than the differentiated cells. At 3 dpf nestin is
still broadly expressed in cells of cranial ganglia (Fig. 2J).
At 4 dpf the expression appears reduced (Fig. 2K',K"), but
transversal sections through the head show that at 4 dpf
nestin is still expressed in the trigeminal (V) ganglion, the
octaval and lateral line ganglia, and the vagal ganglion
(Fig. 4N,O), and data not shown). In the torus semicircularis (TS), a sensory nucleus which is the mesencephalic
target of the octavolateralis-system [25], nestin expression
can also be detected (Fig. 4N,O). Similar to mammals [8],
at 4 dpf nestin expression is also detected in enteric ganglia
of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Fig. 4P).
nestin expressing cells co-express pcna in the forebrain
during late embryogenesis
Nestin has been reported as a marker for precursor populations of specific cell types in the developing mammalian
CNS [1,2]. The expression of nestin in cells close to the
ventricle throughout the CNS led to the assumption that
also in zebrafish nestin is a marker for proliferating precursor cells. Therefore, we performed double fluorescent in
situ hybridization to detect nestin and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression to investigate whether
pcna positive cells also co-express nestin in zones of proliferation. At 2 dpf we could detect areas with cells expressing both nestin and pcna in the proliferation zones of the
forebrain (Fig. 5A–C). Cells expressing nestin and pcna are
located along the TC ventricle (Fig. 5D–F) and in the ventricle walls of the ventral DC (Fig. 5G–I). Further, at 3 dpf
co-expression was detectable in the subventricular zone of
the TC (Fig. 5J–L). Thus, nestin expression appears to correlate with stem cell and precursor territories in the forebrain proliferation zones. However, expression domains
of nestin in the peripheral ganglia do not correlate with
pcna expression (data not shown), confirming that nestin
is also expressed in postmitotic or differentiated cells in
the peripheral nervous system.
nestin expression in post-embryonic stem cell zones and
migrating precursors
In order to investigate nestin expression in the post-embryonic zebrafish brain we examined nestin mRNA distribution in 28 dpf zebrafish brain. We performed whole brain
ISH and generated serial transversal sections (50 micrometer) along the rostrocaudal neural axis. We use the neuroanatomical terms for the adult zebrafish according to
the zebrafish brain atlas by Wullimann and colleagues
[25]. In these cases where we use the names of the ana-

of the named anatomical structures.
Telencephalon
The most anterior expression of nestin we could detect was
a weak staining in the posterior part of the olfactory bulb
(OB). Here nestin is expressed only in the ventral parts of
the TC (V: ventral telencephalic area). Few nestin positive
cells are detectable in the dorsal nucleus of the ventral telPage 5 of 11

encephalic area (Vd) close to the telencephalic ventricle
(TelV) (Fig. 6A). Throughout the TC nestin positive cells
accumulate in the SVZ of Vd and Vv (ventral nucleus of V).
Anterior to the anterior commissure (AC) nestin is
strongly expressed in cells of the Vv and Vd, up to 5–10
cell diameters away from the ventricle surface (Fig. 6B).
The expression is slightly reduced in the more posterior
parts of the TC at the level of the AC. nestin is weakly
expressed in the supracommissural and postcommissural
nuclei (data not shown).
We also detected a weak expression of nestin in the ventral
parts of the anterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPa)
(data not shown). At the level of the telencephalo-diencephalic boundary (preoptic region) nestin expression
extends dorsally and is broadly expressed along the most
anterior part of the diencephalic ventricle (DiV) in the
area of ventral habenular nucleus (HaV), thalamic nuclei
(TN), in the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus
(PPp), and ventral periventricular hypothalamus (Hv)
(Fig. 6C).
Diencephalon
nestin is expressed all along the subventricular zone of the
DiV. In the region of the optic tract (OT) speckled nestin
expression was visible, which might be glia precursor cells
migrating along the optic tract (Fig. 6D). Dorsally nestin
is expressed in distinct ventricular zones: the ventral
habenular nucleus (Hav), the periventricular pretectal
nucleus (PP), the thalamic nuclei (TN) including the dorsal thalamic nucleus (DT) and the ventromedial thalamic
nucleus (VM) (Fig. 6C,D). In the ventral DC nestin positive cells are detected in the region of the periventricular
nucleus of the posterior tuberculum (TPp) and the posterior tuberal nucleus (PTN) (Fig. 6D,E). Strong nestin
expression is detected in the cells adjacent to the lateral
recess (LR) of the DiV in the area of the dorsal zone of the
periventricular hypothalamus (Hd) (Fig. 6E,F) throughout its entire anterior-posterior extend (Fig. 6E–I). In the
more posterior part of the ventral DC nestin expression is
expressed at lower levels in the TPp and stronger in the
ventral zone of the periventricular hypothalamus (Hv)
(Fig. 6F,G). In cells adjacent to the DiV nestin expression
is also detectable in the most ventroposterior part of the
DC, in the region of the caudal hypothalamus (Hc) (Fig.
6H).
Mesencephalon
nestin is expressed in two zones of mesencepalon: in the
optic tectum (TeO) and the torus longitudinalis (TL),
which is ventrally attached to the tectum and reaches from
its anterior to its posterior end [18] (Fig. 6E–G). nestin
positive cells are located at the ventricle-contacting surface
of the torus longitudinalis along its entire anterior-posterior extension in the mesencephalon (Fig. 6E–G). Further,

in the TeO cells of the ventricle contacting part of the
periventricular gray zone (PGZ), express nestin mRNA in a
relatively homogeneous manner around the ventricle. The
expression domain spans the entire rostro-caudal axis of
the PGZ. The more superficial layers of the TeO and the
parts of the PGZ not contacting the ventricle do not
express nestin. nestin is also strongly expressed in the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) and the nucleus lateralis valvulae (NLV), two ventricle contacting structures of more
ventral parts of the mesencephalon (Fig. 6H). In the most
rostral part of the superior reticular formation, which also
belongs to the mesencephalon, nestin expressing cells can
be detected in a scattered manner (Fig. 6J).
Hindbrain and midbrain hindbrain boundary (MHB)
In teleosts the cerebellum can be subdivided in three parts
[16,25]: The corpus cerebelli (CCe), the vestibulolateralis
lobe (consists of the medial caudal lobe (LCa) and the
eminentiae granulares (EG) and the valvula cerebelli pars
medialis and pars lateralis (Vam/Val). The midbrain hindbrain boundary (MHB) is known as a zone of continuous
neurogenesis in the developing as well as in the mature
brain. The MHB in the post-embryonic brain also contains nestin expressing cells. In the anterior part of the cerebellum nestin is strongly expressed along the midline,
mainly in the molecular layer, the granular layer seems to
be devoid of nestin expression cells. (Fig. 6H,I). nestin
expressing cells can be found in both, medial and lateral,
parts of the valvula. In the Val we could detect strong nestin expression in ventricle contacting regions. In the
medial part of the valvula cerebelli (Vam) nestin is
strongly expressed in the molecular as well as in the granular layer close to the tectal ventricle (Fig. 6G–I). In the
eminentiae granulares nestin expressing cells are detectable. In the HB like in other parts of the brain, nestin
expressing cells are located in the SVZ of the rhombencephalic ventricle. Here strong expression is detected in
the ventricle contacting part of the caudal lobe of the cerebellum (LCa) (Fig. 6J–L). Further, in the HB more widely
distributed nestin positive cell groups, e.g. in the granular
and molecular layer of the caudal lobe, are detectable
compared to the more anterior parts of the brain (Fig. 6J–
L).
Cranial Ganglia Nerves
In the post-embryonic brain as well as in the embryonic
brain, nestin is expressed in the nuclei of cranial nerves.
High expression of nestin is detected in the nucleus of the
third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve; NIII) (Fig. 6H).
The axon-containing tract of the medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF), which carries axons descending to the spinal
cord, is devoid of nestin expression throughout its rostrocaudal extend (Fig. 6H–L), as well as in the nucleus of the
trochlear nerve (nervus trochlearis, IV) (Fig. 6I). Surprisingly, in the area of cranial nerves, which have already left

the brain stem, we detected strong nestin expression. Analysis at higher resolution revealed that nestin is not
expressed in the fascicles themselves but in clusters of
cells, which appear to accompany the nerves. This was
observed for the fascial nerve (n. fascialis, VII) as well as
for the octaval nerve (n. octavus, VIII) and the associated
anterior lateral line nerve (ALLN), and led us to speculate
that these cells might be glia or migrating glia precursors,
similar to findings in mammalian systems [26] (Fig.
6G,J,K,L).

Discussion and Conclusion
In mammals the intermediate neurofilament Nestin is a
well established marker for neuronal stem cells and proliferating precursor cell populations, as well as for precursor cell populations in some other tissues (reviewed in
[5]). Previously, nestin expression has only been characterized in mammalian systems [2,10,11], and chick [12].
However, while a gene prediction for a zebrafish nestin has
been placed by ENSEMBL on linkage group 16 at 27.11
Mb, until now it has not been demonstrated that this
intermediate filament represents a true nestin ortholog in
teleosts. Here we provide two lines of evidence that this
zebrafish intermediate filament is the true nestin ortholog:
(1) Zebrafish Nestin protein sequence clusters with higher
vertebrate Nestin proteins, and is clearly separated from
other vertebrate intermediate neurofilaments, based on
phylogenetic tree analysis. (2) nestin is expressed at
embryonic, larval, and juvenile stages in cell populations
which in the CNS largely represent stem and precursor
cells. Subsets of nestin positive cells co-express the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA – zebrafish nestin
expression thus correlates with the expression pattern
described in mouse [4].
We found that outside of the nervous system nestin is
expressed in mesodermal muscle precursor cells and in
craniofacial mesenchyme. This correlates with nestin
expression in mammals at comparable developmental
stages, which has been reported for head mesenchyme
and muscle precursors [6]. In contrast to the reported nestin expression in mouse, we could not detect nestin expression neither in developing somites nor in the myotome of
more mature somites at any stage. Our analysis was
focused on nestin expression in the nervous system, and
therefore we did not test whether there may be correlates
to nestin expression reported in mammalian epidermis,
heart, pancreas, kidney, and lung (reviewed in [5]).
During late somitogenesis stages zebrafish nestin is widely
expressed throughout the developing nervous system. A
similar widespread expression has been reported for comparable stages of mouse development where nestin expression and protein distribution were investigated by in situ
hybridization and immunohistochemistry [1,3]. Further,

the comparison of zebrafish nestin expression with GFP
expression in nestin promoter-GFP transgenic mice,
which has been described in great detail [4,27,28],
strengthens the notion of evolutionary conserved roles of
Nestin in stem and precursor cell development. With progressive development of the nervous system in zebrafish,
like in mouse, nestin expression becomes gradually
restricted to regions of the CNS which have previously
been identified as zones of proliferating stem and precursor cells: the ventricle walls in the CNS, the ciliary marginal zone in the retina and some scattered cells in the
medulla oblongata [16-18].
In the peripheral nervous system nestin is strongly
expressed in cells associated with the octaval ganglion, the
lateral line ganglia, the facial and trigeminal ganglia, and
the ganglia of the nervous vagus. It has been reported for
mice that nestin in the PNS is expressed in astrocytes associated with neurons of the cranial ganglia [26], therefore
it is likely that the nestin expressing cells associated with
zebrafish ganglia are also glia.
The zebrafish brain grows throughout post-embryonic
stages as well as in mature adult fish. To analyze nestin
expression in the maturing post-embryonic and post-larval brain, we studied the brain of four weeks old zebrafish.
In the maturing nervous system nestin expression was
detected in all areas, which were recently described as
stem cell niches and zones of proliferating precursor cells
[18]. In the forebrain, these are: the ventricular zones of
the tel- and diencephalon, the ventral habenular nucleus
(Hav), the periventricular pretectal nucleus (PP), the thalamic nuclei (TN) including the dorsal thalamic nucleus
(DT), and the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM). In the
mid- and hindbrain, these are: the mesencephalic areas of
the torus longitudinalis and optic tectum adjacent to the
ventricle, the MHB, proliferative zones in the cerebellum,
and ventricular zones of the hindbrain and the spinal
cord. In summary, nestin expression in the maturing, postembryonic CNS correlates with the previously described
proliferation zones [16-18]. Thus, the expression of the
intermediated neurofilament nestin in zebrafish, like in
mammals, may serve as a marker for stem cells and proliferating precursors in the developing embryonic nervous
system as well as in the adult brain.

Methods
Fish
Zebrafish (AB strain) breeding and maintenance was
under standard conditions at 28.5°C [29]. Zebrafish
embryos (AB strain) were staged and fixed at the desired
developmental stages according to Kimmel et al. [30]. To
inhibit pigmentation embryos were incubated in 0,2 mM
phenylthiourea (Sigma).

In situ hybridization and histological sections
Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was performed as described [31]. A Digoxigenin-labeled antisense mRNA probe for nestin was used. For generation of
the nestin probe we amplified a fragment from genomic
DNA with primers 5' nes_1F: GTACCAGATGCTAGAGCTGAACCACCGCCTTG; 3' nes_1R: GCATCTGCCTCTTGATCCTCGTGCTCTCCAG. These primers amplify a 704
bp fragment of the second exon of the nestin gene
(ENSEMBL gene prediction ENSDAR00000040236),
which we cloned it into the pBSII-KS vector. For sectioning, embryos were embedded in a mix of 0,5% gelatin,
30% bovine serum albumin, and 20% saccharose dissolved in PBS. Polymerization was initiated by adding 70
µl of 25% glutaraldehyde per 1 ml, the embryos were oriented, and polymerization completed by addition of
another 70 µl of 25% glutaraldehyde. Blocks were
mounted with glycergel, and 50 µm sections were prepared with a Leica Vibratome.

Double fluorescent whole-mount in situ hybridization
(FISH) for nestin and pcna was performed modified from
[32,33], which were adapted to zebrafish (Alida Filippi
and Wolfgang Driever, unpublished, and (30)). Confocal
images were recorded with a Zeiss LSM 5 DUO laser-scanning confocal microscope.
For analysis of nestin expression in the brain of 28 dpf fish,
animals were anesthetized with tricaine before they were
killed in ice water. The brain was dissected out and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS/0,1 % Triton X-100 over
night at 4°C. In situ hybridization was performed as
reported for whole mount 24 hpf zebrafish embryos [31].
After the staining, brains were embedded in 3% agarose/
PBS and serial sections (50 µm) generated using a
vibratome.
