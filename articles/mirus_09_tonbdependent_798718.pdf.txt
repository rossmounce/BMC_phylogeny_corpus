Abstract
Background: Different iron transport systems evolved in Gram-negative bacteria during
evolution. Most of the transport systems depend on outer membrane localized TonB-dependent
transporters (TBDTs), a periplasma-facing TonB protein and a plasma membrane localized
machinery (ExbBD). So far, iron chelators (siderophores), oligosaccharides and polypeptides have
been identified as substrates of TBDTs. For iron transport, three uptake systems are defined: the
lactoferrin/transferrin binding proteins, the porphyrin-dependent transporters and the
siderophore-dependent transporters. However, for cyanobacteria almost nothing is known about
possible TonB-dependent uptake systems for iron or other substrates.
Results: We have screened all publicly available eubacterial genomes for sequences representing
(putative) TBDTs. Based on sequence similarity, we identified 195 clusters, where elements of one
cluster may possibly recognize similar substrates. For Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 we identified 22
genes as putative TBDTs covering almost all known TBDT subclasses. This is a high number of
TBDTs compared to other cyanobacteria. The expression of the 22 putative TBDTs individually
depends on the presence of iron, copper or nitrogen.
Conclusion: We exemplified on TBDTs the power of CLANS-based classification, which
demonstrates its importance for future application in systems biology. In addition, the tentative
substrate assignment based on characterized proteins will stimulate the research of TBDTs in
different species. For cyanobacteria, the atypical dependence of TBDT gene expression on different
nutrition points to a yet unknown regulatory mechanism. In addition, we were able to clarify a
hypothesis of the absence of TonB in cyanobacteria by the identification of according sequences.

Background
Filamentous cyanobacteria contain molecular machines
for oxygenic photosynthesis under all growth conditions

[1]. These machines, as well as those involved in respiration and nitrogen metabolism, depend on non-proteinaceous cofactors such as iron [2,3]. The level of iron found

in cyanobacteria is generally one order of magnitude
higher than in non-photosynthetic bacteria [4] and represents about 0.1% of their biomass [5]. Even though iron
and copper are required for the function of respiratory
and photosynthetic complexes, their intracellular level
has to be tightly controlled as these ions pose a risk of oxidation [3]. Therefore, the uptake of iron is highly regulated in order to avoid intoxication. On the other hand, it
is hypothesized that iron limitation might have been one
of the selective forces in the evolution of cyanobacteria
[6], and one might speculate that those cyanobacteria
with the most efficient iron uptake systems might have
had an evolutionary advantage. To enhance iron uptake,
eubacteria secrete low-molecular-weight iron chelators
(siderophores) under iron-limiting conditions to complex
environmental iron [7]. The siderophore-iron complexes
are bound by receptor proteins (TonB-dependent transporters, TBDTs) in the outer membrane which are composed of a transmembrane -barrel domain, a so-called
plug domain and a periplasmic exposed TonB box. The
siderophore-iron is subsequently transferred to the cytoplasm by transport proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane
[8,9]. This process is dependent on TonB which provides
the energy required for the translocation of siderophoreiron complexes across the outer membrane [10]. In order
to facilitate this translocation, the periplasmic domain of
TonB interacts with the TonB box of the loaded TBDT. It
is proposed that TonB exerts a pulling force on the TonB
box and, thereby, partially unfolds the plug domain enabling the translocation of the siderophore into the periplasmic space [11]. Several TBDTs have been identified.
Beside the ones for iron transport [12,13], TBDTs for
nickel [14], disaccharides (for sucrose SuxA; [15], for maltose MalA; [16]), oligo- (CsuF; [17]), polysaccharides
(SusC; [18]) or large degradation products of proteins
(RagA; [19]) are described. The most intensively studied
function of TBDTs is the iron uptake in Gram-negative
bacteria. Three large classes are defined, namely transferrin-/lactoferrin-binding
proteins,
porphyrin
and
siderophore transporters [20]. In addition to the transport
of iron across the outer membrane by TBDTs, an additional ferric iron uptake system is postulated, but the corresponding outer membrane receptor has not yet been
identified [21]. The TBDTs TbpA (transferring-binding
protein A) and LbpA (lactoferrin-binding protein A) facilitate the uptake of iron from transferrin/lactoferrin,
respectively; the uptake is also assisted by the lipoproteins
TbpB and LbpB which face the extracellular side [22]. The
porphyrin-transporting TBDTs include HasR, HgbA,
HmbR (heme; [12,22]) and BtuB which transports the
cobalt-complexing vitamin B12 (cobalamin [23]). Heme
uptake is especially important in bacterial pathogens,
where various heme-containing compounds are utilized
[13]. The siderophore TBDTs are further sub-classified
according to their substrate - that is the chemical nature of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/68

the siderophore they bind. Siderophores belong inter alia
to hydroxamates, catecholates, phenolates, citrates or
combinations thereof [9]. For example, the siderophore
transporters FepA, ViuA and IroN recognize catecholates,
FhuA, FoxA and FhuE hydroxamate and FecA citrate.
The iron uptake system in cyanobacteria is not well understood. For the non-filamentous cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the TBDTs encoded by sll1206,
sll1406, sll1409 and slr1490 were partially characterized
[24,25]. For filamentous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena
sp. PCC 7120 (also termed Nostoc sp. PCC 7120) only
siderophore secretion [26-28], and the influence of
enhanced or reduced iron levels on the growth [29-32],
were investigated. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 secretes the
hydroxamate-type siderophore schizokinen, allegedly the
only siderophore secreted [26,27]. Only recently, a TBDT
encoded by schT (alr0397) involved in the uptake of
schizokinen was identified. The expression of the gene
schT (alr0397) was mildly increased under a shortage of
Fe3+. A schT knock-out mutant showed a moderate phenotype of iron starvation, and the characterization of its
siderophore-dependent iron uptake demonstrated the
function of schT as a TonB-dependent schizokinen transporter [33].
To learn more about iron transport systems in general and
in cyanobacteria particularly we searched for genes coding
for TBDTs based on previously experimentally characterized TBDTs. Subsequently, we assigned putative substrates
for so far uncharacterized TBDTs, according to their
sequence similarity to already known TBDTs. We
observed a substantial difference in the number of TBDT
genes in the analysed cyanobacteria. The expression pattern of the TBDT genes in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is analysed with respect to iron, copper and nitrogen
availability.

Results and discussion
Classification of TonB-dependent transporters
Ninety-eight TBDTs and the (putative) substrates (for
example, metallophores or sugars) were extracted from
the published literature (see Additional file 1) [1419,22,34-124]. In order to classify the TBDTs with
unknown substrates, we first searched for putative TBDTs
in 686 sequenced genomes. We identified 4600 putative
TBDTs in 347 species (see Additional file 2). Compared to
previously published bioinformatic analyses [15,125], we
identified fewer sequences in the species which had been
analysed in the past due to a more stringent cutoff (not
shown). More specifically, within the species analysed by
Koebnik, we selected seven sequences not previously
identified, but did not consider 103 sequences [125]. A
similar ratio was found when analysing the number of
sequences selected by us from the species analysed by

sequences which resulted in a discrepancy of about 5%.

late) transporter (sequence 40, cluster 40) occurs in region
II.

We subsequently performed a cluster analysis of the identified sequences of putative TBDTs (see Methods) leading
to 195 clusters with at least two sequences. Figure 1A
shows the consensus tree used to highlight 'regions' on
the two-dimensional sequence landscape. A region is
marked by roman numerals if the substrate for at least one
TBDT in this region is experimentally verified (expTBDTs)
or predicted (pTBDTs), and marked by upper case letters
if no substrate TBDT in the region is known (Figure 1).
Figure 1B shows the expTBDT regions I-VII, XI, XII and
XIII and the pTBDTs regions VIII, IX and X together with
the uncharacterized regions A-N. Figure 2 shows an
enlarged version of the dashed rectangle in Figure 1B. The
colours describe the substrate that binds to the corresponding TBDTs. Figure 2 (bottom) shows a magnification of the expTBDTs regions, where the numbers refer to
sequences with a known substrate (Additional file 1, [1419,22,34-124]). In the following, we characterize the
regions according to the 98 TBDTs that have been experimentally verified or predicted (Additional file 1, [1419,22,34-124]).

Region III
Cluster 10 is defined by sequences of the aerobactin/
rhizobactin (Citrate-hydroxamate; see Additional file 1,
[14-19,22,34-124]) transporters IutA and RhtA (sequence
41 and 42).

Region I
This consists of 19 clusters with at least five sequences and
10 of them have assigned functions which include porphyrin, lacto-/transferrin and nickel transporters (Figure
2). Cluster 11 contains the sequence of the copper chelate
binding protein OprC (sequence 1, for references see
Additional file 1, [14-19,22,34-124]). A group of clusters
(15, 17, 18, 59, 86 and 107; sequences 11-28) are comprised of heme-transporting (HmbR) proteins. Remarkably, the two enterobactin (catecholate; see Additional file
1, [14-19,22,34-124]) transporters VctA (cluster 59;
sequence 28) and FetA (cluster 15; sequence 27) are
located within the porphyrin group. This finding corroborates the observation that VctA and FetA are, supposedly,
involved in transporting porphyrin [126,127]. In cluster
16, the LbpA or TbpA proteins are found (sequences 29,
30). There is also a small cluster (112) which contains
nickel-transporting TBDTs with a single expTBDT
(sequence 31, FrpB4).
Region II
This contains 20 clusters, three of them represented by
expTBDTs (cluster 4, 12, 40). In cluster 4 the experimentally confirmed cobalt-complexing vitamin B12 transporter BtuB (sequence 32) is present. However, in the
same cluster, and in clusters 160 and 165, predicted BtuBs
were identified (sequences 33-39). Cluster 12 contains
IrgA, BfrA or IroN sequences (No. 2-10) transporting
enterobactin, DHBS (catecholate) or salmochelin (glycosylated catecholate). In addition, a myxochelin (catecho-

Region IV
The largest cluster in region IV (No. 82) contains the
sequences of the ferric rhizoferrin (carboxylate) transporter RumA and the diferric dicitrate transporter FecA
(sequences 44 and 45).
Region V (sequences 46-71)
This consists of nine clusters with three (clusters 0, 6, 7) of
them containing expTBDTs and two pTBDTs (clusters 9,
25). This region mainly contains transporters for hydroxamate-type siderophores, such as desferrioxamine
(hydroxamate; cluster 0, sequences 50, 51, 56), ferrichrome (hydroxamate; cluster 0, sequence 55), pseudobactin A (citrate-catecholate-hydroxamate; cluster 6,
sequences 62, 63), pyochelin (phenolate; cluster 6,
sequence 66), or anguibactin (catecholate-hydroxamate;
cluster 7, sequences 69-71). Interestingly, the proteins for
which sequences are found in cluster 9 (sequence 67, 68)
are predicted to transport thiamin, whereas proteins 46
and 47 (cluster 25) are predicted to transport vitamin B12.
The latter appears to be a false prediction as judged from
the large distance to cluster 4 containing the experimentally confirmed BtuB. Setting an even lower P-value (1E100 instead of 1E-90) as the threshold for defining the
clusters in CLANS leads to cluster 0 splitting up in the
upper part with all hydroxamate-type TBDTs (including
all cyanobacterial TBDTs of cluster 0) and the lower part
containing phenolate-transporting TBDTs and VciA,
which has been shown to transport neither heme, vibriobactin, enterobactin, ferrioxamine B, aerobactin nor
shizokinen [77].
Region VI
This region represents transporters for phenolates, catecholates or hexylsulfate and contains several clusters. A
hexylsulfate transporting TBDT (sequence 77) can be
found in cluster 45, a vibriobactin (catecholate) transporter (sequence 74) in cluster 140 and proteins transporting yersiniabactin (phenolate; sequences 72, 73) in
cluster 79. As already observed in region V, we also
detected two sequences (75, 76) in cluster 118 that are
putative thiamin transporters.
Region VII (cluster 67)
Cluster 67 contains SuxA (sequence 78), an experimentally verified sucrose transporter. Please note, that

Clustering(seethe sequences of putative TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs)
Clustering of the sequences of putative TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs). The sequences found by the
described genome-wide searches were analysed by CLANs as depicted. (A) shows the consensus tree of the pair-wise mean
cluster distances. The branches are coloured according to their respective bootstrap value in shades of grey as indicated by the
legend in the middle of the tree. The numbers at each leaf are of the format 'x_y', where 'x' is the cluster number and 'y' the
number of sequences belonging to this cluster. We have further indicated the transported substrates and the regions as shown
in Figure 1B are marked by I to XII and A to N. Brackets indicate that the metal ion is known, but the metallophore has not yet
been identified. An asterisk marks predicted substrates. (B) shows the result of two-dimensional clustering in CLANS. The
regions from Figure 1A are marked by red polygons (containing at least a single exp/pTBDT) and red circles (no functionally
characterized TBDT). Sequences with a high similarity (P-value < 10-90) are connected by lines coloured in shades of grey (the
darker the smaller the P-value). The regions shown in Figure 2 (grey dashed line) and Figure 3 (grey dashed-dotted line) are
highlighted.

sequence 79 has been predicted to transport sucrose [15].
The prediction was based on the co-localization of the
corresponding gene with the transcriptional regulator
ScrR. Thus, our bioinformatic analysis provides additional
evidence for the functional characterization.
Region VIII (cluster 52)
This region contains predicted nickel and cobalt TBDTs
with unknown metallophore specificity and no representative of the expTBDTs.
Region IX
This consists of eight sequences in one cluster (No. 32),
where two of the eight are putative thiamin transporters.
However, proteins assigned as thiamin transporters were
also found in regions V (sequences 67, 68, cluster 7) and
VI (sequences 75 and 76, cluster 118). Their genes are colocalized on the genome with a cytoplasmic membrane
transporter for thiamin (PnuT, [128]), however, the functional assignment remains to be proven.
Region X
This contains a TBDT predicted to transport cobalt-complexing vitamin B12 (sequence 43, cluster 166). However,
it is far away from the BtuB cluster in region II (Figure 2).
Hence, the assigned function should be experimentally
confirmed.
Region XI
The region is clearly separated from the rest and contains
cluster 26. The experimentally characterized TBDTs
include oligosaccharide (CsuF, sequence 88), polysaccharide transporters (SusC, sequence 87) and transporters for
degradation products of proteins (RagA, sequences 8586). While many taxa are represented by sequences in the
region I-X, region XI consists almost exclusively of bacteroidetes with the exception of one -proteobacterial
sequence (gi|108757959, Myxococcus xanthus). Thus,
sequences in this region may indicate a special adaptation
of these organisms, which may be due to their lifestyle.
Bacteroidetes are involved in food digestion in the intesti-

nal tract of mammals. Hence a specific TBDT class for the
uptake of substrates provided by the host seems plausible.
Region XII
This also appears as an outlier (Figure 2). It contains eight
clusters (35, 62, 63, 72, 76, 88, 187 and 188) and only
one expTBDT MalA (sequence 90, cluster 63) that transports maltodextrin. Seven pTBDTs are said to transport
xylan, pectin or chito-oligosaccharides (No. 91-97; for references see Additional file 1, [14-19,22,34-124]), where
sequences 91-96 belong to cluster 63 and sequence 97 to
cluster 72. It appears that this region is composed of diand oligosaccharide transporters. In line with this notion,
the -proteobacterial TBDTs are from Myxobacteria
(Myxococcus xanthus, Sorangium cellulosum), which are
found on decaying plant material consuming their saccharides. Most of the sequences in this region stem from and -proteobacteria (18.4%, 76%) and a few bacteroidetes, - and -proteobacteria taxa.
Region XIII
Positioned between region XI and the crowded area on the
right side, this region is defined by a fibronectin-binding
TBDT (sequence 98, cluster 41). As in most of the
sequences in region XI, the sequences of this region consist almost exclusively of bacteroidetes. The close proximity of regions XI and XIII is consistent with the observed
interaction of the TBDT with a glycoprotein.
Other regions
For regions I to XIII we were in the lucky position of being
able to infer at least putative functions to ~3700
sequences. (The putative annotation can be viewed at
http://www.cibiv.at/TBDT.) However, from the 4600
sequences from GenBank ~900 sequences remain in
regions A-N, where we were unable to assign any function
(Figure 1). While we cannot discuss potential substrates
for clusters in regions A-N, we can at least point to some
regions that show a peculiar taxonomic composition. In
regions A and B sequences from mostly - (74%) and proteobacteria (19%), but also a few -proteobacterial

contains exclusively -proteobacterial sequences.
Classification of TonB-dependent transporters in
cyanobacteria
One of our aims was the identification and classification
of cyanobacterial TBDTs. Hence we searched for
sequences of putative TBDTs in 32 cyanobacterial

genomes (proteins listed according to their accession code
(Table 1, column 1). We additionally extracted the automated annotation from GenBank (Table 1, column 2). At
present, this annotation is mostly limited to CirA, FhuE or
BtuB. Hence, we analysed the location of cyanobacterial
sequences on the CLANS plot (Figure 3 shows the section
of Figure 1B indicated by a grey box). All cyanobacterial
TBDTs belong to regions with experimentally character-

ized TBDTs (see Figure 2 and dashed frames in Figure 3).
To further confirm the classification determined with
CLANS we also constructed a phylogenetic tree for the
cyanobacterial sequences (Figure 4). Seven 'subtrees' (a-f)
were identified and mapped to regions I-X.

are also close to cluster 118, which contains putative thiamin transporters. Nevertheless, since the two putative thiamin transporters have not yet been experimentally
confirmed, we consider these cyanobacterial TBDTs to be
iron transporters of the ViuA-type.

The six sequences in subtree 'a' belong to region I (Figure
3, 4) and show a relation to heme transporters such as
HutA (Figures 1, 2, sequence 13). The sequences are found
in Synechococcus sp., Acaryochloris marina and Anabaena sp.
PCC 7120 (see new assignment in Table 1, column 3).
Subtrees 'b' and 'c' contain only sequences from Gloeobacter violaceus. Subtree 'b' is within region I and is equidistant to enterobactin and heme transporters. Thereby, a
clear assignment to a characterized TBDT family appears
currently impossible. Subtree 'd' is close to the BtuB transporter cluster (region II) (Figure 1). In this region we find
sequences from most of the analysed cyanobacteria (8 of
12), suggesting that transporters with similarity to BtuB
are common. Subtree 'e' (Figure 3, 4) represents transporters, which can clearly be assigned as specific for aerobactin/rhizobactin (IutA-/RhtA-type). Subtree 'f' represents
sequences of transporters with the closest relation to
FhuA-type transporters of cluster 0. The sequences of subtree 'g' (cluster 1), closely related to ViuA, are probably
transporters for catecholates. The sequences of subtree 'g'

Summarizing, the assignment of the cyanobacterial
TBDTs to regions with functional characterization was
successful with the exception of some TBDTs from Gloeobacter violaceus (subtrees 'b' and 'c'). Although BtuB-like
transporters and hydroxamate-type metallophore transporters were found in cyanobacteria, we did not find FecAtype (diferric dicitrate) TBDTs, even though they occur in
-, -, -, - and -proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and spirochaetes.
Identification of TBDTs in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120
In order to explore the cyanobacterial TBDTs in more
detail we analysed the full genome of Anabaena sp. PCC
7120. We identified 21 TBDT genes carrying the plug
domain and -barrel domain characteristic for TBDTs. In
addition, we identified four genes (all2620, alr2179,
all2578, alr4028) containing the plug domain of the
TBDT, but an incomplete -barrel domain. Downstream
of all2620 (Figure 5A) and alr4028 (Figure 5B) a gene coding for the 'missing part' of the -barrel domain is present

(all2619 and alr4029, respectively). Consequently, we
checked the stop codon separating the two gene pairs. We
confirmed the stop codon between all2620 and all2619
(Figure 5A) and could not identify a frame shift in the
sequence of the region 500 bp upstream or downstream
of the stop codon. If All2620 is, indeed, part of a TBDT it
has to form a heterodimer. A putative interaction partner
would be All2619. It would, therefore, be interesting to
investigate the existence of such complex and to understand whether it is just a remnant of a genetic accident
which led to a split of the TBDT gene in all2620 and
all2619. In contrast to all2620 and all2619, for alr4028
and alr4029 we found a T to C exchange in the sequence
when comparing our results with that of the deposited
sequence. Hence, we conclude that the stop codon does
not exist and that the two genes alr4028 and alr4029
encode one protein. Therefore, 22 TBDTs exist in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.
For 19 TBDTs the genomic organization suggests the integration of the gene in an operon (Figure 5C). Twelve
TBDTs are directly positioned behind a gene coding for a
(putative) transcriptional regulator (Figure 5C, violet),
and most of the (putative) operon structures contain
genes coding for proteins involved in iron transport. The
gene coding for a ViuA-type transporter is in a putative
operon with subunits of a cytochrome D ubiquinol oxidase, which is rather unexpected, because, to date, a rela-

tion between this oxidase and iron transport has not been
reported (Figure 5C). Of the BtuB transporters one is a single gene (all3310), whereas the other (the gene which we
confirmed and which is still annotated as alr4028/
alr4029) is in a rather typical genomic environment,
namely in front of three genes encoding the periplasmic
and the plasma membrane localized iron transport
machinery. The same holds true for the hutA-like gene
alr3242. The other hutA-like gene (alr2153) is in a putative
operon with a gene encoding a tetracenomycin C synthesis protein and a gene of unknown function. Again, the
relation between the TBDT and the downstream genes are
rather questionable.
Three genes are classified as iutA-like. alr0397 (schT) is single standing in the genome. Downstream of alr2581 we
found two genes coding for an unknown protein and a
dicitrate binding protein, respectively. Alr2209 is a component of a large genomic region (~14 kbp, alr2208alr2215) containing upstream a transcription regulator
and downstream a cluster with three genes coding for
periplasmic dicitrate binding proteins and one fhuA-like
gene (alr2211). Thirteen of the 14 fhuA-like genes are
upstream of a gene coding for a protein annotated as dicitrate-binding. However, most of the genes found in the
putative operons defined by the 14 fhuA-like genes encode
for proteins of unknown function. Three of the fhuA-like
genes (alr2588, alr2592, alr2596) are in the same chromo-

Iron-dependent expression of TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120

sp. PCC 7120 were grown in media with (lane 1, 2, 5 and 6) and without a source of ferric ammonium citrate and copper (-Fe/
-Cu, lane 3, 4, 7 and 8) as well as with (BG11, lane 1-4) and without a source of nitrogen (BG110, lane 5-8). RNA was isolated
and RT-PCR was performed to visualize expression with (+) and without (-) addition of reverse transcriptase using primers
listed in Table 3. The transcript of rnpB was amplified as control. (B)Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 were grown in media with (BG11,
lane 1, 2) or without nitrogen source (BG110, lane 3, 4) in the absence of either copper sulfate (lane 1, 3) or ferric ammonium
citrate (lane 2, 4) and RNA isolated from 50 ml cells of log phase cultures as described. RT-PCR was performed to visualize
expression with and without addition of reverse transcriptase using primers listed in Table 3. (C) The results from A and B are
visualized as bar code where black stands for detected expression, and white for no expression detected under conditions
used. The order is given on the right (C stands for: pointing to the centre). The black outer circle marks all genes expressed in
BG110, the black dashed line all genes expressed in BG11, the black dashed dotted line all genes not expressed without starvation and the dotted line the gene only weakly expressed upon copper limitation in BG11. The grey line on the outer rim indicates all genes always expressed, the grey dashed line on the outer rim all genes where expression was not detected under one
condition and the grey dashed dotted line on the outer rim all genes which are expressed in BG11 and BG110, but not in all
other media.

somal region. Upstream of these, a gene coding a transcription regulator and downstream a gene encoding a
dicitrate binding protein are found. However, the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4) argues against recent gene
duplication.
Variations of the number of genes encoding TBDTs in
cyanobacteria
The results presented in Figures 3, 4, 5 and Table 1 show
that the number of TBDTs varies among cyanobacteria.
We found 22 TBDTs in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, 10 in Anabaena variabilis, six in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, four in
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, 33 in Gloeobacter violaceus, but
no TBDTs in the genomes of, for example, Prochlorococcus). This variation of the number of genes, however, does
not reflect an elevated amount of outer membrane protein
coding genes in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, because such a
variation is not found for other outer membrane proteins
(Omp85, TolC, OstA and others; not shown). Furthermore, in a previous report, a correlation of the number of
TBDTs to the number of open reading frames as, for example, for transporters in the cytoplasmic membrane [129]
was not observed [128], which is supported by our analysis (not shown).

TBDTs are regulated by TonB proteins. Hence, the large
number of TBDTs leads to the question of whether each
TBDT is regulated individually or (at least a sub-population of the TBDTs) in concert by one TonB protein. We,
therefore, screened the genomes for the presence of tonB
(Table 2). One to three tonB genes were detected. Hence,
the number of TBDTs largely exceeds the number of TonB
proteins. Please note that we identified a TonB-like protein (Slr1484) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which corrects a previous statement excluding the presence of a
TonB-like protein in this species [130].

Expression of genes in Anabaena sp. coding for TBDTs
We analysed the gene expression of the 22 TDBT genes
and of all2620, which only codes for the N-terminal portion of a TBDT (Figure 5A) in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (Figure 6). To this end, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was grown in
normal medium (BG11), medium without iron (BG11Fe), medium without copper (BG11-Cu) or medium lacking both (BG11-Fe-Cu). The presence of transcript was then
determined by non-quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; primers are listed in
Table 3). Iron and copper were chosen, because iron is
known to be involved in the regulation of the gene expression of TBDTs and copper was recently found to induce an
expression of a gene cluster involved in siderophore synthesis [131]. Remarkably, 13 TBDT-gene transcripts were
present under normal growth conditions in such amounts
that they could be amplified and visualized by RT-PCR
(Figure 6A, lane 2; Figure 6C, grey lines and black dashed
line). It should be noted that the absence of a transcript
for the other genes might only reflect low transcript abundance. For 19 genes, we detected transcripts under Fe
minus or/Cu minus conditions (Figure 6A lane 4, 6B, lane
1, 2). The analysis of the detection pattern revealed the
following: (1) the genes all2148 and all2236, both hydroxamate-type TBDTs, were down-regulated upon iron and/
or copper starvation compared to transcript levels under
normal conditions; (2) the expression of seven genes
(iutA-like genes alr2209 and alr2581, the btuB-like gene
alr4028, the hutA-like gene alr3242 and the fhuA-like
genes all2674, all4924 and alr2592) not detected under
normal growth conditions is increased in response to copper, but not iron, limitation in the BG11 medium (Figure
6B, lane 1). This is notable, because, for four of these
seven genes, the expression in the absence of one metalion (either Cu or Fe) is higher than in the absence of both
iron and copper. One viuA-like gene (all4026) is expressed
at a low level in BG11, but not in BG11 deficient of iron.

An exclusive dependence of (upregulation of) expression
in BG11 medium on iron limitation was only observed
for alr0397 (iutA-like) and all2610 (fhuA-like).
Finally, we investigated the expression pattern of TDBTs
under conditions enforcing heterocyst formation by
growth in medium without a nitrogen source (BG110).
We again analysed the amount of transcript in the four
different media. Strikingly, in BG110 medium 17 genes are
expressed (Figure 6A, lane 6, Figure 6C, black hemicircle)
but seven of them are not expressed in BG11. Moreover,

we found four genes - alr2153 and alr3242 (hutAlike),alr2626 and alr2185 (fhuA-like) - for which a transcript was detected only under additional metal starvation
(BG110 -Fe, -Cu or -Fe/-Cu). Remarkably, all2620 is
expressed under all conditions without a nitrogen source,
which suggests that all2620 is not a pseudogene. In general, one can conclude that not only metal starvation but
also nitrogen starvation induces transcription of TBDTencoding genes in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.

as for experiments shown in Figure 6 in BG11 (lane 1-4) or
BG110 (lane 5-8) with and without a source of ferric ammonium citrate and/or copper and reverse transcription (RT)
polymerase chain reaction was performed in the absence (RT) or presence of reverse transcriptase on isolated RNA
using primers for rnpB and all5036 (listed in Table 3) to visualize expression.
As only all5036 encodes a TonB-like protein in Anabaena
sp. PCC 7120 we analysed its expression under the conditions outlined (Figure 7). As expected, all5036 transcript
can be detected under all conditions tested. Assuming that
the function of all identified TBDTs in Anabaena sp.
depends on TonB, All5036 is required for iron homeostasis in general.

Conclusion
By clustering ~4,600 TBDTs we found that they group by
their substrate and not according to their taxonomy with
the exception of regions IX, XI, XIII and C. The latter are
specific for sequences from bacteroidetes and -proteobacteria, respectively. Hence, the transported molecule
dominates the sequence variation among TBDTs. According to the occurrence of expTBDTs within clusters, we
were able to assign a tentative substrate for almost twothirds of the analysed sequences. We have developed a
website for a further detailed inspection of the clustering
of individual sequences http://www.cibiv.at/TBDT. Here,
the individual clusters or sequences can be highlighted
based on the presentation in Figure 2. However, the current assignment has to be viewed with care as Schauer and
colleagues pointed out that further substrates might be
discovered in future [128], which will then be introduced
into the web interface. We identified several clusters of
TBDTs with putatively so far unknown substrates. Further
research on a few candidate proteins of each of these clusters would be of great interest, as it would significantly
advance the knowledge on substrate uptake by bacteria on

Large differences to previously suggested classifications
were not observed for iron-transporting TBDTs. Generally,
our approach resembles previous classifications of TBDTs
according to their substrates based on a smaller number of
sequences and a phylogenetic tree reconstruction
[53,80,82,111,112], but the positioning of the IutA and of
the ViuA sequences differs with respect to distances previously proposed [82,112]. In contrast to the report by LeVier and Guerinot who placed ViuA between the lactoferrin
and transferrin recognizing transporters [82], we found
that ViuA (sequence 74, Region VI) clearly clusters with
FyuA (sequence 72) sequences. This discrepancy might
reflect the fact that: (i) more sequences of TBDTs are available nowadays; and (ii) the methodology to analyse
sequence relationships has improved.
A deviation from this general picture was found for the
predicted BtuBs, which are spread over a long stripe from
regions II to V. Hence, BtuBs might show a similar diffuse
distribution pattern like the heme and hydroxamate transporters (regions I and V, respectively). The predicted BtuBs
might, therefore, transport substrates only structurally
related to cobalt-complexing vitamin B12.
TBDTs in Anabaena sp
Based on database searches, we have identified 25
sequences with TonB-box signature [39] leading to 22
sequences coding for putative TBDTs in Anabaena sp. PCC
7120 (Figures 3, 4, 5). Strikingly, at least five different
types of transporters are identified (FhuA, ViuA, IutA,
BtuB and HutA type) and this number greatly exceeds the
number of genes coding for TBDTs of almost all other
(sequenced) cyanobacteria with the exception of Gloeobacter violaceus. In turn, this is the only species for which
some of the TBDTs could not be functionally assigned. As
already discussed, it has been hypothesized that iron limitation might have been one of the selective forces in evolution of cyanobacteria. Gloeobacter violaceus (33 TBDTs)
was isolated in 1972 from a calcareous rock near the
Vierwaldstättersee in Switzerland, whereas Anabaena variablis (previously Anabaena flos-aquae strain A-37; 10
TBDTs) was isolated in 1964 from fresh water of the Mississippi, USA. Both strains are considered non-symbiotic.
G. violaceus is rather unique with respect to the absence of
thylakoid structure and does not form filaments [132] like
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (4 TBDTs), which was isolated
from fresh water in California and deposited in the Pasteur collection in 1968 http://www.crbip.pasteur.fr.
Hence, the number of TBDTs does not correlate with filament or heterocyst formation. It might, however, correlate
with the habitat from which the species were isolated,
with respect to either species competition for iron or iron

limitations in the environment per se. Therefore, symbiotic cyanobacteria such as Nostoc punctiforme may possibly
contain a rather low number of TBDTs because iron is provided by the host. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, the source of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 formerly named Nostoc muscorum ISU ([133]; further synonyms are Anabaena sp. ATCC 27893, Nostoc sp. strain
PCC 7120) - is unknown and it is considered to be a 'free
living cyanobacterium'. The observation that this cyanobacterium is susceptible to viruses isolated from the Lake
Mendota, Dane County, Wisconsin, USA, [133] might
suggest that a similar environment was its place of isolation. This would be in line with an original natural habitat
of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 that contained rather limited
iron sources, because it has been reported that the iron
concentration in rivers is higher than in lakes ([134]). The
variety of TBDT classes found in Anabaena sp. rather agrees
with iron limited environmental conditions. The only
TBDT type which could not be identified in the analysed
cyanobacterial species, in general, and, thereby, also in
Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, is the FecA-type (diferric dicitrate) which can be found in many other bacteria. To date,
schizokinen is the only confirmed siderophore which is
secreted by Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 [27] and, recently, its
transporter was identified [33]. However, additional
siderophores are secreted by Anabaena sp. [33,131], but
they have not yet been characterized. Nevertheless, other
interpretations for the variable number of TBDTs might
still be possible.
The environment influences the expression of TBDT genes
in Anabaena sp
In line with iron limitation in the native environment,
several differential expression regulation regimes have
been observed. For instance, six out of 14 genes encoding
hydroxamate recognizing FhuA-like transporters are
expressed under (almost) all tested conditions (Figure 6C,
grey and grey dashed line, Table 1). The same holds true
for one BtuB-like transporter encoded by all3310, which is
in accordance with its identification in a proteome analysis of cells grown under standard conditions [135,136].
Interestingly, the other BtuB-like transporter encoded by
the joint gene all4028/all4029 is only expressed under
iron-limiting conditions (Figure 6C, black dotted line).
Furthermore, the iutA-like genes are always expressed
under nitrogen-limiting conditions, whereas hutA-like
genes are only expressed upon metal starvation (Figure
6C, black dashed dotted line). Also, for the gene encoding
the schizokinen transporter SchT (Alr0397) only a moderate and intermediate influence of iron starvation on
expression was observed [33]. The gene encoding the only
putative catecholate transporter (All4026) appears to be
expressed under non-limiting conditions as well as after
nitrogen starvation. To our surprise, we did not observe a
transcript under iron limitation but under copper limita-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/68

tion in BG11 or in the absence of both metals in BG11
and BG110. Such a clear relation to copper starvation was
detected for four FhuA-type transporters as well (Figure
6C). The relation between the expression of genes encoding for TBDTs in Anabaena sp. and copper agrees with the
recent observation that genes involved in siderophore
production are also induced by copper starvation [131].
Nevertheless, the components of the network regulating
the expression of TBDT encoding genes still need to be
identified. Even though a complex network of TBDTs was
discovered, only a single TonB protein was found in 58%
of Gram-negative bacteria [137]. The gene is expressed
under all tested conditions and, hence, it has to be considered as a master 'regulator' of the large group of TBDTs.

Methods
Identification of TonB-dependent transporters
Ninety-eight TBDT sequences were extracted from the
NCBI database after extensive literature search. For 67 of
them, experimental data is available, but for four of them
the substrate is still unknown. Information on predicted
substrates for the remaining 27 is available (see Additional file 1, [14-19,22,34-124]). These predictions are
based on co-localization with genes of a specific metabolic pathway or on co-regulation by either transcription
factors or a riboswitch [128]. Moreover, we downloaded
686 completely sequenced eubacterial genomes from the
NCBI ftp server ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/
that were available in June 2008. In order to locate putative TBDTs in the genomes, we searched for open reading
frames containing the TBDT -barrel domain and the plug
domain. To this end, we used hmmsearch (hidden
Markov model search) from the hmmer package http://
hmmer.janelia.org/ and the profile hidden Markov models PF00593 and PF07715 provided by the PFAM database
[138,139]. The hmmsearch output-files were parsed considering only hits with an E-value < 10-10. We used only
sequences for further analysis that resulted in a significant
hit for both domains.
Phylogenetic analysis and clustering
The 97 cyanobacterial TBDT sequences were aligned with
MAFFT [140] and a maximum likelihood tree was constructed with IQPNNI v3.3.b4 [141]. As a substitution
model we selected VT [142] with gamma-distributed rate
heterogeneity. Support values were calculated from 1000
bootstrap replicates. The consensus tree was reconstructed
with Tree-Puzzle v5.2 [143] applying the majority consensus rule. The program CLANS [144] was used to cluster the
4648 putative TBDTs detected in the complete genomes,
and to visualize their degree of similarity. In CLANS we set
the cut off such that only P-values < 10-10 obtained by
pairwise BLASTs were used for the CLANS-clustering. In
the context of this manuscript, we use the term 'cluster' to
refer to an aggregation of sequences. Each sequence in a

cluster has at least one correspondent within the cluster
with a BLAST p-value < 10-90 leading to 195 clusters with
at least two elements.

To further elucidate the relationship of the 195 clusters,
we ran CLANS 100 times with a random initial configuration of the sequences in 3d space. In each run we determined the cluster centres and computed pair-wise
distances between the centres. With the PHYLIP package
v3.68 [145] we constructed a neighbour-joining tree for
the resulting 100 distance matrices and we inferred the
majority rule consensus tree with support values for the
splits in the consensus tree.
Genome loci of TonB-dependent transporters in
Anabaena sp. PCC 7120
The annotations of genes upstream and downstream of
the TBDT loci, shown in Figure 5, were done manually.
Analysis of the operon structure
Genomic DNA of Anabaena sp. was isolated as described
[146]. The intergenic sequences between all2619 and
all2620 and between alr4028 and alr4029, respectively,
and additional ~250 bp inside each flanking gene were
amplified with 5' Prime PCR Extender Polymerase (5'
Prime, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), transformed into
DH5 (GibcoBRL, Eggenstein, Deutschland) and the
resulting plasmids purified for sequencing.
