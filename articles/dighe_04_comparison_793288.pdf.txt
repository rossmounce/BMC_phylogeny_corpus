Abstract
Background: The phylogeny of the genus Methanobrevibacter was established almost 25 years ago
on the basis of the similarities of the 16S rRNA oligonucleotide catalogs. Since then, many 16S
rRNA gene sequences of newly isolated strains or clones representing the genus
Methanobrevibacter have been deposited. We tried to reorganize the 16S rRNA gene sequences of
this genus and revise the taxonomic affiliation of the isolates and clones representing the genus
Methanobrevibacter.
Results: The phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on 786 bp aligned region from fifty-four
representative sequences of the 120 available sequences for the genus revealed seven multimember groups namely, Ruminantium, Smithii, Woesei, Curvatus, Arboriphilicus, Filiformis, and
the Termite gut symbionts along with three separate lineages represented by Mbr. wolinii, Mbr.
acididurans, and termite gut flagellate symbiont LHD12. The cophenetic correlation coefficient, a
test for the ultrametric properties of the 16S rRNA gene sequences used for the tree was found
to be 0.913 indicating the high degree of goodness of fit of the tree topology. A significant
relationship was found between the 16S rRNA sequence similarity (S) and the extent of DNA
hybridization (D) for the genus with the correlation coefficient (r) for logD and logS, and for [ln(lnD) and ln(-lnS)] being 0.73 and 0.796 respectively. Our analysis revealed that for this genus, when
S = 0.984, D would be <70% at least 99% of the times, and with 70% D as the species "cutoff", any
16S rRNA gene sequence showing <98% sequence similarity can be considered as a separate
species. In addition, we deduced group specific signature positions that have remained conserved
in evolution of the genus.
Conclusions: A very significant relationship between D and S was found to exist for the genus
Methanobrevibacter, implying that it is possible to predict D from S with a known precision for the
genus. We propose to include the termite gut flagellate symbiont LHD12, the methanogenic
endosymbionts of the ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, and rat feces isolate RT reported earlier, as separate
species of the genus Methanobrevibacter.

Background
Methanogens are members of the domain Archaea, and
fall within the kingdom Euryarchaeota [1]. They are obligate anaerobes and can be unambiguously differentiated
from other organisms since they all produce methane as a
major catabolic product [2]. A significant source of global
atmospheric methane (≤ 1.30 µmol g [fresh weight]-1 h-1)
is contributed by termites, which are the terrestrial arthropods, that exist in high biomass densities [3]. This methane production has been attributed to the methanogenic
Archaea, which reside in their gut and the symbiotic role
of these methanogens in the gut of termites has already
been reported [3-7].
Methanogens that reduce CO2 with H2 to form methane
are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract ecosystems. Methanobrevibacter is one such major intestinal
genus of the Methanobacteriaceae family that can reduce
CO2 with H2 to form methane [8]. A majority of the species of the genus Methanobrevibacter were isolated from the
gastrointestinal ecosystems. Mbr. ruminantium, the type
species, was isolated from bovine rumen whereas Mbr.
smithii was isolated from human colon [8,9]. Ferrai et al.
isolated Mbr. oralis from the human oral cavity [10]. Three
different species were isolated from termite hindguts: Mbr.
cuticularis, Mbr. curvatus, and Mbr. filiformis [3,4].
Recently, Miller and Lin proposed the formal nomenclature for five methanogens isolated from animal feces earlier [8,11]. They represent four new species named Mbr.
gottschalkii, Mbr. thaueri, Mbr. woesei, and Mbr. wolinii. The
eleventh species, Mbr. arboriphilicus, was isolated from
decaying cottonwood trees [12]. Recently, one more species, Mbr. acididurans, was isolated from an anaerobic
digester [13].
Phenotypic differentiation of species of Methanobrevibacter is unsatisfactory because of the lack of distinguishing morphological, biochemical, and physiological
characteristics [3]. The limited number of markers and the
lack of information about their distribution among
strains and the phenotypic differences between strains
mandate the use of more powerful molecular tools for
establishing phylogenetic relationships [8]. Two important genotypic markers widely used in recent bacterial taxonomy are the 16S rRNA gene sequence data and DNADNA hybridization data. Many researchers reported the
correlation between 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
values and genomic DNA relatedness. For the domain
Bacteria, Wayne et al. [14] proposed that phenotypically
related bacterial strains showing 70% or greater genomic
DNA relatedness constitute a single bacterial species. In
contrast, those having <70% but >20% similarity are considered to be different species within a genus [15]. 16S
rRNA gene sequence similarity value below 97% corresponds to DNA reassociation value not more than 60%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/20

whereas 16S rRNA gene similarities over 97%, require
genomic DNA reassociation studies to assess relation of
two organisms as a single or separate species [16]. In contrast to this generalized view, Boone et al. [17] considered
that a sequence similarity of 98% or less as an evidence for
separate species within the methanogens. Since the study
deals with methanogens, novel species proposals will be
based on the latter study by Boone et al. [17].
The statistical implications of this correlation between
these two parameters are of great interest in prokaryotic
systematics. Devereux et al (1990) proposed that, if the
extent of DNA hybridization (D) was considered equivalent to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (S), then logS =
K logD, where K was a constant [18]. Consistent with this
assumption, a very significant correlation was found
between logS and logD for many taxa including the family
Methanobacteriaceae [18,19]. Thus, 16S rRNA sequence
similarity can be a good predictor of extent of DNA
hybridization, and being powerful, reliable and convenient, it can be used for the determination of taxonomic
affiliation of newly isolated strains or clones to a particular genera [16-19]. This is specifically advantageous in the
studies of environmental samples where many organisms
are detected only by their rRNA sequence.
The phylogeny of the genus Methanobrevibacter was established almost 25 years ago on the basis of the similarities
of the 16S rRNA oligonucleotide catalogs [2]. Since then,
many 16S rRNA gene sequences of newly isolated strains
or clones representing the genus Methanobrevibacter have
been deposited in the GenBank and other public databases. Many reports describing Methanobrevibacter taxonomy based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis restricted
themselves to Methanobrevibacter species present in the
feces of higher animals [8,11,20] and gut of termites [5,6].
A relatively recent report studied the acquisition of methanogenic archaeal symbionts by anaerobic ciliates, both
free-living and intestinal, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity [7]. Till date, there is no report
describing Methanobrevibacter taxonomy using all the 16S
rRNA gene sequences that are available in the database.
It was therefore felt necessary to reorganize the 16S rRNA
gene sequences of this genus and revise the taxonomic
affiliation of the isolates and clones representing the
genus Methanobrevibacter. We studied the correlation
between 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and the
extent of DNA hybridization for the genus Methanobrevibacter based on the available DNA hybridization data
[8,21,22]. Since majority of available sequences in the
database were from clones of environmental samples, we
have used 16S rRNA gene sequence as predictor for taxonomy of the genus. In addition, we have deduced group
specific nucleotide positions showing specific nucleotide

substitutions in the 16S rRNA gene sequences of this
genus. Furthermore, we propose to include termite gut
flagellate symbiont LHD12, the methanogenic endosymbionts of the ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, and rat feces isolate
RT reported earlier [6-8], as separate species in the genus
Methanobrevibacter. Till sufficient information is made
available about other markers, our report on Methanobrevibacter taxonomy will prove to be very useful for those
who use 16S rRNA gene sequence data for identification
of their isolates.

Results
Sequence retrieval and phylogenetic analysis
A total of 120 sequences specific for the 16S rRNA gene for
the genus Methanobrevibacter, were available in the public
database as of May 10, 2003. A majority of the sequences
(86 sequences) were from Methanobrevibacter specific 16S
rRNA gene clones whereas only 34 sequences were from
isolated strains of the genus Methanobrevibacter. Moreover,
all the available sequences were partial with length varying from 287 bp to 1481 bp and only half of these were
larger than 1 kb. It was reported earlier that phylogenetic
trees based on partial sequence have the same topologies
as those based on complete sequence with the established
groups being identical but some deep branches differing
slightly [23,24]. We therefore included only those
sequences (total 82 sequences) that were larger than 600
bp, since this sequence length ensured the inclusion of all
those sequences that would otherwise be excluded with
larger sequence length criteria. An initial similarity analysis of the sequences showed the presence of sixteen
sequences grouping in three different sets of replicate
sequences with 100% similarity. Amongst all such
sequences, only one representative sequence was used
from each set for the further analysis. Moreover, some
sequences aligning for regions shorter than 500 bp like,
Mbr. oralis, many endosymbionts of the ciliate Nyctotherus
spp., and methanogenic clones associated with rumen ciliates [25], were also excluded. Thus, a total of 54
sequences, of which twenty sequences representing Methanobrevibacter strains whereas thirty-four sequences representing Methanobrevibacter spp. specific 16S rRNA gene
clones, giving an alignment of 802 nucleotide positions
(bases 286 to 1120, E. coli numbering) were used for the
final analysis. An initial similarity analysis revealed that
the percentage similarity values ranged from 87–100% for
all these sequences whereas they showed less then 84%
sequence similarity with the representatives of other genera of the family Methanobacteriaceae.

Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 54 sequences,
the genus Methanobrevibacter could be clustered into seven
distinct phylogenetic groups comprising of more than one
strain and/or clone in each group as shown in Fig. 1. These
groups were designated as Ruminantium, Smithii, Woe-

sei, Curvatus, Arboriphilicus, Filiformis, and the Termite
gut symbiont group. Mbr. wolinii, Mbr. acididurans and the
termite gut flagellate symbiont clone LHD12 formed three
separate lineages in the tree and were thus not considered
in any of the above mentioned groups. In most cases, the
same groupings were obtained regardless of the method
used: neighbor-joining, parsimony, maximum likelihood
or the UPGMA. The groupings were done taking in view
that all the members of a particular group arise from a
common node, i.e., monophyletic, and have the same
topology regardless of the method that was used. The CCC
analysis, the parameter that measures the correlation
between similarity values calculated during tree building
and the observed similarity, was found to be high (r =
0.913). A branch that showed a separate lineage with a
recent evolution in the Arboriphilicus group as seen in the
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) was represented by a strain that
was an endosymbiont of the ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis [7].
This strain with accession number AJ132639 was designated as strain NO by us.
Correlation of D and S
Using the available data, a highly significant relationship
was found between the logarithmic transformations of S
and D (Fig. 2). The correlation coefficient (r) between
logS and logD was 0.73, which was significant at P <
0.0001 (Fig. 2a). Moreover, a high CCC (0.913), that tests
the ultrametric properties of the sequences, proved that
the biological relationship between D and S is valid for
the genus Methanobrevibacter [18,19]. To look for an
empirical relationship that might be useful to predict D
from S, the complementary log log transformation [ln(lnD) versus ln(-lnS)] produced a much better correlation
coefficient, 0.796, which was significant at P < 0.0001,
than found with the normal log transformations of D and
S (Fig. 2b). In the absence of a systematic variation in the
error, this analysis suggested that D would be less than 70
% at least 99 % of the time when S = 0.984 (Fig. 2c). These
results were in good agreement with the proposal of
Boone et al. [17], who proposed that a sequence similarity
of 98% or less be considered as evidence for a separate
species within the methanogens and we base our novel
species proposals on this. Estimates of D for a given S were
calculated from regression of ln(-lnD) vs ln(-lnS) and
standard deviation (SD) of residuals in D, where ln(-lnD)
= 0.5077 [ln(-lnS)] + 1.8999 and the SD of the residuals
in D was 0.3498.
Description of the phylogenetic groups
Ruminantium group
The group comprised of seventeen sequences (Fig. 1.) of
which three were from isolated strains, represented by
Mbr. ruminantium, a ciliate symbiont strain MB9 [26] and
a red deer rumen inhabitant (NT7). Similar to the observations made by Whitford et al. [20], the sequences

formed two subgroups: Mbr I, with four bovine rumen
clones, along with three strains NT7, MB9 and Mbr. ruminantium; and subgroup Mbr II, with ten bovine rumen
clones. Since many clone sequences were identical, we
chose only few representatives from each group. The percent similarity values for all the sequences of this group
used in the analysis here varied from 96.77 to 100%. The
sub-clusters originally contained nine sequences in Mbr I
(similarity values ranged from 99.4 to 100%) that were
98.5 to 98.8% similar to Mbr. ruminantium, and fifteen in
Mbr II (99.3 to 100% similar to each other). Members of
Mbr II had sequence similarity ranging from 97.2 to
97.7% with Mbr. ruminantium. On the basis of the study
by Boone et al. [17], it had been suggested that Mbr I
could be considered as members of species Mbr. ruminantium whereas Mbr II are separate species of this genus
since the percentage similarity values for the latter are
<98%. Thus, this group contained two distinct species represented by subgroup Mbr I, a mixture of both isolated
strains (Mbr. ruminantium, strain NT7 and MB9) and
cloned (bovine rumen symbionts) sequences, and subgroup Mbr II, containing only cloned sequences from
bovine rumen.

one was recently designated to be a novel species of the
genus Methanobrevibacter and named formally as Mbr.
woesei GS [11]. It shared 97.4% similarity with the other
strain RT of the group. Since this value was less than the
cut off as suggested by Boone et al. [17], strain RT can be
regarded to be a new species of the genus. Since actual
experimental DNA hybridization data was not available
for the two strains, quantitative analysis of the data in Fig.
2 clearly indicated that when S = 0.984, D would be <70%
at least 99% of the times and with 70% D as the species
"cutoff", strain RT almost certainly represents a new species. Strain RT showed percent similarity ranging from
96.1 to 97.5% whereas strain GS showed 95.7 to 97.2%
similarity with the other members of the Smithii group
members, clearly indicating that even if the site of isolation of the strains is same, they may still be phylogenetically different since most of the members of the Smithii
group were isolated from animal feces like the strains GS
and RT. Separate species status of both these strains was
further supported by the low DNA hybridization values
[8] that ranged from 32 to 48 for RT against the three Mbr.
smithii strains and 18 to 41 for GS against Mbr. smithii PS,
Mbr. gottschalkii (HO and PG), and Mbr. thaueri (CW).

Smithii group
This group was represented by seven isolates (Fig. 1) of
which six were methanogenic archaea from feces of higher
animals and remaining one was from a different habitat:
strain SM9, isolated from sheep rumen (Jarvis GN,
Strompl C, Moore ERB, Joblin KN: 1999 Unpublished
data). The strains isolated from feces of higher animals
like, PG: pig, HO: horse, CW: cow, and humans: B181 and
ALI, were reported earlier by Lin and Miller [8]. Recently
three members of this group were designated as new species from this group [11], namely Mbr. gottschalkii (HO
and PG), and Mbr. thaueri (CW). The overall percentage
similarity for this group was 97.46 to 100%. The strain
SM9 from sheep rumen forms a part of this group and
probably represents another strain of the Smithii group
since it was not very distinct from the other members of
the group with respect to the similarity values, 97.96 to
99.11%, and these values are in the limits as described
earlier [16,17]. Majority of the cloned sequences available
in the database demonstrating similarity to Mbr. smithii,
could not be included in the study since the sequences of
these clones were determined at the 3' end of the 16S
rRNA gene and thus showed no overlap with the other
sequences. Sequences of methanogens associated with
rumen protozoa have been shown to be highly related to
Mbr. smithii [20].

Curvatus group
Seven sequences represented this group of which only
one, Mbr. curvatus, was a well-characterized strain isolated
from hindgut contents of Reticulitermes flavipes [3]. All the
remaining were clones from methanogenic archaea associated either with flagellated protists in termite gut or
attached to the gut epithelium of the termites [6]. The percent similarity values for the group range from 97.21 –
99.87. In specific, the group comprised of either clones or
isolates from termite gut contents, indicating a habitat
specific group and a common evolution of the members.

Woesei group
The group was represented by only two sequences that
represented strains isolated from feces of goose (GS) and
rat (RT) reported earlier by Lin and Miller [8]. Of the two,

The termite gut symbionts RsW2 and HW1, both from gut
walls of R. speratus and H. sjoestedti [6] respectively, clustered together with Mbr. curvatus with high percent similarity (more than 98.5%) and hence could be regarded as
strains of that species. The other cloned gut symbiont
sequences formed two distinct lineages (Fig. 1). One contained clones HW2 and HI26, from gut wall and whole
gut fractions of H. sjoestedti respectively. The extent of percent similarity between them was 98.98 % and these again
represent strains of same species. The third lineage contained LRsD2 from the flagellate Dinenympha parva
present in the gut of R. speratus and RsI12 from whole gut
fraction of R. speratus, these too represent a homogenous
cluster with percent sequence similarity of 99.87 % and
represent a single species. Both these lineages of the
cloned gut symbionts can be regarded as different species
since their intra lineage sequence similarity values were
below 98%. No group specific signature positions could
be deduced for the Curvatus group.

Arboriphilicus group
This group contained five sequences (Fig. 1) out of which
three were well-characterized isolates and one was a newly
reported endosymbiont (strain NO) of the ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis [7]. The remaining was a clone, MPn19 from
gut contents of the soil feeding higher termite Pericapritermes nitobei [5]. The type strain of Mbr. arboriphilicus was
isolated from enrichments of decaying cottonwood tissue,
whereas Mbr. cuticularis was isolated from hindgut contents of a termite R. flavipes. The percentage similarity values for the group ranged from 92.59 to 99.74%. No group
specific signature positions could be deduced for this
group.

The clone MPn19 showed a separate lineage but clustering
with the two Mbr. arboriphilicus sequences with more than
97% similarity values thereby indicating that it may warrant a separate species status provided the D values are
<70%. The strain NO was the most interesting since it
formed a separate lineage. The strain NO sequence
showed very low similarity values of 92.59 to 93.5% with
the other members of the group. The maximum percentage similarity shared by strain NO was with Mbr. cuticularis (93.5%) and such low sequence similarity value is in
support of it being a distinct species. Quantitative estimate from Fig. 2, indicating a high probability of D being
<70% at such low S between strain NO and other members of the group, clearly supported the inclusion of strain
NO as a separate species of the Arboriphilicus group.
Filiformis group
Similar to the Woesei group, only two members represented the filiformis group, a well characterized strain,
Mbr. filiformis, isolated from hindgut contents of a termite
R. flavipes, and the lower termite gut symbiont clone HW3
isolated from the gut wall of H. sjoestedti [6]. Both of them
being termite gut associated, with 98.23% sequence similarity can be regarded as strains of the same species. Furthermore, both showed very less percentage similarity
with the members of the group Arboriphilicus with values
ranging from 92.28 to 97% for Mbr. filiformis, and 92.15
to 96.93% for HW3. Quantitative estimate from Fig. 2,
indicating a high probability of D being <70% at such low
S between the two and the other members of the
Arboriphilicus group, clarifies their grouping as a separate
group.
Termite gut symbiont group
All the eleven sequences that belonged to the termite gut
symbiont group were from Methanobrevibacter specific 16S
rRNA gene clones and there are no well-characterized species in this group. The sequences shared a percentage similarity from 94.22 to 99.87. The group showed two
subgroups with subgroup I represented by five clones
whereas subgroup II by six clones (Fig. 1). Termite gut

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/20

symbionts HI1, HI28, LHD2, LHM8, and MHj4 formed
one lineage, whereas LRsD3, LRsM1, RsI4, RsW10, M4
and Cd30 formed the other. The tree topology for this
group was in accordance with the one reported earlier [5],
with M4 and Cd30 going together and MHj4 forming a
separate branch but all originating from a common node
(Fig. 1).
Subgroup I represented methanogenic symbionts isolated
from the gut of a wood feeding lower termite, H. sjoestedti
[6]. HI1, HI28, and MHj4 were isolated from the whole
gut fractions, whereas LHD2 and LHM8 were isolated
from the flagellates Dinenympha and Microjoenia, respectively associated with the gut of the termite [6]. The overall sequence similarity for subgroup I was 97.46% to
99.62%. LHD2 formed a separate lineage with similarity
values 97.46% to 98.1% against other members of subgroup I, indicating that it may represent a new species distinct from the other four members of the subgroup.
The second subgroup contained methanogenic symbionts
isolated from the gut of wood feeding lower termites, R.
speratus and Cryptotermes domesticus [5,6]. RsI4 and M4,
and Cd30 were isolated from the whole gut fractions of R.
speratus and C. domesticus, respectively, whereas RsW10
was found associated with the gut wall of R. speratus.
LRsD2 and LRsM1, were isolated from the flagellates
Dinenympha and Microjoenia, respectively associated with
the gut of the termite R. speratus. The overall sequence
similarity for subgroup II was 96.64% to 99.87%. Cd30
formed a separate lineage with similarity values 96.64%
to 97.2%, against other members of subgroup II, indicating that it may represent a new species distinct from the
other five members of the subgroup.
Single member lineages
The phylogenetic analysis of the genus showed three separate lineages that were represented by single members of
which two were well characterized strains, Mbr. wolinii
and Mbr. acididurans, whereas one was termite gut flagellate clone LHD12 (Fig. 1). The strain Mbr. wolinii SH was
isolated from sheep feces by Lin and Miller [8], was later
formally designated as a new species of the genus Methanobrevibacter [11]. The sequence similarity values of the
strain with the other members of the Smithii group, that
shared a common habitat with the strain SH, were found
to be low, 92.83% to 94.64%, whereas it showed percent
similarity values ranging from 89.68 to 94.49 with all the
other members of the genus Methanobrevibacter. As
reported earlier [8], the strain showed no or very low
genomic DNA reassociation with Mbr. smithii PS and the
other Methanobrevibacter isolates from horse, pig, cow,
and goose feces. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence
and genomic DNA reassociation studies, the strain SH
represents a new taxon at the species level [8].

Mbr. acididurans, an anaerobic acid tolerant methanogen
(strain ATM), branching separately, shared the least
homology with any other sequence (90.78 to 96.04%)
and had already been defined as a new species of the
genus Methanobrevibacter [13]. The strain showed similarity values ranging from 94.69 to 96.02% with the member
of the ruminantium group.
The clone LHD12, isolated from a flagellate, Dinenympha
present in the gut of a termite Hodotermopsis sjoestedti [6]
and had less than 98 % similarity with any of the
sequences used in the analysis with values ranging from
92.46 to 97.83% supporting its separate descent in the
tree. It showed maximum sequence similarity of 97.83%
with the rat feces strain RT, a member of the Woesei
group, whereas with the members of the Smithii group
with which it shared a common decent, the percentage
similarity was 95.44 to 97.47%. Based on the 16S rRNA
gene sequence similarity values, genomic DNA reassociation values estimated by Fig. 2, and the separate lineage
shown in the phylogenetic tree, this can be regarded as
separate species of this genus.
Group specific signature positions
The group specific signature positions deduced for the
Ruminantium, Smithii, the Termite gut symbiont groups

and the single member lineages are given in Table 1. The
termite gut symbiont group was divided in two subgroups
based on the phylogenetic analysis and each of theses subgroups was represented by a number of signature positions as shown. Parsimony and maximum likelihood
methods as well as neighbor-joining supported these
groupings. The majority of these signature positions corresponded to those suggested by Woese [27] since each
position had a different but conserved base in the neighbor sequences. Furthermore, since the sequence positions
are conserved, these signature positions are less likely to
change in the future when new sequences corresponding
to new taxonomic groups are added.
Placement of methanogenic endosymbionts of the ciliate
Nyctotherus
Strain NO deserves a special mention as it formed a distinct lineage in the Arboriphilicus group in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). At the time of the study, ten 16S rRNA
gene sequences representing methanogenic endosymbionts of Nyctotherus (N. ovalis, N. cordoformis, N. velox) were
available from GenBank. These strains are currently
placed in the genus Methanobrevibacter [7]. Out of these,
only one sequence, representing methanogenic endosymbiont of N. ovalis from Periplaneta americana var. Amsterdam (AJ132639) was greater than 1 kb and hence others
Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2004, 4

were not considered for the construction of the phylogenetic tree. Initial analysis revealed that the sequence
AJ132639 was 100% identical to other two sequences,
methanogenic endosymbiont of N. ovalis from P. americana var. Dar es Salaam (AJ132641) and methanogenic
endosymbiont of N. ovalis from Blaberus var. Amsterdam
(AJ132643). Preliminary analysis involving all the ten
sequences revealed that majority of the methanogenic
endosymbionts of N. ovalis clustered together with the
Arboriphilicus group but formed a distinct lineage (data
not shown). The strain NO sequence showed the least percent similarity values of 92.15% to 93.5% with the other
members of the Arboriphilicus group and such low
sequence similarity value indicating a high probability of
D being <70% (Fig. 2) is in support of it being considered
a distinct species.
We aligned the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain NO
(AJ132639) along with other members of the Arboriphilicus and Filiformis group (U41095, U82322, AB009827,
AB026925, and AB065294), representative species of the
genus Methanobrevibacter (U55233, U55240, U62533 and
RDP-Mbb.rumina.), Msp. stadtmanae (M59139) and that
of E. coli (J01859, Fig. 3). It was clearly seen that there was
an insertion of one additional triplet 'AAG' at E. coli position 934. Similarly, there was an insertion of a single base
'A' at E. coli position 1032. Furthermore, there was a deletion of one base each at E. coli positions 970, 995 and 999.
As a result of these insertions and deletions, the strain
formed a separate branch in the tree. Hence placement of
methanogenic endosymbionts of Nyctotherus in the genus
Methanobrevibacter needs to be reconsidered and it should
be regarded as a separate species of the genus.

Discussion
The aim of the present investigation was to carry out phylogenetic analysis of the genus Methanobrevibacter based
on 16S rRNA gene sequence and propose some guidelines
for the delineation of species identity or for the identification of new isolates of the genus Methanobrevibacter. Moreover, we reorganized the sequences in the genus,
especially the sequences from the clones representing
uncultured bacteria. This information will be very useful
when 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis is used alone for
this purpose.
We were able to group 54 sequences in seven distinct
groups and designate group specific signature positions
for three groups, Ruminantium, Smithii and the Termite
gut symbionts. The majority of the sequences (86) represented clones from uncultured organisms either from
rumen or termite gut. A few of these clones (for e.g. HW1,
RsW2, HW3) were closely related to cultured isolates at
the 16S rRNA sequence level, and the majority of them
formed distinct lineages. The clones from the rumen envi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/20

ronment were closely related to Mbr. ruminantium
whereas those from termite gut formed separate lineages.
Similarly, all the isolates from feces of higher animals
were closely related. This indicates a correlation between
ecological habitat, physiology and 16S rRNA based phylogeny. The presence of large number of cloned sequences
in the termite gut that formed lineages different from any
of the cultured isolates emphasizes uniqueness of this
environment and also the diversity that is likely to be
present in the genus.
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis is undoubtedly an
important parameter for species delineation and identification. However, other markers like cell wall composition, bile sensitivity, formate utilization, and
requirements for acetate, CoM, 2-methylbutyrate can be
useful for species delineation and identification and also
to study the activities of Methanobrevibacter strains in
native habitats. In addition to 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity, genomic DNA reassociation values are also
essential for the correct identification of a strain and
together these two markers are the most important aspects
of taxonomic affiliation of any strain. A correlation
between these two markers exists and it depends on the
taxa in study. Since many studies involve the use of 16S
rRNA gene sequence analysis as the basis of clonal affiliation, a prediction of the extent of DNA hybridization from
sequence similarity will help enormously not only in the
environmental studies, but also in the most common
studies involving well isolated strains.
Designation of a newly isolated strain as a new species
requires critical analysis. The grouping of a new strain
within the genus Methanobrevibacter based on 16S rRNA
gene sequence, as reported earlier [4] should be supported
by: 1) bootstrap values of 99% for the node from which
the new strain and the other members of the genus, radiate; 2) the possession of a signature sequence (5'-tgt gag
(a/c)aa tcg cg-3', corresponding to E. coli positions 375–
388) which is shared only with members of this genus;
and 3) a nucleotide bulge (5'-Tn-3', n = 6 or 8; corresponding to a stem-loop structure at E. coli positions 200–218)
also shared with other members of the genus except Mbr.
curvatus (which instead possess the sequence 5'-ttc tta tgt
t-3'). Moreover, all these sequences shared >87% similarity amongst each other whereas they were <84% similar to
the sequence of the outgroup and representatives of other
generas of the family Methanobacteriaceae, indicating
that sequences with more than 87% similarity can be considered to be of the genera Methanobrevibacter. Further
support was provided by the estimates of D for a given S,
according to which D <20% at an S of <84% at least 95%
of the times (Fig. 2).

Figure 3 of sequences showing differences in the 16S rRNA gene sequence of endosymbiont of Nyctotherus ovalis strain NO
Alignment
Alignment of sequences showing differences in the 16S rRNA gene sequence of endosymbiont of Nyctotherus
ovalis strain NO Sequence for strain NO is shown in bold letters. The positions with differences in the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of strain NO with other members are shown in bold-italics. See text for GenBank Accession numbers against the
strain names used above. "*" indicates conserved positions amongst the sequences used.

We observed that very few reports are available on the
relationship between 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
and genomic DNA relatedness on methanogenic archaea

as compared to that done with bacteria. Therefore it will
be difficult to give conclusive statements about these two
parameters for the genus Methanobrevibacter and one can

BMC Microbiology 2004, 4

predict D given S with an error that is known. It was
reported earlier that for the genus Methanobrevibacter, the
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of >99% corresponds
to >70% genomic DNA similarity, whereas the strains of
Methanobrevibacter with less than 99% 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity, showed less than 50% DNA reassociation values [8]. Our analysis revealed that for this genus,
when S = 0.984, D would be <70% at least 99% of the
times, and with 70% D as the species "cutoff", any 16S
rRNA gene sequence showing <98% sequence similarity
can be considered as a separate species.

Conclusion
Our detailed analysis reveals that any strain showing less
than 87% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity should not
be included in the genus. A very significant relationship
between D and S was found to exist for the genus Methanobrevibacter, implying that it is possible to predict D
from S with a known precision for the genus. The available information allows concluding that newer isolates or
clones showing greater than 98% 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity should be considered as strains of that
particular species. The exceptions to this statement have
been observed only with the genus Methanococcus [28].
The presence of 16S rRNA sequences with nonultrametric
properties and the experimental error associated with D
and the inherent statistical error in using S to estimate
evolutionary distance account for most of the variability
of D given S. Given the relative ease in determining S by
automated sequencing, the ability to estimate D will be of
great utility for systematic studies. For organisms that
have never been isolated but have been detected in natural
samples by rRNA sequence alone (like the majority of
sequences in the present study), the ability to estimate D
will provide a clearer understanding of their genetic and
phenotypic diversity.

Methods
Sequence retrieval and phylogenetic analysis
The 16S rRNA gene sequences used in this study were
either from isolated strains or clones of genus Methanobrevibacter and were retrieved in the fasta format from GenBank except for Mbr. ruminantium (RDP-Mbb.rumina.)
and Mbr. arboriphilicus (RDP-Mbb.arbori.), which were
obtained from RDP – Ribosomal Database Project [29].
The alignment of all the sequences was done using CLUSTAL W program [30]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using 786 bp long aligned sequences by the
neighbor joining method using Kimura 2 parameter distances in MEGA 2.1 software [31]. The resulting tree was
compared with the parsimony method (PHYLIP package)
and the maximum-likelihood method using the fastDNAml program [32]. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of
Methanosphaera stadtmanae (M59139) was used as the outgroup for the analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/20

Determination of cophenetic correlation coefficient
Cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) was calculated
to validate the phylogenetic inference [19]. The similarity
matrix was prepared using the Dnadist program in the
PHYLIP analysis package using the Jukes Cantor corrections. The 16S rRNA similarity matrices were then used to
calculate cophenetic matrices using the UPGMA method
with the Neighbor program in the PHYLIP package. A
cophenetic matrix consisted of the estimated similarity
values derived from the calculation of the UPGMA tree.
The CCC is the correlation coefficient (r) calculated from
the linear regression between the corresponding values of
the similarity matrix and cophenetic matrix. A Visual Basic
program for Microsoft Excel 2000 was written to do the
calculations since even for a small set of data, it becomes
nearly impractical to do them by hand. This program can
be downloaded at the following address: http://web
pages.ull.es/users/jmhernan/CCC.htm.
Correlation between D and S
Using the DNA hybridization data as reported earlier for
the eleven strains: Mbr. arboriphilicus (M1), Mbr.
ruminantium (DH1), Mbr. smithii (strains PS, B181 and
ALI), Mbr. gottschalkii (HO and PG), Mbr. thaueri (CW),
Mbr. woesei (GS), Mbr. wolinii (SH) and Methanobrevibacter
sp. (RT) [8,31], logD was plotted against logS [18]. The
method as described by Keswani and Whitman [19] was
also used, in which a [ln(-lnD) versus ln(-lnS)] plot
described the relationship between S and D. To help in
the calculations and plotting of D against S, an Excel sheet
was downloaded from the following address: http://
www.arches.uga.edu/~whitman/template_d_s.xls.
Group specific signature positions
Group specific signature positions were identified using
the aligned sequence files retrieved from the Ribosomal
Database Project website. Each aligned base was assigned
a number based on E. coli 16S rRNA gene sequence numbering (Accession Number: J01859). Nucleotide positions
that were conserved in all the strains of a given group, but
differed in the closest related sequences outside the group,
were considered signature positions [27]. To deduce signature positions for a larger sequence length, only those
sequences that were greater than 80% of the sequence of
E. coli were considered for the analysis. The reference
sequences, outside the Methanobrevibacter genus, used to
find signature positions for Methanobrevibacter were: Methanobacterium
bryantii
(M59124), M.
congolense
(AF233586), M. formicicum (M36508), M. palustre
(AF095263), M. subterraneum (X99044), M. uliginosum
