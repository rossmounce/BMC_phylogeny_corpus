Abstract
Background: Secreted modular calcium binding protein-1 (Smoc-1) belongs to the BM-40 family which
has been implicated with tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and bone mineralization. Besides its anticipated
role in embryogenesis, Smoc-1 has been characterized only in a few mammalian species. We made use of
the consensus sequence (5' CACCTCTCCACCTGCC 3') of 33.15 repeat loci to explore the buffalo
transcriptome and uncovered the Smoc-1 transcript tagged with this repeat. The main objective of this
study was to gain an insight into its structural and functional organization, and expressional status of Smoc1 in water buffalo, Bubalus bubalis.
Results: We cloned and characterized the buffalo Smoc-1, including its copy number status, in-vitro protein
expression, tissue & age specific transcription/translation, chromosomal mapping and localization to the
basement membrane zone. Buffalo Smoc-1 was found to encode a secreted matricellular glycoprotein
containing two EF-hand calcium binding motifs homologous to that of BM-40/SPARC family. In buffalo, this
single copy gene consisted of 12 exons and was mapped onto the acrocentric chromosome 11. Though
this gene was found to be evolutionarily conserved, the buffalo Smoc-1 showed conspicuous nucleotide/
amino acid changes altering its secondary structure compared to that in other mammals. In silico analysis
of the Smoc-1 proposed its glycoprotein nature with a calcium dependent conformation. Further, we
unveiled two transcript variants of this gene, varying in their 3'UTR lengths but both coding for identical
protein(s). Smoc-1 evinced highest expression of both the variants in liver and modest to negligible in other
tissues. The relative expression of variant-02 was markedly higher compared to that of variant-01 in all the
tissues examined. Moreover, expression of Smoc-1, though modest during the early ages, was
conspicuously enhanced after 1 year and remained consistently higher during the entire life span of buffalo
with gradual increment in expression of variant-02. Immunohistochemically, Smoc-1 was localized in the
basement membrane zones and extracellular matrices of various tissues.
Conclusion: These data added to our understandings about the tissue, age and species specific functions
of the Smoc-1. It also enabled us to demonstrate varying expression of the two transcript variants of Smoc1 amongst different somatic tissues/gonads and ages, in spite of their identical coding frames. Pursuance of
these variants for their roles in various disease phenotypes such as hepatocellular carcinoma and
angiogenesis is envisaged to establish broader biological significance of this gene.

Background
Matricellular or extracellular proteins do not contribute
structurally to the extracellular milieu instead regulate the
cell matrix interactions [1]. Basement membrane-40 (BM40), SPARC (Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)
is an anti-adhesive secreted matricellular glycoprotein
family [2,3] associated with tissue remodeling during normal developmental processes such as angiogenesis and
bone mineralization [4]. Enhanced expression of SPARC
has been reported in malignant tumors [5] and during
early stages of embryogenesis but remain restricted in
adult tissues [6]. The biological attributes of SPARC is to
regulate the activities of collagen IV [7] platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) [8,9] and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) [10].
SPARC family proteins are characterized by the presence
of a follistatin-like (FS) and a C-terminal extracellular
(EC) calcium binding domains with two EF-hand binding
motifs [11,12]. This family includes SC1/Hevin/QR1
[13,14], Testican [15], tsc36/Flik/FRP [16] and the
recently described SMOC-2 [17] and SMOC-1 [18]. In
addition to a calcium-binding EC domain, SMOC-1 consists of two thyroglobulin-like (TY1) domains, an FS
domain and a novel SMOC-1 specific domain. SMOC-1
was localized within the basement membrane of various
murine tissues and organs of different embryonic stages
suggesting its significant role in embryonic development
[18,19]. A perusal of literature, thus far, has not shown
association of this gene with any satellites.
Satellite DNA represents a dynamic component of the
eukaryotic genome [20,21]. The evolutionary conservation of a number of minisatellites either associated with
non-coding or coding genes and their polymorphic status
within/across the species suggest their vital regulatory
roles in eukaryotic genomes [22-24]. However, association of minisatellites with the transcripts is thought to
either regulate the transcription or bind proteins with
diverse functional consequences [25]. In the earlier studies, we uncovered several transcripts representing known
and novel genes from water buffalo using the Minisatellite
Associated Sequence Amplification (MASA) approach and
a consensus sequence of 33.15 repeat loci [26] originating
from the human myoglobin gene [27]. Of these transcripts, one was found to represent the partial cDNA
sequence of Secreted modular calcium binding protein-1
(Smoc-1), also known as SPARC related calcium binding
protein-1.
Here, we describe isolation and characterization of full
length Smoc-1 in water buffalo Bubalus bubalis including
its domain organization, copy number status, in silico
structural and functional analysis, in-vitro protein expression & purification, tissue & age specific transcription/

translation and localization of the same onto the metaphase chromosomes & basement membrane zone. Biological significance of both the transcripts variants
showing highest expression in liver is discussed.

Results
Characterization of buffalo Smoc-1
The cloning strategy for isolation of full length Smoc-1
CDS of 3474 bp and 1933 bp is demonstrated in Fig. 1A
&1B. Clone I contained an insert of 1263 bp (PSmoc-1)
lacking 5'/3' UTRs and signal peptide sequence [26].
Clone II (1414 bp) covered complete coding sequence
from nucleotides 119–1603 but with partial 5' & 3' UTRs.
The 3' UTR was covered by three fragments represented by
clone III, IV & V of which clone III covered nucleotides
from 1461–2473; clone IV, 2307–3328; and clone V,
2435–3428. The polyadenylation signals were accessed
with 3'RACE followed by sequencing of 30 recombinants.
This resulted in the identification of two other clones
(Clone VII & VIII). Clone VII represented nucleotides
1407–1915 followed by 17 mer Poly(A) tail. Clone VIII
covered 2435–3474 encompassing 18 mer Poly(A) tail.
The 5' UTR represented by clone VI (nucleotides 1–649)
was generated by 5' RACE. Following this strategy, full
length CDS of Smoc-1 [FSmoc-1, GenBank: DQ159955
and EF446167] was deduced from different overlapping
fragments (Fig. 1 & Additional file 1). The GC rich 5'-UTR
of 239 bp was followed by an initiating ATG codon and
the terminating TAA codon fell at nucleotide 1545. Thus,
translation of the sequence from nucleotide 240 to 1544
encodes a putative protein of 435 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 48332 Da with a predicted oxidoreductase activity. Multiple sequence alignments
showed that this protein is 95% and 98% identical to
human & cattle Smoc-1, respectively (Table 1).
Buffalo Smoc-1 shows two transcript variants
Northern blot detected two bands of 3.5 kb and 2.0 kb
(Fig. 2) which were confirmed to be two transcript variants of Smoc-1 with RACE and sequencing (Fig. 1 and
Additional file 1), variant-01 of 3474 bp [GenBank:
DQ159955] and variant-02 of 1933 bp [GenBank:
EF446167]. Both the variants encoded for identical proteins but showed differences in their 3'UTR length, polyadenylation signals and Poly(A) tails. In the 3' UTR of
variant-01 & -02, five & two copies of mRNA instability
motif (ATTTA), respectively, were observed. In addition,
there were orthodox polyadenylation signals (AATAAA),
1787 and 334 bp downstream of the translation termination codon, in transcript variant-01 and -02, respectively
(Additional file 1). Interestingly, two types of transcripts
of Smoc-1 have been reported independently in the literature for human [GenBank: AJ249900 and BC011548] and
cattle [GenBank: XM_612029 and NM_01079771]. Database search and multiple nucleotide sequence alignment

02 (5th being the smallest and 12th, the longest one) (Fig.

by one or more exons and the domain border coincide
with the conserved splice sites. Buffalo Smoc-1 differed
from other species in various aspects (Additional file 3),
briefly, exon 8 was found to be more diverse at nucleotide
level whereas exon 2 comprising the follistatin domain

of both the variants showed their conservation across various species (Additional file 2).

was most divergent at amino acid level. Exon 6 was the
most conserved across the species. The buffalo Smoc-1
cross-hybridized to genomic DNA from 13 different species with almost equal signal intensity, confirming its
faithful conservation across the species (Additional file
4A). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated cattle as the closest species followed by human and chimpanzee while dog
was the most distant one (Additional file 4B). In addition,
the buffalo Smoc-1 also showed homology with other species such as birds, rodents and bony fishes (Additional file
4C). Details of the Smoc-1 gene(s) from different species
along with their accession numbers are given in the Table
1.
Domain Organization of Smoc-1
Homology search for the buffalo Smoc-1 protein demonstrated presence of all the domains characteristic to the
BM-40 family (Fig. 3). Accordingly, first 26 amino acids at
the N-terminus conform well to the signal peptide consensus ending with a signal peptidase cleavage site [28].
Mature Smoc-1 comprises of 409 amino acids. Like in the
human, all the essential features of each domain are conserved in buffalo. Since no transmembrane-spanning
hydrophobic domain is present in the sequence, Smoc-1 is
presumably secreted out from the cells. Further scrutiny
allowed the distinction of five modules, an FS domain
(Fig. 3A), a TY domain (Fig. 3B), a Smoc-1 unique domain
(Fig. 3C), a second TY domain (Fig. 3D) and an EC
domain (Fig. 3E). Residues 42–88 are homologous to the

canonical FS domain, composed of two sub-domains
with the second being similar to the Kazal domain. Structure-based alignment showed that all the six cysteines and
the features of secondary structure are conserved in both
the TY domains of buffalo Smoc-1. Further, two TY
domains (residues 89–159 and 222–293) are separated
by 62 amino acids unique to the Smoc-1. Detailed in-silico
analysis unveiled a potential N-glycosylation site at Asn214 and five O-glycosylation sites at Thr-155, -82, -184, 187 and -345 in buffalo Smoc-1. The C-terminus is homologous to the characteristic amphipathic α-helix and the
helix-loop-helix motifs of the ECD of BM-40. However,
based on the in-silico analyses, in contrast to the ECD of
BM-40, both EF-hand motifs of Smoc-1 were found canonical indicating the calcium binding sites (Fig. 3E). Compared to other species, buffalo Smoc-1 showed some
specific alteration like R49K in FS domain and V431 insertion in ECD. Some of these changes were from polar to
non-polar amino acids and vice versa, similar to that in
mouse/rat. In case of human/chimpanzee, these changes
always maintained similar biochemical nature (Fig. 3).
Interesting enough, predicted secondary structure showed
alterations at the N-terminus involving replacement of 8
alpha-helices by equal number of beta-sheets and insertion of 3 helices in FS domain in comparison to other
mammals (Additional file 5).

Single copy of the Smoc-1 gene located on chromosome
11 in buffalo
For copy number status, using SYBR green assay and Real
Time PCR, a straight curve was obtained with a slope -3.2
using 10 fold dilution series of buffalo blood/semen
genomic DNA and FSmoc-1 plasmid as template. Ct
increase of 3.3 per dilution and a single dissociation peak
indicated maximum efficiency and high specificity of the
primer sets. Extrapolation of this standard curve demonstrated the single copy status of the Smoc-1 per haploid
genome in buffalo (Additional file 6). Chromosomal
mapping of the same was also performed using Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) which confirmed the
localization of Smoc-1 gene on the distal end of the acrocentric chromosome 11 in buffalo (Fig. 4).
Recombinant expression of Smoc-1
Affinity-purified recombinant Smoc-1 expressed in E. coli
BL21(DE3) revealed a major band at ~70 kDa in 10%
SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions. The deduced
molecular mass of mature Smoc-1 is 45.4 kDa and remaining ~25 kDa represent GST tag. The Anti-PSmoc1-pAb recognized native protein of ~70 kDa in the western-blot
analysis. Anti-SySmoc-1-pAb generated against commercially synthesized 26 amino acids (69S to 95G) also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/436

showed the similar result (Additional file 7), substantiating its high specificity. The pre-immune serum did not
detect any protein in the western blot (not shown).
Highest expression of Smoc-1 transcript variants in liver
Northern blot analysis showed abundant Smoc-1 transcripts in liver and faint signals in testis and ovary. After
prolonged exposure, the spleen, lung, kidney and heart
also showed negligible to faint signals (Fig. 2). Similarly,
RT-PCR followed by Southern hybridization detected
reduced signals in spleen (Fig. 5A &5B) and negligible
ones in lung, kidney and heart after prolonged exposure
(not shown). Using quantitative expressional analysis, βactin as an internal control and lung cDNA as calibrator,
the highest level of expression of transcript variant-01
(165–364 folds) and -02 (360–697 folds) was observed in
liver (Fig. 5C). This was substantiated further by expression data from the five additional animals. In the same
assay, sperm cDNA showed similar level as that of testis.
However, relatively higher amount (1.2–3.5 folds) of variant-02 was observed in all the tissues examined as compared to that of variant-01 (Fig. 5D). Based on these
observations, the variant-02 may be addressed as "major
transcript" and -01 as "minor" one.

Figure expression of Smoc-1 in liver
Highest expression of Smoc-1 in liver. RT-PCR showed expression in liver only but Southern hybridization detected
reduced signals in testis, ovary and spleen (A) whereas control RT-PCR with β-actin showed almost equal intensity signal in
each tissue (B). Quantitative expression of Smoc-1 based on Real Time PCR confirmed maximum expression (163–364 folds) in
liver in five different animals compared to that in lung used as the calibrator (C). Note the buffalo spermatozoa from four different animals (BS1-4) also showed 4–7 folds transcripts in four different animals, similar to that in testis. Relative quantitation
also demonstrated higher expression (1.2–3.5 times) of variant-02 compared to that of -01 in each of the tissues examined (D).
Western blotting with anti-SySmoc1-pAb (E) and anti-β-actin-mAb as positive control (F) substantiated the highest expression
of Smoc-1 protein in liver. The quantitative expression carried out using cDNA isolated from blood lymphocytes of different
age group of animals is shown in (G). Note the markedly increased expression of Smoc-1 in animals 10 months and beyond.
Relative quantitation showing higher expression of variant-01 in the animal up to ~6 months of age and that of variant-02 in the
animals of age 6 months and beyond (H).

Since all the mRNA transcripts may not translate into protein, the relative quantitation mentioned above was substantiated by the Western blot analysis using total tissue
proteins and anti-SySmoc1-pAb which detected the ~45
kDa bands (mature protein). Interestingly, the strongest
signal was detected in liver and faint ones in testis, ovary
and spleen (Fig. 5E) whereas lung, kidney and heart were
found to be devoid of Smoc-1 protein corroborating the
RT-PCR and relative expressional analysis. As a control,
anti-β-actin-mAb showed almost equal signal intensity in
each tissue (Fig. 5F).
Age specific progression of expression of Smoc-1 in water
buffalo
We report for the first time, expression profile of Smoc-1 in
water buffaloes of varying ages starting from 20 days to 15
years. Lowest expression of Smoc-1 was detected in the
blood lymphocytes of animals aged 20 days with gradual
increase in the expression (1.5–2 times) from 1 month-10
months. However, a sharp enhancement in the expression
(25–30 times) was detected at the age of 1–1.25 years and
this remained consistent up to the age of 15 years and
beyond (Fig. 5G). The dramatic increase in expression of
Smoc-1 at around 1 year of age was further confirmed by
western blotting using anti-SySmoc1-pAb and total pro-

tein isolated from blood samples of the same animals
(not shown).
The comparative expression analysis of the two transcript
variants revealed a gradual increase of the variant-02 compared to that of variant-01 with the progression of age
(Fig. 5H). The expression of variant-01 was higher in animal aged up to ~6 months, after which the variant-02
expression starts increasing gradually during the ages 6 to
15 months and remained consistent thereafter.
Association of Smoc-1 with basement membranes
Smoc-1 was present abundantly in the basement membrane zone of discontinuous endothelial cell layer or the
tunica media around the central veins in liver (Fig. 6A). In
addition, Smoc-1 was found to be ubiquitously distributed
in the connective tissues surrounding each lobule and
extracellular matrices of space of Disse. In testis, Smoc-1
was abundant in the basement membrane zone surrounding coiled seminiferous tubules below the columnar
epididymis and scarcely in the interstitial tissues (Fig. 6B).
Smoc-1 was localized in the zona pellucida of ovary in buffalo (not shown) similar to that in mice. In other tissues
also, it remained localized within the basement membrane zones.

Discussion
Minisatellites have been implicated with gene regulation,
chromosomal fragile sites and genome imprinting [29]
but biological significance of their association with coding transcripts remains largely unresolved. Present study
demonstrates the association of the consensus sequence
of minisatellite 33.15 with the coding sequence of the
Smoc-1 transcript [26]. However, the existing significance
of this association remained unclear.
To date, Smoc-1 has been characterized only in a few
mammals showing variations in domain organization. In
other members of SPARC family, the FS domain is immediately followed by an EC domain [11] whereas in Smoc1, the FS and EC domains are separated by the two TY
domains which are themselves split by the novel Smoc-1
domain [18], thus maintaining its organizational uniqueness amongst SPARC family.
Anticipating the roles of orthologues separated millions
of years ago has always been a difficult proposition, especially in the context of multidomain proteins with frequent insertions or deletions. Thus, biological functions
for FS, TY and EC domains in Smoc-1 are still speculative.
The FS domain is not only the characteristic of BM-40
family, but also found in other follistatin related genes
like C6, C7, agrin, and the transmembrane receptors
TMEFF1 and TMEFF2 [30,31]. Similarly, presence of TY
domain in other proteins [32] makes it difficult to ascertain its function in the Smoc-1. The TY contain six cysteine
residues including a characteristic CWCV tertrapeptide is
also conserved in buffalo Smoc-1 [33]. The high content of
aromatic amino acids in the unique Smoc-1 domain
entails in formation of a folded domain with a hydrophobic core. Presence of two EF hand motifs in ECD of buffalo
Smoc-1 is predicted for its calcium binding affinity as it has
been confirmed experimentally using circular dichroism
in human SMOC-1 [18]. Presence of acidic residues at
positions 1,3,5,9 and 12, and the helix signatures encompassing the calcium binding loops are also conserved for
both EF hand domains in buffalo Smoc-1.
Owing to >90% sequence homology with cattle, human
and other species, buffalo Smoc-1 showed similar arrangement of various domains. Analysis of the gene structure in
buffalo, human and mouse reveals intactness of each
domain border [34] maintaining its reading frame even
when some exon/intron is inserted or deleted. However, a
number of specific alterations at nucleotide and amino
acid levels were found to be unique to buffalo establishing
their species specific organization. Two types of transcripts have been reported independently in GenBank for
human and cattle Smoc-1 (Additional file 2) but their
detailed characterization was lacking. In this study, we
confirmed presence of two variants of this gene varying in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/436

their 3'UTR lengths. This may either be due to the presence of an alternative splice site within the possible
inserted intron (12th) in the 3' region or an alternate splice
site in the existing intron (11th) within the 3'UTR itself.
However, first possibility seems to be invalid since end
point PCR conducted with buffalo genomic DNA using
primers from exon 11 and 12 gave rise to a single band of
the similar size as that with cDNA. Further, analysis has
shown that both the variants have polyadenylation signals followed by poly(A) tail upstream 30 and 16 nucleotides for variants -01 & -02, respectively. This is in
agreement with the fact that the signals are most often
present at 11–30 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A)
tail [35]. However, presence of more copies of mRNA
instability motifs in variant-01, involved in its degradation [36], compared to that in variant -02 supports relatively higher expression of the later.
Previous studies have shown that Smoc-1 mRNA is synthesized even during the early stages of mouse embryonic
development. During the embryonic stage on day 12, and
fetal stages days 14, 16, and 18, the protein is present in
the basement membrane zones of various tissues like
brain, skin, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney etc [19]. But, so
far no report is available on the sustenance of expression
of Smoc-1 during life-span of any of the species. Our work
seems to be the first report showing a remarkable rise in
the Smoc-1 expression during 10–14 months of age in buffaloes, followed by constant level maintained throughout
the life span. As Smoc-1 is involved in cell-matrix interaction and bone mineralization, its fulminant expression at
10 months and beyond signifies its requirement for
growth, development and possible sustenance of the animal.
Buffalo Smoc-1 is a single copy gene, presence of two variants of this gene may signify either for a backup of the
transcripts if one is degraded/mutated or for the enhanced
protein expression. In earlier studies, Smoc-1 mRNA was
reported to be ubiquitously present in all the tissues of
mice, showing abundance in ovary but negligible expression in liver and other tissues [19]. Contrary to this, buffalo liver was enriched with Smoc-1 transcripts as well as
protein whereas other tissues contained fewer or no transcript/protein substantiating species and tissue specificity
of this gene. Liver is primarily involved in vascular functions, metabolic regulation and secretory and excretory
functions. Role of the other basement membrane proteins
like agrin, collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma has been studied
[37] but no report is available on the functional attributes
of Smoc-1 in liver. Buffalo may not be prone to hepatocellular carcinoma. However, since Smoc-1 is conserved
across the species, it may not be inappropriate to study the
expression of this gene in human hepatocellular carci-

noma to ascertain its possible up- or down regulation.
Owing to its involvement in cell proliferation, adhesion
and tissue remodeling, Smoc-1 may also play a pivotal role
in hepatocellular activities.

mammalian species highlighting the possibilities of
future research on its clinical aspects in the context of
human/animal health.

Methods
Smoc-1 has been localized in zona pellucida and extracellular matrix of mouse ovary. This was suggested to be crucial not only for survival of the oocyte but also for
successful fertilization [18]. In this study, the Smoc-1 has
been localized to the extracellular matrix and in the epithelial basement membrane zone of buffalo liver. In addition, staining around the seminiferous tubules and sertoli
cells of testis substantiated the true basement membrane
localization of Smoc-1 protein because the basal lamina of
the seminiferous tubules in bovines is multilayered and
possesses knob like protrusions [38].
The liver contains a unique extracellular matrix (ECM)
within the space of Disse, which consists of basement
membrane constituents as well as fibrillar ECM molecules. Though the basement membranes are mainly
formed by a collagen IV, Laminin-1, and nidogen-1 network [39], the liver derived basement membrane also
contains a unique isoform composition of type IV collagen, known to bind with the Smoc-1 protein [40]. Thus,
Smoc-1 in ECM of buffalo liver seems to have an undisputed significance. Changes in the composition of ECM
may be detrimental for the viability of hepatocytes during
progression of liver cirrhosis. The role of SPARC/
Osteonectin in human hepatocellular carcinoma has been
reported [41]. Owing to its conservation in human and
non-human systems, the fate of Smoc-1 gene may be studied in human liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma
and other liver infections to highlight its clinical aspects.

Conclusion
In the present study, we demonstrated cloning, characterization and expressional analysis of the Smoc-1 in Bubalus
bubalis for the first time and unveiled two transcript variants of this gene. Both the variants showed difference in
their 3' UTR length but the deduced amino acid sequences
were identical. Two EF-hand motifs in the ECD conformed well to its calcium binding affinity and N-glycosylation site at Asn-214 suggesting its glycoprotein nature.
We also detected alterations in Smoc-1 at nucleotide,
amino acid sequences and secondary structure levels
amongst different species. Buffalo Smoc-1 transcript variants showed highest expression in liver demonstrating its
tissue and species specific functions, in contrast to human
and mouse where it expresses to the maximum in the
ovary. The study also demonstrated the age specific
expression of Smoc-1 intimating its role in postnatal development besides embryonic development. This study
seems to be the first description of two transcript variants
and tissue/age specific expression of the Smoc-1 in any

Sample collection and isolation of genomic DNA, total
RNA and cDNA synthesis
Blood and tissue samples of both the sexes of water buffalo were collected from local slaughterhouse, Delhi following strictly the guidelines of Institute's Ethical and
Biosafety Committee. Buffalo semen samples were collected from the local dairy farm. Details of the genomic
DNA from different species used in this study for crosshybridization have been given earlier [26,42]. Total RNA
was isolated from all the tissues, semen and blood samples from different age group of animals using standard
protocols [42]. The cDNA synthesis was conducted using
a commercially available kit (ABI, California, USA) and
confirmed by PCR amplification using a set of bubaline
derived
β-actin
(forward
5'CAGATCATGTTCGAGACCTTCAA3' and reverse 5'GATGATCTTGATC TTCATTGTGCTG 3') primers.
Minisatellite Associated Sequence Amplification (MASA)
with consensus of 33.15 repeat loci
MASA was conducted using 16 nucleotide long oligo (5'
CACCTCTCCACCTGCC 3') primer derived from the consensus sequence of 33.15 repeat loci and cDNA from different tissues. The experimental details of MASA have
been described earlier [26]. MASA uncovered several
bands and one was found to represent partial sequence of
Smoc-1 gene (PSmoc1: GenBank accession no. AY947405),
lacking 5'/3'UTR and signal peptide.
Amplification of full length Smoc-1 CDS using end point
PCR and RACE
Full length Smoc-1 CDS was isolated using four sets of
primers designed from of 5' and 3' regions of the human
and cattle Smoc-1 sequences (GenBank Accession nos.
AJ249900 and XM_612029) respectively using primer3
output [43]. Details of the primer sequences, Tm and corresponding sizes of amplicons are given in the additional
file 8. End point PCR was conducted to amplify 3'UTR
using cattle derived primers (JS275-JS997). The 5' UTR
and polyadenylation signal at 3'UTR were identified using
5' & 3'RACE kits (Invitrogen, USA) and Smoc1-specific
primer J5UTR & JS977/JS997, respectively. All the PCR
reactions were conducted using Vent Polymerase (NEB,
USA) following standard protocols. The amplicons were
analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by cloning and
sequencing. The sequences so obtained were assembled
into full length Smoc-1 (FSmoc-1). To ascertain the possible insertion of intron 12th in 3'UTR, the primers JS990SA991 & JS996-997 were used on buffalo genomic DNA
as template to conduct end point PCR.

Cloning, sequencing, Secondary structure prediction and
phylogenetic delineation
The PCR products were tagged with dTTP and cloned into
pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega, USA). The sequences of all
the fragments were analyzed using Blast Search [44], ClustalW [45] and Gene Runner software. Finally, derived full
length transcripts were submitted in the GenBank (Accession nos. DQ159955 and EF446167). The secondary
structure of predicted protein was ascertained using Phyre
software [46]. The calcium binding affinity, and N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation sites were predicted using
different bioinformatics tools. Based on the homology,
the phylogenetic tree [45] was constructed using Smoc-1
transcript(s) from buffalo and other species (Table 1).
Only those species showing significant homologies
(85–100%) were taken into consideration for phylogenetic analysis.
Cross hybridization of buffalo Smoc-1 gene across the
species
Approximately, 200 ng of heat denatured genomic DNA
from different species was briefly run on 0.8% agarose gel
and transferred onto the nylon membrane. Hybridization
was conducted with labeled PSmoc-1and FSmoc-1 probes
following standard procedure [42].
Metaphase chromosome preparation and Fluorescence in
situ hybridization
Approximately, 400 μl of whole blood from normal buffaloes was cultured for chromosome preparation following standard protocols [47]. Cattle derived BAC clone
(Ctg9.CH240-54I18) representing full length Smoc-1 gene
was used as probe. The clone was labeled with Fluorescein-12-dUTP using Nick Translation Kit from Vysis, (IL,
USA). Fluorescein was detected with biotinylated anti-fluorescein antibody and FITC-avidin DCS (Vector Labs) following prescribed methods [47]. Map position of Smoc-1
gene on the chromosome was carried out following the
International System for Chromosome Nomenclature of
Domestic Bovids (ISCNDB 2000).
Northern blot, RT-PCR and Southern Blotting
For Northern blot analyses, 5–10 μg of total RNA resolved
on the 1% agarose gel was transferred onto the nylon
membrane (Amersham Biosciences, USA). Hybridizations were performed under the high stringent conditions
using standard procedure [26,42]. FSmoc1 probe was
labeled with [32P] α-dCTP using rediprime™ II kit (Amersham Pharmacia biotech, USA). The Northern blot results
were confirmed by RT-PCR with the internal primers
designed from FSmoc-1 (F 5'-GGTTTCTCATAAGTGACCGTGACC-3', R 5'-TGAGATGACCTTGTCC TTGTTCAG3') and cDNA of different tissues as template using thermal profile, 95°C-1 min, 59°C-1 min, 72°C-1 min. The
products were transferred onto the nylon membrane fol-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/436

lowed by hybridization with [32P] α-dCTP labeled FSmoc1
using standard procedures. Bubaline derived β-actin gene
probe and bacterial genomic DNA were used as positive
and negative controls, respectively.
Copy number calculation and quantitative expression
using Real Time PCR
Copy number of Smoc-1 gene was calculated based on
absolute quantitation using SYBR green assay and
Sequence Detection System-7000 (SDS-7000, ABI, USA).
Two primer pairs (Additional file 8) specific to 11th exon
of Smoc-1 were designed using Primer Express Software
V2.0 (ABI, USA). The relative transcription of Smoc-1
across the tissues was assessed using the same primer set
and equal quantity of total cDNA from different tissues
and semen samples of buffalo. The relative expression of
both the transcript variants was studied using three primer
sets, two for both the variants (JSR1015-1018) and one
specific for variant-01 (JSR1033-1034). Age specific
expression was also carried out using cDNA from blood
lymphocytes with the primer sets (JSR1015-1018) which
picked up both the variants and another one JSR10331034 specific for variant-01. The total cDNA amounts
from different tissues were optimized using a set of buffalo β-actin primers (forward 5'TCACGGAGCGTGGCTAC
AG3' and reverse 5'TTGATGTCACGGACGATTTCC 3').
Presence of genomic DNA in the cDNA template was
ruled out by using mRNA as template in several independent Real Time PCR and end point PCR reactions. Each
reaction was repeated three times in triplicates. The details
of the copy number calculation of the Smoc-1 mRNA transcripts have been described earlier [26,48].
Protein Expression and Production of Anti-Smoc-1
Antiserum
Using PSmoc-1 as template, the Smoc-1 was re-amplified
to accommodate a BamHI site at the 5' end (5'CGGGATCCCACCTCTCCACCTGCCCCAGG-3')
and
XhoI site at the 3' end (5'-CCCTCGAGTTAGACGAGGCGTCCTACTTC-3'). The resulting amplicon was cloned
in pGEX-4T1 vector (Novagen, USA) at BamHI/XhoI sites.
Expression of the recombinant GST-tag-Smoc1 in BL21
(DE3) was induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37°C for 4 h and
the recombinant Smoc-1 protein was purified using GSTtag purification resin (Clontech, USA). A rabbit was
immunized with purified recombinant pGEX-4T1PSmoc1 using alum as an adjuvant to obtain the AntiPSmoc-1-pAb. To ensure the specificity, primary antiserum
(Anti-SySmoc1-pAb) was obtained for a commercially synthesized 26 amino acid (69S to 95G) long peptide, conjugated to Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), specific to
Smoc-1 domain.

Immunohistochemistry on Buffalo Tissue Sections
The distribution of Smoc-1 protein in different tissues was
studied on paraffin sections by indirect Immunohistochemistry using Anti-SySmoc1-pAb (generated against
synthesized polypeptide for Smoc-1 as stated earlier).
Freshly prepared buffalo tissues were fixed for 1 hr in 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS and after dehydration, were
embedded in paraffin. Sections were sliced and processed
according to standard procedures [49]. After blocking
with 1% BSA/TBS, the sections were incubated with the
anti-PSmoc1-pAb followed by HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-rad, USA) and detected using Di-amino Benzene (DAB) as substrate [49]. The sections were observed
under BX-51 microscope (Olympus, JAPAN).

Secondary structure of Smoc-1 protein from different species. Predicted secondary structures of Smoc-1 protein in different species. The
replacement of helix formed by 8 residues with the beta-sheets, insertion
of helices and the minor alterations throughout the protein are shown in
red. Changes similar to cattle or human and the ones similar to rat/mouse
or chimpanzee are shown in red and blue, respectively. The additional
coils and helices in mouse and rat are due to bigger coding frame of Smoc1 in these species.
