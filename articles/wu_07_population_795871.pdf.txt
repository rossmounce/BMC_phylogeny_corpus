Abstract
Background: Previously reported evidence indicates that pigs were independently domesticated
in multiple places throughout the world. However, a detailed picture of the origin and dispersal of
domestic pigs in East Asia has not yet been reported.
Results: Population phylogenomic analysis was conducted in domestic pigs and wild boars by
screening the haplogroup-specific mutation motifs inferred from a phylogenetic tree of pig
complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. All domestic pigs are clustered into single
clade D (which contains subclades D1, D2, D3, and D4), with wild boars from East Asia being
interspersed. Three haplogroups within D1 are dominant in the Mekong region (D1a2 and D1b)
and the middle and downstream regions of the Yangtze River (D1a1a), and may represent
independent founders of domestic pigs. None of the domestic pig samples from North East Asia,
the Yellow River region, and the upstream region of the Yangtze River share the same haplogroup
status with the local wild boars. The limited regional distributions of haplogroups D1 (including its
subhaplogroups), D2, D3, and D4 in domestic pigs suggest at least two different in situ
domestication events.
Conclusion: The use of fine-grained mtDNA phylogenomic analysis of wild boars and domestic
pigs is a powerful tool with which to discern the origin of domestic pigs. Our findings show that pig
domestication in East Asia mainly occurred in the Mekong region and the middle and downstream
regions of the Yangtze River.

Background

The origin and dispersal of major domestic animals have been
widely studied in recent years and great progress has been
made [1-18]. Multiple origin has been revealed to be a common phenomenon in domestic animals such as cattle, goats,
chicken, and horses [7-9,12,17,19]. Several studies have
shown that pigs were independently domesticated in various
parts of the world [5,16,20-25]. The time of divergence
between European and Asian pig mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) was long before the time of possible pig domestication,
which supported the independent origin of domestic pigs in
Europe and Asia [5,26]. By analyzing the mtDNA control
region (D-loop) sequences of worldwide wild boars, domestic
pigs, and ancient specimens, recent studies conducted by Larson and coworkers [16,27,28] have revealed a schematic profile concerning the origin of wild boars and their dispersal and
domestication across Eurasia, as well as the Neolithic expansion in Island South East Asia and Oceania. However,
because of the small sample size from East Asia and the limited resolution of phylogeny based on partial mtDNA D-loop
sequences of pigs, a detailed picture of the origin and dispersal of domestic pigs in East Asia is still to be developed.
To investigate where the East Asian pigs were domesticated
and to reconstruct their early dispersal history, we conducted
a population phylogenomic analysis of wild boars and domestic pigs by applying a strategy consisting of the following
steps. First, we sequenced 670 base pair (bp) fragments of the
mtDNA D-loop region in 567 domestic pigs and 155 wild
boars across China, South East Asia, and India. Then, we
selected 24 wild boars and domestic pigs and analyzed their
entire mtDNA sequences. Each of these 24 samples represented a unique haplotype in the major clades observed in a
neighbor-joining (NJ) tree of the 722 D-loop sequences
(Additional data file 1). Employing a strategy that has been
well described by us and others in anthropologic studies [2938], haplogroup-specific mutation motifs (a string of characteristic mutations shared exclusively by its members) for the
respective haplogroups (monophyletic groups or clades in the
tree) were inferred from the phylogenetic tree of 42 (near)
complete Asian pig mtDNA sequences determined in this
study and from published sources. The haplogroup-specific
motifs were further screened in all domestic pigs and wild
boars to justify the inferred haplogroup status of each sample
based on the available information. Finally, all our samples
and previously published mtDNA data were assigned to haplogroups based on the haplogroup-specific mutation motifs in
the sequence. This fine-grained phylogeographic analysis of
matrilineal components of wild boars and domestic pigs provided new insights into the origin and domestication of pigs
in East Asia.

Results and discussion

mtDNA control region sequences (670 bp) of 567 domestic
pigs and 155 wild boars across China, South East Asia, and

India were determined. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis
of the 119 haplotypes of these D-loop sequences was performed and revealed several clades in the tree (Additional
data file 1). Then, the complete mtDNAs of 24 samples of wild
boars and domestic pigs, each representing a unique haplotype in the major clades in this tree, were selected and
sequenced. It should be noted that although the choice of the
specific representative samples within certain clade was
selected at random, each sample from the same clade has
equal potential to allow us to determine the schematic backbone and mutation motif of this clade/haplogroup. The African warthog is well known to be distinct from Eurasian wild
boars and has frequently been used as the outgroup in previous phylogenetic studies of pigs [16,25,26,39-42]. In the
present study we completely sequenced an mtDNA of African
warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and used it as the outgroup to root the mtDNA genome tree.
The NJ tree of 50 mtDNA genomes (including 24 published
near complete sequences; Additional data file 2) revealed two
major clades, E and A, which represent the wild boars (Sus
scrofa) and domestic pigs from Europe and East Asia, respectively (Figure 1). Within clade A, all Asian domestic pig mtDNAs were further clustered into a single clade D, with wild
boars from this region intermingled (Figure 1 and Additional
data file 3). Phylogenetic trees constructed using other methods, such as maximum parsimony and Bayesian estimation,
exhibited similar topology for all major clades in the NJ tree
(Additional data file 4) and further confirmed the monophyletic position of East Asian domestic pigs and wild boars.
The phylogenetic position of the newly sequenced Malaysia
wild boar (Sus barbatus) fell outside the macro-clade containing Eurasian samples.
The information read from the mtDNA genome tree enabled
us to conduct a phylogenomic analysis for wild boars and
domestic pigs. By detecting the haplogroup unique mutation
motif (Additional data file 3), each mtDNA could be allocated
to the smallest named haplogroup to which it belongs. For
instance, haplogroup D1 was characterized by five mutations
at sites 500, 2374, 11432, 12064, 16301, whereas its subhaplogroup D1a was defined further by the additional variant at
site 14198 (Additional data file 3). By screening these haplogroup-specific mutations in each mtDNA, it could reliably be
classified into haplogroup D1 based on the presence of the five
D1 specific mutations and further into D1a if it also harbored
the mutation at site 14198. Based on our established haplogroup classification system, published pig mtDNA cytochrome (Cyt) b and D-loop sequences (Additional data file 5)
were also tentatively classified by haplogroup-specific motif
recognition and/or a matching or near-matching strategy
[30,34,35,38] with the mtDNAs determined in this study.
In agreement with the phylogenetic pattern discerned in the
tree of complete mtDNA sequences, all 1,096 mtDNA
sequences of East Asian wild boars and domestic pigs could

region is given in parentheses. aOnly wild boars are counted. b Feral pigs. cSamples from Ryukyu, Japan. dAncient DNAs. eSequences that could not be

be classified into clade A (Additional data file 5). The wild
boars from Island South East Asia reported in a previous
study by Larson and coworkers [16] could not be assigned
into clades E and A defined in the present study (Additional
data file 5 [Table S5]), confirming their basal phylogenetic
positions [16,28].
The resulting mtDNA haplogroup classification of wild boars
and domestic pigs and their sampling locations revealed sympatric distribution of both wild boars and domestic pigs. Samples from different places/breeds could be grouped into one
haplogroup, whereas samples from the same location were
assigned to different nested haplogroups (Additional data
files 5 and 6, and Tables 1 and 2). Some wild boars from South
Asia fell outside of macro-clade containing clades E and A,
whereas other wild boars from this region could be classified
into clades A and E (Additional data file 4 and 6, and Table 1).
Within East and South East Asia, the matrilineal pool of wild
boars from the Mekong region contained nearly all the main
lineages presented in other regions (Additional data file 6 and
Table 1). Furthermore, genetic diversity of wild boars from
this region was much greater than that in other regions
(except for the upstream region of the Yangtze River [URYZ;
Additional data file 7], in which diversity was comparable but
this region had a different proportion of matrilineal components). Although high diversity in a region may be caused by
influx of haplotypes from different regions, this possibility

might be very low here because it also applies to other
regions, whereas we failed to observe many centers of
diversity.
Most wild boars from the middle and downstream region of
the Yangtze River (MDYZ) were clustered into the nested
haplogroups within haplogroup A1a, particularly in haplogroup D (Additional data file 6 and Table 1). All wild boars
from North East Asia (NEA) belonged to haplogroup D (Additional data file 6 and Table 1), suggesting potential derivation
from the matrilineal pool of region MDYZ caused by the natural movement of wild boar. Wild boar lineages from the
upstream and middle region of the Yellow River (UMYR)
were a subset of region URYZ (Additional data file 6 and
Table 1). Overall, the population structure of URYZ and
UMYR were distinct from MDYZ and NEA populations; both
URYZ and UMYR populations contained more basal lineages,
whereas the MDYZ and NEA populations harbored a large
proportion of recently derived lineages (Additional data file 6
and Table 1). Under the hypothesis of selective neutrality and
population equilibrium, Tajima's D and Fu's Fs test values
tend to be negative under an excess of recent mutations,
which is regarded as evidence of population growth [43,44].
The P values of the Fs test established by Fu [43] for all wild
boar samples belonging to haplogroups D1 and D all indicated
statistical significance (Table 3), suggesting population
expansion in the past. Taken together, the above haplogroup

distribution pattern suggests that East Asian wild boar lineages were most likely derived from the Mekong region population and dispersed via two main routes: one route is through
the Yangtze River region to NEA, and the other is through
URYZ to UMYR (Additional data file 6). The difference
between the current population structures of wild boars in
these regions might be shaped by the early dispersal of the
wild boars out of the Mekong region.
Our classification analysis of the published Ryukyu island
wild boar samples suggested that none of these samples
belonged to haplogroup D, which was dominant in the adjacent regions, such as MDYZ, Taiwan, and Japanese islands
(Additional data files 5 and 6). This unique distribution pattern might be attributed to insufficient sampling of Ryukyu
island wild boars, or wild boars might have dispersed to
Ryukyu Islands before the arrival of haplogroup D and were
subsequently isolated from the adjacent regions. This latter
scenario is consistent with the suggestion of a different origin
of wild boars in Japanese islands and Ryukyu islands [45].
In the phylogenetic tree of complete mtDNA sequences, all
East Asian domestic pig mtDNAs were clustered into single
subclade D, with wild boars from this region interspersed
(Figure 1 and Additional data files 3 and 4). The haplogroup
classification of all available East Asian domestic pigs also
uniformly referred to haplogroup D, which contains four subhaplogroups: D1, D2, D3, and D4. However, only part of wild
boar samples in this region could be allocated to haplogroup
D (Additional data files 5 and 6, and Table 1). This pattern
suggests that East Asian domestic pigs originated from a subset of the wild boar genetic pool that was characterized by
haplogroup D. Direct comparison of the geographic distribution between wild boars and domestic pigs can provide clues
regarding the domestication of East Asian pigs. All domestic
pig samples from regions NEA, URYZ, UMYR, and the downstream region of the Yellow River (DRYR), clustered within
haplogroup D1 (Additional data file 6 and Figure 2). The wild
boars from region NEA belonged to haplogroups D3 and D1f
(excluding one unique yet unassigned D1 haplotype because
of absence of coding region information), and did not share
any haplotype with all of the domestic pigs from this region
(Figure 2, Tables 1 and 2, and Additional data files 5 and 6).
None of the 32 wild boars from region UMYR belonged to
haplogroup D1 (Additional data file 6 and Table 1), although
archeologic assemblages from this region exhibit signs of pig
domestication during the Neolithic period [46]. Among the
32 wild boars from region URYZ, only one individual could be
assigned to D1 (Additional data file 6 and Table 1). In contrast, the wild boars in the Mekong region and region MDYZ
extensively shared haplotypes with domestic pigs that were
clustered into different haplogroups (Figure 2 and Additional
data files 5 and 6): haplogroups D2, D3, D4, D1a2, D1b, and
D1c contained both wild boars and domestic pigs from the
Mekong region; and haplogroups D1a1a, D1d, and D1e contained both wild boars and domestic pigs from region MDYZ.

Wu et al. R245.6

These distinct phylogeographic patterns of wild boars and
domestic pigs indicate that domestication events might have
occurred mainly in the Mekong region and the MDYZ region.
The limited regional distributions of some haplogroups in
domestic pigs, such as D2, D3, and D4, would suggest in situ
domestication (Additional data file 6 and Table 2). Domestic
pigs belonging to haplogroups D2, D3, and D4 were mainly
found in the Mekong region, whereas only a small portion of
domestic pigs (three samples) belonging to these three haplogroups was found in region MDYZ. Furthermore, wild boars
from the Mekong region harbored lineages belonging to all
three haplogroups, whereas wild boars from other places only
contained one or two of the three haplogroups (Additional
data file 6). None of 12 South Asian wild boars from a previous study [16] could be assigned to haplogroup A1 (including
its subhaplogroups), suggesting that they made no contribution to domestic pigs in haplogroups D2, D3, and D4. Four
out of six Indian domestic samples belonged to haplogroups
D2 and D3 (the other two domestic samples had same A* status as wild boars from this region and the one reported by
Larson and coworkers [16] shared an A* haplotype with the
wild boars from this region; see Additional data file 5 [Tables
S1 and S6]); and nine Australian feral pigs, seven New Zealand domestic pigs, and three European domestic pigs could
be classified into D2, D3, and D4. It is possible that these lineages were derived from the same matrilineal pool with the
domestic pigs from the Mekong region (Additional data file
6). The distinguished regional distribution pattern of haplogroups D2, D3, and D4 in domestic pigs and wild boars suggested that they probably originated from the Mekong region
and/or adjacent regions that we did not sample in the present
study.
Haplogroup D1 harbors more than 90% of the domestic animals, which were widely distributed in various regions in East
Asia (Table 2, and Additional data files 5 and 6). The regional
distribution of the main founders belonging to this haplogroup was depicted in a reduced median network (Figure 2).
The main subhaplogroups in haplogroup D1 were almost
equidistant to their coalescent ancestral root type. Some of
them, such as haplogroups D1a1a, D1a2, and D1b, exhibited a
star-like profile that was typical of exponential population
growth. Each of these haplogroups harbored one or two
widely distributed major haplotypes, which were also found
in wild boars and had many one-mutation or two-mutation
distance derivatives that were detected exclusively in domestic pigs. Our estimations for domestic pigs in the major haplogroups within D all revealed negative Tajima's D and Fu's Fs
test values (not including D4 and D1c). The P values of the Fs
test indicated statistical significance for haplogroups D1a1a
(Tajima's D test was also statistically significant for this haplogroup), D1a2, and D1b, suggesting potential population
expansion in the past (Table 3). Taken together, haplotypes
within each of these haplogroups might have originated from
their major (central) haplotypes as results of domestication

Reduced median network
Reduced median network. Shown is a reduced median network of domestic pig and wild boar mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) belonging to haplogroup
D1 based on the sequence variation of control region and coding region fragments. The mtDNA control region fragment covers the region from 1 to 670,
and the coding region fragments cover regions 1860 to 2400, 3030 to 3800, 3940 to 4520, 4730 to 5340, 5530 to 6175, 6410 to 7920, 8045 to 11470,
12050 to 12675, 14121 to 14617, and 14730 to 16176 relative to the reference sequence EF545567. These samples are from the Mekong region, the
upstream region of the Yangtze River (URYZ), the middle and downstream region of the Yangtze River (MDYZ), South China (SC), the upstream and
middle region of the Yellow River (UMYR), the downstream region of the Yellow River (DRYR), North East Asia (NEA), Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
and other places. Each haplotype is represented by a circle, with the area of the circle proportional to its frequency. The haplotype with an asterisk is the
coalescent root type of D1. Samples from different regions were indicated by different colors. The length of each branch is proportional to the number of
mutations on the respective branch.

events followed by subsequent expansion. Tracing the geographic distribution pattern of these haplogroups might
reveal more information about the domestication events, as
discussed below.
Most of the domestic pigs in haplogroups D1a2 and D1b were
from the Mekong region and the URYZ region, whereas wild
boars in these two haplogroups were exclusively from the
Mekong region (Additional data file 6, Figure 2, and Tables 1
and 2). A small portion of domestic pigs (18.5%) in region
UMYR belonged to D1a2 and shared haplotypes (excluding
two D1a2 individuals) with samples from the Mekong region.
However, there are only a few domestic pigs from region
MDYZ in haplogroups D1a2 and D1b (three D1a2 types and
three D1b types; all sharing haplotypes with the samples from
the Mekong region). None of the domestic pigs in the other

regions, such as South China (SC), region DRYR, and region
NEA, belonged to D1a2 and D1b. This unique genetic pattern
of haplogroups D1a2 and D1b suggested that they might have
originated in the Mekong region and then dispersed northward to regions URYZ and UMYR (Additional data file 6 and
Figure 2). The shared D1a2 and D1b mtDNA types between
the MDYZ region and the Mekong region might have been
introduced from the Mekong region after the initial
domestication.
More than half of the domestic pigs in haplogroup D1a1a were
from regions DRYR and MDYZ (Additional data file 6, Figure
2, and Table 2). Fourteen wild boars in haplogroup D1a1a
were only found in region MDYZ. Domestic pigs in region
MDYZ also possessed a greater number of D1a1a haplotypes
and unique haplotypes than did samples from other regions

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R245

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/11/R245

Genome Biology 2007,

(Table 2). Thus, the D1a1a domestic pigs might have originated from the wild boar population in region MDYZ, which
was regarded as one of the origin and dispersal centers of cultivated rice and the agriculture civilization of East Asia [4749]. Most of the domestic individuals from regions NEA and
DRYR shared haplotypes with pigs from region MDYZ, which
suggested that domestic pigs from these two regions were
most likely derived from the MDYZ pool (Additional data file
6 and Figure 2).
By reanalyzing them with previously reported data, the new
data generated in the present study could yield some valuable
insights into pig origin in Japan and Vietnam. Pig husbandry
was interrupted from the 8th century to the late 19th century
on mainland Japan [50]. Evidence of the origin of Japanese
domestic pigs was mainly estimated from cultural records
and ancient DNA studies. Recent studies of ancient DNA conducted in pig and wild boar remains from the Japanese mainland and islands suggested that Japanese domestic pigs were
introduced from China [15,50,51].
Based on the haplogroup classification system established in
this study, the Sakhalin pig ancient DNAs from the Kabukai A
site (centuries 5 to 8 AD) of the Okhotsk cultural area [51] and
the ancient DNAs from the Jomon period (6,100 to 1,700
years old) [15] could be classified: 16 haplotypes fell outside
haplogroup D; ten haplotypes belonged to haplogroupd D but
could not be assigned into its defined subhaplogroups; and
five, one, and four haplotypes belonged to haplogroups D3,
D4, and D1, respectively (Additional data file 5 [Table S3]).
None of these ancient DNAs shared haplotypes with East
Asian domestic pigs (excluding one sequence that shared a
haplotype with domestic pigs; Additional data file 6 and Additional data file 5 [Table S3]). Similar matrilineal components
were also found among local wild boars (Additional data file
6). Therefore, most of these ancient DNAs were more closely
related to local and North East Asia wild boars than to East
Asia domestic pigs. Ancient DNA of Sus scrofa specimens
from Ryukyu Shimizu shell midden (Yayoi-Heian period;
1,700 to 2,000 before present) [50] and Ryukyu wild boars
belonged to haplogroup A1b, which diverged earlier than haplogroup D (Table 1 and Additional data file 6). It is thus clear
that these ancient DNA might not be the domestic pigs introduced from the Asian continent in the early Yayoi-Heian
period. More archaeologic evidence and genetic data from
Japan and its adjacent continental regions are necessary to
refine further the origin of Japanese domestic pigs.
A previous study of pigs in Vietnam showed that large Vietnamese pigs were wild boars and had close genetic affinity to
Ryukyu wild boars, whereas small Vietnamese pigs were
domestic pigs and closely related to East Asian domestic pigs,
suggesting a local domestication or direct introduction from
Southwest China [52]. Reanalysis of these data showed that
large Vietnamese pigs shared the same lineage (A1b) with the
Ryukyu wild boars and wild boars from the Mekong region,

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R245

Wu et al. R245.8

URYZ, and UMYR (Additional data file 5 [Table S1]). Among
the haplotypes identified in small Vietnamese pigs, one haplotype belonged to D1a1a and the other haplotypes belonged
to haplogroups presented in the Mekong region, such as D3
and D1b (Additional data file 5 [Table S1]). Six haplotypes
were also found in small pigs from Yunnan, China, and pigs
from Laos (Additional data file 5 [Table S1]). Our reanalysis
of these Vietnamese pig mtDNAs further demonstrated that
large pigs and small pigs from this region had different matrilineal components; thus, in general it supports the previous
claim that small Vietnamese pigs were introduced from China
and the Mekong region, whereas large Vietnamese pigs were
local wild boars [52].

Conclusion

In the present study, use of a phylogeny of complete mtDNA
sequences allowed us to conduct a fine-grained phylogeographic analysis of the Asian domestic pigs and wild boars
and to reappraise the published data. This approach could
also be utilized to elucidatde the origin of other domestic
animals such as chicken, cattle, sheep, and goats. Our findings indicate that the current domestic pig regional pools in
East Asia originated from a subset of wild boar matrilineal
components belonging to haplogroup D. These major matrilineal components in domestic pigs, such as D2, D3, D4, D1b,
and D1a2, were probably domesticated in the Mekong region.
Region MDYZ might also be a domestication center for lineages in D1a1a, D1d, and D1e. The initial domesticated pool
was composed of a number of founders (at least ten) and
underwent subsequent northward dispersal but with limited
admixture.

Materials and methods
Samples
In total, 567 domestic pigs and 155 wild boars from China,
South East Asia, and India were collected and analyzed for
mtDNA control region sequence variation. Among them, 24
samples (not including one African warthog [Phacochoerus
africanus] and a wild boar sample from Maylasia [Sus barbatus]; Additional data file 2) were selected for complete
mtDNA sequencing. The published pig and wild boar mtDNA
sequences in Asia [5,15,16,26,28,40,41,45,51-61] were
retrieved from GenBank and were reanalyzed (Additional
data file 5). The ancient DNA sequences from Japanese
islands [15,51] were only scored according to the haplotype
information because the precise number of individuals sharing a haplotype was not listed in the original reports or GenBank deposits.

DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood, tissue, and/
or hair using the standard phenol/chloroform method. The
mtDNA control region sequence (670 bp) was amplified using
primer pair H695 (5'-CTCTTGCTCCACCATCAGC-3') and

L99 (5'-AAACTATATGTCCTGAAACC-3'). Complete mtDNA
sequences were amplified and sequenced using different
combinations of 36 to 40 pairs of primers (Additional data file
8). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified
on spin columns (Watson BioTechnologies, Shanghai, China)
and sequenced by using BigDye Terminator sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). Sequencing was performed on a 377 and 3700 DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems). Sequences were edited by using the
DNASTAR software (DNAstar Inc. Madison, Wisconsin,
USA) and mutations were scored relative to a reference
sequence (individual Saba722; accession number EF545567)
determined in the present study. All mtDNA D-loop and complete genome sequences have been submitted to GenBank
(accession numbers DQ409327, DQ496251 to DQ497000,
and EF545567 to EF545593).

Phylogenetic analysis
An unrooted NJ tree was initially constructed based on the
haplotypes (670 bp fragments) in all 722 samples. Twentyfour samples of wild boars and domestic pigs, each representing a unique haplotype from the major clades in the NJ tree,
were selected for complete mtDNA sequencing. An African
warthog was sequenced and used as the outgroup for phylogenetic analyses of the complete mtDNA sequences. The phylogenetic consensus tree of 50 mtDNA complete and near
complete sequences (one warthog, one Malaysia wild boar,
six European pigs and wild boars [note that sequences
AF034253 and NC_000845 [56] should refer to the same
sample], and 42 Asian pigs and wild boars; Additional data
file 2) was constructed by using the NJ method in Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) 4.0 β [62] with the
model of HKY + I + G (shape α = 1.0714; Pinvar = 0.7512), as
recommended by Modeltest 3.6 [63]. The maximum parsimony tree of these mtDNA sequences was constructed by
using the branch-and-bound search with a tree bisectionreconnection (TBR) branch-swapping option in PAUP.
Robustness of the nodes was assessed by the bootstrap
method after 1,000 replications (bootstrap option with heuristic search in PAUP) by adding sequences randomly. Bayesian inference tree was constructed by MrBayes 3.1 [64] with
the general time reversible (GTR) model. In an initial run, the
likelihood of the cold chain stopped increasing and began to
fluctuate randomly within a more or less stable range after
10,000 generations; this suggests that the run may have
reached stationarity. Three independent runs (each with 1
million generations) were performed. Each run was started
from a randomly chosen but different tree. All of these runs
yielded similar estimates of substitution model parameters,
topology, and branch lengths (Additional data file 4).

Haplogroup classification
We denoted the principal clades (or haplogroups) that
emerged in the phylogenetic tree by capital letters (for example, clade E [European] and clade A [Asian]). For the prominent clade containing all East Asian domestic pigs and some

Volume 8, Issue 11, Article R245

Wu et al. R245.9

wild boars, we designated it by the capital letter D. For other
subclades of clade A and the subclades within D, a hierarchical haplogroup nomination system was used, as for human
mtDNA [30,32-34]. Thus, the code signifies the nested haplogroup relationships (for example, D1a1a ⊂ D1a1 ⊂ D1a ⊂ D1⊂
D ⊂ A1a ⊂ A1 ⊂ A.
Each haplogroup was composed of a cohort mtDNAs that
shared a string of characteristic mutations, which could be
read from the complete mtDNA tree [29,30,32,36,37] (Additional data file 3). We screened the haplogroup-specific mutations in all of our samples to justify the haplogroup
assignment of each sample. If a mtDNA could be assigned to
a haplogroup but could not be further assigned to its specific
subhaplogroups, then an asterisk (*) is attached to the haplogroup name that refers to the mtDNA under consideration, in
order to emphasize that the haplogroup status of the mtDNA
cannot be specified further (relative to the classification tree)
[33,34]. For example, haplogroup A has two named subhaplogroups A1 and A2, and the Indian wild boars could be
assigned to haplogroup A based on the available sequence
variation information, but they could not be further assigned
to A1 or A2 and lacked the necessary mtDNA coding region
information to identify a new haplogroup nested in A. Therefore, they were left unassigned and denoted A*. Thus, A* contains all mtDNAs that were grouped into A but fell outside A1
and A2 (A* = A - A1 - A2).
After each mtDNA was classified into its respective haplogroup (Additional data file 5), the haplogroup distribution
frequency in each geographic region (see below) was estimated. The published pig mtDNA Cyt b sequences [5,45] were
tentatively assigned to haplogroups according to the established classification system. The reported partial mtDNA Dloop sequences [5,15,16,26,40,41,45,51-55,58,59,65] were
also classified by a matching or near matching strategy with
the mtDNAs determined in this study as well as by mutation
motif recognition, as described in human mtDNA studies
[30,34,35,38].

Geographic group classification
We grouped the samples into the following groups according
to geographic fauna and possible pig domestication sites
(Additional data file 6 and Figure 2). The Mekong region
includes northwest, south and southeast Yunnan, China,
Burma, Laos, north Vietnam, and north Thailand. Region
URYZ includes Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, north and
northeast Yunnan, northwest Guangxi, west Hebei, and
northwest Hunan. Region MDYZ includes east Hubei, northeast Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and
Shanghai. Fourth, region SC includes Guangdong, south and
southeast Guangxi, south Hunan, southwest Fujian, and
Hainan. Region UMYR includes Gansu, east Qinghai, northwest Sichuan, south Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Shaanxi,
Shanxi, and west Henan. Region DRYR includes east Henan,
Hebei, and Shandong. Region NEA includes Jilin, Liaoning,

To provide more detailed information on the phylogeographic relationship among the wild boars and domestic pigs
belonging to haplogroup D1, which contained most of the
samples analyzed in this study, a reduced median network
[66] was constructed by using Network 4.1 [67].

Estimation of population expansion
Tajima's D test [44] and Fu's Fs test [43] was employed to test
whether neutrality holds (the population under study evolves
with a constant effective population size, all mutations being
selectively neutral) by using Arlequin 3.1 [68]. A population
that has experienced population expansion may result in a
rejection of the null hypothesis. We also estimated the haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) [69] for main
haplogroups nested in D1 using DnaSP 4.0 [70].
