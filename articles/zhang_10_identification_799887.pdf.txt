Identification and analysis of unitary
pseudogenes: historic and contemporary gene
losses in humans and other primates
Zhengdong D Zhang1, Adam Frankish2, Toby Hunt2, Jennifer Harrow2, Mark Gerstein1,3,4*

Abstract
Background: Unitary pseudogenes are a class of unprocessed pseudogenes without functioning counterparts in
the genome. They constitute only a small fraction of annotated pseudogenes in the human genome. However, as
they represent distinct functional losses over time, they shed light on the unique features of humans in primate
evolution.
Results: We have developed a pipeline to detect human unitary pseudogenes through analyzing the global
inventory of orthologs between the human genome and its mammalian relatives. We focus on gene losses along
the human lineage after the divergence from rodents about 75 million years ago. In total, we identify 76 unitary
pseudogenes, including previously annotated ones, and many novel ones. By comparing each of these to its
functioning ortholog in other mammals, we can approximately date the creation of each unitary pseudogene (that
is, the gene ‘death date’) and show that for our group of 76, the functional genes appear to be disabled at a fairly
uniform rate throughout primate evolution - not all at once, correlated, for instance, with the ‘Alu burst’.
Furthermore, we identify 11 unitary pseudogenes that are polymorphic - that is, they have both nonfunctional and
functional alleles currently segregating in the human population. Comparing them with their orthologs in other
primates, we find that two of them are in fact pseudogenes in non-human primates, suggesting that they
represent cases of a gene being resurrected in the human lineage.
Conclusions: This analysis of unitary pseudogenes provides insights into the evolutionary constraints faced by
different organisms and the timescales of functional gene loss in humans.

Background
Pseudogenes (ψ) are nongenic DNA segments that exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity to functional
genes but contain disruptive defects. The initial pseudogenization of a functional gene is most likely a single
mutagenic event that results in premature stop codons,
abolished splice junctions, shifts to the coding frame, or
impaired transcriptional regulatory sequences. Most
pseudogenes are disabled copies of a functional ‘parent’
gene and can be classified as either processed or duplicated pseudogenes depending on whether they are generated by the retro-transposition of processed mRNA
transcripts or the duplication of gene-containing DNA
segments in the genome. Recently, the pseudogene

complement of the human genome has been investigated both in gene family-specific studies [1-4] and in
comprehensive surveys [5-7]. Of the approximately
20,000 pseudogenes identified in early studies, most, if
not all, do not represent the extinction of a function as
their ‘parent’ genes are intact and functional.
A third group of pseudogenes particularly relevant to
functional analyses are unitary pseudogenes, which are
unprocessed pseudogenes with no functional counterparts. They are generated by disruptive mutations occurring in functional genes and prevent them from being
successfully transcribed or translated. They differ from
duplicated pseudogenes in that the disabled gene had an
established function rather than being a more recent
copy of a functional gene. The initial analysis of the
euchromatic sequence of the human genome identified
37 unitary pseudogene candidates [8]. In addition to

unitary pseudogenes with fixed disruptive nucleotide
substitutions, human genes with polymorphic disruptive
sites that are currently segregating in the human population have also been indentified [8-10], and many of
them provide the genetic bases of certain inheritable
diseases [11]. Such gene deactivation, which happens in
situ giving rise to a unitary pseudogene, results in a loss
to the functional part of the genetic repertoire of the
organism. Polymorphic pseudogenes are unlikely to
become fixed in a population if the gene loss is deleterious. However, various evolutionary processes, such as
genetic drift, migration (population bottleneck), and in
some cases, natural selection, can lead to fixation. A
number of genes are known to have been lost in the
human lineage in comparison with other mammals
[4,12-15].
In this study, we develop a novel comparative genomic approach to identify genes disabled in situ without
a functional copy (unitary pseudogenes) using the
absence of human proteins orthologous to their mouse
counterparts as the signals of losses of well-established
genes. Our method is able to systematically detect the
sequence signature left by such genic losses, distinguishing true loss from mere loss of redundant genes
following duplication or retrotransposition. We identify
historic and contemporary losses of protein-coding
genes in the human lineage since the last common
ancestor of euarchontoglires (primates and rodents). In
addition to pseudogenes in tandem gene families, we
identify 76 losses of well-established genes in the
human lineage since the common ancestor with
mouse. Moreover, we also find 11 genes with polymorphic disruptive sites. This latter set represents
gene losses on a very different timescale: the genic and
pseudogenic alleles are segregating in the current
human population and are subject to various evolutionary forces.

To take advantage of rich genomic annotation available for mouse, our study uses the mouse gene set as
the reference to identify genes that have been lost in the
human lineage since the divergence of these two species.
Using the InParanoid [16] human-mouse orthologous
gene set, we find 6,236 mouse proteins without discernible human orthologs. The presence of these unique
mouse proteins indicates, most likely, both gene gains in
the mouse lineage and gene losses in the human one.
There are 2,005 unique mouse proteins that cannot be
aligned to the human genome and thus are likely to be
gene gains in the mouse. For the remaining unique
mouse proteins that can be aligned, we found disruptions to the putative human coding sequences in 974
sequence alignments. Subsequent removal of redundancy reveals 612 potentially pseudogenic loci; 187 loci
are removed from the list because they are identified
based on predicted or modeled mouse genes, whose
validity cannot be easily verified; 94 loci are also
removed without further consideration as their identifications are based on unspliced mouse transcribed
sequences labeled as ‘expressed’ or ‘RIKEN cDNA’
sequences. The filtering steps leave 258 loci based on
annotated mouse genes and 73 of these are based on
spliced mouse ‘expressed’ or ‘RIKEN cDNA’ sequences.
Manual inspection of each of the remaining 331 pseudogenic loci removes 113 false positives (such as ones
found in short, low-quality sequence alignments) and
confirms the presence of 228 disabled human genes,
which include 122 pseudogenes in large gene families,
81 possible fixed human unitary pseudogenes, and
15 likely segregating human pseudogenes. After removing five human fixed pseudogenes that are not in
regions syntenic to those of their mouse orthologs and
four segregating pseudogenes whose identifications are
attributed to the sequence errors in the human reference genome, we identify 87 unitary pseudogenes, of
which 76 are fixed and 11 still segregating in the human
population (Figure 1b).

Gene loss is indicated by the absence of orthologs

After a speciation event, the increasing divergence
between two resultant species reflects the diminution in
their genic orthology as gains and losses of genes gradually accumulate in each of them. Thus, the presence of
genes unique to one species relative to another indicates
either gene gains in one or gene losses in the other. In
common with many other genomic features, genes in all
species are in a state of flux during evolution. However,
since all species are related to one another through speciation, gains and losses of genes in one species can be
identified only relative to another. Based on this observation, we developed a pipeline that uses the orthologous relationship between genes from a pair of species
to detect gene losses in one of them.

Many genes were lost in the human lineage since the
human-mouse divergence

Using the human-mouse genic orthology, we identify
228 pseudogenic loci - about 1% of the human gene catalog - in the human genome, which include 98 olfactory
receptors, 23 vomeronasal receptors, and 1 zinc finger
protein. The large number of olfactory receptors and
vomeronasal receptors found in our study is consistent
with previous observations [17,18]. These gene families
form tandem gene clusters and have experienced copy
number changes and complex local rearrangements.
Because the dynamics of gene clusters make it difficult
to unambiguously discern ortholog/paralog relationships
between species, it is difficult to discern the ‘unitary’

status of the olfactory receptor/vomeronasal receptor/
zinc finger pseudogenes (Table S1 in Additional file 1)
and thus they are excluded from further analyses in this
study.
We found 76 gene losses in the human lineage since
the human-mouse divergence (Table 1; see Table S2 in
Additional file 1 for more information). Of these, 31 are
identified through uncharacterized mouse genes. Some
are previously identified human unitary pseudogenes,
such as pseudogenes of gulonolactone (L-) oxidase
(GULO), an enzyme that produces the precursor to vitamin C [19], urate oxidase (UOX), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin [15], and
Farnesoid × receptor beta, a nuclear receptor for lanosterol [4]. In addition, we also confirm the human-specific loss of cardiotrophin-2 (CTF2) due to a frameshift to
its coding sequence caused by an 8-bp deletion [20],
and hyaluronoglucosaminidase 6 (HYAL6) with two frameshift-causing deletions [21].
Most of the 76 gene losses occurred in gene families
with multiple members: of the 47 examples that are
orthologous to annotated mouse genes and whose synteny with their mouse orthologs can be identified with
confidence; half of them are from gene families with
more than six members (Figure 2). There is, however,
no correlation between the size of gene families and the
number of unitary pseudogenes from them. At one
extreme, pseudogenes of GULO, major urinary protein
(MUP), nephrocan (NEPN), neurotrophin receptor associated death domain (NRADD), threonine aldolase 1
(THA1), and UOX do not have any closely related paralogs. These genes are particularly intriguing as there are
no alternatives with similar sequences and, as such, they
represent unequivocal losses of biological functions.
Below we examine NEPN and MUP in more detail as
two case studies.
In a recent study, Mochida et al. showed NEPN is a
secreted N-glycosylated protein inhibitor of transforming growth factor-b signaling in mouse and also identified putative NEPN gene orthologs in pig, dog, rat, and
chicken [22]. The human ortholog was not found, and
its absence was postulated to be a missed identification
due to a lesser homology with its counterparts in other
mammals. As this study and a previous one [23] demonstrate, however, despite the lack of a closely related
homolog in the human genome, NEPN is a pseudogene
not only in human but also in chimpanzee, gorilla, and
rhesus with a shared coding sequence (CDS) disruptive
mutation; thus, its inactivation occurred at least 30 millions of years ago, before the divergence between the
catarrhines and the New World monkeys.
Except for MUP [24], which is a unitary pseudogene
only in human, all other five genes - GULO, NEPN,
NRADD, THA1, and UOX - were inactivated at least

before the separation of human and chimpanzee (see
below). Our study shows that human MUP was inactivated by a splice-junction mutation (GT to AT) located
at the splice donor site of its second intron (Figure 3).
This ORF-disrupting mutation in MUP is not seen in
any other mammals whose genome sequences are available for examination. Using complete (or nearly complete) MUP gene sequences from human, chimpanzee,
orangutan, rhesus and marmoset, we reconstruct the
gene sequences at ancestral nodes in its primate phylogeny and calculate the KA/KS ratio along each lineage.
The KA/KS ratio ranges from 0.36 to 0.58 and averages

out to 0.54, an elevated value compared with 0.12, the
median KA /K S ratio of protein-coding genes between
human and mouse [25]. A recent study showed the
MUP protein in mice is a pheromone ligand that promotes aggressive behaviors through its binding to the
Vmn2r putative pheromone receptors (V2Rs) of the
accessory olfactory neural pathway and, compared to
other mammals being examined, there is a co-expansion
of MUPs and V2Rs in mouse, rat, and opossum [24].
Our analysis shows all human V2Rs have been inactivated, corroborating previous studies, which revealed
V2Rs are also lost in other primates [18,24]. Thus, the

pseudogenization of human MUP and the overall accelerated nonsynonymous substitution rate in MUP of primates suggest it could be a direct result of the loss of
the V2Rs, its specific receptors.
Hydrolase-related activity and structure are enriched in
human unitary pseudogenes

Before pseudogenization, the protein products of these
human unitary pseudogenes played diverse molecular
functional roles in many different biological processes at
various cellular locations as seen in their mouse counterparts. To determine whether there is an enrichment
of labels in any of these three aspects of annotation, we
test for Gene Ontology (GO) term association in the
functional mouse counterparts of the human unitary
pseudogenes on the GO hierarchy using Fisher’s exact
test. After correcting for multiple hypothesis tests to
control the false discovery rate, we found significant
enrichment of one biological process term, the integrinmediated signaling pathway, and six molecular function
terms, which are all specialized hydrolase activity (Figure

4a, b), among the mouse orthologs of the human unitary
pseudogenes. The annotation shows that if functional,
nine human unitary pseudogenes would encode for
endopeptidases. Further examination shows five of them
- transmembrane protease, serine 8 (intestinal) and 11,
and three unnamed RIKEN cDNA genes - have the serine-type endopeptidase activity, and the other four - a
disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM) 1, 3,
5, and 26 - have the metalloendopeptidase activity. Protein domain analysis shows that two Pfam domains reprolysin family propeptide and reprolysin (M12B)
family zinc metalloprotease - are enriched in the human
unitary pseudogenes (Figure 4c). Both of them are
found in the ADAM unitary pseudogenes.
Compared with mouse, human has lost five testis-specific genes: testicular cell adhesion molecule 1
(TCAM1), testis expressed gene 16 (TEX16), testis
expressed gene 21 (TEX21), testis-specific serine kinase
5 (TSSK5), and cytochrome c, testis (CYCT) [2]. The
losses of these testis-specific genes in the human lineage
may have affected the distinctive processes that occur in

male germinal cells [26] and thus contributed to the differentiated fertility between two lineages.
Gene loss has occurred throughout primate evolution

To estimate the time when functional genes were disabled to give rise to the human unitary pseudogenes, we
identify the earliest shared ORF-disrupting mutations
between humans and other mammals on the mammalian species tree. Very few pseudogenic mutations are
shared outside of the primate clade. The most recent
lineages where the occurrence of the pseudogenic mutations in the 47 annotated human unitary pseudogenes
can generate their observed sharing pattern are illustrated on a primate phylogeny (Figure 5a). Such shared
mutations indicate the pseudogenization events happened at every stage during primate evolution: from the
human lineage alone to the last common ancestor of the
great apes, the Old World monkeys, the New World
monkeys, and the tarsiers.

One interesting case is the evolution of NR1H5 in primates. A previous study of the nuclear receptor pseudogenes [4] has shown that NR1H5 is a pseudogene in
human, chimpanzee, and rhesus monkey with three (out
of 14 in total) disruptive mutations - one frame-shift
mutation and one splice-junction mutation in the very
early part of the gene structure and one nonsense mutation at the end of the CDS - shared by these three primate species. In the same study, based on sequences
from human, mouse, rat, and chicken, the silencing of
NR1H5 was dated to be approximately 42 million years
ago (MYA), which was slightly later than 42.9 MYA, the
estimated time of divergence between the catarrhines
and the New World monkeys [27]. However, because of
the uncertainties in the estimates of both dates (for
example, the 95% credibility interval of the divergence
time estimation is from 36.1 to 51.1 MYA), it is not
conclusive that the pseudogenization of NR1H5
occurred after the divergence between the catarrhines

and the New World monkeys. To solve this problem, we
identify NR1H5 in the recently published genomic
sequences of marmoset, a New World monkey, and
determine whether it contains any of the three pseudogenic mutations common to human, chimpanzee, and
rhesus. Despite the fact that only the first one-third of
the NR1H5 CDS can be found in marmoset due to the
incompleteness of its genome assembly, the two important common disruptive mutations, whose positions are
covered by the partial sequence identification, are
absent. This finding suggests that the pseudogenization
of NR1H5 in the human lineage occurred indeed after
the divergence between the catarrhines and the New
World monkeys.
Using current genome sequences of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus, marmoset, and tarsier,
we identify 11 genes - ADAM3, CTF2, HIST3H2BA,

MBL1, MUP, TMPRSS8, ADAM1B, ADAM5, DOC2G,
HYAL6, and TAS2R134 - with human-specific CDS disruptions, which occurred after the divergence of humans
and chimpanzees. Based on our sequence analysis, however, we find the last five of them - ADAM1B, ADAM5,
DOC2G, HYAL6, and TAS2R134 - are possibly also disabled in other primates with disruptions at different
sites. Under the assumption that the neutral mutation
rate has remained constant since the human-chimpanzee divergence at 6.6 MYA, we estimate the time in the
hominid ancestor when the human-specific inactivation
mutations appeared in the aforementioned 11 genes.
The inactivation time of eight genes can be meaningfully
calculated, and the estimates are plotted along the timeline from 6.6 MYA, when human and chimpanzee
diverged, to the present (Figure 5b; Table S3 in Additional file 1). None of unitary pseudogenes seems to be

Various genomic and genetic features of the HapMap
SNPs rs17097921, rs4940595, and rs2842899 are summarized in Table 3 (see Table S4 in Additional file 1 for
allele frequency information). Each of the nonsense
alleles should effectively pseudogenize the gene, as all
three SNPs are located in the early part of the coding
sequences. Using the HapMap genotype data, several
recent studies [30,31] scanned the human genome to
detect positive selection in human populations. These
three SNPs were not found to be under recent positive
selection. Such negative results, however, could be
caused by a lack of detection power due to a deficiency
in data and/or method. The human reference alleles of
all three SNPs are pseudogenic. The reference alleles in
other primates are functional for rs17097921 but pseudogenic for both rs4940595 and rs2842899. Using the
genotype and allele frequency data from the HapMap
Project, we check for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
for the two alleles of each SNP in each population and
all populations combined. Our statistical analysis shows
that, in the meta-population, the two alleles, T/G, of
rs4940595 are not at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (c2
goodness-of-fit test, degrees of freedom = 2, c2 = 8.659,
P = 0.013). We calculate FST between two populations
to measure their difference (distance), and the F ST
metric shows population subdivision in the meta-population. Hierarchical clustering groups 11 populations
into two subdivisions: one composed of the Europeans
in Utah, the Tuscans in Italy, and the Gujarati Indians
in Houston, Texas, and the other the rest (Figure 6a).
The FST between these two subdivisions is 0.044, which
is highly significant based on the permutation test

generated by the insertion of an Alu sequence into the
coding sequence of an ancestral functional gene. As the
plot shows, unlike Alu sequences, which had an exceptional surge of activity around 40 MYA [28], the pseudogenization events occurred in a temporally random
fashion - that is, there is no burst of gene losses during
the human evolution since the human-chimpanzee
divergence. This difference in their age distributions
reflects the difference in underlying generative
mechanisms.
Some genes contain polymorphic disruptive sites and are
segregating in the human population

Some of the pseudogenic loci are transcribed and, contrary to the genomic sequence, their mRNA transcript
sequences lack the disruptive sites, suggesting they are
functional genes. Such discrepancy potentially indicates
the existence of polymorphic disruptive sites in those
genes as the genomic DNA and the mRNA were
obtained and sequenced from different individuals. After
careful examination of both the genomic and the transcript sequences to ascertain their validity, we identified
11 human genes with polymorphic disruptive sites
(Table 2). Such genes are extreme cases of genetic polymorphisms, as they have a nonfunctional pseudogenic
allele segregating in the human population. Eight disruptive sites - four nonsense mutations and four 1-bp
indels - have been catalogued in dbSNP. Three of them,
all nonsense mutations, were included and typed in the
HapMap Project [29], and the other five sites are near
HapMap SNPs with a physical distance ranging from
20 bp to 1.7 kb (Table 2).

Discussion
The pseudogene complement of the human genome has
been comprehensively surveyed in several early studies
[5-7]. Using sequence similarity between the proteome
and the (translated) genome as the signature, these studies found pseudogenic copies of functional genes that
were generated after duplication or retrotransposition in
the human genome. Such duplicated or processed pseudogenes are probably of little evolutionary significance,
as the former are disabled soon after duplication and
the latter ‘dead on arrival’ [32]. In this study, however,
we systematically identify human unitary pseudogenes, a
class of pseudogenes that are especially interesting as it
is the functional genes themselves, not their genomic
copies generated by duplication or retrotransposition,
that have been disabled. Some human unitary pseudogenes have been identified on an individual basis when a
particular gene or gene family was studied (see the
references in Table S2 in Additional file 1). Using a
comparative genomic approach, Zhu et al. [23] identified 26 losses of well-established genes in the human
genome that were all lost at least 50 MYA after their
birth. We compared our and their sets and found that
in spite of using different methodological approaches,
both studies had in common many gene losses in the
human genome (Table S5 in Additional file 1).
To identify unitary pseudogenes in one species, we
need a reference gene set from another species. This is
not a mere operational convenience or necessity: unitary
pseudogenes are conceptually comparative entities as
speciation and gene duplication (and the possible subsequent gene death) are two separate events that most
likely happen at different times. As a result, different
sets of unitary pseudogenes in a species could be

identified if reference gene sets from several species are
used. For example, to identify human unitary pseudogenes, we can use mouse or chimpanzee gene sets.
When the human gene loss happened after the humanchimp divergence and if the mouse and the chimp
orthologs are both conserved, we have the same identifiable unitary pseudogene in human corresponding to its
mouse or chimp ortholog (Figure 7a). If, however, the
gene loss happened between the human-mouse and the
human-chimp divergences and the mouse ortholog is
conserved, the human unitary pseudogene is only meaningful and identifiable when the mouse gene set is used
for the comparison (Figure 7b). In a slightly more complicated evolutionary scenario, if a gene was duplicated
after the human-mouse divergence and its copy was
successfully neo-functionalized (with substantial
sequence change) before the human-chimp divergence
and pseudogenized afterwards in the human lineage, the
human unitary pseudogene is relative to, and identifiable
by, its chimp ortholog (Figure 7c). Under this scenario,
such human unitary pseudogenes - including human
ψMYH16 - cannot be identified using the mouse protein/gene set and thus will be false negatives of the identification result (Table S6 in Additional file 1). The
comparison between the human and chimpanzee genomic sequences has revealed a number of gene disruptions in humans [33].
Within a population, the pseudogenization of a gene
does not happen instantaneously. Rather, after a disruptive mutation occurs, the alleles at the locus undergo a
fixation process. Depending on the outcome, such a
mutation is either fixed or lost. Thus, every gene loss
goes through two stages: a polymorphic stage in the
contemporary population subject to evolutionary forces;
and a fixed stage freed from selective pressure. The
fixed mutation becomes the base substitution in the species under study relative to the other and is identified
through comparison of the genomes of two species. By
comparing the human and the mouse genomes, we
identify 76 fixed unitary pseudogenes. In addition, we

Figure 7 Unitary pseudogene relativity. Given the phylogeny of human, chimpanzee, and mouse, a human unitary pseudogenes can arise
from a gene loss that occurred in different lineages, including: (a) the human lineage after the human-chimp divergence; (b) the humanancestral lineage after the human-mouse divergence but before the human-chimp divergence; and under different circumstances, such as (c)
loss of a subfunctionalized gene in the human lineage after a duplication event before the human-chimp divergence. Because the absence of a
functional gene in a species is only identifiable through the comparison with another species that has the functional ortholog, the human
unitary pseudogene can be identified in (a) by comparing the human gene set to either the chimp or the mouse set as both of them have the
human ortholog. In (b, c), however, the human unitary pseudogene can only be identified by comparing the human gene set to one of either
the mouse or chimp gene set, as the other one does not have the human ortholog given the evolutionary history of the gene under
consideration.

identify 11 human genes with pseudogenic alleles, whose
disruptive mutations include nonsense mutations and
frameshifts. Our identification of polymorphic pseudogenes is by no means comprehensive as we search in
the reference genome sequence for only the loci that are
associated with both CDS disruptions and functional
mRNA sequences. To obtain a comprehensive set of
polymorphic pseudogenes, one approach would be to
map variation sites in dbSNP to the reference genome
and identify variations that can disrupt the ORF of
known genes.
Being at a relatively early stage of pseudogenization,
polymorphic pseudogenes in a population are subject to
various evolutionary forces depending on the function
of the normal alleles and the interaction between different genotypes and the environment. Since the loss of a
single-copy gene is often deleterious and unlikely to be
fixed in a population [34], it remains unclear under
what circumstances genes were silenced and how the
losses were tolerated and fixed in the ancestral

population. It has been proposed that, under certain
conditions, a gene could become disposable to the fitness of the organism if the function that it provides
becomes redundant. When this happens, the pseudogenic allele could be fixed in the population by random
genetic drift because the loss of the gene product did
not constitute a disadvantage and, thus, there is little
selection against the gene loss. This release from selective pressure is believed to be how the nonfunctionalization of L-gulono-g-lactone oxidase gene could be fixed
in humans and guinea pigs [13]: it has been hypothesized that the guinea pig and human ancestors subsisted
on a naturally ascorbic acid-rich diet; therefore, the loss
of the enzyme did not constitute a disadvantage.
On the other hand, as argued by the ‘less is more’
hypothesis, gene loss may serve as an engine of evolutionary change [35]. Instead of being a neutral event,
the silencing of a gene could be advantageous to the
organism and consequently sweep through the population to fixation - the kind of adaptive evolution

illustrated by the inactivation of the a-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene in catarrhines [36], the CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene [12], the olfactory
receptor genes [17], and the sarcomeric myosin gene
[14] in humans as there seems to be a correlation
between pseudogenization and physiological/anatomic
changes. In addition to these fixed unitary pseudogenes,
studies have also shown that some null alleles confer a
selective advantage for the polymorphic pseudogenes in
the human population. For example, the chemokine
receptor CCR5 gene in human has a pseudogenic allele
with a 32-bp deletion. Homozygotes of this null allele
are strongly protected from infection by various pathogens, including HIV, and heterozygotes receive some
protection [9]. Another example is the caspase-12 gene.
It has been shown that carriers of the caspase-12 pseudogene are more resistant to severe sepsis [37], and the
null allele has spread through most of the human population within the past 100,000 years because of positive
selection [38].
There are 6,236 Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
mouse proteins and 6,020 Ensembl human proteins outside of the InParanoid-assigned human-mouse orthologs. Such an absence of orthology is a result of both
gene deaths that generated unitary pseudogenes and
gene births that gave rise to novel genes in both species.
Using the absence of orthologs of mouse proteins in
human as the signal, we identify 76 such losses of wellestablished genes in the human genome. Of the 2,005
human proteins that have no mouse orthologs and cannot be mapped to the mouse reference genome, 638
passed the quality control and thus are included in the
current Ensembl release of the human protein set.
Because they cannot be mapped to the genome of dog,
the closest out-group of the human-mouse lineage with
the best genomic sequences, we believe the reason for
their lack of mouse orthologs is that they are novel
human genes, not that their mouse orthologs have been
deleted. If we take the 15,885 human-mouse orthologs
assigned by InParanoid as the set of genes before the
divergence between human and mouse, the unitary
pseudogenes and the novel genes generated in the
human lineage since the last common ancestor of
euarchontoglires, approximately 75 MYA, represent,
respectively, a loss and a gain of approximately 0.5% and
4% of the number of ancestral genes. Despite aforementioned examples of gene losses under positive selection,
this striking skew toward gene birth indicates strongly
that gene births are a more significant force for evolutionary change than gene losses. It also confirms the
notion that as they represent functional losses to a species, unitary pseudogenes are expected to be rare.
The reference allele in other primates - which is
widely taken as the ancestral state - of a human SNP

Page 13 of 17

can shed light on its emergence and evolution. The
human reference alleles of three disruptive HapMap
SNPs (Table 3) are pseudogenic, which cannot be otherwise given the method that we use to identify the polymorphic pseudogenes. As expected (Figure 8a), the
reference allele of one SNP in non-human primates is
functional. It is surprising, however, to find that the
reference alleles of two of the SNPs in non-human primates are pseudogenic. One explanation is that these
two loci in the common ancestor of human, chimp,
orangutan, and macaque were also polymorphic and
have been so in the descendent populations ever since
(Figure 8b). If their pseudogenic alleles have risen to
high frequencies in chimp, orangutan, and macaque, it
is possible for these two loci to be typed as pseudogenic
homozygotes (that is, the reference alleles) in all these
three non-human primate populations. Polymorphisms
at some HLA (human leukocyte antigen) loci are known
examples of polymorphisms that have crossed speciation
events, as these HLA loci are polymorphic in both
human and chimp. This explanation, however, requires
the polymorphisms at rs4940595 and rs2842899 to be
very ancient, at least 30 million years old. Another
explanation is that the pseudogenic alleles are indeed
fixed in chimp, orangutan, macaque, and the last common ancestor between them and human, but the genes
have been resurrected from the pseudogenic state in the
human lineage (Figure 8c). This seemingly implausible
resurrection event is believed to have happened to the
human IRGM gene through a series of complex structural events after it became pseudogenized in the
anthropoid common ancestor [39].

Conclusions
Unitary pseudogenes are unprocessed pseudogenes with
no functional counterparts. With complete genome
sequences of model organisms, we have developed a
novel method to detect such pseudogenes in a genome
through analyzing the global inventory of orthologs
between two organisms. Using this approach with very
conservative cutoffs to look for gene losses along the
human lineage after its divergence from rodents
approximately 75 MYA, we identify 76 unitary pseudogenes in the human genome. As relics of genes, they
shed particular light on the unique features of the
human genome during evolution. By comparing orthologous sequences, we assign ages to primate unitary pseudogenes, and find that the former functional genes
appear to have been disabled at a fairly uniform rate
throughout primate evolution and not in a sudden
burst. Furthermore, we find 11 polymorphic pseudogenes that have nonfunctional pseudogenic alleles currently segregating in the human population Comparing
them with their orthologs in other primates, we find

that two are in fact pseudogenes in non-human primates, suggesting that these actually represent cases of a
gene that is in the process of being resurrected in the
human lineage. Identification and analysis of human
unitary pseudogenes afford unique insights into the evolution and dynamics of the human genic repertoire and
the human genome at large.

Materials and methods
Identification of human unitary pseudogenes

The overall strategy of our approach is depicted in Figure 1a. To discover human unitary pseudogenes, we use
mouse proteins as the reference. Because by definition a
unitary pseudogene and a functional ortholog in a genome are mutually exclusive for a specific gene in
another genome, we first identify mouse proteins that
do not have human orthologs. To find such mouse proteins, we use the InParanoid human-mouse ortholog set
(version 6.1, based on human Ensembl 43 and mouse
MGI 12 December 2006 protein sets). InParanoid is
used because it balances the false negative and false
positive rates and was top-ranked as an orthology tool
[40,41]. These mouse proteins are then mapped to the
human reference genome (Hsap NCBI build 36.1, hg18)
using BLAT [42] with its default parameters. If the best

mapping of a mouse protein to the human genome
gives a gene structure similar to that of the mouse gene,
the mapped human genomic region is extracted and
examined for disruptions (nonsense mutations and frameshifts) to the coding sequence using GeneWise [43].
Some of the initially discovered human pseudogenes are
redundant as they could be identified by more than one
mouse gene due to duplicated gene annotations or high
sequence similarities among members of certain protein
families. The redundancy is removed by clustering the
initial set of pseudogenic candidates into pseudogenic loci
based on the overlap among their genomic coordinates.
These loci are grouped into four sets based on the annotation of the mouse proteins expressed from: named genes;
cDNA/expressed sequences with introns; cDNA/expressed
sequences without introns; and modeled/predicted genes.
Given the low possibility for unitary pseudogenes to be
intronless and the difficulty to assess the reliability of the
modeled or predicted genes, the loci in the last two sets
are excluded from further consideration.
Loci in the first two sets are carefully examined to
ascertain their pseudogene status. Prior to manual annotation, all genomic sequences are sent to an automated
analysis pipeline for similarity searches and ab initio
gene predictions. The searches are run on a computer

Zhang et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R26
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R26

farm and stored in an Ensembl MySQL database using
the Ensembl analysis pipeline system [44] and the
results displayed in the Zmap genome viewer. Additional external predictions and annotation can be visualized in Zmap via a distributed annotation system
(DAS). The otterlace annotation interface allows the
user to build genes and edit annotations based on
homology to aligned mRNA, expressed sequence tag
and protein evidence by adding transcripts, exon coordinates, CDSs, gene names and descriptions, remarks and
polyadenylation signals and sites [45].
All predicted unitary pseudogene loci are checked to
ensure the validity of the orthologous mouse protein-coding gene, to verify the conservation of synteny between the
human and mouse loci, and to confirm the pseudogenicity
of the human locus. Mouse loci identified as orthologs to
putative human unitary pseudogenes are fully manually
annotated; that is, the complete gene structures and CDSs
of all alternative splice variants are elucidated to confirm
both the coding potential of the locus and the accuracy of
the MGI annotated CDSs. Mouse loci identified as lacking
a CDS are rejected as unitary pseudogenes. Conservation
of synteny between mouse and human orthologs is established by the identification of conserved flanking loci in
both the Zmap viewer and Ensembl MultiContig View.
Where the position of the putative orthologs is not conserved, the human locus is rejected as a unitary pseudogene. Finally, the putative human unitary pseudogene
locus is fully manually annotated. Loci are confirmed as
unitary pseudogenes where the alignment of the orthologous mouse protein sequence indicates a CDS disruption
(premature stop, frame-shift or truncation) fixed in the
human genome.
We also identify several cases where the ORF of a
gene is disrupted in the human reference genome
sequence but locus-specific transcripts lack the disrupting mutation. Such a contradiction may be a result of
polymorphism in the human population, as the genomic
DNA and the mRNA were obtained from different individuals. However, in some cases an apparent error in
the genomic sequence appears responsible. To identify
and remove false positives, we check the validity of the
base call under consideration in the human reference
genome by examining the sequences of the reads in the
trace archive. We confirm the transcript sequence by
multiple independent copies available in GenBank. All
errors in the genome sequence were reported to the
Genome Reference Consortium.
Identification of orthologous genic or pseudogenic
sequences in 43 species

We examine 44 vertebrates for genic or pseudogenic
sequences orthologous and syntenic to human unitary
pseudogenes. The organism, release version and time of

Page 15 of 17

the genomic sequence download from the Ensembl
database are listed in Table S7 in Additional file 1.
To identify orthologous and syntenic sequences, we
first use the Fetch Alignments tool of Galaxy [46] to
extract ‘stitched’ blocks of the alignment of the above 44
genomic sequences for each of the 76 human unitary
pseudogenes in the human genome. Using the global
multiple sequence alignment ensures the orthology and
the synteny of mapped genomic sequences among species. The sequences in the alignment blocks are then
mapped back using BLAT to their corresponding genomes to recover any sequences not included in the
alignments. The subsequences corresponding to the 76
human unitary pseudogenes in the 44 genomes are
extracted from the start minus 5 kb and the end plus 5
kb of the BLAT alignments. The mouse protein
sequences are then aligned to the corresponding genomic subsequences using GeneWise to identify their
orthologs in the 44 genomes.
Functional and structural analyses of human unitary
pseudogenes

For functional and structural analyses, we search for GO
terms and Pfam domains that are over-represented
within the human unitary pseudogenes. Because pseudogenes are nonfunctional and thus not included in the
human gene annotation set, such analyses cannot be
performed directly. To circumvent this problem, we use
the 76 mouse functional orthologs of human unitary
pseudogenes as their proxies. To perform the analyses,
we combine all human genes and the 76 mouse genes
into one gene list and retrieve their GO and Pfam annotations from Ensembl. BiNGO [47] is used to test the 76
mouse genes in comparison with the combined gene list
for GO term association on the GO hierarchy. We also
test for over-representation of Pfam domains using the
standard hypergeometric test with subsequent false discovery rate correction for multiple hypotheses testing.
Estimation of the nonfunctionalization time of a humanspecific unitary pseudogene

To estimate the nonfunctionalization time (TN) of a unitary pseudogene, we use the method devised by Chou
et al. [12]. It assumes that non-synonymous mutations
are selected against until the gene is inactivated; thereafter, mutations at both synonymous and non-synonymous sites accumulate at the neutral mutation rate.
Sequences orthologous to the human pseudogene from
mouse and rat (and other organisms if available) are
used in the calculation, as the quantification of lineagespecific mutation rates at synonymous and non-synonymous sites remote from the inactivating deletion provides the information necessary for the calculation.
Given this assumption, the following equality holds:

in which T is the time since the last common ancestor
of human and chimpanzee (approximately 6.6 MYA
[27]), TN is the time since the unitary pseudogene inactivation to be estimated, rS1 = KS1/T is the synonymous
substitution rate in the human lineage,  is the average
KA/KS ratio in all non-human lineages, and KA1 is the
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site
in the human lineage. Rearrange the equation above, we
have:
 
TN  T  1
1 

in which ω1 is the KA/KS ratio in the human lineage.
When only a small number of species are used to estimate T N , its estimated value should be viewed with
caution.
