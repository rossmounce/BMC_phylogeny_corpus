Abstract
Background: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is essential for immune function.
Historically, it has been subdivided into three regions (Class I, II, and III), but a cluster of functionally related
genes within the Class III region has also been referred to as the Class IV region or "inflammatory region".
This group of genes is involved in the inflammatory response, and includes members of the tumour
necrosis family. Here we report the sequencing, annotation and comparative analysis of a tammar wallaby
BAC containing the inflammatory region. We also discuss the extent of sequence conservation across the
entire region and identify elements conserved in evolution.
Results: Fourteen Class III genes from the tammar wallaby inflammatory region were characterised and
compared to their orthologues in other vertebrates. The organisation and sequence of genes in the
inflammatory region of both the wallaby and South American opossum are highly conserved compared to
known genes from eutherian ("placental") mammals. Some minor differences separate the two marsupial
species. Eight genes within the inflammatory region have remained tightly clustered for at least 360 million
years, predating the divergence of the amphibian lineage. Analysis of sequence conservation identified 354
elements that are conserved. These range in size from 7 to 431 bases and cover 15.6% of the inflammatory
region, representing approximately a 4-fold increase compared to the average for vertebrate genomes.
About 5.5% of this conserved sequence is marsupial-specific, including three cases of marsupial-specific
repeats. Highly Conserved Elements were also characterised.
Conclusion: Using comparative analysis, we show that a cluster of MHC genes involved in inflammation,
including TNF, LTA (or its putative teleost homolog TNF-N), APOM, and BAT3 have remained together for
over 450 million years, predating the divergence of mammals from fish. The observed enrichment in
conserved sequences within the inflammatory region suggests conservation at the transcriptional
regulatory level, in addition to the functional level.

Background
The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is critical
to the immune response of jawed vertebrates. It contains
genes essential to both the adaptive and innate immune
systems. Genes within the MHC have been traditionally
divided into three different subregions. Class I and II
regions contain genes of related structure and function,
and encode molecules that are responsible for antigen
presentation to T cells. The Class III region genes are more
heterogeneous and their definition as Class III is based on
their location between Classes I and II in eutherian (placental) mammals rather than functional commonality
[1].
The human Class III region, spanning approximately 700
kb, contains 61 genes and is the most gene-dense region
of the human genome [2]. Class III gene content has been
shown to be well conserved, with an amphibian (Xenopus
tropicalis) [3] and a marsupial (Monodelphis domestica) [4],
sharing most of the genes making up the human Class III
region. In stark contrast, the Class III region in the chicken
and quail is represented by only a single gene, coding for
a complement component gene (C4)[5,6]. Teleost Class
III organisation is different again, with the MHC split over
several different chromosomes. A survey of the Fugu
rubripes genome for human Class III orthologues uncovered Class III genes on 31 different scaffolds [7]. A similar
survey in zebrafish found that, although there is a cluster
of Class III genes on chromosome 19, Class III loci are
spread across all chromosomes [8].
Seven genes within the human Class III region, from MIC
to SKI2W and including the tumour necrosis factor family, are thought to be involved in the inflammatory
response. These genes have been referred to as the Class IV
region or the inflammatory region [9]. Linkage analyses
have revealed associations of the inflammatory region
with many diseases, although in most cases the causal
genes have remained unidentified. For instance, a region
between NFKBIL and MICA may control susceptibility to
hepatitis C virus-associated dilated cardiomyopathy, but
the precise gene or sequence involved in this disease susceptibility remains unknown [10].
If gene content and arrangement within the inflammatory
region is important for function, we would expect that the
same genes would be clustered in other species as well.
The Class III region is indeed highly conserved, but a comparison of the mouse and human inflammatory regions
reveals that not all genes are represented in both species.
The mouse inflammatory region has no functional copy
of NCR3, and lacks both MIC and MCCD1. Pairwise alignment of the human and mouse Class III regions identified
conserved non-coding elements which may act as regula-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/281

tory elements, and even detected the presence of previously unrecognised genes [2].
It has been shown that the power of comparative
sequence analysis can be greatly increased by the inclusion of one or more non-eutherian mammals [11]. Marsupials diverged from eutherian ("placental") mammals
about 180 million years ago (MYA) [12] and neatly fill the
phylogenetic gap between the bird-mammal divergence
(310MYA) and the eutherian radiation (100MYA). Their
genomic sequences are more easily aligned to human
than are those of birds or fish but, in general, have also
diverged enough for important conserved elements to be
easily detected. Sequences that are highly conserved
between eutherians and marsupials are likely to be functionally important, as non-functional sequences would
have diverged over such a long period of evolutionary
time [13].
Recent characterisation of the MHC of the grey shorttailed opossum (M. domestica) demonstrated that the
eutherian MHC organisation is derived, whereas marsupials retain an organisation resembling the ancestral vertebrate arrangement in which the Class III region adjoins a
combined Class I and II region [4]. Although the gene
content and order in the opossum Class III region is well
conserved compared to eutherians, there are some differences, such as the absence of two genes (NCR3 and LST1)
from the inflammatory region. The Australian model marsupial, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), last shared
a common ancestor with the opossum about 70 million
years ago [14], providing a comparison similar to that of
human/mouse. Given the differences between the human
and mouse MHCs, comparison of gene content and
arrangement in a second marsupial species will permit
identification of lineage-specific changes, and identify
potentially important conserved non-coding sequences.
To date, comparative studies of the Class III region have
focused on the conservation of gene content and arrangement. The only large scale sequence-based comparison of
the region is between human and mouse [2]. The availability of Class III sequences from other eutherian and marsupial species permits a multiple species analysis to be
performed, adding power to the comparative analysis.
Moreover, recent advances in the identification of conserved elements incorporate the phylogenetic relationship
between species [15-18] thereby reducing bias resulting
from the use of closely related species.
Here we report the characterisation of a BAC harbouring
wallaby inflammatory region genes, and extend the comparative analyses of this region over a wider phylogenetic
distance. Our wallaby data has allowed us to chart the
evolution of the inflammatory region gene content and

organisation, to perform in-depth analysis of conserved
mammalian non-coding and coding sequences and to
identify marsupial-specific conserved sequence elements.
Identification of such elements will assist in correlating
disease-associated polymorphisms with sequences of
functional importance [2], assist in the identification of
conserved transcription factor binding sites and ultimately result in a better understanding of gene function
within the inflammatory region.

Results
Comparative analysis of gene content and arrangement of
the inflammatory region
We sequenced a 165 kb BAC containing a portion of the
tammar wallaby MHC Class III region [EMBL:
CR925799]. The orthologues of 14 human Class III genes
were identified using a combination of TBLASTN and
GenomeScan (Figure 1). Predicted genes were handcurated using orthologous sequences as guides. The
sequence identity of the predicted proteins are shown in
Table 1. We do not have a complete sequence for MIC, as
the 3' end of the gene is beyond the boundaries of the
BAC.

Orthologues of the 14 wallaby genes were examined in
other species. Gene content, structure, order and transcriptional orientation within this region are well conserved between the two marsupials (wallaby and
opossum) with one noticeable exception: the absence of
NCR3 in the opossum. A search of the opossum genome
assembly (MonDom4) failed to detect a copy of NCR3
elsewhere in the genome. The presence of the opossum
orthologue of AIF1 is yet to be confirmed. Only the first
and part of the last exon of AIF1 were detected in the
opossum genome assembly (MonDom4), but since these
exons flank an unsequenced gap in the assembly, we
assume that AIF1 is present.
We next determined the organisation of genes across the
interval sequenced in the wallaby (Figure 2). For the
mammalian species, the genes form part of the MHC cluster and their order is conserved. Twelve of the predicted
wallaby genes have the same number of exons as their
human counterparts. Wallaby NFKBIL1 is predicted to
have one fewer exon than the human orthologue.
A comparison of marsupial and eutherian inflammatory
regions reveals that one gene, LST1, is missing from this
region in the marsupials. LST1 sequence similarity
between eutherian species is low (only 36% similarity
between human and mouse), so the marsupial orthologue may have diverged to such an extent that it is difficult to detect. However, a HMMER [19] search using the
LST1 profile from PFAM [20] reveals no significant hits
and GenScan predicts no additional genes in this BAC. At

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/281

this stage, we cannot exclude the existence of LST1 in
another region of the genome, though we think this is
unlikely, as no LST1 orthologue was detected within the
MHC or elsewhere in the opossum genome.
Chicken orthologues of the MHC Class III region genes
were not identified. Orthologues of several genes were
found in frog (BAT1, ATP6V1G2, NKFBIL1, LTA, TNF,
LTB, BAT2, BAT3, APOM) and were located on the same
genomic scaffold, but no orthologues of five genes (MIC,
MCCD1, NCR3, AIF1 and C6orf47) were detected anywhere in the frog genome. In the teleosts, orthologues for
eight genes (BAT1, NKFBIL1, LTA, TNF, LTB, BAT2, BAT3)
were distributed over several chromosomes in zebrafish
(Danio rerio) or scaffolds in pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes).
AIF1 was identified in pufferfish but not zebrafish. Genes
were not grouped together in the same combinations in
fish, but many were found with other genes from the eutherian Class III region. TNF, LTA or TNF-N, APOM and
BAT3 were found on the same chromosomal segment in
all species studied (excluding chicken) and in a similar
transcriptional orientation.
Repeat analysis
Analysis of the distribution of repeats in the wallaby BAC
compared with the orthologous region in opossum and
eutherians is shown in Table 2. Wallaby and opossum
have similar percentages of LINEs (Long Interspersed Elements), SINEs (Short Interspersed Elements) and DNA
elements, but the opossum has a much higher percentage
of LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats). Most of these LTRs are
endogenous retroviral elements, located mainly between
MIC and MCCD1 and LTB and BAT2. This analysis also
revealed a much lower percentage of SINEs in marsupials
compared to eutherians whereas marsupials have a much
higher percentage of LINEs than eutherians.
Sequence conservation
We analysed the sequence conservation in wallaby- and
human-referenced alignments of the MHC Class III
inflammatory regions from eight mammalian species
(human, chimp, mouse, rat, dog, cow, opossum and wallaby) using a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phyloHMM). There were 354 conserved elements predicted in
the wallaby inflammatory region, covering 15.6% of the
sequence (25,834 bp). Element lengths ranged from 7 to
431 bases, with a median length of 43 bases [see Additional file 1]. Predictions from both referenced alignments
are compared in Table 3. The locations of conserved elements may be viewed using Gbrowse [21].

To investigate the distribution of conserved elements
across various sequence types, we defined seven annotation classes: exonic, intronic, untranslated regions
(UTRs), repeats, and intergenic, which we further broke

down into less than 1 kb upstream of an annotated gene,
less than 1 kb downstream of an annotated gene, and
more than 1 kb from an annotated gene. With the exception of TNF and LTA, for which the wallaby sequences are
known, genes were predicted in wallaby using GenomeScan and checked by comparison with other species. Since
GenomeScan does not predict UTRs, sequence for the
UTR class was defined to extend from the predicted promoter to the translation start site, and from the translation
stop to the poly-A tail. This approximation is likely to
over-estimate the amount of sequence in this class and
include intronic sequence that may not be conserved. For
the wallaby-referenced alignment, the proportion of bases
that are conserved in each sequence class and the distribution of conserved bases across classes are shown in Figure
3. We found that about 10% of non-coding sequence was
conserved, and that about 29% of the predicted conserved
sequence was non-coding.

elements is given in Table 5. Elements obtained from the
wallaby-referenced alignment may be viewed using
Gbrowse [21].

Highly conserved and lineage-specific elements
In order to identify highly conserved elements and lineage-specific conservation, we calculated the percent identity between the reference sequence and each of the
aligned species within each of the conserved elements
described above [see Additional file 2]. Elements with at
least 90% identity between the reference and each aligned
species were labelled Highly Conserved Elements (HCEs).
Three types of lineage-specific element were also defined:
Marsupial-Specific Elements (MSEs), Eutherian-Specific
Elements (ESEs) and elements that are present in eutherians and wallaby, but lost or highly diverged in opossum,
which we termed Undetected In Opossum (UIO). Table 4
provides the definitions of these elements. A summary of
the properties of the HCEs and various lineage-specific

Seventeen MSEs were identified from the wallaby-referenced alignment. These elements are highly conserved
between wallaby and opossum, but the eutherian
sequences contain many alignment gaps. About 5.5% of
bases that are conserved are MSEs. MSEs tend to be long
(42–146 bp), because phastCons requires a longer stretch
of conserved sequence when conservation is limited to
just a few closely related species in the multiple alignment. Thus, shorter MSEs may have been missed. The
MSEs are distributed across the entire inflammatory
region. Only three MSEs overlap repeats identified using
RepeatMasker (MSE_10 contains an LINE (L1-2); MSE_11
overlaps with a SINE/MIR3; MSE_14 overlaps with a LINE
(L3)). Two genes (MIC &BAT3) have exons containing
MSEs. The 33 kb repeat-rich region between MIC and

Eight HCEs were identified: two overlap the poly-A tails of
NFKBIL1 and APOM, one is located in the 3'-UTR of LTA,
one is found in the exon of C6orf47, another in the 5'UTR of that gene, and there is one overlapping the first
exon of BAT2. AIF1 has an HCE just upstream of its 5'UTR. In the human genome, it overlaps a number of

[DDBJ:AV735626], [GenBank: BF967128], mouse [GenBank: AI046587] and pig [GenBank: DN100732], and
may represent additional 5'-UTR sequence. BAT1 contains
an HCE in intron 5. It overlaps the start of the C/D box
small nucleolar RNA mU83, which has previously been
identified in the fifth intron of human, mouse and pig
BAT1 [22].

MCCD1, which appears to be expanded in marsupials,
contains two MSEs, although they do not coincide with

identified repeats. The remaining MSEs are in introns
(seven elements) or in intergenic regions.
There were seven elements conserved in the wallaby and
eutherians, but apparently not in the opossum. We
termed these elements Unidentified In Opossum (UIOs).
Six UIOs overlap exons of AIF1 (exons 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6),
which are present in wallaby and well conserved in eutherians (80% identity between wallaby and human). This
led us to examine the opossum sequence in this region
more closely and revealed that there is a large sequencing
gap in the genome assembly here. The other UIO is
located in the second intron of NFKBIL1. It is a 15 bp segment of a SINE/MIR element that is well conserved

between the eutherians and wallaby, but was not found in
the opossum.

Discussion
The comparison of genomes from an array of mammals,
or even vertebrates, is key to identifying functionally
important non-coding regions and gaining a better understanding of genome biology and evolution. Comparison
of the wallaby BAC containing orthologues of the human
Class III inflammatory region with the orthologous region
in other vertebrates provides new insights into the evolution and regulatory organisation of the mammalian MHC
inflammatory region.
Gene conservation of region in mammals
By comparing the gene content and arrangement in the
wallaby inflammatory region to the opossum and eutherians, we can reveal the evolutionary history of the region.
The timing of events such as the loss or movement of
genes from the inflammatory region can be ascertained. A
comparison between the wallaby and opossum reveals
that one gene (NCR3) is present in the wallaby but absent
in the opossum. Comparative analysis of the marsupial
and eutherian inflammatory regions reveals that LST1
became part of the region after the divergence of marsupials and eutherians. It is also apparent that the mouse is
more divergent in gene content than the other eutherian
species, lacking both MCCD1 and MIC in addition to having only a non-functional copy of NCR3.

Comparing the wallaby BAC sequence with the orthologous region in other mammals revealed a high level of
similarity between the gene content and organisation of
marsupials and eutherians. Variation in the level of conservation between the wallaby genes and other mammalian orthologues is apparent at the protein and nucleotide
levels (Table 1). The most highly conserved are those loci
with putative housekeeping functions. For instance, wallaby BAT1, a member of the DEAD box protein family of
ATP-dependent RNA helicases, is 99% identical to human
BAT1 at the amino acid level. The least conserved genes
have products with specialised immune function, such as
NCR3. This level of sequence divergence is characteristic
of genes of immunological importance because they
evolve rapidly to counter rapidly evolving pathogens.
The presence of NCR3 in wallaby but its absence in opossum is not unexpected, since NCR gene content and function differs also between human and mouse [23]. NCR3 is
a member of the gene family specifying natural cytotoxicity receptors, which are responsible for natural killer (NK)
cell activation [24]. In humans there are three expressed
NCR genes but in mouse NCR1 is the only active gene,
NCR2 having been lost [23] and NCR3 a pseudogene
[2,23]. The three human NCRs appear to have adopted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/281

specialised functions. NCR1 functions as the predominant activating NK receptor, whereas NCR2 and NCR3
have much more restricted expression profiles [23]. This
suggests duplication of an original NCR gene with the specialization of duplicate genes in humans, and their loss
independently in mice and opossums. The present study
implies that these duplications took place much earlier
than had been supposed, before the divergence of marsupials and eutherians.
One of the most obvious differences between marsupials
and eutherians is the apparent absence of an LST1 orthologue in both marsupial species studied. Sequence similarity between eutherian species is low for this gene so
marsupial LST1 may have diverged to such an extent that
it is difficult to detect. Nonetheless, even our more rigorous search for this gene in the opossum using HMMER
failed to detect an LST1 orthologue in the opossum
genome. The function of LST1 is still being elucidated but
it has been shown to have an immunomodulatory function with a very strong inhibitory effect on lymphocyte
proliferation [25] and its expression is up-regulated in
response to bacterial infection and inflammatory mediators [26]. Splice variants result in either membrane-bound
or soluble LST1 isoforms that presumably carry out different functions.
Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) test the recognition
and proliferation of T lymphocytes in culture. Marsupials
have a weak or even non-existent mixed lymphocyte
response yet mount a normal graft rejection response
[27]. Initially, it was thought that this weak MLR was the
result of a low level of MHC Class II variability [28], an
amino acid substitution in the MHC molecule [27] or
even a difference in the ontogeny of marsupial and eutherian T cells [29]. The absence of immunomodulation by
LST1 may also be a contributing a factor.
Our analysis of MCCD1 (Mitochondrial Coiled-Coil
Domain) shows that this gene is much older than had
been previously thought. This gene is present in the
human MHC Class III region [30], but is evidently lacking
from this region in mouse; nor is there an orthologue elsewhere in the mouse genome. A previous study failed to
detect MCCD1 orthologues in GenBank genome and EST
databases for any other species other than pig and it was
suggested that MCCD1 emerged 60 – 100 million years
ago, prior to the divergence of pigs but after the divergence
of rodents [30]. However, our demonstration of a MCCD1
orthologue in the wallaby region reveals that this gene has
been present in the mammalian lineage for over 180 million years, since marsupials and eutherians last shared a
common ancestor, so was probably lost in the rodent lineage.

*relative to reference sequence

Part of a wallaby MIC orthologue was identified within
the BAC, lacking only the terminal exon and polyadenylation signal. This wallaby MIC orthologue shows sequence
identity to the human MIC gene and the murine Mill
genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the sequence is
basal to both MIC and Mill (data not shown). The presence of the MIC orthologue in marsupials suggests that
the Mill gene family in the mouse was derived from a MIC
gene ancestor that has diverged, possibly as a result of having moved out of the MHC [4].
Thus, the highly conserved mammalian inflammatory
region has been relatively stable over the last 180 million
years, with the apparent gain of one gene (LST1) in eutherians. NCR3 has undergone lineage specific changes, having been lost from the opossum and non-functional in the
mouse but the presence of this gene in the wallaby indicates that it was part of the inflammatory region prior to
marsupial/eutherian divergence. The stability of this
region in mammals over the past 180 million years suggests that the maintenance of these genes in a cluster may
be functionally important.
Evolution of the MHC Class III region
Comparison of the inflammatory region of the wallaby
MHC Class III with that of other vertebrates indicates that
extensive evolutionary changes occurred early in vertebrate evolution, but were followed by a lengthy period of
evolutionary stability. We have shown that many of the
genes making up the inflammatory region of the eutherian MHC have been clustered for at least 350 million

years. Frog NFKBIL1, LTA, TNF, LTB and BAT2, BAT3,
APOM are in the same transcriptional orientation as in
mammals, although there have been several rearrangements in this region. The gene RSG3, located between LTB
and BAT2, moved to a different chromosome and the
LST1 gene was inserted in eutherians. NCR3 and AIF1
appear to have been lost in some lineages. BAT1 and
ATPV1G2 have moved and changed transcriptional orientation.
The three genes TNF, LTA and LTB of the eutherian
tumour necrosis factor family genes are arranged in tandem, with TNF and LTA in the same transcriptional orientation and LTB in the opposite orientation. This
formation is conserved, even in marsupials, suggesting
that there may be some functional advantage to this
arrangement. The proteins encoded by TNF, LTA and LTB
are known to interact as complementary factors in various
cell signalling networks [31,32]. Hence, the maintenance
of this gene arrangement may serve to facilitate co-ordinated regulation of these genes.
The absence of genes from some lineages does not necessarily mean that the functions of these genes are lost. For
instance, chicken lacks TNF, but the its paralogue (TL1A)
appears to function as a TNF substitute [33]. Likewise, in
the lineages that lack the allograft inflammatory factor
AIF1, a paralogue may have assumed its function. AIF1 is
a cytokine-responsive, calcium binding protein, shown to
play a role in allograft rejection [34,35] and in the inflammatory response following injury [36]. An orthologue of

this gene was identified in eutherians, marsupials and
pufferfish but not chicken, frog or zebrafish. A paralogue
of this gene (C9orf58) is found on human chromosome 9
and is also present in chicken and frog, flanked by other
human chromosome 9 genes. This gene may take over the
role of AIF1 in lineages where AIF1 has been lost.
Our analyses suggest that eight genes within the inflammatory region have remained tightly clustered for at least
350 million years, predating the divergence of the
amphibian lineage. The linkage of TNF, LTA (or its putative teleost homolog TNF-N), APOM, and BAT3, predates
the divergence of teleosts and mammals some 450 million years ago and is consistent with a functional significance of clustering of genes involved in inflammation.
Chicken is the exception, with no inflammatory region
orthologues identified but it is likely that paralogues of
these genes perform their function.
Sequence conservation
Genome comparisons between evolutionary diverse species have proven particularly useful for detecting conserved sequences, which may be functionally important.
Older pairwise methods for detecting sequence conservation (e.g. VISTA and PipMaker [37,38]) required the careful selection of species to avoid biasing predictions by
including closely related species (e.g. human, mouse, rat).
More recent methods take the phylogenetic relationship
of species into account to reduce or eliminate this bias (e.g
[15,17,18]). However, when using these methods, careful
species selection is still important. As with pairwise methods, there is a trade-off between alignability and evolutionary depth. Also, including too many species that lack
a gene or region of interest will reduce the sensitivity of
conserved element prediction.

Marsupials are extremely well placed phylogenetically for
the analysis of the inflammatory region, which is highly
conserved amongst eutherians, but completely absent
from the chicken genome. We found that the frog inflammatory region, while reasonably well conserved in terms
of gene content, does not align well to the mammalian
inflammatory region in non-coding regions. In teleosts,
the inflammatory region is split over different chromosomes and obtaining a high quality alignment outside of
coding regions is extremely difficult.
We searched the highly gene dense MHC Class III region
for conserved elements using phastCons, an approach
that utilizes a phylogenetic hidden Markov model. We
identified 354 conserved elements covering 25,834 bp or
15.6% of the region. Siepel et al. [15] used this approach
to identify conserved elements in genomes of five vertebrates (human, mouse, rat, chicken and fugu). They
found 1.18 million conserved elements covering 4.3% of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/281

the human genome. Thus we find roughly an eight-fold
enrichment in the number of conserved elements in the
inflammatory region and a four-fold increase in the proportion of sequence covered compared to a uniform distribution at this rate. The high density of conserved
elements in this gene-rich region itself suggests that they
have a function in regulation of the genes.
The UCSC Genome Browser "Most Conserved" track for
the human genome (hg17, March 2006) is based on a
phastCons analysis of a human-referenced multiz alignment of 17 vertebrate species (human, chimpanzee, rhesus, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cow, armadillo, elephant,
tenrec, opossum, chicken, frog, zebrafish, and the two
pufferfish species Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu
rubripes). It identifies 302 conserved elements, covering
23470 bp, in the human inflammatory region. This is substantially less than the 468 elements, covering 30,192 bp
that we identified in human. Examining the 17-way alignment of the inflammatory region reveals that only
human, mouse, rat, dog and opossum are aligned substantially, with regions from chicken, X. tropicalis and T.
nigroviridis aligning in smaller segments. Thus, locally the
sequence alignment contains fewer eutherians, only one
marsupial and many sequence gaps from the non-mammals. It is likely that the deeper phylogenetic coverage and
fewer mammalian sequences (particularly the absence of
cow and wallaby) make the UCSC phastCons analysis less
sensitive for small mammal-specific conserved elements.
This demonstrates that, while the UCSC genome browser
is an excellent resource for comparative genomics, there is
still some role for careful selection of species, taking the
biology into account, when analysing sequence conservation.
The proportion of exonic and intronic sequence in the
inflammatory region that is covered by conserved elements is much higher (81% and 10% respectively) than
the genomic averages (66% and 3.6% respectively) [16],
reflecting the high conservation of the inflammatory
region. This is true of all annotation classes except the
UTR class, which is poorly resolved, and contains a lower
proportion of conserved bases because the amount of
sequence in this class was over-estimated. Due to the high
conservation together with the high gene density of this
region, a much larger proportion of conserved elements
occur in exons (57%) and a much lower proportion in
intragenic regions (13%) than the genomic averages (18%
and 41.2% respectively).
We calculated the pairwise similarity of sequences within
phastCons-predicted conserved sequences. This simple
post hoc analysis lacks the sophistication employed in the
original prediction, but was effective in stratifying conserved elements into different classes and revealing clade-

specific features in the eutherian and marsupial lineages.
These elements are likely to include known and novel
repeats, sequence retro-transposed into the region after
the divergence of eutherians and marsupials, clade-specific features in proteins and clade-specific regulatory
regions. Such clade-specific elements could be evolutionarily important, as changes in gene regulation, rather than
gene products, are likely to play a major role in the phenotypic differences between marsupials and eutherians
[13]. New methods are now emerging that incorporate the
phylogeny into the prediction of conserved elements and
identify lineage-specific elements [39].

enhances the transcriptional level of this gene, indicating
that it is important for its transcriptional regulation [44].
Individuals with this allele have been shown to have an
increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction as well as
large-vessel-associated ischemic stroke [45]. As more disease association studies are carried out on the inflammatory region genes, it becomes increasingly important to
identify sequences which are potentially important to
gene function and regulation so that functional disease
associations can be detected. By cataloguing conserved
elements within this region it should be easier to correlate
SNPs with functionally important sequences.

Conserved regulatory elements
It is important to categorize conserved elements based on
their different patterns of molecular evolution to gain
insight into the potential function of the element [13].
There are 28 conserved elements within 1 kb upstream
and 17 within a 1 kb of the 3' end of any annotated gene.
Whereas regulatory regions can occur further up- and
downstream from genes, as well as within introns, these
closer elements are the best candidates for transcription
factor binding sites and regulatory modules. Indeed, the
previously identified conserved element upstream of TNF
(-207 to +27) with 65–70% sequence identity between
wallaby and eutherian sequences and 86% identity
between wallaby and opossum [43], contains the known
human and mouse regulatory module of TNF consisting
of three EST-1/ELK-1, a Jun-ATF2, three NFAT and a Sp-1
binding site [31,32].

Conclusion

TNF is a cytokine involved in the regulation of a diverse
spectrum of biological processes such as cell proliferation,
lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and coagulation. An excess
of TNF results in harmful inflammatory responses [40],
whereas under-expression for TNF has been shown to
contribute to pathogen susceptibility [41]. TNF has been
implicated in an array of diseases including autoimmune
disease and cancer. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter have disease
associations. A SNP at position -572 is associated with a
susceptibility to papillovirus 16-associated cervical cancer
[42]. The conserved element we identified encompassing
this -572 polymorphic site may therefore be important to
the regulation of TNF transcription. Many other SNPs
have been reported in the promoter region of TNF, some
with disease associations, but there are conflicting reports
in the literature on whether these polymorphisms have a
significant effect of TNF expression [43]. Recognition of
conserved elements will assist in identifying SNPs in the
TNF promoter that are likely to be functionally important.
Disease associated SNPs are not limited to protein coding
sequence or upstream elements but can also be found
within introns. A SNP within intron 1 of human LTA

We have constructed a rich dataset of mammalian
sequence from the well-conserved MHC Class III inflammatory region and used comparative methods to study its
evolution and analyse its sequence conservation. Our
results confirm the power gained by using two distantly
related marsupial species in comparative studies.
The wallaby genes in this region are highly conserved in
organisation and sequence relative to known eutherian
sequences. Analyses across taxa show that the linkage of
TNF, LTA (or its putative teleost homologue TNF-N),
APOM and BAT3 predates the divergence of teleosts and
mammals some 450 million years ago, consistent with the
functional importance of the clustering of MHC genes.
We have examined the character of sequence conservation
in the mammalian inflammatory region and identified
clade-specific elements. This is a necessary first step
towards identifying new regulatory elements, and may
prove useful for linking SNPs associated with disease susceptibility to gene function.

Methods
BAC sequencing
BAC MeVIA_66O5 was previously isolated, confirmed to
contain LTA, TNF and LTB [46] and selected for complete
sequencing. For the shotgun phase [47], pUC plasmids
with inserts of mostly 1.4–2 kb were sequenced from both
ends using the dideoxy big dye terminator chemistry [48].
The resulting sequencing reactions were analysed on ABI
sequencing machines and the generated data were processed by a suite of in-house programs [49] prior to assembly with the PHRED [50,51] and PHRAP [52] algorithms.
For the finishing phase, we used the GAP4 program [53]
to help assess, edit and select reactions to eliminate ambiguities and close sequence gaps. Sequence gaps were
closed by a combination of primer walking, PCR, short/
long insert sublibraries [54], oligo screens of such sublibraries and transposon sublibraries. The finished
sequence of MeVIA_66O5 has been submitted to the Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ databases [EMBL: CR925799].

Sequence annotation
Similarity features in the wallaby BAC sequence were
found by aligning proteins from the human RefSeq collection with the wallaby sequence using TBLASTN[55]. Three
known tammar wallaby genes from the region, TNF [GenBank: AF055915], LTA [GenBank: AF119336] and LTB
[GenBank: AY853666] were aligned with the wallaby BAC
sequence using BLAT [56]. Gene prediction was performed using GenomeScan [57], which was supplied with
human RefSeq proteins from the MHC region as its putative homolog set. Repeats were identified using RepeatMasker [58]. The annotation was then visualized using
GBrowse [59]. A curated annotation was constructed by
integrating the various annotation tracks and hand annotating individual genes.

(JGI 4.1), pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) (FUGU 4.0) and
zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Zv 6) as well as from previously
published work on zebrafish [8,61] and frog [3].
Analysis of sequence conservation
Genomic segments corresponding to the portion of the
wallaby inflammatory region contained in the BAC (from
MIC to C6orf47 plus 4–8 kb at either end) from the
human [NCBI Build 36.1:chr6:31563944-31746528],

genomes and from the unpublished cow genome [Btau_2,
March 2005:chr23:23180000–23322000] [62] were
obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser [63]. The cow
genome assembly was incomplete at the time this
sequence was extracted, however, it seems unlikely that
this would affect this region or our conclusions. Sequence
from the opossum inflammatory region was obtained
from the unpublished opossum genome [64]
[MonDom3:scaffold_42:17788098–18043098] via the
Monodelphis MHC browser [65]. A multiple alignment of
these sequences together with the wallaby BAC sequence
was constructed using MAVID 2.0 [66]. This was con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/281

verted into a wallaby- and a human-referenced alignment
by removing columns from the multiple alignment,
where the reference sequence contained gaps.
Conserved elements were predicted from both referenced
alignments using a phylogenetic hidden Markov model
(HMM) consisting of two states (conserved and non-conserved) implemented in phastCons [15]. Referenced
alignments were used because phastCons performed
poorly on the full multiple alignment. The HMM transition probabilities were treated as tuning parameters and a
variety of values, including the maximum likelihood estimates, were explored. The final analysis used μ = 0.0833
and ν = 0.03. This is the same choice used for the set of
aligned vertebrate genome sequences in Siepel et al. [15].
They obtained these values by constraining the proportion of coding sequence across the human genome that
was covered by conserved elements to be 65% and by
imposing certain smoothness requirements on the conservation. This choice of μ also corresponds to a prior on the
expected conserved element size of 12 bases. Phylogenetic
models for the conserved and non-conserved state were
fitted to the referenced alignment using unsupervised
learning. A conservation score, the posterior probability
of being in the conserved state, was also calculated. The
results of conservation analysis of the wallaby-referenced
sequence were visualised and integrated with annotation
data in GBrowse.
