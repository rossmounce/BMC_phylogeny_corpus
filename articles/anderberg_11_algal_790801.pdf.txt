Algal MIPs, high diversity and conserved motifs
Hanna I Anderberg†, Jonas ÅH Danielson† and Urban Johanson*

Abstract
Background: Major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) also named aquaporins form channels facilitating the passive transport
of water and other small polar molecules across membranes. MIPs are particularly abundant and diverse in
terrestrial plants but little is known about their evolutionary history. In an attempt to investigate the origin of the
plant MIP subfamilies, genomes of chlorophyte algae, the sister group of charophyte algae and land plants, were
searched for MIP encoding genes.
Results: A total of 22 MIPs were identified in the nine analysed genomes and phylogenetic analyses classified
them into seven subfamilies. Two of these, Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) and GlpF-like Intrinsic
Proteins (GIPs), are also present in land plants and divergence dating support a common origin of these algal and
land plant MIPs, predating the evolution of terrestrial plants. The subfamilies unique to algae were named MIPA to
MIPE to facilitate the use of a common nomenclature for plant MIPs reflecting phylogenetically stable groups. All
of the investigated genomes contained at least one MIP gene but only a few species encoded MIPs belonging to
more than one subfamily.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that at least two of the seven subfamilies found in land plants were present
already in an algal ancestor. The total variation of MIPs and the number of different subfamilies in chlorophyte
algae is likely to be even higher than that found in land plants. Our analyses indicate that genetic exchanges
between several of the algal subfamilies have occurred. The PIP1 and PIP2 groups and the Ca2+ gating appear to
be specific to land plants whereas the pH gating is a more ancient characteristic shared by all PIPs. Further studies
are needed to discern the function of the algal specific subfamilies MIPA-E and to fully understand the
evolutionary relationship of algal and terrestrial plant MIPs.

Background
General function and structure of MIPs

Major Intrinsic Proteins (MIPs) are pore forming membrane proteins found in virtually all types of organisms.
They have been shown to facilitate the passive transport
of a wide range of small, polar molecules such as water,
glycerol and urea [1-5]. MIPs are thought to have evolved
through an internal gene duplication creating a direct
repeat resulting in the twofold quasi symmetry of the
structure [6]. Even though the overall pairwise sequence
similarities can be low, all MIPs share some structural
features such as having six transmembrane helices (H1H6), connected by five loops (loop A-loop E), and two
highly conserved NPA motifs. The NPA motifs are

located at the N-terminal end of two half helices, HB and
HE, formed by parts of loop B and loop E respectively.
These two half helices are inserted from opposite sides of
the membrane and meet to form one of two selectivity
regions of the pore. The positive charges formed by the
helical dipoles of HB and HE are focused on the NPA
motifs, thereby effectively obstructing the passage of protons by means of electrostatic repulsion [7]. The second
restriction site of the MIP pore is called the aromatic/
arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter and consists of four
amino acid residues forming the narrowest part of the
pore. It is thought that the amino acid residue composition of this constriction site is the major determinant of
the substrate specificity of MIPs [8].
Terrestrial plants have more isoforms and a wider
variety of MIPs than any other group of organisms.
Even in the genome of a relatively simple land plant like
a moss 23 different MIPs, divided on seven subfamilies,
are encoded [9]. Little is known on why, when and how

all these subfamilies evolved in plants. Land plants are
thought to descend from fresh water green algae and
thus identification and studies of algal MIPs can potentially provide clues to the origin and early evolution of
plant MIPs. The complete set of MIPs in nine algal genomes were therefore identified, analysed and compared
to land plant MIPs in this work.

The clade of green plants (viridiplantae) together with
the glaucophytes and the red algae (rhodophytes) form
the larger monophyletic clade archaeplastida (the plant
kingdom) which include all organisms with a chloroplast of primary endosymbiotic origin. The green plants
are divided into the chlorophytes (consisting only of
algal species) and streptophytes (containing both algae
and land plants) and these clades are thought to have
split 725-1200 Million Years Ago (MYA) [10-12] (Figure
1). The chlorophytes are further divided into several
classes and even though the internal relationship
between many of these classes is unresolved, there is a
general consensus that mamiellophyceae is basal to
chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae, which both belong
to the well-defined UTC clade [13]. The other group of
green plants, streptophytes, consists of a few classes of
green algae (collectively known as the paraphyletic
group charophyta) and the monophyletic group of land
plants (embryophyta). The green algae studied in this
work all belong to the chlorophyte clade with the
Ostreococcus and Micromonas species belonging to the
class mamiellophyceae [13], Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to the class chlorophyceae and
Coccomyxa sp. C-169 and Chlorella sp. NC64A to the
class trebouxiophyceae (Figure 1).
In this article, we identify 22 algal MIPs that cluster
into seven subfamilies whereof two, the Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) and GlpF-like Intrinsic
Proteins (GIPs), already have been characterized in land
plants. All the investigated algal genomes encode at
least one MIP, but only three contain more than one
subfamily. The characteristics of each of the seven subfamilies are described and the evolution of the wide
variety of algal MIPs, and their functions, is discussed.

chlorophytes (pink) and the streptophytes (light green) constitute
the two phyla of green plants. The chlorophytes are further divided
into a number of classes including chlorophyceae (yellow),
trebouxiophyceae (orange) and mamiellophyceae (red) whereof
mamiellophyceae is the basal clade. Terrestrial plants
(embryophytes; green) are part of the streptophyte phylum. The
position of red algae is indicated to root the schematic tree.

new gene models were created for the majority of the
genes (Additional file 1). In one of the algal genomes
(Ostreococcus tauri) no MIP genes were found initially.
However, repeating the searches of all genomes using all
algal MIPs discovered in the first round of searches as
queries revealed two more MIP sequences, whereof one
was from this species (OtMIPC1;1), resulting in a total
of 22 algae MIPs, see Table 1. Six of these MIPs are
found in the five species belonging to the class mamiellophyceae whereas the remaining 16 MIPs are derived
from the four species within the UTC clade. Coding
sequences for the algae MIPs are provided in FASTAformat (Additional file 2).
Sequence alignments

Results
Identification and annotation of algal MIP genes

Nine algal genomes available at the Joint Genome Initiative (JGI) [14] were searched for encoded MIPs using
protein sequences from Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii as queries [9,15]. This yielded
20 different MIP genes of which only two corresponding
complete sequences and one partial sequence were also
present in GenBank [16]. Less than half of the identified
algal MIP genes had a good model in JGI [14], hence

To take advantage of the high degree of structural conservation within the MIP family, a three dimensional
alignment of MIP structures was constructed and used
as a guide in creating a sequence alignment. Representatives of known subfamilies from all three domains of life
were then added and manually aligned to the initial
structure based sequence alignment. Thereafter the
identified algal sequences from the first searches were
added and aligned. Finally the number of reference
sequences in the alignment was reduced to a more

manageable subset still representing a wide variety of
MIPs from bacteria, land plants, mammals and viruses.
The highly divergent N- and C-terminal regions were
excluded in the phylogenetic analyses and therefore no
effort was put into aligning these. An overview picture
of the alignment showing gaps and the positions of conserved structural elements is shown in Figure 2. Also
indicated in the figure are the intron positions in the
gene models and their relative position to the reading
frame. Since these were not included in the dataset
underlying the phylogenetic analysis, the positions can
be used to verify the phylogenetic grouping of
sequences. The alignment file is provided in Nexus format as Additional file 3.
Phylogenetic analyses reveal seven groups of MIPs in
algae

In order to classify the algal MIPs, their protein
sequences were analysed phylogenetically together with
the reference set, using both the maximum likelihood
method [17] and the Bayesian method [18]. Results
from these analyses are also presented in Figure 2, displaying the Maximum Likelihood tree to the left, where
the branch lengths illustrate the sequence divergence,

and a consensus tree to the right, summarizing the
results of two different stability tests. In this tree the
stability of each node is shown by the Maximum Likelihood bootstrap support value together with indications
of Bayesian posterior probabilities of at least 90%.
In order to facilitate the interpretation, the phyla
from which the plant MIPs are derived are indicated
by colour coding of the branches in the consensus tree
in Figure 2. The 22 algal MIPs cluster into seven
groups whereof two are closely associated with the PIP
and GIP subfamilies found in land plants [9]. These
two groups of algal MIPs are therefore classified as
PIPs and GIPs. Classification of the remaining five
novel groups is not as straight forward and hence
these groups were arbitrarily named MIPA-MIPE.
There is no support for an endosymbiotic origin via
the chloroplast of any these subfamilies, since no close
homologs are found in cyanobacteria. In the next section the characteristics of each of the seven algal MIP
groups are described more in detail.

sequence alignment of the proteins included in the analysis whereas the black boxes at the top indicate the position of the structurally
conserved elements, transmembrane helices (H1-H6) and the NPA-boxes. The central portion of the alignment used in phylogenetic analyses is
delimited by the vertical dotted lines, excluding the N- and C-terminal regions. The coloured arrows indicate intron positions in the
corresponding coding sequence, where the colours represent the relative position within the codon. The tree to the left is the Maximum
Likelihood tree where the length of the branches is representative of sequence divergence. To the right a consensus tree based on the results
from the maximum likelihood analysis is depicted, showing the stability of the clustering of sequences. The bootstrap support in percent is
indicated at each node (nodes with bootstrap support lower than 50% are collapsed) and for nodes with a Bayesian posterior probability above
90% this number is also circled. Horizontal dotted lines separate clearly distinguishable clusters. The coloured branches in the consensus tree
highlight from which phyla the plant MIPs were derived, see also Figures 1 and 7.

support from both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian
inference (Figure 2). Aside from a general overall similarity, these sequences display many of the specific features
that are characteristic of PIPs, supporting a common origin and function of these proteins. The ar/R filters are
almost identical to the highly conserved filter of PIPs in
land plants, with the minor difference of the algal MIPs
having a cysteine instead of a threonine in the third position (Table 2). In the algal sequences loop A is slightly
longer (3-8 amino acids) but still contains the highly conserved cysteine found in plant PIPs [19] though offset by
two amino acids. The D loop, involved in gating of land
plant PIPs, has a conserved loop length and the histidine
required for pH gating [20] is also present. However, the
two N-terminal acidic residues indicated in calcium gating

[21] are lacking. The phosphorylation site in loop B is conserved (KXSXXR) whereas the C-terminal phosphorylation site specific for PIP2s [22] is not. Furthermore, the
GGGAN motif of loop C is fully conserved in one of the
algal sequences but only partially in the other sequence
(LGASN). Also at the gene level there is evidence of
shared ancestry for all PIPs, with two intron positions
being conserved (Figure 2). Considering these specific and
the general overall similarities, algal MIPs were classified
as PIPs but numbered CcPIP4;1 and CcPIP4;2, to reflect
their basal position in this subfamily.

Chlorella virus PbcvMT325 [AQPV1; 23] clustered
together with PpGIP1;1 with high support in the clade
containing glycerol channels from Gram positive bacteria.
The ar/R filters of these algal sequences are very similar to
the one of PpGIP1;1, suggesting that they are permeable
for glycerol (Table 2). They also contain the among glycerol channels conserved DXXXR motif just after the second NPA box, but are missing the very long C loop
unique for PpGIP1;1 as well as any conserved intron positions [Figure 2; 24]. However, similar to PpGIP1;1 these
sequences have a shorter loop preceding the first NPA
box and also atypical residues compared to other MIPs at
positions T72, F89 and Q93 (EcGlpF numbering). These
residues have been suggested to be involved in the packing
of the core near the first NPA box [6,24]. In the light of
their close association with PpGIP1;1 these MIPs were
named CcGIP1;1, CnGIP1;1 and PbcvMT325GIP1;1
respectively. It should be noted that the sequence of H4 is
poorly conserved in CnGIP1;1, making the functionality of
this particular protein questionable.

a threonine or serine and a conserved proline changed
to alanine, respectively. The C-terminal regions of the
algal sequences are rich in positively charged residues,
similar to those of SIPs and AQP11/12 where these residues have been suggested to have a function in ER
retention [28]. Overall the ar/R filter is quite different to
that of any characterised MIP and despite the fact that
the conserved arginine of the ar/R filter is lacking just
like in the SIPs and AQP11/12, they are not really comparable (Table 2). Even though these algal sequences
firmly grouped with the PpSIPs they showed an even
closer association with HsAQP11 and HsAQP12. This,
together with the very long branch lengths, led to the
classification of these sequences as a separate subfamily
and therefore named MpMIPC1;1, MrMIPC1;1 and
OtMIPC1;1 instead of being classified as SIPs.
MIPDs

Two sequences from Ostreococcus lucimarinus and
Ostreococcus RCC809 form a separate group. Both MIPs
have atypical NPA motifs (NPS in HB and NAA in HE)
and also lack the highly conserved motif leading up to
the first NPA box, suggesting an alternative conformation of this part of loop B. The ar/R filter of these
sequences is similar to the one in GLALlac [25] suggesting that both water and glycerol might be substrates.
These sequences were named OlMIPB1;1 and
OrMIPB1;1.

One group showed a weak association with the PpXIPs.
This was the most numerous group containing eight
MIPs with representatives from Coccomyxa sp. C-169,
Chlorella sp. NC64A, Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Consistent with the high bootstrap value
for this clade the corresponding genes share one or
more conserved intron positions in all except one case.
The members of this group display variation from an
otherwise conserved proline in H6 and instead have glutamine, glutamate, or in one case histidine at this position. They are also distinguished by the unusually short
H1 and H2 and by two strictly conserved cysteines in
loop C and in the loop after HE respectively. None of
these features are found in XIPs, except for a conserved
cysteine in the variable C-loop that can be aligned at a
corresponding position. Based upon their ar/R filter
these algal sequences can be divided into two groups
(Table 2). One group have filters similar to that of
CrMIPD1;1, which has already been shown to be permeable to glycerol [15] and one group similar to OsTIP4;1
[29] suggesting water and glycerol as substrate for these.
The MIPs in the two groups were named MIPD1 and
MIPD2 to MIPD4, respectively, in accordance with the
phylogenetic classification (Figure 2; VcMIPD4;1, data
not shown). It should be noted that VcMIPD4;1 has a
unique substitution in the ar/R filter where the arginine
is replaced by histidine.

MIPCs

MIPEs

Three sequences from Micromonas pusilla CCMP1545,
Micromonas RCC299 and Ostreococcus tauri grouped
with the PpSIPs and the human AQP11 and AQP12.
These MIPs all lack a conserved glycine in H2, suggested to be important in the packing of the helices
[26,27]. All three proteins have unusual substitutions in
H3 and H6 where a conserved glutamine is replaced by

The group containing three sequences from Chlorella sp.
NC64A and one from Ostreococcus RCC809 was named
MIPE. They all have ar/R filters identical to that of algal
PIPs and also share a conserved motif in loop E (DGCS,
where the cysteine is situated at LE1 of the ar/R filter) with
these (Figure 3). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the
C-terminal region show that these parts of the MIPEs and

MIPA

The remaining five algal MIP groups were named
MIPA-MIPE arbitrarily. A single sequence from Coccomyxa sp. C-169 showed no apparent association with
any other sequence and was named CcMIPA1;1. In this
MIP the first NPA box is substituted to NPM, a variation that is seen at the second NPA motif in several
other isoforms e.g. PpNIP6;1. tBLASTn searches suggest
weak similarity to plant HIPs, TIPs and animal AQP8s.
In line with this the ar/R filter resembles that of
AtTIP2;1 which have been shown to be permeable to
water, urea and ammonia (Table 2).

P. patens PIPs. For each of the three groups compared, the iceLogo shows the position specific over- and under representations of amino acids
compared to an alignment of all MIPs included in the phylogenetic analysis. Only amino acids significantly different in the test- and reference
set (P < 0.05) are shown and the size of the character reflect the difference in frequency (positive values are overrepresented whereas negative
values are underrepresented in the test set). At the bottom the amino acid sequence and numbering of SoPIP2;1 is shown to ease orientation.

algal PIPs are closely related (data not shown). The MIPEs
also share a motif in loop C with the mammalian classical
aquaporins (LXXN). In addition, OrMIPE1;1 shares significant sequence similarity with OlMIPB1;1 and OrMIPB1;1
in loop E (Figure 4). It should be noted that CnMIPE1;3 is
missing sequence information corresponding to half of
H4, loop D and most of H5 due to a gap in the available
genomic sequence.

Posterior Density (HPD): 543-1055 MYA) and the GIP

MYA). In light of the similarity of the C-terminal part
of the algal PIPs and MIPEs a divergence dating where
this part was excluded from all sequences was also performed. The split of the PIPs was then estimated to 737
MYA (geometric mean, 95% HPD: 547-987 MYA). For
further details see supplemented log-files (Additional
files 4 and 5).

Divergence dating

To investigate if there is any support for a horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) event in the evolution of plant
MIPs a divergence dating was performed. Of particular
interest is the timing of the split between chlorophyte
and streptophyte PIPs and the split between chlorophyte/virus and streptophyte GIPs. The PIP split was
estimated to 765 MYA (geometric mean, 95% Highest

Discussion
Algal MIPs

Land plants contain more isoforms and subfamilies of
MIPs than other organisms, but how and when this
diversity evolved is presently not known. In an attempt
to resolve these issues we identified and analysed all
MIPs encoded in nine publicly available algal genomes.
These algae belong to the chlorophyte clade, making
them all equally distant relatives of land plants. At the
present there are unfortunately no available genomes
of the charophyte algae, which are more closely related
to terrestrial plants. In total 22 MIPs were identified
and divided into seven subfamilies representing a wide
range of variation. Five of the subfamilies, MIPA to
MIPE, are specific for algae whereas two, GIPs and
PIPs, have previously only been known from terrestrial
plants. In the next paragraphs the subfamilies are discussed in detail. The MIPEs are discussed together
with the PIPs and MIPBs since they seem to be partially interconnected.

Evolution of PIPs and MIPEs

The algal PIPs show many similarities with the PIPs of
land plants and it is tempting to make the assumption
that PIPs, with those shared features, were present
already some 1000 MYA at the split of the chlorophytes
and the streptophytes [10-12]. Land plant PIPs are
known to be regulated by pH, Ca2+ and phosphorylation
and a molecular gating mechanism has been suggested.
In this, several of the residues have overlapping functions in controlling the D-loop conformation in
response to the different signals. However, the evolution
of the gating mechanism is likely to have been a stepwise process, starting out from a primitive regulatory
mechanism and then sequentially adding further functionality. The presence of an among all PIPs conserved
histidine crucial for pH gating [H193 in SoPIP2;1; 20,
21] in the algal PIPs, implies that this regulatory feature
might be such a primitive mechanism. Contrary to this,
the acidic amino acid residues responsible for Ca 2+
binding (D28 and E31 in SoPIP2;1) are not found in the
algal PIPs, suggesting that the Ca2+-dependent gating is
a later acquired trait. This is intriguing as the proposed
pH gating mechanism postulates that a salt bridge
between H193 and D28 is stabilizing the closed conformation, hinting at an alternative pH dependent interaction in the algal PIPs. Such an alternative interaction
might instead include a salt bridge to a phosphorylated
serine located in the conserved phosphorylation motif of
the B-loop (S115 in SoPIP2;1). In the C-termini of PIP2s
there is a second phosphorylation motif, also regulating
the gating. The fact that this motif is only found in
PIP2s and that the algal PIPs are basal to the PIPs identified in land plants, suggests that this regulation is the
most recent addition to the gating mechanism.
PIPs are only present in one of the nine analysed species but an additional partial PIP sequence was found in
Parietochloris incise, a relative to Chlorella NC64A (data
not shown). However, their absence in all but two of the
analysed species means that they have been lost not just
once but at least three times in the chlorophytes if a
strict vertical inheritance is assumed. An alternative
explanation of the observed erratic distribution of PIPs
would be a HGT between ancestors of embryophytes
and the chlorophyceae, a scenario that would only
require two steps.
The fact that the C-terminal part of the algal PIPs,
after an among PIPs conserved intron, is more closely
related to the corresponding part of the MIPEs might
suggest shuffling of DNA between the different MIP
genes (Figures 2 and 3). The ar/R filters suggest that
both algal PIPs and MIPEs are water specific channels
and thus functionally redundant in this aspect, which
also is consistent with the finding that MIPEs and PIPs
are not detected in the same genome of extant

Page 8 of 15

organisms. Regardless of inclusion of the MIPE-like
part, the divergence dating indicates that the split
between algal and embryophyte PIPs happened some
750 MYA long before the evolution of terrestrial plants,
when the two lineages still might have shared an aquatic
habitat [30]. The presence of a MIP in a Chlorella virus
(PbcvMT325GIP1;1, former AQPV1) [23] suggests a
possible vector for HGT. However, a vertical inheritance
of PIPs cannot be excluded since the estimated divergence (547-987 MYA) overlap with the suggested time
range for the split of chlorophytes and streptophytes
(725-1200 MYA). Nonetheless, the dating propose that
an ancestral PIP was present in the early streptophyte
algal lineage leading to land plants, suggesting that
extant species in the sister clade of terrestrial plants, e.g.
Chara corallina, could encode PIPs with some of the
common characteristics found in algal and embryophyte
PIPs. Thus pH gating would be expected in algal PIPs
but perhaps not Ca2+ inhibition. In the presently known
algal PIPs there is a cysteine in the ar/R filter predicting
that these water channels are sensitive to inhibition by
mercury [31], consistent with experimental findings in
charophytes [32]. However, since this residue is in the
C-terminal part of the protein, which appears to be
more related to MIPEs than PIPs, the ancestral state at
this position in early algal PIPs remains uncertain.
GIPs

GIPs are found in mosses but not in seed plants. Due to
the similarities between P. patens GIP and GLPIIs of
bacteria a HGT event has been suggested. Based on
sequence divergence this event is thought to have
occurred about 1000 MYA [24]. A second HGT event
between algae provides the simplest explanation of the
sparse distribution of GIPs among plants. However, just
as for the PIPs, the divergence dating of algal and P.
patens GIPs is unable to discern a vertical inheritance
from a scenario involving a second HGT event.
In any case, it appears that both a water channel and a
glycerol uptake facilitator were acquired early on in the
algal lineages leading to trebouxiophyceae and land
plants.
MIPA

There is only one unique sequence representing the
proposed new subgroup of MIPA. This protein appears
to be fully functional since, apart from the substitution
in the first NPA box, all hallmarks of a typical MIP are
present. Thus it is unlikely to be a freely evolving pseudogene and might rather be a MIP distantly related to
HIPs, AQP8s or TIPs as suggested by the ar/R filter.
The finding of three additional subfamilies (PIPs, GIPs,
and MIPDs) in the same organism (Coccomyxa C-169),
whereof two are also present in land plants, supports

Anderberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/110

Page 9 of 15

the classification of this sequence as belonging to a
separate evolving subfamily rather than being a distant
member, diverged by speciation from any of the other
subfamilies.
MIPBs and MIPEs

The two sequences in the MIPB subfamily are highly
similar, consistent with them being derived from closely
related algae. Both these proteins have unusual NPA
boxes where the first and second motifs are substituted
to NPS and NAA, respectively. In most other MIPs both
prolines are strictly conserved indicating that they are
crucial for the formation of the pore as they hold the
N-terminal ends of helices HB and HE together by van
der Waals interactions. The recently solved structure of
PfAQP which has NLA and NPS instead of the NPA
motifs suggests that the loss of van der Waals interactions between the NPA boxes in MIPBs is compensated
for by formation of a hydrogen bond, from the amide
nitrogen of the alanine replacing proline, to the hydroxyl
group of the serine in the NPS motif [33]. The relatively
rare occurrence of MIPs with alternative NPA motifs,
having this type of interaction, indicates that the two
kinds of interactions may not be completely functionally
equivalent. Based on the interspersed distribution
among the subfamilies of the alternative interaction it
appears as if it has evolved independently several times.
This might therefore be an example of convergent evolution resulting in similar functional characteristics. In
this context it is also interesting to note that another
algal MIP, CnMIPE1;2, has NAA and NPT at the first
and second NPA motif, respectively. In this MIP, the ar/

R selectivity region deviates from the canonical water
specific filter found in the other MIPEs, supporting a
different transport function.
Although MIPBs are distinctly different from all other
MIPs they also share some of the characteristics found
in the MIPEs. As can be seen in Figure 2, the loop connecting HE and H6 is extra long in MIPBs and
OrMIPE1;1. The high level of sequence similarity suggests that part of the OrMIPE1;1 gene, encoding this
loop and half of HE, derive from a MIPB gene since
none of the other MIPEs have this sequence (Figure 4).
In addition MIPBs and some MIPEs share unusual
substitutions at positions that are part of a structurally
conserved network of hydrogen bonds indirectly anchoring the short cytosolic C-terminal helix in AQP5 and
the D-loop in the closed conformation of SoPIP2;1 [34].
At two positions in this network, at the beginning of
H3, all MIPBs and MIPEs have unusual substitutions
where glutamine and asparagine replace arginine and
tyrosine, respectively. Furthermore, an among most
MIPs conserved histidine in the B loop is replaced by
glutamine in MIPBs, OrMIPE1;1 and CnMIPE1;1. These
substitutions suggest that a different network of interactions can be expected in MIPBs and MIPEs (Figure 5),
possibly causing changes in the properties of the cytosolic portion of the pore by affecting the conformation of
the B-loop preceding the first NPA box.
MIPCs - superaquaporins?

The MIPCs form a well-supported subfamily which
associates closely with AQP11/12 and the SIPs. It might
be argued that they should all be classified as one

subfamily, the superaquaporins [26]. There are a few
common features supporting such a classification, they
are for example all rich in positively charged residues in
the C-terminal, a property thought to be important for
ER retention and all have a non-standard first NPA
motif. However, except for these similarities no other
common conserved motifs can be identified and there is
a possibility that this grouping is due to long branch
attraction, i.e. they are united by their dissimilarity to all
other MIPs (see Figure 2), instead of by an actual shared
ancestry. This might also explain why the MIPCs seem
to be more closely related to AQP11/12 than the SIPs.
Another more speculative explanation would be that
AQP11/12 in fact originated from an algal MIPC via
HGT. The uncertain evolutionary relationship of MIPCs
and the other MIP groups in this clade might in fact be
one of the strongest arguments for the classification of
MIPCs as a separate subfamily. One unusual feature
that is found in the MIPCs but not in the associated
groups is the lack of the highly conserved Q and P in
H3 and H6 respectively, a characteristic they share with
the MIPDs (see MIPD discussion below), possibly suggesting an alternative packing of the helices in the
monomer.
MIPDs are more symmetric

As previously mentioned all MIPs have an internal symmetry believed to derive from a duplication of an ancestral gene encoding only half of the present MIP
sequence. According to this evolutionary hypothesis the
first and second half of the protein were initially identical but have later diverged. Beside the NPA motifs there
are symmetrically conserved residues in all corresponding transmembrane helices in the first and second half
of the MIPs [35]. However, during evolution functional
constraints have also selected and conserved residues
that create some asymmetries in the protein. The ar/R
filter is one such asymmetric feature that is now present
in all MIPs. Another less studied feature is found in
helices HB-H3 of the first repeat and the corresponding
helices HE-H6 of the second repeat (Figure 6). In H6
there is a conserved proline preventing the formation of
a hydrogen bond in the a-helix and resulting in a backbone carbonyl oxygen pointing towards the nitrogen of
the proline in the NPA box. At the corresponding position in H3 there is a conserved glutamine that appears
to occupy the same position as the backbone carbonyl
group in H6. These features are conserved in MIP structures, but interestingly some algal MIPs display a subfamily specific variation at these two sites. MIPCs, but
not SIPs or AQP11/12, have serine or threonine in H3
and alanine in H6, suggesting a different interaction in
this part of the protein. Another variation is found in
GIPs that have a glutamate or an asparagine in H3,

Page 10 of 15

conservative replacements that might not change the
interactions in these areas much. However, in MIPDs
the glutamine in H3 is conserved but the proline in H6
is substituted to glutamine, glutamate and in one case
to histidine. This suggests that MIPDs are more symmetrical than other MIPs and thus in this regard, possibly
more similar to an ancestral MIP. The fixation of the
asymmetry in all other MIPs indicates a functional
advantage, however the effect of this substitution is not
clear and has not to our knowledge been addressed
experimentally.
Distribution and function of subfamilies

The distribution of all the MIP subfamilies in different
phylogenetic groups of plants is summarized in Figure
7. Compared to terrestrial plants, chlorophyte algal species in general have fewer subfamilies. Based on this
limited dataset trebouxiophyceae have the highest number of subfamilies (3-4), followed by mamiellophyceae
(1-2) whereas chlorophyceae only have a single subfamily. Still the diversity of MIPs in chlorophytes at large
appears to be higher than that of land plants, resulting
in a large number of subfamilies with an interspersed
species distribution. A similarly complex picture was
seen in a study of the ammonium transporters (AMT)
presenting several chlorophyte specific subfamilies [36].
The reason for the variation is not clear but it is possible that a more careful comparison of lifestyle or habitat
will reveal a logical pattern that can provide clues to the
MIPs physiological function. Interestingly, trebouxiophyceae algae are not only found as free living organisms in
aquatic habitats but also as symbionts in protozoa and
lichen, and as a part of aeroterrestrial biofilms [37].
More specifically, some Coccomyxa species are free living terrestrial algae [38], whereas Chlorella NC64A is an
endosymbiont of the ciliate Paramecium bursaria [39].
We speculate that the large number of MIP subfamilies
found in members of trebouxiophyceae is part of an
adaptation to these particular lifestyles. For an endosymbiont it is easy to envision that a facilitated exchange of
solutes with the host would be beneficial, whereas the
solute concentrations possible in terrestrial environments might favour a passive mode of uptake in free living non-aquatic plants.
It has been suggested that the capability to accumulate
polyols, such as glycerol, is a prerequisite for algae to
endure the harsh conditions in aeroterrestrial habitats
[38]. In yeast, that might also experience variable conditions, it has been shown that glycerol can function as an
osmoprotectant. Interestingly the opening of a glycerol
facilitator, belonging to the MIP family, mediates adaptation to hypo-osmotic conditions by the rapid release
of intracellular glycerol [40]. Thus, it is plausible that
the physiological role of GIPs is to provide algae with

Figure 6 Structural alignment of internal symmetry. All MIPs consist of 6 transmembrane helices and two half helices, HB and HE, that
together form a seventh transmembrane domain, as illustrated by the cartoon representation of the AQP4 structure to the left (PDB ID: 3GD8).
Internal sequence similarities and the two-fold quasi symmetry suggest that MIPs have evolved through an internal duplication. Highlighted in
green are the structural elements H3 and HB, whereas corresponding parts in the second repeat are coloured in magenta. The close up to the
right depicts a structural alignment of these elements showing asparagine and proline of the NPA motif at the beginning of HB and HE as
sticks. The side chain of the conserved glutamine in H3 is directed towards the nitrogen of the NPA proline in HB. In almost all MIPs the
corresponding interaction in the second half of the protein is provided by a backbone oxygen in H6. This is possible due to a conserved proline
hindering an a-helical H-bond within H6. Interestingly, the proline in H6 is not conserved in MIPDs which in general have glutamine or
glutamate at this position, suggesting that these MIPs are more symmetrical. This structure might in fact resemble the ancestral form created by
the internal duplication.

the same ability to adapt to the extreme hypo-osmotic
challenges in aeroterrestrial habitats posed by e.g. rain
or melting snow.
Regarding the free living aquatic algae of this study we
note that in some species of fish, MIPs have an important physiological function, regulating the buoyancy of
the egg by adjusting the water content and thereby controlling the depth and hence the milieu for the developing egg [41,42]. It seems possible that a similar
regulation can occur in free living algae in order to find
optimal conditions for photosynthesis, uptake of nutrients, transport by currents or possibly to escape
predators.
Studies on membrane localization and of substrate
specificity will be important tools to discern the functions of the different subfamilies. At the present, we can
only speculate that for example in Coccomyxa, MIPA
could functionally correspond to TIPs in land plants
and thus has a different function than the GIPs and
PIPs encoded in the same alga.
As mentioned before, PIPs and MIPEs are likely to
have the same or very similar functions and that might
be an explanation to why they have not been found in
the same organism.

MIPB and MIPC are only found in mamiellophyceae
and MIPD only in chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae.
This might indicate that these MIPs have a shared ancestry and subfamilies only reflect the evolutionary distance
between the different species. Although, the phylogenetic
tree presented in Figure 2 is consistent with an orthologous relationship between these algal MIPs, there is no
significant support for the nodes connecting these three
subfamilies. Furthermore, the ar/R selectivity filters are
distinctly different, suggesting differences in substrate
specificity and hence physiological function. For the plant
MIPs shared between different phyla, our current understanding suggests several HGT events in the evolution of
MIPs as the simplest explanation for the observed distribution and complex MIP families found in some algae
and land plants. However, this could easily change as
more algal genomes become available. Genomes of charophyte algae will be especially informative, bridging the
gap between chlorophyte algae and land plants to give a
clearer picture of the evolution of the plant MIPs.

Conclusions
In this article the first extensive identification and classification of algal MIPs is presented. 22 different MIPs

Figure 7 Overview of identified MIP subfamilies in green plants. A schematic tree showing the evolutionary relationship between green
plant lineages is combined with a table summarizing the distribution of plant MIP subfamilies. MIPA-E constitutes novel subfamilies identified in
this study. The PIP and the GIP subfamilies appear to have evolved before the split of the chlorophyte and the streptophyte lineages. For all
plants except S. lycopersicum and P. incise the number of MIPs is derived from annotations of whole genomes [9,55,56]. a) The occurrence of
MIPs in S. lycopersicum is based on an extensive analysis of ESTs [57].

from nine species are analysed and classified into seven
distinct subfamilies, representing the wide variation of
MIPs found in green algae. None of the analysed species
lack MIPs completely but most of them only contain a
single subfamily. The multitude of subfamilies found is
less likely to have been present in a common ancestor
of green algae, but rather appears to have evolved later
in the different algal lineages by a combination of vertical inheritance, HGT, and recombination between MIP
genes. In this work, algal members of two of the seven
subfamilies present in land plants are identified for the
first time, suggesting that these subfamilies had formed
long before land plants appeared. We also suggest that
concentration gradients posed by terrestrial habitats
favoured the accumulation of the many variants of passive transporters, i.e. MIPs, found in extant land living
algae and embryophytes.

Methods
Identification and annotation of algal MIP genes

The genomes of the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,
Volvox carteri, Coccomyxa sp. C-169, Chlorella NC64A,
Micromonas pusilla CCMP1545, Micromonas RCC299,
Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Ostreococcus RCC809 and

Ostreococcus tauri, available at the Joint Genome Initiative [14] were searched for MIP encoding genes using
tBLASTn. First the Coccomyxa genome was searched
using amino acid sequences of MIPs from Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii as
queries. The MIPs identified in this search were then
also included as queries in tBLASTn searches of the
other genomes.
Genome sequences around hits were inspected for
existing gene models, which were evaluated and kept if
found to accurately represent a MIP gene. If models
were missing or likely to be incorrect, new models were
made by manual annotations of the genomic sequences.
When satisfactory models neither existed nor could be
built, hits were believed to be pseudogenes and were
excluded from the analysis. Gene models were evaluated
by comparing their amino acid sequences to these of
known MIPs, emphasizing the existence of conserved
residues and constraints on the lengths of transmembrane and loop regions.
Sequence alignments

Initially a structural alignment was done using DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer v4.0.1 and the structures of

Anderberg et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/110

BtAQP1 (1J4N [43]), EcGLPF (1LDA, [44]), EcAQPZ
(1RC2, [45]), SoPIP2;1 (1Z98, [21]), RnAQP4 (2D57,
[46]), MmAQPM (2F2B, [47]), PfAQP (3C02, [33]),
HsAQP5 (3D9S, [34]) and BtAQP0 (2B6P, [48]). This
structural alignment was then used as reference when
building the alignment used for phylogenetic analyses in
MEGA4 [49]. The sequence alignment used for the phylogenetic analysis was constructed by reducing the number reference sequences while trying to maintain the
diversity, and by removing the highly variable N- and Cterminal regions of the sequences. The GI-numbers and
amino acid sequence alignment (Nexus format) are provided as Additional files 6 and 3.

the 95% confidence interval. The protostomia/deuterostomia split was set to 531.5-551.9 MYA, the actinoptergyii/sarcopterygii split was set to 416.0-421.8 MYA, the
archosauria/mammalian split to 312.3-330.5 MYA [53]
and the bryophyte/polysporangiophyta split was set to
443.0-490.2 MYA [54]. The alignments used were similar to the one used for the phylogenetic analyses but
some sequences were added to encompass all of the
calibration points and some were removed to reduce
complexity. The analysis was based on amino acid
sequences. For further details concerning in-data and
settings consult the XML-files (Additional files 7 and 8).

Additional material
Phylogenetic analyses

Maximum Likelihood analysis was carried out using the
software PHYML (Version 2.4.4) [17]. In the analysis
the JTT amino acid substitution model was used, the
proportion of invariable sites was set to be estimated,
the number of substitution rate categories was set to 4
and the gamma distribution parameter was set to be
estimated. To assess the robustness of the best tree
bootstrapping with 1000 replicates was performed. For
the remaining parameters the default settings were used.
For Bayesian Inference analysis, the program MrBayes
(Version 3.1.2) was used [18,50]. The analysis was run
with default setting with the following changes: (1) In
the likelihood model used, a portion of the sites were
invariable while the rate variation of other sites were
assumed to be gamma distributed, (2) The rate matrix
for amino acid substitution was set to “mixed model”, in
which the Markov chain samples each model according
to its probability, (3) The analysis was set to include 5
chains per run with a temperature of 0.2 and for each
chain to run for 2 000 000 generations, sampling every
100th tree. The first 25% of the sampled trees were discarded as burn in for the analysis.
IceLogo

IceLogos for positions 196-233 (SoPIP2;1 numbering) of
the MIPEs, the algal PIPs and for P. patens PIPs were
created in the iceLogo program (Version 1.2) [51] using
the sampling mode. Corresponding positions from all
sequences of the sequence alignment were used as the
reference set. The sampling type was set to terminal
with the terminal index 1 (N-terminus) and the iteration
size to 500.
Divergence dating

Divergence dating was performed using the BEAST software package under a relaxed molecular clock [52]. The
age of nine nodes was constrained by fossil evidence
with prior probabilities distributed lognormally between
a strict lower bound and a “soft” higher bound set as
