Evolutionarily conserved bias of amino-acid usage
refines the definition of PDZ-binding motif
Takahiko Chimura1,2*, Thomas Launey2 and Masao Ito1

Abstract
Background: The interactions between PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domains and PDZ-binding motifs play central
roles in signal transductions within cells. Proteins with PDZ domains bind to PDZ-binding motifs almost exclusively
when the motifs are located at the carboxyl (C-) terminal ends of their binding partners. However, it remains little
explored whether PDZ-binding motifs show any preferential location at the C-terminal ends of proteins, at
genome-level.
Results: Here, we examined the distribution of the type-I (x-x-S/T-x-I/L/V) or type-II (x-x-V-x-I/V) PDZ-binding motifs
in proteins encoded in the genomes of five different species (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly and nematode). We
first established that these PDZ-binding motifs are indeed preferentially present at their C-terminal ends. Moreover,
we found specific amino acid (AA) bias for the ‘x’ positions in the motifs at the C-terminal ends. In general,
hydrophilic AAs were favored. Our genomics-based findings confirm and largely extend the results of previous
interaction-based studies, allowing us to propose refined consensus sequences for all of the examined PDZ-binding
motifs. An ontological analysis revealed that the refined motifs are functionally relevant since a large fraction of the
proteins bearing the motif appear to be involved in signal transduction. Furthermore, co-precipitation experiments
confirmed two new protein interactions predicted by our genomics-based approach. Finally, we show that
influenza virus pathogenicity can be correlated with PDZ-binding motif, with high-virulence viral proteins bearing a
refined PDZ-binding motif.
Conclusions: Our refined definition of PDZ-binding motifs should provide important clues for identifying
functional PDZ-binding motifs and proteins involved in signal transduction.

Background
The proteins that contain PDZ domain(s), often called
PDZ proteins, play pivotal roles in dynamically organizing molecular architectures at specific intracellular
regions in differentiating and differentiated cells [1,2].
Membrane proteins such as cell adhesion molecules,
receptors, and channels form functional clusters within
selective subcellular regions by binding to PDZ domains
[2-5]. Furthermore, some PDZ proteins also anchor specific cytosolic proteins such as protein kinases, cytoskeleton-regulating enzymes and second-messengerproducing enzymes [2,6], and hence, contribute to precise signal transduction between extracellular and intracellular spaces at specific sites such as postsynaptic

densities in neurons [2,7], immunological synapses in Tlymphocytes [8,9] and tight junctions in endothelial and
epithelial cells [1,10].
PDZ domain, an evolutionarily conserved globular
structure composed of 80-90 AAs (amino acids) recognizes particular regions of their interactors [6,11,12].
PDZ domains primarily bind to the C-terminal ends of
proteins. Interactions between PDZ domains and internal regions of their binding partners have been also
reported, though they are less common [2,11,12]. PDZbinding motifs (hereafter ‘PB motifs’) have been proposed by sequence similarity in the C-terminal ends of
proteins, whose bindings to PDZ domains are mediated
by their C-terminal ends. PB motifs are currently categorized into at least three major types on the basis of
two AAs located at positions 0 and -2 (Figure 1, upper
panel), both being essential for binding to PDZ domains
[11,13-15]. The type-I PB motif has the form S/T-x-I/L/

Figure 1 Preferential localization of two-position-specified PB motifs at C-terminal ends of proteins. Diagram on the top shows how
positions (0, -1, -2, -3, -4) in a five-AA long PB motif are defined. Position 0 is defined as the last AA of the motif toward the C-terminal end. C0:
the PB motif is located at the C-terminal end, C1: one AA away, and C50: fifty AAs away from the C-terminal end. (a-h) The “ratio” indicates the
number of genes identified at each C0 to C50 position divided by the number at C0. The AAs at positions 0 and -2 are specified at the upper
left in each graph. AAs are indicated with single letter code (S, serine; T, threonine; I, isoleucine; L, leucine; V, valine). × denotes any AA. Curves
for the five species are shown in different colors.

V, in which Serine (S) or Threonine (T) is positioned at
-2, any AA (x) at -1, and Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L) or
Valine (V) at 0. The Type-II PB motif has the form Fx-F (where F denotes any hydrophobic AA). The typeIII PB motif has the form D/E-x-F [11,12,14,16].

Although most of the reported PDZ-type interactions
are mediated via these canonical C-terminal motifs [17],
non-canonical C-terminal motifs are also reported
[18-20]. As for the recognition of internal region by
PDZ domains, studies based on tertiary structures

Chimura et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/300

revealed the binding mode of PDZ domains with internal amino acid sequences within protein fold resembling
a C-terminal end such as beta-hairpin “finger"-like
structure [21] and Aspartate residue whose side chain
mimics C-terminal end [22], suggesting that the recognition of internal sequences by PDZ domains requires
particular strict conditions. Although some internal
sequences are similar to those of C-terminal PB motifs
[21,23-25], this is not always the case [22,26,27] or even
not identified as “motifs” [28-30]. Overall, these internal
PB represents less than 5% of PDZ-PB interactions in
mammals [31] and are not included in the present
study.
Protein-level interaction analysis in recent decades
identified a number of protein bindings to PDZ domains
in vitro and in vivo and revealed that most of them possess PB motifs at their C-terminal ends. These C-terminal motifs play an essential role in the bindings to PDZ
domains because deletion of C-terminal regions or
mutations in these motifs abrogates the PDZ-type interactions. Furthermore, when one or more amino acid
residue(s) is added to the C-terminal side of the original
“functional” C-terminal PB motifs, PDZ domain cannot
recognize such “hidden” PB motifs [32-35]. These results
indicate that PDZ domains have a strong positional preference for PB motifs located at the C-terminal ends of
proteins. The short PB motif and multiple possible substitutions lead to loose definition of the motif however,
making it a very common feature in proteins. Thus its
presence at the C-terminal end of a protein cannot be
considered as a strong predictor of this protein being
involved in a PDZ interaction. Given the central role
played by PDZ interactions in signaling and protein
localization, it seemed important to revisit the issue of
the PB “consensus” motifs and try to refine its current
definition.
In order to solve this problem, in this report, we
focused on the best-characterized canonical type-I and
type-II PB motifs as model systems, and performed
genomics-based characterization of these PB motifs.
Based on the knowledge that functional PB motifs show
positional preference at the C-terminal ends in terms of
protein-protein interactions, we hypothesized that, also
at the genome-level, PB motifs should show similar
positional preferences, because if the encoded protein is
genuinely involved in a PDZ interaction important for
cell functions, genomes harboring mutations within
functional PB motifs at the C-terminal ends would face
selective disadvantage. Thus, selection pressure would
prevent mutations within the functional PB motifs at
the C-terminal ends. In contrast, random creation and
disruption of PB motifs by mutations are likely to occur
without affecting the cell functions, thus yielding a background scatter of PB motif in proteins. In order to test

Page 3 of 12

this hypothesis, we measured the frequency of occurrence of PB motifs at the C-terminal ends of proteins
relative to occurrence in the upstream fifty AAs region.
Because PDZ domains are evolutionarily conserved
[2,6,11,12,20], it is further expected that these patterns
would be conserved to some extent across species. Analysis of the genomes from five species representative of
major phylogenetic interval (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans) shows that PB motifs are indeed
preferentially located at the C-terminal ends of proteins,
which provides novel perspective on PB motifs.
The second point examined below is the preferential
AA usage at the position surrounding 0 and -2. For the
few PDZ domains proteins that have been previously
studied, it has been established that the AA residues
surrounding the canonical positions 0 and -2 also play a
role for recognition. For example, screen of peptides or
proteins binding to the well-characterized mammalian
Dlg protein family members, revealed that those proteins preferentially bind to type-I PB motif containing a
glutamate at position -3 [19,20,32,36]. Thus, from these
particular examples it can be inferred that for most PDZ
domain proteins, recognition of a PB motifs involves
surrounding AAs in addition to the canonical position 0
and -2. We present a new genomics-based bioinformatics approach to identify such preferred AAs, for the
most common variants of type-I and type-II PB motifs.
We demonstrate biased AA usage at positions -4, -3 or
-1, specifically for the PB motifs located at the C-terminal ends, relative to PB motifs found intra-proteins. In
general, hydrophilic (i.e. charged and polar) AAs were
favored. Importantly, our genomics-based approach also
identified the AAs previously identified by interaction
experiments, such as glutamate at position -3, thereby
validating the accuracy of our genomics-based sieve.
Moreover, the presence of these AAs at positions -4, -3
or -1 identified by genomics strongly correlates with
only a few specific ontological classes, most notably
transports across plasma membrane and intracellular
signaling, suggesting that the presence of PB motifs containing these preferred AAs (’refined PB motifs’) at Cterminal ends can serve as indicators for the function of
the proteins bearing the refined motif. Consistently, several novel bindings between PDZ proteins and proteins
possessing refined PB motifs were identified. We also
provide evidence showing clear correlation between the
AA compositions of PB motifs in influenza viral proteins
and their pathogenicity. Our findings thus refine the
“classical” PB motifs definition, as motifs having a strong
positional preference at the C-terminal ends of proteins
in terms of genomics, and several significant AA bias
among the -4, -3 and -1 positions. Experiment, ontological correlation analysis and co-evolution all show that

Chimura et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:300
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/300

the presence of a refined sequence at the C-terminus of
a protein is predictive of its genuine involvement in a
PDZ-type interaction and should accelerate the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying signal
transduction.

Results and discussion
Preferential positioning of PB motifs at the C-terminal
ends

We chose six frequently encountered variants of the
type-I PB motif (S/T-x-I/L/V). From the relatively small
amount of data on the type-II PB motif (F-x-F) [17],
we chose the two best-characterized variants, having the
form V-x-V/I [13,15,37,38]. From the protein sequences
of H. sapiens (58192 proteins, 20787 genes), M. musculus (37985 proteins, 22271 genes), D. rerio (21235 proteins, 18208 genes), D. melanogaster (20698 proteins,
14057 genes) and C. elegans (27287 proteins, 20003
genes) (Additional files 1 and 2, also see Materials and
Methods) obtained from the Ensembl genome database
project [39], we identified all the proteins containing
these five-AA motifs, ‘x-x-S/T-x-I/L/V’ or ‘x-x-V-x-V/I’
within their fifty five AAs C-terminal domain (Figure 1).
In this study, five residues (i.e. position 0 up to -4) were
taken into consideration, because point mutation analyses have demonstrated that residues playing critical
roles in binding to PDZ domains are mostly located
within C-terminal 4 or 5 residues [15,40].
The identified proteins were categorized as “C0, C1...
C50” based on the position of the motif, with “C0”
denoting a PB motif at the C-terminal end, “C1” denoting a PB motif one AA away from the C-terminal end,
and “C50” denoting a PB motif fifty AAs away from the
C-terminal end (Figure 1 and Additional file 1). Individual proteins in each category (i.e. C0-C50) consist of
the proteins derived from different genes and also of the
splice variants derived from a single gene. Since our
focus is on motif conservation among proteins derived
from different genes, we conserved only one record per
gene to eliminate the bias that would be introduced by
genes with high number of redundant splice variants.
Our pilot survey revealed that 84.6%, 82.7%, 80.7%,
77.4% and 79.7% of genes in the genome of the respective species listed above encodes proteins possessing at
least one PB motif at any C0-C50 positions, confirming
that the PB motifs are highly common AA sequence.
The rational for our approach is that if functional
motifs are preferentially located at the C-terminal end,
the number of genes identified at C0 should be significantly larger than those identified at positions other
than C0 (i.e. C1-C50). Indeed, we found that this was
the case (Figure 1 and Additional file 3). To compare
the numbers of genes at C1-C50 to that at C0, the number of genes found at each of the C1-C50 positions was

Page 4 of 12

divided by that at C0. We plotted these relative numbers
as ‘ratio’ in Figure 1. The ‘ratio’ is found to be lower
than unity (i.e. 1) in most cases, as shown in Figure 1ah for six type-I and two type-II PB motifs, in the five
species examined. Furthermore, the ratio decreases
abruptly between C0 and C1 rather than gradually, as is
evident for type-I PB motifs (Figure 1). These results are
consistent with previous reports showing that artificially
shifting PB motifs at the C1 position by addition of a
single residue at the C-terminal end abolishes the interactions between PB motifs and PDZ domains [33-35].
The genes identified by the C0 position search are
shown in the Additional file 4.
To statistically evaluate the overall extent to which
PBs are preferentially located at C0 relative to C1-C50,
we defined the ‘C-index’ as the average of the ratios calculated for C1-C50 positions (Figure 2).
Equation 1: Ci indicates the number of genes found
with a PB at position 1 ≤ i ≤ 50.

A C-index lower than 1 implies that the PB motif is
more often located at C-terminal end than within C1C50. For example, the C-index of the x-x-T-x-V motifs
in human is approximately 0.45 (Figure 2 and Additional file 3), which indicates that this motif localizes at
the C-terminal end with a probability 2.2-fold higher
than at C1-C50. As shown in Figure 2a-f, C-indexes are
generally significantly lower than unity for type-I motifs.
In contrast, for the two type-II PB motifs tested, the Cindex is statistically not different from unity in several
cases because of the large standard deviations of these
C-indexes (Figures 2g and 2h). Therefore, among all the
PB motifs considered here, the two type-II PB motifs
are less preferentially positioned at the C-terminal ends
of proteins than type-I PB motifs.
Biased amino-acid usage at positions -4, -3 and -1 of the
C-terminal PB motifs

Next we examined whether the AAs present at the positions -4, -3 and -1 in the C0 PB motifs show any biased
usage frequency compared to similar positions in PB
motifs located within C1-C50. For example, if a particular AA [X] is over-represented at position -4 in x-x-S-xV motif located at the C0 position but not for C1-C50
PB positions, the C-index of [X]-x-S-x-V would be
lower than the C-index of x-x-S-x-V (e.g. C and Y in
Figure 3a). In contrast, if such C0-specific over-representations is not the case, the C-index of [X]-x-S-x-V
would not vary with the AA-substitution in the [X],
showing values similar to that of x-x-S-x-V (Figure 3b).
This approach has the advantage of determining usage

bias in the context of a particular sequence, independently of the overall frequency of individual AA in proteins. Furthermore, the C-index provides an unbiased
normalization that only depends on the position of this
sequence along the C-terminal domain. Figure 3c-e
shows the actual C-indexes and standard deviations of
human x-x-S-x-V motif, in which twenty AAs are substituted in each “x” at positions -4, -3 and -1, respectively. The actual numbers of identified genes, C-indexes
and their standard deviations are listed in Additional file
5. It is clearly apparent that the C-indexes of the threeposition-specified PB motifs vary with the types of AAs
at positions -4, -3 and -1. In the case of human x-x-S-xV shown as an example here (Figure 3), the AA substitution D, I and R at position -4, E, K and Q at position
-3, and E, H, N, V and W at position -1 all result in significantly lower C-index than that of the two-positionspecified PB motif. This observation was confirmed for
all the variants of the PB motif examined here (Additional file 5). These results indicate that there are specific bias for the AAs surrounding PB motifs located at
the C-terminal ends. The results are summarized in the
Figure 4, showing all the AA substitutions that result in
significantly lower C-indexes than those of two-position

specified PB motifs. Among these substitutions, note
that glutamate (E) at -3 shows a very robust usage bias
(Figures 3c and 4, Additional file 5), across variants of
the Type-I and Type-II motifs as well as across distant
species, strongly suggesting that its presence in C-terminal PB motif results from an evolutionary process.
Since the PB motifs containing these AAs (’refined PB
motifs’) selectively appear at the C-terminal ends (Figure
3), such PB motifs are probably actually recognized by
PDZ proteins. If not, random mutations during evolution would have erased this selective localization at the
C-terminal ends of the refined PB motifs. Furthermore,
most of the identified AAs (Figure 4) are hydrophilic
ones including electrically charged AAs D, E, H, K and
R, and polar N, Q, S and T. Meanwhile, hydrophobic
AAs such as I, L and V, or AAs with simple side chain
such as G and A are rarely identified. This is consistent
with the previous reports that have demonstrated the
important roles of electrostatic interactions in the bindings between PB motifs and PDZ domains [41-43]. This
finding also support the notion that the refined PB
motifs are likely to be recognized by PDZ domains.
The additional AAs (Figure 4) in the refined PB motif
may also contribute to the regulation of PDZ binding.

As a case in point, a recent report [44] about the regulation of the NR2B NMDA receptor subunit may shed
some light on the physiological role of variations within
refined motifs. Sanz-Clemente and collaborators have
confirmed that the binding of NR2B to PDZ protein
PSD-95 is attenuated by casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated
phosphorylation of serine at position -2 within the typeI PB motifs of NR2B (-IESDV). A point mutation of E at
-3 to Q (i.e. -IQSDV) abolished phosphorylation by CK2
however, while binding to PSD95 was unaffected, which
is consistent with our findings that both E and Q at -3
are identified as biased amino acids at position -3 of xx-S-x-V (Figure 4e, column ‘-3’ and sub-column ‘h’ and
‘m’). Thus, we suggest that selection pressure may have
been directed not only toward increasing PDZ binding
affinity but also toward creating both constitutive and
regulated interactions.
Because amino acids identified in Figure 4 are evolutionarily conserved to some extent, orthologous genes should
be commonly identified in the species studied here. As
expected, this was the case. For example, our analysis
revealed that human and mouse genome encode 1089
genes and 972 genes that contain at least one refined PB
motifs at their C-terminal ends, respectively, in which 501
of human 1089 genes and 512 of mouse 972 genes are
orthologous to each other (Additional file 6).

To date, several approaches using bioinformatics to predict PDZ-type interactions have been implemented. For
example, Giallourakis and colleagues used evolutionary
conservation, similarity of coexpression profiles relative
to PDZ proteins in different tissues as well as the presence of PB motifs as criteria for their predictions [31].
Several strategies based on genome-wide proteomics
have also been formulated to identify binding sequences
of particular PDZ domains by screening of random or
genome-encoded peptide libraries in vitro [19,20,45].
Using such quasi-exhaustive analyses, computational
simulations to calculate binding affinity between any
PDZ domains and genome-encoded proteins have been
performed [46-48]. Although predictions can be made
as whether a protein may bind to PDZ domains, in vitro
screening of peptides is not exempt of artifacts that may
negatively affect prediction accuracy [49]. Similarly, prediction algorithms that are trained against a set of
known PDZ-PB interactions may be influenced by any
error or omission in the training set. Our approach is
orthogonal to these studies since it does not depend a
priori on experimental evidence and may thus provide
complementary information and help identify both false
positive and false negative. We used three different strategies to evaluate the quality of our predictions: An

ontological analysis, a comparison with some published
PDZ-type interaction data and an in vivo test of interactions predicted by our analysis.
If the refined PB motifs correspond to genuine
evolution-selected sequences, it is expected that the proteins possessing these PB motifs would present some
similarities of function. Furthermore, considering the literature on proteins with identified PDZ-type interactions
[1,2,6,11,12], it is expected that proteins involved in signal

transductions and membrane proteins should be overrepresented in this subset of C-terminal PB motifs. In
order to test a posteriori the quality of our predictions, we
determined whether any ontological category is overrepresented among the human proteins (1089 genes) that
possess the refined PB motifs shown in Figure 4 based on
the GO (Gene Ontology at http://www.geneontology.org/)
[50] molecular function term (Table 1). This analysis
showed that some functional categories are clearly

Significantly (p < 0.01) over-represented GO terms (Molecular Function) in the proteins possessing PB motif WITH the amino acids shown in Figure 4 are
identified by web-based tool PIPE2. The identified GO terms are indicated in the ‘GO term’ column. The number of genes categorized in the GO terms among

over-represented among the proteins with refined PB.
These include receptors of growth factors, G-proteincoupled receptors, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, kinases, proteins involved in trafficking, GTPaseactivating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs), all of which are important
players in signal transductions. In contrast, however,
no obvious function over-representation was detected
for the human proteins (488 genes in total) that did
not possess any of the -4, -3, -1 biases shown in Figure
4, despite the presence of a C-terminal classical PB
motifs. Taking that PDZ proteins play central roles in
trafficking and organizing molecular architectures containing membrane proteins and signaling proteins, the
results shown in Table 1 are consistent with our
refined PB motif definitions being better predictor of
molecular function than the classical PB motif.
Binding activities of PB motifs containing the identified
amino acids

Next, we further asked whether the presence of refined
PB motifs serves as a reliable indicator for the identification of PDZ-type interactions. For this purpose, we surveyed published quasi-exhaustive interaction data
[19,45], in which interactions between 157 mouse PDZ
domains and 217 genome-encoded C-terminal peptides
were tested in vitro. We found that 68 out of 217 peptides possess refined PB motifs (Additional file 7).
According to the aforementioned study, 61 out of 68 are
experimentally validated PDZ-binding peptides. Furthermore, 4 (Kir3.3, GluR3, EphA4 and ErbB2) out of 7
negative peptides, have already been shown to be PDZbinding proteins in other works [33,51-55]. Thus, combined with these results, 95% (65 out of 68) were true
positives.
These results prompted us to test in vivo some of the
predictions produced by in silico sequence analysis and
to examine bindings between PDZ proteins and proteins
possessing refined PB motifs shown in Figure 4. The

mammalian homologue of Drosophila Inscuteable
(mInsc) play important roles in defining cell polarity
during development [56]. mInsc possess a refined type-I
PB motif, x-E-S-x-V (Figure 5a), as identified in Figure
4e. However, it has not been shown whether the PB
motif is functional and allows mInsc to bind to PDZ
domains. This three-position specified PB motif is also
observed at the C-terminal ends of voltage-dependent
sodium channel Nav1.4 proteins (Figure 5a). Because
Nav1.4 binds to a PDZ protein PSD-95 [52], we predicted that mInsc would also bind to PSD-95. In order
to test this possibility, Flag-tagged mInsc and Myctagged PSD-95 were coexpressed in COS-7 cells and coimmunoprecipitation analyses were performed (Figure
5c). As expected, PSD-95 was coimmunoprecipitated by
mInsc (lane 1 in Figure 5c). Furthermore, deletion of Cterminal four AAs of mInsc disruputed this binding,
indicating that the binding between PSD-95 and mInsc
is mediated by the PB motif of mInsc. We also tried to
identify functional type-II PB motifs. As shown in Figure
5b, DTWD2, an unknown-function protein, possess
three refined type-II PB motifs N-x-V-x-I, x-S-V-x-I and
x-x-V-K-I, all of which are identified in Figure 4. Interestingly, two of them, x-S-V-x-I and x-x-V-K-I are also
found at the C-terminal end of GluR2, a subunit of
AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Considering that a
PDZ protein GRIP1 binds to the type-II PB motif of the
GluR2 [37,52,57], it is expected that DTWD2 also binds
to GRIP1. As shown in Figure 5d, the interactions
between DTWD2 and GRIP1 was indeed observed, in
which the type-II PB motifs of DTWD2 was essential.
Thus, we successfully identified functional PB motifs
based on the three-position specified PB motifs identified in our study (Figure 4).
Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the refined PB
motifs correspond to evolutionary selected sequences by
examining the co-evolution of virus pathogens. Several
types of virus express viral proteins that possess type-I
PB motifs at their C-terminal ends and bind to cellular

flu in Asia in 2003-2004 possess I-K-S-E-V and I-E-S-EV motifs at their C-terminal ends, respectively [62,63].
These correspond to some of the refined PB motifs
identified here, I-x-S-x-V, x-K-S-x-V and x-x-S-E-V in
Spanish flu NS1 (Figure 5e, top row) and I-x-S-x-V, xE-S-x-V and x-x-S-E-V in Avian flu NS1 (Figure 5e,
middle row). In contrast, the PB motifs of the NS1 proteins derived from low-pathogenic strains producing
seasonal flu (H3N2) correspond to a non-refined A-R-SK-V (compare to Figure 5e, bottom row). Interestingly,
two of the three-positions specified PB motifs, I-x-S-x-V
and x-K-S-x-V, found in highly pathogenic strain are
specifically found in human (Figure 4e, column ‘h’),
which may suggest that these strains of highly pathogenic influenza viruses have evolved to efficiently bind
to human PDZ proteins. These results suggest that the
three-position specified PB motifs should be evaluated
as potential indicators of viral pathogenicities.

proteins. (a) Comparison of the C-terminal sequences of mInsc and

Upper strain (A/Brevig Mission/1/1918(H1N1)) caused Spanish Flu in
1918 and middle (A/Hong Kong/213/2003(H5N1)) caused outbreaks
of avian influenza among humans in 2003-2004. The lower (A/New
York/1/2003(H3N2)) is shown as a representative example of a strain
that causes seasonal flu widely and predominantly spreads among
humans. AAs identified in Figure 4 are also indicated with different
colors (positions - 4, -3 and -1 are indicated in green, red and
yellow, respectively).

PDZ proteins [58]. The PB motif sequences of NS1 proteins, viral proteins of influenza, vary with the isolates of
influenza strains, whose pahtogenicity can correlate with
the binding activity of the PB motif of NS1 with cellular
PDZ proteins [59-61]. These results prompted us to test
whether NS1 derived from highly pathogenic strain possess the refined PB motifs shown in Figure 4. As shown
in Figure 5e, the NS1 proteins of the highly pathogenic
influenza viruses H1N1 that caused the “Spanish Flu” in
1918 and H5N1 that caused several outbreaks of Avian

Conclusions
We did a genome-level comprehensive study of the PB
motif variants present in five phylogenetically distant
species. We have shown that PB motifs are preferentially
located at the C-terminal ends of proteins, in line with
experimental results showing that PDZ interactions preferentially take place with C-terminal PB motifs. Our
analysis identified specific AA usage bias for the -4, -3
and -1 positions surrounding the “classical” two-position-specified PB motifs, x-x-S/T-x-I/L/V and x-x-F-xF. Ontological analysis of the proteins presenting this
refined C-terminal PB motifs revealed very specific bias
toward signaling and transport proteins. PDZ-type interactions are known to play key roles in these cellular
processes, suggesting that the protein subset with
refined PB motif are likely to be engaged in genuine
PDZ-type interaction. By correlating motif position with
sequence variation, the innovative analysis method presented here allows to detect fine variations in protein
motifs, across variants and across species, while not
requiring any training set. Being orthogonal with previously described strategies, we have shown that it provides a complementary approach to refine in silico
predictions. Because these in silico analyses are applicable to any species whose protein sequences are comprehensively registered into databases, the methodology
shown here has general applicability in discovering and
evaluating any protein motif with an identified positional biases.

by using BioMart (Additional file 1). A version of the
dataset was Release 55. Because each dataset contains
the information of single species, the following procedures were separately done for the five species. After
removing extraneous characters, each text line contains
a single gene ID, a single protein ID and a single protein
sequence. We further extracted protein sequences that
contain asterisks (*) denoting stop codons and more
than fifty-four AA long to perform the C0 to C50
searches (’dataset_2’ in Additional file 1). Specifically for
human datasets, proteins encoded in the haplotypic
chromosomal regions, denoted by chromosome name
HSCHR6_MHC_APD, HSCHR6_MHC_COX, HSCHR6_
MHC_DBB, HSCHR6_MHC_MANN, HSCHR6_
MHC_MCF, HSCHR6_MHC_QBL, HSCHR6_MHC_
SSTO, HSCHR4_1 and HSCHR17_1, were removed to
avoid multiple identifications of the same genes [64].
The numbers of proteins and genes in dataset_1 and _2
are shown in Additional file 2. Fifty-one data subsets
(’dataset_C0’ to ‘dataset_C50’ in Additional file 1) were
generated for each species, based on the position of the
motif within C0-C50, then C0-C50 searches were performed. All the Perl and UNIX scripts corresponding to
these steps are available upon request to the author.

washing, all precipitated complex were denatured in SDS
sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by
Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody (Santa

were also constructed. Transfection of these plasmids
into COS-7 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank) was performed
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
