Diversification of CYCLOIDEA-like genes in
Dipsacaceae (Dipsacales): implications for the
evolution of capitulum inflorescences
Sara E Carlson1,4*, Dianella G Howarth2 and Michael J Donoghue1,3

Abstract
Background: CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like genes have been implicated in the development of capitulum inflorescences (i.
e. flowering heads) in Asteraceae, where many small flowers (florets) are packed tightly into an inflorescence that
resembles a single flower. Several rounds of duplication of CYC-like genes have occurred in Asteraceae, and this is
hypothesized to be correlated with the evolution of the capitulum, which in turn has been implicated in the
evolutionary success of the group. We investigated the evolution of CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae (Dipsacales), a
plant clade in which capitulum inflorescences originated independently of Asteraceae. Two main inflorescence
types are present in Dipsacaceae: (1) radiate species contain two kinds of floret within the flowering head (disk and
ray), and (2) discoid species contain only disk florets. To test whether a dynamic pattern of gene duplication,
similar to that documented in Asteraceae, is present in Dipsacaceae, and whether these patterns are correlated
with different inflorescence types, we inferred a CYC-like gene phylogeny for Dipsacaceae based on representative
species from the major lineages.
Results: We recovered within Dipsacaceae the three major forms of CYC-like genes that have been found in most
core eudicots, and identified several additional duplications within each of these clades. We found that the
number of CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae is similar to that reported for members of Asteraceae and that the same
gene lineages (CYC1-like and CYC2B-like genes) have duplicated in a similar fashion independently in both groups.
The number of CYC-like genes recovered for radiate versus discoid species differed, with discoid species having
fewer copies of CYC1-like and CYC2B-like genes.
Conclusions: CYC-like genes have undergone extensive duplication in Dipsacaceae, with radiate species having
more copies than discoid species, suggesting a potential role for these genes in the evolution of disk and ray
florets. The similarity in CYC-like gene diversification seen in Dipsacaceae and some members of the Asteraceae
sets the stage to investigate whether the convergent evolution of capitulum inflorescences in both groups may
have been underlain by convergent evolution in the same gene family.

Background
Gene duplication is an important evolutionary force, providing the raw material for new genes that, if not lost,
may be co-opted to perform novel functions [1,2]. Gene
duplication has been implicated in the evolution of transcription factors that play key roles in developmental
pathways and are likely involved in morphological evolution [3,4]. In plants, for example, the MADS-box and

TCP gene families underwent duplication deep within
angiosperm phylogeny, and these duplication events are
thought to have played a role in major changes to flower
morphology [5-12]. TCP genes are less well studied than
MADS-box genes, but they are increasingly appreciated
for their role in generating diverse floral forms.
The TCP gene family is named for the conserved helixloop-helix (bHLH) TCP domain from TEOSINTE
BRANCHED1 (TB1) in Zea mays, CYCLOIDEA (CYC) in
Antirrhinum majus, and the proliferating cell factor (PCF)
DNA-binding proteins in Oryza sativa. In Arabidopsis, the
TCP gene family has 24 copies [13], which are divided

into a clade of PCF genes, which control cell growth, and a
clade of CYC/TB1 genes. These two clades differ in the
length and sequence of the TCP domain, and some members of the CYC/TB1 clade have an additional conserved
arginine rich “R domain” [14]. Within CYC/TB1 the
“ECE” clade [15] contains a group of genes with a conserved short motif (glutamic acid-cysteine-glutamic acid)
between the TCP and R domains. There are three major
clades of ECE genes in the core eudicots, and the duplications leading to these copies predate this major lineage
[10]. We refer to members of the ECE clade as “CYC-like”
genes. The best studied of these genes, CYC itself, is
required for the production of bilaterally symmetrical
(zygomorphic, monosymmetric) flowers as a function of
its expression in the dorsal portion of the floral meristem
[16-18].
While CYC-like genes have been primarily studied in
the context of floral symmetry in single flowers, they
have also been implicated in the development of the capitulum (or “head”) inflorescence in Asteraceae, a trait that
may be associated with the evolutionary success of this
group [19,20]. A typical capitulum consists of many small
flowers (florets) packed tightly into a condensed head
that can closely resemble a single large flower. In some
groups, the florets in different parts of the capitulum are
morphologically distinct. In radiate species, the outer
florets (rays) are bilaterally symmetrical while the inner
florets (disks) are radially symmetrical (actinomorphic,
polysymmetric). In discoid species, there is little or no
variation in floret morphology and the capitulum is composed of disk florets only. A third inflorescence type in
Asteraceae, characteristic of the Lactuceae, consists of a
capitulum with entirely bilaterally symmetrical flowers
(ligulate florets). In Asteraceae, the evolution of CYC-like
genes has been studied thoroughly in the radiate species
Helianthus annuus (the cultivated sunflower), where ten
copies have been recovered, which is more that in any
other species to date [21]. Such extensive gene duplication is thought to be correlated with the evolution of ray
versus disk florets [20,21]; however, this possible connection has not been investigated in any groups outside of
the Asteraceae, nor has copy number been compared in
clades with different inflorescence types.
Dipsacaceae (Dipsacales) is one of relatively few groups
outside of Asteraceae where the capitulum inflorescence
occurs and that also contains species with both radiate
and discoid heads (although intermediates between floret
types are present in radiate species and form a morphological continuum across the capitulum). Dipsacaceae is part
of the Valerina clade of Dipsacales [22] and contains ca.
300 species of perennial and annual herbs that are divided
into three main clades [23]: Bassecoia (3 spp.), Scabioseae
(ca. 150 spp.), and the Dipknautid clade (ca. 150 spp.), the
latter two of which comprise the “core Dipsacaceae”

Page 2 of 13

(Figure 1). Most Dipsacaceae species have radiate capitula,
with the exception of a few small lineages. These include
Bassecoia, which is sister to the remaining Dipsacaceae,
and two groups within the Dipknautid clade: Dipsacus (ca.
20 species) and a small clade composed of Succisa (three
species), Succisella (five species), and Pseudoscabiosa
(three species). Howarth and Donoghue [15,24] investigated the evolution of CYC-like and DIVARICATA-like
(DIV; a MYB gene family also involved in the floral symmetry pathway [25]) genes in Dipsacales, and found additional duplications of CYC-like genes in Dipsacus pilosus,
one of two representatives of Dipsacaceae included in the
analysis, as well as additional duplications of DIV-like
genes in Sixalix atropurpurea, the sole representative of
Dipsacaceae included in the study of DIV-like genes.
Given the unusual floral characteristics associated with
this group (e.g., the presence of a capitulum and a sometimes zygomorphic epicalyx [26]), further investigation of
CYC-like genes from a broader sampling of Dipsacaceae is
warranted.
The aim of this study is to investigate patterns of gene
duplication in CYC-like genes and relate patterns of gene
evolution to the evolution of radiate versus discoid inflorescences. We also seek to compare the diversification of
CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae to that reported for members of Asteraceae (e.g. Helianthus), to test for a similar
pattern of gene duplication. This study represents a first
step in eventually deciphering the involvement of CYClike genes in determining capitulum form and differences
in floral symmetry in Dipsacaceae.

Results
Phylogenetic Analysis

The combined matrix contains 121 sequences and 474
bases. Alignment of the TCP and R domains is unambiguous across taxa, however, the intervening region is difficult to align; therefore, we omitted ambiguous portions
of this region from the alignment. All datasets, as well
as the full-length alignments, are available in TreeBASE
http://www.treebase.org or upon request from the first
author. To improve phylogenetic resolution within
DpcCYC1 and DpcCYC2B, we analyzed these sequences
separately in order to align the intervening region
between the TCP and R domain. The aligned length of
the DpcCYC1 matrix was 369 bases with 19 sequences
and the DpcCYC2B matrix was 231 bases with 39
sequences. The tree topologies of the Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were congruent with only
minor differences in branch lengths, and consensus trees
are shown in Figures 2, 3, 4.
We recovered between 2 and 12 copies for each species. While we extensively screened 14 representatives of
the major lineages of Dipsacaceae, we did not recover all
hypothesized copies from each species, which may have

been the result of unsuccessful amplification or absence/
loss from those genomes. Our analysis recovered the
three main clades of CYC-like genes that have been
reported for core eudicots and the additional duplications
previously found in representatives of Dipsacaceae (i.e.
DipsCYC1, DipsCYC2Ba, DipsCYC2Bb, and DipsCYC3B)
[15]. We name the three major clades of Dipsacaceae
CYC-like genes: DpcCYC1, DpcCYC2, and DpcCYC3.
Also consistent with previous results is the sister relationship of DpcCYC2 and DpcCYC3. Novel findings
include copies DpcCYC2A and DpcCYC3A, whose orthologs had been inferred for other members of the

Dipsacales [15], and additional duplications within
DpcCYC1 (Figure 3) and within DpcCYC2Ba and
DpcCYC2Bb (Figure 4), which are unique to Dipsacaceae.
The additional duplications within these clades are found
only in species with radiate capitula.
DpcCYC1 is well supported, with the sequence from B.
bretschneideri resolved as sister to two clades of DpcCYC1
in the separate analysis (DpcCYC1A and DpcCYC1B;
Figure 3). That is, the duplication within DpcCYC1
appears to have occurred after the core Dipsacaceae split
from Bassecoia. DpcCYC1A is recovered only from members of the Dipknautid clade, including both discoid (i.e.

phylogeny is generally consistent with the species phylogeny [23]. With the separate analysis of DpcCYC2B, we
were able to further clarify relationships within this gene

lineage (Figure 4). The two major copies that were previously reported [15] - DpcCYC2Ba and DpcCYC2Bb are hereafter referred to as “2Ba“ and “2Bb“ for

Carlson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:325

simplicity. In the combined analysis of all CYC-like
genes, the DpcCYC2Ba sequence from B. bretschneideri
is sister to sequences from all remaining species in this
clade, similar to the placement of the sequences from
B. bretschneideri in DpcCYC1. In the separate analysis
of DpcCYC2Ba, however, the position of the sequence
from B. bretschneideri is unresolved but joins sequences
from the other discoid species Pseudoscabiosa limonifolia, Dipsacus pilosus, and Dipsacus inermis outside a
large clade composed only of sequences from radiate
species from both the Scabioseae and Dipknautid
groups. We inferred five putative copies within this core
clade of 2Ba (2Ba1 - 2Ba5; Figure 4). Similarly, within
the 2Bb lineage, we found only one copy in the discoid
species (i.e. B. bretschneideri, P. limonifolia, D. pilosus).
Sequences from these species, along with the Dipknautid
radiate species Knautia calycina and Cephalaria hirsuta,
are resolved outside of a clade composed of sequences
from radiate species from both the Dipknautids and
Scabioseae. Within this core clade of 2Bb, we inferred
two putative copies (2Bb1, 2Bb2), although support for
2Bb1 was low (i.e. ML bootstrap = 65, posterior probability = 0.57).
Lastly, we recovered the fewest sequences from the
DpcCYC3 clade. Within DpcCYC3, we found evidence
for one copy of DpcCYC3A for members of Scabioseae,
but did not recover this gene for Bassecoia or members
of the Dipknautid clade. DpcCYC3B was recovered for
four species that represent the three major lineages of
Dipsacaceae (Bassecoia; Pseudoscabiosa and Knautia
from the Dipknautid clade; Sixalix from Scabioseae) and
there were two copies of this gene for K. calycina.
Sequence characteristics

The three major clades of DpcCYC, as well as the putative copies within these clades, differ in sequence characteristics, most notably the length between the TCP and R
domain (Figure 5). DpcCYC1 is the longest copy, with
fewer gaps in the intervening region (suggesting these
sequences may be less diverged from each other than the
other copies), followed by DpcCYC2A. Duplications
within both DpcCYC2 and DpcCYC3 appear to have been
accompanied by a reduction in sequence length between
the A and B copies, and the B copies of DpcCYC2 and
DpcCYC3 have the shortest sequence lengths. The “ECE”
region, the characteristic conserved domain found in the
intervening region, is easily identifiable in DpcCYC1,
DpcCYC2A, and DpcCYC3A, but apparently absent in all
copies of both DpcCYC2B and DpcCYC3B (the ECE
region is also missing from these genes in other members
of the Dipsacales examined [15]). In addition to differences in the intervening region, there are also amino acid
differences in the TCP domain between the different
copies. DpcCYC1 is the most divergent from the other

Page 7 of 13

copies. There are also notable differences in sequence
characteristics between the putative copies within each of
the subclades, including the length of the intervening
region as well as amino acid polymorphisms.

Discussion
Our study verifies that gene duplication events yielded five
major copies of CYC-like genes prior to the origin of Dipsacaceae (DpcCYC1, DpcCYC2A, DpcCYC2B, DpcCYC3A,
and DpcCYC3B) [15]. The major duplication found in
DpcCYC1 (DpcCYC1A, DpcCYC1B) and the additional
putative copies within DpcCYC1B are found in Dipsacaceae but not in other Dipsacales. Similarly, the major
duplication in DpcCYC2B (2Ba, 2Bb) is consistent with
previous studies [15], but the additional duplications
within these copies are unique to Dipsacaceae. These
duplications do not appear to be the result of recent polyploidization events, as they do not occur across all copies.
Additionally, chromosome counts indicate that there is no
evidence for genome doubling in the species used in this
study [27-29] (although, ancient whole genome duplication in the ancestor of Dipsacaceae has not been investigated). We feel that the newly discovered subclades within
DpcCYC1 and DpcCYC2B likely represent different copies,
as opposed to alleles, because they contain species from
throughout the Dipsacaceae phylogeny. In other words,
we would not expect allele sequences to be conserved
across distant relatives.
Gene trees in relation to the species tree

Congruence between gene trees and the species tree
within Dipsacaceae is difficult to interpret. Outgroups in
the Linnina clade are generally resolved as sister to Dipsacaceae, although phylogenetic relationships between these
species tend to be poorly supported. The two Helianthus
CYC1-like copies are resolved outside of the CYC1-like
clade, indicating that better phylogenetic sampling is
needed to clarify relationships among copies in this part of
the tree. Within DpcCYC1, the failure to amplify
DpcCYC1A from members of Scabioseae (or the loss of
this copy from these genomes), combined with the additional copies in DpcCYC1B, renders species relationships
within this clade unclear. The DpcCYC2A tree (with no
duplications) is more or less consistent with phylogenetic
studies [23,30,31], although the position of B. bretschneideri is weakly resolved (i.e. < .90 posterior probability, <
70% ML bootstrap support) with members of the Dipknautids rather than as sister to all other Dipsacaceae, as
in the species phylogeny. Within DpcCYC2B, the presence
of multiple copies precludes the inference of species relationships. Lastly, congruence between the gene trees and
the species tree in both copies of DpcCYC3 cannot be
determined due to limited taxon sampling and poor phylogenetic signal in the gene trees (likely the result of short

Figure 5 Protein alignment. Protein alignment of representative species of the TCP domain, intervening region, and R domain for the major
DpcCYC copies aligned independently of one another. The TCP domain is boxed and shaded, the “ECE” region is shown in a dashed box, and
the start of the R domain is indicated with a dot. Bases that are in bold represent polymorphisms between putative copies within DpcCYC1B,
DpcCYC2Ba, and DpcCYC2Bb, and underlined bases represent fixed differences in the TCP domain within the five major copies.

sequence length). Based on these results, the utility of
most DpcCYC genes for use in phylogenetic studies would
be problematical due to the presence of multiple putative
copies, low amplification success for some genes (e.g. the
DpcCYC3’s), short sequences with a highly conserved TCP
domain that yield low phylogenetic signal, and difficulties
in aligning the intervening region. A possible exception is
DpcCYC2A, which shows some promise in elucidating
species relationships. This gene may be enhanced as a
phylogenetic marker by using the full-length sequence
rather than the shorter region between the TCP and R
domain used in this study.
Strikingly, we found no additional duplications in any
of the major subclades for Bassecoia bretschneideri. In
the separate analysis of DpcCYC1, the main duplication
event occurred after Bassecoia split from the core Dipsacaceae. Similarly, we found no evidence for additional

duplications in DpcCYC1 in Dipsacus inermis, Dipsacus
pilosus, or Pseudoscabiosa limonifolia, the other discoid
species included in this study. In the 2Ba and 2Bb clades,
both Dipsacus species and P. limonifolia occupy a position along with B. bretschneideri (plus Knautia calycina
and Cephalaria hirsuta in 2Bb) outside of the core clades
of these lineages that include all radiate species. Given
these results and our current understanding of Dipsacaceae phylogeny (Figure 1 [23]), it is perhaps most likely
that the 2Ba and 2Bb genes duplicated in the lineage
leading to the core Dipsacaceae and were subsequently
lost twice: once in the lineage leading to Pseudoscabiosa
and once in Dipsacus. However, we cannot rule out that
by using a degenerate primer approach we failed to
amplify these copies in Bassecoia, Pseudoscabiosa, and
Dipsacus. In any case, the occurrence of the same general
pattern of duplication in three different CYC-like genes

(DpcCYC1, DpcCYC2Ba, and DpcCYC2Bb) is potentially
of great interest.
Diversification of CYC-like genes and character evolution

The pattern of CYC-like gene diversification appears to
generally correlate with inflorescence form in Dipsacaceae. Groups with radiate capitula are represented in the
major clades and subclades of DpcCYC, while the discoid
groups Bassecoia, Pseudoscabiosa, and Dipsacus appear
to have only one copy of DpcCYC1 (or no copy in the
case of Pseudoscabiosa), 2Ba, and 2Bb. While CYC-like
genes have been investigated in functional studies of
other Asteraceae species (e.g. Gerbera with one copy of
CY1-like and three copies of CYC2-like genes, and Senecio with two copies in the CYC2-like clade [19,20]), gene
duplication has been investigated most extensively in
Helianthus. The highest reported number of CYC-like
genes is 10 for Helianthus annuus [21], a radiate species
of Asteraceae, and the pattern of diversification in radiate
Dipsacaceae groups is remarkably similar. While we did
not recover all copies for each species, we hypothesize
that there are at least 15 and possibly 17 copies of CYClike genes in radiate members of Dipsacaceae (Figure 6),
depending on better resolution within 2Bb and whether
the duplication in DpcCYC3B found in Knautia can be
generalized to other radiate species. For discoid groups,
our study infers 5 copies.
The duplications in Helianthus and radiate Dipsacaceae
occur within the same gene lineages. Helianthus has two
copies of CYC1-like genes and we recovered five putative
copies for radiate species of Dipsacaceae. Most notably,
there are five copies of Helianthus in the CYC2-like
clade, and seven or eight (depending on resolution in
2Bb) copies in radiate species of Dipsacaceae. Lastly,
Helianthus has three copies in the CYC3-like clade, while
members of Dipsacaceae appear to have at least two (possibly three in Knautia), although copy number was difficult to assess for this gene clade due to problems with
amplification. If we assume that most CYC-like genes
that are present have been discovered, then it is possible
that the independent evolution of radiate capitula in
Asteraceae and Dipsacaceae may have been associated
with independent duplication events in orthologous
CYC-like genes. However, in the absence of expression
data for CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae and broader studies of gene duplication events within Asteraceae, this is
clearly speculative. To date, the evolutionary history of
CYC-like genes has not been investigated in discoid
Asteraceae (or Asteraceae with inflorescences composed
of ligulate florets), so it is unknown whether these species
also diverged in copy number from their radiate relatives.
The additional duplications in CYC1-like and CYC2Blike genes are of particular interest because, within the

core eudicots, they may be specific to Helianthus and
Dipsacaceae, at least within the species that have been
surveyed thus far (outside of the core eudicots, two
copies of CYC1-like genes are found in Papaveraceae,
[32]). In most previous studies, only a single copy of
CYC1-like genes has been found [33,10]. Our finding
that only members of the Dipknautid clade have
DpcCYC1A is potentially interesting given the differences in floral traits between the main clades of Dipsacaceae. Members of Scabioseae have five petals while
the Dipknautids (and Bassecoia) have four, and the epicalyx in Scabioseae is characterized by several structural
modifications that are not present in Bassecoia or in the
Dipknautids [34]. However, functional information for
CYC1-like genes is limited, although putative orthologs
in Arabidopsis are thought to be involved in branching
architecture [35]. TB1 is similar in sequence to genes in
the CYC1-like clade, and is also responsible for differences in branching architecture between cultivated
maize and its wild progenitor, teosinte [36]. While there
are no functional data for Helianthus, the two copies of
CYC1-like genes (HaCYC1a and HaCYC1b) were found
to diverge in expression patterns, with HaCYC1a
expressed across all tissues except roots, and HaCYC1b
expressed only in the petals [21]. Due to potential differences in CYC1-like genes between Scabioseae and the
Dipknautid clade and the presence of multiple copies of
DpcCYC1B in radiate species, CYC1-like genes are
attractive candidates for future study.
Previous studies have generally found more duplications in the CYC2-like genes than in the CYC1-like or
CYC3-like genes; however, no more than three copies
have been reported outside of Helianthus and Dipsacaceae [10]. The CYC2-like clade includes CYC from Antirrhinum, and its orthologs have been studied in several
plant groups, including in members of Asteraceae, where
it has been suggested that CYC-like genes might be
responsible for differentiating the radially symmetrical
disk florets from the bilaterally symmetrical ray florets
[37]. In both Gerbera and Senecio, CYC2-like genes are
expressed in ray florets and functional data suggest they
are involved in differentiating the radially symmetrical
disk florets from the bilaterally symmetrical ray florets
[19,20]. While no functional data exist for the Helianthus
orthologs of CYC2-like genes, their expression patterns
were found to diverge, which may be indicative of sub
and/or neofunctionalization [38] of the duplicated CYC2like copies. While our correlational study cannot establish causation, the higher number of DpcCYC2B genes in
radiate versus discoid Dipsacaceae suggests that they
might also play a role in the development of ray florets.
Expression studies and functional data are needed to
address this possibility.

Conclusions
The results presented here represent the first step in
assessing the role of CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae
development. We recovered the five major clades that
were reported in previous studies and discovered several
additional copies, most notably in the DpcCYC1 and
DpcCYC2B clades. The DpcCYC2B clade in particular
demonstrates a dynamic history of gene duplication.
Interestingly, the pattern of CYC-like diversification in
Dipsacaceae is very similar to that of Helianthus
annuus, a species of Asteraceae that has been screened
for CYC-like genes. Our study also suggests that the
number of DpcCYC copies tends to correlate with the
distribution of radiate versus discoid inflorescence form,
with species bearing radiate heads having more than
twice the number of CYC-like genes as discoid species.
Investigations of CYC-like genes in discoid members of
Asteraceae are needed to assess the generality of this
pattern.
Capitulum inflorescences have evolved independently in
a number of angiosperm lineages, but perhaps most often
within the Campanulidae, a clade of over 30,000 species
that includes both the Asteraceae and the Dipsacaceae.
Many campanulids produce flat-toped inflorescences containing many small flowers, and this arrangement appears
to have set the stage both for the differentiation of
enlarged (often sterile and bilaterally symmetrical) flowers
around the periphery of the inflorescence (e.g., Viburnum
in the Adoxaceae) and for the condensation of the inflorescence into a capitulum (e.g., in Asteraceae and its sister
group Calyceraceae; Dipsacaceae; Eryngium and others
within Apiaceae). Such inflorescences could have originated in each of these lineages via different pathways,
deploying different sets of genes. Instead, our analyses
indicate that two widely separated groups within the campanulid angiosperms - Asteraceae and Dipsacaceae - may
have taken advantage of gene duplications within the same
family of genes.
Methods
Plant material

Fourteen individuals were studied, representing all major
subclades of Dipsacaceae, from either herbarium specimens or silica-preserved field collections. Total genomic
DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNEasy methods (Qiagen, Valencia, California), or a modified version using
beta-Mercaptoethanol and proteinase-K for herbarium
specimens [39]. We also included 44 published sequences
of outgroups from the Linnina clade [22] and all ten
CYC-like genes published for Helianthus annuus. We
used a single copy from Aquilegia (Ranunculaceae) as the
outgroup [10]. All taxa used in this study are listed in
additional file 1.

Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing

Degenerate primers designed by Howarth and Donoghue
[10] were first used to amplify the TCP domain (forward
primer) and the R domain (reverse primer). Amplification with these primers used the following cycling program: 95°C for 45 s, 50°-56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1
min 30 s, repeated for 39 cycles. Reactions were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA) in 25 μL, with final concentrations of 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.8 mM dNTPs, and 0.5×
Q Solution (QIAGEN). Amplified products were cloned
using the Invitrogen TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Between 25 and 100
(depending on cloning success) colonies were screened
for all potentially different copies of CYC-like genes.
Colonies were picked and mixed directly into a PCR
cocktail (in the same concentrations as above with standard M13 primers). Following a 10 minute denaturing
step at 95°C, the following program was used: 95°C for
30 s, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 60 s, repeated for 24
cycles. Cloned PCR products between 200-800 bp were
cleaned as above. Sequences were generated using dye
terminator cycle sequencing using ABI PRISM “Big Dye”
Primer Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kits (PerkinElmer, Foster City, California), and visualized using an
ABI3730 (Applied Biosystems DNA Analyzer). Through
the course of the study, we designed additional primers
specific to Dipsacaceae (Table 1).
Phylogenetic alignment and analysis

All clones were assembled in Sequencher (Gene Codes
Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan) and identified as CYC-like
genes based on the conserved amino acid sequence of the
TCP domain. Clones were assembled into different
sequence “groups” according to shared differences. Members of the same sequence group were generally identical
and only varied by obvious polymerase error (single base
differences in one or two clones out of several, with different clones being mutated at different sites). A consensus sequence was generated for each group and exported
for phylogenetic analysis. We analyzed two different datasets: one with all CYC-like sequences included, and two
additional dataset with only members of DpcCYC1 or
DpcCYC2B. We analyzed these clades separately in order
to align more of the intervening region to aid phylogenetic resolution.
Aligned datasets were generated using Muscle [40] and
adjusted manually in MacClade v. 4.06 [41]. Models of
molecular evolution were calculated using AIC (Akaike
Information Criteria) scores in ModelTest version 3.7
[42] (model = GTR + G) and implemented in the Bayesian analyses. Bayesian inference analyses were performed using MrBayes version 3.1.2 [43] and two

simultaneous runs were initiated from random starting
trees. Posterior probabilities of trees were approximated
using the Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MC3) algorithm with four incrementally heated chains
(T = 0.2) for 20 million generations and sampling trees
every 2,000 generations. Convergence and sampling
intensity were evaluated using PRSF (all parameters
approached 1.0) and ESS (values were greater than 200).
The average standard deviation of split frequencies
approached 0.01 in all analyses, indicating that each MC3
chain converged to the target distribution. To estimate
burn-ins, posterior parameter distributions were viewed
using Tracer version 1.4.
ML analyses were conducted using RAxML version 7.0.4
[44]. Tree searches were executed from a random stepwise-addition maximum parsimony tree and employed the
GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model. ML analyses
were run ten times per dataset, starting from ten different
starting trees. All free model parameters were estimated
with RAxML, with GAMMA model parameters estimated
up to an accuracy of 0.1 log likelihood units. Nonparametric bootstrapping under ML was also carried out with
RAxML using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
