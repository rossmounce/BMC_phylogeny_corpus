Abstract
Introduction: Many genome projects were underway before the advent of high-throughput sequencing and have
thus been supported by a wealth of genome information from other technologies. Such information frequently
takes the form of linkage and physical maps, both of which can provide a substantial amount of data useful in de
novo sequencing projects. Furthermore, the recent abundance of genome resources enables the use of conserved
synteny maps identified in related species to further enhance genome assemblies.
Methods: The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) is a model marsupial mammal with a low coverage genome.
However, we have access to extensive comparative maps containing over 14,000 markers constructed through the
physical mapping of conserved loci, chromosome painting and comprehensive linkage maps. Using a custom
Bioperl pipeline, information from the maps was aligned to assembled tammar wallaby contigs using BLAT. This
data was used to construct pseudo paired-end libraries with intervals ranging from 5-10 MB. We then used
Bambus (a program designed to scaffold eukaryotic genomes by ordering and orienting contigs through the use
of paired-end data) to scaffold our libraries. To determine how map data compares to sequence based approaches
to enhance assemblies, we repeated the experiment using a 0.5× coverage of unique reads from 4 KB and 8 KB
Illumina paired-end libraries. Finally, we combined both the sequence and non-sequence-based data to determine
how a combined approach could further enhance the quality of the low coverage de novo reconstruction of the
tammar wallaby genome.
Results: Using the map data alone, we were able order 2.2% of the initial contigs into scaffolds, and increase the
N50 scaffold size to 39 KB (36 KB in the original assembly). Using only the 0.5× paired-end sequence based data,
53% of the initial contigs were assigned to scaffolds. Combining both data sets resulted in a further 2% increase in
the number of initial contigs integrated into a scaffold (55% total) but a 35% increase in N50 scaffold size over the
use of sequence-based data alone.
Conclusions: We provide a relatively simple pipeline utilizing existing bioinformatics tools to integrate map data
into a genome assembly which is available at http://www.mcb.uconn.edu/fac.php?name=paska. While the map
data only contributed minimally to assigning the initial contigs to scaffolds in the new assembly, it greatly
increased the N50 size. This process added structure to our low coverage assembly, greatly increasing its utility in
further analyses.

Background
The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) belongs to the
marsupial lineage within the Class Mammalia (Figure 1).
Marsupials differ from eutherian mammals in that they
give birth to relatively altricial young that complete
much of their development external to the mother,
attached to a nipple often enclosed in a pouch [1].
These developmental novelties make marsupials ideal
models for examining and manipulating early stages of
mammalian development and reproduction [2-4] otherwise not possible in model eutherian mammal species
(such as mouse and rat) where development occurs largely in utero. In addition to their developmental differences, marsupial mammals are unique in that they have
been evolving independently of eutherian mammals for
over 148 million years [5] (Figure 2). From a genomics
perspective, this makes them ideal for comparisons with
eutherian mammals to isolate important functional
regions of the genome; 148 million years of divergent
evolution is sufficient for non-functional DNA to no
longer retain homology, while functional DNA can be
easily identified between the lineages [6-8]. For example,
cross comparisons between marsupial and eutherian
genomes have enabled the identification of important
coding as well as non-coding (including elusive promoter) elements [8-10].
The arrangement of the tammar wallaby genome is
unique, with the entire 2.7 Gb genome organized into

Page 2 of 7

seven pairs of autosomes and an X and Y [11,12]. However, the X is relatively small in the tammar and the Y
is tiny. It has been proposed that the tammar X represents the ancestral therian X chromosome, which has
undergone several additions in the eutherian lineage.
Likewise the Y in marsupials is thought to represent a
minimal mammalian Y [13,14]. The centromeres of the
tammar chromosomes are also quite different from that
of their eutherian relatives. Similar to centromeres in
rice [15], the centromeres of the tammar are small,
encompassing ~420kb, and are comprised of a heterogeneous repeat structure of interspersed satellites and centromeric retroelements [16]. In addition, the alternative
reproductive strategy of the tammar has placed different
evolutionary pressures on the genome. Most notably,
genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in
eutherian mammals thought, in part, to regulate fetal
growth and nutrition in utero affects fewer genes and is
less complex in marsupials [17,18]. All of these features
combined, make the tammar wallaby genome a particular interesting resource from an evolutionary as well as
a developmental point of view.
A white paper to sequence the genome of the tammar
wallaby was funded in 2004, in a joint venture between
the National Human Genome Research Institute
(National Institutes of Health) and the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd. (http://www.genome.gov/

pdf) to produce a 2× coverage genome. By the time the
project was initiated, large amounts of non-sequence
based data had already been collected to supplement
Sanger sequence reads. Work continued with the nonsequence based data as a way to enhance the genome
assembly. Subsequently, a comprehensive map of the
wallaby genome was developed that integrated physical,
linkage and synteny maps with 14,429 markers spanning
the tammar genome [19]. This abundance of markers
was greatly enhanced by synteny maps constructed
between the tammar wallaby and the genome of the
opossum (another marsupial species). While a large
number of model species with low coverage genomes
already have genomic maps, including Canis familiaris,
Felis catus and Ovis aries, none have such an extensive
map as the wallaby, with the next largest map found in
the dog project, including 4,249 markers [20]. A welldeveloped map plays an important role in creating an
accurate representation of the genome by providing a
structure to which many smaller contigs can be attached

and ordered to produce a whole chromosome. Thus, an
extensive genomic map can help overcome many of the
limitations of a low coverage genome and provide a
platform for researchers to investigate repetitive regions,
gain insight into chromosomal evolution and help to
develop regulatory pathways that may depend on proximity for activity not possible without an enhanced
assembly.

Methods
Integrating the nonsequence-based data

The tammar virtual genome maps were previously constructed for each tammar wallaby chromosome, combining physical, linkage and synteny data [19]. Maps
consisted of markers identified by their opossum
Ensembl IDs, their gene names and physical location on
the tammar wallaby chromosomes. The Ensembl IDs
were then used to retrieve the opossum gene sequence
(exons and introns) from Ensembl using the published
interface provided from its website. Sequences were

Heider et al. BMC Proceedings 2011, 5(Suppl 2):S7

then aligned against the assembled contigs from the
tammar wallaby 1.2 assembly using BLAT [21] to identify the location of each marker with the highest scoring
match being used in the final scaffold. As an initial scaffolding of the contigs in the genome had been previously accomplished using SOLiD mate pair reads, the
scaffolds generated from that analysis were treated as
the initial contigs used in the following analyses. The
output from BLAT was used to create a contig file for
Bambus, using the file specifications outlined at http://
sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=Bambus_Manual. To generate the mate-pair file for
Bambus [22,23], all possible marker combinations were
identified for a set distance using the physical map locations on tammar wallaby chromosomes. This process
started with a 5MB interval and was repeated in 1 MB
increments to a 10 MB distance between the two markers, generating a total of 6 pseudo mate-paired
libraries. The statistics of how this improved the assembly (Table 1) were all obtained from the Bambus .stats
output file.
Integrating the sequence-based data

In addition to the physical map, there was also a wealth
of information from next generation sequencing platforms that we wanted to integrate into the tammar genome assembly. The Illumina paired-end reads were
mapped against the tammar wallaby genome using the
short read mapping program Bowtie [24]. Bowtie was
run using default parameters with the modification that
each read was allowed up to 3 mismatches. Furthermore, paired-end reads where one or both reads
mapped to multiple locations were excluded from the
analysis. The output from read mapping was stored in
standard SAM format (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/

manual.shtml#sam-bowtie-output) which indicates the
contig, position and orientation for each mapped read
and its mate. A perl pipeline was then constructed to
convert this file into the required BAMBUS input files
(http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?
title=Bambus_Manual). BAMBUS was then run using
only the sequenced-based data and the output statistics
collected (Table 1).
Combining both the nonsequence and sequence based
data

Using the methods described above, the files from the
sequence and non-sequence based data were combined
and used together to further enhance the assembly.
Given that the sequence based data is likely to be more
precise than the non-sequence based information, a
higher priority was assigned to it. Bambus will then use
the sequence data to override the map data when there
is a conflict between the two datasets. The statistics
were again retrieved from the Bambus output statistics
file and compared to that from just the map based or
sequence based data alone. A diagram of this pipeline is
shown in figure 3.

Results
Integrating the nonsequence-based data

From the 14,429 markers, 173,294 pseudo paired-end
reads were generated across 6 libraries ranging from
5MB to 10MB intervals. The pseudo paired-end libraries
increased the N50 from 36 KB in the original assembly,
to 39 KB and included 2.2 % initial contigs in scaffolds.
Based on the map-enhanced assembly alone, Bambus
estimates the total scaffold span at 3.2GB, slightly larger
than its predicted 2.7 GB size (A. Pask, personal
communication).

Ideal Genome

This table shows the relative contributions that each library makes to reducing the number of scaffolds and increasing the N50. All data are derived from the
Bambus output statistics file. The left column indicates the data set used to enhance the assembly with Bambus. Number of pared end reads indicates the total
number of paired data points used for each data set to enhance the assembly. The total scaffold span provides an indirect assessment of the genome size based
on the assembly and was used by Bambus to calculate the N50. The N50 indicates the size of the smallest contig in the smallest set of contigs that add up to
50% of the size of their respective total scaffold span. The number of scaffolds indicates the number of independently ordered regions in our assembly. The
reduction in this number with the integration of each library indicates the integration and ordering of the original contigs into larger scaffolds. The total number
of scaffolds generated from the assembly is listed and the percentage reduction is from the initial number of contigs present in the input library. The bottom
row lists the ideal genome size (2.7 GB) and number of contigs (one for each chromosome = 8).

through the pipeline.

Integrating the sequence-based data

Using the 0.5× paired-end Illumina sequence data the
genome was greatly improved, Bambus was able to
order and orient 53% of the initial contigs into scaffolds
and increase the N50 to 78KB. Interestingly, despite
fewer reads, the 4 KB Illumina paired-end data was
more successful in increasing the number of contigs in
scaffolds compared to the 8 KB data (40% compared to
27%); however the 8KB data integration produced a larger N50 size (52 KB compared to 49 KB for the 4kb
library alone) (Table 1).
Combining both the non and sequence based data

Using both sequence and non-sequence based data, we
were able to increase the number of initial contigs in
scaffolds to 153,612, scaffolding 55% of the contigs from
the original assembly. The inclusion of the mapping
data to the Illumina paired-end libraries further
increased the number of initial contigs being scaffolded
by 5191. Thus, very few of the original 6024 initial contigs that the mapping data was able to include in a scaffold, were included using the Illumina paired-end
libraries. Furthermore, the N50 for the assembly was

greatly increased (by 35%) by the inclusion of the mapping data with the Illumina data (105 KB compared to
78 KB with Illumina data alone).
Since the N50 statistics for each of the analyses above
were determined by using the total scaffold span for
each analysis, they are not directly comparable. However, the total scaffold span for each analysis (with the
exception of the use of the virtual map alone) is within
the margin of error for our direct estimate of the genome size (2.7 GB +/- 10%; A. Pask personal communication). Furthermore, the comparatively small reduction in
the estimated genome size concurrent with the inclusion
of more paired end data, cannot alone account for the
large increase in the N50 seen using this method.

Discussion
Genome assemblies enhanced with non-sequence-based
information (especially for low coverage genomes), provide a more workable resource for analysis and comparative genomics. Our bioinformatics pipeline provides
a flexible, straightforward method of integrating nonsequence based data seamlessly into a modern genome
project. The combination of, and ability to prioritize,

Heider et al. BMC Proceedings 2011, 5(Suppl 2):S7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/5/S2/S7

sequence and non-sequence based data into an assembly
gives this method robustness not found by simply mapping the assembled contigs to a virtual genome map.
This prioritization allows the paired-end data to override
the physical map when encountering small segmental
inversions unique to a species or to even an individual.
A small proportion (553 markers) of the virtual genome map was defined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping which can identify the location
of a gene on a specific chromosome within a few
megabases. To address this precision limitation of
FISH mapping, we constructed pseudo paired-end
libraries starting with 5MB intervals to avoid any possibility of misinterpreting the order of the markers.
Our findings showed that while the non-sequence data
only marginally helped to increase the number of
initial contigs scaffolded together, it is able to greatly
improve the N50 size. The small increase in initial
contigs scaffolded is not surprising given that the total
number of paired-end reads generated from the map
points was 173,294 compared to 20,133,999 paired-end
reads from the Illumina data. In total, the virtual map
contributed less than 1% of the data points used in the
combined assembly but added 4% of the contigs to a
scaffold. Therefore the mapping data, even if utilizing
a limited number of datapoints, can provide a useful
means for increasing the N50. This is likely due to the
interval between paired reads (5-10 MB), which far
exceeds the current capabilities of next generation
sequencing and can provide a higher order structure to
the genome assembly. In addition, the mapping data
allows direct assignment of the initial contigs to the
chromosomes, providing valuable information beyond
that of sequence data alone and further enhancing the
accuracy of the final assembly.

Conclusions
The method we describe herein provides a simple pipeline for the inclusion of non-sequence based data into a
genome. Integrating data from more than one source
(sequence based and map based) advances the robustness and confidence of any genome assembly. Map data
is able to anchor contigs to chromosomes further
improving the genome assembly. While the integration
of over 14,000 map points was only able to enhance the
genome assembly by 2.2% in the tammar wallaby, its
inclusion with Illumina paired-end data was able greatly
increase the N50 of the genome (35% above that generated from the Illumina reads alone). Given the high cost
and time commitment of constructing a physical map,
we would not recommended the use of extensive FISH
and linkage mapping to improve a genome assembly
over generating a low coverage of paired-end data. However, as the number and diversity of genomes continue

Page 6 of 7

to increase in public databases, closely related genomes
can be used at virtually no cost to generate extensive
synteny maps. Such maps can be used in the method
described here for increasing the size of scaffolds, allowing assemblies to span large stretches of repetitive DNA
that paired-end libraries from the current next generation sequencing platforms are not able to cross. We suggest that, together with paired-end data, this novel
method can greatly enhance the assembly of a low coverage genome project improving its utility for further
analyses.
