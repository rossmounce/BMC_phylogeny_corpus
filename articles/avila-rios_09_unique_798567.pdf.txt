Abstract
Background: Mounting evidence indicates that HLA-mediated HIV evolution follows highly
stereotypic pathways that result in HLA-associated footprints in HIV at the population level.
However, it is not known whether characteristic HLA frequency distributions in different
populations have resulted in additional unique footprints.
Methods: The phylogenetic dependency network model was applied to assess HLA-mediated
evolution in datasets of HIV pol sequences from free plasma viruses and peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC)-integrated proviruses in an immunogenetically unique cohort of Mexican
individuals. Our data were compared with data from the IHAC cohort, a large multi-center cohort
of individuals from Canada, Australia and the USA.
Results: Forty three different HLA-HIV codon associations representing 30 HLA-HIV codon pairs
were observed in the Mexican cohort (q < 0.2). Strikingly, 23 (53%) of these associations differed
from those observed in the well-powered IHAC cohort, strongly suggesting the existence of unique
characteristics in HLA-mediated HIV evolution in the Mexican cohort. Furthermore, 17 of the 23
novel associations involved HLA alleles whose frequencies were not significantly different from
those in IHAC, suggesting that their detection was not due to increased statistical power but to
differences in patterns of epitope targeting. Interestingly, the consensus differed in four positions
between the two cohorts and three of these positions could be explained by HLA-associated

selection. Additionally, different HLA-HIV codon associations were seen when comparing HLAmediated selection in plasma viruses and PBMC archived proviruses at the population level, with a
significantly lower number of associations in the proviral dataset.
Conclusion: Our data support universal HLA-mediated HIV evolution at the population level,
resulting in detectable HLA-associated footprints in the circulating virus. However, it also strongly
suggests that unique genetic backgrounds in different HIV-infected populations may influence HIV
evolution in a particular direction as particular HLA-HIV codon associations are determined by
specific HLA frequency distributions. Our analysis also suggests a dynamic HLA-associated
evolution in HIV with fewer HLA-HIV codon associations observed in the proviral compartment,
which is likely enriched in early archived HIV sequences, compared to the plasma virus
compartment. These results highlight the importance of comparative HIV evolutionary studies in
immunologically different populations worldwide.

Background
The cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) response has
been identified as an important selective pressure driving
HIV evolution within an infected host [1-5]. Strong lines
of evidence support the importance of the CTL response
in HIV control, including the temporal correlation
between the appearance of HIV-specific CTLs in vivo and
the decline of viremia in the early stages of HIV infection
[6], as well as the lack of control of virus levels after experimental depletion of CD8+ cells in rhesus macaques prior
to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection [7].
CTLs recognize and destroy infected cells through the
binding of their T cell receptor (TCR) to viral peptides
(epitopes) presented on the surface of infected cells by
highly polymorphic molecules encoded by class I human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Each HLA allele encodes a
unique HLA molecule capable of presenting a broad range
of possible epitopes derived from various areas of the HIV
proteome. CTL recognition of these peptide-HLA complexes may be associated with different functional outcomes in the infection [8-10]. Importantly, as a result of
CTL-mediated selective pressure, immune escape mutations are selected that hinder viral peptide binding to HLA
molecules, prevent peptide processing before their presentation or lower TCR affinity of specific CTL clones to peptide-HLA complexes [4,11-13]. Therefore, both the
processes of antigen presentation to CTLs and CTL escape
are HLA-restricted [14].
Depending on their costs to viral fitness, some CTL escape
mutations can be transmitted and maintained in a new
host [15-18], even without the presence of the originally
selective HLA allele [11,19-21]. Additionally, there is evidence supporting the notion that some immune escape
mutations can accumulate in a large number of individuals and become fixed in the circulating virus consensus
sequence, driving HIV evolutionary changes at the population level [9,19,22-24]. As a result, specific HLA epitopes
could become extinct in the viral population, allowing
HIV adaptation to HLA-associated immune control in a

certain region [22,23]. The relative impact of different factors that could influence the persistence of escape mutations in a large number of individuals remains
incompletely understood [22,25]. The variety of these factors–such as the extent of reversion of immune escape
mutations in the absence of the selecting HLA allele
[15,16,18], selection of compensatory mutations that
restore viral fitness [26], founder effects [9], conflicting
evolutionary forces on clustered epitopes [27], development of novel CTL responses to escape variants [28,29],
inter-clade differences in the circulating viruses [14,30],
immunodominance hierarchies of CTL responses
[25,31,32], and HLA allele frequency distributions in different populations [22]–highlight the complexity of viral
adaptation to the immune response at the population
level [9,25].
In spite of this complexity, mounting evidence indicating
that a large number of CTL escape mutations are reproducibly selected in the context of specific HLA restrictions
has led to the hallmark observation that HIV evolution
follows generally predictable mutational patterns in
response to specific HLA-restricted immune responses
(reviewed in [10]). This "HLA footprint effect" on HIV has
been shown at the population level through correlative
associations between the presence (or absence) of polymorphisms at specific positions of the viral sequence and
the expression of specific HLA alleles [24,25,33-35].
Detection of HLA-HIV polymorphism associations is
potentially limited by important confounding effects,
namely HIV phylogeny, HIV codon covariation, and linkage disequilibrium of HLA alleles [10,14]. Several studies
have accounted for some of these confounding effects
explicitly [24,30,34]; more recently, a comprehensive evolutionary model considering all these confounding
sources was proposed [14]. This phylogenetic dependency
network model was shown to be able to reconstruct previously defined escape and compensatory mutation pathways and agrees with emerging data on patterns of epitope
targeting. The existence of this kind of comprehensive

models represents an opportunity to systematically study
HIV evolution in immunogenetically different populations and assess the importance of different HLA backgrounds in HIV evolution at the population level. Due to
the extensive polymorphism of HLA genes, allelic and
haplotypic frequency distributions in distinct infected
populations vary widely [9]. Given the highly consistent
effect of HLA-restricted selection on HIV evolution and
the distinct HLA allele distributions in differing populations, it is likely that specific HLA-HIV polymorphism
associations will be preferentially observed in different
populations, determining unique characteristics of HIV
evolution in different human groups [9,36]. To explore
this possibility, HLA-mediated HIV evolution at the population level was studied in a cohort of clade B-infected
individuals from Central/Southern Mexico, and compared to previously reported studies in a large multicenter
cohort of predominantly clade B-infected individuals
from British Columbia, Canada; Western Australia; and
the USA (the International HIV Adaptation Collaborative
[IHAC] cohort) (Brumme ZL, John M, et al, PLoS ONE
2009, in press) [14,25,34,37]. In order to determine to
what extent HLA imprinting on HIV is a general phenomenon, it is informative to study HIV evolution in an
immunogenetically unique population that possibly
reflects a different selective pressure to that observed in
other studied populations. The Mexican population is
known to have a unique immunogenetic background
characterized by the admixture of mainly Amerindian and
Caucasian HLA haplotypes [38,39]. To our knowledge,
Latin American cohorts have not been the primary subject
of HIV evolutionary studies. Our data suggest that the
unique HLA frequency distribution in a previously
uncharacterized, immunogenetically unique HIV-infected
population is imprinting HIV evolution in a unique way.
This fact underlines the importance of systematically
expanding our understanding of CTL escape and HIV evolution in immunogenetically distinct populations. This
knowledge has important implications for the design of
CTL-based vaccines and treatment strategies.

Methods
Study population
Peripheral blood samples were prospectively obtained
from 303 chronically-infected, HIV positive, antiretroviral
treatment-naïve individuals from Central/Southern Mexico. Participating individuals were recruited with written
informed consent at different health centers in Mexico
City and from the states of Puebla, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Guerrero, the State of Mexico and Chiapas. Blood samples were
shipped to and processed at the Center for Research in
Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of Respiratory
Diseases in Mexico City. All ethical issues related to this
project were evaluated and approved by the Institutional
Bioethics and Science Committee. For each patient,

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/72

plasma aliquots and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were obtained and cryopreserved.
HLA frequency and HLA-mediated HIV evolution data
obtained from the Mexican cohort were compared with
that obtained from a previously described cohort of 1,045
HIV-positive, predominantly Caucasian individuals from
British Columbia, Canada (HOMER cohort) [34] and the
large multicenter International HIV Adaptation Combined (IHAC) cohort, including 1,845 predominantly
Caucasian individuals from British Columbia, Canada;
Western Australia and the USA [37] (Brumme ZL, John M,
et al, PLoS ONE 2009, in press).
HLA typing
Genomic DNA was extracted from at least 6 million
PBMCs using QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Valencia CA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Class I HLA A, B and C genes were typed at low/
medium resolution for each participating individual by
sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction (SSPPCR) using ABC SSP UniTray Kit (Invitrogen, Brown Deer,
WI) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
Briefly, genomic DNA from each participating individual
at 75–125 ng/μL was used as template for 95 PCRs with
different sequence-specific primers designed to detect relevant polymorphisms for typing. Reaction products were
run on a 2.0% agarose gel (Promega, Madison, WI).
Amplification patterns were analyzed with UniMatch v3.2
software using up-to-date data bases to determine HLA
groups. All the reactions included an internal amplification control to be validated and each test included a reagent control to detect contamination.
HLA frequency analyses and comparisons
HLA allelic and population frequencies for the Mexican
cohort were obtained with the HLA Frequency Analysis
tool of the Los Alamos HIV Database http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/toolslinks.html. HLA haplotype frequencies were obtained
with the Arlequin v3.11 software. Due to the fact that the
cohort was composed of non-related individuals with
unknown family genetic backgrounds, a gametic phase
estimation was carried out for each individual using a
pseudo-Bayesian algorithm designed to reconstruct the
gametic phase of multi-loci genotypes, included in the
Arlequin v3.11 software (Excoffier-Laval-Balding, ELB)
[40]. Frequency analysis between the cohort reported here
and the Canadian HOMER cohort, the multicenter IHAC
cohort and a cohort of HIV-negative individuals from
Central/Northern Mexico [38], was carried out by chi
squared test, with post hoc two by two significance determined by Fisher's exact test, corrected for multiple comparisons by q values [41]. Significant values were
considered to be q < 0.05. These analyses were carried out

were assembled, aligned to the HXB2 consensus, and
edited manually using the ViroSeq v2.7 software.

HIV pol genotyping from free plasma virus
Viral RNA from free plasma virus was purified from 1 mL
of plasma using QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. A fragment of the viral pol gene including the whole
protease (PR) and 335 codons of the reverse transcriptase
(RT) was bulk sequenced from plasma viral RNA for each
participating individual. Sequences were obtained with a
3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA), using ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 1.3 Kbp fragments of the pol
gene were amplified by RT-PCR from plasma viral RNA.
PCR products were purified with ultra filtration columns
and quantified in 1.5% agarose gels (Promega, Madison,
WI). For each patient, sequencing PCRs were carried out
with 7 different primers to assure that the whole genomic
region was covered with at least two sequences. Sequences
were assembled, aligned to the HXB2 consensus, and
manually edited using the ViroSeq v2.7 software provided
by the manufacturer.

Evolutionary analyses
The phylogenetic dependency network (PDN) model by
Carlson, et al [14], was applied to infer patterns of CTL
escape and codon covariation in the plasma and proviral
sequence datasets, using the PhyloDv program http://
www.codeplex.com/MSCompBio. The PDN model was
designed to simultaneously account for HIV codon covariation, linkage disequilibrium among HLA alleles and the
confounding effects of HIV phylogeny when attempting
to identify HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV [14].
Briefly, the PDN model is a multivariate model that represents the probabilistic dependencies among a set of target
attributes (in this case the presence or absence of amino
acids at all codons in an HIV protein) and a set of predictor attributes (in this case the presence or absence of
amino acids at all codons other than that for the target
attribute in the HIV sequence, as well as the presence or
absence of all possible HLA alleles) while correcting for
the phylogenetic structure of the viral sequences. A
dependency network graphically depicts which HLA and
codon attributes predict each target codon attribute, associating a probability distribution for each target codon
attribute, conditioned on various HLA and codon
attributes. Importantly, each local probability distribution is corrected for the phylogenetic structure of the HIV
sequences. To determine the significance of a particular
predictor-target pair, the likelihood of a null model that
reflects the assertion that the target variable is not under
selection pressure from the predictor attribute is compared to an alternative model that reflects the assertion
that the target variable is under selection pressure from
that predictor attribute. Multiple predictors are added to
the model in an iterative fashion using forward selection,
in which the most significantly associated attribute is iteratively added to the model until no attribute achieves p <
0.05. The use of a multivariate model minimizes spurious
associations caused by the presence of linkage disequilibrium among HLA alleles and HIV codon covariation. For
each added predictor attribute, the most significant leaf
distribution is recorded (escape, reversion, attraction, or
repulsion, see below). The statistical significance of a predictor with respect to a target attribute is computed using
false discovery rates (FDRs), which are computed using a
likelihood-ratio test in which both the null and the alternative models are conditioned on all significant predictors that were identified in previous iterations of forward
selection. For each p-value, we report the corresponding
q-value, which is the minimum FDR among rejection
regions that include that p-value, as computed using the
method of Storey and Tibshirani with the π0 parameter
conservatively set to one [41]. Attributes were excluded as
possible predictors when the corresponding predictor-tar-

HIV pol genotyping from PBMC proviral DNA
Genomic DNA was purified as described above. A fragment of approximately 1.5 Kbp covering the whole PR
and the first 335 codons of RT was amplified by nested
PCR with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), and primers PR 5' OUTER 5'-CCCTAGGAAAAAGGGCTGTTG-3'/RT 3' OUTER 5'-GTTTTCAGATTTTTAAATGGCTCTTG-3', for the first round of
amplification, and PR 5' INNER 5'-TGAAAGATTGTACTGAGAGACAGG-3'/RT 3' INNER 5'-GGCTCTTGATAAATTTGATATGTCC-3' for the second round of
amplification. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 94°C, for 3
min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30
s and 72°C for 2 min and a cycle of 72°C for 5 min, with
final concentrations of 2 mM Mg++, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.4
mM of each primer and 20 ng/μL genomic DNA for both
amplification rounds (transferring 10% of the volume of
first round PCR product to the second round). In all cases,
contamination controls were included. PCR products
were purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications, and quantified in 2.0% agarose gels (Promega,
Madison, WI). Seven sequencing PCRs were carried out
for each patient using seven primer mixes included in the
ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System Kit (Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA), in order to cover the whole analyzed
region with at least two sequences. Bulk proviral pol
sequences were obtained with a 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences

get pair had a 2 × 2 contingency table in which any cell of
the table had an observed or expected value of three or
less.
The precise rules governing the transitions of the target
attribute, conditioned on the predictor attributes and the
sequence phylogeny, are given by a univariate leaf distribution, which is assumed to be the same for each individual. Four possible leaf distributions are defined: Attraction,
having the predictor makes it more likely to have the target; Repulsion, not having the predictor makes it less likely
to have the target; Escape, having the predictor makes it
less likely to have the target; and Reversion, not having the
predictor makes it more likely to have the target. The pair
Attraction/Repulsion corresponds to a positive correlation
between predictor and target, while the pair Escape/Reversion corresponds to a negative correlation between predictor and target.

Results
General clinical and geographical characteristics of the
Mexican cohort
Figure 1 shows the geographical residence of the individuals included in the study. As is typical in Latin American
cohorts [42,43], half of the individuals were found to be
in relatively advanced stages of HIV infection (CD4+ T cell
counts <200 cells/μL) at enrolment, with approximately
half of these patients having less than 50 CD4+ T cells/μL.
Only one of every 10 participating individuals was found
to be at relatively early stages of the infection (CD4+ T cell
count >500 cells/μL) (Table 1). Taking the cohort as a
whole, the median CD4+ T cell count was lower than 200
cells/μL. The male-to-female ratio of infected individuals
was 3 to 1 (Table 1), representing a slightly higher HIV
prevalence among women than previously reported for
the Mexican infected population [44], possibly suggesting
a tendency towards increased HIV infection in females in
the Latin American region [43]http://www.unaids.org. A

typical negative correlation was observed between CD4+
T cell counts and plasma viral loads (p < 0.0001), with a
mean increase in viral load of 0.1 logarithms per 50 CD4+
T cell decrease. Taken together, these observations are representative of a typical Mexican cohort, comprised mainly
of individuals in relatively advanced stages of HIV infection, often diagnosed at the moment of presentation at
the health care centers due to AIDS-related opportunistic
disease symptoms.
HLA allelic and haplotypic frequencies in a cohort of HIVpositive Mexican individuals
292 HIV-positive individuals from Central/Southern Mexico for whom class I HLA-A, B and C typing was available
were used to characterize the immunogenetic background
of this cohort. HLA allelic frequencies for the Mexican
cohort are shown in the Additional file 1: Figure S1, Table
S1. The most frequent alleles at the HLA-A locus were
A*02, A*24, A*68 and A*31; the most frequent alleles at
the HLA-B locus were B*39, B*35, B*40 and B*15; and
the most frequent alleles at the HLA-C locus were Cw*07,
Cw*04, Cw*03 and Cw*08 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Characteristically, more than 60% of the participating
individuals expressed A*02, more than 50% expressed
Cw*07 and more than a third expressed B*39 and/or
B*35 (Additional file 1: Figure S1, Table S1).

In order to more precisely describe the immunogenetic
background of the HIV-positive cohort of Mexican individuals, the frequencies of two and three-gene class I HLA
haplotypes were estimated. Due to the fact that the cohort
was composed of non-related individuals with unknown
family genetic backgrounds, a gametic phase estimation
for each individual was carried out prior to the calculation
of HLA haplotype frequencies as described in the Methods. A total of 192 different three-gene HLA haplotypes
were identified, of which 22 occurred at a frequency
higher than 1% (Figure 2). The most frequent three-gene

haplotypes were A*02/B*39/Cw*07, A*68/B*39/Cw*07
and A02*/B*35/Cw*04, all occurring at frequencies
higher than 4.5%. Considering two loci, a total of 121
possible haplotypes were found for HLA-A/B, 82 for HLAB/C and 92 for HLA-A/C. The most frequent two-gene
haplotypes were A*02/B*39, A*02/B*35, A*24/B*35 and
A*68/B*39 for HLA-A/B; B*39/Cw*07, B*35/Cw*04 and
B*40/Cw*03 for HLA-B/C; and A*02/Cw*07, A*68/
Cw*07 and A*02/Cw03 for HLA-A/C (Table 2). In general, there was lower variability among the HLA-B/C haplotypes compared to the HLA-A/C and the HLA-A/B
haplotypes, possibly due to the frequent linkage disequilibrium observed between HLA-B and C genes (Additional
file 1: Table S2).
HLA-A and B allelic frequencies in this study were compared to those previously reported in an open populationbased study of 381 individuals from 191 Mexican families

from Central/Northern Mexico [38] (Figure 3). Although
the geographical origin of the individuals in the latter
study differs somewhat from that of the individuals in the
present study, the large number of individuals from the
Central part of Mexico and the fact that the HLA typing
method used was the same as ours, renders this study an
adequate reference for a typical HIV-negative population
in Mexico for comparison with our study. The HLA frequency distribution of loci A and B was significantly different between the two studies (chi2 = 99.39, p =
0.00008), with differences in residuals seen only in B*39
(p = 2.25E-06, q = 1.19E-04), a typical Amerindian allele
group, which showed a frequency nearly two-fold higher
in HIV-positive individuals compared to HIV-negative
individuals (Figure 3). Whether having B*39 represents a
risk factor for HIV infection in Mexico remains to be confirmed, as the high frequency of this allele could also
reflect an epidemiological phenomenon such as B*39

individuals included in either of the two studies.
To our knowledge, this study is the first formal report of
class I HLA frequencies in a typical HIV-infected Mexican
cohort.
Unique immunogenetic Background in a cohort of HIVinfected, antiretroviral treatment naïve individuals from
Central/Southern Mexico
In order to highlight the unique immunogenetic background of the Mexican population with respect to other
populations in which HLA-associated HIV evolution has
been studied, an HLA frequency comparison was carried
out between our cohort of 292 HIV-positive individuals
from Central/Southern Mexico, a previously described
cohort of 1,045 HIV-positive individuals from British
Columbia, Canada (HOMER cohort) [34] and the large
International HIV Adaptation Combined (IHAC) cohort,
including 1,845 individuals from British Columbia, Canada; Western Australia and the USA (Figure 4). Although
both the HOMER cohort and the USA subset of the IHAC
cohort include a minority of individuals self-identified as
Hispanic, important differences were seen in HLA allele

distribution in the three cohorts that account for the typical genetic admixture of the Mexican population [38,39].
As expected, there were significant differences between the
allele frequencies of the cohort reported here and the
HOMER and IHAC cohorts (chi2 = 597.41 and 782.13, p
< 10-88 and 10-125, respectively). HLA-A*68, B*35, B*39,
B*48, B*52, Cw*04 and Cw*08 alleles were observed at
significantly higher frequencies in the Mexican cohort
compared to HOMER and IHAC cohorts (p < 0.005, q <
0.01), consistent with typical Amerindian alleles
[38,39,45]. Similarly, HLA-A*01, A*03, A*11, B*07,
B*08, B*13, B*27, B*44, B*57, Cw*05, and Cw*06 alleles were observed at significantly lower frequencies in the
Mexican cohort compared to HOMER and IHAC cohorts
(p < 0.005, q < 0.01), consistent with the higher frequency
of these alleles among Caucasians [38,39,45] (Figure 4).
Additionally, HLA-A*02 and A*24 alleles had significantly higher frequencies, and HLA-A*25, B*15 and
Cw*02 alleles had significantly lower frequencies in the
Mexican cohort than in HOMER and IHAC cohorts, not
specifically reported to be enriched in Amerindian, or
Caucasian groups. Notably, the frequency of HLA-B*39
alleles was more than 7 times higher in the Mexican
cohort than in HOMER and IHAC cohorts (Figure 4).
Taken together, these results confirm the characteristic

HIV-infected individuals from the Central/Southern
region of the country, and reveal a previously uncharacterized, unique immunogenetic background for the study of
HLA-associated HIV evolution at the population level.
HLA-mediated HIV evolution in a Mexican cohort
HIV evolution mediated by HLA selection at the population level was studied using a 434 amino acid fragment
spanning the whole HIV protease and 335 codons of the
reverse transcriptase in 280 chronically-infected individuals from this cohort. The phylogenetic dependency network (PDN) model by Carlson et al [14], currently one of
the most comprehensive models to assess HLA-mediated
HIV evolution, was applied to infer patterns of CTL escape
and codon co-variation in the Mexican cohort. Our results
were compared with those previously derived from applying the PDN model to a thoroughly characterized, multicenter, combined cohort of predominantly clade Binfected, antiretroviral treatment-naïve individuals from
British Columbia, Canada; Western Australia; and the

USA (the IHAC cohort), with a clearly different immunogenetic background compared to the Mexican cohort
[14,34,37,46] (Figure 4). The Mexican cohort was also
found to be predominantly clade B-infected (99.64%)
with only one subtype other than B/recombinant form
(CRF_06_cpx) identified (REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool
2.0, http://dbpartners.stanford.edu/RegaSubtyping/). A
phylogenetic tree for the Mexican pol sequences included
in this study is shown in the Additional file 1: Figure S2.
The PDN model was used to identify significant HLA-HIV
codon as well as HIV codon-HIV codon associations,
using a q-value threshold of 0.2. Due to the fact that the
PDN model uses a multivariate model in which several
predictor attributes (i.e. the presence or absence of a specific HLA or amino acid at an HIV codon) can be associated with the presence or absence of a specific amino acid
at an HIV target codon, spurious associations explained
by the presence of linkage disequilibrium among HLA
alleles and HIV codon covariation were minimized. A
total of 43 HLA-HIV codon and 251 HIV codon-HIV
codon associations were identified, representing 30 differ-

Differences
Differences in HLA frequencies between HIV-positive and HIV-negative Mexicans. Allelic frequencies were calculated for HLA-A and B genes, in the cohort of 292 HIV-positive individuals from this study (dark grey) and compared to those
previously reported for a cohort of 381 individuals of 191 Mexican families by Barquera et al [38] (light grey). HLA typing in
both cases was carried out by SSP-PCR as described in the Methods. For comparability, HLA nomenclature for histocompatibility used by Barquera et al. was substituted with its genetic equivalent, i.e. B65 and B64 were included as B*14 alleles; B62,
B63, B70, B71, B72, and B75 were included as B*15 alleles; and B61, and B60 were included as B*40 alleles, according to the
equivalents accepted by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/

ent HLA-HIV codon and 135 HIV codon-HIV codon pairs
(Additional file 1: Table S3). This association network was
depicted graphically with the PDN viewer PhyloDv http:/
/www.codeplex.com/MSCompBio[14] (Figure 5), showing the HIV amino acid sequence as a circle with lines
joining HLA alleles and associated HIV codons outside
the circle and arcs joining covarying HIV codons within
the circle. Even with a relatively small number of individuals in the cohort, a dense association network was
observed at q < 0.2 that reveals characteristic patterns of
HIV codon covariation and HLA-mediated substitutions

in the studied cohort. HLA associations were found at
6.1% of protease codons, and at 7.1% of RT codons. As
previously described for HIV Gag [14], covarying codons
were more frequent within a sub-protein (75.6% total:
20% within the protease and 55.6% within the reverse
transcriptase) than between sub-proteins (24.4%; p <
0.001). 28/135 (20.7%) of HIV codon pairs were within
10 positions of each other, suggesting a close proximity in
an important proportion of compensatory mutations, or
the targeting of multiple epitopes by the same HLA allele.
Notably, 46.7% of HLA-HIV codon associations predicted

substitutions at other codons, suggesting complex HLAmediated escape pathways.
Interestingly, there were only two HIV pol sites previously
associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs that were
also predicted to be associated with HLA selective pressure. B*18 was associated with an E to A change in RT
position 138. The polymorphism 138A is associated with
decreased response to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors
(NNRTIs), including etravirine (Stanford University HIV
Drug Resistance Database, http://hivdb.stanford.edu/).
Similarly, Cw*07 was associated with a lower probability
of having a D residue and a tendency for conservation of
a V residue in RT position 179. The polymorphism 179D
is associated with low level resistance to NNRTIs (Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database, http://
hivdb.stanford.edu/). These observations show that HLAmediated evolution can influence antiretroviral drug
resistance, both promoting and preventing the presence of

drug-resistance-related polymorphisms. This dual pressure phenomenon has been described previously [35,47];
however, its frequency and population impact in the Mexican cohort will have to be assessed further.
HLA-HIV codon associations found for the Mexican
cohort at q < 0.2 are presented in an epitope map in order
to confirm the validity of the associations (Figure 6). 10
HLA-HIV codon pairs can be explained by experimentally
confirmed epitopes, of which 5 have been optimally
defined
(Los
Alamos

Database,

www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/index.html).
Twelve additional HLA-HIV codon pairs can be confirmed
by epitope prediction with HLA peptide binding motifs
(Motif Scan Tool, Los Alamos HIV Database, http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/toolslinks.html). Eight HLA-epitope pairs could not be
explained by epitope mapping, possibly because of lack of
data on peptide binding motifs of associated HLA alleles

(e.g. B*39 and B*49), or because of the presence of false
positive associations (at q < 0.2, we expect 20% of the
associations to be false positives). The possibility also
exists that these associations represent escape mutations
within unusual (novel) epitopes, or escape mutations that
influence epitope processing that may occur far away from
the actual epitope. Indirect or "one-hop" associations of
the type a->b->c, where the HLA allele "a" is shown to predict the polymorphism "c", would be improbable as the
multivariate model of the PDN model minimizes them.
The same is true for associations with alleles in linkage
disequilibrium with the selective allele, as linkage disequilibrium is accounted for by the PDN model. Some additional associations observed without taking codon
covariation into account are also shown (Figure 6). Not

considering codon co-variation increases the power to
detect associations, but allows the presence of indirect
associations.
HLA-HIV codon associations found in the Mexican cohort
were compared to the ones previously found in a dataset
1845 HIV pol sequences from the combined IHAC cohort
[37] (Brumme ZL, John M, et al, PLoS ONE 2009, in
press) (Figure 6, Additional file 1: Table S3). Finding HLAHIV codon associations in the smaller Mexican cohort
that were not observed in the well-powered IHAC cohort
could be indicative of unique HLA-driven HIV evolution
in immunogenetically distinct cohorts. Not surprisingly,
many of the observed HLA-HIV codon associations in the
Mexican cohort were also predicted in the IHAC cohort,

280 individuals from Central/Southern Mexico using the previously described PDN model [14] that corrects for the confounding effects of HIV phylogeny, HIV codon covariation, and linkage disequilibrium of HLA alleles. Significant HLA-HIV polymorphism associations (q < 0.2) were located in an epitope map. Strongly significant associations (q < 0.05) are marked with yellow
stars. Experimentally defined CTL epitopes are shown in black http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/index.html,
epitopes predicted by HLA peptide binding motifs are shown in blue (Motif Scan, Los Alamos HIV Database, http://

allele and the associated amino acid residue in different colors depending on the type of leaf distribution of the association
obtained with the PDN model, i.e. escape (purple; having the predictor HLA makes it less likely to have the target amino acid),
attraction (red; having the predictor HLA makes it more likely to have the target amino acid), reversion (green, not having the
predictor HLA makes it more likely to have the target amino acid), repulsion (light blue; not having the predictor HLA makes it
less likely to have the target amino acid). Amino acids in lower case indicate associations obtained without considering codon
covariation. HLA-HIV polymorphism associations in the Mexican cohort were compared to the ones observed in the multicenter IHAC cohort including 1845 individuals from British Columbia, Canada, the USA and Western Australia [37] (Brumme

supporting the observation of highly conserved mutational patterns in HLA-driven HIV evolution (Figure 6,
Additional file 1: Table S3). Nevertheless, important differences were also noted between the two cohorts. From
the 43 HLA-HIV codon associations observed in the Mexican cohort, 23 were identified as novel associations, not
previously observed in the larger IHAC cohort (nor in previous similar studies [25,30,34]), representing 18 different HLA-HIV codon pairs. Although several of these are
likely to be false positives due to the 20% FDR, the fact
that 53% of the present associations were not found in the
well-powered IHAC cohort is striking. Furthermore, of
these 18 new HLA-HIV codon pairs, 8 involved associations with codons that were not associated with any HLA
allele in the IHAC cohort, and 4 involved associations
with B*39, which is substantially more frequent in the
Mexican cohort than in the IHAC cohort. Remarkably, 17
of the 23 novel associations involved HLA alleles whose
frequencies were statistically indistinguishable from those
in IHAC, suggesting that their presence is not due to
increased statistical power, but rather may be due to differences in patterns of epitope targeting. In addition, 2 of
the novel associations involved B*27 or B*08, two alleles
that were significantly less frequent in the present cohort
than in IHAC, which may reflect differences in epitope targeting between the cohorts or the fixation (and resulting
drop in statistical power) of escape mutations in the IHAC
cohort [9]. Interestingly, although previously identified as
HLA-associated in the IHAC cohort, some HLA-associated
HIV codons in the Mexican cohort showed different HLA
specificities and/or target amino acids. This was the case in
13 of the 23 novel HLA-HIV codon associations (10 of 18
HLA-HIV codon pairs). For example, Protease 71 V was
associated with B*39 in the Mexican cohort, while it was
associated with B*15 in the IHAC cohort; RT 245E was
associated with B*18 in the Mexican cohort, but with
B*57 in the IHAC cohort. Not surprisingly, B*39 was
much more frequent in the Mexican cohort (p = 1.80E-44,
q = 1.21E-42), while B*15 was more frequent in the IHAC
cohort (p = 0.00964, q = 0.0231) (Figure 4). On the other
hand B*57 was less frequent in the Mexican cohort (p =
0.000430, q = 0.00180) and no significant difference was

found for B*18. These associations can be explained by
experimentally confirmed or predicted epitopes both in
the Mexican cohort and in the IHAC cohort (Figure 6; Los
Alamos
HIV
Immunology
Database,
http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/index.html).
Both B*15 and B*39 are predicted to have an epitope in
position PR 68–76. These observations support the existence of sites in the HIV genome whose sequence variability at the population level reflects active selection pressure
by different HLA alleles, and support previous observations that different HLA alleles may drive identical (as
well as conflicting) escape mutations [48].
Interestingly, different consensus amino acids between
the Mexican and the HOMER cohorts were detected at
four Pol codons (Table 3). Two of these sites were HLAassociated in both cohorts, (RT 272 and RT 277), one was
HLA-associated in only the HOMER cohort (PR 93) and
one was not found to be associated to HLA in either
cohort (RT 293) (although the possibility of an undetected association with HLA cannot be discarded). This
observation supports the possibility of finding different
HLA footprints in different populations, even between
cohorts predominantly infected with viruses of the same
clade. The finding that three of the four observed changes
in consensus amino acids between the Mexican and the
HOMER cohorts could have originated from HLA-driven
pressure is also noteworthy. The role of HLA frequency in
the fixation of escape mutations was evident in the A*03associated position RT 277, where the escaped form R has
become fixed in the HOMER Pol consensus, while mainly
remained as the susceptible form K in the Mexican Pol
consensus. The A*03 allelic frequency in the HOMER
cohort was three times higher than in the Mexican cohort
(p = 7.08E-10, q = 1.00E-08) (Table 3, Figure 4).
As previously observed [22,49], HLA-B alleles were
involved in the majority of the associations (73% of HLAHIV codon pairs), compared to HLA-A and C alleles in the
Mexican cohort (p < 0.001 for both cases). Interestingly,
16.6% of HLA-HIV codon pairs were due to HLA-C alleles.
Although in previous studies many of the associations

apparently defined by HLA-C alleles represented indirect
associations with HLA-B or A alleles due to the HLA linkage disequilibrium phenomenon, the PDN model used in
the present study accounts for HLA linkage disequilibrium, minimizing the risk of finding these and other kinds
of indirect associations. Nevertheless, it is important to
note, that the ability of the PDN model to correct for HLA
linkage disequilibrium is positively correlated with sample size and negatively correlated with the strength of linkage disequilibrium. Thus, false positive associations could
still be found when strong linkage disequilibrium patterns exist, and random noise makes it difficult to distinguish the true associations. This could be the case for
Cw*15-associated position PR 18, which could not be
explained by epitope prediction. Cw*15 and B*51 are in
strong linkage disequilibrium in the Mexican cohort
(Additional file 1: Table S2), and an experimentally confirmed B*51 epitope exists that could explain the association. Although many of the HLA-C associations had high
q-values, and could represent false positive associations,
some of them were strongly associated and were in consonance with predicted and verified epitope mapping (Additional file 1: Table S3, Figure 6). These observations
suggest an important role of HLA-C alleles in shaping HIV
evolution at the population level in the Mexican cohort.
On the other hand, B*44 alone was responsible for 16.6%
of HLA-HIV codon pairs, followed by B*51 and B*39,
each responsible for 10% of the observed HLA-HIV codon
pairs (Additional file 1: Table S3, Figure 6). This predominance is not observed in the IHAC cohort, possibly suggesting different patterns of immunodominance and HIV
immune escape resulting from different epitope targeting
between the two cohorts. These observations further support the existence of differential patterns of HIV selection
by HLA alleles in populations worldwide.
Taken together, these results support the existence of
highly conserved, universal HLA-mediated mutational
patterns or "footprints" on HIV sequences at the population level. However, they also suggest that unique characteristics could exist in HLA-mediated HIV evolution in
immunogenetically distinct populations, which can be
detected even with cohorts of relatively small number of
individuals.
Differences in HIV evolution between free plasma virus
and PBMC proviral sequences
A subset of 250 HIV-infected individuals for whom HLA
typing and both pol PBMC proviral sequences and free
plasma virus pol RNA sequences were available was used
to compare HLA associated polymorphisms in two different viral compartments at the population level. The PDN
model was applied to both sequence datasets and results
were graphically depicted with the PDN viewer PhyloDv

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/72

[14] (Figure 7). In all, 36 HLA-HIV codon associations
were found for the free plasma virus sequences and only
24 for the PBMC proviral sequences, representing 27 and
15 HLA-HIV codon pairs respectively (Figure 7, Table 4).
Interestingly, the number of unique HLA-HIV codon pairs
observed in free plasma virus sequences was significantly
higher than the number of unique pairs in proviral
sequences (p = 0.0169), and only 10 of the HLA-HIV
codon pairs were observed in the two viral compartments.
These results are consistent with a recent study that
reported the presence of HLA-associated escape mutations
in plasma sequences that were rarely seen in the proviral
population within some infected individuals [50]. The
observation that an overall different evolution was seen in
plasma viral sequences compared to proviral sequences,
with a significantly lower number of HLA-associated sites
in proviral sequences, is consistent with the model that
suggests that proviral sequences represent early archived
HIV in the latent reservoir and that plasma sequences represent a population that has evolved further in response to
immune selective pressure. Furthermore, these observations are suggestive of a dynamic development of CTL
responses throughout the infection, such that early CTL
responses are reflected in the archival proviral compartment while the plasma compartment reflects more recent
CTL responses [51,52]. We note, however, that proviral
HLA-HIV site associations did not correlate with previously defined rapidly escaping sites under HLA pressure in
clade B-infected Caucasian individuals [25]. This fact
might reflect different rates of escape between demographically divergent cohorts, or it might reflect differing
compartment-based CTL selective pressures that are simply reflective of the archival nature of the proviral
sequences.
Interestingly, the number of covarying HIV sites common
to both compartments was lower than the number of covarying sites observed exclusively in plasma or in proviral
sequences (p = 0.0489). Moreover, a large number of covarying sites was seen in proviral HIV sequences possibly
reflecting remnants of viral adaptation to previous hosts.
Overall, differences in HLA-mediated selection were
observed in the plasma virus and the PBMC provirus compartments, suggesting a highly dynamic HLA-associated
evolution in HIV, as many of the HLA-HIV codon associations in the free plasma virus compartment were not evident in the proviral dataset, which likely contains early
archived HIV sequences that appear to reflect less adaptation to within host HLA-mediated immune responses.

Discussion
In this study we have presented evidence suggesting that a
unique HLA allele frequency distribution in a cohort of
clade B-infected Mexican individuals has left unique foot-

prints on HIV sequences at the population level. We studied HLA-mediated HIV evolution in a clade B-infected
Mexican cohort, comparing our data with data from the
IHAC cohort, the largest clade B-infected cohort used to
assess HLA-mediated evolution so far, which is composed
of individuals from Canada, Australia, and the USA [37]
(Brumme ZL, John M, et al, PLoS ONE 2009, in press).
The two cohorts were shown to present notably different
immunogenetic backgrounds, with an important admixture of Amerindian genes in the population of the Central/Southern part of Mexico (Figure 4). These different
immunogenetic backgrounds provided a chance to assess
the role of different HLA allele distributions in HLA-mediated selection in two cohorts infected by viruses of the
same clade. The present cohort was shown to reflect the
typical characteristics of an HIV-infected Mexican cohort,
enriched in individuals in relatively advanced stages of
HIV disease and presenting a similar HLA allele frequency
distribution to the general population (Figure 3), with
some specific exceptions (e. g. B*39) that will have to be
assessed further in future studies.
Previous studies have suggested that HIV evolution at the
population level follows broadly predictable, highly conserved mutational patterns associated with host CTL selective pressure [16,23,24,33-35]. Conclusions obtained
from a direct comparison between different studies in different populations have been limited mainly due to the
use of different methods and models for assessing HLAmediated viral evolution in which important sources of
confounding are frequently not accounted. We applied
the recently described PDN model [14], which simultaneously accounts for HLA linkage disequilibrium, HIV
codon co-variation and viral lineage effects, to clade B pol
sequences (Additional file 1: Figure S2) from the present
cohort and compared the results to the immunogenetically distinct population of the IHAC cohort. Our data
support the observations of highly conserved, universal,
HLA-associated footprints in the HIV proteome at the
population level, as many of the HLA – HIV codon associations found in the Mexican cohort have consistently
been observed in the IHAC cohort, as well as in previous
studies with diverse cohorts [24,33-35,37].
Interestingly, however, our data also suggest the existence
of unique HLA-associated footprints in HIV, which could
be influenced by specific HLA frequency distributions in
different HIV-infected populations. The unique characteristics of HLA-mediated selection in the Mexican cohort
was revealed not only by the presence of unique HLA-HIV
codon pairs not detected in the IHAC cohort, but also by
the presence of HIV positions previously identified as
HLA associated, and with different HLA specificities and/
or target amino acids in the two cohorts. The extent to
which these unique HLA-associated footprints represent a

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/72

real biological phenomenon and not a statistical effect
will have to be further assessed with experimental data;
nevertheless, evidence presented in this study strongly
suggests the existence of real differences between the two
cohorts. Although the Mexican cohort was much smaller
than the IHAC cohort (the power to detect associations
increases dramatically with sample size [14]), resulting in
only 20% of the expected associations being confirmed in
the present cohort, the fact that 53% of the HLA-HIV
codon associations were novel in the Mexican cohort
strongly suggests differences in HLA-mediated evolution
between the two clade B-infected cohorts. Although these
novel associations may represent false negatives from the
IHAC cohort, that cohort is large enough that the false
negative rate is expected to be quite small and any false
negatives are likely to be rare events in it [14]. It is also
possible that the novel associations represent false positives in the present cohort; however, with an expected
20% false-positive rate due to the q < 0.2 threshold, the
number of novel associations found in the Mexican
cohort is striking. In addition, of the 18 novel HLA-HIV
codon pairs in the Mexican cohort, at least 11 (61%) can
be explained by confirmed or potential CTL epitopes (Figure 6), strongly arguing for the validity of these associations and for the existence of real biological differences in
HLA-mediated selection between the two cohorts
The observation of point differences in the population
consensus sequences of the two cohorts which were
mapped to HLA-associated sites is a piece of evidence that
further supports the differential impact of HLA selection
in HIV evolution at the population level (Table 3). This
was the case of position RT 277, associated with A*03
both in the Mexican cohort and in the IHAC cohort, in
which the adapted form 277R has become fixed in the
IHAC consensus while the susceptible form 277K has
remained in the Mexican consensus. Not surprisingly, the
frequency of A*03 was three times higher in the HOMER
cohort than in the Mexican cohort (p = 7.08E-10, q =
1.00E-08), supporting an important role of HLA allele frequency in the fixation of HLA escape mutations at the
population level (Figure 4, Table 3). Similarly, PR 93 was
associated with B*15 in the IHAC cohort with the susceptible form 93I observed in this cohort's consensus, but the
adapted form 93L observed in the Mexican consensus.
Although no direct HLA association was detected in the
Mexican cohort at this site (probably due to statistical
power issues), position PR 93 was associated with other
HIV sites, such as PR 71, which is HLA associated (Figure
6). Thus, changes in population consensus sequences may
be linked with HLA-mediated selection. Also of interest is
the observation that B*44 was associated with 5 of the 30
HLA-HIV codon pairs identified in the Mexican cohort.
Two of these associations have been described in the
IHAC cohort and two have been previously identified as

HLA-HIV codon and HIV codon-HIV codon associations for the free plasma virus and PBMC proviral Pol
sequences. Phylogenetic dependency network maps were generated with the PhyloDv software http://www.codeplex.com/
MSCompBio. Each map shows HLA associations as tags pointing to their corresponding sites, and HIV codon-HIV codon associations as inner arcs connecting the associated sites. Plasma: all associations in free plasma virus from 250 patients that had a
corresponding PBMC proviral sequence. Proviral: all associations for 250 PBMC proviral sequences. Conserved (shared):
shared HLA-site or site-site associations between proviral and plasma sequences. If one amino acid at one site was associated
with two different amino acids at another site (e.g. one for escape, one for reversion), only one association was counted.
Unique plasma: associations only found to be significant in free plasma virus samples. Unique proviral: Associations only found
to be significant in PBMC proviral samples. Significance was calculated with the binomial test; q-values are represented as a heat
map shown in the lower inset. Associations with q < 0.2 are shown (all associations had p < 0.002). The upper inset table
shows the number of significant associations in each map.
HLA-associated positions with different HLA specificities
(Figure 6). The strong influence of B*44 on HLA-mediated HIV evolution in the Mexican cohort could reflect
differences in immunodominance hierarchies of CTL
responses in the context of different HLA frequency distributions. Whereas strongly immunodominant CTL
responses could be masking the effect of other less immunodominant responses in one cohort, these responses
could have a greater impact on HLA-mediated HIV evolution in another cohort in which the immunodominant
responses are infrequent. It is notable that the frequencies
of many strongly immunodominant HLA alleles, such as
B*57, B*27, B*08, B*07, A*03, and A*11 [25], are lower
in the Mexican cohort compared to the IHAC cohort (q <

0.05) (Figure 4). It is possible that in the latter cohort, CTL
responses restricted by these alleles could be masking the
effect of other less immunogenic alleles that are frequently seen in the Mexican population. Indeed, this
could be the case for Cw*07, the most frequent HLA-C
allele group in the Mexican cohort, which explains 10% of
HLA-HIV codon pairs observed in our analysis. These
associations are unique to the Mexican cohort, and are
supported by predicted epitopes and/or a strong statistical
association (q < 0.05) (Figure 6).
The case of B*39 is also noteworthy, being the most frequent HLA-B allele group in the Mexican cohort with a frequency 7 times higher than that observed in the IHAC

cohort (p = 1.80E-44, q = 1.21E-42) (Figure 4). B*39
explained another 10% of the HLA-HIV codon pairs identified in the Mexican cohort, suggesting either a strong
influence of this allele in HIV evolution in the immunogenetic context of the Mexican cohort or a higher statistical power to detect associations. Interestingly, B*39restricted associations were primarily escape associations
(where possession of B*39 made it less likely to have the
target amino acid in question), in which the target amino
acid was a residue other than the consensus, suggesting
that the consensus residue represents a possible escaped
form for B*39 at this position (Additional file 1: Table S3,
Figure 6). This could be suggestive of a frequent role of the
B*39 allelic group in HIV codon conservation in the Mexican cohort. This HLA-associated conservation of sites has
been previously described with highly frequent HLA alleles that promote the accumulation of CTL adapted variants in different populations [22,23].

been described above for the Mexican cohort, suggesting
that a set of immunogenetically diverse cohorts could
greatly enrich HIV evolutionary studies without the need
of very large cohorts. It should also be noted that a broad
two-digit HLA allele grouping does not reveal all possible
divergence in HLA pressure, as a number of HLA subtypes
with different peptide-binding motifs can be defined at
four-digit level within some allelic groups such as B*35,
B*40, B*51, B*58, A*02, all with highly characteristic distributions in different populations [9,49]. Thus, significant divergence in selection in some cases could be
explained by different dominant four-digit subtypes of the
broad allele group in the compared cohorts. This fact
could have an impact on statistical power to detect associations defined by different subtypes within a broad allele
group in different populations and further argues for the
unique HLA-associated imprinting of HIV in different
populations.

Overall, two general key aspects could explain the observation of different associations in cohorts that are infected
by viruses of the same clade but which have different HLA
frequencies: 1) Different patterns of immunodominance,
which argue for real differences in CTL epitope targeting;
and 2) Different statistical power to detect associations,
which argues for a statistical effect rather than a biological
difference. For example, the absence of strong immunodominance patterns in certain populations could potentially facilitate the detection of HIV polymorphisms
associated with less immunodominant alleles. Being able
to confirm this possibility at the population level strongly
relies on low false positive/negative rates. Although the
false negative rate on the IHAC data is low, further experimental data is necessary to confirm this point. On the
other hand, different HLA frequencies can simply change
the statistical power to detect associations, thus supporting the importance of assessing HLA-mediated selection
in a diverse set of cohorts. The possibility also exists that a
simple statistical power issue could be resolved by combining different cohorts infected by the same viral clade to
make a larger reference set, supporting the creation of a
universal set of associations that could get updated periodically as new sequences are added. Such a sequence and
association database would allow extrapolation from a
large reference set to new demographic groups for which
collection of cohorts would be difficult. The fact that 17 of
the 23 novel HLA-HIV codon associations in the Mexican
cohort involved HLA alleles whose frequencies were not
significantly different from those in the IHAC cohort
strongly suggests that their presence is not due to
increased statistical power but rather may be due to differences in patterns of epitope targeting. Furthermore,
immunodominance effects as well as statistical power
issues depending on HLA frequencies could both exist in
the same dataset. Examples of both phenomena have

In summary, although important limitations exist for the
analysis of HLA-mediated HIV evolution in the Mexican
population, including the presence of false positive associations and the low power to detect associations, our
analysis yielded strong evidence suggesting that unique
characteristics in HLA-mediated HIV evolution in the
Mexican cohort indeed exist. These include the striking
proportion of unique HLA-HIV codon associations in the
Mexican cohort (many of which can be supported by predicted or confirmed CTL epitopes), the presence of HLAassociated differences in the consensus sequence with
respect to the HOMER consensus (which reflects differential fixation of CTL escape mutations at the population
level with a high dependency on HLA frequency), and the
existence of a high proportion of novel associations that
involve HLA alleles whose frequencies were similar in the
Mexican and the IHAC cohorts (which argues against a
statistical power issue in detecting at least some of the significant associations).
To further characterize HLA-mediated HIV evolution,
HLA-HIV codon and HIV codon-HIV codon associations
were compared in free plasma virus and PBMC proviral
DNA in the cohort of Mexican individuals. As shown by
graphically depicting the PDNs for the two viral compartments, different mutational patterns and different HLAHIV codon associations were seen in actively replicating
plasma viruses and PBMC-archived proviruses at the population level. A significantly lower number of HLA-HIV
codon associations was observed in proviral sequences
and there were more distinct than shared HIV codon-HIV
codon associations in the two compartments (Figure 7).
This could be explained by the observation that proviral
sequences frequently represent a stable reservoir of HIV
sequences archived early in the course of the infection
[53], whereas plasma viruses represent sequences from

Page 19 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

Retrovirology 2009, 6:72

later in the course of infection. Thus, the proviral
sequences may have been archived before some epitopes
were targeted by host CTL responses, or before escape
mutations had a chance of being selected at epitopes
already being targeted by CTLs, resulting in fewer associations in proviral sequences than in the extant plasma
sequences. Indeed, previous studies have shown the presence of HLA-associated escape mutations in plasma
viruses that are rare in proviruses within infected individuals [54]. Nevertheless, proviral HLA-HIV codon pairs
could not be mapped to known epitopes of early escape
[25] in the present data, although the possibility exists
that a larger cohort and analyses in other viral genes could
further support this correlation. However, given the differences in escape association that we have observed
between the Mexican and IHAC cohorts and the observation that the cohort described [25] is immunogenetically
similar to the IHAC cohort, it may be that the discordance
between proviral escape associations reported here and
previously reported early-escape epitopes reflects different
patterns of CTL epitope targeting and kinetics between the
two populations. The proviral associations in the Mexican
cohort could thus represent early escape events in a Latin
American cohort setting.
Surprisingly, some HLA associations detected for proviral
sequences were not seen in the plasma virus dataset. Some
of these HLA-HIV codon pairs observed exclusively in proviral sequences have fairly high q-values, possibly suggesting the presence of false positive associations. However,
unique proviral associations could also suggest a chronological reshaping of HLA-mediated HIV evolution, reflecting rapidly reverting mutations which are lost soon after
transmission to HLA-mismatched individuals. Alternatively, the existence of organ compartmentalization of
HIV variants within an infected host and its relation to
positive selection has been described [55]. This phenomenon could explain population differences between
actively replicating viruses coming from a specific compartment with characteristic selective pressures and
archived proviruses, remaining as reservoir(s) originating
from different anatomical and/or cellular compartments.
Shared associations between the plasma virus and the
PBMC provirus compartments may reflect sites in the viral
proteome with continuous CTL targeting throughout the
chronic infection, a characteristic that might be of interest
in the selection of candidate vaccine targets. On the other
hand, these apparently more stable associations could
also reflect epitopes with early CTL targeting that has
stopped, but for which no reversion has occurred, suggesting low fitness costs for escape. If the latter case were true,
some shared associations might be more likely to reach
fixation at the population level in the future. This would

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/72

have implications for our understanding and predictive
capabilities of HIV adaptation in human populations.
Similarly, unique coevolving HIV codon pairs were
detected in proviral sequences and in plasma virus
sequences, perhaps reflecting different patterns of compensatory mutations to the different HLA escape mutations observed in the two compartments. Alternatively,
unique proviral HIV codon-HIV codon pairs could be
explained as a reorganization of mutational patterns in
HIV evolution that reflect escape mutations selected in
previous hosts as well as new mutations selected in the
current host, while unique plasma virus HIV codon-HIV
codon pairs could reflect sequential footprints left by viral
adaptation to HLA-restricted responses in chronic infection in the current host. These observations bring up interesting consequences for our understanding of HLAmediated HIV evolution, suggesting that the appearance
and density of the PDNs for a specific population are
highly dynamic and could vary in time. The dynamic
development of CTL responses over the course of infection within an individual has been previously reported
[51,52]. Further studies in follow-up cohorts or in carefully stratified cross-sectional cohorts might be able to
support or refute these observations.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our data derived from analysis of HLAmediated HIV evolution in a previously uncharacterized,
immunogenetically unique cohort from Central/Southern
Mexico, support a highly conserved and strongly predictable component of HLA-mediated HIV evolution at the
population level, resulting in HLA-associated footprints
in the circulating virus worldwide. This effect is evident
even after considering important objections to the HLAHIV population imprinting hypothesis, such as the rapid
reversion of a considerable part of the total CTL escape
mutations in the absence of the selective HLA allele [56],
the complexity of the CTL response which frequently
imposes conflicting selective forces in the same site of the
viral sequence [27], the possibility that an escape variant
selected by a specific HLA allele can be targeted by CTL
responses restricted by different HLA alleles [18,30,57],
and the dynamic immunodominance hierarchies
observed in HLA-restricted responses [51,52]. Interestingly, the HLA-mediated evolution analysis in our cohort
of Mexican individuals showed additional HLA-HIV
codon associations that have not been described in previously studied cohorts, including the large multi-center
IHAC cohort with a clearly different immunogenetic background to the Mexican cohort. This fact supports the possibility that these specific associations are not significantly
impacting HIV evolution at the population level in other
cohorts, but that they are significant in the immunogenetic context of the Mexican population. Comparative

HLA-mediated HIV evolution studies, with comparable
methods that take into account important confounding
factors such as HIV codon covariation, HIV lineage effects
and HLA linkage disequilibrium, can thus be useful in
identifying these distinct HLA-associated footprints in different populations worldwide. Extending such comparative studies to other immunogenetically distinct cohorts,
would allow the reconstruction of a more complete panorama of the impact of HLA selection in HIV evolution
worldwide. This knowledge may prove useful for the
development of vaccine candidates and the development
of therapeutic strategies directed to specific populations.
The creation of a universal database of HLA-associated
HIV sites applying comprehensive and comparable models to assess HLA-mediated evolution in immunogenetically divergent cohorts from different parts of the world,
including cohorts predominantly infected by different
viral clades, would greatly improve our understanding of
HIV evolution worldwide. Importantly, further experimental evidence will help to understand the limitations
imposed by statistical models to detect footprints of HLAassociated evolution in HIV in different populations.
Additionally, a comparison between HLA-mediated evolution in free plasma virus and PBMC proviral sequences
suggested a highly dynamic HLA-associated evolution in
HIV, as many of the HLA-HIV codon associations
observed in the free plasma virus compartment are not
evident in the proviral dataset, which is presumably
enriched in early HIV sequences and does not reflect the
full extent of within-host HLA-driven viral evolution.
Moreover, shared HLA-HIV codon associations in both
viral compartments could be of interest, reflecting
epitopes with continuous CTL targeting throughout the
chronic infection or, alternatively, escape mutations with
low fitness costs that could reach fixation at the population level in the future. Further studies with larger cohorts
and various viral genes could enrich these primary observations and increase our understanding of HIV adaptation
to different populations worldwide.

Two additional figures and three additional tables. Figure S1 – Allelic
and population frequencies for class I HLA-A, B and C genes in a cohort
of HIV-infected individuals from Central/Southern Mexico. Frequencies
were obtained with the HLA Frequency Analysis Tool of the Los Alamos
HIV Immunology Database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunol
ogy/tools-links.html. HLA typing was carried out by SSP-PCR as described
in the Methods. A total of 292 individuals (584 HLA alleles) were
included; 19, 29 and 14 distinct allelic groups were observed for the HLAA, B and C genes respectively. Figure S2 – Phylogeny of 280 HIV pol
sequences from a cohort of antiretroviral treatment-naïve individuals from
Central/Southern Mexico. A Neighbor-Joining tree was inferred through
the analysis of 1305 bp pol sequences including the whole protease and
335 codons of the RT in MEGA 4.0. The consensus tree from 1000 bootstrap replicas is shown. Evolutionary distances were calculated with
Kimura's two-parameter model and are shown in substitutions per site.
Positions with missing information were eliminated by pairwise comparison. 93 reference sequences of the main HIV-1 groups, subtypes and
recombinant forms, obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html
were included. Reference subtype B sequences are shown in blue, reference
sequences of all other subtypes and recombinant forms are shown in red
and Mexican sequences are shown in black. The inset shows a detail of the
Mexican sequence cluster. Table S1 – HLA-A, B and C population and
allelic frequencies in the Mexican cohort. Table S2 – Linkage disequilibrium for class I HLA-A, B and C genes in the Mexican cohort. Table S3
