<p>Analysis of plastid transporter proteins
Host origin of plastid solute transporters in Arabidopsis suggests a host origin and provides new insights into plastid evolution.</p>

Abstract
Background: It is generally accepted that a single primary endosymbiosis in the Plantae (red,
green (including land plants), and glaucophyte algae) common ancestor gave rise to the ancestral
photosynthetic organelle (plastid). Plastid establishment necessitated many steps, including the
transfer and activation of endosymbiont genes that were relocated to the nuclear genome of the
'host' followed by import of the encoded proteins into the organelle. These innovations are,
however, highly complex and could not have driven the initial formation of the endosymbiosis. We
postulate that the re-targeting of existing host solute transporters to the plastid fore-runner was
critical for the early success of the primary endosymbiosis, allowing the host to harvest
endosymbiont primary production.
Results: We tested this model of transporter evolution by conducting a comprehensive analysis
of the plastid permeome in Arabidopsis thaliana. Of 137 well-annotated transporter proteins that
were initially considered, 83 that are broadly distributed in Plantae were submitted to phylogenetic
analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that 58% of Arabidopsis transporters, including all
carbohydrate transporters, are of host origin, whereas only 12% arose from the cyanobacterial
endosymbiont. Four transporter genes are derived from a Chlamydia-like source, suggesting that
establishment of the primary plastid likely involved contributions from at least two prokaryotic
sources.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the existing plastid solute transport system shared by
Plantae is derived primarily from host genes. Important contributions also came from the
cyanobacterial endosymbiont and Chlamydia-like bacteria likely co-resident in the first algae.

Background

Plastids in eukaryotes that contain chlorophyll are capable of
carrying out photosynthesis, a process that converts light
energy, carbon dioxide, and water into organic compounds.
The evolutionary history of this organelle unfolded over a billion years ago when a previously non-photosynthetic protist
engulfed and maintained a free-living cyanobacterium in its
cytoplasm [1]. It is hard to over-state the importance of this
ancient and extraordinarily rare primary endosymbiosis
because plastids allowed the evolution of algae and the plants
that form the base of the food chain for many ecosystems on
Earth. Current data suggest that the primary endosymbiosis
occurred once in the common ancestor of the red, green
(including land plants), and glaucophyte algae, the Plantae
[2-4], with the original plastid and the nuclear-encoded
machinery for running the organelle spreading in subsequent
cell captures to other branches of the eukaryotic tree [5-7].
The only other known case of a potential bona fide cyanobacterial primary endosymbiosis occurred relatively recently in
the thecate amoeba Paulinella chromatophora [8,9].
The gradualist view of evolution through mutation-selection
suggests that it would have taken millions of years for the captured prokaryote to become fully integrated into the 'host'
eukaryote, ultimately becoming the site not only for carbon
fixation but also for other complex functions, such as lipid,
isoprenoid, and amino acid biosynthesis [10]. These processes were associated with the migration of much of the
cyanobacterial genome to the host nucleus and development
of the complex protein import system that are key shared features among all canonical plastids [3,11,12]. A remarkable
exception to the view that endosymbiosis was a gradual process of integration is offered by the katablepharid protist
'Hatena', which undergoes large-scale morphological changes
following the engulfment of a green alga [13].
Regardless of whether the ancient primary endosymbiosis
fostered an accelerated rate of morphological evolution in the
Plantae ancestor or whether general cell morphology was
unchanged as in the Paulinella example [14], one thing is
clear - in the absence of rapid benefits to the host it is unlikely
that the endosymbiosis would long have been sustained.
Given the need for short-term survival, a key feature of early
success for the endosymbiosis must have been the integration
of the metabolism of the two cells. The key to this process
would have been solute transporters that regulate the flux of
metabolites (for example, ATP, phosphate, sugars and sugar
phosphates, metal ions, and other important ions) across the
organelle membranes. Controlled exchange in response to
environmental factors such as changes in light intensity and
trace metal availability [15-17] is decisive because the unregulated flux of metabolites would have had detrimental effects
and, thereby, lowered the evolutionary fitness of the endosymbiosis. A complex system of solute transporters is in place
today in extant plastids that provides the link between this
organelle and the surrounding cytosol [18-20]. Here we focus

on the evolutionary history of these plastid metabolite transporters to infer early events in plastid evolution.
We make two assumptions in this study. First, a system of
metabolite transporters was a critical and early development
in plastid evolution to supply the endosymbiont with essential nutrients and to enable the host to reap immediate benefit
from photosynthetic primary production. It is unclear why
the cyanobacterium that was destined to become the plastid
escaped digestion in the host but this scenario has also played
out in 'Hatena' and in Paulinella. Second, whereas the
genome of the previously free-living cyanobacterium encoded
all the transport systems required for the uptake of essential
inorganic nutrients, it most likely did not harbor genes encoding transporters for the export of organic solutes to the host this would have served no obvious pre-existing purpose in the
prokaryote. Precisely how the plastid solute transport system
was established is unknown. One possible model involves a
primarily cyanobacterial origin, in which the plastid continued to utilize its own original cyanobacterial solute transporters with their evolution over time into proteins that perform
most or all currently known plastid permeome functions. An
alternative model involves a host-driven solute transport system, likely derived from the vacuolar envelope that initially
surrounded the endosymbiont after its engulfment [3]. And
finally, both of the new partners could have contributed proteins equally to this machinery, resulting in a chimeric system
composed of the most beneficial combination possible of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic transporters. To determine which
of these competing hypotheses best explains plastid transporter evolution, we undertook an initial bioinformatics analysis of 137 Arabidopsis thaliana solute transporters and then
a detailed phylogenetic analysis of a subset of 83 conserved
proteins that included available data from other Plantae. The
Arabidopsis transporters are either predicted or have been
shown to be chloroplast targeted and are ideal for tracking
plastid permeome evolution. Using these data we demonstrate that over one-half of Plantae plastid targeted transporters are putatively of host origin whereas less than a quarter
arose from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont. This suggests
that the lasting contribution to the Plantae host-endosymbiont relationship with regard to the plastid solute transport
system was made primarily by host genes. We also find evidence for the origin of four transporter genes or gene families
from a Chlamydia-like source. This latter result raises the
possibility that establishment of the ancient primary plastid
may have involved contributions from at least two prokaryotic sources, perhaps explaining its singular nature. This hypothesis received substantial support from the recent finding of
at least 21 genes of Chlamydia-like origin in the nuclear
genome of the extremophilic red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae [21].

Distribution of transporters within Plantae
Phylogenetic analysis of the best-annotated transporter data
that are currently available from Arabidopsis was used to
identify and putatively annotate homologs from other Plantae. Of 137 transporter proteins that were initially considered,
BLAST and phylogenetic analyses and manual curation of
recently available data led to the identification of 83 proteins
that were of sufficient conservation and broad distribution
among Plantae to be used for further analyses. Each of these
83 proteins that included gene families (that is, representing
63 distinct, ancestral genes; Table 1) was used as input in
BLAST and PHYML bootstrap analyses to infer the trees. This
approach identified 41 proteins that are present in both red
and green algae (including land plants) and, therefore, were
likely found in the Plantae ancestor (glaucophyte homologs
were found for some of these genes; for example, ADP/ATP
translocase, hypothetical protein At3g45890). Eleven proteins were restricted to green algae and land plants, seven
were plant-specific, and two were limited to red algae and
land plants. The distribution of these proteins with respect to
their putative origin in Plantae is shown in Figure 1a. Given
the lack of evidence for widespread horizontal gene transfer
in extant Plantae, which most likely lost the capacity for
phagotrophy early in its evolution [4,22], we postulate that
the patchy distribution for many plastid targeted transporters
primarily reflects differential gene loss over the greater than
one billion years that has passed since the primary endosymbiosis [1]. Under this interpretation, the large set of shared
transporters among Plantae lineages provides resounding
support for the monophyly of this supergroup [23].

Analysis of the phylogenetic data supports the notion that the
host drove the integration of plastid and host metabolism. We
find that the majority (58%, when considering all 83 genes;
Figure 1b and Table 1) of the plastid solute transporters were
most likely derived from existing host membrane proteins
(see Figure S1 in Additional data file 1 for all trees). These 48
proteins are diverse in nature, including several ABC transporters, nucleotide and amino acid permeases, sulfate, potassium, magnesium, and iron transporters, and cation efflux
proteins (see Figure 2 for S-adenosylmethionine carrier 1
(SAMT) and Arabidopsis thaliana folate transporter 1
(AtFOLT1) trees). Of particular interest is the finding that in
addition to the members of the nucleotide-sugar/triose phosphate translocator gene family previously reported to be of
host origin [3], all other carbohydrate transporters included
in our analysis were derived from existing host proteins. This
result strongly suggests that the host utilized existing eukaryotic transport proteins pre-adapted to this function to 'tap'
into the photosynthates produced by the captured cyanobacterium. In addition, the Plantae host also provided transporters to facilitate the movement of valuable nutrients such as
magnesium, potassium, iron, and phosphate into the captured prokaryote. The replacement of pre-existing cyanobacterial anion and cation transporters with host derived
proteins again suggests that there was strong selection to rapidly establish control over and utilize the endosymbiont. This
process was most likely accomplished by using transporters
derived from the host vacuolar envelope [3].

The cyanobacterial contribution
The cyanobacterial endosymbiont putatively contributed ten
solute transporters to the plastid transport system (Table 1,
Figure S2 in Additional data file 1). These proteins include trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 1 (TGD1; Figure 3a), which is
required for integrating the prokaryotic (that is, cyanobacterial) with the eukaryotic (that is, endoplasmic reticulum)
pathway for lipid biosynthesis [24-26], the metal-transporting P-type ATPase PAA1 [27,28], and a transporter required
for folate/biopterin biosynthesis [29]. The remaining seven
proteins of unknown function that are localized to the chloro-

plast inner membrane were included in the cyanobacterial
group. Whereas the predicted secondary structure of most of
these proteins indicates they represent transporters (that is,
they contain at least four transmembrane domains that are
connected by short loops), some, such as the ABC1-family
protein At5g64940 (Figure 3b) contain only one or two predicted transmembrane domains and may thus have functions
other than metabolite transport. It is also intriguing that with
the exception of the PAA1 copper transporter the only cyanobacterial transport proteins apparently retained by Arabidopsis are those for which the host lacked a suitable

Plastid targeted solute transporters of putative 'Host' origin in Plantae
Plastid targeted solute transporters of putative 'Host' origin in Plantae. These are RAxML trees with the numbers above the branches inferred from a
RAxML bootstrap analysis and the thick branches showing significant (P > 0.95) support from a Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Only bootstrap values ≥
60% are shown. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale bars). The filled magenta circle shows the node that
unites the Plantae taxa within the eukaryotic domain. The different algal groups are shown in different text colors: red for red algae, green for green algae
and land plants, and brown for chromalveolates. The inclusion of chromalveolates within the Plantae is believed to reflect horizontal or endosymbiotic
gene transfer events (for example, [50]). The two transporters are: (a) SAMT, S-adenosylmethionine carrier 1 protein; and (b) AtFOLT1, Arabidopsis
thaliana folate transporter 1. The name of the A. thaliana solute transporter used for the query is indicated for both trees shown in this figure.

replacement. For example, the initial steps of folic acid biosynthesis in plants are confined to the chloroplast; the final
steps are localized in the cytosol and in mitochondria [30-32].
Plastids thus depend on an external folate supply and require
an uptake system for this important metabolite. Interestingly,
redundant systems for folate uptake exist in Arabidopsis
chloroplasts, consisting of the cyanobacterial-derived folate
transporter FT [29] and the host-derived transporter
AtFOLT1 [33].

'Chlamydia-like' transporters
In addition to the host and cyanobacteria, a third significant
contributor to the Plantae plastid solute transport system is
the Chlamydiae. A surprisingly high number (four) of plastid
envelope membrane transporters have been contributed by
these prokaryotes. The presence of plant-like genes in
Chlamydia has been noted in the past, sparking debate over
whether their presence indicated a transfer from the ancestral
plant to Chlamydia, an evolutionary relationship between
cyanobacteria and Chlamydia, or a horizontal gene transfer

(HGT) from a chlamydial parasite to the plant ancestor [3436]. Phylogenetic analysis of plastid, Chlamydiae, and Rickettsiae ADP/ATP translocases [36] supports an ancient
Chlamydia-to-Plantae direction of transfer. This explanation
for the origin of the ADP/ATP translocase gene (and other
Chlamydial-like genes) in Plantae was strongly supported by
the phylogenomic analysis of Huang and Gogarten [21]. We
found a monophyletic relationship between the AtNTT1 and
AtNTT2 (the Arabidopsis plastid ADP/ATP translocases) and
Chlamydiae ADP/ATP translocases (Figure 4a) [37,38]. In
addition, the copper transporter heavy metal ATPase 1
(HMA1; Figure 4b), the dicarboxylate translocators (DiTs)
DiT1, DiT2.1, and DiT2.2, and the low affinity phosphate
transporter PHT2;1 (see Figure S3 in Additional data file 1
and [21]) apparently has a chlamydial origin in Plantae. All of
these trees provide bootstrap (except for the DiT tree) support for the monophyly of the 'Chlamydia-like' and plastid
transporters. In the case of HMA1 there are two ancient paralogs in plants, one of cyanobacterial likely endosymbiotic
origin and one from a Chlamydia-like source that is shared

Figuretargeted solute transporters of putative 'Cyanobacterial' (that is, plastid endosymbiont) origin in Plantae
Plastid 3
Plastid targeted solute transporters of putative 'Cyanobacterial' (that is, plastid endosymbiont) origin in Plantae. For details of tree building see Figure 2.
The filled magenta circle shows the node that unites the Plantae taxa as sister to cyanobacteria. The different photosynthetic groups are shown in different
text colors: blue for cyanobacteria, red for red algae, green for green algae and land plants, and brown for chromalveolates. The inclusion of
chromalveolates or Euglenozoa (Eugl.) within the Plantae is believed to reflect horizontal or endosymbiotic gene transfer events (for example, [50]). The
two transporters are: (a) TGD1, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 1, lipid transporter; and (b) ABC1-family transporter protein. The name of the A. thaliana
solute transporter used for the query is indicated for both trees shown in this figure.

with red and green algae. The DiTs [39] are present only in
green algae, plants, and bacteria (that is, not in red algae).
Whereas genomic data for glaucophytes are not yet available,
transport experiments using isolated Cyanophora cyanelles
showed that this glaucophyte uses a transport system for
glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate that is distinct from green
plant DiTs [40]. Taken together, these data indicate that
'Chlamydia-like' dicarboxylate translocators have likely been
lost from red algae and glaucophytes. An alternative explanation is that the gene was acquired by the green lineage after
the split of Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta. A DiT2 gene was
also found in the dinoflagellates Amphidinium carterae and
Heterocapsa triquetra, which likely originated from an independent HGT. Several 'green' genes have been found in dinoflagellates and other chromalveolates that could have either
originated from multiple independent HGTs or an ancient
green algal endosymbiosis (for discussion, see [41]).
In summary, it is surprising that bacteria not putatively
involved in the endosymbiosis contributed 8% of the transporters that we have identified. When one considers the functions of these transporters, the chlamydial contribution

becomes more important. HMA1 increases copper and/or
zinc transport into the plastid under conditions of high light,
facilitating the production of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), which protects the plant from superoxide radicals produced under high light conditions [42,43].
PHT2;1, a phosphate transporter, controls phosphate allocation under conditions of phosphate-starvation [44]. The DiT
transporters are involved in assimilating nitrogen and recovering carbon lost to photorespiration, a process that is initiated by the oxygenation reaction of Rubisco that primarily
occurs under conditions when a high O2:CO2 ratio is present
in the vicinity of Rubisco. Mutants lacking these transporters
are unable to survive in ambient CO2 concentrations
[17,45,46]. Finally, the AtNTT1 and AtNTT2 transporters are
required for ATP import into the plastid during the dark (that
is, in the absence of photosynthetic ATP production), particularly during lipid and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Although
AtNTT2 mutants are still capable of producing lipids, indicating that the plastid has an alternative method for generating
the ATP required for lipid biosynthesis, the production is significantly reduced and mutant plants have a sharply reduced
growth rate [16]. Arabidopsis mutants deficient in both

Figuretargeted solute transporters of putative 'Chlamydia-like' origin in Plantae
Plastid 4
Plastid targeted solute transporters of putative 'Chlamydia-like' origin in Plantae. For details of tree building see Figure 2. The filled magenta circle shows
the node that unites chlamydial taxa with plastid targeted Plantae transporters. The different photosynthetic groups are shown in different text colors:
blue for cyanobacteria, red for red algae, green for green algae and land plants, magenta for glaucophytes, and brown for chromalveolates. The inclusion of
chromalveolates within the Plantae is believed to reflect horizontal or endosymbiotic gene transfer events (for example, [50]). The two transporters are:
(a) ADP/ATP translocater; and (b) heavy metal ATPase (HMA1) copper transporter. The name of the A. thaliana solute transporter used for the query is
indicated for both trees shown in this figure.

AtNTT1 and AtNTT2 develop necrotic lesions when grown
under short days, accumulate H2O2, and, strikingly, show
constitutive expression of CuZnSOD2 and ascorbate peroxidase [47]. The phenotype of the mutant was linked to reduced
magnesium chelatase activity and it was concluded that ATP
import into plastids in the dark is required for chlorophyll
biosynthesis and for preventing photooxidative damage [47].
The import of ATP into plastids in the dark is thus clearly a
case in which the endosymbiont benefits from host metabolism. The ancient origin of these transporters in the tree of
photosynthetic eukaryotes (Figure 4a) is indicative of an
essential role of this uptake system in the formation of the
endosymbiosis. With the exception of the DiT translocators,
each of these transporters appear to perform somewhat
redundant functions (that is, copper and phosphate transport) but in a way that permits the plant to adapt to stresses
involved in life on the land (that is, high light and O2 levels or
low phosphate availability). This may explain why the genes
encoding these four plastid transporters have been retained
in the Arabidopsis genome.
How the 'Chlamydia-like' genes entered into the Plantae
ancestor is unclear but it is possible that both the
cyanobacterial endosymbiont and chlamydial parasites may
have co-existed in the cell. Many environmental Chlamydia
are known today that are broadly distributed in animals and

protists [48]. The co-existence of these two distinct
prokaryotes may have provided the genetic 'toolkit' to make
permanent the endosymbiosis with gene transfer from each
cell providing essential functions for endosymbiont utilization. An alternative explanation is that the cyanobacterial
endosymbiont was itself highly chimeric (that is, the 'fluid
chromosome model') [49] and contained genes of chlamydial
origin that had been gathered through HGT. Although possible, this scenario seems less plausible because it invokes, for
example, the presence of an ADP/ATP translocator (a gene
typical for 'energy parasites' such as Rickettsiae) in the
genome of an oxygenic photosynthetic cell that is unlikely to
encounter high concentrations of ATP in the surrounding
environment; that is, it is absent from all studied cyanobacteria. Additional discussion of these issues can be found in
Huang and Gogarten [21].

'Other' and 'Plantae-specific' transporters
We were unable to conclusively determine the origin of 18
transport proteins. Fourteen of these data sets resulted in
PHYML trees in which the Plantae transporters were rooted
within prokaryotes but without bootstrap support for a specific affiliation. An excellent example is provided by
At1g32080 (Figure 5a), which is a putative membrane protein
conserved among Plantae, chromalveolates, and a diverse set
of Eubacteria and Archaea (that is, the Thermococcus and

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R212

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/10/R212

Genome Biology 2007,

Pyrococcus clade). Although the prokaryotic source of this
gene in Plantae is unclear with the available data, the eukaryotic clade is clearly monophyletic, which is consistent with a
single gene origin in the Plantae ancestor and, thereafter,
transfer to chromalveolates (for example, diatoms in this
tree) via secondary endosymbiotic gene transfer [50]. The
unresolved provenance of At1g32080 and the 'Other' set of
transporters in Plantae can be explained by pervasive HGT
followed by full or partial gene replacement or differential
gene loss among prokaryotes that has erased the ancient phylogenetic signal. Alternatively, these results may indicate
erratic rates of sequence divergence that make it impossible
to model protein evolution for these sequences. Given the
growing evidence, however, for recurring HGT among bacteria [51], it is likely that genes in the 'Other' category have
reticulate evolutionary histories. In this regard it is noteworthy that the likely frequent HGTs seen in Figure 5a among
prokaryotes and other genes in the 'Other' category contrasts
starkly with the apparent single origin and vertical inheritance in Plantae (for example, At4g30580, At5g13720,
At5g52540, At5g62720; Figure S4 in Additional data file 1).
This result suggests a clear difference in rates of HGT for
these genes with elevated rates in prokaryotes relative to
eukaryotes.
Of the remaining transporters, four fell in the 'Plantae-specific' category because they lacked identifiable homologs outside of this supergroup and may simply be too divergent to
determine their origin. This includes At5g24690 (Figure 5b, a
hypothetical expressed protein) and the plastidic maltose
exporter MEX1. The latter is required for export of maltose
resulting from starch breakdown from plastids at night in
green plants (Figure S5 in Additional data file 1). Storage of
starch inside the chloroplast is exclusively found in the green
linage. Therefore, MEX1 has likely co-evolved with plastidbased starch biosynthesis and breakdown since it can be
detected only in members of the Viridiplantae with one gene
found in the dinoflagellate Karlodinium micrum, which, as
described above for Dit2, likely has resulted from a HGT.

Conclusion

Here we determined the phylogeny of 83 Arabidopsis plastid
solute transporters to determine whether they are of endosymbiotic origin from the captured cyanobacterium, of host
origin, or of a 'mixed' origin from both of these sources. Our
analysis has afforded a rare look at early, critical events in primary plastid evolution and support the notion that integration of plastid-host metabolism was primarily driven by hostderived transporters with important contributions coming
from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont and Chlamydia-like
bacteria. Another class of proteins of currently unknown origin included plant specific transporters such as MEX1.
Despite the power of our comparative approach, our work has
some important limitations. One is that because we used the
Arabidopsis transporter set, we most certainly have missed a

Volume 8, Issue 10, Article R212

Tyra et al. R212.9

number of Plantae transporters that are specific to red or
green algae and have been lost from the Arabidopsis genome.
In addition, we lack significant data from glaucophytes, but
the upcoming Cyanophora paradoxa (glaucophyte) nuclear
genome sequence [52] will allow us to incorporate this lineage
into future inferences about transporter evolution. It is reasonable to assume, however, given the wealth of data supporting Plantae monophyly [2-4,7], that our inferences
regarding the red and green lineages also apply to their glaucophyte sisters. Despite these limitations and the fact that
phylogenetic signal is imperfectly maintained over a billion
years of evolution, our comprehensive analysis of the chloroplast solute transport system will likely hold up and can be
further tested as other genome sequences become available.

Materials and methods
Initial transporter analyses
As a starting point for the compilation of a conservative set of
predicted or confirmed plastid envelope membrane transporters, we used a previously published list of 137 plastid-targeted membrane proteins that was based on predicted plastid
localization and classification by the transporter classification system [10]. This list was manually curated to remove
proteins from the list if published evidence indicated that
they were localized to a cellular location other than chloroplasts, if they represented membrane-bound enzymes, or if
they were annotated as components of the TIC/TOC protein
import apparatus, the photosynthetic machinery of the thylakoid membrane, or the Sec or Tat protein targeting pathways.
This curated list of candidate genes was updated and
amended with recently published chloroplast envelope
membrane transporters, such as AtFOLT1, a plastid localized
transporter belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that
does not contain a plastid targeting signal [33] and was thus
not included in previous lists. The final list contained 83 A.
thaliana predicted or confirmed chloroplast solute
transporters.
The sequence for each protein was obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource website [53]. These protein
sequences were used as queries in blastp and tblastn searches
of the NCBI Database [54], the plant and algal genomes available through the Joint Genome Institute [55], the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project website [56], the Galdieria
sulphuraria Genome Project website [57], and Dragonblast
V2.1 (SE Ruemmele, unpublished data), a web based
database in the DB lab that contains EST datasets for several
chromalveolates, Plantae, excavates, Rhizaria, and Amoebozoa. We used the predicted protein sequences for the following species for our analysis whenever available: Arabidopsis

vis, Danio rerio, Mus musculus, Canis familiaris, and Homo
sapiens. In addition, we included at least one insect, three
fungal species, and a broad range of Bacteria and Archaea in
our analysis. The BLAST searches used an e-value cut-off <
10-5. If a translated EST sequence was not available, the
nucleotide sequence was translated over six frames using the
ExPASy translate tool [58]. The resulting protein sequences
were used in a BLAST search against the NCBI protein database to ensure the correct translation was obtained.

We used the ClustalW feature included with BioEdit V7.0.5.3
to generate protein alignments [59]. Alignments were visually
inspected and manually corrected if necessary. Trees were
generated under maximum likelihood using PHYML V2.4.4
utilizing the WAG model of amino acid substitution and estimating both the proportion of invariable sites and the alpha
parameter (that is, WAG + I + Γ)[60]. We performed nonparametric bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates for each
PHYML analysis. The resulting trees were analyzed to deter-

mine the origin of the transporter in Arabidopsis and other
Plantae.
The designation of gene origin was done as follows. When the
Plantae solute transporter formed a well-supported (usually
> 70% bootstrap support) monophyletic group with
homologs in opisthokonts (that is, animals and fungi) and
secondarily with other eukaryotes such as excavates and
chromalveolates (if present), then it was classified as having a
'Host' origin. Under this scheme, no bacterial sequences
interrupted the eukaryotic domain. 'Cyanobacterial' or
'Chlamydia-like' origin was inferred if the Plantae sequence
formed a monophyletic group with protein sequences from
either of these lineages with strong bootstrap support. Other
bacterial or eukaryotic sequences could (not necessarily) be in
these trees but there had to be a robust separation of the Plantae + cyanobacteria or Chlamydia-like clade from all other
homologs. We had two other categories of gene origin that
likely reflected a lack of phylogenetic resolution or pervasive
HGT among taxa that defied a clear inference of origin. The
first was the 'Other' category in which the Plantae transporter
formed a well-supported monophyletic clade but its position
relative to available bacterial data was unresolved, thereby
not allowing us to identify the donor taxon. The second, 'Plantae-specific', was for transporters that had no significant hits
to sequences in GenBank or other databases and appeared to
be limited to the Plantae. All of the transporter PHYML bootstrap trees are available in Additional data file 1. The protein
alignments are available in the download section of the Bhattacharya Lab website [61].

were run for two million generations each with trees sampled
every 100th generation. To increase the probability of chain
convergence, we sampled trees after the standard deviation
values of the two runs were < 0.01 to calculate the posterior
probabilities. We also ran the Bayesian analysis for the
remaining two putative 'Chlamydia-like' genes in Plantae
(dicarboxylate translocators DiT1, DiT2.1, and DiT2.2, and
the phosphate transporter PHT2;1) to assess the topologies.
We incorporated a representative diversity of available
sequences in all of these trees.

Detailed phylogenetic analyses
For eight representative transporters from the five categories
described above we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogeny using RAxML (RAxML-VI-HPC, v2.2.1) [62] and the
WAG + Γ evolutionary model. The specific transporters were:
'Host' - At4g39460 (SAMT, S-adenosylmethionine carrier 1
protein, 236 amino acids), At5g66380 (AtFOLT1, Arabidopsis thaliana folate transporter 1, 268 amino acids); 'Cyanobacterial' - At1g19800 (TGD1, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 1,
lipid transporter, 234 amino acids), At5g64940 (ABC transporter protein, 487 amino acids); 'Chlamydia-like' At1g15500 (chloroplast ADP, ATP carrier protein 2, 436
amino acids), At4g37270 (HMA1, copper exporting ATPase,
444 amino acids); 'Other' - At1g32080 (putative membrane
protein, 211 amino acids); 'Plantae-specific' - At5g24690
(hypothetical expressed protein, 274 amino acids). These
detailed analyses used a random starting tree (one round of
taxon addition) and the rapid hill-climbing algorithm (that is,
option -f d in RAxML). To generate bootstrap values for these
phylogenies, we used RAxML with the same settings and 100
replications. In addition, we used Bayesian inference
(MrBayes V3.0b4) [63] with each of the eight data sets using
the WAG + I + Γ model to calculate posterior probabilities for
nodes in the RAxML trees. Metropolis-coupled Markov chain
Monte Carlo from a random starting tree was used in this
