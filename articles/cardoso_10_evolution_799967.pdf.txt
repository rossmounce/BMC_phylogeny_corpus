Evolution of female carotenoid coloration by
sexual constraint in Carduelis finches
Research article

Abstract
Background: Females often express the same ornaments as males to a similar or lesser degree. Female ornaments can
be adaptive, but little is known regarding their origins and mode of evolution. Current utility does not imply
evolutionary causation, and therefore it is possible that female ornamentation evolved due to selection on females, as
a correlated response to selection on males (sexual constraint), or a combination of both. We tested these ideas
simulating simple models for the evolution of male and female correlated traits, and compared their predictions
against the coloration of finches in the genus Carduelis.
Results: For carotenoid-based ornamental coloration, a model of sexual constraint on females fits the Carduelis data
well. The two alternative models (sexual constraint on males, and mutual constraint) were rejected as causing the
similarities in carotenoid coloration between males and females. For melanin coloration, the correlation between the
sexes was weaker, indicating that males and females evolved independently to a greater extent.
Conclusions: This indicates that sexual constraint on females was an important mechanism for the evolution of
ornamental carotenoid coloration in females, but less so for melanin coloration. This does not mean that female
carotenoid coloration is non-adaptive or maladaptive, because sexual dichromatism could evolve if it were
maladaptive. It suggests, however, that most evolution of female carotenoid coloration was male-driven and, when
adaptive, may not be an adaptation stricto sensu.
Background
Sexual ornaments are often expressed in males and females
of the same species, to the same or different degrees. It is
well established that male ornaments evolve mainly due to
sexual selection [1]. Female ornaments were previously
thought to be a non-adaptive consequence of the evolution
of male ornamentation [2,3], but several recent studies
show that females can also benefit from expressing elaborate ornaments [reviewed in [4-8]]. Therefore, female ornaments appear to be adaptive in many cases.
A little addressed question is whether female ornaments
are adaptations stricto sensu (i.e., evolved due to selection
on females). This is an important question because current
utility of a trait does not imply evolutionary causation [911]. In the case of female ornaments, it was suggested that
they, and the mechanisms that make them adaptive (e.g.,
male mate preferences), could evolve as pleiotropic conse* Correspondence: gcardoso@mail.icav.up.pt

quences to selection on the opposite sex, i.e., sexual constraint [3,12-14]. We use the word "constraint" in the sense
of a genetic phenomenon biasing evolution towards certain
phenotypes but not absolutely barring others, rather than in
the stronger sense of "evolutionary forbidden trajectories"
or "absolute evolutionary constraints" [15]. One way of
addressing this question is to investigate the historical pattern of evolution of female ornaments relative to male ornaments. This was done in different taxa (insects, cichlid
fishes, herptiles and birds) with mixed results [16-24]. All
the existing studies reconstructed ancestral states for male
and female ornaments. Some of them [16,17] found that
male and female ornaments originated asynchronously, suggesting that female ornaments did not evolve by sexual constraint but rather due to selection on females. Alternatively,
it could also be that asynchronous evolution of male and
female ornamentation reflects selection on female traits
(e.g., aggressiveness) that are developmentally linked to
ornaments, rather than selection of female ornaments per se
[24]. These results should be interpreted with caution
because ancestral state reconstruction is imprecise [25-27],

and it produces wide confidence intervals [28,29] especially when analysing evolutionarily labile traits, as is typical for sexual ornaments [30,31]. Investigating the
synchrony of male and female ornament evolution using
ancestral state reconstruction should be particularly sensitive to this problem. This is because when male and female
ornamentation evolved synchronously reconstruction inaccuracies desynchronise the inferred changes, but when evolution was asynchronous such inaccuracies will probably
still yield a pattern of asynchronous evolution (since there
are many ways to be asynchronous). This can bias conclusions towards asynchronous, and thus independent, evolution of female ornamentation.
Alternative comparative methods are therefore needed for
a better understanding of the relation between the evolution
of male and female ornaments. In this paper we use a
method based on evolutionary simulations to investigate the
evolution of male and female coloration of Carduelis
finches (Aves, Fringillidae, Carduelinae). Briefly, we simulated male and female evolution superimposing alternative
models that can cause the observed correlation between the
sexes. The uncertainties of the evolutionary process that
hamper ancestral state reconstructions are not discarded
here, but are incorporated in the simulations in the form of
evolution by random motion (e.g., [32,33]). This noise is
used to establish confidence intervals for the predictions of
the different evolutionary models, which are then compared
to the real data.
We simulated three simple models for the evolution of
male and female coloration (which we call constraint on
females, constraint on males, and mutual constraint) and
test their predictions against a real dataset. In the model of
constraint on females, males evolve independently and the
similarity between the sexes is entirely due to the evolution
of females being constrained by the conspecific male phenotypes. The model of constraint on males is the exact
reverse: the similarity between the sexes is due to male phenotypes being constrained by the conspecific female phenotypes. These are very simple models but, since they are the
exact reverse of each other, they provide an unbiased
framework to test whether constraint on males or on
females was the most important evolutionary mechanism.
Finally, the model of mutual constraint simulates an intermediate situation, where evolution in both sexes is constrained by the phenotype of the other sex. The important
feature of this last model is its symmetry, whereby the phenotypes of males and females are equally pulled towards
each other.
We test these models against data from a single large
genus of birds, because the coloration of closely related
species is expected to exhibit similar patterns of organization [34,35], and thus it is likely that we are quantifying coloration traits that are homologous across species. Most
species in the genus Carduelis have both yellow or red car-

Page 2 of 9

otenoid-based coloration [36-39], and a variable extent of
black melanin-based coloration that ranges from the wing
coverts to almost the entire body [40]. Carduelis comprises
both sexually monochromatic species (i.e., where males
and females look alike) and sexually dichromatic species
with males having more ornamental coloration than
females, but no apparent cases of "reversed" sexual dichromatism [40]. There is evidence that in this genus carotenoid
coloration is object of female preferences [41,42], a better
indicator of condition than melanin coloration [42,43], and
more evolutionarily labile [44]. This suggests that in this
group sexual selection influences the evolution of carotenoid coloration, maybe more strongly than melanin coloration [45]. For sexually selected traits the optimal male and
female phenotypes are more likely to differ, because males
can be subject to stronger sexual selection due to their
greater variance in reproductive success [46]. Therefore, we
hypothesised that sexual constraint may be more important
for carotenoid coloration because of the putatively different
phenotypic optima for males and females.

Methods
Coloration measurements

We measured 26 coloration traits (including colours, extent
of colour patches, and pigmentation patterns) on skins of
the 29 Carduelis spp. available at the ornithological collection of the Natural History Museum of London. Detailed
descriptions of measurements, as well as the male and
female values for each species, are given in ref. [47].
Briefly, we obtained reflectance spectra for various body
parts where carotenoid- and melanin-based plumage coloration (i.e., greenish-yellow to red coloration, and dark-grey
to black, respectively [36-39,48]) are expressed consistently across species [40], and computed measures of
colour brightness, saturation and, for carotenoid-based coloration, hue. Plumage colours of museum specimens can
fade with time, but for good quality specimens that is too
slight to invalidate their use in studies of avian coloration
(e.g., [49,50]), especially for comparisons between sexes
and species, as we do here. We also quantified the extension
of carotenoid and melanic coloration in various body parts,
and categorized the patterns of pigmentation and the colour
of beak and legs.
In order to obtain inclusive measures of ornamental coloration, we calculated scores for different types of coloration (carotenoid-based, melanin-based, and all coloration)
as described in ref. [47]. Briefly, for carotenoid coloration
we first ran a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the
set of 16 measurements obtained from the areas where Carduelis species most often have carotenoid coloration
(breast, wing, tail featheredges and rump). This returned
three Principal Components (PCs) that are significant by
the broken-stick criterion [51], and together they explain
61% of the variation. We calculated the carotenoid color-

Cardoso and Mota BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/82

ation score as the sum of these PC scores scaled by their
eigenvalues. Similarly, for melanin coloration we ran a
PCA on the four measures derived from black coloration.
The eigenvalue of the first PC from these PCA is lower than
the critical broken-stick value, but the eigenvalues of the
first two PCs are larger than one and explain 65% of the
variation. Thus, we computed the melanin coloration score
as the sum of these two PC scores scaled by their eigenvalues. These PCs are characterised by several strong positive
trait loadings of the coloration measurements and few and
weak negative loadings, and therefore quantify different
aspects of ornamental elaboration. Finally, we obtained an
overall score for all coloration measurements from a PCA
on all 26 measurements. This returned five PCs with eigenvalues that are significant by the broken-stick criterion, and
together they explain 66% of the variation. As above, these
PCs are characterised by strong positive trait loadings, and
negative loadings are much fewer and lower in absolute
value. We computed the total coloration score as the sum of
those five PC scores scaled by their eigenvalues. Trait loadings for all PCs are given in the online Supplementary
Table S2 of ref. [47].
We looked primarily at the evolution of these three coloration scores, because they quantify ornamentation in a comprehensive way. Although individual PCs explain only a
small proportion variation in coloration, we also analysed
the first PC (PC1) of each coloration type separately, to
assess if results are qualitatively different when studying
composite coloration scores or simple PCs.
Phylogeny reconstruction

We reconstructed the phylogeny of the genus by Bayesian
inference with the software MrBayes 3.1 [52,53] using all
the Carduelis and outgroup mitochondrial cytochrome b
sequences in ref. [54]. We obtained the consensus tree using

Page 3 of 9

a General Time Reversible model with a proportion of
invariable sites and gamma-distributed rate variation across
sites (to account for multiple nucleotide substitutions in the
same sites), and running it until trees converged (standard
deviation of split frequencies < 0.01 at 3 million generations). The resulting phylogeny is given in ref. [47]. The
phylogenetic tree comprises 23 of the species in our dataset
of colour measurements, and we based our subsequent phylogeny-based analysis on this subset of species. We found
that the coloration of Carduelis, both male and female, and
both carotenoid and melanin, fits a speciational tree significantly better than a chronogram or a genetic distances tree
[47]. Therefore, we used the rooted speciational tree in all
analyses (speciational tree in Figure 1B of ref. [47]).
Simulations

The following procedure simulates different possible
causes for the similarity between males and females. Therefore, all evolutionary simulations are calibrated to produce
the real correlation observed between the sexes in the 23
species of Carduelis comprised in the phylogeny. The correlation coefficient between the sexes is different for the
different types of coloration. Thus, we ran separate simulations, each calibrated to produce on average the real correlation coefficient observed for the appropriate type of
coloration.
In all simulated models, Brownian motion makes the
sexes evolve independently of each other. Brownian motion
was generated by adding a random number, from a normal
distribution with average zero and standard deviation one,
stepwise for each branch in the phylogeny from root to tips
(Table 1, step 1; e.g., refs. [32,33]). The standard deviation
of the random numbers is arbitrary: results are identical as
long as it is the same in all simulations. This provides synchronous phenotypes of males and females at each node in

the phylogeny, which we modified by one of three forms of
constraint (Table 1, steps 2 and 3). The three forms of constraint that we simulated all avoid reversed sexual dichromatism by preventing male scores being lower than
females' (or, equivalently, preventing female scores being
higher than males'; Table 1, step 2), and generate correlated
evolution between the sexes by approaching the male and
female conspecific scores in each lineage (Table 1, step 3).
The assumption that male coloration scores are higher or
equal to females' (Table 1, step 2) is necessary because otherwise we would obtain both sexually dichromatism and
reversed sexual dichromatism, which is unrealistic because
there is no reversed sexual dichromatism in Carduelis (i.e.,
female coloration is similar to or less conspicuous than
males', Figure 1; ref. [40]). Like in many other taxa, the preponderance of sexual dimorphism in which males are the
more ornamented sex is thought to reflect the generally
higher intensity of sexual selection on males [46]. This step
was simulated in a very simple way but, since in opposite
models this step is exactly reversed, it does not introduce
any bias in the testing procedure. Likewise, the approach of
the conspecific male and female scores (Table 1, step 3) is
necessary so that the extant male and female phenotypes are
correlated, and this too was applied to opposite models in a
reversed way that does not introduce bias.
These constraints (Table 1, steps 2 and 3) affect only one
or both sexes in the different models. In the model of constraint on females this affects only the females' phenotypes,
in the model of constraint on males this affects only the

Page 4 of 9

males', and it affects both sexes equally in the mutual constraint model, as follows:
In the model of constraint on females, females cannot surpass the synchronous conspecific male score in any time
interval (when that happens the female score is reset to be
equal to the male's), and at each step in the phylogeny, the
female phenotype is pulled in the direction of the conspecific male by a constant proportion of their phenotypic difference. Likewise, in the model of constraint on males,
male scores cannot be lower than the conspecific female
scores (when that happens the male score is automatically
reset to be equal to the female's), and are pulled towards the
conspecific female phenotype by a constant proportion of
phenotypic differences. In the model of mutual constraint,
when the male is less conspicuous than the female they are
both set to their average; also, both sexes are equally pulled
to the average of their phenotype values by a constant proportion of their phenotypic difference. The constant used to
approach the phenotypes of the two sexes in each model
(Table 1, step 3) was calculated iteratively so as to produce
extant phenotypes with an average correlation between
extant males and females equal to the real Carduelis data.
The models are thus equally parameterised, allowing for
direct comparison of their predictions [55].
Statistical testing

Each of the above simulations was run 1000 times, and
from the set of extant phenotypes produced in each run we
computed three descriptive statistics. These are the statistics that will be compared with the real Carduelis data, and

we predicted a priori that these would differ between models. The statistics were computed after standardization of
the joint distribution of male and female extant phenotypes.
The three descriptive statistics are: 1) the difference of standard deviations of male and female extant phenotype distributions, as the dispersion of phenotypes is expected to be
lower in the constrained sex because constraints limit the
extent of independent evolution; 2) the skew (Zg1 of D'Agostino and Pearson [56], in ref. [57], p. 117) of the combined
distribution of male and female extant phenotypes, as this
distribution is predicted to be asymmetrical in the direction
of the more variable independent sex; and 3) the difference
of slopes of the regressions between the sexes' phenotypes,
which is predicted to vary depending on which sex is constrained.
Details of the rationale and predictions for these statistics
are as follows. 1) The dispersion of phenotypes is expected
to be lower in the constrained sex because the modelled
constraints impose limits to evolutionary diversification.
Thus, the difference of male and female standard deviations
tends to be positive when males are the independent sex,
negative when females are the independent sex, and intermediate between those in the mutual constraint model. 2)
The joint distribution of simulated phenotypes is made up
of two distributions (male and female) with different averages. As the phenotypes of the independent sex tend to be
more variable, the joint distribution will tend to be asymmetric and skewed in the direction of the independent sex;
in the mutual constraint model skews should be intermediate. 3) The slope of the regression of female on male phenotypes is expected to be lower when males are the
independent sex and higher when females are the independent sex. This is because in this group females are ornamented to a similar or lesser degree than males. Thus, when
males are the independent sex, any decrease in male coloration of sexually monochromatic species pulls the female
phenotype towards the lower left area of the plots in Figure
1 (i.e., sexually monochromatic and little ornamented species), increasing the density of species there and resulting in
shallower slopes. If females were the independent sex,
decreasing female ornamentation would not result in a similar increase in the density of sexually monochromatic and
little ornamented species, because male coloration might or
might not also decrease. On the contrary, steeper slopes are
expected when females are the independent sex, because
increasing female coloration of sexually monochromatic
species pulls male phenotypes to the upper right area of the
plots (i.e., monochromatic and ornamented species). If
males were the independent sex, increasing male ornamentation would not result in a corresponding increase in the
density of these sexually monochromatic and very ornamented species, because female coloration might or might
not also increase. As these asymmetries do not exist in the
mutual constraint model, intermediate slopes are expected

there. The slope of the regression of female on male phenotypes varies in the opposite direction of the alternative slope
of male on female phenotypes; these two slopes show
greater sensitivity at one or the other ends of the slope
range, so that greater distinctiveness of model predictions is
achieved with the difference of the two slopes, which we
used.
Using only the simulation results, not the real Carduelis
data yet, we quantified how distinct are the predictions of
each pair of models, as the probability of a statistic generated by a model falling within the 95% confidence interval
of the other. This is the probability of statistical type II error
when trying to assign a statistic to a single model (the null
hypothesis being that the statistic can be assigned to both
models) or, equivalently, 1 minus the statistical power to
discriminate among models. We conservatively used twotailed 95% confidence intervals throughout. Finally, we
compared each descriptive statistic of the real Carduelis
standardized data with the distributions generated by the
simulated models. A model is rejected when the Carduelis
data falls outside the two-tailed 95% confidence interval of
the model's simulated outcomes. The best support for an
evolutionary model implies both not rejecting it, and rejecting its alternatives.

Results
Figure 1 shows the relation between conspecific male and
female carotenoid, melanin and total coloration scores.
Male scores are either larger than females' (sexually dichromatic species with males more ornamented than females),
or the scores of both sexes are similar (sexually monochromatic species). The correlation between conspecific male
and female coloration scores was stronger for carotenoid
coloration (r = 0.893, N = 23, P < 0.001) and total coloration (r = 0.848, N = 23, P < 0.001), and weaker for melanin
coloration (r = 0.560, N = 23, P = 0.005). Similar results
were obtained when controlling for relatedness with phylogenetic General Least Squares (GLS) regressions [58] of
female on male coloration scores (GLS regressions run with
BayesTraits,
available
from
http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk, estimating the parameter λ to quantify and
correct for the phylogenetic signal in the data [59]). For carotenoid coloration the standardized GLS regression β =
0.835, for melanin coloration β = 0.638, and for total coloration β = 0.885 (all P < 0.001), and in all cases there was a
strong phylogenetic signal (estimated λ for carotenoid coloration = 0.87, for melanin coloration = 0.96, and for total
coloration = 0.60).
The predictions of the three evolutionary models were
very similar using one of the descriptive statistics: the skew
of the joint male and female distribution (SK). The probability of a simulated SK value falling within the confidence
interval of an alternative model was always larger than
87%. Therefore, the power to discriminate models with this

Cardoso and Mota BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:82
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/82

statistic was low, and it never discriminated among models
or rejected any model (Table 2). For the other two statistics
[difference of standard deviations (DSD) and difference of
regression slopes (DRS)], in the carotenoid coloration and
total coloration simulations the power to discriminate
between the two extreme models was good (probability of
statistics within confidence interval of alternative model
always < 42%), but the power to discriminate between the
model of mutual constraint and the others was lower (probability of statistics within confidence interval of alternative
model always > 69%). For the simulations of melanin coloration, which were calibrated to produce weaker correlations between the sexes, the predictions of each model were
more variable and thus the power to discriminate models
was low (probability of statistics within confidence interval
of alternative model always > 76%). The probabilities of
type II error for each pair of models and coloration score
are given in the Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S1.
Table 2 shows the percentiles on which the Carduelis data
fall relative to the predictions of the alternative models. For
carotenoid coloration, the Carduelis data fall within the
interval of confidence of the model of constraint on females
for all statistics, and both the models of constraint on males
and of mutual constraint were rejected as explaining the
similarity between the sexes (statistics: DSD and DRS, both
P < 0.01; Table 2). For melanin coloration the Carduelis
data falls within the confidence intervals of all models
(Table 2), and thus there was no model discrimination. For

Page 6 of 9

total coloration the results are intermediate between those
for carotenoids and melanins: the models of constraint on
females and of mutual constraint were not rejected, and the
model of constraint on males was rejected (DSD and DRS,
P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively; Table 2).
Supplemental Table S2, in Additional file 1, shows the
result of similar analyses using only the PC1 for each type
of coloration. For carotenoid coloration, the model of male
constraint was rejected using the same statistics as above
(DSD and DRS, both P < 0.01), but there was only a nonsignificant trend to reject the model of mutual constraint
(DSD and DRS, P = 0.11 and 0.12). As above, there was no
model discrimination for melanin coloration (Additional
file 1: Supplemental Table S2). For the PC1 of total coloration there was a non-significant trend for rejecting the
model of constraint on males by the same statistics as above
(DSD and DRS, P = 0.16 and 0.17). Also for the PC1 of
total coloration, SK fell below the lower 5th percentile for
all models (Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S2)
which, together with the low power of SK to discriminate
models, is best interpreted as a poor fit of the simulations to
the SK of this PC, rather than model discrimination. Overall, restricting the analysis to PC1 scores yielded less significant results than the ones obtained with the more
comprehensive coloration scores, but showed trends in the
same directions. Therefore, using the more comprehensive
coloration scores improved the clarity of results, rather than
causing qualitatively different ones.

Discussion and Conclusions
Male and female coloration were positively correlated
across the genus Carduelis. This simple result (male and
female conspecifics look alike) is enough to indicate that
some mechanism binds the evolution of male and female
coloration, but it does not elucidate which mechanisms are
responsible for this. Using simulations of evolutionary
models for the correlated evolution of male and female phenotypes, we found that for carotenoid coloration this mechanism is asymmetric, affecting female rather than male
evolution. The model of sexual constraint on females was
the only that explained the data on carotenoid coloration of
Carduelis, while the predictions of alternative models were
rejected. For melanin coloration none of the simulated
models was rejected, suggesting that all can potentially
explain its evolution. The correlation between the sexes
was also weaker for melanin coloration suggesting that, relative to the range of variation in melanin coloration, males
and females evolved independently to a greater extent. As a
consequence of these differences in the mode of evolution
of carotenoid and melanin coloration, the result for the total
coloration score, which encompasses both types of coloration, was intermediate between the above. Evolution of
coloration across the genus is the sum of evolutionary
events over time and several lineages, and therefore different mechanisms can concurrently contribute to the similarity between the sexes. Even for carotenoid coloration, for
which the models of constraint on males and mutual constraint were rejected, these mechanisms can have occasional effects. Their contribution to the similarity between
the sexes, however, must be small in comparison with sexual constraint on females.
Elaborate coloration, and carotenoid coloration in particular, is usually sexually selected [1,45], and there is evidence that carotenoid coloration in Carduelis is a signal of
condition and is subject to female preferences [41-43,6062]. Sexual selection can act both in males and females
[4,5,7,8], but in most cases it should be stronger in males
because their variance in mating success is typically larger
[46]. Therefore, for sexually selected traits the phenotypic
optima for males and females often differ [63]. In these situations, classic population genetic models for the evolution
of genetically correlated traits [3,64] predict that the more
strongly selected trait (in this case, male coloration) evolves
largely independently, and that the less strongly selected
trait (in this case, female coloration) evolves in a two-step
process: first due to genetic correlations with the more
strongly selected trait, and eventually towards its adaptive
optimum through acquiring genetic and developmental
independence. Our result for carotenoid coloration in Carduelis agrees with this sexual constraint explanation. This
explanation is also supported by long-standing evidence

many species are vestigial or incomplete, in cases resem-

bling juveniles [2,65], and oestrogen-dependent sexual
dichromatism is common in birds [66], suggesting that the
evolution of elaborate coloration initially affected both
sexes and was later lost in females [67].
Evolution by sexual constraint used to be regarded as
non-adaptive or even maladaptive for females, but this
needs not be so. Sexual constraint can cause maladaptive
evolution [e.g., [68,69]], but it may also lead to the expression of correlated traits that are neutral or even beneficial in
the constrained sex [70,7]. Since female ornaments appear
to be adaptive in many cases [reviewed in [4,5,7,8]], these
latter outcomes should be common. Therefore, our result
does not imply that female carotenoid coloration in Carduelis is maladaptive. It simply indicates that the evolution of
carotenoid coloration and its evolutionary diversification
across this genus were mainly male-driven.
The correlation between the sexes is strong but not perfect, meaning that an amount of independent evolution also
occurred, i.e., the evolution of sexual dichromatism. The
correlation between the sexes was weaker for melanin than
carotenoid coloration. This was unexpected since in passerines sexual dichromatism is mostly due to carotenoid coloration ([44,71,72], but see also [73]), but correlation
coefficients are also affected by the overall range of variation in the traits, which may not be comparable for these
two types of coloration. The lower correlation for melanin
coloration may be due to testosterone modulating the extent
of its expression [74,75], and therefore providing enhanced
independence of development pathways between males and
females. It is possible that overall the amount of independent evolution that occurred was enough to bring female
phenotypes to their adaptive optima. In fact, sexual dichromatism is evolutionarily labile in birds [76,77,22], suggesting that the genetic correlations between the sexes can be
overcome when female coloration is selected to diverge.
We conclude that the evolution of female carotenoid coloration in Carduelis finches, but possibly not of melanin
coloration, was mostly driven by male evolution. Since in
this group carotenoid coloration appears to be sexually
selected in males, the evolution of female carotenoid coloration may be mostly driven by sexual selection on males.
This does not imply that female ornamental coloration is
not functional, because evolution by sexual constraint is not
contrary to the ornaments also being adaptive in females. It
does, however, make it doubtful that, contrary to male ornaments, they qualify as adaptations stricto sensu (traits that
evolved due to their fitness benefits in females).
Ornamental phenotypes, such as the ones studied here,
are not the only class of traits that could evolve by sexual
constraint. Sexual constraint could affect the evolution of
any trait for which phenotypic optima differ between the
sexes (which is often true for traits related with reproduction and life-history) and with strong pleiotropy between
the sexes. As with ornamentation, the evolution of develop-

mental independence between the sexes may be effective in
resolving some of those sexual conflicts [78,79], but sexual
constraint has been suggested to limit the evolution of several non-ornamental traits as well [80], such as body size
(e.g., [81-83]), immune defence [84], or levels of circulating hormones [85]. The importance of sexual constraint in
the evolution of ornamental and non-ornamental traits must
ultimately be settled empirically and, when sexual constraint is predicted to be asymmetrical (i.e. to constrain one
sex more than the other), the comparative method we used
here may provide a useful tool to evaluate this.
