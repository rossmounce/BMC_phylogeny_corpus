Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus isolates have been classified into six main genotypes and a variable
number of subtypes within each genotype, mainly based on phylogenetic analysis. Analyses of the
genetic relationship among genotypes and subtypes are more reliable when complete genome
sequences (or at least the full coding region) are used; however, so far 31 of 80 confirmed or
proposed subtypes have at least one complete genome available. Of these, 20 correspond to
confirmed subtypes of epidemic interest.
Results: We present and analyse the first complete genome sequence of a HCV subtype 1g isolate.
Phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses reveal that HCV-1g is the most divergent subtype among
the HCV-1 confirmed subtypes. Potential genomic recombination events between genotypes or
subtype 1 genomes were ruled out. We demonstrate phylogenetic congruence of previously
deposited partial sequences of HCV-1g with respect to our sequence.
Conclusion: In light of this, we propose changing the current status of its subtype-specific
designation from provisional to confirmed.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a single-stranded positive-sense
RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, is the leading etiologic agent of chronic liver disease. According to
WHO, about 180 million people, an estimated 3% of the
world population, are infected with HCV [1]. Its genome,
which is approximately 9600 nucleotide (nt) long, contains two short untranslated regions at each end (5'UTR

and 3'UTR) and a single ORF of about 9000 nt, known as
polyprotein, encoding three structural (core, E1 and E2)
and seven non-structural proteins (P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A,
NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). Based mainly on phylogenetic
analyses, all HCV isolates are currently grouped into six
genotypes (from 1 to 6) [2], and within each genotype,
closely related isolates cluster in a varying number of subtypes (designated with letters a, b, c and so on) [3]. Provi-

sional designation of subtypes requires rigorous
phylogenetic analysis of sequences from both the core/E1
region and the NS5B region obtained from three or more
different infections. Confirmed designation status is
acquired after intensive phylogenetic analysis including,
at least, one complete genome sequence of the candidate
subtype. Before a new subtype is confirmed, rigorous
recombination and phylogenetic analyses should preclude both recombination events between subtypes and
significant grouping within any of the confirmed subtypes
[3].
Thirteen subtypes of HCV genotype 1 have been described
so far (from 1a to 1m). However, only three subtypes (1a,
1b and 1c), for which the complete genome sequence has
been obtained, have the status of confirmed subtype. The
remaining subtypes (from 1d to 1m), from which only
partial sequences are known, have been denoted as provisional. In addition, a complete genotype 1 sequence from
an Equatorial Guinea isolate with unassigned subtype is
also available [4].

different genotyping assays based on the 5'UTR [15-17] or
on comparing results from these assays with results from
genotyping in-house methods, based on NS5B sequences
[18,19]. Furthermore, a more relevant point has definitively been demonstrated concerning the intrinsic limitations of the 5'UTR. Due to this region's high level of
conservation, its power to reproduce phylogenetic trees
obtained using complete genome is limited, and consequently, it fails to discriminate subtypes or even genotypes [20]. As a result of inefficient genotyping and
subtyping in most commercial assays, the presence of
some subtypes could have been underestimated, or some
of them even ignored, in epidemiological investigations
of circulating HCV variants. An important consequence of
accurate assignation of HCV subtypes based on appropriate sequence data is that it turns routine genotyping into
a reliable tool for molecular epidemiology studies in
which, apart from a clear description of circulating subtypes, putative new subtypes and/or genotypes can be
detected [21].

Results and Discussion
The HCV genotype infecting a patient is important as it
influences dose and duration of current antiviral therapy
(pegylated alpha interferon plus ribavirin); patients
infected with genotype 2 or 3 respond better than those
infected with genotype 1 or 4 [5,6]. Apart from being an
excellent method for reliable genotyping, phylogenetic
and genetic analysis of appropriate sequence data, is an
important tool for epidemiological surveys, including
deep outbreak studies [7], novel transmission risks [8],
viral evolution [9,10] and origin and spread of HCV epidemics [11-14].
In the present study, viral RNA was isolated from a specimen (serum) obtained from a 56-year-old Spanish female
patient, who seroconverted to HCV after undergoing surgery and receiving a blood transfusion in 1996. No other
recognizable risk factor could be identified for acquiring
HCV infection. Serum was obtained before pegylated
alpha interferon plus ribavirin treatment, to which the
patient did not respond. Initially, HCV genotype was
determined by means of two genotyping assays. First, an
assay using the Trugene® 5'NC genotyping kit (TRUGENE
5'NC; Bayer HealthCare) based on the sequencing of a
fragment of the 5'UTR, led to an ambiguous subtype 1a/
1c. Secondly, use of the Abbott Real Time HCVTM kit
(Abbott Diagnostics), which targets the NS5B region for
genotype 1 but only distinguishes subtypes a and b, led to
an unambiguous subtype 1a. Accurate identification as
subtype 1g could only be determined after partial
sequencing of the NS5B gene followed by both sequence
comparison against sequence databases and phylogenetic
analysis. Many authors have pointed out some discordant
subtyping results on comparing the results obtained using

Here we report the first complete genome of a hepatitis C
virus subtype 1g isolate. To demonstrate this we have both
performed phylogenetic analysis with representative complete genomes of all genotypes, including the confirmed
subtypes 1a, 1b and 1c, and also with all of the partial subtype 1g sequences deposited in sequence databanks.
The complete subtype 1g genome (9490 nt) was obtained
by direct sequencing of ten overlapping RT-PCR fragments, and includes the complete coding region and partial sequences from both 5'UTR and 3'UTR. A codonbased nucleotide alignment of the coding region of the
new sequence was used in phylogenetic analyses, along
with 29 representative sequences of all six HCV genotypes.
In order to better represent genotype 1 subtypes, two or
more sequences of subtypes 1a, 1b and 1c, were chosen.
The best evolutionary model for this multiple alignment
was determined according to the procedure implemented
in Modeltest 3.8. This model, GTR+G+I, was used to
obtain the unrooted maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
tree shown in Fig. 1, in which the six well-defined clades
corresponding to the six established genotypes were
found, each containing all their known subtypes. It is
worth noticing, in the tree showed, the significant grouping of genotypes 1 and 4 with a maximum bootstrap support. The close relationship between these two clades is
only recognized in phylogenies using complete genomes
where the nucleotide substitution model that best fits the
data is taken into account [10,22]. Our subtype 1g
sequence groups within the well-supported genotype 1
clade as a separate basal branch, which joins the group
that includes all described HCV-1 subtypes. This indicates

that divergence of subtype 1g occurred before evolutionary divergence of subtypes 1a, 1b and 1c.
Potential recombination events between genotypes or
subtype 1 genomes were investigated following two
approaches and, finally, ruled out. Firstly, phylogenetic
reconstructions using the same representative sequences
as in Fig. 1 were performed separately for the 10 proteincoding genes (from core to NS5B). With respect to the
grouping of HCV-1g within HCV-1 subtypes, all the phylogenetic trees congruently reproduced the same topology
obtained from the complete genome analysis. Moreover,
subtype 1g still retained its basal position with respect to
the other HCV-1 sequences in topologies based on E1, E2,
NS2, NS4A, NS4B and NS5A genes (data not shown). Secondly, potential recombination events using the complete
sequence alignment were investigated using the RDP
3.0b03 software [[23] and references therein]. This program implements several methods to identify of recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoints. All the
recombination analyses based on the complete genome
alignment showed no evidence that our subtype 1g
sequence had participated in recombination events (data
not shown).
The mean genetic distances between genotype 1 subtypes
based on 26 representative sequences of subtypes 1a, 1b,
1c, an unassigned subtype 1 and our subtype 1g sequence
were calculated (Table 1). The appropriate nucleotide substitution model was determined for this genotype 1 limited codon-based nucleotide alignment as described as
above. The four mean genetic distances between the HCV1g sequence and the other subtypes fall within the highest
five of all comparisons. These results, based on complete
genomes, suggest that the genotype 1g sequence is the
most divergent genome with respect to the rest of the
HCV-1 subtypes.

These partial sequences, corresponding to four genomic
regions (5'UTR, core, core/E1 and NS5B), were retrieved
from the HCV sequence database in Los Alamos [24]. In
all four analysed regions, the subtype 1g sequence
described here always grouped within the sequences provisionally designated as subtype 1g. In eight cases, HCV
genome from the same patient (the patient code appears
in parenthesis in the corresponding trees) was partially
sequenced in three different regions: 4 cases from Egypt
(5'UTR, core and NS5B), 3 cases also from Egypt (5'UTR,
core/E1 and NS5B) and 2 cases from Canada (5'UTR,
core/E1 and NS5B). In all cases, we observed phylogenetic
congruence of partial sequences of different regions
obtained from the same specimen with respect to our subtype 1g sequence.
In the analyses of the NS5B region, three short deposited
sequences were not included, because after nucleotide
alignment the overlapping region was too short to be analysed. These three early deposited sequences, then considered subtype 1c and later assigned as subtype 1g, (Z70375,
Z70392 and X88710) were obtained from sera dated
between 1994 and 1995 in Germany [25] and would represent the first subtype 1g isolates detected in Europe.
Although birthplace of these three patients could not be
checked, the authors mentioned that some patients participating in the study had recently emigrated from Egypt
and Sudan. The phylogenetic tree obtained using the
NS5B region also includes 2 sequences from Lebanon
[26], deposited in 1993 as subtype 1c and later assigned
to subtype 1g (in fact, the two first subtype 1g sequences
detected worldwide). The tree also includes one sequence
from a Sudanese individual, detected in a study of unpaid
blood donors in the Netherlands [27]. Interestingly, the
patient in our study was born and resided in Spain, which
is evidence of local transmission of subtype 1g.

Conclusion
Finally, we carried out phylogenetic analyses with our
subtype 1g sequence and all available deposited
sequences provisionally designated as subtype 1g (Fig. 2).

In summary, we have determined the complete genome
sequence of an HCV-1g isolate, we have verified its grouping within HCV-1 and differentiation from other subtypes

of this group by rigorous phylogenetic analyses, we have
verified that this genome does not result from recombination events and that it is the most basal subtype among
those belonging to HCV-1 for which a complete genome
sequence is currently available. Taking this into account,
we propose changing the status of subtype 1g from proposed to confirmed subtype.

Methods
Viral purification, RT-PCR and sequencing
Viral RNA was extracted from 200 μl of serum using High
Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). Retrotranscription of viral
RNA was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing
10 μl of eluted RNA, 4 μl retrotranscription buffer, 500
μM of each dNTP, either 0.5 μg of random hexadeoxynucleotides (Promega) or 1 μM antigenomic sense primer,
100 U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 20
U of rRNasin® Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega). The
mixture was incubated at 42°C for 60 min, followed by 3
min at 95°C. Table showed in additional file 1, lists the
oligonucleotide primers used to obtain and/or sequence
the overlapping RT-PCR products, which covered almost
the whole genome. Primers denoted with "g" or "a" indicate genomic or antigenomic sense, respectively. Primers
named with "h" refer to primers used in first round PCR
followed by a hemi-nested PCR. Sequence primers named
with "R" were directly designed from our sequence of subtype 1g. The genome was covered by 10 overlapping fragments using primer pairs: H28g-COA1a, COS2g-E1E2a,
E1E2A2g-NS1a, NS1g2R-NS3a3, NS3g2R-305a2R, 1503g577a, 5600gR-NS5a2R, KUg2-NS5B1a, NS5B1g-1279a,
1327gR-3utra2. When necessary, additional PCR fragments were also obtained by using combinations of the
primers listed in additional file 1.

First round and hemi-nested amplifications were performed in a 50 μl volume containing either 5 μl of the RT
product (in the case of first round PCR) or 1 μl of the first
round PCR product (in the case of hemi-nested PCR), 5 μl
of 10× PCR buffer, 100 μM of each dNTP, 200 nM of the
genomic sense primer, 200 nM of the antigenomic sense
primer and 5 U of Taq DNA Polymerase (Amersham). All
PCRs were performed in a GeneAmp® PCR system 2700
(Applied Biosystems) thermal cycler with the following
profile: 95°C for 2 min, then 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec,
50–65°C (depending on the primers used) for 30 sec and
72°C for 3 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
Amplified products were purified with High Pure PCR
Products Purification Kit (Roche). These purified DNAs
were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v 3.1 in a 3700 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing primers are also listed in additional file 1. Chromatogram files
were assembled, verified and edited using the Staden
Package [28]. The newly characterised sequence has been
deposited in EMBL with accession number AM910652.
Phylogenetic reconstructions and genetic distances
Two sets of nucleotide sequences were analysed: one corresponding to the complete polyprotein (Fig. 1) and the
other corresponding to all sequences provisionally
designed as subtype 1g and deposited at the HCV
sequence database in Los Alamos [24] (Fig. 2). In the first
set, the nucleotide sequence coding for the polyprotein
(Fig. 1) was included in phylogenetic reconstructions
along with 29 homologous complete genome sequences
representative of the main HCV genotypes and subtypes
(see accession numbers, genotypes and subtypes in Fig.

1). Selected sequences fulfil the condition of containing
less than 15 ambiguities. In the second set, partial
sequences belonging to four regions of HCV genome
(5'UTR, core, core/E1 and NS5B) were analysed separately
along with the corresponding homologous fragment of
our subtype 1g complete genome. Alignments of partial
sequences of HCV-1g used in phylogenetic reconstructions included (number of nucleotides in parenthesis):
nine 5'UTR sequences (186 nt), four core sequences (217
nt), eighteen core/E1 sequences (220 nt) and thirteen
NS5B sequences (222 nt). (see accession numbers, specimen name, and subtypes in Fig. 2). In addition, representative sequences used in the complete genome analysis for
subtypes 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a (Fig. 1) and referred as outgroup were also included in the phylogenetic analyses.
ClustalW [29] implemented in MEGA version 4 [30] was
used to obtain a multiple alignment of the corresponding
amino acid sequences from which a codon-based nucleotide alignment was derived, except for the 5'UTR alignment. All phylogenetic trees were constructed by
maximum likelihood in PHYML with the nucleotide substitution model that best fit the data according to Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) [31] for which we used the
procedure implemented in Modeltest 3.8 [32]. The
robustness of the tree topology was assessed by bootstrap
analysis with 1000 replicates implemented in PHYML
[33].
Estimates of mean distances between subtypes of HCV
genotype 1 and between these and the new subtype 1g
sequence were obtained with the maximum likelihood
distance (see above) with PAUP*4.0b10 [34]. For this, we
used 26 complete genomes from EMBL: our sequence for
subtype 1g [EMBL: AM910652], ten sequences representing subtype 1a [EMBL: D10749, EMBL: M62321, EMBL:
M67463, EMBL: AF009606, EMBL: AF011751, EMBL:
AF011752, EMBL: AF290978, EMBL: AF271632, EMBL:
AJ278830, EMBL: EU155214], twelve sequences for subtype 1b [EMBL: D11168, EMBL: D14484, EMBL: D45172,
EMBL: L02836, EMBL: AB080299, EMBL: AB016785,

EMBL: AF333324, EMBL: AJ000009, EMBL: AY045702),
two sequences for subtype 1c [EMBL: D14853, EMBL:
AY051292] and one sequence that corresponds to an
unassigned subtype 1 [EMBL: AJ851228].
