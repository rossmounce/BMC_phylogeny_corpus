Abstract
Background: The lack of reference sequences from well-identified mycorrhizal fungi often poses
a challenge to the inference of taxonomic affiliation of sequences from environmental samples, and
many environmental sequences are thus left unidentified. Such unidentified sequences belonging to
the widely distributed ectomycorrhizal fungal genus Inocybe (Basidiomycota) were retrieved from
GenBank and divided into species that were identified in a phylogenetic context using a reference
dataset from an ongoing study of the genus. The sequence metadata of the unidentified Inocybe
sequences stored in GenBank, as well as data from the corresponding original papers, were
compiled and used to explore the ecology and distribution of the genus. In addition, the relative
occurrence of Inocybe was contrasted to that of other mycorrhizal genera.
Results: Most species of Inocybe were found to have less than 3% intraspecific variability in the ITS2
region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. This cut-off value was used jointly with phylogenetic analysis
to delimit and identify unidentified Inocybe sequences to species level. A total of 177 unidentified
Inocybe ITS sequences corresponding to 98 species were recovered, 32% of which were
successfully identified to species level in this study. These sequences account for an unexpectedly
large proportion of the publicly available unidentified fungal ITS sequences when compared with
other mycorrhizal genera. Eight Inocybe species were reported from multiple hosts and some even
from hosts forming arbutoid or orchid mycorrhizae. Furthermore, Inocybe sequences have been
reported from four continents and in climate zones ranging from cold temperate to equatorial
climate. Out of the 19 species found in more than one study, six were found in both Europe and
North America and one was found in both Europe and Japan, indicating that at least many north
temperate species have a wide distribution.
Conclusion: Although DNA-based species identification and circumscription are associated with
practical and conceptual difficulties, they also offer new possibilities and avenues for research.
Metadata assembly holds great potential to synthesize valuable information from community
studies for use in a species and taxonomy-oriented framework.

Background
The taxonomy of fungi is largely based on ephemeral and
irregularly occurring propagation structures, notably sexual fruiting-bodies. The main part of the fungal life cycle
is, however, a somatic – typically mycelial – phase that
offers few discriminatory morphological characters and
that may be difficult to assign even to family or ordinal
level. This means that alternatives to morphological characters are essential to get a complete picture of the fungal
diversity and ecology at any given locality and time.
Indeed, DNA-based methods have been in long use for
identification purposes in mycology [1].
The locus most commonly used for identification of fungi
is the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA [2,3]. This
region has three subloci of different rates of evolution,
ITS1: highly variable, 5.8S: very conserved, and ITS2: variable to semi-conserved [4,5]. It is flanked on both sides
by comparatively conserved regions (SSU [18S] and LSU
[28S], respectively) which simplifies the design of primers
targeted at the ITS region. Another important aspect of the
ribosomal DNA is that it is a multi-copy segment such that
it amplifies readily even when the initial amount of template DNA is moderate, as is often the case with environmental samples.
A branch of mycology where sequence-based methods are
in common use is ectomycorrhizal community research.
Ectomycorrhizae are ecologically important root-associated symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi
where the fungus obtains carbohydrates for its energy supply and the plant, among other benefits, receives nitrogen
and phosphorous for its metabolism [6]. Since ectomycorrhizae normally can be observed as a hyphal cap by visual inspection of the plant roots, it is possible to sort out
ectomycorrhizal root tips from soil samples and extract
DNA for sequencing [2]. The sequence obtained is then
typically used in a similarity search against reference databases such as GenBank [7] or UNITE [8] in the hope of
finding a close match for inference of taxonomic affiliation. Given that less than 1% of all fungal species have
been sequenced for the ITS region [9], the similarity
search often fails to produce a match close enough for reliable species identification. As a part of the scientific publication process, such unidentified sequences are
normally submitted to GenBank without a full species
name. If put in the right context, these unidentified
sequences may represent valuable samples of fungal diversity and ecology. Interestingly, however, unidentified
sequences and their potential to contribute metadata and
resolution are typically left out from phylogenetic studies
[10].
One of the larger ectomycorrhizal genera is Inocybe (Fr.)
Fr. (Agaricales, Basidiomycota; Figure 1) which comprises

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/50

some 500 species [11] distributed world-wide. There are
several morphology-based monographs of the genus
[12,13], although most of these have a European focus
(but see [14,15]). In addition, many new species have
been described recently [16-20]. A search on Inocybe in the
taxonomic database Index Fungorum [21] returns 1634
names (of species and subspecies; November 2007), but
the actual number of recognized taxa is far lower owing to
widespread synonymy. The fact that much of the taxonomy within the genus remains unclear [13,15,22] has
been accentuated further by recent DNA-based analyses,
which have shown that many of the commonly recognized taxa in the genus are incompletely understood
[23,24]. In spite of the fact that Inocybe is a species rich,
widely distributed, and commonly encountered genus,
there were only 31 fully identified Inocybe ITS sequences
deposited in GenBank at the onset of this study. The size
and distribution of the genus coupled with the lack of
fully identified Inocybe reference sequences jointly suggest
that a substantial number of the unidentified ITS
sequences in GenBank could belong to the genus.
This study seeks to mine GenBank for hitherto unexplored
ecological and geographical data pertaining to Inocybe. To
accomplish this, fully identified ITS sequences from an
ongoing study of Inocybe are used together with fully identified Inocybe ITS sequences in GenBank to pinpoint unidentified GenBank sequences associated with the genus.
The unidentified GenBank sequences are divided into
groups – putative species – and identified as far as possible by sequence similarity analysis and phylogenetic inference. Information stored in GenBank about the
unidentified sequences, as well as data from the papers in
which they were published, are then compiled and analysed. For purposes of comparison, the number of unidentified ITS sequences associated with a selection of other
ectomycorrhizal genera is estimated using fully identified
GenBank sequences.

Results
Comparison of ectomycorrhizal genera
When comparing a selection of widespread ectomycorrhizal fungal genera it was found that Tomentella Pat., Cortinarius Fr., and Russula Pers. are the most commonly
encountered as viewed through the number of studies that
had unidentified sequences from the respective genera as
their closest BLAST match (Table 1). Of these, Cortinarius
and Russula are also two of the most abundantly available
genera in terms of fully identified sequences in GenBank
while Tomentella was found to be among the more poorly
represented. Additionally, one of the most commonly
occurring genera as unidentified sequences, Sebacina Tul.,
is among the least well represented with respect to fully
identified sequences. Notably high numbers of fully identified sequences are available for Tuber Wigg.: Fr. and Tri-

Hygrophorus Fr.).
Alignment groups
A joint 5.8S and LSU alignment of the fully identified Inocybe sequences was compiled to form the basis of a division of the sequences into smaller groups. A total of 18
sequences were omitted from this alignment due to insufficient sequence length. Sixteen clades from the parsimony consensus tree inferred were selected as groups for
the construction of ITS alignments. Eleven sequences fell
outside these clades and were included in the ITS alignment that featured their closest BLAST match. Five

sequences that did not end up with other sequences bearing the same species annotation were additionally
assigned to the alignments where sequences with the
same species name were present; these five sequences
were therefore found in more than one alignment. This
resulted in 16 alignments with 4–41 fully identified
sequences. Of the 181 unidentified GenBank sequences
with an Inocybe as the closest BLAST match, four were
excluded from further analysis due to ambiguous establishment of homology in the alignment stage and the
likely connection to other genera after further investigation of the BLAST output. The remaining 177 sequences
were added to the alignment featuring their closest BLAST
match. After the unidentified sequences and outgroup

taxa had been added, the 16 alignments comprised 8–71
sequences (Additional file 1, TreeBase study accession no.
S1968).
ITS similarity
Sixteen species of Inocybe (I. acutella, I. alpigenes, I. asterospora, I. cervicolor, I. cookei, I. dulcamara, I. flocculosa, I.
fraudans, I. fuscidula, I. glabripes, I. lacera, I. lanuginosa, I.
maculata, I. muricellata, I. nitidiuscula, and I. rimosa) were
found to have outlier sequences that differed considerably
in sequence similarity from, and were not monophyletic
with, the majority of the sequences annotated as their
conspecifics. These deviant sequences (but not the majority of the sequences with the same species annotation)
were excluded from the analysis of intra- and interspecific
similarity. Some species, such as I. flavella, I. geophylla, I.
soluta, and I. squamata, were not monophyletic in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) and were therefore excluded
from the intra- and interspecific similarity analysis. Due to
the low resolution within the clade including I. geophylla,
I. posterula, and I. whitei (Figure 1A–C; Figure 2C), these
taxa were treated together as I. geophylla s. l. Several species
show considerable variation in the ITS2 region (<90%
intraspecies sequence similarity) even within monophyletic groups. These include I. asterospora, I. calamistrata,
I. cervicolor, I. cookei, I. glabripes, I. godeyi, I. hirtella, I. maculata, I. mixtilis, I. phaeocomis, I. rimosa, and I. whitei. For I.
calamistrata, I. cookei, I. godeyi, and I. maculata, the minimum interspecific sequence similarity was smaller than
the maximum intraspecific sequence similarity. The ITS1
region was found to be more variable than ITS2 in 49% of
the Inocybe species while the ITS2 region was more variable in 31%. For 6% of the species it was not consistent
which region that had the highest sequence similarity
between different sequence pairs within the species. In
14% of the species both regions were fully conserved
(100% sequence similarity).

The inter- and intraspecific comparison (Figure 3) of
sequence similarity in ITS2 indicates that a cut-off value of
about 97% would give the most reasonable error rates for
species delimitation in Inocybe: 71% of the species had an
intraspecific sequence similarity larger than 97%, and
98% of the species had an interspecific similarity lower
than 97%. This fits well with previously used cut-off values in mycology [26]. There were two cases where unidentified sequences from the same study formed clades with
full jackknife support but without internal resolution in
the phylogenetic analysis and where the sequence similarities were between 96% and 97%. Since it seems likely
that these belong to the same species and the effect on the
error estimates would be small, a 96% cut-off value was
used instead of 97%. This had no effect on the identity of
the remaining unidentified sequences.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/50

The ITS1 region indicated the same sequence groups as
ITS2 except for one of the unidentified sequences [GenBank:AY970244] that showed affinities to different
sequence groups for the two different regions.
Species identification
Of the 177 unidentified GenBank sequences with an association to Inocybe, 56 (32%) were identified to species
level in this study, 21 (12%) were identified as having a
close affinity to a fully identified Inocybe species (corresponding to the denotation aff.), and 100 sequences
(56%) remains unidentified (annotated as sp. or cf.; Additional file 2). The 31 fully identified Inocybe sequences
originally in GenBank constitute 16 (9%) of the closest
BLAST matches after the addition of the new Inocybe
sequences. The unidentified sequences of Inocybe were
determined to belong to 98 different species. The study
with the largest number of Inocybe species, as circumscribed from unidentified sequences here, featured 13
species and was conducted in a meadow ecosystem on calcareous soil in western Estonia [27].

Ninety-four (53%) of the 177 unidentified GenBank
sequences assigned to Inocybe in this study were from a
published study that assigned an identity to the sequence.
Of these 94 sequences, eight (9%) were determined to
species level in the study they were presented, 49 (52%)
were identified as Inocybe, 12 (13%) as Cortinariaceae, and
22 (23%) at an even higher taxonomic level (or as completely unidentified). There were also three sequences
(3%) that had been classified to taxonomic ranks that do
not include Inocybe.
There was a marked skewness in the distribution of unidentified ITS sequences among the Inocybe clades given in
[23] (Figure 4), with the vast majority (156/177) of the
sequences belonging to the Inocybe clade, only one to the
Mallocybe clade (subgenus Mallocybe Kuyp.), and none to
the Inosperma clade 1 (section Cervicolores). Two sequences
were found to have potential affinities to the Inosperma
clade and one to the Pseudosperma clade but could not be
confidently included in these and were therefore excluded
from the analysis.
Geography and ecology
The majority of studies in which Inocybe has been reported
was conducted in Europe and North America (Figure 5).
Four studies could not be confidently geographically
assigned to a continent and were therefore excluded from
all analyses regarding geography and climate, and an
additional five studies could not be confidently assigned
to a climatic region and were therefore excluded from all
climatological analysis. A disproportionately large
number of the unidentified sequences that were successfully identified in this study came from Europe: 49% of

the European sequences were identified to species level

25%. For Asia and Australia the values were 14% and 0%
respectively, but both areas were represented by fewer
than ten sequences. When comparing the Köppen-Geiger
climate regions [28] that were represented by more than
one study containing Inocybe sequences, 50% of the uni-

dentified sequences in fully humid snow climate (cold
temperate; Df) were identified to species level here; for
fully humid warm temperate climate (Cf), 30% were identified; and for warm temperate climate with dry summers
(Mediterranean climate; Cs), 32% were identified (Table
2; Figure 5).

interval and are based on 105 species for the interspecific similarity (white bars) and 53 species for the intraspecific similarity

Only 19 (19%) of the species delimited from unidentified
GenBank sequences were found in two or more studies.
The species found most often was I. glabripes which
occurred in five studies, although two of those were conducted in the same forest. Five species (I. glabripes, I. lanuginosa, I. maculata, I. rimosa, and I. sp. 31 [Additional file 2])
were found in both Europe and North America (six if
counting one species [I. jacobi, Figure 1D] whose location
was inferred from the title of the study given in GenBank
[Additional file 2]) and one species was found both in
Europe and Japan (I. sp. 2 [Additional file 2]). In addition,
eight (nine, as previous) of the species that were identified
to species level in this study were collected outside Europe
(where at least one of the fully identified sequences they
group with originated from).
A total of 51 species were found in hardwood forests, 24
in coniferous forests, and 14 in mixed forests. Two of
these species were found in both hardwood and coniferous forests, two in both hardwood and mixed forests, and
five in both coniferous and mixed forests. The host was
given either in GenBank or in the paper from which the
sequence originated for 70 (40%) of the sequences representing 52 species. Eight of those species were found on
more than one host genus. Among the more noteworthy
hosts are Arbutus unedo and Orthilia secunda (Ericaceae),
which form arbutoid mycorrhizae, and species of
Cephalanthera and Epipactis (Orchidaceae), which exhibit
orchid mycorrhizae [6,29]. Oddly, one Inocybe sequence
comes from a study of the total mycoflora of the grass
Phragmites australis (Poaceae) [30]. The rest of the hosts
were known ectomycorrhizae formers (Additional file 2).

Three species were reported from ecological conditions
differing from those in the literature: I. lanuginosa, I. leptophylla, and I. phaeocomis (Additional file 2).

Discussion
Inocybe is one of the larger genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi
and its species are consequently found in many studies of
ectomycorrhizal communities. The comparison between
the genera in this study is based on the closest BLAST
matches for the unidentified sequences, an approach that
although associated with complications [10] serves as a
crude quantification of the frequencies at which the genera occur. The number of fully identified ITS sequences
annotated as Inocybe in GenBank was similar to those of
the likewise ectomycorrhizal genera Hygrophorus and
Albatrellus Gray that form the closest BLAST matches of
unidentified sequences from much fewer studies. As many
as 58% of the sequences found to be associated with Inocybe were not denoted as such in the study in which they
were originally published, which indicates that the lack of
reference sequences of Inocybe has severely impeded identification to genus level.
The observation that seven (37%) of the 19 species recovered in more than one study were found on different continents suggests that at least many of the north temperate
Inocybe species are widely distributed. This finding notwithstanding, it is clear that the restricted geographical
area from which the fully identified sequences were collected has had an impact on the number of unidentified
sequences being identified to species level. In this study,
fully identified sequences belonging to 116 different Inoc-

ybe species were included, a set that represents about 20%
of the estimated number of described species in the genus.
If this was a representative taxonomic sample for the
world it should be a reasonable basis for species identification, but when comparing different geographical
regions it was only in fully humid temperate and snowy
(cold temperate) parts of Europe that a significant proportion of the unidentified sequences was successfully identified in this study. With respect to sequences from Australia
and Thailand, none of the unidentified sequences were
identified to species level in this study, indicating a geographic skewness in the taxonomic sampling.
Since there is a general bias in the geographic distribution
of ectomycorrhizal studies towards Europe and North
America [31], it is hard to draw precise conclusions on the

distribution of Inocybe. It is nevertheless clear from the
results that the genus is widely distributed and can be
found in many climatic regions, from fully humid snow
(cold temperate) climate to equatorial savannah. It furthermore appears that Inocybe can form mycorrhizal associations with various diverse hosts and not only of the
ectomycorrhizal type but also arbutoid and orchid mycorrhizae [6]. In addition, many species were found to form
mycorrhizae with more than one host genus, which
expands on what has previously been reported for Inocybe
[12]. The study in which an Inocybe sequence was recovered from a tissue sample of the grass Phragmites australis
[30], a species that forms arbuscular mycorrhizae [29],
was designed to investigate general fungal associates with
the plant and not specifically mycorrhizal associations.

with Ammophila arenaria [12], another arbuscular mycorrhizal member of Poacea [29]. Since arbuscular mycorrhizae is restricted to the phylum Glomeromycota among
the fungi [6], it seems unlikely that the association
between Inocybe (Basidiomycota) and these grasses is mycorrhizal. This might suggest that the Inocybe species in
question may have colonized the host for other reasons
(or were accidentally amplified from the surrounding
matrix) such that not all species of Inocybe are obligately
mycorrhizal.
Most of the unidentified ITS sequences with an affiliation
to Inocybe were found to be associated with the Inocybe
clade (subgenus Inocybe; Figure 4). This is not surprising
since this is the largest clade within the genus in terms of
the number of species [13]. The observation that only one
sequence was associated with the Mallocybe clade (subgenus Mallocybe) and none with the Inosperma clade 1 (section Cervicolores; Figure 4) might be due to a bias in what
kind of ecosystems that have been sampled combined
with random sampling effects, but it could also be interpreted as an indication of a different nutritional mode for
the species of these clades.
Species identification using DNA sequences from only
one locus has been cautioned against for several reasons
[32,33]. In this study we grouped sequences based on a
dual demand of sufficient sequence similarity and monophyly in a phylogenetic context. Such groups might be
more correctly referred to as molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs [34]) and it remains to be shown
how well they correspond to actual species and whether
discrepancies between these units will have an impact on

our results. If a species is represented by only one or a few
sequences (and that is often the case), species determination and delimitation may have to rely on similarity
threshold values, a process that while known not always
to be reliable [35,36] has been shown to be useful in some
groups of fungi [37,38]. In this study, threshold values
were inferred from the sequence similarity among the
fully identified sequences, but the variation in inter- and
intraspecific similarity among the species was found to be
large and at times overlapping, resulting in similarity
thresholds that are a compromise between over- and
underestimating the number of species. Some of this variation in sequence similarity might be explained by insufficient taxonomic resolution such that one species name is
applied to what is actually several species, consequently
with an overestimation of the intraspecific variability as a
result.
In I. rimosa and I. maculata, the low sequence similarity is
accompanied by a large variability in morphology and
uncertain taxonomy. Inocybe rimosa is known to be a taxonomically difficult species with different opinions on species delimitation [12]. This study also reveals that there is
large ecological variation, including associations with several hosts, among the collections of I. rimosa, which
emphasizes the need for more data to settle the taxonomy
within this complex. For I. maculata, Kuyper [12] reports a
great variation in colour, and there are also some species
with purportedly close affinities to I. maculata that have
not been considered in this study (e.g., I. fastigiella and I.
lanatodisca). The three species I. phaecomis, I. hirtella, and
I. cookei are each divided into varietal taxa reflecting a
marked morphological diversity that has only partly been

accounted for in the present study. For other species, the
variation in sequences is harder to correlate to morphological diversity.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/50

species is poor. The low sequence similarities among the
different clades implore further taxonomic studies.

Conclusion
The multiple copies of the nuclear ribosomal DNA
undergo concerted evolution that serves to homogenize
the array of copies. Sequence similarity measures based on
the ITS region are complicated by the fact that there may
still be several distinct and mutually heterogeneous copies
of the region in one genotype [39], adding to the sequence
variation observed within a taxon. Another possible
source of variation in sequence similarity is sequencing
errors [40], but since primary data (raw sequences) rarely
are easily available in the public databases, it is hard to
judge the quality of a sequence and thus the extent of this
problem. In this study we found one sequence that associated with different sequence groups depending on
which of the ITS subregions that were considered. This
could be explained if the sequence represents an in situ
hybridization between two ITS types or if the sequence is
chimeric [39].
Another pitfall in single-locus sequence-based species
identification is that species do not always appear to form
monophyletic groups in phylogenetic analyses [41] (and
do not always have the highest sequence similarity with
conspecific sequences). There might be several explanations for this, such as poorly resolved phylogenetic estimates, inadequate taxonomy, and incomplete lineage
sorting [42,43]. There were several cases in the present
study where sequences with identical species annotation
were found not to form monophyletic groups, and some
sequences fell well inside the clades of other species. Most
of these cases are probably due to misidentification, and
in a few instances it is plausible that the same name is
used for different species in different parts of the world
[44]. This points to the importance of voucher specimens
so that such disagreements can be emended [45]. There
are some instances, however, where other explanations
are conceivable. Inocybe boltonii and I. aff. boltonii render I.
soluta paraphyletic and divided into two clades. The nodes
between the clades within this complex are well supported and additional information from morphological
studies or other loci is needed to resolve the reason for this
non-monophyly. Specimens annotated as I. flavella and I.
squamata (Figure 1E,F) form a clade where each species is
divided into more than one separate clade. Although the
phylogenetic relationships are not fully resolved for these
taxa, it is clear that at least I. squamata is non-monophyletic. This could be explained by incomplete lineage
sorting, hybridisation/introgression, or inadequate taxonomic resolution [41,46]. Another complex of species,
referred to as I. geophylla s. l. here, was circumscribed to
include several taxa. Two of these taxa do not form monophyletic groups, but the resolution within this complex of

As more and more sequences are made available from
environmental samples, this new and previously unexplored data can be used by systematists as an information
resource on the ecology and distribution of different taxa.
These sequences also represent a valuable sample of
intraspecific diversity and might furthermore present
clues on where to look for previously undescribed species,
but in the end it is the standard and level of detail of the
metadata for each sequence that will determine the ease
and extent to which this information can be utilized. As
this study shows, it is vital to provide rich and consistent
sequence metadata even if the sequences are not identified to species level, and much would be gained if all
sequence entries in GenBank were thus annotated.

Methods
A number of sequences from fruiting-bodies identified on
morphological basis were made available for use in this
study from an ongoing phylogenetic investigation of Inocybe in northern Europe (Larsson et al., unpublished). The
regions used were the ITS and LSU of the nuclear ribosomal DNA [4]. A set of 294 sequences of Inocybe was
selected from this study to represent 109 species and all
subgenera sensu [12,13] and all the major clades from
[23] except the Auritella clade (Additional file 2). Two outgroup taxa were chosen from the closely related genera
Crepidotus (Fr.) Kumm. and Naucoria (Fr.) Kumm.
[24,47]. Names are given according to Kuyper [12] and
Stangl [13] as far as applicable; I. obsoleta and I. perlata are,
however, recognized as separate species.
Integration in emerencia
A local installation of emerencia 1.0 [9] was used to download all fungal ITS sequences from GenBank and to divide
these into fully identified (45 909 sequences, of which 31
were annotated as Inocybe) and unidentified (21 738
sequences) with respect to species level annotations. The
sequences were stored in a MySQL 4.1.11 database. Of the
294 sequences added in this study, 262 (109 species) were
included in the table for fully identified sequences and 32,
denoted as cf. or sp., were included in the table for unidentified sequences (Additional file 2).

Since dubiously annotated sequences constitute a challenge for users of GenBank [48], all fully identified
sequences were compared for similarity against each other
using BLAST 2.2.9 [49] not to miss any Inocybe sequences
bearing other generic names. The five closest BLAST
matches of all fully identified sequences were scrutinized
to determine whether any of the newly added Inocybe
sequences were among them. emerencia was then evoked

Page 11 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:50

to BLAST all unidentified sequences against all fully identified sequences. The table for unidentified sequences was
queried for sequences that had a fully identified sequence
belonging to Inocybe (including sequences annotated as
Mallocybe) as their closest BLAST match. For purposes of
comparison, this was done both before and after the addition of the Inocybe sequences released through this study
and also for several other common mycorrhizal genera
using fully identified sequences from GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis
To facilitate species identification of the unidentified
sequences, evolutionary relationships among the
sequences were investigated using phylogenetic analysis
[50]. Since ITS cannot be satisfactory aligned over all Inocybe species, smaller groups had to be constructed to enable estimation of phylogenies based on this region. To
compile suitable alignment groups, the Inocybe sequences
classified as fully identified (according to the criteria in
emerencia) were aligned using Clustal W 1.83 [51]. The
ITS1 and ITS2 regions were excluded such that only the
5.8S (156 bp.) and the 5' end of LSU (1362 bp.) were
included. Sequences with less than 200 bp. of data were
excluded. PAUP* 4.0b10 [52] was employed for the parsimony phylogenetic analyses using 25 000 random addition repeats holding one tree per replicate and TBR branch
swapping with at most five trees saved per replicate. The
resulting trees were summarized in a consensus tree to
find clades of sequences consistent with all most parsimonious trees. Based on these clades and considering the
major clades of [23], groups consisting of a maximum of
50 sequences were selected as basis for the compilation of
ITS alignments. Sequences falling outside these groups, as
well as sequences excluded due to lack of sufficient
sequence data in the 5.8S and LSU regions, were placed in
the group where they found their closest BLAST match. If
they were found to have conspecific sequences (as determined through their species annotation) in another
group, they were included in that alignment as well. The
groups were then aligned in Clustal W and adjusted manually in SeaView 1.0 [53].

The unidentified ITS sequences that found an Inocybe
sequence as their closest BLAST match were aligned to the
ITS alignment that featured that matching sequence using
Clustal W. Naucoria submelinoides, Crepidotus mollis, and I.
dulcamara were used as outgroups for all but one alignment corresponding to the subgenus Mallocybe [12] in
which I. dulcamara was included in the ingroup [23]. The
alignments were analysed under the parsimony criterion
in PAUP* using 1 000 random addition repeats holding
two trees per replicate and TBR branch swapping with at
most 30 trees saved per replicate. For alignments with
fewer than 22 sequences, the exact branch and bound
search option was used instead. The MAXTREES option

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/50

was set to 30 000. The resulting trees were summarized in
a strict consensus tree. Branch support was estimated
through 1 000 jackknife replicates with the JAC resample
method, independently deleting 37% of the characters in
each step [54]; the heuristic search settings for the jackknife analysis were set to 100 random addition replicates
holding one tree per replicate and TBR branch swapping
with at most five trees saved per replicate. For alignments
with fewer than 20 sequences, branch and bound was
used. Alignments and trees were deposited in TreeBASE.
Sequence similarity
Sequence similarities (expressed as Hamming distances
[55]) were obtained from pairwise alignments generated
by Clustal W. Leading and trailing gapped parts of the
alignments were excluded from the comparison, and the
similarities were calculated in Perl.

All fully identified Inocybe sequences and unidentified
sequences with an Inocybe sequence as their closest BLAST
match were compared for similarity in ITS2, and similar
sequences were then grouped together using single link
clustering [56] using several different cut-off values. To
estimate the error of false lumping of species for different
cut-off values, the minimum interspecific pairwise
sequence similarity in ITS2 was computed for all fully
identified species. Likewise the maximum intraspecific
similarities were computed for all fully identified species
represented by more than one sequence to estimate the
error of false splitting of species. Sequences not forming
monophyletic groups with respect to the species annotation were omitted from these error estimations.
The sequence similarity for the ITS1 and ITS2 regions was
computed among the sequences in each of the ITS alignments. The patterns of similarity in ITS1 were then compared with those of ITS2. Sequences with less than 100 bp.
in any of the investigated regions were omitted from all
the similarity analyses.
Taxonomic affiliation of the sequences
The taxonomic affiliation of the unidentified sequences
was inferred considering both the phylogenetic trees and
the similarity clusters. If an unidentified sequence was
assigned to a clade of homogeneously named, fully identified sequences with significant jackknife support
(≥70%), it was assigned to that species. When comparing
the different cluster analyses, the estimated error rates
were used to choose what cut-off value to apply. If a
sequence appeared in a cluster with homogeneously
named, fully identified sequences, it was assigned to that
species if this was not contradicted by the phylogenetic
analyses. Similarly to the analysis of intra- and interspecific sequence similarity, all fully identified sequences not
forming monophyletic groups with respect to their species

Page 12 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:50

annotation were excluded when inferring taxonomic affiliation of the unidentified sequences. Unidentified
sequences appearing in the same cluster were considered
to be the same species if this was not contradicted by the
phylogenetic analysis. If an unidentified sequence
appeared as sister taxon to a fully identified species in the
phylogenetic analysis and had at least 80% sequence similarity in ITS2, it was denoted as aff. of that species (e.g. I.
aff. boltonii). Unidentified sequences that were deemed to
belong to the same species (according to the criteria
above) as partly identified sequences annotated as Inocybe
cf. and a species epithet were also annotated as I. cf. and
that species epithet (e.g. I. cf. fuscidula). Sequences annotated as cf. or aff. were treated as unidentified.
Ecology and geography
Information about the ecology of the unidentified
sequences was compiled from the papers in which they
were published and from the respective annotations in
GenBank. To determine in what climatic region each
study was conducted, the locations of the studies that
could be geographically assessed were plotted on a map of
the Köppen-Geiger climate classification [28]. This information was then compared with [12,13,57].
