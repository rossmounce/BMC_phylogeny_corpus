Abstract
Background: Hybridization and polyploidy are potent forces that have regularly stimulated plant evolution and
adaptation. Dactylorhiza majalis s.s., D. traunsteineri s.l. and D. ebudensis are three allopolyploid species of a
polyploid complex formed through unidirectional (and, in the first two cases, recurrent) hybridization between the
widespread diploids D. fuchsii and D. incarnata. Differing considerably in geographical extent and ecological
tolerance, the three allopolyploids together provide a useful system to explore genomic responses to
allopolyploidization and reveal their role in adaptation to contrasting environments.
Results: Analyses of cDNA-AFLPs show a significant increase in the range of gene expression of these allopolyploid
lineages, demonstrating higher potential for phenotypic plasticity than is shown by either parent. Moreover,
allopolyploid individuals express significantly more gene variants (including novel alleles) than their parents,
providing clear evidence of increased biological complexity following allopolyploidization. More genetic mutations
seem to have accumulated in the older D. majalis compared with the younger D. traunsteineri since their
respective formation.
Conclusions: Multiple origins of the polyploids contribute to differential patterns of gene expression with a
distinct geographic structure. However, several transcripts conserved within each allopolyploid taxon differ
between taxa, indicating that habitat preferences shape similar expression patterns in these independently formed
tetraploids. Statistical signals separate several transcripts - some of them novel in allopolyploids - that appear
correlated with adaptive traits and seem to play a role favouring the persistence of individuals in their native
environments. In addition to stabilizing the allopolyploid genome, genetic and epigenetic alterations are key
determinants of adaptive success of the new polyploid species after recurrent allopolyploidization events,
potentially triggering reproductive isolation between the resulting lineages.

Background
Recent genomic investigations have uncovered signals of
past whole-genome duplications (WGD) across angiosperms, indicating that polyploidy is a common mechanism of genome evolution in flowering plants [1,2]. Over
time, polyploids undergo diploidization, eventually
behaving like diploids both genetically and cytogenetically, but they retain vestiges of their WGD heritage.
The prevalence of WGD across the history of flowering

plants suggests that angiosperm evolution proceeds in
cycles of genome doubling and subsequent diploidization [2], which have inevitably influenced their evolutionary lineage. WGD may even have been a pivotal
evolutionary force during the origin and diversification
of angiosperms; by extending functional capacities [3]
and creating evolutionary innovation, these WGD events
are hypothesized to have been key factors stimulating
major phenotypic transitions [4-6]. For example, successive duplications of several key floral organ identity
genes from the MADS-box family imply that polyploidy
was important for the origin and evolution of the flower,
itself a diversity-enhancing feature [7,8]. In addition, a

clustering of genome duplications around the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) boundary in independent angiosperm lineages indicates that polyploid lineages may be
better able to radiate if they are fortunate enough to
survive the randomness inherent in mass extinction
events [9-11].
Most frequently, WGD arises from meiotic non-reduction followed by the fusion of unreduced gametes, commonly via a ‘triploid bridge’ [12]. Ramsey & Schemske
[12] reported that unreduced gametes are produced at
rates on average ca 50 times higher in hybrids than in
non-hybrid lineages. As a result, hybridization and
WGD appear to be closely associated in angiosperms, so
that evolutionarily successful polyploidization events
appear especially prevalent among hybrids [[13], p. 329,
[14-16]]. Autopolyploids are nonetheless widespread in
nature [17,18], and many remain phenotypically hidden
within their diploid parent.
The association of WGD and hybridization may provide several adaptive advantages to an evolutionary lineage. By combining entire parental genomes in the same
nucleus, polyploid hybrids potentially benefit at meiotic
pairing. They also gain from hybrid vigour and transgressive traits (outside the parental range [19,20]), avoiding problems specific to homoploid hybrids such as
segregation and breakdown in F2 generations [21]. Additionally, WGD provides allopolyploids with a high
degree of post-zygotic reproductive isolation from their
diploid relatives [12]. Polyploidy doubles gene number,
creating the potential for buffering vital functions (perhaps via homogenization [22]) but also for functional
divergence (neofunctionalization), which increases biological complexity [23]. Other proposed advantages of
polyploidy relate to relaxation of reproductive system
requirements, via loss of self-incompatibility [24] and/or
potential for agamospermy [21,25]. By perpetuating the
most adaptive hybrid genotypes, allopolyploidy can
result in abrupt or even saltational speciation [26]. However, many neopolyploids will still fail to become established because of reproductive failure [27] and/or
minority cytotype disadvantage [28]. Stebbins [29] extrapolated from well-studied genera that ca 30% of all
angiosperm species may be functional allopolyploids. In
any case, speciation via polyploidy is likely to be a major
mode of sympatric speciation in plants [14,30]; recent
direct estimates indicate that as many as 15% of angiosperm speciation events are accompanied by WGD [31].
Because of the increased gene and genome dosage,
neopolyploids usually suffer from negative effects of
expression redundancies, regulatory incompatibilities
and meiotic abnormalities [21,32]. Hence, allopolyploidy
induces a state of ‘genome shock’ [33], allowing natural
selection to prevent establishment of any maladaptive
early-generation polyploid. Exceptions have been also

reported: for example wheat synthetic allopolyploids
show additivity of expression [34], while in newly
synthesized Gossypium allopolyploids there is little evidence of genomic shock [35]. However, most of the successful early-generation allopolyploids have to
accommodate the two divergent genomes in one
nucleus by adjusting organization and function of both
genomes through genetic and epigenetic alterations
[32,36-38]. Several studies conducted on resynthesized
hybrids/allopolyploids (e.g. [39-44]) and wild neopolyploids (e.g. [45-47]) have revealed that hybridization,
with or without a shift in ploidy, can quickly result in
alterations of gene expression due to gene loss, silencing,
subfunctionalization (tissue-specific expression of gene
copies) and other non-additive expression patterns. More
than one type of alteration has been recorded in most
cases of polyploidy that have been studied in sufficient
detail. Epigenetic changes, such as gene silencing via
DNA methylation change and chromatin remodeling,
appear to be a more universal response that, if stably
inherited, can rapidly lead to subfunctionalization [36] or
to phenotypic differences in recurrent allopolyploids [48].
Despite our increasing general knowledge of polyploidy and hybridization, information remains limited
on the links between genomic responses to allopolyploidization and mechanisms involved in shaping long-term
adaptive capacities in natural allopolyploid populations.
We lack a detailed understanding of the scope of
expression changes and how they function within established natural lineages. For example, we still need to
understand the functional correlations between altered
gene expression and the development of adaptive phenotypes and to determine their effects on ecological and
reproductive isolation and ultimately on evolution of
polyploid lineages. We aim here to investigate gene
expression alterations in three established, sibling allotetraploid (2n = 80) species of the Dactylorhiza majalis
(Rchb.) P.F.Hunt & Summerh. complex (Orchidaceae:
Orchidinae) and to correlate these alterations with their
respective ecological preferences (Figure 1).
The widespread allotetraploids D. majalis s.s. and
D. traunsteineri s.l. have each been derived iteratively at
different times during the last part of the Quaternary;
together with the narrowly endemic D. ebudensis, they
originated through unidirectional hybridization between
the diploids (2n = 40) D. fuchsii (in all cases the maternal
parent) and D. incarnata ([49] and references therein).
Despite their largely shared genetic heritage, the three
allotetraploids differ significantly in morphology, ecology
and geography (Figure 1). Comparison of the degree of
concerted evolution in ITS alleles, the cohesiveness of
epigenetic patterns of individuals from different regions
[48], and the patterns of morphology and ecological preference together suggest that D. majalis s.s. is

substantially more derived and genetically homogeneous.
It is therefore hypothesized to be the oldest of the three
allotetraploids and is presumed to have passed through
glacially induced bottlenecks in southern Eurasia [48,49].
It has a comparatively wide ecological tolerance of soil
moisture (Figure 1) and presently occurs in damp meadows and fens from western and central Europe to southernmost Scandinavia. In contrast, D. traunsteineri s.l. is a
more recently evolved set of allotetraploids that is more
heterogeneous, both genetically [49-51] and epigenetically [48], and often still maintains both parental ITS
alleles. It includes lineages that probably originated postglacially, and at present shows a more localized and disjunct distribution in northwestern and central Europe. It
generally has narrow tolerances of soil moisture, being
vulnerable to drought, and grows in fens and marshes.
A third allotetraploid, D. ebudensis, is a narrow endemic
(at present, 99% of known individuals form a single
extensive metapopulation in northwestern Scotland); it is
considered to be as young as, or younger than, D. traunsteineri [48-50]. The coastal dune habitat that confines
D. ebudensis indicates its relatively narrow substrate tolerances - notably, in the amount of groundwater, its
degree of oxygenation and pH (Figure 1). Despite the fact
that their distribution ranges partly overlap, the three
polyploid taxa have different overall ecological requirements (Figure 1) and are parapatric, rarely co-occurring
within the same site.
Dactylorhiza offers an excellent model system for
studying successful allopolyploidy because: (i) the tetraploid taxa have a recent history of allopolyploidization
but have already become well established; (ii) the parental species involved (but not necessarily the exact parental genotypes) remain extant; (iii) D. majalis and
D. traunsteneri originated from the same parental

species pair and each has multiple origins, thereby providing natural replicates for study; and (iv) all three taxa
differ in habitat preferences, morphology, age and evolutionary history. Overall, this is a suitable study system to
uncover mechanisms of (local) adaptation to divergent
environments following polyploidy and hybridization,
which are assumed to lead to evolutionary diversification
and speciation. A recent investigation [48] of these Dactylorhiza allopolyploids using MSAP (methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism) demonstrated that
divergent selection acts on epigenetic characters and
results in differentiation that correlates with adaptation
to distinct environments. We show here that similar
trends are visible in the expressed patterns of the allopolyploids, and we conclude that ecological divergence
between these polyploid lineages resides mainly in quantitative expression differences.

Methods
Plant material

Several individuals of each allopolyploid species, together
with representatives of the diploid parental species, were
sampled from four geographic regions (Table 1): the
eastern Alps and Scandinavia, where D. majalis and
D. traunsteineri grow in parapatry; northern Pyrenees,
where only D. majalis occurs; and Britain, where
D. traunsteineri s.l. occurs (plus D. ebudensis on the
remote island of North Uist in northwestern Scotland).
Plants were transplanted in the cold glasshouse of the
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (U.K.), where they were
grown in uniform conditions for one year to allow acclimatization prior to leaf sampling. The allopolyploid (but
not the diploid) samples included here have been previously analysed epigenetically using the MSAP technique [48]. Before the transcriptomic analyses, each plant

was genotyped using nuclear and plastid markers (following [49]) to confirm that it conformed to type (Table 1).
cDNA-AFLP technique

Being based on mRNA, this method analyzes only the
transcribed regions of the genome. However, transcript
polymorphism, as identified by cDNA-AFLP, may not
necessarily represent expression differences; apart from
gene silencing, physical loss and non-synonymous polymorphism (indels, substitutions and rearrangements),
synonymous substitutions can also be visible to this
method [37,48]. However, due to the relatively recent
origin and similar genetic background of the allopolyploids (see above), most of the variation depicted with
cDNA-AFLPs is predicted to reflect expression differentiation of parental homeologs rather than polymorphism
at the nucleotide level in exons. Gene expression can
also be regulated at a later, post-transcriptional stage
[52,53]. Parts of this level of regulation could be invisible to the cDNA-AFLP technique. Finally, the cDNAAFLP fragments will contain, in addition to coding
sequence, the untranslated sections (5’ and 3’ UTRs)
that characterize all mRNA strands. Although non-coding, the UTRs are expected to experience selection
because they provide signals and binding sites for elements post-transcriptionally affecting mRNA stability or
translation [54].
The standard AFLP™ procedure [55] was performed on
a pool of cDNAs [37,56] generated from leaves sampled
from Dactylorhiza plants grown in uniform conditions at
RBG Kew as previously reported [48]. The products of 27

primer combinations (of the general type EcoRI AX
[+fluorescent dye]-MseI CYZ, where X, Y and Z are different selective nucleotides) were suspended in formamide
and run on a capillary sequencer ABI 3100 (Applied Biosystems), together with GeneScan ROX 500 (Applied Biosystems) internal size standard. Blind samples and two
replicates (13% of total samples identifying an error rate of
0.8%) were included in all steps to test for contamination
and reproducibility [57]. Fragments in the range 50-490
bp were aligned using ABI PRISM GeneScan 2.1 Analysis
Software (Applied Biosystems) and visualized, scored and
exported as binary presence/absence matrix using Genographer 1.6.
Data analyses

To investigate the structure of the allopolyploid transcriptome, we first assigned the cDNA-AFLP fragments
transcribed from the polyploid genomes according to
their status within the diploid individuals. Four categories of fragments have been traced: (i) transcripts
characteristic of the maternal species, D. fuchsii, (ii)
fragments specific for the paternal D. incarnata, (iii)
fragments shared by the parents, and (iv) markers absent
from parental species but present in allopolyploids (i.e.
“novel” fragments). The average frequency of the different categories of AFLP fragments present in the allopolyploid genomes is presented as a bar-chart (Figure 2).
In all further analyses, any monomorphic fragments
and those present or absent from all but one individual
were removed to avoid biased parameter estimates [57].
To visualize the pattern of expression differentiation, we

constructed a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)
using the program package NTSYS-pc 2.02h [58]. A
matrix of between-individual Dice [59] similarities constructed using the module ‘SimQual’ was transformed
into a scalar form with ‘Dcenter’, on which we computed the eigenvectors and plotted them using ‘Eigen’.
The Dice algorithm, which does not treat shared band
absence as homologous, was chosen because absence of
cDNA-AFLP fragments can result from various causes,
possibly involving silencing of a particular homeolog,
DNA sequence polymorphism or even developmental
differentiation (despite all steps taken to avoid such differentiation). We further estimated the goodness of fit
of the PCoA by generating a model distance matrix
from the eigenvector matrix (using ‘Simint’) and comparing it with the original Dice coefficient matrix (with
‘Mxcomp’ and 1000 permutations). For allopolyploid
individuals only, a neighbor-joining (NJ) dendrogram
based on the between-individuals genetic distance of
Nei & Li [60] was generated and bootstrapped [61]
using 1000 replicates with Treecon 1.3b [62].
To identify particular transcripts that are selected
within allopolyploid individuals by native environmental conditions, and may therefore play a role favouring
their presence in a given landscape, we performed multiple univariate logistic regressions, as implemented in
the spatial analysis method (SAM) proposed by Joost et
al. [63,64]. This method goes beyond simply identifying
genetic loci associated with native ecological

conditions, as it also delivers hypotheses regarding the
physical factors that could exert a relevant selection
pressure in a particular environment. As SAM takes
the individual as the reference unit, the analysis functions independently of any notion of population and is
largely assumption-free [63]. For this purpose, we have
started from a GIS-based ecoclimatic dataset containing 19 bioclimatic parameters from Worldclim (http://
www.worldclim.org/bioclim[65]), plus yearly averages
for vapour pressure (VapPress, in hPa), percentage
cloud cover, number of annual days with ground frost,
and maximum sunlight hours (Sunp, in %) for March
(III), April (IV), May (V), June (VI) and July (VII), all
abstracted from the IWMI Climate and Water Atlas
http://waterdata.iwmi.org. We performed an initial
check for correlations between the 27 variables with
Spearman (two-tailed) bivariate correlations and SPSS
10.0, and the parameters involved in the largest number of correlations were excluded sequentially until no
correlation remained. Therefore, for SAM analyses only
seven ecoclimatic variables have been retained: BIO1 annual mean temperature, BIO8 - mean temperature of
wettest quarter, BIO13 - precipitation of wettest
month, BIO16 - precipitation of wettest quarter, VapPess, and Sunp III (i.e. for March) and SunpVII (i.e. for
July). Finally, for the SAM analyses, each particular
cDNA-AFLP pattern was retained only once (resulting
in a dataset of only 87 cDNA markers), to minimize
the number of comparisons performed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/113

As a measure to control for type 1 errors in multiple
comparisons, SAM uses a Bonferroni corrected level of
significance [63]. Despite its popularity, this procedure
has recently been criticised mainly as being overly stringent [66-68]. Due to the low sample sizes that characterize the expensive cDNA-AFLP method, we expected
low statistical power in our analyses. However, as we
targeted only coding regions, the chances of identifying
signals of selection by chance alone should be much
lower than in genomic studies. We chose here not to
incorporate Bonferroni corrections but rather to use the
alternative false discovery rate procedure (FDR [69]),
which controls for the proportion of significant results
instead of controlling for single errors. We used the R
package QVALUE [70] to adjust P-values derived from
SAM into corresponding Q-values assigning a measure
of significance to each of the 609 tests simultaneously
performed by SAM. In addition, we used SPSS 10.0 to
calculate Spearman’s r s for the paired cDNA markers
and environmental parameters involved in significant
regressions, as a way to report effect size, following the
recommendations of [68].

Gene expression in diploid and polyploid Dactylorhiza

The 27 AFLP primer combinations yielded 305 unambiguous cDNA fragments; of these, 32% were monomorphic among all (diploid and polyploid) individuals
analyzed. Within allopolyploids only, 55% of the 291
transcribed fragments were monomorphic. However, all
individuals showed distinct transcript profiles. The
cDNA-AFLP data matrix and input file for SAM have
been lodged in the Dryad Digital Repository at http://dx.
doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8795 and it is also available as
Additional file 1.
Across the cDNA-AFLP dataset there was a remarkably similar number of fragments characteristic of either
parent: 74 markers were specific for D. fuchsii and 75
for D. incarnata, which contributed to a total transcript
differentiation between the diploid parental species of
58% (Table 2, Figure 2).
The allopolyploid transcriptome (Table 2, Figure 2)
consists of 17-24% maternal (i.e. of D. fuchsii origin),
22-27% paternal (i.e. inherited from D. incarnata) and
45-50% non-specific transcripts (i.e. shared by the two
parents). Many of the inherited patterns are represented
by fixed transcripts within the allopolyploids. Approximately 9% of the cDNA markers in allopolyploid taxa
have been inherited from the maternal progenitor and
are expressed by each allotetraploid individual, and 16%
are fixed within the allopolyploids and have been inherited from the paternal parent.
As much as 7-13% of allopolyploid transcripts appear to
be novel (Table 2, Figure 2), but none represents a

repeatable event across all of the inferred independent
allopolyploidization events. Finally, relatively few fragments (5.3% from D. fuchsii and 2.3% from D. incarnata)
occur in parental species but are missing from all allopolyploids; these absences may represent repeatable events of
gene loss and silencing (although they may also include
synonymous restriction site changes). A much larger fraction of the parental transcriptome has been silenced/lost
in at least one polyploid individual (32% from the D. fuchsii transcript pool and 22% from D. incarnata).
Taxonomic and geographic transcriptomic differentiation

The three-dimensional PCoA (Figure 3A) of cDNAAFLP phenotypes shows clear separation of the two
diploid species and of the allopolyploids, which occupy
an intermediate position between the parental species
along the first axis; this describes a substantial 43% of
the variation present in the data matrix. The second
axis of variation (16% of the signal) separates the representatives of diploid parental species and the allopolyploid group, but places the latter outside the parental
range. The three allopolyploid species are clearly separated from each other by the third axis (containing 9%
of the signal), whereas the combined information of the
three factors separates the four corresponding geographical provenances for the allopolyploids. The goodness-of-fit analysis of the scatter-plot indicated a matrix
correlation value of r = 0.95 at P = 0.001 (one-tailed
probability).

than 70. Symbols follow Figure 3A.

In the NJ analysis of allopolyploid individuals (Figure
3B), two major phylogroups are separated with 89%
bootstrap support (BS): one formed by accessions of
D. majalis and the other formed by D. traunsteineri
plus the phenotypically similar D. ebudensis. Therefore,
D. traunsteineri appears as a paraphyletic group,
although this relationship receives low bootstrap support
(BS < 70%). Within D. majalis, the Scandinavian and
Alpine accessions studied here form a well-supported
subgroup (BS 90%).
Polyploid adaptive segregation

The univariate logistic regressions corresponding to the
Wald test (as implemented in SAM) reached the maximum
number of iterations before the maximum likelihood equation had been solved; they were therefore discarded, following the recommendations of Joost et al. [63,64]. The
alternative test implemented in SAM, the likelihood ratio
or G statistical test, identified 115 (19% of the total) regressions with P-values lower than 0.05. However, after adjusting the level of significance of multiple tests with the FDR
procedure, only 39 (6% of the total) regressions remained
significant with Q-values of significance lower than 0.05
(Table 3). Due to partial correlation between the environmental parameters, the 39 significant correlations involve
27 adaptive markers. Notably, several of these transcripts
represent novel fragments in allopolyploids (Table 3).

Discussion
The cDNA-AFLP technique provides a useful tool
for investigating gene expression alterations

following genome doubling and/or hybridization
[45], especially in non-model systems that lack welldeveloped genomic resources. However, its expense
and the type of data produced (i.e. anonymous and
not quantitative) render the approach less desirable
when it is compared with more recently developed
technologies such as digital transcriptomics (mRNAseq [71]).
In the present study, we detected a high level of transcript differentiation (Table 2, Figure 2) between the
two diploid progenitor species, which proved instrumental for further analyzing the transcriptome of allopolyploids. The high differentiation between the parental
transcriptomes is consistent with several studies based
on other molecular markers, which have recorded wide
genetic divergence between D. fuchsii and D. incarnata
[49,72]. Phylogenetic analyses of Dactylorhiza using
nrDNA sequences of both internal and external transcribed spacers and the intron of the plastid gene rpl16
also indicated that D. fuchsii and D. incarnata are well
differentiated and placed in separate, distinct clades
[49,73-75].
Allopolyploid transcriptomic content

Our investigation of the transcriptomic composition of
sibling allopolyploid Dactylorhiza species (Table 2,
Figure 2) indicated that, although allopolyploid transcriptomes are largely expressing parental genes, a significant
degree of novelty also exists. Given the age of the polyploidization events (most probably few to several thousand
years), the presence of transcripts specific for

Details of the 27 cDNA-AFLP patterns most likely to drive adaptation to divergent environments, together with the corresponding environmental variables
involved, as indicated by the likelihood ratio (G) test implemented in SAM [58]. Significance measurements for the regressions have been adjusted for multiple
testing into Q-values according to Storey [70]. We report here only relationships with Q values < 0.05. As a way to report effect size for each significant
regression we also report Spearman’s rs, following recommendations of Nakagawa [68]. Several environmental parameters show a degree of correlation,
complicating attempts to identify the variable that may exert greatest selective pressure. The underlined markers are novel in allopolyploids (i.e. absent from the
parents).

allotetraploids and the absence of some markers specific
for either parent may reflect post-allopolyploidization evolution of the parental species or incomplete sampling
within parental groups. However, at least some of the
novel patterns may have resulted from recombination
between parental homeologs or from accumulation of
mutations in sequences of polyploids [38,76]. In the (most

probably) hundreds of generations since the allopolyploid
formation, such novel transcripts must have already
proved adaptive in their genomic (i.e. internal) and environmental (i.e. external) context and have been retained by
natural selection (see also below). The novel fragments are
much more common in these established allotetraploid
lineages of Dactylorhiza, compared with the rather limited

Paun et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:113
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/113

proportion (ca 1%) of non-additive transcripts identified
using the same method in the Tragopogon miscellus neopolyploids (less than 80 years old; [45]). In contrast, the
percentage of parental fragments that are missing in the
allopolyploids resembles figures reported in other systems;
for example, the transcriptome of allotetraploid cotton
lacks ca 25% of parental alleles [77]. Importantly, our data
clearly indicate the stochastic nature of all these genomic
alterations, which is particularly visible among the independently formed allopolyploids.
We further observe an obvious tendency for allopolyploids to transcribe more fragments characteristic of the
paternal D. incarnata than of the maternal D. fuchsii
genome (significant at P < 0.001, paired t-test), despite
the similar number of diagnostic transcripts exhibited
by the diploid species (the difference in the number of
specific transcripts in progenitor species was rejected at
P = 0.184, independent samples t-test). This pattern
contradicts the strong maternal bias reliably evident in
most phenotypes of terrestrial orchids [78]. It may indicate that D. fuchsii genes are more often silenced/lost or
that the rate of evolution of the maternal genome of
allopolyploids is higher and more often results in novel
cDNA fragments. This pattern contrasts with results in
other systems - for example, in reciprocal hybrids of
Oryza [43] - where allelic bias of gene expression in
hybrids has been found to simply correlate with parental
differences. On the other hand, a weak maternal expression dominance has been observed in the neopolyploid
Spartina anglica [47].
Considering the fact that D. incarnata is a far more
genetically homogeneous species than D. fuchsii
[49,50,72,79], an alternative explanation is that analyzed
D. incarnata individuals are genetically more similar to
the actual paternal progenitors of the allopolyploids than
those on the maternal side. The difference between proportions of parent-specific fragments inherited in Dactylorhiza allopolyploids is generally consistent with genomic
data [72]. However, at some loci, the converse trend is evident; ITS nuclear rDNA copies are generally converted
towards the maternal parent in Dactylorhiza allopolyploids
(with few exceptions, notably D. sphagnicola; [49]). Studies
in other systems have shown that the relationship between
gene copy number and expression is not always positive;
for example, in Tragopogon neoploids, rDNA repeats of
T. dubius origin are highly expressed and dominate rDNA
transcription, even though homogenization has substantially reduced their copy number [80].
Another interesting aspect of the data obtained is that
the number of cDNA-AFLP fragments transcribed in allopolyploid individuals (Table 2) was significantly higher
compared with either progenitor lineage (P < 0.001, independent samples t-test). Dactylorhiza majalis had on average 33% more fragments than either diploid parental

Page 9 of 14

species, D. traunsteineri 27% more, and D. ebudensis 29%
more; these figures may indicate an increase in the number of gene variants expressed in the allopolyploids. The
difference observed is very similar with the pattern
obtained comparing with RNA-seq the natural allopolyploid Glycine dolichocarpa and its diploid progenitors
[81]. However, this pattern contradicts the widely held
expectation that closely related organisms, independent of
their ploidy, will express a similar number of genes in a
given tissue in a shared environment at a particular
moment in time - the underlying logic being that they are
required to fulfil a similar number of functions. Hence, an
increase in the number of fragments transcribed in allopolyploids provides evidence of an increase in complexity
involving more extensive regulatory networks, subfunctionalization of expression between different leaf tissues, and/
or neofunctionalization [23,82]. Alternatively, both copies
of duplicated genes may remain active and retain their original function over a long evolutionary time in polyploids
if the relative gene-product stoichiometry is essential for
appropriate cellular function or if the genes involved
experience allele-dosage effects [83] that provide selective
advantages. Many genes present in the genomes of extant
angiosperms appear to have originated as a result of
ancient polyploidization, especially many of those involved
in development, transcriptional regulation and signaling
[6,23,84]. The increase in number of such key genes is
thought to have been of major importance for the evolution of biological complexity and the introduction of new
phenotypic architecture in evolution [85].
Further, there was a marginally significant difference
(P = 0.045, independent samples t-test) in the number
of different transcripts amplified in individuals of the
older allopolyploid D. majalis (average 230) and the
cDNA markers in the younger D. traunsteineri and
D. ebudensis (average 221). This trend may indicate
that, with time, homeologs are re-activated and/or
undergo more divergence via subfunctionalization or
neofunctionalization. Such a pattern corroborates results
of epigenetic investigations [86], revealing more methylation novelties in the D. traunsteineri genome than in
D. majalis, which may be gradually reverting towards an
epigenetic state closer to those of the parents.
Increased transcriptomic variation within allopolyploids

In addition to significantly more transcripts per profile,
allopolyploid lineages show an extended range of transcript variability (illustrated by the increased space occupied by the allopolyploids in the transcriptomic
landscape; Figure 3A). For example, diploid D. fuchsii
samples from the eastern Alps and northern Pyrenees
differ at only 12% of the expressed loci, but samples of
D. majalis from the same regions differ at 29% of their
(more numerous) loci. Products of clearly different

Paun et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:113
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/113

polyploidization events can be even more divergent;
there is up to 40% transcript difference between individuals of D. majalis and D. ebudensis. This may indicate
a greater potential for expression plasticity of the allopolyploids resulting in phenotypic variability exceeding
that found in either parent, thus indicating an adaptive
advantage. However, this pattern is not mirrored in
genomic AFLP data [72], where the differences between
samples of parental species, and between samples from
different allotetraploids, occupy a narrower interval (e.g.
43% differentiation within D. fuchsii and 49% between
D. traunsteineri and D. majalis; see table 1 in [72]).
Taxonomic and geographic differentiation of the
allopolyploid transcriptomes

The multiple independent origins of the tetraploids
D. majalis and D. traunsteineri contribute to differential
patterns of gene expression that show some geographic
structure (Figure 3A). Several of the investigated transcripts are conserved within each allopolyploid taxon
but are variable between taxa. The narrow-endemic
Dactylorhiza ebudensis seems to integrate within the
gene pool of D. traunsteineri (Figure 3B), but more studies are necessary for any taxonomic conclusions. At
least 9% of the transcript data (the third vector obtained
from the PCoA; Figure 3A) and the patterns within NJ
(Figure 3B) clearly discriminate between the allotetraploid taxa. In contrast, the results of genomic AFLPs
(mostly non-coding) do not provide clear clustering of
allopolyploids relative to either geography or taxonomy
[72]. This may indicate that habitat shapes similar
expression patterns in some (but not all) of the independent allopolyploidization events, perhaps operating via
epigenetic alterations under the effect of specific environmental pressures [48]. Given the present data, we cannot
exclude the alternative hypothesis that the three allotetraploids may have been formed in situ by different parental
types from within the diploid species, and thereby inherited distinct gene complexes already well-attuned to the
appropriate habitats [87]. However, epigenetic investigations contradict the latter hypothesis [86].
Polyploid adaptive segregation

Allopolyploidy can have broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes; it is a source of
novel phenotypes capable of prompting ecological diversification and new niche invasion [30]. In contrast with
most other polyploid complexes, allotetraploid Dactylorhiza species do not exhibit broader geographical distribution ranges than their parents. The diploid species
have extensive overall distributions, so that natural barriers (e.g. the Mediterranean and Nordic Seas) are likely
to act as equally effective physical constraints on both
diploids and polyploids, most probably through limiting

Page 10 of 14

distribution of appropriate mycorrhizae (e.g. [88]). However, allopolyploid lineages may have broader amplitudes
in at least some ecological parameters than their individual diploid progenitors; for example, they apparently
tolerate greater fluctuations in soil moisture than does
D. incarnata. Their increased overall gene expression
diversity and more numerous transcript variants within
individuals are likely to contribute to more robust/complex regulatory networks and to heterosis, which may
facilitate adaptation to novel conditions. Expression of
duplicate genes diverges rapidly in response to changes in
environmental (both abiotic and biotic) stresses, but relatively slowly in response to developmental changes that
are associated with complex biological networks [89].
Polyploidy provides a vast reservoir of new alleles for
mutation and selection, and hence is a prominent
mechanism of speciation [14,30]. In general, WGD will
immediately provide an allopolyploid with a high degree
of postzygotic reproductive isolation from its diploid
progenitors [12]. However, the products of recurrent
allopolyploidization can suffer from a lack of isolation
from each other. Given that they have the same ploidy
and similar genomic heritage, maintenance of distinctiveness between independently formed sibling Dactylorhiza
allopolyploids is likely to prove difficult in the face of
substantial gene flow, though it is obviously possible. The
most likely explanation is that, in Dactylorhiza, apparently weak reproductive isolation between allopolyploids
is reinforced by considerable ecological divergence, perhaps inherited partly from distinct parental lines and
partly via gene-expression differentiation. However, the
balance between these two contrasting factors remains
contentious, even among the present authors.
In any case, our analyses identify several of the transcriptomic patterns as being significantly correlated with
native environmental conditions (Table 3, Figure 4).
These are soon rendered adaptive, triggering and then
maintaining ecological segregation between the allopolyploids. In this respect, BIO8 (mean temperature of the
wettest quarter) appears to be one of the most relevant
environmental factors exerting selective pressures
among Dactylorhiza allopolyploids - it is involved in
numerous significant regressions (Figure 5), including
the most significant (Table 3). This conclusion receives
further support from previous results of epigenetic
investigations in this system [48]. BIO8 separates
D. majalis from D. traunsteineri and D. ebudensis
(Figure 4) and appears to be the primary epigenetic tool
of divergent selection increasing their differentiation.
Given the marsh-like habitats occupied by Dactylorhiza
allopolyploids in general, we can easily find the biological interpretation of the adaptive function of a waterand temperature-related climatic parameter. Other
important selective pressures seem to be exerted by

In general, there has been insufficient exploration of
levels of gene-flow among co-occurring Dactylorhiza
allotetraploids. In England and Wales, there is ostensibly
a surprisingly narrow ‘hybrid zone’ occupied by the
northern tetraploids D. purpurella and D. traunsteineri
(as narrowly circumscribed in the British Isles by [50])
and the southern tetraploid D. praetermissa, which
more closely resembles D. majalis genetically (e.g. [49]).
The hybrid zone coincides with the Weichselian glacial
maximum [50,90], suggesting an edaphic influence on
their distributions in addition to latitude-related climatic
clines. There is growing evidence of gradual southward
expansion of D. purpurella and northward expansion of
D. praetermissa into each others territory, with concomitant introgression [50], particularly in dune slacks and
quarries [90]. Such populations merit detailed (epi)
genetic and autecological investigation to determine the
extent of gene flow and identify which factors have precluded more rapid migration.

allopolyploids; divergence between them may instead
reside in quantitative partitioning of expression patterns,
mainly via epigenetic changes that affect the level of
expression of individual genes. Indeed, expression levels
of a gene alone can determine phenotypes that contribute to the natural variation on which selection operates
[91]. The key extrinsic factor responsible for the environmental selective pressures that are shaping adaptive
expression patterns in Dactylorhiza allopolyploids seems
to be a combination of water availability and temperature, perhaps in addition to pH and associated soil conditions. This conclusion is not surprising, given the
moist equable habitats that these lineages usually
occupy. Further studies of gene expression, combined
with detailed exploration of the in situ ecological tolerances of diploid and allotetraploid taxa, should help to
better understand the significance of iterative polyploid
evolution and to identify the exact functions that are
differently regulated in sibling lineages following recurrent hybridization and WGD.

Conclusions
Neutral genomic differentiation between Dactylorhiza
allopolyploids is rarely clearly diagnosable [48-50,72].
This ambiguity contrasts with the surprisingly distinct
expression patterns observed (Figure 3), although coding
regions are generally expected to evolve much more
slowly, and their epigenetic divergence is clear [48]. In
the light of present and previous results [48], physical
(genetic) diversification per se may be less relevant for
