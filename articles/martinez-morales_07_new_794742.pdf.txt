Results: To determine the origin of neural crest genes, we analyzed Phenotype Ontology
annotations to select genes that control the development of this tissue. Using a sequential blast
pipeline, we phylogenetically classified these genes, as well as those associated with other tissues,
in order to define tissue-specific profiles of gene emergence. Of neural crest genes, 9% are
vertebrate innovations. Our comparative analyses show that, among different tissues, the neural
crest exhibits a particularly high rate of gene emergence during vertebrate evolution. A remarkable
proportion of the new neural crest genes encode soluble ligands that control neural crest
precursor specification into each cell lineage, including pigmented, neural, glial, and skeletal
derivatives.

Background: Development of the vertebrate head depends on the multipotency and migratory
behavior of neural crest derivatives. This cell population is considered a vertebrate innovation and,
accordingly, chordate ancestors lacked neural crest counterparts. The identification of neural crest
specification genes expressed in the neural plate of basal chordates, in addition to the discovery of
pigmented migratory cells in ascidians, has challenged this hypothesis. These new findings revive the
debate on what is new and what is ancient in the genetic program that controls neural crest
formation.

Conclusion: We propose that the evolution of the neural crest is linked not only to the
recruitment of ancestral regulatory genes but also to the emergence of signaling peptides that
control the increasingly complex lineage diversification of this plastic cell population.

As first proposed by Gans and Northcutt [1,2], the major evolutionary innovation of the vertebrate body plan relies on
elaboration of a new head at the anterior end of an ancestral

chordate trunk. The three existing groups of the phylum
Chordata, namely urochordates (ascidians), cephalochordates (amphioxus), and craniates (including vertebrates and
agnates), share many characteristics. These include a

notochord, segmented trunk muscles, and a dorsal nerve
cord. Molecular data have further confirmed these anatomic
descriptions, revealing a conserved patterning mechanism
along the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes of the
neural tube [3]. Resting on this archetypal chordate body
plan, unique populations of cells, the neural crest and the
ectodermal placodes, evolved in craniates (referred to here as
'vertebrates' for simplicity). The emergence of these pluripotent cells is linked to the evolution of more sophisticated sensory and predatory organs (for instance, jaws). These new
organs, in conjunction with an increasingly complex brain,
allowed the shift from a filter-feeding style of life toward
active predatory strategies [2,4].
The neural crest is a transient population of embryonic cells
that originate at the boundary between neural plate and dorsal ectoderm. Secreted from neighboring tissues, signaling
molecules of the Wnt, Fgf, and Bmp families cooperate to
activate a distinct combination of transcription factors at the
neural plate border. Among those are members of the Pax,
Zic, Snail, Sox, and Msx families, which constitute the neural
crest specification network [5,6]. Shortly after their dorsal
specification, neural crest cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migrate, and finally, upon arrival at
their destination, they give rise to a variety of cell types. These
include peripheral neurons, glial and Schwann cells, pigment
cells, endocrine cells, cartilage, and bone [7,8]. This large
diversity of derivatives arises through a complex mechanism
of lineage restriction, which operates both early, on the
pluripotent precursors at the dorsal neural tube [9], and later,
during the migration and differentiation of precursors
already committed to different degrees [10,11]. Environmental cues found throughout neural crest migratory routes play
a fundamental role not only in instructing the precursor's differentiation into particular phenotypes, but also in controlling their proliferation and survival [7]. Among these
extracellular cues, classical signaling molecules such as Fgfs,
Wnts, Bmps and transforming growth factor (TGF)-βs, in
conjunction with locally produced cytokines such as neurotropins, endothelins, glial-derived neurotropic factor
(GDNF), neuregulin and cKit, have been shown to influence
precursor fate and survival [12,13].
The neural crest has traditionally been considered the key
structure acquired very early by craniate pioneers. The presence of cartilage first and biomineralized material later in the
head of the earliest craniate fossils supports this view [14,15].
Because of their particular nature, the evolution of cartilage
and bone elements can easily be traced in the large collection
of Cambrian fossils. Many fossil fish exhibit neural crest
derived exoskeletal coverings of dermal bone that extend partially over the trunk, with no trace of mesenchymal endoskeleton [16]. These paleontologic records indicate that in early
vertebrates cartilage and bones arose first in the context of
the cephalic neural crest, and that only later was this genetic
program co-opted by the para-axial sclerotome [17].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/3/R36

The existence of an ancestral population of cells in early chordates that give rise to vertebrate neural crest on the one hand
and to basal chordate dorsal derivatives on the other has been
proposed several times [2,18-20]. This hypothesis is supported by the conservation of many components of the neural
crest specification network in chordates [6]. Furthermore,
migratory cells that express neural crest markers and differentiate as pigmented cells have recently been identified in the
urochordate Ecteinascidia turbinate [21]. These data reinforce the hypothesis of pan-chordate 'precursors' behaving
similarly and expressing a set of genes homologous to the
modern neural crest. According to this view, the innovative
drive impelling neural crest evolution stems from the evolution of their cis-regulatory elements - a process facilitated by
the ancestral duplication of the vertebrate genome. The duplication of key developmental genes would have released
enough evolutionary pressure to facilitate their divergence
and hence the evolution of new functions [17]. Although the
existence of pan-chordate 'precursors' offers a satisfactory
answer to the evolutionary origin of the neural crest, it fails to
account for the acquisition of fundamental properties of this
tissue. These include the pluripotency of the neural crest precursors that now give rise to novel cell types that are present
neither in basal chordates nor in other metazoans.
To gain insight into the origin and evolution of neural crest
properties, we have chosen a bioinformatics approach to analyze the phylogeny of tissue-specific developmental programs
in a systematic manner. Our analytical tool takes advantage of
an extensive collection of mouse genes annotated through
Mammalian Phenotype Ontology terms [22] (at Mouse
Genome Informatics [MGI] [23]). According to their related
mouse mutant phenotype annotations, we grouped genes into
tissue-specific genetic programs. We then explored the phylogeny of each program using a sequential blast pipeline. We
defined as 'new genes' those encoding proteins that did not
exhibit any significant homology in previous phylogenetic
categories, either because they are extremely divergent or
because they have evolved de novo. For each group, the total
number of new genes at each branch of the evolutionary tree
was analyzed. These graphical representations (gene emergence plots) are characteristic for each tissue/organ. They
show how the rate of gene innovation has changed during the
evolution of a particular tissue. These data substantiate the
traditional concept that neural crest is a vertebrate innovation. In addition, our systematic analysis demonstrates that
neural crest evolution builds not only on the rewiring of gene
networks but also on the emergence of new genes. Gene
Ontology (GO) analysis of the group of new neural crest components revealed remarkable enrichment in extracellular ligands. Half of the vertebrate new genes encode secreted
cytokines that are known to control the specification and survival of the different neural crest derivatives, including pigment cells, neurons, glial cells, and skeletal components.
Here we propose that the emergence of these novel ligands is
associated with the evolutionary transition of a relatively

In order to investigate when neural crest genes arose during
evolution, it was necessary to build a comprehensive list of
genes involved in the development of this tissue. A large
number of studies, in particular the phenotypic analysis of
mutations in mice, generated by either mutagenesis or
genetic engineering, have led to the identification of many
genes that are involved in neural crest development [7]. The
Mammalian Phenotype Browser, at MGI [23], provides a
comprehensive resource of phenotypic information derived
from mouse mutant studies [22]. Because phenotypic analysis annotations offer the most reliable read out of gene function, we took advantage of this large collection of mouse
mutants in our study. The collection includes more than
14,000 genotype records associated with a total of 6,442
genes (27% of the total mouse transcriptome), and furthermore it includes the majority of the genes demonstrated to
play a bona fide role in neural crest development. In the MGI
database each mutation is annotated by a controlled vocabulary of phenotypic terms that describe the effect of a genetic
variation on different tissues, organs, or systems. We selected
the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology for terms associated
with mutations affecting both neural crest precursors and its
derivative cell types and tissues.

refereed research

A direct comparison of the percentage of genes appearing in
each category with an estimation of their respective age in
millions of years [28] indicated that the frequency of gene
emergence is higher for late categories (specifically, metazoans to mammals; Figure 1b,c). This higher frequency of innovation correlates with the reported observation that the rate
of evolution for proteins (calculated as the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous amino acid substitutions) is
also higher for more recent categories [26].

Assignment of neural crest genes based on phenotypic
data

deposited research

As a first step in determining when neural crest genes
evolved, we filtered mouse proteins through a sequential blast
pipeline. All 23,658 known mouse protein sequences
(EnsEMBL v31) were consecutively blasted against available
genomes grouped into seven different evolutionary categories
(prokaryota, eukaryota, metazoa, deuterostomia, chordata,
vertebrata, and mammalia) using a relaxed threshold of E =
10-4, as established in similar studies [26,27]. Proteins exhibiting homology when blasted against the prokaryotic
genomes were classified as ancient. The remaining genes
were subsequently blasted against eukaryotic genomes and
the procedure was repeated until all genes were classified
(Figure 1a). According to our definition, 'new genes' in each
category are those encoding proteins that did not exhibit any
significant homology in previous categories, either because
they have diverged extensively from a former protein or
because they have evolved de novo.

novel molecular functions, we performed a GO analysis [29].
For each evolutionary category we identified the GO terms
that are statistically over-represented compared with all of
the known mouse proteins. The 10 most significantly overrepresented GO terms for each of the seven different categories are listed in Table 1 (also see Additional data file 1 for a
full list of over-represented GO terms). Our analysis shows
that, within a large evolutionary window, innovations are
associated with the emergence of 'new genes'. Although the
first category, prokaryota, is enriched in genes that are
involved in general cell metabolism, GO terms of genes
appearing first in eukaryotes demonstrate their function in
the newly evolved subcellular organelles. In metazoans we
find the GO terms 'cell communication', 'signal transduction',
and 'receptor activity' to be highly over-represented, which is
in accordance with a de novo requirement for cell-cell communication and tissue subspecialization in the context of
multicellularity. Interestingly, the collection of genes appearing first in vertebrates and mammals is enriched in terms
such as 'hormone activity', 'receptor binding', 'extracellular
space', and 'cytokine response', suggesting that diversification of receptor ligands is linked to vertebrate evolution. In
summary, our sequential blast pipeline reliably classifies
genes according to their first appearance within the phylogenetic tree.

reviews

How animal body plans are modified in relation to the evolution of their genome is an intricate issue. Acquisition of novel
properties in a particular cell type, or even innovative changes
in tissues and organs, can very often be attributed to modifications in the wiring of pre-existing gene networks [24].
However, a fundamental process in genome evolution is also
the emergence of new genes. Several molecular mechanisms,
including exon shuffling, gene duplication and fusion, transposition, fast sequence divergence, and entire de novo origin,
have been proposed to serve as sources for gene innovation
[25]. In this work we explore the phylogeny of the genes that
are involved in neural crest development to gain insight into
the evolution of neural crest properties. We aimed to determine which components of the vertebrate neural crest gene
program are ancient, and hence have been recruited to perform a function in this tissue, and which components evolved
only recently.

included in this definition. However, when we took phenotypes associated with the development of neural crest derivatives into account, we retrieved a comprehensive list of 615
genes. In our analysis we considered three main groups of
neural crest derivatives: pigmented cells, skeletal components, and elements of the peripheral nervous system. The
'pigmentation derivatives phenotype' is completely covered
by a single term, namely 'pigmentation phenotype'
(MP:0001186). The 'bone derivatives phenotype' terms consist of 'craniofacial phenotype' (MP:0005382) and 'skeleton
phenotype' (MP:0005390). At this point, it could be argued
that vertebrate neural crest cells only give rise to cranial skeleton and teeth, whereas the axial skeleton has a mesodermal
origin. As already mentioned, however, paleontologic records
indicate that skeletal elements evolved within the context of

the neural crest and only later was this genetic program coopted by the sclerotome [17]. The 'peripheral nervous system
derivatives phenotype' consists of 'abnormal autonomic nervous system morphology' (MP:0002751), 'abnormal peripheral nervous system glia' (MP:0001105), 'abnormal somatic
sensory system morphology' (MP:0000959), and 'peripheral
nervous system degeneration' (MP:0000958). We grouped
these three categories under the general term 'neural crest
derivatives phenotype'.

Emergence of neural crest molecules defining novel
cellular functions
The notion of neural crest as a tissue with a high rate of gene
innovation apparently contradicts our finding that all known
neural crest specifiers can be traced back at least to metazoans. To further address this point, we focused on the collection of neural crest 'new genes' to gain insight into their
molecular nature and function.

Conserved signaling pathways have an early influence on the
phenotypic diversification of premigratory neural crest cells
[13]. Bmp2/4 can directly induce autonomic neurogenesis
[33,34], while Wnt signaling participates in melanocyte specification [35]. Superimposed on this, a second network of
'modern' vertebrate specific cytokines, produced locally, acts
not only in neural crest cell fate specification but also in the
migratory behavior and survival of all neural crest lineages
[12]. Melanocyte specification and survival depend on soluble
proteins such as steel factor (kit ligand), endothelin-3, αmelanocyte stimulating hormone, and nonagouti [36]; gliogenesis in the peripheral nervous system is controlled by neuregulins and endothelin-3 [37,38]; the development of
autonomic and sensory neurons is controlled by neuro-

refereed research

Strikingly, 50% of neural crest genes appearing first in vertebrates encode extracellular ligands. This remarkable enrichment (confirmed by exploring GO term frequency; see
Additional data file 3) is in accordance with our previous
whole-transcriptome GO analysis (Table 1). It suggests that
diversification of receptor ligands played an important role
during vertebrate evolution in general and neural crest
evolution in particular. Individual analysis of the function of
these peptides during the development of the neural crest
demonstrates that they control the commitment of precursors to the different lineages.

deposited research

Neural crest has been postulated as a fourth germ layer [32].
This concept builds on neural crest pluripotency and the fact
that in vertebrates it gives rise to novel cell types such as the
skeletal derivatives or the specialized melanocytes [11]. Consistently, in the collection of vertebrate/mammalian new
genes, we found molecules defining the physiology of these
novel cell types. This is the case for the genes Ru (HermanskyPudlak syndrome 6) and silver, which encode components of
the specialized melanocyte lysosomes, the melanosomes.
Similarly, several new genes encode extracellular proteins
that constitute part of the bone matrix (for example, bone gla
protein and the phosphoglycoprotein mepe) and enamel, the
outermost covering of teeth and the hardest tissue in the body
(for example, ameloblastin and amelogenin).

reports

For each of the tissue-specific gene programs studied, we
ordered the ger values at the chordate-vertebrate transition
(Figure 2a). Notably, tissues/systems ontogenetically derived
from ventral mesoderm, and hence considered modern vertebrate innovations [2,17,30,31], such as the hematopoietic,
immune, or renal/urinary system, exhibit graphs that peak at
the chordate-vertebrate transition (Figure 2b). In contrast,
other tissues already present in all chordates, namely the epidermis or endodermal derivatives such as liver, respiratory,
and digestive systems, have a flat profile, with lower ger values (Figure 2b). Both the profile of the neural crest gene
emergence plot (Figure 3) and its ger value (3.1) indicate that
the neural crest is among the most innovative vertebrate tissues (Figure 2a). This concept can be extended to each
individual neural crest lineage, in particular to pigmented or
bone derivatives, as deduced from their respective gene emergence plots (Figure 3). Interestingly, compared with the other
crest derivatives, the ger value of the gene set associated with
the peripheral nervous system derivatives is lower (1.6). This
may best be explained by co-option from the ancestral pro-

gram of neural development. In summary, our gene emergence plots that reliably reflect evolutionary innovation
highlight the novelty of neural crest as a tissue.

reviews

However, we found that a substantial percentage of the genes
(9%, listed in Table 2) involved in neural crest development
evolved in deuterostomes during the past 550 million years.
To determine, within this evolutionary window, how the rate
of gene emergence in the neural crest relates to the rate of
innovation in other tissues, we plotted the cumulative
number of genes appearing in each category. In these graphs,
the tissue-specific evolutionary profile of gene emergence is
depicted (Figure 2). In order to quantify the profile of the
graphs we calculated 'gene emergence rate' (ger) values, as a
numeric representation of the gene innovation rate from an
earlier category to a later one (see Materials and methods for
a description of the formula). A ger value of 1 indicates a constant profile of gene innovation. Higher ger values indicate
increased appearance of new genes in a particular tissue.

comment

provides a functional link for each of these genes. Combining
both, we determined in which category each of the 615 neural
crest genes emerged (see Additional data file 2 for the full
dataset). Previous studies had promoted the idea that gene
co-option was the driving force for neural crest invention [6].
Our data strongly support this view because the majority
(91%) of genes involved in neural crest development was
already present in basal metazoans or even before. Thus, key
transcription factors acting as both 'neural plate border specifiers' (such as Pax3, Dlx5, Zic, and Msx1/2) and 'neural crest
specifiers' (such as FoxD, Snail/Slug, Sox9/10, Twist, and AP2) can be traced back to our category 'metazoans' or 'eukaryotes'. Similarly, the Fgf, Wnt, and Bmp signaling pathways
involved in induction of the neural plate border are ancestral.
Although their corresponding ligands can be traced back to
basal metazoans, the kinase activity of their receptors was
already present in prokaryotes. Altogether, these data confirm the idea that gene recruitment played an important role
during neural crest evolution.

mechanism because other 'new cytokines' can be related to preexisting growth factors. Supporting this view, GDNF and neurturin are divergent members of the TGF-b superfamily of ligands, as indicated by their particular cysteine knot and hence
folding [44]. Similarly, despite their limited homology, neuregulins belong to the epidermal growth factor superfamily of ligands
[45].

The comparative analysis of gene emergence plots highlights
a high rate of gene innovation for the neural crest during vertebrate evolution. In fact, there are reasons to believe that our
estimation on the rate of gene emergence may be conservative. In the sequential blast pipeline analysis, the presence of
an ancestral conserved domain will shadow the appearance of
evolutionarily more recent domains within the same molecule. This may be particularly relevant in the case of large
multidomain proteins such as receptors.

Taken together, our data show that the cytokine network acting in neural crest cell fate specification is mainly a vertebrate
innovation (Figure 4). Furthermore, these analyses indicate
that an important proportion of the 'new ligands' are derived
from fast evolving growth factors.

Interestingly, the blast pipeline uncovered a positive hit in the
echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome for the
neurotropin family members brain-derived neurotropic factor and neurothropin-3. Because it has been proposed that
neurotropins constitute a vertebrate innovation [42], we performed a ClustalX alignment [43] of mouse neurotropins
against the echinoderm sequence (Additional data file 4). This
revealed that the particular array of cysteines conserved in all
neurotropins, the so-called 'cysteine knot' [44], is also present in
the echinoderm sequence and therefore identifies it as a putative
growth factor. However, the limited amino acid identity (33%)
and the lack of conservation in critical residues required for neurotropin binding to Trk receptors indicate that the echinoderm
neurotropin-related protein cannot be considered a bona fide
neurotropin. This suggests that neurotropins evolved from
divergent ligands present in ancestral chordates. In fact, the
example of neurotropins may be just part of a more general

thropins (brain-derived neurotropic factor, neurothropin-3,
and neurothropin-4) and GDNF family members (GDNF and
neurturin) [39,40]; and, finally, the differentiation of the
skeletal lineage is specified by endothelin-1 [41]. Our sequential blast pipeline analysis shows that the vast majority (9/11)
of the above-mentioned cell fate specification ligands
emerged in vertebrates or, to a lesser extent (steel factor and
nonagouti), in mammals.

To overcome this constraint and to complement our studies,
we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the Pfam motifs
(defined by multiple alignment of proteins [46]) occurring in
the collection of 615 neural crest genes. From a total of 8,183
Pfam domains annotated in EnsEMBL, 499 are present in the
set of 615 neural crest genes. We screened for these motifs in
the seven different categories, detecting homology through
two different approaches: blasting Pfam consensus sequences

(threshold of E = 10-4) and searching for hidden Markov models (HMMs) using HMMER software with standard parameters [46]. We compiled a table including all neural crest genes
with their Pfam domains and when they occur first in the
defined seven temporal classes, as detected using either of the
methods (Additional data file 5). A list including only those
genes that contain a Pfam domain emerging in vertebrates is
compiled in Table 3. Pfam domain detection supports and

refines our sequential blast pipeline results. Thus, GDNF and
neurturin were identified as divergent members of the TGF-β
superfamily, and the kit-ligand and nonagouti domains were
detected as vertebrate novelties (previously detected as mammalian innovations; Table 2). Furthermore, the analysis also
confirmed the ClustalX alignments demonstrating that the
neurotropin domain (nerve growth factor; Table 3) is indeed
a vertebrate innovation. In summary, our domain-based
approach (more sensitive and accurate, but limited to annotated Pfam domains) complements the sequential blast analysis (Table 2), providing independent confirmation of the
emergence in vertebrates of growth factors that are involved
in the specification/survival of the neural crest cells (Table 3).
In addition, the domain-based approach also detected 'new
Pfam motifs' masked in the sequential blast pipeline studies
by the presence of an ancient domain. An example is the
appearance in vertebrates of regulatory domains, such as
TF_Otx, caudal_act, and Hox9_act, which are present in
homeobox-containing transcription factors that belong to the
Otx, Cdx, and Hox9 families, respectively (Table 3). We have
shown that half of the neural crest genes appearing first in
vertebrates encode extracellular ligands. This is contrasted by
the Pfam domain analysis of the corresponding receptors.
Only a single domain in ligand receptors is identified as a vertebrate novelty, namely the GDNF domain, which is present
in the GDNF and neurturin coreceptor termed GFRalpha-1.
This observation suggests that receptor evolution requires
only subtle changes (in the sequence of their extracellular
domains) to allow interaction with the 'new ligands', changes
that are too subtle to be detected as discrete 'new domains' in
our analysis.

Final remarks: toward a comprehensive hypothesis on
neural crest evolution
Our understanding of how developmental regulatory pathways evolved in metazoans is now building upon steadily
accumulating sequence collections that cover representative
taxonomic groups. Here we have developed and applied a bioinformatics approach that allows us first to define components of the neural crest developmental gene program and
then to analyze their phylogeny. Our evolutionary study, as
for others based on comparative genomics, is limited by the
quality of the available resources. The validity of the conclusions, beyond individual evolutionary relationships among
genes, arise from the global picture provided by the properties of large datasets in which no systematic bias has been
introduced. In our study we have considered several potential
sources of bias. An important limitation in comparative
studies is the arbitrary definition of the components of a particular gene network or gene program. Often this definition is
directly inferred from the literature [23]. To avoid this, the
phenotypic analysis of mutants offers the most reliable read
out of gene function, and at the same time it provides an unbiased definition. The fact that 'less conspicuous' phenotypic
features, such as phenotypes associated with the immune or

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/3/R36

hematopoietic system, are as well annotated as the more obvious ones in pigmentation or skin indicates that there is no
global bias in our analysis toward the detection of a given phenotype. Another possible caveat when interpreting studies of
this type may come from massive gene loss in sister phyla,
which will result in the false impression of new genes emerging in the phylum considered. These losses are particularly
apparent in protostomia [47]. In our analysis, focused on deuterostomia groups, these effects are well buffered by filtering
the data not only through tunicates but also through echinoderm and cephalochordate sequences. The fact that it is
highly unlikely that the same gene is independently lost in all
three phylogenetic branches levels potential bias through
gene loss and gives robustness to our approach.
Our data show that new genes, either resulting from gene
divergence or de novo gene evolution, are linked to the
appearance of novel molecular and cellular functions.
Comparative study of different tissues shows the highest gene
emergence rates for those tissues considered vertebrate innovations, such as neural crest and ventral mesoderm derivatives [17]. For the neural crest gene program, we show that
half of the genes appearing first in vertebrates encode growth
factors with a reported role in committing precursor fate
(Figure 4). Our whole-genome analysis also shows that GO
terms such as 'hormone activity', 'receptor binding', 'extracellular space', and 'cytokine response' are highly enriched in the
collection of genes that emerge in vertebrates. Therefore, the
expansion of the ligand toolkit during evolution does not
appear to be limited to the neural crest. Rather, it also
occurred in other vertebrate-specific tissues, which evolved
from ancestral chordates. Examples of this are the vertebratespecific interleukins and hematopoietic cytokines that control
fate, maturation, and survival of the complex lymphoid and
blood cell lineages. Taken together, our data indicate that the
appearance of new growth factors satisfied an evolutionary
requirement for signal diversification, beyond the ancestral
network of signaling peptides.
The diversification of ancestral ligands may represent an
independent evolutionary advantage distinct from a parallel
diversification of receptors. The independent evolution of
derived growth factor genes, now under the control of divergent promoter sequences, introduces additional complexity
in the spatial and temporal regulation of signaling. Divergent
ligands may also interact very differently with extracellular
matrix components, with concomitant changes in gradient
shape and presentation to the receptors. Ligands with those
new properties can now take advantage of existing receptors
and downstream signaling pathways that are present in
competent cells. This further refinement of the activity of
growth factors may be particularly important in lineage-rich
tissues, in which it is crucial to discriminate inductive signals
involved in cell fate determination.

Blast searches and assignment of temporal categories

The list of genes described by phenotype ontology was
obtained from the MGI report (3.22 release):
MRK_Pheno_Ensembl.rpt [50]. This table represents the
MGI marker associations with Phenotype Annotations and
EnsEMBL sequence. The main phenotypical categories
stored in the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology are the following: adipose tissue phenotype (MP:0005375), behavior/neurologic phenotype (MP:0005386), cardiovascular system

interactions

The first appearance of mouse proteins during evolution was
assessed through a sequential blast pipeline using a relaxed
cutoff value (E = 10-4) and standard parameters (blastp for
protein and tblastn for nucleotide databases) to detect
homology in more distant species [26,27]. We assigned each
of the 23,658 mouse proteins to one of the seven evolutionary
categories according to when their first hit occurred (in which
taxonomic group). Genes already assigned to a temporal category were excluded from further blast analysis. The remaining genes were then subsequently blasted against the
following genomes until eventually all mouse genes were
classified.

We looked for GO terms that were statistically over-represented in our temporal categories. Each of these gene sets was
compared with the whole set of GO annotated mouse genes.
We used mouse MGI GO annotation available at the GoStat
web server [49] for this analysis [29]. GoStat compares the
occurrence of each GO term for each different temporal category and for the reference genes, and performs a Fisher's
exact test to judge whether the observed difference is significant. A complete list of all over-represented and under-represented GO annotations is provided in Additional data file 1.

refereed research

To estimate the emergence of mammalian genes we analyzed
the set of all 23658 known mouse protein sequences from
EnsEMBL v31. We identified any gene product related to the
mouse reference sequences in 225 different genomes by using
blast [48]. A complete list of genomes and their origin is given
in supplementary information (Additional data file 6).
Genomes were downloaded from Cogent, EnsEMBL, and
NCBI. These genomes were grouped into seven temporal categories based on their evolutionary origin (Table 4).

sequential blast pipeline, we also launched the filtering process using other vertebrate groups, namely chicken, xenopus,
and zebrafish genomes. Independent of the input used, we
observed a similar distribution of genes in the various evolutionary categories (Additional data file 7). This finding indicates that there is no evident specific gene loss in the mouse.
This necessary control further corroborates the choice of the
mouse genome as a representative vertebrate.

reports

Previous theories on neural crest evolution have mainly
focused on the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origin of the tissue from the dorsal area of the ancestral chordate neural tube.
Along these lines, the rewiring of the genes involved in the
neural crest specification network has been invoked as the
main evolutionary driving force [6]. Our data now expand
this view by suggesting that new signaling molecules were
required to control further the development of the neural
crest into its different derivatives, which are essential components of the actual vertebrate body plan.

Gene emergence rate calculation
In order to quantify the relative change in the number of 'new
genes' arising at a given temporal category, we define the gene
emergence rate (ger) as the ratio between the number of
genes emerging in the analyzed temporal category (vertebrates in our case) and the number of genes emerging in the
previous temporal category (chordates in our case). Thus, for
the transition from chordates to vertebrates, the ger value is
defined as follows:

Assignment of Pfam domains to temporal categories
through HMM and blast searches
To derive a more detailed view of the evolution of proteins
involved in neural crest development, we examined when the
protein domains found in the list of neural crest genes are
first detectable in our temporal categories. First, we downloaded the Pfam annotations for the identified 615 neural
crest genes from EnsEMBL (version 32). Of the total of 8183
Pfam domains, 499 are present (annotated in EnsEMBL) in
the set of 615 genes. We downloaded consensus sequences
and HMMs for these domains from Pfam (version 19.0) [51].

Pfam domains were searched in the temporal category databases using two methods: blasting the Pfam consensus
sequence with an E value threshold of 10-4 and searching
HMM using HMMER software [52] applying standard
parameters. In general, the HMM search was more sensitive
and able to detect a domain earlier than the Pfam consensus
blast analysis. For the expressed sequence tag databases, we
used only the blast search. A full table, including all neural
crest genes with their Pfam domains and their appearance as
detected by either of the methods, was compiled (Additional
data file 5).
