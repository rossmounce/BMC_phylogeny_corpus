Abstract
Background: Inter-subtype recombinants dominate the HIV epidemics in three geographical regions. To better
understand the role of HIV recombinants in shaping the current HIV epidemic, we here present the results of a
large-scale subtyping analysis of 9435 HIV-1 sequences that involve subtypes A, B, C, G, F and the epidemiologically
important recombinants derived from three continents.
Results: The circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG, common in West Central Africa, appears to result from
recombination events that occurred early in the divergence between subtypes A and G, followed by additional
recent recombination events that contribute to the breakpoint pattern defining the current recombinant lineage.
This finding also corrects a recent claim that G is a recombinant and a descendant of CRF02, which was suggested
to be a pure subtype. The BC and BF recombinants in China and South America, respectively, are derived from
recent recombination between contemporary parental lineages. Shared breakpoints in South America BF
recombinants indicate that the HIV-1 epidemics in Argentina and Brazil are not independent. Therefore, the
contemporary HIV-1 epidemic has recombinant lineages of both ancient and more recent origins.
Conclusions: Taken together, we show that these recombinant lineages, which are highly prevalent in the current
HIV epidemic, are a mixture of ancient and recent recombination. The HIV pandemic is moving towards having
increasing complexity and higher prevalence of recombinant forms, sometimes existing as “families” of related
forms. We find that the classification of some CRF designations need to be revised as a consequence of (1) an
estimated > 5% error in the original subtype assignments deposited in the Los Alamos sequence database; (2) an
increasing number of CRFs are defined while they do not readily fit into groupings for molecular epidemiology
and vaccine design; and (3) a dynamic HIV epidemic context.

Background
Retroviral recombination introduces rapid, large genetic
alternations [1-3], and can repair genome damage [4,5].
Recombination is a major force in HIV evolution, occurring at an estimated rate of at least 2.8 crossovers per
genome per cycle [6]. Recently the effective recombination rate, i.e., the product of super-infection and crossovers, was estimated to be on a similar frequency as the
nucleotide substitution rate within patients (1.4 × 10-5
recombinations per site and generation) [7]. Recombination between HIV-1 subtypes may result in establishing
epidemiologically important founder strains. Recombinant lineages can contribute to secondary recombination

events, leaving traces of ever more complex diversity
patterns and confounding classical phylogenetics [8].
Within a single host, recombination may produce variants resistant to HIV-1 specific drugs and immune
pressure [9-12].
At least 20% of HIV-1 isolates sequenced worldwide
are inter-subtype recombinants [13-16]. These recombinants are classified into two categories, CRFs (circulating recombinant forms) and URFs (unique recombinant
forms), referring to recombinants that have established
recurrent and transmitted forms in populations, and to
those only identified in one individual, respectively [17].
Currently, more than 40 CRFs and 100 URFs have been
identified worldwide http://www.hiv.lanl.gov. Globally,
these numbers are increasing as a result of multiple subtypes (and recombinants) in local epidemics, thus

providing the biological context for inter-subtype
recombination. The number of detected recombinants is
also increasing due to improved technology allowing
rapid large-scale genome sequencing and the availability
of more advanced recombination detection software.
It is estimated that CRF02_AG, a CRF derived from
subtype A and G, has caused at least 9 million infections
worldwide [18]. First identified in Nigeria in 1994 [19],
it is the most prevalent strain in West and West Central
Africa. In Cameroon, where the original HIV-1 M group
zoonotic transmissions are believed to have taken place
[20,21], CRF02 was already prevalent in the early 1990s
[22], and it is currently the dominant lineage in this
part of the world [20,23]. It is possible that CRF02’s
high prevalence in Africa is explained by its long presence in the epidemic. Comparing the genetic diversity
within CRF02 to that occurring within pure subtypes,
Carr et al. suggested that CRF02 may be as old as the
pure subtypes [24]. A recent study proposed the idea
that CRF02_AG was a parent of subtype G [25], rather
than subtype A and G being parental strains of CRF02.
CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC are the most common BC
recombinants. CRF07 was first identified in the Xinjiang
province of China in 1997 [18,21,26,27], and it is
believed to have migrated to Xinjiang along a northern
drug trafficking route [26,28]. CRF08 is a predominant
subtype among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in
Guangxi and the east part of the Yunnan province in
China [26,29]. Both CRFs presumably originated in Yunnan where subtypes B and C were co-circulating in the
early 1990s [30-33], or in Myanmar and then imported
from there into China [34-37]. It has not been established whether other BC recombinants in Myanmar and
China are epidemiologically linked to the CRF07 and
CRF08 HIV-1 epidemic in Southern China [38,39].
BF recombinants in South America are dominated by
a large number of recombinants with unique breakpoint
patterns, URFs http://www.hiv.lanl.gov, geography page.
The BF epidemic in this region is characterized by two
genetic centers. One is represented by CRF12_BF and
related genomes that are more frequently found in
Argentina; and the other by CRF28_BF, CRF29_BF and
a collection of BF URFs that have been found in Brazil
[40]. The origin of BF recombinants in South America
is not clear, but it appears that at least one of the main
introductory routes of HIV-1 into South America was
through Brazil [41].
Accurate virus genotyping and recombination identification techniques are important for many reasons,
including epidemiological tracking, targeting vaccines to
regional epidemics, understanding the evolutionary trajectory of the virus, and defining potential phenotypic
differences in different subtypes or inter-subtype recombinants [42]. Here we report results from a large-scale

Page 2 of 15

subtyping study of 9435 sequences that includes subtypes A, B, C, G, F, and CRFs and URFs exclusively
composed of subtypes A and G, or B and C, or B and F.
These sequences include all circulating recombinant
forms dominating three epidemically important regions:
West and West Central Africa, southern China, and
South America. A series of detailed analyses were performed to ensure genotyping quality. Therefore, our
analyses can provide a more comprehensive image of
the current HIV epidemics in these three geographic
regions. We demonstrate strong evidence that the
recombinant lineages that are highly prevalent in the
current HIV epidemic are a mixture of ancient and
recent recombinant lineages. The dynamic HIV epidemic is moving toward having increasing complexity
and higher prevalence of recombinant forms. Finally we
suggest that a revision of some CRFs may be needed.

Results
Genotyping results and comparisons to the original
subtype assignments suggest that a revision of some CRF
designations may be needed

In total, we genotyped 9435 near full-length and
sequence fragments obtained from the Los Alamos HIV
sequence database and compared our results to the subtype assignments derived from the original literature
(Table 1). Overall, 4.9% of the subtype assignments were
inconsistent. The number of inconsistent assignments
were unevenly distributed among sequence lengths such
that shorter fragments more often than near full-length
sequences disagreed: Among BC recombinants, 59.6% of
the sequence fragments were assigned differently in our
results as compared to the original author assignments
(Table 1, BC column). This difference is, however, not
as dramatic as it may seem. For example, all literatureassigned CRF08 sequence fragments were assigned as
pure subtypes in our results - in one case subtype B and
in the rest subtype C. Given that it is difficult to resolve
the subtype in un-sequenced regions outside a sequence
fragment, it becomes a philosophical nomenclature
question of which assignment is best for sequence fragments embedded in a genomic region that is spanned
by just one subtype constituting the locally prevalent
CRF, i.e., to assign a sequence fragment with “CRF08”,
“C” or “B”. When the HIV nomenclature procedures
were first outlined [17], for the sake of consistency,
there was a decision to use the subtype designation
when a fragment was too short to span known breakpoints for CRFs. Thus the convention we use assigns
the sequences based on the available information, e.g., a
C fragment should be assigned as “C” even if it is suggested that CRF08 is known to be common in the geographic region where the sequence was isolated and
even if the C is closer to the C in CRF08 rather than to

1. Problematic sequences are those that could not be unequivocally assigned. They meet one of the following criteria: 1) Contain an unusually high content of
IUPAC code N (defined as > 100 continuous Ns, or > 7% N for sequences of length < 1000 nt, or > 5% N for sequences of length 1000-2999, or > 3% N for
sequences of length 3000 or above); 2) Contain an artifactual deletion of > 100 nt.
2. Classification of the sequences was compared between the database assignments (of which the majority were extracted from the literature) and the jpHMM
predictions.

a pure C (note also that this distinction often cannot be
made with confidence). Finally, unless the whole genome is sequenced one cannot know what the classification is in uninvestigated regions. Thus, in agreement
with the original HIV nomenclature proposal we have
assigned fragments to their closest subtypes (or CRF)
but not guessed what the rest of the genome is.
Next, all near full-length AG, BC, and BF recombinants were grouped into common groups if the
sequences had similar genomic structures and breakpoints (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). Our results suggested that
revisions of some CRF designations may be needed. For
instance, some database-assigned BF CRF sequences in
this analysis appear to be unique BF URFs with atypical
breakpoints (Fig. 3). In case of CRF17, two previous
sequences (accession number: AY037275 and
AY037277) were assigned as CRF17 prototype
sequences. They were, however, epidemiologically linked
[43]. Another 7 sequences of CRF17 (mostly unpublished) have now been made available. These sequences
consist of related, but not identical, recombinant forms
that could be described as a “family” of recombinants
(see further discussion on this topic).
The CRF and URF sequences described below refer to
the sequences confirmed by our jpHMM genotyping
results.
CRF02 is a recombinant lineage with both early
and more recent recombination events involving
subtypes A1 and G

To examine the evolutionary relationships among
recombinants that are exclusively composed of subtypes

A and G, as well as their relationships with all
sequences of pure subtypes A and G, we performed
phylogenetic analyses in eight sub-regions (Fig. 4,
Regions I-VIII) delimited by the shared breakpoints of
most full-length AG sequences depicted in Figure 1.
IBNG is considered a prototype strain of CRF02, and
was found representative of the most common AG-lineage (Group 1, Fig. 1). Other sequences, however, did not
cluster with the same subtype as IBNG in all studied
genomic regions, indicating subsequent secondary
recombination events with other A and G viruses. Interestingly, some genomic regions suggest that CRF02 is an
old recombinant derived from representatives of subtypes A and G that are similar to the most recent common ancestor of the two clades. There, the CRF02 clade
is a sibling lineage to contemporary subtype A and G
sequences, branching nearest to, but outside of, the
clade based on more current sequences (Fig. 4. Sibling
of A in Regions I, III and sibling of G in Region II). The
topologies of the trees also suggested that the current
CRF02 has undergone multiple recombination events,
and some genomic regions of the first generation of
CRF02 sequences were replaced by more recent
sequences (Fig. 4. CRF02 is a descendent lineage of A in
Regions V, VI, and a descendent lineage of G in Region
VII). To assess whether sibling and descendent phylogenetic classifications indicate older and more recent fragments, respectively, we analyzed the correlation between
sampling time point and the height of taxa from its
subtype most recent common ancestor (sMRCA). The
largest subtype G fragment (Region II) was sampled
in 1991-2002 (N = 39 taxa) and showed a correlation of

Figure 1 Genome maps of all near full-length sequences composed exclusively of subtypes A and G. AG recombinants were classified
into 4 groups and 22 URFs. A group is defined as a set of sequences (>1) that have identical breakpoints. The genomic compositions and
breakpoint positions were computed by the jpHMM program as described in Materials and Methods. The 22 URFs were originally assigned as
CRF02 in 15 cases and different AG recombinants in 7 cases. They were sampled in CM (n = 10), GH (3), NG (2), SN (2), BE (1), CD (1), KE (1), SE
(1), and US (1). “Sampling Country” is abbreviated by ISO standard 2-letter codes [AR: Argentina. BE: Belgium, BO: Bolivia, BR: Brazil, CD: Dem Rep

literature-assigned subtypes. In parenthesis are the numbers of sequences.

R = 0.41 between sampling time and tip height from its
sMRCA (P < 0.01, F-test, linear regression). Likewise,
the largest subtype A1 fragment (Region VI) which
was sampled in 1985-2003 (N = 102 taxa) had R = 0.50
(P < 0.01, F-test, linear regression). Note that the correlation coefficient (R) is not dependent on the molecular
clock being a constant rate clock, only that branches get
longer with time; the P value does however depend on a
linear trend estimation. Thus, our phylogenetic assignments of “old” and “new” are supported by the correlation between sampling time and growth of tip height
from the respective sMRCA. The alignment quality was
fairly even in terms of gap counts and the genetic

diversity followed expected gene patterns (Additional
file 1, Fig S1).
In agreement with our results, such second generation
recombinants have been noted by others to be common
[44]. Of particular interest, a recent argument, based on
an analysis of Region IV suggests that CRF02 is a pure
subtype and is a parent of the contemporary G clade
which is the recombinant. This is in contrast to the
current HIV nomenclature which suggests that the G
clade is the parent and CRF02 the recombinant [25]. To
clarify the confusing but critical argument, we investigated all CRF02 and G sequences derived from the
Los Alamos HIV sequence database. While our tree

suggested that CRF02 was inside the G clade in Region
IV, there was no bootstrap support for this classification.
Importantly, besides Region IV, the rest of the genome
fragments (both A1 and G) had better bootstrap support
and clearly indicated that G is a subtype and CRF02 a
recombinant (Fig 4). Furthermore, a RIP analysis
attempting to resolve the origin of Region IV (and
others) showed that CRF02 was closer to a G maximum
likelihood-inferred ancestor (G.anc) than to a G consensus of contemporary sequences (G.con) (CRF02 to G.
anc = 0.0178 substitutions/site, and CRF02 to G.con =
0.0218 substitutions/site) (Fig 4B). The likelihood was

p < 10-8 that G.anc and G.con were the same (2ΔlnL =
34.5, general-time-reversible model with 9 site rates),
but there were only two positions that differed in
Region IV and thus this result should be interpreted
with caution. For instance, the underlying model parameters could change if new sequences were included in
the inference, potentially changing the state probabilities
and the site likelihoods. Nevertheless, for Region IV, at
this point the difference between G.anc and G.con are
significant, CRF02 was found overall closer to G.anc,
and at the two positions G.anc and G.con differed
CRF02 was identical to G.anc, all together suggesting a

more ancient origin of CRF02 Region IV. Also note that
the RIP analysis showed that Region IV has the least
power to resolve the phylogenetic classification of the
CRF02 genome, because this region has the smallest
amount of divergence (Fig 4B). This also explains the
poor bootstrap support in Region IV tree. Further,
although the sequences are highly similar, the maximum
likelihood estimates of ancestral sequences of clades A

and G should reflect better the ancestral state of the
clade, incorporating phylogenetic information from the
full M group tree, while the consensus sequences
derived from contemporary A and G isolates slightly
favors contemporary forms. Thus, the RIP analysis
further supported the tree results that some sections of
the CRF02 genome may have involved old recombination events from a time when the clades were beginning

to diverge, and that some other regions were more likely
to have involved more recent subtype A and G
sequences. To avoid potential problems with the uncertainty of breakpoint locations, we also phylogenetically
analyzed smaller sub-regions of the larger regions (I’, II’,
and VI’) and found consistent results with the presented
larger region analyses. In conclusion, taken all regions of
the CRF02 genome into account, our analyses show that
CRF02 is a recombinant of both ancient and more
recent A and G parents.

The Chinese BC-recombinant epidemic was formed locally
with limited contacts with most other Asian countries

To characterize the relationships of BC recombinants
from China, Asia, and worldwide, we first investigated
the relationship between CRF07 and CRF08. Full-length
sequences classified as CRF07, CRF08, or BC were
grouped according to their breakpoint structures (Fig.
2), and ML trees were constructed for sub-regions
delimited by all CRF07 and CRF08 sequences (Fig. 5).
While most of the examined sub-regions showed a

sibling relationship between CRF07 and CRF08, two
sub-regions (HXB2 positions 794-2064 and 2547-2846)
suggested that, at least in these sub-regions, CRF08 may
be the parent of CRF07 because CRF07 sequences were
clustered inside the CRF08 clade (bootstrap support ≥
70%). Further, CRF07 and CRF08 were derived from
multiple recombination events, as indicated by unequal
breakpoint frequencies in CRF07 and CRF08 (Fig. 6, top
panels). The breakpoint at HXB2 position 8866 was
consistent among CRF07, CRF08, and subsequent
recombinants, and thus was likely to be introduced into
CRF07 and CRF08 through a common ancestor.
To investigate BC recombinants from China and China’s neighboring countries, phylogenetic analyses were
performed on consensus sub-regions delimited by most
near-full-length BC recombinants shown in Figure 2.
There was a close relationship between Yunnan B and
Myanmar B (data not shown). Sequences from these
two geographic regions are very limited (6 BC sequences
from Yunnan and 2 from Myanmar), therefore we cannot deduce the direction of the epidemic movement
between Yunnan and Myanmar.
Finally, the influence of worldwide B and C epidemics
on the Chinese BC recombinants was analyzed. As
described in the Materials and Methods, the global set
of subtype B and C sequences was retrieved from the
HIV database in the genomic regions that had the longest subtype B and the longest C sub-regions shared by
all CRF07, CRF08, and most near full-length BC recombinants. In the subtype B sub-region tree, sequences
from China appeared to be a local epidemic only

involving neighboring countries Thailand and Myanmar
(Additional file 1 Fig. S2A); this occurred possibly
through drug trafficking routes [26,28]. Other Asian
countries, for instance, Korea, Japan, and Thailand,
appeared to have greater subtype B diversity, which may
be explained by more frequent contacts with each other
and with the rest of the world. Finally, South American
subtype B seems to have had multiple HIV introductions from Europe and North America. The result of the
subtype C sub-region tree also suggested that China C is
a mostly local epidemic, with some influx of subtype C
from India, but not Africa as India has (Additional file
1, Fig. S2B). Finally, the dominant South American C
epidemic appears to have derived from a single introduction from Africa ([45,46] and Additional file 1,
Fig. S2).
Contemporary Argentinean and Brazilian HIV epidemics
are not independent

Our study did not show any association between risk
factors and BF CRF groups (Fig. 3). In the breakpoint
frequency analyses of full-length BF sequences (Figure 6,
BF panels) and BF sequence fragments (Additional file
1, Fig. S3) all identified BF breakpoints were found in
more than one country in South America, and occasionally in countries from other continents. This suggests
that, although the South American HIV epidemic is
represented by two distinctive epicenters, the BF epidemic has moved back and forth between Argentina
and Brazil. Indeed, the BF recombinant sequence fragments carry all the information that fills the gap in the

full-genome sequences from Argentina and Brazil such
that all genomic regions of B and F can be found in
either country. We also found that sequence V62 (accession number AY536236), which has an epidemiological
linkage to the Argentinean epidemic [47], had the same
genomic structure and breakpoints as CRF28, which was
first described in Brazil. In all, the HIV epidemics in
Argentina and Brazil are not independent.
We did not find evidence that Argentinean B and F
were derived from Brazil, as previously suggested
[47,48]. The result of the phylogenetic analyses, which
agreed with previous publications [40,49,50] and thus
not shown here, demonstrated that B and F fragments
of the jpHMM-confirmed CRF12, CRF28, and CRF29
were inter-mingled, and therefore could not support a
single direction of HIV-1 flow. Also, as already mentioned, we found that Argentinean B and F sequence
fragments in the HIV database can cover a full HIV-1
genome of each subtype, meaning that there was a
potential to form any BF recombinants in Argentina and
that there was no need to assume that already-recombined genomes came from Brazil. In addition, a recently
identified near full-length Argentinean pure F sequence,
ARE933 (accession number DQ189088), was found to
be closer to Argentinean BF than were any other F
strains [41,51]. The most likely scenario is that there
were HIV-1 transmissions in both directions, with
recombination of circulating strains in all countries
involved.

Discussion
The geographic distribution of subtypes and recombinant lineages in any epidemic, influenced by local epidemiological factors, is dynamic and difficult to resolve.
Here we present a large-scale subtyping re-analysis of
9435 HIV-1 sequences that involve subtypes A, B, C, G,
F, and their important CRFs in three different epidemiological settings that together have significantly shaped
today’s global HIV epidemic. Our comprehensive analyses demonstrate strong evidence that the contemporary HIV-1 epidemic is a mixture of recombinants that
had an origin in the early HIV epidemic, likely before
the subtypes were distinctively separated, while others
are of more recent origin, and that shared breakpoints
can be used for tracking patterns in the epidemic.
We found that CRF02 is a recombinant more complex
than previously described. Its old origin, as well as the
subsequent recombination events that occurred prior to
the establishment of the contemporary CRF02 lineage,
can easily confound the analysis of CRF02. Among the
BC recombinants we found that the BC epidemic in
China is unique compared to most other Asian countries; further, CRF07 and CRF08 were recently introduced to the epidemic, but both have undergone

multiple recombination events. The study of BF recombinants in South Africa suggests that the HIV-1 epidemics in Argentina and Brazil are not independent.
The existence of early lineages in the current HIV-1
epidemic imposes a great challenge in detecting some
recombinant sequences. Figure 7 shows a cartoon
describing some of the difficulties described in this
paper (e.g. CRF02) and also some effects of extinct (e.g.
subtype “E”) and undiscovered lineages. In addition to
recombination effects, co-evolution of some sequence
positions, for example due to fitness constrains and
HLA-imposed immune pressure, gives rise to distinct
but potentially convergent patterns of immune escape
that can also confound recombination analyses by introducing homoplasy. Sometimes the history of old lineages
can be recovered by extrapolating backward from surviving viruses (like subtype E [52,53]), while some
lineages presumably can never be found (like lineage
“X” in Fig. 7). In this context, it is likely that [some of]
the current pure subtypes are actually recombinants that
were formed a long time ago, but because the “pure”
parental lineages have been lost, we cannot trace their
origin. Thus the current subtype nomenclature does not
rest on the assumption that currently defined “pure”
subtypes are not consequences of earlier recombination
events, but rather indicates that these subtypes can be
used as good background references in studying the current HIV-1 epidemic, and that the “pure” subtypes’ relative genetic relatedness can provide a basis for studying
and understanding the immunological consequences of
diversity for vaccine design. Unfortunately, almost all
existing genotyping tools are not well designed to infer
old recombination events or for those that involve
unknown parents.
The dynamic HIV-1 epidemic seems to have moved
toward to have more complex recombinants. However
the driving force may be different in different epidemiological settings. In Africa where the HIV epidemic is
predominantly driven by heterosexual transmissions, the
ancient history of CRF02 as described in this paper,
together with its high replicative capacity [54,55] and its
high prevalence [56], make CRF02 an active participant
in generating more and new complex recombinants, for
instance, the newly identified CRF36_cpx [57]. BC
recombinants in China will likely also continue to
evolve. Super-infection of CRF07 and CRF08 viruses
[28], as well as continuous influx of B and C into
Yunnan from China’s surrounding countries [58,59],
contributes greatly to the emergence of new BC recombinants, notably BC URFs. Another important driving
force of BC evolution in China is the rapid transition in
the HIV-1 epidemic in some geographical regions. In
Yunnan alone, subtype B was found to be the dominant
subtype in the late 1980s, but it was soon replaced by

Figure 7 The current HIV-1 epidemic is a mixture of old and contemporary lineages. The dashed circle differentiates old and
contemporary sequences. Inside the circle, the old sequences, such as the subtype E clade, may no longer exist in the current epidemic. We can
only infer the ancient presence of subtype E based on CRF01_AE, a recombinant between subtype A and E. “X” represents a hypothetical extinct
strain, “Y” represents a hypothetical old strain that is still circulating in the current epidemic, but hasn’t been identified. CRF02 is an old
recombinant derived from both old and contemporary subtype A and G. BF recombinants in South America and BC in China are new, as their
parents are contemporary sequences. The black blobs (recombinants) and grey blobs ("pure” subtypes) are clades investigated in this paper, and
white blobs are other HIV-1 clades.

Thai B; in 1992, subtype C was found in this region,
thus Thai B and C co-circulated; in 1994, CRF01 was
identified in Yunnan; in 2000 and 2001, subtype C was
not detected among IDU samples in the same region
[28,30,37,58]. While some of these transitions in the
regional prevalence might have been a consequence of
sampling biases, they still suggest complex patterns of
epidemic dynamics. BF recombinants in South America
are possibly moving toward having more URFs. A recent
Bayesian hierarchical analysis also indicated extensive
ongoing recombination among CRF12 viruses [60]. The
long circulation record of subtypes B and F in South
America [43,61,62], and the tight HIV-1 transmission
networks with high incidence rates found in some South
American geographical regions may favor an elevated
number of dual- and super-infections [48]. A possible
outcome of this dynamic pattern is that pure subtype F

may disappear after being gradually diluted from the
South American epidemic. Hence, social network structures and possibly viral factors dictate the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 [63]; and tracking the genetic
lineages and patterns in recombination breakpoints can
shed light on such factors.
Current CRF nomenclature requires all sequences of
one CRF to have identical or very similar breakpoints,
and thus originate from a single lineage of a recombinant form. Such breakpoints may, however, be easily
blurred by subsequent substitutions and by further
recombination events, as in the CRF02 and CRF17 cases
described above. Hence, the sequences defined in a CRF
are merely snapshots of the dynamic changes in HIV-1
evolution. This may cause problems when “new” CRFs
are identified, which may be related to existing CRFs
and not fit into meaningful groupings used for

Zhang et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:25
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/25

molecular epidemiology or vaccine design. It is questionable if the continuous use of these soon to be unmanageable number of CRFs will be useful to the HIV
research community. Hence, we propose to define
sequence “families” that would contain recombinant
sequences composed of the same subtypes, but the
sequences’ genomic structures and breakpoints may not
be identical due to successive recombination events or
our inability to accurately describe them. Sequences
would belong to one family as long as they are closer to
a defined central strain of that family than to any other
family, including “pure” subtypes, like the examples
shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3. Each family would be defined by
a central sequetype and the radius of family members
would depend on distances in a multi-dimensional
sequence space. Membership to a family could be based
on overall similarity and, if needed, be further assessed
by multidimensional scaling. Using such a “family” concept makes it feasible to dynamically track HIV diversity
and epidemiologically important families over evolutionary time, regardless of their precise phylogenetic history.

Conclusions
Our large-scale re-subtyping meta-study provides a
comprehensive view of HIV recombinants in three epidemically important regions. The dynamic HIV epidemic is moving toward having increasing complexity
and higher prevalence of recombinant forms and it has
posed a great challenge in many aspects of the HIV/
AIDS epidemic. We suggest that a revision of some
CRFs may be needed. As we continue to systematically
re-subtype the rest of the sequences in the Los Alamos
sequence database, it is likely that our results will shed
light on the impact of evolving HIV recombinants. This
will give better database search results and may thus
affect vaccine design and molecular epidemiology
studies.
Methods
Sequences

The following sequence sets were retrieved from the Los
Alamos HIV sequence database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov
sequence database search interface). Set 1: All near fulllength sequences (>7000 nucleotides [nt]) of subtypes A,
B, C, F, G, CRF02, CRF07, CRF08, CRF12, CRF17,
CRF28, CRF29, and all URFs composed exclusively of
subtypes A and G, or B and C, or B and F. Set 2:
Shorter HIV sequences (300 - 7000 nt) that are BC
recombinants from Asia and BF recombinants from
South America. Set 3: After examining all full-length BC
recombinant genomes, we defined the longest subtype B
segment (HXB2 positions 3497-4473) and the longest
subtype C region (HXB2 positions 6582-7349). For additional BC analyses, sequences covering these two

Page 12 of 15

fragments were retrieved from the database for all geographic regions worldwide. To avoid redundancy and
reduce issues related to non-independence of data
points, only 1 sequence per patient was included in the
analyses of the sequence fragments. The analysis
method used for Set 3 sequences, however, is not
applicable to the AG and BF sequences due to the difficulties in obtaining accurate breakpoints (which is the
case of CRF02; its old origin leads to fuzzy breakpoints)
and in getting big enough genome regions (this is the
case of South American BF in which URFs outnumber
CRFs).
To examine further whether the risk factors contribute
to the spread of BF URFs in South America, the associated risk factor of the near full-length BF recombinant
sequences from South America was also retrieved from
the database.
All sequences were aligned with HIV-1 subtype reference sequences (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov sequence alignment page) using GeneCutter (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov
GeneCutter page). Alignment quality was checked
manually in BioEdit [64] to ensure that the alignments
did not contain obvious problems and that they were
correctly codon aligned.
Recombination detection

Our jumping profile hidden Markov model (jpHMM)
program [65,66] was used to analyze the subtype assignment of all sequences retrieved. In jpHMM, each HIV-1
subtype is represented by a profile hidden Markov
model. All profile models are connected by empirical
probabilities, allowing the detection of possible recombinants and related breakpoints by jumping from one profile to another. jpHMM performs best in predicting
recombinants that involve subtypes that have had adequate sampling to build well-informed profiles, i.e., it is
less effective for subtypes H, J, and K, because so few
full-length genome sequences are available (N = 3, 3,
and 2, respectively). In the present study, jpHMM was
used to detect the recombination patterns in recombinants that are composed exclusively of subtypes A and
G, B and C, or B and F; each of these subtypes has
enough data to form a good model of sequence variation. For the recombinants detected, jpHMM provides
detailed information about subtype composition and
well-resolved breakpoint locations. The jpHMM source
code is available at the jpHMM Web interface http://
jphmm.gobics.de.
Phylogenetic analyses

The near full-length sequences were grouped together if
the sequences had similar subtype composition and
breakpoint patterns. Sub-genomic regions delimited by
shared breakpoints in the majority of AG recombinants

Zhang et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:25
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/25

(including jpHMM-confirmed CRF02 and AG URFs)
were further analyzed using phylogenetic inference, discriminating between parental, descendent and sibling
relationships. Initial screens of regions involving thousands of taxa, for example the global collection of the
largest identified B and C genomic sub-regions in all
near full-length BC recombinants (Set 3), were performed using PAUP neighbor joining with an F84
model [67]. More refined resolution of B and C recombinants, and all other primary trees involving subregions delimited by shared jpHMM-confirmed breakpoints, were done using PhyML with a GTR-Gamma
model, enabling very large datasets to be analyzed phylogenetically [68]. The statistical robustness and the
reliability of the notable clustering patterns in the ML
trees were further evaluated by non-parametric bootstrap analyses in PAUP (neighbor-joining, F84 model,
1000 replicates). A bootstrap value of ≥ 70% was considered significant for subtype clustering [69].
Further analysis of CRF02 origin

The Recombination Identification Program version 3
(http://www.hiv.lanl.gov RIP3 page) was used along with
likelihood trees to examine the relationship between
CRF02 and contemporary sequences relative to maximum likelihood inferred ancestor sequences of subtypes
A and G: A CRF02 consensus sequence was analyzed
against an alignment that included ML-inferred ancestral sequences [70] (M group, A1, and G) and consensus
sequences (M group, A1, and G). The CRF02 consensus
was constructed based on the CRF02 sequences sets
confirmed by jpHMM and phylogenetic analysis. Other
consensus and ancestral sequences were retrieved from
the HIV sequence database alignment page. All consensus and ancestral sequences were aligned using GeneCutter, followed by manual editing.
Breakpoint frequency calculations

Systematic breakpoint frequency calculations were performed on the following three sequence alignments:
near full-length BC and BF recombinant sequences;
fragments of BC recombinant sequences from Asia; and
fragments of BF recombinant sequences from South
America. The sequence subtyping and recombination
patterns were derived from jpHMM analyses. The
breakpoint frequencies of all sequences in each alignment were calculated and plotted. In BC CRFs, > 95% of
the breakpoints were located within 16 nt from the
breakpoint median. In BF CRFs, > 95% of the breakpoints were located within 98 nt from the breakpoint
median. These two numbers (16 nt and 98 nt) were
used as breakpoint confidence regions for subsequent
analyses of BC and BF recombinants, respectively, to
provide boundaries for defining shared breakpoints.
