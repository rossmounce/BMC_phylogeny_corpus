A supermatrix analysis of genomic,
morphological, and paleontological data from
crown Cetacea
Jonathan H Geisler1*, Michael R McGowen2,3, Guang Yang4 and John Gatesy2

Abstract
Background: Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises, and whales) is a clade of aquatic species that includes the most
massive, deepest diving, and largest brained mammals. Understanding the temporal pattern of diversification in
the group as well as the evolution of cetacean anatomy and behavior requires a robust and well-resolved
phylogenetic hypothesis. Although a large body of molecular data has accumulated over the past 20 years, DNA
sequences of cetaceans have not been directly integrated with the rich, cetacean fossil record to reconcile
discrepancies among molecular and morphological characters.
Results: We combined new nuclear DNA sequences, including segments of six genes (~2800 basepairs) from the
functionally extinct Yangtze River dolphin, with an expanded morphological matrix and published genomic data.
Diverse analyses of these data resolved the relationships of 74 taxa that represent all extant families and 11 extinct
families of Cetacea. The resulting supermatrix (61,155 characters) and its sub-partitions were analyzed using
parsimony methods. Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) searches were conducted on the molecular partition,
and a molecular scaffold obtained from these searches was used to constrain a parsimony search of the
morphological partition. Based on analysis of the supermatrix and model-based analyses of the molecular partition,
we found overwhelming support for 15 extant clades. When extinct taxa are included, we recovered trees that are
significantly correlated with the fossil record. These trees were used to reconstruct the timing of cetacean
diversification and the evolution of characters shared by “river dolphins,” a non-monophyletic set of species
according to all of our phylogenetic analyses.
Conclusions: The parsimony analysis of the supermatrix and the analysis of morphology constrained to fit the ML/
Bayesian molecular tree yielded broadly congruent phylogenetic hypotheses. In trees from both analyses, all
Oligocene taxa included in our study fell outside crown Mysticeti and crown Odontoceti, suggesting that these
two clades radiated in the late Oligocene or later, contra some recent molecular clock studies. Our trees also imply
that many character states shared by river dolphins evolved in their oceanic ancestors, contradicting the
hypothesis that these characters are convergent adaptations to fluvial habitats.

Background
It has been 12 years since the publication of Messenger
and McGuire [1], the first major effort to develop a phylogenetic hypothesis for crown Cetacea (Neoceti) based
on a combined phylogenetic analysis of morphological
and molecular characters (Figure 1A). Since that time,

the amount of molecular data published on cetaceans
has increased by more than two orders of magnitude,
the number of relevant morphological characters has
increased ~50%, while advances in computer applications and analytical methods now enable large-scale
phylogenetic analyses that could not be completed in
1998. Although the Messenger and McGuire [1] study
was groundbreaking, some of their morphological characters and observations have been disputed [2]. In addition, the only extinct cetacean included in their study
was a composite outgroup taxon, Archaeoceti, despite

Continued from Figure 1. Topologies based on molecules (P-Z) are shown. River dolphin lineages are colored red, and other branches are

the fact that Cetacea has a rich fossil record [3]. Given
these developments and the wide range of topologies
supported by subsequent morphological [4-11] (Figure
1D-I), molecular [12-24] (Figure 1J-O, Figure 2P-Z), and
combined analyses [20,25] (Figure 1B-C), a second look
at cetacean phylogeny using a concatenation of

morphological and molecular characters from both living and extinct taxa is long overdue.
In the absence of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for
Cetacea that includes extant and extinct taxa, molecular
systematists have used DNA-based clocks to time
branching events within Cetacea (e.g, [24]). To date,

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

these molecular clock studies have produced estimates
for speciation events that vary widely. For example, Cassens et al. [13] suggested that the split between Kogiidae
(pygmy and dwarf sperm whales) and Physeteridae
(giant sperm whale) occurred approximately 37 Ma
(million years ago) whereas recent dating analyses produced much younger estimates, from means of 22 Ma
[21] to 24 Ma [20]. Many calibration points in molecular
clock studies of Cetacea have been based on extinct taxa
that have not been included in rigorous phylogenetic
analyses of character matrices, which may explain in
part the wide range of published divergence dates. In
these cases, molecular systematists have had to trust the
opinions of paleontologists regarding relationships of
these extinct taxa to extant cetaceans [20-22,24]. A reliance on expert opinions is understandable given the
absence of rigorous phylogenetic studies of fossils. However, a more comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis
that directly combines molecular data and fossils is
required to rigorously estimate the timing of cetacean
diversification, to test divergence times based on molecular clocks, and also to develop more reliable calibration points for subsequent molecular clock studies.
Messenger and McGuire [1] focused on the apparent
conflict between molecular data, which at the time supported paraphyly of Odontoceti [26,27], and morphological data, which strongly supported odontocete
monophyly [5,28]. Since 1998, additional morphological
support for Odontoceti has been presented [2], while
the balance of molecular studies, in particular insertions
of transposons [15,29], mitochondrial (mt) genomes (e.
g., [30]), and nuclear (nu) DNA sequences (e.g., [31]),
now support odontocete monophyly. Messenger and
McGuire [1] found relatively low bootstrap support for
most higher-level clades within Odontoceti, including
nodes defining the branching sequence of taxa collectively referred to as “river dolphins.” River dolphins
include odontocetes that share long, narrow rostra, an
elongate and fused mandibular symphysis, and numerous teeth in the upper and lower jaws [32]. These taxa
also are characterized by a flexible neck, broad forelimb
flippers, and eyes that are reduced relative to most
extant cetaceans [13,33]. Four of these species are
restricted to rivers; Ganges and Indus River dolphins
(Platanista gangetica, P. minor), the functionally extinct
Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer), and the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis); whereas one, the
franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei), occurs in coastal/
estuarine waters off of Eastern South America. Although
molecular data for Lipotes and Pontoporia were not
available at the time of the Messenger and McGuire [1]
study, subsequently published DNA sequences for these
two taxa [13,17], as well as new sequences for Platanista
and Inia [14,20,30], have not led to a consensus on river

Page 4 of 33

dolphin relationships (Figures 1, 2). A synthesis of these
diverse data and new character evidence are necessary
to determine which signals emerge as the strongest in
combined analysis of all relevant phylogenetic data.
Skeletal similarities among river dolphins were long
thought to be evidence of their monophyly [6,34],
although the presence of a vestibular sac off the nasal
passage [4] and some basicranial sinus features [35] ally
Lipotes, Inia, and in some cases Pontoporia with Delphinoidea, the clade that includes porpoises and oceanic
dolphins. If extant river dolphins are monophyletic, and
if their affinity for freshwater is an ancestral trait, then
their far-flung distribution can be explained by river
hopping, analogous to the widely recognized biogeographic process of island hopping [2]. However, this scenario is now unwarranted given that recent molecular
data strongly support river dolphin paraphyly or polyphyly [13-15,17,20,21]. Instead, Hamilton et al. [14] suggested that Cenozoic changes in sea level essentially
stranded the ancestors of extant river dolphins in different river systems, where they subsequently developed
intolerance to salt water on at least three occasions. It
also has been suggested that the scarcity of close extant
relatives to river dolphins in the oceans is the result of
past competition with extinct members of Delphinoidea
in the marine environment [13,15]. In developing these
scenarios, molecular workers frequently referred to
extinct taxa thought to be close relatives of extant river
dolphins; however, their hypotheses were seriously hampered by the fact that there is still no published phylogenetic hypothesis based on molecular and morphological
characters that includes extensive sampling of both
extant and extinct odontocete taxa. Until such a joint
study is completed, hypotheses that explain the distribution of extant river dolphins will remain highly
speculative.
The main objectives of the current study are: 1) to
derive a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for crown Cetacea that is based on a supermatrix analysis of both
genomic and paleontological data, 2) to allocate, for the
first time, many extinct crown cetaceans to clades with
extant members in the context of molecular data, and to
discuss the temporal implications of these allocations for
the radiation of crown Odontoceti and crown Mysticeti,
and 3) to use our integrated supermatrix analysis of
molecules, morphology, and fossils to reconstruct the
biogeographic history of river dolphins and the evolution of skeletal features shared by these species. Our
combined dataset merges published data with newly
generated morphological and molecular characters,
including six nu gene fragments (~2,800 basepairs) for
the Yangtze River dolphin, a species that has been difficult to place in previous systematic studies. Unlike previous systematic studies that have sampled nearly all

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

extant species of Cetacea [18-21,24,25], the present
study takes a different approach. Speciose extant families
are represented by multiple taxa, all other extant
families are represented by at least one species, and
nearly all extinct families of crown Cetacea are sampled
for at least one exemplar (Table 1).

Phylogenetic Hypotheses Based on Fossils and Molecules

The primary focus of this study was to produce phylogenetic hypotheses for crown group Cetacea that incorporate extensive character information from both fossils
and molecules. First, we executed separate analyses of
morphological and molecular datasets to record phylogenetic patterns. Then, we analyzed the combined database in a parsimony supermatrix context and executed
an analysis of the morphological data constrained to fit
the ML/Bayesian molecular tree.
The morphological dataset includes 304 characters
with a focus on variation in the skull region (Figure 3).
Parsimony analysis of the morphology partition yielded
four minimum length trees, each 1743.78 steps in length
(Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In describing the results of
our analyses, we use an unranked classification scheme
that is new to this study (Table 1), but heavily influenced by several previous phylogenetic hypotheses and
classifications [2,3,36,37]. As in an analysis of an earlier
version of the morphological partition [2], monophyly of
Mysticeti, Odontoceti, Inioidea, and Physteridae + Kogiidae (Physeteroidea) was supported. However, unlike that
earlier work, Delphinoidea and Inioidea + Delphinoidea
also were supported, as in many molecular studies
[15,17,18]. Our greater taxonomic sampling of delphinidans, as compared to that of Geisler and Sanders [2],
allowed us to test several traditional families and subfamilies of Cetacea. We found support for monophyly of
Delphinidae, Phocoenidae, and Delphininae. Although
many nodes are shared among the trees supported by
morphology and those favored by molecules, areas of
disagreement remain. The morphological partition supported several groupings found by previous morphological studies but contradicted by most molecular studies,
including Balaenoidea [2,38,39], Physeteroidea + Ziphiidae [2,9,10], Platanista + Lipotes [2], and the grouping
of Orcinus orca within Globicephalinae [6]. We also
found morphological support for two novel groupings,
Balaenoidea + Balaenopteridae and Monodontidae +
Delphinidae. A parsimony analysis with implied weighting of characters (Additional file 1: Fig. S2; [40]) and a
Bayesian analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S3) produced
broadly similar topologies. These additional analyses of
the morphological partition support monophyly of Mysticeti, Balaenoidea, Odontoceti, Physeteroidea, Ziphiidae,
Inioidea, Delphinoidea, and Inioidea + Delphinoidea.

Most notably, a clade including all extant odontocetes,
but excluding all Oligocene taxa, was supported by a
posterior probability (PP) of 0.96. Most higher-level relationships within the odontocete crown group were not
well supported in the Bayesian analysis (PP < 0.95), and
as in the parsimony analysis with implied weights,
Monodontidae fell among the delphinids as the sistergroup to Orcaella (Additional file 1: Figs. S2, S3).
The molecular partition includes mt genomes, transposon insertions, and segments of 69 nu loci that are distributed across the different chromosomes of the cow genome
(Figure 3; Additional file 2: Table S1). Bayesian and ML
analyses of the combined molecular data yielded identical
trees (Figure 4A), and a Bayesian search in which the
molecular dataset was partitioned by gene gave the same
basic topology with similar support scores (not shown).
The ML/Bayesian topology was congruent with the Bayesian consensus in a recent molecular supermatrix analysis
[20] except that the positions of two delphinid species,
Orcinus orca and Leucopleurus acutus, are swapped. In

Figure 3 Characters in our supermatrix of Cetacea. Datasets (top) sampled for each of the 29 extant taxa in the analysis (left) are indicated
by cream colored circles (see Methods for composition of composite operational taxonomic units). The chromosomal positions of most nuclear
loci in the domestic cow genome are given (29 autosomes, X and Y sex chromosomes, “-” = not mapped). “Tran-” indicates sequences that flank
SINE insertions [15]. The 45 extinct taxa (Table 1) were coded for morphology only. The anatomical positions of the 304 morphological
characters in the supermatrix are shown at the bottom of the figure.

our trees, L. acutus is the sister species to all other delphinids included in our analysis, and O. orca is the sister species to the next most inclusive delphinid clade. Among the
river dolphins, Lipotes groups with Inioidea (Inia + Pontoporia), and Platanista is placed as the sister taxon to Delphinida plus Ziphiidae (Figure 4A). Relationships among
odontocete families are congruent with the hypothesis of
Nikaido et al. [15] (Figure 1O, 2P), and several subsequent
studies (Figure 2V, W, X)
Our Bayesian/ML tree is largely congruent with the parsimony trees obtained from the analysis of our morphological and molecular supermatrix (described below)
(Figure 5); 21 of 26 nodes that define relationships
among extant taxa were the same (Figure 4A). Differences were largely due to contrasting methodologies and

not to the inclusion of morphological/fossil data in the
supermatrix; the tree supported by parsimony analysis
of the molecular data alone (Figure 4B) is highly congruent with the parsimony analysis of the fossil + molecular supermatrix (Figure 5) and conflicts at the same
five nodes with the trees from the Bayesian/ML analyses
of the molecular data. In contrast to the explicitly
model-based approaches, parsimony analysis of the
molecular matrix positions Lipotes as the sister-group to
the remaining delphinidans, and also resolves a clade
composed of Platanista and Ziphiidae. Relationships
within Ziphiidae do not match those supported by ML
and Bayesian analyses (Figure 4A-B).
Nearly all nodes in the Bayesian/ML molecular tree
were well supported; 21 nodes received a PP of 1.0 and

Figure 5 Strict consensus of minimum length trees derived from parsimony analysis of the supermatrix. Lineages that connect extant
taxa are colored; river dolphin lineages are red, and other branches are blue. Dotted lines represent fossil lineages and lead to extinct taxa/OTUs
(†). Branch support (BS) is above internodes, and double decay branch support (ddBS) is to the right of nodes that define relationships among
extant taxa (cream background). BS and ddBS are expressed in terms of the number of extra steps beyond minimum tree length. BS scores are
rounded up to the nearest tenth of a step, and ddBS scores are rounded up to the nearest step. Higher-level groupings are delimited by
brackets to the right of the tree.

bootstrap support of 100% (Figure 4A). Only one of
these highly supported nodes (Mesoplodon + Ziphius +
Tasmacetus) did not occur in the parsimony analysis of
the complete supermatrix (Figure 5). Several other
clades that did not occur in the parsimony trees
received less support: Mesoplodon + Ziphius (PP = 0.91,
ML = 80%), Lipotes + Inioidea (PP = 0.98, ML = 51%),
Globicephala + Pseudorca (PP = 0.97, ML = 80%), and
Ziphiidae + Delphinida (PP = 0.98, ML = 63%). Most
clades favored by parsimony analysis of the molecular
data that conflicted with Bayesian and ML results were
weakly supported (bootstrap scores <50 to 55%; Figure
4B). The lone exception was the grouping of Platanista
with Ziphiidae (bootstrap = 95%). When the nu DNA
data were analyzed in isolation from the very large and
more rapidly evolving mt DNA partition using parsimony or model-based methods (Figure 4C), results closely matched the combined molecular tree derived from
ML/Bayesian analyses (Figure 4A).
Our overall supermatrix merged information from the
fossil record and from the mt and nu genomes. Two
most parsimonious trees were found for the combined
supermatrix, each 41081.07 steps in length, and the
strict consensus of these two trees is well resolved (Figure 5). The minimum length trees vary only in the positions of the extinct toothed mysticetes Aetiocetus
cotylalveus and Chonecetus goedertorum; in one they
form a monophyletic Aetiocetidae, which has been supported by several studies [2,41-45], whereas in the other,
Aetiocetus is more closely related to Chaeomysticeti
(edentulous mysticetes) than is Chonecetus, a result previously obtained by Fitzgerald [46]. Relationships among
extant taxa are the same in both trees, with the strict
consensus reconstructing many traditionally recognized
taxa as monophyletic (Figure 5). Because of the instability of many extinct taxa in our trees, we calculated double decay branch support (ddBS [47]) in addition to
branch support (BS) scores [48]. We used ddBS to measure the stability of relationships among extant taxa
within the context of evidence from the complete
matrix, including fossils. Branch support was used to
measure the character support for relationships among
all taxa, extant and extinct, in our trees (see Materials
and Methods). Clades that received high ddBS values
include: Mysticeti (BS = 2.0, ddBS = 206.98), Balaenopteridae (BS = 2.0, ddBS = 106.24), Balaenopteroidea (BS
= 2.34, ddBS = 105.55), Odontoceti (BS = 3.69, ddBS =
40.13), Physeteroidea (BS = 6.85, ddBS = 163.82), Ziphiidae (BS = 1.53, ddBS = 55.76), Delphinida (BS = 2.07,
ddBS = 125.90), Delphinoidea (BS = 0.53, ddBS =
79.89), Inioidea (BS = 3.04, ddBS = 107.53), Phocoenidae
(BS = 5.81, ddBS = 101.95), Delphinidae (BS = 6.65,
ddBS = 53.05), Delphininae (BS = 11.84, ddBS = 44.25),
and Globicephalinae (BS = 11.64, ddBS = 12.61).

Page 10 of 33

Branch support values generally are low (Figure 5).
This is primarily attributed to the inclusion of extinct
taxa that can only be scored for the morphology partition and which subdivide long internodes into much
shorter internal branches. Corresponding ddBS values
are dramatically higher than BS, often by more than a
factor of 10. Of the 70 nodes in the strict consensus, 15
(21%) received very low BS values (i.e. 0.13 steps). Many
of these weakly supported nodes connect to branches
that are situated on the stem lineage to crown Odontoceti. Nodes within Delphinidae, where no fossils were
sampled, have much higher BS values, some of which
are identical to the ddBS values (i.e. Grampus + Globicephala [7.82]; Delphinidae excluding Leucopleurus
[7.12]). Where comparable, BS values are lower than
those reported by Geisler and Sanders [2]. Some of this
reduction is attributed to the addition of 17 taxa to
their morphological matrix. For example, Geisler and
Sanders [2] did not include the extinct ziphiid Ninoziphius platyrostris, which is known only from a partial
skeleton with poorly preserved skull. The BS for Ziphiidae is much lower than that found by Geisler and Sanders [2] (1.53 vs. 10 steps); however, a double decay
analysis that ignores the phylogenetic position of Ninoziphius, but not the positions of other extinct taxa,
increases the BS to 7.07 steps.
Relationships among odontocete families are broadly
congruent with published molecular and morphological
studies (Figure 5). Physeteroidea is the extant sister
group to all other living odontocetes, consistent with
numerous molecular studies (Figure 1J-O, Figure 2L, NP, R-Z) and some morphological analyses (Figure 1D, E,
and 1I). The grouping of Physeteroidea with Ziphiidae,
as found in some morphological analyses (Figure 1F-H;
Additional file 1: Fig. S1), was not supported. As in the
majority of recent molecular studies, Monodontidae is
the sister-group to Phocoenidae [49] with Inioidea, Delphinida, and also Delphinoidea recovered (Figures 1, 2).
A more controversial finding is a sister-group relationship between Platanista and Ziphiidae (Figure 5).
Although the BS for this node is low (0.13), the ddBS is
near the median of recovered values at 48.79. This sister-group relationship had previously been recovered in
multiple previous analyses (Figure 1C, L, M, 2S, Y, Z;
Figure 4B-C). Alternatively, Platanista has been placed
as the sister-group to Delphinida + Ziphiidae (Figure
1B, K, N, O, 2P, Q, V-X; Figure 4A and 4D). A third
alternative places Platanista as the sister-group to Delphinida as in Heyning [4,5] (Figure 1D) among others
(Figure 1A, F, I, J, 2R, T, U), but this grouping was not
recovered in any of our phylogenetic analyses (Figures 4,
5, 6).
Similar to the situation with Platanista, the placement
of Lipotes vexillifer has varied among previous studies;

Figure 6 Strict consensus of minimum length trees derived from parsimony analysis of the morphological data with implied
weighting (k = 3) and relationships among extant taxa constrained to fit the ML/Bayesian analysis of all molecular data (Figure 4A).
Lineages that connect extant taxa are colored; river dolphin lineages are red, and other branches are blue. Dotted lines represent fossil lineages
and lead to extinct taxa/OTUs (†). Divergence times between extant taxa in the tree are according to the molecular clock analysis of McGowen
et al. [20]; divergences of extinct taxa/OTUs are based on first and last appearances in the fossil record (thick black bars; see Table 2 and
Additional file 2: Table S2). Note that all Oligocene or older cetaceans fell outside of crown Odontoceti and outside of crown Mysticeti. The
molecular clock divergences among extant taxa [20] are shown here to contrast with the patterns recorded in the sampling of the fossil record
in our study. Cetacean OTUs in bold followed by “- - - -” are associated with paintings to the right.

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

the combined parsimony analysis agrees with Messenger
and McGuire [1] (Figure 1A) and others (Figure 1F, KN, Figure 2Q) in placing the Yangtze River dolphin as
the extant sister-group to a clade composed of Delphinoidea and Inioidea. This conflicts with multiple studies
that position Lipotes as the extant sister-group to Inioidea (Figure 1B, D, J, 2P, R-Z). It should be noted that
the support for Lipotes as the extant sister-group to Delphinoidea + Inioidea, instead of as the extant sister
taxon of Inioidea, is marginal (BS = 0.87; ddBS = 7.48).
The closest relative to Lipotes is the extinct genus Parapontoporia, here represented by two species, P. wilsoni
and P. sternbergi. This placement is consistent with
some morphological studies [2,8] but is at odds with
others that consider Parapontoporia to be a pontoporiid
[50,51].
Relationships within Ziphiidae are somewhat unconventional (Figure 5). As in the morphological analysis of
Geisler and Sanders [2], Mesoplodon is more closely
related to Berardius than to Ziphius or Tasmacetus.
Such an apical position for Berardius contradicts previous morphological [52-54] and molecular hypotheses
[20,55]. An important caveat to the ziphiid relationships
found here is the very low series of BS and ddBS values
for these nodes (all ≤ 1.05 steps).
Within Delphinidae, Orcaella brevirostris is placed as
the sister-group to Globicephalinae, a result that is consistent with the molecular analysis of Caballero et al.
[37] and the supermatrix tree of McGowen et al. [20],
but contradicts the smaller supermatrix of Steeman et
al. [21], the supertree of Price et al. [25], and analysis of
mt DNA data [19,24]. Within Globicephalinae, Globicephala is more closely related to Grampus than to Pseudorca, a result that was weakly supported by LeDuc et
al. [36]. Among the delphinids included in our analysis,
Leucopleurus acutus is positioned as the sister-species to
all remaining delphinids, with Orcinus orca branching
from a more apical node as the sister to all delphinids
except L. acutus. Although McGowen et al. [20] also
recovered a tree in which these two taxa represented
early branching events within Delphinidae, the positions
of these taxa were reversed with Orcinus, not Leucopleurus, as the sister-group to all other extant delphinid
species.
Of the 45 extinct taxa and/or specimens included in
the analysis, the majority were determined to be stem
odontocetes (Figure 5). A similar result was recovered
by Geisler and Sanders [2] based on an earlier dataset
that was further augmented and modified in the current
study. Overall, the arrangement of stem odontocetes is
quite similar, with Xenorophidae as the first odontocete
branch, followed Agorophius, Patriocetus, and undescribed taxa intercalated among these three named taxa.
However, some topological details differ from the tree

Page 12 of 33

supported by Geisler and Sanders [2]. For example, in
the strict consensus of the current study, Waipatia
forms a clade with Patriocetus and an undescribed form
from South Carolina (ChM PV4961). Somewhat surprisingly, the putative platanistid Zarhachis and the eurhinodelphid Xiphiacetus did not fall inside crown Cetacea
but instead form a clade outside of it (but see below).
Eurhinodelphids have typically been placed within
crown Odontoceti; however, there has been no consensus beyond that. Eurhinodelphids have been considered
as a stem group to Ziphiidae [11], sister-group to Delphinida [9,10], or sister-group to Squalodontidae +
Squalodelphidae [6]. Simocetus rayi, which was not
sampled by Geisler and Sanders [2], here is placed
slightly more apical in the cladogram than Agorophius
and an unnamed taxon (ChM PV5852). As noted above,
relationships among stem odontocetes in the parsimony
analysis of the supermatrix were weakly supported (Figure 5).
Within the odontocete crown group, two extinct taxa,
Pliopontos and Brachydelphis, are positioned inside
Inioidea (Figure 5). The placement of Brachydelphis
inside Inioidea contrasts with an analysis of an earlier
version of the morphological dataset utilized here [2];
the authors of that study reconstructed Brachydelphis as
a stem platanistoid (sensu [56]). Identifying Pliopontos
and Brachydelphis as inioids is in agreement with a previous phylogenetic hypothesis [9], although unlike that
study and others [51,57-59] these two taxa are here
reconstructed as successive stem taxa to Inia, instead of
being positioned inside Pontoporiidae. Kentriodon pernix
and Atocetus nasalis, two extinct species from the possibly paraphyletic Kentriodontidae, were also included in
the analysis. The former is the sister-group to Delphinoidea + Inioidea whereas the latter is the sister-group
to Delphinoidea in our minimum length trees (Figure 5).
The Miocene mysticetes Diorocetus and Pelocetus are
immediately outside the mysticete crown group (Figure
5). Historically such taxa were referred to as cetotheres
[60,61], but more recent systematic work on mysticete
phylogeny has redefined Cetotheriidae to a monophyletic family that excludes these taxa [62]. Regardless, the
phylogenetic positions of these Miocene mysticetes are
controversial, with some studies excluding them from
the crown group [2,44-46,62,63], which is supported
here. Other studies place some Miocene mysticetes as
more closely related to balaenopterids [38] or to balaenopterids and eschrichtiids [39,41,42,64]. Within crown
Mysticeti, Balaenidae is sister to the remaining extant
lineages and Caperea is sister to a monophyletic Balaenopteroidea, as has been found in many analyses of
DNA sequence data [30,65], molecular supermatrices
[20,21], a recent morphological analysis [66], and in an
analysis that combined morphological and molecular

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

data [43]. Balaenoidea (Neobalaenidae + Balaenidae),
which is favored by nearly all morphological studies
(Additional file 1: Fig. S1) [2,38,39,42,43,62], is not supported. Parabalaenoptera is a stem balaenopterid as in
previous work ([39,44] but see [63]).
In addition to the parsimony analysis of the supermatrix, we also executed a morphological analysis with
ML/Bayesian molecular constraints. This search yielded
three trees, each with a score of 15214.10, which differ
only in the relationships of three xenorophids: Xenorophus sloanii, an undescribed species of Xenorophus
(Xenorophus sp.), and another undescribed taxon (ChM
PV5711) (Figure 6). Given the backbone constraint, relationships among extant taxa are identical to those
obtained by ML and Bayesian analyses of the molecular
partition (i.e. 26 nodes); however, 11 of these nodes are
also supported by the parsimony analysis of morphology
(Additional file 1: Fig. S1) and three more are supported
when implied weighting was applied to morphology
(Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Implementation of the ML/
Bayesian constraint and implied weighting changed the
positions of several extinct OTU’s (operational taxonomic units) as compared to the combined parsimony
analysis of morphology and molecules (Figure 5). Unlike
our parsimony analysis of the supermatrix and the
hypothesis of Geisler and Sanders [2], Archaeodelphis is
placed as the sister-group to all remaining odontocetes
instead of being closely related to Xenorophus (Figure
6). The trees obtained with the ML/Bayesian constraint
separate Archaeodelphis from the Xenorophidae, as
defined by Uhen [67]. Unlike the combined parsimony
tree, the clade including Agorophius and an undescribed
OTU (ChM PV5852) is positioned in a group of Oligocene taxa that includes Patriocetus kazakhstanicus. This
contradicts the allocation of Patriocetus to the Squalodontidae [68,69].
The ML/Bayesian molecular constraint positions Platanista as the extant sister-group to Ziphiidae plus Delphinida. Enforcing this relationship resulted in the
recovery of a platanistoid clade, although here Platanistoidea includes Squalodelphinidae (represented by Notocetus vanbenedeni) but not Waipatiidae and
Squalodontidae (contra [10,70]). Xiphiacetus (Eurhinodelphidae) is here placed as the sister-group to platanistoids, unlike the unconstrained analysis where it was
positioned outside of the odontocete crown group.
Another difference is that Platanistidae (Platanista +
Zarhachis) is monophyletic in the analysis with the ML/
Bayesian constraint. Moving to more apical nodes in the
tree, the only extinct ziphiid included in the analysis
(Ninoziphius) is sister to a clade composed of the
remaining ziphiids, whereas in the unconstrained parsimony analysis Ziphius is sister to all other ziphiids in
our sample (Figure 5). Within Delphinida, the extinct

Page 13 of 33

taxon Kentriodon moved from being outside Inioidea +
Delphinoidea to being an early-branching stem delphinoid, and phylogenetic relationships within Inioidea
were rearranged (Figure 6).
Temporal Implications of Phylogenetic Hypotheses

The fit between the fossil record (Table 2; Additional file
2: Table S2) and all minimum length trees recovered
from the four parsimony analyses that included extinct
taxa (Figures 5, 6; Additional file 1: Figs. S1, S2) was measured by the modified Manhattan stratigraphic measure
(MSM*) and the gap excess ratio (GER) (Additional file
2: Table S3). All trees implied substantial ghost lineages
as indicated by the fairly low MSM* scores (0.11-0.12);
however, GER scores, which are standardized by the
maximum possible sum of all ghost lineages, are much
higher (0.83-0.84). The MSM* scores for all trees are statistically significant (p = 0.001). Taken together, these
results suggest that the fossil record of Neoceti (as
sampled in the present study) is reasonably good.
Sister-group relationships and the first appearances of
extinct taxa in the fossil record suggest that the diversifications of crown Odontoceti and crown Mysticeti postdated the Oligocene, in contrast to molecular clock
studies that suggested earlier dates (Figure 6). The
shortest suboptimal tree that includes an Oligocene
taxon inside either crown Odontoceti or crown Mysticeti is 5.27 steps longer than the minimum length trees
(Additional file 2: Table S4). In this suboptimal tree, the
undescribed OTU represented by ChM PV4802 is positioned as a stem taxon to the clade that includes Delphinida, Ziphiidae, and Platanistidae. Although not
supported by the supermatrix of the present study, this
alternative topology could not be statistically rejected
(Templeton test p value = 0.505-0.506; winning-sites p
value = 0.218-0.257). The shortest suboptimal trees that
include other Oligocene odontocetes inside crown
Odontoceti are much longer (10.25-16.29 steps); however, these suboptimal topologies could not be rejected
at a p value of 0.05 either. The shortest tree that
includes Agorophius in the odontocete crown group
(10.25 steps longer) is also the shortest tree that places
Simocetus, Patriocetus, Waipatia, and Prosqualodon
davidis in the odontocete crown group. This suboptimal
tree positions those Oligocene odontocetes in a clade
that is the sister-group to Delphinida + Ziphiidae + Platanistidae. Although this topology is still above the p =
0.05 threshold, its rejection approached statistical significance for the winning-sites test (p = 0.051). The shortest
tree that places Waipatia inside Platanistoidea, as advocated by some studies [10,70], is 13.83 steps longer than
the minimum length trees, although this too could not
be rejected at the p = 0.05 level (Templeton test p value
= 0.152-0.168; winning-sites p value = 0.096-0.118).

by Geisler and Sanders [2], specifically those that occur in
at least three of the four extant genera. River dolphin characters were optimized onto the trees derived from parsimony analysis of the supermatrix (Figure 5) and those
supported by analysis of the morphological data with ML/
Bayesian molecular constraints (Figure 6). Pairwise comparisons among the four river dolphin genera for each of
the nine characters summarize whether shared similarities
in character states between genera are most simply interpreted as homologous - inherited from a common ancestor, or analogous - independently derived through either
convergence or reversal (Figure 7). When the character
state similarities among all extant river dolphins are
homologous, this implies symplesiomorphy (e.g. fused
mandibular symphysis on parsimony trees; number of
maxillary teeth and position of nasals on ML/Bayesian
constraint trees). By contrast, when all pairwise similarities
among genera are analogous, the character is purely convergent and evolved independently in each of the four
river dolphin genera (e.g. length of mastoid process on
parsimony trees). If some but not all states are

The shortest suboptimal trees that included Oligocene
mysticetes within crown Mysticeti were somewhat
longer than their counterparts on the odontocete side of
the tree (13.72-20.84 steps longer than minimum length
trees). Most of these hypotheses could be rejected at p ≤
0.05 for the Templeton and winning-sites tests; the sole
exception was a topology that placed Eomysticetus whitmorei as the sister-group to Balaenidae (Templeton test
p value = 0.115-.121). Even though the combined supermatrix dwarfs the morphological partition in size, the
same p values are obtained when Templeton and winning-sites tests are conducted on the morphological partition because the suboptimal trees differ from the
minimum length trees in the positions of extinct, not
extant, taxa.
The Evolution of River Dolphins

Not surprisingly, all morphological character states shared
by river dolphins cannot be simply described as convergences, reversals, or symplesiomorphies. We focused on

Figure 7 Homology ("H” in tan boxes) versus analogy ("A” in pink boxes) of character states shared by extant river dolphins including
Pontoporia. Results for parsimony optimizations of nine characters on two trees, parsimony supermatrix (Fig. 5) and ML/Bayesian constraint of
morphology (Fig. 6), are shown for all pairwise comparisons between genera of river dolphins. Question marks indicate cases where
optimizations and resulting estimates of homology versus analogy were ambiguous. Trees on the right show alternative mappings of character
245 on the two phylogenetic hypotheses: four transitions to the shared river dolphin state (mastoid of petrosal short) for the parsimony tree and
three transitions for the ML/Bayesian constrained tree. Note that many extant and extinct taxa have been pruned from the illustrated trees, but
all taxa were considered in the actual character optimizations (Figs. 5, 6). Branches are colored as in Fig. 1.

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

homologous, the simplest explanation is either that the
character experienced reversal(s) (e.g. globular promontorium on parsimony trees) or, more commonly, convergent
evolution to similar character states in two or three separate lineages. Several characters previously interpreted as
synapomorphies of all extant river dolphins [2] are here
interpreted as synapomorphies of more exclusive clades,
such as Inioidea (globular promontorium and short mastoid process on constraint trees) or Iniodea plus Lipotes
(long zygoma and mandibular symphysis on constraint
trees). Alternatively, some characters previously interpreted as synapomorphies of all river dolphins are, in the
context of our combined phylogenetic hypotheses, better
interpreted as synapomorphies for even more inclusive
clades (e.g. fused mandibular symphysis on parsimony
trees). In many cases, character optimizations offer multiple equally parsimonious interpretations of the evidence,
and at least some interpretations of homology versus analogy are ambiguous (question marks in Figure 7).
For the trees derived from parsimony analysis of the
supermatrix, two characters are symplesiomorphic
(number of mandibular teeth and fused mandibular
symphysis). Character 218 (globular promontorium) is
symplesiomorphic for all river dolphins, but there are
two subsequent reversals to the primitive condition in
Inia and in Pontoporia (Figure 7). Character 245 (short
mastoid process) is purely convergent, with the morphology of each extant genus interpreted as the result of
an independent derivation. The remaining five characters have ambiguous optimizations, but for character 80
(position of nasals), the inference of homology between
two distantly related genera, Lipotes and Platanista,
implies that this similarity was present in the last common ancestor of all extant river dolphin genera (Figure
7). In contrast, when these same nine characters are
mapped on trees derived from parsimony analysis of
morphology with the ML/Bayesian molecular constraint,
a more consistent pattern of convergence is implied
(Figure 7). Three shared character states are symplesiomorphic (numbers of maxillary and mandibular teeth,
position of nasals), and four characters experienced one
or more instances of convergence (long symphysis and
zygoma, globular promontorium, and short mastoid process). The optimizations for fusion of the mandibular
symphysis and absence of the olecranon process are
uncertain, but the latter is interpreted as convergently
evolved between Platanista and the remaining three
genera (Figure 7). The discrepancies in character optimizations between the trees obtained from constrained and
unconstrained parsimony analyses underscore the
importance of resolving the phylogenetic positions of
Platanista and Lipotes for understanding the evolution
of morphological characters shared by these two taxa.

Discussion
Combination of Diverse Evidence and the Phylogeny of
Neoceti

Our analyses found strong support for several traditionally recognized clades. Most notable is the support for
Mysticeti, Inioidea, and Delphinida; the ddBS for each is
more than 100 steps. All of our phylogenetic analyses
that included molecular evidence (Figures 4, 5, 6) also
supported three newly named clades; 1) Plicogulae
(Balaenopteridae, Eschrichtiidae, plus Caperea), 2) Synrhina (Delphinida, Platanistidae, plus Ziphiidae), and 3)
Monodontoidae (Monodontidae plus Phocoenidae).
Based on the support we found in combined analyses of
molecules and fossils and the fact that these clades have
been recovered by numerous previous studies (e.g.,
[49,66]), we provide names, definitions, and morphological diagnoses for each (Appendix 1).
A parsimony search of the complete supermatrix (Figure
5) and analysis of the morphological data with ML/Bayesian molecular constraints (Figure 6) showed conflicting
phylogenetic positions for two river dolphins, Platanista
and Lipotes, despite the fact that we added six new nu
gene fragments for the latter taxon. Although we do not
have a strong preference for either hypothesis, we do note
that only the analysis with the ML/Bayesian constraint
allocates the extinct taxa Zarhachis and Notocetus to the
Platanistoidea, a result supported by some morphological
analyses [10,11,70]. Furthermore, two SINE transposon
insertions, considered by some to be very reliable phylogenetic characters [71], support the constraint tree (Figure 6)
and conflict with the parsimony analysis of the supermatrix (Figure 5). Clear resolution of remaining conflicts is
critical, because the placements of fossils relative to different extant species, the timing of diversification, and the
reconstruction of evolutionary changes are profoundly
altered depending on the basic set of relationships among
the major lineages of extant cetaceans (see Results above
and Discussion below). However, given the conflicts
among separate analyses of smaller datasets regarding the
placements of Platanista and Lipotes (Figures 1, 2), the
amount of data included in our supermatrix (Figure 3),
and the generally weak support for the placement of
Lipotes in all of our concatenated analyses (Figures 4, 5), it
is clear that the interrelationships of these river dolphins
represent challenging systematic problems that may
require a more complete matrix with less missing data, a
genome-scale dataset, or a much broader sampling of
extinct taxa to derive a consistently robust resolution.
Dating the Radiations of Crown Odontoceti and Crown
Mysticeti

We used the first appearances between sister taxa in the
fossil record to infer minimum dates of divergence at

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

particular nodes in our trees. In all analyses that
included extinct taxa, we were not able to confirm the
hypothesis based on molecular clocks that eight to ten
distinct lineages of cetaceans that have extant representatives existed by the end of the Oligocene [13,20,21,24].
All 25 Oligocene OTU’s sampled in the present study
(~34% of the total taxonomic sample) were positioned
outside of crown Mysticeti and crown Odontoceti,
implying post-Oligocene ages for these two crown
clades. Although the significance of this result in comparison to the molecular clock studies is hard to gauge,
it suggests one or more possibilities: 1) the fossil record
of Oligocene cetaceans is poor, 2) the fossil record of
Oligocene cetaceans is good, but we inadvertently
excluded Oligocene members of the crown groups from
our phylogenetic analyses, 3) molecular clocks have
overestimated the dates for the earliest splits in crown
Odontoceti and Mysticeti, or 4) the morphological character data simply are not sufficient for robust resolution
of these relationships. The first possibility appears unlikely given the significant correlation (i.e. p ≤ 0.001)
between the topologies recovered here and the fossil
record. The second possibility is more likely; our study
heavily samples Oligocene, described and undescribed
OTU’s from the Southeastern United States. If Oligocene faunas were highly endemic, and the radiations of
Odontoceti and Mysticeti did not occur in the Southeastern United States, then exclusion of Oligocene taxa
from crown Odontoceti and from crown Mysticeti may
not be a surprising result.
Examples of Oligocene taxa/specimens that have been
referred to clades within crown Odontoceti, but were
not sampled here because they could not be coded
based on published descriptions, are Oligodelphis, a
putative delphinoid, and Ferecetotherium, a putative
physeteroid. Both taxa are only represented by fragmentary holotypes that were collected from the Maikop Series near the town of Perikeshkul, Azerbaijan. Recent
chemostratigraphic and biostratigraphic work [72] indicates that the lower Miocene and upper Oligocene are
equally represented (in terms of stratigraphic thickness)
at the outcrops near Perikeshkul. Thus future work is
needed to determine if these two taxa in fact came from
the Oligocene part of the section and if they have been
accurately allocated to Delphinoidea and Physeteroidea.
A review of recent literature would suggest that there
are several accepted records of Platanistoidea in the Oligocene [3]. As mentioned in the results section, unlike
Fordyce [10] we did not find Waipatia to be a member
of Platanistoidea (also see [2,11]). Instead this taxon falls
outside of crown group Odontoceti. Similarly we found
Squalodon and Prosqualodon to be outside of the odontocete crown group and not within Platanistoidea, contrary to Muizon [73] and Fordyce [10]. Four of the

Page 17 of 33

Oligocene records of platanistoids on the paleobiology
database are considered squalodelphinids, a family that
fell inside Platanistoidea in our analysis with the ML/
Bayesian constraint but not so in the unconstrained,
combined parsimony analysis (Figures 5, 6). Three of
these records are not well substantiated, but Notocetus
marplesi, from the late Oligocene Otekaike Limestone
Formation [74], was positioned as the sister-group to
the clade of Notocetus vanbenedeni + Squalodelphis in
the phylogenetic analysis of Fordyce [10]. Although we
have not had an opportunity to examine the holotype
and only reported specimen of this taxon, allocation of
this species to Squalodelphinidae would only extend the
range of this family by 1 to 3 million years (Notocetus
vanbenedeni, which is included in our analyses, is
known from the earliest Miocene). As discussed in more
detail below, the occurrence of at least a few lineages of
crown odontocetes in the late Oligocene is to be
expected.
Among described Oligocene mysticetes, Steeman [47]
suggested that one taxon, Mauicetus parki, is a member
of crown Mysticeti. The holotype consists of part of the
postorbital region of the skull, and previously published
descriptions suggest limited fossil remains that can only
be identified as a chaeomysticete [75,76]. Steeman [42]
reported that one of the petrosals of the holotype had
been freed from the skull, and her analysis of morphological data placed this Oligocene form not only within
the crown group but also within Balaenopteroidea. If
correct, then molecular estimates for the radiation of
Balaenopteroidea are substantially (i.e. 6-10 Ma) underestimated [20,21,30]. However, it is difficult to compare
the topology of Steeman [21] to phylogenetic studies of
molecular data that are sampled at the species level.
Steeman [21] included the genera Eschrichtius and
Balaenoptera as OTUs (the latter a composite based on
B. musculus and B. acutorostrata) and found these genera to be separated by multiple extinct mysticetes,
including Mauicetus parki. By contrast, some molecular
analyses have found Eschrichtius to be nested within the
genus Balaenoptera [20,24,65]. Furthermore, the positions of many extinct mysticetes in Steeman’s tree differ
sharply from the only studies on mysticete systematics
that included molecular and fossil data [43,63]. Regardless, Mauicetus parki should be included in future analyses that combine morphological and molecular data,
particularly now that the petrosal, which has many diagnostic features, is available for study.
Other putative records of crown odontocetes or crown
mysticetes in the Oligocene consist of undescribed taxa
that we have not had the opportunity to study.
Ichishima et al. [77] and Steeman et al. [21] mentioned
a specimen from the Oligocene of New Zealand which
they referred to as “Kentriodon ? sp.” or as “cf.

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

Kentriodon.” However, in neither case was the morphology of this specimen described or the basis for this identification discussed. In a meeting abstract, Fordyce [78]
introduced the first putative stem balaenid mysticete
from the late Oligocene, based on a partial skull and
other elements (OU 22224). The morphology of the specimen was briefly described, although Fordyce did not
specify what features ally it with extant balaenids. Steeman [42] included an undescribed taxon from the Oligocene of New Zealand (ZMT 67) in her phylogenetic
analysis, which was positioned as the sister-taxon to
Mauicetus parki. Thus placed, this taxon would be a
member of the mysticete crown group as well as a stem
balaenopteroid; however, as with Mauicetus parki, it is
difficult to reconcile the position of ZMT 67 in light of
recent molecular phylogenies based on species-level
OTUs that conflict with the basic structure of Steeman’s
[42] phylogenetic hypothesis.
The above discussion should not be understood as a
rejection of any putative crown odontocete or mysticete
in the Oligocene. To the contrary, we think that several
early splits in crown Odontoceti and crown Mysticeti
did occur in the late Oligocene because the oldest
undisputed physeteroids [79,80] and a balaenid [81,82]
are known from the earliest Miocene. However, what is
known of the late Oligocene fossil record consists predominantly of plesiomorphic odontocetes and mysticetes, many with long intertemporal regions, some with
external nares that are anterior to the orbits, and
numerous mysticetes that retain teeth [83]. As noted
above, possible exceptions to this pattern that require
further investigation are Ferecetotherium, which is likely
a physeteroid and possibly Oligocene in age, and Notocetus marplesi, which is Oligocene in age and is possibly
a squalodelphinid. Certainly other undescribed taxa that
have been tentatively placed in crown Odontoceti or
crown Mysticeti should be described and placed in phylogenetic analyses as well [78,42,21], but we caution
against the use of these undescribed taxa as calibration
points in molecular clock studies until that is done
[21,20,24,84]. Our phylogenetic analyses, which are
based on a reasonable sample of the known Oligocene
cetacean fossil record, do not support the radiation of
crown Mysticeti and crown Odontoceti in the early Oligocene, as reconstructed by several molecular clock studies [20,21,24]. The timing of these basal splits is critical
because if they occurred in the earliest Oligocene, then
they would have coincided with an interval of pronounced ocean cooling [21] that may have helped spur
early neocete evolution [85].
Given our criticism of some of the calibration points
used in molecular clock studies, we present a more conservative, and better justified, set of points (Table 3).
The first four calibrations are preferred because they are

Page 18 of 33

based on fossil taxa that have had their relationships to
extant taxa determined by computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of datasets that include molecular and
morphological data. The phylogenetic positions of Kentriodon pernix and Simocetus rayi, which provide minimum ages for Delphinida and Neoceti respectively, are
based on the current study, with ages supported by
work listed in Table S2 (Additional file 2). A minimum
age for Plicogulae is provided by “Megaptera” miocaena
[43], which is at least 7.2 Ma in age [63], and we agree
with van Tuinen and Hadley [86] in considering Pakicetidae as a good calibration point for the clade referred
to as Whippomorpha or Cetancodonta [87,88], which is
constrained to be older than 47 Ma [89].
We are less confident about the last five calibration
points (Table 3). Regarding a minimum age for Synrhina, placement of Notocetus within Platanistoidea is
supported by our analysis of the morphological partition
with the Bayesian/ML constraint but not our parsimony
analysis of the supermatrix. If this taxon is a platanistoid, then it constrains Synrhina to be at least 20 Ma
[90]. The remaining four calibration points are deemed
less reliable because they are based on phylogenetic analyses of morphological data only. As described in the
results section, morphological and molecular data are at
odds with respect to the phylogenetic positions of some
extant taxa, thus it is unclear if the positions of extinct
taxa would be stable to the addition of molecular data.
Morenocetus parvus, the earliest described balaenid [82],
is from deposits of the same age as Notocetus and, if
accurately placed, implies that crown mysticetes
emerged in the earliest Miocene. Also among the last

five calibration points is Llanocetus denticrenatus, the
earliest stem mysticete [42,45]. Llanocetus provides an
older minimum age of 34 Ma [91,92] for Neoceti relative to our more conservative estimate based on the
odontocete Simocetus rayi. Finally, the phocoenid Salumiphocaena stocktoni [93] and the ziphiid Archaeoziphius microglenoideus [54,94] potentially provide
minimum ages of 7.5 Ma [95] and 13.2 Ma for Monodontoidae and the ziphiid crown group, respectively.
Our phylogenetic analyses support the exclusion of
Oligocene cetaceans from crown Mysticeti and crown
Odontoceti, however we used two statistical tests (Templeton/Wilcoxon rank sum and winning-sites tests) to
determine whether our supermatrix strongly rejects
hypotheses that include one or more Oligocene taxa in
either of these clades. With one exception, we could
reject all hypotheses that placed any of the Oligocene
mysticetes we sampled in crown Mysticeti. The sole
suboptimal topology that the Templeton test did not
reject places Eomysticetidae as the sister-group to Balaenidae. Although a few characters do support a clade of
eomysticetids and balaenids (absence of coracoid process of scapula, transverse groove on involucrum of
bulla), the skull of eomysticetids is radically different
from that of balaenids. Unlike the Templeton test, the
balaenid + eomysticetid hypothesis was rejected by the
winning-sites test (p = 0.017).
For odontocetes, positioning one or more of the Oligocene OTUs we sampled inside crown Odontoceti cost
between 10.25 and 16.29 steps. One important exception
was a tree that placed the undescribed OTU ChM
PV4802 as the sister-group to Synrhina (5.27 steps
longer). If this suboptimal tree is accurate, then at the
end of the Oligocene there would have been at least
three separate lineages of odontocetes that have extant
descendants. ChM PV4802 is more like extant odontocetes than other Oligocene taxa we sampled in having
extreme polydonty, probable homodonty (dentition is
not completely preserved), near absence of the parietals
from the skull roof, and development of a fossa on the
palatine for the pterygoid sinus. It also shares with eurhinodelphids, ziphiids, and Squaloziphius a massive
postglenoid process of the squamosal. Although inclusion of ChM PV4802 in crown Odontoceti is not supported by the present study, future analyses should
include multiple Miocene ziphiids, eurhinodelphids, and
platanistoids to determine whether these taxa “pull”
ChM PV4802 into the crown group.
Most trees that position Oligocene taxa inside crown
Odontoceti require many more steps than the minimum
length trees, but the suboptimal topologies could not be
rejected at p ≤ 0.05 using the Templeton or winningsites tests. Thus, it is possible that the morphological
data are simply not robust enough to determine, with

Page 19 of 33

confidence, whether certain Oligocene fossils are stem
or crown odontocetes. However, detailed inspection of
many of these trees reveals problematic patterns. The
shortest tree that includes Agorophius in crown Odontoceti also places Patriocetus, Simocetus, Prosqualodon
davidis, and Waipatia in the crown group (10.25 steps
longer). This suboptimal tree requires the Oligocene
odontocetes to exhibit step-wise reversals of cranial telescoping, the evolutionary process by which the external
nares and rostral bones shifted posteriorly [96]. This
tree also places the above Oligocene taxa inside the
crown group in reverse stratigraphic order; taxa that
branch from the most apical nodes are early Oligocene,
and taxa that branch from the most basal nodes are late
Oligocene. Similar inconsistencies between cranial telescoping and stratigraphy occur for the shortest trees
that include Waipatia inside Platanistoidea (13.83 steps
longer).
Evolution of Riverine Odontocetes

The current consensus among morphologists is that
Platanista (Indus and Ganges River dolphins) is not closely related to the two other extant river dolphins (Inia
and Lipotes) or to the coastal dolphin Pontoporia
[1,4,8,10]. The grouping that included all four genera
was originally named Platanistoidea [56], although given
that the group apparently is not monophyletic, Platanistoidea is now used instead to refer to Platanista and its
extinct relatives [97]. One of the intriguing questions
raised by non-monophyly of river dolphins is, how did
they obtain such a disjunct distribution? By placing various marine odontocetes as the respective sister-groups
to each extant river dolphin genus (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8),
the current study supports suggestions that odontocetes
invaded river systems on at least three occasions [13].
Hamilton et al. [14] expanded upon the hypothesis of
separate, freshwater invasions by speculating that the
ancestors of extant river dolphins remained in river systems after sea level regressed from its middle Miocene
highs. In citing evidence for this hypothesis, they summarized published geologic evidence for a large epicontinental sea, called the Paranense Sea, in South America
in the Miocene. They further suggested that the divergence of riverine Inia from marine Pontoporia was
caused by the regression of the Paranense Sea. In criticizing this scenario, Steeman et al. [21] noted that their
molecular clock estimate placed the divergence between
these species at 20 Ma, well before the middle Miocene
regressions mentioned by Hamilton et al. [14]. However,
in calibrating their molecular clock, Steeman et al. [21]
used the putative pontoporiid Brachydelphis to place a
minimum age of 12 Ma on the Inia/Pontoporia divergence. In our Bayesian constraint trees, Brachydelphis is
placed outside of the Inia and Pontoporia clade.

Although the phylogeny of Inioidea varied among our
analyses (Figures 5, 6), this does raise doubts about the
appropriateness of Brachydelphis as a calibration point,
and we consider the Hamilton et al. [14] scenario as
worthy of further investigation in combined phylogenetic analyses of Cetacea.
Cassens et al. [13] also speculated that river dolphins
persisted in river systems, but not in marine environments, either because 1) they did not have to compete
with delphinoids for prey or 2) they were less affected
by changes in ocean temperature or circulation.
Although we are not able to test these hypotheses
directly, current evidence casts doubt on both of them.
Regarding competition, in the Yangtze River the range
of Lipotes overlapped with the delphinoid Neophocaena
phocaenoides and in the Amazonian River Basin, there
is significant range overlap between Inia and the delphinoid Sotalia fluviatilis [98]. In the case of Lipotes,
human activities, not competition with Neophocaena,
have been implicated in its demise [99]. Similarly
human activities are the primary threat to Inia as well
[100]. Although positive evidence for the competitive
exclusion hypothesis is wanting, river dolphins are sympatric with relatively few species of delphinoids in rivers.
Thus it is possible that the intensity of competition, not
the simple presence or absence of a single delphinoid
species, could explain the absence of close relatives to
Lipotes and Platanista in modern marine environments.
Cassens et al. [13] cite the simultaneous decline of
extinct, marine relatives of extant river dolphins with
the increase of delphinoids as evidence to support their
hypothesis. However, until now, none of the extinct taxa
included in their diversity estimates had been analyzed
explicitly in the context of molecular data, and most
had not been included in computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of morphology alone. As described above,
we found one supposed platanistoid (Waipatia) to
instead be outside of the odontocete crown group in
two of our analyses (Figures 5, 6), along with several
more putative platanistoids that branch from the stem
lineage of Odontoceti in our parsimony analysis of the
supermatrix (Figure 5). Thus we encourage future studies to include more putative, extinct relatives of river
dolphins in total evidence analyses to test whether the
simultaneous changes in delphinoid and river dolphin
diversity are supported. Regarding the second hypothesis
of Cassens et al. [13] that fluvial environments provided
a refuge from changes in oceanic temperature and circulation changes, we note that a marine environment generally experiences less variability in temperature than a
river due to a smaller surface area to volume ratio.
Now that there is a consensus that river dolphins do
not form a natural group, it is useful to revisit the morphological evidence that initially led to the hypothesis

Page 21 of 33

that these taxa are very closely related. The most
obvious morphological feature shared by Pontoporia and
extant river dolphins is a narrow and elongate rostrum
[6], although several authors have suggested that this
feature is symplesiomorphic [2,32]. Even so, other characters that river dolphins share have a more restricted
distribution, and in the most comprehensive morphological analysis to date, Geisler and Sanders [2] listed
seven unambiguous synapomorphies for the subclade
delimited by all extant river dolphins. The present study
incorporates a modified version of the Geisler and Sanders [2] matrix, and analyses of the expanded matrix
agree with other morphological studies in excluding Platanista from a close relationship with Lipotes, Inia, and
Pontoporia (Additional file 1: Figs. S1, S2). However, we
changed very few individual character codings from
Geisler and Sanders [2], thus the morphological support
for river dolphin monophyly, although now in the minority, still remains. With the trees of extant and extinct
cetaceans obtained in the current study, we are able to
scrutinize the morphological characters that support
river dolphin monophyly and test hypotheses that were
developed to explain their homoplastic behavior.
River dolphin paraphyly/polyphyly implies several possible evolutionary explanations for morphological characters shared by extant river dolphins and Pontoporia:
1) the characters are convergent, 2) the similarities are
symplesiomorphic, 3) similarities are due to reversals, or
4) various combinations of these effects. Complicating
the evaluation of these hypotheses is the positioning of
extant river dolphins as successive sister-groups to Delphinoidea in some phylogenetic hypotheses based solely
on living species (Figures 1, 4); thus according to parsimony optimization, it is unclear whether these similarities are convergent or are homologs with subsequent
reversals in Delphinoidea and/or Ziphiidae. Futhermore,
the positions of Platanista and several extinct taxa,
which vary between the parsimony analysis of the supermatrix and the trees constrained by the ML/Bayesian
topology, have a major impact on whether morphological characters shared by river dolphins are reconstructed
as convergent, reversed, or symplesiomorphic (see
RESULTS).
The fact that odontocetes restricted to rivers share
several morphological features has led some to hypothesize that these features are adaptations to fluvial environments [13,101]. Key among these possible adaptations
are features related to prey capture (Figure 8): >25 maxillary teeth (character 24, state 6 or 7), >27 mandibular
teeth (37, state 8 or 9), long mandibular symphysis (39,
state 2), fused mandibular symphysis (40, state 0), and
long zygomatic process of squamosal (188, > state 2).
Although it is possible that these characters are functionally related, each has passed initial tests of logical

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

independence (sensu [102]; see [2]) and were therefore
optimized on our trees as separate characters. If these
characters states are in fact adaptations to a riverine
environment, we would expect them to have evolved
convergently in independent lineages of river dolphins.
One of these character states, a large number of mandibular teeth (37), does not appear to be an adaptation
of this type (Figure 8) because it is a symplesiomorphy
of river dolphins on both sets of trees (note: Platanista
does not share the “river dolphin” state). However, convergence remains a possibility for the other four characters. For example, according to the ML/Bayesian
constrained trees, the elongate zygomatic process (188)
and the long mandibular symphysis (39) of Platanista
are convergent with those traits in Inioidea plus Lipotes;
however, symplesiomorphy is an equally efficient interpretation on the parsimony tree for these two characters. Conversely, although a fused mandibular symphysis
(40) is a symplesiomorphy on the parsimony tree, convergence between Platanista and Inioidea plus Lipotes is
equally parsimonious to symplesiomorphy on the ML/
Bayesian constrained trees (Figures 7, 8).
Given the above discussion, the elongate zygomatic
processes, long mandibular symphyses, and other traits
shared by river dolphins may be convergent, particulary
if we accept the ML/Bayesian constrained trees (see Figure 7), but could these characters be adaptations to life
in a fluvial environment? Extant odontocetes use two
major modes of prey capture: 1) raptorial feeding where
prey are seized by the teeth, and 2) suction feeding
where prey are sucked into the mouth and teeth play little to no role in prey acquisition [103,104]. The suite of
prey capture features shared by extant river dolphins are
all correlated with raptorial feeding; however, there is
no reason to think raptorial feeding is more efficient in
rivers than in the ocean. Even more revealing are the
paleoenvironments where fossils of extinct “river dolphins” have been found. On the ML/Bayesian constrained trees (Figure 6), Platanista is closely related to
the extinct taxa Zarhachis, Notocetus, and Xiphiacetus,
all of which have been found in sediments that were
clearly deposited in marine environments [105]. All
three of those extinct marine odontocetes have a long
mandibular symphysis, two have a fused symphysis, and
one has an elongate zygomatic process of the squamosal.
Similarly, Pontoporia, Parapontoporia, Pliopontos, and
Brachydelphis, which are close relatives of Lipotes and
Inia, also occur in marine environments [106] or were
found in marine sediments [105,107]. Two of these marine odontocetes have a long and fused mandibular symphysis, and three have a long zygomatic process. Clearly
there is not a simple one-to-one correlation between the
presence of river dolphin characters involved in prey
capture and a riverine habitat.

Page 22 of 33

If we optimize habitat on the parsimony trees (Figure
5) or the ML/Bayesian constrained trees (Figure 6), the
simplest interpretation is that odontocetes switched
from marine to riverine habitats three times on the
terminal branches leading to Platanista, Lipotes, and
Inia (Figure 8). To see if there is any support for the
hypothesis that river dolphin characters related to feeding are adaptations to river environments, we optimized
these characters using delayed transformation (DELTRAN) optimization (Figure 8). DELTRAN optimizations were employed because this procedure shifts as
many character changes as possible to apical branches,
where invasions of freshwater habitats occurred. If no
pattern is found with DELTRAN optimizations, then
these characters should not be interpreted as adaptations to riverine environments. The character mappings
suggest that half (Figure 8A) to nearly all (Figure 8B) of
the river dolphin character states involved in prey capture evolved on internal branches that are optimized as
marine - five out of ten state changes for the parsimony
trees and nine out of ten on the ML/Bayesian constrained trees. Focusing on the parsimony trees, those
changes that may have occurred in freshwater cetaceans
are not evenly distributed; three occur on the terminal
branch leading to Platanista and two others are positioned on the branch leading to Lipotes. Those same
character states evolved in marine relatives of Inia, so
even here the adaptation hypothesis is contradicted in
part. Futhermore, one of the characters that is placed
on the branch leading to Lipotes, a long mandibular
symphysis, may have evolved earlier because an elongate symphysis occurs in the unsampled, extinct Parapontoporia pacifica [50], possibly a lipotid. To
summarize, we find meager support for the hypothesis
that prey capture features shared by river dolphins are
adaptations to freshwater environments. A better
understanding of the evolution of prey capture features
in river dolphins will require observational data on the
function(s) of these features in extant taxa, which is
generally lacking, as well as paleobiological studies on
extinct taxa to infer their diets and behaviors. Until
this is done, such discussions will be largely speculative, and existing data cannot discriminate between the
hypothesis that these prey-capture features are exaptations (sensu [108]) in extant river dolphins or are simply feeding adaptations that are equally effective in
marine and fluvial environments. Characteristics of the
soft anatomy shared by extant river dolphins (e.g.,
small eye size, broad forelimb flippers; Figure 9) may
represent adaptations to life in a riverine habitat, but
this hypothesis is difficult to test using fossil data and
is again contradicted, or at least complicated, by the
presence of these features in the coastal marine genus,
Pontoporia.

Conclusions
1. The relationships among extant lineages of Cetacea
were investigated through phylogenetic analyses of
diverse molecular data and parsimony analysis of the
entire supermatrix, which included molecules, morphology, and extinct taxa. Of the 26 nodes defining relationships among extant taxa, support for one third of them
is overwhelming, with ML bootstrap of 100%, PP of 1.0,
and ddBS > 100 steps: Cetacea plus Hippopotamidae,
Cetacea, Mysticeti, Balaenopteroidea, Balaenopteridae,
Physeteroidea, Delphinida, Inioidea, and Phocoenidae.
Another seven clades have very strong support, with ML
bootstrap of 100%, PP of 1.0, and ddBS values between
100 and 20 steps: Odontoceti, Synrhina, Ziphiidae, Delphinoidea, Monodontoidae, Delphinidae, and Delphininae. Although there was broad congruence among these

analyses, Lipotes and Platanista, two of the river dolphin
genera, were inconsistently positioned in parsimony and
explicitly model-based searches. Therefore, the tree supported by Bayesian and ML analyses of the molecular
partition was used as a topological scaffold in an additional analysis of the morphological partition to determine how this underlying topology influences
phylogenetic interpretations of extinct taxa. The ML/
Bayesian constrained tree and the parsimony supermatrix tree suggest that the phylogenetic relationships of
many extinct OTUs are unstable due to missing character data and to the density of taxonomic sampling, but
several fossils were consistently positioned relative to
extant taxa.
2. All trees with extinct taxa had a statistically significant fit with the fossil record, suggesting that the fossil

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

record of crown Cetacea is quite good. Of the 25
described and undescribed Oligocene cetaceans included
in our analyses, all were positioned outside of crown
Odontoceti and crown Mysticeti. Thus our results do
not support the hypothesis that the basal splits in both
crown groups occurred in the late Eocene to early Oligocene as proposed by several molecular clock studies.
However, we could not statistically reject some suboptimal topologies that placed Oligocene odontocetes within
crown Odontoceti. Futhermore, additional Oligocene
taxa need to be included in future combined phylogenetic analyses of molecular and morphological data most notably Ferecetotherium kelloggi, Notocetus marplesi, Oligodelphis azerbajdzanicus, Mauicetus parki,
and several undescribed specimens.
3. By allocating multiple, extinct, marine odontocetes
to clades that include extant river dolphins, our analyses
support the hypothesis that marine odontocetes invaded
river systems on multiple occasions. Extant river dolphins share a suite of morphological features associated
with raptorial prey capture. Some of these character
states are symplesiomorphic whereas others may be convergent, depending upon the topology accepted and on
alternative equally parsimonious optimizations. On the
ML/Bayesian constrained trees, most if not all of these
states evolved in marine lineages, whereas on the trees
derived from a parsimony analysis of the supermatrix, at
least half of these characters evolved in marine taxa.
Even on the latter trees, no river dolphin character associated with prey capture is interpreted to have evolved
separately on the three terminal branches leading to
extant freshwater taxa. Thus we find little support for
the hypothesis that these characters are adaptations to
river environments.

Methods
Morphological Data

The morphological dataset incorporated in the present
study is an expanded version of that published by
Geisler and Sanders [2] and is composed of 304 phenotypic characters (Figure 3; Additional file 3) scored
from 29 extant and 45 extinct operational taxonomic
units (OTUs; Table 1). The primary difference in the
new version is the addition of 17 taxa, including seven
extant delphinids (Delphinus delphis, Leucopleurus
acutus. Globicephala macrorhynchus, Grampus griseus,
Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Orcaella brevirostris), two extinct toothed mysticetes (Mammalodon
colliveri, Janjucetus hunderi), the extant balaenopterid
mysticete Megaptera novaeangliae, the archaic odontocete Simocetus rayi, the extinct ziphiid Ninoziphius
platyrostris, the extant phocoenid Phocoenoides dalli,
the extinct inioid Pliopontos littoralis, the kentriodontid Atocetus nasalis, and the extinct delphinoid Albireo

whistleri. Parapontoporia, a fossil delphinidan that has
been interpreted as a lipotid [2,8] or a pontoporiid
[50], was scored at the genus level in a previous matrix
[2], but was coded as two separate species, P. wilsoni
and P. sternbergi in the present study. Character codings for Mammalodon colliveri and Janjucetus hunderi
came directly from Fitzgerald [46]. Scorings for Megaptera novaeangliae were based on a mixture of published data and new observations, whereas the vast
majority of scorings for the other added taxa were
based on observations made directly from specimens.
In addition, several codings were modified for the
extinct odontocete Brachydelphis mazeasi. In Geisler
and Sanders [2] this taxon was coded from a published
description [109], but here, direct observations of the
holotype and referred specimens were recorded (Additional file 3).
Compilation and Alignment of Molecular Data

Sampling of molecular data was guided by the set of
extant taxa coded for morphology (above). Molecular
data were compiled for 20 of the extant species in the
morphology dataset: Bos taurus, Sus scrofa, Tursiops
truncatus, Leucopleurus acutus, Grampus griseus, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Orcaella brevirostris,
Phocoena phocoena, Phocoenoides dalli, Inia geoffrensis,
Pontoporia blainvillei, Lipotes vexillifer, Tasmacetus
shepherdi, Ziphius cavirostris, Physeter macrocephalus,
Megaptera novaeangliae, Balaenoptera physalus,
Eschrichtius robustus, and Caperea marginata (Figure
3). To reduce missing data in the molecular matrix for
the nine remaining species coded for morphology (Hippopotamus amphibius, Delphinus delphis, Globicephala
macrorhynchus, Delphinapterus leucas, Mesoplodon
europaeus, Berardius bairdii, Platanista gangetica, Kogia
breviceps, Eubalaena glacialis), we made assumptions of
monophyly and combined sequences from several species for a particular OTU. For example, Hippopotamus
amphibius was coded for morphological characters, but
for many genes that we sampled, molecular data have
not been generated for this hippopotamid species. However, a close relative in the family Hippopotamidae,
Choeropsis liberiensis, has been sequenced for some of
these genes. So, we assumed the monophyly of Hippopotamidae in our molecular sampling and included
some genes that have been sequenced from Choeropsis
and other genes that have been sequenced from Hippopotamus in a single, composite OTU - Hippopotamidae.
The nine groups that were assumed to be monophyletic
in the molecular matrix were: Hippopotamidae (Hippopotamus + Choeropsis), Delphinus, Globicephala, Monodontidae (Monodon + Delphinapterus), Mesoplodon,
Berardius, Kogia, Platanista, and Balaenidae (Balaena +
Eubalaena) (Table 1).

For compilation of molecular data, our starting point
was a recently published supermatrix for Cetacea that
includes transposon insertion events, mt genome data,
and information from 45 nu loci that had been published prior to 8/2008 [20]. For the 29 extant taxa
included here (Table 1), McGowen et al.’s [20] matrix of
42,335 characters was augmented by adding subsequently published mt and nu DNA sequences as well as
newly generated DNA sequence data (Figure 3). The
cutoff for inclusion of information from Genbank was
9/2009. Genes added to the supermatrix included segments of BGN, CSN3, GZMA, HLA-DQA1, HOXC8,
MC1R, MOS, RHO, RNASE1, UBE1Y7, ZP3, 11 olfactory
receptor loci, two anonymous Y chromosome loci, and
mt tRNA genes. Seventy-two new sequences from 14 nu
genes (AMBN, ATP7A, BDNF, BTN1A1, CSN2, CSN3,
ENAM, FGG, OR1I1, PRM1, RAG1, RNASE1, SRY, ZP3)
were generated in our labs for this study using the general PCR, cloning, and sequencing methods described in
Gatesy et al. [110] and O’Leary and Gatesy [111]. Six
new nu gene fragments from Lipotes were amplified and
sequenced here (ATP7A, CSN2, PRM1, RAG1, RNASE1,
SRY). Published primers were used for the AMBN,
ATP7A, BDNF, BTN1A1, CSN2, CSN3, ENAM, FGG,
PRM1, RAG1, RNASE1, and ZP3 genes [44,88,110-116].
PCR/sequencing primers for the OR1I1 gene were (5’ to
3’): ORTHOCF - CAACCTGTCCCTGGTCGACG and
ORTHOCR - CATTTGACCTGAGCAGAAAGG. PCR/
sequencing primers for the SRY gene were (5’ to 3’):
TGAAGCGACCCATGAACG and TCGACGAGGTCGATACTT. Cetacean genomic DNA samples were provided by P. Morin, A. Dizon, and K. Robertson (SWFSC:
Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, La Jolla,
CA), G. Braulik (World Wildlife Fund), H. Rosenbaum
(NYZS: New York Zoological Society), M. Milinkovitch
(Free University of Brussels), M. Heide-Jørgensen
(Greenland Institute of Natural Resources), The Marine
Mammal Center - Sausalito, Smithsonian Institution Division of Mammals, South Australian Museum.
Donating institutions/persons and sample reference
numbers for SWFSC are listed after each species in Supplementrary Table 1; all newly generated sequences were
deposited in Genbank (Accession #s JF504739,
JF504761, JF504780, JF504809, JF504952, JF504967,
JF504975, AY442934, AY954636, AY954640, AY954641,
AY954643, AY954645, AY954646, JF701623-JF701674).
AMBN exon 6 data (five new sequences) were below the
length limit accepted by Genbank (131 nucleotides), but
these data can be retrieved from our supermatrix that is
stored at MorphoBank.
Recently deposited data from Genbank and new
sequences from our lab generally were aligned by eye to
the previously published matrix [20] with the introduction of very few new gaps. However, several gene

Page 25 of 33

segments present in the McGowen et al. [20] matrix
were re-aligned after addition of our newly generated
data using CLUSTAL [117] with a gap opening penalty
of ten and a gap extension cost of one; some adjacent
gaps in the resulting multiple-sequence alignments were
consolidated using SeqApp 1.9a [118] as in Gatesy et al.
[110], O’Leary and Gatesy [111], and Spaulding et al.
[88]. All newly-incorporated loci (e.g, CSN3 and HOXC8
that were not present in the matrix of McGowen et al.
[20]) also were aligned using CLUSTAL and SeqApp.
Indels (insertions or deletions) were coded for each
gene in SeqState [119] using the simple gap-coding
method of Simmons and Ochoterena [120]. The final
molecular dataset was composed of 60,851 characters
(transposons = 101, mtDNA = 15,587, nu DNA =
44,224, indels = 939) and exceeded that of McGowen et
al. [20] by 18,516 characters. In sum, the matrix
included segments of 69 nu loci (Figure 3); the genomic
position of each nu sequence was determined by BLAST
searches against the Bos taurus genome (version 4.0)
and additional sequences in Genbank.
Compilation of Supermatrix (Combined Morphology and
Molecules)

The molecular dataset (60,851 characters; 29 extant
taxa) was merged with the morphology dataset (304
characters; 29 extant taxa and 45 extinct taxa) into a
single, concatenated supermatrix. Extinct taxa were
coded as missing (?) for all molecular characters. The
final combined dataset was submitted to Morphobank
[121]; Genbank numbers for published DNA sequence
data are recorded in this archived matrix. Additionally,
species representatives for taxa assumed to be monophyletic are given for each data partition in the Morphobank supermatrix.
Phylogenetic Analyses of Morphological Data

Parsimony analyses were conducted using the computer
application TNT [122], with search parameters defined
by the defaults under “New Technology Search” except
that the number of times that minimum length is recovered was set at 1000. Observed similarities among states
within single multistate characters were included as data
in our analyses by ordering those characters, as suggested by Wilkinson [123]. If all character states were
equally similar/dissimilar, then the multistate character
was treated as unordered. Characters were assigned
weights following a recent analysis that combined morphological and molecular data [124]. As in that study,
between-character scaling (sensu Wiens [125]) was
achieved by down-weighting ordered, multistate, morphological characters so that they have the same minimum length as a binary character, one step. If this is
not done, then ordered characters with a large number

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

of states would have a disproportionate influence on
phylogenetic results by strongly penalizing trees that
place taxa with disparate character states adjacent to
one another [125]. Unordered multistate characters do
not exhibit this behavior, thus they were given the same
weight as binary characters. Although parsimony does
not account for homoplasy on long branches when evaluating phylogenetic hypotheses, the parsimony method
of implied weighting adjusts for homoplastic characters
by down-weighting them dynamically during analysis
[40]. Thus the morphology partition also was analyzed
with implied weights as implemented in TNT, with the
constant of the weighting function set to the default
value (k = 3). A Bayesian analysis of the morphological
partition also was executed using MrBayes 3.1.2 [126].
Unlike our parsimony analyses, we were unable to
incorporate ordered characters in our Bayesian analysis
because MrBayes was not able to accomodate the large
number of states for some ordered characters. Instead,
the Mk model with gamma rate variation was implemented, and all characters were treated as unordered.
The Bayesian analysis of morphology was run as
described below for the Bayesian analyses of molecular
data.
Morphological characters were optimized onto trees
by parsimony to diagnose clades and to track the evolution of characters shared by extant river dolphins and
Pontoporia. PAUP 3.1.1 [127], PAUP* 4.0 [128], and
MacClade [129] were used to map characters onto our
trees and to distinguish equivocal versus unequivocal
character transformations. All most parsimonious state
reconstructions were estimated using MacClade.
Phylogenetic Analyses of Molecular Data

Parsimony searches of the molecular data were done in
PAUP* [128]. Two subsets of characters were analyzed
in order to assess the influence of the large, rapidly evolving mt DNA partition on phylogenetic results: 1) nu
data - including nu DNA sequences and insertions of
transposons, and 2) all nu and mt characters combined.
Each matrix was analyzed with and without indel characters; all character state transformations were given
equal weight. Searches were heuristic with 1000 random
taxon addition replicates and TBR branch swapping.
Bootstrapping of characters was used to summarize support; 1000 replicates were executed for each bootstrap
analysis, and each replicate included a heuristic search
with 10 random taxon additions and tree bisection
reconnection (TBR) branchswapping.
Bayesian analyses were run in MrBayes 3.1.2 [126]
using the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research
(CIPRES) Portal 2.0 [130]. Data were partitioned as in
the above parsimony searches (nu, mt + nu), and analyses were run with and without indel characters. The

Page 26 of 33

binary model was used for transposon insertion events
and indel characters. All sequence partitions were executed with a GTR + I + Γ model of evolution, as determined by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) via
MrModeltest 2.2 [131]. Mt and nu sequence data were
partitioned in the analysis of mt + nu data (separate
models with a rate multiplier for branch lengths) as in
McGowen et al. [20]. For each Bayesian analysis, two
concurrent runs of 20 million generations were conducted with trees sampled every 1000 generations. Stationarity of likelihood scores was assessed using Tracer
v1.04 [132]; split frequencies of runs were evaluated
with “Are We There Yet?” (AWTY [133]). Using these
assessments, the first 10% of trees was discarded as
“burn-in.” A 50% majority-rule consensus of post “burnin” trees from concurrent runs was erected to summarize PPs for all clades. An additional Bayesian analysis
was executed in which each “gene” in the overall molecular dataset was permitted to have a unique model of
evolution; in this run, mtDNA was treated as a single
linkage group. Results for this more finely partitioned
and parameter-rich analysis were identical to those for
our Bayesian run in which the data were divided into
mt and nu partitions.
Maximum-likelihood analyses (ML) were conducted in
RAxML 7.2.3 [134,135] using CIPRES. The following
analyses were done: nu DNA sequences and all DNA
sequences combined. For the ML analysis in which all
sequence data were included, mt and nu data were separated to permit independent modeling of nucleotide
evolution. Searches were conducted using standard
default parameters of the GTRMIX option, which uses a
GTR + Γ model of evolution. To assess nodal support,
200 bootstrap replicates were simultaneously executed
in RAxML [135].
A division of the molecular dataset into more subpartitions (codon positions, exons, introns, etc.) was not
attempted. The overall molecular supermatrix assembled
for this study is quite complex and includes a wide
array of molecular data, including mt 1st codons, mt 2nd
codons, mt 3rd codons, mt stop codons, mt intergenic
regions, mt rDNA stems, mt rDNA loops, mt tRNA
stems, mt tRNA loops, mt regions where two protein
coding genes overlap (and where codons cannot be classified as 1st, 2nd, or 3rd because a particular site might
be a 1 st codon for one mt gene and a 2 nd codon for
another mt gene), mt regions that are protein coding in
some taxa but not in others (because the position of the
stop codon has shifted during evolutionary history), nu
1 st codons, nu 2 nd codons, nu 3 rd codons, nu stop
codons, nu introns, splice sites in nu introns, nu pseudogenes, nu regions that are protein coding in some
taxa and are pseudogenic in others (e.g., enamel specific
genes in toothed and toothless whales; some of the

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

olfactory receptor loci), nu 5’ noncoding regions, nu 3’
noncoding regions, multiple members of particular nu
gene families, positively selected genes (e.g., PRM1,
MCPH1, and milk caseins), negatively selected genes
(most mt and nu genes), and so on. Previous efforts at
resolving cetacean phylogeny (Figures 1, 2) have not
been nearly as inclusive as our supermatrix, and this
separates our analysis from previous studies. Rather
than excluding much molecular data so that fewer, welldefined molecular partitions remain (e.g., previous analyses of mt genomes that have limited analysis to only
protein coding regions that do not overlap with each
other and are encoded by the same DNA strand), we
attempted to include as much of the available systematic
data for Cetacea as possible (including morphological
and paleontological information) and have not finely
partitioned our matrix. Instead, we divided the data into
mt and nu datasets or by gene, and have used a rate
multiplier and the gamma distribution to account for
rate variation among data partitions and sites within a
given partition. Our approach to resolving cetacean phylogeny resulted in a very long DNA sequence alignment
with much missing data (see Figure 3), but we feel that
this framework is the best way to summarize all of the
available character evidence that is relevant to relationships among cetaceans. Studies that fill missing data
entries in our supermatrix, that attempt more complicated partitioning schemes, or take a coalescence
approach [136] will provide future tests of the phylogenetic hypotheses presented in our study.
Simultaneous Analyses of Molecular and Morphological
Data

A Bayesian analysis of the complete supermatrix was
attempted. Unfortunately the search could not be completed, likely due to the difficulty in placing relatively
incomplete fossil taxa, the very large size of the supermatrix, missing molecular data (Figure 3), and/or difficulties in optimization of branch lengths. After 30
million generations, concurrent runs had failed to converge, and there was little resolution within each run.
As an alternative to a Bayesian analysis of the combined
matrix, the morphological partition was analyzed using
parsimony but with relationships among extant taxa
constrained to fit the topology obtained by ML/Bayesian
analyses of the molecular partition (also known as a
“backbone constraint” or “molecular scaffold;” see
[137]). Homoplastic morphological characters were
down-weighted in the constrained analysis using implied
weighting as implemented in TNT (k = 3) [40].
Parsimony was utilized as the primary method of analysis for the supermatrix of morphological and molecular data. Analyses were executed in TNT and checked
using PAUP* (see above). Characters were weighted as

Page 27 of 33

in the combined analysis of Seiffert [124]; character
state transformations in ordered, multistate characters
were downweighted so that these characters had the
same minimum length as binary characters. For both
molecular and morphological partitions, character state
changes in unordered multistate characters were given
the same weight as transformations in binary characters.
Indels were coded as described above.
To quantify the character evidence for particular
clades supported by parsimony analysis of the supermatrix, branch support (BS) [48] and double decay branch
support (ddBS) [47] were estimated. Calculation of these
indices involves finding the shortest trees that lack a
particular clade of interest. To recover these suboptimal
trees, a TNT module written by P. Goloboff was utilized
http://tnt.insectmuseum.org/index.php/Scripts; this procedure automatically calculates BS using constrained
searches. Defaults of the module were employed, except
that 100 replicates for each constraint search were
conducted.
For the supermatrix of extant and extinct taxa (74
OTUs), BS was first calculated for all nodes supported
by the combined parsimony analysis. The supermatrix is
characterized by extensive missing data, especially for
fossils that can only be coded for a subset of the morphological partition and for none of the molecular characters. Therefore, we executed additional analyses and
focused our assessments of character support on relationships among extant cetacean taxa. To measure BS
for relationships among living species within the context
of the fossil data, ddBS analyses [47] were executed.
Backbone constraint trees [127] that defined relationships among extant taxa were used to estimate the minimum number of extra character steps required to
disrupt these relationships. The constraint trees did not
include any of the extinct taxa, but all extinct taxa were
utilized in analysis. The phylogenetic placements of
extinct taxa relative to the extant taxa were not fixed, so
fossils were allowed to “float” in constrained tree
searches [47]. Only the differential costs of contrasting
relationships among extant taxa, irrespective of the positions of extinct taxa, were noted. These length differences, ddBS, were calculated for all monophyletic
groupings of extant taxa supported by the 74-OTU
supermatrix.
Testing Temporal Implications of Phylogenetic
Hypotheses

Analyses were conducted to determine the fits between
trees supported by the complete supermatrix and the
geologic record. The geologic ranges of extinct taxa
sampled in the morphology partition are listed in Table
2 (also see Additional file 1: Table S2). To compile this
table, records of sampled species were downloaded from

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

the paleobiology database http://paleodb.org/. Many of
the cetacean records on this database were entered as a
result of previous studies on changes in cetacean diversity [138,139]. The records were then culled to remove
fossil remains of questionable identity (described as
“aff.”, “cf.”, or “?”). The stratigraphic ranges of undescribed OTU’s from the Charleston Museum vertebrate
paleontology collection are from Geisler and Sanders
[2]. Focusing on species records is a conservative
approach, which in some cases may lead to an underestimate for the range and first appearance datums
(FADs) of higher-level clades. However, we were unwilling to assume monophyly of extinct clades that were
not explicitly tested in our phylogenetic analyses.
The highest temporal resolution available for many
records downloaded from the paleobiology database is
stage, although stratigraphic provenance is usually
reported as well. In some cases (e.g. Calvert Group),
subsequent geologic studies have provided better constraints on the ages of cetacean-bearing geologic units
(e.g, [140]), and these improved age estimates were used
when available. Estimates for FADs and LADs (last
appearance datums) are averages of the oldest and
youngest ages for the smallest reported stratigraphic
interval (Table 2; Additional file 2: Table S2). In cases
where the duration of a stratigraphic unit is unknown,
the age of the OTU is the same as the average of the
uncertainty for the age of that unit. Although some
extant species have been found in sediments of Pleistocene age, given the uncertainty of the ages of these sediments and the magnitude of the 41 million year record
covered by the extinct taxa sampled, the ages of all
extant taxa were set to the present day.
To determine the degree of fit between the geologic
record, as listed in Table 2, and phylogenetic hypotheses,
the modified Manhattan stratigraphic measure (MSM*)
[141] and the gap excess ratio (GER) were calculated
[142]. Both measures reflect required ghost lineages,
which is the amount of extra time a lineage is assumed to
have existed based on an earlier appearance of its sistergroup [143]. Each measure treats time as an irreversible
character, in the current case, a 17 state character for
each unique FAD. MSM* is comparable to the consistency index of the stratigraphic character whereas the
GER is comparable to its retention index [144]. As with
those indices, the MSM* and GER are scaled to range
between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating fewer
ghost lineages and a better fit between phylogeny and the
geologic record. The significance of this fit was assessed
using the method of Siddall [145]. The GER, MSM*, and
the significance of the latter were calculated using TNT
[122] with a script provided by D. Pol.
In all phylogenetic analyses of the supermatrix, Oligocene OTU’s were excluded from crown Odontoceti and

Page 28 of 33

from crown Mysticeti in all minimum length trees (see
Results). To assess the significance of these results,
sequential ddBS analyses were conducted on two nodes,
crown Odontoceti and crown Mysticeti. A total of 25
separate analyses were run, one for each extinct Oligocene OTU, using the supermatrix with character weights
as described above. In each analysis, the backbone constraint tree included all extant taxa and one extinct
taxon. If an extinct stem odontocete was included, then
a search was conducted for the shortest tree that did
not include a monophyletic crown Odontoceti. Similarly,
if an extinct stem mysticete was included, then a search
was conducted for the shortest tree that did not include
a monophyletic crown Mysticeti. Using this procedure,
the shortest trees that placed Oligocene OTU’s inside
these crown groups were recovered. To determine the
ddBS, the length of minimum length trees (which had
Oligocene taxa outside of these crown groups) was subtracted from the length of the suboptimal trees that had
Oligocene taxa within the crown clade. The magnitude
of ddBS scores provides a measure of the degree to
which the supermatrix contradicts these suboptimal
topologies; following Lee [146], Templeton/Wilcoxon
rank sum tests [147] were conducted on each pair-wise
comparison between a suboptimal topology and each
minimum length tree to assess the significance of ddBS
values. Winning-sites test were also conducted on the
same pairwise comparisons [148]; both statistical tests
were performed in PAUP* [128].

Appendix
Appendix 1. Definitions, etymology, and morphological
diagnoses for new clade names.
Plicogulae, new clade name, unranked.
Definition: Plicogulae refers to the least inclusive clade
within Mysticeti that includes the most recent common
ancestor of Caperea marginata, Balaenoptera physalus,
and Eschrichtius robustus. This is a node-based definition that can be abbreviated as <Caperea marginata
&Balaenoptera physalus & Eschrichtius robustus.
Etymology: Derived from Latin for “throats with
grooves,” referring to the grooves on the ventral side of
the head and neck. In Balaenopteridae, these grooves
allow for great expansion of the oral cavity during filter
feeding [149].
Reference phylogeny: Figure 5 of the present study.
Composition: Based on Figure 5, Plicogulae includes
Balaenopteridae, Eschrichtiidae, and Caperea. It specifically excludes Balaenidae, as well as the extinct mysticetes Pelocetus and Diorocetus, although we recognize
that the exclusion of these two extinct genera is not
strongly supported.
Morphological diagnosis: Plicogulae is diagnosed by
the following features: zygomatic processes of the

Geisler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:112
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/112

squamosal directed anteriorly (char. 142, state 0); lambdoidal crests of the occiput overhang the temporal fossa
(153, 0); dorsal edge of tegmen tympani (i.e. superior
process) is indistinct (232, 3); and longitudinal, external
grooves on ventral side of head and neck (301, 1). All of
these characters exhibit some homoplasy, and the diagnosis presented here is based on unequivocal synapomorphies that are shared between the tree in Figure 5
and the trees summarized in Figure 6.
Synrhina, new clade name, unranked.
Definition: Synrhina refers to the least inclusive clade
within Odontoceti that includes the most recent common ancestor of Platanista gangetica, Ziphius cavirostris, and Tursiops truncatus. This is a node-based
definition that can be abbreviated as <Platanista gangetica &Ziphius cavirostris &Tursiops truncatus.
Etymology: Derived from Classical Greek for “together
nose”, referring to the fact that the soft tissue nasal passages distal to the external bony nares are joined for
nearly their entire lengths [4].
Reference phylogeny: Figure 5 of the present study.
Composition: Based on Figure 5, Synrhina includes
Delphinidae, Phocoenidae, Monodontidae, Inioidea,
Lipotidae, Ziphiidae, Platanistidae, Squalodelphinidae,
Eurhinodelphinidae, Kentriodon, Atocetus, and Albireo.
Although not included in our phylogenetic analysis, following the hypothesis of Muizon [8], this clade likely
includes other “kentriodontids.” Specifically excluded
from this clade are Physeteridae, Kogiidae, Xenorophidae, Simocetus, and Agorophius.
Morphological diagnosis: Synrhina is diagnosed by the
following characters: proximal ethmoid region exposed
in dorsal view (char. 92, state 1); nasal passages are confluent immediately distal to external bony nares (95, 2);
right soft tissue nasal passage is oriented dorsoventrally
(96, 1); presence of blowhole ligament (101, 1), and presence of premaxillary sacs (105, 1).
Monodontoidae, new clade name, unranked.
Definition: Monodontoidae refers to the least inclusive
clade within Odontoceti that includes the most recent
common ancestor of Monodon monoceros and Phocoena
phocoena. This is a node-based definition that can be
abbreviated as <Monodon monoceros &Phocoena
phocoena
Etymology: Derived from Classical Greek for “one
tooth”, referring to the single large tusk in male members of the species Monodon monoceros.
Reference phylogeny: Figure 2 of McGowen et al. [20].
The tree from that study is suggested as the reference
phylogeny because members of Monodontidae were
sampled at the species level, thus making the above definition easier to apply. For reasons described in the
Materials and Methods, we included Monodontidae as a
single OTU. Regardless, the minimum length trees for

Page 29 of 33

our supermatrix as well as those supported by McGowen et al. [20] yield the same composition for
Monodontoidae.
Composition: Monodontoidae includes the families
Monodontidae and Phocoenidae. According to Muizon
et al. [150], this clade may also include Odobenocetops,
but this hypothesis needs to be tested with computerassisted phylogenetic analyses. Monodontoidae excludes
Delphinidae and Inioidea.
Morphological diagnosis: Monodontoidae is diagnosed
by the following characters: large exposure of fused
lacrimal and jugal on roof of orbit (char. 55, 2); nasal
bears fossa for posterior nasal sac (i.e. caudal sac) (117,
2); low lambdoidal crests of the occiput (153, 2); short
anterior sinus, which is an extension of the pterygoid
sinus system (157, 1); tympanosquamosal recess borders
only part of the glenoid fossa (178, 2); and sternum
composed of a single bone (290, 1). This list includes
unambiguous, Monodontoidae synapomorphies that are
shared by the parsimony and Bayesian constraint trees
that we recovered in the present study (Figures 5, 6).

Authors’ contributions
All authors contributed to the research plan executed in this collaborative
research. JHG collected all new morphological data, analyzed the
morphological partition, executed most of the parsimony analyses of the
supermatrix including all branch support calculations and character
optimizations, conducted all analyses that tested temporal implications, and
took the lead in writing the manuscript. MM collected new molecular
sequences, compiled molecular data from Genbank, assisted in sequence
alignment, and conducted all Bayesian/ML analyses. GY collected all new nu
DNA sequences from the Yangtze River dolphin, as well as additional DNA
sequence data. JG wrote several sections of the text, generated new DNA
sequences, compiled molecular data from Genbank, executed sequence
alignments, was responsible for final integration of data into the
supermatrix, conducted parsimony analyses of molecular data and the
supermatrix, and drafted the figures. All authors contributed to the text of
the manuscript, have read it in its entirety, and approved its final version.
