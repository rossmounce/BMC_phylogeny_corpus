Abstract
Background: Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play an essential role in genome rearrangement
and evolution, and are widely used as an important genetic tool.
Results: In this article, we present genetic maps of recently active Insertion Sequence (IS) elements,
the simplest form of MGEs, for all sequenced cyanobacteria and archaea, predicted based on the
previously identified ~1,500 IS elements. Our predicted IS maps are consistent with the NCBI
annotations of the IS elements. By linking the predicted IS elements to various characteristics of
the organisms under study and the organism's living conditions, we found that (a) the activities of
IS elements heavily depend on the environments where the host organisms live; (b) the number of
recently active IS elements in a genome tends to increase with the genome size; (c) the flanking
regions of the recently active IS elements are significantly enriched with genes encoding DNA
binding factors, transporters and enzymes; and (d) IS movements show no tendency to disrupt
operonic structures.
Conclusion: This is the first genome-scale maps of IS elements with detailed structural
information on the sequence level. These genetic maps of recently active IS elements and the
several interesting observations would help to improve our understanding of how IS elements
proliferate and how they are involved in the evolution of the host genomes.

Background
Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) can move themselves
within a genome and between genomes. They play key
roles in modification of gene expression patterns by generating insertion mutations [1-3] and in genome rearrangement and evolution through homologous
recombination [4-6]. Some of them, such as Tn5 in E. coli
[7] and Salmonella typhimirium [7,8], have been extensively used to mediate insertional mutagenesis to perform
genetic studies. The simplest form of MGE is the insertion
sequence (IS) element, which usually encodes only a trans-

posase [9]. IS elements are widely distributed in eubacterial and archaeal domains [9-11] and more than 1,500
different IS elements have been identified as of now [12].
IS elements are usually organized compactly, most of
which span 700 to 3,500 bps [see Additional file 1, Table
S1]. Many IS elements have only one ORF, encoding a
transposase, while others have more than one ORF
[9,13,14]. For an IS element with more than one ORF, the
first (upstream) ORF encodes a DNA recognition domain,
while the second one, overlapping the first one, encodes

the catalytic domain. Typically a so-called slippery codon in
a heptamer nucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ in the overlapped region between the two ORFs incurs a -1 translational frame-shift, providing a regulatory mechanism for
the cell to express either a DNA binding domain or a
transposase. One of the most commonly observed example in IS elements is A AAA AAG, which occurs in IS2,
IS150, IS222, IS861, IS895, IS904 and IS1133 [15]. There
are two classes of IS elements, i.e. TIR (terminal inverted
repeats) IS elements and non-TIR IS elements. A TIR IS element carries a pair of (partially conserved) inverted
repeats at the two termini of an IS for cleavage and binding of the transposase, as shown in Figure 1 (a), while a
non-TIR IS element (Figure 1 (b)) does not harbor significant signals around its termini. Our current knowledge is
still limited about how an non-TIR IS element is recognized and cleaved by its encoded transposase [9]. The
regions between the two termini but outside the ORFs are
called linker sequences (Figure 1). The ~1,500 known IS elements in ISfinder [12], the most comprehensive IS database, are categorized into 20 families and some of them
are further categorized into 27 groups [12] based on the
similarities of their genetic organizations, transposase
sequences and the TIR signals [9,13] [see Additional file 1,
Table S1]. Currently all but one IS family (the IS200/
IS605 family) are made of TIR IS elements.
While some IS elements have proliferated across multiple
eubacterial and archaeal genera, many others were only
found in a few closely related organisms. Currently only
~220 out of the ~1,500 IS elements in ISfinder [12] are
reported to appear in more than one genome, and the
general distributions of IS elements across a genome or
multiple genomes are not well understood. Hence it is scientifically interesting and important to study the distributions of IS elements across prokaryotic genomes to
understand how IS elements proliferate and promote the
evolution of their host genomes [16,17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/36

Previous studies on characterization of IS elements, or
transposable elements in general [18-25], have been
mostly focused on a few transposable element families
rather than attempting to understand their genome-scale
distributions. Typically, these computational studies identify transposable elements using one of the following
approaches or their combination: (a) identification of
transposable elements based on sequence similarity
search against known transposons [18,19,22,26,27], (b)
identification of short TIRs or long terminal repeats flanking the predicted coding regions of candidate transposons
[26,28-31], and (c) identification of all the insertion
events through alignments of multiple closely related
genomes to determine the inserted regions associated
with other features such as the ones in (a) and (b) [32].
We believe that only through identification of all the
known IS elements at a genome scale could we possibly
discover some of the hidden governing rules about IS elements and their distributions.
In this paper we have investigated the endogenous characteristics of each group of IS elements, as defined in ISfinder
[12], and built a sequence profile for each of them. Then
we present genome-scale maps of predicted IS elements,
based on the known elements in ISfinder, across cyanobacteria, one subgroup of eubacteria, and all the
sequenced archaea along with some observations derived
from these large-scale IS maps. In terms of prediction
accuracy, we have demonstrated that our method performs better on cyanobacteria and archaea than the only
available large-scale IS prediction program, IScan [33].
The focus in this study is on the recently active IS elements
(raIS), which are defined as IS elements with multiple
copies of highly similar sequences in the same genome
[34].

Results and Discussions
Profiles for IS groups
While the coding regions have been extensively used to
identify IS elements, the TIR signals and the lengths of
linker sequences of IS elements, though highly conserved
for some IS groups, have not been used much for prediction of IS elements. For these groups, the TIR signals of the
IS elements in each group usually contain a conserved
motif, as shown in Figure 2 (a) and 2 (b). Other IS groups
may not have conserved sequence motifs as shown in Figure 2 (c) and 2 (d). The similarity among the TIR signals
was measured using a position weight matrix (PWM) constructed from the TIR signals of known IS elements in the
same IS group [35], and the profiles of non-TIR IS elements do not include the TIR signals (see Figure 2 (e)).

The linker sequences of IS elements in the same group
tend to have similar lengths, as shown in Figure 2, and
could be used to help identify IS elements as well. For
example, although the TIR signals of IS elements in the "" group of the IS630 family are too weak to be recognized,
both the 5' and 3' linker sequences generally have conserved sequence lengths in most of the cases (Figure 2 (c)).
(For convenience, we define a group "-" for each IS family
to accommodate the IS elements with no group information in that family in the ISfinder database. So there are 47
IS groups in total, including the "-" group for each of the
20 IS families.)
We have built a sequence profile for each IS group in
ISfinder based on the coding sequences, the linker
sequences and the TIR signals, if there are any. Additional
file 2, Figure S1 shows the sequence profiles for all the 36
IS groups with at least 10 members.
Overview of raIS maps
We chose cyanobacteria, a very diverse group of bacteria
that inhabit a wide range of living environments [36], and
archaea as the target organisms in our study, and have
applied our Insertion Sequence Annotation (ISA) system
to the genome sequences of the 50 selected organisms (19
cyanobacteria and 31 archaea). All the raIS maps of the
cyanobacteria and archaea are provided in a database that
is accessible through an easy-to-use web interface [37]. 45
IS elements are predicted to be recently active in the 19
cyanobacteria, and they cover 11 IS families, while 104 IS
elements from 12 IS families are predicted to be recently
active in the 31 archaeal genomes.

Comparing our predicted IS elements to the NCBI annotations, we found that our prediction covers essentially all
the raIS elements annotated by NCBI. The few missing
ones are mostly due to the fact that these IS elements have
not been active enough recently to have two highly conserved copies in the host genomes, as shown in column I2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/36

of Additional file 1, Table S2. The remaining missing ones
are annotated as putative transposases or IS elements that
have not been deposited in ISfinder (column IPuative and
INovel of Additional file 1, Table S2). The percentage of
the NCBI IS genes that are missed by our prediction is
lower than 10% for all the 50 genomes except for three,
Anabaena variabilis ATCC29413 (19.32%), Pyrobaculum
islandicum DSM 4184 (21.43%) and Sulfolobus solfataricus
(15.40%). Many of them are misannotated and should be
IS elements that have not been deposited in ISfinder. For
example, almost all such genes in Anabaena variabilis
ATCC29413 are annotated as transposases of IS4 from the
IS4 family, but the E-value of BlastP search between them
and IS elements from IS4 family is greater than 9.8.
Many IS related genes are annotated as putative transposases
by NCBI while our prediction provides more detailed
information for most of these IS elements (column APutative in Additional file 1, Table S2). In addition, our prediction also finds many IS genes that were not recognized by
NCBI, and almost all of them were annotated as hypothetical proteins by NCBI (column ANovel and ANovePutative
of Additional file 1, Table S2).
We have further compared our IS prediction with the prediction by the IScan program [33], the only available prediction program on the Internet, on a test set consisting of
IS elements from 20 IS families from ISfinder, whose TIR
signals and protein sequences have been curated by Wagner et al [33]. On this test set, IScan did not find any IS elements in cyanobacteria or archaea while our prediction
results are summaried in Additional file 1, Table S2. This
low prediction sensitivity might be due to the high specificity set by the IScan program in identification of the TIR
signals. It should be noted that for numerous groups in
ISfinder, the IS elements from the same group may not
have conserved TIR signals, as shown in Figure 2 as well as
in Additional file 2, Figure S1.
Another comparison we made is with a data set, manually
curated by Filee et al [11], which surveyed all the known
IS elements in archaeal genomes. Their results regarding
which IS group has presence in archaea are given in Additional file 1, Table S1. Our prediction agrees well with the
results by Filee et al except for 11 IS elements (ISHma4,
ISH4, ISH50, ISNph2, ISMma22, ISHma12, ISC1041,
ISMac15, ISMbu9, ISArch5, ISMac21 and ISMbu4), which
were not predicted by our program Among these 11 elements, one element, ISC1041, is only observed in S. solfataricus MT-4, whose genome has not been sequenced, and
all other 10 elements have only one or two full copies in
the host genomes, below our cutoff for raIS element prediction.

We have carefully analyzed our predicted raIS elements in
the 50 genomes. We observed that in our raIS maps, raIS
elements tend to be clustered together in the host
genomes. As shown in Additional file 1, Table S3 where
each genome is partitioned into 100 kbp windows, the
numbers of raIS elements within these windows vary substantially. Some windows, say in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, could have as many as 18 raIS elements,
while at least 50% of the windows contain at most 1 raIS
element. This observation holds for the majority of the 50
genomes under study. This could be due to the fact that IS
elements tend to insert their copies into the so called
hotspot regions, where new IS insertions may be less lethal
to the organism [10]. Another possible explanation could
be that the nearby genomic region of a raIS copy may have
similar accessibility for the enzymes involved in transposition.
We find that raIS elements of different IS groups clearly
have different distributions. 28 out of 47 (59.57%) IS
groups show recent activities in cyanobacteria or archaea,
and the two most widely deployed ones (the groups "-" of
families IS4 and IS630) appeared in at least 9 organisms
[see Additional file 1, Table S1]. On the other hand, there
are 19 IS groups (40.43%) that were silent in both cyanobacteria and archaea. We also found that there are 6 and
11 IS groups that appear only in cyanobacteria and
archaea, respectively [see Additional file 1, Table S1]. Similar numbers are also observed at the IS family level.

Common characteristics of prokaryotes with large
numbers of raIS elements
From the predicted raIS maps, we find that the numbers
of raIS elements in different cyanobacteria and archaea
vary significantly, and many organisms don't harbor any
raIS elements, as shown in the two phylogenetic trees for
the 19 cyanobacteria and 31 archaea, respectively (Figure
3 and 4). Specifically, no raIS elements are found in
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, except for the two newly
sequenced strains, Synechococcus sp A prime and B prime,
while all the other 6 cyanobacteria have very active IS elements, called raIS-enriched organisms. We did not observe
similar patterns in archaea, possibly due to the very small
sampling pool consisting of archaeal genomes with distant relationships. Nevertheless, there are two groups of
archaea, Sulfolobus and Methanosarcinales, which harbor
many copies of raIS elements. It is intriguing to learn
whether there are any other common characteristics
among the raIS-enriched organisms besides the phylogenetic relationships, which may be key factors to the mode
and tempo of genome evolution. Clearly the living environment should be one of the first factors to consider.

It was proposed before that IS elements were actively
involved in genomic rearrangements when the host
organisms were in certain living environments [38,39].
Our result suggests that hot springs seem to be one of the
favorite living environments for organisms with active IS
elements. Four out of the six organisms retrieved from hot

We have further compared the distribution of each IS
group in our annotations and in the ISfinder database, as
shown in Additional file 1, Table S1. Four IS groups are
identified to be in cyanobacteria by ISfinder, but they seem
to have no recent transposition activities, since there were
no predicted raIS elements from them in cyanobacteria.
Similarly, there are 7 such IS groups in archaea. In addition, we have discovered recently active members from 6
IS groups that were not proposed by the ISfinder database
to appear in cyanobacteria, while no such a group was
identified in archaea.
It is worth mentioning that a single-copy IS element might
also be active in the host genome. For example, a recently
invaded IS element in a genome might not have enough
time to accumulate more than one copy. But it is difficult
to identify the complete structures of these IS elements.
This work defines raIS elements as those with two other
highly conserved copies in the same genome, and identifies the complete structures of the IS elements with recent
activities by comparing the multiple copies of the same
element.

springs are raIS-enriched except for Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM639 and Thermofilum pendens Hrk 5, as shown in
Additional file 1, Table S4. Two of the raIS enriched
organisms were previously known to harbor active IS elements [40,41], and the two newly sequenced hot spring
living Synechococcus strains are predicted to have many
copies of IS genes by our program as well as by the NCBI
database. Another interesting observation is that none of
the five archaeal organisms living in thermal vents have
raIS elements.
Organisms living in other environments, such as dry land
and sewage sludge, are highly diversified in terms of the
abundance of raIS elements in their genomes. This may
indicate that the living environment might not be the only
factor determining activities of IS elements.
We have also investigated the correlation between the
genome size and the number of raIS elements in a
genome. We have used the Spearman's correlation coefficient to check the null hypothesis that the number of raIS
elements in a genome is independent of the genome size.
As shown in Figure 5, the Spearman's correlation coefficient for our data is 0.5092, and the P-value for the null
hypothesis (i.e., the two values are not correlated) is

7.95e-5. So the hypothesis is rejected and therefore we
conclude that the number of raIS elements in a genome
tends to increase with the genome size.
It would be interesting to confirm these observed common characteristics of raIS-enriched organisms on a much
larger set of genomes.
Functions of neighboring genes of raIS elements
Many IS elements could possibly affect the expression patterns of the neighboring genes. For example, the outward
directed promoter hexamers inside the TIR signals of
many IS elements, such as IS1, IS2, and IS5, may activate
the expression of the neighboring genes, if the IS elements
are inserted appropriately [9,13].

We have carried out an analysis on the enriched GO functional categories among the neighboring genes of raIS
insertions, and calculated a P-value for each GO functional
category to evaluate the probability that it appears just by
chance. Additional file 1, Table S5 shows the enriched GO
functional categories with P-values < = 0.05 in each organism and their enrichment ratios (ER), as defined in Materials and Methods. While we found that the enriched
functions in the neighborhoods of the known IS elements
are quite diverse, there are several interesting common
patterns in the significantly enriched functions in the
neighboring genes of the raIS elements.
We have observed that the neighboring genes of raIS elements are significantly enriched with genes that encode
transposases (GO:0004803) in two organisms, i.e. Cyanobacteria bacterium Yellowstone A Prime (ER = 8.21) and
Sulfolobus solfataricus (ER = 9.3). This might suggest that IS
elements tend to insert their copies into the neighboring

regions of themselves, since these regions have proved to
be safe for receiving transpositions previously. And the
mechanism might have contributed to the development
of the hotspot regions that received much higher numbers
of transpositions than other parts of the same genome, as
observed in the above. Besides the transposases
(GO:0004803), other DNA binding factors (GO:0003677
and GO:0003702) are also significantly enriched in the
neighboring regions of raIS insertions. For example, the
enrichment ratio of RNA polymerase II transcription factors (GO:0003702) reaches 19.62 in Sulfolobus tokodaii, as
shown in Additional file 1, Table S5.
Transporters are another category of genes that are
enriched around IS elements in 9 out of 23 organisms
(39.13%) with raIS annotations (3.1 â¤ ER â¤ 35.18), as
shown in Additional file 1, Table S5. They are mainly
organic acid and amine transporters. Genes encoding different ion transporters are also significantly enriched in
the neighbors of raIS elements in Pyrococcus furiosus (ER =
28.72), Methanosarcina barkeri fusaro (ER = 35.18), Methanosaeta thermophila PT (ER = 19.38) and Thermosynechococcus elongatus (ER = 6.94) [see Additional file 1, Table S5].
As far as we know, this has not been observed and
reported in the published literature, and may require further experimental validation.
The flanking regions of some enzymes seem to be another
favorite place for IS transposition. The neighboring genes
of raIS elements are enriched with transferases in 13 out
of the 23 (56.52%) organisms with raIS annotations (2.51
â¤ ER â¤ 142.35). Specifically, the enrichment ratio of nicotinate nucleotide dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (GO:0008939) reaches 142.35 in
Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Another enzyme tRNA ligase is
enriched with ratio 121.14 in the neighbors of raIS elements in Haloarcula marismortui ATCC 43049, and two
other genomes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/36

scribed individually. However since all the raIS elements
are not transcribed together with the neighboring genes,
the transcription of the genes in these operons, whose
internal regions received recent IS transpositions, would
have been totally disrupted without the original transcription starting or terminating signals. Such drastic change of
operons could possibly be lethal to the organisms. This
suggests an alternative explanation that IS elements do
not tend to insert into operons.
In summary, raIS insertions do not have the tendency to
transpose into the inner regions of operons, which would
in general disrupt the operon structures with IS's endogenous transcriptional promoters or terminators.

Conclusion
We have presented genome-scale maps of recently active
IS elements in cyanobacteria and archaea with complete
genomes. Based on these maps, we observed that the size
of the host genome and the living environment seem to be
two important factors to the activity level of IS transposition. Many IS elements seem to prefer inserting into the
regions close to the previously transposed IS elements,
which might have led to the creation of hotspot regions
that harbor many more copies of raIS elements than other
regions in the same genomes. IS elements seem also to
prefer inserting into neighboring regions of genes encoding other DNA binding factors, transporters and enzymes.
It is not observed that an IS element lands into an operon
without disrupting the operon structure. And usually the
IS elements just avoid inserting into operons.
The genome-scale maps of the raIS elements in this work
provide highly informative data for studying the distributions of IS elements and how they incur recombination
mutations to the host genomes, which represents the next
step of our study.

Methods
Transpositions do not prefer inner regions of operons
Insertion of an IS element into an operon might disrupt
its structure and hence its function. So we have studied
where the predicted raIS elements tend to be with respect
to the operonic structures in a genome.

There are ~181 multi-gene operons containing ~454
genes in each genome on average predicted by VIMSS
[42]. Other genes are assumed to constitute single-gene
operons. Almost all predicted raIS elements form operons
with themselves with no other genes, as shown in Additional file 1, Table S2. It's interesting to observe that all
raIS elements do not reside in the same operon with their
neighboring genes in both cyanobacteria and archaea.
One explanation is that an IS element transposed into an
operon and separated it into two parts that could be tran-

Datasets
We have manually collected 1,356 IS elements with both
sequences and terminal signals from the ISfinder database
[12] as the templates for our identification of IS elements
and map construction in the target genomes. The reason
that we did not use some of the ~1,500 IS elements in
ISfinder is that they are not completely characterized and
may not have all the information needed for prediction of
IS elements in other genomes.

We chose to investigate the distributions of IS elements in
19 cyanobacteria with complete genome sequences (available in Dec 2006) as the representative group of eubacteria. Since there were only 31 archaea with complete
genome sequences (as of Dec 2006), we included all the
sequenced archaea in our study. The genome sequences

and their annotations were downloaded from the NCBI
Genome Project ftp server [43]. The Gene Ontology (GO)
annotations of their genes were downloaded from Integr8
[44,45]. Operons for these organisms were predicted
using VIMSS [42] with default cutoff score 5.

dom longer than 50 bps, we calculated a position weight
matrix (PWM) for the 50-bp 5' and reverse complementary 3' terminal sequences of the IS elements in each IS
group. The coding regions of the predicted full copies are
considered as the background.

Since NCBI database provides a comprehensive collection
of annotations for each sequenced genome, we chose to
investigate the commonalities and differences between
our predictions of raIS elements and the NCBI annotated
IS genes, whose encoded proteins' annotations are done
based on their associated keywords such as IS, transposase, or putative transposase.

The score of a 50-bp nucleotide sequence t by scanning
with a PWM profile M is calculated similarly to that in
[35]:

IS profiles
Each family or group of IS elements shares some common
characteristics in their encoded proteins, their linker
lengths and TIR signals if there are any. We provide a
measurement for each of these factors, and integrate them
using a neural network to predict a region as an IS element.
Encoded proteins
Proteins encoded by IS elements from the same IS group
are highly similar to each other, while only little or no
sequence similarity between the proteins in different IS
groups could be observed. Specifically 97.62% of the pairs
of all the encoded proteins in different IS groups have
lower than 10% sequence conservation, while ~80% of
the pairs of encoded proteins in the same IS groups have
higher than 10% sequence conservation, as shown in
Additional file 2, Figure S2 (a). Similar numbers are
observed at the IS family level [see Additional file 2, Figure
S2 (b)]. We have used tblastn [46] to map all the proteins
encoded by the template IS elements onto the target
genomes, using e-5 as the E-value cutoff. Some IS elements
carry more than one ORF, and we merge the neighboring
matching regions into one element if they match the proteins encoded by the same IS template, and reside in a
structure that keeps the order and corresponding distance
among the encoded proteins of the IS template. Only the
elements that have no missing ORFs when compared to
the IS templates, called full copies of coding regions of the
corresponding IS templates, are kept for further analysis.

The maximum E-value of the matching regions of a predicted full copy, denoted as pIS, is defined as its overall Evalue. The score for this copy is defined as Scorec(PIS) = ln(overall _E - value(pIS))
TIR signals
TIR signals of IS elements in the same IS group tend to be
conserved, as shown in Figure 2 and Additional file 2, Figure S1. Due to that IS elements in the same IS group can
have different lengths of the TIR signals and they are sel-

threshold 0.15 is chosen based on our working experience
in this project, and other threshold values for the information content may be chosen for TIR signal recognition
possibly with a different level of prediction specificity.
We have retrieved the upstream and downstream flanking
sequences of a predicted full copy of a TIR IS element in
the target genome with the same lengths as those of the IS
template, as illustrated in Additional file 2, Figure S3. The
50-bp regions with maximum scores are predicted as the
5' and 3' TIR signals for this full copy pIS, respectively. And
the scores are denoted as ScoreTIR(pIS,5) and ScoreTIR(pIS,3), respectively.
Linker sequences
We now present a model for scoring the linker sequences
of a potential IS element, which has not been much used
for IS element prediction previously if any. Based on our
preliminary study, we found that only the linker lengths
of IS elements in the same IS group may have some discerning power as they tend to be conserved. We have used
the following scoring scheme to score the candidate linker
sequences for a given IS template. This scoring scheme

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/36

tends to remove outliers and give higher scores for bins
with more compact known data.
Given a group of IS templates, (IS1, IS2, ..., ISn), let the
lengths of 5' and 3' linker sequences of template ISi be
L5(i) and L3(i), respectively. Based on the lengths of 5'
linker sequences, the IS elements are equally partitioned
into m bins, B1, B2, ..., and Bm, at the interval from

min{L 5(k)} to

1â¤ k â¤ n

( max{L (k)} + 1 ) , where m is a user
1â¤ k â¤ n

defined integer. Let the number of IS elements in Bj be |Bj|,
and the maximum value in Bj be aj. Let a 0 = min{L 5(k)} .
1â¤ k â¤ n

For a predicted IS element pIS with 5' linker sequence
length L5, if it belongs to the above IS group and falls in
bin Bj based on L5, the score to indicate how similar this
predicted element is to the known IS elements in the same
group is defined as Scorel(pIS, L5) = |Bj|/aj - aj-1). The score
for the 3' linker sequence with length L3 is defined as
Scorel(pIS, L3) similarly.
IS annotation system (ISA)
We have employed the following procedure to annotate
raIS elements in a genome.

Step 1. Predict the full copies of the coding regions of all
the known IS templates in ISfinder, as described in Section
4.2.1. A region may be predicted as full copies of the coding regions of two IS templates, and only the copy with
smaller overall E-value will be kept.
Step 2. Predict linker sequences and TIR signals, if there
are any, for each full copy from Step 1:
a) Predict TIR signals for each copy of TIR IS elements,
using the method outlined in Section 4.2.2. And retrieve
the linker sequences between the TIR signals and the coding region.
b) For each predicted full copy of the other IS templates,
we find the recently transposed copies, which are defined
as having sequence identity higher than 80%, and expand
the flanking regions to find the linker sequences that also
have higher than 80% sequence identity.
Step 3. Find the highly conserved copies, which are defined
as having more than 80% sequence identity, of a candidate IS element in the same genome.
Step 4. Calculate the scores for the coding region, the
linker sequences and TIR signals of a predicted IS element
pIS as Scorec(pIS), Scorel(pIS, L5), Scorel(pIS, L3), ScoreTIR(pIS,5) and ScoreTIR(pIS,3), respectively.

Step 5. A candidate IS element from the above steps is
annotated as a raIS element, if it is predicted as an IS element by the neural network predictor (see Section 4.4),
and it has at least two other highly conserved copies in the
same genome.
The prediction performance of the neural network predictor will be evaluated with 10-fold cross validation in the
next section.
To make our annotations of IS elements more informative, we also provide the NCBI genes that overlap our predicted IS elements for each of the predicted raIS elements.
An NCBI gene is called the covering gene of a raIS element,
if their overlapping region is at least 80% of the length of
either of them.
The TIR signals were not very conserved even for IS elements of the same IS group, as shown in the schematic
illustrations of IS group profiles in Figure 2 and Additional file 2, Figure S1, and some of the raIS elements do
not even have predicted TIR signals. The potential TIR signals were retrieved from the terminal sequences of these
predicted raIS elements using NCBI blast [46,47].
10-fold cross validation of neural network predictor
We mapped the nucleotide sequence of each IS template
onto the prokaryotic genome where it was retrieved, and
retrieved the copies with at least 80% sequence identities
as the positive copies of this IS template. There are 5,344
positive copies of 615 IS elements in total. We constructed
a negative copy by randomly choosing a 5,000-bp region
without homologs to transposases in a prokaryotic
genome, found the best matched transposase to that
region using tblastn, and predicted the linker sequences
and TIR signals, if there were any, for the negative copy.
We constructed the same number of negative copies to
that of the positive ones.

We used a neural network implemented in Weka [48] to
predict whether a region pIS is an IS element based on the
three values, Scorec(pIS), ScoreTIR(pIS,5) +ScoreTIR(pIS,3),
and Scorel(pIS, L5)+Scorel(pIS, L3). A copy of an IS element
is considered to be a true positive if it is predicted to be a
copy of that IS element or its synonyms and isoforms; otherwise it is a false negative. And a data is considered as a
true negative if it is predicted not to be a copy of any IS element; otherwise it is a false positive. Let the numbers of
true positives, false negatives, true negatives and false positives of the prediction results of the neural network be TP,
FN, TN, and FP, respectively. The following measurements, sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp), are used to measure the prediction performance of our neural network
predictor:

The averaged sensitivity and specificity of 10-fold crossvalidation of the neural network over 20 runs are 0.83 and
0.99 respectively. IS elements from the same IS groups
could be too similar to be easily distinguished from each
other. For example, 542 pairs of IS elements from the
same IS groups share at least 90% sequence similarities,
although they are not synonyms or isoforms. ~94% of the
false negatives are predicted as IS elements belonging to
the same IS groups with the true IS elements.

Functional enrichment analysis
We have investigated whether the neighboring non-raIS
genes, within 5,000 bps in distance to the annotated raIS
elements in a target genome, are enriched with genes in
any particular functional categories according to Gene
Ontology (GO). The hypothesis is that the genes occur in
the neighborhood of raIS elements by uniform randomly
drawing from the pool of all genes in the genome. Let the
number of genes in a target genome be N, and n of them
be in a specific functional category GOF. M non-raIS genes
in this genome reside within 5,000 bps in distance to the
raIS elements, and m out of them are in the functional category GOF. The enrichment ratio of category GOF is
defined as:

The probability of having exactly i genes of category GOF
in the M non-raIS neighboring genes just by chance could
be modeled by a hypergeometric distribution [49]:

ï£« n ï£¶ï£« N â n
ï£¬ ï£·ï£¬
i
Mâ i
P(i | N , n, M) = ï£­ ï£¸ï£­
ï£«N ï£¶
ï£¬
ï£·
ï£­ Mï£¸

ï£¶
ï£·
ï£¸.

And the P-value describing that the functional category
GOF appears at least m times in the M non-raIS neighboring genes just by chance can be calculated as:

m

p =1â

â
i =0

ï£« n ï£¶ï£« N â n

ï£­ i ï£¸ï£­ Mâ i

ï£¸.

The above hypothesis would be rejected for the functional
category GOF if its P-value is significantly lower. Functional categories with P-values < = 0.05 are listed in Additional file 1, Table S5.
