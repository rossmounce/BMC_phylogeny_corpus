Abstract
Background: Although allopatric speciation is viewed as the most common way in which species originate, allopatric
divergence among a group of closely related species has rarely been examined at the population level through
phylogeographic analysis. Here we report such a case study on eight putative cypress (Cupressus) species, which each
have a mainly allopatric distribution in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent regions. The analysis involved
sequencing three plastid DNA fragments (trnD-trnT, trnS-trnG and trnL-trnF) in 371 individuals sampled from
populations at 66 localities.
Results: Both phylogenetic and network analyses showed that most DNA haplotypes recovered or haplotypeclustered lineages resolved were largely species-specific. Across all species, significant phylogeographic structure (NST
>GST, P < 0.05) implied a high correlation between haplotypes/lineages and geographic distribution. Two species, C.
duclouxiana and C. chengiana, which are distributed in the eastern QTP region, contained more haplotypes and higher
diversity than five species with restricted distributions in the western highlands of the QTP. The remaining species, C.
funebris, is widely cultivated and contained very little cpDNA diversity.
Conclusions: It is concluded that the formation of high mountain barriers separating deep valleys in the QTP and
adjacent regions caused by various uplifts of the plateau since the early Miocene most likely promoted allopatric
divergence in Cupressus by restricting gene flow and fixing local, species-specific haplotypes in geographically isolated
populations. The low levels of intraspecific diversity present in most species might stem from population bottlenecks
brought about by recurrent periods of unfavorable climate and more recently by the negative impacts of human
activities on species' distributions. Our findings shed new light on the importance of geographical isolation caused by
the uplift of the QTP on the development of high plant species diversity in the QTP biodiversity hotspot.
Background
Geographic isolation between populations within species
is a major precursor of allopatric speciation [1,2]. In the
absence of gene flow, different alleles become fixed in different populations through the action of selection and/or
genetic drift potentially leading to the origin of new species [3]. It is expected, therefore, that in regions where
geographic isolation is common, for example, in areas
where high mountains separate populations occurring in

deep valleys, allopatric divergence will be promoted and
accelerated due to the formation of locally adapted gene
pools and possibly the origin of intrinsic postzygotic isolation according to the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller
model [3-5]. A phylogeographic analysis of closely related
species that occur in such areas can be instructive on the
importance of geographic isolation and allopatric divergence in their origin and subsequent evolution [6].
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent
regions comprise an excellent mountainous system for
studying plant diversification and evolution. Levels of
plant diversity and endemism in these regions are very
high and some core areas are regarded as biodiversity

hotspots (e.g. [7]). A few studies in this region have begun
to elucidate the process of species diversification and/or
trace shifts in the ranges of single species during the Quaternary climatic oscillations (e.g. [8,9]). However, no previous studies have attempted to examine genetic
differentiation in this region among species of a closely
related group, and in so doing shed light on their respective evolutionary histories. Here we report such a case
study of a group of cypress species (Cupressus L.) that
occurs on the QTP and adjacent areas of China and the
Himalayas. Cypresses are trees or shrubs native to scattered localities in temperate regions in the northern
hemisphere. Because of their attractive morphology they
are important in horticulture and are widely cultivated in
many parts of the world [10]. In several mountainous
regions of the QTP, cypresses form natural forests [11].
From the results of a recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of cypresses, Little [12] concluded that True
Cypresses only encompass species in the Old World, and
that those in the New World should be transferred to
Callitropsis. As a result, the genus Cupressus has been recircumscribed to comprise 12 Old World species, distributed respectively in the Mediterranean region and Africa
(C. sempervirens, C. dupreziana and C. atlantica) and
Asia (C. torulosa, C. gigantea, C. cashmeriana and C. austrotibetica in the high altitude region of the QTP and
west Himalayas, and C. duclouxiana, C. chengiana, C.
funebris, C. jiangeensis and C. tonkinensis in the low altitude region of the eastern QTP, central China and Vietnam [12]). Morphological distinction between some of
these species is marginal causing taxonomic delimitation
to be disputed, especially between Asian species [10,1219]. We followed Little [12] and treated all taxonomic
units recognized by him as separate species. Most of
these Asian species occur allopatrically in the QTP and
adjacent regions, and only a few are parapatric in parts of
their range (Fig. 1) (Additional File 1) [10,15].
We used plastid (mainly chloroplast) DNA sequence
data to examine interspecific divergence and to assess
intraspecific diversity of these species. Plastid DNA is
paternally inherited and dispersed mainly by pollen in all
species of the Cupressaceae investigated [20-23]. Recent
studies suggest that paternally inherited plastid DNA
sequences in conifers may be species-specific and therefore effective in tracing lineage sorting between species
[24-27]. Plastid DNA sequence variation has been used
previously in phylogenetic studies of cypresses, but only
single sample from most species were examined [12]. In
addition, surveys of RAPD variation [28] and nuclear ITS
variation [29] have been conducted within and among
cypress species including those examined in the current
study. However, the results of these studies were inconsistent with regard to interspecific relationships [12]. In this
study, we aimed to address the following questions based

on surveys of sequence variation for three plastid DNA
fragments within and between populations at the species
level: (1) Do plastid DNA haplotypes or clusters of such
haplotypes correspond with morphological differentiation and the allopatric distributions of the Cupressus species examined? (2) Does intraspecific DNA diversity
correlate with the natural population size of a species
and, in turn, provide guidance for conservation management?

Results
Haplotype distribution and relationships

In total, 30 haplotypes were identified (Additional Files 1,
2 and 3, Fig. 1), of which 17 occurred in C. chengiana (N
= 89), seven in C. duclouxiana (N = 86), two in C. funebris (N = 89) and four among C. gigantea (N = 58), C.
jiangeensis (N = 1), C. austrotibetica (N = 22), C. cashmeriana (N = 4) and C. torulosa (N = 22). No intraspecific
cpDNA variation was recorded in C. gigantea, C. jiangeensis, C. cashmeriana, C. austrotibetica and C. torulosa.
Cupressus cashmeriana and C. austrotibetica shared the
same haplotype, which differed by a single nucleotide
from the haplotype possessed by C. torulosa. These two
sequences were very different from the haplotype possessed by C. gigantea. A neighbour joining analyses
showed that the 30 haplotypes clustered into six different
lineages (A-F) with most haplotypes being species-specific (Fig. 2). Although all six lineages were recovered in
the 50% strict consensus tree of 51267 most parsimonious trees (CI = 0.77, RI = 0.87, Length = 141), the pattern
of relationships between lineages received low bootstrap
support (Fig. 2). Lineage A comprised nine haplotypes
possessed by individuals of C. chengiana sampled from
Gansu province, China. In contrast, the other eight haplotypes detected in this species were present only in individuals sampled from Sichuan, China, which together
with the single haplotype (H5) recovered from C. jiangeensis, comprised lineage E. The sister relationship
between lineages A and E was poorly supported. Lineage
D was composed of the single haplotype present in C.
torulosa plus the haplotype shared by C. austrotibetica
and C. cashmeriana, and was sister to lineages A and E
(Fig. 2) of C. chengiana. The seven different haplotypes
detected in C. duclouxiana formed a monophyletic lineage C, which was sister to lineage B that consisted of the
single haplotype possessed by C. gigantea. Lineage F
comprised the two haplotypes specific to C. funebris and
was sister to the five other lineages (A to E) and to two
cypress species occurring out of Asia. To evaluate the origins of these lineages (species), we selected the commonest haplotype representing each lineage and dated their
origins. According to the estimated nucleotide mutation
rate for Cupressus (Additional File 4), C. funebris was
estimated to have diverged from the other lineage/species

approximately 26 million years ago (Mya) (Additional File
4). C. duclouxiana in the eastern QTP diverged from the
western C. gigantea around 10 Mya, while the eastern C.
chengiana diverged from the western C. torulosa/C. austrotibetica/C. cashmeriana lineage around 13 Mya. The
intraspecific divergence that gave rise to the two different
lineages of C. chengiana identified was dated to approximately nine Mya.
Because the number of mutations distinguishing any
two lineages was always greater than six, we constructed
separate haplotype networks for the three lineages that
contained most haplotypes (i.e. lineages A, C and E).
Within lineage E, two haplotypes H10 and H3 occurred
in a small sub-lineage that was separated by four mutations from other haplotypes (Fig. 2). However, H10 cooccurred with the most frequent haplotype in this lineage, H4, in most sampled populations. The single haplotype (H5) recovered from C. jiangeensis was also present
in lineage E and is derived from H4. In lineage A, H17
was the most distantly related haplotype relative to other
haplotypes (Fig. 2).

Diversity among and within species

Genetic differentiation across all species was high (Table
1, 2) and showed significant phylogeographic structure
(NST (0.962) >GST (0.791), P < 0.05). Mantel tests revealed
a significant association (r2 = 0.2285, P < 0.001) between
genetic differentiation and geographic distances between
populations over all species. For C. chengiana and C.
duclouxiana, total intraspecific diversity (HT = 0.791 and
0.659, respectively) across populations was higher, but
not substantially, compared with the average within-population diversity (HS = 0.536 and 0.443, respectively).
Within C. duclouxiana, interpopulation variation
accounted for a high proportion of intraspecific variation
(23.3%, Table 2), indicating strong differentiation
between populations. The significant phylogeographic
structure of C. chengiana reflected the presence of two
distinct lineages (A and E) within this species that were
located in Gansu and Sichuan provinces, respectively.
This regional divergence accounted for 44.2% of the total
variation recorded within C. chengiana (Table 2). Variation within each of these lineages was almost entirely
attributed to variation within populations (Table 2, note

that H5 of C. jiangeensis was included in the calculations
for lineage E). Rare haplotypes were frequent in many
populations that were representatives of lineages A or E.
In C. funebris, two haplotypes were recovered, but no
variation was recorded among populations.

Discussion and Conclusions
Two broad findings emerge from our population-level
phygeographic study of the eight Cupressus species that
occur in the QTP and adjacent regions. First, there was
generally good correspondence between the major plas-

tid DNA lineages/haplotypes identified and the morphological taxonomy of species in the group [12]. Such
divergence in plastid DNA sequence between species in
this group probably results from their allopatric origins
and the maintenance of broadly allopatric distributions
following extensive uplifts of the QTP since the Miocene.
Second, the amounts and pattern of intraspecific plastid
DNA variation recorded differed greatly among the species examined. Species with restricted natural distributions contained low levels of intraspecific diversity
relative to those having wide natural distributions. These

development of high plant species diversity in the QTP
biodiversity hotspot and also the distribution of intraspecific diversity within this region.
Allopatric divergence

Phylogenetic relationships among the major plastid DNA
lineages detected were largely consistent with those
resolved for species in a previous plastid DNA phylogeny
constructed by Little [12] based on other plastid DNA
sequences and mainly single sample per species. Interestingly, in both phylogenies the Mediterranean C. sempervirens and C. atlantica were nested within the Asian
lineage indicating that they probably originated from this
lineage. Phylogenetic relationships resolved in both plastid DNA phylogenies were a little different from those
constructed from RAPD or nuclear ITS sequence data
[12,28,29]. Because these latter studies sampled only one
or very few individuals from each species, it remains
unknown whether the nuclear variation reported was
species-specific or not. In contrast to the other studies,
our investigation is the only one to have examined molecular variation in cypresses at the population level. Our
results suggest that two species (C. austrotibetica and C.
cashmeriana) share the same haplotype, which is very
similar to the single haplotype detected in C. torulosa.
However, all three of these species differ in morphology
[12]. The fact that two very distinct cpDNA lineages were
recovered from northern and southern populations of C.
chengiana, is of further interest in that plants from these

two regions have sometimes been treated as separate subspecies [13,14]. Thus, our cpDNA data support this division; however, morphological as well as further molecular
studies are necessary before a taxonomic revision of this
and other Asian cypress species is contemplated.
Our data show that plastid DNA lineage sorting is
nearly complete between recognized morphological units
of Asian Cupressus (Fig. 2). Furthermore, across all populations and species examined, a strong signal for phylogeographic structure is present: NST (0.962) was
significantly larger than GST (0.791, P < 0.05) (Table 1),
demonstrating that gene-flow is very low between these
broadly allopatric species (Fig. 1). According to preliminary calibrations, C. funebris diverged from the other lineage/species around 26 million years ago (Mya), while the
two major east-west divergences between C. duclouxiana
and C. gigantea, and between C. chengiana and the C.
torulosa/C. austrotibetica/C. cashmeriana lineage, were
dated to around 10 Mya and 13 Mya, respectively.
Although these estimates of dates of origin should be
treated with caution, they correspond well with geological evidence that the QTP was extensively uplifted from
the early Miocene to the Pliocene [30-34]. It is likely that
these extensive uplifts created fragmentation and isolation of habitats, which promoted repeated allopatric speciation of Cupressus in the QTP and adjacent regions.
The formation of high mountains separated by deep valleys will have reduced gene flow between Cupressus populations that were diverging into different species in
different valleys and hastened the fixation of locally spe-

cific haplotypes. However, allopatric differentiation usually results in the origin of 'paraphyletic' species because
of incomplete lineage sorting [6]. Thus, the formation of
almost completely mutual 'monophyletic lineages' correlated with morphological units, which we recorded here,
is likely to have been brought about by repeated extinctions and/or genetic drift in the isolated habitats [3-5]. A
hypothesis of the allopatric origin of each Cupressus species in a different valley or valley system is supported by
the low level of inter-population differentiation and minimal population substructure observed in most species/
lineages except C. duclouxiana and C. chengiana (Table
2). In these latter two species, a high level of population
differentiation was recorded among geographically isolated regions, but very little population divergence within
such regions (Fig. 1, Table 2). Two lineages of C. chengiana may partly reflect a long history of divergence with
the species fragmented into two separate areas in the
north and south of western China approximately nine
Mya.
The presence of strong geographical isolating barriers
in the form of high mountains might also have contributed to rapid species diversification in other plant groups
present in the QTP [9,35-38]. For example, in the genus
Ligularia, most species with distinct morphologies and
restricted distributions are thought to have originated
through allopatric isolation from a common ancestor
within a very short time correlated with the period of
extensive uplift of the QTP [36]. Our phylogeographic
analysis at the population level of closely related cypress
species in the QTP, thus provides further evidence for
geographic isolation acting as a driving force of high rates
of speciation in this and adjacent regions.
Intraspecific diversity

Whereas high levels of plastid DNA diversity were
recorded in C. chengiana and C. duclouxiana, only one or
two haplotypes were present in each of C. gigantea, C.
austrotibetica, C. cashmeriana, C. torulosa and C. funebris. This difference in intraspecific diversity is highly
correlated with the natural distribution ranges of the
sampled species [10-19]. Cupressus gigantea, C. austrotibetica, C. cashmeriana and C. torulosa occur sparsely at
high altitude in the QTP and the west Himalayas, which
have been highly vulnerable to the effects of global climatic change [30]. These species might have been more
widespread during periods of more favorable climate in
their history. Alternatively or in addition, their restricted
distributions might be a consequence of the negative
impacts of human activities. Either way, they may have
experienced severe population bottlenecks in the relatively recent past which reduced significantly their
genetic diversity. In contrast to the other four species,
Cupressus funebris is distributed in central and eastern

Page 7 of 10

China and adjacent regions where adverse climatic effects
should have been less intense. It seems, however, that
most natural populations of this species have become
extinct in the wild and only a few, comprising trees of
large size, survived in south China and north Vietnam
[10-19]. However, according to our own field observations, even these populations (for example, the Ruyuan
population in Guangdong) (Additional File 1) are likely to
have been artificially cultivated because these large trees
grow around one ancient temple. The presence of only
two haplotypes in this species may be a legacy of its widespread cultivation and eradication from the wild as seems
also to be the case for C. sempervirens in Europe [39]. In
contrast to these Asian cypress species showing low levels of plastid DNA diversity, C. duclouxiana, and C. chengiana contain high levels of diversity and occur at lower
altitude at the eastern margin of the QTP, where they
might have experienced fewer bottlenecks and/or
founder effects caused by historical climatic change [30].
It is also to be noted that most extant populations of C.
chengiana are natural, as are populations of C. duclouxiana except those cultivated in North Yunnan, and therefore are likely to have been less affected by human
activities and subsequent bottleneck effects.
All of the species examined, except for C. duclouxiana
and C. funebris, are listed as endangered [11]. Genetic
diversity is critically important for a species' evolutionary
potential in the face of environmental change, and loss of
genetic diversity is often associated with reduced fitness
[40]. The amounts and distribution of genetic diversity
within these cypress species are thus important in regard
to formulating appropriate plans for conservation purposes. Based on the amounts and distribution of plastid
DNA sequence variation within these species, it would
seem that for most species, conservation of only a few
populations will be sufficient to maintain plastid DNA
diversity at current levels. However, the high population
differentiation found in C. duclouxiana (Table 1) suggests
a need to conserve more populations for maintenance of
plastid DNA diversity in this species. Similarly, in C.
chengiana our results make clear that conservation of
multiple populations in both Gansu and Sichuan provinces will be necessary to ensure that plastid DNA diversity is maintained in this species.

Methods
Species and samples

Leaf samples were collected from eight Asian Cupressus
species that were identified according to the recent taxonomic revision of Little [12]: C. chengiana S. Y. Hu, C.
jiangeensis N. Zhao, C. cashmeriana Royle ex Carrière, C.
duclouxiana Hickel ex Camus, C. funebris Endl., C. torulosa D. Don, C. austrotibetica Silba and C. gigantea W. C.

was C. tonkinensis Silba, which occurs in Vietnam and
across the Vietnam-China border. In total, samples were
collected from 371 trees over 66 populations (Additional
File 1), which covered most of the natural or cultivated
distribution of the species examined. All individuals of C.
austrotibetica sampled appeared to have been artificially
cultivated because they grew around ancient temples,
while three populations of C. duclouxiana (29, 30 and 31)
entirely comprised cultivated trees. Most populations of
C. chengiana and C. gigantea were natural, although a few
individuals in the Lixian seemed to have been cultivated.
Only one individual of C. jiangeensis was available for
analysis. When more than one sample was collected from
a population, samples were taken from trees at least 50 m
apart. The latitude, longitude and altitude of localities for
most populations sampled were recorded using an Etrex
GIS monitor (Garmin, Taiwan). Also surveyed were three
cultivated individuals of C. sempervirens sampled from
England, Italy and China, respectively, and one individual
of C. atlantica. We sequenced three individuals of the
New World cypress species as outgroups because recent
phylogenetic analyses suggest that all Old World cypress
species comprise a monophyletic lineage that is distinct
from the New World cypress lineage and juniper lineage
[12][41].
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

Genomic DNA was isolated from approximately 50 mg of
silica-gel dried, leaf-needle material using the CTAB
method [42]. Three to five individuals from each of 25
populations sampled across most species were used in an
initial screen of plastid DNA polymorphisms. Three different plastid DNA primer pairs were selected for use in
this scan, and all revealed polymorphism. Subsequently,
we used these three primer pairs to survey all individuals
sampled for the trnD-trnT [43], trnS-trnG [44] and trnLtrnF [45] regions, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed following the procedure of Zhang
et al. [46] in a 25-μL volume, containing 10-40 ng plant
DNA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
dNTPs, 2 μM of each primer, and 0.75 unit of Taq polymerase.
PCR products were purified using a TIANquick Midi
Purification Kit following the recommended protocol
(TIANGEN). Sequencing reactions were performed with
the PCR primers described above, to cover the whole
PCR segment using ABI Prism BigdyeTM Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit. Sequencing was
performed with BigDye Terminator 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 3130×l sequencer using the same
primers as used for PCR amplifications. Sequences were
aligned with CLUSTAL X [47] and double-checked manually. A matrix of combined sequences was constructed
for the 371 individuals examined, and showed that 30 dif-

ferent cpDNA sequences (haplotypes) were present. All
sequences have been deposited in the GenBank databases
under accession numbers HM008329-HM008379.
Data analysis

We used PAUP 4.0 [48] to perform maximum parsimony
and neighbour joining analyses to examine phylogenetic
relationships among cpDNA haplotypes (Additional File
3). All indels were coded as binary characters (0 or 1)
using the GAPCODER program [49] and those with further indels were sequentially assumed as multiple evolutionary events. Maximum parsimony analyses (equally
weighted characters and nucleotide transformations)
involved a heuristic search strategy with 100 replicates of
random addition of sequences, in combination with
ACCTRAN character optimization and MULPARS+TBR branch-swapping and STEEPEST DESCENT
options on. Bootstrap values for MP analyses (1000 replicates) were used to assess the relative support for monophyletic groups [50].
We used BEAST (under the common model GTR) [51]
to estimate the mutation rate of Cupressus and the possible divergence timescales of the main cpDNA lineages
across the eight Asian cypress species. We edited two
cpDNA (trnD-trnT, trnS-trnG and trnL-trnF) datasets
respectively. The first comprised three Cupressus species,
three Juniperus species, three Calitropsis species, one
species for Platycladus, Calocedrus, Chamaecyparis and
Thuja. The other included the most common haplotypes
of the Cupressus species and three Calitropsis species.
For analyses of both datasets, we excluded all indels and
only nucleotide mutations were considered. A strict
molecular clock assumption was rejected for both datasets because of significant rate heterogeneity among lineages. We used BEAST version 1.5.3 employing a
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain and
co-estimated topology to estimate the possible mutation
rate of Cupressus and divergence timescales across the
Asian cypress species. Under the GTR model of nucleotide substitution with a gamma distribution and four
rate categories, three tree prior models (Coalescent: constant size, exponential growth; and Speciation: Yule process) were implemented with rate variation across
branches assumed to be uncorrelated and log-normally
distributed. The model that yielded the highest posterior
probability estimates was employed to perform a final
analysis. For all analyses, posterior distributions of
parameters were approximated using two independent
MCMC analyses of 100,000,000 generations with 20%
burn-in. The program Tracer v1.5 [51] was used to check
Effective Sample Size (ESS) and the program TreeAnnotator 1.5.3 (part of the BEAST 1.5.3 package) was used to
combine all samples and to converge and/or summarize
output results. A tree with ages for each node and their

95% HPD were displayed and modified in FigTree v1.3.1
[51]. According to the fossil calibrations of the first dataset, a mutation rate of cpDNA (3.2 × 10-10 substitutions
per site per year) was obtained (Additional File 4). This
mutation rate was used to calibrate the interspecific or
interlineage divergences across the cypress species (Additional File 4).
An examination of interrelationships between haplotypes within lineages recovered in phylogenetic trees was
conducted using TCS 1.21 [52]. TCS was run with the
default parsimony connection limit of 95%. We assumed
that all coded indels and mutations evolved at an equal
rate. Estimates of unbiased genetic diversity (HE) [equivalent to expected heterozygosity for diploid data] were calculated as s: s = n/(n-1) (1- pi2), in which n is the number
´´
of samples in the population, k is the number of haplotypes, and p is the population frequency of the ith haplotype [53]. Where there were insufficient numbers of
individuals in a population, multiple nearby populations
were combined into a larger one for analysis (for example,
populations 43-46, each comprising a single tree, were
treated together as one population). Average gene diversity within populations (HS), total gene diversity (HT) and
two measures of population differentiation, GST (coefficient of genetic variation over all populations [54]) and
NST (equivalent coefficient taking into account sequence
similarities between haplotypes) were calculated using
the program PERMUT (available at http://www.pierroton.inra.fr/genetics/labo/Software/) [55]. Significant phylogeographic structure was inferred by testing whether
NST was significantly greater than GST using PERMUT
with 1000 permutations. Genetic structure was further
examined by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA,
[56]) as implemented in Arlequin version 3.01 [57]. The
significance of isolation by distance between populations
was tested using a Mantel test with 1000 random permutations on matrices of pairwise population FST values and
the natural logarithm of geographical distances [58]. Pairwise FST values between populations were estimated
using Arlequin while geographical distances between
populations were calculated with the help of the program
at http://www.indo.com/distance/ (e.g. [59]).
