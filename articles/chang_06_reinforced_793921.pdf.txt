Abstract
Background: Members of a protein family often have highly conserved sequences; most of these
sequences carry identical biological functions and possess similar three-dimensional (3-D)
structures. However, enzymes with high sequence identity may acquire differential functions other
than the common catalytic ability. It is probable that each of their variable regions consists of a
unique peptide motif (UPM), which selectively interacts with other cellular proteins, rendering
additional biological activities. The ability to identify and localize such UPMs is paramount in
recognizing the characteristic role of each member of a protein family.
Results: We have developed a reinforced merging algorithm (RMA) with which non-gapped UPMs
were identified in a variety of query protein sequences including members of human ribonuclease
A (RNaseA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Smaand-Mad related protein families (Smad). The UPMs generally occupy specific positions in the
resolved 3-D structures, especially the loop regions on the structural surfaces. These motifs
coincide with the recognition sites for antibodies, as the epitopes of four monoclonal antibodies
and two polyclonal antibodies were shown to overlap with the UPMs. Most of the UPMs were
found to correlate well with the potential antigenic regions predicted by PROTEAN. Furthermore,
an accuracy of 70% can be achieved in terms of mapping a UPM to an epitope.
Conclusion: Our study provides a bioinformatic approach for searching and predicting potential
epitopes and interacting motifs that distinguish different members of a protein family.

Background
Multiple protein sequence comparison can provide a valuable protein signature and, thus, contribute to the fields

of structural biology and molecular evolution [1,2]. In
general, sequence similarity identified by multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) among a set of query

The identification of UPMs among eight members of the human RNaseA superfamily by RMA
The identification of UPMs among eight members of the human RNaseA superfamily by RMA. (A) UPMs identified by RMA are marked as blue characters. The conservative residues at the ends of a UPM identified in the trimming phase
are labeled in orange. Three key catalytic residues His, Lys and His responsible for the ribonucleolytic activity are displayed as
open boxes in the conservative regions and shown in black characters. The brown, red, and black underline indicates the recognition sites for αRNase2, mAb 3C1 and D112-P123 Ab, respectively. The double underline represents the strict epitopes for
αRNase2 or mAb 3C1. (B) The UPMs identified by RMA are labeled in blue on the crystal structures of mature human RNase1
(PDB: 1E21, 128 residues), RNase2 (PDB: 1GQV, 134 residues), RNase3 (PDB: 1DYT, 133 residues), RNase4 (PDB: 1RNF,
119 residues), and RNase5 (PDB: 1B1I, 127 residues). The epitopes of αRNase2 (H73-Q77) and mAb 3C1 (Q58-R73) are
labeled in red. The identified UPM involved in the protein-cell interaction and angiogenesis in RNase5 is labeled in green (P64F76).

sequences suggests similar function among the proteins
[3]. These signatures can be readily obtained by webbased tools, such as BLAST [4], CLUSTALW [5], or
MUSCA [6] systems. However, although the default
parameters in most programs give satisfactory results, in
some cases special variables need to be taken into consideration. For example, the allocation of major variations
among a few query sequences can be achieved from the
results of direct MSA, whereas the uniqueness of each
sequence that is not well-aligned is difficult to reveal. It is
also quite expensive and time-consuming to experimentally search for such unique peptide motifs (UPMs) that
may involve the key biological functions of interest.
Therefore, the need for effective and efficient identification of the UPMs located in a number of query proteins by
novel bioinformatic tools is urgent. We have thus developed a reinforced merging algorithm (RMA) to rapidly
identify the non-gapped UPMs for each member of a protein family.
In our study, the highly conserved human ribonuclease A
(RNaseA) superfamily was initially tested to define the
default input parameters. The RNaseA superfamily is composed of eight RNases including RNase1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 with similar sequences and biological functions [7].
A pairwise comparison between RNaseA sequences shows
more than 29% similarity; especially for RNase2 v.s.
RNase3 and RNase7 v.s. RNase8, which have as high as
69.6% and 78.2% identities, respectively. Molecular evolutionary analysis revealed that both gene pairs emerged
as a result of a relatively recent gene duplication event [7].
In addition to the RNaseA superfamily, other protein families with larger molecular weights including the members
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Sma-and-Mad related protein
(Smad) family with respectively an average molecular
weight of 150 kD, 50 kD and 55 kD were analyzed.

A monoclonal antibody (mAb) is commonly used in biological experiments for distinguishing the sequence specificity, quantity variation, and cellular localization of
each member of the human protein families [8]. Generally, the epitope is composed of a charged and
hydrophilic peptide of 7 to 20 amino acids exposed at the
structural surface of the protein [9,10]. In this study, we
generated one mAb specifically against RNase3 and the
mapping experiments revealed that the epitope was
indeed located at a unique region in RNase3 identified by
RMA. Further analysis of several mAbs and polyclonal Abs
against human RNaseA, EGFR, and MMP families demonstrated that they all recognized specific epitopes corresponding to the UPMs identified by RMA. We also
mapped the UPMs on the resolved 3-D structures of the
proteins and found that most of the UPMs were located
on loop regions and exposed to the structural surfaces.
Furthermore, the analytic comparison between RMA and
PROTEAN [11], a commercially available software for prediction of antigenic regions, revealed that most of the
UPMs identified by RMA matched well with the antigenic
regions predicted by PROTEAN.

Results
Identification of the UPMs in the human RNaseA
superfamily by RMA
The eight sequences of mature human RNaseAs were
entered to RMA for analysis. As shown in Figure 1A, thirty
UPMs of four to sixteen amino acid residues are identified
and presented in blue. The orange characters at both ends
of a UPM represent the trimmed residues in the trimming
operators. The ones located between two blue sequence
stretches reveal that the adjacent UPMs are not sequential.

Only one UPM could be identified in each of the most
conservative RNase7 and RNase8, which is consistent
with the phylogenetic analysis results of the human RNa-

Localization of the identified UPMs in ErbB, ErbB2 and ErB3
Localization of the identified UPMs in ErbB, ErbB2 and ErB3. The identified UPMs are labeled in blue on the crystal
structures of extracellular domains in ErbB (PDB: 1NQL, 1210 residues), ErbB2 (PDB: 1N8Z, 1255 residues) and ErbB3 (PDB:
1M6B, 1342 residues). The EGF binding site on ErbB is labeled in green (S350-I356).

seA superfamily, strongly suggesting a close relationship
between RNase7 and RNase8 [7]. In addition, four and six
UPMs were respectively found in RNase2 and RNase3,
another highly conservative RNase pair. Likewise, in
RNase1, RNase5 and RNase6, three to four UPMs could be
located. Interestingly, as many as seven short UPMs were
identified in RNase4. Twenty-five UPMs located on the 3D structures of RNase1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were labeled in blue
(Figure 1B), and the loop coverage of each UPM was calculated (Table 1). It was found that fifteen UPMs were
located at loop regions in the 3-D structures of RNase1, 2,
3, 4, and 5 with loop coverage greater than 50%.
It should be noticed that the key enzymatic active site residues correspondent to His12, Lys41 and His119 of
mature RNase1 have been found to be located in the wellconserved regions among all eight RNases (Figure 1A,
open boxes), indicating that RMA is practical in distinguishing the UPMs from the conserved sequences in a
protein family. The UPM P116-Y122 located in the last
loop of the C-terminus of RNase3 has been determined as
the epitope for a polyclonal Ab, D112-P123 Ab, which
specifically recognized RNase3 and was generated by Boix
[12]. The UPM P64-F76 in RNase5 was located within a
sheet-turn-sheet conformation involved in the proteincell interaction (Figure 1B, labeled in green) [13].
Application of RMA on protein families with larger
molecular weight
We have further examined the application of RMA on
more protein families. The complete protein sequences of
four members of human EGFR family ErbB, ErbB2, ErbB3
and ErbB4 were analyzed by RMA, and forty UPMs were

identified. Fourteen UPMs located within the resolved 3D structures at the N-terminal extracellular domains of
approximately 530 residues in ErbB, ErbB2 and ErbB3
were labeled in blue (Figure 2). In ErbB, ErbB2 and ErbB3,
six, six and two UPMs of six to thirteen residues in length
were identified, respectively. Nine UPMs were found to
possess loop coverage higher than 50% (Table 1). A UPM
S350-I356 in domain III (L2) of the extracellular domain
in ErbB was also identified as an EGF binding site for
transduction of the ErbB signaling [14]. Another UPM in
ErbB2, H42-Q51, matched nicely within the epitope of
the anti-ErbB2 N-term polyclonal Ab (P36-Q51), an antibody that specifically distinguishes ErbB2 from the other
members of the EGFR family (Stratagene Corp., Cat:
B50175).
The sequences of mature human MMP1, 3, 8, 10, 12 and
13, which are categorized as members of the same subfamily and contain approximately 470 amino acids, were
analyzed by RMA and forty five UPMs were identified. The
results shown in Table 1 revealed that nine and six UPMs
of five to ten residues in length were identified in MMP1
and MMP3, respectively. Currently only the structure of
one of the catalytic domains (F1-P168) of MMP3 was
determined in which two UPMs, Q103-T111 and T145R151, could be identified by RMA. The former matched
nicely with loop 7 and the latter matched well with loop
8 in the MMP3 structure [15]. The UPM R273-I278 of
MMP1 overlapped with the epitope for a mAb αMMP1
(3B6) (residues S267-H277) (Santa Cruz, Cat: sc-21731).
Likewise, a UPM K218-P225 of MMP3 matched perfectly
with the characterized epitope for another mAb αMMP3
(1B4) (residues K218-H228) (Santa Cruz, Cat: sc-21732).

In addition, the enzymatic active sites of MMPs in the
highly conserved motif DDXXGIXXXYG (residues D152G162) [16] and Gln120 [17] numbered correspondent to
MMP1 were characterized to be located within the conserved regions, consistent with the results for the human
RNaseA superfamily (data not shown).
Eight human Smads were analyzed by RMA and twenty
four UPMs were identified. Currently only the C-terminal
structures of approximately 230 residues of Smad2,
Smad3 and Smad4 are available. Since the identified
UPMs in Smad1 and Smad2 were located in the regions
with unresolved structures, only the UPMs identified in
Smad4 were shown in Table 1. The UPM G510-I518 was
completely located in the L3 loop responsible for the
binding with Ski protein, an oncoprotein that represses
the TGF-β signaling. Another UPM E538-L551 with 64%
of loop coverage in the last loop within the MH2 domain
in the C-terminus of Smad4 was responsible for the interaction with the TGF-β receptors [18]. In the Smad superfamily, Smad4 plays a central role as it is the shared

hetero-oligomerization partner of other Smads and it possesses the DNA binding ability for regulation of gene
expression [19]. Within the DNA binding domain of
Smad4, K45-K110, only one UPM T62-H67 was identified
by RMA [20].
DOKs are phospho-proteins in the downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Six members of human DOK family,
DOK1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, of approximately 400 amino acids
were analyzed by RMA and forty four UPMs were identified. A UPM Y402-G410 located at the C-terminus was
found to be residing within the recognition site of an antibody αDOK2 (residues A393-K412) (Calbiochem, Cat:
506138); hence it is expected that αDOK2 can be used to
distinguish DOK2 from the other DOKs (data not
shown). Another protein family containing human carboxypeptidase D (CPD), E (CPE), M (CPM), N (CPN) was
also analyzed. One of the UPMs in CPE matched well with
the epitope for an anti-CPE mAb (BD Bioscience, Cat:
610758, data not shown). The analyses of EGFR, MMP,
Smad, DOK, and CP families demonstrated that for mem-

Application of RMA on homologous proteins from
different species
The sequence comparison of homologous proteins
among different species provides information on molecular and functional evolution. In this study, hRNase1 and
its bovine homologue bpRNaseA were analyzed by RMA.
The result shown in Table 2 revealed that six UPMs of six
to eight residues in length were identified in each
sequence. Ten out of the twelve identified UPMs were
included in the loops, indicating that the loop regions in
these two RNases were quite distinguishable. In addition,
a UPM K31-D38 in bpRNaseA was included in the recognition site (S32-V43) of a polyclonal antibody α RNaseA
generated by Younus and colleagues [21].

MsbA is a 630-amino acid prokaryotic homologue of
human multidrug resistant protein. Five prokaryotic
MsbAs from E. coli, V. cholera, G. violaceus, S. oneidensis,
and B. japonicum were analyzed by RMA and fifty two
UPMs were identified. Among which thirteen UPMs of
five to seven residues identified by RMA in E. coli and V.
cholera MsbAs were shown in Table 2. According to the 3D structures of MsbAs of E. coli [22] and V. cholera [23],
five of the identified UPMs were completely located in the
loop regions and 67%–83% residues of two UPMs were
covered by the loops. As a result, RMA has been demonstrated to be useful in analysis of homologous proteins
among several species to rapidly identify the unique signatures of each query sequence.

RMA still performed quite efficiently to provide useful
structural and functional information.

was further investigated. Bovine RNaseA (USB) and bacterial extracts containing recombinant human RNase1 (R1),

(Figure 3, top panel). The proteins were transferred onto a
PVDF membrane and probed separately by mAb 3C1 and
αRNase2 (Figure 3, middle and bottom panels). Our
results demonstrated that mAb 3C1 could specifically recognize RNase3 and RNase3-GFP but did not cross-react
with any other RNases or the expression tags (Figure 3,
middle panel). Similarly, the αRNase2 only probed the
recombinant RNase2 rather than the other RNases (Figure
3, bottom panel).
Epitope screening for mAb 3C1 and αRNase2
To further identify the epitopes residing on RNase3 and
correlate the experimental data with the identification by
RMA, the mature and several truncated RNase3 were fused
to GFP tags to efficiently express recombinant proteins
including RNase3-GFP (R31–133), RNase31–113-GFP (R31–

73), RNase351–73-GFP (R351–73), and RNase374–133-GFP
(R374–133). Upon induction with IPTG, these proteins
were expressed and recognized by αHis as a positive control (Figure 4A, top panel). After immunoblotting with
mAb 3C1, all recombinant proteins except the last one
were specifically recognized, suggesting that the epitope
for mAb 3C1 was located in the overlapping region within
RNase351–73 (Figure 4A, bottom panel; Figure 1A, red
underline), a region that is possibly the most distinguishable between RNase2 and RNase3.
According to the identification by RMA, residues 51 to 57
of RNase3 were identical to those of RNase2; hence this
region was further deleted to generate a recombinant
RNase358–73-GFP (R358–73) protein. As expected, Figure 4B
clearly showed that such a recombinant protein was
probed by both αHis and mAb 3C1, indicating that the
epitope for mAb 3C1 was indeed located within
RNase358–73, consistent with the identification by RMA
(Figure 1A, red double underlines).
The epitope for αRNase2 was not indicated in either its
manufacture or other reports. To allocate the epitope
region experimentally, three clones containing chimeric

RNase3/RNase2 were generated to express the chimeric
proteins in E. coli (Figure 4C). The chimeric junctions contain three separate regions where the residues are identical
between RNase2 and RNase3. Immunoblotting analysis
revealed that only chimera A was recognized by αRNase2,
indicating that P58–P90 of RNase2 was quite important
in determining the antigenicity (Figure 4D; Figure 1A,
brown underline). Based on the RMA and experimental
results, two recombinant clones RNase258–73-GFP (R258–
73) and RNase273–90-GFP (R273–90) were further generated.
The results showed that the former was not probed by
αRNase2, whereas the latter was specifically recognized
(Figure 4E, lanes 1 and 2). Since only five continuous residues in RNase273–90-GFP were predicted to be unique by
RMA, the recombinant RNase273–77-GFP (R273–77) protein
was further expressed and tested. Our result demonstrated
evidently that a segment as short as only five residues of
RNase2 were detected by αRNase2, indicating that the
epitope for αRNase2 was successfully narrowed down to
"H73SGSQ77" (Figure 4E, lane 3; Figure 1A, brown double
underlines).
Comparison of RMA and PROTEAN

antigenic regions in the primary sequence of individual

sequence [11]. Figure 5 shows the comparison between
the performance of our RMA and PROTEAN. It was found
that the epitopes of αRNase2, mAb 3C1 and D112-P123
Ab could be identified and predicted by both methods,
and the experimental data further provided direct evidence of such correlation. In addition, the peptides
"M60TCPSNKTR68" in RNase2 and "N19PPRC23" and
"Y98ADRPG103" in RNase3 identified by RMA also
appeared to have high potential to serve as specific and
antigenic peptide antigens. The merit of RMA lies in its
ability to provide additional information for rapid identification in silico of such antigenic peptides with high specificity.
Performance analysis of RMA
Since no specialized database for the epitopes of mAbs
against human proteins is currently available, the related
information was retrieved from the website of Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. which focused on the ongoing development of research antibodies [24]. Of 8398 items in the
database, only 83 mAbs were derived from antigens classified into 63 human protein families containing 264
sequences. Based on the criteria described in the "Methods" section, each set of the family protein sequences was
collected from GenBank and analyzed by RMA. It was
found that 275 UPMs could be located within the recognition sites of 66 mAbs. Thus, the accuracy of matching at
least one of the UPMs with the epitopes of the 83 selected
mAbs in this case was calculated to be 79.52% (66/83).
Figure 6 showed that as the lengths of the epitopes of the
selected mAbs decreased from 300, 200, to 100 amino
acid residues, the accuracy of a UPM being correlated with
an epitope decreased from 94.12%, 81.25%, to 70.59%,
respectively. Although the accuracy was length-dependent, an accuracy of higher than 70% could still be
achieved.

Discussion
We have demonstrated that RMA can identify UPMs in a
number of protein families during multiple sequence

comparison. Twenty-six sequences in four human protein
families have been analyzed as shown in Table 3. In comparison with the 3-D structures of RNase1, 2, 3, 4 and 5,
about 72% of the UPMs in the human RNaseA superfamily (18/25) was located in the loop regions of the
structural surfaces. As for the biological functions of the
UPMs, P64-F76 in RNase5 has been previously reported
to be involved in the protein-cell interaction [13] and angiogenesis [25]. It should be noticed that in eight members
of human RNaseA superfamily, only RNase5 possesses
such angiogenetic activity, indicating that the uniqueness
of P64-F76 correlates well with a specific function. In
addition, the loop areas are known to possess the most
flexible conformation and the residue compositions in
loops are usually quite variable. Many peptides in the
loop area have been reported to involve in molecular recognition by serving as the protein-protein interaction
domains [26], enzyme-substrate binding sites [27], hormone binding motifs [28], or DNA binding motifs [29].

In our case, RMA successfully picked up the most characteristic features of these peptides among several protein
families. Since the flexible conformation and variable residue composition in a loop region may provide additional specificity for recognition of Abs, identification of
UPMs may further aid in epitope mapping as well as peptide antigen design.
In this study, we reported the analysis of three large protein families including EGFR, MMP, and Smad with
respectively 39%-52%, 46%-78%, and 20%-92% pairwise
sequence identity to test the practical application of RMA.
The UPMs in the extracelluar domains of four members in
EGFR family were subsequently analyzed. Unlike RNases,
the extracellular domains in ErbB, ErbB2 and ErbB3
showed quite different conformations. In this particular
data set, we found that 71% of the UPMs in EGFR family
were located in the loops (Table 1). The UPM S350-K356
located within domain III (also named as L2) has been
identified as an EGF binding domain on the extracellular
domain of ErbB, the only member of the EGFR family that
EGF recognizes (Figure 2, labeled in green) [14]. Combined with the structural features of human RNase and
EGFR families, the UPMs provided additional information of many loops in the proteins with resolved structures. Thus, for the proteins without 3-D structural
information, it is speculated that the UPMs may also be
located in the loops to a considerable extent. Nevertheless, the possibility of a UPM being located in the welldefined α-helical or β-sheet structures cannot be excluded.
As for the MMP superfamily, more than twenty members
are currently classified, and several subfamilies are identified according to their domain compositions. It was thus
necessary to classify the members of such a big protein
family to several subgroups prior to RMA analysis. Accord-

ingly, we have correlated two identified UPMs in MMP3
with the loop structures.
The experimental epitope mapping results suggest that
some of the UPMs can serve as potential candidates to
generate specific Abs to distinguish the highly conservative sequences in a protein family. In the past, sequential
antigenic regions were determined based on the protrusion index, accessibility, mobility, charged amino acids or
hydrophilic regions at the protein surface [9,30-32]. However, a good antigenic region may not specifically distinguish one protein from the other members in the same
protein family. Our RMA has been demonstrated to efficiently discriminate the accumulation of unique features
of a peptide fragment to distinguish different regions in a
protein family. Although eight members of human RNaseA superfamily share high similarity, identification by
RMA has given thirty UPMs of four to sixteen amino acids
in length, among which at least three were demonstrated
to serve as epitopes for αRNase2, mAb 3C1 and D112P123 Ab (Table 1). In our case, theoretically 975 UPMs of
eight residues in length in the human RNaseA superfamily
can be identified. Therefore, RMA techniques have at least
increased the probability of finding a UPM in RNaseA
superfamily from 1/975 to 1/30. Likewise, the probability
of finding such UPMs in human EGFR, MMP, and Smad
families can be raised from 1/5087, 1/2784, and 1/3707
up to 1/39, 1/31, and 1/24, respectively. In ErbB2, a UPM
H42-Q51 was located within the epitope of αErbB2 Nterm (P36-Q51) at the first α-helix in domain I (Table 1)
[33]. This Ab can recognize the structural surface of the
well-folded extracellular domain. In addition, both
αMMP1 and αMMP3 can probe denatured and wellfolded proteins. Although 3-D structures containing the
epitopes for αMMP1 and αMMP3 are not resolved yet, it

Page 10 of 16

is speculated that these regions are also exposed at the surfaces.
As for cross species protein analysis, the identity between
bpRNaseA and hRNase1 was 68.8%. In these two highly
conservative homologues, six identified UPMs of each
RNase were localized in the corresponding positions in
their primary sequences. Structurally, 83.3% of these
regions were included in the loop areas of the resolved 3D structures of bpRNaseA and hRNase1. Interestingly,
except the first UPM, the loop coverage values of the second to the sixth UPMs in bpRNaseA are nearly the same
as those of hRNase1 (Table 2), indicating that the loop
areas of these two proteins are the most distinguishable.
Similarly, the analysis of MsbAs by RMA revealed that the
majority of the identified UPMs were located in the loop
areas. Hence, RMA has been demonstrated to be useful to
analyze homologous proteins from different species in
addition to different proteins in one family in a particular
species. The analysis of homologous proteins among different species may reveal the residue variation during
molecular evolution. To our knowledge, it occurs sometimes that an antibody was not successfully produced as
expected by injecting the immunized animals with a
designed peptide or protein, probably due to lack of the
uniqueness in the antigenic sequence [34]. Our RMA can
identify the UPMs that do not exist in the homologous
protein in the immunized animals; hence it can be used to
provide an initial screening for potential epitope design to
raise the probability of obtaining polyclonal antibodies
against synthetic peptides.
In comparison with other motif-finding methods, MEME
(Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) system can discover
the motifs with highly conserved regions in a group of
related protein sequences. It represents motifs as positiondependent letter-probability matrices which describe the
probability of each possible letter at each position in the
pattern [35,36]. MAST (Motif Alignment & Search Tool)
can search the biological sequence databases for
sequences that contain one or more known motifs which
are represented as position-dependent scoring matrices
that describe the score of each possible letter at each position in the pattern [37]. The MASIA algorithm recognizes
the common patterns and properties in multiple aligned
protein sequences. It converts a sequence to a properties
matrix that can be scanned in both vertical and horizontal
steps. Consistent patterns are recognized based on the statistical significance of their occurrence [38]. PROSITE is a
document database which collected a large number of
biologically meaningful motifs that described as patterns
or profile [39]. The main characteristics of these four
sequence prediction algorithms are determination of the
motifs with similar features. We have specifically analyzed
the eight human RNase A sequences using PROSITE. It

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/38

was found that the biological motifs such as potential
phosphorylation sites and glycosylation sites identified by
PROSITE were actually located within the conservative
regions, none of them was identified as a UPM by RMA
analysis. We have also matched all the biological motifs or
pattern matrices in the PROSITE database with the proteins in PDB database. It was found that 35.31%, 24.68%,
0.64% and 39.36% of the PROSITE patterns were located
at the α-helix, β-sheet, turn, and undetermined regions,
respectively. Unlike the RMA results, only a few PROSITE
patterns were located at the loops. Our RMA reinforces the
non-conserved patterns and extracts the motifs with more
than 8 residues. These UPMs are demonstrated to be correlated well with the loops exposed on the structural surface, or regions that are known to be able to serve as
molecular recognition sites. It is conceivable that such
unique sequence-dependent functional characteristics
may be detected by our method, although the novel functional properties still remain to be explored. Evolutionally, the random unique sequence pieces are expected to
be evenly distributed or randomly scattered in the entire
protein sequences by statistical estimation. They are not
specifically located in the loops. If a particular random
mutation occurs in a position that is crucial for maintaining the structure integrity or catalytic function of a protein
family, either the preservation of the mutation during
evolution is disfavoured, or a dysfunctional protein
would be generated to cause disease. On the contrary, the
UPMs identified by our method are evolutionarily preserved sequence motifs, hence apart from the conserved
regions; the UPMs tend to be located in loops and may be
correlated with different functions of members in a protein family.
RMA is proved to be useful for finding characteristic
sequence motifs in highly conservative members of one
protein family. The UPMs may have the potential to be
used as minivaccines for protecting animals from pathogenic infections. In general, the peptide-induced anti-peptide Ab must specifically recognize the desired infectious
pathogen, but not cross-react to others. The UPMs identified by RMA (Figure 5, labeled in blue) can be directly
compared with the antigenic regions predicted by PROTEAN (Figure 5, labeled as red star), such that the most
specific and antigenic peptide antigen may be allocated
(Table 1 and Table 2, labeled as #). In a large-scale analysis on mAbs with known epitopes on members of human
protein families, RMA demonstrated higher than 70%
accuracy in terms of correlating UPMs with epitopes of
mAbs (Figure 6). Recently, Ecale Zhou et al. developed
computational approaches employing a combination of
structure- and sequence-based alignments for identification of the antibody/protein binding pockets on the surface of ricin A chain [40]. Structure alignment software
and modified pocket-finding algorithm were required for

extracting the residue-residue correspondence as well as
for the determination of the conserved or unique binding
pocket in the target molecules. Unlike the aforementioned method, our RMA directly identified and merged
the non-gapped primary unique patterns; neither MSA
nor structural information was prerequisite prior to the
operation.

Conclusion
Taken together, we have developed a bioinformatic tool
to facilitate identification of UPMs located mostly in the
loops or on the surface in members of a protein family.
The structural features of some peptides are correlated
with molecular recognition including antigen-antibody,
protein-protein, protein-ligand and protein-cell interactions. Our method provides an effective and efficient evaluation of sequence, structural and functional studies that
allow biologists to examine their protein sequences of
interest prior to experiments such as peptide antigen
design and mutagenesis.

Methods
Development of a Reinforced Merging Algorithm
The aim of this study is to construct the deterministic
UPMs from a group of sequences among protein superfamilies by merging short primary unique patterns. Nongapped primary unique patterns are obtained from a set of
sequences and defined as possessing at least one symbol
different with respect to all possible segments in other
sequences. Bottom-up merging methodologies were
applied to analyze the primary unique patterns and construct the uniqueness features from local and neighboring

characteristics. There are three main modules designed in
the RMA system including Grouping, Searching, and
Merging modules. The system configuration and parameter settings in each module are depicted in Figure 7.
(A) Grouping module
The main purpose of the grouping module is to discriminate the tolerant features from UPM representation.
Because the possible substitutions in different amino
acids from observed frequencies in algorithms on related
proteins are well-defined [41,42], we provide a fundamental clustering algorithm that assembles 20 amino
acids into several independent groups. Users are able to
assign threshold parameters and referred scoring matrices.
A substitution matrix can be selected from standard BLOSUM/PAM matrices or new ones can be created based on
their own aligned block database. In this module, the traditional hierarchical methods are employed to cluster
groups based on the substitution matrix and threshold
values. Amino acids grouped in the same set are treated as
possessing similar characteristics and substituted by a
common symbol. For examples, if we select the
BLOSUM62 matrix and set the threshold parameter as 2,
the module provides the grouping results ((A), (R, K),
(N), (D, Q, E), (C), (G), (H, F, W, Y), (I, L, M, V), (P), (S),
(T)), where amino acids within the same cluster represent
matching states of identity. In addition, users are allowed
to specify the number of groups and the contents of
grouped amino acids based on different considerations.

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:38

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/38

(B) Searching module
In this module, we adopted the Boyer Moore matching
algorithm [43] to extract primary unique patterns to
reduce the time complexity. Primary unique patterns are
defined as the basic elements for merging operations.
Because each set of grouped amino acids are represented
by a unique symbol, the algorithm examines all candidate
patterns and extracts the positional information of primary unique patterns by scanning all substituted
sequences. If the clustering results are less than 20 groups
from the previous module, the tolerant feature of uniqueness will be discriminated and fewer primary unique patterns can be extracted from the family set. In addition to
adopting clustered results to describe the features of
uniqueness, this module also provides a statistical analysis to show the level of determined characteristics for each
extracted unique pattern. Users are able to assign the mismatch number, which represents the tolerant criteria for
primary unique patterns and should be less than the
length of a primary unique pattern. If there are N
sequences in a family set Z, and ZI is represented as the Ith
sequence in Z. The length of a primary unique pattern is n
and reserved m symbols for each pattern, i.e. allow (n-m)
mismatches from matching processes, then the representative level of uniqueness can be defined as the following
equation,

R

(

m
Pn

[ ZI , j ] )

C(n,m)

1

∑
C(n, m) k =1

m
Pn,k  ZI , j  − 1

N −1

(1)

where we define the set of all primary unique descriptors
with pattern length n in ZI by Pn [ZI,·]. Its jth primary
m
unique descriptor is denoted as Pn [ZI, j]. Pn,k [ZI, j] represents a set of collection from the jth unique pattern, which
allows (n-m) mismatched symbols for matching procm
esses, and Pn [ZI, j] is its kth tolerant pattern. The C(n, m)

is the total number of possible combinatorial patterns set
for reserved m symbols from a unique pattern with length
m
n, and Ό Pn [ZI, j]΍ ෈ [1, N] is the number of appearance of

the kth tolerant unique pattern shown in family set Z. It is
m
trivial that the value of Ό Pn [ZI, j]΍ is greater than or equal

to 1, since at least one sequence from set Z containing the
primary unique pattern Pn [ZI, j] must exist. If all the k tolm
erant unique patterns Pn [ZI, j] can be matched in each
m
sequence in Z, then Ό Pn [ZI, j]΍ = N for all k, and it follows
m
that R( Pn,k [ZI, j]) = 0%. This describes a special condition

in which each possible tolerant pattern of the primary
m
unique descriptor Pn,k [ZI, j] can be discovered in all other

sequences of Z. Therefore, its representative percentage of
primary uniqueness will be decreased to 0%. On the other
hand, if all of the combinatorial tolerant patterns from
m
Pn,k [Zi, j] cannot be found from other family sequences,
m
then Ό Pn [ZI, j]΍ = 1 for k ෈ [1, C(n, m)] and it follows that
m
by R( Pn,k [ZI, j]) = 100%. This describes another extreme

case in which the program provides all of the possible tolerant patterns for approximate matching, and the primary
m
unique pattern of Pn,k [ZI, j] still possesses 100% unique
representative percentage. These calculated quantitative
percentages represent the level of uniqueness and range
from 0% to 100%. All of the primary unique patterns with
different representative percentages will be sent to the
next module to perform merge operations based on their
neighbouring conditions and threshold settings for the
representative levels of uniqueness.

(C) Merging module
The merging operation is proposed to enhance the discrepancies in a family set and emphasize the neighboring
relationships instead of the traditional concatenation
operation. Two matched primary unique patterns in
sequence ZI can be merged if they possess overlapping
symbols in ZI and both are satisfied the criteria of the minimum representative percentage. Given any two segments
u1and u2 with length n1 and n2, the merged result is
denoted by w and constructed by
if 1 ≤ i ≤ n1 ;
 u (i)
w(i) =  1
u2 (i − n1 + l) if n1 + 1 ≤ i ≤ n1 + n2 − l.


(2)

where l is the number of overlapping symbols between u1
and u2, and l is strictly greater than 0. If u1 and u2 do not
contain any overlapping symbols between them, then the
merging operation will not be performed, and both will
retain their original relationship. It is obvious that if u1
and u2 are merged with respect to ZI, the length of the
merged segment w is strictly less than the concatenated
string uv. To reinforce the strength of uniqueness of the
merged patterns, a strict merging operation is also provided to make sure each subsegment of the merged pattern still possess unique properties. Assume two primary
unique patterns with same length n are merged. The strict
merging requirements are satisfied only when the lengths
of the overlapping symbols are equal to the primary pattern length minus one or the length of the merged segment is equal to n+1. Therefore, strictly merged unique
patterns are constructed using fundamental unique
descriptors and reserve the most unique characteristics in
sequences. After obtaining all candidate merged segments, the system provides a trimming function which

returns a substring from each merged segment with the
symbols stripped off the beginning and the end. This
function is achieved by evaluating the beginning and ending (n-1) symbols respectively from merged unique pattern set. The (n-1) symbols will be trimmed off when they
are matched with another merged unique. Through these
three designed modules, UPMs of each sequence from a
protein family set will be allocated efficiently. After reinforced processing, these merged UPMs satisfy the tolerance and representative level of uniqueness criteria. The
RMA is available free of charge for academic use [44,45]
and a supplementary document for guidelines and examples of the RMA system is also provided [46].
Analyses of protein sequences by RMA and localization of
the identified UPMs
The protein sequences could be selected according to the
following criteria: (1) If the protein of interest belongs to
a protein family classified by the sequence similarity, each
member of this protein family is selected from GenBank
and saved as FASTA format. (2) If the protein of interest
does not belong to any protein family, its sequence
should be compared with other protein sequences in the
database by BLASTp software or others and all the
sequences with more than 20% identity should be
selected and saved as FASTA format.

In this paper, the protein sequences of human RNaseA,
EGFR, MMP, and Smad families (Table 3) were saved in
FASTA format and entered into the RMA for analysis. The
length of the lower bound, upper bound and primary
unique pattern were all set as 3. After the searching and
merging processes, the merged UPMs with length greater
than 8 were identified. The unique regions, trimmed residues, and conserved regions were labeled in blue, orange,
and black, respectively. The positions of all UPMs identified by RMA were localized and colour-coded in the
resolved 3-D structures of each query sequence employing
WebLab ViewerPro 4.0 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). For
cross species analysis, RNaseAs from Bos Taurus (B. Taurus) and Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), and MsbAs, one of the
largest superfamilies of proteins characterized by a highly
conserved adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette
(ABC), from Escherichia coli (E. coli), Vibro cholera (V. chol-

era), Gloeobacter violaceus (G. violaceus), Shewanella oneidensis (S. oneidensis), and Bradyrhizobium japonicum (B.
japonicum) (Table 4) were analyzed by the same processes.
Protein expression and generation of mAb
The recombinant clones were transformed into E. coli
BL21 (DE3) and expressed in the presence of 0.5 mM
IPTG. After homogenization, the RNase3 was purified by
His-Bind® metal chelating chromatography under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The generation of mAb was carried out as
described [47]. Hybridomas producing anti-RNase3 mAb
were obtained by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay screening with purified recombinant RNase3 as the
antigen. The mAb was purified from the hybridoma
supernatant using the Montage® Antibody Purification Kit
(Millipore).
Western blotting
After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a
polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Pall). After blocking,
hybridizing with the first Ab, washing, and probing with
the secondary Ab, the target proteins were visualized using
the SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) or 3,3'-Diaminobezidine tetrahydrochloride (Amersco).
Analysis of protein sequences by PROTEAN
Each protein sequence was saved in PROTEIN format
using EditSeq in DNAStar and executed by PROTEAN
[11]. The sequential sequences were selected as the antigenic index higher than 0.5 and compared with the UPMs
identified by RMA. Between potential antigenic regions
and UPMs, the coverage greater than 70% was labeled in
Table 1 and 2.
Large-scale RMA analysis
To analyze the performance of RMA in large-scale, the
input sequences were selected by the following steps. First,
all information related to mAbs in website of Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. was retrieved [24] and the mAbs containing descriptions about the exact recognition sites
(epitopes) were selected. Then the corresponding antigen
sequences belonging to human protein families were collected from GenBank and saved as FASTA format. Each

family protein sequence set with pairwise identity higher
than 20% was individually analyzed by RMA with default
parameters as previously described.
