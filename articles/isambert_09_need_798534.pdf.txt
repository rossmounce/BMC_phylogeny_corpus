Abstract
Background: While eukaryotes primarily evolve by duplication-divergence expansion (and
reduction) of their own gene repertoire with only rare horizontal gene transfers, prokaryotes
appear to evolve under both gene duplications and widespread horizontal gene transfers over long
evolutionary time scales. But, the evolutionary origin of this striking difference in the importance
of horizontal gene transfers remains by and large a mystery.
Hypothesis: We propose that the abundance of horizontal gene transfers in free-living
prokaryotes is a simple but necessary consequence of two opposite effects: i) their apparent
genome size constraint compared to typical eukaryote genomes and ii) their underlying genome
expansion dynamics through gene duplication-divergence evolution, as demonstrated by the
presence of many tandem and block repeated genes. In principle, this combination of genome size
constraint and underlying duplication expansion should lead to a coalescent-like process with
extensive turnover of functional genes. This would, however, imply the unlikely, systematic
reinvention of functions from discarded genes within independent phylogenetic lineages. Instead,
we propose that the long-term evolutionary adaptation of free-living prokaryotes must have
resulted in the emergence of efficient non-phylogenetic pathways to circumvent gene loss.
Implications: This need for widespread horizontal gene transfers due to genome size constraint
implies, in particular, that prokaryotes must remain under strong selection pressure in order to
maintain the long-term evolutionary adaptation of their "mutualized" gene pool, beyond the
inevitable turnover of individual prokaryote species. By contrast, the absence of genome size
constraint for typical eukaryotes has presumably relaxed their need for widespread horizontal gene
transfers and strong selection pressure. Yet, the resulting loss of genetic functions, due to weak
selection pressure and inefficient gene recovery mechanisms, must have ultimately favored the
emergence of more complex life styles and ecological integration of many eukaryotes.

Background
With nearly 1,000 fully sequenced genomes, to date, and
many more at a draft stage, comparative genomics has
already highlighted major differences in the evolution of
prokaryote and eukaryote genomes. In particular, a long
and to some extent still ongoing debate [1-3] has helped
delineate some quantitative differences in the amount of
horizontal gene transfer across typical prokaryote and
eukaryote genomes.
While interesting examples of horizontal gene transfers
have been reported for a number of eukaryotes [4], these
individually transferred genes of non-organelle origin
amount to at most a few percent of the total number of
genes in typical eukaryotic genomes (from virtually none
in human [5] and <1% in rotifera [6] genomes up to 4%
in ciliates from the rumen gut rich in bacteria-protist interactions [7]). Hence, following their likely arising from
early symbiotic fusion between ancient archaebacteria
and -proteobacteria (with subsequent engulfment of
cyanobacteria leading to plastids in plants) [8], eukaryotes appear to have, since then, primarily evolved by expansion (and reduction) of their ancestral gene repertoires
through vertical inheritance of gene duplication-divergence events.
By contrast, prokaryotes rely on a seemingly more flexible
evolutionary dynamics allowing for both rampant horizontal gene transfers between closely related species, as
well as less frequent but evolutionary important gene
transfers between phylogenetically distant species [9],
such as between archaea and eubacteria [10-12]. All in all,
it appears that only a small fraction of prokaryote genes
are actually consistent with a universal phylogenetic tree a
life [13], thereby suggesting that most prokaryote genes
are eventually exchanged over long evolutionary time
scales [1].
Yet, the evolutionary origin of these striking abundance of
horizontal gene transfers in free-living prokaryotes
remains by and large a mystery.
From a functional perspective, there is no doubt that some
horizontally transferred genes do provide evolutionary
benefit to their recipient host [14]. However, many transferred genes between prokaryotes appear to be evolutionary neutral or even deleterious as judged from their rapid
turnover dynamics in typical prokaryote genomes [1517]. So what is the evolutionary incentive for free-living
prokaryotes to exchange many genes? Do they simply do
it "because they can", having no separation of germline
and soma, and possessing specific pumps for DNA intake,
essentially, as food not "for the purpose" of gene transfer?
(see E.V. Koonin's review below).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/28

In this paper, we will argue that prokaryotes experience an
abundance of gene transfers, not just because they can,
but because they have to, owing to an inherent evolutionary constraint, specific to prokaryotes and absent for
eukaryotes.

Presentation of the hypothesis
We propose that the abundance of horizontal gene transfers in free-living prokaryotes is a simple but necessary
consequence of two opposite effects: i) their apparent
genome size constraint (Fig. 1) and ii) the underlying
expansion dynamics of their genome through gene duplication-divergence evolution [18,19] (as well as amplification of short mobile elements in many free-living
prokaryote genomes [19-21]).
In essence, the rationale of the proposed hypothesis is
reminiscent of the situation of a population of organisms
reproducing under global population size constraint. This
is well known to lead to the inevitable turnover of genotypes in the population, if only through neutral drift. Yet,
in the case of prokaryote genes under duplication-divergence evolution and genome size constraint, we will argue
that the outcome should be quite different and lead to the
evolutionary need for widespread horizontal gene transfers between prokaryotes, in place of an independent
turnover of genes within different prokaryote genomes (as
could be expected from a complete analogy with the
results from population genetics).
Indeed, for population-level dynamics, the turnover of
genotypes arises as population size constraints prevent the
accumulation of individual organisms under limited
amounts of space and/or food. Similarly, at the level of
entire ecosystems, there is not enough space nor resources
in a given environment to accommodate both newly arising species and all ancient species, which leads to an inevitable turnover of species, as long as the underlying
speciation dynamics from extant species continues.
But is there a similar evolutionary restriction on the duplication-divergence expansion of gene repertoires due to an
inherent genome size constraint for free-living organisms?
For eukaryotes, there is no indication that such a size constraint has yet been reached for typical genomes, which
can reach vastly different sizes spanning more than
10,000 folds in length for free-living protists only, Fig. 1.
So, there is no need to replace old genes by new ones due
to size limitation in typical eukaryote genomes, which
generally accommodate a large fraction of "junk" DNA
relics as well.
By contrast, the genomes of free-living prokaryotes appear
to be limited to a 10-fold variation in size, from about 1.3

Genome size (bp)

Figure 1
Genome size restriction of free-living prokaryotes
Genome size restriction of free-living prokaryotes. The genomes of free-living prokaryotes (archaea and eubacteria, in
red) appear to be restricted to a mere 10-fold range in size from 1.3 Mbp to 13 Mbp, while the sizes of free-living eukaryote
genomes (in black) span almost 105 folds from 10 Mbp to near 106 Mbp. The lower ranges of obligate parasite or symbiont
genomes, shown as light pink and grey bars, can be much smaller than free-living prokaryote and eukaryote genomes, respectively, due to the progressive loss of dispensable genes. Viruses and gene-free viroids (in light blue) further reduce the size of
parasitic "genomes" down to a few hundred nucleotides only.

Mbp to 13 Mbp (Fig. 1), with proportionally very limited
space for retaining non-functional DNA (i.e. a few percent
of their genome at most), especially in free-living prokaryotes with large genomes (>7 Mbp) [19,20].
Note, moreover, that the compactness of prokaryotic
genomes is not the cause of their narrow range of genome
sizes. Indeed, obligate parasites and symbionts, which
also typically present compact "genomes", can span a
much wider range of genome sizes with essentially no
lower limit in gene content for the extreme parasitic lifestyles of many viruses and viroids.
So, what is the origin of the narrow range of genome sizes
for free-living prokaryotes? While the lower limit of about
1 Mbp likely corresponds to a putative minimal genome
for free-living lifestyle, the origin of the upper genome
limit of about 10 Mbp (Fig. 1) is more speculative at this
stage.
Although selection pressure for genome streamlining [22]
might be an important evolutionary drive for some freeliving prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes with large popu-

lation sizes (as for the abundant maritime bacteria, Pelagibacter ubique [23] or green algeae, Ostreococcus tauri [24]),
it does not appear to be a general trend amongst free-living prokaryotes [20], which even show a significant anticorrelation between genome size and selection pressure
[3].
This suggests that the apparent genome size restriction of
free-living prokaryotes, Fig. 1, is not caused by an adaptive
streamlining of their genomes but may, instead, result
from an inherent evolutionary constraint acting to limit
their genome expansion. Such a genome size restriction
could, for instance, stem from a tight constraint on the
surface to volume ratio of free-living prokaryotes, due to
their need to directly extract energy and food from their
surrounding environment. By contrast, eukaryotes have
specialized intracellular organelles to fulfill these tasks,
such as mitochondria and plastids, whose number can be
scaled in proportion to the intracellular needs of eukaryotic cells [25]. Note, in particular, that the observed 10-fold
restriction in genome size (L) of free-living prokaryotes
(Fig. 1) actually corresponds to a tighter 2-fold limitation
on their surface to volume ratio S/V ~ L-1/3 (assuming L ~

V ~ S3/2). But the apparent genome size restriction might
possibly stem from other evolutionary constraints of freeliving prokaryotes, such as a cell size limit for efficient
intra-cellular diffusion of metabolites and proteins.
Alternatively, genome size constraints might also result
from a more operational limitation of prokaryote functional regulation, with a possible "bureaucracy ceiling"
[3,26] or "microeconomic" optimisation principles [27]
that have been proposed for prokaryote regulatory systems. Yet, considering the virtually unlimited possibility
and complexity of regulatory systems, such operational
limitations seem more likely to be themselves the result of
built-in physical constraints or elementary principles of
evolution than to be the primary force behind tight
genome size restriction of free-living prokaryotes (see,
Testing of the hypothesis).
It remains that, whatever the actual origin of such genome
size constraint, it should oppose the evolutionary expansion of prokaryote genomes. Yet, direct evidences of gene
duplication-divergence dynamics and genome expansion
are provided by the significant proportion of tandem or
block repeated genes (e.g. 1525%) [18,19] and the presence of short mobile elements (e.g. 5%) [19-21], in particular for medium sized genomes (37 Mbp), whereas the
proportion of short mobile elements is typically somewhat smaller (e.g. < 12%) in large prokaryote genomes
(>7 Mbp) [19,20]. This is consistent with the underlying
notion of an increasing "gene pressure" as prokaryote
genomes get closer to an effective upper size limit.
In principle, pervasive gene duplication dynamics should
then lead to a continuous turnover of genes in different
free-living prokaryote species, by analogy with the wellknown coalescent process from population genetics, as
outlined above. However, long-term evolutionary adaptation of living organisms could not rely on such a continual reinvention of functions from discarded genes, as it
would essentially consist in achieving adaptation through
systematic gene displacement, without the possibility to
learn from previous successful evolutionary pathways
[28,29]. Instead, the long-term evolutionary adaptation of
living organisms is well known to mainly rely on tinkering
with the long evolved functions of extant genes and their
regulations. Hence, by precluding long-term phylogenetic
inheritance of functional genes within independent
prokaryote lineages, genome size constraints must have
favored the necessary emergence of alternative ways to
recover lost genes from other prokaryote genomes or possibly other genetic reservoirs, such as bacteriophage
viruses. In other words, genes that are non-essential in a
given environment and, hence, likely to be lost under
genome size constraint, must be recoverable from other
free-living or parasitic species to avoid an otherwise irre-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/28

versible decline in gene content and thereby adaptive
potential of all prokaryote lineages. Instead, widespread
use of horizontal gene transfer results in the long-term
evolutionary adaptation of a "mutualized" gene pool [3],
that is maintained and diversified through and beyond
the turnover of individual prokaryote species.

Testing of the hypothesis
The proposed hypothesis, linking genome size constraint
and gene duplication-divergence dynamics to widespread
horizontal transfers in free-living prokaryotes, is broadly
supported by the comparative genomic analysis highlighted above.
Ideally, this hypothesis might also be directly testable
experimentally, using genome engineering approaches
[30], although designing and interpreting an experiment
to probe the evolution of the size constraint of a bacterial
genome might not be an easy task.
Alternatively, it would also be interesting to test, on theoretical grounds, whether the interplay between genome
size constraints and gene duplication-divergence evolution could account for other seemingly unrelated features
of free-living prokaryotes.
In particular, the opposite effects of gene duplicationdivergence evolution and genome size constraint, leading
to widespread horizontal gene transfers, are unlikely to
apply uniformly over the whole collection of prokaryote
genes, which perform a wide range of distinct cellular
functions. This is indeed consistent with the available data
showing that prokaryote genes are subjected to different
rates of horizontal gene transfer, reflecting at least in part
their different cellular functions [31]. Yet, most genes do
appear to be eventually transferred between prokaryote
species, over long evolutionary time scales, except for a
central core of possibly a few hundred vertically inherited
genes [1,9].
So, the same genome size constraint likely leads to different rates of horizontal gene transfer for different types of
genes. This should in turn affects their relative abundances and possible interactions in functional biological
networks involving different gene types, such as transcription networks or signal transduction networks [32]. In
fact, such oriented networks, between regulators and target genes or between enzymes and substrate genes, are
known to exhibit gene type-specific expansions depending on the actual size of their genome [26]. These oriented
networks also present distinct global topologies in
prokaryotes and eukaryotes [32-34].
Besides, the fact that inherent evolutionary constraints
can have farranging implications on the emerging proper-

ties of biological systems is not new. In particular, population size (N) constraints have long been known to
restrict the effective range of adaptive selection to high fitness gains, s > 1/N, while favoring random evolutionary
drift in place of lower fitness gains, s < 1/N. But, beyond
population-level constraints, there are also inherent evolutionary constraints at the level of individual genomes,
which ultimately restrict, by construction, the possible
evolution of living organisms.

prokaryote species, requires that free-living prokaryotes
remain under strong selection pressure. Indeed, widespread random horizontal gene transfers under weak
selection pressure could only be deleterious, in the end,
for the gene pool and its prokaryote hosts. Hence, on long
evolutionary time scales, only genes that provide some
sort of advantage to their prokaryote hosts in specific environments are expected to be preserved in the mutualized
gene pool.

For instance, we have demonstrated [28,29] that, in
absence of genome size constraint (which presumably
applies to typical eukaryote genomes, see below), duplication-divergence processes already entail by themselves
strong restrictions on the emerging molecular organization of cellular functions. In particular, duplication-divergence evolution directly restricts, by construction, the
emerging structure of conserved biomolecular networks
to scale-free topologies, irrespective of any biological
function [28].

Conversely, by freeing themselves from genome size constraints, typical eukaryotes can actually conserve long
evolved genes in their own genome under much weaker
selection pressure and smaller population sizes than
prokaryotes. This sets the stage for a radically different
exploration of the genotype-phenotype space of eukaryotes [36], as compared to the adaptation-driven selection of
prokaryotes and their "mutualized" gene pool.

Concerning more directly the topology of prokaryote
molecular networks, Maslov et al. [35] have recently proposed an interesting "toolbox model" accounting for the
topology and evolution of their metabolic networks. It
assumes that one transcription factor and a minimal
number of metabolic enzymes are transferred on-demand
when needed from a "home depot" of metabolic genes
(see S. Maslov's review below).
These examples illustrate how the topologies of biological
networks might indeed be related to simple and seemingly unrelated evolutionary processes such as elementary
duplication-divergence processes [28,29] or on-demand
horizontal gene transfers [35].
Similarly, we expect that the evolutionary consequences
of genome size constraint on free-living prokaryotes (Fig.
1) are bound to extend from the mere restrictions on
genome evolution, such as the need for widespread horizontal gene transfer discussed here, to more integrated
operational constraints at the level of cellular functions
and regulations.

Implications of the hypothesis
The main implication of this need for widespread horizontal gene transfers under genome size constraint is the
emergence of a "mutualized" gene pool, as outlined
above. Indeed, by "mutualizing" a pool of exchangeable
genes, widespread use of horizontal gene transfers circumvents the otherwise inevitable loss of many genes in each
prokaryote lineages.
Yet, the long-term evolutionary adaptation of such a
mutualized gene pool, beyond the inevitable turnover of

Indeed, from a global evolutionary perspective, different
eukaryote lineages appear to be exploring, in "parallel",
various combinatorial expressions of conserved genes,
evolving under near neutral genomic duplication-divergence dynamics and random speciation events [28,36]. As
a result, most of these eukaryote lineages are likely to die
out on the way, in agreement with the typical eukaryote
species life span of about 1 to 10 million years only. Yet,
we expect that non-adaptive evolution of eukaryotes can
be globally sustained as long as successful lineages, escaping background extinction and occasional mass extinction
events, continue to provide enough eukaryote diversity
through further speciation events.
But how such parallel evolutionary dynamics from conserved genes can lead to the great diversity of known
eukaryotes under weak selection pressure?
On short evolutionary time scales, the diversity of eukaryotes is thought to be driven by independent changes in
gene regulation and occasional expansions of gene families. This presumably underlies the striking ability of
higher eukaryotes to "adapt", apparently by chance, to
diverse natural environments when the opportunity
arises. It is illustrated, for instance, by the three independent returns to aquatic life of pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians, some 30 to 50 MY ago, from three different lineages
of terrestrial mammals under possible change in feeding
ecology [37]. Similarly, the return of traits lost in distant
ancestors is supported by an increasing number of reports
suggesting that stick insects can regain wings, lizards can
regain digits, slipper limpets can regain a coiled shell,
asexual mites can regain sex, frogs can regain tadpoles in
their life histories and marine snails can regain a feeding
larval stage (see [38] for review). This ability of eukaryotes
to maintain the potential to produce traits lost in distant

Biology Direct 2009, 4:28

ancestors typically results from cis-regulatory changes in
the control of genes [39] that have always remained functional, but in other genomic contexts, e.g. different development stages or differentiated tissue types. By contrast,
the resurrection of pseudogenes remains seemingly exceptional, due to the accumulation of errors in sequence coding regions beyond 510 MY [38], although a few examples
have recently been reported [40] (see P. Pontarotti's
review below).
But, beyond changes in gene regulation and occasional
resurrection of pseudogenes, the actual functions of
orthologous genes can also diverge, and will eventually do
so, across phylogenetic distant lineages. This is due to the
inevitable turnover of interaction partners of orthologous
genes under duplication-divergence dynamics over long
evolutionary time scales (e.g. > 100200 MY), as demonstrated in [28], Fig. 5.
Finally, on even longer evolutionary time scales (e.g. >500
MY), weak selection pressure, population bottlenecks and
inefficient horizontal gene transfers inevitably lead to the
accidental loss of temporarily dispensable genes as, for
instance, from rarely used metabolic pathways. This has
presumably contributed to the emergence of more complex life styles and ecological integration for many eukaryotes, which must ultimately rely on external sources for
essential metabolite intermediates, such as certain amino
acids, they can no longer produce themselves.
In summary, the need for widespread horizontal gene
transfers, due to size restriction of prokaryote genomes,
has likely favored the emergence and progressive adaptation of a mutualized gene pool with increasingly elaborate
functions, in spite of the inevitable turnover of individual
prokaryote species. By contrast, the absence of genome
size constraint for typical eukaryotes has relaxed the need
for widespread horizontal gene transfers and strong selection pressure, which presumably governed the evolution
of their pre-symbiosis prokaryote ancestors. But the inevitable loss of genetic functions, under weak selection pressure and inefficient gene recovery mechanisms, must have
favored the emergence and ultimate success of more complex life styles and ecological integration of many eukaryotes.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1: Dr Pierre Pontarotti, Evolution Génome

The authors propose that the genome size constraint and
the genome evolution process of archea* and bacteria*
(gene duplication: divergence) lead to gene function loss
and that these losses need to be compensated by genes
arising from other species. A process called Horizontal
Gene Transfer (HGT).
In the case of eukaryotes, the genome size does not seem
to be a problem; therefore the genes that are not used can
be conserved during a long time period and could still be
re-used after a while. If this time is too long then, the
genes will be lost but gene function resurrection (or back/
reverse cooption) could occur.
Comments:
1) To strengthen their hypothesis, the authors need to give
some examples of resurrected gene function in eukaryotes.
Authors' response
A recently reported example of resurrected gene in eukaryotes is
an immunity-related GTPase (IRG) gene in humans, IRGM,
which was shown [40]to have resurrected about 20 MY ago in
all human and great ape lineages after staying dormant as
pseudogenes for about 2530 MY. But such resurrections of
pseudogenes remain seemingly exceptional beyond 510 MY,
due to the accumulation of errors in sequence coding regions
[38].
By contrast, the return of traits lost in distant ancestors, which
is supported by an increasing number of reports (see [38]for
review), does not typically involve the resurrection of pseudogenes. Instead, it usually corresponds to cis-regulatory changes
in the control of genes [39]that have always remained functional, but in other genomic contexts, e.g. different development stages or differentiated tissue types. This is an important
point, which we have now underlined more clearly.
2) At the end of the paper, the authors give an example of
style life returns, several other examples are found on
character return that seem to me more appropriate. Clear
example of reverse evolution for a given character could
be found in the following references:

occurred and do they found an inverse correlation
between the level of HGT and the genome size (or with

Authors' response
We have not looked at eukaryotic phyla with HGT in details,
but the evidences of HGT that have been reported for eukaryotes
seem more directly related to their promiscuous life style with
bacteria in bacteria-rich environments and/or the relative
accessibility of their germline to HGT.

community genome, and HGT is the best and obvious
candidate. I think theoretical work that shows the possibility of long-time persistence of genes acquired via HGT,
even in the absence of measurable selective advantage is
relevant here:
Novozhilov et al. Mathematical modeling of evolution of
horizontally transferred genes. MBE 2005; 22: 17211732
Moreover, I suspect that the hypothesis discussed in this
paper in itself provides for fairly straightforward mathematical modeling perhaps, not for this paper but I think
it would be interesting to do.
Authors' response
We thank Dr Eugene V Koonin for his insightful expertise and
for pointing out Novozhilov et al.'s paper [15]to us. We agree
that the hypothesis we propose provides in itself for fairly
straightforward mathematical modeling. Yet, our main intent
in this "hypothesis" paper is precisely to put the emphasis on the
premises of the argument (i.e. genome size constraints and
duplication-divergence evolution) rather than on a specific
mathematical model illustrating the resulting need for widespread HGT.

We have in fact significantly simplified the discussion related
to refs [28,29], which could not be exposed in sufficient details
in the format of an hypothesis paper.

This being said, I am not sure that I find the section on
"testing of the hypothesis" particularly illuminating or
even genuinely relevant. The connection between network
topology and HGT escapes me. At the very least, it would
be helpful to explain this in more explicit terms. I also find
the section on implications of the hypothesis rather vague
and do not believe that the excursion into the raisond' etre
of eukaryotes is particularly helpful. A more careful and
concrete discussion of the evolution of prokaryotes themselves would do more for the exposition of the authors'
hypothesis.

Reviewer 2: Dr Eugene V Koonin, National Center for
Biotechnology Information, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland,
United States.

We have clarified the sections about "testing" and "implication" of the hypothesis. Ideally, hypothesis should be directly
tested by experiments, yet designing dedicated experiments on
genome evolution is typically not an easy task. Alternatively,
one can either look for counter-examples, which would invalidate the hypothesis, or demonstrate that the proposal carries in
fact further, less direct consequences, that are also consistent
with additional empirical data. This is the sort of "tests", we
would like bring forward in further follow up studies. While the
connection between network topology and HGT might not seem
so direct at first sight, it is nonetheless expected, we believe,
insofar as HGT do affect the gene repertoire and hence the
molecular interactions within biological networks. This is well
illustrated for example in the "Toolbox model of evolution of
prokaryotic metabolic networks and their regulation" by Maslov
et al. [35], see below.

4) Minor comments The part of the article: testing of the
hypothesis should be re-written as it is very hard to follow
(even if we read the previous article published by the
authors. Please consider revision of this section to clarify.
Authors' response

This is an interesting Hypothesis paper that interprets the
pervasive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in prokaryotes
as a "simple but necessary consequence" of their apparent
genome size constraints and the "underlying expansion
dynamics of their genome through gene duplicationdivergence evolution". In itself, this is a straightforward,
sound, and yet, interesting idea. To my knowledge, this
point has never been explicitly discussed before which I
find surprising. Indeed, if there is a tight size constraint,
and at the same time, a characteristic rate of gene duplication, there also should be some force to maintain and
restore functional diversity, especially, in the context of a

My further misgivings about this and similar papers are
not even criticisms but more philosophical musings about
the status of "Why?" questions in biology. This paper tries
to address that very sort of question: why so much HGT
among prokaryotes? Answers can be given at a number of
different levels, and Isambert and Stein offer one of them,
a very interesting one, rooted in constraints and features
of genome evolution. But one can also easily argue that
prokaryotes, basically, do it so often because they can,
having no separation of germline and soma, and possessing specific pumps for DNA intake, essentially, as food
not "for the purpose" of HGT.
Authors' response
The fact that prokaryotes have no separation of germline and
soma and possess specific pumps for DNA intake likely facilitates the horizontal transfer of genes in their genomes. Yet,
many unicellular eukaryotes, without separation of germline
and soma and also commonly exposed to foreign DNA (e.g.
through feeding on bacteria), happen to experience much less
HGT (<1%) than typical prokaryotes. Hence, the absence of
germline and soma separation together with regular uptake of
exogenous DNA are not sufficient conditions to account for
widespread HGT nor are they, in fact, necessary conditions, as
ciliates from the rumen gut appear to have experienced a relative abundance of HGT [7](about 4% of their genes), despite
their separate germline micronucleus and somatic macronucleus.

tionary biology. Along these lines, the paper is not really
a Hypothesis, at least, not in the strict Popperian sense,
but rather a viewpoint. This somewhat skeptical position
that I take does not render the paper uninteresting or useless.
Authors' response
We believe that we present a genuine hypothesis which does not
concern the existence of any primitive form of life but merely the
consequence of the apparent genome size constraint and underlying duplication-divergence evolution of free-living prokaryotes, as we know them. In particular, we would like to stress that
the abundance of HGT cannot in itself restrain the size of
prokaryote genomes (nor does it imply duplication-divergence
evolution of their genomes). So, deriving the abundance of
HGT among free-living prokaryotes from their apparent
genome size constraint and underlying duplication-divergence
evolution is not a circular argument. It is, we believe, a genuine
hypothesis, which could in principle be falsified. As pointed out
in the paper, this would involve to find a free-living prokaryote
lineage having achieved long-term adaptation through systematic gene displacements rather than gene transfers. Although at
odd with known evolutionary trends, one cannot exclude a priori the existence of such isolated free-living prokaryotes, which
would need to continually reinvent the functions of discarded
genes without long-term memory of previous evolutionary successes.
Minor comment:

As for the status of "why?" questions in biology, we entertain
the idea that it should be exactly the same as in any other scientific field. Hence, the premise is that many observations on
biological systems are not independent from one another and
may in fact be "explained", that is, logically related to one
another, if only at a statistical level. While we agree that
"answers can be given at a number of different levels", it is also
clear that different answers might not provide the same level of
"understanding". For instance, it can be argued that the proposition that "prokaryotes experience an abundance of HGT
because they have to" is a "stronger" (that is, more constrained)
hypothesis than "prokaryotes, basically, do [HGT] so often
because they can", which should also apply, in principle, to unicellular eukaryotes without separation of germline and soma
and commonly exposed to foreign DNA, as discussed above.
More broadly, one could argue that HGT, or put another
way, mixing and matching of genetic elements is the primary mode of life existence that does not call for an explanation (this is, in a slightly caricatured form, the view
propounded in ref. [3]) whereas everything that deviates
from that modality, certainly, eukaryotes, but to some
extent, any cellular life forms, needs to be explained. This
is not so much criticism of the present paper but rather a
series of general thoughts on the epistemology of evolu-

p. 3, left: I suggest not lumping viruses and viroids with
prokaryotes when considering genome size constraints. I
would limit this discussion to cellular life forms in which
case a lower limit does seem to exist, although the discovery of tiny endosymbionts like Carsonella pushes this
limit surprisingly low.
Authors' response
We have cut this paragraph in two to avoid any confusion.
Reviewer 3: Dr Sergei Maslov, Brookhaven National
Laboratory, Upton, NY, United States.
The manuscript contains a speculative argument that
widespread horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes is an
adaptation allowing them to preserve long-term evolutionary memory that would otherwise have been quickly
erased by rapid gene turnover.
This view goes along with my recent "Home Depot"
model of prokaryotic evolution (S. Maslov, S. Krishna, T.
Y. Pang, and K. Sneppen, "Toolbox model of evolution of
prokaryotic metabolic networks and their regulation", in

press (2009)). In our model prokaryotic genomes are constantly replenished from a common repository with entire
metabolic pathways. This process can be compared to
constantly buying tools in a hardware store (hence the
"Home Depot" metaphor) only to return them once the
project is over.
Authors' response
We thank Dr Sergei Maslov for mentioning to us this interesting paper on the "Toolbox model of evolution of prokaryotic
metabolic networks and their regulation" [35]. In particular,
we would like to point out that, beyond the pivotal role of HGT
(which we argue must be widespread under genome size constraint), the premise of the "toolbox model" also appears to rely
on an additional finite size constraint of prokaryote evolution,
namely, the apparent finite size of their available metabolic
universe, Nuniv. Based on current KEGG data, Maslov et al.
postulate that there are about Nuniv = 1,800 metabolic compounds that can be metabolized by specific enzymes, which
prokaryotes can alternatively acquire or discard through HGT.
Then, the toolbox model predicts that the number of new metabolic enzymes that can be acquired and controlled by a single
new transcription factor eventually decreases as the size of their
metabolic network Nmet approaches Nuniv. Hence, it follows
that the interplay between duplication-divergence evolutionary
dynamics of prokaryotes under genome size constraints and the
finite size of their available metabolic environment might ultimately control not only their requirement for widespread HGT
but also the global topology of their metabolic networks.
From my standpoint, this manuscript would greatly benefit if authors would accompany their verbal argument
with a quantitative model. The model does not have to be
realistic it just needs to clearly make the main point of the
argument that prokaryotic world would collapse without
some sort of gene exchange with a mutualized gene pool.
Do authors expect a sharp error-catastrophe-like phase
transition *in the absence* of horizontal gene transfer?
What numerical constant is best suited to quantify this
transition (akin to the number of mutations per genome
per generation for error catastrophe)? What is its (approximate) range in prokaryotes? In the section "Testing the
hypothesis" authors repeatedly refer to their earlier work
(Ref. [27]) without adequately explaining even the basic
ingredients of this earlier model. This section needs to be
significantly expanded in the revised version of the manuscript.

sented and further analyzed within the intended format of an
hypothesis paper.
Similarly, we agree that a simple "error-catastrophe-like model"
could be worked out in the case of gene-type independent
genomes, but such an homogenous gene-type model could
hardly been seen as realistic, as pointed out by S. Maslov. Genetype dependent HGT should undoubtedly be taken into account
as discussed in the section on "Testing the hypothesis".
Again, our main intent in this "hypothesis" paper is to put the
emphasis on the premises of the argument (i.e. genome size
constraints and duplication-divergence evolution) rather than
on a specific mathematical model illustrating the resulting need
for widespread HGT.

After considering to significantly expand the section on "Testing
