Abstract
Background: Understanding the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in response to environmental
challenges is of fundamental importance in biology. Transcription factors associated to response elements
and the chromatin structure had proven to play important roles in gene expression regulation. We have
analyzed promoter regions of dipteran genes induced in response to immune challenge, in search for
particular sequence patterns involved in their transcriptional regulation.
Results: 5' upstream regions of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae immunity-induced genes and their
corresponding orthologous genes in 11 non-melanogaster drosophilid species and Ae. aegypti share
enrichment in AT-rich short motifs. AT-rich motifs are associated with nucleosome formation as
predicted by two different algorithms. In A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, many immunity genes 5' upstream
sequences also showed NFκB response elements, located within 500 bp from the transcription start site.
In A. gambiae, the frequency of ATAA motif near the NFκB response elements was increased, suggesting
a functional link between nucleosome formation/remodelling and NFκB regulation of transcription.
Conclusion: AT-rich motif enrichment in 5' upstream sequences in A. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and the
Drosophila genus immunity genes suggests a particular pattern of nucleosome formation/chromatin
organization. The co-occurrence of such motifs with the NFκB response elements suggests that these
sequence signatures may be functionally involved in transcriptional activation during dipteran immune
response. AT-rich motif enrichment in regulatory regions in this group of co-regulated genes could
represent an evolutionary constrained signature in dipterans and perhaps other distantly species.

Background
Organismal complexity is dependent on the network that
regulates gene expression, rather than the number of
genes in its genome [1-3]. Thus, one of the biggest challenges in postgenomic research is understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling location, timing and
intensity of gene expression.
Organisms are permanently sensing changes in their environment. Environmental agents activate cellular signaling
pathways that lead to a rapid expression of specific genes
to respond to changes. These pathways transmit their signal to specific transcription factors (TFs) which gain access
to response elements (REs) located in promoter and
enhancer regions of the corresponding gene [2] resulting
in transcriptional activation. In eukaryotes these proteinDNA interactions occur in the context of a chromatin template within the cell nucleus. The fundamental unit of
chromatin is the nucleosome, composed by a segment of
146 base pairs of double stranded DNA wrapped around
a core of histone proteins [4]. Initially, nucleosomes were
regarded as structures required for the packing of long
DNA molecules into the cellular nucleus [5], but it is now
clear that chromatin structure plays a central role in the
regulation of gene expression [6-9]. At least three mechanisms have been proposed for the active role of chromatin
in transcriptional regulation. First, by preventing TF binding to its cognate RE as revealed by the pioneering studies
in the expression of PHO5 gene in response to phosphate
starvation [10]. Secondly, wrapping DNA in nucleosomes
may promote transcription by allowing closely adjacent
RE access to their cognate TF [11,12]. Third, nucleosomes
may approximate distant regulatory elements, as it occurs
in the alcohol-dehydrogenase (Adh) promoter region of
Drosophila [13].
Nucleosomes are located in preferred positions with
respect to DNA sequence [14-21]. It has been shown that
on a statistical level, groups of experimentally obtained
nucleosomal sequences display periodicity in the occurrence of dinucleotides such as GG, TA, TG, and TT
[14,15,20] or trinucleotides such as VWG ([G/C/A] [A/
T]G) [19]. This periodicity tends to occur approximately
every 10 bp, coinciding with one turn of the DNA chain
and confers better bending properties required for wrapping DNA around the histone core. However, this periodicity is difficult to identify on individual nucleosomal
sequences due to a low signal/noise ratio. The non-random distribution of nucleosomes suggests that some DNA
sequences are more likely to form stable nucleosomes,
and therefore nucleosome forming sequences could be
predicted using computational methods based on the
sequence features identified so far [20,22].

Immune responses are inducible phenomena resulting
from a close relationship between the environment, pathogen signal detection systems and the gene expression
machinery [23]. Upon pathogen recognition, several
transduction pathways are activated leading to the activation of TFs that induce gene expression [24]. In Drosophila
melanogaster, the Toll and Imd pathways converge in the
activation of the NFκB/Rel-related TFs, Dif and Relish,
respectively, which bind to NFκB REs located in the 5'
upstream regions of antimicrobial peptide genes, thus
promoting their transcription [25].
Understanding the transcriptional regulation mechanisms during insect immune response is of fundamental
interest in biology, but also could provide the rational
basis for developing strategies to control vector borne diseases. In this work, we describe that immunity genes
induced upon immune challenge in D. melanogaster and
Anopheles gambiae, the main African malaria vector, share
an enrichment of AT-rich motifs in their 5' regulatory
regions. Enrichment of AT-rich motifs was also observed
in 10 additional non-melanogaster Drosophila species and
Aedes aegypti immunity orthologs. These motifs are different to REs in terms of statistical frequency and length.
Their occurrence correlates with predicted nucleosomal
positions [18,20,22], suggesting that AT-rich motifs may
be involved in chromatinization and transcriptional regulation of immunity related transcriptional gene modules
in these insects.

Results
Regulatory regions of immunity-related co-expressed
genes of Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila
melanogaster induced upon immune challenge are
enriched in AT-rich specific DNA motifs
We used public available and author provided microarray
databases [26,27], coupled to bioinformatics analysis
tools for regulatory sequences, to identify sequence patterns potentially involved in transcriptional regulation
operating during immune response in D. melanogaster and
A. gambiae .

Microarray data describing the temporal transcriptional
profile for 13,196 D. melanogaster genes [27], and 2,883 A.
gambiae genes [26] in response to various immune challenges were used to select genes with the following expression profiles: immunity induced, repressed and nonmodified (Figure 1). The Drosophila microarray data were
obtained using OregonR adult males challenged with
Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus [27]. The Anopheles
microarray data were obtained using the A. gambiae cell
line 4a-3B challenged with several bacteria species or
microbial products [26]. Gene groups were selected
according to 1) gene ontology and Interpro assignments
as well as induction after an immune challenge, 2) genes

Groups of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster genes selected for in silico analysis for searching potential DNA regulatory motifs. 2500 nucleotides were
analyzed.

expression profiles of the three gene groups (immunity
induced, repressed and non-modified) of both species are
shown in Figure 1.
To investigate whether the 5' regulatory regions of immunity-related genes shared common DNA motifs, 2500 bp
5' upstream sequences (5'-US) were recovered using
Biomart, of Ensembl [28] and analyzed for statistically
overrepresented motifs of 2 to 8 nucleotides in length,
using Oligo-Analysis, which is based on binomial distribution [29]. The background oligonucleotide frequencies
were estimated calculating the relative frequencies of all
possible oligonucleotides (ranging from 2 to 8 bp) within
the 5'-US of 2500 bp of length of 13,166 A. gambiae or
13,172 D. melanogaster genes. Oligonucleotide occurrences were counted for each group of 5'-US and their statistical significance was estimated on the basis of the
background frequencies. The significance index (sigocc)
reflects the degree of overrepresentation of each motif on
a logarithmic scale [30].

Analysis of 5'-US of A. gambiae immunity genes showed
that the main motifs statistically overrepresented were
those of 2, 3 and 4 nucleotides in length (Table 8). Similar
to A. gambiae, D. melanogaster 5'-US of immunity genes
showed an enrichment of 2, 3 and 4 letter motifs (Table 8
and Tables 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). Motifs of these length in
5'-US of immunity genes showed higher sigocc than those
obtained in 5'-US of down-regulated and non-modified
genes in both insects. For A. gambiae immunity genes, the
highest score for 4 pb motifs was of 11.26 (ATAA), versus
2.59 (AAAA) and 2.46 (CGAC) in down-regulated and
non-modified genes, respectively (Table 9). Motifs of 3 bp
and 2 bp in length also present the highest sigocc in immunity induced A. gambiae genes: 6.11 for the AAA motif in
immunity genes, versus 0.77 for the same motif in downregulated genes, without 3 bp motif in non-modified
genes (Table 11); 20.99 for AA motif in immunity genes,
versus 0.72 and 1.73 for CG in down-regulated and nonmodified genes, respectively (Table 13). Similar results for
2, 3 and 4 bp motifs were obtained in D. melanogaster 5'US (Tables 10, 12 and 14). These observations underline
the high overrepresentation of certain motifs in 5'-US of

these insect immunity genes. Interestingly, the motifs
sequences with the highest scores in 5'-US of immunity
genes were the same in both organisms: TA, AA, AT, AAA
and ATAA (Table 8).
The sigocc for the ATAA motif in 2500 pb 5'-US of A. gambiae immunity genes was 11.26, indicating that this four
base-pairs motif is expected to occur in one of 1011.26
groups with similar numbers of sequences of the same
length of random sequences. In comparison, the ATAA
motif was not present in non-modified and down-regulated genes of A. gambiae (Table 15 and Table 9). The
ATAA motif in 5'-US D. melanogaster immunity genes
had a sigocc of 14.21, versus 2.2 in down-regulated genes,
and was absent in non-modified genes (Table 15 and
Table 10). Similar results were obtained for the conserved
motifs AAA, AA, AT and TA. These results indicate that sta-

tistical overrepresentation of these motifs is specific of
immunity genes 5'-US (Table 15).
In agreement to the Oligo-Analysis, bootstrapping analysis using POBO [31] confirmed that the average occurrence of the conserved motifs TA, AA, AT, AAA and ATAA,
was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in immunity promoters compared to the whole genome, the non-modified genes, down-regulated genes and the random
sequence sets for both insects (Figure 2).
As a consequence of AT-rich motifs over-representation, a
slight increase in AT% content was observed in 5'-US
immunity genes, the average AT% for D. melanogaster
immunity genes was of 60.4%, versus 57.6% and 57.2%
for non-modified and down-regulated genes, respectively,
these differences were not significant (p > 0.001), indicat-

ing that AT-rich motif over-representation was not due to
a significant increase in AT % that could lead to a random
AT-rich motifs enrichment. Similar results were obtained
for A. gambiae (Figure 3).
5' upstream regions of immunity-related orthologous genes
in the genus Drosophila and in Aedes aegypti are also
enriched with AT-rich motifs
In order to determine if other related dipteran species
share the same motifs identified in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, 5'-US of orthologous immunity genes of other
Drosophila species and another Culicidae family member,
Aedes aegypti were analyzed, regardless their transcriptional profile. Orthologous genes from those initially
selected from D. melanogaster expression profiles were
selected from the recently sequenced eleven Drosophila
species [32,33]. Tables 16 and 17 show the list of orthologous genes present in each Drosophila species and Ae.
aegypti. 5'-US from these genes were screened with OligoAnalysis. Figure 4 shows the results obtained for the 4bp
motifs TATA, AAAA, ATAA, AAAT and TTAA, which were
statistically over-represented in the majority of 5'-US of
immunity orthologous genes of 12 Drosophila species, A.
gambiae and Ae. aegypti. We observed some phylogenetic
correlations for some motifs. The most prevalent motif
and with the highest sigocc scores was the TATA motif,
which was within the best ranked for most Drosophila species (9/12), but absent in Anopheles and Aedes. The AAAA
motif was also highly ranked among some Drosophila species but not in mosquitoes. The ATAA motif was highly
ranked in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and A. gambiae, but
absent in other Drosophilas and Ae. aegypti. Finally, motifs

such as TTAA and AAAT were highly ranked in mosquitoes
only. Intriguingly, D. persimilis did not show any enrichment of AT-rich motifs at all, regardless its close genetic
distance to species displaying clear AT-rich motif enrichment. It should be noted that Sigocc values for the nonmelanogaster sequences and Ae. aegypti were considerably
lower than those observed in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster (Table 18. See additional file 1).
AT-rich tetrads are associated with high nucleosomal
potential
Once observed that AT-rich motif enrichment was a general feature of 5'-US of immunity genes in several dipteran
species, we evaluated the association of some of these
motifs with predicted nucleosomal sites. Experimentally
stable nucleosomes in mouse have AT-rich motifs, including the AA [20], TA [14,20], TATA and ATAA motifs [18].
The ATAA motif include the three 2 bp motifs statistically
over-represented in immunity genes (AA, TA and AT) of A.
gambiae and D. melanogaster. Taking into account the
highly conserved nucleosomal structure and given that
the ATAA motif was enriched in both D. melanogaster and
A. gambiae, as well as in other Drosophila species, we
hypothesized that the ATAA motif could also participate
in nucleosome formation in dipteran immune response
genes. Some algorithms have been developed to predict
the chromatin structure from sequence [20,22,34]. The
RECON algorithm uses experimentally determined nucleosomal sequences coupled to Monte Carlo methods and
discriminant analysis of dinucleotide frequencies [22]. It
searches for a partition of non-overlapping regions in the
nucleosomal sequences that provides the maximal value

of the Mahalanobis distance that discriminates between
nucleosomal and non-nucleosomal sequences. In this
way, RECON determines the probability that a sequence
forms nucleosomes and assign a nucleosomal potential
value to each nucleotide according to the context of the
sequence in which the nucleotide is immersed. Positive
values of nucleosomal potential correspond to reliable
predictions of nucleosome formation sites with a confidence level of p < 0.05 (α = 0.05), nucleosomal potential
of +1 corresponds to the best predictions.
Using RECON, ATAA motifs were preferentially associated
to positive values of nucleosomal potential in all the biological groups, both in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster
(Figure 5), supporting a possible role for this motif in
nucleosome formation. From Figure 5 is evident that
ATAA is associated with positive nucleosomal potential
values independently of the group of biological 5'-US analyzed. As expected, immunity, down-regulated, non-modified and random selected 5'-US of A. gambiae and D.
melanogaster, all have ATAA motifs, however, 5'-US of
immunity genes have a significant increased number of
ATAA motifs. The frequency of ATAA associated with positive nucleosomal potential in immunity 5'-US is higher

than non-modified (p = 0.001 both in A. gambiae and D.
melanogaster), down-regulated (p = 0.006 in A. gambiae
and p = 0.012 in D. melanogaster), random (p = 0.005 in
A. gambiae and p < 0.001 in D. melanogaster) and non-biological (artificial) sequences (p < 0.001 in A. gambiae and
D. melanogaster). Analyzing ATAA distribution per group
of genes, more than 70% and 80% of all ATAA motifs in
A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, respectively, were located
within regions of positive nucleosomal potential values (p
< 0.001), indicating a possible role of this motif in nucleosome formation.
Additional information derived from Figure 5 is that the
combination of RECON with Oligo-Analysis results
allows detection of a property inherent to biological
sequences. The ATAA distribution with respect to nucleosomal potential values was utterly different between biological and non-biological (artificial) sequences for both
insects. On the one hand, biological sequences had more
ATAA than non-biological sequences (1065 ATAA motifs
in 30 random biological sequences versus 613 in 30 random non-biological sequences). The majority of the biological ATAA motifs were associated to positive
nucleosomal potential (872/1065 or 81.9% motifs in 30

random biological sequences versus 208/613 or 33.9% in
30 random non-biological sequences). Additionally, the
non-biological sequences presented an inverse distribution of ATAA motifs, with more ATAA motifs associated to
negative values of nucleosomal potential (289/613 or
47.2% ATAA negatives versus 208/613 or 33.9% ATAA
positives in 30 random non-biological sequences).
We also evaluated the association of ATAA and TATA
motifs in D. ananassae, representing the non-melanogaster subgroup; D. pseudoobscura of the obscura group
and D. grimshawi, the most phylogenetically distant species belonging to the Hawaiian Drosophila, as well as the

TTAA and AAAT motif in Ae. aegypti (non-drosophilid dipteran), with nucleosomal potential calculated by the
RECON algorithm. As shown in Figure 6, both motifs in
the drosophilid species analyzed are clearly associated to
positive nucleosomal potential values (p < 0.001; Figure
6A–B). Similarly, both motifs analyzed in Ae. aegypti were
associated to high nucleosomal potential values and the
difference between AT-rich motifs with positive nucleosomal potential and AT-rich motifs with other values was
statistically significant (p < 0.001) (Figure 6C).
ATAA motifs correlate with high Nucleosomal Occupancy
p values (pNO)
Segal and col. [20] recently reported an algorithm to predict nucleosome positions that takes into account
sequence composition and thermodynamic properties.
Using a collection of nucleosome bound DNA sequences
from yeast, chicken or human, they constructed probabilistic models that represent the DNA sequence preferences
for nucleosome formation and assign a p value to each
nucleotide of the analyzed sequence; this value indicates
the probability that the position is occupied by a nucleosome (p of Nucleosomal Occupancy, pNO).

Applying the three models to all the groups of sequences
analyzed from A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, we found
that the ATAA motifs were associated with high pNO values when the sequences were analyzed using the yeast
model (Figure 7). Distribution of ATAA was very similar
to that obtained using RECON, showing a coincidence
between two independent methods to predict the association of ATAA with nucleosomal positions. All the biological groups of analyzed sequences presented ATAA motifs
associated largely with pNO > 0.8, however, immunity
genes had a significant increased number of ATAA associated with pNO > 0.8 values in relation to other biological
sequences (p < 0.05, except between immunity and downregulated genes of D. melanogaster, where p = 0.155).
More than 85% of all ATAA motifs found in 5'-US of A.
gambiae and D. melanogaster were associated with pNO >
0.8 (p < 0.001). For A. gambiae immunity genes, 88%
(476/541) of ATAA motifs were associated with pNO >
0.8, a similar distribution was obtained for the other A.
gambiae gene groups (Figure 7A). The difference between
ATAA associated with pNO > 0.8 and ATAA associated
with pNO < 0.5 or undefined values was statistically significant (p < 0.001), showing a clear correlation between
ATAA and high values of pNO. In a similar way, 85.9%
(1340/1560) of ATAA motifs in 5'-US D. melanogaster
immunity genes had pNO > 0.8, with a significant difference with regard to ATAA with pNO < 0.5 or undefined
values (p < 0.001), the distribution of ATAA in the other
D. melanogaster groups of genes also was statistically significant (p < 0.001) (Figure 7B).

The combination of Oligo-Analysis and pNO results also
revealed a difference between biological and non-biological sequences. Thirty randomly selected biological
sequences of D. melanogaster had 90% (959/1065) of
ATAA motifs associated with pNO > 0.8 versus 55.1%
(338/613) of ATAA motifs in 30 non-biological
sequences, showing again a non-random distribution of
biological ATAA motif and tagging it as part of a potential
nucleosomal code (Figure 7B).
Surprisingly no ATAA motifs were found with pNO values
between 0.8 and 0.5 (values that define the "medium p
value" range, see methods) in any of the other gene
groups analyzed in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster (Figure
7).
We evaluated the association to probability of nucleosomal occupancy (pNO) [20] of ATAA and TATA motifs in
D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura and D. grimshawi; and the
TTAA and AAAT motif in Ae. aegypti. As shown in Figure 8,
both motifs in the drosophilid species analyzed are clearly
associated to pNO > 0.8 values (p < 0.001, Figures 8A–B).
Similarly, both motifs analyzed in Ae. aegypti were associated to pNO > 0.8 values (p < 0.001, Figure 8C).

Taken together, we found a consistent tendency, demonstrated by two independent methods, showing that the
AT-rich motif enrichment within a specific sequence context might favour nucleosome formation in immune
genes of a wide variety of dipteran species.
A. gambiae and D. melanogaster 5'-US of immunity
genes have NF B response elements located in the first 500
pb of their 5'-US
NFκB transcription factors in both insects and vertebrates
are involved in immune gene expression regulation
[23,25]. Using MEME [35], NFκB REs were identified in
the 5'-US of immunity genes, but not in 5'-US of downregulated, non-modified and random genes. Moreover,
the NFκB REs were enriched within the first 500 bp of the
5'-US of immunity genes, both in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster (Figure 9). In order to investigate if there is a functional and physical association between ATAA motifs and
NFκB motifs, the distribution of ATAA motifs was analysed with respect to the transcription initiation site (TIS).
Although ATAA motifs were distributed along the whole
sequence in all gene groups, the highest frequencies were
found to be located within the -251 to -500 interval in
immunity genes in both insects (Figure 10). We further

quantified ATAA frequency within ± 200 bp from the
NFκB site of immunity, NM and DR genes in both insects.
In the case of A. gambiae, the frequency of ATAA motifs
around NFκB REs is significantly higher in immunity
genes compared to both non-modified (p < 0.01) and
down-regulated genes (p = 0.048). However, in the case of
D. melanogaster we did not find significant differences in
the ATAA frequency in relation to NFκB RE among the
gene groups (p > 0.1), although the tendency was equal to
that of A. gambiae (Figure 11). The association between
NFκB REs to AT-rich motifs and possibly nucleosomes of

immunity genes of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster may
function as a specific link between the chromatin structure
and the remodelling machinery needed for the expression
of immune response genes.

Discussion
In this work, we have documented that AT-rich motifs are
over-represented in 5' upstream regions of immunity
genes of mosquitoes and drosophilids. We documented
also that the position of the AT-rich motifs is associated to
nucleosomes as predicted by two different algorithms for

nucleosome positioning, pointing out to a possible role of
this motif in the transcriptional regulation of these functionally related genes through modification of chromatin
structure involving nucleosome positioning.
Previous reports have found that sequences that form
extremely stable nucleosomes are enriched with AT motifs
referred as TATA boxes, which in many cases included the
ATAA motif [18]. When we correlated the positions of this
motif with the output of two different algorithms that predict nucleosome positions [20,22], we found that this
motif correlates almost exclusively with positions with a
high probability to form nucleosomes, suggesting that the
ATAA motif enrichment is a DNA sequence pattern associated to nucleosome formation in these functionally
related immunity genes. The conservation of enrichment
of AT-rich motifs in 5'-US of immunity-related genes of
Drosophilidae and Culicidae, which diverged 250 million
years ago [36], suggest that this common feature may be
the result of evolutionary constrained epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional regulation in immune-responsive
genes in dipterans. More studies are required to define if
this could be part of a more general mechanism of regulation in metazoans. The case of D. persimilis represents a
caveat for our attempt generalize the implications of our
findings, however, we cannot exclude that the current status of the annotation of such genomes may affect the
results.
There are two conflicting views about nucleosome formation: one establishes that nucleosomes can potentially be

formed anywhere in the genome regardless the sequence
and therefore, it is not possible to predict sites for nucleosome formation [4]. The other proposes that nucleosomes
are associated to certain DNA sequences or sequence patterns that have an effect on the bending properties of DNA
during nucleosome formation [14,18]. This point of view
has been gaining support in recent years due to the documentation of a great variability in the bending potential of
DNA sequences [14,15,37] and therefore their capacity to
form nucleosomes [18,38,39].
Two of the three two-letter motifs statistically over-represented in immunity promoters of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster, TA and AA, have been previously associated to
nucleosome formation in human, yeast, chicken and
mouse [14,15,20,21]. Additionally, the ATAA motif,
which is associated to nucleosome positions, and includes
the three motifs containing two letters with the highest
scores in both organisms (AA, TA and AT), have been
found in sequences that form stable nucleosomes [18].
Thus, AT-rich motifs in 5'-US regions of mosquitoes and
drosophilid immunity genes could participate in the transcriptional regulation of genes induced by immune challenges in a different way to the typical response elements.
In contrast to response elements, which can be functional
single or in pairs in a promoter region, the AT-rich motifs
are statistically enriched, with several copies distributed in
a diffuse pattern through the promoter regions, suggesting
its involvement in nucleosome formation. This diffuse
sequence pattern of AT-rich motifs, different to discreet
patterns displayed by response elements, represents a new

insight on the role of DNA sequence context in transcriptional regulation.

both programs are biological nucleosomal sequences
from which information is extracted.

Several reports have documented that genes with similar
functions share similar nucleosomal occupancy patterns.
Levitsky and col. [34], using the RECON algorithm to analyze distinct functional types of human promoters, found
that tissue-specific gene promoters present higher nucleosomal potential than genes commonly expressed in many
tissues (housekeeping genes). Segal and col. [20], using
the Nucleosome Position Prediction algorithm to analyze
different kinds of genomic sequences and gene sets biologically related, found that nucleosome occupancy varies
depending of the analyzed genomic location type, and
that groups of genes functionally related can be classified
on the basis of their profiles of nucleosome occupancy in
the open reading frames and intergenic regions. Recently,
Lee and col. [40], using Hidden Markov Models to analyze
experimentally obtained nucleosomes, also found a correlation between function and nucleosome occupancy.
Each of these reports used a different method to analyze
data sequences, and all found that nucleosomal sequences
follow a distinctive pattern associated to the functionality
of the genes.

It has been shown that gene expression co-regulation is
highly conserved in eukaryotes, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, which diverged
1500 million years ago, still share a group of co-regulated
genes [41], so it is plausible that Drosophilidae and Culicidae which diverged only 250 million years ago also share
groups of functionally related co-regulated genes. The
enrichment of AT-rich motifs in groups of co-regulated
genes involved in immune response could provide the
basis for developing new tools for the identification of different functional gene modules based on the compositional context of non-coding regulatory DNA. However,
the high sigocc observed in manually curated datasets compared to the low sigocc observed in automatically annotated datasets highlights the importance of accurate TIS
for regulatory region analysis.

In relation to RECON [22] and Nucleosome Positioning
Prediction [20], it is important to note that none of these
programs search for a priori defined motifs, the input for

Insect immunity relies on innate defense mechanisms to
combat pathogens. In D. melanogaster, the Imd and Toll
pathways lead to the activation of Rel/NFκB transcription
factors that control a substantial proportion of the transcriptionally modified genes in response to pathogen
infection [42]. Many components of these pathways are
conserved in A. gambiae and Ae. aegypti [43] and are also
remarkably conserved in innate immunity signaling pathways in mammals (TLR and TNF-R signaling pathways,

NFκB, the enrichment with the ATAA motif constitutes a
particular pattern of chromatin structure involved in transcriptional
regulation
of
these
genes.
Interestingly, NFκB transcription factors bind to their
response elements even if they are packaged in a nucleosome [53]. Once bound to their response elements, NFκB
transcription factors can recruit chromatin remodeling
complexes to expose other response elements and allow
the formation of the initiation complex [54]. In the vertebrate immune system, chromatin structure is critical to
establish Th1-Th2 differentiation through the action of
specific transcription factor as GATA-3 and T-bet [55], and
several cytokines posses nucleosomes located in their promoters which need to be removed to allow gene expression [56-59]. Thus, epigenetic phenomena such as histone
modification (altered nucleosome conformation) [60] or
remodeling of chromatin (change of nucleosome position) [61] are commonly a required step to achieve gene
expression in response to external stimuli.
Based on the obtained results and previously reported
information, we propose a model in which a subgroup of
insect immunity genes remains silent in absence of an
immune challenge due to nucleosome formation in their
5'-US regions. The presence of these nucleosomes
occludes the access of transcription factors to REs involved
in gene expression. After an immune challenge, the Toll
and/or Imd pathways are activated which in turn lead to
activation of Rel/NFκB transcription factors, which are
translocated to the nucleus and bind to their NFκB REs
and recruit chromatin modifying/remodeling factors that
release DNA from nucleosomes allowing its interaction
with the transcriptional machinery.

respectively) [33,44-47]. The set of induced genes in both
insects described here belong to the same functional
group and many of them have NFκB response elements
within 500 pb upstream from the predicted transcription
start site, the same location where functionally important
NFκB REs have been found in these and other insects [4852]. Our findings indicate that besides being regulated by

Functionally related genes could harbor in their regulatory region a regulatory code represented by the combination of REs plus, in some cases, particular short motifs
associated to chromatin structure. This regulatory code
functions like a lock, genes that need to be co-expressed
will share the same lock, represented by REs organized in
a similar way, or by specific REs associated to motifs that
confer a distinctive chromatin structure. Cells are continuously sensing its environment and responding to adapt.
The regulatory state of the cell, defined by the presence
and state of activity of transcription factors [3], also
changes continuously; this regulatory state represents the
"key" needed to open the proposed lock. The active transcription factors present in a given time in the cell, determines the form of the "key" for the lock, and therefore, the
class of promoters that will be open or closed. In the case
of the immune genes studied here, we have identified evidence that is compatible with a potential regulatory unit
involving chromatin structure (associated with ATAA),
Rel/NFκB transcription factors and NFκB response ele-

ments. Other regulatory codes could exist involving anyone of these components, in addition to others.
The role of chromatin structure in gene expression regulation during immune response of insects remains poorly
explored. This work provides a first insight into this complex regulatory mechanism potentially shared by immune
genes of drosophilidae and culicidae.

Conclusion
Immunity genes of A. gambiae, Ae. aegypti, D. melanogaster
and many other Drosophilid species share a common
enrichment of AT-rich motifs in their 5'-US regions. ATrich motifs are frequently associated to bioinformatic
nucleosome positioning predictions, suggesting their participation in a particular nucleosome organization
involved in transcriptional regulation of an immunity coregulated module. Many of these regulatory regions also
have NFκB response elements within the first 500 bp 5'

from the transcription start site. These two features suggest
that the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of
immune response genes in dipterans are conserved and
might occur through modifications in chromatin structure of promoter regions mediated by NFκB-dependent
recruitment of remodeling factors. Our findings suggest
that AT-rich motif enrichment in regulatory regions in this
group of co-regulated genes could represent an evolutionary constrained signature in dipterans and perhaps other
species, despite their evolutionary distance.

Methods
Gene selection criteria
Microarray data for A. gambiae immune response was
kindly provided by the author [26]. Microarray data from
D. melanogaster immune response [27] was downloaded
from [62]. Analysis of expression profiles was conducted
using the TMEV version 3.1 module of TM4 microarray
software suite [63].

Using these definitions, for A. gambiae, we first selected
the expression profiles and the associated gene was then
identified. To verify the annotated transcription initiation
site, each gene prediction was manually curated by two
approaches: The first was by aligning corresponding EST
clusters obtained from AnoEST [67] and UNIGENE [68]
to the A. gambiae genome (AgamP3, Ensembl release 45,
Jun 2007) using BLAST in the ENSEMBL genome browser
[28]. The second was based on manual verification of the
presence of either TATA-box, Initiator sequence (Inr) or
downstream promoter element (DPE) [69]. For Drosophila, the gene ID was included in the microarray database.

Once the gene associated with each profile was identified,
the 5' regulatory regions were recovered for D. melanogaster (BDGP4.3) and A. gambiae (AgamP3, Ensembl
release 45, Jun 2007) genes using Ensembl's data mining
tool Biomart [70].

sequences), R2.2 for D. pseudooscura (27 sequences) and
R5.7 for D. melanogaster (35 sequences) and 15 Aedes
aegypti [72] 2500 bp sequences retrieved from Biomart
[70] (AAEGL1) were also included for motif over-representation analysis. Selection of the Drosophila sequences
was done based on orthology to D. melanogaster immunity gene data set described in Table 16, according to FlyBase annotations, but not expression data. For Ae. aegypti,
genes were also selected based on one to one orthology to
immunity genes in A. gambiae according to Table 17.
Statistically overrepresented DNA motifs
To identify statistically overrepresented DNA motifs in 5'
DNA regulatory regions of selected genes, we used the
Oligo-Analysis program [29] searching for DNA motifs of
2 to 8 nucleotides of length in 5' upstream regions of 2500
or 2000 nucleotides. For the analysis, we created our own
expected frequency tables for each motif length, using 5'
upstream regions of 2500 nucleotides length corresponding to 13,172 genes of D. melanogaster; 13,166 genes of A.
gambiae, and 16,691 in Ae. aegypti. A similar approach was
used for the 11 additional Drosophila species using precomputed 2000 bp upstream 5' sequences. The obtained
expected frequency tables were used to estimate the
expected number of occurrences for each oligonucleotide
in induced, down-regulated, non-modified, random biological and random no-biological sets of sequences. The
analyzed sequences were aligned to detect and avoid
duplication between sequences, and duplicated regions
larger than 40 nucleotides inside a sequence were
removed. Also, to prevent a bias due to self-overlapping, a
non-overlapping mode was adopted. The detection of
overrepresented oligonucleotides was based on an estimation of the significance of the observed occurrences (Oocc).
For each oligonucleotide, the p value (Pocc) was calculated
on the basis of the binomial distribution. Because the
analysis comprise multiple tests (256 in the case of tetranucleotides), the possibility exists that even low p values
appeared by chance. To correct for such a multitesting
effect, the p values were multiplied by the number of oligonucleotides. This correction results in an expected value
(Eocc). The significance index [sigocc = -log(Eocc)] reflects
the degree of overrepresentation for each oligonucleotide
in a logarithmic scale [30].

The motifs overrepresentation identified with Oligo-Analysis, was verified using POBO [31], which uses bootstrap
to verify the statistical overrepresentation of a given motif.
Nucleosome positioning prediction
To predict regions of nucleosomal occupancy in the
sequences of the distinct groups of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster 5'-US, we used two programs: RECON [22],
which assigns a nucleosomal potential value at each posi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/326

tion in a sequence using sliding windows of 160 pb based
on statistical distribution of dinucleotide frequencies, and
Nucleosome Position Prediction [20], which predicts
nucleosomal positioning using probabilistic and thermodynamic models, assigning a p value of nucleosomal
occupancy (pNO) to each position of a sequence. For this
last program, we analyzed 5'-US using yeast, chicken and
human models, and both published and working versions
of the program. The length of the 5'-US analyzed was of
2500 bp for A. gambiae, D. melanogaster and Ae. aegypti
and 2000 bp for non-melanogaster Drosophila species. For
RECON, we used 2660 bp that comprised the 2500 pb
promoter, flanked by 80 bp, in order to recover nucleosomal potential values for all promoter positions.
Analysis of motifs position regarding predicted
nucleosomal regions
To associate the results obtained with the program OligoAnalysis and those obtained with RECON and Nucleosome Position Prediction, perl scripts were written to
automatically associate motifs coordinates (obtained with
DNA-Pattern, [65] with tables containing "Nucleosomal
potential" values (obtained with RECON) or "p of nucleosomal occupancy (pNO)" values (obtained with Nucleosome Position Prediction).

To determine if there was a correlation between the findings of Oligo-analysis and RECON, using perl scripts, the
corresponding value of nucleosomal potential obtained
with RECON was assigned to each position of the ATAA
motif, having four values for each motif, on basis to these
four values each ATAA motif was classified as: 1) positive,
if the four positions of ATAA were positive; 2) negative, if
the four positions were negative; 3) mixed, if at least one
position was of opposite sign to the others, and 4) undefined, if at least one position was an N. Once classified,
the distribution of ATAA motifs between these four categories was statistically evaluated.
Similarly, to determine if there was a correlation between
the findings of Oligo-analysis and Nucleosome Position
Prediction, using perl scripts, the corresponding pNO
value obtained with the algorithm "Nucleosome Position
Prediction" was assigned to each position of the ATAA
motif, having again four values for each motif, one per
each position. Based on these four values, each ATAA
motif was classified as: 1) high p value motif if the four
positions had occupancy p values higher than 0.8, 2)
medium p value motif if the four positions had occupancy
p values between 0.8 an 0.5, 3) low p value motif if the
four positions had occupancy p values below of 0.5, and
4) undefined if at least one value were not belonging to
the same range of values. Additionally, given that this software uses yeast, chicken and human models, and have a
working and a published version, data generated with

each model and each version were analyzed. This program
does not accept sequences with Ns, therefore, in some
cases the number of sequences analyzed by group of 5'
upstream sequences was slightly smaller. For A. gambiae:
16 immunity, 12 down-regulated, 17 random genes and
17 non-modified. For D. melanogaster, only the group of
non-modified genes was modified, from 32 to 31
sequences. For the other Drosophila species and Ae. aegypti
the number of analysed sequences was the same for both
programs.
Analysis of 5'-US with alignment matrices
Using alignment matrices constructed on NFκB REs identified in immunity 5'-US of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster
by MEME [35] (Figure 12), a matrix-based search was carried out in the different groups of genes using the PATSER
algorithm [73], searching for NFκB REs. A lower threshold
estimation of 5.0 was assigned.
Statistical analysis
In order to compare the distribution of AT-rich motifs
associated with positive nucleosomal potential values
among groups of genes, we fitted ordinary least squares
regression models with robust standard errors, with the
number of positive AT-rich motifs as the dependent variable and dummy variables of the corresponding group of
genes as predictors for all dipteran species. We fitted similar models to compare among groups of genes the distribution of AT-rich motifs associated with pNO > 0.8, and
the AT% difference between groups of genes. Additionally, we compared the number of AT-rich motifs within all
types of nucleotide sequences, either associated with pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/326

itive vs. negative values of nucleosomal potential or pNO
> 0.8 vs. pNO < 0.5, by use of paired Student's T tests.
To evaluate the distribution of NFκB REs throughout the
promoter regions, comparisons were done using Poisson
regression with the count of NFκB RE as response variable
and the group of genes as independent variable. The models support the χ2 goodness-of-fit test, when the model
was not supported, a Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test
was done. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was
performed to compare the counts of ATAA in the vicinity
(± 200 bp) of NFκB motifs by type of gene group (immunity, non-modified and down-regulated), in both A. gambiae and D. melanogaster.
