Hantaviruses are rodent-borne negative-sense RNA
viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, genus
Hantavirus. These emerging viruses cause cardiopulmonary syndrome in North and South America, which
is a respiratory illness following the inhalation of dust
contaminated by infectious rodent feces or urine.
Until recently, no information was available related to
the presence of hantavirus in French Guyana, a French
department in South America. Nevertheless, the description of atypical pneumonia cases unrelated to any
known etiological agent and the identification of hantavirus reservoirs in neighboring countries led us to conduct a serological study in a collection of sera from
patients who had presented compatible symptoms: the
prevalence of IgG antibodies to hantavirus in this population was 1.42%.
After those retroactive results, systematic hantavirus
serology screening was implemented in every newcoming patient with suggestive etiology. This led us to identify a native case in French Guyana. After this first case,
a second case was registered 1 year later in December
2009 (in a periurban area). Molecular analyses were conducted to characterize genetically these two strains of
hantavirus. Complete sequences of the S segment were
obtained and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that
strains isolated in French Guyana and tentatively named
Maripa virus belong to the Rio Mamore species.
Human hantavirus epidemics are associated with fluctuations of rodent populations, caused by climatic, ecological and environmental changes, or growing human
activities associated with nature or agriculture. In
Guyana, 90% of the land is still tropical rain forest, but

economic development results in growing pressures on
natural habitats. Continuous surveillance of the virus in
the human population would be beneficial. Furthermore,
surveys of potential reservoirs may help to understand
hantavirus dispersion and to reduce the risk of viral
emergence.
