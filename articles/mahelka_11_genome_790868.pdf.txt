On the genome constitution and evolution of
intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum
intermedium: Poaceae, Triticeae)
Václav Mahelka1*, David Kopecký2 and Ladislava Paštová1

Abstract
Background: The wheat tribe Triticeae (Poaceae) is a diverse group of grasses representing a textbook example of
reticulate evolution. Apart from globally important grain crops, there are also wild grasses which are of great
practical value. Allohexaploid intermediate wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium (2n = 6x = 42), possesses many
desirable agronomic traits that make it an invaluable source of genetic material useful in wheat improvement.
Although the identification of its genomic components has been the object of considerable investigation, the
complete genomic constitution and its potential variability are still being unravelled. To identify the genomic
constitution of this allohexaploid, four accessions of intermediate wheatgrass from its native area were analysed by
sequencing of chloroplast trnL-F and partial nuclear GBSSI, and genomic in situ hybridization.
Results: The results confirmed the allopolyploid origin of Thinopyrum intermedium and revealed new aspects in its
genomic composition. Genomic heterogeneity suggests a more complex origin of the species than would be
expected if it originated through allohexaploidy alone. While Pseudoroegneria is the most probable maternal parent
of the accessions analysed, nuclear GBSSI sequences suggested the contribution of distinct lineages corresponding
to the following present-day genera: Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum, Taeniatherum, Aegilops and Thinopyrum. Two
subgenomes of the hexaploid have most probably been contributed by Pseudoroegneria and Dasypyrum, but the
identity of the third subgenome remains unresolved satisfactorily. Possibly it is of hybridogenous origin, with
contributions from Thinopyrum and Aegilops. Surprising diversity of GBSSI copies corresponding to a Dasypyrum-like
progenitor indicates either multiple contributions from different sources close to Dasypyrum and maintenance of
divergent copies or the presence of divergent paralogs, or a combination of both. Taeniatherum-like GBSSI copies
are most probably pseudogenic, and the mode of their acquisition by Th. intermedium remains unclear.
Conclusions: Hybridization has played a key role in the evolution of the Triticeae. Transfer of genetic material via
extensive interspecific hybridization and/or introgression could have enriched the species’ gene pools significantly.
We have shown that the genomic heterogeneity of intermediate wheatgrass is higher than has been previously
assumed, which is of particular concern to wheat breeders, who frequently use it as a source of desirable traits in
wheat improvement.

Background
A significant proportion of grasses from the wheat tribe
Triticeae (Poaceae) is closely linked with the history of
human civilization. Apart from the globally important
major grain crops wheat, barley and rye, many wild
grasses were either grown as primitive crops in the past

invaluable source of genetic material potentially useful
in crop improvement. Intermediate wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth et D. R. Dewey, is
a predominantly hexaploid (2n = 6x = 42) grass of great
practical value. Thanks to its high production, drought
and frost tolerance and non-invasiveness, it is excellent
as forage and for erosion control in areas with harsh
environmental conditions [1]. It also possesses resistance

to a number of pests and diseases of wheat. An artificial
hybrid between intermediate wheatgrass and wheat,
×Trititrigia cziczinii Tsvel., was described by Tsitsin [2]
and taxonomically validated by Tsvelev [3]. Because of
its crossability with wheat, intermediate wheatgrass has
been used extensively as an alien genetic resource for
wheat improvement. Many of its desirable traits have
been introduced into the wheat genome [4-8].
The economic importance of this hexaploid prompted
considerable efforts to identify its genomic components.
Despite this, its entire genomic constitution and its potential variability remain unresolved. Earlier studies based on
the degree of chromosome pairing at meiosis in artificial
hybrids have put forward multiple theories concerning the
species’ genomic constitution. Triticum L. genomes were
often thought to be involved in the genome of intermediate wheatgrass [9-11]. However, often controversial conclusions were drawn because of the inability to distinguish
between auto- and allosyndetic pairing at meiosis. After
researchers recognized the possible role of autosyndetic
pairing, more convincing conclusions have been reached.
Thinopyrum intermedium has been described as a segmental autoallohexaploid, consisting of two closely related,
partially homologous, genomes and one distinctly diverse
genome, with at least one genome being homologous with
Agropyron elongatum (Host) P. Beauv. (= Thinopyrum
elongatum (Host) D. R. Dewey) [12-15]. Löve [16] placed
intermediate wheatgrass in the genus Elytrigia Desv.
According to his treatment, Elytrigia polyploids consist of
three different basic genomes J, E, S, representing closely
related Thinopyrum Á. Löve and Lophopyrum Á. Löve,
and Pseudoroegneria (Nevski) Á. Löve haplomes, respectively. The contribution of Pseudoroegneria was later confirmed by Liu and Wang [17] and Assadi and Runemark
[18]. In the 1990s, the genomic in situ hybridization technique (GISH) established itself as a valuable tool for genome structure analyses, making it possible to indicate
potential progenitors of polyploid species. Using GISH,
Chen et al. [19] examined the genomic constitution of Th.
intermedium. Their results indicated that it contained
three distinguishable chromosome sets designated J, JS
and S, with 17-21, 6-11 and 13-14 chromosomes, respectively. The J genome was related to both Th. elongatum
and Th. bessarabicum (Savul. & Rayss) Á. Löve, the JS genome referred to a modified Th. elongatum/Th. bessarabicum genome, and the S genome originated from
Pseudoroegneria strigosa (M. Bieb.) Á. Löve. Similar conclusions were drawn by Tang et al. [6], who described the
genomic composition of Th. intermedium as 21J + 7JS
+14S. Kishii et al. [20] revealed that V genome of Dasypyrum villosum (L.) P. Candargy (hereafter, genome symbols are according to Wang et al. [21]) could be also
involved in the genome of Th. intermedium based on
GISH. They concluded that a more complex genomic

Page 2 of 17

structure is likely in this allopolyploid species, with some
potential progenitors still unidentified. Remarkably, a large
amount of polymorphism and structure modifications,
indicating intrapopulational polymorphism with not all
accessions having an identical genomic structure, was
observed using GISH [6,19,20] and C-banding [22-24]
techniques.
Sequence-based markers represent another potent
approach towards disentangling the evolutionary relationships within diverse polyploid complexes, single- (or
low-) copy nuclear genes being among the most widely
used [25-29]. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI)
was proved to be a single-copy gene in all grasses studied
so far [30] and has been successfully employed to examine the origin of several polyploid species
[25,26,28,29,31]. On the one hand, GBSSI turned out to
be sensitive enough to indicate past introgression [26].
On the other hand, apart from limitations involving
duplication and deletion events [32-34], one disadvantage
of applying sequence-based markers alone stems from
the inability to distinguish whether different gene copies
represent true homoeologs representing whole chromosome sets or mere chromosome segments acquired
through hybridization or introgression. Sequence-based
markers together with in situ hybridization are a powerful set of tools for clarifying such complex situations [35].
Along with biparentally inherited nuclear genes, chloroplast markers have been used to identify maternal parents
of polyploid species [29,36-39]. Notably, a highly asymmetric pattern of cytoplasmic gene flow has been documented within the Triticeae. Pseudoroegneria (St) turned
out to be the maternal parent in allopolyploids containing the St nuclear genome in combination with other
genomes [25,36,38,40-42]. Recently, Zhang et al. [43] also
provided evidence for cpDNA inheritance from other
parents than those containing a St nuclear genome.
Despite the high effectiveness of using sequence-based
markers in biosystematic studies, they have never been
employed to investigate the genomic composition of
allohexaploid Thinopyrum intermedium. In the present
study, we therefore analyse four accessions of hexaploid
Th. intermedium from its native area in Central Europe
(Czech Republic) using (1) chloroplast trnL-F sequences
to identify which maternal lineage has contributed to
the formation of the species; (2) partial GBSSI sequences
to identify lineages involved in the formation of its
nuclear genome; and (3) genomic in situ hybridization
to assess the contribution of the putative diploid donor
species revealed by trnL-F and GBSSI sequences.

Four accessions of hexaploid Thinopyrum intermedium
(Host) Barkworth et D. R. Dewey [syn. Elytrigia

intermedia (Host) Nevski, Agropyron intermedium
(Host) P. Beauv.] were analysed. Their choice was based
on morphological, flow cytometric, cpDNA and ITS
diagnostic markers [44,45] applied in concert to avoid
possible inclusion of recent hybrids into the analyses.
All samples originated from different parts of the Czech
Republic with the aim to cover potential geographic
variability: Thinopyrum intermedium-1: 3 km NE of
Podbořany town, top of Rubín hill, steppe, 50°15.220’ N,
13°26.207’ E; Thinopyrum intermedium-2: Brno town,
Kamenný hill, roadside, 49°11.042’ N, 16°33.085’ E; Thinopyrum intermedium-3: 4.5 km N of town Mikulov,
steppe, 49°50.425’ N, 16°38.417’ E; Thinopyrum intermedium-4: 4.0 km E of Radějov village, Čertoryje reserve,
White Carpathians, mesophilous meadow, 48°51.342’ N,
17°24.748’ E. Localities of accessions Thinopyrum intermedium-1-3 correspond to localities 01, 05 and 35 of
Mahelka et al. [44]. All accessions are cultivated in the
experimental garden at the Institute of Botany of the
Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in Průhonice, Czech Republic, and herbarium specimens are
deposited at the institute’s herbarium (PRA).
Methods
DNA extraction and amplification

Genomic DNA was extracted according to [46], but
fresh leaves were crushed in liquid nitrogen.
TrnL-F amplification The chloroplast trnL-F region
was amplified for accessions Thinopyrum intermedium-3
and -4 as described in [45]. Sequences of accessions Thinopyrum intermedium-1 and -2 were adopted from a
previous study [45] (GenBank accession numbers
DQ912408 and DQ912410 respectively). PCR products
were purified using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and directly sequenced
(GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany) using the primers
c, f and e [47]. Electropherograms were edited manually
and sequences were deposited in GenBank (Th. intermedium-3: GU292419, Th. intermedium-4: GU292420).
Granule-bound starch synthase I amplification PCR
amplifications using two sets of primers (F-for/M-bac,
F-for/K-bac [30]), and cloning of PCR products were
done as described in [35]. Since F-for/M-bac primers
preferentially amplified one gene variant in preliminary
analyses, F/M products were sequenced directly in forward and reverse direction with no need for cloning. To
eliminate the preferentially amplified gene variant and
to retrieve a reasonable proportion of diverse gene variants [see [25]], between 26-40 F/K clones per accession
were sequenced using the F-for primer, depending on
the variation found within each plant.
Alignments and choice of sequences

trnL-F Four Th. intermedium sequences were aligned
along with 46 sequences of monogenomic taxa from

Page 3 of 17

throughout the tribe Triticeae downloaded from GenBank (Table 1). Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using the program CLUSTAL_X [48], and the
primary alignment was refined manually in BioEdit [49].
The final alignment of 1179 nucleotide sites consisted of
the trnL(Leu) intron (alignment positions 1-657), the
trnL gene (3’-exon; 658-708) and the trnL-F intergenic
spacer (709-1179). The alignment is available as additional file (Additional file 1: Alignment of chloroplast
trnL-F sequences).
GBSSI Amplified GBSSI sequences of each plant were
aligned separately with Clustal_X and corrected in BioEdit. Since Th. intermedium is allohexaploid, several
divergent homoeologous sequence types were amplified
in each plant. The main objective of this study was to
identify the origin of diverse homoeologous copies in
the allopolyploid rather than analysing the variation
found within each accession in detail. Therefore, unique
substitutions (singletons, i.e., phylogenetically uninformative polymorphic sites in which a rare base is found
in only one of the sequences) were omitted when
assigning sequences to groups. Sequences displaying a
mosaic sequence pattern, i.e., combining different parts
typical of individual sequence groups, were considered
recombinant and excluded from the analyses. Only one
sequence per group displaying the least number of singletons was included in the analyses. A list of 18 Th.
intermedium GBSSI sequences used in phylogenetic
analyses including their GenBank accession numbers is
presented in Table 2.
Representative accessions of monogenomic diploid
taxa from throughout the tribe Triticeae plus two Bromus L. accessions used as an outgroup were retrieved
from GenBank (Table 1) and aligned with the Th. intermedium sequences using Clustal_X. The final alignment
was improved manually in BioEdit. Intriguingly, two
very different GBSSI sequences of Dasypyrum villosum
were downloaded from GenBank (AF079274 and
AY556480). These sequences were excluded from the
dataset because they appeared in different parts of the
phylogenetic tree in preliminary analyses. We replaced
them with two newly amplified F-for/K-bac sequences
from one individual of D. villosum (USDA accession
identifier PI639751). All procedures including DNA
extraction, PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing
were done as described for Th. intermedium. Out of ten
sequences, two slightly different clones (GU292417 and
GU292418), matching the sequence AF079274 in
exploratory phylogenetic analysis, were found and used
in phylogenetic analyses.
Alignment of Th. intermedium sequences and other
Triticeae was straightforward in all exon regions and a
major part of intron 9, but ambiguous in two regions.
Firstly, in intron 10, two strongly divergent sequence

Sequences representing different GBSSI variants amplified in four Thinopyrum
intermedium accessions using the F/M and F/K primers. Sequences marked
with an asterisk were amplified with F/M primers and directly sequenced. The
numbers of sequenced F/K clones and putative recombinants are provided for
each accession. Sequence identifier, GenBank accession number and inferred
sequence origin are given. After each sequence identifier, the number of
identical clones amplified in each accession is given in parentheses.

General approach To place the trnL-F and GBSSI
sequences obtained from Th. intermedium in a phylogenetic context within the Triticeae, two phylogenetic
reconstruction methods were employed for each marker:
Bayesian analysis and maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. Prior to the phylogenetic analyses, the potential phylogenetic information contained in indel regions was
examined in several preliminary analyses. Unambiguous
indels were coded following the Modified complex indel
coding (MCIC) method of Müller [50], whereby the
phylogenetic information contained in indels was implemented into data matrices. For the purpose of MP analyses, this was done automatically using the program
SeqState [51], generating a NEXUS output file, which
can be readily executed in PAUP* 4b10 [52]. For Bayesian analyses, the extension of the nucleotide matrix of
the NEXUS output file containing coded indels as characters was manually added to the nucleotide data
matrix. The data file was then analysed as a combined
dataset, consisting of DNA (nucleotide characters) and
standard (indel characters) data. Coding of indels did
not have a great effect on the resulting tree topologies,
but it increased topological robustness within some
clades in which Th. intermedium sequences appeared.
Coding of indels was applied in all analyses except for

Mahelka et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:127
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/127

the Bayesian analysis of trnL-F sequences, in which it
did not improve results.
GBSSI Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was undertaken
using MrBayes 3.1.2 [53,54] as follows: (i) The model of
molecular evolution that best fit the DNA data partition
was determined with MrModeltest 2.3 [55]; (ii) According to the SYM + G model determined by the hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Tests (hLRTs), six substitution
rates and gamma distribution were specified as settings;
(iii) Bromus tectorum L. was used as an outgroup; (iv)
Two simultaneous Metropolis coupled MCMC analyses
with four chains each were run, incrementally heated by
a temperature of 0.1 for 3.5 million generations, and
every 100th tree was sampled; (v) After stationarity was
reached, the first 25% trees were discarded as burn-in,
and a consensus tree with branch lengths and posterior
probabilities was computed. The MP analysis was run in
PAUP* as heuristic searches with 10 random addition
replicates, tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch
swapping, and keeping no more than 100 trees of length
greater than or equal to 1 in each replicate. Bromus tectorum and B. sterilis L. were used as an outgroup. A
85% majority-rule consensus tree was constructed. As a
measure of topological robustness, bootstrapping was
carried out with 1000 replicates using the same settings.
TrnL-F Phylogenetic analyses were performed as
described for GBSSI, with the following modifications:
Bayesian analysis - (i) According to the F81 + I + G
model, one substitution rate and gamma distribution
with a proportion of invariable sites were specified as
settings; (ii) Psathyrostachys fragilis (Boiss.) Nevski was
used as the outgroup; (iii) The analysis was run for 3

P. juncea (Fisch.) Nevski were used as the outgroup.
Sequence divergence and estimation of functional role of
Th. intermedium GBSSI sequences

Coding sequences were translated using BioEdit and
checked for stop codons. Sequences which contained
stop codons were excluded from further analyses. Pairwise distances between representative GBSSI sequences
were calculated using MEGA4 [56] with Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) method and tabulated. Positions containing
alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only
in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion
option). We used ratios of non-synonymous substitutions per non-sysnonymous sites to synonymous substitutions per synonymous sites (Ka/Ks) in protein-coding
portions of the sequences as an indicator of adaptive
molecular evolution [57]. The Ka/Ks ratios, as described
by Liberles [58] were calculated using an online server
[59]. An excess of non-synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks
> 1) is an indicator of positive selection, while an excess
of synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks < 1) indicates purifying selection imposed by functional constraints.

Neutral evolution is reflected in ratios near 1. To determine the evolutionary rates of the representative F/K
sequences, substitution rate heterogeneity among coding
sequences was examined using Tajima’s relative rate test
[60] by using MEGA4 with Bromus tectorum sequence
(AY362757) as the outgroup. The test compares two
sequences with an outgroup sequence by counting
unique substitutions in both sequences. The molecular
clock hypothesis can be rejected if one of the sequences
accumulates a significantly larger number of
substitutions.
Genomic in situ hybridization

Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to analyse the contribution of presumed progenitors of four
accessions of Th. intermedium. At least five metaphase
spreads for each of the four accessions were analysed.
Using the Biotin-Nick Translation Kit or the DIG-Nick
Translation Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) we labeled
total genomic DNA of the following species: Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve (USDA accession identifier PI563869), Dasypyrum villosum (L.) P. Candargy
(PI639751), Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski
(PI598389), Thinopyrum elongatum (PI531718), and
Aegilops tauschii Coss (PI542278). The selection of species used as probes was based on the GBSSI-based phylogeny (see results). All these species were confirmed to
be diploids by chromosome counts (data not shown).
Seeds of the accessions were kindly provided by the
Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) of
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In
situ hybridization and detection were done as described
in [35] under conditions of 77% stringency. Slides were
evaluated under an Olympus AX70 microscope
equipped with epi-fluorescence and a SensiCam B/W
camera. ScionImage and Adobe Photoshop software
were used for processing of color images. Reprobing of
the slides was applied according to [61].

Results
Chloroplast trnL-F

Sequences of accessions Thinopyrum intermedium-1, -3
and -4 were identical and differed from the sequence of
accession Th. intermedium-2 by one substitution. The
matrix of 50 sequences comprised 1179 characters, 1098
of which were invariant and 51 were parsimony-informative. When unambiguous indels were converted into
coded characters (for MP analysis), the final matrix contained 1207 characters, of which 1098 were invariant
and 67 were parsimony-informative. Both phylogenetic
analyses resulted in virtually identical topologies of the
major Triticeae clades as well as with respect to the
phylogenetic relationships of Th. intermedium sequences
within the Triticeae. MP analysis resulted in 1000
equally most parsimonious trees with a length of 151

steps (CI = 0.815, RI = 0.920). The results of both analyses are summarized in Figure 1. Thinopyrum intermedium sequences were placed in a clade comprising
species of the genera Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum and

revealed that Th. intermedium sequences were most
similar to Pseudoroegneria, and the sequence

Thinopyrum intermedium-2 was identical with that of
Pseudoroegneria libanotica (Hack.) D.R. Dewey. Therefore, Pseudoroegneria most probably represents the
maternal parent of all Th. intermedium accessions
analysed.
Nuclear granule-bound starch synthase I

PCR with F-for/M-bac primers yielded fragments of
about 1200 bp in all four accessions. Direct sequencing
confirmed that this primer combination amplified preferentially one gene variant. In all accessions, intra-individual polymorphism, likely representing allelic
variation, was consistently encountered at two sites. By
contrast, the F-for/K-bac primer combination amplified
heterogenous amplicons of about 650 bp. In total, 132
F/K clones were sequenced, out of which 25 were identified as recombinant and excluded (Table 2), and 18
representative sequences were used for phylogenetic
analyses (see Methods and Table 2). Four divergent
sequence types were detected in accessions Thinopyrum
intermedium-1, -2 and -4, and six in accession Thinopyrum intermedium-3 (Table 2). The sequences Thinopyrum intermedium-2d, -3c and -3f were unique within
the datasets of individual accessions, and the remaining
sequence types were encountered at least twice in each
accession (Table 2).
When indels were converted into coded characters,
the final matrix contained 743 characters with 453
invariant and 167 parsimony-informative sites. Both
phylogenetic analyses produced congruent trees as to
the placement of Th. intermedium sequences within the
Triticeae. The MP analysis resulted in 800 most parsimonious trees with a length of 641 steps (CI = 0.618, RI
= 0.747). The results are summarized in Figure 2.
Direct F/M sequences of all four accessions formed a
clade together with diploid Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski (Figure 2). F/K sequences grouped with
the following diploids: Aegilops L., Thinopyrum, Dasypyrum and Pseudoroegneria, not all accessions being
represented in every clade. Only the Dasypyrum clade
consistently comprised F/K sequences of all four accessions. The Dasypyrum clade also comprised the highest
diversity of Th. intermedium sequences, with three different sequence types: sequences Thinopyrum intermedium-1b and 4b were clearly distinguishable from
sequences 2c, 2d and 3c, and sequences 2b and 3b
formed another group. The Pseudoroegneria clade comprised sequences of only three accessions: Thinopyrum
intermedium-1, -3 and -4. Whereas sequences 3f and 4c
were most similar to P. spicataa, sequence 1d was sister
to the remainder of the Pseudoroegneria clade and likely
represented a different gene variant. Apart from the
Taeniatherum, Dasypyrum and Pseudoroegneria clades,
GBSSI sequences of Th. intermedium fell into two

Page 8 of 17

additional, moderately supported clades. Sequences 3d
and 4d grouped with Aegilops bicornis Jaub. & Spach, A.
longissima Schweinf., Muschl. & Eig, A. uniaristata Vis.,
A. comosa Sibth. & Sm. and A. tauschii Coss. and
formed a subclade of the whole Aegilops/Triticum alliance. The last clade in which Th. intermedium
sequences appeared was formed by Thinopyrum elongatum and Th. bessarabicum, and Th. intermedium-1c and
3e. Though the clade has only moderate support, Th.
elongatum/bessarabicum sequences are clearly the most
similar ones.
According to the inferred origins of the Th. intermedium F/K sequences (Table 2, Figure 2), the most frequently amplified sequence type was that of Dasypyrum
with 63 sequences out of 107, followed by Thinopyrum
(30/107), Aegilops (8/107) and Pseudoroegneria (6/107).
Interestingly, all F/K sequences of accession Thinopyrum
intermedium-2 fell into the Dasypyrum clade.
Sequence divergence and estimation of functional role of
Th. intermedium GBSSI sequences

Protein translations revealed stop codons in exon 13 in
all four F/M sequences, indicating that the Taeniatherum-like gene variants are probably non-functional. Moreover, all F/M sequences contained a 10-bp
deletion in exon 11, where the reverse K-bac primer was
designed [see [25]]. These pseudogenic sequences were
excluded from further analyses. Pairwise distances
between the representative F/K clones are tabulated
(Table 3). Two pairs of identical sequences were
encountered (Thinopyrum intermedium-1c/3e and 2b/
3b). Distances between the remaining sequences ranged
from 0.003 (sequences 1b/4b) to 0.068 (3f/4b). When
Th. intermedium sequences were analysed for Ka/Ks
ratios, a positive selection along branches leading to
Thinopyrum intermedium-4b, 3c and 4c sequences was
detected. Additionally, a positive selection along the
branch leading to the Thinopyrum intermedium-3c/2d
ancestor was detected (see Additional file 3: Summary
statistics for Ka/Ks analysis). In all other cases the Ka/
Ks ratio was < 1, suggesting that the purifying selection
prevailed among the sequences tested. Tajima’s relative
rate test could not be calculated between the two abovementioned pairs of substitutions-free sequences. The
test revealed significant rate heterogeneity at the 5%
level between the sequences Thinopyrum intermedium3f and 4c (data not shown). All other comparisons (88)
exhibited non-significant rate heterogeneity, indicating
approximate rate equivalence among the lineages.

that the chromosomes of the third subgenome are closely related to all three diploids. Proper identity of the
third subgenome therefore remains unclear. Interestingly, all chromosomes of this subgenome carried terminal translocations from P. spicata. Similarly, several
chromosomes belonging to the subgenome of D. villosum displayed signal from P. spicata in pericentromeric
and subtelomeric regions. GISH produced identical
results in all four accessions analysed.

Discussion
Thinopyrum intermedium is a grass of vast practical utility. In particular, it has been used as a source of desirable traits in wheat breeding programmes [8].
Understanding its genomic composition is therefore of
great interest. While numerous studies described the
genomic structure of this allohexaploid using cytogenetic methods, the present study provides a new insight
into the genome structure based on sequencing followed
by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). It is hypothesized that the donor of chloroplast DNA is the maternal
parent of Th. intermedium and that the different GBSSI
variants represent homoeologous copies contributed to
Th. intermedium by its putative progenitors. GISH was
used to confirm the contribution of the putative progenitors revealed by sequence data.
Maternal origin

Chloroplast trnL-F sequences indicate Pseudoroegneria
as the likeliest maternal progenitor of the four accessions of Th. intermedium analysed. The presence of
Pseudoroegneria-derived chloroplast sequences is consistent with the GBSSI data, according to which Pseudoroegneria is one of the progenitors of Th. intermedium-1,

-3, and -4. GISH further confirmed the contribution
from Pseudoroegneria to all accessions studied.
An asymmetric pattern of cytoplasmic gene flow has
been documented in other Triticeae allopolyploids.
Pseudoroegneria (St) was the maternal parent of polyploids containing the St nuclear genome in combination
with other genomes [[40] and references therein]. This
phenomenon was further documented in numerous
cases, e.g., in North American and Eurasiatic Elymus
species [25,36,38,41,42]. Recently, Zhang et al. [43]
examined the maternal origins of fourteen Kengyilia
(StYP) species and found that both Pseudoroegneria and
Agropyron (P) are the likely maternal genome donors to
the species under study, providing evidence for cpDNA
inheritance from another parent than the one containing
the St nuclear genome. If Pseudoroegneria really is the
maternal parent of Th. intermedium, then it is consistent with most Triticeae allopolyploids in which Pseudoroegneria was the maternal parent and also
contributed to the nuclear genome. The identity of
chloroplast DNA in Th. intermedium should be verified
by additional chloroplast regions.
Sequence divergence and estimation of functional role of
Th. intermedium GBSSI sequences

The primary goal of the closer inspection into the evolution of the sequences was to determine whether the
different GBSSI gene variants are functional (and possibly which). The Taeniatherum-like copies amplified
with F/M primers were most probably non-functional
pseudogenes as they contained stop codons as well as
a deletion in exon region, and thus were not analysed
further. In F/K clones, we used the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks) as an

indicator of molecular adaptation [57]. It is important
to underline here that we only worked with a portion
of the GBSSI gene, which may not necessarily reflect
the gene in its entirety. While the analysis clearly
showed that purifying selection prevailed among the
sequences tested, a positive selection has occurred too.
The relative rate test further revealed approximate rate
equivalence among all the pairs of lineages but one. It
is difficult to speculate whether the relaxation of selective constraints encountered in a portion of GBSSI
sequences is indicative of gene duplication, potential
neofunctionalization or eventual pseudogenization.

Kondrashov et al. [62] showed that both orthologous
genes and similarly diverged recent paralogs were the
subject of purifying selection; however, purifying selection acting on paralogs was substantially weaker than
purifying selection affecting unduplicated orthologs.
While a deep analysis of the GBSSI sequences could
answer some of these questions, such an analysis is far
beyond the scope of this paper and represents an
interesting topic in its own right. As constrained
sequences are supposed to be functional, we provisionally consider the majority of the F/K sequences as
representing functional gene variants.

Nuclear genome composition

Our GBSSI data indicate the contribution of distinct
lineages falling to the following present-day genera:
Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum, Taeniatherum, Aegilops
and Thinopyrum. The contribution of Aegilops and Thinopyrum is still uncertain due to only moderate support
in phylogenetic analyses. GISH clearly identified the
donors of two subgenomes: Pseudoroegneria and Dasypyrum. However, GISH did not provide a clear picture
as to the contribution from Aegilops, Thinopyrum and
Taeniatherum. Since the presence of five lineages (or
even more if we consider multiple contributions from
Dasypyrum) is not consistent with hexaploidy in Th.
intermedium, it seems that the origin of Th. intermedium is more complex than would be expected if it originated through allohexaploidy alone. So, to explain the
diversity of gene copies amplified in the Th. intermedium samples studied here (i.e., the number of potential
progenitors as well as the sequence diversity within
clades in which Th. intermedium sequences appear),
mechanisms other than allopolyploidy through recent
hybridization and/or introgression must also be
considered.
For example, the appearance of polymorphism
through ancient hybridization (many early hybridizations
must have occurred in the early Triticeae) followed by
incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphism could
lead to intra-specific variation in a diploid and, consequently, in a polyploid. Origin of North American tetraploid Elymus species is blurred by unexpected diversity
of Pseudoroegneria-like GBSSI copies, likely caused by
either ancient introgression or incomplete sorting of
ancestral polymorphism [63]. The general question is
how much of potential intra-individual polymorphism in
nuclear genes (in diploids in particular) may have been
overlooked. Only extensive sampling of Triticeae
diploids would tell how common is this phenomenon.
Gene duplication is another mechanism potentially
responsible for excessive gene diversity [28]. Thinopyrum intermedium is a species possessing a large
amount of cytogenetic polymorphism and structural
modifications of chromosomes, with not all accessions
previously studied having identical genomic structure
[20,22-24]. Therefore, duplications of some loci following allohexaploid formation followed by paralog diversification cannot be ruled out. Corresponding orthologs
and paralogs would form two clades that would be more
or less similar to one another in a phylogenetic analysis.
Since gene loss must also be taken into account, it cannot be ruled out that only paralogous sequences of an
individual homoeolog (i.e. progenitor) exist within the
Th. intermedium genome.
Furthermore, intra-individual variation in a marker
may be the result of heterozygosity. Allelic variation is

Page 12 of 17

usually irrelevant for disentangling origins of allopolyploid species. However, if allelic variation spans species
boundaries, i.e., if some alleles of a species are more closely related to alleles of another species than they are to
those of the same species [64], such a variation might
confuse the identification of the allopolyploid’s
progenitors.
Thinopyrum intermedium and Pseudoroegneria

The contribution from Pseudoroegneria to the accessions studied here is evidenced by chloroplast and
GBSSI markers as well as in situ hybridization. Pseudoroegneria-like GBSSI variants were amplified in three out
of four accessions (though the placement of sequence
Thinopyrum intermedium-1d in the Pseudoroegneria
clade is questionable due to only moderate support in
the MP analysis); between one and three Pseudoroegneria-like sequences were retrieved from the three individuals (Table 2). Such a biased proportion of amplified
Pseudoroegneria-like copies is not consistent with the
contribution of a whole Pseudoroegneria-derived genome. However, GISH clearly identified the presence of a
whole chromosome set corresponding to Pseudoroegneria in all accessions studied. Interestingly, Pseudoroegneria-like sequence variant was very rare in the three
accessions and may therefore also be present in accession 2, but maybe was not retrieved by the clones. To
achieve a good representation of individual gene variants, we performed PCR in triplicates and mixed equimolar amounts of PCR products prior to cloning.
Moreover, biased amplification due to fragment length
differences can be excluded, as all fragments amplified
with the F/K primers are of similar lengths. Thus, the
reason for such underrepresentation of Pseudoroegnerialike gene variants is yet unclear.
The presence of the Pseudoroegneria subgenome in
Th. intermedium is concordant with the literature
[6,17-19]. Liu and Wang [17] and Tang et al. [6] identified in Th. intermedium two pairs of long chromosomes
and one pair of short chromosomes, ascribing the long
sets of chromosomes to Thinopyrum and the short set
to Pseudoroegneria (St). Assadi and Runemark [18] also
suggested the presence of one genome of Th. intermedium homologous to Pseudoroegneria (St) based on
chromosome pairing in interspecific hybrids.
Thinopyrum intermedium and Dasypyrum

Phylogenetic analyses clearly placed Th. intermedium
sequences in a clade containing Dasypyrum (Figure 2),
identifying Dasypyrum as one of the progenitors. Dasypyrum-like sequences were the most frequently retrieved
sequence types overall and were amplified in all four
individuals (Table 2). Consistently, GISH identified the
presence of a Dasypyrum-like genome in all accessions
studied (Figure 3). Remarkably, if we omit unique
sequences 2d and 3c, accessions Thinopyrum

Mahelka et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:127
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/127

intermedium-1 and -4 harbour Dasypyrum-derived
sequences different from accessions -2 and -3. The presence of three different Dasypyrum-like sequence types
in the four accessions coupled with their relatively high
divergence is intriguing. For example, sequence Thinopyrum intermedium-1b differs from sequence 2c by 16
substitutions and two indels of 8 and 4 bp (K2P distance
0.029) and from sequence 3b by 24 substitutions and
two indels (0.044). For illustration, the difference
between Thinopyrum intermedium-1b and Pseudoroegneria-like sequence 4c is 32 substitutions and three
indels (0.059). Such diversity of Dasypyrum-like
sequences could have several explanations: 1) contribution from different sources close to Dasypyrum and
maintenance of the divergent copies, 2) duplication and
diversification of Dasypyrum-like sequences following
the origin of the allopolyploid, giving rise to divergent
paralogs, 3) allelic variation, and 4) a combination of 13.
It is hard to explain the first scenario, as three different lineages are one more than the number of currently
recognized Dasypyrum haplomes. However, apart from
the acknowledged existence of two allogamous Dasypyrum species, Dasypyrum villosum (diploid, haplome
V) and D. breviaristatum (Lindb. f.) Frederiksen (diploid
and autotetraploid, haplome V b - [65]), the situation
within the genus is yet to be untangled. Investigations of
the genome relationships within Dasypyrum revealed
substantial dissimilarity between the V and Vb genomes
[65-68]. Both the V and Vb genomes are so unrelated
that Uslu et al. [69] suggested a weaker relationship
between the two Dasypyrum species than of D. villosum
with Thinopyrum bessarabicum and Secale cereale. Similarly, Yang et al. [68] showed that the RAPD pattern of
D. breviaristatum was closer to Thinopyrum intermedium than to D. villosum. Since no sequence of Th.
intermedium accessions studied by us is tightly related
to present-day D. villosum in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), the possibility that D. breviaristatum or an
extinct or other unsampled Dasypyrum (or their hybrid)
are the ancestral species cannot be ruled out. Discovering potential intra-specific diversity within Dasypyrum
could therefore at least help clarify the situation as to
potential multiple contributions from Dasypyrum.
Alternatively, some of the Dasypyrum-like sequences
may represent divergent paralogs. Positive selection
along branches leading to two Dasypyrum-like
sequences (4b and 3c) was detected (Additional file 3).
There were several non-synonymous substitutions
encountered within the sequences. It is not clear, however, whether the non-synonymous substitutions are
related to any functional role. Therefore, if these
sequences really represent divergent paralogs, it is not
clear, whether they underwent non-functionalization

Page 13 of 17

(silencing by degenerative mutations), neofunctionalization (non-synonymous substitutions providing a beneficial function) or subfunctionalization (partitioning of
ancestral functions between duplicates) [70].
A contribution from Dasypyrum to Th. intermedium
was recently proposed by Kishii et al. [20], who using
multicolour GISH indicated the presence of a whole
subgenome derived from Dasypyrum. Similarly to our
results, Kishii et al. [20] observed St centromeric signal
on nine Dasypyrum-like chromosomes (see Figure 3a,b).
Similar “translocations” were observed in another allohexaploid Elymus repens, in which one pair of chromosomes of the Hordeum subgenome (H) carried a
centromeric H/St translocation. Intriguingly, both centromeres belonged to Pseudoroegneria [35]. Apparently,
chromosomal rearrangements have occurred in both
species.
Thinopyrum intermedium and Taeniatherum

The contribution from Taeniatherum to intermediate
wheatgrass is a new finding since it was never reported
before. Interestingly, an obscure contribution from Taeniatherum has been detected using GBSSI sequences in
introduced North American as well as native Central
European accessions of the closely related allohexaploid
Elymus repens [25,26,35]. It is noteworthy, according to
[25], that all the sequences of the Taeniatherum/E.
repens clade (including Taeniatherum caput-medusae
itself) were most probably non-functional pseudogenes,
suggesting that the loss of function predated the origin
of E. repens. Originally, Mason-Gamer [25] interpreted
the presence of the Taeniatherum-like GBSSI gene as a
result of introgression, but later the same author [26]
put forward another explanation for its acquisition when
she doubted the contribution of Taeniatherum per se
and suggested that Taeniatherum itself might have
acquired its GBSSI from other species. Our data on E.
repens [35] are consistent with either of these hypotheses, as we did not find any direct evidence for a recent
contribution from Taeniatherum using GISH. If the
GBSSI copy amplified in T. caput-medusae is a pseudogene, too, the question is what is the functional GBSSI
variant of Taeniatherum. There is a possibility that the
pseudogenic GBSSI variant preferentially amplifies not
only in the hexaploids Th. intermedium and E. repens
but also in diploid Taeniatherum. Hence, the functional
variant may not have yet been retrieved. We tried to
recover GBSSI using F/M primers in Taeniatherum, but
amplifications failed several times, probably due to
alteration of primer sites.
The situation in Th. intermedium seems to be paralleled by that of E. repens. The fact that the Taeniatherum-like GBSSI copies amplified in Th.
intermedium are identical with those pseudogenes
amplified in E. repens casts doubts on the possible

Mahelka et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:127
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/127

contribution of a whole subgenome from Taeniatherum.
Instead, it is more likely that Th. intermedium acquired
its Taeniatherum-like copies from another diploid progenitor, which therefore must have contained additional
GBSSI copies. Since both E. repens and Th. intermedium
share a Pseudoroegneria-like progenitor, Pseudoroegneria
is a good candidate in this case. The ease with which
Th. intermedium crosses with E. repens under field conditions in Central Europe (hence the connection of E.
repens with the present study; [44,45,71]) leads to
another hypothesis, not incompatible with the former
scenarios, according to which either species might have
obtained the Taeniatherum-like GBSSI pseudogene
from one another through introgression.
Thinopyrum intermedium and diploid Thinopyrum

Thinopyrum-like sequences were the most often
retrieved sequence types in accessions Thinopyrum
intermedium-1 and -3, and their absence in the other
two is surprising and hard to explain. Since Th. intermedium is a polymorphic species displaying structural
chromosomal rearrangements and modifications, locus
loss in accessions -2 and -4 is one possible explanation
of this phenomenon. Genomes E e and E b of Thinopyrum elongatum and Th. bessarabicum, respectively,
are further genomes whose involvement in hexaploid
Th. intermedium has most often been discussed in the
literature [6,12,14,15,17,19]. There has been a debate on
the degree of homology between Th. bessarabicum and
Th. elongatum genomes [14,72-74]. Still, no consensus
has been reached in this respect, and the treatment of
the two genomes continues to vary among authors.

intermedium has been reported based on any more
sophisticated approach.
While the identity of Pseudoroegneria- and Dasypyrum-derived subgenomes seems to be relatively
straightforward based on the combined GBSSI and
GISH data, the identity of the third subgenome remains
unresolved satisfactorily. GBSSI sequences suggest the
contribution from Thinopyrum and Aegilops to the
accessions studied, placing these two among possible
donors. Similarly, GISH with Th. elongatum, T. caputmedusae and A. tauschii probes produced overlapping
signal on one chromosome set (Figure 3a-d). Possibly,
the level of divergence among Th. elongatum, T. caputmedusae and A. tauschii is below the detection threshold of in situ hybridization in this case, making unambiguous identification of the subgenome impossible. If
we set aside contribution from Taeniatherum (discussed
above), the most parsimonious explanation of the origin
of the third subgenome is its hybridogenous origin. Possibly, the progenitor was an ancient hybrid or introgressant between species close to Aegilops and Thinopyrum.
Such an ancient origin of Th. intermedium (or at least
of some of its subgenomes) could then also explain why
some of the GBSSI copies did not group tightly with its
presumed progenitors in phylogenetic analyses. This
may indicate that some of the ancestors no longer exist
or that the allopolyploidization happened so long ago
that the genes within Th. intermedium have already
diverged.

Thinopyrum intermedium and Aegilops

Interspecific hybridization of Th. intermedium and its
implications

As the clade consisting of Th. intermedium sequences
plus five Aegilops species is supported only moderately
(Figure 2), the statement that Th. intermedium contains
genetic material derived from Aegilops must be considered as provisional. Remarkably, neither Triticum/Aegilops clades in GBSSI-based phylogenies presented
elsewhere [e.g., [25,26,75]] form tight, strongly supported groups, which is likely caused by the fact that
neither Triticum, Aegilops nor Triticum + Aegilops are
monophyletic [27]. Early investigations [9-11] advanced
the hypothesis that Th. intermedium has at least one
genome homologous with one of the Triticum genomes.
Since Triticum aestivum L. is an allohexaploid constituting of one Triticum genome and two different genomes
derived from Aegilops [27], it is possible that it was one
of Aegilops which represented the homologous genome.
As noted before, however, early works, in which chromosome pairing data (at high ploidy levels in particular)
were used as exclusive evidence for or a measure of
genomic relationships, must be interpreted with a great
deal of caution. Up to now, the presence of neither Triticum nor Aegilops within the genome of Th.

Thinopyrum intermedium is able to hybridize with
wheat, whereby it has been utilized as an alien genetic
resource in wheat breeding programmes. In terms of
cross-compatibility, the presence of genetic material
from within the Triticum/Aegilops alliance in Th. intermedium germplasm is therefore not unlikely. Hence, the
possibility that Th. intermedium acquired its Aegilopslike GBSSI copies through introgression from wheat at
the hexaploid level cannot be ruled out. The crossability,
expressed as a quantity of F1 seeds, reached up to 62.5%
of all pollinated florets in crossing experiments, and
backcrosses were achieved [76-79]. An important fact
stemming from the crosses between wheat and Th.
intermedium is that their crossability highly depends on
particular cultivars or strains of both wheat and Thinopyrum parents. In this respect, hybridization under natural conditions seems to be even more likely because
the chance of meeting a compatible sexual counterpart
is increased on one side by the great genetic variability
within wild populations of perennial Th. intermedium
and by fluctuating environmental conditions on the
other. Natural hybridization between wheat and its wild

Mahelka et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:127
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/127

relatives (i.e., Aegilops) does take place [80], and Th.
intermedium represents another potentially interesting
case of gene flow between a crop and its wild relative
that might considerably influence the assessment of
risks associated with genetically modified wheat. Hybridization and potential introgression between Th. intermedium and wild relatives could also have significantly
enriched the species’ gene pool [45,81].

Conclusions
Alongside other reticulation phenomena, interspecific
hybridization has played a key role in the evolution of
the Triticeae, resulting in strong ecological, morphological and genetic similarities among many Triticeae taxa
[14,16,82], notably with distinct gene lineages occurring
within some polyploid as well as diploid species [83].
Genomes are not discrete units but form a continuum
from homology to lack of homology. It is therefore
sometimes difficult to reliably identify all potential progenitors of polyploid species. Our genome analysis of
allohexaploid intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum
intermedium) using chloroplast trnL-F and partial
nuclear GBSSI sequences followed by GISH confirmed
the allopolyploid origin of the species and revealed new
aspects in its genomic composition. The data suggested
the contribution of distinct lineages falling into five present-day genera: Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum, Taeniatherum, Aegilops and Thinopyrum. Our results, based
on four accessions originating from a small geographic
region, showed that the genomic heterogeneity of intermediate wheatgrass exists and is higher than has been
previously assumed. Thinopyrum intermedium is a perennial, out-pollinating grass that is able to hybridize
with several other Triticeae grasses including wheat.
Transfer of genetic material via extensive hybridization
and introgression of Th. intermedium with other grasses
could have significantly enriched the species’ gene pool.
Therefore, potential geographical diversity of the species
due to, for example, multiple origin and locally-specific
hybridizations, can be expected. In this respect, further
research should focus on elucidating the genomic composition of Th. intermedium across a larger geographic
area in context with its ecological adaptation to diverse
habitat types. Resolving the genome structure of intermediate wheatgrass is of concern to wheat breeders in
particular, who often use it as a source of desirable traits
in wheat breeding programmes.
