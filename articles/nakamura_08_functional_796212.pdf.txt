Abstract
Background: K+ channels are diverse; both in terms of their function and their molecular
composition. Shal subunits were first described in Drosophila. There are three mammalian
orthologs, which are members of the Kv4 subfamily. They are involved in neuronal firing patterns
as well as control of the cardiac action potential duration.
Results: Here, we report the biophysical and pharmacological characterization of zShal3, which is
the ortholog of the mammalian Kv4.3 subunit, which in mammals is involved in action potential
repolarization and gives rise to neuronal A-type K+ currents involved in somatodendretic signal
integration.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that zShal has similar functional and pharmacological characteristics
compared to Kv4.3 and it is similarly regulated by pharmacological agents and by the Kv4 accessory
subunit, NCS-1.

Background
Danio rerio is one of the few model organisms used to
examine developmental regulation of vertebrate biological processes. Much has been leaned regarding transcriptional control of organogenesis, including development
and growth of the heart [1] and brain [2]. Although the
zebrafish is often used to study vertebrate development,
random mutagenesis screens have identified several
important genes involved in physiology and behavior.
The importance of ion channels is exemplified by mutants
such as the slow mo mutant, which disrupts the heart rate
due to changes in the pacemaker current (Ih) [3]. Another
mutation in zebrafish, the lethal island beat (isl), disrupts
the α1C L-type Ca2+ channel subunit, which regulate heart
growth independently of effects on contractions [4]. The
role of ion transporters and Ca2+ homeostasis is further

emphasized by the arrhythmias observed in tre embryos,
which have a mutation of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger [5]. The
zebrafish may be an appropriate model for studying
human inherited arrhythmias, for example in a recent
study defining mutations of a delayed rectifier K+ current
in contributing to long QT syndrome [6]. Although the
description and function of ion channels in zebrafish systems biology is beginning to emerge [7-11], little is
known about the expression and functional characteristics
of most zebrafish ion channels.
In Drosophila, Shaker was the first type of K+ channel to be
described [12]. This was soon followed by homology
cloning of Shab, Shaw and Shal [13]. Many more voltageactivated K+ channels have since been described in mammals [14], but the corresponding preferential mammalian

nomenclature for these first four are Kv1, Kv2, Kv3 and
Kv4 [15], with several members in each of these subfamilies. The Kv4 subfamily contains three members;
Kv4.1, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 [16]. The Kv4.x K+ channels are
expressed in a variety of tissue, with particularly high levels in the brain and heart. The Kv4 subunits form functional channels, with very similar biophysical and
pharmacological properties, that are responsible for transient, voltage-dependent K+ currents in the nervous system
(A currents) in the neuronal system. These somatodendritic subthreshold A-type K+ current in nerve cells contribute significantly to determine somatodendritic signal
integration. The corresponding K+ current in the heart is
called the transient outward K+ current (Ito), which contributes to action potential repolarization [17].
Shal-type K+ channel subunits are highly conserved evolutionary and are present even in primitive metazoans such
as the jellyfish [18]. We show using sequence and phylogenetic analysis that orthologs of all three mammalian
Kv4 subfamily members exist in Danio rerio. We collectively named these subunits zShals, in keeping with the
nomenclature where "Kv" is reserved for mammalian subunits [15]. We also describe the biophysical and pharmacological properties of zShal3 (the ortholog of the
mammalian Kv4.3), as well as its regulation by the Kv4
accessory subunit, NCS-1. Characterization of channel
function and distribution is an important first step in
understanding that the physiological role of ion channels
in this model animal system.

Methods
Electrophysiological measurements in oocytes
Stage V-VI oocytes were prepared from Xenopus laevis and
50 nl of in vitro transcribed cRNA (0.1–18 ng) were
injected using a 10 μl micropipette (Drummond Scientific
Co, Broomall, PA). Two to three days after the injection,
oocytes were voltage-clamped using the standard twoelectrode voltage-clamp technique as described previously
[19]. Recordings were obtained using a Geneclamp 500
amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) with data sampled at 5
kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Currents were elicited by depolarizing steps from -100 to +60 mV in 10 mV increments
every 15 s from a holding potential of -120 mV (to allow
full recovery from inactivation). The recording chamber
was continually perfused (1 ml/min). To avoid contamination with Ca2+-activated Cl- currents, a low Cl- recording
solution containing in (mM) Na-glutamate 96, K-glutamate 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5 (pH 7.5 adjusted
with NaOH) was used. All experiments were performed at
room temperature (20 ± 2°C).

Data analysis
Data were analyzed using the pClamp suite of software
(Axon Instruments) and Origin for Windows (Microcal
Software). Leak subtraction was not performed.
Inactivation parameters
the time constants of inactivation were obtained by fitting
the current traces to a sum of two exponential functions.
Recovery from inactivation
A double pulse protocol was used to access the time
course of recovery from inactivation. Two depolarizing
pulses to +20 mV were separated by intervals of increasing
duration (from 20 to 460 ms in 40 ms increments) at -120
mV. The peak current amplitude during the test pulse (I)
was normalized to that recorded during the first pulse (Io)

and plotted as a function of the inter-pulse duration.
Curve fitting of the data points was performed to
I
Io

−t

= I max + A ⋅ e t , where Imax is the maximum current

during the recovery time (not restrained to 1). A and τ are
the relative amplitude and time constant respectively.
Steady-state inactivation
A pre-pulse voltage protocol was used. The membrane was
held at voltages ranging between -150 mV and -10 mV for
a period of 10 seconds (to obtain the complete steadystate inactivation) followed by a 1 s test pulse to +20 mV,
during which peak current amplitude (I) was measured.
Data were normalized to the peak current amplitude following a pre-pulse at -150 mV (I0), and plotted as a func-

tion of pre-pulse potential. The line through the data
represents the best nonlinear least-squares fit to a Boltzmann function, II =

, where Vh is the volt-

age where half-maximal inactivation was observed and k
is the slope factor.
Normalized conductance-voltage curve
Conductance (G) was calculated with the following equation: G = Ipeak/(E-EK), where Ipeak is the peak current amplitude, E is the test potential and EK is the equilibrium
potential for K+ (calculated to be -99 mV under our experimental conditions). The conductance (G) was normalized to the maximal conductance at +60 mV (Gmax) and
plotted as a function of the test potential.
Statistics
Comparisons between two groups were performed using
the Student's t-test or the Rank Sum test. To test for overall

significance when using more than two groups, we used
the 1 way-ANOVA or, when tests for normality failed, the
non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test (Sigma Stat, Jandel
Scientific). If the overall significance was obtained, multiple comparisons were performed to a control group
respectively using the Dunnet's t-test or Dunn's test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Identification of zShal3
Homology searches of the zebrafish EST databases [20]
revealed an entry (fj34e05) with sequence similarity with
the mammalian Shal-related subunit, Kv4.3. We tentatively named this subunit zShal3. We obtained the cDNA
and sequencing revealed the full-length zShal3 coding
region, in addition to some 5'- and 3'- untranslated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/2

regions (the nucleotide sequence of zShal3 was recently
deposited in GenBan, NM_199802). The coding region is
located on chromosome 24 [Ensembl entry
AL929168.3.2001-50304, genomic location 8886207 to
8887319 (-)]. When translated, the amino-acid sequence
of zShal3 is very similar to the mammalian Kv4's. The
sequence identity is respectively 77%, 73% and 65% with
human Kv4.3, Kv4.2 and Kv 4.1 subunits (Fig 1). Most
divergence occurs in the intracellular N- and C-termini.
Important structural features of the mammalian Kv4 subunits are conserved, including a six-transmembrane
topology, a T1 domain and a K+ channel signature
sequence. zShal3 also bears several putative consensus
sequences for phosphorylation by PKC, as well as a single
consensus sequence each for PKA and tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig 1).

domain of voltage-gated K+ channels encodes molecular determinants for subfamily-specific assembly of alpha-subunits into
functional tetrameric channels. This domain is present between amino acids 42 to 131 of zShal3 (IILNVS ... PEIISDC). zShal3
also contains the K+ channel signature sequence, which is a highly conserved stretch of amino acids (G- [YF]-G.-D) in the Pregion. B: Phylogenetic tree comparing zShals with representative mammalian Kv channel subunits. The mammalian (all human)

bootstrapping and tree generation was performed using ClustalW.

zShal3 corresponds to the short splice variant of mammalian Kv4.3. The long splice variant contains the sequence
GLSYLVDDPLLSVRTSTIK within the intracellular C-terminus. We did not identify a genomic region on this
zebrafish chromosome that translates to a similar
sequence and it is unclear at this point whether zebrafish
also generates two zShal3 splice variants.

two-electrode voltage clamp currents resembled those of
Kv4.3-injected oocytes. Upon depolarization zShal3 currents activated rapidly and inactivated with maintained
depolarization (Fig 2). The inactivation time course is
similar to that of mammalian Kv4.3 The time constants of
fast and slow inactivation at +60 mV for zShal3 and Kv4.3
were, τfast = 46.7 ± 0.2 ms (85.7% of contribution) and
45.6 ± 0.11 ms (86.3% of contribution), τslow = 256 ± 2.1
ms and 258 ± 1.3 ms, respectively (n = 6 for each group, P

steady-state inactivation is achieved is -69 ± 0.7 mV.
Recovery from inactivation was determined using a twostep voltage protocol and the time constant was 81 ms at
-120 mV.
Pharmacological blockade of zShal3 currents
Kv4 currents are typically blocked by compounds such as
4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and flecainide [21-23]. A comparison of effects of these compounds on Kv4.3 and
zShal3 is shown in Fig 3. Both currents were effectively
blocked by high 4-AP concentrations (10 mM in this
example). At low concentrations (50 μM), 4-AP does not
block Kv4 currents (not shown). Flecainide (30 μM) also
effectively blocked both Kv4.3 and zShal3 currents. These
data demonstrate that structural elements required for
channel block by these compounds are conserved
between mammals and fish. In Xenopus oocytes, we previously showed that Kv4.3 currents are time-dependently
blocked by phorbol esters [19]. Activating PKC with PMA
(10 nM) led to a similar progressive inhibition of zShal
currents (Fig 3C). Interestingly, before inhibition
occurred, we consistently saw a slight activation of zShal
currents. This was also often observed with mammalian
Kv4s (not shown).
Modification of zShal3 by accessory subunits
In mammalian heterologous expression systems and in
Xenopus oocytes, Kv4 current amplitudes are increased by
co-expression with the accessory proteins, KChIPs and
NCS-1. These accessory subunits additionally slow the
inactivation time course [24-26]. We examined the effects
of NCS-1 (also called frequenin) on zShal3 currents. As
with Kv4 currents, zShal3 currents were enhanced in
oocytes co-injected with NCS-1 cRNA (Fig 4A &4B). The
peak zShal3 currents with and without NCS-1 were 11.0 ±
2.6 and 5.1 ± 0.8 μA at +50 mV, respectively, (Fig 4A &4B).
The increase in zShal3 currents occurred at all test potentials examined without a significant shift in voltage
dependence of activation as shown in the normalized
conductance-voltage relationships (Fig. 4C & inset). NCS1 also slowed the time course of zShal3 inactivation (Fig
4D). The time constants of fast and slow inactivation at
+60 mV for zShal3 currents with and without NCS-1 were
τfast = 105 ± 2.0 ms (60.3% of contribution) and 38.7 ± 0.2
ms (89.7% of contribution), τslow = 377 ± 12 ms and 243
± 3.6 ms, respectively (n = 8 for each group, P < 0.05). As
observed for Kv4 channels [25], there was no effect on the
voltage-dependence of inactivation. The voltage at which
half-maximal steady-state inactivation occurred (V1/2)
were -69.1 ± 0.7 mV and -68.4 ± 1.1 mV for zShal3 and
zShal3/NCS-1 currents, respectively and the slope factors
(k) were 7.9 ± 0.6 and 9.8 ± 1.0 respectively; n = 8 for each
experiment; Fig 4E). A small but significant acceleration of
recovery from inactivation was induced by NCS-1 (time

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/2

constants of recovery from inactivation (τ) were 45.7 ms
and 81.4 ms with and without NCS-1 respectively; Fig 4F).

Discussion
Comparison with mammalian Kv4 subunits
We identified a zebrafish homolog of the mammalian
Kv4.3 subunit, which we named zShal3. It has a high
degree of sequence similarity (65–77% identity) with
members of the Kv4 subfamily. Within the transmembrane domains (S1 to S6) and pore region the sequence
similarity is much higher (>90%), suggesting evolutionary conservation of these regions responsible for channel
function. The three mammalian Kv4 subunits differ from
each other in defined regions of the intracellular N- and Ctermini. It is interesting that most of the sequence divergence between zShal3 and Kv4's also occur in these
regions, suggestive of subunit-specific roles of these divergent regions.
Biophysical and pharmacological properties of zShal3
zShal3 behaved in most respects identically to mammalian Kv4.3 channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
The "threshold" voltage for activation is around -70 mV,
which is similar to Kv4.3 when expressed in Xenopus
oocytes [27]. This is not entirely surprising given the
sequence similarity on the core region (S1 to S6) of the
polypeptides. Once activated, zShal3 inactivates at rates
similar to Kv4.3. The molecular mechanisms involved in
Kv4 inactivation are not well understood, but classic Ntype ("ball and chain") or C-type (pore-collapse) inactivation may not occur. There may be a concerted interaction
between the intracellular N- and C-termini in causing
Kv4.1 inactivation [28] and it is likely that a similar mechanism may operate to cause zShal3 inactivation. The similarities in voltage-dependence of inactivation and rates of
recovery from inactivation further support the notion of
evolutionary conserved inactivation mechanisms. The
zShal subunit may be useful in further elucidating Kv4
inactivation, which is thought to occur predominantly
from a pre-open closed state [29]. Pharmacologically,
both zShal3 and Kv4.3 are blocked by 4-AP and flecainide. There is evidence that the 4-AP binding site is on the
cytoplasmic surface of the Kv4.2 channel at, or adjacent
to, the domains involved in channel inactivation [21,29].
Flecainide sensitivity, in contrast, is mediated by a single
residue in the S6 transmembrane domain of voltage-gated
potassium channels [30]. This residue is L392 in the case
of Kv4.2, which is conserved in zShal3 (and also in the
other two zShals; see later). Because of this sequence conservation, it is likely that these compounds may also block
zShal3 currents by interaction with these homologous residues. Furthermore, as observed for Kv4.3 current [19],
zShal3 current was also largely modulated by PKC activation, suggesting that a similar functional role for signal

transduction-mediated modulation of A-type current may
exist in zebrafish.
Modulation of zShal3 by accessory subunits
KChIPs and NCS-1 (frequenin) strongly modulate Kv4
currents by increasing their expression levels and slowing
their inactivation [24-26]. Since NCS-1 may be the evolutionary ancestor of the Ca2+-binding protein family[31],
we examined the effect of NCS-1 and found this Kv4
accessory protein to affect zShal3 in an identical manner.
KChIPs (and likely also NCS-1) bind to Kv4 subunits by
interacting with specific residues. A major interaction site
for KChIPs binding within Kv4.2 lies within the N-terminus – particularly with the proximal N-terminal region
[24,32,33]. The absolute conservation of residues and
domains involved in interaction, despite divergence in
other parts of the N-terminus, suggests an evolutionary
conserved mechanism of modulation of Shal (Kv4) subunits by accessory subunits, which predates the vertebrate
evolutionary branching point of mammals and fish.
Indeed, inspection of zebrafish genome suggests
orthologs of at least some of the KChIPs (zKChIPs, Genbank entries AAH96914, XP_687972 and XP_694748), as
well as a NCS-1 ortholog (AAO34710). It remains to be
seen whether these zKChIPs or zNCS-1 will have any
influence on zShal currents.
Other Shal-related family members in zebrafish
There are three members in the mammalian Kv4 subfamily (Kv4.1, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3). Similarity searches of
the zebrafish genome revealed homologs for each of these
mammalian Kv4 subunits. The putative subunits zShal1,
zShal2 and zShal3 are respectively located on zebrafish
chromosomes 19 (Ensembl ID: ENSDART00000009506),
4
(ENSDART00000042673)
and
24
(Zv5_scaffold1202.6) and correspond to Kv4.1, Kv4.2
and Kv4.3. The sequence similarity between zShals and
Kv4's are greater than observed with other mammalian Kv
subunits (Fig 1). Given this high degree of sequence similarity, as well as the similarities in the functional and
pharmacological properties between zShal3 and mammalian Kv4's (this study), it is expected that these additional
zShal members will have biophysical and pharmacological properties resembling their mammalian orthologs.
However, this prediction (as well as their relative tissuedistributions) still needs to be examined.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/2

expect these channels to have similar functions in the fish
as they do in the mammal. Known functions of Kv4 subunits in mammals include a role in somatodendritic subthreshold A-type K+ currents, which operate in the
subthreshold range of membrane potentials [16] and may
be involved in determining the properties of dendritic,
backpropagating action potentials and long-term potentiation [34]. Preliminary whole-mount in-situ hybridization experiments suggest that zShal3 may be expressed in
neural tissues of Zebrafish embryos (data not shown).
Depending on the protein distribution and dentritic localization of zShals, they may have similar functions. If any
of the zShals (see above) are expressed in the Zebrafish
heart, then by analogy with the mammalian heart, one
would expect these subunits to give rise to a 'transient outward K+ current', which helps to determine action potential shape and cardiac contractile properties [35]. The
regulation of zShals by accessory proteins such as NCS-1
(or possibly by KChIP orthologs) also suggests a similarity
in how these channels are regulated in-vivo.

Conclusion
We identified a member of the Shal subfamily of K+ channel subunits in Zebrafish and named it zShal3, since it
appears to be the ortholog of the mammalian Kv4.3 subunit. We report the biophysical and pharmacological
characterization of zShal3. We demonstrate that zShal has
similar functional and pharmacological characteristics
compared to Kv4.3 and it is similarly regulated by pharmacological agents and by the Kv4 accessory subunit,
NCS-1.
