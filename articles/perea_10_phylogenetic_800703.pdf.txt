Abstract
Background: Leuciscinae is a subfamily belonging to the Cyprinidae fish family that is widely distributed in
Circum-Mediterranean region. Many efforts have been carried out to deciphering the evolutionary history of this
group. Thus, different biogeographical scenarios have tried to explain the colonization of Europe and
Mediterranean area by cyprinids, such as the “north dispersal” or the “Lago Mare dispersal” models. Most recently,
Pleistocene glaciations influenced the distribution of leuciscins, especially in North and Central Europe. Weighing
up these biogeographical scenarios, this paper constitutes not only the first attempt at deciphering the
mitochondrial and nuclear relationships of Mediterranean leuciscins but also a test of biogeographical hypotheses
that could have determined the current distribution of Circum-Mediterranean leuciscins.
Results: A total of 4439 characters (mitochondrial + nuclear) from 321 individuals of 176 leuciscine species
rendered a well-supported phylogeny, showing fourteen main lineages. Analyses of independent mitochondrial
and nuclear markers supported the same main lineages, but basal relationships were not concordant. Moreover,
some incongruence was found among independent mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. The monophyly of
some poorly known genera such as Pseudophoxinus and Petroleuciscus was rejected. Representatives of both
genera belong to different evolutionary lineages. Timing of cladogenetic events among the main leuciscine
lineages was gained using mitochondrial and all genes data set.
Conclusions: Adaptations to a predatory lifestyle or miniaturization have superimposed the morphology of some
species. These species have been separated into different genera, which are not supported by a phylogenetic
framework. Such is the case of the genera Pseudophoxinus and Petroleuciscus, which real taxonomy is not well
known. The diversification of leuciscine lineages has been determined by intense vicariant events following the
paleoclimatological and hydrogeological history of Mediterranean region. We propose different colonization
models of Mediterranean region during the early Oligocene. Later vicariance events promoted Leuciscinae
diversification during Oligocene and Miocene periods. Our data corroborate the presence of leuciscins in North
Africa before the Messinian salinity crisis. Indeed, Messinian period appears as a stage of gradually Leuciscinae
diversification. The rise of humidity at the beginning of the Pliocene promoted the colonization and posterior
isolation of newly established freshwater populations. Finally, Pleistocene glaciations determined the current
European distribution of some leuciscine species.

Background
Mediterranean freshwater fish fauna is characterized by
a relatively low number of fish families, with most of
the species belonging to Cyprinidae [1,2]. In effect, this
family is among the most speciose families of freshwater
fishes and likely to be one of the largest vertebrate
families [3]. The family Cyprinidae also features a relatively high number of endemic species on the Mediterranean slope [2] and its wide biological and ecological
plasticity has bestowed this group an important role in
biogeographical models [4-7]. As dispersion mechanisms
are highly restricted in primary freshwater fishes [8],
their distributions are directly related to paleogeography
and relationships among different areas [9-11]. Thus,
phylogenetic relationships among evolutionary lineages
reflect the history of cyprinids within the Mediterranean
region.
The classification of cyprinids has always been a matter of controversy and from 2 to 12 subfamilies have
been recognized depending on author and the morphological traits considered [12-15] and even have been
recently elevated to family level, being assigned European and North American leuciscins and phoxinins to
the new called family Leuciscidae [16,17]. Traditional
morphology, however, sometimes conflicts with the
more recent molecular studies [5,18-23] because some
morphological characters are prone to homoplasy [5]
and usually there is unclear homology of morphological
traits [24,25]. This determines that recognized monophyletic groups are clearly misinterpreted. In this paper,
we followed the classification scheme of Saitoh et al.
[22] based on complete mitochondrial genomes. These
authors consider the subfamily Leuciscinae exclusively
formed by the Eurasian and North African leuciscins
(including the North American genus Notemigonus, as
the only known representative in this region) and promote phoxinins [15] to their own subfamily, Phoxininae,
as the sister group of the subfamily Leuciscinae. To
date, however, the nuclear phylogenetic relationships of
cyprinids, and particularly leuciscins, have been little
explored [26,27].
The fossil record of Cyprinidae family in Eurasia [28-30]
suggests its origin in East and Southeast Asia, where greatest generic and species diversity is found [1,3,31]. This
group then colonized Europe for the first time during the
Oligocene period when the Ob Sea disappeared because of
the uplifting of the Urals, and reached the Iberian Peninsula (the westernmost part of Europe) in the late Oligocene-early Miocene [32]. The colonization of North Africa
has been explained by connections with Iberian and Asian
fish faunas during Cenozoic period [33]. Within the family
Cyprinidae, the subfamily Leuciscinae may be used to test
biogeographical hypotheses for the Mediterranean basin.

In addition, owing to its long-standing distribution range
in the Circum-Mediterranean area it should be possible to
unravel the evolutionary history of this group.
Traditional hypotheses have proposed the origin of the
subfamily Leuciscinae in the Mediterranean area and its
subsequent diversification through river captures from
central Europe as several waves stretched across a long
time period (from the Oligocene until late Pliocene, 351.7 mya) [34,35], following the hydrogeographical and
geological history of the European area [36]. This model
has been designated as the “north dispersal model” [37].
Hypotheses opposing this model have argued that the
colonization of Circum-Mediterranean rivers cannot be
explained by a northern route. The alternative model
proposed is based on leuciscine dispersion during the
lacustrine stage of the Mediterranean basin [38], when
this sea became refilled with fresh water from Paratethys
Sea during the Messinian salinity crisis [39]. This would
have allowed Paratethyan freshwater icthyofauna to
colonize the Mediterranean margins. This hypothesis is
described as the “Lago Mare” dispersal model [38]. The
later opening of the Straits of Gibraltar [40] filled the
Mediterranean area with marine water, with the subsequent isolation of the new-formed freshwater populations along with intense vicariant events [41,42].
However, the Lago Mare and north dispersal hypotheses
are not mutually exclusive and together could have
played an important role on dispersal of cyprinids across
Europe [1,11,43]. On the other hand, the Middle East
has been considered an important interchange area for
freshwater ichthyofauna during the gradual closing of
the Tethys Sea [6,44,45]. It is in fact held by some
authors that the Middle Eastern freshwater fauna is
made up of species that came from Asia and more
recently from Euromediterranean ancestors [6,45,46].
The basis for this latter proposal is the close affinity
found between Middle Eastern and Euromediterranean
cyprinids [6,47]. This region has been also recognized as
a center of origin for some Leuciscinae species [6,11,48].
Most recently, Pleistocene glaciations influenced the
distribution of Leuciscinae representatives, especially in
North and Central Europe, where some species became
locally extinct when the region was covered by ice
[35,49]. Later recolonization from eastern refuges such
as Circum-Black Sea drainages has been suggested to
explain the wide distribution of some extant cyprinid
species [11,50,51]. Although the Mediterranean Peninsulas and Caspian/Caucasus region are known to have
acted as glacial refuges [52,53], the Iberian, Italian and
Balkan Peninsulas were isolated from northern and central Europe because of the Alps uplift during the Pleistocene thus preventing most Mediterranean freshwater
species moving northwards. This interpretation explains

the low level of shared freshwater species between
north-central and southern Europe.
Weighing up all biogeographical scenarios, some models have attempted to explain the center of origin and
the main dispersion routes for cyprinids [1,6,11,34-36,
47,48,54,1], while others have tried to identify barriers
to explain the vicariant patterns observed in cyprinid
fishes [4,5,14,25,32,33,37,43,55]. Despite these efforts,
the phylogenetic relationships of Circum-Mediterranean
leuciscins and their biogeographical patterns in Mediterranean area remain unclear.
To obtain reliable information on the mitochondrial
phylogenetic structure of this group, the comprehensive
study examines mitochondrial DNA in numerous species of the subfamily Leuciscinae. Indeed, sequences of
the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene have achieved phylogenetic resolution in some fish groups [56,57], including
cyprinids [4-7,11,18,20,37,43,48,58]. In turn the cytochrome oxidase I (COxI) gene has also proved to be a
useful tool for the identification of fish species [59,60].
Here we complete the mitochondrial phylogeny of the
subfamily Leuciscinae using nuclear information by analyzing the Recombination Activating Gene 1 (RAG-1)
and the Ribosomal Protein Gene S7 (S7). Only a few
previous molecular studies on cyprinids have yielded a
nuclear phylogeny of Circum-Mediterranean representatives of the subfamily Leuciscinae. Some leuciscine
groups have been examined using nuclear allozymes
[10,61,62] or DNA sequences [63-65] approaches and
some phylogenetic relationships have been proposed for
cyprinids [66]. However, this paper constitutes the first
attempt at deciphering the nuclear relationships of the
main Mediterranean Leuciscinae lineages based on
sequences data.
The aim of this exhaustive study was to investigate
phylogenetic relationships among the major CircumMediterranean Leuciscinae lineages by analyzing
sequence variation of both mitochondrial (cyt b and
COxI) and nuclear (RAG-1 and S7) genes. Data were
obtaining for 321 individuals representing 176 species of
the subfamily Leuciscinae and 9 outgroup species. The
data were used to test for biogeographical events that
could have determined the distribution of leuciscins in
Mediterranean area.

Results
Leuciscinae phylogenetic performance

Out of a total of 4439 characters obtained, 1786bp corresponded to mitochondrial DNA and 2653bp to
nuclear DNA. Table 1 compares the phylogenetic performance of the individual genes under the taxon sampling in phylogenetic analyses. ML parameters estimated
using Modeltest v3.7 [67] are provided in Table 2. The
c 2 test for base homogeneity indicated that base frequency distributions were always homogenous among
taxa. The nuclear genes showed much higher consistency (CI) and retention (RI) indices, while the mitochondrial genes offered more parsimony informative
(PI) sites. Indeed, the proportion of informative sites
showed by cyt b gene was the highest (Table 1).
Mitochondrial phylogenetic relationships

All mitochondrial analyses generated almost identical
and well-supported topologies. Our discussion therefore
focuses on the more resolved Bayesian tree and the
results of the Maximum likelihood (ML) and Maximum
Parsimony (MP) analyses are summarized. Bayesian analysis [68,69] has been empirically demonstrated to be
the most efficient character-based method for accurately
reconstructing a phylogeny [70].
According to our molecular mitochondrial cyt b data,
the subfamily Leuciscinae comprises fourteen major
monophyletic lineages. All lineages were supported by
high posterior probability and bootstrap values (Figure 1).
Lineage I was formed by the monotypic North American genus Notemigonus (N. crysoleucas). Lineage II comprised the widespread genus Alburnus, the monotypic
genera Leucaspius and Anaecypris and the North African species Pseudophoxinus punicus. Although L. delineatus appeared as more related with P. punicus, this
relationship was not highly supported (Figure 2). Lineage III was formed by the genus Scardinius. Lineage IV
comprised the two species of the Greek genus Tropidophoxinellus and the two North African species Pseudophoxinus chaignoni and P. callensis. Lineage V included
the genera Squalius, Ladigesocypris (L. ghigii and L. irideus) and two species of Petroleuciscus (P. borysthenicus
and P. smyrnaeus) (Figure 3). The genus Squalius was
subdivided into two well-differentiated clades. The

“S. cephalus species group” clade, which was in turn
structured into two subclades: the first subclade
included central European and Mediterranean species
while the second subclade consisted of Anatolian and
Caucasian species. The second large Squalius clade was
structured into three subclades: the Iberian subclade,
the Adriatic subclade and the Greece subclade formed
by the species S. keadicus. Ladigesocypris were nested
into the Squalius clade and Petroleuciscus were positioned basal to all species of Squalius. Lineage VI was
comprised of the former genus Chondrostoma s.l., which
has been recently subdivided into six genera [64]:
Achondrostoma, Chondrostoma, Iberochondrostoma,
Parachondrostoma, Protochondrostoma and Pseudochondrostoma. The genera Phoxinellus, Telestes and the Anatolian representatives of the genus Pseudophoxinus also
clustered in this lineage (Figure 4). Phoxinellus and
Chondrostoma s.l., together represented the sister group
of Telestes and the Anatolian Pseudophoxinus. The Anatolian Pseudophoxinus species were represented by two
monophyletic and well-differenciated clades: one of
them including the species P. alii, P. anatolicus, P. antalyae, P. battalgilae, P. crassus, P. elizevetae, P. evliyae, P.
fahretinne, P. ninae and one possibly undescribed species. The second one was formed by P. firati, P. kervillei,
P. zekayi and P. zeregi. Lineage VII constituted the
genus Rutilus and lineage VIII contained the genera
Abramis, Acanthobrama, Acanthalburnus, Ballerus,
Blicca, Mirogrex and Vimba, together with the Iranian
species Petroleuciscus persidis. Lineage IX was exclusively represented by the genus Alburnoides. Lineage X
was composed by the genera Aspius and Leuciscus. Lineage XI was comprised only by the species Pseudophoxinus egridiri. Lineage XII was formed by the genus
Pachychilon. Lineage XIII comprised the genera Pelasgus
and Delminichthys. Finally lineage XIV was formed by
the monotypic genus Pelecus, which was the first lineage
to split.
The cytochrome oxidase I gene (COxI) rendered the
same main lineages as cytochrome b but also detected a

deep politomy among all lineages (Figure 5). Thus,
excluded Pelecus basal to the remaining leuciscine
lineages with regarding to the phylogenetic relationships
between different lineages, deep relationships between
them were not well solved with mitochondrial markers.
Moreover, some incongruence was found among cyt b
and COxI topologies, such as Pseudophoxinus punicus,
which was more related with P. callensis than with the
Alburninae group, as well as Pachychilon, which was
closer to Alburnoides lineage than to Pelasgus-Delminichthys and Pseudophoxinus egridiri lineages. On the
other hand, the Lineages II (Alburnus, Anaecypris, Leucaspius and Pseudophoxinus punicus), III (Scardinius)
and IV (Pseudophoxinus callensis, P. chaignoni, Tropidophoxinellus) were clustered together and highly support
with cytochrome b, but were unrelated with COxI gene.
Nuclear phylogenetic relationships

Although the number of species is lesser in nuclear analyses than in mitochondrial one, the topologies of both
mitochondrial and combined nuclear genes (RAG1 +
S7) support the identical major lineages. However, deep
relationships among lineages were not solved with
nuclear markers (Figure 6). Even within some lineages
as number VI (Chondrostoma s.l., Telestes and Anatolian
Pseudophoxinus) basal relationships were not solved. As
occurred in COxI topology, the lineages II, III and IV
were unrelated with nuclear genes. Moreover, some
incongruence was found between mitochondrial and
nuclear data. Such is the case of Pachychilon, which was
not related with Pelasgus-Delminichtys-Pseudophoxinus
egridiri. In turn, P. egridiri was nested, and highly support, within Pelasgus-Delminichthys lineage.
Phylogenetic relationships with all-genes data matrix

Combined data analysis recovered the major lineages
and increased their support (posterior probabilities and
bootstrap values higher than only mitochondrial and
nuclear analysis) (Figure 7). Indeed, this effect can be
explained because large number of variable characters

accuracy resolution of their phylogenetic framework,
and subsequently of their evolutionary history. We have
based our phylogenetic discussion in the all-genes topology, which was the most solved and supported tree and
summarizes the information of all analyzed genes.
Although some studies have tried to explain the phylogenetic relationships of Mediterranean leuciscins
[4,5,18,37,43,63,64], this study is the first molecular
approximation to the phylogenetic placement of the
three very poorly studied, small size North African Pseudophoxinus species: P. callensis, P. chaignoni and P.
punicus. We have demonstrated here that none of this

three species belong to the real genus Pseudophoxinus.
Morphological approaches have already hypothesized a
close relationship among P. callensis and P. chaignoni in
relation with P. punicus [72]. Our molecular phylogeny
corroborate this later affirmation, and whereas P. callensis and P. chaignoni were closely related, and in turn
clustered with the genus Tropidophoxinellus, P. punicus
was nested within the Alburnus and Leucaspius group.
The phylogenetic positions of the North African species
P. punicus and the genera Leucaspius and Anaecypris
strongly suggest that these species belong to the lineage
of Alburnus. The inclusion of these genera turns into

Perea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/265

paraphyletic the genus Alburnus. For this reason, this
issue opens the question about whether the group
formed by Alburnus baliki, A. orontis and A. sellal from
Anatolia and Levant should represent an independent
genus or if the monotypic miniature Anaecypris and
Leucaspius should be included into Alburnus. The inclusion of P. punicus into the Alburnus lineage has been
already proposed based on morphology [72,73], as well
as previous morphological [18,73] and molecular studies
[5] have already hypothesized a close relationship of
Anaecypris and Leucaspius with Alburnus. Moreover, as
other dwarf leuciscine, Anaecypris also have been placed
in Pseudophoxinus or Phoxinellus by some authors
[74,75]. As in other small sized and specialized cyprinids
as the Leuciscinae Delminichthys [63] and Pelasgus [2]
or the Rasborinae Paedocypris [23], synapomorphic
characters seem to have been overshadowed by morphological changed connected to miniaturization. However,
further specific studies are required to solve these questions. In turn, P. callensis and P. chaignoni are here
transferred provisionally to the genus Tropidophoxinellus (See Table 3).
The real genus Pseudophoxinus (type species P. zeregi)
comprises the Anatolian and Levant species, which are
clustered in the same lineage that Telestes (its sister
group), Phoxinellus and the six new genera described
for the former genus Chondrostoma s. l.: Achondrostoma, Chondrostoma, Iberochondrostoma, Parachondrostoma, Protochondrostoma and Pseudochondrostoma [64].
Within the Anatolian Pseudophoxinus two well-differentiated groups are recognized: one of them is the group
formed by the complex of species inhabiting Central
Anatolia (P. alii, P. anatolicus, P. antalyae, P. battalgilae, P. crassus, P. elizavetae, P. evliyae, P. fahettini, P.
ninae and one possibly undescribed species) and the
other one from the Levant (P. firati, P. kervillei, P. zeregi
and P. zekayi). Relationships of Pseudophoxinus were
not in agreement with morphological studies [76,77].
We also demonstrate here that P. egridiri forms a single group related to the Delminichtys-Pelasgus lineage
instead of the rest of Pseudophoxinus species. The
hypothesis that P. egridiri is not related to Pseudophoxinus was already proposed and suspicions that it might
be more related to the genus Phoxinus have been formulated [78]. However, our data rejected this hypothesis
and demonstrated that P. egridiri constitutes an independent phylogenetic lineage. All the species of Delminichthys-Pelasgus lineage are dwarf cyprinids mostly
characterized by reductive traits but also have some
own synapomorphic characters [63,76]. They have been
erroneously included in the genus Pseudophoxinus or
Phoxinellus [2,63,79]. Indeed, Pseudophoxinus was considered to be a subgenus of Phoxinellus for many decades [76].

Page 13 of 27

The genus Telestes is closely related to the main group
of Pseudophoxinus and we also support the position of
Telestes croaticus, T. fontinalis and T. metohiensis into
this genus as were previously pointed out [63]. These
species were previously placed in the genus Phoxinellus
[79].
The genus Squalius is widely distributed throughout
Europe and is highly diversified in the Mediterranean
area and three groups have been identified within this
genus [32]: A Mediterranean group composed of small
species from southern Spain, Central Italy, Southern
Greece and the Balkans; an Euroasiatic group that is
widely distributed throughout central-east Europe, Asia
and the north of Mediterranean area and the Parathethys group, which includes species around the Black
sea and Anatolia. Our phylogeny supports these groups,
but we have complemented the taxonomical sampling,
finding that S. illyricus, S. microlepis, S. svallize and S.
tenellus also are included within the Mediterranean
group reported by Sanjur et al. [32], as well as some
Anatolian species in the Euroasiatic group. Furthermore,
within the Mediterranean group a geographical structure
is observed: an Iberian subgroup, a second Italo-Adriatic
subgroup, and a third Greek subgroup (Peloponnesus),
which is not found in the “S. cephalus group”. As same
as Chondrostoma s. l. phylogenetic relationships between
all of these subgroups were not solved, showing basal
politomies rather than bifurcating relationships. Concerning to “Squalius cephalus“ complex, an underestimation on the diversity of this group is observed, a
further taxonomic review is required, especially in
Euphrates drainage. In contrast to the remaining Squalius species, “S. cephalus“ complex did not show a geographical structure; thus, Greek Squalius species did not
form a monophyletic group due to Iberian S. laietanus
was closer to Greek S. orpheus [5,32,37] and Adriatic S.
squalus was the sister group of Greek S. prespensis.
However, phylogenetic relationships within Greek Squalius were in agreement with allozymic [10] and mitochondrial [80] previous studies.
The genus Petroleuciscus (the Squalius Paratethys
group recognized by Sanjur et al. [32]) comprises six
poorly known species: P. borysthenicus (type species), P.
kurui, P. smyrnaeus, P. persidis, P. squaliusculus and P.
ulanus [81]. This study represents the first molecular
approach that takes into account three species of Petroleuciscus. Petroleuciscus turn out to represent a group of
unrelated taxa. Thus, Petroleuciscus borysthenicus and P.
smyrnaeus are two closely related species from the
Aegean and Black sea basins with relationships to the
genera Ladygesocypris and Squalius. Interestingly, Leuciscus aphipsi from the northern Caucasus also belongs
to this group, being a morphologically very unspecialized species with still many plesiomorphic characters

[82,83]. Although this species was transferred from the
genus Leuciscus into the genus Squalius [2,84], our outcome demonstrates that it is more related to the genus
Petroleuciscus than to Squalius and it is therefore transferred to Petroleuciscus here (See table 3). Iranian Petroleuciscus persidis was initially described as a species of
Pseudophoxinus [85], later transferred to the genus Leuciscus [44] suspected to be related to P. smyrnaeus (former considered as L. smyrnaeus) [86] and then included
in Petroleuciscus [81]. These relationships are inconsistent with our molecular data, which strongly support
close affinities of P. persidis with the genus Acanthobrama, also pointing on the difficulties of morphological
characterization of miniaturized cyprinids [23,63].
Therefore, this species is transferred to Acanthobrama
as A. persidis (See table 3). Furthermore, our data support the synonymization of the genus Acanthalburnus
with Acanthobrama, both genera just distinguished by
the two vs. one rows of pharyngeal teeth [46]. Our
results demonstrate also that both species of the highly
specialized, predatory genus Aspius belong to Leuciscus.
Therefore, these species are transferred to Leuciscus as
L. aspius and L. vorax (See table 3).
The position of the genus Ladygesocypris (L. ghigii and
L. irideus) nested in or close to the Squalius clade was
already reported for mitochondrial data [6,32] and here
is also supported by nuclear markers. Ladygesocypris
was recently included into the genus Pseudophoxinus
[77], a hypothesis that has not molecular support. However, its transfer to Squalius is supported by our data
(See table 3).
With regards to Scardinius, this genus have been considered the sister group of Tropidophoxinellus [5,87] but
a close phylogenetic relationship among Scardinius and
Alburnus has also been hypothesized [5,18]. Our phylogeny strongly supported the sister relationship among
Scardinius and Tropidophoxinellus more than among
Scardinius and Alburnus, independently of the North
African species Pseudophoxinus chaignoni and P. callensis belong to the genus Tropidophoxinellus or not. Our
nuclear phylogeny showed a low support for a

relationship among Scardinius and Rutilus, as suspected
already by morphological characters [14]. Whereas mitochondrial cyt b analysis grouped together the lineages of
Scardinius, Tropidophoxinellus-Pseudophoxinus callensis-P.chaignoni (transferred here to Tropidophoxinellus
callensis and T. chaignoni) and Alburnus-AnaecyprisLeucaspius-Pseudophoxinus punicus, basal relationships
among these lineages were not solved with COxI and
nuclear markers, probably due to the slower evolutionary rate of these genes respect to cyt b one. However,
combined data matrix (all genes) analysis recovered this
relationship. Within the genus Scardinius, our data support some recognized species [2]. S. erythrophthalmus is
a Central and Eastern European species, S. scardafa
endemic to Lake Scanno in Central Italy [62,88] is closely related to S. hesperidicus, as has been previously
established [62,89]. Scardinius plotizza from the Dalmatian River Neretva constituted an independent and
highly supported clade.
Biogeography
Divergence time estimates and general biogeographical
patterns

To decipher evolutionary and biogeographical patterns
in the Mediterranean leuciscins, the different authors
have calibrated a molecular clock for the cytochrome b
gene using fossil or geological data [5,7,20,37,43,90].
Based on fossil calibration, we obtained an evolutionary
rate of 0.4% divergence per lineage per million years
(0.8% per pairwise comparison) for cytochrome b, which
differs from previous estimates [5,90], and is slightly
slower than formerly proposed for North American
cyprinids based on fossil data (0.5% per lineage per million year) [91]. The present study is the first to use
nuclear markers to estimate the main historical processes that gave rise to the current phylogeny and distribution of the Mediterranean leuciscine lineages. The
average evolutionary rate obtained here was 0.2% per
lineage per million years for the combined dataset (cytochrome b, COxI, RAG1 and S7) (0.4% per pairwise comparison). Notwithstanding, estimated divergence times

Perea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/265

were congruent to those predicted by the cytochrome b
gene (not shown) and fell within the same confidence
intervals. However, credibility intervals of the combined
dataset (i.e. more informative sites in the analysis) were
narrower, suggesting that the combination of several
markers may improve the results [92].
The complex paleogeography of the Mediterranean
region, with migrating island arcs, fragmenting tectonic
belts and other plate tectonic events have contributed to
the formation of a reticulate biogeographical pattern in
which the current leuciscine groups formed as geographical barriers appeared and disappeared through time.
This reticulate pattern is, however, not reflected by a
congruent biogeographical pattern in leuciscine relationships based on sister groups within each evolutionary
lineage.
Origin of leuciscins in Mediterranean inland waters: birth of
the Paratethys

According to our molecular evolutionary rate based on a
relaxed molecular clock and all-gene database, the main
Mediterranean leuciscine lineages arose and diversified in
the Oligocene period (Figure 8). In the context of the
widely accepted origin of cyprinids in Asia, our data do
not contradict the north-dispersal model of the first
cyprinid colonization of northern Europe across Siberia
[34,35], when the Turgai Straits were closed around the
Eocene-Oligocene boundary (approximately 34 mya; Figure 9A) and strongly support a gradual colonization of
Mediterranean region since Oligocene, as have been
recently stated [93]. As the fossil record shows, this first
cyprinid colonization event involved phoxinin and gobionin lineages [94,95]. However, according to our data, the
presence of old leuciscins in the Balkan/Anatolia area of
possible Southwest Asian origin could be explained by
the emergence of a huge Balkanian-Anatolian-Iranian
landmass in the Early Oligocene (33 mya) [96]. Continental collisions and tectonic movements along the AlpineHimalayan orogenic belt, which led to the separation of
the Paratethys Epicontinental Sea from the Tethys
Ocean, drove this event. We therefore propose an initial
leuciscine colonization of Europe from southwestern
Asia via the Balkanian-Anatolian-Iranian landmass at the
beginning of the Early Oligocene (Figure 9B), which precisely matches the initial splitting of the most basal leuciscine lineages (XI, XII and XIII) from the remaining
leuciscins in 32.9 mya (CI 95% 29.6-33.5).
Unequivocal fossil proof of this biogeographic hypothesis is hampered by the fact that Oligocene freshwater
deposits from the Balkanian-Anatolian-Iranian landmass
are scarce and not well studied. The oldest fossils that
could be ascribed to the Leuciscinae have been recovered in central Anatolia (Table 4) and have been dated
around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary [97,98]. This
material consists of isolated pharyngeal teeth and

Page 17 of 27

otoliths for which a leuciscine relationship is possible,
but not certain.
Vicariant events promoting leuciscine diversification in the
Oligocene: Paratethys isolation and reconnection

During most of the Early Oligocene (Solenovian regional
stage), the Tethys and Paratethys Seas remained isolated
by the Balkanian-Anatolian-Iranian landmass. Marine
connections fragmented this landmass around 28 mya
into the huge Balkanian and Anatolian islands [96]. This
vicariant event was probably responsible for splitting of
the ancient Balkan-Anatolian lineages around the EarlyLate Oligocene transition (29.1 mya, CI 95% 27.6-31.4).
This main Late Oligocene paleogeographic (Figure 9C)
setting persisted until the early Burdigalian 20 to 19
mya.
By the end of the Oligocene (23 mya) half of all leuciscin lineages (7 out of 14) (Figure 8) had become
established, indicating their rapid diversification during
the Late Oligocene. During this time, leuciscine fossils
are unknown from the European mainland and we
hypothesize that this diversification occurred on the
Balkanian-Anatolian-Iranian archipelago. Geodynamic
data substantiating vicariant events in the Late Oligocene are rare from this area. For the time being, it may
be speculated that karstic landscapes, similar to those
found in this region today, could have facilitated the
geographical isolation and speciation process.
Vicariant events promoting leuciscine diversification in the
Early-Middle Miocene: the Alpine Orogeny, Dinarid Lake
systems and Gomphotherium landbridge

More recent paleogeographical events support the splitting of some leuciscine groups in the Early-Middle Miocene, from 20 to 12 mya, giving rise to most of the
current genera. This period coincides with a major period in the Alpine orogeny, including the closing of the
Slovenian corridor, the extrusion and uplift of the Eastern Alps and substantial microplate rotations and basin
inversion in the Pannonian-Carpathian-Dinaric realm
[99-104].
The Slovenian corridor, a marine connection between
the Tethys and Paratethys Seas separated the BalkanianAnatolian landmass from the rest of Europe during the
Oligocene and earliest Miocene. This gateway closed
around 20 mya [105] and probably enabled the first
colonization of Central Europe by leuciscins from the
Balkanian-Anatolian landmass (Figure 9D). This view is
supported by fossils like the oldest European leuciscins
in sediments from about 19 mya in Germany related to
Pseudophoxinus and Delminichthys [94,106,107] and
from 19-18 mya old fossils of Aspius and “Alburnus“
[108,109] in the Czech Republic. These paleontological
data fit the start of diversification of leuciscins such as
Aspius (20.5 mya, CI 95% 17.6-21.3) or Alburnus
lineages (19.7 mya, CI 95% 16.7-21.9).

The Alpine orogeny similarly affected the leuciscine
ichthyofauna of the Mediterranean Peninsulas. Thus, in
the Iberian Peninsula, the Pyrenees promoted the isolation of Iberian freshwater fishes during the Miocene
period when they took on their current form [110-112].
Indeed, all leuciscins from this region are endemic
except Squalius laietanus, which also inhabits southern
France. Thus, the Iberian Squalius must have split from
the Balkan and Italian Squalius 14.6 mya (CI 95% 10.914.9). In turn, the endemic genera Achondrostoma,

Iberochondrostoma, Parachondrostoma and Pseudochondrostoma split from the genus Chondrostoma 9.4 mya
(CI 95% 7.9-11.4). The Pyrenees may have also constituted a vicariant barrier between the European and Iberian Alburnine (ancestors of Anaecypris, Alburnus and/or
Leucaspius), splitting 12.1 mya (CI 95% 9-14.8). This
timing of the origin of Iberian Leuciscinae lineages is
congruent with the results of previous studies [43,64].
In the Apennine Peninsula, the Alpine orogeny may
have also played an important role in isolating its

ichthyofauna. Most of Italy was below sea level during
most of the Miocene [113] and it is consequently
believed that the Italian ichthyofauna is of a more recent
origin than that of the remaining Mediterranean Peninsulas. Although dispersion during the lacustrine phase of
the Mediterranean Sea has been suggested as the origin
of the Italian ichthyofauna [38], our data point to an
older origin, probably related to the lateral tectonic
extrusion of the eastern Alps between 17 and 11 mya
that isolated Italian taxa from north and central Europe.
The role of the eastern Alps as a barrier to Italian and
Adriatic freshwater ichthyofauna has been previously
established [114,115]. This is the case for Protochondrostoma 11.5 mya (CI 95% 9.5-13.5), or some Rutilus, which
according to our mitochondrial data (figure not shown),
split 9.7 mya (CI 95% 6.2-10.6) into R. rubilio and 13.2
mya (CI 95% 9.4-15.1) into R. pigus. This is the only case
in which mitochondrial information has been used to disscus date estimation. This can be explained due to we
only incorporated a few representatives of each genera to
perform all-gene molecular clock analysis and none of
these species have been include on all-gene dataset. However, the knowledge of this splitting date for species such
as Protochondrostoma genei or Rutilus rubilio and R.
pigus is crucial to show the effect of Alps as a barrier for
Italian and Adriatic freshwater icthyofauna.
In the Balkan Peninsula, and especially in the Dalmatian area, huge lake systems existed between 17 and ~15

mya during the late early Miocene and early Middle
Miocene (e.g. Dinaric Lake system, Lake Skopje; [116]).
The fragmentation or disappearance of these lakes could
have enhanced isolation and promoted speciation. Such
is the case of Delminichthys, which split from Pelasgus
in approximately 14 mya (CI 95% 11.0- 20.7). This dating is close to previously estimates (13 mya; [63]) and
also coincides with the splitting of Chondrostoma s.l.
from its sister group Phoxinellus isolated in Dalmatia
14.6 mya (CI 95% 12.1-16.7). Subsequent to this period
of lakes, the region experienced the onset of compressional tectonic stress in the late Serravallian around 12.5
mya, initiating a period of uplift of the Dinaric Alps
[117]. This orogenic event could have generated barriers
for the Dalmatian Chondrostoma, Squalius and Telestes,
which split approximately 9.7 mya (CI 95% 6.2-11.9), 9.2
mya (CI 95% 5-10.1) and 12.4 mya (CI 95% 11-16.3)
respectively.
Another important vicariant event between the Greek
and North African Tropidophoxinellus took place in the
Early Miocene in 17.4 mya (CI 95% 7.9-16.6), indicating
colonization of Africa by leuciscins well before the Messinian salinity crisis. This finding rejects the later
hypothesis of “Lago Mare dispersal” [38] for the colonization of North Africa by leuciscins, which would
explain the colonization of this region due to dispersion
during the lacustrine phase of the Mediterranean Sea
(Messinian salinity crisis). The most plausible

Perea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/265

explanation for vicariance between the Peloponessus and
Magreb area is the migration of common ancestors of
Tropidophoxinellus from the Balkanian-Anatolian landmass into North Africa via the Gomphotherium landbridge established in West Asia around 19 mya (Figure
9D). This landbridge separated the Tethyan Ocean into
the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean and allowed
the first continental exchange between Eurasian and
African mammals and reptiles [118,119] and the first
colonization of Africa by barbin cyprinids ([120]; Böhme
unpublished data). Despite fossil leuciscins being as yet
unknown from the African Miocene, the data presented
here suggest that leuciscins probably took part in this
Early Miocene dispersal event.
Of special biogeographic interest is the sister-group
relationship between Notemigonus crysoleucas, the only
North American leuciscine species, and the old Balkanian-Anatolian Pseudophoxinus egridiri/Pelasgus/Delminichthys lineages, which separated according to our data
around 20.3 mya (Figure 8). However this relationship
has to be considered with caution due to its relatively
low support (posterior probability equal to 86). As stated above, a possible sister taxon of the Pseudophoxinus
egridiri/Pelasgus/Delminichthys lineages, the fossil genus
Palaeoleuciscus, made its oldest fossil appearance in 19
mya old sediments of central Europe, indicating a transatlantic biogeographic connection. Interestingly, an Early
Miocene transatlantic colonization of North America by
cyprinids was already speculated by Böhme [94] in the
context of the paleobiogeography of phoxinins. This
author demonstrates a sister-group relationship between
the central European Oligocene phoxinin Palaeorutilus
and the eastern North American Creek Chub clade of
phoxinins. The data presented here further support such
an idea, and may indicate that eastern North America
was colonized during Early Miocene times via a transatlantic route by the ancestors of the leuciscin Notemigonus (a species related to Palaeoleuciscus) and the Creek
Chubs (species related to Palaeorutilus). The paleogeographic details of this hypothesis, however, remain
obscure.
Vicariant events promoting leuciscine diversification in the
Upper Miocene

In this period, the opening of the Aegean Sea was an
important event for leuciscins (Figure 9E), which is
thought to have started in the Late Serravallian about 12
mya [101] and finished during the Tortonian between
10 and 9 mya [121-123]. As a consequence, some
groups of Greek and Anatolian leuciscins diversified,
such as Squalius ghigii/irideus from Rhodos Island and
Southwestern Anatolia and Squalius keadicus from
southern Greece. These taxa split 8.7 mya (CI 95% 713.2). In fact, the paleogeographical history of the

Page 20 of 27

Balkan Peninsula is strongly linked to the paleogeography of Anatolia since both areas were joined in the
same landmass and isolated from the rest of Europe
during long periods of the Oligocene and Miocene.
The North African Pseudophoxinus punicus splits near
the Middle-Late Miocene boundary; also well before the
Messinian salinity crisis. Two possible vicariant barriers
could explain its distribution: the opening of the Gibraltar Straits (splitting of Iberian Anaecypris), which has
been recognized as a geographical barrier for some
groups [124], or the opening of the Channel of Sicily
(splitting of European Alburnus or Leucaspius). However, both the Gibraltar Straits and the Sicily Channel
formed at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary at the end of
the Messinian salinity crisis [40,125] and our estimated
divergence time for P. punicus is earlier than this date
(10.9 mya, CI 95% 6.2-12.2). The vicariant event leading
to the separation of Pseudophoxinus punicus therefore
remains unclear.
The Messinian

The Messinian has been postulated as the time of diversification of Mediterranean cyprinids. Hence, the Lago
Mare stage of the Mediterranean would have enabled the
massive dispersion of cyprinids across the basin. The
later return to marine conditions could have meant a fast
speciation process for cyprinids. This may be reflected in
the deep polytomies found in the phylogeny. Thus, some
authors have defended the Lago Mare hypothesis [38]
based on non-resolved polytomies among the main
clades [7,42,54]. However, our phylogeny does not show
a critical point of speciation around 5 mya. These processes took place gradually over time, but preclude any
massive dispersal and speciation during the Messinian
period, as has been proven for Squalius and Chondrostoma s.l. [37,43,64]. Fossils of the Spanish genera (Achondrostoma, Iberochondrostoma, Parachondrostoma,
Pseudochondrostoma) are recorded first in the late Messinian (Table 4), which may indicate dispersal of their
ancestors during the Messinian Lago Mare stage.
Pliocene and Pleistocene

The beginning of the Pliocene is characterized by a rise
in humidity in the Mediterranean region [126], which
may have promoted the diversification of Leuciscinae
genera in different Mediterranean Peninsulas, through
the possible colonization of newly established freshwater
environments after the Messinian salinity crisis. In the
Iberian Peninsula, tectonic disconnections of presentday Iberian basins took place during the Plio-Pleistocene
[127] promoting widespread endorrheism and thus
enhancing the process of allopatric speciation, which is
reflected in the high species-levels of most Iberian genera except the monotypic genus Anaecypris. In turn, the
divergence of some Italian taxa from their Balkanian

Perea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/265

sister-taxa occurred in this period, such as the splitting
of Rutilus aula (4.75 mya, CI 95% 1.91-5.02), and Squalius lucumonis (3.53 mya, CI 95% 2.13-5.80).
In the Adriatic-Balkanian region, even more recent
events explain the great affinities found between the
ichthyofauna of northern Italy and northern rivers of
the Balkan Peninsula. These similarities reflect recent
contact between North Italian and North Adriatic-Balkanian ichthyofauna due to expansion of the Po River
during the Last Glacial Maximum as a result of a drop
in sea level [128]. This event may have prompted the
exchange of many freshwater taxa among Italian and
Balkan river systems, and also explains the current distribution of species such as Squalius squalus and similarities found between Chondrostoma soetta and the
Dalmatian species Chondrostoma knerii and C. phoxinus.
Similar affinities have been described for freshwater fish
species from northern Italy and Balkan rivers including
Cobitis [129] or Cottus [130] species.
On the other hand, Pleistocene glaciations also played
an important role in the current European distribution
of the Leuciscinae, and determined a more recent origin
of some leuciscine taxa after colonization from glacial
refuges such as the Danube basin. However, other rivers
of the Black Sea basin could have also acted as a glacial
refuge for freshwater ichthyofauna [51]. Some northcentral European representatives of leuciscins share a
widespread distribution range: Alburnoides bipunctatus,
Alburnus alburnus, Chondrostoma nasus, Rutilus rutilus,
Scardinius erythrophthalmus and Squalius cephalus.
This pattern can be explained by the homogeneity conferred by glacial refuges [35,131-133]. Thus, secondary
recolonization of Western Europe from a Danubian
refuge has been postulated for S. cephalus [131] and C.
nasus [34,134]. River captures, river confluences and sea
level lowering have been incriminated in the dispersion
of these species [131]. Thus, glacial periods promoted
the expansion and genetic homogenization of these species across Europe [48,131,135]. Since most central European basins were covered by ice during the
Pleistocene, colonization is the most likely mechanism
to explain the expansion of these species. However, they
could not have reached the Mediterranean Peninsulas
because of the transverse alignment of Alpine Mountains, which were well formed in the Pleistocene except
in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. This area
shows the influence of the Danube basin due to the
oblique direction of the Dinaric Alps.

Conclusions
Mitochondrial and nuclear results demonstrated the
existence of fourteen major phylogenetic leuciscine
lineages. However, some incongruence was found
between mitochondrial and nuclear markers, possibly

Page 21 of 27

due to the lack of resolution of deep nodes in nuclear
phylogeny as well as their slower evolutionary rate.
Combined analysis (mitochondrial + nuclear) recovered
the major lineages and increased their support.
With regards to phylogenetic relationships, this study
is the first molecular approximation to the phylogenetic
placement of North African leuciscine species (P. callensis, P. chaignoni, and P. punicus). None of these three
species belong to the real genus Pseudophoxinus, as well
as P. egridiri, and constitute independent lineages. The
real genus Pseudophoxinus includes species from Anatolia and Levant. Our phylogeny also demonstrates that
the genus Petroleuciscus is polyphyletic and as a result
its species involve different leuciscine lineages. It also
point out the closer relationship of Squalius aphipsi to
Petroleuciscus. As our phylogeny show, the taxonomy of
the genera Pseudophoxinus and Petroleuciscus is a matter of controversy because of synapomorphic characters
are prone to be overshadowed by morphological changes
associated to miniaturization. New insights in the phylogenetic relationships of some Squalius species are
showed too, such as some Dalmatian species, as well as
the corroboration by nuclear markers of the phylogenetic position of Ladigesocypris ghigii/irideus as closer
related to the genus Squalius.
In relation to biogeographical history of Leuciscinae,
the present study is the first to use nuclear markers to
estimate main historical processes that gave rise to the
current phylogeny and distribution of Circum-Mediterranean Leuciscinae. A relaxed molecular clock corroborated the arisen and divergence of the main Leuciscinae
lineages during Late Oligocene-Early Miocene. Our data
do not contradict the north-dispersal model of the first
cyprinid colonization of Northern Europe across Siberia.
However, most of the divergence events were older than
Lago Mare dispersal model. We proposed an initial
colonization of Europe from Southwestern Asia via the
Balkanian/Anatolian/Iranian landmass at the beginning
of the Early Oligocene, which precisely matches the
initial splitting of the most basal leuciscins. Later vicariant events as the Paratethys isolation and later reconnection with Tethys during the Oligocene and the
Alpine Orogeny, Dinarid lake systems and Gomphoterium landbridges during Miocene promoted Leuciscinae
diversification. Our data also corroborate the colonization of North Africa before the Messinian salinity crisis.
In Upper Miocene the opening of Aegean Sea was an
important vicariant event for Anatolian and Greek leuciscins. Messinian appears as a stage of gradually Leuciscinae diversification more than a critical point of
speciation. The rise of humidity at the beginning of the
Pliocene may have promoted the diversification of Leuciscinae genera due to the colonization of newly established freshwater environments. Finally, Pleistocene

Perea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/265

glaciations also played an important role in the current
European distribution of some leuciscins.

Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing

The complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (total of
1140 bp) from 321 specimens belonging to 176 species
of leusciscins was obtained from Europe, Western
Asia, North Africa and North America (Figure 10). Of
total individuals, 186 were new sequences for cytochrome b and the remaining sequences were acquired
from Genbank. Similarly, 146 individuals were
sequenced to obtain a fragment of the mitochondrial
Cytochrome oxidase I gene (646 bp). For the nuclear
phylogenetic analysis, a subset of 101 individuals was
selected from mtDNA lineages and sequenced for both
the nuclear genes RAG1 (1473 bp) and the first intron
of the ribosomal protein S7 (1112 bp total alignment
including gaps). DNA voucher specimens were deposited at the collection of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (Madrid, Spain). List of individuals,
localities and GenBank Accession numbers are
reported in Additional file 1.
For phylogenetic analyses, we rooted the trees with
representatives of several cyprinids subfamilies. For this

Page 22 of 27

purpose, species such as Gobio gobio (Gobioninae) Rhodeus amarus, R. ocellatus and R. atremius (Acheilognatinae), Tinca tinca (Tincinae), and Pseudorasbora parva
(Gobioninae) were used as outgroups in phylogenetic
analyses.
Total cellular DNA was extracted from both ethanol
preserved or frozen tissue by a standard proteinase K
and phenol/chloroform extraction method [136] and
ethanol purification [137]. Both mitochondrial (cytochrome b and COxI) and nuclear (RAG1 and S7) genes
were amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
from each individual DNA sample. Primers, amplification protocols and PCR products lengths for these loci
are represented in Additional file 2. In all cases, PCR
mixtures were prepared under similar conditions in a
final volume of 25 μl containing 1-2 μl DNA, 0.5 μM
each primer, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1
unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). After checking PCR products on 1.5% agarose gels, the four genetic
fragments were purified with the kit ExoSAP-IT™(USB)
and directly sequenced. For RAG1 some internal primers were designed to sequencing (See Additional file
2). All samples were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA sequencer following the manufacturer’s
instructions. All new are available online [Genbank:

Homologous regions were aligned manually against previously published cytochrome b sequences of leuciscins
[4,5]. Chromatograms and alignments were visually
checked and verified and there were no gaps in the
resulting cyt b, COxI and RAG1. In these three coding
genes sequences alignment was based on the inferred
amino acid sequence. Alignments sequences of all performed analyses are proporcioned in Additional file 3.
All codon posititions were included in the analysis. The
first intron of S7 gene were aligned with Clustal X
[138], using default parameters, to optimize sequence
alignment including gaps and aligned sequences were
later checked by eye. Despite of indels are often considered as a class of phylogenetic characters to be incorporate in the phylogenetic analysis [139,140], gaps of S7
gene was discarded in phylogenetic reconstructions due
to their ambiguity in the alignment.
For all data sets, the transition (ti)/transversion (tv)
rate was estimated using a maximun-likelihood
approach (Table 1). Furthermore, for each gene, the
saturation of transition and transversion changes was
checked by plotting the absolute number of changes of
each codon position against patristic distances (p).
There was no evidence of saturation for any data set of
sequences, even in the third position of coding genes.
Analyses were performed independently on each gene
(cyt b, COxI, RAG1 and S7), in nuclear data sets and on
the total number of base pairs sequenced (4339 bp)
("Total evidence”, [141]). Nucleotide composition was
examined and the c2 homogeneity test of base frequencies was carried out in Paup *4.0b10 [142] for all genes.
The Akaike Information Criterion implemented in ModelTest v. 3.7 [67] was used to determine the evolutionary
model that best fits the data set for each data set. The
model selected was used for subsequent analyses. Bayesian inference (BI) was performed with MrBayes 3.1.2
[143]. In the combined data set each gene partition was
allowed to follow its own model of evolution. In all
cases, BI was obtained by simulating two simultaneous
Markov chain analyses (MCMC) for 3.000.000 generations each, to estimate the posterior probabilities distribution. Topologies were sampled every 100 generations
and a majority-rule consensus tree was estimated after
eliminated the first 10 5 generations in each analysis.
Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis was performed with
PhyML package [144]. To estimate the robustness of the
likelihood analyses a nonparametric bootstrap test was

conducted with 500 replicates. Maximum Parsimony
(MP) [145] analysis was performed with the package
PAUP* 4.0b10 [142]. MP analysis was conducted with
TBR branch swapping and 10 random stepwise additions using the heuristic search algorithm. Analyses
were performed on each independent data set and on
the total data matrix after check homogeneity among
partitions [146]. Confidences for this analysis were estimated by bootstrapping (500 repetitions) [147].
Molecular clock and divergence times estimates

As a general clock-like behaviour was rejected, divergence times and their credibility intervals (highest posterior density: HPD) were estimated using a relaxed
clock model in BEAST v1.4.7 [148], with branch rates
drawn from an uncorrelated lognormal distribution
[149] and a Yule speciation prior. Fossil evidence was
used to place the constraints of the age of different
nodes within the topology. The use of multiple calibration points would provide a more realistic divergence
time estimates. The calibration points used to estimate
divergence times are represented in Table 5. Tracer v1.4
[148] was used to plot the log-likelihood scores against
generation time to evaluate run convergence and the
burn-in needed before to reconstruct the 50% majorityrule consensus tree of the post burn-in trees. To obtain
a maximum clade credibility tree, trees were summarized with the software TreeAnnotator 1.4.6 [148].
