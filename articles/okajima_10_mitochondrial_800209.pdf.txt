of gene rearrangements and phylogenetic and
biogeographic implications

Abstract
Background: Acrodonta consists of Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae that have the characteristic acrodont dentition.
These two families and Iguanidae sensu lato are members of infraorder Iguania. Phylogenetic relationships and
historical biogeography of iguanian lizards still remain to be elucidated in spite of a number of morphological and
molecular studies. This issue was addressed by sequencing complete mitochondrial genomes from 10 species that
represent major lineages of acrodont lizards. This study also provided a good opportunity to compare molecular
evolutionary modes of mitogenomes among different iguanian lineages.
Results: Acrodontan mitogenomes were found to be less conservative than iguanid counterparts with respect to gene
arrangement features and rates of sequence evolution. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed with the
mitogenomic sequence data and timing of gene rearrangements was inferred on it. The result suggested highly
lineage-specific occurrence of several gene rearrangements, except for the translocation of the tRNAPro gene from the
5' to 3' side of the control region, which likely occurred independently in both agamine and chamaeleonid lineages.
Phylogenetic analyses strongly suggested the monophyly of Agamidae in relation to Chamaeleonidae and the nonmonophyly of traditional genus Chamaeleo within Chamaeleonidae. Uromastyx and Brookesia were suggested to be
the earliest shoot-off of Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae, respectively. Together with the results of relaxed-clock dating
analyses, our molecular phylogeny was used to infer the origin of Acrodonta and historical biogeography of its
descendant lineages. Our molecular data favored Gondwanan origin of Acrodonta, vicariant divergence of Agamidae
and Chamaeleonidae in the drifting India-Madagascar landmass, and migration of the Agamidae to Eurasia with the
Indian subcontinent, although Laurasian origin of Acrodonta was not strictly ruled out.
Conclusions: We detected distinct modes of mitogenomic evolution among iguanian families. Agamidae was
highlighted in including a number of lineage-specific mitochondrial gene rearrangements. The mitogenomic data
provided a certain level of resolution in reconstructing acrodontan phylogeny, although there still remain ambiguous
relationships. Our biogeographic implications shed a light on the previous hypothesis of Gondwanan origin of
Acrodonta by adding some new evidence and concreteness.
Background
Acrodonta is a group of squamate lizards that have the
characteristic acrodont dentition. Acrodonta consists of
two families, Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae, while Pleurodonta having the pleurodont dentition includes Iguanidae sensu lato [1]. These three families are extant related

members of the infraorder Iguania [2], containing
approximately 1,500 species in the world [1]. They are
mainly dendrophilous or ground living, and herbivorous
or insectivorous animals. Agamids show a certain level of
morphological convergence with iguanids whereas
chamaeleonids are morphologically quite unique in various organs, such as eye, tongue, tail, and toe [1]. In contrast to the mainly New World distribution of Iguanidae,
extant acrodont families are distributed primarily in tropical or subtropical regions of the Old World [1]. Agamids
are widely distributed in Asia (including Indoaustralian

Archipelago), Australasia and Africa. Chamaeleonids can
be seen in Africa (including islands off East Africa), Madagascar, Middle East, Spain, and South Asia.
Phylogenetic relationships between iguanian lizards
have been studied both morphologically [2-9] and molecularly [10-18]. These studies are in agreement with one
another with respect to the monophylies of Acrodonta
(Agamidae + Chamaeleonidae) and Chamaeleonidae.
However, the monophyletic status of both Iguanidae and
Agamidae is still under debate and these families have
often been treated as metataxa (e.g., [2,3,10]). Within the
families Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae, morphological
studies identified several groups that nearly correspond
to agamid subfamilies [3] and chamaeleonid genera [5].
However, the interrelationships of these relatively deepbranch clades have not been settled yet even by the
molecular studies that combined a few genes from mitochondrial and/or nuclear genomes. Collection of more
nucleotide sites may help to increase resolution in phylogenetic analyses.
Complete mitochondrial genomes may be a target for
this purpose because they provide ample nucleotide sites
with straightforward sequencing and analytical procedures (see, e.g., [19]) and because they are relatively free
from DNA recombinations and gene duplications/deletions [20], albeit with some criticisms on the close genetic
linkages of mitochondrial genes, potential saturation of
rapidly evolving sites, and occasional strong positive
selections [21]. Vertebrate mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) are 16 - 18 kbp double-stranded circular DNAs,
which encode 37 genes for 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 13
proteins together with a major noncoding region or control region (CR) that is believed to regulate replication
and transcription of the mtDNA [20,22]. The gene organization of these encoded genes and the CR is usually
very conservative but, in some groups such as Agamidae,
gene rearrangements have been reported [23-25]. Why
the evolution of mitochondrial genomes is less conservative in some lineages with respect to rates of changes in
the sequence and the gene arrangement is still an open
question.
When we started this study, complete or nearly complete mtDNA sequences were known from four agamids
[24-27] and one chamaeleonid [28]. Macey et al. [29] later
added more than a dozen of chamaeleonid taxa mostly
from genus Chamaeleo. In this study, we collected additional mitogenomic sequences from taxa that represent
major groups of Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae. Using
these molecular data, we addressed to clarify 1) frequency and timing of the gene rearrangements, 2) phylogenetic relationships among major acrodont groups, and
3) historical biogeography of acrodont lizards in their
higher taxonomic level.

Results
Mitogenomic features of Acrodonta

Complete or nearly complete mtDNA sequences of 5
agamid and 5 chamaeleonid species were determined for
this study (Table 1). These sequences, together with previously reported mitogenomic sequences for 4 agamids
[24-27] and 7 chamaeleonids [28,29], were used to characterize features of acrodontan mitogenomes. The
acrodontan mitogenomes contained 37 genes that show
clear sequence similarity to corresponding mitochondrial
genes from other vertebrates. Anticodon sequences of
tRNA genes were identical to those of other vertebrates
with an exception.
The anticodon triplet sequence of mitochondrial
tRNAPro genes is usually 5'-TGG-3' [30]. Thus, an
unmodified uridine is likely to be present at the first anticodon base of mature tRNAPros that are responsible for
decoding all four CCN codons [31]. So far, only unmodified uridine in this position is considered to be capable of
pairing with all four bases at the third codon positions,
while modification of the uridine leads to decoding only
partial codon members of the 4-codon boxes [31].
Calotes versicolor, a member of Draconinae, had the 5'TGG-3' anticodon in the tRNAPro gene. However, Acanthosaura armata, another representative of Draconinae,
was found to have a 5'-CGG-3' anticodon. This is not a
sequencing error, for the same 5'-CGG-3' sequence was
found in the second individual of A. armata and an individual of Acanthosaura lepidogaster (data not shown). At
present, we do not know how the CCN codons, all of
which appear frequently in protein-coding genes of A.
armata mtDNA, are decoded by products of this aberrant tRNAPro gene and/or possibly imported proline
tRNAs from cytosol. Unknown modification or editing
starting from cytidine at the first anticodon position may
be responsible for this.
Figure 1 summarizes gene arrangement changes found
in acrodontan mitogenomes. First, all these mitogenomes
shared a tRNA gene rearrangement from IQM to QIM
[23] that is not present in the iguanid mitogenomes
[18,32,33], supporting that this gene rearrangement took
place in the ancestral acrodontan lineage after its divergence from Iguanidae [23].
Acrodontan mitogenomes show extensive variations in
the location and orientation of the tRNAPro gene, which is
typically encoded by the light strand and located between
the tRNAThr gene and the CR in most other vertebrates
(Fig. 1). All the chamaeleonids examined possess the
tRNAPro gene at the 3' side of the CR, 200-400 bp 5' to the
tRNAPhe gene (see Fig. 2 and Additional File 1). The translocated tRNAPro gene accompanies two different types of
AT-rich regions around it (see below). Among agamids,
the tRNAPro gene was found in the typical location and

orientation for representatives from Uromastycinae,
Leiolepidinae, Amphibolurinae and Hydrosaurinae. Two
representatives from Draconinae (C. versicolor and A.
armata) had an inverted tRNAPro gene (i.e., the switch of
an encoded strand from L to H without changing its relative location to other genes and the CR), which was originally found by Amer and Kumazawa [24]. Finally, the
tRNAPro gene was translocated immediately 5' to the
tRNAPhe gene in two representatives from Agaminae (P.
sinaitus and X. taylori)[26]. Thus, these anomalies in the
position and orientation of tRNAPro gene were found in a
lineage specific manner. Another example of specific
changes in the gene arrangement or features was seen in
two representatives from Australasian agamid subfamily
Amphibolurinae (P. vitticeps and C. kingii), in which
duplicate CR sequences are inserted between ND5 and
ND6 genes [25,27]. On the other hand, the characteristic
stem-and-loop structure for the putative light-strand replication origin is known to have disappeared from the
WANCY tRNA gene cluster in multiple agamid lineages
[34]. Among the 31 iguanian taxa examined, all iguanid
and chamaeleonid taxa retained this structure, whereas
Uromastyx benti, Hydrosaurus amboinensis and two
amphibolurine agamids did not have it.
Control regions of chamaeleonid mitogenomes were
considerably longer than agamid and iguanid counterparts. The average length of the CR was 2506 bp among
10 chameleons, while that was 1132 and 1695 bp, respectively, among 9 agamids and 8 iguanids (Table 1). Figure 2
shows the schematic diagram of the chamaeleonid CRs.
As seen for mammals (e.g., [35]), Domain 1 contains
ETAS (extended termination associated sequences) elements and tandemly repeated sequences. Domain 2 contains the central conserved region in which conserved
boxes C, D and F [36] are identified (Fig. 2 and Additional
File 1). Domain 3 contains conserved sequence blocks
(CSBs) I and III [37] and two types of AT-rich sequences.
The first type, that occurs 5' to the tRNAPro gene, is characterized by repetition of a stretch of A followed by a
stretch of T, (AxTy)n, and the second type found mostly 3'
to the tRNAPro gene (except for Brookesia decaryi in
which it also occurs 5' to the tRNAPro gene) is a repetition
of an AT sequence, (AT)n. Although these two types can
also be seen in non-chamaeleonid CRs (see, e.g., [38]),
they occur in chamaeleonids in much larger scales. Moreover, chameleon CRs, except for T. melleri, were found to
have a long array of tandemly repeated sequences 5' to
the ETAS regions in Domain 1 (Additional File 1). Taken
together, the expanded size of chamaeleonid CRs is primarily due to tandem repetitions in Domain 1 but this is
also due to the extensive arrays of the two types of ATrich sequences in Domain 3.

Phylogenetic analyses

Figure 3 shows a Bayesian tree constructed using mitogenomic nucleotide sequences. Non-iguanian parts of the
tree were largely consistent with results by previous studies using mitochondrial [28,39] and nuclear [16,40-42]
gene sequences. Four saurian infraorders (Iguania, Gekkota, Scincomorpha and Anguimorpha) were recognized
but Iguania did not represent the earliest shoot-off
among them in sharp contrast with conclusions from
morphological studies [2,9]. Iguania consistently clusters
with Anguimorpha in these molecular studies including
ours. As reported previously [18], Madagascan oplurine
iguanids (i.e., Oplurus grandidieri and Chalarodon madagascariensis) diverged first within Iguanidae sensu lato,
forming a sister group of other Neotropical iguanids.
Iguanidae forms a sister group of Acrodonta in which
Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae are both monophyletic
and sister to each other (Fig. 3). These results were supported with 1.00 Bayesian posterior probability (BayesPP) and 100% maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrap values. Macey et al. [13] recognized 6 major clades in
Agamidae and considered them agamid subfamilies, from
which the present study includes 1-2 representative species. Within Agamidae, Uromastyx benti (Uromastycinae) diverged first and Leiolepis guttata (Leiolepidinae)
diverged next (Fig. 3). Uromastycinae and Leiolepidinae
have often been considered to be sister to each other,
making a basal clade in Agamidae [4,7,43]. Among the
other four agamid subfamilies, two representatives from
Amphibolurinae diverged first, followed by Hydrosaurus
amboinensis (Hydrosaurinae) and finally by two representatives from each of Agaminae and Draconinae (Fig.
3).
Twelve representative species that cover all 6 traditional genera of Chamaeleonidae were sampled in this
study: Brookesia, Rhampholeon (now divided into Rhampholeon and Rieppeleon [44]), Calumma, Furcifer, Bradypodion (now divided into Bradypodion, Kinyongia and
Nadzikambia [45]) and Chamaeleo (now divided into
Chamaeleo and Trioceros [46]). Our tree (Fig. 3) shows
that Brookesia decaryi and Rieppeleon kerstenii represent
basal chamaeleonid lineages but that they are not sister to
each other. Our tree also shows non-monophyly of the
traditional genus Chamaeleo. Six hornless species in the
traditional subgenus Chamaeleo (now genus Chamaeleo
[46]) appeared in an entirely different position from
horned Trioceros melleri. T. melleri forms a sister group
of Calumma parsonii and Furcifer oustalleti and all these
three taxa cluster with Kinyongia fischeri with the exclusion of the 6 hornless Chamaeleo species.
Previous studies [16,28,39] suggested highly accelerated
molecular evolutionary rates of acrodontan mitochondrial genes. This tendency was conspicuous for almost all
lineages of acrodonts and reflected by considerably lon-

Divergence times

Figure 4 shows divergence times estimated using the
mitogenomic dataset. Although there are not many squamate fossil records that can effectively constrain lower

and upper boundaries of divergences [47], we included
some available ingroup calibrations inside Squamata in
addition to relatively solid fossil-based calibrations outside Squamata. The use of the relaxed-clock method for
divergence time estimation [48] seems necessary in light
of the heterogeneity of molecular evolutionary rates

across lineages as seen by considerably longer and shorter
branch lengths from the root to tips (Fig. 3).
The results suggest Triassic-Jurassic [186-220 million
years ago (MYA) for the 95% credibility range] divergence
of Acrodonta from Iguanidae but much younger midCretaceous (96-122 MYA) divergence into Agamidae and
Chamaleonidae (Fig. 4). Agamid subfamilies may have
separated during Late Cretaceous times while chamaeleonid radiations into extant genera were estimated to have
occurred in the Cenozoic after the K/T boundary. Among
the time constraints used in the divergence time estima-

tion, only the 5<T<13 MYA divergence between African
and Arabian Chamaeleo species was based on a biogeographic assumption. In order to evaluate effects of this
ingroup calibration on divergence time estimation, we
also conducted the multidistribute analysis without this
constraint. The resultant divergence times at various
iguanian nodes (data not shown) were very similar to
those obtained including this biogeographic constraint
(Fig. 4), supporting its congruence with other older time
constraints based on fossil evidence.

Recent molecular dating with multiple nuclear genes
(reviewed in [42]), though based on different dating
methods and time constraints, suggested somewhat
younger dates for the divergence of Acrodonta from Pleurodonta (~145 MYA) and the separation into Agamidae
and Chamaeleonidae (~85 MYA). However, there is some
topological difference between the studies (e.g., nonmonophyly of Agamidae in [41]) and several different
analyses could provide at most 20 million years of confidence interval in each side of the best time estimate [41].
Thus, the nuclear time estimates for the AgamidaeChamaeleonidae split may partly overlap our mitochondrial estimate (96-122 MYA, Fig. 4).

Discussion
Structural evolution of acrodontan mitogenomes

In the present study, mitogenomic sequences were collected from major representative lineages of Acrodonta
to provide an opportunity to compare mitogenomic
structures among three iguanian families. Iguanid mitogenomes were very conservative with no gene rearrangements. They also appear to have evolved much more
slowly than agamid and chamaeleonid counterparts as
judged from relatively short branch lengths within
Iguanidae (Fig. 3). On the other hand, acrodontan (especially agamid) mitogenomes have an entirely different
tendency with occasional gene rearrangements and
increased molecular evolutionary rates.
In Fig. 5, possible lineages for the mitogenomic reorganizations described here are mapped along the phylogeny
based on the parsimony criterion. Although agamid
mitogenomes have several examples of gene rearrangements, most of them can be assigned to specific lineages
without multiple parallel changes, supporting the rarity
and less homoplasious nature of mitochondrial gene rearrangements [22]. The only possible homoplasious change
is the translocation of the tRNAPro gene from the 5' to 3'
side of the CR in both Agaminae and Chamaeleonidae.
However, the tRNAPro genes in these taxa are placed in a
somewhat different genomic context; i.e., neighboring
sequences composed of two types of AT-rich sequences
are always present in the chamaeleonids (Fig. 2). This
supports that translocations of the tRNAPro gene in
agamines and chamaeleonids resulted from independent
events. Moreover, if this translocation had occurred once
in a common ancestral lineage of Agaminae and Chamaeleonidae, multiple reversals to the original location of the
tRNAPro gene must be assumed in several agamid lineages, which seems unlikely (Fig. 5). Gene rearrangements around the CR have been shown to occur
independently in multiple lineages by the canonical
duplication-and-deletion mechanism [22].
To the best of our knowledge, very few studies [38,49]
have characterized structural organization and evolution

of CRs in lizard mitogenomes. The present study shows
that a region encompassing Boxes C, D and F retains a
notable similarity among acrodonts and even among
diverse groups of vertebrates (Additional File 1). On the
other hand, acrodontan CRs do not seem to conserve
CSB II in Domain 3 and agamids do not even retain CSB
III (Additional File 1). This is in sharp contrast with CRs
of several iguanids, gekkonids and lacertids which conserve all three members of CSBs (Additional File 1; [38]),
presenting another evidence for more conservative
nature of iguanid mitogenomes than acrodontan counterparts.
Phylogenetic relationships

As outlined earlier, acrodontan phylogeny was originally
reconstructed with morphological data, which has been
evaluated with molecular data using some mitochondrial
and nuclear gene sequences. The present study addressed
this issue using the hitherto longest molecular dataset
(9,386 bp). As a trade-off of gaining the large number of
sites, we had to somewhat sacrifice the depth of taxon
sampling. It is thus important to assess monophylies of
individual groups in order to interpret our results with
respect to subfamilial or generic interrelationships.
Fortunately, previous molecular studies using a number
of taxa but less sites provided strong evidence for a number of clades in Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae. For
example, Honda et al. [12], Macey et al. [13] and Amer
and Kumazawa [50] strongly, in terms of high bootstrap
or other tree-support values, suggested monophylies of
Uromastycinae, Amphibolurinae, Draconinae and Agaminae within Agamidae. The remaining subfamilies Leiolepidinae and Hydrosaurinae contain limited numbers of
extant species and the monophyly of some leiolepidine
species was also strongly supported [13]. In addition, the
occurrence of subfamily-specific gene rearrangements
(Fig. 5; [24,25]) is consistent with the monophylies of the
corresponding groups. Within Chamaeleonidae, recent
molecular studies using multiple gene sequences [46,51]
supported the monophylies of two of the traditional six
genera (i.e., Brookesia and Furcifer). Remaining traditional genera Chamaeleo, Calumma, Bradypodion and
Rhampholeon may each be an assemblage of a few monophyletic groups [14,15,46,51] but no definitive conclusion
has been obtained on their phylogenetic relationships.
Our mitogenomic tree (Fig. 3) strongly supports the
monophyly of Agamidae relative to Chamaeleonidae
(1.00 Bayes-PP and 100% ML-BP values). This is not an
artifact due to, e.g., the long branch attraction because all
acrodontan lineages appear to possess accelerated molecular evolutionary rates relative to iguanids (Fig. 3). Morphological analyses (e.g., [7,10]) and some molecular ones
(e.g., [16,41,52]) did not support the agamid monophyly
while other molecular studies (e.g., [13,17,53]) did.

anticodon change in the tRNAPro gene is TGG to CGG (see text).

Although Agamidae has been regarded as a metataxon
under the tentative assumption of its monophyly [2,3,10],
this no longer seems necessary in light of our strong
molecular evidence on the agamid monophyly.
Mitogenomic data provided agamid subfamilial interrelationships with strong tree-support values in general
(Fig. 3). These relationships are consistent with the most
parsimonious tree obtained by Macey et al. [13] using
~1,500 bp mitochondrial gene sequences. However, the
traditional morphological view tended to unite Uromastyx and Leiolepis into a basal clade (e.g., [3]). The
Kishino-Hasegawa test (data not shown) suggested that
this sister relationship of Uromastyx and Leiolepis is
unlikely, though not rejectable (p = 0.275). The sister
group relationship of Agaminae and Draconinae is common between morphological [3] and molecular (Fig. 3)
results.
Our mitogenomic tree (Fig. 3) was consistent with
other molecular studies [14,46] with respect to the most
basal divergence of genus Brookesia and the subsequent
divergence of the Rhampholeon + Rieppeleon group.
However, this phylogenetic relationship was not clear in

Townsend and Larson [15] who used ~1,500 bp mitochondrial gene sequences for phylogenetic inference. We
conducted Bayesian analyses using combined mitochondrial gene sequences that were used by Raxworthy et al.
[14] and Townsend and Larson [15] and the results (data
not shown) also supported the most basal divergence of
Brookesia as shown in Townsend et al. [51]. Although
Brookesia (Madagascan leaf chameleons) and Rhampholeon (African leaf chameleons) were once grouped into
a common subfamily Brookesiinae [5], another morphological study based on osteological characters [6] suggested the basal divergence of Brookesia alone. Taken
together, but primarily based on our mitogenomic phylogeny (Fig. 3), we conclude that the Madagascan Brookesia represents the earliest shoot-off of extant chameleons.
The monophyly of traditional genus Chamaeleo was
strongly suggested by morphological analyses based on
distinct synapomorphies (e.g., four rotulae in a hemipenis) and it was subsequently supported by a molecular
study [14]. However, another molecular study [15] found
separate occurrence of its two subgenera (Chamaeleo and
Trioceros) in the chamaeleonid phylogeny, albeit with little statistical evaluation for their non-monophyly. The
most recent molecular study [46] showed stronger evidence for the separation of Chamaeleo and Trioceros,
proposing their elevation to distinct genera. Our mitogenomic analyses (Fig. 3) showed that Trioceros melleri is
placed distinctly from 6 representatives from Chamaeleo.
The Kishino-Hasegawa test rejected (p = 0.017) the best
tree obtained by constraining the Chamaeleo + Trioceros
monophyly (Tree 5 in Table 2, see also Additional file 2).
The more conservative Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (Table
2) did not reject this tree but its probability was very low
(p = 0.137), supporting the formal elevation of Chamaeleo and Trioceros to distinct genera [46].
Together with results on testing some specific hypotheses derived from previous morphological and molecular
analyses (Table 2), mitogenomic data seem to provide a
certain level of resolution on the chamaeleonid phylogeny. To the best of our knowledge, clustering of Furcifer
with a group of Calumma containing C. parsonii (Fig. 3)
was not suggested by previous studies. Nor was clustering
of these two taxa with Trioceros (Fig. 3). Evaluation of
these new relationships, which did not receive strong
bootstrap supports (Fig. 3), awaits further taxon sampling
of mitogenomic and/or nuclear gene data.
Historical biogeography

Previous studies on the historical biogeography of
Acrodonta did not necessarily postulate the monophylies
of Agamidae and Iguanidae. Thus, terms such as the origins of Iguania, Acrodonta and Agamidae have been confusingly used. This study provided strong evidence for the
monophylies of Agamidae and Iguanidae, with which

Page 9 of 15

previous biogeographic hypotheses can be reevaluated.
Here, we discuss the acrodontan biogeography based on
molecular, paleontological and geological evidence without a priori assumption of vicariance or dispersal (see Fig.
6).
There have been two major hypotheses on the origin of
Acrodonta, i.e., where the most recent common ancestor
of Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae was, either Laurasian
or Gondwanan. Occurrence of acrodontan priscagamid
(and even pleurodont iguanian) fossils from mid-late Cretaceous of Asia (Fig. 6.3) led some researchers to hypothesize Laurasian (more specifically Central Asian or
Mongolian) origin of Iguania and Acrodonta (e.g.,
[54,55]). A recent report of a gliding acrodont lizard
(Xianglong) from Early Cretaceous of China [56] may also
support this idea. Extant agamid lizards are distributed
primarily in Eurasia but some occur in Australasia and
Africa. Recent molecular phylogeny ([12,25,50,57]; but
see [13,58]) is consistent with a view that extant Agamidae originated from Asia and that some descendant lineages (e.g., Amphibolurinae and Uromastycinae)
dispersed to Australasia and Africa during Cenozoic
times when they were geographically connected to or in
close proximity to Eurasia. On the other hand, there is
good agreement in Gondwanan (more specifically Madagascan or African) origin of extant chamaeleonids
[5,6,14,59]. Taken together, the Laurasian origin of
Acrodonta requires the long-distance transmarine dispersal of chamaeleonid ancestors from Eurasia to Madagascar/Africa.
Gondwanan origin of Iguania was proposed by Estes
[60] based on some fossil evidence and the basal divergence of Iguania from Scleroglossa, which is not tenable
by recent molecular phylogeny. Macey et al. [13] used
molecular phylogeny to advocate the Gondwanan origin
of Acrodonta and proposed that major acrodontan lineages diverged vicariantly and/or migrated to the Northern Hemisphere by plate tectonics (i.e., collision of Indian
subcontinent or other Gondwanan land blocks to Eurasia). Although a recent molecular study [17] further supported the out-of-India radiation of a subfamily
Agaminae, other molecular studies [25,50,57] questioned
the Gondwanan vicariance or multiple northward migrations for at least some lineages (e.g., Amphibolurinae and
Uromastycinae).
More recently, some fossil evidence shed a light on this
issue. Bharatagama from Early-Middle Jurassic Kota Formation of India (Fig. 6.2) represents the oldest record of
early acrodont iguanians [61]. This fossil record may support the Gondwanan origin of acrodonts [47,61]. If acrodonts did originate from Gondwanaland, it is consistent
with the likely Gondwanan origin of Iguanidae sensu lato
([18]; refs. therein) but ancestors of extant agamids,
which were postulated to be in Asia (see above), may

need to have migrated from the Southern to Northern
Hemisphere by transmarine dispersal.
The present study (Fig. 4) suggested that Agamidae and
Chamaeleonidae are each monophyletic and that they
diverged from each other in the mid-Cretaceous (96-122
MYA) although independent molecular dating using
nuclear genes suggested somewhat younger dates around
85 MYA [42]. Okajima and Kumazawa [18] previously
showed that the appreciable gap in the estimated divergence time of oplurine iguanids between mitochondrial
[18] and nuclear [62] gene sequences could be due to
multiple factors, such as differences in the tree topology
and time constraints assumed for each study, the intrinsic
data property of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences,
and relatively poor squamate fossil records [47] that can
be used to constrain ingroup squamate divergences precisely.
In spite of this somewhat low precision of time estimation, the molecular dating results (Fig. 4; [42]) consistently suggest that Agamidae and Chamaeleonidae were
separated after the Middle-Late Jurassic break-up of Pangea into Laurasia and Gondwanaland (Fig. 6.2) and when
the latter two supercontinents were further fragmented
by plate tectonics [63]. Geological data suggest that India
and Madagascar were drifted from Gondwanaland in the
Early Cretaceous (120-130 MYA)(Fig. 6.3) and separated
from each other in the Late Cretaceous (~90 MYA)(Fig.
6.4)[63]. Then, India moved northward and accreted to
Eurasia from the latest Cretaceous to Eocene (Fig.
6.5)[63].
Assuming Gondwanan origin of Acrodonta, the molecular dating results (96-122 MYA from Fig. 4 and ~85

MYA from [42] for the divergence of Agamidae and
Chamaeleonidae) are consistent with a view that Agamidae vicariantly diverged from Chamaeleonidae on the
India/Madagascar landmass. It may be further hypothesized that Agamidae migrated to Eurasia on the drifting
Indian subcontinent (Fig. 6.5) while Chamaeleonidae was
left within Madagascar and its descendants migrated to
Africa over Mozambique Channel and later to Eurasia
(Fig. 6.6). Molecular dating (Fig. 4) suggested that extant
chamaeleonid genera diverged during Cenozoic times.
Some of them are distributed exclusively in Madagascar
(Furcifer, Calumma and Brookesia) while the others are
distributed in Africa (Rhampholeon/Rieppeleon and Bradypodion/Kinyongia/Nadzikambia) or in Africa + Eurasia
(Chamaeleo/Trioceros). Because Africa and Madagascar
had been clearly separated in the Cenozoic [63], generic
radiations of chamaeleonids cannot be associated with
Gondwanan vicariance. As previous authors postulated
[14,15], chamaeleonids are likely to have experienced
transmarine dispersal over Mozambique Channel multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, the oldest certain
fossil record of Chamaeleonidae is Chamaeleo caroliquarti from western Bohemia [64]. Africa had long been
isolated from other continents but connected to Eurasia
in the Miocene [63]. Thus, occurrence of this fossil in the
Miocene of Europe is consistent with the above-mentioned biogeographic explanation.
Molecular dating (Fig. 4) also suggested that extant
agamid subfamilies diverged from each other in the Late
Cretaceous. If Agamidae did migrate to Eurasia on India
as hypothesized above, the dating result suggests that
subfamilial radiations of agamids occurred on the drifting

Figure 6 The historical biogeography of acrodont lizards based on the molecular, paleontological and geological evidence. Paleogeographical maps at six different times [63] are shown on which a hypothesis on the origin and migration pathways for agamids (red) and chamaeleonids
(blue) is illustrated. The earliest fossil records for acrodonts and chameleons are, respectively, Early-Middle Jurassic (165 - 200 MYA) Bharatoagama from
the Kota Formation of India [61] and Miocene (~26 MYA) Chamaeleo caroliquarti from Bohemia [64]. Acrodont fossils of Priscagamidae are found from
Aptian-Albian (100 - 120 MYA) and Campanian (~80 MYA) Central Asia and Mongolia [43,54,55]. Another acrodont fossil of a gliding lizard Xianglong
is found from Early Cretaceous of China [56].

Indian subcontinent. This may sound somewhat unlikely
but this is not impossible under the assumption that a
number of ancient agamid lineages radiated, dispersed
locally in Asia, and became extinct. Vastanagama susani
and Tinosaurus indicus from the Early Eocene of India
are known as the earliest certain agamid fossils in South
Asia [65].
Then, how can this hypothesis based on Gondwanan
origin of extant acrodont groups reconcile with the early
Cretaceous Xianglong and mid-late Cretaceous priscagamid acrodonts from Laurasian sites (Central Asia and
Mongolia)? Xianglong and priscagamids are stem acrodont lizards which are unlikely to be nested within extant
agamids but their exact phylogenetic positions are not yet
known [56,66]. Therefore, they probably diverged from a
long branch of stem acrodonts 110-200 MYA (see Fig. 4).
These extinct groups may be Laurasian relics of acrodont
lizards which had diverged from Gondwanan acrodonts
(i.e., direct common ancestors of extant agamids and
chamaeleonids) before Pangean break-up into Laurasia
and Gondwanaland. Alternatively, they may simply have
derived from the Gondwanan ancestors by transmarine
dispersal.

Conclusions
In the present study, mitogenomic sequences collected
from major acrodontan lineages were analyzed in comparison with iguanid counterparts. We detected distinct
modes of mitogenomic evolution among iguanian fami-

lies. Agamidae was highlighted in including a number of
lineage-specific mitochondrial gene rearrangements and
Chamaeleonidae was found to have a much longer CR
sequences. Although mitogenomes of these two families
appear to evolve at accelerated rates, they still retain certain conserved features in CR sequences.
Our mitogenomic data provided a certain level of resolution in reconstructing acrodontan phylogeny, although
there still remain ambiguous relationships. The strong
support for the agamid monophyly should influence taxonomic treatment of the metataxon Agamidae and the
suggested separation of Trioceros from Chamaeleo would
support elevation of these taxa to distinct genera [46].
More resolution in unsettled acrodontan phylogenies
should be sought by sequencing and comparing considerably longer regions of nuclear genomes than ever.
In this study acrodontan biogeography was reevaluated
mostly in favor of Gondwanan origin of Acrodonta,
which was originally proposed by Estes [60] and Macey et
al. [13]. We suggest that the whole extant Agamidae may
have migrated to Eurasia with India. However, we do not
agree to the possibility that all or most of agamid subfamilies were introduced to Eurasia, Australasia or Africa by
the accretion of Gondwanan plates at different times [13].
Finally, we should carefully state that molecular data
and our arguments presented herein do not strictly rule
out the Laurasian origin of Acrodonta [54,55] under the
assumption that the long-distance transmarine dispersal
of chamaeleonid ancestor(s) from Laurasian sites to Mad-

agascar/Africa was possible by unknown geological settings. Further efforts in testing these hypotheses,
including ours, by diverse approaches should be encouraged in future.

Methods
Samples

Animal samples except for Pseudotrapelus sinaitus were
obtained from local animal dealers as dead specimens,
identified for their species name, and registered to public
museums or the Specimen Depository of a university
(Table 1). Samples for P. sinaitus were collected at Bir
Abraq, Egypt. Total DNA was extracted from a tiny
amount of tissue samples either with a DNeasy Tissue kit
(Qiagen) or by the procedure of Asahida et al. [67]. When
multiple individuals were available for the same species,
we chose an individual having the best DNA quality for
sequencing the entire mitogenome. We then used
another individual for sequencing short mtDNA regions
to confirm that mtDNA sequences from the second individual are identical or nearly identical to those from the
first individual. This is a test for the reliability and reproducibility of our experiments.
Mitochondrial DNA sequencing

Determination of complete mtDNA sequences was carried out essentially as described previously [19]. Several
pairs of reptile-oriented primers [19] were used to
amplify and sequence different gene segments of mtDNAs. Species-specific primers (data not shown) were
then designed in these regions for amplifying longer parts
of the mtDNA by the long PCR using LA-Taq or Z-Taq
(Takara, Inc). We typically covered the entire mtDNA by
a few overlapping long PCR products. The long-PCR
products were used as templates for nested PCR amplifications using the various reptile-oriented primers with ZTaq, giving rise to overlapping 0.6-1.3 kbp products. The
complete mtDNA sequences were unambiguously determined by sequencing and assembling these shorter PCR
products. For some of the species, the CR contained
extensive tandem repeats and we could not sequence a
part of the CR (see Table 1).
Gene identification and data alignment

Protein gene sequences were translated into amino acid
sequences with the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic
code [36]. The starting and ending sites of these genes
were determined by comparison with the corresponding
genes from other vertebrates and in consideration of the
possible creation of the stop codon by polyadenylation.
Transfer RNA genes were identified based on their secondary structure models [30]. Ranges of the small and
large rRNA genes were tentatively identified by tRNA
genes that surround them. The major noncoding region

Page 12 of 15

was regarded as the CR as it contains CSBs [37]. In this
way, all 37 genes and the CR were identified for each of
the new mtDNA sequences.
Nucleotide sequences for each of the 37 genes were
aligned among the newly sequenced 10 taxa and 39 other
vertebrates (see Table 1 and Additional File 3 for their
taxon names and accession numbers). The MacClade
alignment files for each of the 37 genes can be obtained
from authors upon request. We used a script written by
Mr. Pierre Jonniaux and Dr. Takamasa Suzuki, with which
individual genes of the reported mitogenomic sequences
were automatically taken from the databases into a fasta
file. This facilitated quick and accurate sequence manipulations. Note that Kinyongia fischeri mtDNA has recently
been sequenced by Macey et al. [29] independently and
that we used our K. fischeri mtDNA sequence for subsequent analyses. Also note that Brookesia superciliaris
mtDNA sequence reported by Macey et al. [29] was not
used due to its incompleteness (~12 kbp). The outgroup
taxa were selected from one or two representatives from
major vertebrate groups, such as Amphibia, Mammalia,
Aves, Gekkota and Anguimorpha, except for possibly
non-monophyletic Scincomorpha (3 representatives). We
omitted some taxa (e.g., snakes and dibamids) that have
not been placed in the squamate phylogeny securely
when estimated with complete mitogenomic sequences
[21,28,39,68].
Protein gene sequences were aligned first for their
amino acid sequences with the aid of ClustalX [69], with
which nucleotide sequences were automatically aligned
using the 'Import NBRF Protein Alignment' function of
MacClade 4 (Sinauer Associates, Inc). Transfer RNA and
rRNA genes were aligned with the aid of their secondary
structure models [30,70]. Nucleotide sequences of the
first and second codon positions of 12 heavy-strandencoded protein genes (except for the light-strandencoded ND6 gene due to its deviated nucleotide and
amino acid compositions), 22 tRNA genes, and 2 rRNA
genes were concatenated for 31 iguanians and 18 noniguanian vertebrates. At the level of deep-branch phylogenies of this study, nucleotides at third codon positions
clearly accumulate considerable multiple hits (data not
shown) and they were removed from phylogenetic analyses. Because the mitochondrial genome of the tuatara
lacks three genes including the largest protein-coding
gene for ND5 [71], phylogenetic analyses were primarily
conducted without the tuatara after removing all gapcontaining sites (48 taxa, 9,386 sites in total).
Phylogenetic analyses

The Bayesian method was mainly used for constructing
phylogenetic relationships. For the Bayesian analyses,
MrBayes v3.12 [72] was used with the GTR+I+G model
selected by MrModeltest 2.2 [73] after separating the data

Okajima and Kumazawa BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:141
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/141

into four partitions (first codon positions, second codon
positions, rRNA positions and tRNA positions). Four
chains were run simultaneously by Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) process until the ASDSF (average standard deviation of split frequency) index [72] becomes less
than 0.01 (2,500,000 generations). After the initial one
fourth of the generations were discarded based on the
stationarity of the MCMC process at this stage, 18,750
trees were collected from every 100 generations. The 50%
majority -rule consensus tree was created from this tree
pool and the Bayes-PP values (the frequency of a specific
phylogenetic relationship in the sampled tree population)
were obtained as a statistical measure for resultant phylogenetic relationships.
We conducted several phylogenetic analyses using different representative taxa from each major group of vertebrates to confirm that taxon selection in the outgroup
does not basically change ingroup acrodont relationships
(data not shown). As one of such analyses, the Bayesian
tree reconstructed with another taxon, the tuatara (Additional File 4), showed the same acrodont relationships as
in Fig. 3 although a polytomy occurred with respect to
subfamilial relationships of Iguanidae sensu lato. We also
tested some different partition schemes including the one
categorizing protein genes into four different enzyme
complexes [68] to confirm that our phylogenetic tree was
not affected by such partition scheme (data not shown).
Bootstrap probabilities were assessed by the ML
method using GARLI0.96b8 [74] with the GTR+I+G
model. The same dataset as used for the Bayesian analysis
was supplied without partitioning and 500 replications
were carried out. Statistical evaluation of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses was done with TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
[75] using the Kishino-Hasegawa [76] and ShimodairaHasegawa [77] tests. The GTR+I+G model and its parameters optimized by MrModeltest 2.2 were used.
Estimation of divergence times

Divergence times were estimated with the multidistribute
program [48] by assuming a topological relationship thus
obtained but without assuming the strict molecular
clock. The program PAML [78] was first used to optimize
parameters for the F84 nucleotide substitution model and
the gamma distribution for 8 categories for each of the
four partitions separately. The estbranches/multidivtime
programs were then run by the Bayesian MCMC method
to provide posterior distributions of divergence times at
each internal node. Several parameters set to run the
MCMC analyses were: numsamps, 10,000; sampfreq, 100;
burnin, 100,000; rttm and rttmsd, 4.3; rtrate and rtratesd,
0.05; and brownmean and brownmeansd, 0.2. The coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) was used as an outgroup in
this analysis. We conducted the divergence time estimation with different settings for taxon samplings (e.g.,

Page 13 of 15

more sparse sampling from Iguanidae and non-iguanians), time constraints (i.e., addition/deletion of some of
the seven time constraints used) and some parameters
(e.g., brownmean/brownsd and bigtime) to confirm that
results were essentially the same.
Similar time constraints for divergence times as used by
Okajima and Kumazawa [18] were employed. They are
based on relatively reliable fossil-based time constraints
for several representative nodes: Amphibia vs. Amniota,
340<T<370 MYA; Synapsida vs. Sauropsida (Reptiles +
Aves), 288<T<338 MYA; Archosauria vs. Lepidosauria,
255<T<305 MYA; Aves vs. Crocodylia, 240<T<260 MYA;
Acrodonta vs. Pleurodonta, 165<T MYA; and origin of
Scincomorpha, 160<T MYA. Refer to Okajima and
Kumazawa [18] and Kumazawa [28] for references that
justify these time constraints. In addition to these time
constraints, we also included a time constraint for a shallower divergence between African and Arabian chameleons within genus Chamaeleo. The time constraint for
this divergence (5<T<13 MYA) was based on the biogeographic assumption that they diverged vicariantly by the
expansion of Red Sea [29] (see [50] for geological evidence for this time range).
