Abstract
Background: Extraordinary size variation of higher plant nuclear genomes is in large part caused
by differences in accumulation of repetitive DNA. This makes repetitive DNA of great interest for
studying the molecular mechanisms shaping architecture and function of complex plant genomes.
However, due to methodological constraints of conventional cloning and sequencing, a global
description of repeat composition is available for only a very limited number of higher plants. In
order to provide further data required for investigating evolutionary patterns of repeated DNA
within and between species, we used a novel approach based on massive parallel sequencing which
allowed a comprehensive repeat characterization in our model species, garden pea (Pisum sativum).
Results: Analysis of 33.3 Mb sequence data resulted in quantification and partial sequence
reconstruction of major repeat families occurring in the pea genome with at least thousands of
copies. Our results showed that the pea genome is dominated by LTR-retrotransposons, estimated
at 140,000 copies/1C. Ty3/gypsy elements are less diverse and accumulated to higher copy
numbers than Ty1/copia. This is in part due to a large population of Ogre-like retrotransposons
which alone make up over 20% of the genome. In addition to numerous types of mobile elements,
we have discovered a set of novel satellite repeats and two additional variants of telomeric
sequences. Comparative genome analysis revealed that there are only a few repeat sequences
conserved between pea and soybean genomes. On the other hand, all major families of pea mobile
elements are well represented in M. truncatula.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that even in a species with a relatively large genome like pea,
where a single 454-sequencing run provided only 0.77% coverage, the generated sequences were
sufficient to reconstruct and analyze major repeat families corresponding to a total of 35–48% of
the genome. These data provide a starting point for further investigations of legume plant genomes
based on their global comparative analysis and for the development of more sophisticated
approaches for data mining.

Background
Understanding evolutionary mechanisms shaping com-

plex genomes of eukaryotes is impossible without thorough investigation of repeated genomic sequences [1-4].

This is especially obvious in higher plants, where repetitive sequences comprise up to 97% of nuclear DNA [5,6]
and contribute significantly to the extraordinary genome
size variation observed between different taxa [7-9]. However, the presence of numerous and sequentially diverse
families of repetitive elements make their analysis a challenging task. Thus, the most widely used approaches to
study the contribution of repetitive DNA to genome evolution are based on isolation and characterization of only
a single or a small group of elements. These approaches
have been valuable in following the fate of various repeats
in a wide range of species [10-12]. However, they do not
allow for the global comparative analysis of repeat profiles required for elucidating evolutionary trends on the
whole genome level. The demand for a comprehensive
repeat analysis prompted the development of a DNA
microarray-based assay to study the occurrence of hundreds of repeats in twenty plant genomes [13]. Although
successful, the microarray-based approach still suffered
from several limitations including the need for a priori
knowledge of the repeat sequences, the limited capacity of
the array, and especially the inability to discover novel
repeats for which there were no probes on the array.
The requirement for simultaneous determination of
sequence composition and abundance of hundreds of
repeat families is best fulfilled by analyzing the complete
genome sequence; however, such data is available for only
a limited number of model species. Alternatively, lowdepth shotgun genomic sequencing can be used to survey
the most abundant repeats, as was demonstrated for Gossypium species [9]. However, performing this type of survey using conventional approaches employing Sanger
sequencing is still labor-intensive and requires considerable resources. The recent introduction of a massively-parallel pyrosequencing technology developed by 454 Life
Sciences ("454-sequencing") has opened new possibilities
for high-throughput genome analysis [14]. This approach
allows parallel sequencing of hundreds of thousands of
individual templates immobilized on microbeads, thus
producing megabases of sequence data in a single run. It
has been successfully applied to the sequencing of microbial genomes [15], the re-sequencing of mammalian
genomes [16], and for transcript profiling [17]. Due to relatively short sequence read lengths (~100 nucleotides on
average, or ~250 nucleotides with the improved version of
the system), the technology is not yet suitable for de novo
sequencing of complex genomes. However, it has a great
potential for profiling repetitive sequences in these
genomes, as the amount of produced sequence data is sufficient to get a representative overview of the most abundant genomic repeats. For example, a total of 30 Mb
determined in a single sequencing run represents only
0.01-fold coverage of a hypothetical 3,000 Mb genome
(this is about the haploid genome size of maize or cotton

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

[18]), but provides 10-fold coverage of repeats occurring
in the genome in 1,000 copies. The sum of 30 Mb is represented by a set of 300,000 sequence reads which are randomly generated from various genomic loci.
Theoretically, they should contain fragments of a given
repeat randomly sampled from its individual copies, and
the frequency of these fragments in the sequence reads
should be proportional to the genomic abundance of the
repeat. Therefore, this amount of sequence data should be
sufficient to reliably detect abundant (at least 500–1000
copies/1C) genomic repeats, and eventually reconstruct
their consensus sequences by assembling the reads
derived from their individual copies. Recently, this strategy has been successfully applied to repeat analysis in the
1,115 Mb genome of soybean [19].
Based on the theoretical considerations described above,
we attempted to adapt parallel sequencing technology for
the genome-wide characterization of repetitive elements
in garden pea (Pisum sativum L.) and for comparative analysis of its repeat composition with other species. In addition to being a classical model for genetic studies, pea is
also one of the model species used in our and other laboratories for studying the impact of repetitive DNA on legume plant genomes. Consequently, a set of wellcharacterized pea repetitive elements is available [20-24]
which could serve as a control in evaluating the accuracy
of the developed assays. Pea has a genome of 4,300 Mb/
1C [18], which is about 10-fold larger than the genome
size of rice or the model legume Medicago truncatula, and
about 4-fold larger than the soybean genome. Compared
to these species, it is rich in repetitive DNA, which was
estimated to comprise 75–97% of its nuclear DNA [5,6].
Our initial experiments were aimed at evaluating the representation of known repeats in 454 sequence reads. Then
we focused on the reconstruction of longer segments of
repetitive sequences from multiple overlapping sequence
reads, which provided a basis for their further characterization. These data were used to determine the genomic
abundance and variability of the major repeat families
present in the pea genome. Finally, we used the pea
sequence data together with available soybean and M.
truncatula sequences to perform comparative analysis of
the repeat composition and abundance in these three legume species.

Results
A single 454 sequencing reaction with pea nuclear DNA
resulted in 319,402 usable reads with an average length of
104 nucleotides, yielding a total of 33.3 Mb of sequence
data. This is equivalent to 0.77%, or 1/129, of the haploid
pea genome (1C = 4,300 Mb). Thus, in theory, repeats
occurring at 1,000 copies or greater in the pea genome
should be well represented in these sequences, as they

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

should be covered on average by 7–8 sequence reads
(1000/129 = 7.8) over their entire length. In order to test
this assumption, we determined the representation of previously characterized pea repeats in the 454 data by
sequence similarity searches against a database of individual sequence reads and calculated their average coverage
by highly significant hits. As expected, low-copy or moderately repeated sequences, such as Zaba MITEs (50–500
copies/1C [22]), were represented by none or only a few
hits. However, all 33 of the tested sequences with an
abundance exceeding 1,000 copies/1C were well represented in 454 data, and their coverage by sequence reads
was proportional to their abundance in the genome. The
copy numbers of individual repeats calculated from the
frequency of their occurrence in 454 reads were in a good
agreement with estimates based on other experimental
data (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1). These findings prove
that the 454 data are representative for highly repeated
sequences and thus can be further used for investigation
and comprehensive description of this fraction of the pea
genome.

Comparisonthe the repeatbased numbers frequency in experiComparison of the repeat copy numbers determined
experimentally to the estimates based on their frequency in 454 reads. The comparison was performed for a
set of previously characterized repetitive elements [20–24]
including fragments of retrotransposon coding regions (gagpol) and long terminal repeats (LTR), tandem repeats (TR),
MITEs, and dispersed repeats of unknown origin (other).

gram package originally designed for clustering large EST
datasets [25]. The procedure consisted of two steps: (i)
clustering the reads based on their mutual similarities into
groups of overlapping sequences, and (ii) assembling the
reads within the clusters to get longer fragments (contigs)
representing consensus sequences. Various clustering and
assembly parameters were evaluated in order to get optimal performance with our dataset, which compared to
ESTs differed in the short reading lengths and in their considerable sequence variability, reflecting the divergence
between individual copies of repeated elements. While
the clustering parameters allowed for grouping of relatively divergent sequences, the assembly process was more
stringent, and thus typically generated multiple contigs
from a single cluster.
The clustering resulted in 22,445 clusters, which were
composed from two to thousands of reads. The assembly
phase then yielded 25,384 contigs ranging in lengths up
to 8,214 bp. Individual contigs were assembled from two
to 4,327 reads, and the total number of sequence reads
assembled into contigs was 233,303 (73 %). The contigs
were characterized by their read depth (RD), expressing
the average number of reads assembled over individual
positions within the contig consensus sequence, and by
their genome representation (GR), calculated as RD multiplied by the contig length. These values allowed us to
rate the contig sequences based on their genomic copy
numbers and proportion in the genome, respectively.
Most contigs were short and composed of only a few
reads, whereas 90% of assembled reads were assigned into
a relatively small subset of 1,578 contigs with the highest
GR, thus corresponding to highly repetitive sequences.
Most repeats were represented as sets of overlapping contigs, the number of which was proportional to the
sequence diversity of the repeat copies. Among the most
important in terms of their genomic abundance were contigs that included coding sequences and conserved LTR
regions of Ogre retrotransposons and other LTR-retroelements and of the satellite repeat PisTR-B (Additional file
2). Compared to the three previously sequenced pea Ogre
elements [21], this set of Ogre-like contigs showed much
higher sequence diversity, suggesting they represent several distinct Ogre subfamilies.
The longest contig (CL2Contig6) represented a 8,214 bp
fragment of the rDNA gene cluster, including the complete 18-5.8-25S gene sequences (5,820 bp) surrounded
by 3' and 5' parts of large intergenic spacer (Fig. 2A). Comparison to previously published partial pea rDNA
sequences revealed its identity with a 1,723 bp fragment
of the 18S rRNA gene [GenBank: U43011] and 99.5%
similarity to a 620 bp sequence region including the 5.8S
rRNA gene and both internal transcribed spacers [GenBank: AY839340].

by parts of LTR sequences, which could be further
extended by finding and aligning overlapping contigs
(Fig. 2B). The internal region contained a gag-pol coding
sequence (4,368 bp) devoid of stop codons.

The highest read depth (193 reads, corresponding to
about 25,000 copies/1C) was found for a 1,213 bp contig
CL1Contig751 representing the LTR sequence of a novel
Ty1/copia element designated Ps-copia-1/751. The element reconstruction from ten overlapping contigs
resulted in identification of the complete LTR and most of
the internal region including open reading frame encoding gag-pol polyprotein (Fig. 2C).

The region devoid of stop codons encoding gag-pol was identified in frame +3. Yellow bars depict length and relative positions of the overlapping contigs, stop codons are represented
by red vertical lines.

The contig with the highest genome representation was a
5,097 bp fragment of the LTR-retrotransposon Peabody
[GenBank: AF083074]. This contig (CL1Contig2066) had
a read depth corresponding to 11,000 copies/1C and was
estimated to make up 1.3% of the pea genome. It included
a complete internal retrotransposon region surrounded

In addition to highly repeated sequences it was also possible to at least partially reconstruct less abundant repeats,
many of which were novel to the pea genome. For example, an over 7 kb region of a MuDR-like DNA transposon,
including 2 putative coding regions, could be reconstructed from 25 overlapping contigs. MuDR elements
were estimated to occur in about 2,200 copies in the pea
genome, and similar abundance was also found for
another DNA transposon family, En/Spm, for which it
was possible to reconstruct a 3 kb fragment of the transposase-coding region (not shown).
The clustering and contig building procedure was also
found useful for identifying novel tandemly repeated
sequences. Assembling overlapping reads into longer contigs facilitated reconstruction of repeats with monomers
exceeding the length of single reads and allowed their
identification based on the tandem subrepeats present
within the contigs. A number of contigs representing
potential satellite repeats with monomers from 50 to 867
bp were identified; except for the previously described
PisTR-B satellite [20], they all represented novel
sequences. Fourteen of the most abundant repeats (Table
1) were used as probes for in situ hybridization on pea
mitotic chromosomes in order to test if they have a
genomic distribution typical for satellite DNA. Such
hybridization patterns, consisting of signals concentrated
into limited number of spots corresponding to long arrays
of the satellite sequences, were observed for thirteen
repeats, whereas only one produced dispersed signals
(Fig. 3A–C and Table 1). The signals occurred mostly in
(peri-) centromeric and terminal chromosome regions,
and each repeat displayed a specific hybridization pattern.
No typical centromeric satellite repeats were found,
although the repeat TR-11 strongly labeled central centromeric regions in five out of the seven chromosome pairs
(Fig. 3B).

Composition of the most repetitive fraction of the pea
genome
Using a combination of various tools including sequence
similarity searches, conserved protein domain detection,
and structure analysis of the contigs, it was possible to
assign the most abundant reconstructed sequences into
specific classes of repetitive elements (Table 2 and Additional file 3). It was found that the majority of pea repetitive DNA is made up of LTR-retrotransposons, with the
most prominent group being the Ty3/gypsy-like Ogre elements, which alone were estimated to constitute 20–33%
of the genome. Investigation of the sequence variability of
contigs representing overlapping fragments of Ogre
sequences revealed the presence of several subfamilies of
these elements. Further analysis based on quantification
of the sequence reads from contig regions that include the
primer binding site (PBS) typical for Ogres [26] and comparison of their surrounding sequences confirmed the
occurrence of three distinct subfamilies. It also provided
an estimate of their abundance, which was about 30,000

elements for each of the two major subfamilies and 8,000
copies/1C for a minor one.
Although other retroelement families were found in considerably smaller numbers, there were several elements
which made up significant proportions of the genome.
They included Peabody, which made up 2–3% of the
genome and displayed very low sequence variability suggesting its recent amplification. Other important groups
of Ty3/gypsy elements were represented by PIGY [24] and
Cyclops [27]. Ty1/copia retrotransposons were found to
be less frequent, being represented by PDR [28] and a
group of SIRE1-like sequences [29]. However, the most
abundant was a novel element, Ps-copia-1/751 (Fig. 2C),
which made up about 2% of the pea genome. The LTR
sequence of this element was estimated to occur in at least
25,000 copies in the pea genome, whereas other regions
are less frequent (about 8,000 copies/1C), thus indicating
the existence of a large number of solo-LTRs derived from
this element (Table 2).

Overall diversity of retrotransposons was also studied by
their classification based on the RT domains, which are
conserved enough to be reliably identified based on protein similarity searches with RT domains from already
known retrotransposons. The searches resulted in finding
452 contigs with similarity to RT domains (E-value <=
0.001). Of them, 222 contigs were related to Ty1/copia,
217 to Ty3/gypsy, and only 13 to LINE retrotransposons.
Only four Ty1/copia-like and seven Ty3/gypsy-like contigs
spanned full-length RT domains as defined by [30] while
the rest contained partial sequences due to the short
length and/or termination within the RT domain. Phylogenetic analysis of RT sequences belonging to Ty1/copia
and Ty3/gypsy groups revealed that most Ty3/gypsy-like
RT domains are related to the previously described pea retrotransposon families Ogre, Peabody, PIGY and Cyclops
(Additional file 4). On the other hand, Ty1/copia-like RT
domains were related to a greater number of retrotransposon families, most of which have not been previously
identified in the pea genome (Additional file 5). RT
domains were also used to estimate the copy number of
retrotransposons present in pea. These elements were estimated to occur in about 141,000 copies/1C, of which
46,000 (32.6 %) belong to Ty1/copia, 94,000 (67%) to
Ty3/gypsy and ~500 (0,4%) to the LINE group (Fig. 4).
The highest copy number was estimated for Ogre retrotransposons, which amplified themselves to about 64,000
copies. More detailed analysis of Ogre-like RT domains
confirmed the occurrence of distinct Ogre subfamilies
sharing their best similarities with elements from different
branches of the Ogre clade (Additional file 4). The most
abundant were subfamilies from PS and VP/VM branches
having about 24,000 and 32,000 copies, respectively
(Additional file 4 and Fig. 4). Thus, the total copy number
of Ogre elements as well as the abundance of the two
major subfamilies were in agreement with estimates based
on the abundance of PBS sites described above. Two other
clades of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, Peabody and envelope-like retrotransposons (including PIGY and Cyclops),
were estimated to have 16,000 and 12,000 copies, respectively. Although Ty1/copia retrotransposons were less frequent than Ty3/gypsy, elements from clades 3 and 5
(Additional file 5) reached high copy numbers (10,000
and 26,000 copies, respectively; Fig. 4). Interestingly,
clade 3 contained elements from Graminae species such
as barley (BARE-1), rice (RIRE-1), and oats (OARE-1) clustered together with a newly identified pea element Pscopia-1/751. Clade 5 contains elements similar to SIRE1,
an envelope-like retrotransposon from soybean [29]. It is
not clear yet, however, whether all elements within this
clade are genuine envelope-like retrotransposons, i.e.
whether they all bear envelope-like gene.
Compared to the sum of retroelement sequences, other
classes of repeats represented significantly smaller parts of

the pea genome (Table 2). Identified DNA transposons
did not exceed 0.5%, and tandem repeats including rDNA
gene clusters and various satellite sequences represented
about 2.5% of the pea genome. We have also investigated
the abundance of micro- and minisatellite repeats with
monomers from 2 to 10 bp. Since these repeats usually
occur in the genome as short stretches of repeated monomers dispersed within unrelated sequences, we analyzed
their frequency in unassembled sequence reads instead of
contigs. When considering arrays of at least five consecutive monomers, microsatellites (AAT)n, (AT)n, and (AG)n
were found to be most frequent, occurring in about
80,000 genomic loci. Other microsatellite motifs were less
abundant and there were differences over two orders of
magnitude in the frequency of various microsatellites
within the reads (data not shown).
Special attention was paid to detection of telomeric
repeats. The Arabidopsis-type telomeric sequence
(TTTAGGG)n [31] was present in 14 reads, with an average
number of 18 repetitions per read. This gives a rough estimate of about 229 kb of this sequence in the pea genome,
and agrees with experimental observations of this repeat
at termini of all chromosomes (data not shown). However, two additional telomere-like repeats were found in
the analyzed reads – (TTAGG)n and (TTTAGG)n. Although
both were less frequent than the Arabidopsis-type repeat,

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:427

their sequences also spanned the whole reads, suggesting
they occur in the genome as longer contiguous arrays.
FISH experiments using labeled oligonucleotide probes
confirmed this presumption, revealing the presence of
both sequences at the termini of all pea chromosomes
(Fig. 3D–E). To check for specificity of this assay, control
experiments were run using probe sequences differing in
a single-base substitution within the repeat monomer
((TTACG)n and (TTTACG)n). These sequences were not
present in the 454 reads and corresponding probes gave
no hybridization signals on mitotic chromosomes (data
not shown).
Comparative analysis of the repeat composition of pea,
soybean and M. truncatula genomes
In addition to the identification of the major components
of pea repetitive DNA, we were interested in using the 454
sequence data for comparing the pea genome composition to that of related legume species. We primarily
focused on soybean (Glycine max), as it was the only species for which whole genome shotgun reads produced by
the same technology were available. The soybean 454 data
included 718,589 reads with an average length of 109
nucleotides [19]. To investigate which sequences are
shared between these two genomes we identified and analyzed pea 454 reads producing significant similarity hits
(E-value <= 1e-10) in BLAST searches against a database of
the soybean 454 reads. A total of 5,482 pea reads (1.7%)
matched soybean sequences; in the soybean dataset,
7,209 reads (1.0%) gave significant hits with pea. The
composition of these sequences is summarized in Fig.
5A–B. The largest fraction of the matching reads belonged
to rDNA sequences, which also displayed the highest
sequence similarity between the species (reflected by high
BLAST bit scores on Fig. 5B). Ogre elements, representing
the most abundant repeats in the pea genome, were also
identified in soybean but in much smaller numbers. On
the other hand, the two species were found to share relatively large population of SIRE1 sequences. Interestingly,
the other abundant families of pea Ty1/copia elements
were absent or gave only a few hits in the soybean
genome.

In order to compare genome composition of pea and soybean with the legume model species Medicago truncatula,
we employed the same strategy as above, except for using
a set of 197,570 M. truncatula BAC-end sequences instead
of 454 data. We found that pea genome contains considerably more repeats similar to M. truncatula sequences
than soybean. A total of 15,510 (4.9%) pea reads gave significant matches with M. truncatula and included all
major pea repeat families (Fig. 5D). However, there were
differences in genomic proportion and sequence conservation of individual repeats between pea and M. truncatula genomes. For example, abundant pea Ogre sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

were also frequently found in M. truncatula but their
sequence similarity was relatively low, whereas Ty1/copia
elements (represented mostly by Ps-copia-1/751 family)
produced much fewer hits but displayed higher average
sequence similarity (Fig. 5D). Contrary to pea, soybean
repeats were only poorly represented in M. truncatula.
About 2.1% of soybean 454 reads matched M. truncatula
sequences, however, except for rDNA (0.25%) no major
repeat family was found to be shared by these two species
(Fig. 5C). In summary, these results indicate similarity in
repeat composition between pea and M. truncatula
genomes, and considerable sequence divergence of most
repeat families between these two species and soybean.

Discussion
The rationale behind adapting 454 sequencing to repeat
profiling in complex plant genomes is that it provides efficient sequence sampling from a high number of independent genomic loci. The amount of generated sequence
data is large enough to include multiple reads from highly
repeated elements, thus allowing evaluation of their
abundance and sequence composition. However,
required prerequisites for the use of 454 sequencing for
repeat quantification and reconstruction are that the template sampling is random and that the sequencing does
not introduce a bias towards certain sequences. In this
study, we addressed these questions by comparing repeat
copy number estimates obtained using experimental
approaches [20-24] with the estimates based on the frequencies at which these repeats occur in 454 reads. The
values were within a two-fold difference range for most of
the repeats, and they never differed more than 2.8-fold.
The observed discrepancies can be explained by principal
limitations of both analytical approaches. The experimental quantification was based on DNA-DNA hybridizations, which may bias estimates if the probe fragment
spans sequence regions differing in genomic abundance.
In that case, hybridization signal is primarily determined
by only a part of the sequence, but it is considered to be
representative for the whole probe in subsequent calculations. This is not the case for the calculations of genome
representation based on sequence coverage by 454 reads,
which are performed separately for each nucleotide of the
sequence in question. On the other hand, sensitivity and
specificity of sequence similarity searches employed for
this analysis can be partially affected by the algorithm and
the similarity threshold values used for the assay. Thus,
taking into account these limitations, we consider the
experimental and 454 data to be in a good agreement.
Reconstruction of the repetitive element sequences from
454 reads represents a difficult task, complicated by the
short length of the reads and considerable sequence diversity of individual genomic copies of the repeat. A similar
problem has been successfully addressed by Li and co-

workers [32], who aimed at the recovery of ancestral
sequences for rice mobile elements from whole genome
shotgun sequences. They developed an algorithm based
on short oligomer (K-mer) frequency analysis for repeat
identification and reconstruction. However, the program
implementing this analysis was designed for processing
conventional sequence reads of at least several hundred
nucleotides in length and could not be adapted to work
with the short 454 sequences. Thus, we used a different
strategy, employing sequence-similarity based clustering

of the reads followed by assembling them into contigs
representing reconstructed fragments of the genomic
repeats. Although the TGICL program package used to
perform this analysis was originally designed for clustering ESTs [25], it provides a number of customizable
parameters, which after proper adjustment resulted in the
desired performance with our data. It should be noted,
however, that even with these settings, most repeats could
not be reconstructed as a single contig spanning their fulllength sequences and including most of the sequence

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:427

reads. This is mainly due to the occurrence of multiple
subfamilies of the repeats in the genome and the presence
of poorly conserved repeat regions. On the other hand,
highly conserved rDNA repeats could be reconstructed as
a single contig and their consensus was in excellent agreement with the sequences obtained by conventional cloning and sequencing of pea rDNA fragments.
Instead of performing direct contig assembly from all 454
reads [19], we preceded the assembly with a clustering
step, which resulted in partitioning the read collection
into groups of overlapping sequences. In addition to
reducing the computational complexity of the assembly
step, this approach also allowed the classification of contigs based on their cluster of origin. In principle, multiple
contigs resulting from the assembly of reads from the
same cluster should represent overlapping fragments and
sequence variants of the same repeat family. Whereas this
was true for many repeat families, there were also clusters
including reads from several unrelated repeats. This is
likely due to the existence of reads containing parts of two
different repeats which act as a bridge to join groups of
unrelated sequences during the transitive closure clustering procedure. Such reads can, for example, originate
from insertion sites of mobile elements, which are numerous in the genome and often located within other repetitive sequences. This assumption is supported by our
results, where this problem occurred in the largest cluster
(CL1), which originated from at least five different families of retroelements. Although such clusters can be subsequently broken into smaller sets of overlapping contigs
(see Methods), we plan to avoid this problem in the future
by developing algorithms for identification of such
"hybrid" reads and their elimination from the clustering
procedure.
Our results have shown that low-depth genome sequencing using massively parallel technology provides sufficient sequence data for comprehensive repeat
characterization even in a relatively large plant genome.
Compared to the only other study on this topic, employing 454 sequencing for repeat analysis in soybean [19],
the pea 454 sequences used here provided considerably
smaller genome coverage (0.77% vs. 7% in soybean) due
to the 4-fold difference in genome size between these species and the smaller reaction scale used in the pea
sequencing. Still, it was possible to characterize repeats
constituting 35–48% of the pea genome and including all
major classes of repetitive DNA. On the other hand, considering the estimated 75–97% proportion of repeats in
the genome [5,6], relatively large fraction of the repeats
remained uncharacterized. Reassociation kinetics studies
of pea genomic DNA [6] as well as observations from
other species [33] indicate that this fraction includes
diverged, low-copy remnants of ancient repeats ("fossil-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

repeats"). Such repeats are below the sensitivity limit of
our analysis due to their high sequence variability and low
copy numbers.
Similar to most higher plants studied so far [34-36], LTRretrotransposons were found to be the major component
of pea repetitive DNA. Ty3/gypsy elements were present in
twice as many copies as Ty1/copia and constituted an even
larger portion of the genome (24–39%, vs. 5% spanned
by Ty1/copia) owing to much longer element sequences.
The prevalence of Ty3/gypsy elements over other groups
of retroelements was observed in other plant genomes
including rice [37] and Vicia sp. [38], and their differential
proliferation substantially contributed to the genome size
variation among related species [9]. In pea, most of the
Ty3/gypsy sequences were classified as Ogre-like retrotransposons, a distinct evolutionary lineage of giant elements occurring in a range of dicot plants including the
genera of Leguminosae, Solanaceae, and Salicaceae [26].
Ogre elements were found to play an important role in
genome evolution of Vicia, a genus closely related to
Pisum. They were differentially amplified in individual
species, with the highest abundance in V. pannonica where
their recent expansion to 105 copies/1C increased the
genome size by more than 50% [8]. Contrary to V. pannonica, the Ogre population in pea is not as homogeneous
but it occurs as several distinct subfamilies differing in
their sequences. This suggests that the evolutionary history of Ogre elements in pea was more complex and
included processes of amplification and diversification of
the elements. Although they are the most abundant, Ogre
elements are probably not the only Ty3/gypsy elements
with a significant impact on pea genome evolution. For
example, Peabody elements were found to be very conserved in their nucleotide sequences, implying their recent
amplification.
Compared to Ty3/gypsy elements, Ty1/copia represented
a much smaller portion of the genome but occurred in a
larger number of different families. Intraspecific heterogeneity of the Ty1/copia population, resulting from the presence of divergent families, was reported in a number of
other species [39]. Interestingly, these families are well
conserved across different taxa in spite of their ancient origin before the divergence of monocots and dicots [40].
This is also true for the pea Ty1/copia sequences, which in
some cases, show high similarity to elements from phylogenetically distant species (Additional file 5). A typical
example is the most abundant family Ps-copia-1/751 with
strong similarity to monocot elements RIRE-1 and BARE;
moreover, the high proportion of solo-LTRs derived from
Ps-copia-1/751 suggests its long presence in the pea
genome.

Whereas the general composition of dispersed repeats represented by various groups of mobile elements resembled
that of other plants with complex genomes, our analysis
revealed surprising diversity of tandem repeats in the pea
genome. In addition to the previously described PisTR-A
and PisTR-B repeats [20], thirteen novel families of abundant tandem repeats showing genomic organization typical for satellite DNA have been identified. This contrasts
with most plants studied so far for which only a single or
a few satellites are known [41]. However, whether this is a
specific feature of the pea genome or simply a consequence of highly efficient tandem repeat identification
employing 454 data remains to be seen after more species
will be analyzed using this technology. Nevertheless, the
availability of such a rich set of satellite repeats differing
in monomer length, sequence, and chromosomal localization makes pea an attractive model for studying this
type of repeated DNA. For example, our previous investigation of PisTR-B repeats using COD-FISH revealed uniform orientation of its monomers with respect to
telomeres on most subtelomeric loci [42]. Extending this
study to other satellite families should show if this is a
general feature of the satellite arrangement at pea chromosome termini. Moreover, the wealth of sequence data
obtained in this study will allow detailed characterization
of sequence variability of individual families and testing if
it correlates with the repeat chromosomal localization as
was shown for other species [43]. Yet another interesting
question concerns the possible lack of a satellite repeat
conserved among pea centromeres. Although all pea centromeres seem to contain satellite DNA (Table 2), no family of the newly identified tandem repeats occupies all
centromeres as is common in most plant species characterized so far [44,45]. This might either suggest that the
genuine centromeric satellite has not been identified in
our sequences or that the centromeric sequences in pea
underwent less extensive homogenization among nonhomologous chromosomes.
In addition to the Arabidopsis-type telomeric repeats, two
other variants of telomeric minisatellite sequences were
identified in the pea genome. Although they were both
localized at chromosome termini along with the Arabidopsis-type sequences, their origin and role in telomere
maintenance are unclear. Occurrence of the mixed minisatellite telomeric motif was reported from several plants
and could be attributed to low fidelity of telomerase [46].
The relatively small number of 454 reads containing telomeric repeats did not allow us to perform a thorough
investigation of their variability; however, there were several reads including non-perfect or mixed repeat motifs
which could support this hypothesis (data not shown).
On the other hand, both alternative repeats were also
found to form arrays spanning the whole read lengths,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

which indicates their at least partial arrangement in longer
homogeneous arrays.

Conclusion
This work provided the first detailed survey of repetitive
sequences in garden pea. It confirmed the expected high
proportion of repeats in the pea genome and revealed that
it is mostly attributed to various families of mobile elements. Amplification of a few groups of Ty3/gypsy elements, especially those belonging to Ogre-like
retrotransposons, contributed the most to the bulk of pea
repeats. Ty1/copia elements were found to be less abundant but more diverse in their sequences, occurring in a
number of distinct (sub-)families. Other mobile elements
including non-LTR retrotransposons (LINEs) and DNA
transposons of the MuDR and En/Spm families were also
detected. However, their total abundance did not exceed
thousands of copies per haploid genome, thus representing only a minor part of pea nuclear DNA. Tandem
repeats identified in the pea genome included microsatellites, three variants of telomeric minisatellites, and exceptional diversity of satellite repeats. Localization of newly
identified satellite sequences on mitotic chromosomes
revealed their family-specific hybridization patterns, providing novel cytogenetic landmarks for chromosome
mapping.
Although the presented analysis yielded a wealth of information about the repeat composition of the pea genome,
it was also useful in uncovering various limitations of our
analytical approaches, which should be improved in the
future. In addition to these improvements, a number of
novel ways to utilize 454 data in plant genome analysis
can be envisioned. They include, for example, repeat
masking in genome sequencing projects, detailed investigation of intra- and intergenomic repeat variability, and
identification of conserved non-coding regulatory
sequences. Of special interest is the application of this
technology to comparative genomics in a wide range of
species, which should provide key information for understanding evolutionary patterns of repetitive sequences and
their impact on genome evolution. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and revealed that in
spite of differences in abundance of individual families,
the repeat composition in pea and M. truncatula is similar,
whereas both these species share only a few conserved
repeats with soybean.

Methods
Genomic DNA isolation and 454 sequencing
Seeds of garden pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Carrera) were
obtained from the Plant Breeding Station at Boršov, Czech
Republic. The DNA was extracted from purified nuclei in
order to minimize contamination with chloroplast and
mitochondrial genomes. The nuclei were isolated from

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:427

young leaves by grinding 5 g of the tissue in liquid nitrogen, followed by 5 min incubation in 35 ml of ice-cold H
buffer [47]. The homogenate was filtered through 48 μm
nylon mesh, adjusted to 35 ml volume with 1 × H buffer,
and centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Pelleted
nuclei were resuspended and centrifuged using the same
conditions once in 35 ml of H buffer, and once in 15 ml
of TC buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 6
mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2). The final centrifugation was
performed for 5 min only and the nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of TC. DNA was released by incubating the
nuclei with 40 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS and 0.25 μg/μl of
proteinase K for 4 hours at 37°C and purified by phenol
extraction and ethanol precipitation. The sequencing was
performed by 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT, USA) using
the GS-20 instrument and yielded 322,396 quality filtered
sequence reads with the average length of 104 bp. The
reads were deposited into NCBI Short Read Archive [48].
Processing and initial analysis of 454 reads
The reads were screened for their similarity to adaptors
and primers used in 454 sequencing using BLAST [49] and
595 reads producing blastn hits with expectation (E) value
< 1e-15 were removed from the set. The same procedure
was repeated to detect contamination with organellar
sequences, removing 2,322 reads with similarity to plant
chloroplast genomes and 77 reads similar to mitochondrial DNA. The remaining 319,402 reads were used for all
subsequent analyses. These reads included a total of 33.3
Mb, corresponding to 1/129 of the pea haploid genome
size (1C = 4,300 Mb [18]). Thus, the calculated repeat
copy numbers were multiplied by 129 in order to compensate for the actual genome coverage.

To determine the representation of previously characterized pea repeats in 454 sequences, these repeats were used
as queries in blastn searches against a database of the 454
reads, using E-value cutoff of 1e-10. BLAST outputs were
parsed using a BioPerl [50] script determining the number
of similarity hits at all positions along the sequences, calculating their average numbers and the corresponding
estimates of genomic copy numbers. The filtered set of
454 reads used for this analysis is available for BLAST
searches at our web site [51].
Reconstruction of repetitive sequences
Reconstruction of genomic repeats as well as other computer analysis were performed on an IBM xSeries 226 dual
processor server with 4 GB RAM running under the Gentoo Linux operating system. In addition to the programs
listed below, several scripts written in Perl were used for
data processing and analysis. These scripts are available
upon request from authors. The repeat reconstruction was
done using TIGR Gene Indices clustering tools (TGICL
[25]) employing the following parameters, which were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

optimized for our dataset by evaluating number and size
of resulting clusters, the length of the assembled contigs
and the presence of chimeric (misassembled) contig
sequences. All-versus-all pairwise similarity scores of the
reads were produced by mgblast and parsed using tclust,
performing transitive-closure clustering of the read pairs
sharing a minimum of 90% similarity over at least 70% of
the shorter sequence. The reads within individual clusters
were assembled into contigs using tgicl run with the -O 'p 80 -o 40' parameters, specifying overlap percent identity
and length cutoff for cap3 assembler. Although most clusters included reads derived from only a single family of
genomic repeats, the largest cluster (CL1) was composed
from a large number of reads corresponding to several
unrelated families of mobile elements. This problem was
probably caused by the presence of "hybrid" reads including sequences of two different elements (spanning their
insertion sites or recombination breakpoints, see also Discussion). To separate these unrelated sequences, the contigs assembled from CL1 were further grouped into subclusters using sclust (parameters HEAVY = 3010 SCORE =
150), which performs weighted seeded clustering based
on mutual similarities of the contigs. The programs
mgblast, tclust, tgicl, cap3 and sclust are included in the
TGICL package and the detailed description of parameters
can be obtained from the program help.
The assembled contigs were labeled based on the cluster
they originated from (CL [number]Contig [number]); in
case of CL1 the name also included sub-cluster number
(SCL [number]_CL1Contig [number]). The contig
sequences were characterized by calculating their average
read depth (RD) and genome representation (GR = RD ×
contig length). The genome representation was also calculated for individual clusters by summing GR values of the
corresponding contigs. Contigs from the clusters representing at least 0.01% of the pea genome (GR > 3,300)
were subjected to sequence similarity searches (blastn,
blastx) against GenBank database and to detection of conserved protein domains using RPS-BLAST [52] in order to
identify the type and family of the repeat they originated
from. Satellite repeats were identified by detection of tandem subrepeats within the contig sequences using dotter
[53]. Total proportion of identified repeats in the pea
genome was calculated by summing the GR of the clusters
assigned to the same type of repeat. Detailed information
about cluster characterization is available from Additional
file 3. All contig sequences with their RD and GR values
can be downloaded from our website; alternatively, the
contigs can be selected by sequence similarity searches
against user-provided queries [51].
Sequence analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of retroelements was done using
multiple sequence alignment of reverse transcriptase

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:427

domains and a phylogenetic tree was calculated by neighbor-joining method (bootstrap values calculated from
1000 replicates) using the ClustalX program [54]. Reverse
transcriptase sequences used for the analysis were
extracted mostly from plant retrotransposon sequences
downloaded from RepBase [55,56]. Graphical representation of the tree was drawn and edited using ATV Forester
[57], TreeEdit [58] and Jalview programs [59]. Copy
number (CN) estimation based on RT domains was calculated using formula CN = RDrt × 129 × L1/L2, where RDrt
is the average read depth within the reverse transcriptase
domain, L1 is the length of the reverse transcriptase
domain in particular contig and L2 is the length of the full
size domain. Contigs bearing only partial reverse transcriptase domains and therefore missing in the phylogenetic tree were assigned to appropriate retrotransposon
group based on their best Blast hits to elements shown in
the tree (Additional files 4 &5).
An alternative approach for copy number estimation of
Ogre elements was based on analyzing contigs including
the Ogre-specific PBS sequence complementary to
tRNAArg [26]. Contig assemblies (ACE files produced by
cap3 assembler) were visualized using clview [25] and
average read depth over the PBS site was calculated for
each contig. The contig sequences were compared using
dotter and grouped into three subfamilies according to
similarity of the sequences surrounding the PBS. The
number of PBS-containing reads was summed for each
subfamily and used to calculate its genomic copy number.
Microsatellite and telomeric repeats were identified
directly in a set of individual 454 reads instead of in the
contigs. The reads separated with runs of "N" (to avoid
fusing adjacent sequences) were concatenated into a single sequence and analyzed using Tandem Repeats Finder
[60]. The results were sorted and evaluated using TRAP
[61].
Comparative analysis of the repeat composition in pea,
soybean (Glycine max) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) was performed using our set of 319,402 pea 454
reads, a set of recently published 718,589 soybean 454
reads [19], and 197,570 M. truncatula BAC-end sequences.
The soybean and M. truncatula sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Trace Archive [48] and from TIGR
[62], respectively. Sequence similarities were identified by
blastn searches between 454 reads from pea and soybean,
and between either pea or soybean 454 reads and M. truncatula BAC-end sequences. The 454 reads producing
blastn hits with E-value of 1e-10 or lower to sequences
from the other species were considered to include
sequences shared between these genomes. For each of
these reads, the number of hits to other genome
sequences and average blastn bit score of these hits were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/427

determined and plotted using Mgraph (created by Louis
Gonzalez and Christine Deroo, available from [63]).
Grouping the reads according to the repeat type was done
by similarity searches to known sequences performed as
described above.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
Hybridization probes for potential satellite repeats were
prepared by PCR amplification from pea genomic DNA
using primer pairs designed according to the contig
sequences including tandem subrepeats (Table 1 and
Additional file 6). The PCR was performed in 30 μl of
reaction mix (1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 0.2 μM primers, 5 U of Taq polymerase
(Promega), 0.2–20 ng of template DNA) for 25 cycles of 1
min at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C and 3 min at 72°C, preceded
by initial denaturation (3 min at 94°C) and followed by
final extension step (10 min at 72°C). Reaction products
were resolved on agarose gel electrophoresis and bands
correspoding to the repeat monomers or short multimers
(< 800 bp) were excised from ladders of the amplified
fragments. The excised DNA was purified and used as a
template in PCR labeling by biotin-dUTP as described
[20]. 5' biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes for alternative telomeric repeats (CCTAA)8, (CCTAAA)7 and controls
(CGTAA)8, (CGTAAA)7-CG were purchased from Bioneer
Europe. FISH experiments were carried out on chromosome squash preparations [64] obtained from root tip
meristems synchronized as described [65]. The chromosome preparations were aged for 5–60 days and post-fixed
in 4% formaldehyde/2 × SSC for 10 min at 25°C. The
hybridization was performed as described [64] with the
following modifications. Probe concentration in the
hybridization mix was 0.2 μM for oligonucleotide and 0.5
ng/μl for PCR-amplified fragments. Formamide concentrations in hybridization and washing solutions and incubation temperatures were adjusted according to the probe
sequences to achieve 90% stringency for the oligonucleotide probes (Tm calculated using Exiqon Tm prediction
1.1 software [66]) and 80% stringency for the satellite
repeat probes. Stringency for both types of probes was calculated according to [64]. Biotin-labeled probes were
detected with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen)
and individual chromosome types were distinguished by
co-hybridization with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled PisTR-B
probe, producing characteristic patterns on each pea chromosome [20]. Chromosomes were counterstained with
4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and observed using
a Nikon Eclipse-600 epifluorescence microscope

JM conceived the study and carried out most of the bioinformatics analysis. PN participated in repeat identification
and conducted phylogenetic analysis of retroelements.
AN carried out FISH experiments. All authors contributed
to the manuscript preparation and approved its final version.

Phylogenetic analysis of Ty1/copia elements based on their reverse
transcriptase domains. Phylogenetic trees show relationship of reverse
transcriptase domains identified in pea 454 contigs to those from selected
plant retroelements. Only contigs bearing complete or marginally truncated (marked with asterisks) RT domains were used for analysis and
their names and positions are labeled with yellow boxes. Contigs containing only partial RT sequences were assigned to the trees based on their
sequence similarity to full-length domains (labeled as "best hit"). Copy
numbers of elements belonging to individual clades are provided in Figure
4.
