Abstract
Background: Loss of photosynthesis has occurred independently in several plant and algal
lineages, and represents a major metabolic shift with potential consequences for the content and
structure of plastid genomes. To investigate such changes, we sequenced the complete plastid
genome of the parasitic, non-photosynthetic green alga, Helicosporidium.
Results: The Helicosporidium plastid genome is among the smallest known (37.5 kb), and like other
plastids from non-photosynthetic organisms it lacks all genes for proteins that function in
photosynthesis. Its reduced size results from more than just loss of genes, however; it has little
non-coding DNA, with only one intron and tiny intergenic spaces, and no inverted repeat (no
duplicated genes at all). It encodes precisely the minimal complement of tRNAs needed to translate
the universal genetic code, and has eliminated all redundant isoacceptors. The Helicosporidium
plastid genome is also highly structured, with each half of the circular genome containing nearly all
genes on one strand. Helicosporidium is known to be related to trebouxiophyte green algae, but the
genome is structured and compacted in a manner more reminiscent of the non-photosynthetic
plastids of apicomplexan parasites.
Conclusion: Helicosporidium contributes significantly to our understanding of the evolution of
plastid DNA because it illustrates the highly ordered reduction that occurred following the loss of
a major metabolic function. The convergence of plastid genome structure in Helicosporidium and
the Apicomplexa raises the interesting possibility that there are common forces that shape plastid
genomes, subsequent to the loss of photosynthesis in an organism.

Background
Plastids are organelles found in plants and algae. Plastids
originated in the endosymbiotic uptake of a cyanobacterium, which was subsequently transformed from a complex free-living bacterium to the highly specialized
organelle now integrated with its host. At the genomic
level, this integration involved the loss of many genes and
the transfer of many more to the host nuclear genome, the
protein products of which are targeted back to the

organelle [1]. This process is not complete, however, as all
known plastids have retained a residual genome that
encodes a handful of RNA and protein-coding genes,
which typically include many of the key components of
photosystems I and II [2]. Our concept of plastids is inexorably tied to photosynthesis, since this is the dominant
metabolic process of most plastids. They are, however,
metabolically diverse organelles that play a role in the biosynthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, isoprenoids and

heme, as well as in other processes related to photosynthesis such as pigment biosynthesis, and radical detoxification. Indeed, in several lineages of plants and algae
photosynthesis has been lost altogether, but the plastid
has been retained for these and other purposes [3]. Wellknown examples of this include holoparasitic plants,
many lineages of heterotrophic algae and parasitic apicomplexans (such as the malaria parasite). In most plastid
genomes, the vast majority of genes encode products
involved in either gene expression or photosynthesis.
When photosynthesis is lost, so are most or all of the
related genes, leading to dramatic changes in the plastid
genome in size, coding capacity, and often also structure.
These genomes offer an opportunity to study the effects of
massive genomic changes following a functional shift.
Unfortunately, the number of fully-sequenced non-photosynthetic plastid genomes is small, limited to Epifagus
virginiana (a holoparasitic angiosperm), Euglena longa (a
heterotrophic euglenid), and several apicomplexan parasites bearing secondary plastids of red algal origin called
apicoplasts (Plasmodium falciparum, Theileria parva, Eimeria tenella and Toxoplasma gondii). The E. virginiana plastid
is about half the size of typical angiosperm plastids, having lost all its photosynthetic genes, but is otherwise similar to its relatives in many ways including non-coding
DNA content, synteny of remaining genes and overall
structure [4]. Likewise, E. longa has lost most of the photosynthetic genes found in the plastid of its close relative
Euglena gracilis, but they share many features that are
unique to euglenids, such as three tandem repeats of the
RNA operon and a multitude of distinctive introns [5].
Apicomplexan plastid genomes, however, are quite different from those of other secondary red algal plastids found
in photosynthetic lineages. They have undergone extensive rearrangments, are exceedingly small (~35 kb) and
compact, and contain very little non-coding DNA [6-9].
The uniqueness of apicomplexan plastid genomes may
simply be due to time: apicomplexan plastids probably
lost photosynthesis long ago in the ancestor of this diverse
group, whereas other sequenced non-photosynthetic plastid genomes come from organisms with close relatives
that are photosynthetic.
To examine the process of genome reduction after the loss
of a major metabolic function, we have completely
sequenced the genome of the non-photosynthetic plastid
of Helicosporidium sp., a parasitic green alga. Helicosporidia are obligate parasites of invertebrates with a
unique morphology and infection strategy [10]. Their
evolutionary origin was disputed until recently, when
molecular evidence surprisingly showed that they are
highly adapted trebouxiophyte green algae, specifically
related to the opportunistic vertebrate parasites, Prototheca
[11,12]. This led to the prediction that Helicosporidia

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/12

contain plastids, and although they have not yet been visually identified, molecular evidence has confirmed their
existence [13-15]. The function of this organelle has been
investigated by examining nucleus-encoded plastid-targeted proteins, which cumulatively suggest the Helicosporidium plastid is functionally similar in many ways to
that of apicomplexan parasites [15]. Here, we show that
the Helicosporidium plastid genome, while retaining many
features confirming its phylogenetic affiliation, has been
radically reduced in a non-random, structured fashion.
The result is a genome that is highly ordered with regard
to several characteristics such as coding strand and selective loss of tRNAs. Comparing the Helicosporidium plastid
genome to that of other green algae and more distantly
related non-photosynthetic plastids raises the interesting
possibility that the 'structured-reduction' of Helicosporidium represents a common fate of such a genome.

Results and discussion
Genome size and density of coding regions
The Helicosporidium sp. plastid genome was determined to
be a circle 37,454 bp in length with a gene map as shown
in Figure 1. It has an overall GC content of 26.9%, which
is less than most plastids, but not as extreme as the 13.1%
observed in the Plasmodium falciparum apicoplast [9].
Non-coding regions are more AT-rich (14.7% GC) than
genes, and are small. Gene-density is high, with only 5.1%
non-coding DNA and an average intergenic space of 36
bp. Four gene pairs overlap by between 4 and 27 bp. Helicosporidium has by far the smallest plastid genome of any
known Viridiplantae (plants and green algae), and is the
smallest sequenced plastid genome outside those of apicomplexan parasites. One of the most compact plastid
genomes reported so far is the primitive red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, which although extremely gene rich was
reported by Ohta et al. [16] to have a median intergenic
distance of just 14 bp. Using the same measure of compactness as Ohta et al. (the median of intergenic spaces
between adjacent protein coding genes, where overlapping genes have a negative intergenic space), Helicosporidium is comparably compact with a median intergenic
distance of 8 bp.

A comparison of the genomic features of non-photosynthetic plastids and their photosynthetic relatives is presented in Table 1. Compared with the photosynthetic
trebouxiophyte Chlorella vulgaris, the Helicosporidium plastid has undergone a 4-fold reduction in genome size
through large scale gene loss (4-fold), compaction of the
remaining genes with smaller intergenic regions (7-fold)
and an overall lower proportion of non-coding sequence
(3.7-fold). The opportunistic parasite Prototheca wickerhamii is a close relative of Helicosporidium [11,12,14], and
has genome characteristics intermediate to Helicosporidium and C. vulgaris. At an estimated 54 kb [17], the P. wick-

plastid with less non-coding DNA and more densely
packed genes, but is reduced to a much lesser extent than
Helicosporidium. Comparing other non-photosynthetic

plastid genomes with photosynthetic relatives reveals that
the reduction and compaction of Epifagus virginiana and
Euglena longa are not as substantial (about a 2-fold reduction in size). Plastids of red algae and their derivatives

tend to have more genes than those of green plastid lineages [1,2], so it is interesting that the smallest and most
compact genomes are found among the red plastids of
apicomplexa. A sister group comparison is difficult for
this group, since the closest relatives of apicomplexa are
dinoflagellates, the plastid genomes of which are difficult
to compare with other plastids because they have been
transformed into single gene mini-circles [18]. However,
the photosynthetic ancestors of apicomplexa were probably similar to other secondary red plastid-containing
organisms, such as Odontella sinensis (Table 1), which
would indicate a 4-fold reduction in plastid genome and
an even more extreme level of compaction.
Genome structure and organization
Unlike most plastid genomes, the Helicosporidium genome
does not contain an inverted repeat (Figure 1). Although
inverted repeats are probably an ancestral character state
for all plastids, they have been independently lost in several lineages. Among the green algal plastids investigated
so far, the inverted repeat is absent in charophytes (Staurastrum puctulatum and Zygnema circumcarinatum [19]),
ulvophytes (Caulerpa sertularoides [20] and Codium fragile
[21]) and the trebouxiophyte Chlorella vulgaris [22], but is
present in Chlorella ellipsoidea [23]. More interestingly,
Helicosporidium has also lost the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
operon, which is a nearly universal feature of all genomes,
including prokaryotes, eukaryotes and organelles. The
plastid rRNA operon is normally part of the inverted
repeat when it is present, and consists of the small and
large subunit (SSU and LSU) rRNA genes separated by a

spacer region containing the tRNA-Ile and tRNA-Ala
genes. In Helicosporidium, the rRNA genes are separated by
22.6 kb of sequence, but tRNA-Ile and tRNA-Ala genes
remain associated with the SSU and LSU genes, respectively, such that a typical rRNA operon has been broken in
half and distributed at opposing ends of the circle (Figure
1). While the vast majority of plastids have the rRNA
operon, it has been lost in C. ellipsoidea, S. punctulatum
and the P. falciparum and coccidian apicoplasts, where the
SSU and LSU rRNA genes are adjacent to each other but
encoded on opposite strands [6,7,9,19,23]. It has also
been disrupted in the charophytes, Z. circumcarinatum
[19] and Spirogyra maxima [24], and the ulvophytes C. sertularoides [20] and C. fragile [21], where the two rRNA
genes are located on the same strand but far apart, as in
Helicosporidium. This genome rearrangement has therefore
occurred in at least three independent lineages, and may
be an outcome of loss of the inverted repeat.
The most striking feature of the Helicosporidium genome is
the symmetry shown in strand bias of coding regions (Figure 1). The rRNA genes are nearly diametrically opposed,
and all but two proteins and one tRNA on one side of
them are on the same strand, while all but one tRNA on
the other side are on the opposite strand. Similarly-organized coding strand biases are also found in some apicomplexan plastids and in the euglenid plastids, but the bias
is not as strong. In P. falciparum, the coding strand switch
occurs between the adjacent inverted repeats, each of
which encodes LSU and SSU rRNA and nine tRNA genes
[9] and contains the origin of replication [25]. In Euglena,

genome. The sum of [G-C]/[G+C] calculated in 37 base,

the coding strand symmetry is bound on one end by the
origin of replication and on the other end by the replication termination site [26]. In these organisms, the majority of genes are transcribed in each direction away from
the bidirectional origin of replication, such that the leading strand of replication is largely the coding strand. Such
bias is also widespread among bidirectional replicating
prokaryote genomes, where it is hypothesized to be the
result of selection to minimize collision between DNA
and RNA polymerases moving in opposite directions [27].
Notably, one of only two non-coding regions larger than
100 bp in the Helicosporidium plastid genome is situated
between the SSU rRNA and tRNA-Glu genes, at one of the
crossover points in strand selection. To investigate
whether this could be a replication origin, we constructed
a sliding window of cumulative GC skew [G-C/G+C].
These plots detect changes in compositional bias of guanine over cytosine along a sequence, which presumably
occur because of strand-specific mutational biases during
replication, and their global minimum and maximum
points correspond to the origin and termination of replication for genomes with bi-directional replication origins

[28,29]. The cumulative GC-skew of the Helicosporidium
genome reveals a global minimum and maximum at the
regions either side of the SSU and LSU genes (Figure 2B),
lending support to the idea that the origin of replication is
located as marked in Figure 2. If this is so, the Helicosporidium plastid is like those of apicomplexans and euglenids
in that almost all genes are encoded on the leading strand
of replication, and that the observed coding strand symmetry is an adaptation for co-directional replication and
transcription. Interestingly, this bilateral symmetry is not
seen in most other plastid genomes, even though the
selection pressure should be universal for bi-directionally
replicating circular genomes. However, other selective
pressures might also increase coding strand bias. A recent
examination of plastid gene order in green algae and
plants showed that in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii plastid genome, adjacent genes were more often functionally
related and clustered on the same strand than in an
inferred ancestral genome, and that this clustering is significantly higher than would be expected from random
genome rearrangements [30]. At least in the highly rearranged plastid genome of C. reinhardtii, and perhaps
more generally, increased coding strand bias seems to be
an outcome of selection for co-transcription of genes of
common function.
Comparing gene order with C. vulgaris reveals that, in
addition to the large-scale changes in genome structure,
smaller rearrangements have also been common (Figure
3). The most obvious differences between the genomes
are the many large deletions in Helicosporidium. These
missing segments encode mostly photosynthetic products, but also clpP protease, the cell division proteins minD
and minE, and several tRNAs and ribosomal proteins. In
the remaining shared segments, synteny is low between
Helicosporidium and C. vulgaris. Some conserved blocks do
remain, such as a large string of co-directionally transcribed ribosomal proteins including L2, S19, S3, L16,
L14, L5, S8, L36, S11 and RNA polymerase subunit A
(rpoA). This particular block of genes is conserved, with
some lineage-specific deletions, in all plastids and is probably co-expressed. The partial plastid genome of P. wickerhamii shows considerable rearrangement of genes when
compared to either C. vulgaris or Helicosporidium, suggesting rapid and ongoing rearrangements in these genomes.
Gene content
The Helicosporidium genome encodes 26 proteins, 3 rRNAs
and 25 tRNAs. The only intron is a group I intron in the
tRNA Leu (UAA) gene. This particular intron is commonly
found in cyanobacteria and plastids and may be an ancestral plastid feature, although lineage-specific losses have
occurred among green algae [31]. No unique ORFs of
appreciable size were found and most of the protein-coding genes in Helicosporidium are identifiable as housekeep-

ing proteins involved in transcription and translation
(Figure 1). These include 16 ribosomal proteins, an elongation factor and components of an RNA polymerase
(rpo). In plants, this polymerase is responsible mainly for
transcription of genes associated with photosynthesis. In
non-photosynthetic plants, algae and apicomplexans
[4,5,9], some or all of the rpo subunits have been lost
from the plastid genome, and it is thought that a separate
nuclear-encoded polymerase is responsible for plastid
transcription. In the Helicosporidium plastid, however, all

4 subunits of the RNA polymerase complex (rpoA, rpoB,
rpoC1, and rpoC2) are present. The Helicosporidium plastid
also encodes tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthetase (tilS), which is
responsible for modifying the CAU anticodon of a unique
tRNA that is cognate for isoleucine. This CAU-reading
tRNA is universally found among bacteria and plastids
[32]. In plastids, however, tilS is generally encoded in the
nuclear genome and targeted to the organelle. In addition
to Helicosporidium, tilS is also plastid-encoded in the rho-

Codon frequency and tRNAs in the Helicosporidium plastid. *Wobble rules indicate the allowed mismatches between
the first position of the anticodon and the third position of the codon (other positions, indicated by 'X', follow standard
Watson-Crick base-pairing rules): 1) GXX anticodons read XXU and XXC codons, 2) CXX anticodons read XXG codons 3)
AXX anticodons (where A is modified to I) read XXN codons, 4) UXX anticodons (where U is modified) read XXA and XXG
codons, 5) UXX anticodons read XXN codons, and 6) LAU anticodons (where C is modified to L) read AUA [32, 39–41].

vulgaris, Chaetosphaeridium globosum and Mesostigma viride.
Only four protein coding genes encode products not
involved in transcription or translation: FtsH protease,
which degrades membrane-bound proteins [33,34], ycf1,
a poorly conserved gene of unknown function that has
been shown to be essential [35,36], Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunit (accD), which is involved in fatty acid
biosynthesis [37], and a sulfate transport protein (cysT)
[38]. These four genes have a scattered distribution among
plastid genomes. FtsH protease is found in red algae, chromists (algae with plastids of secondary red algal origin)
and green algae, but is nuclear-encoded in plants. AccD is

found in plants, green algae and red algae. Ycf1 is only
found in the plastid genomes of plants and green algae,
while cysT is restricted to green algae, a few lower plants
and one red alga. Other components of the metabolic
pathways in which accD and cysT participate are known to
be encoded in the nucleus of Helicosporidium and targeted
to the plastid, confirming these as metabolic functions of
the organelle [15]. As expected, no genes involved in photosynthesis or bioenergetic processes were found.
As noted earlier, P. wickerhamii probably represents an
intermediate form between autotrophic, Chlorella-like trebouxiophytes and the highly-reduced Helicosporidium.
Over half the P. wickerhamii plastid genome is known, and

no photosystem, electron transport or chlorophyll biosynthesis proteins have been found. However, the P. wickerhamii plastid does encode genes for six of the subunits
of ATP synthase [17], which are not present in Helicosporidum or apicoplast genomes.

present in seven out of eight 4-fold degenerate groups. The
single exception to this uniformity is tRNA-Arg (ACG).
The first anticodon position A is presumably modified to
inosine and reads all four Arg codons, as happens in plant
plastids [40,41].

The Helicosporidium plastid encodes a minimal set of
tRNAs
The Helicosporidium plastid genome contains just 25
tRNAs, which is among the smallest number of tRNA
genes documented to date in a plastid genome (Table 1).
This is in part due to a reduction in tRNA gene copy
number, such that the Helicosporidium plastid encodes
only a single copy of each tRNA with a particular anticodon. Multiple tRNA gene copies are universally found in
plastids, sometimes independently (as in C. vulgaris) and
sometimes as part of the inverted repeat (e.g P. falciparum). Moreover, the Helicosporidium plastid genome
contains a minimal functional set of tRNAs for a genome
using all 61 sense codons and the universal genetic code.
The set of tRNAs in Helicosporidium is a good illustration
of the degree of order in the reduction of this genome.
There are twenty amino acids and each is represented by a
single tRNA except leucine, serine, arginine, methionine
and isoleucine (Figure 4). Leucine, serine, and arginine
are distinguished by having six codons and so require two
tRNAs: one for four codons and another for the other two.
Methionine has a single codon, but requires an initiator
tRNA and a second one for internal methionine codons.
Isoleucine, with three codons, requires 2 tRNAs: one for a
pair of codons ending in a purine (R) and a second that is
the substrate for tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthetase, which
modifies C in the first position of the anticodon to lysidine (L), making it cognate for the codon AUA. Conceptually, this is a minimum complement of tRNAs for
plastids: one each for the twelve 2-fold degenerate codon
groups, one each for the eight 4-fold degenerate codon
groups, one tryptophan, one initiator methionine, one
elongation methionine, one for the AUR pair of isoleucine codons, and the modified tRNA-Ile.

Once again, the closest comparison for this type of reduction lies in the non-photosynthetic plastids. P. falciparum
takes near-complete advantage of the wobble rules but
uses two anticodons for glycine. E. tenella, T. gondii and T.
parva have dispensed with the extraneous tRNA-Gly and
use the same suite of tRNAs as Helicosporidium. Curiously,
however, all the apicomplexa appear to lack the modified
tRNA-Ile (CAT reading ATA). The ATA codon frequently
appears in these genomes, so either a unique and
unknown modification system must exist [42], or they
import a tRNA. In the holoparasitic plant E. virginiana, a
number of tRNAs have been lost or exist as pseudogenes.
Seven essential anticodons are missing, so it has been suggested that E. virginiana must import tRNAs [43]. Helicosporidium is therefore unique in that it reduced its tRNA
complement to a minimum without inventing new modifications, changing its genetic code or importing tRNAs
from the cytoplasm; instead, it has simply done away with
all redundant tRNAs to leave the perfect minimal set for
the universal code.

In general, plastids use more than the minimal set: about
32 different tRNA species are usually found because more
than one isoacceptor is often used to decode the 4-fold
degenerate groups of serine, leucine, threonine, arginine
and glycine and the 2-fold degenerate lysine (UAR) group.
Helicosporidium minimizes the number of isoacceptors
used, by complete utilization of 3rd position wobble. As
Figure 4 shows, the complement of tRNAs encoded in the
Helicosporidium genome are sufficient to decode all
codons found in the mRNA, assuming that some known
modifications [32,39] are used. Furthermore, the GXX
tRNA is present in every one of eight codon pairs ending
in a pyrimidine, the UXX tRNA is present in every one of
five codon pairs ending in a purine, and the UXX tRNA is

Interestingly, there is a strong AT codon bias in Helicosporidium protein coding genes (the arginine codon
CGG is used only once in the entire genome), and this
bias is often counter to the tRNA complement (Figure 4).
In some systems, there is a correlation between codon bias
and what tRNA genes are present in the genome, and this
is assumed to occur by selection for increased translation
effieciency [32]. However, in Helicosporidium, codon bias
is clearly a result of an overall high AT bias, while the presence or absence of tRNAs is dictated by wobble rules.

Conclusion
When a major metabolic shift occurs, many genes may be
lost. If photosynthesis disappears, this loss of genes can
represent a large proportion of the plastid genome, so the
effect is severe. By itself, however, this loss does not
explain the nature of these reduced genomes, because
there is no obvious reason that the resulting genome
could not be similar in form to its photosynthetic ancestor, but reduced in content. Indeed, this is what we see in
the holoparasitic plant E. virginiana and the heterotrophic
euglenid E. longa. However, the genomes of the apicoplast
and Helicosporidium are different; these genomes are
highly reduced but more ordered than their ancestors. At
least some aspects of this 'structured reduction' appears to
be related to high coding density: the symmetrical coding
strand bias probably developed to co-ordinate transcription and replication, and the elegant utilization of wobble

rules is probably to reduce the complement of tRNA genes
to a minimal functional set. The apicomplexa and Helicosporidium are not closely related; indeed, among plastid
types they could hardly be more different: the apicoplast
is a secondary plastid derived from a red alga whereas the
Helicosporidium plastid is a primary green algal plastid.
Their genomes have both retained characteristics that
betray these origins, but they have also converged on a
similar form in many ways. It is possible there are specific
selective pressures operating here that are not important
to other sequenced non-photosynthetic plastid genomes,
or it could be that this is a predictable outcome for the
evolution of these genomes, and less ordered examples
are simply not there yet. Either way, the overall forms of
apicomplexan and Helicosporidium plastid genomes have
been shaped in parallel by common evolutionary forces.
Comparing them raises interesting questions about
whether there are selective pressures that lead genomes to
compact, or if compaction is simply a by-product of
reduction that occurs for neutral reasons.

Methods
Cell culture and genomic DNA isolation
Helicosporidium sp. (ATCC 50920, isolated from the blackfly Simulium jonesii) was cultured axenically in TNM-FH
insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/ml of gentamycin at 25°C
in the dark. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and
ground under liquid nitrogen. Total genomic DNA was
extracted from the ground cells using the Plant Dneasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen).

clones. The plastid genome sequence has been deposited
in GenBank [DQ398104].
Annotation and analyses
Protein coding genes were initially identified by BLASTX
[44] searches of NCBI protein databases. In cases of divergent sequence and/or length heterogeneity such that the
Helicosporidium ORF could be defined by more than one
initiation codon, the longest non-overlapping ORF was
selected. Ultimately, 94.9% of the genome contained
ORFs with detectable homologues in other plastid
genomes, giving high confidence that all genes were identified and annotated. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were
identified by BLASTN searches against the plastid genome
database at NCBI. Endpoints of rRNA genes were determined by alignment with trebouxiophyte plastid rRNA
genes [GenBank:AJ222802, GenBank:NC001865]. Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE
[45]. All non-coding regions were re-analyzed with
BLASTX and BLASTN searches, revealing no detectable
matches. Mean intergenic distances were calculated from
intergenic spaces between all genes, with overlapping
genes given a value of 0.
