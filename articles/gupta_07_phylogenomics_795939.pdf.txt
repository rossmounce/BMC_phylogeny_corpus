Abstract
Background: Alpha proteobacteria are one of the largest and most extensively studied groups
within bacteria. However, for these bacteria as a whole and for all of its major subgroups (viz.
Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Caulobacterales), very
few or no distinctive molecular or biochemical characteristics are known.
Results: We have carried out comprehensive phylogenomic analyses by means of Blastp and PSIBlast searches on the open reading frames in the genomes of several α-proteobacteria (viz.
Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Brucella suis, Caulobacter crescentus, Gluconobacter oxydans, Mesorhizobium
loti, Nitrobacter winogradskyi, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1,
Silicibacter sp. TM1040, Rhodospirillum rubrum and Wolbachia (Drosophila) endosymbiont). These
studies have identified several proteins that are distinctive characteristics of all α-proteobacteria,
as well as numerous proteins that are unique repertoires of all of its main orders (viz. Rhizobiales,
Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Caulobacterales) and many
families (viz. Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Bradyrhiozobiaceae,
Brucellaceae and Bartonellaceae). Many other proteins that are present at different phylogenetic
depths in α-proteobacteria provide important information regarding their evolution. The
evolutionary relationships among α-proteobacteria as deduced from these studies are in excellent
agreement with their branching pattern in the phylogenetic trees and character compatibility
cliques based on concatenated sequences for many conserved proteins. These studies provide
evidence that the major groups within α-proteobacteria have diverged in the following order:
(Rickettsiales(Rhodospirillales (Sphingomonadales (Rhodobacterales (Caulobacterales-Parvularculales
(Rhizobiales)))))). We also describe two conserved inserts in DNA Gyrase B and RNA polymerase
beta subunit that are distinctive characteristics of the Sphingomonadales and Rhodosprilllales species,
respectively. The results presented here also provide support for the grouping of
Hyphomonadaceae and Parvularcula species with the Caulobacterales and the placement of Stappia
aggregata with the Rhizobiaceae group.
Conclusion: The α-proteobacteria-specific proteins and indels described here provide novel and
powerful means for the taxonomic, biochemical and molecular biological studies on these bacteria.
Their functional studies should prove helpful in identifying novel biochemical and physiological
characteristics that are unique to these bacteria.

Background

The α-proteobacteria form one of the largest groups
within bacteria that includes numerous phototrophs,
chemolithotrophs, chemoorganotrophs and aerobic photoheterotrophs [1]. They are abundant constituents of various terrestrial and marine environments [2]. Pelagibacter
oblique, which is the smallest known free-living bacteria, is
believed to be the most numerous bacteria on this planet
(about 1028 cells) comprising about 25% of all microbial
cells in the oceans [2]. The intimate association that many
α-proteobacteria exhibit with the eukaryotic organisms is
of central importance from agricultural and medical perspectives [3,4]. Symbiotic association of the Rhizobiaceae
family members with the plant root nodules is responsible for most of the atmospheric nitrogen fixation by
plants [4-6]. Many other α-proteobacteria such as Rickettsiales, Brucella and Bartonella have adopted intracellular
life styles and they constitute important human and animal pathogens [3,7-9]. Additionally, the α-proteobacteria
have also played a seminal role in the origin of the eukaryotic cell [10,11].
In the current taxonomic scheme based on 16S rRNA, αproteobacteria are recognized as a Class within the phylum Proteobacteria [1,12,13]. They are subdivided into 7
main subgroups or orders (viz. Caulobacterales, Rhizobiales,
Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Parvularculales) [12]. The α-proteobacteria and
their main subgroups are presently distinguished from
each other and from other bacteria primarily on the basis
of their branching in phylogenetic trees [14,15]. However,
we have previously described several conserved inserts
and deletions (indels), as well as whole proteins, that are
specific for these bacteria [16,17].
In the past 3–4 years, the numbers of α-proteobacterial
genomes that have been sequenced has increased markedly. In addition to > 60 complete genomes (Table 1),
sequence information is available for a large number of
other species. These genomes cover all of the main groups
within α-proteobacteria (Table 1) and provide an enormously valuable resource for identifying molecular characteristics that are unique to them. This information can
be used to identify unique sets of genes or proteins that
are distinctive characteristics of various higher taxonomic
groups (e.g. families, orders, etc.) within α-proteobacteria. Such genes/proteins provide valuable tools for taxonomic, biochemical and molecular biological studies [1726]. With this goal in mind, in the present work, we have
performed comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of αproteobacterial genomes to identify proteins/ORFs that
are distinctive characteristics of the various higher taxonomic groups within α-proteobacteria. The phylogenomic distribution of these proteins is also compared
with the branching patterns of these species in phyloge-

netic trees and in the character compatibility cliques to
develop a reliable picture of α-proteobacterial evolution.

Results and discussion
Phylogeny of alpha proteobacteria
For comparing and interpreting the results of phylogenomic analysis, it was necessary at first to examine the
evolutionary relationships among α-proteobacteria in
phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic analyses for α-proteobacteria was carried out based on concatenated sequences for
12 highly conserved proteins (see Methods). The relationships among these species were examined by both traditional phylogenetic methods (viz. neighbour-joining
(NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum-likelihood (ML)) and by the character compatibility approach
[27]. Figure 1 presents a neighbour-joining distance tree
for α-proteobacteria, showing the bootstrap scores for various nodes using the NJ, MP and ML methods. In this tree,
all of the main groups or orders within α-proteobacteria
(viz. Caulobacterales, Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales and Sphingomonadales), except the Rickettsiales,
formed well-resolved clades by different methods. For the
Parvularculales, sequence information was available from
a single species and it branched with the Caulobacterales.
The two main families of the Rickettsiales i.e. Rickettsiaceae
and Anaplasmataceae did not form a monophyletic clade,
although they constituted the deepest branching lineages
within α-proteobacteria. Except for the NJ method, the
relative branching of different main groups within α-proteobacteria was not resolved by other methods. The
branching orders of different groups as seen here is similar
to that observed previously in the rRNA trees [1,15,16,28].
Recently, after this work was completed, Williams et al.
[29] have reported similar results based on phylogenetic
analysis of a different large set of protein sequences.

The evolutionary relationships among α-proteobacteria
were also examined using the character compatibility
approach [27]. This method removes all homoplasic and
fast-evolving characters from the dataset [27,30,31] and it
has proven useful in obtaining correct topology in cases
which have proven difficult to resolve by other means [3133]. These analyses were carried out on a smaller set of 27
species containing all main groups of α-proteobacteria
and two ε-proteobacteria. The concatenated sequence
alignment for the 12 proteins contained 896 positions
that were useful for these studies (i.e. those sites where
only two amino acids were found with each present in at
least two species). The compatibility analysis of these sites
resulted in 12 largest cliques each containing 350 mutually compatible characters. The two main relationships
observed in these cliques are shown in Fig. 2. The other
cliques differed from those shown only in the relative
branching positions of various Rhizobiaceae species, which
varied from each other by a single character and are

shown as unresolved in Fig. 2. In both these cliques, the
species from all main orders within α-proteobacteria were
clearly distinguished by multiple unique characters. Further, in contrast to the phylogenetic trees where Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae did not form a distinct clade
(Fig. 1), their monophyletic grouping was strongly supported by 9 unique shared characters (Fig. 2). The Rickettsiales and Rhodospirillales formed the deepest branching
lineages in these cliques and other groups within α-proteobacteria branched in the following order: (Sphingomonadales (Rhodobacterales (Caulobacterales (Rhizobiales)))).
This branching order was supported by multiple unique
characters at each node giving confidence in the results.
The two main cliques obtained in these analyses differed
from each other in terms of the branching position of the
species belonging to the order Rhodospirillales. In one
clique (Fig. 2A), the Rhodospirillales branched with the

Rickettsiales, whereas in the other this group of species was
found to branch after the Rickettsiales and it formed outgroup of the other α-proteobacteria (Fig. 2B). However,
only a single character supported the former relationship
indicating that it was not reliable. The two families within
the Rhodospirillales order (Rhodospirillaceae and Acetobacteraceae), although they branched close to each other, no
unique character common to them was identified, indicating that they are highly divergent. The exact branching
position of the Xanthobacter was also not resolved in these
cliques. In some cliques, it appeared as an outgroup of the
Bradyrhizobiaceae (as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 2),
whereas in others it was placed in the middle of the Rhizobiaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae families (as seen for the
Aurantiomonas).

Phylogenomic analyses of alpha proteobacteria
Table 1 lists some characteristics of various α-proteobacterial genomes that have been sequenced. The genomes vary
in size from less than 1 Mb for Neorickettsia sennetsu to
more than 9.0 Mb for Bradyrhizobium japonicum. To identify proteins that are distinguishing features of various
higher taxonomic groups within α-proteobacteria, systematic Blastp searches were performed on each ORF in
the genomes of B. japonicum USDA 110, Brucella suis 1330,
Caulobacter crescentus CB15, Gluconobacter oxydans 621H,
Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, Nitrobacter winogradskyi
Nb-255, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM 12444,
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1, Silicibacter sp. TM1040, Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170 and Wolbachia (Drosophila
melanogaster) endosymbiont (see Methods section). The
genomes chosen covered all main taxonomic groups
within the sequenced α-proteobacteria. These analyses
have identified large numbers of proteins that are
uniquely found in particular groups of α-proteobacteria.
A brief description of these results is given below.
Proteins that are distinguishing features of all (or most)
alpha proteobacteria
We previously described 6 proteins (viz. CC1365,
CC1725, CC1887, CC2102, CC3292 and CC3319) that
appeared distinctive characteristics of α-proteobacteria
[17]. The α-proteobacterial specificity of these proteins in
earlier work was only assessed by means of Blastp searches
and it was not confirmed by PSI-Blast, as in the present
work (see Methods). Further, since the earlier work, the
number of sequenced α-proteobacteria and other
genomes has more than doubled. Hence, it was important
to confirm the α-proteobacteria specificity of these proteins. Our results reveal that four of these proteins viz.
CC1365, CC2102, CC3292 and CC3319, are indeed specific for the α-proteobacteria as a whole, whereas for the
remaining two proteins homologs showing significant
similarities are also found in other bacteria. Of these four
proteins, CC3292 is present in all sequenced α-proteobacteria including Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, which is the
smallest known free-living bacterium [2]. The protein
CC2102 is only missing in P. ubique, while the other two
proteins are only missing in 1–2 rickettsiae species
(CC1365) and P. ubique (CC3319). These proteins, which
are uniquely present in virtually all α-proteobacteria, provide distinguishing markers for this Class of bacteria (Fig.
3).

In earlier work, 9 proteins were identified that were
present in nearly all α-proteobacteria, except the Rickettsiales [17]. These latter species are all intracellular bacteria
that have lost many genes that are not required under
these conditions [3,34]. The Blastp and PSI-Blast reexamination of these proteins have confirmed that 7 of these
proteins (CC0100, CC0520, CC1211, CC1886, CC2245,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/106

CC3010 and CC3470) exhibit the indicated specificity.
Except for CC0520 and CC3470, the other five proteins
are also found in P. ubique, providing evidence for its
placement within α-proteobacteria [2]. These results also
provide evidence that P. ubique is not specifically related
to the Rickettsiales. The phylogenomic distributions of
these genes/proteins can be explained by either their evolution after the divergence of the Rickettsiales (Fig. 3), or by
gene loss from this lineage.
Proteins that are distinguishing features of the Rhizobiales
species
The Rhizobiales species comprise more than 1/3rd of the
sequenced α-proteobacterial genomes (see Table 1). This
order includes a wide assortment of species many of
which interact with the eukaryotic organisms to produce
diverse effects. This group includes various rhizobia
(Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium) and Bradyrhizobia species that induce root nodules in plants and live
symbiotically within them to enable nitrogen fixation [46,35,36]. Another Rhizobiaceae species, A. tumefaciens,
induces Crown gall disease (tumors) in plants [37]. Bartonella and Brucella species are intracellular pathogens
responsible for a number of diseases in human and animals including trench fever and brucellosis [7,38-40].
Other members of this order exhibit enormous versatility
in terms of their metabolic capabilities and life styles
[1,41,42]. Earlier studies identified six proteins that
appeared distinctive characteristics of the Rhizobiales species [17]. Reexamination of these proteins by the more
stringent criteria used in the present work confirmed that
three of these proteins (BQ00720, BQ07670 and
BQ12030) are indeed specific for the Rhizobiales and they
are present in virtually all sequenced species from this
large order. In addition to the Rhizobiales, these proteins
are also present in Stappia aggregata, which is presently
grouped with the Rhodobacterales [12], but was originally
known as a strain of Agrobacterium [43].

New blast searches on the genomes of B. japonicum, B. suis,
M. loti and N. winogradskyi have identified large number of
other proteins that are specific for different subgroups
within the Rhizobiales order. Seven proteins listed in Table
2A are uniquely present in most of the sequenced species
belonging to the Rhizobiaceae (Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium,
Agrobacterium), Brucellaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae (Mesorhizobium) and Aurantimonadaceae families. The absence of
many of these proteins in Bartonella species is probably
due to gene loss [7,34]. These groups form a well-defined
clade with high bootstrap scores in the NJ, MP and ML
trees (see Fig. 1) and the genes for them likely evolved in
a common ancestor of these genera/families (Fig. 3).
Another 9 proteins (Table 2B) are uniquely present in
most of the above species except Aurantimonas, which
forms outgroup of the Rhizobiaceae, Brucellaceae, Bartonel-

laceae and Phyllobacteriaceae families (Figs. 1 and 2) [29].
Thus, the genes for these proteins have evolved after the
branching of Aurantimonadaceae (Fig. 3). For six of the
proteins in Tables 2A and 2B (marked with *), homologs
with low E values are also found in S. aggregata, providing
further evidence for its relatedness to the Rhizobiaceae family. Nine other proteins in Table 2C are found in most
Rhizobiaceae species and M. loti, but they are missing in
Bartonella and Brucella species. Although these proteins
suggest a closer relationship between the Rhizobiaceae and
Phyllobacteriaceae families, it is more likely that their genes
have been lost from the Bartonella and Brucella species
[34], which are intracellular bacteria. Additionally, some
proteins were only found in either Mesorhizobium and
Rhizobium, or Mesorhizobium and Sinorhizobium (Table
2D). These analyses have also identified 43 proteins that
are uniquely present in all four sequenced Brucella species
and many other proteins that are present in either three or

two of the sequenced Brucella species (see Additional file
1).
The analyses of proteins in the genomes of B. japonicum
and N. winogradskyi have identified 12 proteins that are
uniquely present in either all (or most) of the sequenced
Bradyrhizobiaceae species as well as X. autotrophicus (Table
3A). The species from these two families form a strongly
supported clade in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1)[29].
Sixty-two additional proteins in Table 3B are uniquely
present in various species belonging to the Bradyrhizobiaceae family (i.e. Bradyrhizobium, Nitrobacter, Rhodopseudomonas). Many other proteins (see Additional file 2) are
only found in two of the three Bradyrhizobiaceae genera
and their distributions can result from gene losses, lateral
gene transfers (LGTs), or other mechanisms.

Proteins that are distinguishing features of the
Rhodobacterales species
The order Rhodobacterales is a heterogeneous lineage of
bacteria that exhibit much diversity in terms of their
metabolism and cell division cycles [1,13]. This group
includes many photosynthetic bacteria that are capable of
CO2 as well as nitrogen fixation and also many chemoorganotrophs that can metabolize various sulfur-containing

compounds [44,45]. A number of budding, stalk forming
and prosthecate bacteria also belong to this group [46]. In
addition to many completely sequenced genomes (see
Table 1), information for several other species belonging
to this order (e.g. Sulfitibacter, Oceanicola, Loktanella, Jannaschia, Dinoroseobacter, Roseovarius and Sagittula) is available in the NCBI database. To identify proteins that are
specific for the Rhodobacterales, phylogenomic analyses

were carried out on various ORFs in the genomes of R.
sphaeroides 2.4.1 and Silicibacter sp. TM1040.
These studies have identified 29 proteins that are present
in all-available Rhodobacterales species (Table 4A), but
these proteins as well as those listed in Table 4B and 4C
are not found in H. neptunium, Oceanicaulis alexandrii,
Maricaulis maris or Stappia aggregata. These latter species
are presently grouped with the Rhodobacterales [12], how-

ever, the absence of various Rhodobacterales-specific proteins in them and phylogenetic studies indicate that the
placement of these species within this order is incorrect
and needs be revised. In phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for many proteins, O. alexandrii and
M. maris consistently branched with the Caulobacter rather
than the well-defined clade of Rhodobacterales (Figs. 1 and
2) [29]. The studies by Badger et al. [47] also provide

strong evidence for the grouping of H. neptunium with the
Caulobacterales.
Six additional proteins in Table 4B are present in most of
the Rhodobacterales species, but they are missing in R.
sphaeroides and P. denitrificans, which form a distinct clade
that appears as the outgroup of other Rhodobacterales species (Fig. 1)[29]. Thus, the genes for these proteins have
likely evolved after the branching of these two genera.
Thirteen additional proteins, which are only found in Silicibacter and Roseobacter genera (Table 4C) support a close
relationship among them, as seen in phylogenetic trees
(Fig. 1).
Of the proteins that are specific for Rhodobacterales, two of
them (YP_613058 and YP_613059 in Table 4A, corresponding to proteins ABK27256 and ABK27255 in R. capsulatus genome) were previously identified as part of a
complex referred to as gene transfer agent [48], based on
similarity to certain virus-like elements. Another protein
in the same category (viz. ABK27253) is specific for the
Rhodobacter genus. The significance of these results is presently unclear.
Proteins that are distinctive characteristics of the
Caulobacterales
The order Caulobacterales is comprised of a single family
with only four genera [12,49]. These chemoorganotrophic
bacteria are commonly found in marine aerobic environments and they are distinguished by their ability to form
stalked cells and unusual cell division cycle [49,50]. The
complete genome of only C. crescentus, which is the beststudied organism from this group, is presently available
[51]. However, as discussed above, a number of other species which are presently classified as Rhodobacterales viz. O.
alexandrii, M. maris, H. neptunium and also Parvularcula
bermudensis, consistently branch with C. crescentus in different phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1 and 2) [29,47]. Thus,
phylogenomic analysis of the ORFs from C. crescentus
genome was of much interest.

These analyses have identified 2 proteins (CC0486 and
CC2480), which are uniquely present in this species as
well as O. alexandrii, M. maris, H. neptunium and P. bermudensis (Table 5) One additional protein, CC2764 is
present in all of these species except H. neptunium. The
remaining eight proteins in Table 5 are only found in C.
crescentus, O. alexandrii and M. maris, indicating that the
latter two species are more closely related to C. crescentus
in comparison to either H. neptunium or P. bermudensis.
These results are strongly supported by the branching patterns of these species in phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1 and 2)
[29,47]. Previously, Badger et al. [46] have reported identification of 62 proteins that were only found in C. crescentus and H. neptunium. However, the blast threshold used
in this study to infer the absence of these proteins in other
species was very high i.e. 1e-10. By the criteria used in the
present work (see Methods), none of these 62 proteins
was found to be unique to these two species.
Proteins that are distinguishing characteristics of the
Sphingomonadales
The species belonging to the order Sphingomonadales are
present in both terrestrial and aquatic environments [52].
A distinguishing characteristic of many species from this
group is the presence of glycosphingolipids in their cell
envelope rather than lipopolysaccharides [52,53]. Several
species from this group (e.g. N. aromaticivorans) can
degrade a wide variety of aromatic hydrocarbons [52],
whereas others such as Zymomonas mobilis, can highly efficiently ferment sugar to ethanol [53], making them of
much interest and importance from biotechnological
standpoints. This group also includes phototrophic
organisms (e.g. Erythrobacter litoralis), which contain bacteriochlorophyll a and can derive significant fraction of
their metabolic energy via anaerobic photosynthesis [54].
The complete genomes of 5 species from this order are
now available (see Table 1). In addition, large numbers of
sequences for Sphingomonas sp. SKA58, are also available
in the NCBI database. Blast searches on the ORFs in the
genome of N. aromaticivorans have identified 16 proteins

(Table 6A) that are uniquely present in all 6 of the Sphingomonadales species for which information is available.
Thirteen additional proteins (Table 6B) are present in all
other Sphingomonadales species, except Z. mobilis, which is
the deepest branching species within this group (Fig. 1).
The genes for these proteins likely evolved after the
branching of Z. mobilis. Many other proteins are present in
only 3 or 4 of these species (viz. N. aromaticivorans, E. litoralis, S. alaskensis, S. wittichiii and Sphingomonas sp. SKA58)
(see Additional file 3) and their phylogenomic distribution can result from a variety of mechanisms including
shared ancestry, gene loss and LGTs among these species.

Proteins and indels that are specific for the
Rhodospirillales species
The order Rhodospirillales is comprised of diverse species
including some photosynthetic and magnetotactic bacteria, some acidophiles as well as other bacteria commonly
associated with flowers, fruits and fermented beverages
that are involved in the partial oxidation of carbohydrates
and alcohols [55]. The order is made up of two main families, Rhodospirillaceae and Acetobacteraceae [12,55]. The
complete genomes of four species, two from each family,
Rhodospirillaceae (Magnetospirillum magnticum, R. rubrum)
and Acetobacteraceae (Acidiphilium cryptum and G. oxydans), are available (Table 1) [56,57]. Phylogenomic analyses of various ORFs in the genomes of G. oxydans and R.
rubrum have led to identification of one proteins,
GOX0963, which is uniquely found in all of these species
(Table 7A). Three other proteins in this Table are present
in at least 3 of the 4 species from this order. This table also
lists 14 proteins each that are distinctive characteristics of
either the Acetobacteraceae (Table 7B) or the Rhodospirillaceae (Table 7C) families, providing molecular markers
for these families. We have also identified a 25 aa insert in
a conserved region of the RNA polymerase beta subunit
(RpoB) that is unique to various sequenced Rhodospirillales species, but not found in any other bacteria (Fig. 5).

We have also identified a 4 aa insert in a highly conserved
region of Gyrase B that is mainly specific for the species
from this order (Fig. 4). This indel is present in all available Sphingomonadales species, but it is not found in most
other alpha proteobacteria or other bacteria (results not
shown). Besides Sphingomonadales, a similar size indel is
also present in three other species (viz. C. leidyia, R. blasticus, and Pesudorhodobacter incheonensis). Because other
Rhodobacterales or Caulobacter species lack this insert, the
presence of this indel in these three species could be either
due to LGTs or possibly due to taxonomic misclassification of these species.

Partial 4
Partial sequence alignments of DNA Gyrase B showing a 4 aa insert that is mainly specific for the Sphingomonadales species. A
4–5 aa insert present in some other α-proteobacteria could be due to either LGTs or taxonomic anomalies. The dashes (-)

this insert) is not shown.

Proteins that are specific for the Rickettsiales
The Rickettsiales species are intracellular pathogens
responsible for a number of diseases in humans and other
animals [3,34]. This order is comprised of three families,
Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae and Holosporaceae. All of
the sequenced genomes are from the first two families.
Phylogenomic analysis of various ORFs from the genome
of Wolbachia (D. melanogaster) endosymbiont has identified 3 proteins viz. WD0161, WD0715 and WD0771
(Table 8A) that are specific for the entire Rickettsiales

order. Five other proteins in Table 8B (viz. WD0083,
WD0157, WD0821, WD0827 and WD0863) are present
in all sequenced Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Wolbachia and Neorickettsia species (belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family), but they are not found in any of the Rickettsiaceae or
other bacteria. Ten additional proteins (Table 8C) are
uniquely present in the Ehrlichia, Anaplasma and Wolbachia species, but are absent in Neorickettsia. In view of
the deep branching of Neorickettsia in comparison to these
other genera (Fig. 1), the genes for these proteins have

Conclusion

α-proteobacteria-specific proteins are present at different
phylogenetic depths and they provide important information regarding the evolution of these bacteria. This work
also describes two novel conserved indels in important
housekeeping genes (viz. Gyrase B and RpoB) that are distinctive characteristics of the Sphingomonadales and Rhodospirillales orders, respectively. These indels are in
addition to many other α-proteobacteria-specific indels
that have been described in earlier work [16,58].

In this work, we have used a combined phylogenetic and
phylogenomic approach to examine the evolutionary
relationships among α-proteobacteria. Our analyses have
identified large numbers of genes/proteins that are
uniquely found in α-proteobacteria at various phylogenetic depths (Fig. 3). These include several proteins that
are distinctive characteristics of all α-proteobacteria, as
well as many proteins that constitute the unique repertoires of either all of the main orders of α-proteobacteria
(viz. Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Caulobacterales) or its different families (viz. Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae,
Rhodospirillaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Brucellaceae and Bartonellaceae). In addition, numerous other

Based upon these α-proteobacteria-specific proteins and
conserved indels, it is now possible to define nearly all of
the higher taxonomic groups (i.e. most orders and many
families) within α-proteobacteria in clear and definitive
molecular terms based upon multiple characteristics (Fig.
3). The species distribution profiles of these α-proteobacteria-specific proteins and indels also provide important
information regarding their branching order and interrelationships, which are highly concordant with each other
(c.f. Fig. 26 in ref. [16] with Fig. 3 in this work). Importantly, the relationships that emerge from these phylogenomic analyses (Fig. 3) are in excellent agreement with
the branching patterns of these species in different phylo-

likely evolved after the branching of Neorickettsia. In earlier work, a number of proteins that appeared specific for
the Rickettsiaceae family were also identified [17]. Additional Blastp and PSI-Blast searches on these proteins confirm that three of these proteins viz. RP030, RP187 are
RP192, are indeed specific for the Rickettsiaceae family. Of
these, RP030 is also found in Orientia tsutsugamushi.

and Rhodobacterales was not resolved. In contrast, using
the character compatibility approach, the Caulobacterales
and related species were found to consistently branch in
between the Rhizobiales and the Rhodobacterales (Fig. 2).
Previously, this approach has also proven useful in clarifying the phylogenetic placement of Salinibacter ruber,
which was not resolved by other methods [33,59].
The phylogenetic studies presented here reveal that a
number of species belonging to the Hyphomonadaceae
family (viz. M. maris, O. alexandrii and H. neptunium), for
which sequence information is available and that are presently grouped with the Rhodobacterales, branch reliably
with the Caulobacterales (Figs 1 and 2)[29,47]. The same is
also true for P. bermudensis, which is the only species from
Parvularculales order, for which sequence information is
available. The grouping of these species with the Caulobacterales is independently strongly supported by phylogenomic studies, where a number of proteins that are
unique for C. crescentus were present in these species and
at the same time many proteins that are distinctive characteristics of the Rhodobacterales were absent in them. These
results make a strong case for the transfer of these Hyphomonadaceae species and also P. bermudensis to an
expanded Caulobacterales order [29,47]. Another taxonomic anomaly identified by the present study concerns
the phylogenetic position of Stappia aggregata. This species
was originally identified as an Agrobacterium-related species, but later transferred to the Rhodobacterales order [43].
However, the shared presence of many Rhizobiales -specific proteins by S. aggregata and the absence of various
Rhodobacterales-specific proteins in it, strongly suggest that
it should be regrouped with the Rhizobiaceae-Phyllobacteriacea species.
The overwhelming majority of the identified α-proteobacteria-specific proteins do not have a homolog showing
significant similarity in any other bacteria. The group-specificities of these proteins indicate that their genes have
evolved in a common ancestor of these particular groups
or clades of α-proteobacteria (Fig. 3). The clade specificities of these proteins also provide evidence that following
their evolution, their genes have been transmitted primarily in a vertical manner, and that non-specific mechanisms such as LGTs have not played a significant role in
their species distribution. Similar inferences have been
reached in earlier studies for proteins that are specific for
other higher taxa of bacteria [20,22-24,33,60]. Most of the
α-proteobacteria-specific proteins identified in the
present work are of unknown function. A number of these
proteins are present in the genomes in clusters of two or
three, suggesting that they may form functional units and
could be involved in related functions [18,26,48,61]. The
retention of these α-proteobacteria-specific proteins and
conserved indels by the indicated clades of α-proteobacte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/106

ria over long evolutionary periods strongly suggests that
they serve essential functions in these groups of bacteria.
Hence, studies on their cellular functions may lead to the
discovery of novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are distinctive characteristics of either all αproteobacteria or their particular subgroups. Lastly, the
primary sequences of many of these genes/proteins are
highly conserved and they provide novel means for the
identification and characterization of these bacteria by
PCR-based and immunological methods.

Methods
Identification of proteins that are specific for alpha
proteobacteria
The Blastp searches were carried out on each ORF in the
genomes of B. japonicum USDA 110, B. suis 1330, C. crescentus CB15, G. oxydans 621H, M. loti MAFF303099, N.
winogradskyi Nb-255, N. aromaticivorans DSM 12444, R.
sphaeroides 2.4.1, Silicibacter sp. TM1040, R. rubrum ATCC
11170 and Wolbachia (D. melanogaster) endosymbiont to
identify proteins that are uniquely present in α-proteobacteria species at different phylogenetic depths. The blast
searches were performed against all organisms (i.e. nonredundant (nr) database) using the default parameters,
without the low complexity filter [62]. The proteins that
were of interest were those where either all significant hits
were from the indicated groups (or orders) of α-proteobacteria, or which involved a large increase in E values
from the last hit belonging to a particular group to the first
hit from any other group and the E values for the latter
hits were > 1e -4, indicating weak similarity that could
occur by chance. However, higher E values were often considered significant for smaller proteins as the magnitude
of the E value depends upon the length of the query
sequence [62]. All promising proteins were further analyzed using the position-specific iterated (PSI)-Blast program [62]. In this study, we have also retained a few
proteins where 1 or 2 isolated species from other groups
had acceptable E values, as they provide possible cases of
LGTs. For all of the proteins that are specific for α-proteobacteria, their protein ID's, accession numbers and any
information regarding cellular functions (such as COG
number or presence of any conserved domain) were tabulated and are presented. In describing various proteins in
the text, "bll, bsl, blr", "BQ", "BR or BRA" "CC," "GOX"
"ml", "Nwi", "Saro", "RSP", "TM1040", "Rru" and "WD"
indicate the identification numbers of the proteins in the
genomes of B. japonicum, Bartonella quintana, B. suis, C.
crescentus, G. oxydans, M. loti, N. winogradskyi Nb-255, N.
aromaticivorans, R. sphaeroides 2.4.1, Silicibacter sp.
TM1040, R. rubrum and Wolbachia (Dros.) endosymbiont,
respectively.

Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences for 12 conserved proteins (viz.
RNA polymerase β and β' subunits, alanyl-tRNA synthetase, phenyalanyl-tRNA synthetase, arginyl-tRNA synthetase, protein synthesis elongation factors EF-Tu and EFG, RecA, Gyrase A, Gyrase B, Hsp60 and Hsp70) for different species were downloaded from the NCBI database and
aligned using the CLUSTAL × program [63]. In addition to
the sequences for 50 α-proteobacteria species, sequences
for two deep-branching species viz. Helicobacter pylori and
Campylobacter jejuni [58], were also included for rooting
purposes. The sequence alignments for all 12 proteins
were concatenated into a single large file and poorly
aligned regions were removed using the Gblocks 0.91b
program [64]. The final sequence alignment that was used
for phylogenetic analyses contained 7652 aligned positions. A neighbour-joining tree based on this alignment
was constructed based on Kimura's two parameter model
distances using the TREECON program [65]. Maximumlikelihood and MP trees were computed using the WAG+F
model plus a gamma distribution with four categories
using the TREE-PUZZLE [66] and Mega 3.1 program [67],
respectively. All trees were bootstrapped 100 times [68],
unless otherwise indicated.

The character compatibility analysis was performed on a
concatenated sequences for the above 12 proteins for 25
α-proteobacteria species representing all its main orders
plus two outgroup species (i.e. H. pylori and C. jejuni) [32].
Using the program "DUALSITE" [32], all sites in the
sequence alignments where only two amino acid states
were found, with each state present in at least two species,
were selected. All columns where any gap was present in
any of the species were omitted. The useful two state sites
were converted into a binary file of "0, 1" characters using
the DUALSITE program and this file was used for compatibility analysis [32]. The compatibility analysis was carried out using the CLIQUE program from the PHYLIP
(ver. 3.5c) program package [68] to identify the largest
clique(s) of compatible characters. The cliques were
drawn and the numbers of characters that distinguished
different nodes were indicated.
Identification of conserved indels specific for αproteobacteria subgroups
Multiple sequence alignments for various proteins constructed in this work were visually inspected to search for
any indels in a conserved region that was unique to particular subgroups or orders of α-proteobacteria. The groupspecificity of any indel was evaluated by carrying out blast
searches on a short segment of the sequence (between
80–120 aa) containing the indel and flanking conserved
regions against the non-redundant database. The
sequence information for various α-proteobacteria was
compiled into signature files that are presented. Sequence

information for all other groups of bacteria, which lack
these inserts, is not shown.

Authors' contributions
The initial blastp searches on various genomes were carried out by RSG with the computer assistance provided by
Venus Wong. AM analyzed the results of these blast
searches to identify various group-specific proteins and
confirmed their specificities by means of PSI-blast and
genomic blasts. Phylogenetic analyses and identification
of conserved indels was done by RSG. RSG was also
responsible for directing this study, for final evaluation of
the results, and for writing this manuscript. All authors
have read and approved the submitted manuscript.
