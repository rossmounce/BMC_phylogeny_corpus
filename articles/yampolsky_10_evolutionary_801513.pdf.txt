Abstract
Background: Harnessing vast amounts of genomic data in phylogenetic context stemming from massive
sequencing of multiple closely related genomes requires new tools and approaches. We present a tool for the
genome-wide analysis of frequencies and patterns of amino acid substitutions in multiple alignments of genes’
coding regions, and a database of amino acid substitutions in the phylogeny of 12 Drosophila genomes. We
illustrate the use of these resources to address three types of evolutionary genomics questions: about fluxes in
amino acid composition in proteins, about asymmetries in amino acid substitutions and about patterns of
molecular evolution in duplicated genes.
Results: We demonstrate that amino acid composition of Drosophila proteins underwent a significant shift over
the last 70 million years encompassed by the studied phylogeny, with less common amino acids (Cys, Met, His)
increasing in frequency and more common ones (Ala, Leu, Glu) becoming less frequent. These fluxes are strongly
correlated with polarity of source and destination amino acids, resulting in overall systematic decrease of mean
polarity of amino acids found in Drosophila proteins. Frequency and radicality of amino acid substitutions are
higher in paralogs than in orthologous single-copy genes and are higher in gene families with paralogs than in
gene families without surviving duplications. Rate and radicality of substitutions, as expected, are negatively
correlated with overall level and uniformity of gene expression. However, these correlations are not observed for
substitutions occurring in duplicated genes, indicating a different selective constraint on the evolution of
paralogous sequences. Clades resulting from duplications show a marked asymmetry in rate and radicality of
amino acid substitutions, possibly a signal of widespread neofunctionalization. These patterns differ among protein
families of different functionality, with genes coding for RNA-binding proteins differing from most other functional
groups in terms of amino acid substitution patterns in duplicated and single-copy genes.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that deep phylogenetic analysis of amino acid substitutions can reveal interesting
genome-wide patterns. Amino acid composition of drosophilid proteins is shaped by fluxes similar to those
previously observed in prokaryotic, yeast and mammalian genomes, indicating globally present patterns. Increased
frequency and radicality of amino acid substitutions in duplicated genes and the presence of asymmetry of these
parameters between paralogous clades indicate widespread neofunctionalization among paralogs as the
mechanism of duplication retention.

Background
Until recently, evolutionary genomics questions, including questions about amino acid composition of proteins,
patterns of stabilising and positive selection and
mechanisms of retention of duplicated genes and new
function evolution, were typically answered either by
analyzing phylogenies of select gene families [1,2] or by
full-genome analysis of triplets of genomes with two
ingroup genomes compared to measure evolutionary
rates, while the third, outgroup, genome used to polarize
the observed changes [3]. As the strategy of genome
sequencing shifts from broad taxonomic coverage to
sequencing multiple closely related genomes [4], a need
arises in a set of tools to accomplish a phylogenetic analysis of amino acid substitutions in coding portions of a
large number of protein families simultaneously and to
address the question of generality of patterns observed
in limited and possibly biased set of select gene families.
Questions that can be asked using such approach
include, but certainly are not limited to enquiries about
long-term changes in amino acid compositions of proteins, about selective constrains and pressures across the
genome and evolution of novel gene functions by retention and modification of duplicated genes. Here we present a tool to accomplish phylogenetic analysis of amino
acids substitutions on the whole-genome scale using
multiple amino acid alignments of over 11,000 gene
families from twelve completely sequenced Drosophila
genomes and illustrate its utility by the analysis of the
resulting database of amino acid substitutions spanning
70 million years of drosophilid proteins evolution.
Global patterns of amino acid compositions of proteins
is thought to not be at a detailed balance, but rather
appears to be gradually evolving by consistently adding
rare to and removing common amino acids from the
amino acid repertoire of protein sequences [3,5]. There is
an on-going debate on whether is pattern reflects the
order in which amino acids have been added to the
genetic code [3,6] or is caused by biases in mutability of
particular codons [7-9]. As pointed out by [8], one way to
address this controversy is to analyze the observed trends
in a range of genomes of increasing degree of divergence:
if the observed patterns are caused by the effect of amino
acid polymorphism reflecting mutation-selection biases
they are expected to become less pronounced as divergence between genomes increases. Furthermore, there
may be substantial differences in selection pressures on
reciprocal amino acid substitutions [10]: changes from
polar to non-polar amino acids in human proteins are
more permissive than vice-versa. Such asymmetry and
the degree to which is can contribute to the large-scale
changes in amino acid composition has not yet been
measured on the scale of several genomes.

Differences in patterns of selective pressure have also
been predicted between evolutionary retained duplicated
genes and single-copy genes [11-14]. Duplicated genes
can persist in genomes either because one of the copies
has acquired a new function (neofunctionalization
[15-17]), or because both copies are now needed to perform the function or functions previously accomplished
by a single copy (subfunctionalization). Subfunctionalizaton can occur either by means of partitioning of the
ancestral functions between the two copies (for example
by loss of one of alternative promoters in each copy), or
by means of balanced degradation, i.e., fixation of hypomorphic alleles in each copy [18,19]. Each of these
mechanisms implies relaxation of stabilizing selection,
resulting in faster evolution in paralogs than in singlecopy genes. Specifically, pure neofunctionalization
occurs by accumulation of mutations in one of the
copies, while the other remains under stabilizing selection [13,14,16,17]. Subfunctionalization occurring
through balanced degradation, on the other hand, is
accompanied by accumulation of deleterious mutations
in both paralogs. Finally, subfunctionalization occurring
by tissue- or developmental stage-specialization of gene
expression without a change in functionality would result
in retention of stabilizing selection action in both paralogs. It is much harder to make predictions about other
types of subfunctionalization, such as subdivision of preexisting multiple substrate specificity between duplicated
genes, because the two functions may depend on different parts of coding portion of the gene and, therefore,
retaining one but not the other may relax selective constraints acting on at least part of the sequence. Previous
studies of duplicated genes in Drosophila genomes (e.g.,
[19]) detected elevated signal of positive selection in a
subset of gene families with duplications using Ka /K s
approach. Here we report a genome-wide analysis of differences between duplicated and single copy genes in frequency and spectrum of amino acid substitutions.

Results
Application of AcidMiner to Drosophila data: a database
of amino acid substitutions in 12 genomes

The main purpose of AcidMiner is to extract amino
acid substitutions data from multiple alignments and to
expand them in the form of relational tables so then
standard SQL can be used to perform queries by any
combination of criteria and to calculate aggregates.
AcidMiner takes raw data in the form of multiple alignments and Newick protein and species trees, processes
it to produce derivative data such as parsimony-based
polarization of substitutions and stores the result in a
relational database structure. The raw data for the analysis reported here was a set of multiple amino acids

Yampolsky and Bouzinier BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 4):S10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S4/S10

alignments from 12 completely sequenced Drosophila
genomes ([4,19]; see Methods). A set of SQL queries
that can be run against this database to produce custom
datasets with given restrictions and/or calculate any
aggregates including statistical parameters on different
datasets. In addition, for tasks not easily expressible in
SQL, data already in the database to produce further
derivative data. Examples of such tasks are: defining
clades for each duplication, calculating number of substitutions in each clade (including cases when we can
not unambiguously determine exactly which substitutions has occurred), calculating protein lengths in clades,
calculating ages (timing data) of substitutions and
duplications.
The resulting database in its current form includes
3,697,627 amino acid substitutions occurring in 12 drosophilid genomes spanning 11258 gene families. It consists of 14 tables defining the base data model. Two
additional tables contain preloaded data for gene ontology and amino acid substitution properties, such as
pair-wise change in polarity. Main tables include
Families table, Tree Structure tables for protein and species trees with a separate record for each tree node and
a branch terminating in this node, a Substitutions table
with a record for each unambiguous and ambiguous
substitution including a reference to branch where it
occurred (or might have occurred for ambiguous substitutions) and a Duplications table, which includes phylogenetic information about each duplication and the two
clades generated it. The database is available for download from AcidMiner website [20] in the form of a virtual machine. Any standard SQL tool can be used;
queries for most of the queries we used for this study
are also available in the AcidMiner repository, along
with the source code and a detailed description of the
database structure.
Fluxes and asymmetries in amino acid substitutions

Figure 1 shows the results of amino acid fluxes analysis
(data available in Additional file 1). As has been previously shown [3], frequent amino acids, in particular
alanine, glutamic acid, leucine and proline, tend to be
lost more often than created in protein sequences, while
rare amino acids (in particular cysteine, histidine and
methionine) are created more often than lost (Fig. 1 A,
B). There is a strong rank correlation between relative
gain of amino acids in this study and in Ref [3], based
on a variety of genome triplets, mostly prokaryotic (Fig.
1C). The general pattern of relative gain-loss is the same
in the entire 12-genome phylogeny (Fig. 1A, red bars)
and in pairs of sister species of different divergence
depth (Fig. 1A, blue bars), however, there are exceptions. For example, phenylalanine and asparagines,
which are moderate gainers in the entire phylogeny,

show a net loss in the shallowest branch (D. persimulans/D. pseudoobscura), while arginine, a weak loser in
the whole phylogeny shows a strong net gain in the
shallow branches.
Contrary to the prediction based on the effect of
intraspecific polymorphism [7,9], the observed gain-loss
pattern does not become less pronounced as the divergence between genomes increases (Fig 1 D, E ; Additional file 2). Rank correlation with the global gain-loss
pattern from Ref [3] slightly increases with branch
depth, while mean pair-wise asymmetry (|D| calculated
for each amino acid pair) and correlation with amino
acid frequency remains flat. There is a slight tendency
towards decrease of mean asymmetry (|D|) with the
depth of phylogeny (Fig. 1 E), but neither of the pairwise comparison of shallow vs. deeper branches is
significant.
Pair-wise asymmetry of amino acid gains and losses
had a clear manifestation in terms of average change in
amino acid polarity. Amino acid pairs with the largest
polarity gain had the highest asymmetry towards net
gain of the less polar amino acid (Fig. 2A). The degree
of polarity asymmetry differed among genes of different
functionality (Fig. 2B): nucleic acid- and nucleotidebinding proteins had the strongest asymmetry towards
net gain of non-polar amino acids, while in receptor and
transporter proteins such asymmetry was not observed.
Likewise, net loss of polarity was the highest in proteins
with intracellular localization, intermediate in proteins
with extracellular localization and the lowest in membrane proteins, indicating the role of hydrophobicity of
the protein’s cellular environment on relative gain and
loss rate of polar and non-polar amino acids.
Frequencies and radicality of amino acid substitutions in
duplicated genes

Duplicated genes appeared to accumulate more amino acid
changes since duplication (per unit of time measured in
units of synonymous substitutions per 4-fold degenerative
site) than single copy genes (Fig. 3). Although the difference
was statistically significant, it was not drastic: among 1701
gene families with duplications and with at least 1 substitution in both duplicated and unduplicated parts of the phylogeny paralogs accumulated more substitutions per unit of
branch lengths than single copy genes in 988 families (58%;
sign test P<0.00001). This relationship also varied across
functional groups of genes, being the strongest in non-TF
DNA-binding proteins, weaker in enzymes and proteinbinding proteins and undetectable or reversed in other
functional groups of proteins. Overall the rate of substitutions was the greatest in paralogs and the lowest in unduplicated sections of phylogenies of gene families with
duplications, both when all substitutions and unambiguous
substitutions only were considered (Fig. 3 inset).

synonymous substitutions per 4-fold degenerative site [4].

Paralogs also evolved by more radical substitutions.
Across functional groups of proteins (with the exception
of transporter proteins) duplicated portions of phylogenies accumulated amino acid substitutions with greater
average absolute change in polarity (Fig. 4A), while single copy genes typically did not differ significantly from
gene families without duplications. Likewise, both overall and in every single functional category, paralogs differed by amino acid pairs with lower Exchangeability
[21] (Fig. 4B). Again, single copy genes in families with
duplications were intermediate between genes with no
duplications and paralogs overall and typically did not
differ from genes with no duplications within each functional category.
As expected, substitution rates and radicalilty
decreased with mean expression rate in the whole fly
and increased with the coefficient of variance of expression rate across larval and adult tissues [22] (Fig. 5), corroborating previously observed patterns of stronger
selective constraints in highly expressed genes and in

household genes [23-25]. However, both effects were
much less pronounced in paralogs than in single-copy
genes; neither regression over mean expression level was
significant (Fig. 5 A, B) and, while relative rate of substitutions increased with CV of expression rates across tissues, difference in polarity showed no correlation in
paralogs. To summarize this pattern, the rate and radicality of duplicated genes evolution appeared to be uniformly high independently from gene expression rate
and ubiquity. Data on rates and radicality of amino acid
substitutions organized by gene family are available in
Additional file 3.
Clade asymmetries in duplicated genes

counts show a significant clade asymmetry in a large

number of tests is different, because asymmetry was
tested for all duplications, while other parameters –
only for duplications, in which both clades had at least
2 unambiguous substitutions. Excluding terminal
branches of the phylogeny, potentially contaminated by
substitutions in pseudogenes and therefore biased
towards clade asymmetry, does not change the result.
Clade asymmetries by molecular function categories
are presented on Fig. 6. Protein- and RNA-binding proteins were characterized by the highest asymmetry of
substitutions rates, while nucleotide-binding proteins
and transcription factors had the lowest (although only
enzymes vs. protein-binding proteins comparison is

significant by Tukey-Kramer test). Nucleotide-binding
proteins, on the other hand, demonstrated the highest
asymmetry in both absolute polarity change and exchangeability of substitutions in the two clades, along with
transcription factors, enzymes and structural proteins.
The lowest radicality clade asymmetry was seen in
RNA-binding and transporter proteins. Data on rates
and radicality of amino acid substitutions organized by
duplications are available in Additional file 4.

Discussion
Several caveats in the data and analysis require attention. Firstly, alignments we used may contain pairs of

paralogs, in which one of the copies is undergoing pseudogenization and is nor longer expressed, but has not
yet acquired a frameshift, which would allow it to be
recognized as a pseudogene. Indeed, there is a significant excess of nonsense mutations (per missense) present in the terminal branches of phylogeny (data not
presented), indicating presence of pseudogenes in the
alignments. Pairs of paralogs, in which one gene copy is
undergoing pseudogenization, will demonstrate clade
asymmetry, mimicking the signature of neofunctionalization. However, such paralogs are almost certainly present only in the most terminal branches of Drosophila
phylogeny spanning over 70 mln years, because the halflife of duplications, in which one of the copies undergoes pseudogenization, is 2-4 mln years (12; 26).
Terminal branches include a minority of duplications in
our database and excluding such branches from the analysis does not alter the results (Table 1). This indicates
that the observed clade asymmetry is not an artefact of
pseudogenes. A direct comparison of clade asymmetries
in terminal vs. non-terminal duplications is not possible
for two reasons. Firstly, there are much fewer substitutions in the terminal branches, so there is an intrinsic
difference in statistical power. Secondly, clade asymmetry analysis is based on unambiguous substitutions and
the frequency of unambiguous substitutions increases
with the depths of the phylogeny, possibly biasing such
comparison.
On the other hand, some true functional paralogs may
be missing from the alignments, particularly those

resulting from ancient duplications, due to homology
below the threshold used by the reciprocal BLAST algorithm (see Methods). This creates a bias towards less
divergent paralogs, reducing our ability to detect elevated rates of evolution in duplicated genes. Relative
magnitude of these opposing biases remains unknown.
Further, results presented in Table 1 do not necessarily indicate that clade asymmetries are more likely to
manifest themselves in substitution rates than in substitution radicality. The number of test surviving multiple
test correction probably reflects differences in statistical
power rather than a true biological phenomenon.
Systematic loss/gain asymmetry in amino acid composition in 12 Drosophila genomes corroborates patterns
previously observed in a variety of taxonomically diverse
triplets of genomes [3]. This pattern does not become
less pronounced as more and more distant genomes are
included into consideration, indicating that it is not
caused by the effect of polymorphisms reflecting
mutation-selection balance influenced by mutational
asymmetries [7,9].
We also demonstrate that this net loss/gain asymmetry is strongly correlated with source and destination
amino acid polarities: substitutions of polar amino acids
by non-polar ones have a higher net rate than the reciprocal substitutions. In the past we have demonstrated a
similar polarity-related asymmetry in selection coefficients against amino acid substitutions in human proteins [10]; however this asymmetry was largely limited
to strong selection (i.e., selection against clinically

important phenotypes) and was not seen in evolutionary
substitution rates.
One may hypothesise that replacing polar amino acids
by any is less disruptive for the protein function because
polar amino acids have a lower tendency to be located
internally in the tertiary protein structure [21]. If so, we
would expect the decrease of polarity due to amino acid
substitutions to be the lowest in membrane proteins, in
which polar amino acids in within-membrane domains
tend to be internally located. Indeed, the decrease of
polarity due to substitutions is the weakest in receptor
and transporter proteins, many of which have membrane-embedded hydrophobic regions (Fig. 2 B) and in
proteins with membrane localization (Fig. 2 C).
A question remains how is it possible that asymmetry
in amino acid gains and losses systematically removed

polar amino acids more often than non-polar ones
(Fig.2A) over 70 mln years of drosophilid evolution (and
actually over much longer period of evolution of proteins of much broader taxonomic spectrum [3])? There
is no evidence that the relationship shown on Fig. 2A
has a tendency to weaken in the most recent branches
of the phylogeny (data not reported), which would have
indicated an approach to an equilibrium. Rather, the frequencies of amino acids in proteins appear to be far
from an equilibrium and we observe a constant turnover
of polar amino acids due to more relaxed selective constraint acting on the amino acid of external location.
One may further speculate that perhaps such systematic
loss of surface polar amino acids would gradually
change protein folding as external sites become
occupied by more hydrophobic amino acid residuals.

and more radically than single copy genes in families
without extant duplications, indicating that duplications
are more likely to be retained in gene families with
weaker selective constraints.
Just like with the signed polarity change, the absolute
change of polarity is not significantly different between
duplicated and single copy genes among genes coding
for transporter proteins, corroborating the hypothesis of

This process may be a potentially important mechanism
of acquiring new functions by duplicated genes.
We have demonstrated that, in a genome-wide assessment, duplicated genes evolve both faster (higher Ka/Ks)
and through more radical amino acid substitutions
(higher |DPolarity|, lower exchangeability) than single
copy genes (Figs 3 and 4). Likewise, single copy genes in
families with extant duplications tend to evolve faster

the importance of relaxed selective constraint on surface
sites of water-soluble proteins (Fig. 4 A). (This difference is, however, significant for receptor proteins.) The
exchangeability index, on the other hand, is significantly
lower in duplicated transporter proteins, suggesting that
paralogs in these genes families do evolve through more
radical substitutions, just without systematic net loss of
polar residuals.
Data on the asymmetry of clades resulting from duplications supports the hypothesis of widespread neofunctionalization accompanying retention of duplicated genes: over

1/3 of all duplications show a significant asymmetry in
amino acid substitution rates with false discovery rate 0.05
and almost 1/5 of all substitution show asymmetry, which
stands Bonferroni correction (Table 1). Much fewer duplications show a significant asymmetry in radicality of substitutions, although about 6% have a significant asymmetry
in absolute polarity change (with false discovery rate 0.05).
Gene families of different functionality differ from each
other in the degree of clade asymmetry with a hint of a
negative correlation between asymmetry in rates (Fig. 6,
top) and asymmetry in radicality (Fig. 6, middle and

bottom). No molecular function category stands out in
terms of tendency to display signatures of neofunctionalization, although RNA-binding proteins have the lowest
(non significant) difference in rates and radicality of substitutions between duplicated and single copy genes (Fig. 3
and 4) and the lowest clade asymmetry of substitution
radicality in paralogs (Fig. 6), indicating that, perhaps, in
these proteins neofunctionalization is less common. Interestingly, transcription factors appear to show low neofunctionalization signal in terms of substitution rates (no
difference between duplicated and single-copy genes, Fig.
3; low asymmetry between paralogs, Fig 6, top), but a
strong neofunctionalization signal in terms of substitution
radicality (Fig 4; Fig. 6 middle and bottom). One may
hypothesize that positive selection for a novel functionality
can operate either by increased rate of substitutions, or by
favouring more radical changes without the increase of
rates.

Conclusions
We have designed a tool, which allows a detailed phylogenetic analysis of amino acid substitutions in a large
number of multiple alignments with or without duplicated genes present. The algorithm is capable to polarize
and establish phylogenetic position of all substitutions
for which it is possible (unambiguous) and to list all
possible alternatives for other, ambiguous substitutions.
It results in a database, which can be used to answer
questions about patterns of amino acids substitutions
genome-wide or in particular categories of genes such
as molecular functions or duplication status.
The analysis of such database of substitutions in 12 Drosophila genomes confirmed previously observed non-equilibrium patterns of net losses and gains of individual
amino acids, demonstrated that these patterns do not
weaken with the depth of phylogeny and revealed a strong
correlation between polarity of amino acid and propensity
to display a net loss. We hypothesize that this effect can
be explained by relaxed selective constraints on externally
located amino acid sites occupied by polar residuals. Evolution of duplicated genes is characterized by both higher
relative rate of substitution and more radical nature of
these substitutions, as compared to single copy genes. The
rate and radicality in paralogs displays a weaker relation
with mean expression rate and variance of expression
rates across tissues than in single copy genes. This pattern,
along with the strong asymmetry between clades resulting
from duplication events, indicates widespread neofunctionalization of retained duplications.

alignments and Newick protein and species trees into a
relational database of amino acid substitutions searchable by standard SQL queries and containing a number
of preset queries. Additionally, it allows further derivative data to be produced for tasks not easily expressible
in SQL. Code for such purposes can be written either in
Java or as stored procedures in the DBMS proprietary
language, which in some cases results in faster processing. AcidMiner Java code, custom DBMS procedures
and most of the complex SQL queries used in this study
are also available [20].
Protein alignments and corresponding phylogenies were
acquired from Dfam database at Indiana University
[19,27]. These alignments have been obtained by means of
modified reciprocal BLAST method [4,19]. Briefly (see
[19] for details), the results of an all-by-all comparison
between the 12 genomes using BLASTP are filtered to
retain as homologs all hits with E-values within two orders
of magnitude of the highest hit. Gene families (clusters of
homologs) are then deterimined by finding the maximally
connected clusters that are disjoint from one another
while discarding nonreciprocal relationships [19].
NOTUNG phylogenies reconciling topological incongruence between species trees and proteins trees [28]
were used to map duplications and substitutions. We
considered 11258 gene families (with at least 6 species
represented), which contained 8,766,256 amino acid
sites. Areas of alignments with >1 indels in a row in one
or more species were excluded from the analysis. Of the
amino acid sites retained for the analysis 2,131,864 sites
had at least one substitution in at least one clade. These
sites contained a total of 3,697,627 substitutions. A substitution was called unambiguous if it could be unequivocally polarized and placed on the phylogeny by the
genotype of the outgroup clade; there were 2,004,536
such substitutions. Substitutions without a single most
parsimonious placement were called ambiguous; such
substitutions were included into the rates calculated, but
excluded from the analysis of radicality of substitutions.
Substitution data arranged by amino acids, by gene
families and by duplications are available in supplemental materials or by request.
Paralogs were identified as homologs present in the
same genome and substitutions were considered to have
been acquired by duplicated genes if their most parsimonious placement on the phylogeny is more terminal
than the placement of the duplication event. Conversely,
substitutions occurring in branches basal to the most
ancient surviving duplication in a clade were considered
to have occurred in a single-copy gene.

Methods
Algorithm, data provenance and phylogenetic analysis

Fluxes, asymmetries, radicality and substitutions rates

A new a phylogenetic analysis tool AcidMiner [20] is
used to convert raw data in the form of protein

Net relative gain (or loss) of amino acids through substitutions (flux) was characterized by the parameter D =

(C-R)/(C+R), where C is the number of times each
amino acids was created and R – the number of times
the same amino acid has been removed by substitutions
[3]. The parameter D was be calculated separately for
each amino acid pair, or for each amino acid as a marginal value. Change of amino acid polarity due to substitutions was calculated as mean difference between
source and destination amino acid polarities (Polarity
values taken from AAIndex, Ref. [29]). The absolute
value of this difference, |DPolarity|, was used as a measure of radicality of each amino acid substitution; an
alternative, inverse measure of radicality used was the
Exchangeability index [21].
Each gene family was characterized by a Ka/Ks value,
obtained in the following manner. Ka was estimated as
the ratio of the number of substitutions (in either the
whole tree, or separately for duplicated and unduplicated portions of the tree) to the number of amino acid
sites in the alignment. Ks was calculated as the sum of
branch lengths of the corresponding section of the tree
expressed as the frequency of synonymous substitutions
per 4-fold degenerative site [4].
Ontology and expression data and statistical analysis

Gene ontology and gene expression data were merged
with amino acid substitution data by D. melanogaster
genes FlyBase IDs [30]. Therefore, for all analyses involving molecular functions and gene expression level,
genes families lacking a D. melanogaster gene were
excluded. Conversely, families with duplicated D. melanogaster genes appeared in these types of analysis with
the number of times equal to the number of D. melanogaster paralogs they contained. Gene families were subdivided into the following molecular function categories
using FlyBase ontology data [30]: structural proteins,
enzymes, transcription factors, other DNA-binding proteins, RNA-binding proteins, ATP- and GTP-binding
proteins, receptors and signal transduction proteins,
transporters, proteins with other functions and proteins
with unknown function. Gene expression data were
obtained from FlyAtlas database [22].
