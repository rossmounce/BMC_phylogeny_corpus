IS element IS16 as a molecular screening tool to
identify hospital-associated strains of
Enterococcus faecium

Abstract
Background: Hospital strains of Enterococcus faecium could be characterized and typed by various molecular
methods (MLST, AFLP, MLVA) and allocated to a distinct clonal complex known as MLST CC17. However, these
techniques are laborious, time-consuming and cost-intensive. Our aim was to identify hospital E. faecium strains
and differentiate them from colonizing and animal variants by a simple, inexpensive and reliable PCR-based
screening assay. We describe here performance and predictive value of a single PCR detecting the insertion
element, IS16, to identify hospital E. faecium isolates within a collection of 260 strains of hospital, animal and
human commensal origins.
Methods: Specific primers were selected amplifying a 547-bp fragment of IS16. Presence of IS16 was determined
by PCR screenings among the 260 E. faecium isolates. Distribution of IS16 was compared with a prevalence of
commonly used markers for hospital strains, esp and hylEfm. All isolates were typed by MLST and partly by PFGE.
Location of IS16 was analysed by Southern hybridization of plasmid and chromosomal DNA.
Results: IS16 was exclusively distributed only among 155 invasive strains belonging to the clonal complex of
hospital-associated strains (“CC17”; 28 MLST types) and various vancomycin resistance genotypes (vanA/B/negative).
The five invasive IS16-negative strains did not belong to the clonal complex of hospital-associated strains (CC17).
IS16 was absent in all but three isolates from 100 livestock, food-associated and human commensal strains (“nonCC17”; 64 MLST types). The three IS16-positive human commensal isolates revealed MLST types belonging to the
clonal complex of hospital-associated strains (CC17). The values predicting a hospital-associated strain (“CC17”)
deduced from presence and absence of IS16 was 100% and thus superior to screening for the presence of esp
(66%) and/or hylEfm (46%). Southern hybridizations revealed chromosomal as well as plasmid localization of IS16.
Conclusions: This simple screening assay for insertion element IS16 is capable of differentiating hospital-associated
from human commensal, livestock- and food-associated E. faecium strains and thus allows predicting the epidemic
strengths or supposed pathogenic potential of a given E. faecium isolate identified within the nosocomial setting.

Background
Vancomycin- and multi-resistant Enterococcus strains,
especially strains of E. faecium, raise major concerns in
intensive care medicine due to limited treatment options
[1]. E. faecium is ecologically widely distributed and
expected to play a central role as a reservoir and “turntable” for antibiotic resistance determinants in the bacterial world, and especially among Gram-positive

bacteria [2]. A number of molecular typing and characterization techniques such as AFLP, MLVA and MLST
and comparative genomic hybridizations allowed differentiating strains of E. faecium and allocating them into
various clonal complexes as based on core as well as
accessory genome content [3,4]. Isolates belonging to
hospital-associated clonal types (for instance, MLST
CC17) could be identified and a supposed enhanced
spreading potential among the nosocomial setting for
isolates of this specific subgroup is predictable [4].

[5,6]. When investigated in greater detail, the increase
was due to increasing numbers of hospital-associated
clonal types of E. faecium (MLST CC17) whereas numbers of other clonal types remained constant over time
again emphasizing the aforementioned increased potential for nosocomial spread [5]. The molecular techniques
to identify hospital-associated E. faecium strains are
laborious, time-consuming and cost-intensive and are
thus not applicable for routine diagnostics. Results of
recent bacterial, epidemiological, microarray-based and
genomic studies suggest that a number of markers are
enriched among hospital strains of E. faecium including
collagen adhesion factors acm and scm [7,8], other
matrix-binding proteins and pili [9,10], a supposed hyaluronidase, hyl Efm [11,12], biofilm-associated markers
including the enterococcal surface protein gene, esp
[13,14], and various genomic islands encoding proteins
of unknown functions [15,16]. Having acquired a number of these aforementioned determinants, these strains
may have an increased pathogenic potential [4,10,17].
However, distribution of these markers among hospital
strains is not exclusive and thus the predictive value is
limited in terms of specificity and sensitivity. Certain
markers possess pseudogenes and partly deleted variants
complicating establishing a simple PCR based screening
test [8,17]. Acquired ampicillin resistance appeared as a
phenotypic trait of hospital strains, at least in Europe;
however, this feature is also prevalent among non-hospital strains in some parts of the world, such as Asia and
North America [18-20]. Microarray based genomic comparisons revealed a specific mobile element, insertion
element IS16, exclusively prevalent among hospital
E. faecium strains from an international collection of
isolates [3]. In the present study, we established a PCRbased IS16 screening test and evaluated its robustness,
sensitivity, specificity and predictive value for 260 precharacterized isolates of E. faecium from different
human and animal sources. IS16 was localized in a subset of E. faecium isolates (n = 45) representing 29
MLST types by Southern hybridization. Available E. faecium genome data were examined for the presence of
IS16 homologous sequences and a genetic association of
IS16 with genomic markers is discussed.

Methods
Strain collection

Our laboratory serves as a Focal Laboratory for Enterococci in Germany. In general, enterococcal isolates sent
to us are pre-selected for being vancomycin- and multiresistant or with the suspicion of clonal spread (local,
regional, and country-wide outbreak analysis). Our collection of E. faecium test strains included 160 invasive
isolates (blood cultures) from 60 different German diagnostic or hospital laboratories isolated between 1995

Page 2 of 8

and 2007. Blood culture strains were pre-selected by
geography and hospital origin, year of isolation, and different van genotypes (van-/A/B). The blood culture isolates were compared against 68 human commensal
(outpatient) isolates from four different prevalence studies performed in different parts of Germany (1996,
1997, 1999, 2003) [24,25] and 32 isolates from animal
(chicken, pigs) and meat samples (broiler, pork) (1994,
1995, 1999) [21-23]. In all cases duplicate isolates were
excluded based on clinical/epidemiological data
(same patient/hospital or animal sample/flock) and of
molecular typing results (for instance, based on SmaImacrorestriction using PFGE for human commensal isolates [24,25]; unpublished results). Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by microbouillon dilution in MH
bouillon. Ampicillin resistance is defined by an MIC of
>8 mg/L and vancomycin resistance by >4 mg/L (http://
www.eucast.org). Summarized data are presented in
Table 1 and detailed information is given in Additional
files 1, 2, 3. Ethical approval was not needed for this
study; all strains were pre-selected and were received
anonymously from German microbiological or hospital
laboratories.
DNA isolation

Genomic DNA was prepared using a DNA extraction kit
(DNeasy Tissue Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An initial cell
wall lysis step was added dissolving the cell pellet in
TES buffer [10 mM Tris, 0.5 mM ethylene diamine
tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), 10% sucrose (pH 8.0)] plus
10 mg/mL lysozyme (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) followed by incubation at 37°C for 30
min. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a common phenol/chloroform-based alkaline lysis strategy [26].
PCR

PCR was performed with illustra™ PuRe Taq Ready-ToGo™ PCR Beads (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 0.5 μL of isolated genomic DNA (ca. 10 ng) and
primers (200 nM each) were added. Amplification of
fragments representing the esp, hyl Efm and vanA/B
genes was performed in a multiplex PCR as described
elsewhere [27]. The following strains and plasmids were
used as positive control samples: plasmid pRUM (IS16),
plasmid pLG1 (hyl Efm ); plasmid pIP816 (vanA;
E. faecium BM4147), E. faecium U0317 (esp), and E. faecalis V583 (vanB). E. faecalis OG1RF served as a negative control sample for all PCR assays. PCR primers and
conditions for screening IS16 elements were as follows:
IS16-F: 5’-CATGTTCCACGAACCAGAG and IS16-R:
5’-TCAAAAAGTGGGCTTGGC, annealing temperature
was 53°C, the predicted size of the product was 547 bp

Acelrys DS Gene 1.5.
PFGE typing

Genomic DNA for PFGE analysis was isolated and treated as described recently [27]. The agarose gel concentration was 1%, the CHEF-DR III apparatus (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for PFGE.
The ramped pulsed times were as follows: 1 - 11 sec for
15 h and 11 - 30 sec for 14 h at 14°C. SmaI-digested
Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325 was used as a molecular mass standard on all PFGE gels. Chromosomal
DNA of E. faecium strains was digested with I-Ceu-I for
16 h at 37°C. Plasmids were linearized by S1 nuclease
(TaKaRa, Germany) treatment for 15 min (37°C) and
subsequent resolution of the linearized plasmid DNA in
PFGE. The ramped pulsed times for I-Ceu-I gels were
5 - 30 sec for 22 h and for S1 PFGE 5 - 35 sec for 22 h
at 14°C [28].
Southern hybridizations

Southern hybridization experiments were done as
described elsewhere using a PCR-generated digoxigeninlabelled IS16 probe (DIG High Prime; Roche Applied
Science, D), hybridization chemicals and equipment
from commercial kits and according to recommendations of the manufacturer (Roche, Germany). Immunological detection was done as recommended using a
chemiluminescent probe (CDP-Star™, Roche, D) and
several readouts were taken at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min
in a chemi-imager from Bio-Rad (Chemidoc XRS, BioRad Labs., Hercules, US).
MLST and DNA sequencing

PCRs amplifying the seven loci used for MLST were
done according to the reference (http://efaecium.mlst.
net/). Sequencing reactions were performed according

to the manufacturer’s recommendations for cycle
sequencing of PCR products (Applied Biosystems,
Germany). Sequence files were read, evaluated, aligned
and compared to the reference set of alleles using
sequencing software Lasergene 8.0 from DNA-STAR
(SeqMan 8.0; EditSeq 8.0), TraceEditPro v. 1.1.1 from
Ridom (http://www.ridom.de), and via the official MLST
webpage (http://efaecium.mlst.net/). Phylogenetic trees
were generated using software programmes eBURST
[29] for the set of determined MLST types and global
optimised eBURST [30] for the entire set of all available
524 MLST types (http://efaecium.mlst.net/).
Statistics

Statistical analyses were performed with software package EpiCompare 1.0 (Ridom).

Results
Identification of IS16 primer sequences

Based on available sequences (pRUM [31] or composite
(vanB) transposons [32]) we established PCR primers
for an IS16-specific internal fragment (547 bp). Specificity and sensitivity was evaluated against available bacterial databases (BlastN, GenBank). The PCR was
established using DNA from reference samples known
to be positive for IS16 (plasmid pRUM) and from negative control samples known to lack IS16 (E. faecalis
OG1RF). PCR results were as expected and amplified
products from reference samples were sequenced for
confirming specificity of the amplified PCR product (not
shown).
Screening for markers in the two sets of strains

Genomic DNA was screened by PCR using the established PCR primers for IS16, esp and hylEfm. IS16 was
highly prevalent among invasive E. faecium (n = 155/
160; Table 1) and mainly absent (n = 3/100) from
human commensal or animal and meat sources.

Werner et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/80

The three IS16-positive commensal isolates were from
humans. Other markers supposedly enriched among
clinical or hospital-associated E. faecium isolates were
also assessed: the esp gene was prevalent among 64% of
all blood culture isolates and 46% of all invasive isolates
were hyl Efm -positive (Table 1). None of the 100 nonclinical strains possessed esp or hylEfm. Ampicillin resistance was prevalent among almost all clinical strains
(98%). Two human commensal and two animal isolates
were also ampicillin-resistant.
MLST typing

All 260 E. faecium isolates were MLST typed. Discriminatory power among clinical isolates (n = 160 isolates;
32 MLST types DI = 0.889 95% CI [0.864 - 0.913]) was
much less than among human and animal commensal
isolates (n = 100 isolates, 64 MLST types; DI = 0.988;
95% CI [0.983 - 0.994]). This suggests that prevalent
hospital-associated clonal types differ less than their
colonizing counterparts in animals and humans. In fact,
126 of the 160 invasive E. faecium isolates belonged to
only eight MLST types known to represent major

Page 4 of 8

hospital-associated clonal types (ST16, ST17, ST18,
ST78, ST117, ST192, ST202, ST203) whereas the other
24 MLST types occurred only occasionally. Based on
their MLST types and subsequent eBURST and goeBURST analyses, isolates could be sorted into different
clonal complexes which were in agreement with their
corresponding ecological background (compare also to
[4]). Figure 1 shows eBURST trees generated with all
MLST types determined in this study. A phylogenetic
tree of all currently detached MLST types (n = 524;
21.04.2010; http://efaecium.mlst.net/) using goeBURST
is shown as Additional File 4. Based on these two calculations, almost all (n = 155/160) invasive isolates
belonged to the clonal complex of hospital-associated
strains (CC17 + ST65 [singleton]). The five IS16-negative clinical isolates represent colonizing strain types not
associated with clonal types of hospital strains ("nonCC17"; ST9 [n = 2], ST104; ST271; ST374). The majority of commensal isolates represented many individual
MLST types but belonging to the major clonal complexes of animal and human colonizing strain types

(CC5, CC22/36, CC1). The three IS16-positive commensal E. faecium isolates revealed MLST types (ST18,
ST413) belonging to the clonal complex of hospitalassociated strains (CC17).

Southern hybridizations of IS16 probes

The localization of IS16 among 45 representative
E. faecium isolates from various origins and altogether
29 different MLST types was investigated. I-Ceu-I
digested chromosomal DNA resolved in PFGE and plasmid DNA analysed inS1 PFGE and common agarose
gels were transferred onto nylon membranes and hybridized against a labelled IS16 probe. Results are shown in
Table 2. If available, several representatives of identical
MLST types differing in their van gene content were
considered for analysis (see for instance ST17 vanA/B/negative isolates). In general, the IS16 probe hybridized
to (up to three) chromosomal bands suggesting several
copies of the same element present in the genome
(a single hybridizing chromosomal band could still result
from several IS16 copies on it). Four isolates (ST17,
ST81, ST202, ST275) showed IS16 only hybridizing to
plasmid bands. Twenty-two strains (n = 22/45) revealed
a signal for both chromosomal as well as plasmid bands.
Hybridization patterns were independent of the van
gene content (Table 2).
Several E. faecium genomes are available as genomic
fragments for preliminary analysis (collection I: seven E.
faecium genomes; [33]; collection II: eleven E. faecium
isolates from the Human Microbiome Project; (http://
nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov//genomes/geblast.cgi?gi=6511#SearchSet). A BLAST
search for IS16-related sequences in both E. faecium
collections revealed several hits. However, as far as
some detailed information was available, the neighbouring DNA fragments all showed different genetic links.
IS16 was prevalent among four out of seven genomes in
collection I [33]. IS16 was linked to (a) several putative
fragments of a conjugative transposon (strain E1162,
ST17), (b) ORF involved in sugar metabolism (strain
E1636; ST106), (c) a genomic fragment containing other
transposases of the IS256 family (strain U0317, ST78)
and (d) the supposed pathogenicity island containing
the esp gene (strain E1679, ST104). None of the other
two strains also containing the esp PAI possessed IS16
within its structure. In the deposited genomic fragments
from the Human Microbiome Project, IS16 was infrequently identified, for instance, in E. faecium 1,230,933
linked to a metal-dependent hydrolase or in E. faecium
TC6 linked to an extracellular solute-binding protein,
family 1. In E. faecium DO a 5’ link to a C4-dicarboxylate anaerobic carrier gene and a 3’ link to a

chloramphenicol actetyltransferase resistance gene followed by a replicase and relaxase genes indicated a supposed plasmid origin of this contig (not shown in
details). Available sequence data allow extracting the
MLST type related allele information out of the
sequenced genomes and a corresponding analysis was
done on the seven (collection I) and eleven (collection
II) accessible genomes. Of the 11 isolates positive for
IS16 eight strains possessed hospital-associated MLST
types (ST16, ST17, ST18, ST78, ST203, ST-NEW) and
three did not belong to clonal complexes of hospitalassociated types (ST25, ST104, ST114). Intriguingly, of
the latter three, one was a clinical isolate also positive
for esp, a marker commonly associated only with hospital-associated strains.
Epidemiological analysis of clinical strains

We introduced PCR-based screening for IS16 for all
E. faecium isolates sent to our Focal Laboratory for
Enterocooci in Germany in late 2007. In 2008 we
received 314 E. faecium isolates (from >57 hospitals
located in 13 of the 16 German federal states; all VRE)
and in 2009 334 E. faecium isolates (from >49 hospitals
located in 11 German federal states, 90% VRE) from
clinical sources for further analyses. Altogether 99.4%
(n = 312/314) in 2008 and 97.3% (n = 325/334) in 2009
were IS16-positive demonstrating wide prevalence of
multi-resistant (VRE), hospital-associated strain types in
hospitals in Germany.

Discussion
Early recognition of epidemic E. faecium strains is critical
for a timely introduction of strategies to prevent and control their further spread. Hospital-associated clonal types
of E. faecium often disseminate unrecognized among the
nosocomial setting before and until first VRE cases suddenly appear [5,6]. But standardised methods for rapid
diagnostics of these hospital-associated E. faecium strains
are missing and modern, DNA sequence-based typing
techniques are laborious, time-consuming and comparably expensive. Acquired ampicillin resistance [5,6,34]
and high-level ciprofloxacin resistance [35,36] appear as
phenotypic traits of hospital-associated strains. However,
ampicillin resistance in animal or commensal enterococci
is also prevalent to a certain extent [37], at least in many
North American and Asian countries [38] and the predictive value of acquired ciprofloxacin resistance is limited
since it accumulates over time and differently in various
clonal types of hospital strains [36]. Several genetic markers, such as esp, hylEfm or the purK1 allele (used as part
of the MLST scheme) are not ubiquitous traits of all hospital-associated E. faecium strains and failure to detect
them does not reliably indicate a strain with a limited
spreading or pathogenic potential [27,34,36,39-41]. It was

Page 6 of 8

also shown recently that hyl Efm is plasmid-located
[11,42], transferable in vitro into several non-hospital E.
faecium strains and thus cannot be suggested to serve as
a specific marker to predict a clonal background of a
given strain [43]. A reliable and rapid molecular test to
differentiate commensal from hospital-acquired strains is
desirable; results from comparative genomic hybridizations and genome sequencing projects show promising
candidate markers including the described insertion element IS16 [3].
According to our data, IS16 is highly specific for predicting hospital-associated strain types (Table 1; Additional
files 1, 2, 3). Altogether 155 of the 160 blood culture isolates from 1995 to 2007 from >50 contributing laboratories or hospitals and representing 28 MLST types were
all IS16 positive. The comparably high number of (a) participating hospitals/laboratories contributing strains, (b)
blood culture strains representing many different MLST
types and different van genotypes, and (c) isolated from
over 13 years compensates for a geographical limitation of
a strain collection that only included isolates from Germany. The presence of IS16 was independent of resistance
gene clusters known to possess this element; only 19 isolates were vanB-positive (12%) and the remaining isolates
were vancomycin susceptible (n = 67; 42%) or of the
vanA-type (n = 74; 46%). Since it is known from previous
plasmid analysis that IS16 could be associated with specific
plasmid types (e.g., pRUM), we identified the location of
IS16 in a representative set of E. faecium isolates (vanA/
B/-negative; 29 MLST types; Table 2). Southern hybridizations revealed chromosomal, plasmid and both localizations for IS16 suggesting a somehow restricted mobile
gene pool within hospital-associated clonal types. All but
three investigated human commensal and all animal
strains possessed MLST types different from hospital-associated strains; all but the three aforementioned strains
were IS16 negative. The three human commensal isolates
possessing IS16 revealed MLST types ST18 and ST413,
allocating them to hospital-associated strains and again
emphasising the excellent predictive value of this element
for identifiying hospital-associated strain types. PCRs for
esp and hylEfm were negative for these three strains and
one was ampicillin-resistant. Absence of IS16 among nonclinical E. faecium strains also suggests a very limited host
range of IS16-bearing plasmids (e.g., pRUM-like) only
among hospital-associated strains. Prevalence of hospitalassociated E. faecium isolates among the general human
population is low and more detailed information was only
available in one of the three cases. This outpatient from a
community surveillance study received beta-lactam treatment during the time of sampling which could be the reason for identifying an ampicillin- and multiresistant,
epidemic strain here (association with a hospital stay was
not documented).

An epidemiological analysis of 648 E. faecium clinical
isolates sent to our Focal Laboratory for Enterococci in
2008/2009 from German hospital patients revealed that
98% (n = 637) were IS16-positive, demonstrating countrywide prevalence of hospital-associated strain types among
German hospitals in recent years. This finding was supported by wide prevalence of acquired high-level ciprofloxacin resistance among the same strain collection serving as
an additional marker for hospital-associated strains [36].
Admittedly, most of the strains from 2008/2009 were vancomycin-resistant showing in retrospect that hospitalassociated strains of E. faecium and not commensal strain
types accumulated in the nosocomial setting and acquired
vanA- or vanB-type resistance determinants.
The observation that an IS element, IS16, is among
the most specific markers to define hospital-associated
strains [3] appears curious regarding the promiscuous
nature of these elements to transpose between several
genomic backgrounds within a cell and the possible horizontal mobilization in cis or trans by activation via conjugative elements and subsequent transfer into new
hosts. It has been argued that acquisition of specific elements, especially IS16, has contributed to the ecological
success of hospital-associated E. faecium strains allowing
higher levels of genetic variability including easier acquisition of mobile genetic elements that may support lifestyle in new or changing environments or ecological
niches like the hospital environment [3,44].

Conclusions
Our data show that an IS16-based screening assay
appears as the best molecular screening tool to differentiate colonizing E. faecium isolates from hospital-associated E. faecium strains that show an enhanced
spreading potential in the nosocomial setting. The predictive value of an IS16 result is superior to the predictive strengths of established tests targeting molecular
markers like esp or hyl Efm or phenotypic traits like
acquired ampicillin or high-level ciprofloxacin resistance. Progress in comparative genome-based analysis
will most probably reveal additional markers to identify
hospital associated E. faecium isolates with an enhanced
spreading potential in the nosocomial setting [15,33].

Only the major, superior complex without singletons and smaller
complexes is shown. A number of singletons from Figure 1 belong to
clonal complexes such as ST19 which is part of the large cluster and
related to CC17. Other complexes separated in Figure 1 (CC32, CC29) are
linked here to form a main, superior cluster. ST65 remains a singleton
and is the only IS16-positive ST not phylogenetically linked to the clonal
complex of hospital-associated strains (CC17).
