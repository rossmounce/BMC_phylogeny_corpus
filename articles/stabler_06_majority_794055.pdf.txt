Abstract
A response to Snyder LA, Saunders NJ: The majority of genes in the pathogenic Neisseria
species are present in non-pathogenic Neisseria lactamica, including those designated
as virulence genes. BMC Genomics 2006, 7:128.

Background
The publication of a microarray analysis of selected Neisseria lactamica strains by Snyder and Saunders [1] has
raised some interesting questions regarding the distribution of genes between pathogenic Neisseria species and the
non-pathogenic N. lactamica, especially with regard to
previously reported "virulence genes." This paper has also
highlighted the difficulties in comparing microarray data
from complementary yet distinct investigations and
places particular emphasis on discrepancies with one of
our own publications [2]. This comparison has raised general issues for discussion and a number of points for clarification that form the basis of this response.
Initially, the two papers may appear to take similar microarray-based approaches to address the general subject of
specific gene distribution between pathogenic and nonpathogenic Neisseria species. Indeed, there are a number
of similarities in the practical methods used, as would be
expected for any microarray-based analysis, which makes
the reported discrepancies all the more surprising. However, there are also a number of important distinctions to
be made between the two studies, primarily based on

experimental design and data analysis, which we believe
greatly influence the interpretation of the results.

Experimental design
Snyder and Saunders determined gene presence in a collection of 13 N. lactamica strains, with a particular focus
on genes previously described as virulence genes, and also
reported the presence of a subset of genes in a range of
commensal Neisseria species. The microarray analysis was
performed using a pan-Neisseria microarray with standard
labelling and hybridisation protocols. Each N. lactamica
strain was directly compared to two other strains in a loop
design that incorporated a dye-swap although data was
analysed in a channel-independent intensity-based manner.
Stabler et al. determined gene presence or absence in a collection of 38 Neisseria strains, including both pathogenic
species and non-pathogenic commensal species, to establish the phylogenetic relationship of strains that showed
favourable correlation to other typing methods. Genes
present in all 18 N. meningitidis serotype B strains or
present in 7 commensal strains were identified to comPage 1 of 3

pare the distribution of these genes in pathogenic and
non-pathogenic strains. It is important to note that this
differs to the goal of this study suggested by Snyder and
Saunders. The microarray analysis was performed using a
pan-Neisseria microarray with standard labelling and
hybridisation protocols. Each Neisseria strain was directly
compared to N. meningitidis MC58 in a common reference
design and data was analysed in a channel-associated
ratio-based manner.
In terms of the microarray platforms used, there are insufficient differences to explain the reported discrepancies.
Clearly, the microarrays utilised by the two studies were of
independent design and construction so the gene representation, reporter element sequences and PCR product
amplicons will differ. However, given the rigorous
approaches to design and construction of both arrays,
these important but subtle differences are unlikely to
account for the level of discordance reported. Even the
strikingly similar hybridisation and washing conditions
should produce a comparable level of stringency, which
would be one obvious methodological reason for such
widespread disagreement in the presence/absence calling
of genes.
The major difference in the experimental design of the
two studies comes from the comparisons made in each
study and how these comparisons were executed. By their
very nature, microarray comparative genomics studies are
always limited by the gene content represented on the
arrays and by the number and representation of strains
analysed. In both cases, the arrays were essentially limited
in content to the sequenced pathogenic Neisseria and
therefore any novel genes present only in N. lactamica or
other commensal species were not surveyed. Likewise, the
strains selected in each study were considered by the
authors to be representative and suitable for the intended
investigation. It is evident that the analysis of additional
strains may affect conclusions; Snyder and Saunders
noted this with the inclusion of another N. lactamica
strain that was not part of their initial MLST set and
accounted for 72% of the strain specific genes they
reported. However, the distinct selection of strains for the
two studies still fails to fully explain the scale of discrepancies reported by Snyder and Saunders. One point to
note would be that no pathogenic strains were included in
the comparison by Snyder and Saunders whereas Stabler
et al. compared all strains directly to a pathogen, namely
the N. meningitidis MC58 common reference. This is
important to note with regard to the execution of the comparisons for the data analysis approaches discussed in the
following section.

Data analysis
When considering the above points, in balance with other
reasonable explanations, it would appear that data analysis and subsequent interpretation represents the key area
in which the two groups adopted fundamentally different
approaches that may help to explain the discrepancies
observed. Snyder and Saunders employed an intensitybased method that analysed the two channels of a twocolour microarray independently whereas Stabler et al.
used a ratio-based method that analysed the two channels
of a two-colour microarray in combination.
Snyder and Saunders used a metric (pON) that reflects the
probability of there being a hybridisation signal for each
spot in each channel independently. Whilst this seems a
reasonable approach it takes no account of any relative
intensity levels; a gene may be called present in two strains
if the pON threshold is exceeded in both yet the relative
intensity level may be significantly higher in one strain
than the other. For example, for a pathogen gene that was
highly divergent in N. lactamica there may still be a low
but sufficient signal intensity above background to call
the gene as present in N. lactamica using the pON metric,
yet this level of hybridisation would be insignificant when
compared to the signal intensity achieved with a pathogen; therefore a more accurate call for this gene should be
absent or highly divergent rather than present. This also
raises the issue that the PMT gain settings during scanning
may have an impact on the number of genes passing the
pON threshold and thus being assigned as present. If this
were true then a normalisation strategy would need to be
employed to account for this to ensure the definition of
presence is consistent across different arrays and strains
and is not dependent on scanning. Furthermore, the comparison of absolute intensities for different genes can be
affected by factors such as the concentration, length, and
Tm of reporter elements. The authors have essentially
adopted a one-colour approach to the analysis of two-colour data, although generally some form of normalisation
and an attempt to address the issue of relative intensity
would be included. However, in their study relative intensities would not have been informative as no pathogens
were included in the comparison.
Stabler et al. approached data analysis in a more common
approach for two-colour data by first removing unreliable
low intensity data based on image analysis QC flags, normalisation of ratio data to remove any systematic effects
and applying ratio cutoffs to determine genes present or
absent in comparison to the control strain hybridised to
each array as a common reference. The GACK software
used to set dynamic ratio cutoffs and make the 'present',
'divergent' or 'absent/highly divergent' calls was set at its
most conservative, classified as 'present' if the estimated
probability of presence (EPP) = 100% and 'absent/highly

divergent' if EPP = 0% with 'divergent' genes between
these two extremes. Snyder and Saunders wrongly indicate that the calls of absence by Stabler et al. were based
purely on a lack of hybridisation; if this were the case then
we would agree with the other possible technical reasons
for this that they describe in detail. In actual fact, the calls
of absence by Stabler et al. are based on the ratio of intensities for the test strain channel and the common reference
strain control channel. Therefore, the call of absence
depends on direct comparison to the positive signal intensity for the same spot which serves as an internal control.
This presents one of the great strengths of two-colour
analysis that helps to circumvent the highlighted problems of missing or poorly performing reporter elements as
the same reporter is being used in each channel of the
comparison.
These fundamental differences in data analysis present the
most likely source of discrepancies between the two studies as all subsequent interpretations are based on the issue
of gene presence in different strains. Snyder and Saunders
were likely to overestimate gene presence and unable to
discriminate conserved genes from highly divergent genes
as relative intensities are not taken into account nor any
direct comparison to pathogens. In contrast, Stabler et al.
are likely to underestimate gene presence due to the perhaps overly strict criteria applied to gene selection, that is,
the need for a 100% certainty of gene presence in every
strain within a group, that would exclude any gene just
missing these thresholds in a single strain. Given these
two likely extremes it is not surprising that so many discrepancies were reported.

Data interpretation
The final interpretation of data is clearly dependent on the
methods used to determine gene presence as outlined
above. Many of the discrepancies reported by Snyder and
Saunders were related to comparison with the microarray
data of Stabler et al. but also extended to other studies
identifying "virulence genes" or pathogen-specific genes.
Whilst we want to avoid an extended reanalysis and interrogation of both datasets, Snyder and Saunders make critical misrepresentations of Stabler et al. data that need to
be addressed in more general terms.

confirmed gene absence, there is less agreement on a significant number of genes that will most likely differ in the
degree of sequence divergence and thus relate to the methods used to determine gene presence. Confidence in our
own data comes from the fact that the relative intensities
of these genes are in the order of 500 times lower in the
commensals than the pathogens when compared to the
common reference, suggesting these genes are highly
divergent and thus likely to encode functionally distinct
proteins.
Table 3 in Stabler et al. is also discussed in relation to the
pathogen-specific genes reported by Snyder and Saunders
in Table 3 as 5/6 genes were not reported by Stabler et al.
However, it is incorrect and misleading to conclude that
lack of genes in this list equates to presence in commensals as suggested. The reason for these genes not appearing
in Stabler et al. Table 3 was due to them not meeting the
strict criteria for inclusion rather than indicating presence
in commensals. The data for these genes also demonstrates excellent differential distribution between pathogens and commensals and so is in agreement with the
findings of Snyder and Saunders. This does highlight that
perhaps the analysis stringency of Stabler et al. should be
reduced to ensure that potential genes are not missed
although this would increase the risk of more false positives.

Summary
This response has hopefully highlighted some of the
issues that influence the interpretation of microarray data
from different groups. To a non-specialist reader this may
seem bewildering but it is important to appreciate that the
application of apparently similar experimental
approaches can lead to very different conclusions and the
need to understand the basis of this.

false positives. Whilst there is agreement with Snyder and
