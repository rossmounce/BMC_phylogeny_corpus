Abstract
The ability to adhere to host surfaces is by far the most vital step in the successful colonization by
microbial pathogens. Colonization begins with the attachment of the bacterium to receptors
expressed by cells forming the lining of the mucosa. Long hair like extracellular appendages called
fimbriae, produced by most Gram-negative pathogens, mediate specific attachment to the epithelial
cell surface. Associated with the fimbriae is a protein called an adhesin, which directs high-affinity
binding to specific cell surface components. In the last couple of years, an enormous amount of
research has been undertaken that deals with understanding how bacterial pathogens adhere to
host cells. E. coli in all probability is one of the best studied free-living organisms. A group of E. coli
called Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) including both human and animal pathogens like
Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), Newborn meningitic E. coli (NMEC) and Avian pathogenic E. coli
(APEC), have been found to harbour many fimbriae including Type 1 fimbriae, P fimbriae, curli
fibres, S fimbriae, F1C fimbriae, Dr fimbriae, afimbrial adhesins, temperature-sensitive
haemagglutinin and many novel adhesin gene clusters that have not yet been characterized. Each of
these adhesins is unique due to the recognition of an adhesin-specific receptor, though as a group
these adhesins share common genomic organization. A newly identified putative adhesin
temporarily termed ExPEC Adhesin I, encoded by gene yqi, has been recently found to play a
significant role in the pathogenesis of APEC infection, thus making it an interesting candidate for
future research. The aim of this review is to describe the role of ExPEC adhesins during
extraintestinal infections known till date, and to suggest the idea of investigating their potential role
in the colonization of the host gut which is said to be a reservoir for ExPEC.

Review
Many bacteria have surface appendages of various sizes
and appearances called pili and fimbriae. These terms
have been used interchangeably. The term "pilus" (plural
pili), however, should be reserved for appendages
involved in bacterial conjugation, that is the transfer of
genetic material, and the term "fimbria" (plural fimbriae)
should be reserved for structures concerned with the adhesion of bacteria to various surfaces, including cell surfaces

[1]. On average, one to ten conjugative pili and up to
more than 400 fimbriae may be present on the surface of
a bacterial cell. Conjugative pili are longer than fimbriae
and are composed mainly of a pilin protein organized
into a tube-like structure, which allows the passage of
genetic material during conjugation [1]. Fimbriae have a
similar structure but, because they are involved in cellular
adhesion, the presence of strain-specific protein sub-units
confers a variety of agglutination properties [1].

Pathogenic E. coli are the increasing cause of a number of
extraintestinal infections, apart from the classical intestinal infections they bring about in humans and animals.
Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), as these pathotypes have now been classified, are responsible for a
diverse spectrum of invasive human and animal infections, often leading to septicaemia [2]. Molecular epidemiological analyses have led to the acceptance of ExPEC
being distinct from other E. coli, as pathogenically versatile, thus reflecting the shared ability of the various ExPEC
subsets to overcome or subvert host defences and cause
disease at multiple anatomical sites in humans and animals [3]. Unlike non-pathogenic commensal and intestinal pathogenic E. coli, ExPEC derive predominantly from
E. coli phylogenetic group B2, and to a lesser extent from
group D [4].
ExPEC, which include Uropathogenic (UPEC), Newborn
meningitic (NMEC), Septicaemia associated (SePEC) and
Avian pathogenic (APEC) E. coli, exhibit considerable
genome diversity and possess a broad range of virulenceassociated factors including adhesins, toxins, iron acquisition factors, lipopolysaccharides, polysaccharide capsules
and invasins [5]. Some of the well known adhesins
present among ExPEC strains are Type 1 fimbriae (fim), P
fimbriae or the pilus associated with pyelonephritis (pap),
curli fibres (csg), S fimbriae or the sialic acid-specific fimbriae (sfa), F1C fimbriae (foc), Dr fimbriae (dra), afimbrial
adhesins (afa), temperature-sensitive haemagglutinin
(tsh) and novel adhesin gene clusters many of which

remain to be characterized [5-7]. A brief overview of the
ExPEC adhesins is given in table 1.
Interestingly most of the ExPEC adhesins have only been
studied with respect to their role in the respiratory tract
and urogenital tract of the host pertaining to the extraintestinal infections these pathogens are known to cause.
However, several studies hint about the probability of the
intestine as a reservoir of ExPEC which suggests that the
host could be infected with ExPEC that originate from its
own intestinal tract [8-11]. Despite these studies, the role
of ExPEC adhesins in the intestinal tract has not yet fully
been studied. It is quite possible that these adhesins could
in fact play a similar role in the intestinal tract as they do
in the respiratory or urogenital tract during ExPEC infection. Therefore we could hypothesize, that if the ExPEC
adhesins play a significant role in the adhesion of ExPEC
to the intestinal tract, it would increase the chances of
ExPEC colonization in the gut of the host, thereby increasing the possibility of an extraintestinal infection under
suitable conditions.
Type 1 Fimbriae
Type 1 fimbrial structures were first noted in early electron
microscopic investigations as non-flagellar, filamentous
appendages of bacteria. They were first designated "fimbriae" by Duguid in 1955 [12] and termed "pilus" by Brinton almost 10 years later [13]. Since then "pilus" has
become a generic term used to describe all types of nonflagellar filamentous appendages and is often used inter-

changeably with the term "fimbriae". The fimbriae were
also classified into types I-V [13] depending on agglutination and binding activity.
Fimbriae were thought to confer the ability to agglutinate
erythrocytes and to attach to other cells of varying origin,
while several other studies indicated a relation between
adhesion and virulence for bacteria inducing infection in
relation to a mucous surface [14]. It was also further demonstrated that there was specific binding of one E. coli
strain to monkey kidney cells, mediated by purified type
1 pili. Moreover, a significant correlation was found
between the presence of pili or fimbriae on E. coli and the
ability of the bacteria to adhere to human urinary tract
epithelial cells [14].
Type 1 fimbriae were initially associated with adhesive
and pellicle-promoting activities which are inhibited by
D-Mannose, that is, they are mannose sensitive [15]. They
were described as polymers of pilin subunits that consisted mainly of protein with a high content of hydrophobic amino acids [16]. A single fimbria consists of
approximately 100 identical protein subunits [17]. A consensus started developing in the 80's that adhesion is
important as a virulence factor in the establishment of
infection and that attributes of both the host and the
micro-organisms are important in this process [18]. Further research showed that piliated strains of uropathogenic E. coli adhered to the polyethylene surface and
formed small micro-colonies surrounded by small
amounts of glycocalyx, whereas the non-piliated strains
adhered only poorly and produced very little extracellular
material [18].
The role of type 1 fimbriae and its effect on pathogenicity
of APEC infections was first described in 1984, where an
observation was made that the presence of adherence pili
on the infecting bacteria affected both the number of
chicks that developed disease as well as the severity of disease [19].
Over the years these fimbriae have been studied in depth,
considering that these organelles provide an ideal model
for the study of microbial adherence as stated by Orndorff
and Falkow in 1984 [20]. In E. coli, 50 - 70% of all strains
possess the chromosomally determined type 1 fimbriae
[17]. Later studies revealed that four genes designated
fimA, B, C and D were involved in the synthesis of the fimbriae [21]. The expression of type 1 fimbriae is phase variable that is, the bacteria shift periodically between a
fimbriate and non-fimbriate state. It was found that the
two regulatory fim genes, fimB and fimE control the phase
variation of type 1 fimbriae in E. coli [22]. Marc et al.
sequenced gene fimI of the type 1 fimbrial gene cluster
completely and suggested that FimI could possibly consti-

tute a minor fimbrial subunit based on the tryptophan
residues in the amino acid composition which are not
normally found in the major fimbrial subunit [23]. Three
additional genes fimF, fimG and fimH were further characterized and shown not to be necessary for the production
of fimbriae but to be involved in the adhesive property
and longitudinal regulation of these structures [24]. The
receptor-binding adhesin of the type 1 fimbriae was identified, characterized and purified in 1988 and this protein
was found to be antigenically conserved among strains
with different pilin serotypes, and located at the pilus tip
[25,26]. FimH was later found to be the gene responsible
for the mannose-specific or receptor-specific adhesin of
the type 1 fimbriae [27] while fimC was found to be the
periplasmic chaperone that directs assembly of type 1 pili
[28]. Very recently studies involving molecular evolutionary dynamics have shown that there is evidence for strong
selection in the type 1 fimbrial adhesin fimH, a consequence of which resulted in increased binding of fimH to
monomannose-containing receptors previously shown to
be adaptive for Uropathogenic E. coli, and which also correlates with increased adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells
[29].
The type 1 fimbriae have thus been structurally and functionally characterized extensively over decades. There is
ample evidence that type 1 pili play a significant role as
mediators of attachment by E. coli infections, particularly
UPEC infections [14]. FimH being the receptor specific
adhesin, has been utilized as a vaccine candidate in previous studies involving urinary tract infection caused by
UPEC. One such study showed that immunization with
fimH reduced in vivo colonization of the bladder mucosa
by more than 99 percent in a murine cystitis model, and
immunoglobulin G to fimH was detected in urinary samples from protected mice. Furthermore, passive systemic
administration of immune sera to fimH also resulted in
reduced bladder colonization by UPEC [30]. The type 1
fimbriae best studied in E. coli, therefore, are of tremendous importance in the pathogenesis of Gram negative
bacteria.
P fimbriae
The P fimbriae are morphologically indistinguishable
from the type 1 fimbriae, however, they recognize and
bind to the α-D-Galp-(1-4)-β-D-Galp carbohydrate
sequence occurring in the series of P-blood group antigenspecific glycosphingolipids [31] and hence the name. The
genes encoding the P pilus type were termed the pap genes
or pyelonephritis-associated pili genes since these were
typical of strains isolated from human urinary tract infections [32]. PapA was described to be the structural gene for
the P fimbriae monomer [33], that is, these pili, which are
hair-like appendages consist of helically arranged subunits of the protein papA. The protein papG is the digalacto-

side-specific adhesin and through immuno-electron
microscopy it was found that the P pili are heteropolymers composed of the major pilin, papA, the minor pilins,
papE and papF, and the adhesin papG [34], the last three
proteins being located at the tip of the pilus. These findings were further confirmed by Lund et al [35], who
showed that the major subunit papA is not required for
binding, but papF and papG are essential for adhesion.
There are several different serotypes of P fimbriae, which
are said to differ in their serological differences due to
structural variation within the central domain of the
major pilus subunit [36]. P pilus biogenesis has been
studied extensively unravelling the function of each gene
of the pap gene cluster or operon [37]. A model of the
pilus biogenesis which involves 11 genes organized in the
pap gene cluster on the chromosome in clinical isolates
expressing P pili has also been previously described [38].
The PapD chaperone interacts with each pilus protein
subunit forming assembly competent complexes which
are targeted to the PapC outer membrane assembly protein required for P pilus biogenesis. PapA subunits pack
into a right-handed helical rod. PapH incorporation terminates polymerization of PapA and anchors the pilus to
the cell. PapE subunits form open helical fibres called tip
fibrillae.

lished, that these P pili adhesive organelles are critical virulence factors, that mediate the recognition of and
attachment to tissues of the kidney by the pathogen during UTI [43]. It has also been previously shown that P fimbriae utilize the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent
pathway to trigger mucosal inflammation [44].
The P fimbriae are not only restricted to Uropathogenic E.
coli (UPEC) causing UTI, but are also prevalent in Newborn meningitic E. coli (NMEC) and Avian pathogenic E.
coli (APEC) strains [5,45,46]. The importance of P fimbriae among APEC has gained a lot of interest over a
period of time. It has been previously observed that the
pap positive genotype was associated more frequently
with pathogenic isolates from septicaemic chickens than
from healthy chickens, suggesting its function during septicaemic infection [47]. The potential of P pili as a vaccine
candidate has also been studied and it has been observed
that vaccination with Gal-Gal pili or the P fimbrial vaccines prevented pyelonephritis by piliated E. coli in a
murine model as well as in monkeys [48,49].

The PapG adhesin, positioned at the distal end of the
fibrillum, mediates binding to the Galα (1-4) Gal receptor
determinant [38] or the globo series of glycolipids in the
human kidney. PapG recognition of the galabiose receptor is thought to be a prerequisite for pyelonephritis [39].

Curli Fibres
The name curli was proposed in 1989 to a third class of E.
coli surface organelles in addition to the flagella and fimbriae, which were found to be coiled surface structures
composed of a single type of subunit, the curlin, which
differs from all known pilin proteins and is synthesized in
the absence of a cleavable signal peptide [50]. Most natural isolates of E. coli carry a transcribable curli gene, crl,
however only certain strains are able to assemble the subunit protein into curli [50].

It has been reported that more than 80% of all pyelonephritogenic strains of E. coli express P fimbriae, which are
recognized as a key determinant in promoting the virulence of E. coli in urinary tract infection (UTI) [40]. Furthermore, P-fimbriated E. coli interact poorly with
neutrophils and resist their bactericidal actions in vitro. P
fimbriae are thought to play a role by means of their PapG
adhesin, which occurs in three molecular variants: PapGI,
PapGII and PapGIII [41]. Studies involving different animal models of ascending UTI have found a variable role
for P fimbriae, in particular PapGII-mediated adherence,
a variant of the PapG adhesin, in the colonization of the
mammalian kidney. Molecular epidemiological studies
have shown that allele III of PapG is usually the predominant variant among E. coli isolates from women and children with cystitis, while the PapGII variant is associated
with pyelonephritis and bacteremia in humans [8,10].
Overall it appears that there is a subtle role for P fimbriae
in mediating adherence to uroepithelial cells in vivo and
establishing a robust inflammatory response during renal
colonization, which in turn contributes to kidney damage
during acute pyelonephritis [8,42]. It is now fully estab-

Curli bind several matrix and plasma proteins such as
fibronectin, laminin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen
activator, and H-kininogen [51]. Curli fibres are encoded
on the csg (curlin subunit gene) gene cluster, comprised of
two differently transcribed operons, one which encodes
the csgB, csgA and csgC genes, and a second which encodes
csgD, csgE and csgG [52]. Curli in E. coli consist of polymers of a single 15-kDa protein encoded by the subunit
gene csgA and production of the curli fibres requires
expression of both operons [51]. Assembly of curli fibres
involves extracellular self-assembly of the subunit csgA,
dependent on a specific nucleator protein csgB. CsgD is a
transcriptional activator essential for expression of the
two curli fibre operons, while csgG is an outer membrane
lipoprotein involved in extracellular stabilization of csgA
and csgB [52]. The expression of genes coding for curli is
complex and involves several control elements, such as HNS, RpoS and OmpR which results in a great reduction in
the expression of curli fibres at temperatures higher than
30°C and at high osmolarity in most strains [52]. Recently
a novel regulator, termed MlrA was found to be required
for curli production and extracellular matrix formation

Gut Pathogens 2009, 1:22

[53]. The ability of curli polymers to specifically interact
with numerous human proteins such as the matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin, and proteins of the fibrinolytic and contact-phase systems, facilitates the adaptation
of curli-expressing bacteria to different niches in the
infected host [51]. It has further been shown that curliated
E. coli in human plasma absorbs plasminogen and tissue
plasminogen activator, leading to the formation of proteolytically active plasmin which may promote bacterial
spreading through tissue degradation [51].
Polymerization of curlin to fimbriae-like structures (curli)
on the surface of E. coli differs from the prevailing model
of fimbrial assembly, in that, it occurs extracellularly
through a self-assembly process depending on a specific
nucleator protein [54]. Curli polymers are formed as a
result of a conformational change of soluble csgA initiated
by an interaction with a nucleating csgB protein and such
an induced conformational change might involve a conversion from a partially disordered structure in the monomeric state to readily ordered secondary structures in the
polymeric state [54].
Studies on the pathogenic role of curli in avian pathogenic
E. coli infections have also been carried out, and there is
evidence that haemagglutination activity, fibronectin
binding and curli production are co-expressed in an APEC
strain and haemagglutination and fibronectin binding are
recognized as virulence factors that may be important in
the adherence of pathogens to host surfaces [55]. In
another study, it was seen that 99% E. coli isolated from
diseased birds possessed the csgA gene responsible for
curli biosynthesis [56]. Furthermore curli fibres were
found to be essential for the internalization of bacteria
causing avian septicaemia as seen in vitro [52].
S Fimbriae
The S fimbriae were discovered as a group of fimbriae
among pyelonephritogenic E. coli strains which recognized neuraminic acid (sialic acid) - containing structures
other than mannosides or P antigens on human erythrocytes [57] and were termed the S fimbriae based on their
receptor specificity, that is, their specific binding to sialyl
galactosides [58]. Morphologically, S fimbriae are similar
to type 1 or P fimbriae of E. coli, that is, they are 1 to 2 μm
in length, around 5 to 7 nm in diameter and their subunit
size is equal to that of type 1 fimbriae of E. coli [58]. The
S-fimbrial adhesins (Sfa) were reported to be most often
found among meningitis- and sepsis-associated E. coli isolates [59].

The sfa genetic determinant (6.5 kb) for these fimbriae
was cloned and found to code for at least seven sfa-specific
gene products [59]. This determinant represents a cluster
of genes with a homogeneous genetic structure and con-

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/22

sists of different regions involved in the production of the
fimbriae and the adhesin, the biogenesis of fimbriae, and
the control of transcription [60]. SfaS, the minor subunit
of the S fimbriae, a 14 kDa protein, localized at the distal
end of the sfa gene cluster, was identified as the sialic acid
- binding adhesin [61]. The entire sfa gene cluster consists
of sfaA, a major subunit protein of 16 kDa and three
minor subunit proteins sfaS of 15 kDa, sfaG of 17 kDa and
sfaH of 29 kDa, which together form the sfa complex [62].
Expression of the sfa determinant is dependent on several
environmental conditions, such as temperature, osmolarity, and the presence of glucose, while at the molecular
level, regulation of the sfa determinant is mediated by two
regulatory proteins sfaB and sfaC [63].
In a study on the prevalence of the S fimbriae among
ExPEC strains, it was observed that 50% UPEC, 24%
NMEC and 9.2% APEC strains harboured the sfa genes
[5]. In another study 79% of the septicaemic and diarrheic
E. coli isolates from pigs tested were found to be positive
for S fimbriae, while yet another study showed that the
prevalence of the S fimbriae in human and avian ExPEC
isolates of a certain phylogenetic group was 100% and
97% respectively [46,64]. Similarly various genotyping
studies have also reported the prevalence of S fimbriae
among ExPEC isolates [9,10,65].
It has been shown that S-fimbriated bacteria and the purified S fimbriae bind specifically to human epithelia, for
example, the vascular endothelium in both large vessels of
kidney tissue, the capillary endothelium in the interstitium and the visceral epithelium of the glomerulus which
are known to have a sialic acid coating [66]. An important
observation is that S fimbriae occur in some pyelonephritogenic E. coli strains but are mainly associated with
strains causing neonatal sepsis and meningitis [66]. S fimbriae have also been shown to bind the extracellular
matrix components of fibronectin and laminin and
sialoglycoproteins on brain microvascular endothelial
cells, an interaction that may explain migration across
physiological barriers [6].
A recent study revealed the identification of a new fimbrial cluster of the S-fimbrial adhesin family, which was
termed AC/I (avian E. coli I) or fac (fimbriae of avian E.
coli strains) [67]. These fimbriae did not haemagglutinate
red blood cells but were shown to adhere to avian tracheal
cells. Furthermore long-range mapping with specific DNA
probes showed that these fimbriae were related to S fimbriae [67].
F1C Fimbriae
A single F1C fimbria is a thin, 7-nm-wide, approximately
1 μm long surface polymer whose structure closely resembles that of type 1 fimbriae [68]. F1C fimbriae, with sub-

Gut Pathogens 2009, 1:22

units of about 17K, confer no haemagglutination to
erythrocytes from humans, oxen, horses, guinea-pigs or
chickens; however, they adhere to buccal epithelial cells
[69]. Although these fimbriae are not haemagglutinating,
they contribute to the adhesive properties of UPEC
strains, in that they mediate specific adherence to the collecting ducts and the distal tubules of the human kidney
[70], as well as to cultured renal tubulus cells [68]. The foc
(fimbriae of serotype 1C) gene cluster is involved in the
synthesis of F1C fimbriae. This gene cluster which has
been cloned and studied shows that six genes are involved
in the biogenesis of F1C fimbriae, including focA which
encodes the major fimbrial subunit, focC which encodes a
product that is indispensable for fimbria formation, focG
and focH which encode minor fimbrial subunits, and focI
that encodes a protein which shows similarities to the
subunit protein focA [70].
The F1C fimbriae (foc) genetic determinant is related to
the S fimbriae (sfa) genetic determinant, both of which
show a high degree of homology, in that, they show similarities in their DNA sequence composition and exhibit
common epitopes on their corresponding fimbrial proteins; however, the Sfa and F1C antigens differ in their
receptor specificities [71]. It has been shown that foc-specific gene products are able to produce a wild-type phenotype in sfa insertion mutants and that hybrid DNAs
consisting of sfa- and foc-specific sequences code for intact
fimbriae after transformation into non fimbriated E. coli
strains [71].
Until recently the exact receptor specificity of the F1C fimbriae was not known; however, in 2000, glycolipid receptors for purified F1C fimbriae were identified. TLC (thinlayer chromatography) fimbrial overlay analysis revealed
the binding ability of purified F1C fimbriae only to glucosylceramide (GlcCer), β1-linked galactosylceramide 2
(GalCer2) with non hydroxyl fatty acids, lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, paragloboside (nLc4Cer),
lactotriaosylceramide, gangliotriaosylceramide (asialoGM2 [GgO3Cer]) and gangliotetraosylceramide (asialoGM1 [GgO4Cer]) [72]. It has also been suggested that the
disaccharide sequence GalNAcβ1-4Galβ of asialo-GM2
(GgO3Cer) which is positioned internally in asialo-GM1
(GgO4Cer) is the high-affinity binding epitope for the F1C
fimbriae [72]. It was further reported that F1C fimbriated
bacteria selectively interact with two minor glycosphingolipids isolated from rat, canine, and human urinary
tract, and comparison of the binding-active compounds
with reference glycosphingolipids revealed that the receptor specificity is dependent on the ceramide composition
[73].
Dr Fimbriae
Vaisanen-Rhen et al. [74] originally described a mannoseresistant P blood group-independent haemagglutinin

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/22

which was expressed by a number of UPEC strains belonging to serogroup O75; accordingly, this adhesin was
named O75X [75]. Nowicki et al. showed that the Dr
blood group antigen, a component of the IFC (Inab-Freiberger Cromer) blood group complex, is the receptor for
the O75X fimbrial-like adhesin and the molecule recognized by the Dr haemagglutinin is a chloramphenicol-like
structure [76]. The name Dr haemagglutinin for the O75X
fimbrial-like adhesin was therefore proposed [76]. It was
observed that the Dr blood group substance was found in
the tubular basement membrane and Bowman's capsule
of the human kidney [76] and Dr adhesins have been
shown to bind preferentially to basement membranes of
human and canine kidneys, Bowmans capsule and to a
lesser extent to the bladder epithelium [75].
The Dr fimbriae or O75X fimbriae are chemically very
similar but morphologically different from typical E. coli
fimbriae, and electron microscopy has revealed that the
purified proteins were shown to be arranged in a coil-like
structure which consists of subunits with an apparent
molecular mass of about 15 kDa [77]. The Dr adhesinencoding operon was identified and termed dra of which
four genes, draA, draC, draD and draE are required for full
expression of the mannose resistant haemagglutinin phenotype [75]. DraE of the Dr operon encodes the major
structural subunit that compose the respective fimbrial
appendages and is also the adhesive subunit for the DAF
(decay accelerating factor) receptor [78]. The products of
the draB and draC genes exhibit similarity to chaperoneusher proteins belonging to the superfamily of PapD like
chaperones [79].
A number of studies have assessed the role of Dr fimbriae
in the pathogenesis of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli. It
has been reported that E. coli with Dr fimbriae persisted in
the kidney tissue and were associated with significant tubulointerstitial nephritis, whereas an E. coli mutant without
Dr fimbriae was gradually cleared from kidney tissue
which displayed significantly less pathology [80]. It was
also observed that infections during pregnancy with E. coli
bearing adhesins of the Dr family may pose a threat for
patients due to bacterial invasive potential and pregnancy-associated up-regulation of DAF receptor [81].
Immunization of mice with the E. coli Dr fimbrial antigen
reduced mortality associated with an experimental urinary tract infection due to a homologous strain bearing
the Dr adhesin, while immune sera with high titers of
anti-Dr antibody inhibited bacterial binding to the bladder and kidneys but did not affect the rate of renal colonization [82]. Dr fimbriae have been found to be prevalent
among APEC (1.3%), UPEC (6.1%) and NMEC (3.8%)
isolates; however, in a lower percentage as compared to
type 1 fimbriae, P fimbriae or S fimbriae [5].

Afimbrial adhesins
More than 20 years ago, it was observed that 10% of the
E. coli strains, which agglutinated human erythrocytes in
the presence of D-mannose, also termed mannose-resistant haemagglutination (MRHA), did not show any fimbriae and still adhered to uroepithelial cells, suggesting
the existence of afimbrial adhesins [83]. It was also found
that about 6.7 kb of DNA were required for the expression
of the MRHA of human erythrocytes and to confer adhesion, and that this binding function was mediated by a 16
kDa protein named AFA-I [83].

The 6.7 kb insert expresses five polypeptides of molecular
mass 13 kDa, 16 kDa, 18.5 kDa, 30 kDa, and 100 kDa,
encoded, respectively, by the afaA, afaE, afaD, afaB and
afaC genes which are localized and belong to the same
transcriptional unit [84]. The afaE gene encodes the
adhesin or haemagglutinin AFA-I polypeptide, the afaB
gene is also required for MRHA expression, however, does
not play an obvious role in the biosynthesis or the maturation of the AFA-I haemagglutinin, while the afaC gene
codes for a polypeptide synthesized as a precursor and its
gene product is transported through the cytoplasmic
membrane by means of a signal sequence [84]. Purification and characterization of the afimbrial adhesin AFA-I
showed that it exists on the bacterial surface and free as a
macromolecular aggregate in the supernatant of spent culture medium, and is composed of a single, repeating 16
kDa polypeptide subunit [85]. Transformation of non
adherent recipient pyelonephritic strains with recombinant plasmids carrying the afa-I operon confers binding
specificities and biochemical properties different from
those observed with strains expressing type 1, P fimbriae
and S fimbriae [86].
It was later demonstrated that there exist gene clusters
structurally related to the first afa operon which was
described, but which encoded antigenically distinct afimbrial adhesins; experiments demonstrated that all the afa
gene clusters harboured a highly conserved 4.1 kb DNA
segment carrying the afaB, afaC and afaD genes and
revealed heterogeneity for the afaE sequences [87]. It was
therefore proposed that there exist at least four different
afa operons, afa-1, afa-2, afa-3 and afa-4 which encode
variable adhesins designated AFA-I, AFA-II, AFA-III and
AFA-IV respectively [87]. AFA-I and AFA-III belong to a
family of haemagglutinins which also include the Dr fimbrial adhesin, and this heterogeneous adhesin family is
referred to as the Dr family [87]. Two afa operons, designated afa-7 and afa-8 found in bovine isolates were cloned
and analyzed, and afa-8 was found to be widespread
among bovine pathogenic E. coli strains associated with
diarrhoea and septicaemia [88]. Prevalence studies have
shown that afimbrial adhesins occur among APEC (1.3-

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/22

8.2%), UPEC (6.1-12.6%) and NMEC (3.8-25.6%) isolates [5,65].
Temperature sensitive haemagglutinin
A mannose-resistant haemagglutinin of an avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) isolate was identified, which was
found to be best expressed at lower temperatures [89].
Haemagglutination activity was highest when cells were
grown at 26°C and lower in cells grown at 37°C, while
cells grown at 42°C lacked activity. This temperaturedependent haemagglutination phenotype was termed Tsh
for temperature sensitive haemagglutinin [89]. The gene
responsible for the Tsh phenotype, tsh, was cloned and
characterized and found to confer a haemagglutinationpositive phenotype to E. coli K-12 strains [89]. It was
found that E. coli K-12 strains containing a recombinant
tsh gene produce two proteins, a 106 kDa extracellular
protein and a 33 kDa outer membrane protein, and were
able to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes [90]. Further studies revealed that Tsh is synthesized as a 140 kDa precursor
protein, whose processing results in a 106 kDa passenger
or secreted domain and a 33 kDa β- barrel domain
[91,92]. The role of Tsh during pathogenesis of APEC
infections has been studied. It was demonstrated that out
of 300 avian E. coli isolates examined for the prevalence of
the tsh gene, half of the isolates were tsh positive and tsh
was specifically more frequent in high-lethality isolates
compared to low-lethality isolates [92]. In another study
it was shown that the tsh gene was prevalent in more than
50% of APEC, 4.5% UPEC and 11.5% NMEC isolates
tested [5]. It was further seen that in the tsh positive strains
examined, tsh was always plasmid encoded and was
linked to colicin V genes when they were present on the
same plasmid [92]. In an additional study it was also
reported that purified Tsh secreted domain is capable of
adhering to red blood cells, haemoglobin, and the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen IV [91].
Novel adhesin gene clusters
With the availability of whole genome sequences for crucial pathogens, including many ExPEC prototypic isolates,
many novel genes, including those encoding putative
adhesins, have been found to be present on the genome
of these strains and it has become clear that a single strain
produces many different adhesins at one time or the
other. A novel trimeric autotransporter adhesin UpaG was
recently identified through a reverse vaccinology
approach as a potentially protective antigen against
ExPEC and characterized for its role in ExPEC adhesion
[93,94]. UpaG is an adhesin located on the cell surface,
exported there by virtue of a C-terminal β-domain, and
mediates the aggregation of E. coli as well as its adhesion
to abiotic surfaces, T24 bladder epithelial cells, and extracellular membrane proteins [93].

Additionally, the sequencing of a prototypic cystitis strain
UTI89 revealed that the strain contains at least ten different chaperone-usher adhesin systems including fim and
pap which still remain the only two adhesins best characterized [6,95]. Other putative adhesins like auf, yad, yqi,
yeh and fml have been identified in UTI89; however, all
except for yqi, have yet to be characterized for their role in
pathogenesis. The adhesin, Yqi, has been now found to
play an important role in colonization, the first step of
pathogenesis, during APEC infection [96].
ExPEC adhesin I (yqi) - a novel fimbrial adhesin of ExPEC
Recently a new fimbrial adhesin encoded by gene yqi was
identified in an APEC strain IMT5155 (O2:K1:H5) via signature-tagged mutagenesis in a chicken lung colonization
model of infection [96,97]. Its gene product has been temporarily designated ExPEC Adhesin I (EA/I) until the specific host receptor for this adhesin can be identified,
which would permit better classification and nomenclature of the novel adhesin in the future. ExPEC Adhesin I
has now partially been characterized and it has been
shown that deletion of the adhesin gene yqi, resulted in
reduced colonization ability by APEC strain IMT5155
both in vitro and in vivo. The adhesin gene yqi is located on
a 4,975 bp gene cluster. Genomic organization of this
gene cluster is similar to the genomic organization of the
P fimbrial pap operon, in that, the putative outer membrane usher precedes the periplasmic chaperone which is
followed by the adhesin gene. A conserved hypothetical
protein gene precedes the usher in the yqi gene cluster,
which may eventually code for the adhesin subunit protein; however, this still needs to be proven. Cloning of the
4,975 bp adhesin gene cluster in an afimbriate E. coli
strain in vitro, led to the expression of short fimbrial like
appendages protruding out of the bacterial outer membrane as observed by electron microscopy.

The adhesin encoding gene yqi was found to be prevalent
among ExPEC isolates including APEC, UPEC and NMEC
by more than 50 percent, and absent in all of the intestinal
pathogenic E. coli strains tested, thereby validating the
designation of the adhesin as ExPEC adhesin I. In addition, prevalence of the adhesin was most frequently associated with the B2 phylogenetic group and ST95 complex
of the multi locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme http://
mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/mlst/dbs/Ecoli/, with evidence of a positive selection within this highly pathogenic complex [96].
Role of ExPEC adhesins in the gut
So far, the functional role of adhesins in the colonization
of the intestinal tract by ExPEC is inadequately understood. Limited studies have dealt with the aspects of intestinal colonization by ExPEC, being extraintestinal
pathogens, thereby focussing on infection models involving extraintestinal anatomical sites or cell lines in order to

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/22

study the adhesion and colonization abilities of these
pathogens better. Nevertheless, in one study, the role of
type 1 fimbriae and curli in an APEC strain was even studied with respect to colonization of the gut of the chicken
suggesting the role of these adhesins in the intestinal tract
[98]. In a separate study type 1, P, S and Dr fimbriae, were
found to mediate binding to colonic and ileal enterocytes
[99]. Recently Schierack et al. reported the isolation of a
haemolytic E. coli clone that dominated the coliform flora
of piglets, and which did not harbour any virulence determinants typical for intestinal pathogenic E. coli isolates
from swine, but had a virulence gene profile very similar
to ExPEC and harboured type 1 and P fimbriae, besides
curli and temperature sensitive haemagglutinin [100]. The
authors further suggested the potential role of ExPEC virulence associated genes, including adhesins, in the successful intestinal colonization ability in piglets.
Apart from ExPEC, intestinal E. coli also harbour adhesins
like type 1 fimbriae, curli and F1C fimbriae, and the function of these adhesins in intestinal colonization has been
fairly well studied. Recently the F1C fimbriae were found
to play an important role in intestinal colonization by a
commensal strain E. coli Nissle 1917 [101], while curli
were found to be responsible for increased adherence of
Shiga-toxin producing E. coli strain to a colonic cell line
[102].
Taken together these studies signify the importance of
ExPEC adhesins in the gut of the host, providing a sound
basis for investigating their role in intestinal colonization
further.

Conclusion
The group of E. coli known as the extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) show great variety in the fimbrial
adhesin systems they possess. The presence of multiple
pilus systems likely confers niche-adaptive advantages,
and the combination of receptor specificity and tissuespecific receptor production will ultimately determine the
site of action for a given pilus during infection. ExPEC harbour many known and unknown adhesin systems.
Ahmed et al. previously reported that bacterial genome
fluidity could be exploited for diagnostic and health-care
applications, for example, the presence or absence of virulence genes, or the expression of functional virulence factors could be used as diagnostic markers and antigens of
markers of infection [103]. Therefore, understanding and
functionally characterizing the roles of putative adhesins
in pathogenesis will most likely provide new targets for
therapeutic intervention in the diagnosis, treatment and
prevention of ExPEC infection.
Most adhesins function by binding to a specific receptor
on the host tissue during infection as already described.

Therefore, a single pathogen may make use of multiple
adhesins, with affinities to different specific receptors
which enable the pathogen to adapt to different host tissues during initiation of infection. The receptor for the
newly identified ExPEC adhesin I is still unknown, and
the identification of such a receptor would indeed be of
great value in future prevention therapies, for example, by
blocking of the receptors to prevent the pathogen from
attaching to host surfaces. In addition it will also allow for
appropriate nomenclature of this adhesin in the future.

study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Since for most bacteria, the first encounter with their host
involves attachment to a eukaryotic cell surface, which
results in colonization of the host prior to disease,
induced antibody responses at the mucosal surface could
prevent attachment and abrogate colonization [104]. The
ideal target, therefore, for such antibodies are the surface
proteins or adhesins which mediate microbial attachment
to host tissue [105], making them extremely good vaccine
candidates. An important aspect here is that the intestine
is said to be a reservoir for ExPEC, suggesting that ExPEC
would initially colonize the intestinal tract which could
eventually then lead to an extraintestinal infection given
the right conditions. In this case, it might be interesting to
find out whether the ExPEC adhesins play a role in colonization of the intestinal tract by these pathogens. To date,
there are to the best of our knowledge only a handful of
studies describing the role of ExPEC in the gut as already
described; however, this could be an interesting study
area, and adhesin vaccines could be developed in future
that may be more effective in the intestinal tract, an interesting facet that could be used for the prevention of
extraintestinal infection. Thus, vaccination studies with
newly identified adhesins like ExPEC adhesin I could
indeed prove vital and promising in the future in order to
subsequently prevent ExPEC infections that are still a
threat to many.
