Abstract
Background: Musa species (Zingiberaceae, Zingiberales) including bananas and plantains are
collectively the fourth most important crop in developing countries. Knowledge concerning Musa
genome structure and the origin of distinct cultivars has greatly increased over the last few years.
Until now, however, no large-scale analyses of Musa genomic sequence have been conducted. This
study compares genomic sequence in two Musa species with orthologous regions in the rice
genome.

Results: We produced 1.4 Mb of Musa sequence from 13 BAC clones, annotated and analyzed
them along with 4 previously sequenced BACs. The 443 predicted genes revealed that Zingiberales
genes share GC content and distribution characteristics with eudicot and Poaceae genomes.
Comparison with rice revealed microsynteny regions that have persisted since the divergence of
the Commelinid orders Poales and Zingiberales at least 117 Mya. The previously hypothesized
large-scale duplication event in the common ancestor of major cereal lineages within the Poaceae
was verified. The divergence time distributions for Musa-Zingiber (Zingiberaceae, Zingiberales)
orthologs and paralogs provide strong evidence for a large-scale duplication event in the Musa
lineage after its divergence from the Zingiberaceae approximately 61 Mya. Comparisons of genomic
regions from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana revealed highly conserved genome structure, and
indicated that these genomes diverged circa 4.6 Mya.
Conclusion: These results point to the utility of comparative analyses between distantly-related
monocot species such as rice and Musa for improving our understanding of monocot genome
evolution. Sequencing the genome of M. acuminata would provide a strong foundation for
comparative genomics in the monocots. In addition a genome sequence would aid genomic and
genetic analyses of cultivated Musa polyploid genotypes in research aimed at localizing and cloning
genes controlling important agronomic traits for breeding purposes.

Background
Taken together, Musa species (bananas and plantains)
comprise the fourth most important crop in developing
countries [1]. The fruit is a staple food in sub-Saharan
Africa, South and Central America and much of Asia,
while the leaves are used for sheltering and wrapping food
and the male bud can be eaten as a vegetable. Musa is a
member of the monocot order Zingiberales, a Commelinid lineage that diverged from the line leading to rice
(Poales) in the mid-cretaceous period over 100 million
years ago (Figure 1) [2,3]. The Musa species Musa acuminata (AA genome) and Musa balbisiana (BB genome), both
with 2n = 22 chromosomes, represent the two main progenitors of cultivated banana varieties. Table bananas are
sterile, parthenocarpic and diploids AA or triploid with
the AAA genome constitution, and represent only a fraction of world production, although they are an important
cash crop. Cooking bananas and plantain cultivars,
mostly consumed in the countries of production, generally have an AAB or ABB genome constitutions [4]; these
are boiled, fried, dried, or sometimes ground into flour.
Knowledge concerning the genetic diversity, the origin of
cultivars [5-12] and Musa genome structure [13-15] has
greatly increased over the last few years. The haploid
genome of Musa species was estimated as varying between
560 to 600 Mb in size [16,17], just four times larger than
that of the model plant Arabidopsis (125 Mb) [18] and
30% larger than that of rice (390 Mb) [19]. Genetic maps
have been developed [20-23] and recently, BAC resources
were generated for both M. acuminata [24,25] and M. balbisiana [26]. A cytogenetic map based on BAC-FISH is
being anchored to genetic maps in order to better characterize structural variation among M. acuminata genomes
[22]. These resources will pave the way for studies of Musa

genome structure and evolution through comparisons
with other monocot and eudicot genomes.
The utility of genomic comparisons of monocot and eudicot plants (e.g. [27-30]) is growing with the availability of
the complete genome sequences of rice [19], Arabidopsis
[18] and poplar [31], and active genome sequencing
projects for a growing number of other angiosperms [32].
Most genome-scale comparative investigations within the
monocots have focused on analyses of closely-related species of monocots belonging to the family of Poaceae
[27,33-36]. Numerous papers have described extensive
microsynteny between rice, barley, wheat, maize, Sorghum
and sugarcane [27,35,37-42], although the degree of conservation varies between different chromosomal locations. Fewer attempts have been made to investigate the
synteny between distantly-related plants. In addition,
whereas extensive genomic resources have been developed for rice and other cereal species in the grass family
(Poaceae), there is relatively little data on gene content or
genome structure for non-grass monocots (Figure 1).
Recently, the first two BAC clones genomic sequences
[43], and a BAC end sequencing study of the M. acuminata
genome [44] have been published. Here we present data
on the genomic structure and organization of 1.8 Mb of
Musa genomic nuclear DNA (including the two BAC
sequenced previously [43]), show for the first time the
existence of microsynteny between Musa, rice and Arabidopsis, characterize the extent of microsynteny between
the two Musa species representing the progenitors of most
cultivated genotypes, analyze monocot EST sequences
and discuss the evolutionary implication of these results.
The BAC clones sequenced in this study were identified by
hybridization with gene sequences previously selected to
correspond to one or a few loci in Musa, rice and ArabiPage 2 of 20

Results
Selection of Musa BAC clones using broad-spectrum
Sorghum cDNA and Musa RFLP probes
As part of a program aiming at selecting conserved probes
from monocotyledons and Arabidopsis thaliana towards
comparative genetic mapping studies, genomic and cDNA
probes from various species were tested by Southern
hybridization on DNA of various monocotyledons
including Musa and rice. Among the probes found conserved between rice, M. acuminata cv. Madang, M. balbisiana cv. Pisang Klutuk Wulung (PKW) and Arabidopsis
that revealed a single or low copy locus hybridization pattern, nine were selected. These nine probes that correspond to Sorghum bicolor cDNAs (SbRPG) were used to
screen a M. acuminata cv. Calcutta-4 bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) library (Table 1 and Additional file
1). Of these nine SbRPG genes, four encoded nuclear
genes targeted to the chloroplast and/or implicated in
photosynthetic-related functions, supporting the notion
that this class of genes is under strong pressure for functional conservation. All Musa BACs identified were subjected to HindIII fingerprinting. This enabled us to
separate the Musa BACs into groups likely to be derived
from different regions of the Musa genome. Overall, a
good correlation was observed between the number of
loci identified in rice, Sorghum and Musa by Southern blot,
BAC fingerprint (for Musa) and analysis of whole genome
sequence (for rice) for these nine SbRPG genes (Table 1),
all of which were found to be in single or low-copy in
both Musa and rice.

One BAC clone was selected for sequencing for probe
SbRPG132. For probes SbRPG373, SbRPG661 and
SbRPG851, which were found to be present in one or two
copies in rice, two Musa BACs with distinct HindIII fingerprints that might be derived from homeologous regions
were selected for sequencing with the aim of studying the
evolution of lineage-specific duplications in both Musa
and rice (Table 1). Two BAC clones from M. acuminata cv.
Calcutta-4 (Musa A) and two BACs from M. balbisiana cv.
PKW (Musa B) isolated using the genetically-mapped
RFLP single-copy probes CIR560 and CIR257 [23] were
also fully sequenced with the objective of studying the
extent of synteny between Musa A and B species as well as
against the rice genome. These RFLP probes were selected
because they corresponded to genomic clones encoding
genes of known function, CIR257 for a GA-20 oxidase and
CIR560 for a beta 1–3 glucanase, previously shown to be
associated to traits of agronomic importance in controlling plant height [45,46] and stress response [47-50],
respectively.

Analysis of 1.8 Mb of Musa genomic sequences reveals
particular features for the Musa genes
Musa genome statistics
A total of 13 BACs (Table 1) were sequenced, generating
over 1.4 Mb of unique Musa sequence. In order to provide
a uniform set, data four additional BAC sequences (see
Additional file 2 and [43]) were included in our annotation pipeline. These analyses revealed 443 predicted genes
(on a total of 1.8 Mb of Musa genomic sequence from 17
BAC inserts), after elimination of all putative protein coding genes smaller than 100 amino acid residues. Approximately half of the gene models had matches in GenBank.
Their classification based on similarities to genes found in
the public sequence databases is presented in Additional
file 3 and an annotation overview of the Musa genes in
Additional file 4. Gene models were also compared
against the Musa EST database donated to the Global
Musa Genomics Consortium by Syngenta and maintained
at the MIPS (Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequences, Munich Germany), revealing that at least 10%
of the predicted genes had a perfect match with EST
sequences, thus probably being expressed in Musa tissues.
Analysis of gene size, exon-intron structure and base composition for these 443 predicted genes is summarized in
Table 2. The annotation revealed that, with the exception
of MA4_78I12, the BACs analyzed were gene-rich (an
average density of one gene per 4.1 kb). Our annotation
of MuH9 revealed a total of 23 gene models for an average
gene density of one gene per 3.6 kb compared with one
gene per 6.9 kb based upon the earlier annotation [43]. In
the case of MuG9, our pipeline predicted a total of 14 gene
models in the first 52 kb of this BAC followed by a region
of ~21 kb containing only transposons (5). Thus the gene
density in the non-transposon containing region is one
gene per 3.7 kb, very similar to MuH9. Previous annotation of this BAC [43] predicted 7 genes in the same 52 kb
region for a density of one gene per 7 kb, with the remainder being transposon-related. The difference between the
two annotations is due mainly to the larger number of
hypothetical genes identified by the TIGR pipeline as well
as some gene splits (e.g. MuH9-5 is split into three genes).
Like the last ~21 kb of MuG9, BAC MA4_78I12 found to
be mainly composed of class II transposable elements and
also contains 7 interspersed predicted genes of which only
the homolog of the SbRPG661 probe had a match in public databases. BAC-FISH experiments showed that BAC
MA4_78I12 hybridized to all M. acuminata chromosomes
except their extremities (Figure 2A). This pattern of
hybridization is similar to what we observed by genomic
in situ hybridization (GISH) using total genomic DNA as
a probe and suggested that the extremities of the chromosomes are poor in repeated sequences [14]. Two gene-rich
BACs (MA4_54N07 and MA4_82I11) were also analyzed
by BAC-FISH and each hybridized at the extremity of one
chromosome (see Figure 2B for MA4_54N07).

Base Composition and GC Distribution along the Musa genes
The GC content of Musa coding sequences was compared
with those of other monocots (rice, onion, asparagus) and
dicots (Arabidopsis) using two data sets -unigene clusters
and -singleton ESTs found in the TIGR plant transcript
assembly database (TC/ESTs; [51]) and the 443 annotated
genes (CDS) from the 17 Musa spp. sequenced BAC clones
(Figure 3). The GC distributions of TC/EST (Figure 3A)
and CDS regions of the Musa BACs (Figure 3B) were
found to be asymmetrical and bimodal as compared to
Arabidopsis and onion which are clearly symmetrical and
unimodal (this report, [52,53]). The Musa GC content distribution resembles that of rice and other Poales with
higher average GC content than eudicots (see also Table
2) and a long tail towards high GC values. We next examined GC content along the direction of transcription from
the ATG start codon for each predicted Musa CDS using a
sliding window of 129 bases (Figure 4). By manual
inspection of the data, we were able to identify two categories of GC profiles from the Musa CDS: the first set
shows a marked "rice-like" gradient of GC composition
from 5' to 3' end and a higher GC content than Arabidopsis all along the CDS (Figure 4A), and the second set is
"Arabidopsis-like" lacking a significant GC gradient from
5' to 3' (Figure 4B).
Analysis of Musa repetitive elements
Several approaches were used to characterize the genomic
sequence with respect to repeats. Database searches of the
predicted genes against a non-redundant protein database
(see Methods section) revealed a total of 78 transposable
element (TE)-related sequences. Excluding TE-rich BAC
MA4_78I12, there are on average ~2.6 retrotransposons
(TE of class I) per 100 kb. Only one TE of class II encoded
protein was detected. BAC sequences were also screened
for previously characterized Musa RADKA repeats [15]; an
average of 1.8 RADKA-related repeats (GenBank Acces-

sions AF399938-AF399941, AF399943-AF399946 and
AF399948) per 100 kb were identified. In an attempt to
identify as yet uncharacterized repeats, the BAC sequences
were also analyzed by RepeatScout [54]. After removing
repeats having similarity to Arabidopsis or rice proteins,
Musa CDS, RADKA sequences and transposable elements,
six repeats with at least three copies were identified (data
not shown). Five of these sequences have no significant
hits to genes in GenBank while the sixth matches GenBank accession X99496 with a strong similarity to a part
of the Musa ycf2 chloroplast gene. Analysis of individual
BACs with PrintRepeats [55] shows that each BAC contains only a small number of regions that are repeated
within the BAC, an observation that is supported by the
relative ease with which the BAC sequences could be
closed and finished.
Microsynteny analysis between Musa and either rice or
Arabidopsis
The 443 Musa predicted proteins were aligned against the
rice and Arabidopsis proteomes. The results showed that
268 and 224 Musa proteins have hits with an E-value
threshold of 1e-10 against the rice and Arabidopsis proteomes, respectively. The relative positions of the homologous genes identified in the rice and Arabidopsis
genomes were compared to the order of the corresponding Musa genes with i-ADHoRe software [56]. Using this
stringent approach, we were able to identify nine Musa
BAC sequences showing microsynteny among the 17
Musa BACs analyzed: eight cases with rice and one case
with Arabidopsis (Additional file 5).

The i-ADHoRe analyses identified syntenic blocks of three
to ten genes (Additional file 5). We then refined the analyses by conducting reciprocal BLASTP searches between

the genes in the orthologous regions. This analysis
extended the number of genes included in these syntenic
blocks. The most interesting cases of synteny conservation
were found between BAC MBP_91N22 and rice chromosome 1 (Figure 5A), BAC MA4_25J11 and rice chromosomes 1 and 5 (Figure 5B), BAC MA4_8L21 and rice
chromosome 3 (Figure 5C), BAC MuH9 and rice chromosome 4 (Additional file 6), and BAC MA4_42M13 and rice
chromosome 2 (Additional file 7). Between five and
eleven genes were found in common between the syntenic
Musa and rice orthologous regions. In most cases the common genes were found in the same order and orientation
in rice and Musa. However, several additional genes were
typically found between the shared orthologs. Interestingly, the number of genes without orthologs within otherwise syntenic regions is much higher in rice as compared
to Musa. This could be explained by differences between
the rice and Musa lineages in the rate of translocation,
duplication and gene death. Note also that Musa BAC

MBP_91N22 displays conservation of synteny with two
very distant segments on rice chromosome 1.
In the case of BAC MA4_25J11, two rice orthologous
regions were found with i-ADHoRe analyses and reciprocal BLASTP searches (rice chromosomes 1 and 5), revealing a duplication of this region in the rice genome. It is
interesting to note that the two rice orthologous regions
on chromosomes 1 and 5 have lost different sets of genes
compared to Musa, as has been observed previously in
other duplicated regions in angiosperms [37,57,58]. Phylogenetic analyses on the 10 Musa genes from BAC
MA4_25J11 and co-orthologs [59] found on rice chromosomes 1 and 5 revealed that these regions were the product of the genome-wide duplication that has been

probes (CIR560 and CIR257) encoding genes of agronomic interest. In both cases a high level of sequence conservation was found (see Figure 7 and Additional file 10)
over the entire length of the sequenced regions in common between the two pairs of BACs analyzed (82.9% of
nucleotide sequence identity for the MA4_82I11MBP_81C12 pair and 87.6 % for the MA4_54N7MBP_91N22 pair). The overall levels of sequence identity
in genic regions were similar between the two pairs of
orthologous BACs: 96.0 % for the MA4_82I11MBP_81C12 pair and 96.3 % for the MA4_54N7MBP_91N22 pair (based on the aligned orthologous gene
pairs defined in Table 3; see the following paragraph for
further details). A high degree of synteny was found
between the orthologous sequences in both gene content
and gene orientation. However, we observed some incongruence between the gene predictions of the orthologous
BACs whose protein products have no match in public
databases (i.e. hypothetical protein genes). In contrast,
the predicted structures of genes that are homologous to
known sequences were largely congruent between the
orthologous BACs. Given the high levels of sequence conservation between the two Musa species, such variation of
gene structure and exon/intron boundaries is unlikely for
most functional genes. Hence, this analysis supports that
further validation of gene models through additional EST
sequencing or targeted RT-PCR is required.

divergence of the major grain lineages including rice,
maize and wheat.
The only significant case of microcolinearity found
between Musa and Arabidopsis involved three consecutive
genes (Additional file 9). Interestingly, this Musa-Arabidopsis syntenic block was not found to be conserved in
rice.
Syntenic relationships between two regions of M.
acuminata and M. balbisiana
We also investigated conservation of synteny between two
regions of the genomes of M. acuminata and M. balbisiana
species. Hybrids between these two species represent the
majority of cultivated Musa genotypes worldwide. To
carry out this pilot study, we selected BACs from orthologous regions of two single-copy, genetically-mapped RFLP

Divergence between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana
In order to evaluate the degree of divergence between the
two Musa genomes, we obtained maximum likelihood
estimates for Ks values comparing pairs of orthologous
genes identified in the M. acuminata and M. balbisiana
BACs. We restricted our analysis to those genes (detailed
in Table 3) that were intact and matched known gene
sequences. For example the gene model for the 14th locus
in the M. acuminata genome (Figure 7; L14) is similar to a
pectinesterase related protein, but the gene model was
excluded from the analysis because the predicted coding
sequence contained several in-frame stop codons indicating that this sequence is a pseudogene. The estimated Ks
values ranged from 0.0231 (Additional file 10; L19) to
0.0960 (L17), far below saturation levels (i.e. Ks << 1),
with an average of 0.0410 (Table 3). Applying an average
synonymous substitution rate of 4.5 per 109 years for
nuclear genes in the Zingiberales (see below), this suggests that M. acuminata and M. balbisiana diverged approximately 4.6 Mya ago.
Evidence for a large-scale duplication event in the Musa
ancestor
We also estimated the Ks values between 1,446 pairs of
duplicated Musa genes identified among 15,661 ESTderived unigenes found to be part of the paralog sets [63].
The distribution of Ks values was estimated in order to

assess spikes in the accumulation of duplicated genes
[64]. If we assume that gene duplications and gene deletions are random and have relatively steady rates during
the course of evolution, such a distribution is expected to
show an L shape [64-68]. The distribution of Ks values for
duplicated Musa genes exhibits a large peak centered
around Ks = 0.55 (Figure 8) indicating an increase in the
number of gene duplications that occurred in the Musa
ancestor circa 61 Mya (assuming a synonymous substitution rate of 4.5 per 109 years; see below). This ancient
burst of duplications is likely the result of one or more
large-scale duplication events. Alternatively, the observed
duplications could be associated with a burst of transposon activity as has been hypothesized for some duplicate
gene pairs in Arabidopsis [69]. However, analyses of Ks
plots for duplicated rice genes were unable to detect the
60 Mya duplication event in the Poacae that is evident in
analyses of gene trees and duplicated blocks in the rice
genome (e.g. [70,61]; this study). This may be due in part
to the slower substitution rate we estimate for the Zingiberales relative to the Poaceae (see below).

Ks values were also computed on 1,034 pairs of homologous genes identified between the Musa ESTs and the rice
genome sequences. As expected, the distribution of Ks values between rice-Musa homologs form a single peak centred around Ks = 1.7 (Figure 8). Using this Ks value to
estimate the age of the Poales-Zingiberales split is less
straightforward than described above for the Musa-Zingiber split, because synonymous substitution rates clearly
vary between these Commelinid monocot lineages.

We also analyzed the 18,612 ginger (Zingiber officinale;
Zingiberaceae, Zingiberales) EST-derived unigenes available on the TIGR Plant Transcript Assemblies web site [71]
(sequences generated by David Gang, University of Arizona) and found no evidence of large-scale duplication in
the Ks distribution for paralogous pairs (Figure 8). Moreover, the modal Ks for reciprocal best matches between the
Musa and Zingiber unigene sets is 0.78 (Figure 8), larger
than the mode for Musa paralogous pairs. The age of the
most recent common ancestor for the Musacaceae and
Zingiberaceae is estimated at 87 Mya [3,72,73]. This
implies an average synonymous substitution rate of 4.5
per 109 years (0.78 synonymous substitutions per site/

BAC fingerprint analyses revealed that whereas SbRPG854
hybridized to a single locus in the Musa genome, SbRPG
probes SbRPG132 hybridized to 6 regions, SbRPG663
hybridized to 5 loci, and two loci were identified for
SbRPG373, SbRPG661 and SbRPG851 (Table 1 and Additional file 1). BACs representing both distinct loci hybridizing to probes SbRPG661, SbRPG373 and SbRPG851
were sequenced with the aim of dating the time of duplication relative to the divergence of the Musa and rice lineages. Pair-wise estimations of Ks, the number of
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, were
0.93 (± 0.25), 1.39 (± 0.19) and 1.43 (± 0.60) for Musa
homologs of the coding regions of SbRPG661 (thiore-

(2*87,000,000 years)), intermediate between rates estimated for the Poaceae (6.1–6.5 per 109 years) and palms
in the order Arecales (2.61 per 109 years; [74]. We must
emphasize that all of these rate estimates are approximate,
based on rough estimates of minimum divergence times.
However, regardless of ambiguities in substitution rate
calibrations, our results indicate that the predicted largescale duplication that occurred in the Musa lineage (Ks =
0.55) post-dates the divergence of lineages leading to Zingiber and Musa (Ks = 0.78), but occurred well before the
separation of Musa A and Musa B (Ks = 0.0410).

doxin), SbRPG851 (phosphoglycerate kinase) and
SbRPG373 (hypothetical protein), respectively. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the SbRPG851 Musa
homologs duplicated prior to the divergence of the Poales
and the Zingiberales, (probably independent from the
large-scale duplication described above), and the
SbRPG661 and SbRPG373 Musa homologs are sister to
each other in the gene tree, suggesting the duplications
arose after the divergence of the Poales and the Zingiberales (data not shown).
We also analyzed the degree of conservation between
genomic regions surrounding SbRPG661, SbRPG851 and
SbRPG373 duplicated genes in Musa and rice and found
no synteny in regions anchored by these homologs. This
absence of synteny could be explained by duplication
events and subsequent gene losses or by the translocation
of the focal genes.

Discussion
Analysis of Musa genes reveals some particular features
Sequencing and annotation of ~1.8 Mb of Musa genomic
sequence indicated that most of the BACs analyzed were
gene rich with a low content of transposable element. Our
analyses of 443 Musa genes predicted revealed that Musa
genes generally have a "rice-like" bimodal GC distribution
with a very asymmetrical and long tail towards high GC
content as in previous studies [43,44]. However, a second
class of "Arabidopsis-like" genes was found with an overall low GC content and no significant gradient along the
coding sequence. In contrast to a previous comparison of
grass and non-grass monocots [52,53], our analyses suggest that Zingeberales genes share some characteristics
with the genomes of both eudicots and members of the
Poaceae. This result suggests that the Musa genome is
more similar to cereal genomes relative to onion, asparagus and the basal-most monocot lineage, Acorus.

Syntenic relationships between distantly-related monocots
Whereas widespread conservation of synteny has been
well established for members of the grass family
(Poaceae), gene order has not been generally conserved
between rice and Arabidopsis (e.g. reviewed by [75]. Few
studies have compared genome structure between the
members of the Poaceae and other monocot families, but
recent comparisons between onion, garden asparagus and
rice have failed to find evidence of conservation of macroor micro-synteny [76,77]. However the genomic tag
approach developed by [78] has allowed detecting anchor
points between grasses and monocots. In this study we
were able to identify microsyntenic regions in the Musa
and rice genomes that have persisted over some 117 million years of evolution since these two lineages diverged
[2]. However, in all syntenic regions detected, the shared
genes were separated by intervening genes reflecting the
occurrence of numerous insertions and deletion of genes
in both rice and Musa. Insertions and deletions have been
observed between rice and Arabidopsis regions showing
micro-colinearity [58] and to a much lower extent
between colinear regions among Poacea genomes [37,79].
Further sequencing of the Musa and other monocot
genomes will provide more insight on the extent of lineage-specific gene gain and loss in otherwise syntenic
regions.
A first insight into syntenic relationships between Musa A
and B
We focused our pilot study on two genomic regions containing genes of agronomic importance for Musa and rice
to gain insight into the extent of conservation between the
two cultivated species, M. acuminata (A genome) and M.
balbisiana (B genome). Our data revealed an extremely
high level of colinearity between the two Musa genomes
in both regions. However several insertions and deletions
occurred during the period of divergence (~4.6 Mya) of
the two Musa species. The high level of microsynteny
between the two genomes is likely to accelerate gene isolation in M. balbisiana once the construction of the whole
genome physical map of M. acuminata has been completed by the Global Musa Genomics Consortium.
Unveiling the paleopolyploid nature of Musa species
There is accumulating data supporting that polyploidy is
one of the most important evolutionary mechanisms
influencing the structure and content of angiosperm
genomes [80]. Our work indicates ancient polyploidization in the lineage leading to Musa approximately 60 Mya.
Similar lineage-specific events were described in the
Poaceae [81,82], Brassicaceae [56,83,84], Populus [31],
Solanaceae, Leguminoceae [64], Papaveraceae, Acorus, the
Magnoliids and the Nymphaceae [65]. Polyploidy has
clearly been an important source of genetic variation
across the angiosperms as retained duplicate genes typi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/58

cally show divergent patterns of gene expression [85,86].
In Musa, as in other plant species, novel phenotypes can
emerge from this genomic amalgam, including some with
high visibility to natural selection, such as organ size and
disease resistance.
Of particular interest is the "composite" nature of the
duplicated rice regions relative to the syntenic Musa BAC
MA4_25J11; different sets of genes were lost in rice chromosome 1 and 5, respectively as compared to Musa. This
type of evolution is likely to reflect a dynamic of duplication [62] and independent evolution in both monocot
lineages including recurrent cycles of genome duplication
followed by diploidization. This phenomenon was also
identified by [58] in their analysis of differential gene loss
following duplication events in rice and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analyses of gene sets including the genes on Musa BAC MA4_25J11, rice orthologs
and related genes found in the Arabidopsis genome and
TIGR gene indices corroborate previous results suggesting
that a genome-wide duplication in the common ancestor
of all major cereal lineages is responsible for the large
duplicated segments observed in the rice genome
[61,62,87]. This finding illustrates how comparative analyses of distantly-related monocot species can complement
studies on cereal genomes.
Is rice a good model to study the structure and evolution of
Musa genomes?
The use of rice as a reference species to accelerate mapbased cloning projects by extrapolating marker position
data and increasing marker density in targeted regions has
a proven efficiency among cereal crops (e.g. barley, wheat,
Sorghum), with a perceivable trend towards decreased efficiency when phylogenetic distance increases. Our analyses of the amount of microsynteny between rice and Musa
suggest that there are cases in which predictions based
upon microsynteny are useful but also this may not be
general. In addition although our data showed that Musa
genome is more similar to grain genomes relative to
onion, asparagus and the basal monocot, Acorus, the differences observed confirmed that cereal genomes are not
representative of all monocots [52,53,76,77]. This work
also highlight that comparative analyses between distantly-related species such as rice and Musa are very
important to improve our understanding of monocot
genomes and more generally of angiosperms genome evolution.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study represents the first effort to
investigate the existence and extent of microsynteny
between rice and Musa, two-distantly related monocot

the rice and species outside of the grass family. In addition, we identified evidence for an extensive microsynteny between the two Musa species representing the
progenitors of most cultivated genotypes. In addition, we
identified evidences for an ancient genome-scale duplication event in the lineage leading to Musa and highlighted
the complexity of analyzing the structure and evolution of
plant genomes following independent cycles of genome
duplication and diploidization.

Pharmacia Biotech) on Applied Biosystems 377 sequencers at EMBRAPA and UCB. Sequences were assembled
using TIGR assembler and additional directed sequencing
reactions performed as necessary to complete the
sequence to high quality. BAC shotgun sequencing from
NIAS were performed using shotgun (2 kb and 5–7 kb)
clones of 10x coverage and Big Dye Terminator Kit (ABI)
on ABI 3700 sequencers, assembled with Phred/phrap
software [90,91], and contig gaps were filled if necessary.

Methods

Sequence annotation
Annotation of the BAC assemblies was carried out using
the TIGR annotation pipeline, a collection of software
known as Eukaryotic Genome Control (EGC) that serves
as the central data management system. Each BAC
sequence was processed through a series of algorithms for
predicting genes (Genscan+, Genemark.hmm, Glimmer)
[92-94], splice sites [95,96] and tRNAs [97]. The AAT
package [98] was used for homology search against nucleotide and protein databases, that include plant-specific
cDNA and EST sequences, TIGR plant gene indices [99], a
non-redundant amino acid database filtered from public
sources, and SwissProt [100]. Protein models generated
by the searches and predictions are further searched
against Markov model (HMM) databases, including
PFAM [101], and automatically assigned a putative name
based on domain hits or homology to previously identified proteins. Gene structures and names were manually
inspected and refined as necessary. Annotated gene models were scanned for Musa transposable element nucleotide sequences downloaded from GenBank and then
compared to a curated database of transposable elementencoded proteins [102]. The top match from each hit was
used to classify the transposable element.

Selection of Musa BAC clones
Nine probes known from previous data to be conserved
between rice, Musa acuminata cv. Madang, Musa balbisiana
cv. PKW and Arabidopsis and revealing single or very low
copy number locus were selected. These nine probes
(SbRPG) correspond to Sorghum cDNA developed by Rustica Prograin Génétique and CIRAD [88]. These cDNAs
and two Musa genomic probes CIR257 and CIR560 [20]
were used to screen high density filters of the M. acuminata
Calcutta-4 BAC library [25] according to standard protocols [89](see Table 1). The probes CIR257 and CIR560
were also used to screen M. balbisiana cv. PKW BAC library
[26]. BAC DNA of positive clones was isolated using a
Qiagen Robot 9600 and Qiagen 96-well BAC DNA isolation kit and digested with the restriction enzyme HindIII.
The HindIII fingerprints were then hybridized with the
corresponding probe to determine the number of loci.
BAC-FISH analysis
Chromosome preparations were made as described in
D'Hont et al [14] from root tips of M. acuminata cv. Calcutta-4 cultivated in glasshouse. Fluorescent in situ hybridizations (FISH) were performed as described in D'Hont et
al [14], with 30 ng of BAC DNA labeled with digoxigenin
or biotin as probes and 50 ng/μl of sheared salmon sperm
DNA. The chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI
(4'.6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).
BAC sequencing
Selected BAC clones were sequenced by similar shotgun
approaches at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR),
Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPACENARGEN), Universidade Catolica de Brasilia (UCB)
and National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS).
At TIGR, purified BAC DNA was sheared by nebulization,
size-selected (2–3 kb) and ligated into a pUC-derived vector, pHOS1, using BstXI linkers. BAC DNA sent for
sequencing to EMBRAPA and UCB was fragmented at
Genoscope Centre (Evry, Paris, France) using a hydroshearer, size-selected (5 kb) and ligated into pcDNA2.1
vector using BstXI linkers. Clones were sequenced from
both ends using ABI Big Dye terminator chemistry on ABI
3730 sequencing machines at TIGR and using a
DYEnamicTM ET Terminator Sequencing Kit (Amersham

Comparison of BACs with one another
In order to determine whether the BACs selected by
hybridization actually arose from duplicated regions of
the M. acuminata (A) genome or homeologous regions of
the M. balbisiana (B) genome, or to identify duplicated
regions in the M. acuminata (A) genome (pairs of BACs
hybridizing with the same probes), each BAC was compared against all other BACs using MUMmer [103]; Dotter
[104]; [105] and an all-by-all BLASTP search [106]. The
sequence identity of the overlapping sequences between
BACs: MA4_82I11 and MBP_81C12 or MA4_54N7 and
MBP_91N22, was computed with Stretcher from the
EMBOSS package [107].
Synteny search
The 443 Musa predicted proteins were aligned against the
rice and Arabidopsis proteomes using the BLASTP program (e-value < 1e-10) [108]. The i-ADHoRe software
[56] which looks for regions where the gene order is similar between two genomic sequences was used with the

following parameters: a gap size and a cluster gap of 4040, a q value of 0.9, three anchor points and a probability
cutoff of 0.001. For four BACs (MA4_25J11, MA4_8L21,
MBP_91N22 and MuH9), we tried to extend the regions
of synteny between Musa and rice found by i-ADHoRe by
conducting reciprocal BLASTP searches between the genes
corresponding on the homologous regions.
Phylogenetic analyses
Musa genes were used in BLASTX searches to query a database of rice and Arabidopsis gene family clusters [109].
Translated blast searches (tBLASTX) against the TIGR
plant gene indices [110] were also performed and inferred
protein sequences with e-values < 1e-30 were compiled
with homologous Musa, rice and Arabidopsis sequences.
Amino acid alignments of the compiled sequences were
constructed using MUSCLE [111] and manually adjusted.
Parsimony analyses were performed on the amino acid
alignments using PAUP* v4.0b10 [112].
Contruction of unigenes
Musa EST sequences were provided by the Global Musa
Genomics Consortium [113]. These sequences were first
assembled into unigenes using the TGICL package [114]
to eliminate sequence redundancy. Because unigenes are
derived from EST sequences and so have no annotated
open reading frames and may contain frameshift sequencing errors, the following approach was taken. Each unigene was aligned against the rice proteome (downloaded
from GenBank) using BLASTX. The best match was considered significant if the alignment length was >100
amino acids and the Expect value (E) was <1e-15. The
open reading frame was then extracted from the unigene
sequence using the Genewise program (which can infer
frameshift sites; [115] with the corresponding best match
protein as a guide.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/58

sequence from a pair of paralogs showing no synonymous
substitutions (Ks = 0) as well as all Ks values involving this
sequence to avoid the inclusion of redundant entries of
the same gene in the analysis (see [64] for further details).
A gene family of n members results from n-1 gene duplication events. However, the number of possible pairwise
comparisons within a gene family (n × (n-1)/2) can be
substantially larger than the number of gene duplications,
which results in multiple estimates of the ages of some
duplications. To eliminate the redundant Ks values, pairs
of duplicated sequences were grouped into gene families
using a single linkage clustering method. Then we used
the hierarchical clustering method described in [64] to
reconstruct the approximated phylogeny of each gene
family: (1) Initially, all sequences in the family were
treated as a separate clusters. (2) Then, the Ks values for all
possible pairs of clusters were compared. (3) The pair of
clusters having the smallest Ks value was replaced by a single new cluster containing all their sequences. (4) The
median Ks value was chosen to represent the duplication
event that gave rise to the two merged clusters. (5) Steps 2
to 4 were repeated until all sequences were contained in a
single cluster. When two clusters A and B contained more
than one sequence, their associated Ks value in step 2 corresponded to the median Ks obtained for all possible pairs
of any sequence from A and any sequence from B.

Estimation of the level of synonymous substitution
between two sequences
For each pair of coding sequence, the two translation
products were aligned using the MUSCLE program [111]
and the resulting alignment was used as a guide to align
the nucleotide sequences. After removing gaps and N-containing codons, the level of synonymous substitution (Ks)
was estimated using the maximum likelihood method
implemented in CODEML [116] under the F3x4 model
[117].
Distribution of the age of duplication of Musa genes
All-against-all nucleotide sequence similarity searches
were done among the open reading frame extracted from
the unigene sequences using BLASTN [106]. Sequences
aligned over >300 bp and showing at least 40% identity
were defined as pairs of paralogs. Then we estimated Ks for
each pair of paralogs. We systematically discarded one
