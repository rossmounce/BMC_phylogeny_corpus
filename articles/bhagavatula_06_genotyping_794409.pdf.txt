Abstract
Background: Bengal tiger Panthera tigris tigris the National Animal of India, is an endangered
species. Estimating populations for such species is the main objective for designing conservation
measures and for evaluating those that are already in place. Due to the tiger's cryptic and secretive
behaviour, it is not possible to enumerate and monitor its populations through direct observations;
instead indirect methods have always been used for studying tigers in the wild. DNA methods based
on non-invasive sampling have not been attempted so far for tiger population studies in India. We
describe here a pilot study using DNA extracted from faecal samples of tigers for the purpose of
population estimation.
Results: In this study, PCR primers were developed based on tiger-specific variations in the
mitochondrial cytochrome b for reliably identifying tiger faecal samples from those of sympatric
carnivores. Microsatellite markers were developed for the identification of individual tigers with a
sibling Probability of Identity of 0.005 that can distinguish even closely related individuals with 99.9%
certainty. The effectiveness of using field-collected tiger faecal samples for DNA analysis was
evaluated by sampling, identification and subsequently genotyping samples from two protected
areas in southern India.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using tiger faecal matter as a potential
source of DNA for population estimation of tigers in protected areas in India in addition to the
methods currently in use.

Background
The Bengal tiger or Panthera tigris tigris, the National Animal of India, is an endangered animal. Though tiger populations were high at the turn of the last century, their
numbers have reduced drastically due to hunting/poaching as well as human activities that have resulted in habitat fragmentation and prey depletion [1]. Reliable
estimates of tiger populations are essential for designing
conservation planning protocols as well as assessing the
management plans already in place.

Estimates of tiger numbers, though the figures are controversial, were supposed to be around 4500 in May 1998,
spread out all over the Indian-Subcontinent in protected
areas [2]. Controversies about tiger numbers have arisen
due to the methodology being followed for population
estimation. Tigers are territorial, elusive, cryptic and nocturnal animals. The territory of a male is about 25–30 sq
kms and it may overlap the territory of several females,
which generally have smaller territories of around 10–15
sq kms [3]. Due to their elusive nature, it is not possible

to carry out a direct enumeration of tigers. Therefore, indirect methods are the only means of enumerating tigers.

for ascertaining the method best suited for Indian field
conditions.

The most commonly used method, 'the pugmark
method', has been in use for more than two decades now
and attempts at ascertaining the total count of tigers in a
protected area. It is based on the assumption that tiger
pawprints are unique to individuals [4] and that tracks
can be found for all the tigers and recorded at the same
time. Annually, the tigers in protected areas in India are
'censused' by Forest Officials by this method. However,
several drawbacks of this method have been pointed out
and its veracity questioned by tiger researchers. (See [3]
for a critique of this method). The other method is the
camera-trap technique, which is based on the assumption
that stripe patterns on tigers are individual-specific [5].
Camera-trapping techniques have been used for identifying individual tigers [6]. This method has been used for
estimating tiger abundance and density in the conceptual
framework of the mark-recapture statistics and has been
employed in providing estimates of tiger populations in
many protected areas in India and elsewhere [7-9]. However, this method works best only in areas where tigers are
in high density; it can sample tigers only in a few predetermined locations where camera traps are set, and cannot be
used in difficult terrains.

The Probability of Identity, P(ID), is the power of the
molecular markers to resolve between different individuals drawn at random from a population [16,19]. Microsatellite markers are the markers of choice in all studies
where individual identification is attempted using the
non-invasive method of obtaining DNA [20-23]. However, if in a population there are closely related individuals genetic profiles may look similar even in different
individuals, especially if less number of genetic markers
are used. This is called the 'shadow effect' [24]. Therefore,
it is important to screen for markers with a low enough
P(ID) in order to resolve siblings and other close relatives
in a population. Microsatellite markers with a low probability of P(ID) for reliable individual identification were
developed and screened.

Non-invasive methods of collection of biological samples, such as faecal samples or hair samples, have been
successfully employed for population estimation of animals like Brush-tailed rock-wallaby [10], Coyotes [11],
Forest elephants [12], European Badgers [13], wolves [14]
and grizzly bears [15] with genetic profiles generated
using multilocus microsatellite loci unique to individual
animals. However, the use of faecal samples as a source of
DNA for genotyping has not been attempted for estimating wild tiger populations.
Tigers deposit scats or leave scent marking or scrapes on
the soil to demarcate their territories [5]. Therefore, faecal
matter of tigers would be the most easily obtainable
source of DNA for non-invasive studies of tigers. Taberlet
and Luikart [16] have recommended that any study
requiring a non-invasive genetic method should be preceded by a pilot study to assess the Probability of Identity,
P(ID), as well as the feasibility and reliability of the
method before embarking on a large scale study. In addition, the pilot study should demonstrate the error rates
and the difficulties like allelic dropouts and false amplifications that can be encountered during the process of genotyping DNA from non-invasive sources [16,17].
Quantity and quality of template DNA is the limiting factor from non-invasive sources [18]. We, therefore compared sample preservation and DNA extraction methods

Our pilot study was carried out on faecal samples collected from the field to check whether it was possible to
carry out faecal sample genotyping in actual field conditions. Identification of the error rate on faecal samples collected from field was evaluated in order to demonstrate
the use of DNA extracted from such samples for large-scale
genetic studies of tiger using faecal DNA. For this purpose,
tiger faecal samples were collected randomly with the help
of trackers of the Forest Department from Mudumalai and
Biligiri Rangan Temple (BRT) Wildlife Sanctuaries. Samples collected thus can reveal the minimum number of
tigers living in the protected area of study at the time of
collection. In addition to this, we have also standardized
a PCR-based species and sex identification method.
Therefore, the main aim of our pilot study was to optimize protocols to obtain genetic profiles for individually
identifying tigers from faecal samples and to demonstrate
whether DNA from such a non-invasive source can be
used for estimating tiger populations in the wild in India.

Results
Faecal sample preservation and DNA extraction
There was no significant difference in DNA extraction and
subsequent PCR amplifications between the two sample
preservation trials, namely storage desiccant silica and
90% ethanol (p > 0.05, two tailed t-test).

38% extracts from the Chelex-100 method of DNA extraction from faecal samples [25]; 75% from the Digest
Buffer/Phenol Chloroform method [26,27]; 25% from
the Lysis buffer/column purification method [28]; 88%
extracts from Guanidinium thiocyanate-silica method
[26]; and 100% extracts from Qiagen Stool DNA extraction kit could be PCR amplified with mitochondrial cytochrome b primers that target a 146 bp fragment [29].

Because less than 50% of the PCRs were positive with the
Chelex-100 and Lysis buffer/column purification methods, they were not analyzed further. Extracts from the
Digest Buffer/Phenol Chloroform, Guanidinium thiocyanate-silica, and Qiagen Stool DNA extraction kit methods were amplified with five microsatellite primers,
namely E21, E7, D10, D15 and Fca304. There was no significant difference in PCR amplifications of microsatellite
markers among these three extraction methods. (q > 0.05,
Nemenyi's test).
Molecular identification of faecal samples as tiger in origin
Primers TIF/TIR were designed based on tiger-specific variations in the tiger mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Two
unique tiger-specific bases were detected namely a guanine at positions 636 and a thymine at position 759 (Figure 1). Primers were designed with these bases at the 3'ends which amplify a 162 bp fragment in an in silico PCR.
Validation of these primers on a panel of DNA samples of
different animals shows that they amplify only tiger DNA
and not of other species tested (Figure 2).

Two out of eight carnivore scat samples collected from
Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR) were positive for PCR with TIF/TIR. Sequences of these amplicons
clustered with Panthera tigris in an NJ tree constructed
with MEGA, showing further that these samples are tiger
in origin (Figure 3).
Polymorphic microsatellite markers and Probability of
Identity
A total of ten microsatellite markers screened were polymorphic (Table 1). Mean Polymorphism Information
Content (PIC) was 0.68. Average number of alleles per
locus was 6.4. Except loci Fca139 and D15 no linkage disequilibrium was detected for the other possible combination of loci after Bonferroni correction. Significant
deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was detected
for loci D15, C34, 6HDZ003 and Fca139.

Loci E21, E6, D10, Fca43, E7 and Fca304 were used for
genotyping as they amplify fragments lesser than 200 bp
and have expected heterozygosity of 0.6 or more. Plot of
different relationship scenarios with the P(ID) values
shows that the value increases for a population scenario
that comprises of high proportion of siblings (Figure 4).
Plot of observed and sibling P(ID) values show that the six
microsatellite markers have a sibling P(ID) of 0.005, i.e.,
these markers can distinguish with 99.9 % probability
even siblings (Figure 5).
Genotyping of faecal samples
The captive tiger reference genotypes and the faecal genotypes are compared manually (Table 2). There is one case
of spurious amplification at locus E7 (Roger/Scat1),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/48

which is a 3.3% error rate for all the consensus genotypes
generated.
Of the 48 samples that were collected from Mudumalai
and BRT Wildlife Sanctuaries, DNA could be extracted
from 40 samples (83%) as was confirmed by amplification with 146 bp cytochrome b primers [29]. Of these, 28
samples (70%) were positive for tiger as noted by the presence of amplicons with the mitochondrial tiger-specific
PCR. Of the samples that were positive for tiger, microsatellite DNA could be amplified from 17 samples (60%),
which include partial as well as complete profiles. Complete genotype profiles could be obtained for 10 samples
(58%) and partial profiles for 7 samples (41.1%). When
partial profiles were obtained, they were matched and
grouped with the complete profiles only if they matched
at least at four of the most informative loci namely D10,
Fca43, Fca304 and E21B (in that order). Partial profiles
that did not match at these loci with complete profiles
were excluded from the analysis. The subsequent analysis
was performed only with those loci for which consensus
genotypes were obtained.
The total number of positive PCRs to obtain the 93 consensus genotypes of Mudumalai and BRT Sanctuaries,
using the Comparative Multiple Tubes (CMT) approach,
for both complete as well as partial profiles was 378, i.e.,
an average of 4 PCR reactions. Analysis of the genotypes
obtained from Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary (Table 3)
showed that profiles of samples M3 and M6 completely
match each other. Sample M7, though a partial profile did
not match at any of the three most informative loci
namely D10, Fca43 and Fca304 with the consensus genotypes of the rest of the genotypes and was therefore considered as a new genotype. Ten samples had to be
excluded from the grouping, as all the three informative
loci did not amplify. Amongst the BRT Wildlife Sanctuary
samples, partial profiles of samples BN11 and BN12 were
grouped together as were the partial profiles of samples
BN14 and BN15 on the basis of the three most informative loci. Among the Mudumalai and BRT genotypes we
identified 13 unique profiles (Mudumalai = 6; BRT = 7)
that are presumably from 13 individual tigers.
Dropout rate in faecal genotypes generated from the fieldcollected samples was considerably higher than that from
the zoological park samples (Table 4). All the faecal samples collected from the captive tigers amplified (100%).
Captive tiger DNA samples of known sex were PCR-amplified with the zinc-finger and amelogenein primers [30].
With the zinc-finger PCR two amplicons of 164 and 161
bp were obtained for male tigers and one amplicon of 164
bp was obtained for females. Similarly, for the amelogenin PCR, two amplicons of 216 and 194 bp were

though the PCR products were loaded onto a gel together.

Mudumalai faecal samples number M10 and BRT Sanctuary sample BN6 and BN15 gave two PCR products with
both the zinc-finger and the amelogenin PCR with sizes
corresponding to male tiger. Non-specific bands of sizes
corresponding to 202 base pairs were obtained in samples
BN4, BN6 and M3, which may have been obtained from
prey DNA that would have co-purified with faecal DNA.

(23.5%) i.e., on samples BN11, BN12, BN14 and M32.

Discussion
Traditionally, faecal matter of tigers has been used to
study the food habits of tigers and their sympatric carnivores. As they are more readily obtainable than hair, faecal

Thus, in all the five DNA extraction methods that were
evaluated here, the surface of the faecal sample was
washed with the initial Lysis buffers. Three methods,
namely the Digest Buffer/Phenol-Chloroform method,
Guanidinium thiocyanate-silica method and Qiagen
Stool DNA extraction kit showed PCR amplification with
no significant difference. Guanidinium thiocyante-silica
was followed for all our extractions.
We used PCR amplification to evaluate the best methods
for storing the faecal samples after collection. Both the
storage methods tested, namely alcohol as well as silica
beads, have worked well in terms of PCR amplification
ability and can be used to preserve faecal samples of carnivores. This was not tested exclusively in the faecal samples of tiger as we collected samples of tiger as well as its
sympatric carnivores, leopard and wild dog. The faecal
samples collected at NSTR were also used in scat identification trials discussed next.

samples were chosen as the non-invasive source for
obtaining DNA for our study. DNA quantity and quality
by different extraction trials was evaluated. The DNA
extracted from faecal samples originates from the colorectal epithelial mucous on the surface of the sample. Also it
appears that the DNA that is extracted from the surface of
the sample has less of PCR inhibitory substances and possibly less admixture with undigested prey remains [31].

It is essential to reliably identify the faecal samples of tiger
from those of their sympatric carnivores like leopards and
wild dog. Most studies on diets and occupancy of the two
felids, namely the tiger and the leopard, are based on faecal samples [32,33], which are identified on the basis of
morphological features [34] and associated behavioral
signs like scrape marks, the absence of which makes it difficult to identify the samples. Therefore, molecular analysis that makes use of tiger-specific mitochondrial
variations for distinguishing the tiger faecal samples from
those of sympatric carnivores was developed and used to
screen out tiger samples.
According to Davison et al [35], sometimes even trained
trackers have misidentified the faecal samples of similar

Mudumalai and BRT Wildlife Sanctuaries, only 70% of all
the samples that were collected as supposed tiger faecal
samples were actually of tiger origin. False negatives may
occur in the tiger-specific PCR generated as a result of
interspecific polymorphisms at the variable sites that were
used in primer design. We ruled this out by PCR amplifying DNA of 25 tigers and 10 leopards DNA (data not

easier to amplify [36]. Hence they were chosen for our

number of loci required to reliably distinguish even
closely related individuals. The set of primers used in this
study are sufficient to distinguish a population comprising even of several siblings (Figure 4). For individual identification in population estimation studies using mark-

Zn and AML are the zinc-finger and amelogenin PCRs that were used for sex identification of the tiger scat samples. 'H' indicates that the locus was
scored as a half-locus because one additional allele was scored in one of the five amplifications to obtain consensus. Dashed lines indicate that
enough PCRs could not be amplified for obtaining consensus genotypes. NA indicates that PCR amplification could not be obtained.

recapture models, P(ID) value is recommended to be
approximately 0.01 [19] in order to distinguish closely
related individuals with 99% certainty. Using microsatellite loci with high heterozygosity reduces the number of
loci required to reach a low P(ID) value. The P(ID)sibs for
the six loci used by us is 0.005 and can be used to distinguish even closely related individuals. Therefore they can
also be used in studies requiring individual identification
for population estimation. Further, these loci are in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and not in linkage disequilibrium – an essential assumption required in calculating
P(ID) where loci are expected to be independent. In our
study, the observed P(ID) for the three most informative
loci is zero. The P(ID) value calculated in our study was
with captive tigers which may be inbred. It is therefore

possible that the number of loci required to distinguish
individuals can stand valid even in those wild tiger populations that may comprise of many related tigers.
The Comparative Multiple Tubes [22] approach was used
to derive consensus genotypes for faecal DNA extracts.
Reference genotype profiles were generated from blood
DNA of known captive tigers that were compared with
genotypes generated from faecal samples of the same animals (Table 2). Though there is one erroneous genotype,
which might be an amplification artifact at one locus
('Roger', Locus E7, Scat1), the profiles generated from the
captive samples were assigned with the corresponding reference profiles on the basis of three of the most informative loci, namely D10, Fca304 and E21B.

In order to evaluate whether faecal samples collected from
the jungles could be used for genotyping and to demonstrate the error rates in the genotypes generated from such
samples, a preliminary study was performed on faecal
samples collected from Mudumalai and BRT Wildlife
Sanctuaries. It is generally believed that the length of time
between deposition of samples and collection and extraction may have some influence on the DNA quantity [37].
This is evident as the faecal samples collected from captive
tigers were amplified (microsatellite loci) with 100% success as against the 60% amplification success with faecal
samples from the field. Also the rate of errors generated
from captive animal faecal samples is considerably lower
than the errors generated from faecal samples collected
from the jungle. This could be because the DNA from faecal samples of the captive animals was extracted on the
day of collection. The error rate encountered by us for faecal samples collected from the field was in the same range
as has been reported by others, i.e., 46–66% [20,23],
though others have reported a much higher amplification
success rate – 87% [22] and 93–95% [38].
As faecal samples were collected wherever encountered
from all over the two protected areas, the number of genotype profiles generated thus can provide an estimate of
the minimum number of tigers living in that area during
that particular sampling session. Partial genotype profiles
were grouped together with those samples where complete genotypes could be obtained. This kind of assignment could lead to an underestimation, but not an
overestimation of animal numbers.
Sex identification of faecal samples can reveal the sex ratio
of tigers, as well as territory occupancy by male and female
tigers in a habitat. PCR primers that have been developed
for several New World felids [30] and which target the
zinc-finger region and amelogenein gene on the X and Ychromosome were used for sexing faecal samples. We
tested these primers on known captive female and male
tiger DNA samples extracted from blood before using
them on faecal DNA extracts.

This pilot study demonstrates the use of faecal samples of
tigers collected in the field as a source of DNA and the possibility of conducting population estimation wherein
matching genotypes are considered to arise from the same
individual. The genotype data generated thus could be
analysed by mark-recapture analysis [39] with appropriate
models.

Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of
using non-invasive genetics as one of the methods for
monitoring as well as estimating tiger populations in protected areas. However it is our contention that population
studies of a cryptic species like tiger should be carried out
using more than one method, with the genetics component playing a predominant role, in monitoring and estimation of tiger populations for conservation planning
and management.

Methods
Sample collection
For DNA extraction trials, fresh faecal samples (n = 10)
were collected from captive tigers, housed at the Nehru
Zoological Park, Hyderabad, India. For faecal sample
preservation and wild tiger faecal sample identification
trials, carnivore scats (n = 8) were collected from the
NSTR, Andhra Pradesh during the Tiger Census conducted
by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department in January
2001. Each sample was divided into two portions and preserved separately in 90% ethanol and silica gel pouches
contained in 50 ml screw-cap tubes and kept at room temperature (Average air temperatures were 37°–40°C at the
time of collection) and transported to the laboratory
where DNA was extracted within a week of receiving the
samples. DNA samples of different animals for validation
of the tiger-specific PCR primers were obtained from the
'DNA Bank' at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), India.

DNA extracted from blood samples of captive tigers (n =
21) from different zoological parks of India (Bhu-

baneshwar Zoological Park, Orissa; Nehru Zoological
Park, Hyderabad, Alipore Zoological Park, Calcutta; Bannerghatta Biological Park, Bangalore; Shimoga Zoo, Shimoga) available at the 'DNA Bank' of CCMB were used for
polymorphism study and calculations of P(ID).
To test for genotype reliability, faecal samples (n = 3) were
collected from two tigers, namely 'Tina' (female) and
'Roger' (male) for which blood DNA was available.
In order to assess actual genotyping error rates for the field
study, faecal samples were collected from Mudumalai
Wildlife Sanctuary (n = 34) Tamil Nadu and Biligiri Rangan Temple (BRT) Wildlife Sanctuary (n = 15) in May
2003 and May 2005, respectively. Samples were collected
with the help of trackers of the local Forest Department
along animal trails and tracks. GPS locations of the samples were taken and plotted on toposheets (not shown).

cus muntjac [GenBank: AY225986], wild pig Sus scrofa
[GenBank: AY237529], hog deer Axis porcinus [GenBank:
AY035874], Indian bison Bos gaurus [GenBank:
AF348593], spotted deer Cervus axis [GenBank:
AY182236], domestic goat Capra hircus [GenBank:
AB110595], domestic buffalo Bubalis bubalus [GenBank:
D82894] were downloaded. All the sequences were
aligned in ClustalX 1.8 with Panthera tigris tigris [GenBank: AF 053018] as the reference sequence, to identify
nucleotides that were found exclusively in tiger but not in
the other species. ARMS (Amplification Refractory Mutation System) PCR primers were designed such that the 3'
ends of the forward and reverse primers were on bases
specifically found in tiger and not in sympatric carnivores
or prey animals. The primer sequences are:
TIF: 5'-ATAAAAAATCAGGAATGGTG-3'
TIR: 5'-TGGCGGGGATGTAGTTATCA-3'

Faecal sample preservation
DNA from carnivore faecal samples of NSTR stored in
storage desiccant silica or 90% ethanol was extracted by
the Guanidinium-thiocyanate method, PCR-amplified
with cyotchrome b primers. Positive PCRs were scored as
1 and non-amplification was scored as 0. The difference
between the two preservation methods was checked with
two-tailed t-test in Excel.
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from the faecal samples collected from
captive tigers by the following five methods: The Chelex100 method [25]; the Digest Buffer/Phenol Chloroform
method [26,27]; the Lysis buffer/column purification
method [28]; Guanidinium thiocyanate-silica method as
modified by Reed et al [26] and Qiagen Stool DNA extraction kit. PCR amplification of all the extracts was carried
out first with mitochondrial cytochrome b PCR primers,
following which extracts from buffer/column purification, Guanidinium thiocyanate-silica and Qiagen Stool
DNA extraction kit methods were amplified with the microsatellite markers developed and described later. The
presence of bands was scored as 1 and the absence as 0.
Non-parametric Tukey-type multiple comparison
(Nemenyi test) was performed to look for difference
between the three extraction methods.
Molecular identification of faecal samples
A PCR-based assay was developed to reliably identify the
faecal samples of tigers from those of other sympatric carnivores, especially leopards. Mitochondrial cytochrome b
sequences of the Bengal tiger,Panthera tigris tigris [GenBank: AF053019–AF053025], its sympatric carnivore
leopard, Panthera pardus [GenBank: AY005809] and some
of the animals preyed upon by tiger namely sambhar Cervus unicolor [GenBank: AF423201], barking deer Muntia-

Initially these primers were tested by in silico PCR on GenBank sequences with the Amplify 1.2 software (Engels B,
Department of Genetics, University of Wisconsin, Madison WI 5706) following which they were PCR amplified
with DNA samples of some animals namely, Bengal tiger
(Panthera tigris tigris), Siberian tiger (P.t.altica), leopard (P.
pardus), lion (P. leo), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa),
domestic dog (Canis familiaris), wild dog (Cuon alpinus),
wolf (Canis lupus), jackal (Canis aureus), goat (Capra hircus), wild pig (Sus scrofa), Indian bison (Bos gaurus), Spotted Deer (Cervus axis), Sambar (C. unicolor) and human
(Homo sapiens).
For identifying the faecal samples collected from the wild,
DNA extracted from samples collected from the NSTR
were PCR-amplified with TIF/TIR primers. Positive amplicons were sequenced on an ABI 3730 Automated DNA
Sequencer. Sequences obtained were aligned using ClustalX 1.2 with GenBank sequences of a reference tiger
(AF053019), some prey animal species of tiger and leopard, the sympatric felid. GENEDOC software was used for
formatting the sequences. A phylogeny analysis of aligned
sequences was done with MEGA v3.1 software [40]. NJ
tree was constructed with the sequences using Interior
Branch Test of Phylogeny with default values for the
number of replicates.
Development of polymorphic microsatellite markers
A small insert partial genomic library was developed in
pMOSblue Blunt-ended cloning vector from DNA of a captive tiger housed at the Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, by methods described elsewhere [41,42]. Twentythree microsatellite repeat containing clones were
sequenced on an ABI 3700 Automated DNA sequencer
and 15 microsatellite-containing clones were used to

design primers from the region flanking the microsatellite
repeat using the software Genetool. Forward primers
(BioServe Biotechnologies, India) were labelled at their 5'end with FAM or HEX fluorescent label. Microsatellite
primers were screened for polymorphism on DNA samples of captive tigers (n = 21). Microsatellite primers
6HDZ003 and 6HDZ007 developed for Sumatran tiger
[43] and Domestic cat primers Fca45, Fca90 [44], Fca212,
Fca310, Fca304, Fca43 and Fca139 [45], were also
screened to look for polymorphic markers.
The software CERVUS was used to calculate Polymorphism Information Content (PIC). ARLEQUIN software
was used to calculate expected (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as well as, linkage disequilibrium between the loci.
Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for Type II
errors.
Probability of Identity, P(ID)
Probability of Identity, P(ID), was calculated for six loci
namely E7, E21B, E6, D10, Fca304 and Fca43. A population may comprise of closely related individuals other
than just siblings, like half-siblings or parent-offspring,
etc. Different relationship scenarios were included in the
calculation of the expected and observed P(ID) values
with API-CALC software [46]. Observed P(ID) was calculated with the software API-CALC and siblings P(ID) with
software GIMLET v1.3.3 [47] for the captive tigers genotype data (n = 21). The Observed and the Sibling P(ID) of
the locus with the highest heterozygosity was taken first
and the cumulative probability of the rest of the loci calculated as the product of the probabilities of the next most
heterozygous locus and so on.
PCR amplifications
For identifying the best method of DNA extraction and
comparing the two preservation methods, PCR amplifications were carried out with mitochondrial cytochrome b
primers targeting a 146 bp fragment of DNA [29].

For identifying tiger faecal samples PCR amplifications
with tiger-specific cytochrome b primers TIF/TIR was carried out in 25 μl reactions with the following final concentration: 1× PCR Buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 mM
MgCl2 (Applied Biosystems), 0.15 mM dNTPs, 1× BSA
(New England Biolabs), 1U AmpliTaqGold, 5 μl each of
primers TIF and TIR and 3 μl template DNA. PCR reactions were carried out in MJ Research PTC-200 Thermal
Cycler with the following conditions: 95°C for 10 mins,
40 cycles of 95°C for 45 secs, 59°C for 30 secs (Ramp: 0.5
Deg/Sec), 72°C for 30 secs, followed by a final extension
of 72°C for 10 mins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/48

All microsatellite PCR reactions were carried out in 15 μl
reactions: 1XPCR Buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 mM
MgCl2 (Applied Biosystem), 1× BSA (New England
Biolabs), 0.15 mM dNTP (Applied Biosystems), 1 Unit of
AmpliTaqGold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 5
picomoles of the forward and reverse primers each and 10
ng of template DNA. Tm values of the primers are listed in
Table 1.
All genotyping reactions were carried out on an ABI 3730
Automated DNA sequencer with ROX-500 size standard
(Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on Genemapper v3.7
software (Applied Biosystem).
Genotyping faecal samples
For genotyping DNA from faecal samples, the Comparative Multiple Tubes (CMT) approach [22] was used. For
testing reliability of genotypes, reference genotypes generated at loci E21B, E6, E7, D10 and Fca304 from blood
DNA of two captive tigers were compared to genotypes
from faecal DNA extracts from both the animals.

DNA was extracted from all the faecal samples collected
from Mudumalai and BRT Wildlife Sanctuaries. All
extracts were tested for the presence of good quality DNA
with cytochrome b primers [29] followed by PCR amplification with tiger-specific cytochrome b primers. Tiger positive samples were analyzed further with the set of six
microsatellite primers. Samples for which complete profiles could not be obtained for all the loci were grouped
along with those samples for which complete genotypes
could be obtained on the basis of consensus genotype
match at least at three of the four most heterozygous loci
namely, D10, Fca43, Fca304 and E21B (in that order).
Consensus fingerprints were obtained by pairwise comparison of the genotypes [22]. Similar genotypes were
grouped together manually. Rates of allelic dropouts and
false amplifications from captive tiger samples and fieldcollected samples were computed with GIMLET 1.3.3 software [47] and compared. Mudumalai and BRT Sanctuary
faecal samples were PCR-amplified in duplicate with
FAM-labeled forward primers targeting zinc-finger region
and the amelogenin gene for sex identification, and products were sized on an ABI 3730 Automated DNA
sequencer and analyzed with the Genemapper software.
