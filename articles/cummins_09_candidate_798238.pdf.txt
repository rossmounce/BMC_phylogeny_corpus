Abstract
Background: Marine molluscs, as is the case with most aquatic animals, rely heavily on olfactory
cues for survival. In the mollusc Aplysia californica, mate-attraction is mediated by a blend of waterborne protein pheromones that are detected by sensory structures called rhinophores. The
expression of G protein and phospholipase C signaling molecules in this organ is consistent with
chemosensory detection being via a G-protein-coupled signaling mechanism.
Results: Here we show that novel multi-transmembrane proteins with similarity to rhodopsin Gprotein coupled receptors are expressed in sensory epithelia microdissected from the Aplysia
rhinophore. Analysis of the A. californica genome reveals that these are part of larger multigene
families that possess features found in metazoan chemosensory receptor families (that is, these
families chiefly consist of single exon genes that are clustered in the genome). Phylogenetic analyses
show that the novel Aplysia G-protein coupled receptor-like proteins represent three distinct
monophyletic subfamilies. Representatives of each subfamily are restricted to or differentially
expressed in the rhinophore and oral tentacles, suggesting that they encode functional
chemoreceptors and that these olfactory organs sense different chemicals. Those expressed in
rhinophores may sense water-borne pheromones. Secondary signaling component proteins Gαq,
Gαi, and Gαo are also expressed in the rhinophore sensory epithelium.
Conclusion: The novel rhodopsin G-protein coupled receptor-like gene subfamilies identified
here do not have closely related identifiable orthologs in other metazoans, suggesting that they
arose by a lineage-specific expansion as has been observed in chemosensory receptor families in
other bilaterians. These candidate chemosensory receptors are expressed and often restricted to
rhinophores and oral tentacles, lending support to the notion that water-borne chemical detection
in Aplysia involves species- or lineage-specific families of chemosensory receptors.

Background
All animals must recognize and respond to chemosensory
information in their environment. Although the marine
mollusc Aplysia has been a valuable model to investigate
the molecular basis of behavior [1,2] and reproduction
[3,4], our knowledge of how they recognize and respond
to environmental signals is limited. In particular, it is
unknown how they distinguish and bind water-soluble
molecules and transfer exogenous information intracellularly. In contrast, the molecular components and mechanisms of chemical detection in a range of vertebrates and
other invertebrates have been well studied.
Vertebrate chemoreception is made possible by six distinct classes of multi-transmembrane receptors: (i) olfactory receptors (ORs) [5], (ii) trace amine-associated
receptors [6], vomeronasal receptors (iii) type 1 and (iv)
type 2 [7,8] and taste receptors (v) type 1 and (vi) type 2
[9,10]. Besides binding chemical molecules, all share the
common traits of seven transmembrane (7-TM) domains,
G-protein signaling and precise sensory cell expression. In
mammals, non-volatile pheromone perception is thought
to act primarily through the vomeronasal organ sensory
epithelium [11] and be mediated intracellular via the
interaction of chemical molecules with vomeronasal
receptors located on the dendrites of vomeronasal sensory
neurons [12]. However, in teleost fishes who do not have
a vomeronasal organ, the vomeronasal receptors are
found in the main olfactory epithelium [13]. It appears
that genes involved in an animal's response to its environment are subject to extensive gene duplication, gene loss
and lineage-specific expansion over time, leading to large
gene families such as those observed in the OR and vomeronasal receptor repertoire. In fact, OR genes represent the
largest mammalian gene family [14].
Chemoreception through 7-TM domain receptors appears
to have evolved multiple times independently, as vertebrate chemoreceptors are not closely related to those
known in insects and nematodes. Recognition of external
chemicals in Drosophila is accomplished by families of
130 genes encoding 7-TM domain receptors [15,16],
including OR (60) and gustatory receptors (70). Gustatory receptors are greatly reduced in the honeybee [17].
Insect chemoreceptors do not belong to the G-protein
coupled receptor (GPCR) family due to a unique inverse
membrane topology [18]. Rather, they use an alternative,
non-G protein-based signaling pathway where receptors
not only detect chemicals but can also act as ion channels
[19]. In support of this, heterologous cells expressing silkmoth, fruitfly or mosquito heteromeric OR complexes
showed G-protein independent extracellular calcium
influx and cation-non-selective ion conductance upon
stimulation with odorant [19]. Nevertheless, chemical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/28

detection is still mediated by a large and divergent family
of 7-TM domain receptors.
A central issue that has not been adequately addressed is
how water-borne chemicals are detected at the molecular
level by the huge diversity of invertebrates that inhabit
marine environments. In marine invertebrates, chemosensory abilities are essential for almost all aspects of their
life, from feeding to predator avoidance and reproduction. A recent bioinformatic survey of the sea urchin
genome resulted in the identification of a remarkable
diversity of chemoreceptors, expressed specifically and
differentially in adult sensory structures [20]. Meanwhile,
there have been important findings forthcoming from
research into the molluscan group. Olfactory studies of
squid have shown that both phospholipase C (PLC) and
cAMP-mediated pathways may be involved in olfactory
sensory neurons activation [21]. In support of this, immunolocalization experiments revealed the presence of G
proteins involved in both cAMP (Gαo) and PLC (Gαq)
pathways which are clearly co-expressed in certain cell
types.
Aplysia possesses many advantages necessary for chemical
communication research, such as an extensive knowledge
of its anatomy, a detailed understanding of the molecular
and cellular basis of behavior, and now considerable
genomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) resources.
Moreover, we have found that in Aplysia, conspecific and
congener attraction is mediated by a remarkable cocktail
of water-borne protein pheromones [4,22]. In Aplysia,
freshly laid egg cordons are considered to be a source of
both water-borne and contact pheromones that attract
conspecifics and closely related species to the area and
induce them to mate and lay eggs. Egg laying results in the
release of at least four proteinaceous attraction pheromones, including the 58-residue attractin [4,23,24]. T-maze
bioassays have demonstrated that binary blends of attractin with either enticin, temptin or seductin are sufficient
to attract potential mates [23].
At the anatomical level, Aplysia chemosensory detection is
achieved by the rhinophore [25], specialized anterior sensory organs on the dorsal surface of the head. Rhinophore
are retractile and primarily used for distance chemoreception and rheoreception (response to water current),
whereas the oral tentacles, which are found more ventrally, are possibly involved in contact chemoreception
and mechanoreception [26]. The neuroanatomical organization of rhinophores includes a rhinophore groove
where most of the sensory cells appear to be concentrated.
Its sensory epithelium contains sensory neurons that
project axons back to rhinophore ganglia and dendrites
that end in either a surface-exposed cilium or a small protuberance [26-28]. Consistent with a potential role in

BMC Biology 2009, 7:28

chemical transduction, gene transcripts encoding G protein, PLC or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor were
found to be expressed in Aplysia rhinophore sensory epithelium [29]. The involvement of nitric oxide as a potential chemosensory processing component has also been
implicated in molluscan chemoreception based on cytological NADH-diaphorase histochemistry of the Aplysia
rhinophore [30]. Of significance, was the finding that
nitric oxide synthase is present in epithelial sensory-like
cells that had multiple apical ciliated processes exposed to
the environment. This is consistent with findings demonstrating that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase disrupts
slime trail following, suggesting a role for nitric oxide in
neural processing of stimuli in snails [31].
The presence of G protein mRNAs in Aplysia sensory epithelium suggested that multi-transmembrane GPCR-like
proteins could play an important role in chemosensory
detection. With the availability of a 2× genome coverage
for Aplysia californica, we expected that it would provide an
excellent and first opportunity to investigate the molecular basis of chemical detection in a mollusc. Here, we performed iterative Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) searches to identify genes similar to rhodopsin
GPCR genes encoding 7-TM domains from the A. californica genome. We identified genes representing three
unique monophyletic families that show rhinophore, oral
tentacle and ovotestis expression. Based on their expression, these may encode chemosensory proteins, including
pheromone and gustatory receptors. Antisera directed
against a conserved region of a candidate chemosensory
receptor, as well as Aplysia Gαq, Gαi, and Gαo, confirmed
their expression in sensory tissues, with localization to the
outer sensory epithelium.

Results
Identification of genes encoding rhodopsin G-protein
coupled receptor-like proteins in the Aplysia californica
genome
We performed iterative tBLASTn for closely related novel
genes and discovered a large number of genes encoding
rhodopsin GPCR-like proteins. Using this approach, we
successfully identified a total of 90 genes encoding proteins belonging to the GPCR superfamily. Of these, 72
were predicted to contain 7-TM domains. It was not possible to annotate the full-length sequence of all genes,
especially in the 5'-regions, and 18 genes encoding six
transmembrane domains were considered partial-length.
Note that these numbers are the minimal estimates,
because the genome sequencing of A. californica had not
been fully completed. We expect that further rhodopsin
GPCR-like genes will be found beyond the ones we have
identified. Also, several of the multi-transmembrane gene
models appeared to be pseudogenes with various defects,
including the insertion of stop codons and frame-shifting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/28

indels leading to premature termination of the coding
region. These were not included in the final data set.
Phylogenetic construction and analysis of identified
rhodopsin G-protein coupled receptor-like genes
We have performed phylogenetic analyses of the 90
selected rhodopsin GPCR-like genes (ingroup), together
with four non-Aplysia GPCR genes (outgroup). The 94
sequences (including outgroup taxa) comprised 264 to
444 characters. For the two phylogenetic analyses (with
and without outgroup, respectively) we had to restrict the
character sets to 96 and 166 alignable positions, respectively, in order to maintain the conservative approach.
Both phylogenetic reconstructions, with and without outgroup, display a congruent picture regarding the phylogenetic relationship of the Aplysia GPCRs (Figures 1a and
1b). Branch lengths of groups A (subfamily a) and B (subfamily b), especially in the former, are considerably
shorter than of group C (subfamily c). GPCR-like gene
group features are summarized in Additional file 1. The
phylogenetic analyses support a monophyly of the three
different subfamily groups, although sufficient phylogenetic signal for subfamily c monophyly is achievable only
when non-Aplysia taxa are not present.

Besides structural predictions that place these genes
within the 7-TM superfamily, which includes rhodopsin
GPCRs, these genes have little amino acid identity (<10%)
to any known genes, and do not appear in the published
Aplysia EST neuronal transcriptome [32]. They show only
distant similarity with known molluscan multi-transmembrane receptors, including well-characterized Aplysia
neurotransmitter GPCRs. GenBank tBLASTn searches also
reveal most amino acid identity with regions of orphan
GPCRs of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (E
value 1e-11), various ghrelin receptors (for example, Rattus norvegicus, E value 2e-07) and a candidate GPCR
(Caenorhabditis elegans, E value 4e-04) for subfamilies a, b
and c, respectively. Based on the gene characteristics
described below and observed tissue distribution (see
Results, Tissue specificity of expression), we subsequently
called them candidate Aplysia californica chemosensory
receptors (AcCRs) subfamilies a to c.
Candidate Aplysia californica chemosensory receptors subfamily a
A total of 28 genes encoding rhodopsin GPCR-like proteins were identified within the Aplysia genome that
grouped into the single monophyletic AcCRa. Of these, 10
appear to encode 7-TM domain proteins that range in size
from 355 to 368 amino acids (40.1 to 41.5 kDa). The
remaining 18 genes encoded 6-TM domain proteins; however, we were unable to identify an initiator methionine
suggesting that these represent partial length genes. Figure
2a is a comparative representation of the 7-TM proteins,
showing conservation of predicted amino acid sequences

for the gene repertoire. Overall, amino acid sequence
identity among the subfamily ranges from 70% to 95%.
These genes are most distinct from other subfamily
sequences we identified due to the presence of a conserved intron between coding regions ISLM95/GLAV
(based on AcCR27a, Figures 2b and 2c). This was later verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) cloning and sequencing (See Results: laser capture microdissection (LCM)/RT-PCR gene identification).
Also, conservation of GLA/SV96–99, Y120, ITAFITF150–156,
K178, G198, DRA/V271–273, MVT287–289, ET336–337, and
NSSVNI339–344 are distinct this subfamily. Most variability
is found within the N-terminal regions (also see alignments in the Additional file 2). Semi- and highly conserved cysteine residues are located at C114, C159, C161,
C247, C248 and C298, while glycosylation sites can be found
at N18NS, N91IS, N210A/VT and N339SS. Most share a signature motif with a FITAFITFERCLCIA amino acid
sequence in the third transmembrane domain and second
intracellular loop. We found that one genomic contig
AASC01105652 contained two genes, AcCR14a and
AcCR27a (Figure 2b). We predict that these are part of
larger clusters that may become apparent upon completion of the full genomic assembly. Within the Aplysia
genome (1.8 Gb), AcCR14a and AcCR27a are separated by
9031 bp, and are in the same transcriptional orientation.
A comparative amino acid alignment of the partial
AcCR14a and full-length AcCR27a proteins are shown in
Figure 2c.
Candidate Aplysia californica chemosensory receptors subfamily b
(AcCRb)
A total of 38 full-length intronless genes encoding predicted multi-transmembrane rhodopsin GPCR-like proteins were identified belonging to AcCRb. Sizes ranged
from 319 to 364 amino acids in length (36.2 kDa to 40.8
kDa). Figure 3a is a comparative representation of these
proteins, showing conservation of predicted amino acid
sequence for the gene repertoire. Overall, amino acid
sequence identity among the subfamily members ranges
from 43% to 92%. Most variability is found at the N-terminal region and most conservation is within the pre-

dicted transmembrane 3 (also see alignments in
Additional file 2). Most share a signature motif with a
WITAFVTFERCLCIA amino acid sequence in the putative
second intracellular loop. We found that at least some of
the genes are clustered in the genome, including genes
AcCR11b and AcCR12b (Figure 3b), as well as genes
AcCR13b and AcCR14b (Figure 3c). Within the Aplysia
genome, genes AcCR11b and AcCR12b are separated by
9173 bp while genes AcCR13b and AcCR14b are separated
by 13297 bp, which also includes a putative non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon element in the reverse orientation (10532 to 9078 bp) (Figure S1 in Additional file
3). Amino acid identity between AcCR11b and AcCR12b,
as well as AcCR13b and AcCR14b is high, 80.5% and
73.9% respectively (Figure S2 in Additional file 3). Conserved cysteines (based on AcCR11b) can be found at C88,
C133, C135, C221 and C269 and N-linked glycosylation sites
include N5ES, N65IT, N184KT, N310ST, and N320MS.
Candidate Aplysia californica chemosensory receptors subfamily c
(AcCRc)
A total of 24 full-length genes containing uninterrupted
coding regions were identified belonging to AcCRc. Sizes
ranged from 324 to 433 amino acids in length (37.7 kDa
to 49 kDa). Figure 4 is a comparative representation of
these proteins, showing conservation of predicted amino
acid sequence for the gene repertoire. Overall, amino acid
sequence gene identity ranges from 19% to 91%. Most
variability is found at the N-terminal region and within
the proposed third intracellular domain, which carried
length polymorphisms (also see alignments in Additional
file 2). Conserved cysteines (based on AcCR2c) are
located at C136 and C138, while semi- and highly conserved
N-linked glycosylation sites are located at N5ET, N16IS,
N54IT, N187TT, N280IS, N331TS.
Tissue specificity of expression
We next studied the expression of subfamily genes in
adult tissues using degenerate primers designed to conserved codons specific to each of the AcCR subfamilies.
This approach was designed to detect if any members
within the three subfamilies were expressed in the target

products were 756 bp, 832 bp, 512 bp for AcCRa, AcCRb and AcCRc, respectively. The PCR control, using water instead of
cDNA, was negative (cont -ve). Actin cDNA was amplified from each tissue preparation (224 bp).

tissues. Transcripts from AcCRa and AcCRb were identified in rhinophore, as well as the oral tentacle; AcCRa
transcript was also present in the ovotestis (Figure 5).
AcCRc transcripts were detected in the oral tentacle, indicating that each of the gene subfamilies are differentially
expressed in the sensory tissues. No transcripts were
detected in the skin, central nervous system, albumen
gland or large hermaphroditic duct using the method
described. We used the Aplysia housekeeping gene actin to
demonstrate the integrity of each RT sample (224 bp). An
alignment of deduced AcCRa amplicon sequences
obtained from rhinophore, oral tentacle and ovotestis
revealed that different members are present, which correspond most closely to genes AcCR5a (97%), AcCR19a
(100%), and AcCR7a (90%), respectively (Figure S3 in
Additional file 3). A comparative analysis of proteins
encoded in AcCRb amplicons showed that the rhinophore
and oral tentacle express a common candidate chemoreceptor gene, corresponding to the gene AcCR17b. Several
point mutations, however, were present within the rhinophore transcript, which led to a premature stop codon
(Figure S3 in Additional file 3). The AcCRc amplicon corresponded to the clone AcCR2c.
Scanning electron microscopy and molecular
identification of candidate chemoreceptors
Based on results from tissue-specific expression experiments, we focused on the chemosensory organs. In reproductively mature Aplysia adults, the rhinophore (about 1
cm in length) is round and tapered from the base to the
tip (Figure 6). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) supports histological examination [27,28] and reveals that
rhinophore grooves comprise folds of sensory epithelia
bearing numerous cilia extending from a common pore
(Figures 6a to 6c). The tip and outside surface of rhinophores are largely devoid of obvious cilia. This rhinophore groove epithelium was previously isolated by LCM
and used to construct a cDNA library [12]. In a mature
adult, the oral tentacle extends laterally and anteriorly
from the ventral surface of the head, with an epithelium
containing numerous bunched cilia (Figures 6d to 6f).
Although ciliated regions were most common, the oral
tentacle did contain regions of no obvious cilia. We next
performed PCR with the aim to identify full-length candidate chemoreceptors from the rhinophore epithelium
LCM library or prepared oral tentacle cDNA. Three clones
were selected for further analysis. Subsequent protein
sequence analyses using the Protein Families database of
alignments and Interpro database [33] revealed that the
deduced amino acid sequences have characteristics common to rhodopsin GPCRs (Figure S4 in Additional file 3).
AcCRa
PCR amplification of a rhinophore epithelium LCM
library using degenerate primers that were selective for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/28

members of AcCRa sequences (primer combinations A1
to A5) generated amplification products of 757 bp. Several amplicons were successfully cloned and sequenced,
revealing multiple partial-length AcCRa genes. Subsequently, the full length of one gene sequence was identified by 5'- and 3'-RACE, containing 1269 bp and encoding
a protein of 354 amino acids (Figure 7a – corresponding
most closely, 91%, to partial gene AcCR8a). The sequence
data has been submitted to the GenBank database under
accession number EU935862. It possesses three protein
kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites (T203YK, S256DR,
S337SK,) and four N-linked glycosylation sites (N18ET,
N76IS, N196AT and N325SS). The intron/exon boundary
exists between coding regions ISLM80/GLAV. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy profiles indicate the existence of seven
hydrophobic transmembrane segments that were composed of between 20 and 25 residues, connected by extracellular and cytoplasmic loops.
AcCRb
PCR amplification of a rhinophore epithelium LCM
library using degenerate primers that were selective for
AcCRb sequences (primer combinations B1 to B8) generated amplification products of 744 bp. Several amplicons
were successfully cloned and sequenced, revealing multiple partial-length AcCRb genes. Subsequently, the full
length of one gene sequence was identified by 5'- and 3'RACE, containing 1483 bp and encoding a protein of 354
amino acids (Figure 7b – corresponding most closely,
99.4%, to gene AcCR29b). The sequence data has been
submitted to the GenBank database under accession
number EU808014. It possesses potentially six PKC phosphorylation sites (S11SK, T15QK, T147PR, T249NR, S322SK,
S343ER) and four N-linked glycosylation sites (N5NS,
N65IT, N184VT and N310ST) within the predicted N-terminal region and intracellular loop domains. Kyte-Doolittle
hydropathy profiles of the deduced amino acid sequence
showed that it contained seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments that were each composed of 25 residues.
AcCRc
AcCRc genes could not be PCR-amplified from a rhinophore LCM library. However, transcripts could be
obtained from oral tentacle cDNA preparations (Figure 7c
– corresponding most closely, 98%, to identified gene
AcCR2c). PCR amplification of oral tentacle cDNAs using
degenerate primers selective for AcCRc (gene combination C1) generated an amplification product of 824 bp.
The amplicon was successfully cloned and sequenced.
Subsequently, the full-length gene sequence was identified by 5'- and 3'-RACE, containing 1752 bp and encoding
a protein of 398 amino acids. The sequence data has been
submitted to the GenBank database under accession
number EU808013. It possesses 10 PKC phosphorylation
sites (T7ER, T28LR, T150FK, T188TR, S195SK, S275RR, S295NK,

showed that it contained seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments that were composed of between 20 and

Immunofluorescent localization of a candidate
chemoreceptor
We complemented our RT-PCR gene expression study by
analyzing the spatial distribution of AcCR29b protein
within rhinophore and oral tentacle. Figures 8a and 8b
shows representative sections of immunoreactivity within
similar cell types located at the epithelial surface of rhinophore and oral tentacle, respectively. In both, antisera
strongly label cell bodies and processes that extend to the
surface, containing no apparent cilia. Rhinophore immunolabeling was most prominent in cells located in epithelia at the tip and outer surfaces, while not obvious within
epithelium of the rhinophore groove at the magnification
tested. Controls in which the primary antibody was preabsorbed against its antigenic peptide showed greatly
reduced staining at the same exposure (Figure 8b, inset).
Distribution of Gαq, Gαi and Gαo immunoreactivity in
rhinophore
Sections were taken from the sites of pheromone detection, the rhinophore. Aplysia G proteins encoded by previously isolated transcripts from rhinophore sensory
epithelium [29] are shown schematically in Figure 9a.
Commercial antibodies used for this study were directed
to the C-terminus which shares 100% identity with Aplysia
Gα proteins. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the
immunoblot expression results [29] and demonstrated
localization of immunoreactive Aplysia Gαq in rhinophore
sections. Numerous Gαq immunoreactive fibers were
observed proximal to the rhinophore epithelium and
within the distal layer (Figure 9b); Gαqimmunoreactivity
appeared to be present in the outer sensory surface, con-

sistent with a potential role in pheromone signal transduction. Gαi-labeled cells were identified throughout
rhinophore sections, where immunoreactivity was particularly concentrated in the distal regions of sensory epithelia. Inspection of these sections at high magnification
revealed that the majority of cells in the epithelium were
labeled, including cells presumed to be supporting cells
and sensory neurons (Figure 9c). Immunoreactive fibers
could also be found spreading into the cortex of the rhinophore, although this was less prominent. In contrast,
immunoreactive Aplysia Gαo had a more restricted distribution, in that each section contained several immunoreactive fibers that were observed primarily within
presumptive olfactory neuron dendrites (Figure 9d); fewer
immunoreactive presumptive sensory neuron cell bodies
were observed. No immunoreactivity was observed when
primary antibody to Gαq, Gαi or Gαo was omitted (data
not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we provide an important step towards
understanding the molecular and cellular basis of chemosensory recognition in molluscs. Mining of the incomplete A. californica genome revealed a novel and diverse set
of genes encoding 90 (72 considered full-length intact)
rhodopsin GPCR-like proteins that are likely to mediate
chemosensory responses in Aplysia. To initially identify
genes encoding multi-transmembrane GPCR-like proteins
that may play a role in chemosensory detection, a number
of assumptions were made that have proved important for
the successful isolation of chemoreceptors in other metazoans. First, receptor genes would encode 7-TM domains
and be clustered in the genome. Second, receptors would
be relatively rapidly evolving and thus have limited amino
acid sequence identity to members of known conserved
GPCR families. Finally, receptors would be encoded by
unique families of related genes, as has been observed in
a range of other bilaterians [5,15,34]. Phylogenetic analysis of the identified Aplysia genes revealed the existence of
three monophyletic subfamilies, which we have named
candidate Aplysia californica chemosensory receptor

(AcCR) subfamilies a to c; their primary features are summarized in Table 1. The gene expansion observed could
provide the diversity of receptors required to enable the
animal to recognize diverse water-soluble molecules, as
well as complex pheromone blends during the coordination of attraction and reproduction.
Consistent with known chemosensory receptors (for
example, insect, rodent, fish), all selected genes that were
considered full length encoded 7-TM regions and semiconserved glycosylation sites, as well as several common
cysteine residues and amino acid sequence motifs. Conserved amino acids and post-translational modifications
would likely contribute to the correct folding and functioning within the plasma membrane so that they may
bind chemical stimuli and couple to appropriate secondary signaling molecules. For example, Katada and colleagues [35] demonstrated that in rodents, N-terminal
glycosylation is critical for proper targeting of ORs to the
plasma membrane. While proteins encoded by AcCRa
and AcCRb genes share notably high sequence identity,
comparative analysis within AcCRc shows that they share
as little as 19% amino acid identity. As a consequence,
there are very few defining sequence motifs which are
retained throughout. However, it is not uncommon for
chemoreceptors, and in particular gustatory receptors, to

be divergent; similarity between most insect and mammalian gustatory receptor pairs is only 15% and 25% or less
at the amino acid sequence level, respectively [10,36].
Of the major GPCR superfamily groups, the identified
Aplysia genes categorize most closely to the rhodopsin
GPCR family (based on Interpro database [33]). As is the
case with many other rhodopsin family GPCRs, these
genes largely lack introns. Moreover, all encoded proteins
have a short N-terminus and a highly conserved arginine
(R) residue located at the cytosolic end of the third transmembrane domain. This residue is typically associated
with the DRY (Asp-Arg-Tyr) motif, crucial for controlling
agonist-dependent receptor activation. Of the three residues constituting DRY, arginine is the most conserved residue, and appears to be essential for forming
intramolecular interactions that constrain receptors in
either the inactive or activated conformation [37]. Consistent with this, receptors lacking the arginine side chain
fail to activate G-protein signaling [38,39]. In the novel
Aplysia proteins, however, this has been replaced by an
ERC motif, a feature also observed in the human prostaglandin F2α receptor and most other prostanoid receptors
[40]. Studies show that substitution of the glutamic acid
to a threonine residue leads to full constitutive activation
and implicates the region in agonist-dependent G-protein

coupling control [40]. We predict that this may also be
essential to receptor activation in the identified Aplysia
receptors.
The canonical model of GPCR activation is via an interaction with intracellular heterotrimeric G-protein signaling
components. The genes identified in this study show little
amino acid identity to GPCRs found in the Metazoa and
we have not shown that they directly interact with G-proteins. Despite this, our study indicates that Gα proteins
are present in the rhinophore sensory epithelium, possibly in close association with transmembrane GPCRs. The
presence of sensory tissue G-protein immunoreactivity
adds further support to studies of other marine invertebrate olfactory systems implicating G-proteins in sensory
transduction [21,41]. Moreover, the existence of multiple
G-type proteins in sensory epithelium suggests that multiple signal transduction pathways may be activated following ligand stimulus. In squid, for example, the pattern of
immunolabeling implies that a G protein coupled to a
PLC pathway (Gαq and Gαo) may be present in similar
cells as those coupled to a cAMP pathway (Gαi). As suggested by Mobley and colleagues [21], overlapping G-protein pathways could facilitate discrimination between
odorants detected by the same neuron. This contrasts
rodent models where the role of G proteins in olfactory
transmembrane signaling at the dendrites has been studied extensively. Researchers have demonstrated spatially
restricted patterns of expression of respective G proteins
[42-44]. Gαo and Gαi2 are highly expressed by separate
subsets of neurons that are located in different regions of
the vomeronasal neuroepithelium [44].
Of particular relevance to Aplysia chemosensory studies is
the rhinophore epithelium, where water-borne molecules
such as pheromones presumably bind and initiate activation of pheromone-receptive neurons. In the rhinophore
groove, receptor cells with a suspected chemosensory role
have been described previously in molluscs [26-28] and
their presence was further supported by our SEM analysis.
The rhinophore groove ciliary aggregations are likely necessary in the separation and circulation of fluid throughout the groove, and may also be directly involved in
detection of external chemical stimuli. It is from this precise location that we isolated cDNAs encoding identified
novel GPCR-like proteins. Their presence raised the question as to whether their expression was specific to sensory
tissues. Subsequently, representatives of each subfamily
were found to be restricted to or differentially expressed in
the rhinophore, oral tentacles and ovotestis, suggesting
that they encode functional receptors and that these olfactory organs sense different chemicals. In the rhinophore,
spatial expression of cells immunoreactive to candidate
chemoreceptor AcCR29b was most prominent in the tip
and outer epithelium, peripheral to the groove. Chemo-

sensory detection could likely benefit from this broad distribution, whereby stimulation may activate sensory fibers
that extend to higher brain centers. Although this finding
clearly indicates a sensory role, a more extensive study of
Aplysia sensory organs at higher magnification is required
to delineate the precise distribution of this receptor, as
well as other receptor subfamily members.
Interestingly, we found gene expression within the ovotestis, and our preliminary analysis of various Aplysia neuronal EST databases indicate that a relatively small fraction
of these genes may be expressed in the central nervous system. Deep sequencing of neuronal transcripts has resulted
in identification of tags for 13 different genes in the central ganglia of A. californica (that is, AcCR1a, AcCR5a,
AcCR15a, AcCR32b, AcCR5c, AcCR9c, AcCR11c, AcCR15c,
AcCR16c and AcCR20c, see Additional file 1) as well as
several orphan receptors similar to vertebrate ghrelin and
histamine receptors (L Moroz, unpublished). Some of
those are associated with centrally located sensory neurons that send neuronal processes to the periphery and
therefore may be involved in chemoreception. Other neuronal cell types were previously described as motorneurons. Taken together, these findings imply that external
chemical detection may not be their sole function, which
is consistent with that described of chemoreceptors in
mammalian olfactory bulb [45], cardiac muscle [46] and
vertebrate germ tissues [47-49]. The functional significance of such expression is currently unknown. We speculate that there may be a role for Aplysia chemoreceptors in
oocyte recognition, possibly because both are activated by
identical or structurally similar hormones and pheromones. In addition to the exocrine albumen gland, the Aplysia pheromone seductin is known to be expressed in
ovotestis tissue [24].
It will be of interest to perform a comparative gene analysis to determine whether A. californica candidate chemoreceptors are also present in other Aplysia species. This
finding would suggest that these genes are highly similar
throughout Aplysia species and strongly imply a selective
pressure for conservation. We have already established
that several Aplysia species share a comparable attraction
pheromone blend [4,23], and therefore cognate receptor
binding sites are likely to be similar. The identification of
ligands for chemosensory receptors is often problematic
and therefore it is an advantage that we have these attraction pheromones for use in future functional studies to
definitively link identified genes to chemosensory detection. As these are the first such novel GPCRs identified in
molluscs, it will also be of interest to see if analogous
receptors are found in evolutionarily distant molluscs.
However, apart from the highly conserved insect receptor
Or83b [50], it is generally accepted that chemoreceptors

Page 15 of 20

BMC Biology 2009, 7:28

seem to be very divergent with little sequence conservation within and across orders [51,52].
Our analysis of the Aplysia genome noted that AcCRa
genes as well as various AcCRb genes are clustered, a common feature of fast-evolving genes such as chemoreceptor
genes [15,53-55]. We also found that, although the assembly of the genome used was incomplete, some genes contain mutations that introduce stop codons to encode
truncated proteins, one of which appears to be expressed
in the A. californica rhinophore. Hominoids, in particular,
are known to possess a high pseudogene content (50%)
among their ORs, whereas only 20% of OR genes are
pseudogenes in the mouse [34] and less in the Drosophila
melanogaster genome [56]. Upon genome completion, a
more comprehensive analysis of GPCR gene families in
Aplysia will be necessary to determine the precise pseudogene number. Indeed, some of the pseudogenes identified
may in fact be 'flatliners', that is, genes whose functional
versus pseudogene status is unclear [57]. As demonstrated
in C. elegans, many of these genes have apparently functional alleles in one or more wild isolates and therefore
are not pseudogenes. Evidence for this has also been
shown for some Drosophila ORs [58] and gustatory receptors [59], as well as Anopheles gambiae gustatory receptors
[51]. Although pseudogenes are generally accepted as
nonfunctional and therefore not transcribed, occasionally
it has been shown that such pseudogenes can be transcribed [60]; however, there is no evidence of the functional relevance.

Conclusion
Aplysia is an excellent model animal for studying the
molecular mechanism of chemical communication in the
marine environment. In this study we have isolated a
novel group of genes encoding multi-transmembrane
rhodopsin GPCR-like proteins that show expression in
chemosensory tissues. This expression pattern and
observed genomic clustering provide strong evidence that
these have arisen via gene duplication and may be used to
discriminate the large diversity of water-soluble molecules. The expression of some of these in rhinophore suggests that they are excellent candidates to be involved in
pheromone detection. Further knowledge of the receptor
gene genome organization, characterization of their
developmental and spatial expression profile, secondary
signaling and their evolutionary relationship to other
molluscan species would be the next significant steps
towards defining the logic behind how chemical communication in molluscs, and potentially other marine animals, operates.

Methods
Database mining for multi-transmembrane rhodopsin Gprotein coupled receptor-like genes
A. californica genome contig sequences were procured
from
the
NCBI
trace
database
http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/
genom_table.cgi?organ ism=euk[61]. This was a preliminary genome assembly from 2× coverage of the genome
by the Broad Institute at MIT http://www.genome.goPages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/Aply
siaSeq.pdf[62]. An iterative tBLASTn strategy was adopted
to identify multi-transmembrane rhodopsin GPCR-like
genes in the Aplysia genome. Selection criteria included
that receptors would be encoded by a family of related
genes; at least some receptor genes would be clustered at
the same genetic loci; receptors would have limited amino
acid identity to members of known GPCR superfamilies;
and a full-length coding region would encode multiple
transmembrane domains. A search was initially performed using molluscan GPCR protein sequences already
submitted to GenBank, as queries; a non-stringent expectation value cutoff of 1e-4 was employed. During this
search we retrieved two sequences on contig
AASC01105652 with genes encoding hydrophobic multitransmembrane domains with no significant amino acid
identity to other proteins. Putative Aplysia transmembrane
receptors were in turn employed in searches to find more
genes in an iterative tBLASTn process. A candidate rhodopsin GPCR-like gene having a complete open reading
frame (methionine, 7-TM domains, three extracellular
domains, three intracellular domains, and a stop codon)
was considered intact and probably functional. To be conservative, genes that were >98% identical in amino acid
sequence were considered allelic variants. As the Aplysia
genome has not yet been fully assembled and consists of
only contigs, this method does not identify splice-variants
or provide a comprehensive analysis of gene clustering.
Pseudogenes were identified by premature stop codons
and we have arbitrarily chosen to disregard those genes
that encode less than six transmembrane domains. Computer analyses of sequences were performed using BLAST
and CLUSTALW for nucleotide alignment. Transmembrane helix domain and topology of predicted receptors
was performed using HMMTOP version 2.0 program;
http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/index.html[63].
Hydrophilicity plots were generated using the TMHMM
program at http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/html/sub
mit.html[64]. In order to categorize identified genes, we
used http://pfam.janelia.org/search[65] and the Interpro
database [33].
Phylogenetic and gene analysis
Selection of outgroup sequences was performed by GenBank tBLASTn searches. The approach provided homologous counterparts from C. elegans for the Aplysia

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:28

rhodopsin GPCR-like genes representing subfamilies a
and b. We did not find any significant counterparts for
subfamily c. The sequences were aligned with t-coffee [66]
under default settings. Alignments have subsequently
been improved by eye. Character positions, which could
not be aligned unambiguously, were not considered for
the phylogenetic analyses in order to avoid conflicting
phylogenetic signal. The inclusion of outgroup sequences
of C. elegans and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus resulted in a
large proportion of only ambiguously alignable positions
and consequently required deletion of a relatively high
number of characters. Therefore we performed two separate analyses: first, we aligned and analyzed the ingroup
sequences only in order to reconstruct their evolution
under a maximal number of informative characters. Second, we aligned and analyzed the dataset with the nonAplysia sequences included in order to infer the polarity to
the phylogeny.
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on a multi-processor Linux-Cluster under the likelihood criterion using
RAxML v. 7.0 [67] for Maximum Likelihood and MrBayes
v. 3.1.2 [68] for the Bayesian Inference. MrBayes analyses
were performed in two runs of eight MCMCMC chains
and under the GTR+G+I Model [69]. Chains ran for
10,000,000 generations or were stopped when the standard deviation of split frequencies between both runs fell
below 0.01. RAxML bootstrap analyses on 1,000 replicates
have been performed under the PROTMIX algorithm with
the WAG amino acid substitution model [70]. In PROTMIX the tree inference is performed under the PROTCAT
model followed by the final tree evaluation under the
PROTGAMMA model in order to obtain stable likelihood
values (see the RAxML manual for further details).
Animal and sample preparation
Adult A. californica (100 to 500 g) were obtained from
Marine Research and Educational Products (Escondido,
CA, USA). Animals were anesthetized in isotonic MgCl2
(337 mM) equivalent to 50% of their weight, relevant tissues dissected out and either (1) embedded in optimal
cutting temperature (OCT) compound for LCM or sectioning, (2) snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and
protein isolation, or (3) prepared for SEM.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from rhinophore, oral tentacle,
skin, pooled central nervous system, albumen gland, large
hermaphroditic duct, and ovotestis tissues of A. californica
using a Tripure Isolation Reagent. Any contaminating
genomic DNA was removed by treatment with DNase I
followed by lithium chloride/ethanol precipitation. Firststrand cDNA synthesis was performed in a 20 μl reverse
transcription mixture containing oligo d(T)12–18 and 200
U Superscript III RNase H- reverse transcriptase, following

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/28

the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using
1 μl of prepared cDNA using subfamily-specific primers
(see Table S1 of Additional file 3: primer combinations
A3, B3 and C1). Each reaction was performed in a final
concentration of 1× PCR Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM
of each dNTP, 0.5 μM of sense and antisense primer, 1.25
units of Red Taq polymerase and ddH2O. Negative controls contained no template cDNA. PCR using actin-specific primers (sense, 5'-GCTTCACCACCACTGCCGAGAG3' and antisense, 5'-ACCAGCAGATTCCATACCCAGG-3')
were used to ensure the integrity of each tissue cDNA sample. Reactions were heated at 94°C for 2 min and amplified for 36 cycles (94°C, 60 s; 50 to 55°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60
s). Following PCR, 15 μl of reaction mix was fractionated
on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining. Based on the primer design, the expected amplification sizes were 756 bp (AcCRa), 832 bp (AcCRb), 512
bp (AcCRc) and 224 bp (actin). PCR products were cloned
into pGEM-T vector and sequenced.
Scanning electron microscopy of rhinophore and oral
tentacle
Adult Aplysia rhinophore and oral tentacle were fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2 to 7.4)
for 3 days at 4°C. Secondary fixation was in 1% OsO4
(osmium tetroxide) in 0.1M sodium cacodylate. This
material was dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol
(20% to 100%). The samples were dried using hexamethyldisilazane and platinum-coated using Eiko IB-5 Sputter
Coater. The specimens were viewed using a Jeol 6300
Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope.
Laser capture microdissection and molecular identification
of candidate A. californica chemosensory receptors
The location of the rhinophore groove, glomeruli underlying the sensory epithelium, and rhinophore ganglia in
Aplysia have been described previously [26-28]. To examine whether selected genes are expressed in rhinophore
sensory epithelial cells, a combination of LCM, total RNA
isolation, library construction and RT-PCR were performed. Rhinophore tissue that had been embedded in
OCT compound was sectioned (10 μm) onto slides and
dehydrated. LCM was performed using a PixCell II laser
capture microscope with an infrared diode laser (Arcturus
Engineering Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) and a laser
spot size of 15 μm. Cells were marked, captured on CapSure HS caps (Arcturus), and total RNA was isolated using
the Picopure Isolation Kit (Arcturus) including DNase I
incubation. RNA quality was determined by measurement
of absorbance ratio at 260 nm/280 nm.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized according to the
SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), with the minor modification of
incorporated EcoRI restriction sites during cDNA synthesis

samples were heated at 95°C for 1 min and amplified for
30 cycles (95°C, 1 min; 50°C, 30 s; 68°C, 4 min). Reaction volumes of 50 μl were treated with 2 μl of proteinase
K (20 μg/μl) at 45°C for 20 min, and PCR products were
precipitated. Dried samples were resuspended in 80 μl of
deionized water. EcoRI digestion was performed and size
fractionation was achieved using a CHROMA SPIN-400
column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Products were
purified by precipitation and the dried pellet resuspended
in 7 μl deionized water. EcoRI cDNA was cloned into the
EcoRI sites of Lambda ZAP II vector, and the cDNA library
(complexity 1 × 106) amplified once.
The sequences of oligonucleotide primers (Sigma-Genosys, Australia) used for library PCR are located in Table S1
of Additional file 3. For AcCRa and AcCRb genes, PCR was
performed using degenerate sense and antisense primer
combinations A1 to A5 (AcCRa) and B1 to B8 (AcCRb).
Each reaction was performed using Red Taq polymerase
(Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were heated at 94°C for 3 min and amplified for 36
cycles (94°C, 60 s; 45°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60 s), followed by a
7-min extension at 72°C. PCR products were cloned into
the TA vector pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced as previously described [23]. To obtain 5' and 3' sequences, PCR
was performed using gene-specific primers. For 3'-RACE,
gene-specific sense primers (A3' and B3') were used in
combination with vector primer T3. For 5'-RACE, genespecific antisense primers (A5' and B5') were used in combination with vector primer T7. Samples were heated at
94°C for 2 min and amplified for 36 cycles (94°C, 60 s;
50°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60 s), followed by a 7-min extension at
72°C. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector and
sequenced.

any contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with DNase I (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of total RNA in a 20 μl
reverse transcription mixture containing oligo d(T)12–18
and 200 U Superscript™ III RNase H- reverse transcriptase,
following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences
of oligonucleotide primers used for PCR are located in
Table S1 of Additional file 3. PCR was performed using
degenerate sense and antisense primer combinations C1-

C3. 3'- and 5'-RACE was performed with the SMART RACE
amplification kit (BD Biosciences) and using gene-specific
primers sense and antisense primers (C3' and C5'). Samples were heated at 94°C for 2 min and amplified for 36
cycles (94°C, 60 s; 50°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60 s), followed by a
7-min extension at 72°C. PCR products were cloned into
a pGEM-T vector and sequenced.
Immunohistochemical localization
A rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated to the N-terminal region of candidate chemoreceptor 29b, corre(GenScript
sponding
to
N6SQARSSKSTQKGL
Corporation). This region was chosen due to its lack of
significant amino acid identity to other receptors. Details
of the immunohistochemical protocol have been
described [23,24]. Briefly, tissue cryostat sections of rhinophore were incubated overnight at 4°C in either affinity-purified 29b antibody (0.6 mg/ml, 1:500), Gαq, Gαi or
Gαo antisera (Chemicon, 1:500 dilution), rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at 22°C, rinsed in
PBS, and then mounted in FITC mounting media (90%
glycerol/100 mM Tris pH 8.0). Preparations were examined using an Olympus FluoView confocal microscope
(Leeds Precision Instruments, Inc., Minneapolis, USA),
and the images captured on a spot-cooled charged coupled device camera. Sections were counterstained with
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or propidium iodide at 1
μg/ml in water. As a control, the primary antiserum was
replaced with no primary antibody. For 29b, a control
also included using the primary antibody that had been
preabsorbed against its antigenic peptide (20 μg/ml).
