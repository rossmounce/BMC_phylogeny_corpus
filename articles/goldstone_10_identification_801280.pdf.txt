Abstract
Background: Increasing use of zebrafish in drug discovery and mechanistic toxicology demands knowledge of
cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene regulation and function. CYP enzymes catalyze oxidative transformation leading to
activation or inactivation of many endogenous and exogenous chemicals, with consequences for normal
physiology and disease processes. Many CYPs potentially have roles in developmental specification, and many
chemicals that cause developmental abnormalities are substrates for CYPs. Here we identify and annotate the full
suite of CYP genes in zebrafish, compare these to the human CYP gene complement, and determine the
expression of CYP genes during normal development.
Results: Zebrafish have a total of 94 CYP genes, distributed among 18 gene families found also in mammals. There
are 32 genes in CYP families 5 to 51, most of which are direct orthologs of human CYPs that are involved in
endogenous functions including synthesis or inactivation of regulatory molecules. The high degree of sequence
similarity suggests conservation of enzyme activities for these CYPs, confirmed in reports for some steroidogenic
enzymes (e.g. CYP19, aromatase; CYP11A, P450scc; CYP17, steroid 17a-hydroxylase), and the CYP26 retinoic acid
hydroxylases. Complexity is much greater in gene families 1, 2, and 3, which include CYPs prominent in
metabolism of drugs and pollutants, as well as of endogenous substrates. There are orthologous relationships for
some CYP1 s and some CYP3 s between zebrafish and human. In contrast, zebrafish have 47 CYP2 genes,
compared to 16 in human, with only two (CYP2R1 and CYP2U1) recognized as orthologous based on sequence.
Analysis of shared synteny identified CYP2 gene clusters evolutionarily related to mammalian CYP2 s, as well as
unique clusters.
Conclusions: Transcript profiling by microarray and quantitative PCR revealed that the majority of zebrafish CYP
genes are expressed in embryos, with waves of expression of different sets of genes over the course of
development. Transcripts of some CYP occur also in oocytes. The results provide a foundation for the use of
zebrafish as a model in toxicological, pharmacological and chemical disease research.

that are involved primarily in synthesis, activation or
inactivation of endogenous regulatory molecules, and
those involved most heavily in the metabolism of xenobiotics, but which may act as well in the metabolism of
endogenous compounds. Thus, CYP enzymes can determine the persistence and action of endogenous regulatory molecules as well as many drugs and other
toxicants and carcinogens.

murine CYP oxidoreductase (Por) demonstrates the
essential role of CYP enzymes in murine development
[1]. Many CYPs potentially have roles in developmental
specification. For example, it is well known that CYP26
enzymes regulate levels of retinoids governing pattern
formation during development [2-4]. CYP isoforms that
play essential roles in bile acid homeostasis, steroidogenesis, the vitamin D pathway, and the catabolism of many
hormones may also have important roles in development [5-12].
Many chemicals that cause developmental abnormalities, including cardiovascular, neural, and connective
tissue defects, are substrates for CYPs, and the oxidative
biotransformation of such xenobiotics may determine
the cellular and organ targets of those chemicals [12].
CYP enzymes that are prominent in xenobiotic metabolism could also function in producing morphogenic
molecules or keeping regions free of them, creating temporal and spatial regions of morphogen action and supporting region-specific changes essential for successful
development [12-14]. The roles and regulation of most
xenobiotic metabolizing CYPs during development are
unknown, impeding understanding of mechanisms of
developmental toxicity. Many xenobiotic metabolizing
CYP can be induced via transcription factors (aryl
hydrocarbon receptor, AHR; pregnane-X-receptor, PXR,
peroxisome proliferator activated receptors, PPARs; and
others [15,16]). All CYPs can be targets of exogenous
chemicals that disrupt or enhance their function,
whether or not they are directly involved in xenobiotic
metabolism.
The zebrafish has emerged as one of the most important vertebrate model species in embryology and developmental biology [17,18], due largely to rapid
development coupled with the possibility for genetic
analysis and manipulation. Multiple draft assemblies of
the zebrafish genome have been produced by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [19]. The near completion
of the zebrafish genome has made it possible to address
questions of CYP gene identity and expression during
zebrafish development with substantial clarity and
completeness.
Our objective was to identify and annotate the full suite
of zebrafish CYP genes and examine their phylogenetic
and shared syntenic relationships to human CYPs. We
also examined CYP expression during early development
in zebrafish. CYP expression in vertebrate development
has not been completely mapped for any species; prior
studies in mice examined developmental expression of 40
CYP genes [10,20], less than half of the mouse CYP complement [21]. Our analyses identify novel genes and clusters of CYP genes in zebrafish, and unanticipated waves
of CYP expression during development.

Results
Repeated and exhaustive searching of zebrafish genome
assemblies uncovered a total of 94 CYP genes. Based on
inferred amino acid sequences, these genes fell into 18
CYP gene families that are also found as well in humans
and other mammals. Molecular phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 1) shows relationships among CYP genes and
gene families in zebrafish and human. As with the
human CYP genes, the CYP genes in zebrafish occur in
two major functional groups: those families that include
enzymes involved primarily in endogenous functions
(CYP families 5-51; Table 1); and those that include
enzymes involved heavily in oxidation of xenobiotics
(CYP families 1-3, and to a lesser degree family 4; Table
2). Zebrafish genes in these two major groups are
described in detail below, considering relationship to
human CYPs based on sequence identity, syntenic analysis and, where known, functional properties (functions
of human or other mammalian homologs [22] are indicated in parentheses). The term CYP is fully capitalized
in all cases except for mouse, rat, and Drosophila
(where only the first letter is capitalized), and italicized
only when referring to a specific gene or cDNA, consistent with the nomenclature committee recommendations [23].
CYP Families 5-51
CYP5 (thromboxane A2 synthase, TBXAS1

The mammalian CYP5A1 enzyme catalyzes rearrangement of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). Zebrafish CYP5A1
retains 48% sequence identity with human CYP5A1, and
is located in a region of shared synteny with CYP5A1 in
humans, indicating orthology.
CYP7 (steroid 7a-hydroxylase)

Zebrafish possess one six-exon CYP7A1 and one sixexon CYP7B1 gene, both located on Chromosome 2.
The sequence identity between zebrafish CYP7B1 and
mammalian CYP7Bs technically precludes membership
in the same subfamily, yet shared synteny (Table 3) indicates orthology. Zebrafish also have a third CYP7 gene,
CYP7C1, a CYP7A-like gene located on Chromosome 7,
possibly an ohnolog resulting from the fish-specific
whole genome duplication (WGD 3; [24]).
CYP8 (prostacyclin synthase, PTGIS)

A 10-exon zebrafish CYP8A1 gene is located on chromosome 6. Human CYP8A1 catalyzes the rearrangement of PGH2 to prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin) [25]. A
crystal structure of zebrafish CYP8A1 published in 2008
as part of a comparative structural analysis of prostacyclin synthases, shows that zebrafish and human CYP8A1
exhibit nearly identical ligand-bound and ligand-free
three-dimensional structures, despite exhibiting only
45% identity [26]. Zebrafish also possess three CYP8Bs

CYP11 (pregnenolone and aldosterone synthases)

Zebrafish have 2 CYP11A genes (side-chain cleavage
enzymes), CYP11A1 and CYP11A2, located adjacent to
one another on chromosome 25, and one CYP11B-like
gene, termed CYP11C1 (on Chromosome 16). Vertebrate
CYP11A1 synthesizes pregnenolone from cholesterol,

and a maternally-derived CYP11A1 mRNA has been suggested to form pregnenolone important in cell migration
in the zebrafish zygote [27]. Following the onset of
embryonic transcription, CYP11A1 is expressed in the
yolk syncytial layer. It is then expressed in the embryonic
interrenal primordia, and in the interrenal glands into
adulthood [5,27,28]. In adult zebrafish it is expressed in
the gonads, brain, and interrenal glands. Knockdown of
zebrafish CYP11A1 leads to a shortened axis and epiboly

CYP17 enzymes catalyze dual functions of steroid-17ahydroxylase and steroid-17, 20-lyase. The zebrafish genome has two CYP17A genes that are 49% identical at
the amino acid level, and the two genes are located on
different chromosomes (Chr 13 and 23). One of these
(CYP17A1) was cloned from zebrafish ovary [29].
CYP17A1 is expressed in gonadal tissue, but also in
brain, gill, liver, and intestine. Zebrafish CYP17A1 is
upregulated by fluorotelomer alcohols [30], but not by
benzo[a]pyrene [31]. The functions of the two CYP17 s
may differ (see Discussion, below) [32,33].

CYP17A1

Zebrafish have two distinct CYP19 (aromatase) genes,
CYP19A1 and CYP19B1 reported initially by Kishida
and Callard [34]. The two aromatase forms are
expressed in different tissues; CYP19A1 is expressed
principally in the ovary, but also at much lower levels in
the testis, while CYP19B1 is expressed in brain and
neural tissue, including in the olfactory bulb, ventral telencephalon, preoptic area, and ventral/caudal hypothalamic zone, and in the anterior and posterior lobes of the
pituitary [35]. Estrogen-mediated upregulation has been
observed only for the neural form, CYP19B1, in adults
and in embryos after 24 hpf [34,36].
CYP20A1 (undetermined function)

CYP27A3-7

CYP27A1

Zebrafish have one CYP20 gene, CYP20A1, 61% identical to the CYP20A1 in humans, and they share synteny
(Table 3), both being adjacent to ABI2. At present, the
substrate specificity and biological function of CYP20A1
are unknown, and it remains an “orphan” CYP [37].
However, there is evidence for high levels of mRNA
expression in the hippocampus and substantia nigra of
mouse [38], suggesting functions in these parts of the
brain implicated in important neuropathies.

Zebrafish CYP21A1 shares 39% identity with human
CYP21A2, and shares synteny with the human CYP21A
gene pair (human CYP21A1P is a pseudogene). Mammalian CYP21A1 and CYP21A2 convert progesterone to
deoxycorticosterone via 21-hydroxylation, prominently
in the adrenal gland. The zebrafish CYP21A1 presumably serves a similar function, in the interrenal.

CYP24 s, as vitamin D3 and various metabolites circulate in fish serum [39] and zebrafish have a functional
vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1) with ligand specificity
similar to other vertebrate VDRs [40].
CYP26 (retinoic acid hydroxylase)

There are three CYP26 s in zebrafish. CYP26 was first
discovered in zebrafish [41] and the retinoic acid metabolizing function appears to be conserved throughout
the vertebrates [42-44]. Each zebrafish CYP26 is located
on a separate chromosome, suggesting early establishment of these duplicated genes. The CYP26 s are categorized into three separate subfamilies, with some
confusion as to the proper classification, i.e., zebrafish
CYP26C1 has previously been referred to as CYP26D1
[45]. CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 share synteny with human
CYP26A1 and 26B1 genes, respectively, while the
CYP26C1 syntenic relationship is less distinct (Table 3).
The three zebrafish CYP26 s are all induced by and
metabolize retinoic acid, and play essential roles in
hindbrain patterning [13,44-46]. Zebrafish CYP26 s also
play roles in osteogenesis [2,47], in pancreatic development [48], and presumably other processes.
CYP27 (vitamin D3 metabolism)

Zebrafish have seven distinct CYP27 genes, distributed
into three subfamilies, while in most mammals there are
two or three CYP27 genes. Human CYP27A1 and
CYP27B1 catalyze vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase and 25hydroxyvitamin D3 1a-hydroxylase, respectively [22].
The five zebrafish CYP27A genes are all tandemly
located on Chromosome 9 and share synteny with
human CYP27A1 (Table 1). Zebrafish CYP27B1 and
CYP27C1 are located on different chromosomes (Chr 11
and 6, respectively; Table 1). Functional properties of
the various zebrafish CYP27 s are unknown.
CYP39 (24-OH-cholesterol-7a-hydroxylase)

A CYP39A1 is present in the zebrafish genome, located
on chromosome 20. In mammals CYP39A1 functions as
an oxysterol-7a-hydroxylase, involved in the conversion
of cholesterol to bile acids. CYP39A1 has not been
found in other published fish genomes, but is present in
tetrapod genomes, with conserved synteny to human
CYP39A1. Zebrafish CYP39A1 is approximately 4Mb
from a cluster of genes that share synteny with human
CYP39A1.
CYP46 (cholesterol 24-hydroxylase)

Zebrafish have four CYP46A genes. One (CYP46A1) is
on Chromosome 20, two (CYP46A2 and CYP46A4) are
arranged in tandem on Chromosome 5. A fourth
(CYP46A5) is supported by EST data but missing from
the current assembly (Zv8). In contrast, humans have
one CYP46, CYP46A1. Human CYP46A1 functions both
as a cholesterol 24(S)-hydroxylase and as a 24-hydroxycholesterol-hydroxylase [49,50]. CYP46A1 in mammals
is a brain-specific cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme,

Page 8 of 21

important for maintaining brain cholesterol homeostasis
and membrane function, but also with potential regulatory roles as a neurosteroid-metabolizing enzyme [51].
CYP51 (lanosterol 14a-demethylase)

Zebrafish possess one CYP51 gene, CYP51A1. In other
animals CYP51 is a lanosterol-demethylase enzyme, the
only CYP involved in the post-squalene portion of the
cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. CYP51 is an essential
enzyme in the de novo synthesis of cholesterol [52]).
CYP51 is often considered to be a “housekeeping gene”
based on its ubiquitous expression and conserved function [53]. Zebrafish CYP51 has been cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli [54]. Microarray analysis
and in situ hybridization of embryonic zebrafish showed
that CYP51 is strongly expressed in the eye, in the
brain, and in epidermal cells of the forehead and the tail
fin [55], and suggesting a role for CYP51 and other
isoprenoid synthesis enzymes in hematopoietic and
vascular development.
CYP Families 1-4 (Xenobiotic Metabolizing CYPs)

CYP families 1, 2, 3, and 4 include enzymes involved in
drug, xenobiotic and fatty acid metabolism. In contrast
to the CYPs that have principally endogenous functions,
these CYP genes are much more diverse, with much less
conservation of sequence between zebrafish and human.
Table 2 provides specific information on the CYP 1-4
family genes. A molecular phylogeny of Clan 2 genes,
which includes families 1 and 2 as well as CYP17 and
CYP21, is shown in Figure 2. Molecular phylogeny of
the Clan 3 genes, including the CYP3 s and CYP5 s (discussed above) and Clan 4 genes (the CYP4s) can be seen
in Figure 1. Some relationships between zebrafish and
human CYPs in families 1-3 suggested by molecular
phylogeny have been substantiated by synteny analysis.
Clan 2- CYP1s

Zebrafish have five CYP1 genes in four subfamilies,
CYP1A, CYP1B1, CYP1C1, CYP1C2, and CYP1D1, all of
which have been cloned and sequenced [56-59]. Zebrafish CYP1A has exon structures similar to the human
CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, and the single CYP1B1 gene has
a gene structure very similar to human CYP1B1. The
CYP1Cs are closely linked single-exon genes [57,60].
The recently identified zebrafish CYP1D1 has a gene
structure identical to zebrafish CYP1A, and quite different from the CYP1B1 and CYP1Cs [59]. Members of all
four CYP1 subfamilies have been identified in other
fishes and non-mammalian tetrapods, and the evolution
of the CYP1 family has been discussed elsewhere in
some detail [59,60]. Notably, the CYP1Cs are absent and
CYP1D1 is a pseudogene in human and some other
mammals [59,61]. CYP1A, CYP1B1 and the CYP1Cs are
inducible by AHR agonists [58,62]. Vertebrate CYP1As
and CYP1B1 generally are involved in the metabolism of

Figure 2 Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of zebrafish and human Clan 2 amino acid sequences. CYP1 family sequences are
highlighted in red, while CYP2 sequences are highlighted in yellow. CYP2R1 and CYP2U1 are conserved. Zebrafish CYP2J co-orthologs clearly
cluster with the human CYP2J, as do the zebrafish CYP2Ks with human CYP2W1, and zebrafish CYP2Ys with most of the remaining human CYP2
s. CYP1 evolution has been described elsewhere [58,59]. Human (hs) sequences are red, zebrafish (zf) are blue.

various drugs, many hydrocarbons, steroids and fatty
acids. With the exception of benzo[a]pyrene and estradiol [63,64], little is known of the possible xenobiotic
and endogenous substrates of the CYP1Cs and of
CYP1D1.
Clan 2 - CYP2s

As in mammals, the CYP2 s constitute the largest CYP
gene family in zebrafish, with 47 CYP2 genes, in contrast to 16 in humans. The subfamilies are considered
below, in order according to suggested relationships: (i)

orthology indicated by sequence, (ii) homologs suggested by sequence and orthology confirmed by shared
synteny, and (iii) no evident homologous relationship to
human CYPs.
(i) CYP2R and CYP2U There are single genes in each
of these two subfamilies in zebrafish, CYP2R1 and
CYP2U1. These can be classified as orthologs of human
CYP2R1 and CYP2U1, based on sequence identity. They
also exhibit shared synteny with their respective human
counterparts (Table 3). CYP2R1 is a microsomal vitamin

Goldstone et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:643
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/643

D 25-hydroxylase in humans [65,66]. Human CYP2U1 is
expressed in the brain and the thymus [67], and catalyzes ω and ω-1 hydroxylation of fatty acids, including
arachidonic acid [68]. CYP2U1 appears to have a prevertebrate origin, and may be the oldest identifiable vertebrate CYP subfamily [69].
(ii) CYP2N, CYP2P, CYP2V, CYP2AD The 11 zebrafish
genes in these five subfamilies occur in a clade together
with human CYP2J2 (Figure 2). Analysis of gene location showed that the six CYP2Ps and CYP2N13,
CYP2V1, CYP2AD2, CYP2AD3, and CYP2AD6 all are
arranged in tandem on chromosome 20. This cluster of
CYP genes shares synteny with human CYP2J2, indicating that all 11 zebrafish genes at this locus share an
ancestral origin with CYP2J2 (Figure 3). CYP2J2 is an
arachidonic acid epoxygenase with roles in the cardiovascular system. Functions of the members of the zebrafish cluster are unknown, although related genes in
killifish (CYP2P3 and CYP2N1 and 2N2) are arachidonic
acid hydroxylases and CYP2P3 in particular is similar in
function to human CYP2J2 [70,71].
CYP2K Eight CYP2K genes are present in a tandemly
duplicated array on Chromosome 3. This cluster of
CYP2Ks shares synteny with human CYP2W1 (Additional
File 1, Figure S2). Human CYP2W1 is a tumor-specific
CYP [72,73] that oxidizes indole and chlorzoxazone, but
not fatty acids [74]. CYP2K6, which is not highly
expressed until 5 dpf, has been heterologously expressed,
and demonstrated to catalyze the activation of the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) to the carcinogenic exo-8,9AFB1 epoxide [75]. The low level CYP2K6 expression
during zebrafish embryo and larval stages may help to
explain the lack of AFB1 toxicity in zebrafish embryos
[75]. Functions of the other CYP2Ks are not known.

Page 10 of 21

CYP2Y CYP2Y3 and CYP2Y4 are tandemly arranged on
chromosome 15. They share synteny with a cluster of
CYP2 genes for human drug-metabolizing enzymes,
including CYP2A6, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, CYP2F1, and
CYP2S1 located on human chromosome 19 (Additional
File 1, Figure S3). The human genes at this locus
include genes induced by PXR agonists (CYP2B6) and
genes induced by AHR agonists (CYP2S1). Whether
CYP2Y3 and CYP2Y4 have functional or regulatory
properties in common with any of these human CYPs is
not known.
(iii) CYP2X There are nine CYP2X genes present in two
separate arrays of tandemly duplicated genes, on Chromosomes 7 and 25. Two of the CYP2X genes (CYP2X10
and CYP2X12) (Table 2), have two exact copies in the
current genome assembly (Zv8; Ensembl Build 58) likely
as an artifact of the assembly process, so there is some
uncertainty as to the exact number of CYP2Xs. The
CYP2X genes do not appear to share synteny with any
mammalian CYP. Catalytic activities of CYP2Xs in zebrafish are unknown, although CYP2X1 from channel catfish has been cloned [76] and heterologously expressed
[77]. Aminopyrine and benzphetamine demethylase
activities were observed, but no biological function has
as yet been ascribed.
CYP2AA Due to overlapping gene predictions, the current genome assemblies and gene counts are not accurate in the region on chromosome 23 where the
CYP2AA genes are located. Ten CYP2AA genes are present in a tandemly duplicated array on chromosome 23.
GeneWise [78] predictions indicate that there are 10
CYP2AAs, with high identity to each other (65-85%), but
no clear orthology to other CYP2 s. At least three have
been cloned (CYP2AA1-2AA3; Bainy et al., Buhler et al.,

Figure 3 Syntenic arrangement of the human and zebrafish CYP2J locus. Human CYP2J2 metabolizes arachidonic acid to biologically active
eicosanoids, some of which have vasoprotective effects. All vertebrate genomes that have been examined have at least one gene at this locus;
some have many tandemly duplicated CYPs. Fish CYP2J orthologs are not members of the same subfamily, and functions may have diverged
somewhat. Gene order was obtained from Ensembl 58.

Goldstone et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:643

unpublished data). Some CYP2AA genes appear to be
induced by PXR agonists (Kubota et al., unpublished
data). The CYP2 s most closely related to the CYP2AAs
are the CYP2Xs, and CYP2R1 (Figure 2).
CYP2AE The two CYP2AE genes are present as tandem
duplicates on Chromosome 23, approximately 230 kb
downstream from the CYP2AA cluster. No shared synteny is evident with mammalian genomes, and is unclear
even for other published fish genomes. However, the
CYP2AEs cluster phylogenetically with the CYP2J orthologs CYP2N/P/V/AE (Figure 2), suggesting a possible
insertion of a set of duplicated CYP2J orthologs.
Clan 3 - CYP3s

The zebrafish genome includes five CYP3 genes,
CYP3A65, and four CYP3Cs, CYP3C1-3C4 (Table 2).
CYP3A65 and CYP3C1 were previously cloned and heterologously expressed [79,80]. CYP3A65 is a13 exon
gene located in chromosome 1, and is 54% identical to
human CYP3A4. Zebrafish CYP3C1-CYP3C4 are all 13exon genes located in tandem on zebrafish chromosome
3 (Table 1). Other fish species also have multiple CYP3
genes located in this region (e.g. four in stickleback and
one in fugu), and chickens appear to have two homologs
at that locus. It is likely that the previously named
human pseudogenes CYP3A-se1 and CYP3A-se2 [21] are
the orthologous remnants of these CYP3s, as they are
located in the same region (on chromosome 7q22.1) as
the immediately adjacent FOXK1gene (Additional File 1,
Figure S3). Qiu et al. (2008) found that in most vertebrates apparently intact (i.e. not obviously pseudogenized) CYP3 genes are located within one of two
genomic regions, labeled CYP3HR1 and CYP3HR2 [81].
Zebrafish CYP3Cs are within CYP3HR1, while the
human CYP3As are in CYP3HR2. Zebrafish CYP3A65
does not share synteny with CYP3 s in other fish for
which genomic information is available (medaka, stickleback, fugu, or tetraodon). CYP3A65 is inducible by
some PXR agonists [80,82]. Other fish CYP3As are prominent in catalyzing testosterone 6b-hydroxylase [83],
and this is likely true for zebrafish CYP3A65 as well.
Activities are not known for the other zebrafish CYP3 s.

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
(PPARa) and gamma (PPARg) [87,88]. Zebrafish
CYP4F43 and the CYP4Vs share synteny with their
human counterparts, but zebrafish CYP4T8 does not
occupy a shared syntenic position with other CYP4 s.
Developmental Expression

Using single-color Agilent custom whole-transcriptome
microarrays, we analyzed the expression of 88 CYP
genes over the course of early development in zebrafish
(plot, Figure 4; heat map of normalized values, Figure
5). Zebrafish embryos were staged and sampled from 3
hours post-fertilization (hpf) through 48 hpf, and four
biological replicates were sampled and analyzed (see
Methods). After normalization, probes exhibiting saturation or signals that were not above background were
removed (10 and 82 probes, respectively), leaving 21801
probes for examination of expression patterns. None of
the excluded probes were for CYPs, indicating that all
88 CYPs examined were expressed during development.
Bayesian Estimation of Temporal Regulation (BETR;
[89]) showed 15393 significant differentially expressed
probes (p < 0.01), similar to the results of a naïve
ANOVA analysis. Of the 88 CYP genes examined, 22
were found not to have differential expression during
development. All others had one or more probes that
indicated significant differential expression between
sampling times.
Expression patterns of a subset of 11 CYPs were
assessed using qPCR. Molecule counts were calculated
by using plasmid-derived standard curves, and expression levels were normalized to ARNT2. We previously
observed [62] that ARNT2 has significantly less variability during development than b-actin, a conclusion supported here by the single-color microarray data
(Additional File 1, Figure S4). Nine of the eleven CYPs
examined with qPCR exhibited linear relationships
between the ARNT2-normalized microarray data
and the ARNT2-normalized qPCR molecule counts
(Figure 6).

Clan 4 - CYP4s

Patterns of Expression

There are four CYP4 genes in zebrafish, CYP4F43,
CYP4T8, CYP4V7, and CYP4V8 (Table 2), in contrast to
humans, which have 12 CYP4 s. Mammalian CYP4F
enzymes function as omega-hydroxylases of C 16 -C 26
fatty acids, including eicosanoids such as leukotriene B4
[84,85]. The full range of substrates of CYP4V enzymes
is not yet known, although human CYP4V2 is a selective
omega-hydroxylase of saturated, medium-chain fatty
acids [86]. The CYP4 s appear to have less involvement
in xenobiotic metabolism than many CYP1 s, CYP2 s or
CYP3 s, although some xenobiotics (e.g., phthalates and
perfluorooctanoic acid) induce CYP4Ts possibly via

Several zebrafish CYPs exhibited expression levels that
varied by 10 fold or greater (from low to high point)
during development. Among these are CYP2P6,
CYP11A2, CYP26A1, CYP26B1, CYP2AA7-CYP2AA9,
CYP2AA12, CYP2Y3, CYP2Y4, and CYP20 (Figure 4).
Some had highest levels of expression at the earliest
time point (3 hpf). Others showed a peak at intermediate times, and still others showed elevated expression at
the latest time sampled (48 hpf). Previous investigators
have observed similar variation in expression levels for
some of these CYPs, including CYP2P6 [90], CYP11A1
[28], and the CYP26 s [13,45].

Figure 4 Expression of 88 CYP genes in zebrafish during the first 48 hours of development. Single color microarray analyses of CYP gene
expression throughout early development (3-48 hours post fertilization, hpf) shows that while some CYP genes are expressed in the whole
embryo at high levels, most CYP genes are expressed at levels significantly above background (~5 fluorescent units; see Additional File 2, Table
S3). Strong temporal signals are apparent.

An alternate way of depicting developmental expression is a within-gene normalized heat-map, which shows
the relative expression of all CYPs over the course of
development (Figure 5). While the absolute expression
levels of different genes may be low, especially in comparison to “housekeeping” genes such as b-actin or
ARNT2, within-gene normalization can reveal the relative changes in gene expression throughout the time
series, and allow more ready comparison of profile clusters. This approach revealed a striking picture of waves
of CYP gene expression as development progresses. The
waves of CYP expression occurred with different clusters expressed most strongly usually only at one or two
sequential time points (i.e., unimodally) during development. CYP2K22, CYP2N13, CYP3A65, and CYP8B1
appear to have bimodal expression, with elevated levels
both at 3 and 48 hpf (Figure 5). A similar bimodal
expression pattern was seen with CYP5A1, CYP21A1,
CYHP2K17, CYP8B3, and CYP4T8, which had the highest relative expression at 3hpf and 36 hpf.

Clustering of gene expression patterns (K-means clustering) revealed co-expression of tandemly duplicated
CYPs, evident in the expression clustering of subsets of
the CYP2AAs, the CYP2Ks, the CYP2Ys, the CYP46As,
and the CYP27As (Figure 5). However, other clusters,
such as the set of CYP2 subfamilies that share synteny
with human CYP2J2 did not exhibit complete co-expression: CYP2P10, CYP2P14, CYP2AD2, and CYP2AD6
were mostly highly expressed at 3 hpf, while CYP2P6,
CYP2P7, and CYP2V1 were most highly expressed at
6-12 hpf.
The observation that some CYPs showed high levels of
transcript at 3 hpf, implies that these could involve
maternally-derived transcript in oocytes. A number of
CYP genes identified by cluster affinity search analysis
using MeV [89,91] appear to have a maternal signal in
the microarray data, based on the decreasing expression
levels from 3 hpf (Additional File 1, Figure S5 and Additional File 2, Table S1). To begin assessing maternal
transcript we examined selected CYP in unfertilized

Discussion
In this study we identified the total CYP complement in
zebrafish, and assessed patterns of expression of these
genes during normal embryonic development. Zebrafish
are an increasingly important model in developmental
toxicology, pharmacology and chemical effects on disease. Knowing the identity and regulation of CYP genes
is essential to strong inference regarding chemical
effects in this model, and to assess pathways of metabolism of xenobiotics and endobiotics, and the relationship
to CYP roles in these processes in humans. The 94 zebrafish CYPs occur in the same 18 gene families that are
found in humans and other mammals, but with differences in numbers of genes, and often with uncertain
function.
CYP Families 5-51

Figure 5 Heat map of CYP developmental expression with
each gene z-normalized to display the temporal expression
waves. Hierarchical K-means clustering of z-normalized data
exposes the temporal waves of CYP gene expression through early
zebrafish development. Different clusters of genes are expressed at
the different sampling times. A few sets of genes exhibit bimodal
distributions, particularly CYP3A65, 8B1, 2N13, 2K22, and to a lesser
extent, CYP21A1, 2K17, 8B3, 27A4, and 5A1. Unnormalized clustering
presents a different pattern, as high-expressing genes tend to be
clustered together (Additional File 1, Figure S6). CYP2AA6,
CYP2AA13, CYP2P8, CYP2X6, CYP2X9, and CYP46A5 are not
represented on the microarray, as the microarray was generated
using Zv6 rather than the current genome assembly.

eggs. qPCR analysis of unfertilized eggs showed that
CYP1A, CYP2V1, CYP2AA4, and CYP20 had significant
ARNT2-normalized expression levels in unfertilized eggs
(Figure 7). Analysis of the larger complement of CYP
genes for maternal transcript in unfertilized eggs
requires microarray analysis, and is ongoing.

Many of the CYP gene families in this group have single
genes in zebrafish, as they do in humans, and show a
high degree of conservation of sequence with their
human counterparts. These genes also exhibit similar
syntenic relationships as found in human. Together, the
sequence data and gene location data indicate that in
many of these families the genes are direct orthologs of
their human (mammalian) counterparts. Where there is
1:1 correspondence in these gene families, i.e., with
CYP5A1, 7A1, 7B1, 8A1, 20A1, 21A1, 24A1, 26A1,
26B1, 39A1, 46A1 and 51A1, it most likely indicates
conservation of enzyme activities and physiological function. In other gene families in the “endogenous set”,
defining relationships between human CYPs with important endogenous functions and the zebrafish homologs
is complicated by the presence of multiple closely
related paralogs in zebrafish, not found in human. Thus,
zebrafish have two CYP17As, two CYP19As, and four
CYP46As, while humans have only half that number in
each case. Such doubling of the numbers of genes in
several CYP gene families could be the result of individual gene duplication, or could be remnants of the third
round of whole genome duplication (WGD-3 [24,92]),
with the retention of duplicated genes in zebrafish.
Zebrafish CYP paralogs that are co-orthologs of the
human CYPs could have distinct functions, as a result
of function partitioning (subfunctionalization) or differential regulation (temporal and/or organ differences or
differences in induction). This has been observed for
CYP19, with CYP19A1 (ovarian) and CYP19A2 (brain)
aromatases displaying distinct expression patterns and
inducibility. The neural form (CYP19A2) exhibits sensitivity to induction by estrogen, while the ovarian form
appears to be mostly recalcitrant to induction by estrogen receptor agonists [36,93-95]. While functions have
not been confirmed for zebrafish, the two CYP17A
genes in other fish also appear to represent enzyme

and medaka CYP17A1 possess both steroid-17a-hydroxylase and 17, 20-lyase activities, as does mammalian
CYP17A1, but both tilapia and medaka CYP17A2 possess only 17a-hydroxylase activity, as they only convert

pregnenolone or progesterone to 17a- hydroxy products, but do not perform the subsequent conversion to
androstenedione or DHEA [32,33]. There also are significant differences in spatial expression patterns for the
duplicated CYP17A genes during development, and

during the spawning cycle in other fish [32]. We did not
see any substantial temporal separation of CYP17A1 and
CYP17A2 expression during development, although
CYP17A1 is more strongly expressed (Figure 4 and
Additional File 2, Table S2).
In some families of “endogenous” genes, zebrafish
have more than twice the number of genes than occur
in humans, and some have novel subfamilies as well.
This is evident in the CYP27s, and the CYP46s, where
the numbers of genes are greater than would be
expected to have resulted from WGD-3. It is likely that
the ancestral condition would be one of fewer genes,
with expansion in zebrafish rather than loss in humans.
That expansion in zebrafish could involve WGD, but is
most evident in tandem duplication as well as translocation. This is clearly suggested in CYP27 by the four
genes that share synteny with the single human
CYP27A1, and the presence of CYP27B1 and 27C1,
which do not share synteny with human CYPs. The biological significance of some duplicated genes also could
involve distinctions in temporal or organ- and cell-specific regulation, but determining this can be complicated
by the strong possibility of substrate overlap.
CYP Families 1-4

Zebrafish CYP genes in families 1, 2, and 3 are more
diverse than in humans, and sequence identities often

are too low to discern orthology between zebrafish and
mammalian genes in these families. However, analysis of
the additional character of shared synteny clarifies evolutionary relationships between human and zebrafish
genes in these families. CYP family 4 differs from
families 1-3, as there are fewer CYP4 genes in zebrafish
than there are in mammals. However, like the CYP1 s,
CYP2 s and CYP3 s, the CYP4 s also are involved with
(induced by or metabolize) xenobiotics, while this is seldom the case with CYP5-CYP51 genes.
Consistent with phylogeny, the fish CYP1 and CYP3
clades appear as sister groups to the mammalian clades
for these genes. However, as discussed earlier [60], both
mammals and fish share the CYP1 subfamilies CYP1A
and CYP1B. Zebrafish also express CYP1Cs, which do
not occur in humans, and CYP1D1, a pseudogene in
human. All mammalian CYP3 s are in a single subfamily, CYP3A, which occurs in zebrafish as well. However,
zebrafish CYP3A65 shares synteny with single exon
pseudogene CYP3As in human (CYP3A-se1 and -se2),
while the novel CYP3C subfamily [79] shares synteny
with the functional human CYP3A3, 3A4 and 3A7 [81].
Fugu and possibly other fishes also have a second CYP3
subfamily, CYP3B, about which nothing is known
[96,97].
The functional similarities in different taxa, suggest
similar biological roles for the homologous CYP1 s and

Goldstone et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:643
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/643

CYP3 s. Thus, CYP3As are the primary catalysts of testosterone 6b-hydroxylase in fish and mammals [98], and
mammalian and fish CYP1As and likely CYP1Bs are
prominent in the metabolism of some PAH pro-carcinogens. The roles of orthologous CYPs in metabolism of
particular compounds can differ between taxa, however.
Thus, the regio-specific oxidation of BaP and the rates
of metabolism of planar HAH appear to differ in degree
between fish and mammalian CYP1As [99,100], apparently reflecting species differences in CYP1A structures
[101]. The functions of the novel CYP1 s and CYP3 s
are less well defined, although zebrafish CYP1Cs and
CYP1D1 have been expressed and functions have been
determined with BaP [64], estradiol [63], and a number
of other exogenous and endogenous substrates (Urban,
Stegeman, et al. unpublished results). Little is known of
the function of the CYP3Cs, but CYP3C1 appears not to
be responsive to chemicals that induce CYP3A65 [79].
Identifying zebrafish-human orthologs is most difficult
in the CYP2 family, where the differences in CYP2
divergence between zebrafish and humans obscure many
homologous relationships. Thus as noted, of the 11 zebrafish and 11 human CYP2 subfamilies, only two
(CYP2R and CYP2U) warrant the same designation in
zebrafish as in humans based on sequence identity.
While the disparity between zebrafish, or other fish, and
mammals is exaggerated by evolutionary distance, our
analysis of shared synteny indicates that members of
distinct subfamilies in mammals and fish still may bear
co-orthology. The CYP2J-related genes are a key example. The single clade of 11 genes in the zebrafish
CYP2N, 2P, 2V, and 2AD subfamilies and human
CYP2J2 (Figure 2), implies relationship between the fish
and human genes. Our analysis shows the zebrafish
genes occur in tandem in a cluster that shares synteny
with CYP2J2, indicating co-orthology (Figure 3). This
suggests that there are catalytic functions among these
zebrafish CYPs that are similar to the human CYP2J2. A
similar hypothesis was borne out in functional characterization of previously identified killifish CYP2P3,
which also clusters with the CYP2Js on phylogenetic
analysis. Heterologously expressed CYP2P3 exhibited
nearly identical regio- and stereoselectivity for oxidation
of arachidonic acid as human CYP2J2, consistent with
molecular phylogeny indicating a shared ancestral origin
[71]. Notably, at present there is little or nothing known
about the catalytic or biological functions or the chemical regulation of the majority of zebrafish CYP2 s.
Zebrafish CYPs in development

In addition to annotating the full complement of CYP
genes, we analyzed the expression of 88 CYP genes over
the course of development in zebrafish (Figure 4). Several of these zebrafish CYPs exhibited markedly elevated

Page 16 of 21

expression levels at some time during development, but
a large number, including more than three-quarters of
the total genomic complement, showed distinct temporal expression patterns (Figure 5, Additional File 1,
Figure S6). Importantly, gene expression profiling performed on whole embryos often under-estimates the
importance of tissue- or cell-specific gene expression
due to dilution effects.
Our array results are similar to developmental expression that has been determined for some individual CYP
genes (e.g. CYP1 s [59,62], CYP2K6 [75], CYP3C1 [79],
CYP19 [36,102]). Developmental roles have been established principally for some of the “endogenous” CYPs.
Such genes include CYP11A1, which is essential for the
synthesis of pregnenolone, critical for cell migration
[27]; and the three CYP26 s, which contribute to retinoic acid gradients that regulate hindbrain and neural
crest patterning [13,103,104] and osteogenesis [2,47].
We and others have seen complex CYP expression patterns in development. Developmental roles of CYPs in
families 1-3 are unknown, although morpholino knockdown of CYP1Cs appears to protect from developmental
toxicity of dioxin (Kubota et al., unpublished data) and
over-expression of CYP2P6 caused developmental
abnormalities, including cardiovascular abnormalities
[90], suggesting developmental significance of these
genes.
The roles for many CYPs, including roles in development, cannot necessarily be inferred from sequence
identities. Thus, CYP20A1 is an ‘orphan’ CYP that does
not have a defined function in zebrafish or in humans
[37,38], and some large subfamilies (CYP2X, CYP2AA)
do not have any homologs in mammals. As well, the different numbers of genes that are co-orthologs of single
human CYPs precludes assignment of a function to any
one, which requires empirical determination. This is
true for the multiple co-orthologs in the “endogenous”
CYP families, such as the CYP11 s, the CYP27 s and
CYP46’s, as well as for most those in the “xenobiotic”
CYP families. The issues in CYP11 exemplify the questions and approaches. Zebrafish CYP11A1 is expressed
throughout development, as in the murine model, but
the CYP11A1 knockdown is not lethal [5,27]. As zebrafish have two CYP11A genes and a CYP11C gene, it is
possible that overlapping substrate specificity and spatiotemporal expression patterns might allow one to substitute for the other in loss-of-function studies.
There is a greater dearth of information regarding
CYP genes that may have maternally derived transcripts
deposited in oocytes. Our analysis of transcripts of a few
selected CYP genes, CYP1A, CYP2V1, CYP2AA4, and
CYP20A1, showed that transcripts for all four were present in unfertilized zebrafish eggs, and that the levels of
transcript could be substantial. CYP19 mRNA also has

Goldstone et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:643
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/643

been reported in oocytes [105], and CYP1A transcript
also was reportedly recently by others [106]. The significance of maternal transcript of these CYPs is not
known. Whether other CYPs also have maternal transcripts deposited in oocytes, and what influences that
deposition, is under investigation.

Conclusions
The identification of the full complement of 94 zebrafish
CYPs, and determination that the majority of CYPs have
distinct developmental patterns of expression opens the
door to assessing their role(s) not only in development,
but also in the response of embryos to toxic chemicals.
For many CYP genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism,
inferring relationships among the genes between zebrafish and human based on sequence is difficult, complicated by remnants of whole genome duplication in the
teleost line, uneven gene duplication and gene loss in
different animal and gene lineages, and the possibility of
gene conversion of closely linked paralogs [107]. Nevertheless, shared synteny indicates orthologous relationships of many zebrafish and human CYPs, and also
indicates which zebrafish CYPs have no apparent homologs in humans. The lineage-specific diversification
makes possible the acquisition of new functions (subfunctionalization) and regulation. In most cases, however, functions of the individual paralogous CYPs in
zebrafish have yet to be determined. Those functions,
and the timing, location and magnitude of expression in
development will determine the strength of inference
from developmental toxicological studies with the zebrafish model.
Methods
Gene identification and sequence analysis

Cytochrome P450 genes were identified by hidden Markov model searches (HMMER v2.3.2; [108]) of the
ENSEMBL Zv6 and Zv7 gene predictions, using the global PFAM model for cytochrome P450 s (p450-ls).
Annotations were transferred to the Zv8 alignment
when it became available. Alignments were constructed
using Muscle v3.6b [109], and masked based on the
Muscle alignment scoring function. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed by analyzing inferred or confirmed
amino acid sequences using maximum likelihood
(RAxML 7.0.4, [110]). The WAG model of amino acid
substitution [111] with a gamma distribution of substitution rates was used in all Bayesian analyses (WAG
+G). Synteny was examined using the ENSEMBL and
UCSC browsers.
Animals

Tubingen long fin (TL) zebrafish were progeny of TLs
obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Mark Fishman,

Page 17 of 21

crossed with TLs raised from eggs obtained from the
Zebrafish International Resource Center at the University of Oregon (Eugene, OR, USA). Fish were maintained in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Zebrafish Facility and the experimental procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. The zebrafish were held in 2:1 female to
male groups at a density of ≤5 fish/l in aerated, filtered
and re-circulated system water (28.5°C) in 3 or 10 l
tanks in an Aquatic Habitat™system. The system water
was composed of Instant Ocean™(60 mg/l), sodium
bicarbonate (50 mg/l), calcium sulfate (8.5 mg/l) and
Kent’s Freshwater Essentials™(53 μl/l) in distilled water.
Fish were fed twice daily with brine shrimp (Artemia
salina) and once daily with Omega One flakes (Omega
Sea Ltd. Sitka, AK, USA).
Zebrafish embryos

TL embryos were obtained from group breedings of 30
female and 15 male fish. Fertilized TL zebrafish eggs
(100) were placed in 20 cm glass Petri dishes containing
50 ml of 0.3x Danieau’s solution. The embryos were
incubated at 28.5°C. At 24 hpf, the solutions were
replaced with fresh 0.3x Danieau’s solution and any
dead embryos were removed; mortality was normally
four or less per dish. For sampling, all embryos in a dish
were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
-80°C. Sampling times were 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpf.
Each of four dishes was maintained independently, as
biological replicates.
A separate collection of unfertilized eggs was taken to
determine the maternal contribution to transcript abundance of selected CYP genes, which could imply function in early development. Eggs were expressed from
gravid female zebrafish (n = 3) by gentle squeezing of
anesthetized fish, following published protocols [112].
Eggs that showed development of a perivitelline space
were considered mature eggs and were selected for
analysis.
Microarray

The Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) 4 ×
44k DNA gene expression microarray was used to probe
developmental gene expression. The original Agilent
gene set was missing many CYPs and other genes
involved in chemical defense. Probes for these genes
were custom designed using the Agilent eArray system
and added to the array. The individual microarrays had
21893 unique probes (excluding controls) printed in
duplicate.
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression
levels for all four replicates of each timepoint (3, 6, 12,
24, 36, and 48 hpf). Total RNA was extracted using the
Aurum Fatty and Fibrous Tissue kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,

Goldstone et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:643
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/643

CA). RNA samples were checked for quality using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and an Agilent
2100 BioAnalyzer. For each RNA sample, a single
microarray was hybridized with 750 ng Cy3 labeled
cDNA using Agilent’s standard conditions for singlecolor microarrays at the Whitehead Center for Microarray Technology. The Agilent Low-Input QuickAmp
Labeling Kit was used for labeling, the samples were
hybridized to a the custom Agilent 4 × 44K feature zebrafish microarray using the Agilent In situ Hybridization
Kit Plus, and labeled cDNA was combined with the Agilent 10× Control Targets (to identify microarray corners). Post-hybridization, microarray slides were washed
as per the Agilent In situ Hybridization Kit Plus. Arrays
were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner.
Microarray analysis

Analysis of raw microarray results was performed using
Agilent’s Feature Extraction software with background
detrending (spatial and multiplicative). The data were
then normalized using the non-linear scaling method
based on rank invariant probes of Schadt et al.
[113,114], commonly performed for Affymetrix microarray data by the dChip software [115] and performed for
our Agilent data by software developed by AGM. Briefly,
this method finds the microarray with the overall median Cy3 signal for use as a baseline microarray (here 12
hpf, replicate C) to which all other microarrays are normalized. For normalization, microarrays are each separately normalized to the baseline microarray by finding
Rank Invariant probes between the two microarrays
using the method outlined in Schadt et al. [113]. The
software develops a non-linear normalization curve for
each microarray and uses a piecewise linear running
median to normalize the data. Prior to normalization
any Cy3 values below 5 were set to 5 and after normalization the average normalized signal was calculated for
probes duplicated on the microarray. Probes were
removed from consideration when they exhibited saturation in any instance among the microarrays and duplicate probes, or when signals were not above
background, in all instances among the microarrays and
duplicate probes. Bayesian Estimation of Temporal Regulation (BETR; [89]) was used to analyze the developmental time series, as standard ANOVA is not
appropriate due to auto-correlation between time points.
Normalized Cy3 values for each probe were log transformed, median-centered, and analyzed using BETR
relative to 3 hpf.
Gene expression clustering was analyzed using MeV
(v4.3) [116]. Hierarchical K-means clustering of both
un-normalized and within-gene z-normalized mean gene
expression values (n = 4 biological replicates) was performed, assuming 10 clusters. A different measure of

Page 18 of 21

clusters was performed using the Cluster Affinity Search
Technique [91], setting the cluster affinity to 0.7 (0-1
scale).
Microarray data has been deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GEO accession
number GSE24840).
Real-time, quantitative RT-PCR

RNA quantity and quality were determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). cDNA was synthesized
using the Omniscript™ Reverse Transcriptase kit (Qiagen
Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), random hexamer primers
(Operon Biotechnologies Inc.) and the RNasin® RNase
inhibitor (Promega). Gene-specific PCR primers for zebrafish CYP, and ARNT2 were synthesized by Operon
Biotechnologies Inc (Table S1). (The ARNT2 primers
were designed to amplify a sequence common to
ARNT2a, b, and c [58]). Real time PCR was performed
using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) as previously described [58,62]. To ensure that a single product was amplified, melt curve analysis was performed
on the PCR products, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed after the PCR run for each
gene. The specificity of the CYP qPCR primer pairs was
tested by purifying and sequencing the cDNA products
of the final qPCR reactions.
A standard curve for each gene was generated by serially diluting plasmids containing the 100-150 bp region
amplified by the quantitative PCR primers. Total molecule numbers were calculated for each sample and
normalized to ARNT2 expression [58]. In the figures
data are shown as mean + standard deviation of the
mean (SD).
