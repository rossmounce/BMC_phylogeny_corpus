Abstract
Background: Several studies suggested that the diploid ancestor of the B genome of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat species
belongs to the Sitopsis section, having Aegilops speltoides (SS, 2n = 14) as the closest identified relative. However molecular
relationships based on genomic sequence comparison, including both coding and non-coding DNA, have never been investigated.
In an attempt to clarify these relationships, we compared, in this study, sequences of the Storage Protein Activator (SPA) locus
region of the S genome of Ae. speltoides (2n = 14) to that of the A, B and D genomes co-resident in the hexaploid wheat species
(Triticum aestivum, AABBDD, 2n = 42).
Results: Four BAC clones, spanning the SPA locus of respectively the A, B, D and S genomes, were isolated and sequenced.
Orthologous genomic regions were identified as delimited by shared non-transposable elements and non-coding sequences
surrounding the SPA gene and correspond to 35 268, 22 739, 43 397 and 53 919 bp for the A, B, D and S genomes, respectively.
Sequence length discrepancies within and outside the SPA orthologous regions are the result of non-shared transposable
elements (TE) insertions, all of which inserted after the progenitors of the four genomes divergence.
Conclusion: On the basis of conserved sequence length as well as identity of the shared non-TE regions and the SPA coding
sequence, Ae speltoides appears to be more evolutionary related to the B genome of T. aestivum than the A and D genomes.
However, the differential insertions of TEs, none of which are conserved between the two genomes led to the conclusion that
the S genome of Ae. speltoides has diverged very early from the progenitor of the B genome which remains to be identified.

Background
All cereal crop species are members of the grass (Poaceae)
family that is the fourth largest family of flowering plants.
With about 10 000 species growing under nearly all climates and latitudes, grasses exceed all other plant families
in ecological dominance and economic importance. In
terms of genome organisation they represent a very
diverse family with basic chromosome numbers ranging
from 4 to 50 and genome sizes ranging from 350 Mb to
17 Gb [1]. Fossil data and phylogenetic studies have estimated that the grasses have diverged from a common
ancestor 50 to 70 million years ago (MYA) [2,3]. Archaeological records suggest that farming started concomitantly in at least three widely separated regions between
10 000-5 000 years ago during the late Neolithic period.
The three most important cereals were independently
domesticated in three centres: wheat in south western Asia
in the 'Fertile Crescent' region, maize in Mexico and rice
in both south east Asia and west Africa [4-6].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/555

insertions are shared between the A or D genomes of polyploid wheat and their respective progenitors T. urartu and
Ae. tauschii [29-33]. No such studies have been yet
reported comparing the B genome of these polyploid
wheat species to that of its closest known diploid relative,
i.e. Ae. speltoides. In the present study, we compared for the
first time coding and non-coding sequences as well as
dynamics of TE insertions between the S genome of Ae.
speltoïdes and that of the A, B and D co-resident in the hexaploid wheat (T. Aestivum). The SPA (for Storage Protein
Activator [34]) locus region, belonging to BZIP (Basic Leucine Zipper), located on chromosome 1BL [35], has been
chosen because of its importance as trans-acting elements
of seed storage protein and its conservation in several
other cereals such as maize (Opaque 2 [36-38]), rice
(RISBZ1-5 [39]), and barley (BLZ1-2 [40,41]). Updating
phylogeny relationships and insights onto the origin of
the B genome are discussed.

Results
Within the Poaceae, the genera Aegilops and Triticum
include several diploid species (2n = 14) that, via allopolyploidization, produced several tetraploid and hexaploid
wheat species, most of which have been domesticated [79]. T. turgidum (2n = 28, AABB) was derived from a
hybridization event that happened (< 0.5 MYA) between
T. urartu, (2n = 14, AA), the diploid donor of the A
genome (here after gA), and another unknown species of
the Sitopsis section, donor of the B genome (here after gB),
for which the closest known relative is Ae. speltoides
[7,9,10]. The hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum, 2n = 42,
AABBDD) originated from an additional polyploidization
event between the early-domesticated tetraploid T. turgidum ssp dicoccum and the diploid donor of the D genome
(here after gD), Ae. tauschii (2n = 14, DD), 7 000 to 12 000
years ago (for review [11]). Several wheat phylogeny studies have tried to identify the progenitor of the B genome
of polyploid wheat based on cytology [12], nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA sequences [13-15] as well as chromosome rearrangement studies (i.e. common translocation
events) [16-24]. It remains controversial from those studies whether the progenitor of the B genome is a unique
Aegilops species (i.e. monophyletic) or whether this
genome resulted from an introgression of several parental
Aegilops species (i.e. polyphyletic origin). More recent and
representative molecular comparisons using germplasm
collections have shown that the B genome could be
related to several Ae. speltoides lines but not to other species of the Sitopsis section [25,26].
Transposable elements (TEs) have been shown since the
seventies to be well represented in the wheat genome,
~80% [27,28]. Comparative studies have shown that
beside the general conservation in coding sequences, no
TE insertions are conserved between the A, B and D
genomes of wheat whereas important proportion of TE

Organization of SPA locus region in the A, B, D and S
genomes
Three BAC clones spanning the SPA gene of the A, B and
D genomes of T. aestivum were screened from cv Renan
BAC library with PCR markers specific for each of the
three SPA genes [42]. Sequencing resulted in 113 460, 94
732 and 120 879 bp for, respectively, the A, B and D
genomes. Screening of an Ae. speltoides pooled BAC library
with the same SPA-specific PCR markers allowed us to
identify and sequence a BAC clone of 80 493 bp sequence
spanning the SPA locus gene. Annotation has been performed to identify and compare gene and repeat contents
of the four available genome sequences, graphically presented in Figure 1A. More details are also presented in
Additional File 1. As expected for wheat, the four genomic
sequences are very rich in TEs.

Overall, the 113 460 bp A genome sequence is structured
as 56 830 bp (50.1% of the sequence) of class I TE, 3 934
bp (3.5% of the sequence) of class II elements and 4.9%
of unclassified TE. Fourteen class I TEs are identified as
one incompletely sequenced (at the BAC sequence
extremity), five truncated (with a 5' or 3' truncated region
due to nested TE insertion), 4 relics (only visible through
alignment remnants), one fragmented (inserted by other
TEs, i.e. nested insertion) and three complete elements.
The class II TEs is represented as a complete CACTA element (CACTA_1_comp, cf Additional File 2) and three
MITEs (Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Element).
Besides the identification of TEs a pseudo tubulin gene
separated by 55 614 bp from the SPA gene was also identified, both genes covering 4.7% of the sequence.
The 94 732 bp B genome sequence is structured as 38 126
bp (40.2% of the sequence) of class I TEs, 22 602 bp
(23.9% of the sequence) of class II elements and 0.6% of

different genomes defining the 'SPA orthologous region'. Genes are numbered as follow: 1: Pseudo tubulin gene; 2: SPA; 3:
Putative cortical cell-delineating gene; 4: Putative kinesin gene. Eight class I TE displaying complete LTR and TSD suitable for
the estimation of the insertion dates are highlighted with red stars. (B) Multipipmaker alignment using the sequence of the SPA

unclassified elements. Twelve Class I elements are identified as two incompletes, six truncated, two relics, one fragmented and one complete element. The class II TEs
consists of two complete, one fragmented and one truncated CACTA (CACTA_1 to _4, cf Additional File 2) as well
as three MITEs. The SPA gene is the only gene identified
on the B genome sequence, representing 4.4% of the
sequence.

The 80 493 bp S genome sequence is structured as 54 965
bp (68.3% of the sequence) of class I TEs, and a single
MITE class II TE. Thirteen class I TEs are identified as one
incomplete, six truncated, four fragmented and two complete TEs (cf Additional File 2). As in the B genome
sequence, only the SPA gene, covering 4.3% of the annotated sequence, has been identified on the S genome
sequence.

The 120 879 bp D genome sequence is structured as 50
540 bp (41.8% of the sequence) of class I TEs, 9 446 bp
(7.8% of the sequence) of class II elements. Twenty-two
class I TEs are identified as two incomplete, eight truncated, eight relics, two fragmented and two complete elements. Class II TEs are represented as three truncated
CACTA elements (CACTA_1 to 3, cf Additional File 2),
one mutator relic and one MITE. Three genes have been
annotated on the D genome sequence, the SPA gene, a
putative kinesin and a putative cortical cell-delineating
gene, covering 5.2% of a 48 440 bp interval.

Identification and characterization of conserved
sequences
Alignment of the four genomic regions allows the identification of the 'SPA orthologous region', which we have
defined as the shared common regions delimitated by
conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) stretches (5' and 3'
locus boundaries) that do not correspond to TEs. The 'SPA
orthologous region' spans respectively 35 268 bp, 22 739
bp, 43 397 bp and 53 919 bp for the A, B, D and the S
genomes (cf grey boxes in the Figure 1A, 1B).

Conserved non-coding sequences (CNS) analysis
The conserved non-coding sequences consist of the four
shared sequence stretches, excluding the SPA gene itself
(from methionine start to the stop codon). The gB/gS
genome comparison shows the highest sequence identity
and cumulative length (89.9% over 11 976 bp) compared
to the other sequence comparisons, i.e. gA/gB (85.9% over
11 152 bp), gA/gD (87.9% over 10 838 bp), gA/gS (86.8%
over 10 597 bp), gB/gD (85.8% over 10 666 bp), and gD/
gS (85.3% over 10 039 bp) (cf Table 1). Nevertheless, only
a 824 bp sequence was shown to be conserved between
gS/gB (within the 11 976 bp of aligned sequence) and
absent from other genomes (highlighted with white
arrows in the Figure 1B). On the contrary, three sequence
stretches (respectively 168, 340 and 218 bp) are conserved
between the S, the A and/or D genomes and absent from
the B genome (cf Figure 1B, red arrows). Moreover,
although it represents the majority of the CNS comparisons, sequence conservation was not always the highest
between the S and B genomes across the CNS as 9 small
stretches (representing a total of 726 bp) of sequences
were more conserved between the S and the A and/or D

No genes, other than SPA can be predicted from these four
conserved sequence stretches. As coding and non-coding
sequences can evolve at different rates, we perform evolutionary analysis separately for the SPA CDS (CoDing
Sequence) and the remaining conserved non-coding
sequences (CNS).

tical) sequences, allows the identification of four conserved sequence stretches, highlighted by blue dotted
circles in the Figure 2. The majority of the remaining DNA
within the 'SPA orthologous region' (as well as outside the
flanking boundaries) is composed of class I and class II
TEs that were differentially inserted and/or deleted in each
of the four genomes (i.e. shown by diagonal breaks on the
dot plot in the Figure 2). The cumulative length of the
conserved sequence stretches, within the 'SPA orthologous region' of the four genomes are approximately similar between the genomes pairs gA/gB (15 118 bp), gA/gD
(14 677 bp), gA/gS (14 504 bp), gB/gD (14 628 bp), gB/
gS(15 877 bp), gD/gS (13 985 bp). These could be considered as the Aegilops-Triticum 'ancestral SPA Locus' covering
16 598 bp of cumulative length considering sequences
stretches conserved between at least two of the compared
sequence. Other stretches of sequence conservation were
observed outside the 'SPA orthologous region' when comparing pairs of genomes but these sequences were not
determined in the available BAC clone sequences of the
other genomes (data not shown). As we cannot rule out
whether these sequences were not covered in the
sequenced BAC clones or were not really conserved across
the four genomes, they were not considered in the evolutionary relationship analysis.

We also estimated divergence times on the basis of the
number of base substitutions (Ks) accumulated after the
split-time from the ancestor genome. Ks values were
obtained for the 6 pairwise alignment combinations
(Table 1). The lowest and highest Ks values correspond
respectively to the gB/gS (0.617, i.e. identifying the closest
related sequences), and gB/gD (1.037, i.e. the more divergent sequences).

Conserved coding sequences analysis: SPA gene structure and
evolution
SPA genes are structured as six exons (cf Additional File 2).
In wheat, SPA gene (and CDS) are respectively 3 426(1
218) bp, 3 486(230) bp, 3 796(1 212) bp, 4 080(1 233)
bp, long for A, B, D and S genes (hereafter designated
SPAgA, -gB, -gD and -gS genes). These SPA genes are composed of six exons ranging in size from 76 (SPAgA, -gB, gD, -gS exon 4) to 432 bp (SPAgA-gB-gS exon 1) and five
introns ranging in size from 92 (SPAgA, -gB, -gD intron 4)
to 1297 bp (SPAgD intron 5). All of exon-intron junction
sites obey the GT/AG rule as identified in other eukaryotic
genes. The relative organization of the exons and introns
is the same for the others SPA-like bZIP protein genes
characterized to date in cereal, i.e. the number of exons
and introns is conserved and individual introns occur at
relatively the same sites for the maize O2 [36-43], sorghum O2 [44], and barley Blz1 genes [40]. It is interesting
to note that the first and fifth introns of the homoeologous SPA genes are respectively much shorter and larger,
compare to the other cereal SPA-like bZIP protein genes
(cf Additional File 2).

We conducted a phylogenic analysis based on SPA CDS of
the four wheat genomes as well as that available from
other cereals. A graphical representation of these data is
shown in the Figure 3 with a classical phylogenic tree
including SPA homologs available from other cereals (cf
parameters in material and method) and illustrates that
wheat SPA and barley BLZ2 consists in the same Triticeae
subfamily in which Ae. speltoides and T. aestivum-gB SPA
sequences are linked on the same branch. Such phylogenic analysis shows that the lowest synonymous (Ks)
and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates were
obtained between Ae. speltoides and T. aestivum -gB, with
Ks (0.035+/-0.012) and Ka (0.035+/-0.006) values corresponding to a 3.5 to 7.2 MYA divergence time, while rates
obtained when Ae. speltoides is compared to -gA and -gD
are respectively Ks (0.065+/-0.016) and Ka (0.049+/0.007) values corresponding to 7.5 to 12.5 MYA divergence time; and Ks (0.089+/-0.019) and Ka (0.043+/0.007) values corresponding to 10.8 to 16.6 MYA divergence time (cf Table 1). This result strongly suggests that,

speltoides CDS is closest to the T. aestivum SPA-gB than the
two other homoeologous -gA and -gD sequences.
As reported by Guillaumie et al. [35], a stop codon TGA
(+19 bp from the ATG transcription initiation) site had
been identified in the SPA-gB sequence suggesting that it
might be no more functional. No proof of expression
could be also provided for the SPA gB haplotype presenting this stop codon as we were unable to find any corresponding ESTs. In order to clarify the apparition of the
TGA stop codon in the B genome, the stop codon allele
distribution was analyzed using 18 wheat genotypes
which cover, 1 diploid genome S (Ae. longissima), 11 tetraploid (3 T. turgidum durum, 3 T. turgidum dicoccoïdes, 2
T. turgidum dicoccum, 2 T. timophevii, 1 T. turgidum turgidum) and 6 hexaploid (T. aestivum cv soisson, arminda,
vilmorin, chinese spring, renan, recital) genotypes. Genotyping data demonstrate that the TGA allele is present at
50% in hexaploid wheat (T. cv soisson, vilmorin, renan) and
for the first time in one tetraploid (T. turgidum durum)
genotype over 11 tested and absent in Ae. longissima (cf
Additional file 3).

Differential transposable elements insertions and
evolution
Size discrepancies of the 'SPA orthologous regions' can be
attributed to differential TE insertions or eliminations (cf
Additional File 2 and Figures 1A and 2), which occurred
after the four genomes divergence. Hence, the size
increase observed for the 'SPA orthologous region' in Ae.
speltoides (35 268 bp) when compared to T. aestivum-gB
(22 739 bp) is due to 7 class I elements, i.e. 2 truncated
Angela solo-LTRs (soloLTR_Angela_1 and _3), one complete Angela (Angela_2), one truncated Rada (Rada_1), 2
fragmented LINEs (LINE_1 and _2) and one MITE (cf Figure 2 and Additional File 2). These TEs may correspond to
insertions, which occurred in the Ae. speltoides genome
after its divergence from the ancestor of the B genome as
they are dispersed between CNS stretches and not present
in the B genome of T. aestivum. Occurrence of eight class I
TEs displaying complete LTR and TSD (Target Site Duplication), identified in the four annotated genomes (highlighted with red stars in the Figure 1A) allows to estimate
the insertion dates, based on nucleotide substitution pattern analysis (cf material and method; Additional File 4).
Thus, the complete Angela_2 identified in Ae. speltoides
(gS) located in the 'SPA orthologous region' exhibits a
transition and tranversion value of 0.02 +/- 0.004 respectively associated with an estimated insertion time of 1.3 to
1.9 MYA. The youngest insertion time was observed for
the Angela_5 element annotated outside the 'SPA orthologous region' in the Ae. speltoides sequence, i.e. 0.6 to 1.1
MYA.

of (i) recurrent hexapolyploidization events or (ii) gene
flow through introgression between the different wheat
species with different ploidy levels [30-33].

We sequenced for the first time an Ae. speltoides genomic
region (SPA locus region) and compared it to orthologous
regions of the A, B and D genomes coresident in the hexaploid wheat T. aestivum at the SPA CDS, the CNS and the
TE insertion dynamics levels.

Differential pattern of CNS conservation
Our results reveal that, a large proportion of the remaining non-genes and non-transposable elements sequences
are highly conserved between the four genomes (CNS). At
the 'SPA orthologous region', excluding the SPA gene
itself, the gB/gS genome comparison shows the highest
sequence identity and cumulative length as well as the
lowest Ks value (89.9% over 11 976 bp with Ks = 0.617)
compared to the other sequences (cf Table 1). Thus, the S
genome was confirmed to be the closest to the B genome
in term of cumulative conserved sequence length as well
as identity as compared to any other pairwise genome
combinations. Small stretches of sequences, which were
more conserved between the S and/or the A and D
genomes (cf Figure 1B), do not contradict with the general
pattern of an overall higher CNS conservation between
the S and B genomes. This is the first time that we precisely
report close relationships between the S and B genomes
based on both coding and non-coding sequence comparisons. CNS (within introns or upstream regulatory
sequences), have been recently surveyed in cereals (maize
vs rice) and mammals (human vs mouse) [45,46]. It has
been shown that CNSs are more abundant in loci embedding regulatory genes such as transcription factors (as SPA
gene described in our study) and that despite divergence
from a common ancestors, grass genes have dramatically
fewer (5- to 20-fold) and smaller CNSs than mammalian
genes. One possible explanation is that, in contrast to vertebrate genomes, plant genomes have been subjected to
more rounds of whole genome duplications (polyploidization) events that have profoundly affected their organisation, the subfunctionalisation of duplicated genes
leading to a greater per gene loss of CNS [47].

SPA gene structure comparison and haplotype variability
The SPA gene is the only gene conserved across the four
genomes. A phylogenic analysis involving SPA protein
sequences from T. aestivum, Ae. speltoides, rice, barley,
maize, sorghum, Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum,
Petroselinum crispum, clearly identified a Triticeae outgroup
in which Ae. speltoides SPA sequence is more closely
related to T. aestivum-gB SPA than any other sequence
involved in the tree. Interestingly, in this study we showed
that the stop codon TGA allele, 19 bases downstream the
ATG transcription initiation site, previously identified in
the B genome of hexaploid wheat [42], is also present in
the tetraploid T. turgidum. This indicates that the stopcodon TGA SPA allele has been generated before the allohexaploidization event. The presence of both stop TGA
and TCA SPA alleles in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat
accessions provides further evidences for the hypothesis

Differential TE insertion dynamics
No class I or class II TE annotated within or outside the
'SPA orthologous region' is common when comparing
any two-genome combinations. The two WIS retrotransposons, displaying similar apparent insertion positions in
the 5' SPA locus boundaries of the A and D genomes correspond to independent insertions as Target Site Duplication (TSD) signature-motifs are distinct (respectively
TATTG and TGTGA). This is also confirmed by estimation
of their insertion dates with a transition and transversion
ratio of 0.0029+/-0.004 (i.e. insertion date of 1.9–2.6
MYA) and 0.012+/-0.003 (i.e. insertion date of 0.7–1.2
MYA) for respectively the A and D genome sequences (cf
Additional File 4). The differential insertion of TEs is surprisingly the case of the B and S genomes. Overall, we
count six (two class II TEs, one unclassified TE and three
MITEs) and eight (five class I TEs, two class II TEs and one

MITE) TEs differentially inserted in the B and S genomes
respectively (cf Figure 1A). The 'SPA orthologous region'
of the S genome has been invaded by retrotransposons,
whereas outside the 'SPA orthologous region' the B
genome seems to have a specific site for the insertion of
class II TEs (mainly CACTA elements representing 23.9%
of the sequence). Overall, we were able to estimate insertion dates for 8 retrotransposons. Out of them, only one
(Angela_2) has been inserted into the 'SPA orthologous
region' of Ae. speltoides, (estimated insertion date 1.3 to
1.9 MYA). Thus, the differential insertions of TEs in the S
genome might be posterior to the S and B genome progenitors divergence from a common ancestor 2.5 MYA, 3.5 in
the present study. Figure 4 retraces the process of TE differential insertion-deletions from a suggested TriticumAegilops 'ancestral SPA Locus' sequence of 16 598 bp that
has been subjected to intensive TE insertions in the A, D
and S genomes as compared to the B genome analysed in
the present study.
The progenitor enigma of the B genome of polyploid
wheat species
According to the two allopolyploidization events that
gave rise to T. aestivum, the D genomes of the hexaploid
wheat have diverged relatively recently from that of its
donnor Ae. tauschii (0.08–0.12 MYA) whereas divergence
of the A and B genomes from their respective progenitors
occurred much more earlier (< 0.5 MYA) [7,9,10]. For

almost 50 years, it remained controversial whether the
source of the B genome is unique (i.e. monophyletic origin) related to Ae. speltoides or whether this genome
resulted from an introgression of several parental Aegilops
species (i.e. polyphyletic origin) [9,12-24,48]. Recent data
on molecular comparisons using germplasm collections
clearly show that the B genome could be related to several
Ae. speltoides lines but not to other species of the Sitopsis
section [25,49].
Comparison between the A genome of polyploid wheat
species to that of its progenitor T.urartu at the PSR920
region [32] has shown a very high CDS conservation
(99.5% of sequence identity at the third base of codons
and 99.6% for introns). Moreover, Dvorak et al. [32]
found in the 103 kb intergenic sequences four conserved
TEs (inserted prior to their divergence) whereas four and
one other TEs were respectively inserted in the A genome
of T. urartu and that of T. durum, after their divergence
from a common ancestor. Our present comparison based
on CDS and CNS confirms that the B genome is closer to
the S genome of Ae. speltoides than the A and D genomes.
However, SPA sequence divergence and the differential
insertions/deletions of TEs, none of which is conserved
between the two genomes, indicate that Ae. speltoids have
diverged very early (> 3MYA, in our study) from the B
genome progenitor.

Conclusion
The present study based on detailed CDS, CNS and TE
dynamics comparisons, clearly shows that evolutionary
relationship between the B genome and the S genome of
Ae. speltoides is not as close as it has been reported in the
literature for the A genome of polyploid wheat species
compared to its identified progenitor, T. urartu. Thus, a B
genome progenitor remains to be identified.

Methods
BAC Clone Isolation
A BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes) library from T.
aestivum cv renan [50] and Ae. speltoides BAC library (Chalhoub et al., unpublished) were screened with SPA PCR
markers [34,42]. Assignment to the A, B, or D genomes of
the BAC clones from the hexaploid species was based on
their further characterization by HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphisms and specific PCR primers
[42]. To ensure maximum coverage of the SPA locus, the
longest BAC clones for the A (Ren1424A05, Accession#:
FM242575), B (Ren0871J20, Accession#: FM242576), D
(Ren2409K09, Accession#: FM242578) and S (Sho429K3, Accession#: FM242577) genomes were sequenced.
BAC sequencing and annotation
BAC shotgun sequencing was performed at the Centre
National de Sequencage (Evry, France). Genes and
repeated elements (TEs and short repeats) were identified
by computing and integrating results based on BLAST
algorithms [51,52], predictor programs, and different
software detailed as follows.
Gene structure analysis
Gene structures and putative functions were identified by
combining results of BLASTN and BLASTX alignments
against dbEST http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and SwissProt databases http://expasy.org/sprot/, with results of 2
gene predictor programs, Eugene [53] with rice (Oryza
sativa) training version and FgeneSH [54] (with default
parameters http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml. To
incorporate heterologous information, we only recovered
potential gene coding sequences. The CDS (CoDing
Sequence) structures correspond to a consensus derived
from the three preceding information sources. The gene
content parameter represents the sum of known genes,
hypothetical genes, unknown genes, and pseudogenes.
Known genes were named based on BLASTX results
against proteins with known functions (SwissProt). CDSs
were considered as (i) hypothetical genes if their identification was only based on the predictors (as a consensus of
the structures suggested by both predictors), without any
evidence of putative function based on BLASTX results;
(ii) unknown genes if the identification was only based on
matching ESTs, without any evidence of putative function
based on BLASTX results; (iii) pseudogenes if frame shifts

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/555

need to be introduced within the CDS structure to better
fit a putative function based on BLASTX results. Truncated
pseudogenes, (genes disrupted by large insertion or deletion) and highly degenerated CDS sequences were considered as gene relics.
Transposable elements (TE)
TEs were detected by comparison with two databases of
repetitive
elements:
TREP
([55];
http://
wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/Repeats/), and Repbase ([56];
Core
http://www.girinst.org/Repbase_Update.html).
domains (nucleic coordinates of known elements) were
identified through BLASTN alignments against TREPnr.
LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats) and TE boundaries were
identified through BLASTN alignments against Repbase.
Putative polyproteins were identified by BLASTX alignments against TREPprot. We used 1e-04 as a cutoff for
BLASTN alignment results (either on TREPnr or Repbase).
No cut-off was imposed for BLASTX results on TREPprot.
Nested insertions of TEs were considered only when complete reconstruction of the split element was possible with
no ambiguity. Other TE structures (either novel or highly
degenerated TEs) were identified within the remaining
unassigned DNA either by LTR_STRUC [57] or by BLASTX
against
the
NCBI
nr
database
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. When it was possible (i.e. for
complete TEs), target-site duplications were indicated in
the commentary of the element.

Pairwise comparisons of the four BAC clones, including
the analysis of each BAC sequence against itself, were performed using the program Dotter [58] in order to identify
or confirm direct repeats, LTRs, local duplications, and
deletion events as well as MITEs. Multiple sequences comparisons were performed with PIPMAKER software [59].
As a final screening, unassigned DNA (free of annotated
genes or TEs) was aligned using BLASTX against the NCBI
nonredundant database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
This BLASTX analysis allows the extension of several TE
features already identified. TEs were classified and named
based on the unified classification from Wicker et al. [60]
according to referred nomenclature (i.e., element name,
BAC name, appearance rank) and designed as complete,
truncated, and degenerated sequences as suggested by
TREP or Repbase databases.
Short repeated motifs
Short repeated motifs were identified either as inverted
repeats (by using EINVERTED with default parameters;
http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/ein
verted) or tandem repeats (Tandem Repeat Finder, with
default
parameters;
http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/
trf.advanced.submit.html). Only repeated domains (i.e.
tandem or inverted) longer than 100 bp were kept in our
annotation results.

Phylogeny analysis
The phylogenetic analysis was performed using Neighborjoining method with clustalx alignment of protein
sequences with 1 000 repetition bootstraps. The BLOSUM
62 matrix was chosen for substitution identification. The
sequence divergence datation was performed based on the
rate of nonsynonymous (Ka) vs. synonymous (Ks) substitutions calculated with MEGA-3 [63]. The average substitution rate (r) of 6.5 × 10-9 substitutions per synonymous
site per year for grasses was used to calibrate the ages of
the considered gene ([64,65]. The time (T) since gene
insertion was estimated using the formula T = Ks/r.
Determination retrotransposons insertion dates
Full-length retrotransposons were analysed by comparing
their 5' and 3' LTR sequences in order to date their insertion time [65] based on the assumption that the two LTRs
of a single element are identical at the time of insertion.
The two LTRs were aligned and the number of transition
and transversion mutation were counted. The insertion
times were dated using the Kimura parameter method
(K2P, [66]) and a mutation rate of 6.5 × 10-9 substitutions
per synonymous site per year [64]. The time (T) since element insertion was estimated using the formula T = K2P/
2r.
