sequencing and development of SiESTa, the
Silene EST annotation database

Abstract
Background: The genus Silene is widely used as a model system for addressing ecological and evolutionary
questions in plants, but advances in using the genus as a model system are impeded by the lack of available
resources for studying its genome. Massively parallel sequencing cDNA has recently developed into an efficient
method for characterizing the transcriptomes of non-model organisms, generating massive amounts of data that
enable the study of multiple species in a comparative framework. The sequences generated provide an excellent
resource for identifying expressed genes, characterizing functional variation and developing molecular markers,
thereby laying the foundations for future studies on gene sequence and gene expression divergence. Here, we
report the results of a comparative transcriptome sequencing study of eight individuals representing four Silene
and one Dianthus species as outgroup. All sequences and annotations have been deposited in a newly developed
and publicly available database called SiESTa, the Silene EST annotation database.
Results: A total of 1,041,122 EST reads were generated in two runs on a Roche GS-FLX 454 pyrosequencing
platform. EST reads were analyzed separately for all eight individuals sequenced and were assembled into contigs
using TGICL. These were annotated with results from BLASTX searches and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and
thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were characterized. Unassembled reads were kept as
singletons and together with the contigs contributed to the unigenes characterized in each individual. The high
quality of unigenes is evidenced by the proportion (49%) that have significant hits in similarity searches with the A.
thaliana proteome. The SiESTa database is accessible at http://www.siesta.ethz.ch.
Conclusion: The sequence collections established in the present study provide an important genomic resource for
four Silene and one Dianthus species and will help to further develop Silene as a plant model system. The genes
characterized will be useful for future research not only in the species included in the present study, but also in
related species for which no genomic resources are yet available. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of
massively parallel transcriptome sequencing in a comparative framework as an approach for developing genomic
resources in diverse groups of non-model organisms.

Background
The genus Silene (Caryophyllaceae) consists of several
hundred species with a mainly holarctic distribution.
Because species vary widely in their breeding system, sex
determination and ecology, the genus has historically

played an important role in genetic and ecological studies
dating back to Mendel and Darwin. More recently the
genus has emerged as a model system in plant ecology,
evolution, genetics and developmental biology [1]. However, a major limitation of using Silene as model system
is the near absence of genomic information pertaining to
the genus. Recently the first EST library was published
[2], based on normalized cDNA sequences derived from
different reproductive tissues of the dioecious species

Silene latifolia. In S. latifolia, sex is determined by
heteromorphic sex chromosomes. As in mammals,
S. latifolia males are heterogametic (XY) and females are
homogametic (XX). In contrast to the evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes which evolved about 150 million years ago (my) [3], the age of S. latifolia sex
chromosomes has been estimated to be about 10 my [4].
The overwhelming majority of Silene species are however
not dioecious and lack sex chromosomes. These species
are either hermaphroditic or gynodioecious, such as in
the case of the widely distributed bladder campion S. vulgaris. The relatively recent evolution of sex chromosomes
in S. latifolia and the availability of closely related species
without sex chromosomes, make the genus an ideal target for studying the evolution of sex chromosomes.
The closest relatives of S. latifolia are a group of dioecious species, including S. marizii and S. dioica, with
which S. latifolia often hybridizes upon secondary contact
[5]. The two species occupy different habitats [6] and differ in flower color and odor [7]. As is frequently the case
in pairs of closely related plant species where multiple
barriers contribute to reproductive isolation [8,9], reproductive isolation between S. dioica and S. latifolia is
incomplete, and the occurrence of gene flow across species
boundaries leads to porous genomes [10]. A recent population genomic analysis revealed that neutral processes,
introgression and adaptive divergence shape species differences [11]. However, the extent to which genes underlying
floral trait or habitat differences contribute to adaptive
divergence has never been investigated. A major hindrance
to investigate the genetic causes of adaptive divergence is
that the Silene genome remains largely unexplored. The
present study tackles this problem by comparative highthroughput transcriptome sequencing of Silene latifolia,
S. dioica, S. marizii, S. vulgaris and Dianthus superbus.
The sequences generated in this study are annotated and
publicly available through SiESTa, the Silene EST annotation database http://www.siesta.ethz.ch.
Silene and Dianthus species vary greatly in genome size
and have different haploid chromosome numbers (n = 12
and n = 15 respectively). With a haploid genome size of
about 2,646 Mbp [12], the S. latifolia genome is similar
in size to corn (about 2,671 Mbp) [13]. In contrast, the
genome size of S. vulgaris (1,103 Mbp) [14] is less than
half that of S. latifolia and some Dianthus species have
even smaller genomes (613 Mbp) [15]. Thus, genome
sizes differ by a factor of two between Dianthus and
S. vulgaris and by a factor of four between Dianthus and
S. latifolia.
To further develop genomic resources for the genus
Silene, and especially for the dioecious species related to
S. latifolia, we performed comparative high-throughput
transcriptome sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing
technology. This method is increasingly used for EST

sequencing in both animals [16-18] and plants [19-21].
Advantages over conventional Sanger sequencing based
EST projects are the large amount of data generated per
run and the fact that cloning is not required as an initial
step, factors which substantially reduce the time, labor
and cost involved [22,23].
Here we present the results of comparative transcriptome sequencing in seven Silene individuals representing
four species, and one Dianthus outgroup. These species
are closely related and include species with and without
sex chromosomes, also differing substantially in genome
size. A total of 1,041,122 EST reads, totaling 242,341,741
bp, were obtained from two complete 454 pyrosequencing
runs and processed and assembled in the SiESTa database.
These ESTs provide a unique and novel resource for ecological and evolutionary studies in Silene and Dianthus.

Results and Discussion
SiESTa database characteristics

454 pyrosequencing of eight individual cDNA libraries
derived from one Silene latifolia male (SlM) and two
females (SlF, SlFf), one S. dioica male (SdM) and female
(SdF), one S. marizii male (SmM), and one individual of
the each of the hermaphroditic species S. vulgaris (SvH)
and Dianthus superbus (Ds) lead to a total of 1,041,122
EST reads. The number of nucleotides sequenced per
library varied between 25 million and 46 million in SlFf
and Ds respectively (Table 1). In contrast to studies using
normalized libraries [17,19,21,24], we used non-normalized libraries with the advantage of searches not identifying weakly expressed genes and a reduced chance of
finding alternative splicing variants [25]. However, these
factors may negatively impact upon the ability to build
contigs. Our reads were assembled into 93,627 contigs
(38,256,084 bp) and 309,074 singletons (69,524,702 bp),
with an overall total of 402,701 unigenes (107,780,786 bp)
that were deposited in a newly developed database called
SiESTa (Silene EST annotations) (Table 1). All reads may
be accessed under the accession number ERP000371 in
the NCBI Sequence Read Archive and all contigs are available in Genbank Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA)
under the accession numbers JL382689 - JL473671. The
unigenes were sorted into eight individual libraries with an
average size of 130,140 ESTs and 11,703 contigs per
library. Two super-libraries, supSL and supSD, containing
the sequences of S. latifolia and S. dioica individuals,
respectively, were also created. Their sizes are 129,456 and
129,252 superunigenes respectively.
As reported elsewhere in recent studies [18,21,24] short
EST reads from 454 sequencing runs may be assembled
and annotated to effectively characterize the gene space of
non-model organisms. Average read length in our study
was 232 bp, close to the lengths obtained in other recent
studies that used the GS-FLX platform for sequencing

[17,18,21], but substantially longer than early studies that
used the GS-20 platform where read lengths were 100 to
110 bp [16,19,21]. Between 47% and 91% of EST reads
were assembled into contigs (for SdM and Ds respectively), while the remainder were kept as singletons (Table
1). Similar percentages of reads assembled into contigs
were found in other studies, ranging from 40% to 48%
[19,25] to 88% and 90% [16-18,21] in both plants and animals. The frequency distribution of ESTs per unigene
showed a hyperbolic distribution (Additional file 1), with a
single EST read available for most unigenes (singletons),
whereas only a small proportion of unigenes include a
large number of EST reads. Given that our libraries were
not normalized, one can use the number of ESTs per unigene as an estimate of expression level [26]. This implies
that the unigenes composed of many EST reads are highly
expressed. An analysis of the ten most strongly expressed
genes (i.e. the unigenes with the highest numbers of EST
reads) in each library revealed that these correspond to
only fifteen different genes (Additional file 2). Of these,
two were found in more than four out of the eight libraries
analyzed. Our results indicate that one of these genes
codes for an alpha-tubulin homologue of Arabidopsis
thaliana (present in SlM, SlFf, SdM, SdF, SvH, Ds) and
the second for a homologue of a predicted ORF in Pinus
koraiensis (present in SlM, SdM, SdF, Ds) (Additional file
2). Most of these genes are housekeeping genes that are
known to be highly expressed [27-30].
GO annotations revealed that a large number of contigs had a term assigned to them. Of the 93,048 contigs
tested (from supSL, supSD, SmM, SvH and Ds), 46,217
were annotated with a GO term. The large number of
GO terms annotated in the libraries (53%) further confirms the quality of the contigs of our database.
A comparison of the ten most represented GO annotations reveals substantial homogeneity in the composition of our libraries (Figure 1 and Additional file 3).
In addition, the analysis of the ten most represented
gene groups, based on the most expressed GO Slim for
plants [31], confirmed the homogeneity of gene expression in the buds of the different species studied (Table 2).

Not surprisingly, genes involved in cellular component
organization translation and transcription are highly
expressed in all our individuals.
Ninety-nine percent of the unigenes have an ORF predicted by prot4EST (Table 3). About 45% of the predictions are based on BLAST similarities, 28% are
predicted by ESTScan and the remaining 27% correspond to the longest reading frames of the sequences.
The Silene genome is known to include a large number
of repeated elements [32-34] and we had to filter out
such elements because they contribute to assembly problems. On average, 23,000 reads per library matched
repeated elements (data not shown). Numerous repeated
elements have recently been identified in S. latifolia [32],
which make easier contig construction even a large diversity of elements still remains to be characterized.
Our newly developed EST resources for Silene and
Dianthus, with 130,140 ESTs on average, are comparable to the resources available for Helianthus annuus
(133,684 ESTs) and for Populus trichocarpa (89,943
ESTs) [NCBI EST database of October 1, 2010].
The SiESTa database

The newly developed SiESTa database provides several
tools that facilitate data and information extraction.
The first tool is the unigene search engine (Unisearch),
which allows to enter a list of unigene or superunigene
names. From these, the user directly obtains the link
to the sequence annotations and can download all
sequences in fasta format. The second tab called
“Libraries” allows users to navigate the database. Information about the different libraries, including species
identity and tissue used, sex of the individual and the
total number of unigenes/superunigenes in the library
are presented in a table. By selecting the link on the
unigene number, the user may download the complete
set of unigenes from each library. The link attached to
the library name enables the user to access the unigene
table which lists unigenes, their lengths, the number of
ESTs per unigene and the best hit with Uniprot.
Selecting any unigene provides access to the unigene

Homology with plant model species

In order to annotate and evaluate the quality of our reads
and of our assemblies, we performed BLASTX searches to
align both contigs and singletons from each library with
A. thaliana, Vitis vinifera and Populus trichocarpa proteomes and Uniprot (Tables 4). On average, 49% of the
contigs and 27% of the singletons had a significant hit to
the A. thaliana proteome. We evaluated the redundancy
of the hits and found that on average 32% and 18% of contigs and singletons respectively match strictly different
A. thaliana protein sequence. These non-redundant protein sequences (noted ‘unique’ in Table 4) revealed that

percentage is calculated as the number of reads included in contigs matching
a term divided by the total number of reads included in all contigs. Terms are
sorted by the total expression common to all libraries in descending order.

some of our unigenes could come from distinct regions of
the same gene. Compared to the proportions of hits with
A. thaliana, we noticed an increase of the average percentage of matches for both contigs and singletons respectively, with V. vinifera (+0.2% and +1.9%), P. trichocarpa
(+1.9% and +5.7%) and with Uniprot (+8.8% and +14.7%).
Nevertheless, even though most of the Silene genes have a
match with the three model species, across all libraries, an
average of 62, 87 and 189 hits are exclusive to the proteomes of A. thaliana, V. vinifera or P. trichocarpa,
respectively (Table 5). Such differences among the investigated proteomes might suggest that P. trichocarpa is more
closely related to Silene than A. thaliana and V. vinifera.
However, the phylogeny of angiosperms compiled by Bremer and coworkers [35] reveals that Silene (Caryophyllales) is phylogenetically equally distant from Vitis
(Vitales), Populus (Malpighiales) and Arabidopsis (Brassicales). The causes of these observed differences are currently unknown, but a possible explanation may be
differential gene loss during the evolution of these plant
lineages as observed in other plants [36,37].

databases (Additional file 4). Of these 34,848 contigs,
22,365 were found only in a single library, whereas
12,483 contigs correspond to sequences found in more
than one library. After removing redundancies, 4,931
unigenes remained that had no significant hit in
BLASTX searches against Uniprot and were found in at
least two libraries. A substantial proportion of these unigenes (69%) had similarities with additional repeated
elements identified from S. latifolia (J. Macas, unpublished results) and were removed. The remaining 1,467
contigs were compared with the EST library reported by
Moccia et al. [2], and 14% of these contigs had a significant hit. For some of the corresponding ESTs of Moccia
et al. [2] there is a significant hit with Uniprot, most
likely because these sequences were longer and contained coding sequences, and we were able to infer
homology for 56 contigs. After removing one further
transposon homologue and 40 sequences consisting of
UTR regions, only 15 sequences had a good homology
with gene coding regions, but 7 of them had undetermined functions. Of the remaining contigs, 1,411
sequences looked like potential Caryophyllaceae-specific
genes (Figure 2). Yang and coworkers [38] recently
investigated species-specific genes in the A. thaliana, P.
trichocarpa and Oryza sativa proteomes. Inter-proteome
comparisons revealed that 165 of 26,784 proteins (0.6%)
are exclusive to A. thaliana, as these proteins have no
homologue in either P. trichocarpa or O. sativa and also
in Carica, Glycine, Medicago, Sorghum, Vitis and Zea
(similar results are indicated in P. trichocarpa and O.
sativa). Similarly, we searched our libraries for genes

that are specific for Silene or Dianthus. We have identified 1,411 sequences from our studied species that may
correspond to Caryophyllaceae-specific genes. These
sequences represent about 1.5% of all contigs. The proportions of species-specific proteins identified by Yang
et al. [38] in A. thaliana, P. trichocarpa and O. sativa
are 0.6%, 0.2% and 1.1% respectively. Our estimate is
also less than 2%, but we do not have a sequenced genome available, and consequently, some genes are certainly missing in the calculation and some may have
been counted more than once. Possible biases introduced in our estimates include that 1) we used contigs
built from cDNA sequences. These are different from
full-length protein sequences because they are oftentimes only fragments of coding sequences and it is possible that different contigs contain non-overlapping
regions of the same gene as revealed by Table 4. 2) Singletons were not included in this analysis because their
quantity prevented computation. 3) The lack of wellannotated genome sequences of species closely related
to Silene reduced chances to find more homologous
sequences. 4) Our EST libraries were non-normalized,
and it is thus possible that further Caryophyllaceae-specific genes were missed because they were not sufficiently expressed to be represented in our database.
Points 2 and 4 might increase the proportion of Caryophyllaceae-specific genes while points 1 and 3 might
decrease it. Further studies will reveal whether these
sequences are indeed specific to Silene and what their
functions are. For this purpose, our SiESTa database
provides a valuable resource.
SNP detection, validation and heterozygosity estimates

Figure 2 Identification of potential Caryophyllaceae-specific
genes. The first step identifies sequences without known
homologues in reference species; the second and the third steps
select sequences that are found in at least two SiESTa libraries.
Sequences that partially match repeated elements are removed. In
our final step we compared the remaining sequences with the
Silene EST library of Moccia et al. [2] to identify potential
Caryophyllaceae-specific genes.

QualitySNP predicted between 4,500 and 12,000 polymorphic sites in our eight libraries, the results of SNP
analysis for each individual library being presented in
Table 6. There are on average 31 SNPs per 10,000 bp of
expressed sequences in Silene and Dianthus and most
SNPs are substitutions (78.6%).
Of the 48 polymorphic positions predicted by qualitySNP that were selected for validation, 32 (67%) of
SNPs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of PCR products. Polymorphic positions that are not associated with
single-nucleotide repeats were selected for validation,
because pyrosequencing is known to experience difficulties in sequencing these regions [39]. We observed that
such regions often induce incorrect predictions of SNPs
by qualitySNP. From our SNP data we cannot directly
estimate nucleotide diversity, because our SNP estimates
are based on reads from single individuals. However, the
detected polymorphisms allow estimating heterozygosity
in the different species. Polymorphism varies between 19
and 43 SNPs per 10 kb of expressed sequences for SlF
and SlFf respectively (Table 6). Similar values were

reported in maize [20], with between 33 and 47 SNPs per
10 kb, in Oryza sativa [40], with around 30 SNPs per 10
kb, and in A. thaliana [41], with around 40 SNPs per 10
kb. By analyzing 27 genes in Silene latifolia, a recent
study estimated a polymorphism rate of about 551 SNPs
per 10 kb [42], which is ten times higher than in other
plants. The origin and the large number of individuals
sampled in that study is probably the reason for these
high estimates. Our results suggested that there is no difference in the proportion of heterozygous positions
between the dioecious species and the gynodioecious species in the genus Silene (mean of 0.32 and 0.3 respectively). However, a lower level of heterozygosity was
detected in the S. latifolia female library SlF (0.19) compared to other libraries. SIF belongs to an inbred line,
which explains the low polymorphism exhibited by this
individual. On the contrary, an increase of polymorphism
was detected in the F1 individual SlFf, which was
obtained by crossing the two other S. latifolia plants, SlM
and SlF. Polymorphisms detected in this individual provide valuable markers for the development of a linkage
map for S. latifolia and its sex chromosomes.

Conclusions
The high quality EST database SiESTa provides valuable
resources for molecular ecologists studying Caryophyllaceae, particularly for the genus Silene. It provides the
necessary molecular resources to develop microsatellite
and SNP markers for linkage mapping and population
genetic analyses, provides access to candidate genes for
specific traits, such as heavy metal tolerance or flower
color variation, and enables identification of × and Ylinked gene copies. Moreover this online database http://
www.siesta.ethz.ch provides access to sequences and annotations of four Silene and one Dianthus species lacking
fully-sequenced genomes. The two 454 sequencing runs
described in this study generated more than one million
sequencing reads, allowing for the identification of about
74,000 genes and about 56,000 SNPs. We hope that the
availability of these resources will encourage further investigations into the genomics and evolutionary biology of
Silene and related species.

Methods
RNA extraction & cDNA sequencing

We extracted RNA from one flower bud belonging to
eight individuals of five closely related species; three
dioecious species: Silene latifolia, S. dioica and S. marizii
and two gynodioecious species: S. vulgaris and Dianthus
superbus. For S. latifolia and S. dioica, both sexes were
included in this study, whereas for S. marizii, only a male
individual was used. For the two gynodioecious species,
we used flowers from hermaphrodite individuals.
Flower buds prior to anthesis were collected from
plants grown in a greenhouse under long day conditions
at the ETH Zurich and were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Flower buds of Dianthus superbus were
collected in the field (Davos, Switzerland) and immediately placed in RNALater (Ambion) and stored at room
temperature for three days. Total RNA was isolated
using TriFast (PeqLab), stored in liquid nitrogen, and
sent to GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany) for library
construction. cDNA was prepared using the SMART™
PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech), concatenated by
ligation, nebulized, tagged and sequenced using the GS
FLX protocol (Roche). Two tagged libraries were combined in half a picotiter plate for sequencing.
EST processing

All sequences were generated in two complete runs on a
Roche GS-FLX 454 pyrosequencing machine and eight
fasta files containing trimmed reads were extracted from
the sff files. Short reads (< 50 nt), as well as reads
derived from mitochondria and plastids were removed
using SeqClean [43]. Repeated elements were then
removed using RepeatMasker [44] with a Viridiplantae
database compiled in RepBase (01/08/2008 version) [45]
to which we added the Silene latifolia - specific repeated
elements identified by Cermak and coworkers [32]. EST
reads were then clustered and contigs built using
TGICL [46] with the default parameters (95% of identity
and 40 bp minimum for sequence overlap). In addition
to the resulting contigs, the remaining singletons
(unique EST reads) were then added to the database as
unigenes.

We constructed separate EST libraries from all eight
individuals used in this project: a Silene latifolia male
(SlM), two S. latifolia females, which are “mother” and
“daughter” (respectively SlF and SlFf), one male and female
each of S. dioica (SdM and SdF, respectively), a S. marizii
male (SmM), as well as one individual each of S. vulgaris
(SvH) and Dianthus superbus (Ds). Additionally, two
super-libraries were constructed that combine sequences
from the three S. latifolia (called supSL) and the two
S. dioica individuals (supSD), respectively. Due to large
demand placed on CPU use, ESTs from chloroplast and
mitochondrial genes were removed from the assembly
process for supSL, thereby reducing the number of reads
used from 365,089 to 347,047.

score threshold: 55; Evidence code weights: default). In
order to complete the functional annotation (based on
BLAST) with protein domain information, InterproScan
[52] was run (based on the longest unigene’s ORF) and
GO terms associated with protein domains were merged
with the GO terms kept at the annotation step.
We used the tools provided by the GO consortium to
build our own GO database dedicated to our species by
loading the ‘unigene products - GO’ association files
found with Blast2GO [http://www.geneontology.org/
godatabase/archive/full/2009-03-01/]. To search and
browse the gene ontology and visualize the gene products associated with a particular GO term, we implemented an instance of the Amigo browser [http://www.
geneontology.org/GO.tools.browsers.shtml].

Unigene annotation

Similarity searches were carried out in two steps, the
first of which involved BLAST similarity searches [47] of
the contig sequences versus Uniprot (UniProt Rel. 13 =
SWISS-PROT 55 + TrEMBL 38, 29 April 2008) and
added the annotation results to the database. Because of
the large number of contigs being searched for similarities, we used PC clusters at the French National Institute of Nuclear Physics and Physics of Particles located
in Lyon (IN2P3). In our second step, BLASTX searches
against the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome were then
performed and the results included in the database. In
both steps, the E-value cut-off used was 1E-04 and the
five best hits were included in the SiESTa database.
Prot4EST [48] was then used to predict open reading
frames (ORFs) using the following criteria: 1) if a unigene
had a significant BLAST hit with Uniprot, the ORF from
the best hit was used as template for ORF prediction; 2) if
the unigene had no BLAST hit, ESTScan [49] predicted
peptides that were used to predict ORFs. We used Arabidopsis thaliana as ‘training model’ for ESTScan prediction
(codon usage matrix from May 2009 [50]); 3) if EST Scan
failed to predict any peptides, the longest ORF from the 6frame was retained. In addition to prot4EST predictions,
we retained all ORFs that were at least 180 bp long when
they were in a different reading frame than the prediction
done at step 2) and 3). We ran prot4EST on individual
libraries Ds, SmM and SvH, and on the super-libraries
supSL and supSD. Predicted ORFs were added to the database. Gene ontology (GO) annotation was carried out
using Blast2GO [51]. In the mapping step, a pool of candidate GO terms was obtained for each unigene by retrieving GO terms associated with the 20 first BLAST hits
(BLASTX against NCBI nr: E-value cut-off: 1e-3; HSP coverage percentage: 0.33). In the annotation step, reliable
GO terms were then selected from the pool of candidate
GO terms by applying the core annotation function of
Blast2GO. Default parameters were used (GO weights: 5;

Homology investigation

Annotation of the unigenes led to the identification of
two major groups of unigenes: the first one with
matches to Uniprot and the second without matches.
We used the contigs in the first group to estimate the
proportion of homologous genes shared with the plant
model species Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera and
Populus trichocarpa.
We then used unigenes of the second group, i.e. unigenes for which no hits with Uniprot were obtained, to
assess whether potentially new, Caryophyllaceae-specific
genes could be found. To avoid spurious results, we
removed all unigenes in this group that were found only
in a single individual. To do so, we performed pairwise
BLASTN searches between libraries and removed all
sequences without hits in other libraries. From the
sequences with hits in other libraries, we kept only one
sequence for further analysis. Finally, using the database
recently developed by Macas and coworkers (unpublished results) of newly identified S. latifolia repeated
elements, we tested whether the remaining contigs contained repeated elements that were not removed by
RepeatMasker. When more than 20% of the contig
length resulted from repeated elements, contigs were
discarded. We then compared the remaining sequences
with the EST library developed by Moccia and coworkers [2]. This EST library was established by standard
Sanger sequencing of a normalized cDNA library. It
contains only 3105 unigenes, but these are on average
longer than our 454-based unigenes. Moreover, these
unigenes were used in the construction of a custom
cDNA microarray that has been used in expression analyses by Aria Minder (unpublished results). This comparison firstly allowed us to identify homology that we
missed due to the commutative property of homologies
and secondly, to assess the proportion of genes that lack
annotation which are expressed in S. latifolia.

SNP detection, validation and heterozygosity estimation

SNPs were identified using qualitySNP [53], a haplotypebased SNP finder that groups sequences sharing the
same nucleotides at each polymorphic site using the
resulting clusters defined with CAP3 [54] and predicts if
the SNP position is supported. We used the CAP3 clusters build during TGICL assembly. We ran qualitySNP
with the default parameters on the contigs of each individual library. The software searched for polymorphisms
in contigs formed by at least four ESTs and identified
all potential SNPs that occurred at least twice. Tips of
each sequence (30 bp in 5’ end and 20% of sequence
length in 3’ end) were set as low quality (LQ) regions
and the rest as high quality regions following the
method used by Tang and coworkers [53]. Only high
quality SNPs with a minimum score of two were
retained. Since we did not search for polymorphisms
common to individuals but rather within individuals,
SNPs identified by qualitySNP were used to estimate
heterozygosity within each individual.
In order to confirm their quality, substitutional SNPs
identified by qualitySNP were selected for validation.
Specifically, we selected unigenes present in both
libraries, SlM and SlFf, that contained SNPs (i.e. heterozygous positions in either SlM or SlFf). SNP Primers
were designed using Primer3 [55] to be located at least
40 bp from the SNP and PCR amplify fragments of at
least 200 bp in length. Seventeen primer pairs were
designed in order to validate 48 SNPs.
