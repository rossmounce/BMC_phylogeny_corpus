Abstract
Background: There is a significant requirement for the development and acquisition of reagents
that will facilitate effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lassa fever. In this regard,
recombinant Lassa virus (LASV) proteins may serve as valuable tools in diverse antiviral
applications. Bacterial-based systems were engineered for expression and purification of
recombinant LASV nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein 1 (GP1), and glycoprotein 2 (GP2).
Results: Full-length NP and the ectodomains of GP1 and GP2 were generated as maltose-binding
protein (MBP) fusions in the Rosetta strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using pMAL-c2x vectors.
Average fusion protein yields per liter of culture for MBP-NP, MBP-GP1, and MBP-GP2 were 10
mg, 9 mg, and 9 mg, respectively. Each protein was captured from cell lysates using amylose resin,
cleaved with Factor Xa, and purified using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fermentation
cultures resulted in average yields per liter of 1.6 mg, 1.5 mg, and 0.7 mg of purified NP, GP1 and
GP2, respectively. LASV-specific antibodies in human convalescent sera specifically detected each
of the purified recombinant LASV proteins, highlighting their utility in diagnostic applications. In
addition, mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluids (MHAF) against a panel of Old and New World
arenaviruses demonstrated selective cross reactivity with LASV proteins in Western blot and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential for developing broadly reactive
immunological assays that employ all three arenaviral proteins individually and in combination.

Background

Results

LASV, a member of the Arenaviridae family, is the etiologic
agent of Lassa fever, which is an acute and often fatal illness endemic to West Africa. There are an estimated
300,000 – 500,000 cases of Lassa fever each year [1-3],
with a mortality rate of 15%–20% for hospitalized
patients and as high as 50% during epidemics [4,5]. Presently, there is no licensed vaccine or immunotherapy
available for preventing or treating this disease. Although
the antiviral drug ribavirin is somewhat beneficial, it must
be administered at an early stage of infection to successfully alter disease outcome, thereby limiting its utility [6].
Furthermore, there is no commercially available Lassa
fever diagnostic assay, thus preventing early detection and
rapid implementation of existing treatment regimens (e.g.
ribavirin administration). The lack of adequate countermeasures and means of detection, coupled with the severity of disease, contributed to the classification of LASV as
a National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) Category A pathogen and biosafety level-4 (BSL4) agent.

The LASV genome is comprised of two ambisense, singlestranded RNA molecules, designated small (S) and large
(L) [7]. Two genes on the S segment encode NP, GP1, and
GP2; whereas, the L segment encodes the viral polymerase
(L protein) and RING finger Z matrix protein. GP1 and
GP2 subunits result from post-translational cleavage of a
precursor glycoprotein (GPC) by the protease SKI-1/S1P
[8]. GP1 serves a putative role in receptor binding, while
the structure of GP2 is consistent with viral transmembrane fusion proteins [9].
Humoral immunity to LASV is commonly bipartite, displaying an initial IgM response after infection, with an
ensuing mature IgG response [10]. Most diagnostic tests
for LASV are currently immunoassay-based and require
high containment BSL-4 facilities, using live virus as the
source of capture antigen [10]. Such methods are not conducive to field diagnosis, and BSL-4 facilities are not available in areas of the world where LASV is endemic. Thus, it
is necessary to develop highly sensitive, reliable, simple,
and cost-effective diagnostic assays that can be readily
deployed, implemented, and performed in resource-poor
settings. Toward this end, we report on the expression,
purification, and characterization of LASV proteins in bacterial cell-based systems. Data from these studies clearly
demonstrated that the bacterial cell-generated recombinant LASV proteins were immunologically reactive
against a panel of suspected LASV convalescent human
sera from Sierra Leone and a panel of MHAF against various Old and New World arenaviruses. Collectively, these
results demonstrated the putative broad application of
these proteins in the diagnosis of arenaviral infections
using a narrow range of viral class-specific reagents.

the MBP-NP fusion protein resulted primarily in the 55kDa full-lenth protein and a minor fragment of ~46 kDa
in size, as detected by Western blot and sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
after SEC purification (Figure 1B, lanes 7–8 and 1C, lane
5). Similarly, Factor Xa cleavage of the MBP-GP1 fusion
protein resulted primarily in the 22-kDa full-length protein and a minor larger fragment of ca 35-kDa in size, as
detected by Western blot (Figure 2A, lanes 4–6). Cleavage
of the MBP-GP2 fusion protein and subsequent purification produced two major forms of GP2, a 20-kDa fulllength protein and a truncated 13-kDa fragment (Figure
3A, lane 4).

Table 1: N-terminal sequencing of LASV proteins expressed in E.
Coli

Pilot experiments were performed to determine parameters for optimal fermentation, including criteria for appropriate growth temperature, IPTG concentration, time of
harvest following induction, and E. coli strain. For optimal expression of MBP-NP fusion protein, pMAL-c2x:NPtransformed Rosetta 2(DE3) cells were induced with 0.03
mM IPTG at 30°C for 4 hours (h). These conditions
resulted in an average protein yield of ~12 mg of MBP-NP
fusion protein per liter of shake flask culture grown in
complete Luria-Bertani Broth (cLB). Initial studies of
MBP-GP1 suggested that optimal expression would be
achieved with vector pMAL-c2x vector and E. coli Rosetta
gami 2 cells induced with 0.15 mM IPTG at 22°C for 4 h.
However, these conditions ultimately resulted in an average protein yield of only ~0.1 mg of MBP-GP1 fusion protein per liter of culture grown in cLB in shake flasks. Thus,
to obtain a sufficient concentration of MBP-GP1 for our
studies, it was necessary to generate a cell paste from a 10L high-density fermentation culture using semi-defined
medium and controlled growth parameters, with induction performed at A600 = 10. These conditions produced
308 g of cell paste from which ~40 mg of MBP-GP1 fusion
protein was isolated. For MBP-GP2, vector pMAL-c2x and
E. coli Rosetta gami 2 cells were also best suited for expression, with optimal induction performed using 0.15 mM
IPTG at 30°C for 4 h. In this manner, an average protein
yield of ~13 mg of MBP-GP2 fusion protein was obtained
per liter of shake flask culture propagated in cLB. Modifications to growth parameters did not significantly reduce
the production of truncated NP or GP2 proteins, pointing
to a possible metabolic deficiency in the growth medium
or a transcriptional/translational mechanism shortfall.

LASV NP have identical N-termini, indicating that truncation occurs at a site approximately 9-kDa short of the Cterminus. Similarly, the full length 20-kDa and truncated
13-kDa fragments of LASV GP2 have identical N-termini.
LASV GP1 was expressed and purified largely as a single,
full length polypeptide with a correctly predicted N-terminus. Thus, recombinant LASV proteins are expressed in
these systems with the correct N-termini, and in the case
of NP and GP2, the two major truncated forms fall short
of reaching the C-terminus during translation in E. coli
cells.

Full length and truncated recombinant LASV proteins share
predicted N-termini
As identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, the major
forms of each recombinant LASV protein were sequenced
by Edman degradation after cleavage with Factor Xa and
purification. Table 1 summarizes the results of N-terminal
sequencing for the major bands of each LASV protein. The

The N-terminus of each recombinant LASV protein cleaved with
Factor Xa contains four extraneous amino acids for NP and six for
GP1 and GP2 prior to the start of the arenaviral protein sequence.
The extraneous amino acids are in italics and the arenaviral protein
sequences are in bold.

Purified recombinant LASV proteins are antigenically
recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced
against native LASV
LASV GP1, GP2, and NP proteins generated and purified
from E. coli were detected by ELISA using a combination
of mAbs designated LASV mAb mix, which was comprised
of antibodies specific for LASV NP, GP1, and GP2 (Figure
4). Our results were equivalent to those obtained by Western blot analysis of the corresponding denatured proteins
(Figures. 1B, 2A, 3A). Collectively, these data suggested
that most or all of the epitopes targeted by antibodies in
LASV mAb mix are linear. Because this antibody mixture
was developed and optimized as a diagnostic reagent for
detection of native LASV in clinical samples, there is
rationale to suspect that shared linear epitopes in our bacterial-expressed LASV proteins and native viral counterparts may serve as optimal targets for the development of
diagnostic immunoassays.
Purified recombinant LASV proteins are immunologically
reactive against LASV-specific convalescent human sera
and MHAF against Old and New World arenaviruses
As implied above, one of the putative future applications
for the LASV proteins generated by these studies is the
development of sensitive ELISA-based immunoassays for
early detection of Lassa fever in infected patients. Toward
this end, we collected human convalescent sera from volunteers suspected of previously having had Lassa fever (no
less than 3 months before collection) and, subsequently,

assessed the ability of the sera to detect our bacterial cellgenerated LASV proteins by ELISA. Here, we report on
findings from our initial studies, which were performed
using 100- and 200-fold dilutions of 11 serum samples.
Purified bacterial-expressed GP1 was detected with statistical significance in 9 of the 11 samples using a 100-fold
dilution of sera but only in 7 samples at the higher dilution (Figure 5A). A similar assay detected purified bacterial-expressed NP in 10 of the 11 samples, again with both
dilutions (Figure 5B). Purified bacterial-expressed GP2
was detected by ELISA in 9 of 11 samples, with both
serum dilutions (Figure 5C). Patient 4 serum specifically
detected LASV NP but failed to detect LASV GP1 and GP2.
This result may indicate either a Lassa fever-negative outcome or a potential IgM-positive response, without
detectable IgG class switch. Thus, these preliminary data
may support a growing body of evidence, which suggest
that the humoral immune response to LASV infection is
biased towards LASV NP [11-13]. If proven true, NP may
be the most relevant immunological marker for early
detection of Lassa fever; whereas, a detectable immune
response to GP1 and GP2 antigens may follow a more
mature humoral response to infection. We could not
detect any of the bacterial-expressed LASV proteins with
patient 6 serum, which may also reflect either a Lassa
fever-negative outcome or an IgM-mediated response to
infection.

LASV GP1 generated the lowest signal-to-noise ratio of the
3 bacterial-expressed proteins tested. In patient samples 1,
2, 8, and 9, statistically significant detection of LASV GP1
was attained using a 100-fold dilution of sera but not with
a 200-fold dilution (Figure 5A). This twofold dilution
resulted in a significant decrease in the specific detection
of GP1, with an average decline of 37.5% per sample;
whereas, the average % decline in detection for ELISA of
GP2 and NP was 17.7 and 23.6, respectively. This observation may reflect a lower concentration of GP1-specific
antibodies, lower affinity specificities, or simply a lower
representation of antibodies directed to non-native
epitopes represented in the bacterial-expressed antigen.
None of the recombinant LASV proteins were specifically
detected by sera from Lassa fever naïve donors (Figure 5,
lane "NHS"), resulting in the acquisition of data that were
statistically comparable to those obtained with all seronegative patient samples.
To further investigate the utility of our recombinant LASV
proteins for functional applications, we used Western blot
and ELISA to test 4 Old and 5 New World arenavirus-specific MHAFs for their ability to cross-react with bacterialexpressed LASV NP, GP1, and GP2 (Table 2). The MHAFs
were generated against unprocessed arenavirus-infected
murine brain extracts and thus contained native viral proteins, which could have elicited a murine immune
response targeted against linear and conformational
epitopes. Purified LASV NP cross-reacted significantly
with most MHAFs of Old and New World origin, with the

exception of Latino virus-specific MHAF. LASV GP2 was
the second most cross-reactive protein to heterologous
MHAFs. In addition, there was a close correlation between
the cross-reactivity observed for NP and that of GP2. With
the exception of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV)and Pirital-specific MHAF, which reacted weakly to NP
and did not react with GP2, and Latino virus-specific
MHAF, which did not react with either, all other MHAF
showed dual reactivity. Bacterial-expressed GP1 bound
only to Mobala, Mopeia, and Pichinde virus-specific
MHAF and thus exhibited the least cross-reactivity against
the panel tested. Collectively, most of the MHAFs yielded
ELISA data similar to the results obtained by Western blot
analysis. The most pronounced differences were observed
when comparing binding data of MHAFs to GP1 protein.
Only Mobala- and Pichinde-specific MHAF bound to GP1
by Western blot, and when tested by ELISA, only Mobalaspecific MHAF exhibited significant binding to the protein, with Mopeia- and Tamiami-specific MHAFs reacting
to a lesser extent.

Discussion
LASV proteins were produced in bacterial cell lines using
the MBP fusion-based pMAL-vector system (New England
BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), comprised of pMAL-p2x and -c2x
bacterial expression vectors. The former plasmid utilizes a
periplasmic signal that translocates recombinant proteins
to the periplasmic space of E. coli; whereas, the latter vector contains a mutation in the translocation signal and
thus will yield only cytoplasm-associated recombinant
proteins. Selection of vector pMAL-c2x for expression of
LASV NP, GP1, and GP proteins was determined by two
critical observations we made during our small-scale pilot
experiments: (1) the -p2x vector background generated
significantly less recombinant protein per gram of cell
mass than the -c2x counterpart, an observation that has
been extensively documented in the literature and in the
manufacturer's manual for the pMAL expression system
(pMAL Protein Fusion and Purification System Manual,
New England BioLabs); and (2) translocation of LASV
GP1 and NP to the periplasmic space of E. coli was toxic to
the host cells (data not shown). Although we demonstrated that all 3 LASV proteins could be translocated to
and purified from the periplasmic space, NP- and GP1containing cells either yielded no fusion protein or lysed
upon centrifugation and/or osmotic shock. Thus, to
develop reproducible and scalable protein production
and purification processes, we investigated LASV protein
expression in the intracellular space using vector pMALc2x. This approach, however, was met with another potential obstacle, as the intracellular space of E. coli is a reducing environment and is, therefore, not conducive to
expression of proteins that require disulfide bond formation for correct folding. This represented a critical point
for consideration with regard to GP1 and GP2, which are

believed to contain secondary structures formed by
disulfide bond-mediated constraining, as per current proposed models [9]. For our studies, we therefore expressed
the glycoproteins in the E. coli Rosetta gami 2 strain,
which contains mutations in the trxB and gor genes and
thus permits disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm.
Ultimately, the combination of an E. coli Rosetta gami 2
strain and the pMAL-c2x vector background resulted in
improved expression of both LASV glycoproteins, allowing us to achieve the highest yield of recombinant protein
per gram of cell mass in an environment appropriate for
generation of conformationally correct protein. LASV NP
expression also benefited from the use of vector pMALc2x; however, as this protein is not thought to possess secondary structures that are influenced by a reducing environment, the E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) strain was used rather
than gami 2 cells. Although higher concentrations of NP
per unit of cell mass were achieved with pMAL-c2x when
compared to the -p2x counterpart, a significant portion of
the protein was contained in insoluble fractions after cell
lysis. Recently, Sletta et al. [14] demonstrated the critical
role served by prokaryotic translocation signal sequences
in achieving industrial-level expression of proteins with
medical relevance for humans. Thus, expression technologies that exploit secretory mechanisms may alleviate difficulties encountered with proteins such as LASV NP,
which aggregate as insoluble matter in the cytoplasm and
are cytotoxic when translocated to the periplasmic space
of the cell. We are therefore interested in identifying
expression elements that facilitate improved expression of
all 3 LASV proteins in E. coli, while maximizing protein
integrity and yield in a manner that permits production of
higher concentrations of full-length product. Furthermore, we are currently exploring alternative purification
schemes to alleviate difficulties we encountered with the
Factor Xa cleavage system, which was expensive and often
resulted in non-specific uncoupling of fusion domains.
Although bacterial-expressed full-length LASV proteins
were produced, we also obtained truncated versions of the
proteins to varying degrees. We repeatedly co-eluted a
minor 46-kDa protein along with full-length 55-kDa NP
(Figure 1). The truncated form of NP was equally detected
by the 2 LASV NP-specific mAbs contained in LASV mAb
mix, as determined by Western blot (Figure 1B). Expression and purification of LASV GP2 primarily yielded a
truncated 13-kDa fragment and a full-length 20-kDa protein (Figure 3). At least 2 other minor fragments, which
were each less than 13-kDa in size, were also detected in
most preparations. The observed ratio of 13-versus 20kDa proteins obtained in the final pooled GP2-containing
fractions appeared to reflect the expression profile in the
E. coli environment rather than an artefact of the purification scheme, as deduced by our analyses. We repeatedly
detected four GP2 protein bands by Coomassie staining

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/74

and SDS-PAGE of the amylose capture eluate from IPTGinduced Rosetta gami 2:pMAL-p2x-(data not shown) and
-c2x MBP-GP2-containing cell extracts (Figure 3B). Three
bands, 50-, 55-, and 65-kDa in size, corresponded to various forms of GP2, with the largest band representing the
full length fusion protein, as determined on Western blots
detected with LASV mAb mix (Figure 3A). Conversely, the
fourth protein represented MBP, as it was detected by
Western blot analysis using MBP-specific antisera (data
not shown) but not LASV mAb mix. Collectively, these
data suggested potential arrest points in the expression of
the LASV glycoproteins in this prokaryotic system, which
may have resulted from a transcriptional or translational
impairment that allowed for production of the full-length
protein in addition to truncated species. Our methodology did not permit us to determine if metabolic proteolysis during recombinant protein synthesis was the source
of truncated protein production. In addition, we were
unable to determine if the fermentation process contributed to these results, as minimal medium optimization
was performed. Conversely, expression of LASV GP1
resulted primarily in production of the full-length 22-kDa
protein, which was detected on Western blots by LASV
mAb mix (Figure 2A). The fermentation parameters we
used to produce GP1 employed an enriched medium to
sustain high-density E. coli propagation, which resulted in
improved volumetric yields of full-length GP1 when compared to the yield obtained from low-density shake flask
cultures. Future improvements to this system(s) will be
required to generate higher levels of full-length LASV proteins for diagnostic and potential therapeutic applications. Initial development efforts will concentrate on
improving volumetric yields of each LASV protein using
optimized fermentation parameters and enriched media
aimed at reducing the metabolic burden associated with
high level expression of eukaryotic viral proteins in E. coli.
As our intention is to use the recombinant proteins we
generated for development of an ELISA-based diagnostic
assay, we conducted several immunological studies by
which we demonstrated the ability of our bacterial cellexpressed proteins to bind to LASV-specific mAbs and
human sera, as well as arenavirus-specific MHAF. Our
results clearly suggested the practical use of the bacterialexpressed proteins for this purpose. Although full characterization and comparison of bacterial-versus mammalian-generated LASV proteins will be required to identify
broadly shared epitopes in each relevant protein by all
available and future antibody reagents, current data support the development of bacterial-expression platforms,
which are cost effective and thus a desired avenue for protein production. However, it will be necessary to establish
that post-translational modifications, such as the predicted 7 N-linked glycosylation sites in LASV GP1 and 4 in
GP2, are not critical for broad antigen detection by native

human antibodies in infected patient sera. Although Lassa
fever convalescent serum IgGs may recognize linear and
conformational epitopes in the bacterial-expressed glycoproteins, an additional immunoglobulin fraction may be
directed against native epitopes, which may include glycosylated domains. These comparative studies will be facilitated through the generation and extensive
characterization of panels of mAbs to native (mammalian-expressed) and non-native (bacterial-expressed)
LASV proteins.
A compilation of results from Western blot, ELISA, or
both using MHAF against Old and New World arenaviruses inferred the potential for developing broadly reactive immunological assays that employ all three LASV
proteins concurrently. This is reflected by the data in Table
2, which indicated that each of the bacterial-expressed
LASV proteins effectively detected antibodies in MHAFs
specific for Old and New World arenaviruses. Bowen et al.
[15] reported un-rooted phylogenetic trees for LASV NP,
GP1, and GP2, showing relationships among arenaviruses. Alignment of NP sequences indicated that LASV
strains Josiah, GA39, 803213, and Ip are all more closely
related to Mopeia than any strain of the prototype arenavirus LCMV. Also, Pichinde and Oliveros were more distantly related to LASV strains than Mopeia and LCMV.
Overall, our results revealed disparities between statistically calculated relatedness among arenavirus strains of
multiple origins and corresponding immunological crossreactivities to recombinant LASV proteins with MHAFs.
For example, reactivity of Pichinde MHAF to LASV GP1
would not have been expected based on the observed lack
of binding by more closely related arenavirus MHAFs,
such as Ippy and LCMV. Data suggested that differences
among relevant arenaviral protein sequences may account
for variation in epitope immuno-dominances. Highly
conserved epitopes in NP and the glycoproteins among
arenaviruses may not result in similar humoral responses
upon viral exposure, thus yielding polyclonal antibody
pools that are biased toward more immuno-dominant,
yet more diverse sequences. Conversely, if highly conserved epitopes in the proteins of more distantly related
arenaviruses are more immuno-dominant than more heterogeneous sequences, the resulting humoral response
may result in detectable cross-reactivity across arenaviral
classes and subtypes. Although confirming this supposition would require fine epitope mapping, it could explain
the lack of reactivity by MHAFs against arenaviruses
closely related to LASV, while exhibiting strong binding to
more distant counterparts.

human subjects using sera samples collected in the field.
Toward this end, subsequent work will be aimed at generating a broad panel of mAbs against all of the LASV proteins described in these studies. These antibodies will be
used as both capture and detection reagents in the production of sensitive diagnostic immunoassays to, not only
LASV, but to other arenaviruses as well. Additional studies
will be performed to characterize these mAbs in vitro and
to explore their potential protective efficacy using in vivo
animal models. Thus, these studies could result in a panel
of reagents that will greatly improve diagnosis of Lassa
fever in endemic regions of the world. The classification of
Lassa fever and other arenaviruses by the U.S Government
as Category A agents with Biowarfare potential further justifies the development of countermeasures against this
highly virulent class of viruses.

Methods

Conclusion

Virus, cells, plasmids, antibodies, human sera, and MHAF
LASV, strain Josiah [16], was propagated in Vero cells
(ATCC CRL 1587), which were maintained in complete
Eagle's Minimal Essential medium (cEMEM) containing
non-essential amino acids (NEAA) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (ΔFBS) and 20
μg/mL of gentamicin. All plasmid constructs were engineered in E. coli strain DH5α, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). LASV
proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) and
gami 2 strains (Novagen, Madison, WI), which contain
the chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid pRARE, encoding
tRNAs for six (pRARE1) or seven (pRARE2) rare codons
(AUA, AGG, AGA, CUA, CCC, GGA, and CGG) aimed at
enhancing expression of eukaryotic proteins in prokaryotic systems. Rosetta gami 2 cells contain trxB and gor mutations, which permit disulfide bond formation in the
cytoplasm. Large-scale shaker flask cultures of E. coli
Rosetta strains expressing LASV NP and GP2 were performed in cLB medium supplemented with 2 g/L of glucose, 100 μg/mL of ampicillin, and 35 μg/mL of
chloramphenicol. Large-scale fermentation of the E. coli
Rosetta strain expressing LASV GP1 was performed in
semi-defined batch medium comprised of 40 g/L yeast
extract, 4.0 g/L potassium phosphate monobasic
(KH2PO4), 11.33 g/L sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydate (Na2HPO4), 6.0 g/L ammonium sulfate
((NH4)2SO4), 0.2 g/L of uridine, 2 g/L of glucose, 0.372
mL/L of Dawes Trace 1, 2.14 mL/L of Dawes Trace 2,
0.072 mL/L of Dawes Trace 3, 0.606 mL/L of 1 M calcium
chloride dihydrate (CaCl2-2H2O), 0.30 mL/L of 0.43 g/
mL thiamine-HCl, 333 μL/L of 30% (v/v) Antifoam A
(Sigma), 35 mg/L of chloramphenicol, and 100 mg/L of
carbenicillin.

Collectively, this work provides a gateway for development of a recombinant protein ELISA-based system for
early diagnostic detection of arenaviral infections in

was used for production of LASV proteins. Both plasmids
contain protease recognition sites that permit Factor Xa
cleavage of recombinant proteins from MBP after purification. We analyzed LASV protein sequences for the presence of the Factor Xa cleavage recognition sequence
(IQGR) before choosing this protease for our studies. No
sites were found that were identical to this sequence or to
published non-specific cleavage sequence sites [17,18].
For immunoassays, Dr. Randal Schoepp kindly provided
the following LASV-specific mAbs: NP-specific mAbs 52273-8 and L2-54-6A; GP1-specific mAb L52-74-7A; and
GP2-specific mAbs L52-272-7, L52-121-22, and L52-2727, which were produced against purified gamma-irradiated LASV, as previously described [19]. These mAbs were
used individually, in various combinations, or in a mixture designated LASV mAb mix that was comprised of all
the mAbs. Preliminary work indicated that LASV mAb mix
was well suited for detecting native and denatured LASV
proteins, respectively (data not shown). Rabbit anti-MBP
polyclonal antibody was purchased from New England
BioLabs. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies specific for mouse and rabbit IgG were
purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (KPL,
Gaithersburg, MD).
Human convalescent sera were collected from healthy volunteers suspected to have previously had Lassa fever, as
determined by retrospective differential diagnosis from
patient records at the Kenema Government Hospital
(Kenema, Eastern District, Sierra Leone) in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health's DMID Protocol
Number 06–0008. Blood samples were not obtained from
individuals whom had been sick within 3 months prior to
collection in order to insure that any previous Lassa infection would be resolved. Each patient was given informed
consent prior to donating blood. Briefly, whole blood was
collected from volunteers in 5 mL serum Vacutainer®
tubes, (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and
allowed to clot for 1 h at 4°C. Serum was decanted into
cryogenic tubes and labelled with unique numerical
patient identifiers. As an additional precautionary measure, the samples were heat-inactivated for 1 h at 60°C,
which has been shown to completely inactivate LASV, and
then stored at -20°C until transported to the United
States. Serum samples were shipped at ambient temperature in licensed storage containers using a commercial
courier, according to International Air Transport Authority (IATA) and U.S. government regulations regarding the
shipment of diagnostic specimens. Upon receipt, 0.025%
(w/v) sodium azide was added to each tube and samples
were stored at -20°C until further use.
Specific MHAF were prepared against each of the following arenaviruses at the World Reference Center for Emerg-

ing Viruses and Arboviruses, University of Texas Medical
Branch (UTMB): LCMV, Ippy, Mobala, Mopeia, Latino,
Tamiami, Pirital, Pichinde, and Oliveros viruses. Briefly,
the immunogens were 10% (w/v) crude brain homogenates of infected mouse brain in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The vaccination schedule consisted of four
weekly injections of mouse brain antigen mixed with Freund's adjuvant. After the fourth injection, sarcoma 180
cells were injected intraperitoneally in mice to induce
ascites formation. The ascitic fluid was removed by paracentesis when the abdomen became distended. MHAF
production was done under a UTMB-approved animal
protocol. Normal mouse serum (NMS) was used as a negative control in Western blots and ELISA.
LASV propagation, cDNA synthesis, and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification of LASV genes
Vero cells were infected with LASV strain Josiah at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Briefly, virus was diluted in
cEMEM to a final volume of 2.0 mL, then added to confluent cells in a T-75 flask and incubated for 1 h at 37°C,
with 5% CO2 and periodic rocking. Subsequently, 13 mL
of cEMEM was added, and the culture was incubated in a
similar manner for 96 h. To prepare total cellular RNA, the
cell culture medium was replaced with 2 mL of TRIzol™
reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's specifications. Using the ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England
BioLabs), 100 ng of total cellular RNA per reaction was
transcribed into cDNA, as outlined in the manufacturer's
protocol. The Phusion™ High-Fidelity PCR Mastermix
(New England BioLabs) was used in all amplifications of
LASV gene sequences. PCR parameters were determined
based on the melting temperature for each oligonucleotide set. LASV GP1 and GP2 genes were amplified using
the following cycling conditions: 98°C for one 15 second
(sec) cycle and then 35 repeated cycles of 98°C for 5 sec,
59°C for 10 sec, and 72°C for 15 sec, followed by a final
extension at 72°C for 5 minutes (min). LASV NP was
amplified using the following cycling conditions: 98°C
for one 30 sec cycle and then 35 repeated cycles of 98°C
for 10 sec, 59°C for 15 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, followed
by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.

Table 3 outlines each of the nucleotide sequences of the
oligonucleotide primers used in the amplification of LASV
genes for expression in bacterial cell systems. The ectodomain of the LASV GP1 gene, lacking a signal sequence and
the N-terminal methionine (N-Met), was amplified using
(1) a 41-mer forward oligonucleotide primer (5' GP1
bac), which contained a Bam HI restriction endonuclease
(REN) site and comprised the N-terminal 8 amino acids
(a.a.) of the mature GP1 protein beyond the known SPase
cleavage site; and (2) a 49-mer reverse oligonucleotide
primer (3' GP1 bac), which contained a Hind III REN site,

contained a Bam HI REN site and comprised the N-terminal 7 a.a. of the mature GP2 protein beyond the known
SKI-1/S1P protease cleavage site; and (2) a 40-mer reverse

Cloning LASV genes for expression in bacterial cell systems
Figure 6 summarizes the strategy used to clone LASV GP1,
GP2, and NP gene sequences into vectors pMAL-p2x and
-c2x for expression in bacteria. The constructs and E. coli
strains used to express the recombinant LASV genes are
outlined in Table 4. Briefly, initial pilot expression studies
were performed with vectors pMAL-p2x:GP1, pMALp2x:GP2, and pMAL-p2x:NP in the Rosetta 2(DE3) E. coli
strain. Subsequent experiments used vectors pMALc2x:GP1, pMAL-c2x:GP2, and pMAL-c2x:NP, with the
former two constructs expressed in E. coli Rosetta gami 2
cells and the latter in E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) cells. DNA was
manipulated by standard techniques [20], and all recombinant plasmids outlined in Table 4 were initially engineered and propagated in E. coli DH5α.

= 0.5–0.6. Each culture was split into three flasks and
induced with IPTG to final concentrations of 0.03, 0.15,
and 0.3 mM. Cultures were then grown under induction
conditions for 2 h. Subsequently, periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared by osmotic shock of E.
coli transformed with pMAL-p2x-based vectors and by
generation of whole cell lysates of E. coli transformed with
pMAL-c2x-based vectors, respectively. MBP-LASV fusion
proteins were captured from each fraction on amylose
resin (New England BioLabs) and then analyzed by SDSPAGE under reducing conditions. Using optimal temperature and IPTG parameters determined by the above studies, a time-course investigation was carried out to further
maximize total fusion protein yields. SDS-PAGE analysis
was performed on LASV-MBP fusion proteins captured on
amylose resin from samples harvested at 2, 3, and 4 h after
induction.
Scheme for small-scale purification of recombinant LASV
proteins expressed in bacteria
LASV-MBP fusion proteins were purified from whole cell
lysates of E. coli transformed with pMAL-c2X-based vectors by capture on amylose resin followed by Factor Xa
cleavage, according to the manufacturer's instructions
(New England BioLabs). The addition of dithiothreitol
(DTT) was necessary to prevent aggregation and precipitation of protein before and during Factor Xa cleavage of
LASV GP1-MBP and GP2-MBP fusion proteins. Moreover,
the addition 0.03 to 0.05% SDS was required for efficient
Factor Xa cleavage of both these fusion proteins. Briefly,
cleaved LASV proteins were separated from MBP and
other contaminants using a Superdex 200 Prep Grade sizeTable 4: Summary of vectors and respective E. coli strains used

Figure strategy for expression of LASV proteins GP1, GP2, and NP in E. coli using pMAL vectors
Cloning 6
Cloning strategy for expression of LASV proteins GP1, GP2, and NP in E. coli using pMAL vectors. To generate
MBP-LASV gene fusions for E. coli expression, PCR-amplified LASV gene sequences were restricted and cloned in-frame at the
3' end of the malE gene, beyond the cleavage site for Factor Xa (IQGR). The LASV GP1 gene sequence comprised a.a. 59–259
in the native GPC, spanning the first a.a. beyond the known SPase cleavage site at position 58 to the junction between GP1 and
GP2 domains, which is cleaved by the SKI-1/S1P protease at a.a. 259. The LASV GP2 gene sequence comprised a.a. 260–427,
spanning the first a.a. of mature GP2 to the last a.a. before the predicted TM domain. The LASV NP gene sequence comprised
the complete ORF of the gene, with the exception of the N-terminal Met. The 3' oligonucleotides used for amplification of
each gene sequence were engineered to contain two terminator codons separated by a single nucleotide. All genes were
cloned into vectors pMAL-p2x and pMAL-c2x for periplasmic and cytoplasmic expression of fusion proteins, respectively, in E.
coli Rosetta 2(DE3) or gami 2 strains. The a.a. position of each LASV gene domain is noted, as are REN sites. Abbreviations
include: MBP gene (malE), MBP promoter (Ptac), philamentous phage origin of replication (M13 ori), bacterial origin of replication (pBR322 ori), beta-lactamase gene (bla), E. coli terminator (rrnB), the LacZ alpha-complementation domain (LacZα), and
the lacI repressor gene (lacIq). The periplasmic secretory domain in pMAL-p2x is indicated by a black box on the 5' end of the
malE gene sequence.

exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh,
PA). To prevent aggregation, 30 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulphonic acid (MES) buffer containing
0.1% (w/v) SDS was required for SEC of Factor Xa-treated
GP2-MBP fusion protein. SEC of Factor Xa-treated GP1MBP fusion protein required 30 mM MES buffer containing 5 mM DTT and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. LASV NP-MBP was
cleaved with Factor Xa alone and was purified by SEC
using 1× PBS, pH 7.4. These conditions were subsequently
applied to the large-scale purification schemes of the
respective LASV proteins.

Large-scale production and purification of recombinant
LASV proteins expressed in bacteria
LASV NP
To generate and purify LASV NP, a 3-L shaker flask culture
of pMAL-c2x:NP-transformed Rosetta 2(DE3) cells was
grown in cLB to an A600 = 0.5–0.6 at 30°C and then
induced with a final IPTG concentration of 0.03 mM.
After incubation at 30°C for 4 h, cells were harvested by
centrifugation for 10 min at ~13,000 × g. The cell paste
was frozen at -20°C and subsequently thawed and resuspended in 9 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 200

mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Next, a bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and lysozyme (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) were added at concentrations of
1 mL per 4 grams and 40 mg per gram of wet cell paste,
respectively, and the suspension was incubated at 37°C,
with agitation. After 30 min, 1/10 volume of 1 M MgSO4
and 50 μL of 2000 U/mL DNase I (Roche, Nutley, NJ) per
gram wet cell paste were added. The solution was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting
supernatant was further clarified by 0.2-μm filtration,
then diluted two-fold with lysis buffer and applied to a 1.6
× 10 cm amylose column at 75 cm/h. The column was
washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer
(20 mM TrisHCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and the fusion
protein was eluted with equilibration buffer containing
10 mM maltose. For every A280 = 1 of fusion protein, 20 μL
of 1 mg/mL Factor Xa (Novagen) was added. The reaction
mixture was then incubated overnight at 4°C and subsequently clarified by low-speed centrifugation followed by
0.2-μm filtration. The solution was loaded onto a 2.6 × 70
cm Superdex 200 Prep Grade size-exclusion column
(Amersham Biosciences) in 6-mL aliquots and eluted at
60 cm/h with 1× PBS, pH 7.4. LASV NP-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon
stirred cell unit fitted with a 10,000 NMWL ultrafiltration
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 20 psig Nitrogen.
Purified LASV NP was sterile filtered using a 0.2-μm Millex
GV syringe filter (Millipore), then distributed to vials and
stored at -20°C.
LASV GP1
To express and purify LASV GP1, a 10-L culture of pMALc2x:GP1-transformed Rosetta gami 2 cells was grown in
semi-defined batch medium at 37°C using a New Brunswick Scientific fermentor (Edison, NJ). When the density
of the culture reached A600 = 7.75, a yeast extract feed consisting of 200 g/L yeast extract, 0.33 g/L uridine, 0.3 g/L
histidine, and 0.3 g/L methionine was started at a rate of
4 mL/min. When the density of the culture reached A600 =
10.0, the temperature was reduced to 22°C, the yeast
extract feed was reduced to 2 mL/min, and IPTG was
added to a final concentration of 3.0 mM. During the fermentation, dissolved oxygen was set at 40%, and the culture was supplemented with 50% glucose to maintain its
concentration between 0.2–2 g/L. At 4 h post-induction
(A600 = 13.7), cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10
min at ~13,000 × g. The resulting cell paste was frozen at
-80°C and subsequently thawed and resuspended in 9
volumes of lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 200 mM NaCl,
10 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0). As described above for
NP purification, bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail and
lysozyme were added to the suspension, and the reaction
was incubated at 37°C, with agitation. After 45 min, 1/10
volume of 1 M MgSO4 and 50 μL of 2000 U/mL DNase I

(Roche) per gram wet cell paste were added. The solution
was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C and then
centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min at 0°C. The supernatant was further clarified by 0.2-μm filtration and processed in two cycles as follows: the supernatant was applied
to a 2.6 × 8.0 cm amylose column at 75 cm/hr, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration
buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT, pH 7.4), and the fusion protein was eluted with
equilibration buffer containing 10 mM maltose. SDS and
EDTA were added to a final concentration of 0.05% (w/v)
and 2 mM, respectively, followed by the addition of 5 μL
of 1 mg/mL Factor Xa (Novagen) per A280 = 1 of amylose
column eluate. After overnight incubation at 2–8°C, DTT
was added to a final concentration of 5 mM and the solution was concentrated five-fold using an Amicon stirred
cell fitted with a 4,000 NMWL PLBC ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore) at 40 psig at room temperature. Subsequently, the solution was 0.2-μm-filtered and loaded onto
a 2.6 × 70 cm Superdex 200 Prep Grade size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in 6 mL aliquots and eluted
with 30 mM MES, 154 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM DTT,
pH 6.7, at 30 cm/h. The fractions containing full-length
GP1 were pooled and then concentrated as before to ~12
mL. To remove high-molecular-weight contaminants and
DTT, LASV GP1 was re-run on the Superdex 200 column
with 30 mM MES, 154 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.7. The
GP1 eluate pool was stored overnight at 2–8°C to precipitate SDS. Precipitated SDS was removed from the concentrated sample by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 0°C for 1
h. Purified LASV GP1 was immediately sterile filtered
using a 0.2-μm Millex GV syringe filter (Millipore), then
distributed to vials and stored at -20°C.
LASV GP2
To express and purify LASV GP2, a 3-L shaker flask culture
of pMAL-c2x:GP2-transformed Rosetta 2(DE3) cells was
grown at 30°C to an A600 = 0.5–0.6 in cLB and then
induced with a final IPTG concentration of 0.15 mM.
After incubation for 3.5 h at 30°C, the cells were harvested
by centrifugation for 10 min at ~13,000 × g. The resulting
cell paste was frozen at -20°C, then thawed and resuspended in 9 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 200
mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0). As
described above, bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail and
lysozyme were added to the suspension, and the reaction
was incubated at 37°C, with agitation. After 30 min, 1/10
volume of 1 M MgSO4 and 50 μL of 2000 U/mL DNase I
(Roche) per gram wet cell paste were added. The solution
was incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C and then
centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was further clarified by 0.2-μm filtration, then diluted
twofold with lysis buffer and applied to a 1.6 × 11 cm
amylose column at 75 cm/h. The column was washed
with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer (20 mM

TrisHCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.4),
and the fusion protein was eluted with equilibration
buffer containing 10 mM maltose. SDS was added to a
final concentration of 0.03% (w/v), followed by 10 μL of
1 mg/mL of Factor Xa (New England BioLabs) per A280 =
1 of amylose column eluate. After incubation for 17 h at
4°C, the solution was concentrated threefold using an
Amicon stirred cell unit fitted with a 3,000 NMWL ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore) at 30 psig Nitrogen. Subsequently, the solution was loaded onto a 2.6 cm × 70 cm
Superdex 200 Prep Grade size-exclusion column in ~6
mL-aliquots and then eluted with 30 mM MES, 154 mM
NaCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.7, at 30 cm/h. GP2-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated, as described for GP1
purification. The sample was further concentrated with a
Centriplus YM-3 unit (Millipore) at 2,500 × g at room
temperature and stored overnight at 4°C. Precipitated
SDS was removed by centrifugation at 2,500 × g at 0°C.
Purified LASV GP2 was immediately sterile filtered using
a 0.2 μm Millex GV syringe filter (Millipore), then distributed to vials and stored at -20°C.
Western blot analysis of recombinant LASV proteins
The identity of LASV proteins generated in bacterial systems was confirmed by Western blot analysis using 10–15
μL of LASV mAb mix at a 1:1,000 dilution or a 1:100 dilution of MHAF. Briefly, proteins were transferred to 0.45μM nitrocellulose membranes using XCell II™ Blot Modules, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Blocking and probing of membranes were
performed in 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 5% non-fat dry milk, 0.05%
Tween-20, and 0.01% thymerosal. Membranes were
washed with 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST, wash
buffer). Detection was performed with 10–15 mL of 1 μg/
mL of HRP-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG (H+L) polyclonal antibody reagent (KPL) and tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) membrane substrate. Reactions were stopped by
immersing developed membranes in water, followed by
immediate high resolution scanning for permanent
recording. When applicable, blots were stripped in 62.5
mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 5 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 100 mM βmercaptoethanol, for 1 h at 50°C in a sealed plastic bag,
with shaking. Stripped membranes were subsequently
washed extensively in wash buffer, then blocked and reprobed, as described above.
ELISA
ELISA was performed with NP, GP1, and GP2 proteins
generated in E. coli. Briefly, high-affinity Costar 3590
(Costar) or Nunc PolySorp (Nunc) 96-well plates were
coated with purified proteins at a final concentration of
0.1 or 0.2 μg per well in PBS, pH 7.5. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C and washed three times with PBST.
Plates were then blocked for 90 min with 200 μL of blocking buffer consisting of 5% milk in PBST, then washed as

above. A 1:1,000 dilution of LASV mAb mix, 1:100 or
1:200 dilutions of human convalescent sera, or a 1:100
dilution of MHAF in blocking buffer was added at a final
volume of 100 μL/well, and the plates were incubated for
1 h at 37°C, then washed as above. Detection was performed with 100 μL/well of HRP-conjugated goat αmouse IgG (H+L) polyclonal antibody reagent (KPL) or
HRP-conjugated Fc-specific human anti-IgG antibody
(Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) diluted to 1 μg/
mL in blocking buffer. After 1 h incubation, 100 μL/well
of TMB substrate (KPL) was added, and the plates were
incubated for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding
100 μL/well of TMB stop solution (KPL) and read at 450
nm in a Molecular Dynamics ThermoMax spectrophotometer, using SoftMax Pro analysis software (Molecular
Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).
N-terminal protein sequencing
N-terminal sequence determination by Edman degradation was carried out in an Applied Biosystems Model 4949
CLC protein suquenator. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids were analyzed on-line with an
Applied Biosystems Model 785A/140C/610A analyzer. All
reagents and solvents were from Applied Biosystems.
