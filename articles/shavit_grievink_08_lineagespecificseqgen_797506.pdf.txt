Abstract
Background: Commonly used phylogenetic models assume a homogeneous evolutionary process
throughout the tree. It is known that these homogeneous models are often too simplistic, and that
with time some properties of the evolutionary process can change (due to selection or drift). In
particular, as constraints on sequences evolve, the proportion of variable sites can vary between
lineages. This affects the ability of phylogenetic methods to correctly estimate phylogenetic trees,
especially for long timescales. To date there is no phylogenetic model that allows for change in the
proportion of variable sites, and the degree to which this affects phylogenetic reconstruction is
unknown.
Results: We present LineageSpecificSeqgen, an extension to the seq-gen program that allows
generation of sequences with both changes in the proportion of variable sites and changes in the
rate at which sites switch between being variable and invariable. In contrast to seq-gen and its
derivatives to date, we interpret branch lengths as the mean number of substitutions per variable
site, as opposed to the mean number of substitutions per site (which is averaged over all sites,
including invariable sites). This allows specification of the substitution rates of variable sites,
independently of the proportion of invariable sites.
Conclusion: LineageSpecificSeqgen allows simulation of DNA and amino acid sequence alignments
under a lineage-specific evolutionary process. The program can be used to test current models of
evolution on sequences that have undergone lineage-specific evolution. It facilitates the
development of both new methods to identify such processes in real data, and means to account
for such processes. The program is available at: http://awcmee.massey.ac.nz/downloads.htm.

Background
Simulated sequence data are widely used for hypothesis
testing [1], for evaluation of phylogenetic methods under
different parameter settings [2-4], for testing the effect of
model misspecification on tree reconstruction [5-7], for
development of new models and methods [8,9], and for
approximate Bayesian inference [10]. For these applica-

tions, it is important that the processes used to produce
the simulated data closely model the underlying biological processes. Commonly used phylogenetic sequence
generators employ homogeneous, time reversible, stationary models of molecular sequence evolution. These
phylogenetic models assume that the overall rate of substitution is the only parameter that may change along the

tree and do not allow changes in other parameters, such
as the rate matrix, the distribution of rates across sites and
the proportion of variable sites.
It is known, however, that as sequences diverge they can
acquire independent properties. In particular, the proportion of variable sites can evolve in a lineage-specific manner due to changes in evolutionary constraints [11,12].
The proportion of variable sites in a lineage will affect its
estimated substitution rate [13]. Failure to account for
changes in the proportion of variable sites can result in
erroneous rate estimates that may affect tree estimation
[5,14]. Indeed, change in the proportion of variable sites
is thought to be one of the main causes of long-branch
attraction [12,15].
In addition to the possible shift in the proportion of variable sites, it is known that sites can switch between variable and invariable states due to drift. Note that invariable
sites (which we are concerned with in this paper) are sites
for which the probability of character substitution is zero;
as opposed to invariant sites for which the probability of
character substitution is greater than zero but for a certain
group (sample) of taxa no substitution is found. The strict
covarion model [16] allows sites to switch between variable and invariable states; however, at equilibrium the proportion of variable sites is constant over the different
lineages. Several extensions of the covarion model [17-19]
are implemented in the sequence generator seq-gen-aminocov [19]. However, to date, there is no model that
allows for change in the proportion of variable sites.
Using partitions (a partition is group of consecutive sites
that are simulated on the same underlying tree), lineagespecific proportions of variable sites have been simulated
with sequence generators such as seq-gen [20], seq-gencov [21], and seq-gen-aminocov [19]. These simulations
have proven to be very useful in facilitating our understanding of the process of lineage-specific evolution.
However, the use of these programs for the purpose of
simulating changes in the proportion of variable sites is
limited to trees with very few 'events', where an event is
defined as a position on the tree where a change in the
process of evolution occurs, e.g. a change in the proportion of variable sites. This is because different proportions
of variable sites are generated using pre-defined partitions, where each partition is simulated on a tree with different branch lengths (zero branch lengths are used for
invariable sites). For two events, in which the proportion
of variable sites changes, there are 8 partitions [5]. In general there are 2(1+number of events) partitions (M. Steel, personal communication), so creating the input for such
simulations becomes a difficult task. Furthermore, in seqgen, invariable sites can be incorporated into sequences
by either simulating on different partitions (where a par-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/317

tition for invariable sites is simulated on a zero length
tree), or specifying a proportion of invariable sites (Pinv)
using the -i option. Intuitively, one might expect the processes of evolution simulated by these two methods to be
equivalent, but this is not the case. In seq-gen and its modifications published to date, branch lengths are defined as
the mean expected number of substitutions per site. When
sequences are simulated with a specified proportion of
invariable sites, the branch lengths specified by the user
are rescaled (increased) by the program to compensate for
the proportion of invariable sites. Hence, increasing the
proportion of invariable sites (for which the substitution
rate is zero) forces a greater substitution rate on the variable sites. For example, with 80% invariable sites and an
expected mean number of substitutions of 0.02, the mean
number of substitutions of the variable sites will be
rescaled to 0.1. Although this branch rescaling is consistent with the definition of branch lengths as the mean
expected number of substitutions per site, we found that
many researchers are not aware of it. Moreover, using partitions does not allow changes in the on/off switch rate of
the covarion model. We have developed a program that
allows the user to simulate sequence data containing
changes in the proportion of variable sites, and changes in
the covarion switch rate, without the need to specify partitions or rescale branch lengths.

Implementation
LineageSpecificSeqgen is a command-line controlled program written in C. The program uses, as much as possible,
the code from seq-gen and its derivatives [19-21]. Given a
rooted tree, specified events (in which changes in the
process occur), and a set of parameters, the program generates a user-specified number of datasets (nucleotide or
amino-acid). An example workflow of the program is
illustrated in Figure 1. The input is two text files – a tree
file and a parameter file. The tree file contains one or more
trees in a format which is based on the Newick format.
Events on the tree are marked using a $ sign and are given
names. Lengths are specified for all branches of the tree;
for branches with events, the length before and the length
after the event must both be specified. The parameter file
contains the changes in the proportion of variable sites,
and/or the switch rate of the covarion process, at each
event. Any number of events can be specified. A change in
the proportion of variable sites is specified using two
parameters; the proportion of sites that were invariable
and became variable at the event, and the proportion of
sites that were variable and became invariable at the event.
For each input tree, the program will generate n subtrees
(n = 1+number of events), with each event on the tree
defining a cutting point (see Figure 1). For each input tree
and each dataset, sequences are first simulated on the subtree under the root and then on the subtree under each

Figure 1
An example workflow of LineageSpecificSeqgen
An example workflow of LineageSpecificSeqgen. For each tree, the program creates a random root sequence according
to the parameters specified. The program then evolves the sequences, according to the parameters given for the root, along
the subtree beneath the root (excluding parts of the tree that are beneath events). The resulting sequence at each event is
then used as an ancestral sequence for the subtree beneath that event, and the sequences are evolved along that subtree
according to the parameters specified for that event. The output is an alignment of the resulting sequences at the tips.

event in an iterative manner. An array holding the state
(variable/invariable) of each position is updated at each
event according to the change in the proportion of variable sites specified by the user. Events can be specified as
correlated, although by default they are non-correlated.
For correlated events the positions of sites that switch state
are identical, for non-correlated events these positions are
independent. An array holding the hidden states of the
covarion model is also passed down the tree. For each site,
along each branch, exponential times for switches are generated; the hidden states array is updated at the internal
nodes of each subtree according to the specified covarion
model and the switch rate for each event. The sequence at
each event is used as the ancestral sequence for the subtree
beneath it. The output is an alignment of the resulting tip
sequences.
For the reasons described in the Background, we added a
default option where branch lengths are defined as the
mean expected numbers of substitutions per variable site.
This definition allows the substitution rate across variable
sites to be independent of the proportion of invariable
sites. When branch lengths are defined as the mean
expected numbers of substitutions per variable site, the

processes of evolution simulated by both specified partitions and specified Pinv are equivalent.

Results and discussion
Example 1 – generating data containing a change in the
proportion of variable sites
To demonstrate the use of the program for generating
datasets containing a change in the proportion of variable
sites, the Jukes-Cantor (JC) model was used to generate
sequences of length 10,000 bp on the 16-taxon rooted
balanced tree shown in Figure 2. This tree is input as:

((((A:0.1,
B:0.1):0.1,(C:0.1,
D:0.1):0.1):0.2,((E:0.1,
F:0.1):0.1,(G:0.1,
H:0.1):0.1):0.1$1st_event:0.1):0.02,(((I:0.1,
J:0.1):0.1,(K:0.1, L:0.1):0.1):0.1$2nd_event:0.1,((M:0.1,
N:0. 1):0.1,(O:0.1, P:0.1):0.1):0.2):0.02);
In this example, the proportion of invariable sites (Pinv)
at the root was set to 0.8. At each of the two events 0.2 of
the invariable sites were "switched on" (became variable).
The two events were set to be correlated so that the positions of sites that are turned on in the two events are identical. The expected proportion of variable sites in groups 1

in the proportion of variable sites, the JC model was used
to generate 100 datasets of length 10,000 bp on the 4taxon rooted balanced tree shown in Figure 3.
This tree is input as:
((A:0.4, B:0.3$1st_event:0.1):0.02,(C:0.3$2nd_event:0.1,
D:0.4):0.02);
As in the former example, Pinv at the root was set to 0.8
and the two events were set to be correlated. At each of the

and 4 is thus 0.2, and the expected proportion of variable
sites in groups 2 and 3 is 0.36. Consequentially, 0.64 of
the sites are invariable across all four groups, and 0.16 of
the sites are variable in groups 2 and 3 and invariable in
groups 1 and 4. For comparison, two control datasets were
generated on a 16-taxon rooted balanced tree without the
two events; the same branch lengths were used as before,
and Pinv was set to either 0 or 0.8. For each group, and
each pair of groups, the number of sites that varied in each
of the three simulated sequence alignments is shown in
Table 1.

two events Pvar+ = (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) percent of the
invariable sites were "switched on". The program MrBayes
[22] was used to reconstruct the trees, assuming a JC
model with invariable sites and a covarion process
(JC+I+covarion). The number of times with which each of
the three possible 4-taxon trees was reconstructed with the
highest proportional frequency in the Bayesian analysis
were compared to determine tree reconstruction accuracy.
As shown in figure 4, the higher the increase in the proportion of variable sites in lineages B and C, the lower the
tree reconstruction accuracy. These results suggest that, at
least for some parts of the parameter space, a covarion
model which assumes a constant proportion of variable
sites is not adequate for tree reconstruction from data containing changes in the proportion of variable sites.
