Abstract
Background: Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are prosthetic groups required to sustain fundamental life processes
including electron transfer, metabolic reactions, sensing, signaling, gene regulation and stabilization of protein
structures. In plants, the biogenesis of Fe-S protein is compartmentalized and adapted to specific needs of the cell.
Many environmental factors affect plant development and limit productivity and geographical distribution. The
impact of these limiting factors is particularly relevant for major crops, such as soybean, which has worldwide
economic importance.
Results: Here we analyze the transcriptional profile of the soybean cysteine desulfurases NFS1, NFS2 and ISD11
genes, involved in the biogenesis of [Fe-S] clusters, by quantitative RT-PCR. NFS1, ISD11 and NFS2 encoding two
mitochondrial and one plastid located proteins, respectively, are duplicated and showed distinct transcript levels
considering tissue and stress response. NFS1 and ISD11 are highly expressed in roots, whereas NFS2 showed no
differential expression in tissues. Cold-treated plants showed a decrease in NFS2 and ISD11 transcript levels in roots,
and an increased expression of NFS1 and ISD11 genes in leaves. Plants treated with salicylic acid exhibited
increased NFS1 transcript levels in roots but lower levels in leaves. In silico analysis of promoter regions indicated
the presence of different cis-elements in cysteine desulfurase genes, in good agreement with differential expression
of each locus. Our data also showed that increasing of transcript levels of mitochondrial genes, NFS1/ISD11, are
associated with higher activities of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase, two cytosolic Fe-S proteins.
Conclusions: Our results suggest a relationship between gene expression pattern, biochemical effects, and
transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions of cysteine desulfurase genes. Moreover, data show
proportionality between NFS1 and ISD11 genes expression.

Background
[Fe-S] clusters may be the most ancient and versatile
inorganic cofactors in biological systems. They can be
found in all living organisms, participating in electron
transfer, catalysis and regulatory processes. Besides, [FeS] clusters are involved in sensing environmental stimuli
and regulation of protein expression [1-3]. In plants, the
biogenesis of Fe-S proteins is compartmentalized and
mostly adapted to the requirements of the green tissue,
which carries out both photosynthesis and respiration,
processes that require significant amounts of Fe-S proteins. Mitochondria and plastid have their own

machineries for [Fe-S] cluster assembly, which differ in
biochemical and genetic properties. Among the Fe-S
proteins known in plant mitochondria are complexes I,
II and III of the respiratory chain and aconitase of the
citric acid cycle, and in plastids are cytochrome b6f complex, photosystem I and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase [4-7].
Three different systems for [Fe-S] clusters biosynthesis
have been identified in bacteria, all of them share
cysteine desulfurases and [Fe-S] cluster scaffold proteins.
Those systems are referred to as NIF (nitrogen fixation
system), ISC (iron-sulfur cluster assembly system) and
SUF (sulfur mobilization system) [8-10]. There are several mitochondrial proteins homologous to the bacterial
ISC system, including a group I NifS-like proteins, supporting the evolutionary relationship between a

Proteobacteria and mitochondria [5]. In yeast, it has
been shown that mitochondria are the primary site of
[Fe-S] cluster formation; however, these organelles not
only produce their own Fe-S proteins, but are also
required for the maturation of cytosolic Fe-S proteins
[11]. In the chloroplast, five different [Fe-S] cluster types
are found in various proteins, and this organelle possesses its own machinery for [Fe-S] biosynthesis which
is most similar to those found in cyanobacteria containing the SUF system and the cysteine desulfurase which
is similar to the bacterial SufS, a group II NifS-like protein [12,13].
Cysteine desulfurase is a pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of Lcysteine to L-alanine and sulfane sulfur. This occurs
through the formation of a protein-bound cysteine persulfide intermediate on a conserved cysteine residue
[14,15]. Considering that sulfide and free iron are toxic
to the cell, intracellular concentrations are thought to
be extremely low. Besides being involved in sulfur mobilization, cysteine desulfurase is proposed to be involved
in cellular iron homeostasis [16-18]. ISD11 is an essential mitochondria matrix protein, a component of the
ISC-assembly machinery, and is conserved in eukaryotes,
but not found in prokaryotes. This protein forms a
stable complex with NFS1, increases NFS1 activity, and
is essential for the enzymatic activity of several Fe-S
proteins [19,20]. Sulfur-containing defense compounds
(SDCs) are involved in stress response and their synthesis involve several genes for sulfur assimilation [21].
It is hypothesized that soybean (Glycine max) has
gone through at least two polyploidy and diploidization
events, being considered a paleopolyploid [22], still presenting many gene duplications [23]. Various stresses
can adversely affect plant growth and crop production,
such as low temperature which modifies membrane
lipid composition, thus affecting mitochondria respiratory function [24] and presumably photosynthesis.
Expression of various plant genes is regulated by abiotic
environmental stresses such as cold. Many cis-acting
elements involved in stress response and stress-inducible
genes contain cis-acting elements in their promoter
regions have been described.
Here, we identified the soybean cysteine desulfurase
genes by sequence comparison. Furthermore, we investigate the responsiveness of these genes under biotic and
abiotic stresses, as well as transcript distribution in different tissues. Association between the high transcript
level of mitochondrial genes, NFS1 and ISD11, and an
increased expression of two cytosolic Fe-S proteins is
showing here. Our data also demonstrate the relationship between the presence of specific cis-elements and
regulation of transcript levels under various conditions.

Results
Sequence analysis

Comparative protein analyses showed that there are four
cysteine desulfurase genes in G. max, corresponding to
loci Glyma01g40510, Glyma09g02450, Glyma11g04800
and Glyma15g13350. These proteins can be classified
into two groups: the first group is composed of IscS-like
proteins, mitochondrial cysteine desulfurases, which are
encoded by the genes located on chromosome 01 and
11 (NFS1_Chr01 and NFS1_Chr11); the second group
encompasses SufS-like proteins, plastid cysteine desulfurases, which are encoded by genes located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 15 (NFS2_Chr09 and
NFS2_Chr15). Soybean NFS1 genes share 94% nucleic
acid similarity and 98% protein identity, while NFS2
genes share 96% nucleic acid similarity and 97% protein
identity. When compared to Arabidopsis thaliana
sequences, NFS1 proteins have 76% protein identity,
whereas NFS2 have 77%. Pfam analysis demonstrated
that all genes encode for an aminotransferase class-V
motif and alignment analysis showed the location of a
cysteine in the active site and a histidine and alanine in
the cofactor binding site (Additional files 1 and 2). To
find ISD11 genes, we used sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and A. thaliana as queries against the
Glyma1 genome. We found two loci that encode ISD11
orthologs, Glyma08g26490 and Glyma18g49970, showing 87% protein identity (Additional file 3). Soybean
genes that encode NFS1, NFS2 and ISD11 appear at
least twice on different chromosomes due to duplication
events [25].
Phylogenetic analysis

Comparative amino acid analysis of IscS-like and SufSlike proteins of different plants and bacterial species
showed that conserved regions varied from 54 to 98%
and from 37 to 97% identity, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of organisms has shown
that cysteine desulfurases form three independent clusters (Figure 1). One clade was composed by all
sequences from the ISC system, and divided into monocots, dicots and bacteria, forming three subclades. The
second cluster contained bacterial and algae sequences
of cysteine desulfurases from the NIF system. The third
clade was composed of proteins from the SUF system,
and subdivided into three clades, showing the same
branching as the ISC system. Some bacterial and all
mitochondria located proteins clustered together; some
bacterial, cyanobacterial and all plastid located proteins
were also found in one cluster. This is in agreement
with the endosymbiotic theory, which establishes a relationship between the endosymbiotic host and the bacterial ancestors [5].

Transcript analysis of cysteine desulfurases and ISD11
genes in soybean

Considering that Fe-S proteins are involved in environmental or cellular sensing [5], quantitative RT-PCR was
performed in order to investigate transcript levels of
cysteine desulfurases and ISD11 in soybean. We
designed gene-specific primers for NFS1_Chr01, NFS1_Chr11, NFS2_Chr09 and NFS2_Chr15 and analyzed the
expression pattern of leaves and roots from non-treated
plants and plants treated with salicylic acid (SA) and
cold incubation. Further, to study whether ISD11 transcript levels are co-regulated with the NFS1 expression
pattern, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR with nontreated and cold-treated plants. For all studied genes the
transcript levels were normalized to the transcript levels
of F-BOX and Metalloprotease [26].
In order to determine whether duplicated genes have
differential expression profiles, we analyzed mRNA
accumulation in control plants. These analyses showed
that each cysteine desulfurase gene is individually
expressed indicating a differential response to environmental stimuli. As the duplicated genes share a high
degree amino acid identity, we summed expression
levels from both copies to compare total NFS1 and
NFS2 mRNA accumulation. While NFS1_Chr01 is predominantly expressed in roots, we found higher
NFS1_Chr11 transcript levels in leaves. In sum, a higher
level is found in roots (Figure 2a). NFS2_Chr15 shows a
higher expression in both organs as compared to
NFS2_Chr09. NFS2_Chr09 transcripts mostly accumulate in roots and those of NFS2_Chr15 in leaves (Figure
2b). In both organs, ISD11_Chr18 shows a higher
expression level than ISD11_Chr08. Taken together, a
higher level was found in roots (Figure 2c). As shown in
Genevestigator database, NFS1 is highly expressed in
roots than in leaves in Arabidopsis thaliana, while NFS2
is predominantly expressed in leaves [27].
It appeared that cold-treated plants exhibited a differential response depending on the gene and tissue. In
roots, NFS1_Chr01 showed a higher expression than
NFS1_Chr11 during the whole treatment. While
NFS1_Chr01 transcript level decreased upon cold treatment, those of NFS1_Chr11 increased (Figure 3a). Sum
analysis showed that total NFS1 mRNA in roots did not
respond to cold treatment (Figure 3). In leaves,
NFS1_Chr11 was higher expressed than NFS1_Chr01
during the whole treatment. NFS1_Chr01 transcript
level oscillated, and NFS1_Chr11 increased its expression during cold treatment (Figure 3b). Total NFS1
mRNA increased in leaves after cold incubation (Figure
3). These results corroborate with A. thaliana database,
where leaves improve expression during cold treatment,
while roots do not change [27]. Cold-treatment induced
a decrease in both NFS2_Chr09 and NFS2_Chr15

transcript levels in roots reaching a comparable expression level at 5, 10 and 24 h (Figure 3c) (Figure 3). In
leaves, NFS2_Chr15 showed a higher expression level
than NFS2_Chr09 during the whole treatment. While
NFS2_Chr09 transcript levels decreased, NFS2_Chr15
increased at 24 h (Figure 3d). Sum analysis showed that
cold-treatment induced a decrease in NFS2 genes transcript levels (Figure 3). In roots, ISD11_Chr18 was
higher expressed than ISD11_Chr08 during the whole
treatment. While ISD11_Chr18 transcript levels
increased were cold induced, ISD11_Chr08 did not show

changes in expression (Figure 3e). Sum analysis revealed
that total ISD11 mRNA initially decreased and then
reached the former level in roots upon cold treatment
(Figure 3). In leaves, ISD11_Chr18 showed a higher
expression than ISD11_Chr08 during whole treatment,
but both genes were upregulated upon cold treatment
(Figure 3f).

When treated with 2 mM SA, the response of cysteine
desulfurase expression varies depending on tissue and
gene. In roots, both NFS1 genes were upregulated upon
SA incubation. Thus, sum analysis showed that NFS1
mRNA level after SA treatment was significantly higher
than before (Figure 4a). In leaves, NFS1_Chr01
decreased expression, while NFS1_Chr11 did not show

any changes. Total NFS1 mRNA level decreased due to
SA treatment (Figure 4b). When A. thaliana were treated with 2 mM SA during 24 hours, NFS1 expression
was induced [27]. NFS2 transcript levels did not change
in roots (Figure 4c). In leaves, NFS2_Chr15 showed a
significant decrease in expression, while NFS2_Chr09
did not change. Sum analysis, for leaf, did not show any
changes in expression (Figure 4d).
Cis-elements search in promoter regions

To identify putative cis-elements present in the NFS1
and NFS2 promoters, we inspected the sequences 1,500
bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of all genes
using the Plant Cis-Acting Regulatory Elements (PlantCARE) database [28]. The analysis identified a total of
178, 168, 163 and 151 hits for potential cis-elements
putative transcription factor binding sites in
NFS1_Chr01,
NFS1_Chr11,
NFS2_Chr09
and
NFS2_Chr15, respectively. While some of the predicted
cis-elements were present multiple times in the promoters, others occurred only once. All putative transcription factor binding sites with known function are shown
in Table 1. Comparative analysis among cysteine desulfurase promoter regions showed sequence similarity
between 8 and 66%, and that the amount of shared ciselements varies from 38.2 to 76.9% (Figure 5). Comparing duplicated genes, they have a high promoter region

similarity, and NFS1 and ISD11 promoters diverged less
than those of NFS2 genes (Figure 5). The relationship
between some motifs and our quantitative RT-PCR
results are shown in Table 2.
Coincidence of increased NFS1/ISD11 transcript levels and
activities of cytosolic Fe-S enzymes

Aldehyde oxidase (AO) catalyzes the conversion of an
aldehyde to an acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen and water and Xanthine dehydrogenase
(XDH) catalyzes the hydrogenation of xanthine to urate.
Both enzymes require FAD, molybdenum and two [2Fe2S] clusters as cofactors. Therefore, AO and XDH activities are directly dependent on the mitochondrial [Fe-S]
cluster assembly machinery. Hence, we analyzed the
activity of AO and XDH using an in-gel activity assay
[29]. In comparison to unstressed leaves, XDH activities
were clearly enhanced upon cold treatment while AO
activities increased only moderately under these conditions. Crude extract were obtained from three independent treatment (Figure 6), indicating that NFS1/ISD11
are required for [Fe-S] cluster assembly on both proteins
tested.

plants [6,32]. In our phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1), it
was possible to identify three distinct groups, composed
of proteins from ISC, NIF and SUF systems. G. max
protein sequences were located in plant clades near to
M. truncatula. Comparing our phylogenetic approach
and the described polyploidy events [30], it was possible
to hypothesize that analyzed cysteine desulfurase genes
were duplicated after the divergence of soybean and M.
truncatula. Thus, soybean has two copies of each
cysteine desulfurase gene, while M. truncatula has only
one copy (Figure 1). Both species contain duplicated
ISD11 genes (data not shown). Therefore, this polyploidy event may have occurred prior to divergence of
both lines.
The present results suggest that NFS1 and NFS2 soybean genes, which encode proteins involved in sulfur
assimilation and [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis [16], are
involved in response to cold stress and SA. Sulfur is an
essential macronutrient which is assimilated to cysteine
[33,34], which will take part in the assembly of SDCs.
When exposed to biotic and/or abiotic stress, synthesis
of SDCs is induced via different signals, demonstrating
their potential involvement in stress defense. There is
an increased demand for cysteine as a precursor due to
SDCs synthesis; therefore, the expression of genes for
sulfur assimilation is induced [21]. Analyzing cold-treated plants, it is possible to observe that, in leaves, NFS1
and NFS2 genes increased transcript levels (Figure 3),
perhaps due to SDCs stress response or due to its possible role in SDCs synthesis. When treated with SA, a
simulator of biotic stress, NFS1 genes changed their
expression pattern (Figure 4). In both experiments we
observed a particular expression pattern, i.e. organs with
primary contact to the stressor showed an increase in
cysteine desulfurase transcript levels, while those less
exposed showed a lower expression (Figures 3 and 4).
This opposite profile may be due to a compensatory

soybean and Medicago truncatula. In addition, it was
suggested that a relatively recent polyploidy event
occurred in the soybean lineage [22,30]. All analyzed
genes are present in duplicate on different chromosomes
showing a high degree of conservation and share important characteristics [25]. Due to the polyploidy events,
mutations and gene rearrangements occurred, resulting
in diversification of gene expression [31]. Here, we present the characterization of the promoters of soybean
NFS1and NFS2 genes, and identified tissue- and stressspecific response in expression of cysteine desulfurase
and ISD11 genes both involved in [Fe-S] cluster
biosynthesis.
Three different systems responsible for [Fe-S] cluster
biosynthesis have been described [3], and involved genes
appear to be conserved in bacteria, fungi, animals and

mechanism present in early stress response, and it may
change if plants are exposed to longer stress periods.
When the plant cell are exposed to biotic or abiotic
stress factors, modifications of the lipid composition of
its membranes occur [35]. Soybean mitochondria show
modifications in lipid content in response to low temperature [36], and this can alter respiratory properties
and gene expression [24,37]. As many proteins involved
in respiration, such as complexes I, II and III, are Fe-S
proteins [4], a modification in the respiratory profile
may change the requirement for proteins of the [Fe-S]
cluster biosynthesis pathway, i.e. altering the expression
of cysteine desulfurase genes. Stress dependent changes
in gene expression occur in the cytoplasm as well as in
chloroplasts. Whereas mitochondria developed an
export system for [Fe-S] clusters that is essential for
maturation of many nuclear and cytosolic proteins, [FeS] cluster biosynthesis in mitochondria has a direct
impact on protein activity, such as for aldehyde oxidase
and xanthine dehydrogenase [16,38,39] as shown in Figure 6. The chloroplast is extremely sensitive to abiotic
stress factors, such as elevated temperature and light,
both increasing reactive oxygen species. Glutathione is
involved in protection against oxidative damage triggered by biotic and abiotic stress in the cytosol and
other cellular compartments. Synthesis of this peptide
depends on sulfur assimilation and cysteine synthesis
[21,33,34], as this amino acid is the substrate of cysteine
desulfurase [14,40], a change in cysteine content may
lead to a modification in its catalytic properties.
SA and its methylated form are involved in development, and are also fundamental for hypersensitive
response and for systemic acquired resistance under biotic stress [41,42]. SA can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, and these can react with various
molecules in the cell, including lipids. As the organelle
is often exposed to strong oxidative stress, some antioxidant enzymes should be simultaneously upregulated. An
alternative oxidase has been proposed to represent a
functional marker for mitochondrial dysfunction during
biotic stress, and its content is increased in SA-treated
soybean [35,43]. The treatment with SA causes mitochondrial dysfunction via oxidative stress causing
changes in the cysteine desulfurase expression. This
enzyme transfers electrons from reduced ubiquinone to
molecular oxygen, bypassing complexes III and IV [24],
and complex III contains [Fe-S] cluster [4]. In addition,
SA-treated soybean altered the fatty acid composition of
its mitochondria. As these organelles modified their
membranes upon SA treatment, and cellular respiration

involves Fe-S proteins, the expression of cysteine desulfurase may be altered under biotic stress.
The present quantitative RT-PCR results revealed a
relationship between NFS1 and ISD11 transcript contents in roots and leaves as both genes showed a similar
expression pattern (Figure 2). Moreover, to analyze
whether an increase in NFS1 expression triggers an
increase in ISD11 transcript levels, we studied ISD11
expression levels under cold stress. In roots, total ISD11
mRNA decreased during the treatment and recovered to
the initial level after 24 h, while NFS1 transcript levels
did not change. In leaves, both genes were upregulated
(Figure 3). The similarity in expression pattern between
these genes may be explained by their function. NFS1 is
a cysteine desulfurase involved in [Fe-S] biosynthesis in
mitochondria [6], whereas Isd11 was recently identified
in yeast as a protein responsible for forming a stable
complex with Nfs1 [19,20]. Besides interacting with the
cysteine desulfurase, ISD11 showed in humans an
important role in mitochondrial and cytosolic iron
homeostasis [44] mediated by NFS1 [18]. Here, we
demonstrated that interaction between mitochondrial
genes NFS1/ISD11 increased expression and maturation
of cytosolic enzymes XDH and AO. These results corroborate with data described for yeast, which associates
the mitochondrial machinery for [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis as being responsible for maturation of cytosolic FeS proteins. Also, results in Figure 6, show, for the first
time, a direct relation among increase expression of
both cytosolic Fe-S protein (XDH and AO) and mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase as a result of cold stress
conditions. Moreover, our results are in agreement with
the experiments involved co-expression of NFS1 and
ISD11 of A. thaliana, which show a higher stability of
NFS1 when co-expressed with ISD11 may suggesting
that the interaction of NFS1/ISD11 promote the correct
conformational structure of NFS1 (de Oliveira, LA and
Frazzon, APG personal communication).
The soybean genome contains highly similar genes integrated in wider regulatory networks involved in differential
regulation, including the presence of cis-acting regulatory
elements in promoter regions [31]. Therefore, we analyzed
DNA sequences to predict putative transcription factor
binding sites located in the -1500 bp promoter regions.
Duplicated genes have highly homologous promoter
regions (Figure 5). When cis-elements were compared, all
genes share high degree of common binding sites (Figure
5), suggesting that cysteine desulfurase genes share regulatory networks. In spite of this similarity, it has been shown
that different environmental factors may trigger gene
expression (Figures 2, 3 and 4). Since a complex molecular
network is involved in regulation of gene expression and
transcription factors are important components that lead
to activation or repression of transcription [45], the

Page 10 of 14

differences observed may be due to the requirements of
the corresponding factors in a particular tissue or organelle. The analysis of transcription factor binding sites
provided an insight into transcript level data. Cis-elements
related to quantitative RT-PCR experiments are shown in
Table 2. A Py-rich element was found in NFS1_Chr11 and
NFS2_Chr15 genes that showed high transcription levels
in leaves and in both leaves and roots, respectively. An
ARE element was found in NFS1_Chr01, which displayed
higher expression in roots than in leaves, whereas promoters with an as-2-box element showed higher expression in
leaves. The TCA-element, related to SA response, was
found in NFS1 genes that changed transcription pattern
under this stress. Besides, all genes had cis-elements
related to defense and stress (TC-rich) and to drought
response (MBS), and several genes are induced by both
drought and cold stress, indicating a crosstalk between signaling pathways [46].

Conclusions
In this study, we carried out an analysis of cysteine
desulfurase genes from soybean, which are involved in
[Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis. This study suggests that
NFS1 and NFS2 genes are involved in stress response,
and that their differential expression may be due to the
presence of different cis-elements (Figure 7). Furthermore, ISD11 displayed an expression pattern similar to
NFS1 genes, supporting a positive correlation in their
activity. Our results provide the first insight into differential expression of duplicated genes involved in [Fe-S]
cluster pathway, but further research is needed to determine whether other genes involved in [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis follow this pattern.
Methods
Identification of [Fe-S] cluster genes in soybean

To identify cysteine desulfurase-encoding genes from
the annotations of Glyma1 in the soybean genome, a
similarity search method was performed. We used a
protein sequence data set of known cysteine desulfurases from A. thaliana, Synechocystis sp. and Escherichia coli, and the modeled proteome data of annotated
genes downloaded from Phytozome [47]. To confirm
the protein identity, sequences were subjected to a profile search using Pfam [48]. Besides, the search results
for each cysteine desulfurase were then applied to
retrieve discovered regions as conserved active sites and
cofactor binding amino acids. Other genes that encode
proteins involved in [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, such as
ISD11, were found using the strategy described above.
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequence alignments of cysteine desulfurase proteins
were performed using ClustalX2 [49] with default

Figure 7 Overview of expression control of NFS1 and NFS2 genes. This model shows some cis-elements found within the promoter regions
of cysteine desulfurases genes (green and red boxes). According to our qPCR data and in silico analysis those genes have particular expression
triggers, indicated above the cis-elements (blue boxes). NFS1_Chr01 is modulated by stresses, such as cold and salicylic acid (SA), and induced in
roots. NFS1_Chr11 is modulated by the same stimuli but induced in leaves. NFS2_Chr09 is modulated by cold, whereas NFS2_Chr15 is modulated
by the same stress and induced in leaves. In plastid (bottom), cysteine desulfurase catalyses the release of sulfur from cysteine to [Fe-S] cluster
biogenesis in order to organelle request. In mitochondria (top), the same process occurs to provide clusters to the organelle and cytosol/
nucleus, being stimulated by a small protein called ISD11 (light green box). An export system, including an ABC transporter, is involved in
maturation of Fe-S proteins outside mitochondria. Some Fe-S proteins in cytosol and nucleus are involved in cellular sensing, controlling gene
expression.

[50]. Phylogenetic analysis was made with the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) Package
Version 4.0 [51] with Neighbor-Joining method. Pairwise deletion was used to analyze gap and missing data
in the alignments. The bootstrap test was performed
with 1000 replications, and only the bootstraps values
higher than 80% are displayed as black dots on the

DNA sequence analysis

To predict the transcription factor binding sites located
in the -1500 bp promoter regions of each soybean analyzed gene, we retrieved the -1500 bp upstream
sequence from the putative transcription start site for
each gene from the Glyma1 annotation. After that, the
analysis of each promoter region was performed using
the Plant Cis-Acting Regulatory Elements (PlantCARE)
database [28]. Phylogenetic analysis of promoter regions
was performed as described above, and percentage of
bootstrap values are shown at branches.

Plant material and treatments

To study the responsiveness of cysteine desulfurase genes
under stress, two different experiments were performed.
For cold and SA treatments, we used the soybean (G. max
[L.] Merr.) cv. IAS-5 and cv. Conquista seeds, respectively.
Plants were grown in plastic pots (3 seeds per pot), filled
with vermiculite and solution of half-strength MS medium
[52], in a controlled environment growth chamber at 16/8
h of day/night (22.5 μmol m-2 s-1) photoperiod at 28 ± 1°
C. For cold treatment, after 11 days, seedlings were transferred to a plastic pot, under the same conditions, containing one seedling. At the age of 27 days, plants were
submitted to cold stress at 4°C for 0, 5, 10 and 24 hours.
For SA treatment, plants were kept for 14 days in vermiculite, and then transferred to a hydroponic solution (halfstrength MS medium) with additional 2 mM SA for 48 h.
Control plants were submitted to the same conditions
without SA addition. After both treatments, root and leaf
tissues were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C till further use. All the analyses were performed
in biological quadruplicates.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR

To study the expression of cysteine desulfurase genes,
samples from control and treated plants were collected
(n = 4 per each group). Total RNA was isolated from
frozen tissues by extraction with Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quality
was evaluated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel.
Prior to quantitative RT-PCR, RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Promega) at 37°C for 30 min. Reverse
transcription reactions were performed using the MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted in an ABI 7500
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) using SYBR
Green I (Invitrogen) to detect double-strand cDNA synthesis. Soybean F-BOX (F-Box protein family) and MET
(insulin-degrading enzyme, metalloprotease) genes were
used as reference genes for data normalization and to calculate the relative mRNA levels. Reactions were done in a
volume of 20 μL containing 10 μL of cDNA, 0.1 × SYBR
Green I (Invitrogen), 0.025 mM dNTP, 1 × PCR Buffer, 3
mM MgCl2, 0.25 U Platinum Taq DNA Polimerase (Invitrogen), and 200 nM of each reverse and forward primers.
A negative control without cDNA template was included
for each primer combination. Primer sequences for quantitative RT-PCR were as follows: for NFS1_Chr01,
NFS1_01R 5’-CCTCCCAATTCTCTCCATCGGT-3’, and
for NFS1_Chr11, NFS1_11R 5’-CCTCCCAATTTCCTCCATGGGC-3’ with the same forward primer NFS1F 5’CGGAGCACAAGTGCGTCC-3’; for NFS2_Chr09,
NFS2_09R 5’-CCCGTGCACTTGAGCTGACA-3’, and for
NFS2_Chr15,
NFS2_15R
5’-

CACGTGCACTTGAGCTGACG-3’ with the same forward primer NFS2F 5’-GTCGAACGAGCTGCCCTTTG3’; for ISD11_Chr08, ISD11_08R 5’- CGCTGCGGAGCGGAGAAT-3’, and for ISD11_Chr18, ISD11_18R 5’TTGCGGAGCGGAGGGG -3’ with the same forward primer ISD11F 5’-TCCACCGCCTTCGCCC-3’. These primers set generated amplicon sizes of 200, 157 and 91 and
89 bp for NFS1, NFS2 and ISD11, respectively (Additional
file 4). The conditions were set as follows: an initial step
for polymerase activation for 5 min at 94°C, 40 cycles of
15 s at 94°C for denaturation, 10 s at 60°C for annealing,
and 15 s at 72°C for elongation, followed by a meltingcurve analysis and fluorescence measured from 60 to 95°
C. Four biological replicates and four technical replicates
for each biological replicate were used.
Activity assays

Total proteins extract from untreated and cold stress
treatment tissue were obtained from plants grown in the
same conditions as described for quantitative RT-PCR.
Protein quantification was performed by Bradford assay
(BioRad) and equal amount (100 μg) of protein was
applied in a 7.5% native PAGE gel, AO and XDH were
detected by activity staining previously described [29,53]
Data analysis

Threshold and baselines were manually determined using the
ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR SDS Software v2.0. To analyze the
relative cysteine desulfurases mRNA expression relative to
the constitutive genes, we used the 2-ΔΔCt method [54]. Student’s t test was performed to compare pairwise differences
in gene expression, following the two samples assuming
unequal variances and two-tailed distribution parameters.
For time-course treatment, 1-way ANOVA and Duncan post
hoc analysis were performed using SPSS17. The means were
considered significantly different when P < 0.05.
