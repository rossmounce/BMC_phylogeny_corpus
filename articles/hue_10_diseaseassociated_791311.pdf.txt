Abstract
Background: Xenotropic murine leukaemia viruses (MLV-X) are endogenous gammaretroviruses that infect cells
from many species, including humans. Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a retrovirus that
has been the subject of intense debate since its detection in samples from humans with prostate cancer (PC) and
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Controversy has arisen from the failure of some studies to detect XMRV in PC or
CFS patients and from inconsistent detection of XMRV in healthy controls.
Results: Here we demonstrate that Taqman PCR primers previously described as XMRV-specific can amplify
common murine endogenous viral sequences from mouse suggesting that mouse DNA can contaminate patient
samples and confound specific XMRV detection. To consider the provenance of XMRV we sequenced XMRV from
the cell line 22Rv1, which is infected with an MLV-X that is indistinguishable from patient derived XMRV. Bayesian
phylogenies clearly show that XMRV sequences reportedly derived from unlinked patients form a monophyletic
clade with interspersed 22Rv1 clones (posterior probability >0.99). The cell line-derived sequences are ancestral to
the patient-derived sequences (posterior probability >0.99). Furthermore, pol sequences apparently amplified from
PC patient material (VP29 and VP184) are recombinants of XMRV and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) a virus with an
envelope that lacks tropism for human cells. Considering the diversity of XMRV we show that the mean pairwise
genetic distance among env and pol 22Rv1-derived sequences exceeds that of patient-associated sequences
(Wilcoxon rank sum test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001 for pol and env, respectively). Thus XMRV sequences acquire
diversity in a cell line but not in patient samples. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis
that published XMRV sequences are related by a process of infectious transmission.
Conclusions: We provide several independent lines of evidence that XMRV detected by sensitive PCR methods in
patient samples is the likely result of PCR contamination with mouse DNA and that the described clones of XMRV
arose from the tumour cell line 22Rv1, which was probably infected with XMRV during xenografting in mice. We
propose that XMRV might not be a genuine human pathogen.

Background
XMRV (Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus)
is a xenotropic murine leukaemia virus (MLV-X) that has
been detected in samples from prostate cancer (PC) and
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients [1-6]. This has
led to the suggestion that infection with this virus might
cause these conditions. MLV-Xs are endogenous gamma

retroviruses found in the genomes of mice. They are so
named because in vitro they infect cells from a variety of
species but were originally found not to infect the inbred
strains of mice from which they were derived, due to
mutations in the host xenotropic receptor. More recently,
murine xenotropic receptor variants have been described
which support MLV-X infection revealing a complex evolutionary relationship between MLV-X envelope
sequences and their receptors in rodents [7-9]. XMRV has
also been detected in 1-6% of healthy human controls in
some studies, suggesting that infection may be common in
the healthy human population [2,3,5]. The association

between XMRV and human disease is controversial, with
some studies detecting XMRV in up to 67% of patients
whilst others have failed to detect XMRV infection
[10-18]. Importantly, examination of infected prostate
tumours reveals that not all the tumour cells are infected
with XMRV suggesting that XMRV insertion is not
required for tumourogenesis [1]. XMRV sequences
detected in patients are remarkably similar to each other
often differing by only a few nucleotides between unlinked
patients [2]. This lack of sequence variation appears inconsistent with a retrovirus infecting geographically separated,
unconnected individuals. Here, we have examined the specificity of XMRV PCR, XMRV sequence variation and the
phylogenetic relationship between XMRV detected in
humans and as contaminants in cell culture. We conclude
that XMRV in patient samples is likely to be derived from
PCR contamination from either mouse DNA or cell lines
infected with XMRV, and that XMRV is unlikely to be a
human pathogen.

Results and Discussion
Primers reported to be XMRV specific can detect mouse
DNA

To better understand the provenance of XMRV [1,2] we
screened nine inbred and three wild-derived inbred
mouse strains with Taqman PCR primers previously
used to specifically detect XMRV. We selected the
mouse lines to be widely spread across the inbred genealogy [19] and to be available as DNA from the JAX
database, Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor, Maine. We
first used primers targeting a 24 nt deletion in the gagleader region reported to be XMRV-specific [1,4]. Significantly, all 12 mouse strains were PCR positive (Table
1). We also detected this reportedly-specific deletion in
the gag-leader of endogenous proviruses in 4 mouse
strains (129X1/SvJ, Balb/cJ, CBA/J and LPT/LeJ) by 454
deep sequencing (Roche) the PCR product amplified
with primers flanking the deletion (Figure 1 Table 1 and
Additional File 1; Table S1). The deletion was at a low
frequency, consistent with it being present in just one
(or a few) of many endogenous proviral copies
compared to other murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs)
present in higher copy numbers. Since some Taqman
PCR-positive mice were negative for this 24 nt gagleader deletion by deep sequencing, we conclude that
either these Taqman primers are not specific for the
deletion, or that endogenous murine leukaemia virus
(MLV) sequences with the deletion were not always
PCR-amplified in this deep sequencing experiment, possibly due to primer mismatch. We certainly cannot
compare deep sequencing with Taqman PCR in terms
of sensitivity, but both of these techniques suggest that
the gag-leader deletion can be found in the genome of
some inbred mouse strains. We found further evidence

for this XMRV signature sequence in GenBank: a 1124
nt sequence encoding the “XMRV-specific” gag-leader
24 nt deletion is present in the genome of 129X1/SvJ
strain mice (AAHY01591888 Figure 1). We also tested
the specificity of XMRV integrase Taqman primers
previously used to screen for XMRV [5]. Amplification
of mouse genomic DNA showed high copy (2 strains),
low copy (6 strains) and undetectable (4 strains) levels
of amplifyable MLV provirus using these primers (Table
1). These data indicate that primer sets previously
described as XMRV-specific can readily amplify MLV
sequences from a variety of mice when used under the
PCR conditions described [4,5,14], and that some targets
exist at high copy number in genomes of mice.
Human cell lines are commonly contaminated with
xenotropic MLVs

Human cell lines have been found contaminated with
gammaretroviruses including xenotropic murine leukaemia viruses (MLV-X) [20,21]. They are likely to have
been transmitted to human cells during cell passage as
grafts in mice, or when human cells are cultured
together with mouse cells. In order to explore the frequency and genetic diversity of XMRV-like sequences in
cell culture, we screened 411 cell lines from the COSMIC collection (Additional File 2; Table S2) [22]. We
chose this collection as a source of well characterized
human tumour cell lines of different tumour types. We
used Taqman primers for the XMRV gag-leader deletion
[4], the XMRV integrase [5], and also used primers
designed to amplify diverse MLV-X gag sequences[14]
(Additional File 1; Table S1). Nine human cell lines
(2.2%) were positive using MLV-X-gag primers
(Table 2). Five of these nine lines were also positive
using XMRV gag-leader primers[4]; but none were positive using XMRV-integrase primers [5] (Table 2). Direct
sequencing of gag, pol and env PCR products amplified
from these cell lines revealed a single sequence in most
cases (Table 2). Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences
confirmed that the contaminating viruses are closely
related to MLV-X previously found infecting cultured
human cell lines[20] (Additional File 3; Figure S1).
Importantly, MLV-X viruses in human cell lines, including XMRV, are contained within the genetic diversity of
known murine viruses and do not represent an outgroup or a specific clade that is more common in
human tumour cell lines. Thus human cell lines commonly carry retroviruses that can be amplified with primers erroneously described as specific to XMRV [4,5].

[23] and exogenous [24] can reveal information about

Mice names and Jackson lab identification numbers (ID) are shown as are the proportion of positive 454-sequencing reads that contain the XMRV 24 nt deletion
signature sequence compared to the total number of reads obtained from each amplification reaction. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for Taqman PCR performed
with primer sets targeting XMRV gag-leader, integrase and MLV-X-gag are also shown. Template amounts were 1 ng, 200 ng and 2 ng respectively. Lower
amounts of genomic DNA were used in gag and gag-leader PCRs due to the high number of amplicons detected. We define positive PCR as those with a Ct of
less than 41. This cut off was chosen on the basis that PCR quantitation of plasmid concentrations of 5 molecules per PCR give Ct values of 40. PCR detection of
concentrations below 5 molecules became stochastic and are thus below the limit of reliable detection (data not shown). Primers are shown in Table S1.

their replication and evolutionary history. We therefore
performed extensive evolutionary analysis of published
XMRV and related sequences in order to better understand their origin and proliferation. The widely studied
prostate cancer line 22Rv1 is reported to produce high
levels of a virus closely related to XMRV [25,26]. We
therefore cloned and sequenced gag (n = 16), pol (n =
18) and env (n = 10) PCR products amplified from
genomic DNA purified from this cell line. Of these, 13/
16 gag sequences, 15/18 pol sequences and 8/10 env
sequences were unique. These numbers are consistent
with the previously estimated XMRV copy number in

sequences from four inbred mice containing the 24 nt deletion

genome are shown for comparison and all sequences are compared

the 22Rv1 cell line of 10-20 copies [25]. We analysed
these unique cell line sequences together with (i) previously-described full-length endogenous MLV genomes
[27] (n = 46), (ii) a previously described XMRV clone
from the 22Rv1 cell line (n = 1 [26] GenBank:
FN692043) (iii) full-length XMRV sequences reportedly
amplified from PC (n = 6)[1], or CFS patient samples (n
= 2)[2], (iv) previously reported XMRV pol sequences
derived from PC patient material (n = 6)[1], (v) additional C57BL/6 endogenous full-length MLV sequences
identified using BLAT (n = 28), and (vi) various other
MLV complete genomes (n = 5).
Quite unexpectedly, visual inspection of the 2552 nt
XMRV pol sequences [1] revealed that sequences VP29
and VP184, which were apparently amplified from PC
patient material, are recombinants of the 22Rv1 cell line
virus and Moloney MLV (MoMLV). A nucleotide
BLAST search revealed that the Moloney MLV derived
fragment from VP29 (1182 nt) is 100% identical to
MoMLV (GenBank AF033811), 11 nucleotides different
to the closest known mouse endogenous MLV (GenBank AC153360) and 22 nucleotides different to the
XMRV clone derived from the 22Rv1 cell line
(FN692043). The recombinant nature of VP29 and
VP184 was confirmed by phylogenetic incongruence
analysis (Additional File 4; Figure S2). The fact that
MoMLV envelope does not have tropism for human
cells, that these PCR products were derived from human

material, and that the 1182 nt XMRV fragment is identical to common MLV-based plasmids, strongly suggests
PCR contamination as the source of the recombinant.
Next, we investigated the evolutionary relationships
among the aforementioned sequences (excluding identical 22Rv1 clone sequences and the recombinants) using
Bayesian phylogenetic methods. The resulting phylogeny
(Figure 2) clearly shows that XMRV sequences reportedly derived from unlinked patients are interspersed
among sequences derived from the 22Rv1 cell line
within a single strongly supported monophyletic cluster
(posterior probability >0.99; Figure 2). These results
were consistent when phylogenies were reconstructed
on the basis of the gag, pol and env gene independently
(see Additional File 5; Figure S3). In addition to the
interspersion of cell line and patient derived sequences,
cell line-derived sequences are basal to the patientderived sequences (Figure 2). However, many of the
XMRV and XMRV related sequences are so closely
related to each other that the precise branching order
within the XMRV cluster could not be elucidated with
robust support. As a result no one particular clone
could be identified as the ancestor of the cluster with
high statistical support in either the full length (Figure
2) or gene specific (Additional File 5; Figure S3) trees.
To examine this further, we inspected the 3000 most
probable Bayesian trees obtained from the full-length
alignment (Figure 2) and found that a cell line derived
sequence was basal to the XMRV cluster in every case
(data not shown). Thus, the estimated posterior probability that the ancestor of the cluster was not a cell line
derived sequence was <0.001. Together these observations support the notion that the 22Rv1 cell line XMRV
sequences are ancestral to the patient-associated XMRV
sequences in this analysis. We have used the tree

constructed from full-length and non-overlapping fragments rather than the gene specific trees (Additional
File 5; Figure S3) in order to include all the available
variation within the XMRV sequences in the analysis.
Non-overlapping sequences will not induce a bias in the
Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction as long as they are
individually compared to full-length genomes.
22Rv1 associated XMRV is more diverse than patient
derived sequences

The observed genetic diversities of cell-line and patientderived sequences are also difficult to reconcile with the
hypothesis that published XMRV sequences are related
by a process of infectious transmission. The mean pairwise genetic distance among pol and env gene sequences
derived from 22Rv1 cells exceeds that among patientassociated sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p = 0.005
and p < 0.001 for pol and env, respectively; Figure 3 and
Additional File 6; Table S3). For the gag region, the mean
pairwise genetic diversities of patient-derived and cellline sequences are not significantly different (Figure 3
and Additional File 6; Table S3). In order to test for the
potential confounding factor of PCR and sequencing
errors in the 22Rv1 clones diversity, genetic distances
were re-calculated assuming that 1% of the diversity seen
in the clones was artefactual. Even under such an
extreme scenario, and assuming no sequencing error in
the patient-derived sequences, the mean pairwise genetic
diversities of patient-derived and cell-line sequences are
not significantly different in the gag and pol loci, while
the genetic distance among env gene sequences derived
from 22Rv1 cells still exceeds that among patient-associated sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p < 0.001;
data not shown). Even under the most conservative
hypothesis that XMRV undergoes almost no evolutionary

change upon transmission, we would expect sequences
sampled from geographically-disparate individuals, with
no known epidemiological linkage, to exhibit more diversity than sequences derived from a single infected cell
line. We cannot reject the possibility that cell lineassociated XMRV diversity is higher because it has
undergone more replication than XMRV in epidemiologically-unlinked individuals in different disease cohorts
or that the patients were infected by a clonal virus from
an unidentified source. However, to our knowledge, there
are no examples of reported accelerated viral evolution in
culture as compared to in natural hosts and therefore in
the context of our other results, this seems unlikely.
Another notable characteristic of the XMRV clade is
its asymmetry (B 1 asymmetry statistic = 24.47, p <
0.002). This is an expected property of families of endogenous mobile elements [23]. Phylogenetic asymmetry
implies that whenever replication occurs, one daughter
sequence tends to be inactive whilst the other continues
to proliferate. This phenomenon arises naturally when
one (or a few) active endogenous viruses in a genome
generate inactive copies by re-infection [23], but is difficult to explain under a hypothesis of host-to-host transmission. Extreme cases of strong selection among
genetically diverse variants can cause asymmetry [28],
although in this case, the lack of XMRV genetic diversity is incompatible with this possibility.
Whilst our observations cannot conclusively prove
that XMRV is not a human pathogen they appear

consistent with the hypothesis that XMRV is not an
exogenous virus transmitting among individuals. Instead,
multiple lines of evidence suggest that the full length
clones of XMRV originated from the 22Rv1 cell line.
PCR contamination could arise directly from 22Rv1 cells
or from cells inadvertently infected with the 22Rv1
derived virus. We speculate that the 22Rv1 cells became
infected with XMRV during their passage through athymic mice [29]. Data in Figure 1 demonstrate that mouse
DNA could also contaminate patient samples as a variety of mice encode sequences, with endogenous MLV
proviruses, that are detected with PCR protocols that
are designed to detect XMRV. It is quite possible therefore that previously published findings are explained by
contaminated PCR where the patient samples were contaminated by mouse DNA or DNA from cells infected
with MLV-X including that from 22Rv1 cells. A recent
study amplified polytropic MLV sequences rather than
XMRV from chronic fatigue patient samples [30] and
healthy donors. Unfortunately the MLV sequences
described there were too short to carry out a thorough
phylogenetic analysis, and we have therefore not
included them here. It is difficult to retrospectively
establish whether prior studies have contaminated
patient samples. Importantly, assay contamination cannot be assessed by detection of murine DNA alone since
MLVs contaminate a significant proportion of nonmurine cell lines common in laboratories [1,30]. PCR
contamination has previously been found to underlie
erroneous association between retroviruses and human
disease underlining the difficulties associated with
detecting pathogens by PCR [31,32].

Conclusions
We conclude that future screens for MLV-related
sequences use more rigorous PCR containment procedures, such as those used to reliably recover ancient
DNA [33], or manage contamination by controlling for
its inevitable frequency, for example by screening equal
numbers of controls prepared and stored identically,
together with test samples [34]. Positive samples must be
sequenced and those that are identical to known endogenous murine sequences, or plasmids present in the
host laboratory, should be treated with caution. Whilst
true association of XMRV with human disease would be
of great medical importance, it is imperative that such an
association is rigorously established before it impacts on
diagnosis and patient care. We suggest that XMRV as a
human virus does not conform to this criterion.
Methods
Taqman PCR

PCR of mouse genomic DNA was performed using primers/probes as previously described (Additional File 1;

Hué et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:111
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/111

Table S1) [4,5,14]. PCR conditions including buffers (a
single batch of 2× Taqman PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems)) and thermocycler conditions were also
essentially as described [4,5,14]. All human tumour cell
line Taqman PCRs were run in a duplex assay using the
Taqman® RNase P Control Reagents (VIC) (Applied Biosystems) as an internal control. Cycling conditions were
95°C for 15 secs and annealing/extension at 60°C for 1
minute after an initial denaturation of 10 min. Thresholds were routinely set at default values. Primers are
shown in Additional File 1; Table S1.
454 Sequencing of inbred and wild-derived inbred mouse
samples

Mouse DNA samples were obtained from the Jackson
Labs (Bar Harbor, Maine) except for Balb/c which was
obtained from Sigma (D4416). 100-200 ng DNA from
each mouse was amplified using Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen) proofreading polymerase and primers EG87 and
EG89 (Additional File 1; Table S1). 500 ng of amplified
DNAs were sequenced using the Genome Sequencer
FLX Instrument and GS FLX Titanium series reagents
(Roche/454 Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SFF files were processed using the
sfffile and sffinfo commands of the SFF tools, split based
on the MIDs, and FASTA files were created for each
sample. Reads containing XMRV-specific 24-nt deletion,
were identified using a customised python script and
their frequency was calculated.
PCR, direct sequencing and sequence analysis

Partial gag, pol and env sequences were amplified from
genomic DNA from human tumour cell lines using primers labelled TC in Additional File 1; Table S1. PCR
products were purified and subjected to direct sequencing, which obviated PCR error, using an Applied Biosystems 3730×l DNA analyzer. Gag, pol and env
sequences from the 22Rv1 cell line were amplified with
a single stock of Platinum Pfx (Invitrogen) proofreading
polymerase and primers labelled 22Rv1 in Additional
File 1; Table S1. PCR product was gel purified and
ligated into pZero Blunt and transformed (Invitrogen).
Positive plasmid clones derived from individual colonies
were then sequenced.
Phylogenetic analysis

22Rv1 cell line derived gag (1605 nt; n = 11), pol (1635 nt;
n = 15) and env (1935; n = 8) unique sequences were
manually aligned with 6 full-length XMRV sequences
apparently amplified from PC samples (GenBank
DQ241301, DQ241302, DQ399707, EF185282, FB579966,
NC_007815), 2 full-length XMRV sequences from CFS
patient samples (GenBank GQ497343, GQ497344), previously described pol sequences derived from PC patient

Page 7 of 10

material (VP29, VP79, VP86, VP88, VP90, VP184; n = 6)
[1], one previously reported sequence derived from the
22Rv1 tumour cell line (GenBank FN692043) [26], 46
nonecotropic endogenous MLV sequences[27], 28 endogenised MLV full-length sequences identified by BLAT
search [35] of the mouse genome using the VP62 XMRV
sequence (GenBank DQ399707) as a query, the DG-75
MLV complete genome sequence (GenBank AF221065),
one murine type C retrovirus complete genome (GenBank X94150) and one murine AIDS virus provirus complete sequence (GenBank S80082). The complete genome
sequences of AKV and Moloney MLV (GenBank J01998
and AF033811) were added as outgroups. Bayesian phylogenies were reconstructed with the software MrBayes
version 3.1.2 [36], under the General Time Reversible
model of nucleotide substitution, with proportion of
invariable sites and gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity
(GTR+I+G). GTR+I+G parameters were estimated with
the program PAUP* version 4b10[37] using full-length
genomes only, and were fixed prior to the phylogenetic
reconstruction. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) search was set to 3,000,000 iterations, with
trees sampled every 1000th generation. Maximum clade
credibility trees were selected from the posterior distribution with the program TreeAnnotator version 1.5.2
http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/, after discarding a 20% burn in.
Trees were edited with the program FigTree version 1.1.2
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/. Phylogenetic
reconstructions were also conducted in a gene-specific
manner for the gag, pol and env loci following the aformentioned methodology. The posterior probability that
the ancestor of the XMRV clade was not in the cell line
was estimated by recording the number of times a cell
line clone was not basal to the clade on a random sample
of 1000 trees extracted from the Bayesian posterior
distribution.
Tree shape was assessed using the B 1 statistic[38],
accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty by marginalizing B1 across a sample of 1000 posterior trees generated
by Mr. Bayes (B1 average = 24.27, 95% highest posterior
density interval = 20.98-26.75). The null distribution of
B1 was calculated by simulating 1000 phylogenetic trees
with 55 taxa (i.e. the size of the XMRV clade). Significance was assessed by counting the number of times B1
values less than the mean B 1 value occurred in the
simulation (2 in 1000 replicates).
The phylogenies of the gag (783 nt; n = 6), pol (381
nt; n = 9) and env (516 nt; n = 9) MLV-X sequence
fragments amplified from tumour cell lines were estimated as described above. The sequences were compared to nonecotropic endogenous MLVs (n = 95), AKV
(GenBank Acc. J01998) and Moloney MLV (GenBank
Acc. AF033811) sequences, as well as 5 XMRV
sequences apparently amplified from PC and 2 from

Hué et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:111
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/111

CFS samples. The MCMC search was set to 5,000,000
iterations, with trees sampled every 100th generations.
Recombination analysis

Following visual inspection of the gene sequences
derived from PC patient material (n = 15), a 1185 nt pol
gene fragment from patients VP29 and VP184 was used
in a nucleotide BLAST search against all available
sequences. Both fragments showed maximal identity
with two Moloney MLV complete genomes (GenBank
AF033811 and J02255; 99% and 100% identity with
VP29 and VP184 respectively). Further evidence of
recombination between XMRV and Moloney MLV was
sought by examining phylogenetic incongruence in two
maximum likelihood trees based on i) the 1185 nt pol
gene fragment (position 2400 to 3585 of the Moloney
MLV AF033811) and ii) the following 1335 nt (position
3586 to 4921). The pol sequences used for the analysis
comprised 14 patient-derived sequences (see above), one
Moloney MLV sequence (GenBank AF033811), one
AKV virus sequence (GenBank J01998) and 39 nonecotropic endogenous MLVs[27]. The trees were reconstructed under the GTR+I+G model of evolution, using
PAUP*. The robustness of the topologies was assessed
by neighbour joining bootstrapping with 1000 replicates.
Genetic distance analysis

Pairwise nucleotide differences in the gag (1605 nt), pol
(1635 nt) and env (1935 nt) of the 22Rv1 and patientassociated sequences were calculated using PAUP*[37].
Genetic distances were estimated i) as the uncorrected
number of observed nucleotide substitutions per site and
ii) under the GTR+I+G model of evolution. Prior to computation, sequences were screened for APOBEC-3G/F
mediated G > A hypermutations, using the Hypermut2.0
algorithm from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database
[39], and hypermutations masked. A total of 81 and 5
hypermutations were found in the 22Rv1 and patientassociated sequences respectively. The XMRV/Moloney
recombinants VP29 and VP184 were excluded. The null
hypothesis that genetic diversity is equal in 22Rv1 clones
and patient-derived XMRV sequences was tested using
the non-parametric Wilcoxon sum rank test.
MLV-X nucleotide sequences obtained from human
tumour cell lines have GenBank accession numbers
[FR670581-FR670601] and 22Rv1 derived sequences are
[HQ385277-HQ385320].

cell line name. Bayesian posterior probabilities > 0.90 or 1.00 are
indicated on the branches by one or two stars respectively. The scale bar
represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.
Additional file 4: Figure S2: Maximum likelihood trees showing
recombination between XMRV and MoMLV in the sequences
derived from PC patients VP29 and VP184. Between nucleotide
positions 2400 and 3585 (GenBank Acc. No. AF033811) of the MoMLV pol
gene, VP29 and VP184 pol genes are closely related to MoMLV
(bootstrap support: 100%) (A), while between positions 3586 to 4921, the
same patients derived sequences fall within the XMRV cluster (bootstrap
score: 100%) (B). Bootstrap scores above 50% are indicated on the
corresponding branches. The scale bar represents the number of
nucleotide substitutions per site.
Additional file 5: Figure S3: Bayesian maximum clade credibility
phylogeny of 22Rv1 cell line derived XMRV clones, patient derived
XMRV sequences and other murine leukaemia viruses based on the
(a) gag, (b) pol and (c) env genetic regions only. Xenotropic MLV
(MLV-X), polytropic MLV (PMLV), and modified polytropic MLV (MPMLV)
were added as controls. Sequences derived from prostate cancer patients
(VP and WO) and chronic fatigue syndrome patients (WPI) are indicated
by red and yellow circles respectively. Gene sequences derived from
22Rv1 clones are indicated by blue squares. The trees are rooted by the
mid-point rooting method. Bayesian posterior probabilities > 0.95 (*) and
of 1.00 (**) are indicated on the corresponding branches. The branching
order of the sequences within the XMRV clusters is not statistically
supported and therefore cannot be determined unambiguously from
these trees. For this reason we have reconstructed a Bayesian phylogeny
from the fragments together with the full-length XMRV sequences
(Figure 2). The scale bar represents the number of nucleotide
substitutions per site.
Additional file 6: Table S3: Genetic diversity of the cell-line and
patient-derived gag, pol and env gene sequences. Genetic distances
were calculated as i) the observed number of nucleotide substitutions
per sites and ii) under the General Time Reversible model of nucleotide
substitutions. The significance of difference in the mean genetic diversity
between cell line- and patient-derived sequences was tested by
Wilcoxon sum rank test.
