Abstract
Background: Sry is a gene known to be essential for testis determination but is also transcribed in adult male
tissues. The laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, has multiple Y chromosome copies of Sry while most mammals have
only a single copy. DNA sequence comparisons with other rodents with multiple Sry copies are inconsistent in
divergence patterns and functionality of the multiple copies. To address hypotheses of divergence, gene
conversion and functional constraints, we sequenced Sry loci from a single R. norvegicus Y chromosome from the
Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat strain (SHR) and analyzed DNA sequences for homology among copies. Next,
to determine whether all copies of Sry are expressed, we developed a modification of the fluorescent marked
capillary electrophoresis method to generate three different sized amplification products to identify Sry copies.
We applied this fragment analysis method to both genomic DNA and cDNA prepared from mRNA from testis
and adrenal gland of adult male rats.
Results: Y chromosome fragments were amplified and sequenced using primers that included the entire Sry
coding region and flanking sequences. The analysis of these sequences identified six Sry loci on the Y chromosome.
These are paralogous copies consistent with a single phylogeny and the divergence between any two copies is less
than 2%. All copies have a conserved reading frame and amino acid sequence consistent with function. Fragment
analysis of genomic DNA showed close approximations of experimental with predicted values, validating the use
of this method to identify proportions of each copy. Using the fragment analysis procedure with cDNA samples
showed the Sry copies expressed were significantly different from the genomic distribution (testis p < 0.001,
adrenal gland p < 0.001), and the testis and adrenal copy distribution in the transcripts were also significantly
different from each other (p < 0.001). Total Sry transcript expression, analyzed by real-time PCR, showed
significantly higher levels of Sry in testis than adrenal gland (p, 0.001).
Conclusion: The SHR Y chromosome contains at least 6 full length copies of the Sry gene. These copies have a
conserved coding region and conserved amino acid sequence. The pattern of divergence is not consistent with
gene conversion as the mechanism for this conservation. Expression studies show multiple copies expressed in
the adult male testis and adrenal glands, with tissue specific differences in expression patterns. Both the DNA
sequence analysis and RNA transcript expression analysis are consistent with more than one copy having function
and selection preventing divergence although we have no functional evidence.

Background
The recent analysis of the DNA sequence of the human Y
chromosome has required a change from the classical
view of the mammalian Y chromosome as a passive,
genetic graveyard to one of an active, self correcting entity
[1,2]. In reality, the mammalian Y chromosome is a combination of both the classical and modern views, since different regions of the Y chromosome behave differently.
Genes in the male specific region of the Y chromosome
have been divided into three classes; X transposed, X
degenerate, and ampliconic [3]. The palindromic structure of the ampliconic regions allow gene conversion to
repair mutations in duplicate copies of the same locus
much the same way as recombination for an autosomal
chromosome [2], reducing divergence between copies.
The X transposed and X degenerate regions act in the classical view of a non-recombining chromosome, accumulating mutations while either degrading or being
maintained by function and selection.
One of the X degenerate loci on the mammalian Y chromosome is Sry. The Sry locus is conserved on mammalian
Y chromosomes and is the transcription factor responsible
for testis determination [4]. In comparisons of Sry amino
acid sequences between mouse, human and other mammals the High Mobility Group (HMG) box region,
responsible for DNA binding, is highly conserved while
other regions show little if any conservation [5,6]. In
humans, mutations in the HMG box result in sex reversal
(XY females), while most mutations outside this region
have normal sex-determination [7]. Sry may have functions other than testis determination, since Sry expression
has been demonstrated from multiple adult male tissues
and expression is conserved in human, mouse and rat [810]. Recent reports have demonstrated Sry activity in RNA
splicing [11], in transcriptional control of the tyrosine
hydroxylase promoter [12], blood pressure [13] and in
brain function [10]. None of these reported activities is
thought to be involved in testis determination.
While most mammals have only a single copy of Sry, multiple copies of the Sry locus on the Y chromosome have
been found in some rodent species [14]. Whether these
multiple copies are transcribed, translated and functional
is not known. Since the X degenerate loci do not recombine or have the high levels of gene conversion observed
for the ampliconic loci, mutations occurring in these Sry
paralogs should become fixed and accumulate over time
[15], leading to loss of function and decay. Thus the
expectation for species with multiple copies of Sry on the
Y chromosome would be for selection to maintain one
copy for testis determination and any other copies would
accumulate mutations and diverge or decay. The Sry HMG
box region has been sequenced in 9 species of the family
Microtidae (voles) and 8 of these species had multiple Y

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/11

chromosome copies of Sry. Consistent with a decay
hypothesis, some of the copies were obviously non-functional due to early, in frame stop codons or deletions
causing frame-shift mutations [16]. In a comparison of
partial Sry DNA sequences from six African murine species
with multiple copies of the Sry locus, the pattern of variation and conservation of reading frame was consistent
with these copies being functional [17]. The maintenance
of multiple conserved copies could be the result of either
functional constraints or recent duplication events creating copies that have not yet accumulated mutations and
diverged. In the murine data multiple Sry orthologs were
found in multiple species, thus these murine duplications
are not recent. With the recent human Y chromosome
data, another hypothesis for the conservation observed in
the murine Sry copies is that these Sry loci are now organized and evolving like the ampliconic region of the Y chromosome, and the conservation and maintenance of
reading frame are the result of gene conversion.
Previously, it was estimated from Southern blot densities
that the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, contained 4–5
copies of the Sry locus on the Y chromosome [14]. By
sequencing paralogous copies from single Y chromosomes, hypotheses of gene conversion and/or functional
constraints can be evaluated. Since the rat is an excellent
model for physiological and functional studies, a characterization of R. norvegicus Sry loci can subsequently be
used to evaluate both the expression and functional
aspects of multiple copies of the Sry locus. In the present
study we identify 6 full length Sry loci from a single R. norvegicus Y chromosome. The pattern of divergence and
linkage disequilibrium within each copy is not consistent
with gene conversion. Using differences between the copies we are able to determine which copies are expressed.
The expression pattern is tissue specific and not all copies
are expressed equally.

Results
Number of copies
Two primers were developed (3L and 02GR) from partial
rat sequences in GenBank and preliminary rat Sry
sequences from our lab. The amplification fragment
includes the entire Sry coding region (510 bp) plus 5' (245
bp) and 3' (194 bp) flanking sequences. These primers
amplify the correct size band from male genomic DNA
and do no not amplify from female genomic DNA (data
not shown). These primers were used to amplify genomic
DNA from a single SHR/Akr male and the resulting amplification products cloned then sequenced. The sequence
analysis of the 3L-02GR fragments identified 6 different
copies of Sry from a single SHR/y male; Sry1 (GenBank:AY157669), Sry2 (GenBank:AY157670), Sry3 (GenBank AY157672), Sry3B (GenBank:AY157996), Sry3B1
(GenBank:AY157997) and Sry3C (GenBank:AY157671).

The copy designations are based on insertion/deletion
and/or repeat number differences, in addition to single
unique base pair mutations (Table 1). The clones allowed
comparison of 946 bp in Sry1 and Sry3c, 907 bp in Sry2,
942 bp in Sry3 and 948 bp in Sry3B and Sry3BI. Table 1
shows the diagnostic regions for identifying the six Sry
copies.
Comparison of copies
Table 2 summarizes the sequence differences between the
copies; any insertion/deletion differences are counted as
single differences. All these comparisons vary from
between 907 to 948 bp depending on the copies being
compared. The four "Sry3-like" copies (Sry3, Sry3B,
Sry3B1, and Sry3C) differ from each other by only 2–7 differences (Table 2). These "Sry3-like" copies are more different from either Sry1 or Sry 2 (11–21 differences) than
from each other. Values below the diagonal in Table 2 are
the number of differences that occur in the 5' flanking
region (26% of bases), coding region (54% of bases) or 3'
flanking region (20% of bases). These differences are consistent with a single phylogeny of the relationship of the
copies (Figure 1). Of the 28 differences between the copies
only one is shared in a manner not consistent with the
phylogeny.

There are 28 differences (single nucleotide, insertion/deletion and repeat) identified between the copies and 18 of
these are unique to a single copy. In the Sry3 duplicated
copies, Sry3 and Sry3B have no unique differences consistent with having been duplicated (Sry3 twice and Sry3B
once) (Fig. 1), while the duplicated copies have accumulated unique mutations as they have diverged from the
original copy; Sry3B1 has 1 unique mutation and Sry3C
has 3 unique mutations. Most of the unique differences
are in Sry1 (6) and Sry2 (8) as they have diverged without
duplication thereby accumulating unique mutations.

seen and there are no peaks present in female samples
(data not shown). Figure 2 indicates the average area of
each of the three size peaks averaged from 5 different
SHR/y males and the expected proportion for each peak
assuming 6 copies of Sry. By comparing the areas of the
three peaks with the number of predicted copies in that
peak we see a close approximation to the expected values
(Figure 3). Any differences between the observed and
expected areas may be the result of inherent amplification
differences between the copies but also the possibility
there may be other as yet unidentified copies. For instance
an extra unidentified Sry1 copy would increase the
number of loci contributing to the 482 bp peak from three
to four and change the expectation from 0.50 (3/6) to
0.57 (4/7).
Transcript Analysis
Next, we used the fragment analysis procedure on cDNA
prepared from mRNA transcripts rather than genomic
DNA to estimate the proportion of the copies present in
an RNA sample. This does not quantify the absolute
amount of Sry RNA in the sample but it allows us to partition the total Sry mRNA into copies. Figure 3 shows the
proportion of each peak from testis and adrenal gland,
averaged from 5 males 15 weeks of age. The proportion of
the peaks from testis and adrenal cDNA are both significantly different from the genomic distribution for each Sry
type (444,482,485, testis p < .001, adrenal p < .001) and
the testis and adrenal peak levels are significantly different
from each other for each Sry type (444,482,485, p < .01–
.001).

Real-time RT-PCR for 15 week male rat testis and adrenal
are presented in Figure 4. Total Sry levels in the testis were
significantly higher (12.6X, p, 0.001) the levels in the
adrenal.

Discussion
The open reading frame encodes a 169 amino acid protein
in Sry1, Sry3 and Sry3C, a 170 amino acid protein in Sry3B
and Sry3B1, and a 156 amino acid protein in Sry2. Table 3
shows the predicted amino acid sequence for each of the
6 Sry copies and compares them to the amino acid
sequence of the HMG box region for both human and
mouse. Since conservation between species outside of the
HMG box is reduced, only the HMG region is included in
the M. musculus or human SRY comparisons in Table 3.
After amplification of genomic DNA using fluorescently
labeled primers (NED-P1mod and S1502GLrev), the 6
copies have three different length amplicons; 444 bp
(Sry2), 482 bp (Sry1, Sry3, Sry3C) and 485 (Sry3B and
Sry3BI). When genomic DNA from the original SHR/y
strain is used for amplification and the products separated
by capillary electrophoresis the three expected peaks are

The identification of six copies of the Sry locus on the rat
SHR/y Y chromosome is consistent with the prediction of
4–5 copies by Nagamine [14]. Nagamine used Southern
blot autoradiographs to estimate copy number, while we
have used DNA sequence differences to identify the copies. The close agreement between our results and Nagamine's, using different methods, would argue that there
are not additional unidentified copies or additional duplicate copies with identical sequence. Previous rat Sry
sequences in GenBank have only been identified as Sry
without regard to the existence of multiple copies. Using
the diagnostic regions identified for the 6 copies (Table 1),
we can determine the identity of each pre-existing rat Sry
sequence in GenBank; GenBank X89730Sry2, GenBank
Z26907Sry2, GenBank AJ222688Sry3C, GenBank
CR759961Sry3C. Because we used primers spanning the
coding region to amplify and clone these sequences, it is

and then copies diverge through the accumulation of
mutations. We can only identify the duplicate copies by
their divergent mutations. Figure 1 demonstrates a phylogeny consistent with the sequence data from the 6 copies. This phylogeny is based on the insertion/deletion/
repeat differences and single base pair differences between
the copies. For example, all of the Sry3 related copies
(Sry3, Sry3B, Sry3B1, and Sry3C) have one copy of the
GACC repeat at bp 550 while Sry1 and Sry2 have two copies (Table 1). The phylogeny requires 5 duplications from
a single ancestral copy. The divergences show Sry1, Sry2
and Sry3 to be the oldest copies. The Sry3-like loci are the
result of three duplications while Sry1 and Sry2 have not
been duplicated. This could indicate that the Sry3-like loci
are located in an ampliconic region of the Y chromosome
where duplications are more probable.

In a comparison of partial Sry DNA sequences in 6 murine
species with multiple copies of Sry (2–4 copies/species),
sequence divergence between paralogous copies in different species varied from 1% to 8% [17]. All copies had a
long open reading frame with a stop codon, similar to M.
musculus which has one copy of Sry. Lundrigan and Tucker
[17] interpreted this conservation of reading frame and
HMG box to indicate that these paralogous copies are
functional. While other comparisons of Sry have used
only partial Sry sequences, we have compared the entire
coding region along with regions from both 5' and 3'
flanking sequences. Our results are similar to the murine
results as the six copies differ by 0.2 to 2% and have a conserved reading frame, but this is within a single Y chromosome and not between Y chromosomes in different
species. The rat Y chromosome analysis is unique in finding 6 divergent copies on a single Y chromosome These
copies from the same Y chromosome differ from each
other by as much as some Sry loci in different species of
Mus (with a single copy of Sry) [5,6]. Thus, some of these
duplications cannot be of recent origin.

Is there evidence for gene conversion in the Sry copies?
Gene conversion would be identified by a reduction in
genetic divergence between copies but also by a decay of
linkage disequilibrium within the mutations on a single
copy. In these comparisons we are referring to the linkage
disequilibrium of the specific mutations within a single
copy rather than linkage disequilibrium between copies,
which would require information about the location of
each copy on the Y chromosome. Gene conversion would
decay linkage disequilibrium between differences in the
same copy and shared mutations between copies would
be based on gene conversion events rather than the phyl-

For six different copies to be present and identified, two
separate processes must have occurred on the rat Y chromosome. First an ancestral copy must have duplicated

ogeny. Because of the duplication history of the copies,
there are three comparisons that are instructive: between
the four Sry3-like copies, between Sry1 and Sry2, and
between Sry1/Sry2 and the Sry3-like copies. The four Sry3like copies have high genetic identity but the only difference shared between all the Sry3-like copies is the GACC
repeat number (Table 1), the other 8 differences between
these copies are unique to a single copy. There has been
no decay of linkage disequilibrium within these copies, so
although our precision to identify gene conversion is
small, there is no indication of gene conversion in the
Sry3-like copies. The accumulation of unique differences
in Sry1 and Sry2 would not be consistent with gene conversion. Between the Sry3-like copies and Sry1/Sry2 there
is only one difference shared between copies that is not
consistent with the phylogeny, a single base difference
shared between Sry1, Sry3C and Sry3B (bp -154). Other
differences near this base pair are not shared. Although we

cannot say gene conversion has not occurred, the patterns
are not consistent with gene conversion being a major
force in preventing genetic divergence between these copies.
One of the diagnostic regions between the copies (Table
1) is the different number of GCA trinucleotide repeats in
the Sry coding region (bp 474). These trinucleotide
repeats occur as a result of polymerase slippage and have
a high mutation rate (10-3) on the human Y chromosome
[18]. Are these repeat differences unique events in this lineage? If a repeat expansion/contraction to the same length
occurred more than once in the same lineage then flanking markers would not be in linkage disequilibrium with
repeat length and would show a pattern that could be
interpreted as gene conversion. The data are consistent
with the two repeat differences between copies being
unique events in this phylogeny (Table 1).

Predicted amino acid sequence for each of the 6 copies of Sry found on the SHR Y chromosome compared to the amino acid sequence of Sry1.
The HMG box (amino acids 5–73) is underlined and compared to Mus musculus and Human. Human (nm_003140.1) and mouse (nm_11564.1)
sequences are from REFSEQ. Only differences are noted, (---) indicate amino acids that are deleted in Sry2, and [] indicate amino acids added in
Sry3B and Sry3B1. Consensus rat sequence is in black and differences are bold.

Table 3 shows the predicted amino acid sequence for each
of the 6 rat Sry copies and compares the conserved HMG
box region for human and mouse. Of the predicted Sry
amino acid sequence differences among the copies seen in
the HMG box region of the protein (amino acids 5–73)
(Table 3), only one difference (amino acid 38) in Sry1
could potentially affect function. Sry1 has a histidine residue at amino acid position 38 while all other identified
rat Sry copies, as well as M. musculus Sry and human SRY,
have a glutamine residue (Table 3). Although this is a conserved amino acid change (both are polar), it could affect
DNA binding. All other HMG box region amino acid differences identified in the six rat Sry loci are also found in
either the human or mouse HMG amino acid sequence
and therefore we assume them to be consistent with DNA
binding and function.
None of the insertion/deletion differences between the
copies disrupts the carboxy terminal portion of the Sry
protein, as all are in frame. In comparisons of the DNA
sequence between the six rat copies, the Sry2 locus has the

most unique base pair differences (8), and although seven
of these occur in the coding region, only two result in
amino acid changes. One of the two amino acid differences found in Sry2 is consistent with the amino acid
found in Mus musculus and could be the ancestral condition rather than a diverged mutation.
There are no published data on expression for any Rattus
Sry copy in GenBank or expression database. An anomaly
of mammalian Sry expression is the absence of Sry
sequences in all EST expression databases, although EST
libraries from tissues such as the testis, where Sry expression has been demonstrated by northern and western
blots, have had significant number of clones sequenced.
The Sry transcript may have a secondary structure which
prevents or reduces its cloning potential from mRNA samples. GenBank X89730 is identified in GenBank as a
cDNA sequence, but the original publication [19] indicates that the "cDNA" designation was the authors designation for DNA amplified with a Taq polymerase from
genomic DNA, not from cDNA. All of our sequence prior

to the coding region is probably 5' UTR, given the identified transcriptional start sites in mouse and human Sry
[8,20]. The only copy with significant variation in the
sequenced 5' flanking region is Sry3C, which includes the
diagnostic insertion at bp -71. The relationship between
Sry3C and the other Sry3 copies is skewed toward differences in the 5' flanking region (Table 2) and could potentially alter the expression profile or stability of this copy.
Over 70% of the differences in Sry3C are in the 5' flanking
region, which represents only 25% of the total sequence
compared (249/982).
To examine expression of the Sry copies, we developed a
modification of the fluorescent marked capillary electrophoresis method normally used to genotype microsatellites or identify loss of heterozygosity in tumor samples.

differences in the coding region give three different sized

Sry3, and Sry3C), 485 bp (Sry3B and Sry3BI). The total
area of the three peaks and the proportion in each peak
can be used to estimate the relative proportion of each
grouping in a DNA or cDNA sample. Figure 2 shows the
average proportion of each peak from genomic DNA of 5
different SHR/y males. The expected values for each of the
peaks are determined from how many of the 6 copies are
present in that peak and only one copy of each is present.
The proportions in each peak are consistent between
males and close to the expected values. Slight differences
in amplification efficiency may account for the consistent
underestimate of the 485 peak. The primers used for the
fragment analysis were different from, and located in
regions different from, the primers used to amplify and
clone the Sry sequences used in the DNA sequences. The
close agreement between the fragment analysis and the
prediction of 6 copies from genomic DNA would argue

that the SHR Y chromosome may not contain other full
length Sry copies.
This fragment analysis procedure was then used to identify copies from cDNA samples prepared from RNA isolated from SHR/y adult male testis and adrenal glands
(Figure 3). Sry expression in adult testis has been identified in human and Mus adult males, both of which have
only a single copy of Sry [8,9]. We earlier demonstrated
that Sry increases the transcriptional activity of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter in vitro [12] and that Sry and
Th mRNA are both present in the rat adrenal medulla [12]
consistent with a functional relationship between Sry and
tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthesis). The expression results from the
cDNA samples are different from the genomic samples;
the 444 bp peak (Sry2) is the major transcript in the testis,
with less of the 482 bp peak (Sry1, Sry3, and Sry3C) and
485 bp peak (Sry3B, and Sry3BI) (Figure 3). The adrenal
transcript proportions are very different from the testis
proportions: they are almost completely 444 bp peak
(Sry2) (Figure 3). These data demonstrate that more than
one copy is expressed and that there are tissue specific
expression patterns. The fragment analysis provides the

proportion of each of the copy groups relative to the total
Sry expression; it does not show the total amount of Sry
expressed. Analysis of total Sry transcript levels by realtime RT-PCR (Figure 4) showed about 13 times more Sry
transcripts in the testes than in adrenal gland. It is unlikely
that the Sry genes are expressed at such levels (total Sry
transcripts in testis represent about 0.4% of the levels of
the invariant ribosomal S26 transcript) unless they are
playing a role in some physiological process. The difference in total Sry expression in testis compared to adrenal
gland, in combination with the differences seen in relative
proportions of individual transcripts after fragment analysis, is consistent with different Sry products impacting
more than one phenotype in adult male rats.
Although historically, the only function for Sry was testis
determination both the DNA sequence analysis and RNA
transcript expression analysis are consistent with more
than one copy being functional and selection preventing
divergence. We do not have evidence of additional functions from these results but there have been recent publications that extend the view of potential Sry interactions
[10-12]. It is evident from sex reversed individuals with
Sry mutations that any functions of Sry in addition to tes-

ing region and conserved amino acid sequence. The pattern of divergence is not consistent with gene conversion
as the mechanism for this conservation. Expression studies show multiple copies expressed in the adult male testis
and adrenal glands, with tissue specific differences in
expression patterns.

tis determination are not essential or do not have large
phenotypic consequences. Does this mean that the presence of Sry transcripts and protein have no effect in adult
male tissues? Electroporation of a Sry1 expression vector
into the rat adrenal gland increased blood pressure 21
days after the electroporation [13]. This result demonstrates that Sry expression in a tissue can have physiological or phenotypic consequences. Whether this result is a
byproduct of an inherent function or a modification
because Sry is a transcription factor that may affect other
pathways when it is present in a tissue cannot be determined at this point. Could any such small phenotypic
modifications be maintained by selection? As a single
autosomal locus a small phenotypic effect may not reach
a threshold high enough to be controlled by anything
other than stochastic processes. But with an entire Y chromosome inherited as a unit, a group of small, each alone,
inconsequential but together add enough to be selected.
The classic evolutionary studies with natural populations
and inversions in Drosophila pseudoobscura demonstrate
the potential selective consequences of grouping genes
together [21]. These results are consistent with selection,
and the evidence of Sry effects other than testis determination, opens the possibility that Sry can have phenotypic
effects in addition to testis determination. This hypothesis
can be evaluated in systems such as Rattus norvegicus and
then tested in other mammals.

Conclusion

Rat Strains
Male SHR/y:Akr (Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat Y chromosome congenic strain) rats from the University of
Akron breeding colonies. All animal protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Akron (IACUC:proposal # 0303A).
PCR reactions and cloning
The 3L (5' AATCCACAGGGGTTTTGGTT) and 02GR
(5'GGGAGCAGGCCCTTTATTAC) primers were used to
amplify genomic DNA from a single male (temperature
cycling: 94° 4 minutes; 30 cycles of 94° 1 minute, 60° 1
minute, 72° 1 minute; 72° 7 minutes). Amplification was
accomplished using TaqPlus® Long polymerase, a mix of
Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases, a mixture with proofreading capabililty (Stratagene, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting
PCR products were cloned into the pCR® 4-TOPO® (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) vector using the TOPO® TA
Cloning and Transformation kit (Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's specifications.
Two independent PCR amplifications were performed
and each amplification was independently cloned and
transformed, and then 40 clones from each amplification
library were sequenced.
DNA sequencing and sequence analysis
An ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) and BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing chemistry were used to sequence all DNA samples.
Sequencing reactions were prepared as listed in Applied
Biosystem's Chemistry Guide for BigDye Terminators.
Sequences were aligned and analyzed with Sequencher
sequence analysis software (Gene Codes Corp. Inc., Ann
Arbor, MI).
RNA Isolation and transcript analysis
Total cellular RNA was isolated with RNA STAT-60 (TELTEST), treated with DNase to remove any contaminating
genomic DNA, and used as template with avian reverse
transcriptase (enhanced avian HS RT, Sigma) and a mix of
random nonamer primers to generate cDNAs. RNase
inhibitor (SUPERase•In, Ambion) was included to insure
RNA integrity. A no-RT control was included for each sample.

The SHR Y chromosome contains at least 6 full length
copies of the Sry gene. These copies have a conserved cod-

cDNA First Strand Synthesis and RT-PCR
500 ng of DNased RNA was used as template for M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (ArrayScript, Ambion) and primed
using the Sry specific oligonucleotide RTallS-A (5'GGACAGTAAGTAGGTTAGCT-3').
Rnase
inhibitor
(SUPERase*IN, Ambion) was added to prevent RNA degradation during cDNA synthesis. Dnased RNA, water, and
primer were initially heated to 70°C for 10 minutes for
denaturation of transcript secondary structure. The addition of 10 mM dNTP, Rnase inhibitor, RT enzyme and
buffer was followed by incubation at 25°C for 15 minutes
and 44°C for 1 hour. The RT enzyme was heat inactivated
at 95°C for 5 minutes and immediately placed on ice. For
every sample that was reverse transcribed, a control no-RT
tube was prepared. RT-PCR was carried out immediately
following generation of first strand cDNA. The primer set
RTallS-B (5'-AGTAGGTTAGCTGCTGCTAG-3') and 5'S2L
(5'-CCATCTCTGACTTCCTGGTTG-3') was used to
amplify all Sry copies from the cDNA template. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 25
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 59°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min,
followed by 72°C for 10 min. In addition to the no-RT
control, a no template negative control and genomic positive control were included.
Real-time RT-PCR
For real-time RT-PCR, primers for Sry and S26 (an invariant transcript encoding ribosomal protein 26 in the small
ribosomal subunit of rat) were selected using Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems). Primers (300 μM
each), 50–100 ng of cDNA and SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) were combined and run under
standard conditions in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence
Detection. In all assays no-RT samples and no-template
PCR controls were included. After primer efficiency was
determined, for each sample the threshold cycle (CT) was
determined. CT values for the S26 normalizer were subtracted from CT values for experimental samples to obtain
ΔCT values. Transcript levels in the adrenal gland were
expressed as fold difference relative to testis values (2ΔΔCT). Male-specific real-time PCR primers for Sry (SryL,
5'-TGG GAT TCT GTT GAG CCA ACT-3' and SryR, 5'-GCG
CCC CAT GAA TGC AT-3') detect all Sry transcripts.
Generation of Fluorescent Labeled Fragments
Products of the RT-PCR reaction were used as template in
subsequent PCR reactions each with a primer set containing one 5'fluorescent labeled and one unlabeled oligonucleotide. The primer set NED-P1mod (5'-NEDGAATGCATTTATGGTGTGGTCCCG-3') and S1502Glrev
(5'-TAGTGGAAC TGGTGCTGCTG-3') was used to produce amplicons of three different lengths. Thermocycler
conditions were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 30 cycles of
94°C for 1 min, 61°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, followed
by 72°C final extension for 20 min. The fluorescent dye

NED was incorporated at the 5' end of each amplicon and
the size of the products were 444 bp, 482 bp, and 485 bp
corresponding to Sry2, Sry1/3/3C, and Sry3B/3B1 respectively.
Because the Sry copies all contain a trinucleotide repeat
region there is also a stutter band 3 bp smaller than the
predicted sizes. Because the stutter for the 485 peak would
run with the 482 peak overestimating the 482 area, we
have made a simple correction using the area of the 479
peak (stutter from 482). The ratio of the 479 to 482 areas
is multiplied by the 485 area and this result is subtracted
from the 482 area (Corrected Area482 = Area482({Area479/Area482} × Area485)).
Preparation of Samples for Fragment Analysis
Fluorescent labeled PCR products were diluted in water
1:10. Each well of the final analysis plate contained 1 μl of
diluted PCR product, 0.4 μl of sizing standard (GeneScan
600LIZ, Applied Biosystems), and 8.6 μl of formamide
(Hi-Di Formamide, Applied Biosystems). The no-RT, no
template control, and genomic samples were included as
controls. Samples were processed using the ABI 3130 × 1
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and fragments
were analyzed using GeneMapper v4.0 software (Applied
Biosystems).
