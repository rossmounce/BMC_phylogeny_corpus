Abstract
Background: Gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for functional
genomics. Although RNAi was first described in Caenorhabditis elegans, several nematode species
are unable to mount an RNAi response when exposed to exogenous double stranded RNA
(dsRNA). These include the satellite model organisms Pristionchus pacificus and Oscheius tipulae.
Available data also suggest that the RNAi pathway targeting exogenous dsRNA may not be fully
functional in some animal parasitic nematodes. The genus Panagrolaimus contains bacterial feeding
nematodes which occupy a diversity of niches ranging from polar, temperate and semi-arid soils to
terrestrial mosses. Thus many Panagrolaimus species are adapted to tolerate freezing and
desiccation and are excellent systems to study the molecular basis of environmental stress
tolerance. We investigated whether Panagrolaimus is susceptible to RNAi to determine whether
this nematode could be used in large scale RNAi studies in functional genomics.
Results: We studied two species: Panagrolaimus sp. PS1159 and Panagrolaimus superbus. Both
nematode species displayed embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes following ingestion of Escherichia
coli expressing dsRNA for the C. elegans embryonic lethal genes Ce-lmn-1 and Ce-ran-4. Embryonic
lethal RNAi phenotypes were also obtained in both species upon ingestion of dsRNA for the
Panagrolaimus genes ef1b and rps-2. Single nematode RT-PCR showed that a significant reduction in
mRNA transcript levels occurred for the target ef1b and rps-2 genes in RNAi treated Panagrolaimus
sp. 1159 nematodes. Visible RNAi phenotypes were also observed when P. superbus was exposed
to dsRNA for structural genes encoding contractile proteins. All RNAi phenotypes were highly
penetrant, particularly in P. superbus.
Conclusion: This demonstration that Panagrolaimus is amenable to RNAi by feeding will allow the
development of high throughput methods of RNAi screening for P. superbus. This greatly enhances
the utility of this nematode as a model system for the study of the molecular biology of
anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis and as a possible satellite model nematode for comparative and
functional genomics. Our data also identify another nematode infraorder which is amenable to
RNAi and provide additional information on the diversity of RNAi phenotypes in nematodes.

Background
RNA interference (RNAi) was first described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [1,2], when it was found that
the injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into a hermaphrodite worm resulted in the degradation of endogenous mRNA corresponding in sequence to the injected
dsRNA. This resulted in a loss of function phenotype for
the target gene. Potent RNAi effects can also be achieved
in C. elegans by soaking the nematodes in a dsRNA solution [3] or by feeding the nematodes on bacteria engineered to express dsRNA of the target gene [4]. The
potential for RNAi by feeding to be used in a large scale
manner for functional genomics was demonstrated by the
construction of a feeding library corresponding to 86% of
the 19,000 predicted genes in C. elegans [5]. This library
has already been screened for genes involved in a wide
range of biological processes including development
[6,7], ageing [8-10], cell biology [11,12] and neurobiology [13].
RNAi effects have now been detected in all eukaryote
groups; phylogenetic analyses suggest that the main components of the RNAi machinery can be traced back to the
last common ancestor of the eukaryotes [14]. Gene silencing by RNAi is the outcome of a complex co-ordinated
process. Many of the essential proteins involved in this
process have been identified. RNAi is initiated by the
cleavage of exogenous dsRNA into short interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) by a dsRNA-specific RNAse enzyme Dicer [15].
These double-stranded ~21 nucleotide siRNAs interact
with, and activate, a multiprotein RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC) and the activated RISC then recognises
and cleaves RNA molecules homologous to the interfering
siRNA [16,17]. Gene silencing via RNAi can also be triggered by endogenous double stranded micro RNAs (miRNAs) which regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in metazoans [18] and plants [19].
RNAi-related mechanisms are also involved in heterochromatin formation [20,21].
Although the core features of the RNAi response are conserved among eukaryotes, several taxon-specific variations
occur. Taxa differ in their ability to take up dsRNA, to
transmit siRNA systemically to other tissues and in the
magnitude and duration of the RNAi response. While various cell types can efficiently take up dsRNA in Drosophila
melanogaster [22], the response is cell autonomous and
the flies are unable to produce a systemic response to the
localized introduction of dsRNA [23]. Naturally occurring
systemic transmission of siRNAs also appears to be absent
from vertebrates. Other organisms including C. elegans
[1], the insect parasitic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora [24], the planarian worm Schmidtea mediterranea
[25], the coelenterate Hydra [26], insect species including
a grasshopper [27] and cockroach [28] and several plant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/58

species [29-32] have the ability to generate a systemic
RNAi response. In C. elegans two genes sid-1 and sid-2 are
required for the uptake of dsRNA from the intestine (sid =
systemic RNAi-deficient) [33,34]. SID-1 is a multispan
transmembrane protein which appears to function as a
channel for the diffusion of dsRNA [33,35], and expression of nematode SID-1 in Drosophila cells which lack a
sid-1 homolog resulted in the rapid import of dsRNA into
the cells [35]. Although sid-2 mutants fail to show a systemic RNAi response to ingested dsDNA, the injection of
dsRNA into the pseudocoel of these mutants generated a
strong systemic RNAi response in the treated worms [34].
SID-2 encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein
which is expressed in the membranes of the intestine
lumen and although its mode of action has yet to be determined, SID-2 is an essential requirement for environmental RNAi in C. elegans [34].
Because of the complexity of the dsRNAi pathway, the loss
of a specific RNAi component protein or the occurrence of
mutations may lead to the lack of a systemic RNAi
response. Exogenous dsRNAi function has been lost from
specific lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae [14] and
Trypanosoma cruzi [36]. Lack of both a systemic and a cellautonomous RNAi response to injected dsRNA was also
observed in the free living nematodes Oscheius tipulae
[37,38] and Pristionchus pacificus [39,40]. Testing of strains
within the Caenorhabditis clade for susceptibility to RNAi
by different delivery methods indicated that most strains
are capable of a systemic RNAi response if dsRNA is delivered via microinjection, however six of the eight
Caenorhabditis species tested, including C. briggsae, were
resistant to dsRNAi via soaking or feeding [34,41]. When
SID-2 from C. elegans was expressed in C. briggsae it conferred sensitivity to RNAi by soaking [34]. A naturally
occurring strain of C. elegans from Hawaii was found to be
resistant to RNAi by feeding or injection of germlineexpressed genes and this defect was the result of mutations in the Argonaute gene ppw-1 [42]. The minimum
defining feature of a RISC complex is that it contains one
Argonaute family member and a small-RNA guide strand
[43]. The Argonaute gene family contains 20 members in
C. elegans [44], which suggests that several distinct RISC
complexes may be formed in this organism. Resistance or
partial resistance to RNAi has also been demonstrated in
animal parasitic nematode species such as Haemonchus
contortus [45] and Ostertagia ostertagi [46]. This resistance
to RNAi may be due to difficulties in developing suitable
in vitro culture conditions and delivery methods for these
parasites, but the available data suggest that the RNAi
pathway may not be fully functional in some animal parasitic nematodes [47]. By contrast, several plant parasitic
nematode species are susceptible to RNAi, including the
nematodes Heterodera glycines and Globodera pallida [48]
and Meloidogyne incognita [49]. Viney and Thompson [50]

propose that the limited success of RNAi in animal parasitic nematodes to date might be circumvented if, instead
of the soaking protocols currently in use, the dsRNA were
delivered to the worms' pseudocoel. Alternatively it may
be necessary to genetically engineer animal parasitic nematodes to express the sid-1 and sid-2 genes from C. elegans
[50].
Native Drosophila S2 cells lack a SID-1 homolog, however
these cells become competent to take up dsRNA when
exposed to brief serum starvation in the presence of
dsRNA, followed by incubation in medium containing
serum [22,51]. Systemic RNAi effects in C. elegans body
wall muscles are also enhanced by starvation [33]. Observations in C. elegans and Drosophila suggest that environmental or physiological signals may be important in the
uptake and spread of dsRNA. Using an RNAi approach
Saleh et al. [52] have shown that dsRNA is taken up in
serum starved Drosophila S2 cells by receptor mediated
endocytosis and these authors demonstrated that a functional intracellular vesicle transport system is also
required for systemic RNAi in C. elegans. It has been
hypothesized that an RNAi response to exogenous dsRNA
evolved as a defence against infectious transposons and
viruses [53,54]. Many viruses encode viral suppressors of
RNA silencing (VSRs) to counteract the hosts' defence
against viral encoded dsRNAs [55]. VSRs target several of
the key steps in the RNA silencing pathway and VSRs
encoded by viruses of different families often share no
homology at the primary amino acid sequence level [55].
Pharmacological evidence suggests that in serum starved
Drosophila S2 cells dsRNA uptake is mediated by pattern
recognition receptors of the scavenger-receptor family
[52], a family of receptors with roles in the innate
immune response [56]. The ability to mount a systemic
RNAi response to ingested dsRNA is absent in many
Caenorhabditis species and it is also poorly developed in
animal parasitic nematodes, and both systemic and cell
autonomous RNAi are absent in the nematodes P. pacificus and O. tipulae. In contrast C. elegans, H. bacteriophora
and several species of plant parasitic nematodes are susceptible to RNAi from environmentally supplied dsRNA.
This phenotypic variability among nematodes may result
from differing niche-specific selective pressures affecting
environmental RNAi and the innate immune response.
We have previously shown that the free living bacterial
feeding nematode Panagrolaimus superbus is a suitable
model for studies on the molecular basis of anhydrobiosis
because of its remarkable ability to survive extreme desiccation [57]. As a bacterial feeder, Panagrolaimus can be
readily cultured in the laboratory with E. coli as a food
source, using methods developed for C. elegans [58]. We
therefore investigated whether Panagrolaimus is susceptible to RNAi by feeding. Our results show that potent and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/58

specific RNAi effects can be achieved in Panagrolaimus by
feeding it on E. coli expressing dsRNA for genes with
essential conserved functions. This demonstration that
Panagrolaimus is amenable to RNAi by feeding will allow
the development of high throughput methods of RNAi
screening for P. superbus and further enhance the utility of
this nematode as a model system for the study of the
molecular biology of anhydrobiosis, and as a possible satellite model nematode for comparative and functional
genomics.

Results and Discussion
Panagrolaimus fed with E. coli expressing dsRNA for C.
elegans embryonic lethal genes give rise to progeny with
highly penetrant embryonic lethal phenotypes
We tested two species of Panagrolaimus for RNAi effects
using E. coli clones from a C. elegans feeding library [59].
The selected clones contained inserts from the genes Celmn-1 (DY3.2) and Ce-ran-4 (R05D11.3). The functions of
these genes are conserved among eukaryotes and they
yield severe embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans [59]. The C. elegans genome contains a single lamin
gene, lmn-1 which encodes a nuclear lamin protein [60].
Previous RNAi studies have shown that C. elegans lmn-1
(RNAi) embryos have defects in chromatin organization,
cell cycle progression and chromosome segregation [60]
and that embryogenesis is halted before the embryo is
enclosed by epidermal tissue [6]. The Ce-lmn-1 (RNAi)
Panagrolaimus embryos show similar defects to those
described for C. elegans and the terminal arrest phenotype
is similar in both nematode genera (Figure 1A, 1D, 1G).
Ce-ran-4 encodes an ortholog of nuclear transport factor 2
[61] which is responsible for importing the Ras-related
nuclear protein RanGDP into the nucleus [62]. Ran is an
essential component in the transport of many proteins
and nucleic acids between the nucleus and the cytoplasm
[63]. RNAi of ran-4 in C. elegans resulted in an embryonic
lethal phenotype in which the embryos arrested as a multicellular mass (<200 cells) and the nuclear membranes
were indistinct [6,61]. The terminal arrest phenotypes of
Ce-ran-4 (RNAi) embryos in Panagrolaimus were also similar to those of C. elegans (Figure 1B, 1E, 1H). Although
embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes were observed for
both species of Panagrolaimus, the RNAi effect showed
greater penetrance in P. superbus than in Panagrolaimus sp.
1159 (Figure 2). From Figure 2 it can also be seen that the
penetrance of the heterologous RNAi effect observed in P.
superbus for both dsRNA constructs was comparable to
penetrance of the RNAi phenotypes observed in C. elegans
which had been treated with homologous dsRNA constructs. All three species tested (C. elegans, Panagrolaimus
sp. PS1159 and P. superbus) showed significant differences
in the percentage dead embryos between the experimental
and control populations for both target genes tested (Two
sample T-Test, P = 0.00).

Embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes obtained by feeding

Panagrolaimus genes
E. coli feeding strains were constructed using sequences for
two genes from Panagrolaimus sp. PS1159 whose
orthologs have embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes in C.
elegans. These were the elongation factor 1-beta (ef1b) gene
and the ribosomal protein small subunit S2 (rps-2) gene.
The Ce-rps-2 gene demonstrated both a sterile maternal
RNAi phenotype [64] and an embryonic lethal RNAi phenotype in C. elegans [65]. The Panagrolaimus rps-2 gene
also yielded an embryonic lethal RNAi phenotype in both
Panagrolaimus species tested (Figure 3A), with a significant
difference in percentage dead embryos between the experimental and control populations in both cases (Two sample T-Test, P = 0.00). Here also the heterologous RNAi
effect in P. superbus (80% embryonic lethality) was

number of eggs laid per female nematode was compared

any significant difference in fecundity between the populations. The dsRNAi embryonic lethal phenotype for the

indicates that the dsRNAi effect in Panagrolaimus is specific for the targeted genes.

however there was a significant difference in the percentage of dead embryos between the experimental and control populations in both nematode species (Two sample
T-Test, P = 0.00).
Exposure of Panagrolaimus sp. PS1159 to homologous
dsRNA by feeding results in a reduction of mRNA
transcript levels for the target genes
Single nematode RT-PCR (Figure 4) showed that a reduction in mRNA transcript levels occurred for the target
genes in the RNAi treated Panagrolaimus sp. PS1159 nematodes. For the ef1b gene the reduction in transcript level
was 30% that of the controls while for the rps-2 gene the
mRNA transcript levels were reduced to 55% of the controls (Figure 4C, D). There was no significant difference

Exposing Panagrolaimus superbus to homologous dsRNA
for genes encoding contractile proteins results in potent
and highly penetrant locomotor and growth defects
E. coli feeding strains were constructed for two genes from
Panagrolaimus suprbus whose C. elegans orthologs encode
contractile proteins. These genes were Psu-ifb-1 and Psuact-2. Each of these genes has multiple RNAi phenotypes
in C. elegans. The Ce-ifb-1 gene encodes two isoforms of a
cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein that are
expressed in the hypodermal cells of C. elegans, where they
form attachment structures which connect the muscles to
the cuticle [66]. These attachment structures transmit the
contractile forces generated by the body muscles across
the hypodermis to the cuticle. In C. elegans both IFB-1 isoforms have roles in epidermal morphogenesis and muscle
attachment [67]. C. elegans larvae exposed to ifb-1 RNAi
by feeding displayed a paralysis phenotype in which the
hypodermis becomes detached from the cuticle [68].
Exposure of P. superbus L1 larvae to Psu-ifb-1 dsRNA by
feeding resulted in a larval arrest and paralysis phenotype
(Figure 5A). The phenotype was highly penetrant and the
treated larvae were severely paralysed. Microscopic observations revealed waves or ripples of muscle contraction
moving from the anterior to the posterior of the immobile
worms, indicating that the contractile forces generated by
the muscles were not being transmitted to the cuticle.

The C. elegans genome encodes five highly conserved actin
genes. ACT-1, -2, -3 and -4 all share 99% amino acid identity, while ACT-5, the most divergent, shares 93% identity
with the other actin isoforms [69]. The act-1, -2, -3 and -4
genes function primarily in muscle and myofilament containing cells in C. elegans [69,70], while act-5 expression is
restricted to cells which contain microvilli [71]. A variety
of mutant and RNAi phenotypes have been associated
with impared actin gene function in C. elegans, including
defects in embryonic cell division [72], defects in muscle
contractile function [73] including pharyngeal function
[74], and growth defects [71]. P. superbus larvae grown on
E. coli expressing Psu-act-2 dsRNA displayed severe larval
lethal, larval arrest, and paralysed phenotypes (Figure 5B).
The treated larvae were unable to grow beyond the first or
second larval stages. The worms were immobile, although
pharyngeal function appeared to be retained.

quently it is not always possible to extrapolate from the
model nematode C. elegans to other members of the Phylum Nematoda; studies in additional representative nematode species are often necessary. Several additional
species of plant and animal parasitic nematodes have
been selected as model organisms. Comparative studies
are also carried out on other species in the Caenorhabditis
clade [76,77] and on the free-living bacterial feeding nematodes Oeschius tipulae [38,78] and Pristionchus pacificus
[40,79]. Neither O. tipulae nor P. pacificus (both members
of the suborder Rhabditina) display gene silencing in
response to exogenous dsRNA. However injection of antisense morpholino DNA oligonucleotides into both of
these satellite models results in a partial inactivation of

the corresponding gene product [37] or in phenotypes
with low penetrance [39]. Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides block mRNA translation when complementary
to the 5' untranslated region of the target gene or to the
first 25 bases downstream of the start codon, and they
achieve their effect by preventing ribosomal binding [80].
The use of morpholinos presents difficulties for highthroughput gene knockout experiments because of the
need for specific sequence information at the 5' end of the
gene, the requirement for a means of delivery of the oligonucleotides to the target cells, and the lack of a systemic
response.

We have previously shown that Panagrolaimus is a suitable
model for studies on the molecular basis of anhydrobiosis
[57]. Panagrolaimid nematodes occupy a diversity of
niches ranging from polar, temperate and semi-arid soils
to terrestrial mosses. Thus many Panagrolaimus species are
adapted to tolerate freezing and desiccation [81-83]. Our
current data show that when fed on E. coli expressing
dsRNA targeting Panagrolaimus genes the nematode
mounts a potent and specific systemic RNAi response.
This makes Panagrolaimus an ideal system with which to
carry out high-throughput RNAi screens for studies on the
molecular basis of anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis. Panagrolaimus is a member of the suborder Tylenchina of the
Order Rhabditida and thus it is more distantly related to
C. elegans than Oeschius or Pristionchus (Figure 6). The
Suborder Tylenchina contains three major lineages [84]:
the Panagrolaimorpha which includes the free living bacterial feeding panagrolaimids as well as the zooparasitic
strongyloids and steinernematids; the Cephalobomorpha, bacterial feeding nematodes that, like the panagrolaimaids, have a widespread distribution and are capable of
surviving in extremely dry and cold environments and the
Tylenchomorpha, a group of plant parasites and fungal
feeders which frequently has anhydrobiotic encysted
infective stages (e.g. Globodera, Meliodogyne), as well as
species which can enter anhydrobiosis throughout most
or all of their life cycle (e.g. Aphelencus avenae). Within the
genus Panagrolaimus several changes in reproductive
mode have occurred. Examples of gonochoristic (male
female), hermaphroditic (self-fertilization), and parthenogenetic (development of unfertilized eggs) reproduction have been reported [85]. Thus Panagrolaimus is an
excellent model system to study the evolutionary origins
and developmental consequences of parthenogenetic
reproduction. Being closely related to the zooparasitic
strongyloids and steinernematids and the plant parasitic

tylenchid nematodes, Panagrolaimus could also be used in
comparative genomic approaches to study the evolution
of parasitic lifestyles.

Conclusion
Our results show that potent and specific RNAi effects can
be achieved in two species of Panagrolaimus by feeding
them on E. coli expressing dsRNA for genes with essential
conserved functions. RNAi was first described in the nematode C. elegans, however some nematode species are
refractory to RNAi, including O. tipulae [37,38], P. pacificus [39], several species of Caenorhabdtis [34,41] and some
animal parasitic nematodes such as H. contortus [45] and
O. ostertagi [46]. In contrast many species of plant parasitic nematodes have potent RNAi responses to exogenous
RNAi [48,49]. Here we show that two species of Panagrolaimus are amenable to RNAi by feeding. Panagrolaimus is
a soil dwelling bacterial feeding nematode, as are C. elegans, P. pacificus and O. tipulae, but as a member of the
suborder Tylenchina Pangarolaimus is more distantly
related to C. elegans than Oeschius or Pristionchus. Thus our
data identify another nematode infraorder which is amenable to RNAi and provide additional information on the
diversity of RNAi phenotypes in nematodes.
Panagrolaimaid nematodes occupy a diversity of niches
ranging from polar, temperate and semi-arid soils to terrestrial mosses. Thus many Panagrolaimus species are
adapted to tolerate freezing and desiccation [57,81-83].
Within the genus Panagrolaimus several changes in reproductive mode have occurred. Thus Panagrolaimus is an
excellent model system to study the evolutionary origins
and developmental consequences of parthenogenetic
reproduction. Our demonstration that Panagrolaimus is
amenable to RNAi by feeding will allow the development
of high throughput methods of RNAi screening for P.

History, Stockholm. The nematodes were cultured on
NGM agar plates [57].
E. coli feeding clones
Two E. coli RNAi feeding clones from the C. elegans chromosome I feeding library [59] were kindly provided by
Dr. Julie Ahringer, Department of Genetics, University of
Cambridge. These clones contained inserts from the
embryonic lethal genes Ce-ran-4 (R05D11.3) and Ce-lmn1 (DY3.2). Bacterial feeding strains were constructed for
the Panagrolaimus genes using the L4440 plasmid vector
[4] and Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) cells as described by
Kamath and Ahringer [5]. The Panagrolaimus genes were
selected from a panel of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
which we have generated for P. superbus and Panagrolaimus
sp. PS1159 (Tyson et al. unpublished). The target genes
were selected based on their gene identity as determined
by BLAST analysis [86] and the RNAi phenotypes of their
orthologs in C. elegans, as listed in WormBase [87]. The
accession numbers of the Panagrolaimus ESTs and their
cDNA fragment sizes are as follows: ef1b, EU368942 (625
bp); rps-2, EU368941 (649 bp); ifb-1, EU368943 (360 bp)
and act-2, EU368944 (391 bp). Gene fragments of the ef1b
and rps-2 genes for insertion into the L4440 plasmid were
prepared by PCR using the gene specific primer pairs EF1
Forward/EF1 Reverse and RPS Forward/RPS Reverse (The
sequences of these PCR primers are listed in Additional
File 1). Gene fragments corresponding to the entire EST
sequences of the ifb-1 and act-2 genes were prepared from
the plasmid name using M13 F and R primers and cloned
into the L4440 vector. A separate control experiment (data
not presented) showed that an RNAi feeding clone containing dsRNA for the multiple cloning site of the pDNRLIB plasmid had no observable phenotype when fed to P.
superbus or Panagrolaimus sp. PS1159.
RNAi feeding protocol
NGM agar plates (9 cm) containing 1 mM iso-propyl-Î²-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 50 ug/ml ampicillin
(Amp) and 12.5 ug/ml tetracycline (Tet) were prepared.
The plates were allowed to dry inverted for ~4 days at
room temperature. They were then were spread with cells
from an overnight E. coli culture (strain HTT1(DE3)) containing the empty L4440 plasmid (control) or with E. coli
HTT1(DE3) transformed with an L4440 plasmid containing the target gene fragment inserted into the multiple
cloning site, and flanked on both sides by an IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter [4]. The plates were
grown at 20Â°C overnight to allow a lawn of E. coli to form
and to begin induction and expression of dsRNA. Axenised eggs were prepared from gravid female nematodes by
bleaching them with hypochlorite [88]. The axenised eggs
were rinsed three times in S Basal buffer [58], then aliquotted onto NGM agar feeding plates. The plates were
incubated at 20Â°C and monitored daily for the presence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/58

of visible RNAi phenotypes in the treated nematodes. To
analyse embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes young L4
stage worms were rinsed from the treatment and control
plates using sterile S Basal buffer and approximately 5
worms were transferred to each of 5â8 replicate 3 cm
NGM/IPTG/Amp/Tet agar plates containing a lawn of
either control E. coli or E. coli expressing dsRNA for the target gene. These worms were allowed to grow to adulthood
and lay eggs for 24 hours and they were then transferred
to a second set of replicate plates. The worms were again
allowed to lay eggs for 24 hours before being transferred
to a third set of plates. The worms were allowed to lay eggs
on the third set of plates until laying ceased and the adult
worms were then removed from the plates. The number of
dead embryos on each of the three sets of plates was determined by microscopic observation over a number of days
for both the control and experimental treatments. Standard deviation and standard errors were calculated using
the individual counts of surviving nematodes and not on
proportional data, but in the histograms survival data are
presented as percentage survival.
To observe possible embryonic lethal RNAi phenotypes
synchronous eggs from control and RNAi treated cultures
were rinsed from the agar surface using S Basal buffer and
centrifuged at 3,000 g for five minutes. The concentrated
eggs were transferred to a glass slide and gently covered
with a glass cover slip. Embryos were observed using an
Olympus EX51 microscope fitted with a U-CMAD3 imaging system and an Olympus U-RFL-T camera.
RT-PCR analysis of gene expression levels
Individual adult female nematodes whose progeny displayed an embryonic lethal RNAi phenotype were used
for RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from single nematodes
using the Absolutely RNA Microprep Kit (Stratagene),
which also included a DNAse treatment prior to the
reverse transcription step to remove any genomic DNA
(gDNA) contamination. As a control, PCR was attempted
on each sample after DNAse treatment and prior to RTPCR to ensure all gDNA had been removed. PCR samples
were then analysed by spectrophotometry and agarose gel
electrophoresis and samples showing no gDNA amplification were chosen for RT-PCR experiments. Each worm
RNA preparation yielded 30 Î¼l of extracted RNA. Six Î¼l of
the extracted RNA solution was used for each RT-PCR
reaction. RT-PCR was carried out using the QuanTitect
SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The upstream test forward primers used for RT-PCR analysis targeted a region
not included in the dsRNA feeding construct. The primers
used were the EF1-F-TEST and the EF1 reverse primers for
the ef1b gene and the RPS-F-TEST and the RPS reverse
primers for the rps-2 gene. The sequences of all PCR primers are listed in Additional File 1. RT-PCR was also carried
using the D3 expansion region of the ribosomal RNA gene

as an internal control gene for each single worm RNA
preparation. Amplification of the rRNA D3 domain was
carried out as described previously [57]. The RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 94Â°C for 5 min at the start of the
reaction was followed by 30 minutes at 50Â°C to allow
reverse transcription of the RNA. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94Â°C, 1 min; 55Â°C, 1.5 min; 72Â°C,
2 min. To obtain PCR product during the linear phase of
the PCR reaction a 10 Î¼l aliquot from the PCR reaction
mixture was sampled at 20, 25, 30 and 35 cycles for each
gene used. The products of the RT-PCR reactions were visualised on 1% agarose gels with 10 Î¼l of each RT-PCR
product loaded per gel. Image analysis of the RT-PCR gels
was carried out and band intensities were measured in
machine units using the ImageQuantâ¢ TL software package from GE Healthcare.
Phylogenetic analyses
Nucleotide sequences for the 18S small subunit rRNA
nuclear gene of 34 taxa were downloaded from the NCBI
database [89]. The accession numbers for these sequences
are given in Additional File 2. The sequences were aligned
using the ClustalW algorithm as implemented in the
MEGA software package (version 3.1) [90]. The alignment
was manually edited by removing poorly aligned blocks at
the 5' and 3' ends and ambiguously aligned internal segments. The final alignment contained 1,275 aligned characters. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
Neighbor-Joining method [91] and Minimum Evolution
method [92] as implemented by MEGA version 3.1. The
tree topologies recovered trees by both methods were very
similar, differing only in the placement of the Oscheius
clade (see Figure 6 and Additional File 3).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were carried out using Minitabâ¢
version 14.1 (Minitab Inc., State College, Pennsylvania,
USA). The 2-tailed T-Test was used to test for difference
between populations. The null hypothesis that population means are all equal was tested at the P = 0.05 level of
significance. T-Tests were carried out using the individual
counts of surviving nematodes and not on proportional
data.
