Abstract
Background: The arrangement of regulatory motifs in gene promoters, or promoter
architecture, is the result of mutation and selection processes that have operated over many
millions of years. In mammals, tissue-specific transcriptional regulation is related to the presence of
specific protein-interacting DNA motifs in gene promoters. However, little is known about the
relative location and spacing of these motifs. To fill this gap, we have performed a systematic search
for motifs that show significant bias at specific promoter locations in a large collection of
housekeeping and tissue-specific genes.
Results: We observe that promoters driving housekeeping gene expression are enriched in
particular motifs with strong positional bias, such as YY1, which are of little relevance in promoters
driving tissue-specific expression. We also identify a large number of motifs that show positional
bias in genes expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner. They include well-known tissue-specific
motifs, such as HNF1 and HNF4 motifs in liver, kidney and small intestine, or RFX motifs in testis,
as well as many potentially novel regulatory motifs. Based on this analysis, we provide predictions
for 559 tissue-specific motifs in mouse gene promoters.
Conclusion: The study shows that motif positional bias is an important feature of mammalian
proximal promoters and that it affects both general and tissue-specific motifs. Motif positional
constraints define very distinct promoter architectures depending on breadth of expression and
type of tissue.

Background
The control of gene transcription is mediated by transcription factors, which interact in a sequence-specific manner
with DNA motifs, known as transcription factor binding
sites (TFBS). These motifs are abundant in gene promoter
regions, upstream from the transcription start site (TSS).
The promoter is often divided into the basal or core promoter, covering approximately 100 bp upstream of the

TSS, and the proximal promoter, which extends up to a
few hundred base pairs and typically contains multiple
sites for activators [1]. Other functional regions, such as
enhancers, can be found at very distant locations from the
TSS. However, it appears that the region spanning from 550 to +50 with respect to the TSS is sufficient, in a large
proportion of human genes, to drive transcriptional activity in cultured cells [2].

One important aspect of promoter sequences is the specific arrangement of regulatory motifs along the DNA
sequence, and the existence of recurrent patterns in the
relative position of motifs. It has been observed that a
number of TFBS, including motifs for some of the most
abundant transcription factors, show a tendency to cluster
in the proximal promoter [3-7]. For example CCAAT
enhancer binding protein (CEBP) motifs are basically
found within an area from -100 to -50 with respect to the
TSS [8]. Another example is cyclic-AMP response element
(CRE), found in mammals far more frequently within 150
bp upstream from the TSS than in any other region [9].
On the other hand, it has been recently observed that a
number of motifs that are likely to be important for the
regulation of the expression of ribosomal protein genes
are located at fixed positions within the promoter [10]. It
is also well-known that TFBS can be arranged in particular
combinations forming functional regulatory units, known
as cis-regulatory modules [11,12]. Spacing between motifs
can be the result of transcription factor interaction
requirements in the context of particular cis-regulatory
modules. This type of constraints can be revealed by the
analysis of relative motif positions in many different
genes, with the discovery of recurrent motif location patterns or 'positional footprints'. A tool that can be used to
detect motif frequency profiles, using DNA words or a
restricted set of known TFBS matrices, is Signal search
analysis server [13]. We have recently developed another
application, PEAKS [14,15], which, in addition to oligomers, uses existing TFBS matrix libraries, calculates 'positional footprinting' scores and associated p-values, and
produces integrated motif views from large gene datasets.
Here we use PEAKS to perform the most exhaustive to date
analysis of motif positional biases in mammalian gene
promoters. To explore the effect of tissue-specificity we
use microarray data from 55 mouse tissues [16]. The analysis identifies distinctive features of promoters driving
housekeeping or tissue-specific expression, shows that a
number of well-known tissue-specific regulatory motifs
are subject to strong positional constraints and predicts
novel regulatory elements in different tissue expression
gene datasets.

Results
Positional bias of general motifs
We collected mouse gene sequences, spanning from -600
to +100 with respect to the TSS, using the UCSC genome
database [17]. This is what we will term "promoters",
although it approximately corresponds to what is generally understood as the proximal promoter region. In the
first place, we aimed at identifying general motifs that
showed a positional bias in a significant number of promoters. We analyzed 6,372 non-redundant mouse gene
promoter sequences with the previously developed program PEAKS [14,15]. A scheme of the procedure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

employed by PEAKS is shown in Figure 1. The first step is
the identification of putative motifs on the sequences
using one or more motif libraries. In this study we used
four different libraries: 508 vertebrate weight matrices corresponding to known transcription factor binding sites
from TRANSFAC [18]; 91 vertebrate weight matrices corresponding to known transcription factor binding sites
from JASPAR, or JASPAR CORE matrices [19]; 174 weight
matrices from JASPAR corresponding to putative regulatory sequences on the basis of phylogenetic conservation,
or JASPAR phyloFACTS [19]; and a non-redundant set of
2080 oligomers of size 6 (6mers). The second step of the
procedure is the generation of motif frequency profiles
along the promoter. The profiles represent the number of
sequences in which a motif is predicted at least once in a
sequence window surrounding each position. In this analysis, we used a window size of 31 nucleotides, so occurrence of motifs anywhere from -15 to +15 with respect to
the central position was sufficient for that position to be
positive. The use of sliding windows, instead of strict positions, provides a certain degree of flexibility to accommodate functional motif and TSS position variability. The
third step is the calculation of the positional footprinting
score (Spf) of the position with the highest motif frequency (maximum peak in the profile). This score measures the tendency of the motif to be located in a particular
region of the promoter, taking into account its overall
abundance and distribution [14]. Using random
sequences that mimic nucleotide variability along promoters, we obtain the p-value that corresponds to any particular Spf score. Promoter sequences contain regions with
very biased GC content. To model realistic sequence datasets we first partition all mouse promoter sequences into
three distinct types of regions according to their composition: 1. CpG islands; 2. GC-rich regions that are not CpG
islands and; 3. The rest of regions (see Methods for an
exact definition). We derive three distinct order 1 Markov
chain models from sequence regions that belong to the
same compositional class. Using these Markov chains, we
generate random sequence datasets with the same
number of sequences, and same partitioning in region
types, as in the real sequences. As a result, the random
sequences show similar composition to the real sequences
along the promoter (Additional file 1). Throughout this
work, we used a p-value <= 10-5 to identify motifs with significant Spf scores, unless stated otherwise.
In the complete mouse promoter dataset, we identified 29
significant motifs corresponding to matches to TRANSFAC matrices, 4 to JASPAR CORE matrices, 9 to JASPAR
phyloFACTS, and 22 to 6mers. In many cases, the same
motif was found by several of the libraries, but in other
cases the information obtained was complementary.
Although we considered a promoter region of length 700
nucleotides (from -600 to +100), all motifs were found in

a much smaller region, between around -150 and +100.
Basically, they were binding sites for general, commonly
found, transcription factors. Figure 2 shows an integrated
representation of the significant motifs obtained with the
four libraries. To deal with motif redundancy, both within
and across libraries, we clustered the motifs on the basis
of the degree of overlap in all promoter sequences (see
Methods and Additional file 2). We obtained nine different motif clusters, which are plotted with the same color
in Figure 2.
The nine different types of motifs showed characteristic
preferential positions with respect to the TSS (Figure 2,
Figure 3 ALL, and Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6). The Ying and
Yang (YY1/NF-E1) binding site motif was found downstream of the TSS (maximum peak at +26 with the TRANSFAC matrix V$YY1_02). In addition to several TRANSFAC
matrices (V$YY1_02, V$YY1_Q6 and V$NFMUE1_Q6),
this motif was detected by three different JASPAR phyloFACTS (AAGWWRNYGGC, ACAWNRNSRCGG and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

GCCATNTTG) and three 6mers (GCCATG, ATGGCG,
TGGCGG). Another characteristic element that we
detected in this region was made of repeats of GGC or
AGC. This motif was only detected with 6mers, and maximum peaks were located between +18 and +28 depending on the specific 6mer (see Figure 2 and Additional file
6). Upstream from the TSS, in a region around -20 to -40,
we detected three types of motifs corresponding to known
transcription factor binding sites. The first one corresponded to binding sites for the ETS-domain containing
family of transcription factors: TEL, ELK and GABP (maximum peak at -31 with V$ELK_01). The second one was
the TATA box (maximum peak at -36 with the JASPAR
CORE TBP matrix). The third motif was the E2F binding
site (maximum peak at -38 with V$E2F1_Q3_Q1). Transcription factors containing the ETS domain are involved
in the regulation of transcription in a great variety of biological processes in metazoans [20]. On the other hand,
E2F factors have been reported to be important for the
control of the cell cycle [21]. Further upstream we found
CREB-type motifs (cAMP response element-binding),
which are bound by CBP/ATF/E4F transcription factors
(maximum peak at -45 with V$E4F1_Q6). The region that
was significant for GC-box/SP1 motifs was located further
upstream (maximum peak at -62 with V$GC_01). The
transcription factor SP1 is involved in the expression of
many different genes, and can interact with other transcription factors, such as TBP (TATA-binding protein),
Ying and Yang and E2F [22]. Other GC-rich motifs, corresponding to binding sites for factors ZF5 and ETF were
part of the same motif cluster. A motif resembling the SP1
motif, but sufficiently distinct to be part of a different cluster, was identified with 6mers AGGCGG and TCCGCC
(GGCGGA when reversed), around the same region.
Finally, we identified CAAT-box/NF-Y motifs in a more
upstream position (maximum peak at -76 with
V$NFY_C).
Widely expressed versus tissue-specific genes
We next classified the mouse promoter sequences in several groups according to where the gene was expressed,
using normalized microarray data from 55 different
mouse organs and tissues [16]. In the first place we
wanted to investigate if the arrangement and nature of the
most common motifs depended on the breadth of expression. We defined a group of genes with expression limited
to 1–10 tissues ('restricted', 1822 genes) and a second
group of genes with expression in 51–55 different tissues
('housekeeping', 1544 genes). A comparison of the results
obtained in the three different datasets – complete promoter dataset (ALL), housekeeping genes (HK) and
restricted genes (RT) – is shown in Figure 3. In each motif
profile, the region of the peak that is above the line is the
motif significant region (represented by the width of the
oval in Figure 2). Only one representative TRANSFAC or

at the position with the maximum score divided by the minimum number of sequences containing that motif that would be
required to pass the p-value cut-off.

Promoter motif profiles in mouse genes with different expression width
Promoter motif profiles in mouse genes with different expression width. ALL: complete promoter dataset; HK:
housekeeping genes; RT: genes with restricted expression. Profiles were obtained with the program PEAKS using window size
31. Profiles with no significant sequence ranges (NA) did not accomplish p-value <= 10-5. Left-most cells contain the TRANSFAC matrix (or JASPAR for TBP) used for motif prediction and the significant regions in the different datasets. Background
color indicates score value grading, from intense red (highest) to pale yellow (lowest). 'score' is the positional footprinting
score; '%seq' percentage of sequences at maximum peak; 'pos.', position of the maximum peak; 'ranges' sequence interval significant above the p-value cut-off.
JASPAR matrix per motif cluster is shown, the complete
data is available in Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6.
Interestingly, there were very clear differences between HK
and RT genes. The peak corresponding to motifs for Ying
and Yang and nuclear factor E1 (YY1/NF-E1) was much
sharper in housekeeping genes than in the general dataset
(compare HK to ALL in Figure 3), and completely absent
from genes with restricted expression (RT). In the HK
dataset, 11% of the genes contained this motif in position
+27, while this number was only 3% for RT genes, around
the level of background signal for this motif. The YY1 fac-

tor is ubiquitous and involved in the control of basal transcription [23], which is consistent with our results.
Besides YY1, two other motifs did not achieve statistical
significance in the RT dataset. The first one was the cluster
CREB/ATF/E4F, which showed a much sharper peak in the
HK dataset than in the RT dataset. In particular, the percentage of HK genes containing E4F motifs at the maximum peak position was 6%, twice that of RT genes. E4F is
a ubiquitously expressed protein reported to be important
for mitotic progression [24]. The other motif that was not
significant in RT genes was the E2F binding site, which
was also about twice as frequent in HK genes than in RT

genes. On the other hand, GABP/ETS and GC-box/Sp1
motifs also showed higher Spf scores in HK than in RT.
Contrary to the motifs mentioned above, the TATA-box,
as well as CAAT-box/NF-Y, were stronger in the RT dataset
than in the HK dataset, although clearly significant in
both.
An important outcome of the comparison between ALL,
HK and RT datasets was that most of the motifs showed
higher scores in the HK dataset than in the RT dataset. This
is not surprising, as the latter are an amalgam of genes
with very diverse expression patterns, and so they are
likely to have more varied motif configurations or more
distally located regulatory regions. We also observed that
the average GC content, and in special the proportion of
genes with CpG islands, was higher in HK than in RT gene
promoters (Figure 3). Average GC content was 66.3% in
HK and 59.3% in RT, while the number of CpG islandcontaining promoters was 82% in HK and 39.2% in RT.
These differences are in agreement with previous reports
[25,26].
Tissue-specific motifs
We analyzed in greater detail the genes showing strong tissue-specificity, by performing a separate analysis of
groups of RT genes expressed in each of the different adult
tissues (N = 47). For example the dataset 'liver' was composed of genes from the RT class (expressed in 1–10 tissues) that showed expression in liver. One can expect that
some tissues will be more similar to each other, in regard
to the genes that they express, than others. To learn about
this, we clustered the tissues according to the number of
shared expressed genes. We identified four main clusters,
in which every pair of tissues shared at least 30% of the
genes of one tissue. The clusters, A to D, corresponded, to
a large extent, to known physiological systems (Additional file 7). Cluster A was composed by diverse tissues
from the nervous system; cluster B was mainly composed
by tissues related to the digestive system; cluster C by muscle and skin tissues; and cluster D by bone, lymph and
bladder. We obtained non-redundant gene datasets for
each cluster. These datasets were composed of RT genes
for which at least 50% of the tissues in which they were
expressed belonged to that cluster. Surprisingly, commonly found motifs (those shown in Figure 2) showed a
very different distribution in different RT gene clusters
(Additional data files 3, 4, 5, 6). For example, the GABP/
ETS motif, as well as CREB/ATF, only reached significant
scores in cluster D; the GC-box/SP1 was only significant in
cluster A and B; and, the CAAT-box/NF-Y was only significant in cluster A.

In the analysis of RT genes expressed in particular tissues
(47 datasets) we obtained 337 significant motif peaks at
p-value <= 10-5: 169 with TRANSFAC matrices, 18 with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

JASPAR CORE matrices, 48 with JASPAR phyloFACTS
matrices and, 102 with 6mers (Additional data files 3, 4,
5, 6). Many of the motifs corresponded to common transcription factor binding sites, already detected in the analysis of all genes. To identify motifs that were directly
related to tissue-specificity, we obtained a list of motifs
that were significant in RT genes expressed in a given tissue but not in HK genes. We identified 58 different ones,
found in one or a few related tissues. Of these, 14 corresponded to TRANSFAC matrices, 2 to JASPAR CORE
matrices, 10 to JASPAR phyloFACTS matrices and, 32 to
6mers. Figure 4 shows a selection of such motifs. A
number of them are well-known tissue-specific motifs.
For example in genes expressed in liver, aside from the
more general TATA and CAAT sites, there were significant
peaks for HNF-1 (maximum peak at -79 with matrix
V$HNF1_01), and HNF-4 (maximum peak at -92 with
V$HNF4_01_B). HNF-1 and HNF-4 are members of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) family, and are wellknown regulators of expression in liver and other related
tissues [27]. Accordingly, the HNF-4 motif was also found
in large intestine (main peak at -82 with V$DR1_Q3),
and, with p-value <= 10-3, in small intestine (main peak at
-78 with V$HNF4_01_B) and kidney (main peak at -91
with V$HNF4_DR1_Q3). The HNF-1 motif was also significant, at p-value <= 10-3, in kidney (maximum peak at
-70 with V$HNF1_Q6).
Several motifs were repeatedly found in tissues from the
nervous system (cluster A, Additional file 7). GC-box/SP1
and alphaCP1 motifs were particularly strong in nervous
tissue genes. Among tissue-specific motifs, MZF1 was significant in cortex, hindbrain and midbrain (maximum
peak between -39 to -44, p-value <= 10-3); AP2 in brain,
cortex, hindbrain and striatum (maximum peak between
-50 and -58, p-value <= 10-3 in the three latter tissues); and
EGR in striatum (maximum peak at -81, p-value = 6.08 ×
10-4). There is evidence that the factors EGR1, AP2 and
SP1 are required for the neuroendocrine-specific expression of chromogranine B gene [28]. Myeloid zinc finger 1
(MZF-1) is known to play a major role in myeloid cell differentiation. The enrichment we find in neural tissue
expressed genes may mean that this factor regulates neural
processes as well, or that the motif resembles the consensus sequences for another, yet uncharacterized, neural factor.
In testis, the RFX1 motif was significant (max. peak at -16
with V$RFX1_02), which is consistent with the abundance of RFX factors in this tissue [29]. This motif was not
found in any other tissue. Similarly, MYB and PBX1 were
only found only in bone marrow (max. peak at -4 and 473, respectively, p-value <= 10-3). MYB is known to be
important for the regulation of hematopoiesis [30].

Interestingly, there were several tissue-specific motifs that
could be detected with JASPAR phyloFACTS, or by 6mers,
but not using matrices for known transcription factor
binding sites. Many of these motifs are likely to correspond to yet uncharacterized transcription factor binding
sites. For example phyloFACTs motif CTGCAGY showed a
significant peak at +31 in brain, RGAGGAARY at -34 in
bladder, and YCATTAA at -307 in mammary gland (Figure
4). Other putative tissue-specific motifs were only
detected with 6mers. Examples include TAGAAC, at -353
in bone marrow, ATGAGA at -413 in hindbrain, and
AGATTC at -490 in uterus.
Transcription factor target predictions
An important outcome of this work was the prediction of
many novel potential transcription factor sequence targets
in the regions showing significant positional bias (p-value
<= 10-5). It is a well-known fact that predictions of regulatory motifs suffer from the problem of false positive detection. However, given the strong position-dependency of
the motifs found by PEAKS, predictions within the identified significant regions are expected to be much more reliable than predictions elsewhere in the promoter (see also
next section). Using TRANSFAC matrices, predictions for
commonly found binding sites (those in Figure 2A) were
mapped to 5,798 different promoters (Additional file 8).
This means that the vast majority of promoters (91%)
contain at least one of the general regulatory motifs in the
significant sequence range. Besides, we also obtained 559
predictions for motifs not significant in the ALL or HK
datasets, providing annotations for putative tissue-specific
transcription factor binding sites in 394 different promoters (Additional file 9). The total number of genes with one
or more predicted motifs was 5942 (Additional file 10).
Among tissue-specific motifs we found 86 RFX1 matches
in 74 different promoters, 61 AP2 matches in 47 promoters, 40 PU1 matches in 34 promoters and, 32 HNF4
matches in 20 promoters.
Comparison with experimental data
In a previous study using yeast promoters, we showed that
regions identified by PEAKS were significantly enriched in
real binding sites [14]. To compare the computational
results of this study with experimental data, we systematically search all the experimental binding site annotations
for mouse genes in TRANSFAC, and map them onto our
genes. We recovered 35 non-redundant experimentally
validated sites that could be successfully mapped to genes
in our dataset, for GC-box/SP1, CAAT-box/NF-Y, CREB/
ATF, YY1/NF-E1, GAB/ETS and HNF-4. In general, the
computational and experimental results were in very good
agreement, and 25 of the 35 sites fell within significant
regions (p-value <= 10-5). By individual motifs, 15/18 of
the GC-box/SP1 experimental sites, 5/7 of the experimental YY1/NF-E1 sites and 3/4 of the experimental CAAT-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

box/NF-Y fell within regions that were significant in the
PEAKS analysis. For CREB/ATF, instead, only 1 out of 4
sites were located in PEAKS significant regions. For GABP/
ETS and HNF-4 we only had one experimental site to
compare with. The GABP/ETS site fell within the significant region. However, the HNF-4 site, in cytochrome
P450 Cyp3a16, was located upstream from the region
identified by PEAKS. This finding prompted us to scrutinize all other HNF-1 and HNF-4 experimental sites in
TRANSFAC mouse gene entries, even if the genes were not
in our dataset. These motifs were present in four additional TRANSFAC mouse gene entries: albumin 1 (HNF1), alpha-fetoprotein (HNF-1 and HNF-4), retinol-binding protein II (HNF-4) and, transthyretin (HNF4). Of
these 5 cases, 4 fell within the regions identified by PEAKS
(-92 to -79), and only the HNF-4 motif in retinol-binding
protein II was outside the significant region. In the work
presented here, we found 31 additional putative HNF-4
sites, in different mouse promoters, which fell within the
significant region. Given the positive outcome of the comparison between computational and experimental site
locations, many of these sites are likely to be functional.
In support of this, a region in which we predict HNF-4
sites in the hepatic lipase gene, has been recently observed
to be responsible for enhanced promoter activity in liver
cells, and for silencing expression in non-liver cells [31].

Discussion
Important information on the spatio-temporal expression
pattern of a gene is encrypted in gene promoter sequences.
Within promoters, particular arrangements of regulatory
motifs facilitate specific transcription factor interactions,
which result in transcription activation or repression.
Transcription regulatory regions can evolve quickly, and
similar motifs are often present in genes with coordinated
gene expression, even if the genes are not homologues.
Recurrent motif arrangements are thus presumably the
result of similar evolutionary constraints in genes that are
part of the same regulatory network. In the present study
we have focused on motif arrangement in the proximal
promoter, using the distance from the transcription start
site. Until now, studies on positionally biased regulatory
motifs had only been performed for general promoter
motifs [6,7,32], or, at the other extreme, for motifs found
in very specific datasets of functionally related genes
[10,33]. Here we have investigated the impact of motifs
with positional bias in the configuration of promoters
driving expression in various body tissues, and used this
property to uncover potentially novel tissue-specific regulators.
A number of computational studies have established that
particular DNA words tend to cluster in the vicinity of the
transcription start site in mammalian gene promoters
[6,7,32]. Our analysis indicates that the TATA box is not a

particularly common motif, the peak observed using
TRANSFAC matrix V$MTATA_B corresponds to only 3,4%
of the genes, although given that this refers to a region +/
- 15 bp of position -41, it is likely to be an under-estimation of the real number of sites. The low frequency of this
motif is in strong contrast with previous ideas on the central role of this motif in transcription, but more in line
with more recent estimates based on larger datasets
[34,35]. Indeed, TATA-containing promoters are more
typical of tissue-specific genes than of housekeeping
genes, and show a high degree of conservation across species [34]. Promoters containing GC-rich SP1 binding sites,
on the contrary, appear to be very widespread, and their
frequency is higher in housekeeping than in tissue-specific
genes (Figure 3). Other very common motifs in mammalian promoters include binding sites for the ETS family of
transcription factors, for E2F1, and CAAT-box/NF-Y
motifs. None of the known basic motifs in the core promoter appears to be universal, and each one is present in
only a fraction of genes. Basic motifs can combine in different ways, and it has been shown that some combinations – such as CAAT and SP1 sites – are particularly
common [6]. Interactions between several of the transcription factors that assemble at the core promoter have
been described, including YY1 and SP1 [36], E2F and SP1
[37] and, NF-Y (CAAT-box) and TATA binding protein
(TBP)-associated factors [38]. These protein interactions
are likely to impose constraints on the relative positions
of the corresponding DNA motifs, which would explain
why we find such strong motif positional dependencies.
In support of this, it has been shown that the activity of
the thymidine kinase promoter depends on the distance
between E2F motifs and upstream SP1 binding sites [37].
Our results strongly indicate that housekeeping gene promoters have more fixed promoter structures than the class
composed of promoters driving restricted tissue expression. This is not surprising, as distinct regulators are
expected to control expression in different tissue types.
On the other hand, we have shown that the Ying and Yang
(YY) downstream motif is a very important constitutive
element of genes with broad expression, whereas it
appears to be of little relevance in genes that show tissuespecific expression. Other motifs, such as E2F and CREB/
ATF/E4F, also show much stronger peaks in housekeeping
genes than in tissue-restricted genes. Interestingly, in the
latter the maximum peak position is displaced towards a
more upstream position (-59 in RT, versus -42 in HK, for
E4F, Figure 3), pointing to possible mechanistic differences in the way these factors interact with the initiation
complex in the two classes of genes.
The control of tissue-specific expression is still poorly
understood. We have been able to identify a number of
motifs that show positional bias in tissue-restricted data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

sets. Previous studies on the identification of tissue-specific motifs were based on cross-species conservation and
subsequent detection of tissue enrichment [5], or on the
identification of cis-regulatory modules with high tissuespecific expression predictive value [39]. In relation to the
latter study, Smith et al. [40] provided a list of tissue-specific expression important motifs: HNF-1, HNF-3, HNF-4,
C/EBP and DBP in liver; MEF-2, SRF, Myogenin and SP1
in skeletal muscle and; SRY, CREM, RFX in testis (see
Table III of [40]). Of these motifs, we found that HNF-1
and HNF-4 in liver, and RFX in testis, showed significant
positional biases. Instead, the above-mentioned musclespecific motifs were not identified in our analysis. This
could be due to a more flexible and variable arrangement
of motifs in these genes, or simply to the motifs being outside the region of the promoter considered (proximal
region). In relation to this, it has been recently proposed
that motifs bound by RFX factors are very abundant in
conserved non-coding regions, scattered throughout the
genome [41]. In another study [42], using cross-specific
conservation criteria, it was found that AP-2, SP1 and
EGR-1 were over-represented in neural tissues. AP-2 and
EGR-1 showed positional bias in several nervous system
tissues. On the other hand, SP1, while significant in the
majority of tissues, achieved the largest positional footprinting scores in mammary gland, brown fat and pancreas.
Many of the motifs that show significant positional bias in
our analysis are located within the first 100 bp upstream
of the TSS. This is not surprising considering that the
sequences are anchored at the TSS in this analysis, and
position dependencies between interacting motif-binding
proteins are expected to be more relevant for short distances [36,37]. More unexpected is the presence of motifs
with positional bias much further upstream, in several tissue-restricted datasets. This includes MEIS1BHOXA9 in
liver (maximum peak at -433), PBX1 in bone marrow
(maximum peak at -473, p-value = 4.22 × 10-4), STAT5A
in eye (maximum peak at -469, p-value = 4.26 × 10-4), and
OCT1 in olfactory bulb (maximum peak at -540, p-value
= 8.35 × 10-4). One possibility to explain these cases is the
existence of stronger evolutionary constraints in a longer
portion of the promoter. Our own data on the weaker
sequence conservation of housekeeping promoters with
respect to tissue-specific distal promoters, particularly
upstream from position -500, points in this direction
[43]. On the other hand, from this study it can also be
concluded that, contrary to what is generally assumed, the
motif content of the region around the TSS can vary
greatly depending on specific tissue expression. Datasetspecific motifs with positional bias have also been identified in ribosomal gene [10] or histone-coding gene promoters [33]. Therefore, both shared motif content and
shared relative motif positions appear to be important for

the regulation of genes with similar tissue expression patterns.

Conclusion
In this work we have shown that motifs with positional
bias are abundant in mammalian promoters and can be
used to define distinct promoter architectures depending
on breadth or tissue of gene expression. The results offer
new insights into the shaping of motif arrangement in
promoter sequences by evolutionary processes. We provide predictions for a large number of motifs, including
general as well as tissue-specific motifs, that show positional bias. This work provides a foundation for future
studies on motif position constraints in gene regulatory
sequences.

Methods
DNA sequences and tissue expression data
Gene datasets were defined from mouse transcriptome
microarray data from Zhang et al. [16]. The corresponding
gene promoter sequences were extracted from UCSC database (mm6) [17]. We selected genes that had a unique
annotated TSS in the database as a representative set. The
analysis comprised 6,372 non-redundant promoter
sequences, which spanned from -600 to +100 relative to
the TSS position. These sequences define the ALL dataset.
Subsequently, genes were classified in 3 classes according
to expression breadth: housekeeping (HK), 1,544 genes
expressed in 51–55 tissues; intermediate, 3,006 genes
expressed in 11–50 tissues and; restricted (RT), 1,822
genes with expression restricted to 1–10 tissues. Because
many tissues can share cell types, or cell functions, we calculated the number of shared genes between tissues. We
measured the overlap between all pairs of tissues and
selected those pairs sharing at least 30% of genes. We
selected 4 clusters that contained more than 2 adult
mouse tissues. They showed a good agreement with physiological systems: 'nervous' (A), 'digestive/kidney' (B),
muscular/skin' (C) and, 'skeletal/lymphatic/bladder' (D).
They are shown in Additional file 7.
DNA motif prediction
For the detection of known motifs in the sequences we
used three weight matrix collections of transcription factor binding sites: TRANSFAC 7 containing 508 vertebrate
position specific weight matrices (PSWMs), JASPAR containing 91 vertebrate CORE PSWMs and, JASPAR 174 phyloFACTS PSWMs. Sequence hits to a matrix were defined
as those that showed an overall matrix relative similarity
score >= 0.90 and, for TRANSFAC matrices, an overall
matrix relative similarity score >= 0.85 and core similarity
score >= 0.99 [18]. To measure similarity to the TRANSFAC matrices we implemented the metrics described in
[44], as used in the program MatInspector. For JASPAR
matrices we used log-likelihood ratio scores. We also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

scanned the sequences for perfect matches to all oligomers of size 6 (6mers). Matches to both the sense and the
anti-sense strand were considered. For this reason, the
number of effective 6mers to be tested could be reduced
from 4096 to 2080 (including 64 palindromic 6mers).
Positional footprinting (PEAKS analysis)
For those DNA motifs that showed at least one match in
any promoter sequence we performed PEAKS analysis. In
this analysis, all sequences were of the same length (l) and
contained a common element, the transcription start site
(TSS), used as the reference position. For each DNA motif
we scanned the sequences with a sliding window (w, uneven size) and counted the number of sequences that contained at least one occurrence of the DNA motif (motifs
were matches to PSWMs or 6mer, see above) within that
window, assigning this number, n(i), to the window central nucleotide, i. We used these values to build a motif
profile along the sequence positions. In order to determine the positional bias of a motif we assigned a signal to
noise score to each profile and estimated its p-value using
random sequence datasets (see below). We then extracted
the significant positions where the motif was located.

To measure the positional bias of a motif, which is basically the number of motif occurrences, at a particular position, n(i) relative to the background signal level, we use
the positional footprinting score Spf [14]. It results from
three diverse scores. The first score (Sn) measures the
number of motif occurrences at a specific position with
respect to the average number along the sequence. The
second score (Sr) penalizes signals present in only a very
small percentage of sequences, by dividing the number of
ocurrences at the specific location by the number of
sequences used. Finally, the third score (Sm) is the
number of occurrences at that position divided by the
total number of motif predictions, used to penalize matrices that are very noisy and occur at a very high frequency,
which is often due to low specificity of the matrix. As the
scores account for different aspects of the signal to noise
ratio, we multiply them to obtain a single final score: Spf
= Sn Sr Sm. See PEAKS web documentation for a more
detailed description of the Spf score [15].
The maximum value of the positional footprinting score
Spf, which corresponds to the maximum peak of the
motif, was defined as Spf _max. To assess the significance
of Spf _max for each DNA motif tested in the dataset, we
used 1000 different synthetic sequence datasets (see
below). In each simulation we kept the random Spf _max.
We then counted how many simulations showed a random Spf _max equal or higher than the observed Spf
_max, and obtained the corresponding empiric p-value.
The Spf _max values were distributed according to an
extreme value distribution. We used this property to esti-

mate the p-value that corresponded to a given score using
linear interpolation. After selection of a p-value cut-off,
the significant regions were defined by the concatenation
of all positions that showed a score associated with a pvalue below the cut-off.
Throughout this study we used w = 31 and p-value <= 105, unless stated otherwise. In addition, we filtered those
motifs that, even if statistically significant, showed multiple peaks or very weak peaks (less than two fold motif frequency at the maximum peak position with respect to the
background or Spf _max < 15).
Construction of synthetic datasets
In the synthetic datasets, each random sequence had a
similar composition than a real sequence in the dataset.
This was achieved by using three order 1 Markov models,
each of which corresponded to a compositionally different region. The three compositionally different regions
were defined in the complete mouse promoter sequence
dataset. The first type corresponded to CpG islands,
regions of length at least 200 bp, with a minimum GC
content of 55% and a minimum observed/expected GpG
content ratio of 0.65 [43]. The second type corresponded
to GC-rich regions that did not conform to the CpG island
definition. They were at least 200 bp long and had a minimum GC content of 55%. The remaining regions made
the third type. Each promoter in the study was partitioned
into these three regions. Of course, different promoters
varied in the number and extension of these regions. We
then concatenated all the regions that were of the same
type to construct three different order 1 Markov chains.
Each random sequence was generated using one, two or
three Markov chains, preserving the partitioning in different regions observed in the original sequence. By this
approach, we obtain synthetic datasets that were remarkably similar in composition to real datasets along the promoter (Additional file 1).
Motif clustering
There was a considerable amount of redundancy in the
motifs identified, both within and across motif libraries.
To disentangle it, we clustered the motifs using hierarchical clustering (R package complete hierarchical clustering,
[45]). Distance between motifs was based on the proportion of overlapping motif matches along all non-redundant promoter sequences. Specifically, say we have motif
A and motif B (represented as matches to PSWMs or
6mers). Then the distance between A and B will the dist
(A, B) = ((N(A, B)/N(A))+(N(A, B)/N(B))/2, where N(A,
B) is the number of predictions of motif A and predictions
of motif B that overlap, N(A) the total number of predictions of motif A and, N(B) the total number of predictions
of motif B. The dissimilarity cut-off used was 0.98. This
approach resulted in 9 different clusters out of a total of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/459

65 significant motifs in the complete mouse promoter
dataset (Additional file 2).
Mapping of significant motifs in promoter sequences
The PEAKS analysis yielded significant regions for various
motifs in each of the datasets tested. We extracted the
actual predictions of the motifs in the promoter
sequences, considering those motifs that fell within the
significant region, and those located up to 15 nucleotides
upstream or downstream of this region, as they also contributed to the peak considering that the window size
employed was 31. Additional files 8 and 9 contain the predictions of general (significant in the complete collection
of mouse promoters) as well as non-general motifs. Additional file 10 is a zipped file containing individual files
with predictions of general and non-general motifs per
each gene, in BED format. This includes 5942 genes, for
which we found significant motif predictions, and a
README file with instructions on how to visualize them
using UCSC Genome Browser.
Global over-representation statistics
We calculated motif frequencies in complete promoter
sequences using the PSWM predictions as described previously. To assess if a motif was over-represented in a particular dataset we calculated the corresponding p-value using
synthetic datasets as described for positional footprinting.
In addition, we compared the relative abundance of the
motif in the particular dataset to that obtained in the general dataset (ALL). The values for each motif that showed
significant positional bias are provided in Additional files
3, 4, 5, 6.
