similar to mammals

Abstract
Background: Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the transport of water and small solutes
across cell membranes. These proteins are vital for maintaining water homeostasis in living organisms. In mammals,
thirteen aquaporins (AQP0-12) have been characterized, but in lower vertebrates, such as fish, the diversity,
structure and substrate specificity of these membrane channel proteins are largely unknown.
Results: The screening and isolation of transcripts from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome revealed eighteen
sequences structurally related to the four subfamilies of tetrapod aquaporins, i.e., aquaporins (AQP0, -1 and -4),
water and glycerol transporters or aquaglyceroporins (Glps; AQP3 and AQP7-10), a water and urea transporter
(AQP8), and two unorthodox aquaporins (AQP11 and -12). Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequences demonstrated dual paralogy between teleost and human aquaporins. Three of the duplicated
zebrafish isoforms have unlinked loci, two have linked loci, while DrAqp8 was found in triplicate across two
chromosomes. Genomic sequencing, structural analysis, and maximum likelihood reconstruction, further revealed
the presence of a putative pseudogene that displays hybrid exons similar to tetrapod AQP5 and -1. Ectopic
expression of the cloned transcripts in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that zebrafish aquaporins and Glps
transport water or water, glycerol and urea, respectively, whereas DrAqp11b and -12 were not functional in
oocytes. Contrary to humans and some rodents, intrachromosomal duplicates of zebrafish AQP8 were water and
urea permeable, while the genomic duplicate only transported water. All aquaporin transcripts were expressed in
adult tissues and found to have divergent expression patterns. In some tissues, however, redundant expression of
transcripts encoding two duplicated paralogs seems to occur.
Conclusion: The zebrafish genome encodes the largest repertoire of functional vertebrate aquaporins with dual
paralogy to human isoforms. Our data reveal an early and specific diversification of these integral membrane
proteins at the root of the crown-clade of Teleostei. Despite the increase in gene copy number, zebrafish
aquaporins mostly retain the substrate specificity characteristic of the tetrapod counterparts. Based upon the
integration of phylogenetic, genomic and functional data we propose a new classification for the piscine
aquaporin superfamily.

Background
Aquaporins constitute a superfamily of major intrinsic
proteins (MIPs) that facilitate passive, yet remarkably
efficient permeation of water molecules across cellular
membranes [1,2]. Some aquaporins can also permeate
non-ionic compounds, such as glycerol and urea, and
are termed glycerol facilitators (Glps) or aquaglyceroporins. The first water channel was isolated from human
red blood cell membranes as a novel integral membrane
protein of 28 kDa (CHIP28). This channel is now
termed aquaporin-1 (AQP1) [3]. Subsequently, thirteen
aquaporin paralogs (AQP0-12) have been identified in
mammals [1], and up to 38 MIP-related sequences,
divided into four types, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), small
and basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and nodulin 26-like
intrinsic proteins (NIPs), have been documented in
plants [4-6]. Each form is composed of a single polypeptide chain varying in length from ~270-350 amino acids
that spans the lipid bilayer six times with three extracellular loops (loop A, C and E) and two intracellular loops
(loop B and D), which have their N- and C-termini
located intracellularly. The loops B and E fold and
extend intramembranous hemi-helices that bear the
highly conserved amino acid motifs Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA),
which are involved in the formation of the water pore.
When translocated to the cell membrane, most aquaporins form homotetramers [7-9], in which one or two
monomers may be glycosylated, but each monomer
functions as an independent water channel [10,11].
The maintenance of body fluid homeostasis is essential for the survival of any living organism. Aquatic animals also face the problem of direct interaction with
their aqueous environment. Depending upon the life
history of the species, the osmolarity of the saline or
freshwater medium differs manifold from their internal
body fluids, and therefore an important physiological
role of aquaporins would be expected. Accordingly,
some studies in teleosts have reported differential
mRNA and protein expression of specific aquaporin isoforms in osmoregulatory organs in response to changes
in environmental salinity [12-16]. Moreover, recent studies of neofunctionalized vitellogenins and the essential
role of an AQP1-related channel have revealed the evolutionary importance of oocyte hydration in marine teleosts as a pre-adaptation to spawning in the hyperosmotic oceanic environment [17-24]. To date, however,
the genomic repertoire of aquaporin isoforms present in
teleosts, as well as the permeability properties of the
encoded proteins, remains largely unknown.
During the last decades, the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
has become a powerful model organism in comparative
genomics and developmental biology. This species is

amenable for genetic analysis in which large-scale mutagenesis screens have been successfully performed, and a
large amount of genomic and expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) data, BAC libraries and fine genetic linkage maps
have been accumulated [25]. Work with zebrafish has
also extended its application to a wide variety of experimental studies relevant to human disease, such as cardiovascular disorders, angiogenesis and neurological and
renal diseases [26,27]. Aquaporins have been shown to
play important roles in some of these alterations [28],
and therefore the diversity and functional properties of
zebrafish aquaporins need to be determined prior to
using this species as a suitable experimental model in
biomedical research and comparative physiology.
With the sequence of the zebrafish genome completed, the complexity of the teleost aquaporin gene
family can be assessed. In the present study, we
screened the zebrafish genome for aquaporin-related
sequences and determined their phylogenetic relationships, permeability properties, and the pattern of mRNA
expression in adult tissues. We found a high number of
functional aquaporins in this species, and based upon
the data obtained we propose a new classification of the
piscine aquaporin superfamily.

Results and Discussion
The zebrafish aquaporin gene family

The screening of the zebrafish genome revealed the presence of 18 putative members of the aquaporin superfamily, most of them existing as duplicate or triplicate
genes, ranging in size from 2.2 to 18 kb that encode
proteins between 255-320 amino acids long (Figure 1).
We successfully cloned and characterized 17 of these
transcripts. The nomenclature of these genes was chosen based on their phylogenetic position and chromosomal locus, their identity to human orthologs, as well as
on their structural and functional features (see below),
in accordance with the recommended guidelines for
Human Genome Nomenclature [29] and the Zebrafish
Information Network [30]. Thus, zebrafish aquaporin-4,
-7, -11b and -12 (draqp4, -7, -11b and -12, respectively)
are present as single copy genes, whereas aquaporin-0,
-1, -3, -9 and -10 genes (draqp0a, -0b, -1a, -1b, -3a, -3b,
-9a, -9b, -10a and -10b, respectively) are duplicates. For
the draqp8 gene, three copies were found (draqp8aa,
-8ab and -8b). Unlike the other aquaporin isoforms, we
found that Aqp8 has both tandem and genomic duplicates encoded within the genomes of zebrafish and
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (see below for an
explanation of the nomenclature).
The deduced amino acid sequences of zebrafish aquaporins contain six predicted transmembrane helices and
two NPA boxes that are the hallmark of the MIP

conservation. Highest residue similarity (blue: 100%, green: 80-100% or sand; 60-80%) is found within the a-helical regions (H1-8). The
transmembrane domains (TMD1-6) are annotated for DrAqp0a based upon a molecular sequence wrap to the crystallographically resolved
structure of Bos taurus AQP0 (B). The structure wrap consists of the complete peptides (263 amino acids) with a gapless identity/similarity of
70.3/85.9%. The render shows identical residues in red, non-identical in blue. The hemi-helices H3 and H7 (yellow) on loops B and E, respectively,
fold such that the opposing NPA motifs (pink in the alignment) interact to present the arginine constriction (DrAqp0a R187 green ball and stick,
and arrow in alignment). The C-terminal domain is shown with a grey a-helix.

superfamily [31]. The only exception was DrAqp8b in
which only five transmembrane domains could be determined in silico, despite the equality in sequence length.
Analysis of the primary structures of the zebrafish aquaporins indicated that they could be classified into two
paralogous subgroups and two more divergent subgroups (Figure 2). The first subgroup includes DrAqp0a,
-0b, -1a, -1b and -4, which share 35-85% amino acid
identity (Additional file 1) and clustered with the Escherichia coli aquaporin-Z (EcAqpZ), thus suggesting that
these aquaporins belong to the water-specific aquaporin
subfamily [31]. The identity of the duplicated isoforms
present in this group varied, since DrAqp0a and -0b
were 85% identical, whereas DrAqp1a and -1b share
only 61% identity (Additional file 1). The second group
includes DrAqp3a, -3b, -7, -9a, -9b, -10a and -10b,
which were 40-73% identical and clustered together
with the E. coli glycerol facilitator (EcGlpF), suggesting
that they belong to the aquaglyceroporin (Glp) subfamily. In this group, the identity between DrAqp3a and
-3b, DrAqp9a and -9b, and DrAqp10a and -10b, was 73,
61 and 45%, respectively. The percent identity between
the aquaporin and Glp groups was as low as 19-28%.
The most divergent paralogs were those including the
AQP8-like (DrAqp8aa, -8ab and -8b), and DrAqp11b
and -12 sequences, which share 23-28% and 13-25%
identity, and 20-14% and 4-22% identity with aquaporins
and Glps, respectively. DrAqp8aa, -8ab and -8b share
43-60% identity between them, and DrAqp11b and -12
were 27% identical. These observations indicate that
zebrafish harbours the largest complement of aquaporin
genes of any vertebrate studied to date, which can be
classified into four tetrapod-like subfamilies [2]: classical
water-selective aquaporins (AQP0, AQP1 and AQP4), a
water and urea transporter (AQP8), classical Glps
(AQP3 and AQP7-10), and two unorthodox aquaporins
(AQP11b and -12).

were <5 kb, although the last intron of draqp4 was of
9.7 kb, whereas the second intron of draqp9b and draqp8aa, and the first intron of draqp12, were of 8.2, 6.3
and 6.6 kb in length. In the case of draqp9a, the quality
of the genomic sequences available did not allow assessment of intron length.
Examination of the zebrafish aquaporin gene structures in relation to orthologs in other metazoan organisms revealed a generally well-conserved exon-intron
organization (Additional file 2). Classical aquaporins
(aqp0, -1, -2, -5 and -6) are encoded by 4 exons, with
Xenopus tropicalis aqp1 as an apparent exception with 2
exons. Metazoan aqp4 is encoded by 5 exons, although
Drosophila melanogaster aqp4 shows some variability.
aqp8 is a polymorphic gene encoded by 6 exons in tetrapods, 5 exons in teleosts, 2-3 exons in Diptera and 6-7
exons in Nematoda. Classical Glps are highly conserved
with 5-6 exons in metazoa, while the vertebrate-specific
unorthodox aqp11 has 3 exons, but the more ancestral
unorthodox aqp12 retains 3-4 exons in vertebrates, but
4-7 exons in invertebrates.
In silico genomic screening using ensembl v56 [32]
also revealed the presence of an 18th gene in zebrafish
(ENSDARG00000038202) with an anomalous structure
showing 8 exons (Figure 3). The inferred exon structure
of this gene is different to that of other metazoan aquaporins and the gene appears to be a hybrid with exons
1-3 more related to AQP2 and -5, but exons 4-8 showing higher nucleotide sequence identity to AQP1 and -6
(Additional file 3). Using BLAST we noted that it was
related to tetrapod AQP5. To validate the existence of
this gene, we isolated genomic DNA based upon the
predicted ensembl sequence. Using PCR and subsequent
sequencing, we found that exons 1-3 are 100% identical
to the predicted sequence, and the gene was therefore

Genomic organization

The division of the zebrafish aquaporin superfamily into
four subfamilies inferred from comparison of the
deduced protein sequences is mirrored in the intronexon structures (Figure 3). Most classical aquaporins
include four exons, draqp4 being an exception with five
exons, whereas the Glp genes are characterized by six
exons, with the exception of draqp3b, which is encoded
by five exons. The draqp8aa, draqp8ab and draqp8b
transcripts are invariably coded by five exons, whereas
the unorthodox draqp12 showed four exons as the
aquaporin subfamily. In draqp11b, three exons were
observed although in this case the intron-exon boundaries were not well defined and therefore the number of
exons could not be determined with certainty. In the
majority of zebrafish aquaporin genes the intron lengths

named draqp5/1 in accordance with its hybrid status.
Maximum likelihood analysis of the codons of draqp5/1
confirmed that exons 1-3 encode a putative protein that
is structurally related to tetrapod AQP5 and -2, while
exons 4-8 encode a putative protein that is more related
to AQP1 (Additional file 4). Bayesian analysis of the
codons placed exon 1-3 basal to AQP0, but the protein
product as a polytomy between AQP5 and AQP2 (data
not shown). It therefore appears that despite retaining a
large aquaporin repertoire of which ~40% are duplicate

isoforms specific to the teleost crown-clade, the zebrafish lacks functional orthologs of tetrapod AQP2, -5 or
-6 genes.
Phylogenetic analysis of zebrafish aquaporins

To validate the orthology of the zebrafish aquaporins,
we investigated the molecular phylogeny of 233 piscine
nucleotide and amino acid sequences in relation to 14
human orthologs (Figures 4 and 5). These analyses corroborated the structural homologies outlined above and

Tingaud-Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:38

consistently demonstrated a dual- or in the case of
Aqp8 a tri-paralogous clustering of piscine isoforms as
sister branches to human orthologs. Two mutually
exclusive clades are observed within the superfamily, a
vertebrate aquaporin clade containing nine subfamilies
(Aqp8, -12, 11, -4, -1, -0, 2, -5 and -6) stemming from
EcAqpZ (Figure 4), and a Glp clade containing four vertebrate subfamilies (Aqp9, -3, -7 and -10) that stem
from EcGlpF (Figure 5). The elasmobranch aquaporins
are represented by single-copy variants, of which all but
Aqp7, -11, -8, -2, -5 and -6 were found. Each clustered
basal to Teleostei or together with the human transcripts indicating that the encoded proteins have differentially evolved functions specific to the actinopterygian
or sarcopterygian lineages, respectively. The internal distribution of teleost isoforms within each subfamily was
consistent with a whole genome duplication (WGD)
event at the root of the crown-clade [20,33-36]. The
topology within each teleost subcluster was fully congruent with phylogenetic rank and encompasses members
of the Elopomorpha (e.g. eels), Ostariophysi (e.g. zebrafish and carps), Protacanthopterygii (e.g. salmonids) and
Acanthomorpha (e.g Gadiformes and Perciformes). We
therefore annotated each of the teleost paralogs with the
postscript “a” or “b” to reflect the genomic duplicate.
By including genomic variants together with transcripts available from GenBank [37], and by investigating the syntenic relationships of each ortholog (Finn
and Cerdà, unpublished data), we were able to validate
whether a duplicated gene arose through WGD or
resulted from intrachromosomal duplication. Despite
the observation that draqp1a and -1b, draqp0a and -0b,
and draqp7 and -3b are linked (Figure 3), we only find
strong evidence of one tandem duplicate within the
crown-clade: aqp8aa (ENSDARG00000045141) and
aqp8ab (ENSDARG00000071592) in zebrafish, and
aqp8aa (ENSGACG00000009127) and aqp8ab
(ENSGACG00000014505) in stickleback. One lineagespecific tandem duplicate of aqp10a (aqp10aa:
ENSTNIG00000018340 and aqp10ab: ENSTNI
G00000018339) was also noted in green-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). Both aqp8aa, -8ab and
aqp10aa, -10ab genes are immediately juxtaposed in the
genomes of zebrafish (linkage group [LG] 12) and
green-spotted pufferfish (LG8), while the WGD products
aqp8b and aqp10b are each located on separate chromosomes, LG3 and LG3, respectively. Unfortunately, it
was not possible to characterize the complete aqp8 loci
in other teleosts due to the current location of stickleback aqp8ab on scaffold 211, and the absence of
aqp8aa, -8ab in green-sptotted pufferfish, and aqp8aa
and -8b in medaka (Oryzias latipes). For medaka, only
the aqp8ab gene was found on LG19. However, by comparing our data with the earlier study of Kasahara and

Page 6 of 18

colleagues [38], we were able to trace the ancestral chromosome that gave rise to aqp8 genes in humans and
teleosts. Despite multiple rearrangement, fusion and fission events, the major portions of all descendent LGs
that harbour vertebrate aqp8 genes can be traced to
protochromsome e. For humans this entails LG16, while
for Teleostei, the descendent chromosomes are LG2
(predicted locus of aqp8aa, -8ab) and LG3 (aqp8b) for
green-spotted pufferfish, LG19 (aqp8ab) and LG1 or
LG8 (predicted locus of aqp8b) for medaka. The chromosomal loci of aqp8 genes in stickleback and zebrafish
further support this ancient origin. Moreover, the early
divergence of teleost aqp8aa, -8ab and -8b is clearly evident in the trichotomous clustering of these transcripts
among diverse taxa (Figure 4), and further confirmed
through functional and expression analyses in zebrafish
(see below).
Similar ancestral reconstructions can be made for the
other linked aquaporins, wherein aqp1 genes descend
from protochromosome m, aqp0 originated on prototochromosome l, and aqp7 and -3 derive from protochromosomes l and i, respectively. In this latter instance,
aqp7 and -3 have remained linked in all vertebrata,
except the opossum (Monodelphis domestica), and thus
likely became colocalized prior to the separation of Sarcopterygii from Actinopterygii. The evidence supporting
this latter proposal lies in the observation that zebrafish
has maintained the linkage between aqp3b and -7 on
LG21, while aqp3a is located on LG5. Zebrafish LG5 is
the orthologon of stickleback LGXIII and medaka LG9,
both of which harbour the aqp3a orthologs. Hence the
single aqp7 gene found in teleost genomes is the surviving aqp7b product of WGD. The close linkage of teleost
aqp1a and -1b genes, suggests that they could have
arisen through tandem duplication. However, the fact
that all teleost genomes, except medaka, retain both isoforms, and that each shows dichotomous clustering in
the phylogenetic trees (Figure 4), their origin must be
close to, or coincident with the WGD event at the root
of the crown-clade. Hence, although we cannot exclude
a tandem duplication scenario suggested earlier [22], a
parsimonious explanation for the appearance or aqp1a
and -1b would seem to be WGD with subsequent colocalization, rather than local duplication and loss of
WGD paralogs. The divergence of these isoforms is
clearly evident in the phylogenetic trees, where aqp1b
transcripts display significantly longer branch lengths
compared to the aqp1a paralogs. This latter feature is
consistent with our earlier findings wherein Aqp1b is a
rapidly evolving channel protein with novel functions
specifically associated with oocyte hydration [17-22] and
osmoregulatory processes [16].
In a separate analysis of metazoan aquaporins (Finn
and Cerdà, unpublished data) we confirmed that aqp7,

-12 and -4 have remained single-copy genes in nonhuman vertebrates while the present data show that
Aqp11 duplicated at the root of the teleost crown-clade.
With the exception of torafugu (Takifugu rubripes),
which retains both aqp11a and -11b, Teleostei, including zebrafish, appear to have differentially retained alternate isoforms. This is clearly shown in the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 4), with closely related Protacanthopterygii
and Acanthomorpha harbouring opposite isoforms.
Based upon the more ancestral ostariophysan position
of zebrafish and the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), we arbitrarily assigned the zebrafish cluster as
the “b” variant.
Although zebrafish retains two isoforms of aqp3, these
genes proved the most difficult class of Glp to resolve
(Figure 5). Here we show the codon topology, which
also includes variants obtained from EST databases. By
specifically increasing the taxon sampling of these Glps,
we were able to resolve a branch topology that matched
the chromosomal loci of the teleost genes. As a result,
the genomic duplicates are annotated as “a” or “b”
accordingly. However, the protein trees did not always
corroborate the codon topology and therefore these
Glps will require further validation with the advent of
new sequence data. The placement of draqp5/1 as an
outgroup between aqp0 and -1 was consistent with its
hybrid status, while the AQP2, -5 and -6 genes are specific to the sarcopterygian lineage.
Molecular features of zebrafish aquaporins and functional
implications

The characteristic residues in a water channel that distinguish a true water facilitator from a Glp have previously been analyzed by comparing sequences of
aquaporins with known functions [39]. That comparison
resulted in the identification of five invariant or nearly
invariant residues (P1 to P5) in aquaporins and Glps on
the basis of 153 sequences ranging from bacteria to
humans (Figure 6A,B,D,E). However, structural and
functional studies of AQP1 and GlpF suggest the presence of two constriction sites in the water pore, in
addition to the P1-P5 residues, that underlie their high
selectivity and efficiency with regard to water or glycerol
transport [9,40-43] (Figure 1).
The first constriction is formed by the opposing NPA
motifs located at each positive end of a-helices 3 and 7
(on loops B and E; Figure 6A,B,D,E), such that the Asn
creates an electrostatic barrier in this region [44].
Together with desolvation, these regions are essential
for water transport specificity while excluding proton
transport [44]. Accordingly, Asn is the least variable in
aquaporin sequences whereas Pro and Ala are more
exchangeable [2,45]. The primary structure of zebrafish
aquaporins and Glps confirm these observations since

Page 9 of 18

Asn was conserved in both NPA boxes of all paralogs,
whereas Pro is substituted by Ala in the first box of
DrAqp7 as observed in human and rat AQP7 (Figure
6F). The third residue of the NPA boxes shows more
variation as previously found in over 450 aquaporinencoding genes [2]. In zebrafish, Ala is substituted by
Pro (first box of DrAqp8ab), Ser (first box in DrAqp8b),
Val (second box in DrAqp8b), or Thr (first and second
box in DrAqp3b, and DrAqp7 and -11b, respectively).
The second significant energy-barrier in aquaporins is
located close to the extracellular exit of the channel
forming the narrowest region of the pore and is referred
to as the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) constriction [46,47].
This region in water-selective aquaporins is formed by
four amino acids (Phe56 , His 180, Cys189 and Arg 195 in
human AQP1; Figure 6B,C,E,F) that create the hydrophobic and size filter [48]. The site sensitive to mercurial inhibition (Cys189 in AQP1) [11] is less conserved. In
contrast, in GlpF, and essentially in all other Glps, the
ar/R region is wider and more hydrophobic due to the
lack of His and substitution of the Cys by a second aromatic residue, which allows the passage of polyols and
urea, and possibly of other small solutes such as NH3,
CO2 or O2 [48].
The present data show that zebrafish aquaporins previously inferred to be water-selective or Glps after
amino acid sequence analysis retain the respective three
amino acid consensus in the ar/R constriction, and
show the P1-P5 residues conserved in each sub-family
(Figure 6 C,F). However, the Cys residue just prior to
the second NPA box, which is potentially mercury-sensitive, is maintained in DrAqp1a and -1b. Similarly,
DrAqp8aa, -8ab, -8b, -9a, -9b and -10a also show a Cys
upstream of the second NPA motif in loop B but at
slightly different positions. Despite these minor differences, the structural features of zebrafish aquaporins
strongly suggest that they encode functional channels. A
slightly different situation is found in DrAqp8aa, -8ab
and -8b, which despite having the conserved P1-P5 residues of the aquaporin subfamily, contain His instead of
Phe56, and Val or Ile instead of His180, in the ar/R constriction (Figure 6C). As for their mammalian counterparts, DrAqp11b and -12 appear to be more divergent
since they did not show any of the typical residues in
the ar/R constriction and only three aquaporin-conserved amino acids (P2, P4 and P5) (data not shown).
Water and solute permeability of zebrafish aquaporins

Typically, aquaporin water-channel activity is tested by
the oocyte-swelling assay [3], in which Xenopus laevis
oocytes expressing aquaporins are exposed to hypoosmotic shock and the subsequent water influx is measured by determining volume changes over time. Solute
permeability can also be determined volumetrically in

isotonic solutions, or by employing radiolabeled compounds [49,50]. Therefore, to determine experimentally
the substrate specificity of the zebrafish aquaporins, the
cloned cDNAs were expressed in X. laevis oocytes.
Expression of all of the aquaporin isoforms, except
draqp11b and -12, induced a three- to twenty-fold
increase in oocyte water permeability (Figure 7). Interestingly, however, water permeability of oocytes expressing draqp3a and -3b was reduced by acidic pH, as
found for mammalian AQP3 [51] and European eel
(Anguilla anguilla) Aqp3 [52], with maximum permeability occurring at pH 8.5. Swelling (data not shown)
and isotope-labeled solute uptake assays demonstrated
that oocytes injected with draqp3a, -3b, -7, -9a, -9b,
-10a and -10b were also permeable to glycerol and urea,
although in the case of draqp10b urea permeability was
low (Figure 7). Oocytes expressing draqp8aa or -8ab
were permeable to water and urea, but not glycerol. In
contrast, oocytes expressing draqp0a, -0b, -1a, -1b and
-4, as well as draqp8b, were not permeable to either of
these solutes.
Water and glycerol transport through most aquaporins
was significantly (p < 0.01) blocked by 0.3 mM HgCl2
even in the absence of Cys189 in their deduced amino
acid sequences (Figure 6C,F). Such inhibition was not
always reversed with the reducing agent b-mercaptoethanol. However, DrAqp4 (as in mammalian AQP4)
and DrAqp8b were mercury-insensitive, even though
DrAqp8b has a potential mercury-sensitive Cys
upstream of the second NPA box (Figure 6C). It thus
appears that water and solute flux through zebrafish
aquaporins can be blocked by mercurial compounds
regardless of the presence or absence of Cys189. These
observations have also been noted for rat AQP3 [53,54]
and plant aquaporins [55,56]. The present findings suggest that sensitivity of zebrafish aquaporins to mercurials is a complex phenomenon, as has been suggested
for other aquaporins, and may involve other residues in
addition to Cys189 [56].
Expression of draqp11b or -12 had no effect on oocyte
water (Figure 7), or glycerol (data not shown) permeability. The absence of water and solute transport in X.
laevis oocytes expressing mammalian AQP11 and -12
has been previously reported [57,58]. For AQP12, this
seems to be caused by the absence of protein expression
in the oocyte plasma membrane [57], but in the case of
AQP11 the protein is readily targeted to the plasma
membrane [58]. The underlying mechanisms involved in
the functional failure of AQP11 and -12 in oocytes are
not well known, but may be related to the fact that
these aquaporins are localized intracellularly in vivo
[57,59]. However, when AQP11 was reconstituted into
liposomes this protein proved to be a functional water
channel [60]. Although the identity of DrAqp11b and

The Pf was assayed in the presence or absence of HgCl2 and bmercaptoethanol (ME). Values (mean ± SEM; n = 8-10 oocytes) with
an asterisk are significantly (p < 0.01) different from water-injected
oocytes in a representative experiment.

-12 with AQP11 and -12 is low (35% and 38% identity,
respectively), a similar situation may be speculated in
zebrafish. Further studies employing reconstitution of
DrAqp11b and -12 into proteoliposomes, as well as specific antibodies to elucidate their subcellular localization,
would help to clarify this issue.
Expression pattern of zebrafish aquaporins

The relative expression of the zebrafish aquaporin genes
in adult tissues was evaluated by RT-PCR employing

Tingaud-Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/38

isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers (Figure 8).
These data revealed that while all genes except draqp5/
1 were expressed, some aquaporin transcripts were ubiquitiously distributed in the tissues examined or
appeared to be tissue-specific. Notably, mRNAs derived
from duplicated paralogs showed slightly different
expression patterns, although redundancy in some tissues was also observed.

Page 12 of 18

Only two zebrafish aquaporin transcripts (draqp1a
and -12) showed tissue-wide expression patterns. The
ubiquitous expression of draqp1a transcripts is consistent with the presence of the mammalian AQP1 ortholog in endothelial barriers of almost all tissues and in
many epithelia [61]. Its presence in the zebrafish gastrointestinal tract and gills agrees with that reported in
other teleosts [12,15,16,62]. In contrast, expression of

transcripts. PCR on genomic DNA was used as control. Minus indicates absence of RT during cDNA synthesis. The size (kb) of PCR products and

the presence or absence of the aquaporin transcripts in the different tissues is shown to the lower right.

Tingaud-Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/38

draqp1b was restricted to the ovary, testis and brain, as
previously reported [22]. The ubiquitous expression of
the unorthodox aquaporin draqp12, with lower levels in
the eye and muscle, differs markedly from the exclusive
expression of mammalian AQP12 in the pancreatic acinar cells [57] and the retina [63]. The vertebrate-specific
unorthodox aquaporin, draqp11b, also showed a different expression pattern compared to that described for
mammalian AQP11. In mice, kidney expression of
AQP11 seems to be essential during development since
either its absence or mutations of the amino acid
sequence induce renal failure [59,64]. In our PCR
experiments, however, we could not observe detectable
levels of draqp11b transcripts in the kidney, although
they were abundantly expressed in the gut and were
also detected in ovary and liver.
In contrast to draqp1a and -12, transcripts of draqp0a
and -8b were exclusively detected in tissues of the eye
and brain, respectively, and draqp0b was also observed
in the ovary. The specific expression of draqp0 paralogs
in the eye is consistent with that previously described in
the common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus)
[65,66], as well as in mammals where AQP0 is predominantly present in fibre cells of the lens [67]. Expression
of draqp8b was noted only in the brain, where draqp8aa
and -8ab were not expressed. In contrast, these latter
transcripts were abundantly expressed in the gut and
kidney, draqp8ab mRNA being also present in the
ovary, testis, eye, gills and liver. The diffuse expression
of draqp8aa and -8ab resembles that found for mammalian AQP8, which is present in the testis, ovary, kidney, liver, pancreas, small intestine and colon [1,68].
The expression of draqp4 is similar to that of mammalian AQP4 [1], which is distributed in the brain, small
intestine and muscle, but also in kidney. In the present
study, however, we did not detect draqp4 transcripts in
the zebrafish kidney.
The distribution of classical Glp mRNAs in zebrafish
was comparable to that described for mammals and
some teleosts [69,70]. draqp3a showed the most extensive distribution in all tissues examined except in the
liver, showing high abundance in gills as previously
found for other teleosts [14,15]. In contrast, draqp3b
transcripts were seen only in the testis, gills, muscle and
skin. The draqp9a and -9b isoforms, as well as
draqp10a and -10b, also showed differential expression
in some tissues. The expression of two functional isoforms of draqp10 in zebrafish, however, differs from
that reported for mouse in which AQP10 was suggested
to be a pseudogene [71]. As in mammals, draqp7 is
expressed in the gonads and the kidney, while the
expression observed in the intestine may reflect an adipocyte function [72,73].

Page 13 of 18

The RT-PCR studies suggest that redundant expression of duplicated aquaporin isoforms occurs in many
tissues of zebrafish. The physiological significance of
these findings is intriguing. In other teleosts, such as the
gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), redundant expression of aqp1a (saaqp1a) and -1b (saaqp1b) in the ovary
and gastrointestinal tract is also observed, but immunological studies have revealed that their protein products
are differentially localized [16,17]. Thus, in the ovary
SaAqp1b is oocyte-specific, whereas SaAqp1a seems to
be only present in the external epithelium surrounding
the ovarian follicle. In the gut, SaAqp1b is exclusively
detected at the apical membrane of rectal enterocytes,
whereas SaAqp1a is localized at the brush border of
enterocytes in the duodenum and hindgut. Therefore,
the significance of the redundant aquaporin expression
in zebrafish must be further investigated by determining
the subcellular sites of transcription and protein
targeting.

Conclusions
In this study, we identified a large number of MIP
encoding genes in zebrafish when compared to tetrapods. By integrating the molecular phylogeny and the
genomic loci with structural and functional analyses we
demonstrate dual- or tri-paralogy between teleost aquaporins and human orthologs. Consequently teleost aquaporins can be classified into the same water-selective
and Glp subfamilies previously described in vertebrates
[2]. Expression in X. laevis oocytes also demonstrated
that zebrafish aquaporin genes, except aqp11b and -12,
encode functional channels, which in most cases have
retained the substrate specificity of the tetrapod counterparts. Some mammalian aquaporins are also permeable to NH 3 , CO 2 or O2 [74], but whether any of the
zebrafish orthologs are permeable to these compounds
remains to be investigated.
The high number of aquaporin genes in zebrafish and
other teleosts result from WGD at the root of the
crown-clade. Most duplicated isoforms are retained,
while aqp4, -7, and -12 have remained single-copy genes
in non-human vertebrates. The findings further reveal
that tandem duplication has occurred within the clade
and in a lineage-specific manner, but such intrachromosomal replication events are rare for this superfamily.
While most of the duplicated genes seem to be conserved during the diversification of teleosts, some such
as aqp11, -3 and -8 appear to have been differentially
retained among species. The reasons for the evolutionary selection of specific aquaporin isoforms in teleosts,
as well as the potential neofunctionalization of others,
as shown for aqp1b in the hydrating oocytes of marine
teleosts [17,22], have yet to be determined.

Tingaud-Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:38

An interesting finding was that zebrafish harbours a
hybrid gene with partial structural identity to the tetrapod AQP2, AQP5 and AQP6 orthologs. This hybrid
sequence is not expressed, and it appears to represent a
pseudogene. The physiological significance of this observation remains to be elucidated. The present study,
however, provides a validated nomenclature for the piscine aquaporin superfamily and lays the foundation for
further functional studies in zebrafish.

Methods
Fish

Adult zebrafish were purchased from local pet stores
and maintained as described [75]. To obtain samples of
the different tissues, fish were sedated by immersion for
approximately 15 min in 80-100 ppm phenoxyethanol,
and sacrificed by decapitation. Tissue samples were
immediately processed for RNA extraction or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Procedures
relating to the care and use of animals were approved
by the Ethics Committee from IRTA in accordance with
the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Genome and transcript analysis

Zebrafish aquaporin coding sequences were identified by
basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [76] homology searches of the NCBI [37] and ensembl [32] databases with mammalian and previously cloned teleost
aquaporin sequences. The predicted amino acid
sequences were extracted, analyzed using BLASTP, and
annotated according to the nomenclature established for
zebrafish [30]. Intron-exon splicing sites were verified
visually using available cDNA sequences and/or corresponding ESTs, and genomic sequences. Potential transmembrane helices in the encoded amino acid sequences
were predicted using the SOSUI engine v1.11 [77],
TMHMM Server v2.0 [78] and Phobius [79], or via
molecular wraps to resolved aquaporin structures (Additional file 5).

for 1.5 h at 42°C. For amplification, PCR was carried
out with 1 μl of the synthesized cDNA and specific oligonucleotide primers designed according to the available cDNAs and genomic sequences. The PCR
reactions were conducted using a total volume of 50 μl
containing 1x reaction buffer supplemented with 1.5
mM MgCl 2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 mM of each forward
and reverse primer, and 1U of Easy-ATM High-Fidelity
PCR Cloning Enzyme (Stratagene). The PCR conditions were an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 36 cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 60-65°C for 1
min (depending on the Tm of each primer pair), and
72°C for 1 min. A final elongation cycle at 72°C for 7
min was carried out in all cases. The products were
cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and
both strands sequenced by BigDye Terminator v3.1
cycle sequencing on ABI PRISM 377 DNA analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). The deduced amino acid
sequences of cloned cDNAs were 100% identical to
those available in the databases, except for DrAqp7
and -11b, which were 98% identical (3 and 2 amino
acid changes, respectively), and the cDNAs encoding
DrAqp8aa, -8ab, -9b, -10a and -12, which were 99%
identical (1 amino acid change in each sequence). In
further structural and phylogenetic analyses we used
the amino acid sequences derived from the cDNAs
cloned in this study since they were found to encode
functional proteins in oocytes.
Functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes

Zebrafish aquaporin full-length cDNAs were cloned into
the EcoRV/SpeI sites of the oocyte expression vector
pT7Ts [80]. Capped RNAs (cRNAs) were synthesized in
vitro with T7 RNA Polymerase (Roche) from XbaI-linearized pT7Ts vector containing the different aquaporin
cDNAs. The isolation and microinjection of stage V-VI
oocytes was performed as described previously [80].
Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of distilled water
(negative control) or 50 nl of water solution containing
1-10 ng cRNA.

cDNA Cloning

Swelling assays

In this study, cDNAs bearing the complete coding
region of draqp0a, -0b, -3a, -3b, -4, -7, -8aa, -8ab, -8b,
-9a, -9b, -10a, -10b, -11b, and -12 were cloned by conventional RT-PCR. Full-length draqp1a and -1b
cDNAs were previously isolated [17,22]. Total RNA
was extracted from the kidney, gut, gills, liver, brain
and ovary of adult fish using the RNeasy Maxikit (Qiagen) followed by DNase treatment following the manufacturer’s instructions. A pool of 1-10 μg total RNA
from the different tissues was reverse transcribed using
0.5 μg oligo (dT)17, 1 mM dNTPs, 40 IU RNAse inhibitor (Roche), and 10 IU MMLuV-RT enzyme (Roche),

The osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured from
the time course of oocyte swelling in a standard assay.
Oocytes were transferred from 200 mOsm modified
Barth’s culture medium (MBS; 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.4
mM CaCl 2 , 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 2.4 mM
NaHCO3, 10 mM Hepes, 0.82 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5) to
20 mOsm MBS at room temperature. Oocyte swelling
was followed by video microscopy using serial images at
2 s intervals during the first 20 s period. For Draqp3a
and -3b, the swelling assays were performed at pH 8.5.
The Pf values were calculated taking into account the
time-course changes in relative oocyte volume [d(V/Vo)/

Tingaud-Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:38

dt], the molar volume of water (Vw = 18 cm3/ml) and
the oocyte surface area (S) using the formula V o[d(V/
Vo)/dt]/[SVw(Osmin - Osmout)]. To examine the inhibitory effect of mercury on Pf, oocytes were pre-incubated
for 15 min in MBS containing 0.5 or 0.3 mM HgCl 2
before and during the swelling assays. To determine the
reversibility of the inhibition, the oocytes were rinsed 3
times with fresh MBS and incubated for another 15 min
with 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol before being subjected to
swelling assays.
Radioactive solute uptake assays

To determine the uptake of [3H]glycerol (60 Ci/mmol)
and [ 14 C]urea (52 mCi/mmol) groups of 10 oocytes,
injected with water or cRNA, were incubated in 200 μl
of MBS containing 20 μCi of the radiolabeled solute
(cold solute was added to give 1 mM final concentration) at room temperature. After 10 min (including zero
time for subtraction of the signal from externally bound
solute), oocytes were washed rapidly in ice-cold MBS
three times, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 5%
SDS for scintillation counting.
Statistical analysis of Pf and solute uptake

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. The data shown are
from a representative experiment out of 3-4 different
trials producing similar results. The measured values of
Pf, and glycerol and urea uptake were statistically analyzed in an unpaired Student’s t test; p values < 0.01
were considered significantly different.
Gene expression analysis

Total RNA was extracted from different tissues, ovary,
testis, brain, eye, gills, anterior intestine, midgut, posterior intestine, kidney, liver, muscle and skin, of 5-10
adult fish using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). An aliquot of RNA (500 ng) was treated with Turbo-DNase
(Ambion) and reverse transcribed as described above.
PCR was carried out with 0.3-0.6 μl of cDNA employing Tfi DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and aquaporin
isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers (Additional
file 6). For each aquaporin nucleotide sequence, the
oligos were designed to flank one or separated introns
that were complementary to non-conserved regions
among aquaporin paralogs. The reactions were carried
out in a 25 μl volume containing 1x reaction buffer,
1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 mM of each primer and 1U of Tfi polymerase. The PCR conditions
were as described above except for the number of the
cycles, which was increased to 40. As a reference gene
to control the variation in mRNA concentration, zebrafish b-actin1 (drbactin1) was used, employing PCR
conditions of 22 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1
min, and 72°C for 1 min. Amplification of genomic

Page 15 of 18

DNA (500 ng), purified from liver, was used as a positive control using the same PCR conditions but with
an elongation step of 1 min per kb. An aliquot of the
PCR reactions was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels
containing ethidium bromide and the products were
visualized and photographed.
Phylogenetic analysis

Orthologs of the aquaporin superfamily were obtained
from public GenBanks via entrez and BLAST and identified via BLASTP, BLASTN or BLAT from ensembl
[32] and the ghost shark (Callorhinchus milii) [81] genome databases. Construction of aquaporin amino acid
multiple sequence alignments was achieved using the tcoffee v7.54 suite of tools [82] and ClustalX [83]. Each
amino acid alignment was converted to a codon alignment (nucleotide triplets) as described previously [20]
and manually adjusted to correct errors using MacVector (MacVector Inc, Cambridge, UK). Three-dimensional alignments of each zebrafish amino acid sequence
against crystallographically resolved aquaporin molecules
(Additional file 5) were used to identify conserved secondary structures in order to minimize gaps in the ahelical regions. Three-dimensional protein wraps were
rendered using Cn3D [37] as described previously [24].
Identity and similarity matrices were calculated using
MacVector.
Preliminary Bayesian analyses (Mr Bayes v3.1.2; [84])
were run for all sequences, and identical predictions
pruned from the alignments. Where possible GenBank
sequences were run with predicted variants to validate
the latter. Prior to phylogenetic analyses, the alignments
were trimmed to remove unrelated N- and C-terminal
regions. To determine the influence of lesser-conserved
regions, large gap regions were removed and these alignments tested via Bayesian analyses. This resulted in
shorter branch lengths, and an increased incidence of
polytomies, but no significant change to the tree
topologies.
Each data set was modeled primarily via Bayesian, but
also via maximum likelihood or maximum parsimony
methods of phylogenetic inference as described previously
[20]. Neighbor joining (NJ) methods were used for efficient identification of orthologs. Tree topologies were
accepted after validating convergence using Tracer [85]
and when the codon and protein tree topologies were congruent. For Bayesian analyses the following settings were
used for codon alignments: nucmodel = 4by4, nst = 2,
rates = gamma; and amino acid alignments: aamodel =
mixed, with 1,000,000 generations, sampled every 100 generations using 4 chains and a burnin of 3,500. For each
run, a majority rule consensus tree together with posterior
probabilities from the last 6,500 trees, representing
650,000 generations was arranged using Archeopteryx [86]

and subsequently rendered with Geneious Pro (Biomatters
Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Maximum likelihood codon
trees were attained using PAUP v4b10 (Sinauer Associates
Inc.) and rendered using FigTree v2.2 [87]. Final trees
were annotated with accession numbers using Adobe
Photoshop.
