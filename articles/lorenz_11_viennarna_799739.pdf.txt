Abstract
Background: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of description of nucleic acids that
encapsulates the dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used
as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact
dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as
thermodynamic properties.
Results: The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related
computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the
Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants
prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New
features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of
structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures
derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in
fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core
algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.
Conclusions: The ViennaRNA Package 2.0, supporting concurrent computations via OpenMP, can be
downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.

Background
A typical single stranded-nucleic acid molecule has the
propensity to form double helical structures causing the
molecule to fold back onto itself. Simple rules of complementary base pairing govern this process, which
results in a regular pattern of Watson-Crick and GU
pairings (helices) and intervening stretches of less regularly ordered nucleotides (loops), collectively known as
the molecule’s secondary structure. Secondary structure
elements may be placed in close spatial proximity allowing additional non-covalent interactions. These are not
as frequent and often are energetically less favorable
compared to canonical base pairs, thus rendering the 3dimensional tertiary structure of an RNA to be dominated by the underlying scaffold of the secondary structure. The canonical base pairing governs not only the
thermodynamics but also the folding kinetics, which can

be approximated as a hierarchical process in which secondary structure is formed before tertiary structure [1].
The dominance of base pairing and the confinement
to a single interaction partner makes it possible to
model RNA (and DNA) secondary structures at a purely
combinatorial level, completely ignoring both atom-scale
details and spatial embeddings. Formally, an RNA secondary structure is a (labeled) graph whose nodes represent nucleotides. The edge set contains edges between
consecutive nodes (i, i + 1) representing the phosphate
backbone as well as edges between base pairs. For the
latter, the following conditions must hold:
1. base pair edges are formed only between nucleotides that form Watson-Crick or GU base pairs;
2. no two base pair edges emanate from the same
vertex, i.e., a secondary structure is a matching;
3. base pair edges span at least three unpaired bases;
4. if the vertices are placed in 5’ to 3’ order on the
circumference of a circle and edges are drawn as
straight lines, no two edges cross.

The last condition ensures that the graph is outerplanar and therefore excludes so-called pseudo-knots.
Matching problems usually have cost functions determined by edge-weights. The earliest predictions of RNA
secondary structures in the early 1970s indeed used
such simple energy models [2]. Detailed melting experiments, however, soon showed that a different, more
complex type of energy function is necessary to properly
model the thermodynamics of nucleic acid structures.
Instead of individual base pairs, the energy contributions
are dominated by base-pair stacking and the destabilizing entropic effects of unpaired “loops”. Sequencedependent energy parameters for these building blocks
contribute to a very good approximation additively to
the folding energy [3]. Over the last two decades, this
additive standard energy model has been repeatedly
refined and updated, see e.g. [4-9].
The RNA folding problem is solvable by means of
dynamic programming. The simplest version, known as
maximum circular matching problem, accounts for base
pairing energies only [10,11]. In the early 1980s Nussinov and Jacobson [12] and Michael Zuker with collaborators [13,14] demonstrated that the loop-based
energy model is also amenable to the same algorithmic
ideas. Their work made computational RNA structure
prediction accurate and efficient enough for practical
use, resulting in the first versions of mfold. A decade
later, John McCaskill realized that the dynamic programming recursions can be adapted to compute the
partition function of an equilibrium ensemble of RNA
molecules [15], paving the way for efficient computational access to accurate thermodynamic modelling
without exceeding an asymptotic time complexity of
O(n3 ) .
The secondary structure model of RNA perfectly fits
together with modern genomics and transcriptomics
since it works at the same level of abstraction, treating
nucleotides as basic entities. With the increasing availability of RNA sequence data, and the realization that
many of the functional RNAs have evolutionary wellconserved secondary structures, many research groups
developed a plethora of specialized tools for various
aspects of RNA bioinformatics. As an alternative to the
direct measurement of thermodynamic parameters, for
instance, machine learning approaches employing stochastic context free grammars (SCFG) were introduced
e.g. in the infernal suite [16,17]. The algorithmic
work horses of the SCFG approach, the Cocke-YoungerKasami (CYK), the inside and the outside algorithms,
are also dynamic programming schemes. They are, in
fact, very close cousins of the minimum free energy and
partition function folding algorithms. The contrafold
tools in fact recently bridged the apparent gap between

Page 2 of 14

the thermodynamic and the machine learning approach
to RNA bioinformatics proposing to learn a parameter
set for a SCFG that structurally matches the standard
energy model [18].
Several other tools implement dynamic programming
based RNA secondary structures prediction: UNAfold
[19] is the successor of the original mfold program and
adds suppport for predicting RNA-RNA hybridization.
RNAstructure [20] started as a reimplementation of
mfold with a graphical user interface in Windows, but
is now available for other platforms and has added several additional algorithms such as partition function
folding and suboptimal structures. The NUPACK suite
[21] focuses on folding of several interacting RNA
strands and design problems. The group around Kiyoshi
Asai developed several tools focusing the usage of centroid and maximum expected accuracy (MEA) estimators, see e.g. [22]. Ye Ding’s Sfold program [23] was
the first to introduce stochastic structure sampling. The
group around Robert Giegerich provides several RNA
related tools, notably the RNAshapes [24] program.
The Vienna RNA Package [25] has its roots in a
series of large-scale simulation studies aiming at an
understanding of adaptive evolution on rugged fitness
landscapes [26-28] and the statistical properties of the
sequence-structure relationships of RNA [29-31] rather
than the detailed analysis of individual RNA molecules
of biological interest. The primary design goals for its
implementation in the early 1990s, therefore, were twofold. First and foremost, the basic folding algorithms
were to be implemented so as to be as efficient as possible in their usage of both CPU and memory resources.
The core algorithms are accessible as a C library, which
later on was also equipped with Perl bindings to facilitate interoperability with this commonly used scripting
language. Secondly, the interactive programs were to be
used mostly in (shell-script) pipelines, hence they use a
simple command-line interface and, where possible, they
read from and write to a stream. This feature made it
easy to construct a suite of web services [32] providing
easy access to most functionalities of the Vienna RNA
Package. With the rising tide of first genomics and
then transcriptomics data, the need for both efficient
implementation and easy incorporation into pipelines
remained, even though the focus gradually shifted from
large-scale simulation to large-scale data analysis. Little
has changed in the core folding algorithms in the 17
years since the first publication [25] of the package. On
the other hand, a variety of variants have been included
such as consensus structure prediction from alignments
or scanning versions capable of dealing with local structures in genome-scale data sets. The systematic overhaul
of the Vienna RNA Package documented here was

Lorenz et al. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 2011, 6:26
http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26

largely triggered by the publication of improved parametrizations of the energy model, which affected nearly
every component in the library, and by the progress in
computer technology, which led to the widespread
deployment of shared-memory multi-core processors. In
order to exploit these hardware features a restructuring
of the RNA library to make it thread-safe and hence fit
for use in concurrent computations was required.
Beyond these technical improvements, the Vienna RNA
Package 2.0 features a number of additions to its
algorithmic repertoire, an improved API to RNAlib,
and an expanded toolkit of auxiliary programs.
Interactive tools

Since its first release, the ViennaRNA Package
included interactive command-line tools which enable
users to access the high performance implementations
of the algorithms via a command-line interface. To
ensure scalability of the use-cases all programs were
developed with the objective of handling input- and output-streams, facilitating their integration into UNIX
pipes. Thus pre- and post-processing of the input/output
data can proceed without the need of intermediate
input- or output-files. Most programs of the ViennaRNA Package furthermore are able to operate in
batch mode, handling large sets of input data with a single call. By default, the programs of the ViennaRNA
Package generate an output that is meant to be easily
parsable while keeping it human-readable.
The core of the package provides several variants of
the RNA folding recursion: energy minimization, partition function and base pairing probabilities, backtracing
of suboptimal structures, alignment-based as well as
scanning versions. The decision whether a certain functionality is implemented as a separate stand alone program or as an optional command-line switch is based
on the compatibility of I/O formats and internal data
structures. Table 1 presents the implemented model variants as well as the data formats for each program,
whereas Figure 1 illustrates example program calls
together with their corresponding output. In the following paragraphs, we provide a comprehensive summary
of programs included in the ViennaRNA Package.
Folding

The main secondary structure prediction tool is RNAfold, which computes the minimum free energy (MFE)
and backtraces an optimal secondary structure. Using
the -p option, RNAfold also uses McCaskill’s algorithm [15] to compute the partition function, the matrix
of base pairing probabilities, and the centroid structure.
The RNAfold output is a string representation of the
structure and the folding energy written to the standard
output stream. With the -p option, it also creates a

Page 3 of 14

PostScript file containing the base pairing probability
matrix. Circular RNA sequences are rare in nature and
appear infrequently in practical applications. With the
–circ option this case is handled as a post-processing
for the forward recursion and a preprocessing of the
backward recursions without compromising the performance of the folding algorithms for linear RNAs [33].
Constraints can be supplied to the folding algorithms
enforcing that individual positions are paired, unpaired,
or paired with specific partners.
The program RNAsubopt can be used to generate
suboptimal structures. Using command-line options, it
can switch between three different ways of generating
them: by default, it generates the complete set of suboptimal structures within a certain energy band, the size of
which can be chosen using the -e option [34]. With the
-p option it uses stochastic backtracking [35] from the
partition function to generate a Boltzmann-weighted
random sample of structures, effectively providing the
functionality of sfold [23]. Finally, the -z option generates suboptimal secondary structures according to
Zuker’s algorithm [36]. The resulting set consists, for
each basepair (i, j) that can be formed by the input
structure, of the energetically most favorable structure
that contains the (i, j)-pair. This option implements a
feature that has been used frequently in applications of
the mfold package.
RNALfold [37] is a “scanning” version of the folding
programs that can be used to calculate local stable substructures of very long RNA molecules. Local in this
context means that the sequence interval spanned by a
base pair is limited by a user-defined upper bound (set
by the -L option). Scanning versions of RNA folding
programs conceptutally perform computations for all
sequence-windows of a fixed size. Algorithmically, they
are faster than the naïve approach by re-using partial
results for overlapping windows. RNALfold does not
come with a partition function version because the global partition function with restricted base pair span is of
limited interest in practical applications. Instead, a separate program, RNAplfold [38], computes the base
pairing probability averaged over all sequence windows
that contain the putative pair. This tool can also be
used to compute the local accessibilities, i.e., the probabilities that sequence intervals are single-stranded in
thermodynamic equilibrium (option -a).
RNA2Dfold [39] implements energy minimization,
partition function computations, and stochastic backtracing for the two dimensional projection of the secondary
structure space that is defined by the base pair distances
from the two prescribed reference structures. The
restricted ensembles of secondary structures are useful
in particular for tracing refolding pathways and to compute lower bounds of energy barriers between

alternative conformations of an RNA molecule.
Although RNA2Dfold is based upon the usual dynamic
programming recursion of energy-directed folding, the
asymptotic time complexity is multiplied by a factor of
k2 · l2, where k and l are maximum base pair distances

to the first and the second reference structure, resp.
Hence, the overall time complexity for a sequence of
length n is O(n7 ) . The memory requirements of O(n4 )
are also higher than for the regular secondary structure
prediction scheme. However, since the implementation

Lorenz et al. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 2011, 6:26
http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26

uses a sparse matrix approach, the prefactor of time and
memory complexity is very small, making the program
applicable for RNA sequence lengths of up to about 400
- 600 nt.
RNA-RNA interactions

Several programs focus on various aspects of the hybridization structure of two RNA molecules, using different
levels of detail. The programs RNAcofold [40] and
RNAup [41] are two complementary programs with the
highest level of detail available within the ViennaRNA
Package. RNAup first computes local opening energies
for both molecules and then computes interaction energies, looking for the best interaction site of two molecules. RNAcofold, on the other hand, concatenates
two molecules and computes a common secondary
structure using modified energies for the loop that contains the cut. RNAcofold thus can generate arbitrary
many binding sites, but does not allow pseudoknotted
configurations, while RNAup covers only a single interaction site, which however may form a complex pseudoknotted configuration. The partition function version of
RNAcofold can be used to investigate the concentration dependency of dimerization, similar to [42]. On the
other hand, RNAup is mostly geared towards investigations of the binding of regulatory RNA molecules with
their target RNAs.
RNAPKplex is at present the only component of the
Vienna RNA Package that explicitly predicts pseudoknotted RNA structures [43]. As an “intramolecular variant” of RNAup it computes accessibilities and then
identifies regions that can form stable base pairs.
Although optimized for speed, the full-fledged folding
algorithms are not fast enough for genome-wide applications. RNAduplex, similar to Rehmsmeier’s RNAhybrid [44], ignores intramolecular structures and all
multi-branch loops in its search for thermodynamically
favorable interaction regions. RNAplex [45] achieves a
massive gain in speed by simplifying the energy model
for interior loops to an affine gap cost model, effectively
reducing the folding problem to a variant of local
sequence alignment. The accuracy of this approach can
be further improved by reading in accessibilities (as
computed by RNAplfold) and incorporating them into
the scoring model [46].
The specialized programs RNAsnoop [47] for the prediction of target sites of H/ACA snoRNAs, and RNALfoldz [48] for the evaluation of predicted local
secondary structures, use SVMs to further classify the
output of the RNA folding routines.
Consensus structures and alignments

A central issue for the comparative analysis of RNA
sequences is the computation of a consensus structure.

Page 6 of 14

Starting from a sequence alignment, this can be
achieved using the same algorithmic framework as folding a single sequence. More precisely, energy contributions can be added up in a columnwise manner to yield
an effective energy model for the alignment as a whole
[49]. The Vienna RNA Package provides alignmentbased variants for several of the algorithms discussed
above: RNAalifold [50] computes global consensus
structures both in MFE and partition function mode, a
scanning version of long sequence alignments is RNALalifold. RNAaliduplex is designed to facility the
search for conserved RNA-RNA interaction sites in
large alignment data sets. The alidot program [51,52],
finally, extracts local conserved structures given a
sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions
for each of the aligned sequences. By default, consensus
structure prediction is dominated by the thermodynamic
parameters and sequence covariation. Thus, phylogenetic support for conservation of secondary structure is
included only as a small bonus energy term. A much
more sophisticated substitution model for paired regions
based on the RIBOSUM scoring scheme [53] can be
invoked with the -R option.
The Vienna RNA Package does not contain its own
optimized implementation for the simultaneous folding
and alignment of two RNA sequences, i.e., of the Sankoff algorithm [54]. We refer to the well-established software tools FoldAlign [55], or DynAlign [56] for this
task. A simplified version of the Sankoff algorithm
underlies pmcomp [57,58], a facility to align pre-computed base-pairing probability matrices, although this
tool is now included mostly for backward compatibility.
An improved and much more efficient implementation
is provided by the locarna package [59] developed in
cooperation with Rolf Backofen and Sebastian Will and
distributed separately.
With RNApaln and RNApdist the package also provides tools to align and compare base pair probability
patterns using modified string alignment algorithms.
Tree editing distances and corresponding pairwise alignments can be computed with RNAdist.
Miscellaneous tools

Concerning sequence design, we ship the program
RNAinverse [25]. It generates a sequence that folds
into the input structure by mutating a start sequence.
More efficient versions of inverse folding algorithms
have become available over the last decade, see e.g.
INFO-RNA [60], RNA Designer [61] and the recent
NUPACK design algorithms [62]. Nevertheless, RNAinverse remains useful for some applications as it is
designed for search for solutions as close as possible to
the starting sequence. RNAswitch [63] takes a pair of
secondary structures as input and finds a sequence that

Lorenz et al. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 2011, 6:26
http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26

has both input structures as near ground states. The
possibility to design bistable RNAs may be useful e.g.
for synthetic biology.
A closer look at the dynamics of RNA folding a available through kinfold [64], a rejectionless Monte
Carlo simulation algorithm generating trajectories of
subsequent secondary structures. Kinetic information
can also be obtained from the exhaustive enumeration
of suboptimal structures using RNAsubopt in conjunction with the barriers package [64,65]. The latter is
not restricted to RNA landscapes and hence distributed
separately from the Vienna RNA Package.
Auxiliary Programs

In addition to the prediction and analysis tools, the
ViennaRNA Package provides utility programs and
scripts that mainly assist in processing input- and output data. RNAeval computes the energy of a given
structure formed by a given sequence and can in particular be used to re-compute energies for a given pair of
sequence and structure with different energy models.
The Perl script refold.pl generates single structure
predictions using a previously computed consensus
structure as constraint.
RNAplot can be used to generate a graphical representation of the an input sequence/structure pair [66].
Several Perl scripts can be used to further manipulate
PostScript output produced by the various components
of the Vienna RNA Package. Conventional structure
drawings can be rotated with rotate_ss.pl. The
relplot.pl script includes reliability annotation into
secondary structure plots, colorrna.pl uses the conservation of alignments for coloring consensus structure
plots, while coloraln.pl does the same with an
alignment. Mountain plots can be produced with mountain.pl and cmount.pl from single and consensus
structures, respectively.
Many tools in RNA bioinformatics use mfold’s “connectivity” (.ct) file format. The dot-bracket representation used consistently by the Vienna RNA Package
can converted into this format using b2ct and ct2b.
pl, resp.
The ViennaRNA Webserver

The ViennaRNA Webserver [32] facilitates an easy to
use form based web browser interface to most of the
programs included in the ViennaRNA Package and additional tools. It combines the call of the appropriate command-line tools with post-processing steps to obtain a
visualization of the output. The webtools echo the command-lines used to call components of the Vienna
RNA Package; this feature can be used to get more
familiar with the individual tools. The webserver also
provides an interface to the barriers and treekin

Page 7 of 14

program allowing the analysis of folding landscapes and
structural refolding kinetics. The backbone of the
ViennaRNA Webserver has been upgraded so that all
calculations with the webserver profit from the
increased performance of the new ViennaRNA
Package.
Modifying the energy parameters of the model

The energy model implemented in ViennaRNA Package 2.0 follows the structure of the Turner 2004
energy parameters as described in [9] with a few very
minor deviations. Compared to previous parametrizations, the Turner 2004 model introduced additional
look-up tables for certain free energies and for loop
entropies in response to more precise measurements of
certain loop types. For the sake of computational efficiency a few peculiar rules were deliberately ignored,
however. Details on these discrepancies, which do not
affect the overall accuracy of predictions (see below), are
provided in the appendix.
All programs of the ViennaRNA Package can read
in energy parameters from a human-readable text file
allowing the user to replace the default Turner 2004
parameter set. This can either be a user-supplied parameter file or one of several parameter compilations that
are shipped with the package. Of particular interest are
parameters for DNA folding. Here we provide a parameter set compiled by Douglas Turner and David Mathews [67] from published data, incorporating in particular
earlier work by the group of John SantaLucia [68].
While the Turner parameters are based almost exclusively on thermodynamic measurements, there has been
increasing interest in optimizing parameters such as to
maximize prediction accuracy, see e.g. [69]. As an example for such trained parameters we provide the Andronescu parameter set from ref. [70].
To maintain backward compatibility we also ship
Turner ‘99 energy parameter files containing the basic
contributions used in previous versions of the ViennaRNA Package. These parameter files, however, will
not always produce results identical to earlier versions
of the package. Affecting mainly the computation of
consensus structures, these differences are mainly owed
to a different handling of non-standard base pairs (i.e.,
base pairs other than Watson-Crick and GU). The current implementation assumes that the energy contribution of a loop with non-standard base pairs or nonstandard nucleotides equals the least stabilizing contribution from the same loop type with canonical nucleotides and pairs only. Small differences may also appear
in partition function computations as a consequence of
round-off errors.
Since the structure of the energy model has changed
in ViennaRNA Package 2.0, energy parameter files for

Lorenz et al. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 2011, 6:26
http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26

versions 1.8.5. and earlier will not work with the new
version of the package. Such old-style user-supplied
parameter files can be converted to the new file format
using the RNAparconv utility.
Additional output options

More information gathered through the course of the
folding algorithms can be included in the output. RNAfold and RNAalifold, for instance, optionally provide further information about the reliability of folding
results. When evaluating ensemble properties with the
partition function, most programs now also compute
the centroid structure [71], i.e., the structure with the
smallest average base pair distance to all other structures in the ensemble. When base pair probabilities are
computed, the maximum expected accuracy (MEA)
structure [18,72] is also available. The RNALfold/
RNALfoldz program now features an add-on to calculate the z-score for the predicted local secondary structures [48]. This makes results comparable between
sequences with different nucleotide compositions and
facilitates the choice of a reasonable cutoff thresholds to
decrease the number of structure hits.
Program options and documentation

Each of the command-line tools provides the option -h
or –help to print a brief overview of its general behavior as well as a list of all available parameter options
including their description. To obtain more detailed
information or even exemplary use-case scenarios for a
certain program of the ViennaRNA Package, a UNIX
manpage is provided for each of them.
An important change in the new release is the compliance to the GNU standard regarding the format of command-line options. Short options consist of a single
character preceded by a minus sign, e.g. -p, while long
options are strings of two or more characters preceded
by two minus signs, e.g. –noLP. This change will break
backward compatibility wherever command-line tools
from older versions of the package were used. This can
be easily fixed by inserting the second dash in long
options.

Page 8 of 14

characters (, ), and. to denote nucleotides that are paired
with a partner upstream or downstream, or that are
unpaired, resp. In addition to uniquely determining a
pseudoknot-free secondary structure, this notation has
the advantage of providing a compact annotation of the
sequence or alignment to which the structure refers.
The dot-parentheses-format is meanwhile used
also in many unrelated tools e.g. [18,21,61,73-79]. Similar annotation strings are used to specify constraints as
input to folding algorithms.
The requirement to write input items on a single line
usually requires data format conversions for the interactions with most other bioinformatics tools. These
usually read and write FASTA format [80], which allows
white spaces and line breaks arbitrarily interspersed
within a sequence. An improved handling of data input
now provides full FASTA support for all tools that
require only sequences or sequence alignments as input.
This should considerably facilitate the use of the ViennaRNA Package. More complex input structures are
still required for the tools that compute RNA-RNA
interactions, in particular RNAup and RNAcofold.
Programs that process alignment data used clustal
format [81] in previous versions of the package. Due to
the wide-spread use of the STOCKHOLM format in RNA
bioinformatics, e.g. in the Rfam - RNA family database [82]), support for *.stk files has been added.
There are currently no plans to include support for
input formats that use heavy markup such as Genbank
[83] files or XML-based formats such as BioXSD [84]
or RNAML [85].

RNAlib API to fast and reliable algorithms
The algorithms implemented in the ViennaRNA Package are not only accessible by means of the interactive
programs outlined in the previous section but also
directly in the form of a C/C++ library. This makes
them readily available for third-party programs and,
with the help of included Perl-interface, to elaborate
scripting pipelines.

Input file formats

A plethora of different file formats have been introduced
by the many tools and databases relevant to RNA bioinformatics. The ViennaRNA Package has also contributed to this unpleasant diversity with its own native
formats. Originally designed for simulation pipelines in
which no meta-data is attached to sequence or structure
data, it expects input items (sequences and/or structures) as single strings uninterrupted by white spaces or
line breaks. FASTA-like headers can optionally be used
to specify an identifier for the data item(s). Secondary
structures are also specified as strings, using the three

OpenMP thread-safe C/C++ API

Multi-core CPUs have become standard components in
off-the-shelf PC hardware. In order to allow the ViennaRNA Package to make use of this increase of computational power, several changes had to be introduced
into the API functions of the RNAlib. Although it is
possible to parallelize the core folding algorithms
[86,87] this requires substantial overheads so that the
gain is small unless massively parallel architectures are
used. On the other hand, computationally demanding
applications of RNA folding typically require the

Lorenz et al. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 2011, 6:26
http://www.almob.org/content/6/1/26

processing of large numbers of input sequences, a task
that trivially can be parallelized. The only requirement
for enabling concurrent computation on shared memory
multi-core systems using OpenMP [88] is that the core
algorithms are independent of shared global variables
and thus thread-safe. In particular the variables referring
to the energy parameters are now deprecated and
replaced by additional functions or parameters which
have to be passed to functions. A few remaining global
variables, which are inaccessible through RNAlib, were
made thread-private using OpenMP, allowing simultaneous function calls to operate on private copies of
these variables. Using the OpenMP framework, third
party applications are therefore now able to call RNAlib interfaces, such as MFE or partition function algorithms, in parallel. Limitations concerning the use of
different energy models used in concurrent computations are described in detail in the API reference manual. For backward compatibility, the old functions of the
previous API remain included in RNAlib but are
marked as deprecated. Thus, programs which were
developed for binding against the previous versions of
RNAlib up to 1.8.5 are still working without limitations
when linked against the new library.
The reference manual

Documentation is an important issue for the usability of
the RNAlib API. In previous versions of the ViennaRNA Package, this was addressed by maintaining, in
addition to the source code, a texinfo-based reference
manual containing introductions into the particular problem sets and describing the related library functions. In
order to keep this documentation up to date and to
decrease the developers’ effort in maintaining the manual, we opted to use in-source documentation that (a)
helps developers who interact with the source code
directly and (b) enable to use the doxygen documentation program to generate a comprehensive and always
up-to-date reference manual automatically. An HTML
and a PDF version are included in the package.

Performance
We assess the performance of the ViennaRNA Package 2.0 both in terms of computational efficiency and
in terms of prediction accuracy. We emphasize that it is
not the purpose of this contribution to compare thermodynamics-based prediction algorithms against other
approaches to RNA structure prediction. For such a
benchmark we refer to the literature, e.g. [18,89,90].
In order to investigate the impact of the energy parameters, and in particular of our small changes to the
Turner 2004 model, we use a test set comprising all 1817
non-multimer sequence/structure pairs in the RNAstrand
database [73] without pseudoknots in the reference structure. For each sequence, the MFE secondary structure was
calculated with RNAfold 2.0, RNAfold 1.8.5, UNAFold
3.8 [19], and RNAstructure 5.2 [20]. All use a nearest
neighbor energy model and a variant of Zuker’s dynamic
programming algorithm. As expected, the new version of
RNAfold performs better than the old one. Somewhat surprisingly, however, RNAfold 2.0 also performs slightly
better than RNAstructure 5.2 and UNAFold 3.8,
despite the fact that we neglected a few peculiarities of the
most recent energy model, see Figure 2, Additional File 1
and the implementation details in the appendix. The average performance indicators are compiled in Table 2. We
emphasize, however, that the performance of the algorithms differs widely across RNA families and no single
implementation provides consistently superior results.
Detailed data can be found in Additional File 2.
Despite the increase in the number of parameters from
Turner ‘99 to Turner 2004 we observe virtually no difference in the runtime and memory consumption
between RNAfold 1.8.5 and RNAfold 2.0. Similar
comparisons can be made for other components of the
ViennaRNA Package. The computational speed of
RNAfold compares quite favorably to that of the competing implementations, Figure 2B, although all the
implementations of thermodynamic folding algorithms
use essentially the same energy model and algorithmic
framework, and hence have the same asymptotic runtime and memory consumption.

PERL bindings

Scripting language bindings to the C functions in the
RNAlib are made using the SWIG interface compiler.
With the ViennaRNA Package, we include bindings
for the most important library functions made accessible
for the script language Perl. This allows a very easy
access to e.g. the folding functions and thus a rapid
design of functional pipelines or small programs that
exploit the potential of the ViennaRNA Package.
Using the SWIG environment bindings for other (scripting) languages including Python and JAVA can be
implemented quite easily.

Discussion
The ViennaRNA Package has been a useful tool for the
RNA bioinformatics community for almost two decades.
Quite a few widely-used software tools and data analysis
pipelines have been built upon this foundation, either
incorporating calls to the interactive programs or directly
interfacing to RNAlib. Numeric characteristics of secondary structures, such as Gibbs free energy ΔG, Minimum
free energy (MFE), ensemble diversity or probabilities of
MFE structures in the ensemble, have been widely used as
features for machine learning classification, e.g. in

Figure 2 Performance comparison of RNAfold 2.0 to other secondary structure prediction software. (A) Accuracy of thermodynamic
folding programs in terms of cumulative distribution of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RNAfold 2.0 outperforms the other
secondary structure prediction programs on the RNAstrand dataset: more of its predictions fall into the region of higher performance values.
Both versions of RNAfold were run with -d2 option. For UNAFold and RNAStructure default options were used. Performance
distributions of Sensitivity, Positive predictive value (PPV) and F-measure are shown in Additional File 1. The averaged overall accuracies can be
taken from table 2. (B) Comparison of runtimes for MFE structure predictions. Measurement was performed on an Intel® Core™ 2 6600 CPU
running at 2.4 GHz. Shown are averaged running times for random sequences of lengths 100 nt (100 samples), 500 nt (100 samples), 1000 nt
(100 samples), 2500 nt (20 samples), 5000 nt (16 samples) and 10000 nt (16 samples). While the compared programs RNAfold 2.0, RNAfold
1.8.5 and UNAfold 3.8 were capable of predicting an MFE structure for all tested samples in a relatively small time frame,
RNAstructure 5.2 was omitted from predictions for the 10000 nt sample set due to its time requirements.

microRNA precursor and target detection [91-94]. The
non-coding RNA gene finder RNAz [95,96], the snoRNA
detector snoReport [97], and RNAstrand [98], a tool
that predicts the reading direction of structured RNAs
from a multiple sequence alignment, combine thermodynamic properties computed with RNAlib functions and a
machine learning component. RNAsoup [99] takes advantage of the programs RNAfold, RNAalifold and some
other tools provided by the ViennaRNA Package for a
structural clustering of ncRNAs. The siRNA design program RNAxs [100] employs the site accessibility predictions offered by RNAplfold, as does IntaRNA [60], a
program to predict RNA interaction sites. Several secondary structure prediction tools, such as CentroidFold
[22], McCaskill-MEA [101], or RNAsalsa [102], use
base pair probabilities predicted by RNAfold -p as input,
Table 2 Averaged performance measures for
thermodynamic folding algorithms

while the LocARNA package [59] uses them for structural
alignment. The motif-based comparison and alignment
tool ExpaRNA [103] and the tree alignment program
RNAforester [75] also rely on the algorithms provided
by RNAlib. Since its initial publication [25], no comprehensive description [104] of the ViennaRNA Package
has appeared. Release 2.0 now implements the latest
energy model, provides many new and improved functionalities, and - as we hope - is even easier and more efficient
to use due to a thread-safe architecture, an improved API,
a more consistent set of options, and a much more
detailed documentation. Care has been taken to ensure
backward compatibility so that ViennaRNA Package
2.0 can be readily substituted for earlier versions.

free energy calculations. This entails not only an update
of all free energy evaluating sections in each affected
program, but also major changes in the structure of the
parameter sets. In particular, several additional energy
parameters for the different loop types (hairpin loops,
interior loops and multi-branch loops) were introduced.
In order to keep the number of energy parameters and
thus the complexity of the energy model small, we
refrained from implementing exceptional contributions
for some highly specialized configurations. In particular
the following special cases are not incorporated in our
folding recursions:
1. All-C loop penalty, i.e., a penalizing contribution
for loops consisting of unpaired cytosine only;
2. Additional stabilizing GU-closure term that is
applied only in the context of hairpin loops, enclosed
by a GU (not UG) base pair which is preceded by
two Gs;
3. A special intramolecular helix formation of the
four consecutive base pairs GC, GU, UG and CG,
which has a single tabulated contribution of -4.12
kcal/mol.
4. Consideration of an auxilary contributing factor
that reflects the number of states of a bulge loop, i.e.
the number of all possible bulges with identical
sequence.
5. Average asymmetry correcting penalty in multibranch loops which constitutes the mean difference
in unpaired nucleotides on both sides of the branching stems;
6. Extra penalty for three-way branching loops with
less then two unpaired nucleotides;
Adapting the dynamic programming recursions to also
take into account these loop configurations resulted in
an increase of time and memory requirements without a
compensating benefit in terms of prediction accuracy.
The data-set we used for measuring the prediction performance also did not reveal any significant unfavorable
effect of our simplification of the model. However, free
energy evaluation of a given sequence/structure pair, as
done by RNAeval, may introduce these extra cases in
the near future as an additional parameter, such as logarithmic multi-branch loop evaluation.
All our folding algorithms assume -d2 as the default
dangling-end model, allowing a single nucleotide to contribute with all its possible favorable interactions. The dangling-end/helix-stacking model suggested by the Turner’04
parameters is realized with the -d3 option. An additional
model allowing a single nucleotide to be involved in at
most one favorable interaction but ignoring helix-stacking
can be chosen with -d1, while -d0 deactivates danglingend and helix-stacking contributions altogether.

Performance

The base pair positions along the RNA sequence were
taken as predicted properties for all of the performance
measurements. Thus, all base pairs in the reference
structure contribute to the number of true positives
(TP). The number of false positives (FP) is obtained by
counting all base pairs that are in the predicted but not
in the reference secondary structure. Along with that, all
base pairs present in the reference but not in the prediction result are regarded as false negatives (FN). These
numbers are then used to compute the sensitivity, also
known as true positive rate (TPR), and precision, also
known as positive predictive value (PPV) [105].

character in the on-screen output below is the separator
between the two sequences. In addition to the mfe and
the ensemble representation with their energies, the
binding energy is shown.
(F) Output for kinetics (using RNAsubopt output fed
into the external programs barriers and treekin).
The diagram shows the change in population from the
start, where state 20 is populated, towards the equilibrium state 1. The inner picture shows the barrier tree
upon which the relative concentrations of the diagram
are based. The 20 lowest suboptimal structures and the
paths connecting them are depicted, together with the
barrier heights.
(G) Output of the three versions of RNAsubopt. Left:
Output of the Wuchty algorithm, all structures within a
certain energy band are shown. Right: Zuker algorithm,
showing the best structures for every possible base pair.
Bottom: Stochastic backtracking, random structures
drawn according to their probability in the ensemble.

Authors’ contributions
Work on the Vienna RNA Package is coordinated by ILH. The design
and structure of version 2.0 resulted from discussion of RL with ILH, PFS, CF,
SHB and CHzS. Implementation and performance analysis was performed by
RL with contributions of HT (RNAplex and RNAsnoop). CHzS provided
the converted new energy parameter files. Detailed documentation for the
RNAlib was done by RL and SHB based on pre-existing sources. The
manuscript was written by RL with major contribution by SHB, PFS, and ILH.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
