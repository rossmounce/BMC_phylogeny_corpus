Genetic complexity and multiple infections with
more Parvovirus species in naturally infected cats
Mara Battilani*, Andrea Balboni, Martina Ustulin, Massimo Giunti, Alessandra Scagliarini, Santino Prosperi

Abstract
Parvoviruses of carnivores include three closely related autonomous parvoviruses: canine parvovirus (CPV), feline
panleukopenia virus (FPV) and mink enteritis virus (MEV). These viruses cause a variety of serious diseases, especially
in young patients, since they have a remarkable predilection for replication in rapidly dividing cells. FPV is not the
only parvovirus species which infects cats; in addition to MEV, the new variants of canine parvovirus, CPV-2a, 2b
and 2c have also penetrated the feline host-range, and they are able to infect and replicate in cats, causing
diseases indistinguishable from feline panleukopenia. Furthermore, as cats are susceptible to both CPV-2 and FPV
viruses, superinfection and co-infection with multiple parvovirus strains may occur, potentially facilitating
recombination and high genetic heterogeneity. In the light of the importance of cats as a potential source of
genetic diversity for parvoviruses and, since feline panleukopenia virus has re-emerged as a major cause of
mortality in felines, the present study has explored the molecular characteristics of parvovirus strains circulating in
cat populations. The most significant findings reported in this study were (a) the detection of mixed infection FPV/
CPV with the presence of one parvovirus variant which is a true intermediate between FPV/CPV and (b) the
quasispecies cloud size of one CPV sample variant 2c. In conclusion, this study provides new important results
about the evolutionary dynamics of CPV infections in cats, showing that CPV has presumably started a new
process of readaptation in feline hosts.
Background
Parvoviruses are non-enveloped single-stranded DNA
viruses which infect a wide range of mammalian species, including several members of the order Carnivora.
Parvoviruses of carnivores include three closely related
autonomous parvoviruses: canine parvovirus (CPV),
feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and mink enteritis
virus (MEV). These viruses cause a variety of serious
diseases, especially in young patients, since they have a
remarkable predilection for replication in rapidly dividing cells, such as bone marrow, enteric epithelium and
the foetus. Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), the prototype parvovirus of carnivores, is responsible for a
homonymous disease, a highly contagious sickness
occurring in cats, characterized by severe leukopenia,
gastroenteritis, reproductive disorders and nervous
signs [1].
FPV is not the only parvovirus species affecting cats;
in addition to MEV, the new variants of canine

parvovirus, CPV-2a, 2b [2] and 2c [3] have also penetrated the feline host-range, and they are able to infect
and replicate in cats, causing diseases indistinguishable
from feline panleukopenia.
In consequence of the host range shift of CPV-2 from
dog to cats, natural infections of cats and wild felines
with CPV-2 have been reported [4], but FPV remains
the more prevalent species of parvoviruses causing disease in cats [5].
Recent investigations carried out by characterization at
the molecular level of the parvovirus strains detected in
cats with gastroenteritis have also shown a clear prevalence of FPV over CPV-2 in naturally infected cats [3,6].
On the contrary, in some Asian countries, more than
80% of the isolates from cats and wild felines were CPV
types, but the precise mechanism of the predominance
of CPV-2 in cats in these areas remains obscure [7].
Furthermore, since cats are susceptible to both CPV-2
and FPV viruses, superinfection and co-infection with
multiple parvovirus strains may occur, potentially facilitating recombination and high genetic heterogeneity [8-11].

In the light of the importance of cats as a potential
source of genetic diversity for parvoviruses and, since
feline panleukopenia virus has re-emerged as a major
cause of mortality in felines, parvovirus strains detected
in cats with clinical signs of panleukopenia were analyzed, and molecular characterization, sequence diversity
and genetic complexity were evaluated on the VP2 capsid gene.
The detection of an FPV/CPV mixed infection in one
infected cat with the presence of a parvovirus variant
which is a true intermediate between CPV and FPV and
the quasispecies cloud size of one CPV sample variant
2c were the most significant findings reported in this
study.

Materials and methods
Samples

The sample population included 24 cats, under
15 months of age, with a clinical diagnosis of parvovirus
infection and at least one biological specimen (fecal or
gut samples) sent to the Laboratory of Virology of the
Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences (DVMS University of Bologna, Italy) for diagnostic purposes
between March 2000 and November 2009. The biological samples collected were frozen and stored at -80°C
for later analysis. Confirmation of parvovirus infection
was carried out by PCR amplification as previously
described [12]. The characteristics of the samples examined are summarized in Table 1.
In most cases, cats had a history of incomplete or no
vaccinations. The clinical symptoms most frequently
observed in our population included fever, anorexia, gastro-intestinal signs (diarrhea, vomiting), depression,
weakness and leukopenia. In most of the subjects, the
clinical course was mild and chronic while two patients
(829/03 and 1035/09) were clinically healthy. However,
8 cats included in the study showed a more severe manifestation of the disease: 3 of them (828/03, 1033/09 and
1034/09), actually died suddenly without showing any
clinical signs; the other 5 were referred to the Veterinary
Teaching Hospital of the University of Bologna (VTHUB) for a severe and acute manifestation of the disease
and died shortly after admission, despite intensive
therapy.
Fourteen cats came from feline colonies where recurrent cases of parvovirus infections occurred with a seasonal cadence.
Molecular characterisation of viral strains
Extraction of viral DNA, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of
the VP2 gene and consensus sequencing

Viral DNA was extracted from specimens using a
Nucleospin Tissue mini kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Page 2 of 9

The entire VP2 gene was amplified with a set of primers designed for both feline and canine parvovirus (P1
forward 5’-ATGAGTGATGGAGCAGTTC-3’ and VP
reverse 5’-TTCTAGGTGCTAGTTGAG-3’). Reactions
of amplification were carried out using the Klen Taq LA
Polymerase Mix (Clontech-TAKARA Bio Company,
Mountain View, CA, USA) which contains KlenTaq-1
DNA polymerase as the primary polymerase and a small
amount of a 3’ ® 5’ proofreading polymerase for high
fidelity PCR. The temperature cycling protocol consisted
of 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing
at 54°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min, with
a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. A 5 μL aliquot of
each PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis using
a 1% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining.
The targeted DNA fragments were purified using a
PCR product purification kit (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and sequenced in both orientations, sense
and antisense, using standard dideoxy sequencing with
fluorescence-labelled nucleotides (Applied BiosystemPerkinElmer, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Direct sequencing of the PCR products of two viral
strains, 1469/02 and 998/08, showed an unusually high
number of ambiguities; although a proofreading Taq
was used, these results suggested mixed viral populations; therefore, the amplification products were cloned
into the PCR 4/TOPO vector using the TOPO cloning
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a-competent cells
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Eight and
ten recombinant clones for the strains 1469/02 and
998/08, respectively, were purified with Turbo Kit
(QBIOgene-MP Biomedicals, Montreal, Canada) and
were sequenced.
Sequence data

The complete VP2 nucleotide sequences obtained were
compared to sequences available from the GenBank and
alignment of the sequences was carried out using the
CLUSTAL W web interface. The alignments are available from the authors on request.
Translation of the nucleotide sequences into amino
acid sequences and the degree of similarity among the
sequences at both the nucleotide and the amino acid
levels was determined using the BIOEDIT sequence
alignment editor version 7.0.9.
A variety of statistical analyses regarding nucleotide
diversity and sequence variability were carried out on
the sequence data set using the versatile program
DNASP version 5.10.00 [13]. Statistical analysis was carried out on the subpopulations, grouping the sequence
data on the basis of the parvovirus species and the antigenic types.
The following parameters were considered: the number of polymorphic sites S, the nucleotide diversity

Feline panleukopenia modified-live vaccines.

Pi (π) [14] which is the average number of substitutions
between any two sequences and it standard deviation
(standard error), and the total number of synonymous
and non-synonymous differences.
Mutation frequency (total number of changes/total
number of bases sequenced) and the percentage of
mutated clones were used as indicators of genetic
diversity of the viral population of strains 1469/02 and
998/08.
To examine the evolutionary pressures influencing the
parvovirus evolution inside the host over time, the ratio
of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous
site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site (dS) were estimated using the Datamonkey web
interface, a maximum likelihood-based tool for the identification of sites subject to positive or negative selection. Datamonkey implements three complementary
methods: single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC),
fixed effects likelihood (FEL) and random effects likelihood (REL). The HKY85 model was employed for the
entire data set and for sample 998/08 whereas, for sample 1469/02, the F81 substitution model was applied.
Since genetic recombination has been assessed as a factor in parvovirus evolution [10,11], and recombination

events could affect phylogenetic and pressure analyses, a
sequence dataset was screened for recombination using
Genetic Algorithms for Recombination Detection
(GARD) [15].
Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were
estimated using PAUP* version 4.0, with the best-fit
model of nucleotide substitution determined using Modeltest [16]. The TrN + I + Γ substitution model was
optimal for all the sequence data (including reference
strains), whereas the GTR + I + Γ substitution model
was used for the sequences analyzed in this study; the
key parameter values (the TrN and GTR substitution
matrix, the proportion of invariant sites I and the
gamma distribution Γ of rate variation with eight categories) were estimated from the data given. To assess
support for individual nodes, bootstrap resampling
values were estimated with 1000 neighbor-joining trees,
again employing PAUP*.
The following reference FPV strains detected in various parts of the world were obtained from GenBank
and included in the phylogenetic analysis: Asia (accession numbers: AB000052; AB000054; AB000056;

Results
In this study we analyzed 24 parvovirus strains detected
in domestic cats. Molecular detection of the parvoviruses was carried out on biological specimens by
applying PCR, and the VP2 gene sequences were
determined.
The nucleotide sequences of the VP2 gene obtained
were 1745 bp in length. Analysis of the deduced amino
acid residues at critical positions allowed the identification
of the parvovirus species: 22 viral strains were FPV while,
for two strains, 1469/02 and 998/08, it was necessary to
proceed with the cloning of the amplicons, since the direct
sequencing of PCR products showed an unusually high
number of ambiguites, suggesting the presence of mixed
viral populations. The amplification products of 1745 bp
of strains 1469/02 and 998/08 were cloned, and 8 and 10
clones respectively, were chosen for sequencing.
Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 1469/02
clones evidenced 8 different viral populations with a
sequence similarity at the nucleotide level which varied
from 99.8 to 99.9%. At the amino acid level, clones 2-6-7
were identical while the remaining clones differed in identity by 99.5 to 99.8%. Analysing the amino acid positions
which distinguish the feline and canine parvovirus species
and the antigenic types of CPV, it was seen that all clones
of 1469/02 belonged to the new variant CPV-2c.
Sequence analysis of 10 clones of strain 998/08
showed complete identity between clone 6 and clone 20
as well as between clones 1, 3, 4 and 7 at the nucleotide
level; the other clones showed a sequence similarity
which varied from 98.3 to 99.9%. On the basis of the
deduced amino acid sequences, clones 1-3-4-7-12-13
were identical; the remaining clones showed a sequence
similarity which varied from 97.6 to 99.8%. Analysis of
the critical residues which affect the host-range and

antigenic properties of parvoviruses of carnivores,
showed that clones 6, 15 and 20 were CPV-2a; instead,
clones 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13 were FPV, with evidence of a
mixed infection involving two species of parvovirus in
the same patient.
Regarding the 22 FPV strains, comparison of the
nucleotide sequences showed a 100% similarity between
the following strains: 828/03 and 829/03; 159/07, 239/07
and 398/07; 1033/09, 1034/09, 1035/09, 1036/09, 1037/
09, 1038/09, 1039/09 and 1040/09. In the remaining
strains, the similarity ranged from 99.1 to 99.8%. At the
amino acid level, strains 828/03, 713/01, 239/07, 398/07,
173/07, 1897/06 and clones 1, 3, 4, 7, 12, 13 of strain
998/08, as well as strains 339/06 and 1076/02 were identical; the other strains showed a sequence of similarity
which varied from 99.6 to 99.8.
Several synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were detected by comparing the sequences. The
predicted amino acid sequence substitutions are summarized in Table 2. The sequences obtained were compared to parvovirus reference strains retrieved from the
GenBank database; the alignments showed that, of the 6
non-synonymous changes, at least 2 were very common
since the reference strains also showed them and they
are the coding change in residue 13 (Pro®Ser) and
residue 91 (Ala®Ser). The VP2 Asn 426-to-Ser, Lys
501-to-Arg, Asn 517-to-Ser changes were unique and
characteristic of our strains.
Sample 1469/02 showed unusually high genetic
diversity generated within the infected host; six of the
10 (60%) mutations were non-synonymous. Coding
changes located in residues 46 (Asn®Asp), 98 (Leu®Ser), 340 (Ala®Val), 373 (Asp®Val) and 511
(Asp®Asn) have not previously been reported while
the mutation affecting position 282 (Asn®Asp) has
already been reported [17].
The 998/08 sample also displayed very high genetic
complexity; on the basis of the VP2 amino acid
sequences, we were able to detect four main viral populations: clones 1, 3, 4, 7, 12 and 13 resemble the predominant FPV strains circulating in our area since these
clones are identical to the majority of the FPV strains
analyzed in this study while clone 9 is an FPV strain
with unique characteristics, and is distinguishable from
the other clones due to the presence of coding change
VP2 Leu 498-to-Ser. Clones 6 and 20 are typical CPV2a with a coding change located at position 482 (Leu
®Pro), and finally clone 15, is a true intermediate
between CPV and FPV, since analyzing the 10 important
host-specific amino acids of FPV and CPV, showed that
there were eight residues identical to CPV-2a and two
amino acids identical to FPV (Table 2).
Summaries of sample sequence variability are presented in Table 3. The sequence data are analyzed

separately on the basis of viral typing, grouping the
sequences into three different subpopulations: FPV (all
typical FPV strains), 1469/02 (all clones of sample 1469/
02) and 998/08 (all clones of sample 998/08). The data
are compared to samples showing analogous characteristics of genetic diversity and previously analyzed in our
laboratory [8,18]. The sequence variability of the 998/08
sample was higher than the variability of the other
sequence data analyzed, as was seen by the values of
parameter π. A total of 34 polymorphic sites were found
scattered within the sequence data of sample 998/08.
The non-synonymous fraction was greater for sample
1469/02, indicating a clear prevalence of the number of
non-synonymous mutations in this sample. In fact, in
the clones of 1469/02, there were 6 non-synonymous
mutations out of a total of 10 mutations.
For samples 1469/02 and 998/08, the mutation frequency and the percentage of mutated viral clones were
used as indicators of population diversity. The mutation
frequency was of the order of one mutation every 7.2 ×
10-4 nt to 2 × 10-3 nt (Table 4).
To evaluate the selection pressure which acts on the
VP2 gene, the ratio of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous substitutions (dN) per site was calculated for the
entire gene; the values of the dN/dS ratio were estimated as 0.27 for the entire sequence data set, 0.04 for
the FPV dataset, 0.33 for sample 1469/02 and 0.18 for

sample 998/08. A maximum likelihood approach was
used for detecting the sites under selection in the viral
clones. All methods implemented in the Datamonkey
web interface were run and a comparative analysis integration was carried out. When the entire sequence data
set was analyzed, the SLAC and FEL methods did not
detect sites subject to positive selection but they found
8 and 32 sites under negative selections. The only REL
analysis has detected 3 positively selected sites when the
value of the Bayes factor was 100 (codons 13, 426, 564).
The pressure analyses were carried out separately on the
clone data sets, with the aim of investigating which
selective forces acted during intra-host infection. All
methods pointed out several sites under negative selection for samples 998/08 and 1469/02, and the REL
method showed that all sites were under purifying selection for sample 1469/02. No potential recombination
events were detected in the data set of the viral clones.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the VP2
nucleotide sequences obtained in this study and additional sequences were retrieved from the GenBank database. Unrooted tree showed two main clusters
supported by elevated bootstrap values: FPV clade one
and CPV clade one. The CPV cluster included all clones
of sample 1469/02 and the CPV-2a clones of sample
998/08, with clone 15 of sample 998/08 forming a
monophyletic branch. Inside the FPV cluster, a clear
clustering on a temporal or geographical basis was not
noted (Figure 1). Many FPV strains analyzed in this
study clustered with Italian, European and Asian FPV
strains. A recent FPV strain isolated from diarrhoeic
monkeys [19] forms a separate lineage between the two
clusters.

Discussion
FPV infections of cats

The present study explored the molecular characteristics
of parvovirus strains circulating in cat populations and,
although limited in the number of sequences analyzed,
provides important new findings about the evolutionary
dynamics of parvoviruses in cats and the host-virus relationships. Current results have demonstrated that the
majority of feline panleukopenia outbreaks are caused
by classic FPV strains and that FPV varies at a slow rate
by random genetic drift, without a clear temporal or
geographical distribution, as has already been reported
in a recent study [6]. Considering all the nucleotide
changes encountered in the VP2 sequences of FPV,
synonymous substitutions predominated over nonsynonymous substitutions, and the majority of FPV
strains are identical at the amino acidic level. In spite of
the low level of variability evidenced in the capsid gene,
among the non-synonymous mutations of FPV
sequences, one change involving an important epitope

for CPV, residue 426, should be noted. Changes in residue 426 have modified the antigenic profile of CPV
since it is located in the major antigenic region over the
three-fold spike of the CPV capsid, and molecular epidemiological studies have demonstrated that complicated
selection dynamics act on this residue [20]. Residue 426
has undergone two mutations since the emergence of
CPV, first from asparagine to aspartate and, more
recently, to glutamate, amino acid changes which constitute an important genetic marker for the new variants of
CPV, and the only coding changes capable of distinguishing the CPV-2a strains from CPV-2b/2c strains

[21]. The biological consequences of these mutations
are not clear, although it has been observed that the
new variants have acquired definite advantages over the
original CPV-2. Mutations involving residue 426 have
not previously been reported for FPV in the literature;
therefore, the exact consequences of the change Asn426 to Ser detected in FPV strain 1306/04 are not
known but, analogously to CPV, it may be hypothesised
that this change could affect the antigenic profile of
FPV and confer an evolutive advantage to the virus.
Further studies and investigations on other FPV strains
detected from other parts of the world are needed to

Battilani et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:43
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/43

clarify whether this mutation is fixed in the FPV population as a consequence of the mechanisms of antigenic
escape or further adaptation to the feline host.
Multiple CPV infections of cats and evidence for
coinfection

The diffusion of CPV in domestic cats and the pathogenic potential of CPV in causing infection or disease in
cats have not been systematically investigated. Our
report confirms that feline CPV infections are rare in
Europe, since CPV is found only sporadically in feline
biological samples [5].
A particularly significant finding in this study was the
unusual genetic complexity reported for sample 1469/
02, with 8 different viral populations belonging to type
2c of the CPV which coexisted in an infected cat, a phenomenon which resembles the quasispecies distribution
found in RNA virus populations.
It is interesting to note that, in sample 1469/02, only
the antigenic CPV variant 2c was detected, and this variant has already been reported in multiple infections of
high genetic complexity. The genetic diversity displayed
by sample 1469/02 was analogous to the high levels of
sequence variation observed for a CPV sample (116/05)
analyzed in our previous report, where a coinfection
with two antigenically CPV variants 2a and 2c in a
domestic cat was detected (Table 3) [8]; in that case,
superinfection with many CPV variants was the source
of such genetic diversity. In addition, we reported a coinfection in a dog with CPV variants 2a and 2c [18].
Experimental data and field observations reported a
more severe clinical course and higher mortality rates
associated with CPV-2c infection as well as an ability to
infect and cause diseases in adult dogs, even if repeatedly
vaccinated, suggesting that the Glu-426 mutation could
provide a certain advantage in viral replication [22].
The unique antigenic pattern exhibited by CPV-2c
could confer biological advantages on this variant, such
as the possibility of escaping the adaptive immune system and the chance of increasing the complexity and
diversity of the quasispecies. Diversity in viral quasispecies has been described as a mechanism for avoiding
host resistance responses or a reservoir for maintaining
variants with a selective advantage in other environments, and it has been correlated with the ability of
infecting numerous hosts [23], having relevant biological
implications for viral evolution and pathogenesis.
Furthermore, it is necessary to point out the genetic
complexity observed in another sample (998/08), analyzed in this study. Sample 998/08 contained two distinct
species of parvovirus, FPV and CPV type 2a, with the
presence of one parvovirus variant, clone 15, that showed
intermediate characteristics between FPV and CPV-2a.
Clone 15 presented at positions 80, 93, 103 and 323, the

Page 8 of 9

same residues as typical CPV-2a, but residue 564 and 568
displayed amino acids Asn and Ala which are typical of
FPV sequences. Since Datamonkey analysis excluded the
fact that recombination events took place, it has been
hypothesized that these coding changes are the result of
de novo mutations arising during in vivo infection as an
adaption of CPV into the new environment. Since cats
constitute a relatively new host for CPV, the changes in
positions 564 and 568 could increase viral fitness and be
the result of virus adaptation on the new host species.
Furthermore, the mutation frequency detected in sample
998/08 was of the order of 2 × 10-3, a value analogous to
the RNA virus, and higher when compared to the annual
substitution rate of the order of 104 to 105 nt. estimates
of carnivore parvovirus. This result supports the importance of coinfection as a potential source of genetic
diversity, confirming previous reports about the intrahost
diversity of parvoviruses [9]. On the other hand, the
higher genetic heterogeneity detected in sample 998/08
points out the predominant epidemiological role of cats
as (a) carriers of carnivore parvovirus since it is susceptible to both viruses and (b) sources of new variants of parvoviruses [24]. Although coinfection with CPV and FPV
would be a plausible event, to the author’s knowledge, it
has not previously been reported in the natural state.
Our study demonstrated that CPV-FPV coinfection in
cats has generated more variants for both species and, in
particular, a CPV variant which is a true intermediate
between the two species has been identified. A previous
study demonstrated that CPV has emerged as a host
range variant of FPV and this variant has acquired the
ability to infect dogs through multistep changes in its
capsid protein controlling critical molecular interaction
with host cell receptor TfR binding [25]. This type of
multistep adaptation has already been seen for other
viruses, such as the influenza virus, and it is favoured
when viable intermediate viruses can be selected [26].
The emergence of CPV has also involved the interspecies
transmission between wild and domestic carnivores, a
hypothesis confirmed by the detection of FPV-like strains
with intermediate characteristics between CPV/FPV [27].
The report of clone 15 in sample 998/08 which contained
FPV- and CPV-specific epitopes stresses the importance
of this mechanism of multistep mutation in the production of new variants and in the emergence of new viruses.
In conclusion, this study provides new important results
about the evolutionary dynamics of CPV infections in cats,
showing that CPV has presumably started a new process
of readaptation in the feline host and confirming the
importance of viral host switching as a mechanism for the
emergence of new viruses. The detection of mixed FPV/
CPV infections in cats, associated with the report of the
high genetic diversity of CPV-2 when it infects and replicates in cats, indicates the need to conduct additional

Battilani et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:43
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/43

studies in order to clarify the epidemiological role of cats
in parvovirus infection, and it emphasizes the possible role
of cats as a source of new variants of parvoviruses.
Furthermore, the introduction of CPV into the feline
population raises some concerns about the efficacy of
FPV-based vaccines in preventing CPV infection, and
points out the necessity for intensifying surveillance of
parvovirus infection in cats.
