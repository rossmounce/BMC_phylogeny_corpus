Abstract
Background: This study addresses the apportionment of genetic diversity between Cycas revoluta
and C. taitungensis, species that constitute the section Asiorientales and represent a unique, basal
lineage of the Laurasian genus Cycas. Fossil evidence indicates divergence of the section from the
rest of Cycas at least 30 million years ago. Geographically, C. taitungensis is limited to Taiwan
whereas C. revoluta is found in the Ryukyu Archipelago and on mainland China.
Results: The phylogenies of ribosomal ITS region of mtDNA and the intergenic spacer between
atpB and rbcL genes of cpDNA were reconstructed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed paraphyly of
both loci in the two species and also in the section Asiorientales. The lack of reciprocal monophyly
between these long isolated sections is likely due to persistent shared ancestral polymorphisms.
Molecular dating estimated that mt- and cp DNA lineages coalesced to the most recent common
ancestors (TMRCA) about 327 (mt) and 204 MYA (cp), corresponding with the divergence of cycad
sections in the Mesozoic.
Conclusion: Fates of newly derived mutations of cycads follow Klopfstein et al.'s surfing model
where the majority of new mutations do not spread geographically and remain at low frequencies
or are eventually lost by genetic drift. Only successful 'surfing mutations' reach very high
frequencies and occupy a large portion of a species range. These mutations exist as dominant
cytotypes across populations and species. Geographical subdivision is lacking in both species, even
though recurrent gene flow by both pollen and seed is severely limited. In total, the contrasting
levels between historical and ongoing gene flow, large population sizes, a long lifespan, and slow
mutation rates in both organelle DNAs have all likely contributed to the unusually long duration of
paraphyly in cycads.

Background
The analysis of geographical structure and phylogeographical pattern has been a major focus in population
genetics and molecular ecology [1]. Populations descending from a common ancestral population are expected to
differentiate from each other and eventually show reciprocal monophyly. Reciprocal monophyly is a result of the
accumulated effects of genetic drift and selection when little gene exchange occurs after divergence. In contrast,
populations may be genetically similar due to recent isolation, continuous gene exchange, or secondary contact
[2]. Plant species on islands provide ideal subjects for teasing apart the contrasting effects of geographical isolation
and gene flow on population differentiation. Island populations are often genetically isolated from each other and
most island populations are small, thus facilitating random genetic drift.
Coalescence studies provide information on the genealogical processes (backwards in time) that have led to the current apportionment of genetic variation within
populations or species. Coalescence-based phylogeography uses haplotype networks, which trace the mutational
relationships among alleles within or among species in a
geographical context [3], to infer processes such as migration, divergence, and isolation [4-6]. Noncoding spacer
regions of organelle DNAs are often used as genetic markers because they are nearly neutral with low functional
constraints and are free of the complexities associated
with recombination for nuclear markers [6].
Cycads are a unique and ancient lineage of land plants
that have attracted much attention from evolutionary
biologists [7]. Cycas revoluta Thunb. and C. taitungensis
Shen et al. constitute the section Asiorientales which is a
basal lineage of this Laurasian genus [8]. Cycas revoluta
occurs in a scattered distribution pattern from the southernmost part of Kyushu and throughout the Ryukyu
Islands in Japan, and is also distributed in Fukien Province of China [9]; while C. taitungensis is the only extant
and endemic species with two endangered populations
along the eastern coast of Taiwan. The two species resemble each other morphologically; a few characters such as
revolute vs. plane leaflet margins distinguish the species
from each other. An Eocene fossil, C. fujiana Yokoyama, is
much like C. revoluta; both the morphological similarity
and the occurrence of both taxa in Japan suggest that these
species are the same [10]. The divergence of the species in
section Asiorientales is thought to have occurred some 30
million years before present [10]. Asiorientales is allopatric
from other cycads.
Both species are agriculturally important. Each year thousands of seeds and plants have been exported for use in
the nursery trade and in floral arrangements [11]. In the
early 20th Century, cycad seeds and stems were used for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/161

making cake and soup. Cycad flour is toxic and causes
neurological disorder [12]. Fermented seeds are used for
producing alcoholic drinks [13]. Unfortunately, human
overexploitation has led to the extinction of populations
of C. revoluta in Fukien Province of China [9], and only
two remaining populations of C. taitungensis occur in Taiwan [14,15]. Large specimens of C. revoluta are prized by
the nursery industry and natural populations of C. revoluta
in mainland China have been decimated by poachers [9].
In contrast, populations of C. revoluta are numerous
across the Ryukyu Archipelago and Kyushu [13,16]. On
the Island Amami-O-Shima, protected cycad forests contain thousands of plants [17]. Despite the high morphological similarity, the two species differ in habitat
preference. Cycas revoluta usually grows along coasts, often
subject to salt spray. In contrast, C. taitungensis grows on
cliffs along riverbanks [18].
Island systems have long served as natural laboratories for
evolutionary studies [e.g. [19,20]]. Despite their often
small geographic size, islands can contain a diversity of
habitats suitable for the colonization of an array of plants
and animals. Once an island is colonized, population differentiation between islands can be facilitated by isolation, vicariance events and local extinction-recolonization
[21]. Taiwan and the Ryukyu islands lie at the boundary
between the Eurasian and Pacific plates and are a constituent of the island-arc system along the western edge of the
Pacific Ocean [22]. In contrast to sequentially emerging
oceanic islands of volcanic origin, these continental
islands emerged almost simultaneously via collision
between the continental and oceanic tectonic plates and
are geologically young, estimated at 5–6 million years old
[23,24]. Since emerging from the Pacific Ocean, these
islands gradually acquired their floras and faunas from the
Eurasian mainland [25,26]. Most island species/populations thus have close phylogenetic links to their mainland
relatives.
Today, islands of the Ryukyu archipelago are isolated
from each other. In the past, sea level oscillated during
periodic glacial cycles (Milankovitch cycles) [27-29]. During glacial maxima, the global sea level dropped by some
100–120 meters, exposing land bridges that connected
islands [30] and thus providing migration corridors
between today's isolated islands. Repeated stepwise
migrations, plus occasional, long-distance colonization
[cf. [31-33]], would allow various plants to fill newly
available habitats on islands left by the expanding or
retreating glaciers. The glacial cycles of the Quaternary
played an important role in the evolution of species [cf.
[34,35]].
In the present study, phylogenies of the rITS region of
mtDNA and the intergenic spacer between atpB and rbcL
genes of cpDNA were used to trace phylogeographical

relationships in C. revoluta and C. taitungensis. Organelle
DNAs are maternally inherited in cycads; they disperse
only via seeds [cf. [15]]. Most cycad seeds, including those
of C. revoluta and C. taitungensis, are heavy and sink reducing the possibility of water/current dispersal over long distances [36,37]. The fleshy outer seed coat of cycads attracts
animals, mainly rodents, small fruit-eating bats, and birds
which serve as dispersal agents [38]. In natural habitats,
seeds drop and occasionally disperse for a limited distance via gravity. Migration between islands is thought to
be very limited and such restricted dispersal has been documented in other island species [20,39]. Ocean straits
between large geographical regions (Fukien, Taiwan, and
Ryukyu), and channels between islands make migration
between islands unlikely in these cycads. Thus, genetic differentiation between populations for maternally inherited
markers would be expected. Nevertheless, multiple colonization and recent isolation can counter forces leading to
genetic differentiation between islands and monophyly
[20]. Many plants distributed on the island arcs of the
western Pacific Rim, including Cunninghamia [40],
Michelia [41], Kandelia [42], Trema [43] and Lithocarpus
[32,44], show little differentiation. Coalescence in island
populations can be a complicated process, determined by
counteracting effects of isolation (i.e., historical connection), gene flow, drift, selection and repeated colonization.
Given the similar systems of mating and demography of
both cycad species, non-coding regions of organelle
DNA's should provide information on species/population
histories and demographic processes as well as gene flow
and colonization. In this study, we examine the genetic

diversity within and between species and populations,
determine geographical associations and analyze phylogenetic relationships to infer the historical processes that
have lead to the current pattern of genetic structure. Several specific questions are addressed:
1. Given the long time that these species have been isolated, has reciprocal monophyly of sections and species
been attained?
2. Are populations and geographical regions genetically
differentiated?
3. Is the spatial apportionment of genetic variation consistent with a stepwise model of colonization?
4. Is erosion of genetic diversity associated with population decline? Are levels of genetic diversity in populations
of Fukien and Taiwan lower than those of Ryukyu?

Results
Genetic diversity within Cycas revoluta and C. taitungensis
The rITS region of mtDNA varies in length from 411 to
547 bp with a consensus length of 598 bp. The sequence
length of atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer of cpDNA varies from
762 to 830 bp with a 913 bp consensus length. In total,
105 and 97 haplotypes of cpDNA as well as 170 and 55
haplotypes of mtDNA were detected in populations of
Cycas revoluta (307 individuals) and C. taitungensis (102
individuals), respectively (Table 1). Haplotype sequences
of mt- and cpDNAs were deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers of FN397910-FN397954
and FM999745-FM999775, respectively.

Higher levels of genetic diversity of mtDNA are detected in
C. revoluta, f = 0.0500, than in C. taitungensis, f = 0.0038
(Table 2). Among the Ryukyu Islands, populations from
Yonaguni and Ishigaki have the highest levels of mtDNA
diversity while the diversity in populations on Okinawa
and Amami-O-Shima is relatively low. Despite its extinct
status in the wild, the Fukien sample contains much
higher levels of mtDNA diversity than any of the Ryukyu
populations. The existence of the phylogenetically most
distant mitotype, G, that occurs only in the Fukien population contributes to the high level of genetic diversity
(Fig. 1). In C. taitungensis the level of genetic diversity is
mostly associated with population size. Genetic diversity
of the Red-Leaf (RL) population is about twice that of the
Coastal (C) population. In contrast, the levels of genetic
diversity of cpDNA are much lower in C. revoluta, f =
0.008, than in C. taitungensis, f = 0.018 (Table 3). Fukien
has the lowest level of diversity among all populations,
while the populations of Ishigaki (f = 0.055) and Iriomote
(f = 0.022) have higher levels of genetic diversity.
Phylogenies of organelle DNAs in C. revoluta and C.
taitungensis
Knowledge of the process and pattern of nucleotide substitution is important for estimating the number of substitutional events between DNA sequences and phylogenetic
reconstruction that incorporates models of DNA sequence
evolution. Transition bias results in a substitution pattern
that is characterized by transition/transversion (ti/tv)
ratios typically ranging between 2 and 10 [45-47]. In contrast, higher rates of tranversional substitutions resulting
in ti/tv ratios ~1 have often been equated with transitional
saturation, in which the same nucleotide position undergoes multiple transitions, or considered indicative of high
levels of homoplasy [48]. In this study, the transition/
transversion ratios were detected to be 1.808 and 1.707
for mtDNA ITS and cpDNA, respectively, suggesting low
likelihood of saturation, although relatively low. The phy-

logeny of the mtDNA ITS region was reconstructed by
maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-parsimony
(MP) analyses. Both analyses recover phylogenetic trees
with consistent topologies. The gene tree identifies seven
mitotypes, including haplotypes A to G (Fig. 2A). Reciprocal monophyly is not supported in either Cycas species.
Geographically, mitotypes A and B are widespread (Fig.
1), while four mitotypes are restricted to single populations, including C (YO), D (AM), E (IS), and G (FU).
Mitotypes C-G are absent in C. taitungensis while mitotype
G does not occur in Ryukyus. Sequences from the two outgroups are mitotype A and do not form a monophyletic
group, indicating that sections of Cycas are also paraphyletic for mtDNA (Fig. 2A and 3A). An ML tree based on
nucleotide variation of the cpDNA atpB-rbcL intergenic
spacer identifies six chlorotypes I-VI (Fig. 2B). Chlorotypes I, II, and IV are geographically widespread across
islands and Fukien, while chlorotype II is restricted to C.
taitungensis, and chlorotypes V and VI are found exclusively in Iriomote and Ishigaki (Fig. 4). The hypothesis of
a molecular clock was not rejected at either locus based on
the relative rate test (data not shown).
Cycas species are not monophyletic for cpDNA. Haplotypes of outgroups belong to chlorotype I and are also
found in C. revoluta and C. taitungensis (Fig. 2B and 3B),
again reflecting paraphyly of the section Asiorientales. In
both phylogenies numerous mutations are located at tips
of the network, and are derived from ancestral haplotypes
at the interior nodes in the network. This pattern results in
a star-like phylogeny. Furthermore, tip haplotypes are
mostly confined to a single population while the interior
haplotypes are geographically widespread.
Genetic differentiation and population demography
Almost all dominant cytotypes of both organelle genes are
shared among cycad populations. For mtDNA, mitotype A
(95.3%) is common and widely distributed across popu-

lations, while rare mitotypes C, D, E, and G occur in single
populations (Fig. 1). Likewise, for the cpDNA intergenic
spacer, chlorotype I (90.1%) is the most common and
widespread in all populations, while rare chlorotypes II,
V, and VI are restricted to single populations (Fig. 4).
Despite the lack of physical linkage between the two
organelle genomes, high levels of linkage disequilibrium
are detected in both Cycas species (P < 0.05). All rare mitotypes (4.7%), including B-G, are associated with chlorotype I; while all rare chlorotypes II–VI (9.9%) are
associated with the mitotypes A, in the pooled data reflecting a nonequilibrium state.
Since common haplotypes are shared among populations, cycads show little genetic differentiation at the two
organelle DNA markers. Nm values obtained from Fst estimates in C. revoluta vary among pairwise comparisons
between populations (Tables 4 and 5). High levels of differentiation between Japan and China populations are
detected for all comparisons, e.g., Fst of 0.115 (P < 0.01)
between OK and FU based on mtDNA, and Fst = 0.159
between IR and FU (P < 0.01) based on cpDNA (Tables 4
and 5). For example the estimated number of migrants per

generation is high between populations C and R of C. taitungensis, Nm = 90.41 and 23.18 based on cp- and mtDNAs, respectively (60). The Nm values based on
Fst estimates from mtDNA average 106.10 which is
greater than the average from cpDNA data, 10.95 (Tables
4 and 5).
The program IM defined six demographic parameters estimated by the MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) multiple loci simulations and tested for an 'isolation with
migration' model in cycads. Of these demographic parameters, the distribution of migration parameters reveals a
peak at the lower limit of resolution in one direction from
Japanese populations to the Chinese population in C. revoluta (Table 6). When the MLE (maximum likelihood estimates) for the migration parameters are transformed into
the population migration rates, M1 = 2N1m1 = m1*(q 1/2)
estimated from Japanese populations to the Chinese population in C. revoluta is higher than the estimate, M2 =
2N2m2 = m2*(q2/2), from China to Japan, i.e., 8.0134 vs.
0.5431 based on the combined data (Table 6). The Net
(the product of effective population size and the generation time in years) value is also assessed; a higher effective

suggested for both C. revoluta and C. taitungensis, while a
weak bottleneck event may have occurred in C. revoluta
(Fig. 6A and 6B). Likewise, Japan's populations of C. revoluta almost remain nearly constant before a recent population expansion, whereas, the Fukien's population did
not undergo large fluctuations in population size until its
recent extinction (Fig. 6C and 6D).

population size is detected for Japan's populations than
China population, i.e., Net = 4.753*106 vs. 1.437*105
based on the combined data (Table 6).
In the study, the demographic scenarios for the two species and populations of Japan and China of C. revoluta are
represented by the Bayesian skyline plot (Fig. 5 and 6).
Based on the pattern of variation in mtDNA, a long history of constant population size of C. revoluta, followed by
a slight decline (bottleneck) with subsequent demographic expansion, is recovered (Fig. 5A). At the population level, in C. revolute, the Japanese and Fukien
populations also display similar patterns (Fig. 5C and
5D). In contrast, slow population growth is detected in C.
taitungensis based on the Bayesian skyline plot (Fig. 5B).
Based on cpDNA, a scenario of population expansion is

We also use mismatch distribution analyses to infer the
long-term demographic history of populations. Mismatch
distribution analyses (Fig. 7 and 8) show different patterns between the cp- and mtDNA genomes. In most
cycad populations, cpDNA has a unimodal mismatch distribution (Fig. 8), while multimodal and very ragged distributions are detected in mtDNA within all populations
(Fig. 7). Nevertheless, when sequences from all populations are pooled together, both cp- and mtDNAs have unimodal mismatch distributions in C. revoluta, while only
cpDNA displays a unimodal mismatch distribution in C.
taitungensis. Unimodal mismatch distributions are often
the result of past demographic expansions [50,51];
whereas, multimodal mismatch distributions usually
indicate stationary population structure. Since the data
used to produce mismatch distributions are not independent [52], Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and Fu's Fs statistics can be used to detect departure from population
equilibrium. In this study, values of Fu and Li's D* based
on cpDNA sequences for C. revoluta and C. taitungensis are
significantly negative, except for populations IR, KO, and
OK (Table 3); while Tajima's D statistics are all significantly negative, except for the population IR. Fu's Fs statistics are significantly negative, except for populations IS,
IR, and OK (Table 3). Likewise, Fu and Li's D*, Tajima's
D, and Fu's Fs statistics are significantly or marginally significantly negative based on mtDNA data in most populations (Table 2).
Coalescence of lineages and molecular dating
Bayesian estimates of the mutation rates and the age of the
most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the cycad
sequences were obtained using BEAST v. 1.3. For mtDNA,
all the haplotypes coalesced at about 327.3 MYA, while all
chlorotypes could be traced back to a common ancestor
about 204.0 MYA (Fig. 9). In the mtDNA haplotype tree,
clusters (A, B, C) vs. D split at some 74.1 MYA; and the
clusters A and (B, C) coalesced at about 30.6 MYA. Likewise, in the cpDNA tree, clusters I and (II, V) split some
25.6 MYA, while cluster (I, II, V) diverged from its sisters
(III, IV) an estimated 43.9 MYA. Almost all coalescences of
the major lineages predate the formation of the section
Asiorientales. Coalescent events occurred much earlier in
mtDNA than in cpDNA. On the other hand, most tip haplotypes in both gene trees coalesced recently to their common ancestors.

Discussion
Highly polymorphic organelle DNAs in Cycas revoluta and
C. taitungensis
Genetic variation in the two cycad species is high, comparable to or higher than many tree species (such as Quercus
[31,49]; Fagus [50]; Lithocarpus [32,44,51]. Such high levels of genetic variation within mt- and cpDNAs suggest
that these are ancient lineages with enough time for mutations to accumulate within lineages, given the slow rate of
organelle evolution [52]. Evidence of the deep splits in
both phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2) and the estimated dates of
divergence support this scenario. Moreover, star-like phylogenies with a mixture of long and short branches, which
represent recently evolved haplotypes, illustrate the high
levels of variation.

Although the two cycad species have high levels of genetic
diversity at both loci, the loci do not vary in concert. For
example, the C. revoluta population YO possesses the

highest level of mtDNA variation while having the lowest
level of cpDNA diversity. Similarly, the Fukien China C.
revoluta population is highly diverse for mtDNA haplotypes while containing lower than average of cpDNA haplotypes. The large native cycad population on the island of
Amami-O-Shima (AM) has genetic diversity at both loci
comparable to or even lower than most populations.
In this study, genetic diversity tends to be higher in the
south than in the north. A cline-like distribution of
genetic diversity from south to north occurs in many continental plants of the Northern Hemisphere and is
thought to be related to colonization history over glacial
cycles [cf. [34,53]]. Considering the geological history of
the Taiwan-Ryukyus Archipelago, one expects a similar
pattern for these cycad species where colonization occurs
in a stepwise manner from China northwards through the
Archipelago. Genetic diversity should decrease to the
north, assuming that a small number of individuals coloPage 8 of 19

nize each subsequent island in a stepwise manner. However, the occurrence of highly diverse organelle DNAs
across the range of Cycas revoluta and C. taitungensis, and
many other tree species of the Taiwan-Ryukyus Archipelago suggests that single stepwise colonization events may
not be the sole determinant of the overall pattern of
genetic diversity [cf. [33]].
Austerlitz et al. [51] suggest that the level of diversity in
tree species that recolonize glaciated regions is affected by
restricted gene flow but is also tempered by their demography. In tree populations, the genetic effects of founder
events are reduced due to overlapping generations and
delayed reproduction associated with long life spans.
These are traits found in most long lived trees including
these cycads, which are characterized by great longevity,
overlapping generations, age structured populations and a
juvenile phase of 30 to 50 years. During the juvenile
period when cycads grow vegetatively, newly founded
cycad potentially populations can increase in number for
many years only through the arrival of new migrants,
especially when migration corridors across islands for
migration are available. This pattern of colonization and
reproduction effectively acts to increase in the number of
initial colonizers of a given population and in turn
decreases any founder effects. Even given a high likelihood of stepwise colonization along the Taiwan-Ryukyu
Archipelago, as observed in the Pinus luchuensis complex

[52,33], multiple colonization events could compensate
for potential reduction in genetic diversity during each
founder event.
Secondary contact of ancestral lineages can be another factor that contributes to high genetic diversity. The coalescence-based analysis reveals that mitotypes F and G
diverged some 327.3 and 295.3 million years ago, respectively. Today these haplotypes exist exclusively in the
mainland Fukien (mitotype G), and in the Fukien and Ishigaki (mitotype F) populations. Mitotype F is common in
the Fukien population, suggesting an origin most likely
on the Asian mainland with subsequent dispersal northward onto Ishigaki. Such secondary contact of divergent
lineages is consistent with a U-shaped site-frequency distribution according to Wakeley and Aliacar's simulations
(Fig. 8) [54].
Isolation and lack of geographical subdivision
Current gene flow between islands is greatly restricted due
to their geographical isolation and the low dispersability
of cycad seeds in water [36]. Thus, one expects that island
populations should be significantly differentiated from
each other. But, like many other tree species of the Taiwan-Ryukyu Archipelago [33], no significant geographical
differentiation is detected between cycad populations
among islands. Fst values are small and all pairwise Nm
values, deduced from Fst values, are much greater than
one (Tables 4 and 5). The Nm values based on mtDNA
data are about ten-fold greater than those based on
cpDNA sequences, 106.10 vs. 10.95. While both
organelles are transmitted only via seeds, the difference in
Nm values determined from cp- and mtDNAs coupled
with deviation from an isolation-by-distance model, and
the lack of geographical subdivision and genetic differentiation, suggest that the two loci are responding to different evolutionary forces.

Clearly, Nm values cannot be interpreted as current gene
flow between populations. These high Nm values likely
represent either ancient migration events or shared ancestral polymorphisms [55,56]. For example, the Nm values
between Chinese and Japanese populations range from

3.87 to 7.31 (mtDNA) and 1.87 to 10.25 (cpDNA)
(Tables 4 and 5). Testing of 'isolation with migration'
(IM), nevertheless, reveals asymmetrical, historical gene
flow with more migrants of C. revoluta from Japan to
China than vice versa, 8.0134 vs. 0.5431 based on combined data. These results suggest long periods of isolation
with limited genetic exchange between the two geographical regions. C. taitungensis shows a similar asymmetric
pattern of ancient gene flow. Migration is estimated to be
more frequent from population C to population RL
(3.86445 vs. 41.10288, cpDNA, and 2.25430 vs.
48.99630, mtDNA), contributing to the lack of genetic
differentiation between populations, as indicated by Fst
values of 0.0056 (cpDNA) and 0.021 (mtDNA) [cf. [55]].
Like other island species, cycad populations were colonized via founders from neighboring islands or the mainland. Today, deep water channels hinder seed dispersal
among islands and most seed dispersal occurs only within
islands. However, during the glacial maxima [cf. [29]], sea
levels were much lower and migration could have
occurred among islands. The rise of sea levels during gla-

cial retreats terminated between-island seed exchange and
isolated cycad populations of the Ryukyu Archipelago
from each other [57]. The time since isolation approximates 200–400 cycad generations. Given the very short
time that populations have been isolated and the low rate
of molecular evolution for both organelle loci, it is not
surprising that populations show genetic coherence. A
recent simulation study [51] indicates that tree populations can remain genetically similar even with an isolation-by-distance pattern of colonization and can yield a
phylogeographical pattern with little differentiation, here
for the cycads of the Taiwan-Ryukyu Archipelago. The
high levels of nucleotide diversity in both organelle DNAs
and the existence of the highest number of private cytotypes suggest that population IS of the south Ryukyu and
population RL of Taiwan may have acted as glacial refugia
for C. revoluta and C. taitungensis, respectively.
Paraphyly of loci in Cycas species and sections

each other due to recent historical gene flow (Table 6),

been isolated for very long periods of time, one would
expect monophyly at the sectional level. Nevertheless,
both mt- and cpDNAs are paraphyletic or polyphyletic
between section Asiorientales and its sisters. Such lack of
reciprocal monophyly between taxa may result from selection, e.g., the S locus of Brassica [58], and a-tubulin genes
of Miscanthus [59], lineage sorting [60], or hybridization/
introgression [61]. Genetic exchange among species via
hybridization and introgression introduces foreign alleles
into a species or population and can result in a genetic
admixture. In contrast, lineage sorting occurs when populations or species are recently diverged and retain ancestral
polymorphisms [cf. [5,52]].
Hybridization and/or lineage sorting are likely causes of
shared polymorphisms in Cycas given that these are neutral loci and thus not under strong selection. Discerning
between hybridization and lineage sorting can be difficult
[61-64], since most statistical analyses have limited
power. However, in this study neither hypothesis can by
itself explain the current patterns of genetic variation
among sections. First, all four Cycas species are allopatric
which greatly reduce the possibility of recent recurrent
interspecific hybridization. Lineage sorting can result in
shared polymorphism but requires a relatively short time

of isolation. The fossil record indicates that the sections of
Cycas have been diverged for 30 million years, making
such a scenario unlikely [10].
The pattern of coalescing DNA segments provides information on the genealogical processes that occur within
populations [4,65,66]. The star-like phylogeny of the
organelle trees shows that recently derived haplotypes are
numerous, external on the networks and are geographically restricted. Ancestral haplotypes are found at interior
nodes, and are geographically more widespread than the
recently derived tip haplotypes. This pattern is consistent
with a birth-and-death model where most mutations go
extinct with only very few ancestral polymorphisms surviving to become dominant [67]. If the dynamics of mutations and fixation do not follow a birth and death model,
one expects topologies with deep splits for most haplotypes.
The pattern of mutations in cycads follows a 'surfing'
model [68], which predicts that a majority of new mutations do not spread geographically and either remain at
low frequencies or are lost by genetic drift. Only successful
'surfing mutations' can reach high frequencies and eventually occupy a large geographical region [69]. In this

model both population size and migration rate determine
the success of new mutations. Deme size not only affects
the probability of a mutation to 'surf' but also determines
its final frequency and spatial distribution. When the
effective population size is small, a mutation within a
population has a high probability of extinction due to
genetic drift and it is able to spread only if it reaches a very
high frequency by chance. In contrast, large effective population sizes counter genetic drift while a large number of
exchanged migrants between neighboring demes prevents
a mutation from reaching high local frequencies [68].
Accordingly, as most cycad populations were probably
large (Fig. 5 and 6), one expects to observe numerous
recently derived mutations that were derived from a single
ancestral haplotype, and the observation that few haplotypes appear to survive over long periods (Fig. 2). Most of
the new mutations appear to be ephemeral and can be lost
from a population or species during population contraction (the glacial maximum). As a consequence, very few
cytotypes, e.g., mitotypes A, and B, and chlorotypes I, and
III, survived and became dominant across the cycad populations. Such a birth-and death process corresponding to
demographic fluctuations may have occurred regularly in
cycads over repeated glacial cycles. As a result, the exist-

ence of rare and geographically restricted cytotypes contributes to the high levels of genetic diversity within
populations and within species, whereas, they played very
minor roles in differentiating populations or species from
each other due to their rarity.
While the surfing phenomenon explains the dominance
of widespread haplotypes and low genetic differentiation
between cycad populations, it does not explain shared
ancestral polymorphisms between sections. Both genetic
drift and changes in population size have most likely
influenced polymorphism as well. Population contraction-expansion, which has occurred regularly in the Quaternary, provides an opportunity for rapid stochastic loss
or fixation of alleles (haplotypes). Rapid population
growth and expansion in cycads is suggested by the starshape phylogenies found in most lineages of both
organelle genomes, or the Bayesian skyline plot and by
the observation that DNA sequences are saturated with
singletons at both the population and species levels (Fig.
3 and 4) [cf. [70,71]], as well as the Bayesian skyline plotting. A mixture of long and short branch lengths in the
star-like phylogenies could also be caused by heterogeneous mutation rates. The significant values for Tajima's D

and Fu and Li's D* statistics, nevertheless, favor a demographic expansion hypothesis [72].
Mismatch distribution analyses are also used to infer the
long-term demographic history of populations. In this
study, contrasting patterns of unimodal vs. multimodal
mismatch are found for mt- and cpDNAs (Fig. 7 and 8).
Usually, unimodal mismatch distributions are interpreted
as the result of past demographic expansions [73,74],
whereas multimodal mismatch distributions indicate stationary population sizes. These contrasting patterns in
cycads are difficult to interpret although a mismatch
inconsistency between different data sets is not unprecedented. A well-known example of contrasting mismatch
patterns occurs between expanding human Neolithic and
hunter-gatherer populations [75]; the unimodal distribution for Neolithic populations is interpreted as the result
of greater Nm values [76]. Even with a multimodal distribution, demographic expansion cannot be rejected, especially if the Nm values are small. In this study, the
contrasting mismatch patterns between unlinked
organelle genomes seem to be uncorrelated with Nm values. The ragged distributions in mtDNA are more likely
attributable to the low t (fig. 5). In cycads, a very recent
population expansion about 200–400 generations, a slow
evolutionary rate, and putative intramolecular recombination [data not shown; cf. [55]], may preclude mismatch
distribution analyses from assessing recent population
expansion. Nevertheless, Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D*, and
Fu's Fs statistics provide independent estimates for spatial
expansion, especially considering that the DNA sequences
are from neutral noncoding spacer regions.
Coalescence-based analyses measure the time of coalescence to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). In
both organelle DNAs, the divergence time is estimated at
327.3 MYA in mtDNA and 204.0 MYA in cpDNA, agreeing with the divergence of major sections of cycads in the
Mesozoic [77]. Moreover, the split of the common haplotypes, mitotype B and chlorotype I, from their sister haplotypes occurred about 21.0 and 25.6 MYA, respectively in
the Tertiary period when cycads were diversifying and
when divergence of section Asiorientales (30 MYA)
occurred. Since then the two dominant cytotypes have
persisted in cycads [cf. [55]]. The sharing of common cytotypes in both genomes is consistent with range contraction-expansion during glacial cycles where common
haplotypes could persist, while most rare, newly derived
haplotypes were lost. Consequently, both phylogenies
show topologies with few ancient coalescence events vs.
numerous recent coalescence events.
The evolution of these two cycad species is complex,
affected by range expansion and contraction, fluctuations
in population size, widespread historical and current

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/161

restricted gene flow during complex glacial cycles as well
as low rates of molecular evolution in organelle DNA. All
of these processes result in a pattern of genetic similarity
among populations, a lack of reciprocal monophyly, and
long coalescent times.

Conclusion
In summary, paraphyly at both organelle DNAs has been
long maintained in Cycas section Asiorientales ever since
the split from its sisters some 30 million years ago. Large
population sizes of the constituting species C. revoluta and
C. taitungensis contributed to the lack of reciprocal monophyly betwen Cycas sections. Providing limited current
seed dispersal across oceans, unexpected low levels of geographical subdivision are attributable to the sharing of
common haplotypes among island populations. Demographic expansion and contraction with fluctuating population sizes, widespread historical vs. current restricted
gene flow during complex glacial cycles, and low rates of
molecular evolution in organelle DNA all have to be
aroused to explain such population structuring.

Methods
Plant materials, PCR, and nucleotide sequencing
We assessed levels of sequence variation for cp and mtDNAs among individuals and populations of Cycas revoluta and C. taitungensis in Taiwan, Fukien, and Ryukyus
(Table 1, Fig. 1 and 4). A total of 307 and 102 plants of C.
revoluta and C. taitungensis, respectively, were sampled.
Cycas revoluta is extinct from the wild in Fukien; only old
trees were collected from public gardens or nurseries to
avoid sampling from recently introduced material. The
samples of C. revoluta in China were collected from South
China Botanic Garden, which had plants collected from
the Fukien wild population before extinction, which
located in the Lienchiahg County, Fukien. An additional
six native island populations were collected in Ryukyus
for C. revoluta and two populations of C. taitungensis. Two
species, C. taiwaniana Carruthers (Section Stangerioides)
and C. thouarsii R. Brown (Section Rumphiae) [cf. [8]],
were chosen as outgroups. C. taiwaniana was obtained
from the South China Botanic Garden, transplanted from
a native population in Fukien, China, and C. thouarsii was
sampled from the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute,
transplanted from a native population in Pingtung, Taiwan. Young and healthy leaves were collected in the field,
rinsed with tap water and dried in silica gel. All samples
were stored at -70°C until they were processed. The
voucher specimens (Hsu s.n.) of this research are deposited in the Herbarium, Endemic Species Research Institute, Nantou, Taiwan. Leaf tissue was ground to a powder
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Genomic DNA was
extracted from the powdered tissue following a CTAB procedure [78]. The atpB-rbcL noncoding spacer of cpDNA
and the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (rITS) of

mtDNA were amplified and sequenced. PCR amplification was carried out in 100 mL reaction using 10 ng of template DNA, 10 mL of 10× reaction buffer, 10 mL MgCl2 (25
mM), 10 mL dNTP mix (8 mM), 10 pmole of each primer,
10 mL of 10% NP-40, and 2 U of Taq polymerase
(Promega, Madison, USA). The reaction was programmed
on a MJ Thermal Cycler (PTC 100) as one cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 4 min, 30 cycles of 45 s denaturation
at 92°C, 1 min 15 s annealing at 52°C, and 1 min 30 s
extension at 72°C, followed by 10 min extension at 72°C.
A pair of universal primers for cpDNA atpB-rbcL spacer
[79] or mtDNA rITS (mito 18 s F 5'GTG,AAG,TCG,TAA,CAA,GGT,AGC-3'; mito 5 s R 5'TCG,AGG,TCG,GAA,TGG,GAT,CGG-3') [cf. [80]], dNTP
and Taq polymerase were added to the above ice-cold mix.
The reaction was restarted at the first annealing at 52°C.
PCR products were purified by electrophoresis in 1.0%
agarose gel using 1 × TAE buffer. The gel was stained with
ethidium bromide and the desired DNA band was excised
and eluted using QIAquick Gel Kit (QIAGEN). For all
individuals, purified amplicons were ligated to a pGEM-T
easy vector system (Promega). Five clones were randomly
selected and purified using the Plasmid Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Purified cloned ampicons were sequenced in both
directions using BigDye chemistry (Perkin Elmer) on ABI
377A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Primers for sequence determination were T7-promoter and
SP6-promoter located on p-GEM-T easy Vector termination site. As no within-individual variation was detected
for either DNA marker, direct sequencing with eluted PCR
products was also conducted to all individuals.
Data analysis
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the program BlastAlign [81]. After the alignment, the indels were coded as
missing data. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using
maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of the nucleotide
sequences with software PHYML v2.4.5 [82] and bootstrap consensus values calculated using 1,000 replicates.
The general time reversible GTR + I + G model with 6 substitution categories was determined to be the most suitable model by Modeltest v3.6 [83] and was used for all
subsequent nucleotide analyses. Maximally parsimonious
(MP) trees were also sought using PAUP heuristic search
strategies [84]. The length of the shortest trees was
obtained by initiating 1,000 heuristic searches, each using
random addition starting trees, with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. The equally MP trees
were then used as starting trees for TBR branch swapping.
In all analyses, the maximum number of trees to be saved
was set at 5000. Bootstrap values [85] were calculated
from 1,000 replicate analyses using a heuristic search
strategy, simple addition sequence of the taxa, and TBR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/161

branch swapping. The values of random number seed set
as 64238 and 70189 for mtDNA and cpDNA data sets,
respectively, were used to start the random number generator. Relationships among haplotypes were determined
and displayed as nested phylogenies. In order to visualize
the phylogeographical relationships, a network of each
locus based on statistical parsimony was constructed with
the computer program TCS [86]. A distance matrix was
composed of all pairwise comparisons of haplotypes, for
which the maximum number of mutations was determined that did not exceed the probability of parsimony
by 0.95 [as defined in [87]]. All haplotypes satisfying this
parsimony criterion were then connected to a single network, while those of which the probability exceeded 0.95
were resolved as a separate network. According to coalescent theory, tip nodes of a network are likely to represent
descendents derived from ancestral, interior nodes [cf.
[88,89]].
The hypothesis of a molecular clock was tested by relative
rate tests [90,91]. The null hypothesis of a molecular clock
suggests that the number of nucleotide substitutions
between two lineages would be the same. Based on the
assumption of a normal distribution of nucleotide substitutions [91], the hypothesis of a molecular clock will be
rejected with 95% significance, when the difference of
substitution rates between two lineages is greater than
1.96 times the standard error.
Population genetic analysis
Summary statistics such as the number of segregating sites
(S), and the average number of pairwise difference (k)
between haplotypes were determined. The level of genetic
diversity within populations was quantified by measures
of nucleotide divergence, q [92] and f [93], using DnaSP
Version 4.10 [94]. In order to make inferences about
demographic changes in the cycads, we employed both
mismatch distributions and statistical tests of neutrality.
We calculated Tajima's D [91], Fu and Li's D* statistic
[95], and Fu's Fs statistics [96], which is powerful for
detecting population growth [97], in the noncoding DNA
fragments as indicators of demographic expansion in
DnaSP. We also investigated the historical demographics
of populations by plotting mismatch distributions [73]
and comparing them to Poisson distributions. Mismatch
distributions for each sample were used to distinguish
between models that invoke past exponential growth and
historical population stasis. Parameters of demographic
expansion were estimated using the methods of Schneider
and Excoffier [98]. The validity of the demographic expansion hypothesis was tested using a parametric bootstrap
approach, in which the sum of squared deviation (SSD)
between the observed distribution and the expected distribution was compared to the SSD between the simulated
distributions and the expected distribution (Arlequin ver-

sion 3.0 [99]). Patterns of geographical subdivision and
genetic differentiation were estimated hierarchically in
DnaSP. Statistical significance of Fst estimates was
assessed using software Arlequin with 10,000 permutations.
Estimation of coalescence times of cp and mtDNA lineages
We estimated the coalescence time of the the sister lineages of C. taitungensis and C. revoluta split for both mt- and
cpDNAs. To estimate divergence between lineages a wellsupported rate of evolution is required. In seed plants,
evolutionary rates are estimated at 1.01 × 10-9 and 4.50 ×
10-10 substitutions per site per year for synonymous sites
of cp- and mt-DNAs, respectively [cf. [52,100]]. These values approximate the evolutionary rates of introns and
noncoding spacers of organelle DNAs. Bayesian estimates
of the mutation rates and the ages of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the cycad sequences were
obtained using BEAST v. 1.4, available from http://
beast.bio.ed.ac.uk[101]. We used the GTR+I+G model of
nucleotide substitution with estimated base frequencies,
gamma shape distribution (with six categories), proportion of invariant sites, and a strict molecular clock with
uncorrelated log normal distribution of branch lengths.
Posterior estimates of the mutation rate and age of the
TMRCA were obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis, with samples drawn every 500 steps
over a total of 25,000,000 steps. The BEAST program was
also used to create a Bayesian skyline plot with 10 steps.
The analysis was run for 107 iterations with a burn-in of
106 under the GTR+I+G model with estimated base frequencies, gamma shape distribution (with six categories),
proportion of invariant sites, and a strict molecular clock
with uncorrelated log normal distribution of branch
lengths. Genealogies and model parameters were sampled
every 1000 iterations. All operators were automatically
optimized. Convergence of parameters and mixing of
chains were followed by visual inspection of parameter
trend lines and checking of ESS values by three pre-runs.
The effective sampling size (ESS) parameter was found to
exceed 100, which suggests acceptable mixing and sufficient sampling. Adequate sampling and convergence to
the stationary distribution were checked using TRACER v.
1.3 [102]. Posterior estimates of parameters were all distinctly unimodal (although with wide 95% highest posterior densities), and all parameters were identifiable,
despite the relatively low information content in the
sequences and the small age range of the sequences.

and two current populations, and migration rates. The
posterior probability densities of these parameters are
generated by MCMC simulations, and simulations were
run with individual simulations being updated 50 million
times. Within each simulation, we used the procedure to
swap among 10 heated chains (Metropolis coupling) and
observed sufficient swapping rate while the simulation
was running. These simulations were carried out using
several independent runs, with each chain started at a different starting point and initiated with a burn-in period of
100,000 updates. Convergence upon the stationary distribution was assessed by estimating the effective sample
size (ESS) for the parameters, based on the autocorrelation of parameter values measured over the course of the
run. The analysis was considered to have converged upon
a stationary distribution if the independent runs generated similar posterior distributions with a minimum ESS
of 100. Each simulation yielded a marginal density histogram for the six parameters of interest. The peaks of the
resulting distributions were considered as the maximum
likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameter with credibility intervals equaling the 95% highest posterior density
(HPD) intervals.
