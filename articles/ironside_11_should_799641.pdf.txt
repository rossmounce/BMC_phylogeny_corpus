Should sex-ratio distorting parasites abandon
horizontal transmission?
Joseph E Ironside1*, Judith E Smith2, Melanie J Hatcher3 and Alison M Dunn4

Abstract
Background: Sex-ratio distorting parasites are of interest due to their effects upon host population dynamics and
their potential to influence the evolution of host sex determination systems. In theory, the ability to distort host
sex-ratios allows a parasite with efficient vertical (hereditary) transmission to dispense completely with horizontal
(infectious) transmission. However, recent empirical studies indicate that some sex-ratio distorting parasites have
retained the capability for horizontal transmission.
Results: Numerical simulations using biologically realistic parameters suggest that a feminising parasite is only
likely to lose the capability for horizontal transmission if its host occurs at low density and/or has a male-biased
primary sex ratio. It is also demonstrated that even a small amount of horizontal transmission can allow multiple
feminising parasites to coexist within a single host population. Finally it is shown that, by boosting its host’s rate of
population growth, a feminising parasite can increase its own horizontal transmission and allow the invasion of
other, more virulent parasites.
Conclusions: The prediction that sex-ratio distorting parasites are likely to retain a degree of horizontal
transmission has important implications for the epidemiology and host-parasite interactions of these organisms. It
may also explain the frequent co-occurrence of several sex-ratio distorting parasite species in nature.

Background
Sex-ratio distorting (SRD) parasites are able to enhance
their transovarial vertical transmission from infected
females to their offspring by causing infected hosts to
produce more female offspring than do uninfected individuals. This is accomplished either through direct feminisation of genetically male embryos or by killing male
embryos and hence increasing the fitness of their
infected female siblings by eliminating intra-brood competition. SRD is widespread among parasitic bacteria,
including Wolbachia [1], rickettsias [2], spiroplasmas
[3,4], flavobacteria [5] and ‘Bacteroidetes’ [6]. Eukaryotic
SRD parasites also occur within the Microspora [7] and
Haplospora [8]. The majority of SRD parasites possess
very efficient mechanisms of transovarial vertical transmission and do not normally appear to undergo horizontal transmission. This observation has been
explained by the theoretical prediction that sex-ratio

distortion enables a parasite to maintain its prevalence
through vertical transmission alone [9,10]. Given the
inherent trade-off between horizontal transmission, with
its demand for host resources, and vertical transmission
which is limited by the host’s reproductive success
[11-13], there are reasonable grounds to propose that
SRD parasites are selected to abandon horizontal transmission entirely.
Although horizontal transmission is not essential to
the survival of an SRD parasite in theory, there is
mounting evidence that it occurs in nature, suggesting
some evolutionary benefit. Lack of congruence between
the phylogenies of host and SRD parasite genes suggests
a degree of horizontal transmission, both between and
within host species [14-16]. The high incidence of hosts
infected with multiple strains of SRD parasites in some
populations also suggests that parasites can be reacquired through horizontal transmission [15,17] as does
the presence of very similar parasite strains in distantly
related host species [18,19]. SRD strains of the bacterium Wolbachia also demonstrate recombination
between strains [20] and do not appear to suffer from

the genomic degeneration characteristic of vertically
transmitted mutualistic endosymbionts [21,22].
A growing body of direct empirical evidence also indicates that some bacterial SRD parasites are capable of
horizontal transmission. Horizontal transmission occurs
under natural conditions in the male-killing SRD bacterium Arsenophonus nasoniae, a parasite that is transmitted horizontally between larvae of its parasitoid host
Nasonia vitripennis when multiple females lay their eggs
in the same insect pupa [23,24]. Parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia also undergo natural horizontal transmission between larval Trichogramma parasitoids
feeding within the same butterfly egg [25] and feminising Wolbachia can be transmitted through blood-blood
contact between injured Armadillidium vulgare hosts
[26]. Male-killing SRD Spiroplasma can infect Drosophila willistoni that are fed upon the tissue of infected
individuals [27] and can also be transmitted between
Drosophila hosts by ectoparasitic mites [28]. Finally,
artificial infections of insect and crustacean hosts with
SRD Wolbachia [29,30] can be performed in the laboratory by injecting infected tissue into the body cavity of
uninfected individuals, suggesting that horizontal transmission may occur under natural conditions through
blood-blood contact.
Among microsporidia, the putative SRD species Pleistophora mulleri [7] produces heavy infections of muscle
tissue with significant pathogenic effects [31] and is horizontally transmitted through cannibalism [32]. The
feminising microsporidia Dictyocoela duebenum and D.
muelleri also produce heavy infections of muscle tissue
in their Gammarus hosts, indicating probable horizontal
transmission [33]. Although the feminising microsporidian Nosema granulosis produces only light infections, it
can be artificially transmitted between Gammarus duebeni hosts through injection of infected host tissue [34].
Both D. duebenum and N. granulosis have been discovered in recently established European populations of the
Ponto-Caspian invader Dikerogammarus villosus but
appear to be absent from D. villosus in its native range
[35]. This suggests that horizontal transmission of feminising microsporidia to D. villosus from native European hosts has occurred on an ecological timescale.
It is argued that an SRD microorganism is likely to
maintain a capability for effective horizontal transmission if it is capable of persisting outside of the host,
maintains a broad range of metabolic functions, is capable of modulating the host immune system and is able
to invade through host epithelia [24]. Among SRD bacteria, Arsenophonus nasoniae retains these traits while
the more specialised endosymbiont Wolbachia does not.
All known SRD microsporidia produce spores with
polar filaments [7,36,37], indicating the ability to persist
outside of the host and to invade new host cells.

Furthermore, these SRD microsporidia all appear to
have evolved recently from horizontally transmitted
non-SRD ancestors [7,37,38]. The feminising haplosporidian Marteilia sp. also displays evidence of sporogenesis,
can exist outside of host cells and appears to be able to
move between organs by digesting the basal membrane
[8].
An important consequence of the ability of parasites
to spread by both vertical transmission and horizontal
transmission is that the prevalence of different parasite
species or strains can be limited by different factors.
This creates the potential for several competing SRD
parasites to coexist within a single host population
[39,40]. In contrast, SRD parasites that lack horizontal
transmission should never be able to coexist in a panmictic population of susceptible hosts because the parasite species or strain with the most efficient vertical
transmission should always displace its competitors
[41-45]. Coexistence of SRD parasites occurs frequently
in natural host populations [3,42,46] and previous theoretical attempts to explain coexistence in the absence of
horizontal transmission have employed complex
mechanisms involving polymorphism for host resistance
genes and/or parasite virulence genes [43], sometimes in
combination with spatial population structure [41].
More recent theoretical studies have analysed models
including SRD parasites capable of both vertical and
horizontal transmission. Engelstadter and Hurst [47]
consider a male-killing parasite that is capable of sexual
transmission from males to females while Yamauchi et
al [48] consider the case of a feminising parasite with
some paternal transmission. In both cases, horizontal
transmission occurs only through adult males and so
SRD and horizontal transmission are mutually exclusive.
Both studies conclude that the trade-off between SRD
and horizontal transmission can result in the coexistence of multiple parasite strains with different levels of
SRD. However, these models are unsuitable for addressing the question of whether SRD can prevent the invasion of horizontal transmission because neither model
attributes any fitness cost to horizontal transmission
specifically.
Jones et al [49] consider a vertically transmitted feminising parasite that co-infects with a parasite capable of
direct horizontal transmission. In this case, horizontal
transmission occurs through females and so SRD and
horizontal transmission are not mutually exclusive. A
fitness cost, in terms of virulence, is also attributed to
horizontal transmission. This study draws the conclusion that a vertically transmitted feminising parasite can
select for increased virulence in a co-infecting horizontally transmitted parasite. However, the model does not
consider the case of a parasite capable of both vertical
and horizontal transmission and also ignores horizontal

Ironside et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:370

parasite transmission through male hosts. It is therefore
unsuitable for investigating tradeoffs between horizontal
transmission and feminisation.
The empirical examples given above suggest that
under certain conditions the capability for horizontal
transmission may have been retained or re-evolved by
SRD parasites. In most documented cases, horizontal
transmission of SRD parasites occurs through direct
contact between infected and uninfected hosts (cannibalism or blood-blood contact), suggesting that horizontal transmission is a density-dependent process. Models
assuming frequency-dependent forms of horizontal
transmission, such as sexual transmission or paternal
inheritance, are more tractable. However, such models
lack biological realism in the case of SRDs since, to the
authors’ knowledge, there are no documented cases of
sexual transmission or paternal inheritance in feminising
or male-killing parasites. Given that horizontal transmission via cannibalism or blood-blood contact can occur
via male or female hosts, a biologically realistic model
must also consider transmission through both sexes.
The production of analytically tractable models typically
also requires assumptions such as complete efficiency of
feminisation or the production of a 1:1 sex ratio by
uninfected hosts. Such assumptions are demonstrably
invalid for many of the systems in which sex-ratio distortion actually occurs. In the well-studied case of the
microsporidian parasite Nosema granulosis, for example,
the sex-ratio of uninfected Gammarus duebeni hosts is
biased [42] and only a proportion of infected embryos
are feminised [50]. Given that the effectiveness of feminisation as a means of enhancing vertical transmission
depends crucially upon the host sex ratio and efficiency
of feminisation, reducing these parameters to constants
clearly limits the applicability of a model to real hostparasite systems.
In this theoretical study we produce a general model
of a host-parasite system in which parasites are capable
of vertical transmission, feminisation and horizontal
transmission via direct contact between infected and
uninfected hosts. Simulation, with biologically realistic
parameters, is used to examine the effects of varying
host and parasite parameters upon the ability of parasites to invade and persist within host populations.

form of models produced by Anderson & May (1981)
except that the host population is assumed to be dioecious and its birth rate is a function of the number of
females. The division of the host population into males
and females allows the effects of a feminising parasite
upon the population sex ratio to be included in the
model. Equations were derived and examined in Maple

population that harbours a single feminising parasite at
prevalence y consists of Xm uninfected males, Xf uninfected females, Y m infected males and Y f infected
females. A proportion ε of the offspring of infected
females acquires the parasite by vertical transmission
and a proportion θ of male offspring infected by vertical transmission are feminised while the remainder
become infected males. Horizontal transmission is
assumed to occur either through direct contact
between infected and uninfected hosts or through the
transmission of short-lived parasite spores between
hosts via an environmental medium such as air, water
or food. Following the methodology of Anderson &
May (1981), the rate of horizontal transmission is considered to be directly proportional to the rate at which
uninfected hosts encounter infected hosts and has the
proportionality constant b. Encounters between males
and females are unbiased and proportional to their
density in the population. The net rate of horizontal
transmission to uninfected male hosts is therefore bXm
(Ym+Yf) and the net rate of horizontal transmission to
female hosts is bXf(Ym+Yf). The parasite imposes a viability cost upon infected hosts such that the parasiteinduced death rate is a. This viability cost applies
equally to infected male hosts and infected female
hosts. The rate at which infected hosts clear the parasite, regaining uninfected status, is b.
When two feminising parasites (parasite 1 and parasite
2) occur within the same population of hosts, the vertical transmission efficiency, feminisation efficiency, virulence, horizontal transmission efficiency and rate of
clearance of parasite 1 are respectively defined as ε1, θ1,
a1, b1 and b1. The number of infected males is Ym and
the number of infected females is Yf. Parasite 2 has the
equivalent parameters ε2, θ2, a2, b2 and b2 and infects
Zm males and Zf females. If one parasite infects a host
that is already infected with the other parasite, the invader displaces the resident (i.e. superinfection occurs)
with probability μ1 (invading parasite 1 displaces resident parasite 2) or μ2 (invading parasite 2 displaces resident parasite 1). Hence the dynamics of a population
infected with both parasites can be described by the following set of equations (1-7):

Application of the model to Nosema granulosis

The model was instantiated using parameters estimated
for the feminising microsporidian parasite Nosema granulosis in the crustacean host Gammarus duebeni. The
parasite parameters (ε = 0.84, θ = 0.66, a = 0.001, b = 0,
g = 0) were derived from data published by Terry et al.
[50] while the host parameters (a = 2, b 0 = 0.12, s =
0.000042, g = 0.27, K = 10000) were derived from data
published by Kelly et al. [54]. Competition between
parasite strains that differed with regard to horizontal
transmission and virulence but were otherwise similar
was simulated by making a parasite’s virulence a a linear function of its vertical transmission ε and its horizontal transmission b such that:
α = λε + σβ

(8)

where l and s are constants, and allowing b to vary
between strains.
This parameter set was used initially to investigate the
sensitivity of an N. granulosis-like parasite’s basic rate of
increase to changes in the rate parameters a, b, g, ε and
θ. Each parameter was varied independently while the
other parameters were held at default N. granulosis

values. Parameter sets for mutant N. granulosis-like
parasites, capable of horizontal transmission but with
increased virulence were also generated. These were
used to examine the impact of infection with feminizing
parasites upon the host population’s density and the
effect of varying the level of superinfection upon the
ability of two parasites to coexist. Finally, simulations
were conducted in which an N. granulosis-like parasite
without vertical transmission was allowed to attain equilibrium prevalence in host populations of sizes between
0 and 1000 individuals. A mutant was then introduced
for which the virulence associated with vertical transmission (s) varied between 0 and 300. For every value
of s, the level of horizontal transmission that provided
the highest rate of increase (b*) was calculated. This
allowed the model to be used to investigate conditions
under which a population containing a solely vertically
transmitted parasite could be invaded by a horizontally
transmitted mutant.

R1 > R0

That is, a feminising, vertically transmitted parasite
can only invade a population of hosts if it causes the
number of infected daughters produced by an infected
female to exceed the number of uninfected daughters
produced by an uninfected female [44,45,55]. If the host
population is at equilibrium density then R0 = 1 and so
inequality 12 becomes R1 > 1. This is equivalent to the
conditions given for invasion and persistence of a horizontally transmitted parasite by Anderson and May [56]
and of a parasite with horizontal and vertical transmission by Lipsitch et al. [57]. The maximum level of virulence possible if a vertically transmitted feminiser is to
maintain its prevalence depends, crucially upon the sex
ratio produced by uninfected hosts (g) as well as upon
the parasite’s rates of vertical transmission and feminisation [44,52,55].
The basic rate of increase of a feminising parasite with
vertical and horizontal transmission (R1) is derived as

Results
R1 =

Host population dynamics

The carrying capacity K of the uninfected population
occurs at the equilibrium point H* at which densitydependent mortality prevents further growth of the
population such that:
H∗ = K ≡ (ag − b0 )/s

(9)

The net rate of increase in the number of uninfected
female hosts in the population (R0) is found by dividing
the number of female offspring produced by a single
uninfected female by the death rate of uninfected
females in an uninfected population of size H. This
gives the equation:
R0 =

ag
b0 + sH

(10)

A parasite lacking horizontal transmission is not transmitted through male hosts and so its basic reproductive
rate (R 1 ) is found by dividing the number of infected
female offspring produced by a single infected female by
the rate at which infected females are lost from the
population due to natural mortality, parasite virulence
or recovery. This gives the equation:
R1 =

aε(θ + g − θ g)
b0 + sH + α + γ

(11)

Invasion conditions for such a vertically transmitted
feminising parasite are:

β(Xm + Xf ) + aε(θ + g − θ g)
b0 + sH + α + γ

(13)

and it can invade a population of uninfected hosts at
equilibrium if R1 > 1. This condition specifies that a single infected individual in an otherwise uninfected population must give rise to at least one infected individual,
following Lipsitch et al. [57]. The invasion success of
the parasite with horizontal transmission therefore
depends not only upon the sex ratio produced by uninfected hosts but also upon the availability of uninfected
hosts and therefore initially by the density of the host
population. If a parasite is unable to invade through vertical transmission alone (i.e. R1 as defined in equation
11 is less than one) then horizontal transmission will
only allow it to invade if

Horizontal transmission depends upon the production
of infective stages, a process that depletes the host’s
energy resources and often causes damage to host tissues. High rates of horizontal transmission are therefore
predicted to reduce the lifetime reproductive success of
infected hosts and hence to reduce the efficiency of vertical transmission. If vertical transmission and horizontal
transmission both impose linear viability costs and these
costs are additive then:
α = λε + σβ

(15)

where the constant l defines the slope of the increase
in virulence with vertical transmission and s defines the

capacity of a parasite to invade a host population if:
(16)

The maximum virulence at which a parasite is able to
invade by horizontal transmission therefore depends
upon the density of uninfected hosts in the population.
The greater the cost of horizontal transmission, the
higher the host density must be in order for the parasite
to benefit from horizontal transmission.

In addition to increasing a parasite’s rate of vertical

Competitive exclusion of one parasite by another has
been demonstrated analytically in simpler models where
both parasites are solely vertically transmitted (b1 = b2
= 0) [44] or both parasites are solely horizontally transmitted (ε1 = ε2 = 0) [56]. Simulations performed using
the current model under the conditions b1 = b2 = 0 or
ε1 = ε2 = 0 confirmed these results. However, for cases
in which one or both parasites are capable of both vertical and horizontal transmission, simulations often indicated stable coexistance of two feminising parasites
under conditions in which the parasite with the most
effective vertical transmission had the least effective horizontal transmission. Under these conditions, the spread
of one parasite is limited by the host’s sex ratio while
the spread of the other parasite is limited by the host’s
population density. This finding accords with the convention that as long as two competitors are limited by
different factors, coexistence is possible [58].
A simulation in which two parasites achieved stable
coexistence within 1000 host generations is presented in
Figure 1. In order for these conditions to be met, the
parasite with the lowest reproductive rate in an uninfected host population must have a reproductive rate
greater than 1 in a population in which its competitor
occurs at equilibrium prevalence. These conditions are
likely to occur when the first parasite is a feminiser with
superior vertical transmission and the second parasite
has superior horizontal transmission. This is because the
presence of a feminising parasite can increase the host
population’s growth rate and hence its equilibrium
density.
The rate parameters a, b, g, θ and ε all affect the
ability of a feminising parasite to invade, persist and
compete with other parasites within a host population
(Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). These factors act both through
their direct effects upon the parasite’s basic rate of
increase, and indirectly, by altering the equilibrium
density of the host population. Any increase in the
basic rate of increase of a feminising parasite will tend
to increase the equilibrium density of the host

Figure 6 A simulation demonstrating the interaction of two
feminising parasites and their joint effects upon the density of
a host population. Parasite 2 is capable of both vertical and
horizontal transmission (ε = 0.7, θ = 0.2, a = 0.02, b = 0.0002) but is
unable to invade a host population (a = 2.3, g = 0.5, b0 = 0.12, s =
0.000042) at its uninfected equilibrium size of H* = 714. Parasite 1 is
incapable of horizontal transmission but has more efficient vertical
transmission and feminisation (ε = 0.75, θ = 0.5, a = 0.001, b = 0) and
so is able to invade an uninfected population. Addition of a single
female infected with parasite 1 at generation 400 results in the rapid
spread of parasite 1 to equilibrium prevalence (y* = 0.25), increasing
the equilibrium population size (H*) to 4113. This increase in
population size allows parasite 2 to invade and achieve a prevalence
of 0.36, driving the prevalence of parasite 1 down to 0.16.

own horizontal transmission, the increase in the host’s
population density caused by a feminising parasite has
the potential to boost the reproductive rate of any horizontally transmitted parasite that occurs within the
same population. This can occur whenever the density
of susceptible hosts present in the population when the
feminising parasite is at equilibrium prevalence exceeds
the density of susceptible hosts when the feminising
parasite is absent. This occurs when:

This effect can be seen in Figure 6, based on the twoparasite model (Equations 1-7) instantiated with data
from the feminizing microsporidian Nosema granulosis.
This illustrates the effect that changes in host population size can have upon the outcome of competition
between horizontally and vertically transmitted parasite
strains. By increasing the host’s population density, a
vertically transmitted feminising parasite can facilitate
the invasion of a horizontally transmitted parasite. In
cases in which two parasites coexist, the presence of a
feminiser also allows a horizontally transmitted parasite
to evolve higher virulence.
Where horizontal transmission occurs, superinfection
can also play an important role in determining the outcome of competitive interactions between two feminising parasites (Figures 7, 8, 9). Unless the second parasite
to invade a population is very effective at displacing its
rival through superinfection (μ2 ®1), its ability to invade
a population by horizontal transmission is less than
when it is the only parasite in the population. This is
because a proportion of the population’s female hosts

are therefore less susceptible to infection. The ability of
a parasite to benefit from superinfection depends upon
the efficiency of its horizontal transmission and so high
levels of superinfection will generally favour parasites
with high levels of horizontal transmission and hence
with high levels of virulence.

exclude any horizontally transmitted mutant as long as
there is a significant cost to horizontal transmission in
terms of virulence (Figure 10). Within this parameter
region, b* = 0 and the basic rate of increase of the
mutant (R2) is less than one for all non-zero values of b.
In large populations where the virulence cost of horizontal transmission is low, a narrow zone exists in
which a horizontally transmitted mutant can exclude
the original, solely vertically transmitted parasite. For
parameters within this zone, b* > 0 and R 2 > 1 when
the original parasite occurs at equilibrium prevalence
(y*). However, the basic rate of increase of the solely
vertically transmitted parasite (R1) is less than one when
the mutant is at equilibrium prevalence (z*). Finally, a
sizeable intermediate parameter region exists within
which b* > 1 and R2 > 1 at y* but R1 > 1at z*. Simulations indicate that, within this zone, coexistence of
solely vertically transmitted feminisers with horizontally
transmitted mutants can occur.

Discussion
Our model indicates that low levels of horizontal transmission can benefit a feminising parasite by increasing
its ability to displace a rival parasite or by allowing it to
coexist with another parasite that has superior vertical
transmission. These benefits accrue even when horizontal transmission is costly relative to vertical

population size (H) required for a horizontally transmitted
mutant (parasite 2) to invade a population of vertically
transmitted feminising parasites (parasite 1) at equilibrium
prevalence. In zone A, parasite 1 excludes parasite 2 and so the
optimal level of horizontal transmission (b*) is 0. In zone B, parasites
1 and 2 coexist stably when horizontal transmission of parasite 2 =
b*. In zone C, parasite 2 invades and displaces parasite 1 when
horizontal transmission of parasite 2 = b*. Parameters for parasite 1
are estimated from Nosema granulosis infecting Gammarus duebeni:
ε = 0.84, θ = 0.66, g = 0.27, a = 2, b = 0, b0 = 0.12, s = 0.000042, y*

transmission. Unlike the models of Engelstadter and
Hurst [47] and Yamauchi et al [48] in which horizontal
transmission occurs only via adult males, our model
allows horizontal transmission to occur through both
male and female hosts. This alters the trade-off between
horizontal and vertical transmission. Feminised hosts
can still transmit the parasite horizontally as well as vertically and so feminisation and horizontal transmission
are not mutually exclusive strategies. However, the additional virulence caused by horizontal transmission
reduces the capacity of female hosts to transmit the
parasite vertically, reducing the efficiency of feminisation, so a tradeoff still exists.
Because horizontal transmission is limited by the
host’s population density and feminisation is limited by
the host’s sex ratio, horizontal transmission by at least
one of a pair of feminising parasites can allow the two
parasites to coexist, even when one parasite has less efficient vertical transmission than the other. Cryptic horizontal transmission can therefore explain the numerous
cases in which several SRD parasites have been found to
coexist, without the need to invoke complex systems of
virulence and resistance genes.
The probability of coexistence can be increased still
further because a feminising parasite has the potential
to boost the host population’s rate of increase, mitigating or even reversing the depressing effect of parasite
virulence on host population density. The feminising
parasite is able to achieve this by mitigating the reduction in the host population’s productivity due to the
production of males (the “two fold cost of sex”) [59]. By
eliminating males, the feminiser frees resources that can
then be harnessed for host population growth or stolen
by other parasites. This potential for sex-ratio distorting
parasites to increase the growth rate of host populations
was predicted by Werren and Beukeboom [60] and by
Hatcher et al. [61] and is included as an assumption in
the model of Jones et al. [49]. This phenomenon is an
emergent property of our model and confirms the prediction of Jones at al. [49] that a feminizing parasite can
increase the transmission and hence the optimum virulence of a horizontally transmitted parasite by increasing
the host’s population density. Our model also makes the
prediction that a parasite using both vertical and horizontal transmission can potentially increase its horizontal transmission, as well as its vertical transmission,
through feminization.
Jones et al. [49] do not model the sex ratio of the host
population explicitly, effectively assuming that horizontal
transmission occurs only through females and that the
only effect of feminization is to increase the population’s
birth rate. They also appear to ignore the contribution
of males to density regulation of the host population.
Given that feminisation reduces the male birth rate as

Ironside et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:370
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/370

well as increasing the female birth rate, this omission
may lead to underestimation of the impact of feminization upon host population density. In contrast, our
model assumes that horizontal transmission occurs
through both males and females and that both sexes
contribute equally to density-regulation of the population size. Even this assumption may be overly conservative in some cases. In G. duebeni, for example, males
are considerably larger than females and actively predate
upon females and juveniles of their own species [62].
Hence, males are likely to have a greater regulatory
effect upon G. duebeni population size than do females
and the effect of feminization upon population size may
be even greater than predicted in our model.
Although increasing the proportion of females in a
population has the potential to increase the population’s
rate of increase, a minimum number of males (or rather,
a minimum number of sperm) is required if the host
population is to survive at all. McCauley & Taylor [63]
and Hatcher et al. [61,64] both suggested that sex ratio
distorters could depress infected host populations by
skewing the sex ratio to the point at which the availability of sperm limited the population’s rate of increase.
Evidence for sperm-limitation exists in populations of
Acraea encedon infected with male-killing Wolbachia
[65] and males of the feminising parasite hosts Armadillidium vulgare and Gammarus duebeni also suffer from
sperm depletion after multiple matings [66,67] suggesting a theoretical cost of sperm-limitation to infected
populations. However, evidence of sperm-limitation is
lacking in natural populations. Indeed, populations of G.
duebeni on the island of Great Cumbrae, known to harbour the feminisers N. granulosis and D. duebenum at
high prevalence [42], have male-biased sex ratios [54].
Judging by the predictions of our model, we consider
it likely that parasites utilising both SRD and horizontal
transmission are more common than is suggested by the
scarce empirical evidence that has been produced so far.
However, if horizontally transmitted SRD parasites are
actually rare, this suggests that the trade-off between
horizontal and vertical transmission must be extremely
steep. If the production of many spores causes little
more damage to the host than the production of few or,
conversely, if the host tolerates a low parasite load with
few ill effects but is crippled by a slightly higher load
then the relationship between transmission and virulence may be asymptotic or sigmoid rather than linear.
It is also considered likely that parasite transmission will
saturate before virulence (Ebert 1998). This would alter
the parameters under which horizontal transmission
became advantageous and might also alter the parameters under which two parasite were able to coexist.
Finally, there may be costs associated with feminisation.

Page 10 of 12

These might include virulence arising from the need for
parasite stages to infect specific tissues or to attain
greater numbers than would otherwise be optimal for
vertical transmission. An additional cost of feminisation
occurs for microsporidian parasites of amphipod crustaceans such as Gammarus duebeni and Echinogammarus
marinus, in which infected hosts suffer an increased risk
of intersexuality [68,69].
A possible candidate for measuring the separate virulence costs of horizontal transmission, vertical transmission and feminisation is the microsporidian Dictyocoela
duebenum in G. duebeni. This parasite appears to cause
two different forms of pathology. One is asymptomatic
and associated with vertical transmission and feminisation [42] while the other results in replacement of muscle tissue with masses of spores, and is presumably
associated with horizontal transmission [33]. By examining hosts exhibiting these two forms of pathology, the
relative virulence costs of horizontal transmission and
feminisation could be compared for the same parasite
strain.

Conclusions
On the basis of a simulations involving two feminising
parasites in a single host population, the following predictions are made:
Horizontal transmission is advantageous to feminising
parasites under a wide range of conditions.
Horizontal transmission facilitates coexistence of multiple feminising parasites within a single host population
The presence of a feminising parasite can increase
host population density, hence creating conditions
under which a mutant or another parasite species with
greater horizontal transmission and/or higher virulence
can invade.
