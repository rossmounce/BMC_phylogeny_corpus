Abstract
Background: Carboxylesterase is a multifunctional superfamily and ubiquitous in all living
organisms, including animals, plants, insects, and microbes. It plays important roles in xenobiotic
detoxification, and pheromone degradation, neurogenesis and regulating development. Previous
studies mainly used Dipteran Drosophila and mosquitoes as model organisms to investigate the roles
of the insect COEs in insecticide resistance. However, genome-wide characterization of COEs in
phytophagous insects and comparative analysis remain to be performed.
Results: Based on the newly assembled genome sequence, 76 putative COEs were identified in
Bombyx mori. Relative to other Dipteran and Hymenopteran insects, alpha-esterases were
significantly expanded in the silkworm. Genomics analysis suggested that BmCOEs showed
chromosome preferable distribution and 55% of which were tandem arranged. Sixty-one BmCOEs
were transcribed based on cDNA/ESTs and microarray data. Generally, most of the COEs showed
tissue specific expressions and expression level between male and female did not display obvious
differences. Three main patterns could be classified, i.e. midgut-, head and integument-, and silk
gland-specific expressions. Midgut is the first barrier of xenobiotics peroral toxicity, in which COEs
may be involved in eliminating secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves and contaminants of
insecticides in diet. For head and integument-class, most of the members were homologous to
odorant-degrading enzyme (ODE) and antennal esterase. RT-PCR verified that the ODE-like
esterases were also highly expressed in larvae antenna and maxilla, and thus they may play
important roles in degradation of plant volatiles or other xenobiotics.
Conclusion: B. mori has the largest number of insect COE genes characterized to date.
Comparative genomic analysis suggested that the gene expansion mainly occurred in silkworm
alpha-esterases. Expression evidence indicated that the expanded genes were specifically expressed
in midgut, integument and head, implying that these genes may have important roles in detoxifying
secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves, contaminants in diet, and odorants. Our results provide
some new insights into functions and evolutionary characteristics of COEs in phytophagous insects.

Background
Carboxylesterase (COE, EC 3.1.1.1) is a multigene family
and occurs in animals, plants, insects, and microbes [1-4].
COEs are mainly attributed to B esterases, which were
essentially irreversibly inhibited by organophosphate
insecticides (OPs). Based on sequence similarity and substrate specificity, insect COE genes can be subdivided into
eight subfamilies: α-esterase (ae), β-esterase (be), juvenile
hormone esterase (jhe), gliotactins (gli), acetylcholinesterases (ace, AChE), neurotactins (nrt), neuroligins (nlg),
and glutactin (glt) class [3]. α-esterases, β-esterases, acetylcholinesterases and juvenile hormone esterase account for
the majority of the catalytically active COEs [3]. Gliotactins, neurotactins, neuroligins, and glutactin classes are
generally considered to be noncatalytic but have a variety
of functions essential to development and neurogenesis
[5].
COEs have a broad range of functions; the key role is
hydrolyzing esters of carboxylic acids. Carboxylesterases
are also a class of the metabolic enzymes involved in
insecticide resistance, which are implicated in the resistance of insects to OPs, carbamates, and pyrethroids
through gene amplification, upregulation and coding
sequence mutations [6]. Furthermore, COEs also play
important roles in allelochemical metabolism and tolerance, although the roles were validated only at the biochemical level in a few cases [6]. In addition,
carboxylesterases can serve as noncatalytic adhesive proteins involved in cell-to-cell interactions [5] and participate in other functions, such as pheromone degradation
in moths [7] and hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and juvenile hormone (JH) [8,9].
Studies on insect carboxylesterases have been mainly
focused on mediating insecticide resistance [6,10]. Relatively, the mechanism of degrading plant allelochemicals
is still unclear, and only some biochemical evidence confirmed that COEs were related to detoxification of the secondary metabolites of plants. Carboxylesterases can be
induced by phenolic glycosides in Papilio Canadensis [11],
and its activity was positively correlated with the survival
rate of the gypsy moth, suggesting that esterase may be
responsible for glycoside metabolism [12]. In the tobacco
cutworm, Spodoptera litura, sublethal doses of the widely
occurring plant glycoside rutin resulted in a significant
increase in midgut carboxylesterase activity [13]. It was
also found that COEs can be induced by indole alkaloid
gramine in Sitobion avenae, and the increase of COE activity was positively correlated with dietary gramine concentrations, suggesting that COEs were involved in gramine
detoxification [14]. In addition, quercetin, rutin and 2-tridaconone can also induce the activities of COEs in insects
[15,16].

Herbivorous animals encounter a wide variety of secondary products in the plants on which they feed. They must
therefore have developed mechanisms to metabolically
inactivate some of the potentially toxic plant chemicals
that they ingest. Silkworm is phytophagous insect, and
specifically feeds on mulberry, which also encounters a
mass of allelochemicals from its host plant. Because the
silkworm grows well on mulberry leaves, the toxicities
and defensive activities of these leaves against herbivorous
insects have been overlooked. However, a recent study
revealed that mulberry latex rich in sugar-mimic alkaloids
was highly toxic to caterpillars [17]. Some alkaloids contained in mulberry leaves are potential inhibitors of mammalian digestive glycosidases but not inhibitors of
silkworm midgut glycosidases, suggesting that the silkworm has enzymes specially adapted to enable it to feed
on mulberry leaves [18]. In addition, β-fructofuranosidase was characterized in the silkworm genome, which
has been no direct experimental evidence that this gene is
encoded in the genome of animals [19]. Bmsuc1 played an
important role in avoiding the toxic effects of 1,4-dideoxy1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (D-AB1) and 1-deoxynojirimycin
(DNJ) that are present in extremely high concentrations in
the mulberry latex. In the "animal-plant warfare", silkworm has developed the mechanisms to metabolically
inactivate those potentially toxic chemicals, such as
detoxification enzyme carboxylesterase, cytochrome P450
monooxygenases (P450) and glutathione S-transferase
(GST), etc. Thus, silkworm can be used as a model of the
insect-plant interaction.
B. mori is an economically important insect and the Lepidoptera model for the study of pest control in agriculture.
Recently, the fine genome map of the silkworm has been
assembled. Totally, 87% of the scaffold sequences were
anchored to all 28 chromosomes and 14,623 genes were
predicted [20]. In addition, carboxylesterases are a functionally important superfamily, which play important
roles in insecticide resistance, allelochemical tolerance,
and developmental regulation. Previous studies on silkworm carboxylesterases mainly focused on isozyme polymorphism [21-23]. Herein, we present the identification
and genomic analysis of silkworm COEs using the newly
assembled 9× genome sequence. We have searched available EST data for each silkworm COE to confirm active
transcription and examined the expression patterns using
the genome-wide microarray of the silkworm [24]. Studying the expressions and evolutionary aspects of such large
family of COEs will help us understand its functional versatilities.

Results and Discussion
Annotation and phylogeny of B. mori COEs
Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifera COEs were retrieved from GenBank and used for blast

search against the new assembly of the silkworm genome
to characterize the COE superfamily in B. mori. Through
genomic analysis and gene prediction, 76 putative COE
genes were identified in the silkworm genome (Additional file 1). This indicated that the B. mori genome contained more COE members compared with D.
melanogaster (35), An. mellifera (24), and Ap. gambiae (51)
(Table 1).
The neighbor-joining tree of COEs in B. mori, D. melanogaster, Ap. mellifera, and some related species was reconstructed (Figure 1). It can be seen from Figure 1 that the
topology of phylogenetic tree was very similar to those
obtained in previous studies [5]. Insect carboxylesterases
can be divided into fourteen clades and three major
classes (intracellular catalytic, secreted catalytic, and neurodevelopmental classes) based on the phylogenetic tree.
The gene numbers of neurodevelopmental class and
secreted catalytic class were alike in the four organisms,
especially, the orthologous genes in neurodevelopmental
class can be unambiguously defined (Figure 1, Table 1).
Thus, this class of COEs might be involved in essential
steps in conserved physiological pathways and subject to
function constraints. While α-esterases were independently expanded in D. melanogaster, Ap. mellifera, and An.
gambiae, the silkworm α-esterases experienced an obvious
species-specific expansion: 55 α-esterase members were
identified. This suggested that this class of COEs may play
important roles in the adaptation of these insects to their
specific biological niches rather than fulfilling general
housekeeping functions.

Expansion of intracellular catalytic class in the silkworm
The intracellular catalytic class of COEs belongs to α-esterases, which function to detoxify xenobiotics and some
members are related to organophosphorus insecticides
(OPs) resistance in insects [5,25,26]. This class (clades AC) includes 55, 16, 13, and 8 esterases in B. mori, An. gambiae, D. melanogaster and Ap. mellifera, respectively (Figure
1, Table 1). Intracellular catalytic esterases in the silkworm
were in clades A and C, while the corresponding esterases
in D. melanogaster and Ap. mellifera were mainly located in
the clades B and C, respectively. All the other sequences in
clade A came from Lepidopteran insects except for the D.
melanogaster CG10175 that shared 37.7% amino acid
identity with Bmae54. Furthermore, most of the silkworm
α-esterases were located in this clade.

Intracellular catalytic carboxylesterases have some common characteristics, such as conserved catalytic triad
S200, E327 and H440, the numbering of which is that of
torpedo californica AChE [27]. The catalytic triad of COEs
was predicted by blastp searching NCBI conserved
domain database (CDD) using COE amino acid
sequences as queries (Figure 1). The results indicated that
most of the intracellular catalytic carboxylesterases in the
silkworm had GESAG consensus sequences similar to Drosophila. However, 15 of 55 silkworm α-esterases changed
one or more residues of the catalytic triad. Most of the variants of the catalytic triad in the silkworm α-esterases were
phylogenetically related to the variants of GESAG, which
formed a cluster boxed on the phylogenetic tree. Similarity analysis of amino acid sequences indicated that α-esterases with substitutions in catalytic triad shared < 30%

identity with other α-esterases, and most of them were
only about 20%. These results indicated that those rapidly
evolved α-esterases in the silkworm might lose their
hydrolyzing functions.

second introns were phase 0 and phase 2, respectively.
Thus, the gene structure of the silkworm α-esterases was
relatively conserved.

The intron number and location of silkworm α-esterase
were analyzed. In total, 111 introns were found in 45 αesterases with putative complete coding sequence (Figure
2). For intron number, most of the α-esterases (30 out of
45) contained only two introns. While Bmae1 had only
one, others contained three or more introns, especially,
Bmae54 contained eight introns. The intron locations
were relatively conserved for the α-esterases. The first conserved one was located between the 42th and 74th amino
acids whereas the second one lay between the 469th and
515th amino acids. In addition, almost all of the first and

Lepidopteran odorant-degrading enzyme (ODE) and
antennal esterase play an important role in inactivating
pheromone because degradation of odorant molecules is
a necessity to avoid the continuous stimulation of the
receptors [28,29]. Those known ODEs and antennal esterases of Lepidopteran insects were also included in the
phylogenetic analysis. The results indicated that some of
the odorant-degrading esterase were clustered with silkworm α-esterases in clade A. Silkworm Bmae33, Antheraea
polyphemus ODE (Apol-ODE) and Spodoptera littoralis ODE
(Slit-EST) might be orthologous genes, and Bmae33
shared 73.1% of amino acid identity with Apol-ODE and

64.6% with Slit-EST. Bmae35 was phylogenetically closely
related to Sesamia nonagrioides ODE (Snon-EST); they
shared 48.6% identity. In addition, Bmae32 was homologous with Mamestra brassicae antennal-specific esterase
(Mbra-EST); they had 58.8% identity. Thus, existence of
putative ODEs in Lepidoptera was one of the reasons that
α-esterases were obviously expanded in the silkworm
compared with Dipteran and Hymendopteran insects.
Secreted catalytic class
Juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), integument esterase, βesterase, and glutactin belong to the secreted catalytic
class. In this class, uncharacterized esterases were also
identified. JHEs play important roles in development,
metamorphosis, diapause and reproduction in insects,
which can hydrolyze and regulate the titre of juvenile hormone (JH) [8]. Four putative JHEs were identified in the
silkworm genome (Figure 1). Silkworm JHEs showed a
moderate expansion compared with D. melanogaster (2),
Ap. mellifera (1), An. gambiae (5) [5,30], and Aedes aegypti
(10) [31]. The phylogenetic tree indicated that Lepidopteran and Ap. mellifera JHEs were clustered together, while
Dipteran and Coleopteran JHEs formed another cluster.
Thus, this provides support for the hypothesis that there
are two separate origins of JHE in the insect esterases [30].

BmJHE1 was phylogenetically related to CfJHE, HvJHE,
OfJHE and MsJHE, and shared higher identities with them
(49.6% - 60.8%). Thus, they might be orthologous genes
(Figure 1). However, BmJHE1 and the other three BmJHEs
showed lower identities (42.4% - 44%) than those among
BmJHE2, BmJHE3 and BmJHE4 (72.0% - 74.6%). So, we
predicted that Bmjhe2, jhe3 and jhe4 were recently duplicated by Bmjhe1. JHEs contain some specific characteristics, such as a GQSAG core catalytic motif required for JHspecific esterase activity [5], a particular amphipathic helix
as for a characteristic of Lepidopteran JHEs [32]. The analysis of catalytic triad indicated that BmJHE1 contained the
specific GQSAG motif while BmJHE2 and BmJHE4 had
the GESAG, and BmJHE3 had GESSG. Only BmJHE1 and
BmJHE4 were identified to have the three Args (R 174,
181, 185) along one face of an amphipathic helix. In addition, BmJHE1 has been verified to have JH-specific esterase activity in vivo [33,34]. Based on sequence
characteristics and known functional data, we speculated
that BmJHE1 was the only one physiologically functional
JHE in the silkworm, and that those new duplicated JHEs
might have evolved other functions.
In insects, most of pheromone molecules are strongly
hydrophobic and therefore tend to adhere to waxy surfaces. Both male and female may need to remove the pheromones from their integument so that they can better
identify and control the signal, respectively [35]. During
this signaling, integument esterase plays important role in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/553

inactivation of pheromones [29,35]. In total, two putative
integument esterases were identified in the silkworm (Figure 1). One and three integument esterases were identified in Ap. mellifera and D. melanogaster, respectively,
whereas none was found in An. gambiae (Table 1). Previous study found that Apol-IE in Ant. polyphemus was distributed in adult antennae and legs, suggesting that it may
have the function of degrading pheromone [29]. Bmie1
shared 62.6% identity with Apol-IE at amino acid level;
they were phylogenetically related and may be orthologous genes. In addition, identities among silkworm and
Drosophila integument esterases were about 44%. Thus,
integument esterases among insect species showed higher
similarities and played similar roles in degrading pheromone or detoxifying xenobiotics entered into integument.
Although the number of β-esterase genes is not big in
insects, these enzymes have multiple functions, including
metabolic resistance to OPs and carbamates in Hemipteran insects [5], reproductive function in Diptera [5],
and pheromone signaling in Lepidoptera [36]. In total,
two β-esterases were found in the silkworm, three in Ap.
mellifera and D. melanogaster and five in An. gambiae.
Bmbe2 shared 43.6% and 39.1% amino acid identities
with GB11403 and CG6414, respectively, and they were
clustered together on the phylogenetic tree and may be 1
: 1 : 1 orthologs (Figure 1). Bmbe1 is the ortholog of ApolPDE (pheromone-degrading enzyme) in Ant. polyphemus,
which plays important role in validated rapid inactivation
of sex pheromone [36]. Thus, Bmbe1 may have similar
function to Apol-PDE, involved in pheromone signaling.
Glutactin is a novel Drosophila basement membrane
related glycoprotein located in the envelope of the developing nervous system; it may play a role in intercellular
ordering and adhesion [37-39]. Four and nine glutactins
were found in D. melanogaster and An. gambiae, respectively, while no glutactin gene was found in the silkworm
and Ap. mellifera. However, uncharacterized clade (H) was
phylogenetically related to Drosophila glutactin clade.
Bmun1 shared 36.2% and 32.3% amino acid identities
with CG5397 and GB15536, respectively, and the three
genes may be 1 : 1 : 1 orthologs. Whether Bmun1 had the
function of glutactin or how this function was substituted
in the silkworm remains to be determined.
Conserved neurodevelopmental class
In neurodevelopmental class, orthologs among insects
can be easily identified (Figure 1). Thus, these genes were
generated by duplication events occurred before insect
radiation and might have experienced purifying selection
process after speciation. Acetylcholinesterases (AChEs)
were the only enzymes that perform catalytic function in
the neurodevelopmental class. Furthermore, they may be
the important target of OPs [30]. In Drosophilidae and

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:553

Muscidae, only one ace gene was identified, while two ace
genes were found in other Dipteran, Hymenoptera, and
Lepidopteran insects. On the phylogenetic tree, ace clade
can be obviously divided into ace1 and ace2 subclades
(Figure 1). In the silkworm, BmAChE1 and BmAChE2
shared only 31.5% amino acid identity and 54.5% and
32.6% amino acid identities with AmAChE1, 31.9% and
60.0% with AmAChE2, 29.1% and 50.4% with
DmAChE2, respectively. However, either BmAChE1 or
BmAChE2 showed higher conservation with other Lepidopteran insect AChE1 or AChE2 (Additional file 2).
BmAChE1 shared 72.9% - 98.6% amino acid identities
with orthologous gene from Bombyx mandarina, Helicoverpa assulta, Helicoverpa armigera, Cydia pomonella, and
Plutella xylostella, and BmAChE2 showed the 91.2% 99.2% identities with the corresponding orthologs from
species above.
The major function of AChE is hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine bounded at cholinergic synapses
in the central nervous system of insects [40], conferring
target site resistance to OP and carbamat insecticides [5].
In silkworm, both BmAChE1 and BmAChE2 contained
the catalytic triad and disulfide bridges (C88-C115, C275C286 and C423-C542 in Torpedo AChE [40], Additional file
2). In addition, an inhibition assay indicated that both of
them can be inhibited by eserine and paraoxon [41].
However, the alignment of known Lepidopteran AChEs
indicated that AChE1 had protrudent C-terminal compared with AChE2, and AChE2 (position at 150-230 aa)
had an insertion of 18 incontinuous amino acids like the
hydrophilic insertion in DipteranAChE, which had 31 residues [42]. Thus, BmAChE1 and BmAChE2 showed obvious differentiation in sequence. Previous studies
indicated that the AChE2 in those insects with two ace
gene system had cell-to-cell communication/adhesive
properties [5]. Thus, we speculated that BmAChE2 could
substitute the function of glutactin due to the loss of
glutactin gene in the silkworm and that BmAChE1 had the
function of hydrolyzing acetylcholine.
Generally, gliotactin, neuroligin, and neurotactin are noncatalytic adhesive proteins involved in cell-to-cell interactions [5]. Single gliotactin gene was identified in the B.
mori genome as D. melanogaster and Ap. mellifera (Figure
1), and these orthologous genes shared about 52% amino
acid identities. Like D. melanogaster, two putative neurotactin genes were found in the silkworm. CG9704,
GB19830 and Bmnrt2 were orthologous genes, which
showed about 40% amino acid identities. Compared with
gliotactin and neurotactin, neuroligin genes were obviously duplicated in the B. mori, D. melanogaster and Ap.
mellifera, corresponding to 6, 4 and 5 duplicates, respectively. The neuroligin clade (M) contained three pairs of 1
: 1 : 1 orthologs. This indicated that most of the neuroli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/553

gins were duplicated before radiation of the three species.
In addition, except for the known families, uncharacterized group was also found in clade (M). Bmun2, CG10339
and GB18901 were 1 : 1 : 1 orthologous genes, and Bmun2
shared 40.1% and 40.9% identities with CG10339 and
GB18901, respectively.
Genomic distribution of BmCOEs
In the fine genome map of the silkworm, most of the silkworm COEs could be mapped to chromosomes. Totally,
73 out of 76 silkworm COEs were distributed on 19 chromosomes and there are 13 BmCOE clusters on different
chromosomes (Additional file 1 and 3). About 55% of
BmCOE genes were tandem arranged in the silkworm
genome. Moreover, BmCOE genes were not evenly distributed on chromosomes and about 62% COEs were massively located on six chromosomes (Figure 3a).

Generally, tandem arranged genes showed higher similarities one another and could be classified into a common
family. For instance, Bmae6 - 9 were located on chromosome 10 and shared 89.1% - 95.7% amino acid identities.
Although the Bmae5 is away from the gene cluster on the
same chromosome, it showed high similarities (about
82% identity) to the genes in the cluster (Figure 3a). Most
of the other tandem arranged COEs also showed 40% 50% amino acid identities among members in a cluster.
The tandem arranged COEs might be created by local
duplications. Tandem arranged COEs tend to form a family, however, some are not the case. For example, Bmnlg1
and Bmae2 were tandem arranged but shared only 17%
identity identities, and located in a mixed gene cluster
with three alpha-esterases (Bmae50 - 52) and four JHEs
(Bmjhe1 - 4). Thus, these tandem arranged COEs might be
created by other mechanisms, not by local duplication or
they are very old duplicates.
Neuroligins showed remarkable conservation of
microsynteny among the Ap. mellifera, D. melanogaster,
and An. gambiae genomes [25]. In the silkworm genome,
six neuroligins were found; four of six were located on the
chromosome 15, which spanned about 1.1 Mb (Figure
3b). The four silkworm neuroligins showed similar gene
arrangement to those in Ap. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and
An. gambiae. Thus, such microsynteny of neuroligins was
present in these four organisms. The only difference is that
the location of the NLG4 and NLG6 in Ap. mellifera and
An. gambia was changed in B. mori.
Expression profiles of BmCOEs
ESTs analysis
In order to detect the expression of the B. mori COEs, we
searched the silkworm dbEST database downloaded from
GenBank using the putative coding sequences as queries.
The results indicated that 47 COEs matched at least one

An. gambiae, and Ap. Mellifera came from [25]. The arrows represent gene localization and transcriptional orientation.
EST and most of the transcriptionally active genes were
specifically expressed in tissues.
Microarray-based gene expression profiles in multiple tissues
Based on the silkworm genome-wide microarray dataset
http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/microarray[24], expressions
of BmCOEs in multiple tissues on the day three of the fifth
instar were surveyed. It was found that 63 COE genes contained the oligonucleotide probes, whereas only 45 COEs
showed expression signals, with signal value >400 at least
in one tissue. The signal values of those expressed COEs
were clustered to analyze the expression profiles (Figure
4). The results indicated that almost all of the COEs
showed tissue specificity, including midgut-, head and
integument-, and silk gland-specific expressions.

The catalytic triad is the foundation of carboxylesterases
that perform catalytic function. For the D. melanogaster
and Ap. mellifera α-esterases, only GB10854 gene lost the
His of the catalytic triad. Fifteen α-esterases were found in
the silkworm but they mutated in the catalytic triad,
which may result in loss of the hydrolase activity. Based
on the ESTs/microarray datasets, most of these α-esterases
(11/15) had expression evidence (Additional file 4). Thus,

these α-esterases may acquire new functions. Previous
studies indicated that esterase gene amplification is one of
the important mechanisms resistant to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides [43]. The amplified esterases can produce broad spectrum insecticide resistance
through rapid-binding (sequestration) mechanism. So we
supposed that these amplified α-esterases may play roles
in sequestering secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves
or insecticide contaminants in diet. In addition, due to
mutation of the catalytic triad and no expression evidence, Bmae6 and Bmae28 may be pseudogenes.
Midgut-specific expression genes
Twenty-two BmCOE genes were found to be predominantly expressed in the midgut and their expression levels
did not significantly differ between male and female (Figure 4, group I). Except for Bmjhe2, all the midgut-specific
genes belonged to α-esterases. It should be noted that
Bmae3, ae18, ae27, and ae30 mutated in the catalytic triad
were also included in this class. Thus, most of the midgutspecific expression genes should have hydrolyzing function. The potential hazard faced in sericulture is the occasional contamination of the mulberry leaves by air-borne
insecticides that have been used in neighboring fields.

Tissue expression patterns of the silkworm COEs in different larvae tissues based on microarray data

Hierarchical clustering with the average linkage method was performed using Cluster software http://genome-www.stanford.edu/clustering/. F: female; M: male. A/MSG: anterior/median silk gland; PSG: posterior silk gland.

Midgut is the first barrier of xenobiotics peroral toxicity, in
which COEs can eliminate insecticides, such as OPs, carbamate insecticides, on mulberry leaves.
Silkworm is the phytophagous insect, and specifically
feeds on mulberry, which also encounters a mass of allelochemicals from its host plant. A recent study revealed
that mulberry latex rich in sugar-mimic alkaloids was
highly toxic to caterpillars [17]. That silkworm is less
affected by sugar-mimic alkaloid is due to insensitivity of
B. mori glycosidases and β-fructofuranosidase [18,19]. So,
during the evolution of the silkworm adapted to host
plant mulberry, many mechanisms have been selected.
COEs can be induced by multiple allelochemicals, such as
phenolic glycosides, quercetin, rutin. Indeed, mulberry
leaves contain these secondary metabolites [44]. The fact

that a large numbers of BmCOEs were predominantly
expressed in the midgut may suggest that these genes
might also play important roles in tolerating the relevant
allelochemicals. Like the COEs, UDP-glucosyltransferases
were also expanded in the silkworm relative to Dipteran
and Hymenopteran insects [45]. Thus, these expanded
superfamilies may represent the characteristic of phytophagous insect.
Some of midgut carboxylesterases were expressed not only
in the midgut, but also in the other tissues such as malpighian tubule, integument, head, fat body and testis.
Especially, one cluster in group (I) including seven COE
genes was found to be predominantly expressed in the
malpighian tubule. The function of insect malpighian
tubule is similar to mammalian kidney, which plays

Page 9 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:553

important roles in defending against insecticides such as
DDT and metabolism of plant secondary and other molecules [46]. Thus, these COEs predominantly expressed in
the malpighian tubule may be important detoxification
enzymes that eliminate insecticides and allelochemicals.
Simultaneously, these midgut carboxylesterases expressed
in other tissues had important roles in protecting silkworms from xenobiotic damages.

Head and integument-specific expression genes
The head and integument specific group (II) included αesterase, jhe, β-esterase, integument esterase, and neuroligin genes. Except for the common expression characteristic, these genes were also expressed in other tissues. For
example, Bmae32 and Bmnlg6 showed male-predominant
expression in the reproductive system, whereas Bmun1
was a female-predominant expression gene. Bmie1 and
Bmie2 were also expressed in homocyte, and the former
showed higher expression level in the anterior/median
silk gland (A/MSG) and the latter was also expressed in fat
body, midgut, and malpighian tubule.

ODEs/PDEs, antennal and integument esterases play
important roles in degrading odorants/pheromones, such
as volatile acetate compounds; these enzymes belong to
α-esterase, β-esterase and integument esterase [7,29]. In
addition, for the herbivorous insects, odorant/pheromone-degrading esterase may have a role in the degradation
of plant volatiles with an ester functional group [47]. Previous studies showed that Apol-ODE and Apol-PDE could
be detected in adult male antennae, but not in female
antennae and other control tissues [36]. Apol-IE, MbraEST, Slit-EST and Snon-EST were expressed in male and
female antennae whereas Slit-EST and Snon-EST showed
higher expression in legs [28,29,47]. For the silkworm,
only larvae fetch mulberry leaves and also encounter a
mass of volatile allelochemicals, such as hexyenyl acetate,
3-hexenyl acetate and 2-hexenyl acetate [48]. Based on the
microarray data, it was found that BmCOEs phylogenetically related to odorant/pheromone-degrading esterases
were specifically expressed in the head and integument of
the silkworm larvae (Figure 4, group II). Thus, we
employed RT-PCR technique to analyze the expression
patterns in larva antenna and maxilla, on which important olfactory sensilla are distributed [48], and adult
antennae and leg to presume the function of head and
integument-specific expression esterases, excluding
Bmnlg6 and Bmjhe1. The results indicated that most of the
head and integument-specific expression esterases were
expressed in larva antennae and maxilla (Figure 5a).
Except for the Bmae35, ae40 and un1, others did not show
obvious expression differences between female and male.
The antenna and maxilla of the silkworm larvae are
important olfactory organs. Thus, we predicted that these
esterases would play important roles in degrading the vol-

atile acetate allelochemicals and adaptive evolution of
silkworm with mulberry leaves. In addition, The pheromone of B. mori is a blend of alcohol (bombykol) and aldehyde (bombykal) [49]. Antennal specific aldehyde
oxidase (AOX) can degrade bombykal [7]. Bombykol was
inactivated firstly by conversion, including the oxidation
of the pheromones by oxidases and/or dehydrogenases to
the corresponding fatty acids, and secondly by degradation [50]. Thus, odorant/pheromone-degrading like esterases in the silkworm may indirectly play role in
degrading the pheromones. Furthermore, Bmae33, ae35
and Bmbe1 showed lower or no expression in adult antennae, suggesting that they may have different functions
from their corresponding orthologous genes. In addition,
it was observed that some head and integument-specific
esterases were also expressed in adult antennae and legs.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:553

So, the functions of these esterases expressed both in the
silkworm larvae and adult moths need to be further determined.
Silk gland-specific expression genes
In the silk gland specific group (III), nine genes were
found, including α-esterase and JHE (Figure 4). Bmae11,
ae43, and ae50 were only expressed in the silk gland, especially Bmae50 only in the anterior/median silk gland.
However, Bmjhe4 was also expressed in the head of
females, Bmae25 in the head of females and fat body in
males, and Bmae23 in the head and midgut in females/
males, and fat body in males. Silkworm is an economically important insect, which can efficiently synthesize
silk proteins. Silk gland in the silkworm is an organ specialized for the synthesis and secretion of silk proteins.
Due to the fact that COEs have the activities of hydrolase
and ethyl ester synthase [51], we speculated that silkgland specifically expressed COEs may participate in synthesis of silk proteins and detoxify the xenobiotics entered
into silk gland.
Other specific expression genes
In adult, the male accessory glands (MAGs) of many insect
species can produce and secrete a number of reproductive
proteins that are expressed exclusively or abundantly in
the MAGs [52]. The previous studies indicated that EST-6
(CG6917) in Drosophila is expressed in the male genitalia
and transferred to the female during mating, influencing
egg-laying behavior and possibly receptivity to remating
[53]. In An. gambiae, Agbe1d and be4d homologous to Drosophila EST-6 were also specifically expressed in the MAGs
[52]. The expression patterns of two silkworm β-esterases
in adult accessory glands were investigated. The results
indicated that Bmbe1 and Bmbe2 were specifically
expressed in the female accessory glands and MAGs,
respectively (Figure 5b). Thus, Bmbe2 may have similar
function to Drosophila EST-6. In addition, silkworm
Bmae10, ae15, ae30, ae32, and ae53 and Bmnlg3 and nlg6
were expressed in male testis, but not in ovary. We supposed that these differential expression genes in reproductive system may play important roles in spermatogenesis
or detoxification to avoid damage of xenobiotics.

Bmjhe1 was expressed in the anterior/middle/posterior
silk glands in the 4th larval instar and on day 10 in the 5th
larval instar just before pupation [33]. In addition, a previous study detected the expression of Bmjhe1 only at day
0 in the 5th instar in the fat body of seven tissues [54]. In
this study, we observed that Bmjhe1 was expressed in midgut, ovary, fat body, and malpighian tubule, and the highest expression level in fat body at day 3 in the 5th instar.
Thus, expression of carboxylesterase genes showed not
only tissue but also developmental stage specificities.

Conclusion
A comprehensive search was conducted for potential COE
genes in the silkworm genome. B. mori contains 76 COE
genes, the largest number of COE genes among insects
investigated. Relative to Dipteran and Hymenopteran
insects, silkworm has experienced a significant expansion
for α-esterases. The expanded α-esterases were predominantly expressed in midgut, head and integument, and
silkgland, respectively, suggesting that they may participate in allelochemical tolerance and synthesis of silk proteins. Generally, α-esterases contain the conserved
catalytic triad and showed catalytic function. However, 15
of 55 silkworm α-esterases mutated at the essential catalytic residue sites, implying that they may acquire some
new functions. On the basis of tissue microarray, the putative odorant/pheromone-degrading esterases and related
genes predominantly expressed in head and integument
of the silkworm larvae were detected. RT-PCR verified that
these genes were also expressed in the larvae antenna and
maxilla, suggesting that they play important roles in
detoxifying plant volatiles. In addition, Bmbe2 were specifically expressed in the adult MAGs, which may have a
similar function of Drosophila EST-6, influencing egg-laying behavior and possibly receptivity to remating. In sum,
our results provide some new insight into annotation and
evolutionary characteristics of the silkworm COEs.

Methods
Identification of the B. mori COE genes
COEs amino acid sequences of D. melanogaster, An. gambiae, and Ap. mellifera were downloaded from the GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. We searched the
silkworm genome for candidate COEs genes using the
tblastn program with the silkworm 9×genome database
[19]. Genomic sequences that show even weak sequence
similarity to any query sequence and its flanking regions
(1 kb or more long) were extracted. Putative COE genes
within the extracted sequences were predicted using BGF
software [55] and Fgenesh+ http://www.softberry.com/.
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments of COEs amino acids were
aligned using Clustal X [56]. Positions that have a high
percentage of gaps (>70%) were manually trimmed. Phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method in which distance was estimated by JTT amino
acid matrix implemented in MEGA 4.0 program [57]. The
pairwise deletion option was used in the NJ tree reconstruction and the accuracy of the tree topology was
assessed by bootstrap analysis with 100 resampling replicates.
Expression analysis with ESTs and microarray data
The putative coding sequences of BmCOEs were used as
queries to perform Blastn searches against the silkworm

A genome-wide 69-mer oligonucleotides microarray with
22,987 probes has previously been customized for the
silkworm [24]. Sixty-three of the 76 BmCOEs identified in
this study were found to have probes on the microarray.
The expression patterns of these genes have been surveyed
for the 9 representative sample types of Chinese silkworm
strains (Dazao) on day 3 of the fifth instar, including silk
gland, testis, ovary, fat body, midgut, integument, hemocyte and malpighian tubule, and head. The detailed experimental process, quality control, consistency in
replication and data analysis for these experiments have
been described in previous report [24].

chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Each tissue was dissected and stored in liquid nitrogen
before pulverizing. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol
Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The contaminating genomic DNA was
digested with Rnase-free Dnase I (Promega) for 15 min at
37°C. The RNA samples were eluted with Rnase-free water
and stored at -80°C. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase following the
manufacturer's instructions (Promega, USA).

RT-PCR primers were designed on the basis of the coding
sequences of the silkworm COEs (Additional file 5). The
silkworm cytoplasmic actin (A3) gene (accession No.
U49854) was used as an internal control. PCR amplification reactions were performed in 25 μl volumes containing normalized cDNA, 0.2 mM of each primer, 2 mM
MgCl2, 0.25 mM dNTP, 1× buffer and 2.5 units of Taq
DNA polymerase (Promega). The PCR cycling program
had an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 30 s annealing (temperatures listed in Additional file 5), 40 s extension
(72°C), and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The
amplification products were analyzed on 1.2% agarose
gels.
