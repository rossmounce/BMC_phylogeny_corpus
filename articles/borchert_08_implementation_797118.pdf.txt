Abstract
Background: Variety protection is of high relevance for the horticultural community and juridical
cases have become more frequent in a globalized economy due to essential derivation of varieties.
This applies equally to Calluna vulgaris, a vegetatively propagated species from the Ericaceae family
that belongs to the top-selling pot plants in Europe. We therefore analyzed the genetic diversity of
74 selected varieties and genotypes of C. vulgaris and 3 of Erica spp. by means of RAPD and iSSR
fingerprinting using 168 mono- and polymorphisms. The same data set was utilized to generate a
system to reliably identify Essentially Derived Varieties (EDVs) in C. vulgaris, which was adapted
from a method suggested for lettuce and barley. This system was developed, validated and used for
selected tests of interest in C. vulgaris.
Results: As expected following personal communications with breeders, a very small genetic
diversity became evident within C. vulgaris when investigated using our molecular methods. Thus, a
dendrogram-based assay to detect Essentially Derived Varieties in this species is not suitable,
although varieties are propagated vegetatively. In contrast, the system applied in lettuce, which itself
applies pairwise comparisons using appropriate reference sets, proved functional with this species.
Conclusion: The narrow gene pool detected in C. vulgaris may be the genetic basis for juridical
conflicts between breeders. We successfully tested a methodology for identification of Essentially
Derived Varieties in highly identical C. vulgaris genotypes and recommend this for future proof of
essential derivation in C. vulgaris and other vegetatively propagated crops.

Background
Calluna vulgaris L. (Hull.), an exclusive species within the
genus Calluna, has increased its economic weight, and not
only within the German horticultural industry over the
last few decades: In 2005 almost 100 million plants were
produced in Germany, of which about 30% were exported
to other European countries [1] where the demand is also
still increasing. Although merely a handful of breeders are
commercially active in breeding C. vulgaris, more than

300 varieties now exist, which are or have been protected
at the Bundessortenamt, Hannover (BSA) [2] and/or the
Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO), Angers, France
[3]. More than 50% of applications for variety protection
at the CPVO date from 2003 or later, which supports the
argument of the increasing importance of C. vulgaris.
Breeding efforts in C. vulgaris primarily aim at a special
type of its inflorescence, the so-called bud flowers (Fig. 1).

techniques, comprising a selection of 64 economic important and partially still-protected varieties from Germany,
including varieties from other European countries and the
USA, 5 genotypes resulting from crossings, as well as a
selection of 5 wild plants of different origin. Moreover, 3
different genotypes of Erica spp. were included in this
study as an anticipated outgroup [see Additional file 1].

Flowers of these plants do not open during the entire
reproduction phase from August to December which
makes them appear visually attractive for a long period of
time when not many other flowering ornamental outdoor
plants are available in the northern hemisphere. This phenotype is closely linked with and possibly caused by a lack
of anthers. This connection, in turn, has a severe impact
on breeding methods because interesting bud-flowering
genotypes are only applicable as the female parent in
crossings. In addition, there is only sparse information
and hypotheses available concerning the inheritance of
this trait. Therefore – and since C. vulgaris is a vegetatively
propagated crop – breeding in C. vulgaris over the past few
decades was to a large extent performed by selection of
spontaneous mutations, rather than by systematic crossings (personal communications with breeders). The
actual variety composition in Europe offers a mixture of
normal flowering and bud flowering types (state: 01/
2008) with main focus on the latter (~85%). Some special
forms (e.g. 'Radnor' with filled flowers or 'Peace' as a
multi-bracteate type) are present as well. However, due to
the problems described above, the actual gene pool used
in breeding of C. vulgaris is presumably quite narrow.
Therefore, in this study the genetic diversity within the
species C. vulgaris was examined with molecular DNA

In the case of C. vulgaris, variety protection assessments as
executed by the CPVO and as described in the Protocol for
Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability Tests for Calluna L.
(Hull.), LING, Scots Heather (CPVO-TP/94/Final of 06/
11/2003), comprises 22 phenotypic traits in total but only
18 traits for bud-flowering varieties, which are tested in 2
flowering seasons with 30 plants (replications). Herein,
problems arise from continually increasing applications
for protection of bud-flowering genotypes, from their partial identicalness in many of these traits and from the subjectiveness that is inherent in the measurement of
phenotypic traits. Moreover, breeding of bud flowering
types requires backcrossing, which is – in contrast to
mutant selection or 'cosmetic breeding' – 'true breeding',
but which also contributes to the narrow gene pool. Previously, these drawbacks led to some juridical disputes in
the field of variety derivation in C. vulgaris in Germany.
The problem of variety derivation and the need for an
appropriate protection system was already identified decades ago and is especially pressing in the context of global
marketing. In Europe, the Act of Convention from 1991
followed on from a Convention on the Protection of Plant
Varieties [4] and first introduced the term 'Plant Breeder's
Rights'. Today it is acknowledged by 65 member states
(http://www.upov.int, state: 01/2008). Variety protection
in these member states is based on DUS-tests (distinctness, stability, uniformity: see above). Despite increasing
testing efforts, these tests remain sketchy since the investigated traits may be influenced by several factors, e.g. environmental changes, and are evaluated by subjective
ratings so that molecular markers have become a desirable
tool [5]. But also the so-called 'fingerprinting techniques'
– although widely recommended as a supplement to phenotypic tests e.g. by [6] – entail a number of problems,
since only a random sample i.e. a subset of the genome,
can be examined. Therefore, any statistical method
applied to this problem has to be able to maintain a delicate balance in order to avoid excessive identification of
false positives on the one hand, as well as false negatives
on the other [6-8].
Several case studies have been recently published in the
context of ED-conflicts, however, for the most part these
do not concern vegetatively propagated species, since it is
generally assumed that variation in such varieties does not
occur, which would allow clear-cut molecular genotyping.

[9] tested essential derivation in various vegetatively propagated ornamentals (Rhododendron, Rosa, Phalaenopsis) by
AFLP-genotyping and constructing UPGMA-dendrograms. However, these investigations relied on the
assumption of total genetic stability within vegetatively
propagated varieties and therefore dispensed with any statistical analysis. From our point of view, this is not appropriate for all vegetatively propagated species, because – for
example with Calluna – phenotypic variations (sports) are
well-known and are based on genotypic variation. From
these experiences we support EDV-identifying systems
with respect to statistical validation as with the one introduced by [10] for lettuce and barley [11], which is based
on the definition of a minimum distance (threshold) for
distinctness. Such procedures are necessary since proving
identity is more difficult than proving distinction with
molecular markers [12]. Lettuce is a self-fertilizer and consequently genetic variation within varieties can be
expected to be very low. Moreover total variation between
today's cultivars should be somewhat reduced due to an
intensive breeding history. For this reason, [11] suggested
that ED-conflicts should not be analyzed through the construction of a dendrogram visualizing hypothetical kinship relations, but instead by the examination of all
pairwise genetic distances within an appropriate reference
population, and then comparing these results to the distance between actual varieties in question.
As a result, another aim of our study, drawing on the publication by [11], was to implement a comparable concept
of identification of EDVs in C. vulgaris based on molecular
data resulting from RAPD and iSSR techniques. Our system proposal is critically evaluated with regard to essential
premises e.g. variation and stability [13], its success in C.
vulgaris, and its practicability in the future.
The results presented here were obtained during a BMWi(Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology) funded
cooperation between the IGZ and a German breeding
company (Heidepflanzen Peter de Winkel, http://
www.dewinkel.de). Thus, variety denotation is ciphered
in cases where the breeder's interests may be affected.

Results
Estimation of genetic diversity and kinship relations within
C. vulgaris
Using RAPD- and iSSR-techniques, we achieved a total of
129 (RAPD) and 39 (iSSR) distinguishable and reproducible bands. This corresponds to 9.9 bands/RAPD primer
and 7.8 bands/iSSR primer. The combined results of
RAPD and iSSR studies are shown in the dendrogram in
Fig. 2. While the three Erica genera do cluster as an outgroup, all tested genotypes from the Calluna species cluster to the right of one node. Interestingly, the wild-types
from Thuringia (Ruhla) and from the Italian Alps (San
Remo) cluster as an additional outgroup within the Cal-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/56

luna species while the other wild-types available (Löhnstein, Niederohe, Tiefenthal, all from the Lüneburger
Heide in Germany) are grouped within the rest of the Calluna genotypes.
The statistical significance of our data was investigated
with the resampling method of bootstrapping as initially
described by [14] using the software Winboot and n =
10,000 replications. Those few nodes with moderate support (50% < p < 85%), as well as strong support (p ≥
85%), which appeared both in the NTSYSpc-constructed
tree as well as in the majority-rule consensus tree of Winboot, are marked with * and **, respectively, in Fig. 2. The
linked genotypes to the right of these nodes may be considered to be linked in real kinship. Despite the high
number of analyzed bands, all other linkages are statistically unconfirmable within the present data set.
Identifying EDVs in C. vulgaris
Due to former juridical conflicts concerning property
rights of varieties in the genus Calluna we endeavored to
develop a reliable statistical system for identifying EDVs
in this species based on the results from the first part of
our study. Since the dendrogram analysis did not support
statistically significant decisions on kinship relations and
probably would not do so even after analysis with a
clearly expanded data set, we decided to implement a
method based on a procedure published by [11] for similar analyses in lettuce. We therefore created appropriate
Reference Sets of 25 varieties (Table 1) for each pair of
tested genotypes (Test Set) in question and then computed primer-wise and pair-wise similarity values within
each set. The Test Sets were chosen to represent nonambiguous EDV or clear non-EDV cases for proof of concept, as well as several cases of interest in Calluna (Table
2). This non-ambiguousness was derived from personal
communications with the involved breeding company in
case of the EDV-pair. The test of a BC1 against the parents
as a clear non-EDV case was performed with our own
crossings.

After extensive testing we selected a threshold provided by
the highest Dice value of the 98% lowest values of all pairwise comparisons within the reference set (Fig. 3). This
threshold was chosen in order to prevent the BC1 individual from being categorized as essentially derived from the
backcross parent which constitutes an essential prerequisite for validation of our test since backcrossing is the normal breeding system in bud-flowering Calluna. The 98%
thresholds in both Reference Sets differ due to the necessary adjustment of the reference set according to the test in
question (exchange of wild-type genotypes against varieties from the upper cluster of the dendrogram): 98%-Set
A: 0.865 Dice similarity value, 98%-Set B: 0.893 Dice similarity value.

Nodes with strong support (> 85%) by bootstrapping (n = 10.000, PHYLIP) are marked with **, moderately supported groups

increasing numbers. Variety encryption is known to the authors and the company, respectively. For purposes of clarity and
according to their regional provenance, genotypes have been classified by symbols as indicated.

For proof of concept we tested, on the one hand, one pair
of individuals ('Maria' and Maria Hell), from which it was
known that the latter was derived from the first one. On
the other hand, an individual from a backcross progeny
was tested against both parents, which should result in the
categorization of being non-derived. As expected, the first
result was positive and the second one negative, using the
threshold as given above (Fig. 3). Moreover, similarity
between the BC1 individual and the backcross parent was
clearly higher than between the BC1 individual and the
second parent. The Dice value of the comparison with the

backcross parent was actually slightly above the threshold;
however, overlapping error bars indicated that the similarity was nevertheless not sufficiently high for these two
genotypes to be categorized as essentially derived.
Regarding the 'true tests', the results were negative for several pairs of morphologically similar cultivars from different breeders (Fig. 3), as well as for wild genotypes of
different origin (Fig. 4). In contrast, when testing the cultivars 'Melanie' and 'Anette', their genetic similarity was
found to exceed the threshold, thus confirming the public

data supplied by the BSA according to which 'Anette' is a
sport of 'Melanie'. This was also confirmed for 'Melanie'
vs. 'Sandy' and 'Annegret' vs. 'Anneliese' (Fig. 3).

Discussion
Until now, molecular data on genetic diversity within the
species C. vulgaris was only available for regionally
restricted wild-type populations [15-17], not for varieties
used in commercial breeding. An actual and urgent necessity for a comprehensive study in C. vulgaris can be
deduced from several points: the number of applications
for variety protection is currently increasing considerably,
whereas the information given in the registration schedules is at least occasionally unreliable or equivocal (e.g. a
bud flowering variety is said to be the result of selfing of
another bud-flowering genotype, which is biologically
impossible due to the total loss of anthers in bud-flowering genotypes). This leads to an ambiguous situation with
regard to variety derivation. Additionally, molecular data
are needed for concerted breeding works and the elimination of coincidence in this process.

Identifying essential derivation in C. vulgaris: Reference-Sets A and B
chosen for the Test-Sets. Set B differs from A only in the exchange of
two wild-type genotypes (Niederohe, San Remo) versus 2 varieties
('Sandy', 'Annegret') as indicated by summarizing both columns of Set
A and B for the residual 23 varieties.

Since it is technically simple to accomplish and requires
no a priori sequence information, iSSR- and RAPD-PCR
[18-20] are widely used techniques in different species;
but RAPDs in particular may be 'considered the practice of
PCR without a clue' [21]. All the same, both techniques

provide a uniformly distributed amplification of DNA
fragments throughout the genome of eukaryotic organisms due to the nature of their origin, and were shown to
be an adequate molecular tool for studying DNA polymorphisms (e.g. [22,23]). The same was true for our
investigations as we observed very robust inner-laboratory
reproducibility: here, a value as low as 0.46% of missing
data within the 77 × 168 similarity matrix was achieved.
The dendrogram resulting from the combined computation of both RAPD and iSSR banding patterns showed a
low genetic variability within the species C. vulgaris:
almost all tested varieties and genotypes are grouped at a
Dice/Nei & Li similarity value of 0.80, or even higher. This
confirmed our hypothesis of a narrow gene pool, which
was expected by the breeding experiences and methods
applied of the participating company (personal communications) and its competitors. Moreover, one has to bear
in mind that C. vulgaris is the only species within the
genus Calluna and that crossing with other genera of the
Ericaceae is thus impossible, thereby assisting in the con-

servation in nature, too, of a slender genetic diversity. We
esteem the clear discrimination between Erica and Calluna
as one argument of reassurance for our methodological
approach and consider the dendrogram to be unbiased in
the sense of an essential prerequisite for picturing genetic
data [11]. The fact that wild type genotypes from the
Lüneburger Heide are grouped this near to economically
important varieties is another piece of evidence for our
line of argument in respect of a significantly narrow gene
pool in C. vulgaris. In addition, to our knowledge, breeding in C. vulgaris began in exactly this area of Germany by
collecting incidentally originated bud-flowering genotypes. Our results might thus confirm this hypothesis,
especially since the wild types from Thuringia and the Italian Alps do not cluster within this group.
Another interesting feature of the resulting dendrogram is
that the data were insufficient to support more than the
few marked nodes (marked with * or ** in Fig. 2) as statistically significant. However, we do not consider the
amount of bands i.e. mono-/polymorphisms from our

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:56

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/56

ED issues arise for varieties that successfully passed DUS
testing. An EDV is (i) predominantly derived from an initial variety, (ii) clearly distinguishable from it and except
for these differences (iii) conforms to the initial variety in
the expression of essential characteristics [5]. We consider
it to be of paramount importance to apply a well adjusted
system for identification of these EDVs for each species,
and in our case for C. vulgaris, since the range of similarities presented in Fig. 2 proved the hypothesis of some
breeders that the economically important varieties (and
the genus Calluna in general) are closely related and
thereby may readily lead to ED disputes, as has already
been the case in the past.
As explained above, construction of a dendrogram proved
to be no satisfactory tool for EDV identification in C. vulgaris – contrary to the results obtained for other vegetatively propagated species presented by [9] for Phalaenopsis,
Rosa and Rhododendron. Another example is given by [25].
Using AFLPs, they proved that Rosa × hybrida original varieties are not more closely linked than 0.80 Jaccard's index.
In contrast, the genetic similarities in so-called mutant
groups were always higher than 0.96 (but not 1.0). Their
dendrogram assay is therefore correctly rated as a suitable
method to unambiguously distinguish rose EDVs from
their initial variety. In addition, the detection of polymorphisms between sports and the original variety may be
considered somewhat coincidental since molecular markers only cover a small portion of the target organism's
genome. [26] demonstrated, that in cut roses RAPD-polymorphisms between a variety and its sports did occur in
two varieties, but were not reproducible. Using AFLPs the
authors were even able to amplify stable polymorphisms
in sports of another variety. However, they were still able
to distinguish vegetatively and sexually propagated progenies, since amplification in seedlings constantly resulted
in a higher number of polymorphisms.

data as generally too sparse, since [24] showed that an
estimation of diversity within one population using
approx. 200 dominant (i.e. AFLP) markers is as efficient as
using 50 codominant (i.e. microsatellite) markers. Therefore, it is our suspicion, that the dendrogram method is
not suitable for EDV identification in species with narrow
gene pools.

We ascribe our differing results to the coincidence of two
phenomena in C. vulgaris. First, stable genetic conditions
– which could be reasonably anticipated for vegetatively
propagated species – are worthy of discussion in the context of Calluna, since the phenomenon of sport/reversion
(a type of somatic mutation) is well-known by breeders.
Moreover, the very narrow gene pool in C. vulgaris gives
rise to high genetic similarities, even if a new variety was
obtained through crossing, due to the fact that even quite
different individual plants, e.g. a wild type from the
Lüneburger Heide and a bud flowering variety, show a
considerable proportion of monomorphic bands in RAPD
and iSSR analyses. Such lack of genetic diversity is our
main reason for focusing on a system for EDV-identification involving a reference-set, as this is the important difference to e.g. the rose cases mentioned above: even in

Page 7 of 10

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:56

Rosa × hybrida more than 10,000 varieties exist, resulting
from some 150 years of breeding efforts [25], and they are
still clearly distinguishable. The opposite situation is, in
fact, the result of the differing breeding methods applied
in C. vulgaris: breeding for a common phenotype (budflowering) and repeated back-crossing are generally
accepted reasons that promote the development of narrow gene pools [25].
By working with a system similar to that described for lettuce and barley by [11], we were successful in both, identifying well-known essentially derived genotypes as well
as discriminating between a genotype resulting from backcrossing and its parents (Fig. 3). We considered these
results as a proof of concept for our method and additionally analyzed other test-sets whose information of origin
we regarded to be unreliable, questionable or simply of
interest. Here, information on variety derivation was primarily confirmed by our method as outlined in table 2.
Moreover, the system discriminated phenotypically similar varieties from different breeders as well as wild genotypes of different origin, thus also confirming the
hypotheses.

washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in
500 μl TE buffer. To each sample, 1 ng RNAse (Carl Roth
GmbH) was added, followed by incubation for 15 min at
37°C. Subsequently, phenol-chloroform extraction step
was performed twice and the resulting supernatant containing purified gDNA was pelleted at -20°C for 60 min
after addition of 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate and
0.75 volumes isopropanole. The precipitated gDNA was
washed twice with 70% ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in 100 μl TE. Long-time storage was achieved at 20°C.
DNA techniques: PCR amplification and electrophoresis
Amplifications of RAPD-fragments generated from random decamer primers (Carl Roth GmbH) were performed
in a Primus 96 advanced thermocycler (peqlab GmbH)
using the following protocol: 5 min at 95°C, [1 min at
95°C, 1 min at 35°C, 1 min at 72°C]35×, 10 min at 72°C.
The reaction mixture for a total volume of 25 μl contained
1× reaction buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U Taq.-DNA
Polymerase (recombinant, Invitrogen), 0.2 mM of each
dNTP (Invitrogen), 0.5 μM primer (Carl Roth GmbH,
MWG Biotech AG), 10 ng gDNA and the adequate
amount of sterile deionized H2O.

Conclusion
As a result of these findings, we would like to suggest the
outlined method as an appropriate system for EDV-testing
in C. vulgaris. Applicability to other vegetatively propagated crops should be tested, as well as the combined use
of 'fixed' and 'random/unmapped markers' as suggested
by [11]. Moreover, we recommend the inclusion of at least
three independent gDNA isolations of different individuals per genotype, since inner-varietal identity cannot be
presumed and is hard to verify, even in vegetatively propagated crops.

Amplification of iSSR-Fragments was performed following the same protocol as described for RAPDs, with the
altered annealing temperatures according to primer
length. Table 3 provides an overview of primers used in
this study; these were chosen after screening 60 decamer
primers for reproducibility. Decamer primers were
obtained as random primer kits from Carl Roth GmbH;
iSSR primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech AG. iSSR
primers given in Table 3 were chosen by referring to the
common di- and trinucloetide motifs in plants (AC/TG)n
and (AAG/TTC)n (e.g. [28]).

Methods
DNA techniques: isolation of genomic DNA (gDNA)
gDNA of C. vulgaris genotypes was isolated according to
[27]. About 200 mg young leaf tissue (stored over night
and frozen in liquid nitrogen) was homogenized in 2 ml
tubes in a mixer mill (MM301, Retsch) using 2 stainless
steal balls (Ø = 5 mm). The tissue was resuspended in
buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 350 mM
sorbitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanole, 10% PEG-6000) and
centrifuged for 1 min at 4°C and 8,000 rpm (Sigma 3K30,
rotor-no. 12148). The resulting pellet was again resuspended in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA,
350 mM sorbitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanole, 1% sodiumsarcosyle, 0.1% CTAB, 710 mM NaCl) and incubated for
30 min at 60°C. After adding 0.8 volumes chloroformisoamyl alcohol 24:1, the samples were centrifuged for 15
min at 4°C at 15,300 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a new 2 ml reaction tube and incubated at -20°C
for 30 min after adding 0.75 volumes isopropanole. After
centrifugation (5 min at 4°C at 5,000 rpm) the pellet was

Electrophoretic separation of the amplification products
was performed in 23 × 25 cm 1.5% agarose gels by applying 7 V/cm for 2.5 hours. The gel contained ethidium bromide for visualization of fragments at 254 nm.
Documentation was carried out with a digital imaging system (Biostep GmbH).
Reactions were repeated at least twice before fragments
were used for distance calculations.
Statistics: gel analysis and phylogenetic calculations
Gel analysis (band detection, noise reduction, size calibration, fragment matching) was performed with the
Phoretix 1D Advanced software (Nonlinear Dynamics).
The selection of bands derived from each primer was performed by objective criteria (e.g. thresholds for routine
band detection and matching and recommendations to
ensure reproducibility, e.g. the exclusion of fragments of
very high and very low size). The banding data were transPage 8 of 10

formed to a computable 0/1 matrix in the common [OTU
× band] layout.
Phylogenetic as well as dendrogram calculations were
conducted with the NTSYSpc 2.20 L software (©1986–
2006, Applied Biostatistics Inc.). Qualitative banding values were computed using the SimQual module with the
similarity coefficient of Dice [29] and Nei and Li [30],
respectively. Subsequent UPGMA clustering was conducted within the Sahn module, while the module
Treeview was used to visualize the data set as a dendrogram.
For Bootstrapping using the Dice coefficient, Winboot
[31] was used (replications given in the text) which finally
constructs a majority-rule consensus tree based on the
Consense module of the PHYLIP software.
EDV-testing by application of the tail principle
A system first published by [11] for EDV identification in
lettuce and barley was adapted for C. vulgaris as follows.
Since a priori pedigree information is unavailable for C.
vulgaris and the application of the pedigree principle – a
threshold selection based upon inclusion of 'identity by
descent' probabilities – was not possible, we selected the
tail principle for the identification of a threshold from a
distribution of pair-wise similarities from a reference-set.
The configuration of the Reference Set (25 varieties) for
each Test Set (2 varieties) was adapted by using the information gained from our phylogenetic results which
matches the integration of the calibration principle. In the
context of [11], we decided not to include known EDVs in

this set, e.g. mutation-derived varieties or sports, since
these would only represent extremely high values within
the reference-set and would complicate data interpretation. Both polymorphic and monomorphic markers were
analyzed. Detached primer-wise computation of similarity values becomes applicable by assuming a genetic independence between primers and a uniform distribution of
primer binding sequences throughout the genome. Arithmetic means, standard deviations, standard errors as well
as its medians were calculated according to [10] and [11]
in analyzing the inner- and inter-set-similarities and also
to define a threshold for identifying EDVs in Calluna. This
threshold was positioned in such a way that varieties
known to be ED exceed the threshold and non-EDVs do
not.
As carried out before for RAPD and iSSR values, these data
were computed for their similarity values with the coefficient of Dice (Nei & Li) by NTSYSpc 2.20 L. Only in case
of Dice similarity values above the threshold and nonoverlapping error bars, a pair of genotypes is categorized
as being essentially derived. In a case where similarity values are below the threshold or where they are above but
with overlapping error bars, a pair of genotypes is categorized as not essentially derived.
