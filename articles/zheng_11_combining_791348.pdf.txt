Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease in humans caused primarily by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and infects one-third of the world’s total population. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin
(BCG) vaccine has been widely used to prevent tuberculosis worldwide since 1921. Membrane proteins play
important roles in various cellular processes, and the protein-protein interactions involved in these processes may
provide further information about molecular organization and cellular pathways. However, membrane proteins are
notoriously under-represented by traditional two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and
little is known about mycobacterial membrane and membrane-associated protein complexes. Here we investigated
M. bovis BCG by an alternative proteomic strategy coupling blue native PAGE to liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to characterize potential protein-protein interactions in membrane fractions.
Results: Using this approach, we analyzed native molecular composition of protein complexes in BCG membrane
fractions. As a result, 40 proteins (including 12 integral membrane proteins), which were organized in 9 different
gel bands, were unambiguous identified. The proteins identified have been experimentally confirmed using 2-D
SDS PAGE. We identified MmpL8 and four neighboring proteins that were involved in lipid transport complexes,
and all subunits of ATP synthase complex in their monomeric states. Two phenolpthiocerol synthases and three
arabinosyltransferases belonging to individual operons were obtained in different gel bands. Furthermore, two
giant multifunctional enzymes, Pks7 and Pks8, and four mycobacterial Hsp family members were determined.
Additionally, seven ribosomal proteins involved in polyribosome complex and two subunits of the succinate
dehydrogenase complex were also found. Notablely, some proteins with high hydrophobicity or multiple
transmembrane helixes were identified well in our work.
Conclusions: In this study, we utilized LC-MS/MS in combination with blue native PAGE to characterize modular
components of multiprotein complexes in BCG membrane fractions. The results demonstrated that the proteomic
strategy was a reliable and reproducible tool for analysis of BCG multiprotein complexes. The identification in our
study may provide some evidence for further study of BCG protein interaction.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease,
caused primarily by Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1].
One third of the world’s population is currently infected
with TB bacillus. In many countries, immunization of
infants with bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG)
protects against TB meningitis and other severe forms
of TB in children less than five years of age http://www.
who.int/en/. However, BCG vaccination is not recommended for adults because the protection provided is
variable [2]. The threat to human health presented by
TB worldwide is increased by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains and co-infection with human
immunodeficiency virus [3]. Therefore, it is crucial to
develop novel strategies to improve the BCG vaccine or
to develop effective drugs to reduce the socioeconomic
and health burden associated with TB.
Membrane proteins play important roles in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell metabolism,
ion transport and signal transduction [4]. Membrane proteins are represented by around 30% of the genome and
constitute approximately 70% of all pharmaceutical drug
targets [5]. Traditional one-dimensional electrophoresis
(1-DE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE)
coupled with MS are commonly used to study membrane
proteome [4]. However, solubility and low abundance
issues of membrane proteins remain to be the main challenges in gel electrophoresis [6]. Large-scale identification of M. tuberculosis membrane proteins came forth
since 2002 [7-10]. In 2007, Mattow et al. carried out
membrane subproteomic analysis on M. bovis BCG
Copenhagen by 1-D SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and 2-DE and obtained 125 unique proteins
including 54 proteins harboring 1-14 predicted TMHs
[11]. In 2008, Målen et al. identified 351 proteins by a
combination of both gel-based and gel-free protein and
peptide fractionation methods, including 103 integral
membrane proteins with at least one predicted transmembrane region [12]. Recently, they also separated
hydrophobic membrane and membrane-associated proteins directly from sonicated M. tuberculosis H37Rv
using SDS PAGE and liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [13].
In general, proteins rarely function completely independently, which makes identification of protein-protein
interactions crucial to our understanding of numerous
cellular processes [14]. A range of proteomic approaches
have been adopted to analyze diverse protein interactions [15]. Blue native (BN) PAGE, a specialized type of
native electrophoresis, is widely applied to investigate
protein-protein interactions, especially for membrane
proteins [16]. BN PAGE was first described in 1991 for
the separation of membrane protein complexes from the
respiratory chain of human mitochondria [17]. Previous

studies have demonstrated that multiprotein membrane
complexes can be resolved into individual blue bands in
1-D by BN PAGE, and the protein subunits of each
complex can then be separated by various types of gel
electrophoresis in 2-D, for example, SDS PAGE, doubled
SDS PAGE (dSDS PAGE) or IEF/SDS 3-D PAGE [18].
However, identification of the stained protein spots in
2-D PAGE by MS analysis is tedious and time-consuming, despite recent advances in automation [19]. Furthermore, artifactual methionine oxidation that occurrs
during SDS PAGE cannot be entirely prevented, which
is a problem when attempting to identify physiological
oxidative modifications of complexes [20]. In 2005,
Babusiak et al. presented a novel native 2-D separation
technique that combined native electrophoresis with
native LC and could be applied to the separation and
identification of intact heme-binding protein complexes
in murine erythroleukemia cells [21]. The feasibility of
this approach was also illustrated by Fandino et al. who
combined BN PAGE and non-gel shotgun methods [19].
Wessels et al. extended this method to analyze full
length of 1-D BN gel lanes and identified potentially
interacting proteins by protein correlation profiling
(PCP) [14]. Since these methods are fully compatible
with MS/MS protein identification, they could be widely
applied in the study of membrane protein complexes.
Studies on a variety of membrane protein complexes
have been reported, however, little is known about
mycobacterial membrane complexes. Here we investigated M. bovis var BCG NCTC 5692, an attenuated
derivative of M. bovis, by an approach coupling BN
PAGE to LC-MS/MS to analyze potential proteinprotein interactions in membrane fractions. All proteins
identified in 1-D BN bands were confirmed using 2-D
gel. We have obtained a profile of the M. bovis BCG
potential membrane and membrane-associated protein
complexes, and these results may provide some insights
into BCG protein interaction studies.

Results and discussion
Sample pre-treatments for BN PAGE

The aim of this work is to isolate and characterize
native and structurally intact membrane protein complexes directly from BCG membrane fractions. The protein complex stability during the sample preparation
and separation is an extremely important factor in effective identification. It has been demonstrated that some
detergents allow for effective solubilization of proteins
in oligomeric state, maintenance of enzyme activity and
sharp resolution in electrophoresis [22]. Mild non-ionic
detergents, Triton X-100 and n-dodecyl-b-D-maltoside
(DDM), were chosen to solubilize membrane fractions
and the effect of different concentrations of detergents
was tested experimentally. Briefly, two samples of the

Page 3 of 11

extracted membrane fractions (see Methods for details)
were treated with 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, while another
two samples were resolved with DDM to a final concentration of 2% and 1% (w/v), respectively. The migration
of each sample treated with different detergents and
concentrations was compared and the best result was
obtained with 0.2% (w/v) of Triton X-100 (Figure 1).
This concentration appeared to represent a good compromise, avoiding both the partial disintegration of
native complexes caused by excess detergent, and the
appearance of gel band smearing due to insufficient
concentrations of detergent.
Separation by BN PAGE and SDS PAGE

In the present study, biological membranes were solubilized with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and separation by
BN PAGE. According to their size, proteins migrated
more slowly with increased running distance
and decreased pore size of the gradient gel and stopped
almost entirely when they approached their sizedependent specific pore-size limit [16]. Figure 2 shows a
representative BN PAGE map of membrane fractions.

Figure 2 BN PAGE separation of M. bovis BCG membrane
fractions treated with 0.2% Triton X-100. Gel gradient was 4-16%
and the gel was stained with CBB G-250. Left lane was High
Molecular Weight (HMW) calibration, and right was migration of
BCG membrane fractions.

Figure 1 BN PAGE of membrane fractions from M. bovis BCG.
Membrane fractions were incubated with detergents for at least
one hour at 4°C. Lane 1 was High Molecular Weight (HMW)
calibration and lane 2, 3 were treated with Triton X-100 (0.2% and
0.1% (w/v), respectively). Lane 4, 5 were solubilized with DDM (2%
and 1% (w/v), respectively). Gel gradient was 4-16%. The gel was
run according to the protocol given in Methods.

To determine the protein composition in BN gel bands,
nine bands with high staining intensity were excised and
the peptide mixtures derived from them were individually subjected to LC-MS/MS system as described in the
experimental procedures. Finally, proteins were identified by database search and replicate measurements
have confirmed the identity of these protein hits.
The result showed that each BN band represented a protein complex. Totally, nine potential multiprotein complexes were obtained. The blue band I and band VII
contained some subunits of lipid metabolism complex,
whereas the sharp band II was identified as ATP synthase.
In band III and IV, two members of phenolpthiocerol
synthase and three of Emb protein complex were found,
respectively. In band V two polyketide synthases were
recognized, whereas band VI contained four members of
heat shock protein family. In addition, several members of
polyribosomal proteins were found in band VIII. In the
last band IX, two subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase
(SDH) enzyme complex were identified.
In 2008, Målen et al. obtained a comprehensive picture of the M.bovis BCG membrane protein repertoire
[12]. Of these proteins identified in their study, four

Zheng et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/40

protein complexes were found, including ATP synthase,
NAD(P) transhydrogenase, ubiquinone oxidoreductase
and ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase. In detail, the
soluble protein encoded by the pntAa gene has been
shown to be associated with two other proteins encoded
by pntAb and pntB genes, forming NAD(P) transhydrogenases complex on the membrane. Additionally, six
subunits of the ATP synthase complex, five subunits of
the ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex and three subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex were also identified,
respectively.
In the present study, to confirm the protein composition
of each complex, nine bands which cut out from 1-D BN
gel were resolved into their individual subunits by denaturing SDS PAGE. The subunits of each complex were
ordered according to their molecular weight in vertical
rows. Figure 3 showed a 2-D PAGE map of protein complexes identified in BN gel bands and 44 spots were recognizable on the map. In total, 40 distinct proteins were
identified by two or more peptide hits using the Mascot
algorithms. A complete list of all identified proteins is provided in Table 1 and Additional file 1. On average, the
identified proteins matched with more than six unique
peptides. Of these proteins, 12 proteins had at least one
transmembrane helix (TMH) predicted by TMHMM 2.0
(excluding the possible signal sequences predicted using
SignalP). The average GRAVY value, which is used to evaluate the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein
along with its amino acid sequence, was 0.33 for integral
membrane proteins (IMPs) [23]. Based on the Pasteur
Institute functional classification tree, the identified proteins were distributed across several functional groups (see
Table 1 for details). Most of the identified proteins were
involved in intermediary metabolism and respiration
(Functional category 7, 27.5%). Additionally, seven proteins (17.5%) were required for lipid metabolism (Functional category 1), information pathways (Functional
category 2) and cell wall and cell processes (Functional
category 3), respectively. It was interesting that some proteins with high hydrophobicity involved in complexes
were identified in our study, for example, EmbC, EmbA
and EmbB, which contained 12 TMHs. Therefore, our
method may offer an effective alternative strategy to identify proteins with high hydrophobicity or multiple TMHs
in complex. To investigate the potential protein complexes, the molecular composition and function of the
proteins were analyzed as discussed below.
Analysis of potential membrane and membraneassociated protein complexes
Lipid metabolism complex

In BN gel, one band migrated sharply in the upper part
of the gradient gel. In this band, we identified MmpL8
and the polyketide synthase Pks2, along with the

proteins PapA1, FadD23 and BCG_3890c. In 2-D gel
this BN gel band was resolved into five proteins (spot
1-5). Spot number 1 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of about 230 kDa and was identified as polyketide synthase. Spot 2 was identified as integral
membrane transport protein (MmpL 8). In addition, a
fatty-acid-CoA ligase (FadD23, spot 3), a polyketide
synthase associated protein (PapA1, spot 4) and a putative transposase (BCG_3890c, spot 5) were also found in
2-D gel. Genome analysis reveals that the mmpL8 gene
is positioned 8 kbp downstream from the pks2 gene,
and the papA1 gene is also linked to the pks2 gene (see
Figure 4 for details). The co-localization of the mmpL
gene with genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis (pks
gene) and lipid metabolism (papA and fadD genes),

and lipid metabolism (papA1 and fadD23 genes).

suggests a similar role of these proteins in complex lipid
transport in mycobacteria [24]. Sequence analysis reveals
MmpL8 protein comprises 1089 amino acid residues
and is predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning
alpha helices. The PapA1 protein matched with four
unique peptides and was a suspected membrane-associated acyltransferase, suggesting its involvement in the
esterification of trehalose with methyl-branched fatty
acids during the biosynthesis of polyacyltrehalose and
SL-1 [25]. Additionally, FadD23 can combine with the
protein encoded by pks gene in various ways to form
complex hybrid metabolites [26].
This is also the case with MmpL11, which is closely
related to BCG_0241c and BCG_0238c (identified in
band VII). In 2-D gel, three proteins were unambiguous
identified (spot 33, 34 and 35, respectively). These
encoding genes occur within the same apparent gene
cluster, which is conserved in all of the mycobacterial
genomes sequenced to date and found to play a possible
fundamental role in mycobacterial pathogenicity [27].
Since proteins MmpL8 and MmpL11 may be involved
in the transportation of molecules that function in hostpathogen interactions, inhibitors of MmpL8 or MmpL11
may provide novel drug targets in the future.
ATP synthase complex

Gel band II comprised 11 proteins, as measured by LC
MS/MS, including four IMPs. All members of ATP
synthase complex were identified from this band. Resolution of the band on the 2-D gel revealed eight subunits of ATP synthase were obtained. In detail, subunit a
(AtpB, spot 13), which contained five transmembrane
helices, matched with two unique peptides. Subunit b
(AtpF, spot 15), which embedded in the membrane and
contained a long helical domain extending into the cytoplasm, was in contact with subunit a, and subunit c
(AtpE, spot 17) with an apparent molecular mass of
about 8 kDa, which contained two hairpin-like TMHs,
was connected by a central sequence that was exposed
to the cytoplasm [28]. Subunit b (AtpD, spot 8), which
constituted part of the a3b3 hexamer, contained 19
peptides and the sequence coverage was 46.5%. Additionally, subunits a (AtpA, spot 7) and g (AtpG, spot
12) consisted of 14 and nine peptides, respectively (see
Table 1 for details). Subunits δ (AtpH, spot 9) and ε
(AtpC, spot 16) contained nine and five unique peptides,

Page 6 of 11

respectively. In our work, although the stoichiometry of
the a3b3g complex could not be determined by MS/MS
measurements, the numbers of the identified peptides
represented, at least partially, the relative abundance of
these subunits (14, 19 and nine unique peptides, respectively). In fact, using the procedure proposed by Abresch
et al., we were able to estimate the molecular ratios of
the subunits [29].
It is a common feature of BN PAGE that minor fractions of multiprotein complexes precipitate during the
electrophoretic run. In fact, spot 6 on 2-D gel (Figure 3)
was identified as putative lipoprotein LpqW. Analysis of
lipoprotein LpqW with bioinformatic softwares predicted a GRAVY score of 0.027 and no transmembrane
helices. Interestingly, STRING 8.3 database analysis predicted that the LpqW protein is a functional partner of
integral membrane arabinosyltransferase A (EmbA, identified in band IV) (confidence score > 0.6). It seemed
that the LpqW protein was a cytoplasmic protein that
interacted with the Emb protein complex (identified in
band IV). Additionally, the putative esterase (LipO, spot
10) migrated as “free” proteins because of no attachment
to other protein subunits using STRING database analysis. Spot 11 was identified as chaperone protein (DnaJ2),
which was a subunit of heat shock protein family (identified in band VI). Spot 14, aligned with other proteins
in band II, was observed but no identification was
obtained by MS analysis.
Phenolpthiocerol synthase complex

In band III on BN gel, we obtained two members of
phenolpthiocerol synthase (PPS) protein family, which
was encoded by a large operon [30]. In 2-D gel spot 18
and 19 were identified as PpsC and PpsA, and they
matched with eight and 12 unique peptides, respectively.
A previous study demonstrated that PpsC was involved
in a late step in the biosynthesis of phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol and disruption of PpsC in M. bovis BCG
led to be an inability to produce mycoside B and phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) [31]. Practically, since
the proteins encoded by pps genes are unique to pathogenic mycobacteria, they may be used as targets in the
high throughput screening of desperately needed antimycobacterial drugs. Additionally, database search after
MS/MS analysis of pigmented spot 20 did not yield any
result.
Emb protein complex

BN gel band IV was subjected to in-gel digestion and
analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Three proteins encoded by
emb genes, EmbA, EmbB and EmbC, were identified in
this band. In 2-D gel, three spots (spot 21, 22 and 23)
were identified as arabinosyltransferases (EmbB, EmbC
and EmbA, respectively). On the basis of sequence analysis, these proteins are IMPs with 12 TMHs (excluding
the possible signal peptide), and match with four, seven

Zheng et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/40

and three unique peptides, respectively. Functional analysis showed that EmbC is involved in the synthesis of
lipoarabinomannan, and EmbA and EmbB are responsible for the polymerization of arabinose into the arabinan
of AG [32]. They have been proposed to be the main
targets of ethambutol (EMB). Disruption of these
proteins would inhibit the formation of the mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex and may lead to
increased permeability of the cell wall and drug uptake
[33]. Therefore, they may serve as targets for the development of therapeutic approaches against TB.
In this band, a putative membrane alanine rich protein was obtained (BCG_2759c, spot 24). Analysis of the
primary sequence of the protein predicted two transmembrane helices and STRING database analysis predicted that the protein BCG_2759c was no interaction
among those proteins identified in our study. In this
way, we were able to conclude that the protein
BCG_2759c was a cytoplasmic membrane protein and a
“free” protein because of no clear attachment to other
protein identified in 2-D gel. In addition, spot 25 was
identified as subunit a of ATP synthase complex (identified in band II).
Polyketide synthases

Two polyketide synthases (PKSs), Pks7 and Pks8, were
identified in BN band V. Genome analysis reveals that
pks7 and pks8 gene are located in a cluster of pks genes.
The proteins encoded by these genes are large multifunctional enzymes and belong to the same PKS family
required for PDIM synthesis in mycobacteria [34]. In
2-D gel, spot 26 migrated with an apparent molecular
mass of great than 200 kDa was identified as Pks7, and
the protein matched with 12 unique peptides. It has
been reported that Pks7 plays an important role in virulence during the persistent phase of infection [35]. Additionally, Pks8 (spot 27) matched with six peptides, and
has been implicated in the biosynthesis of monomethylbranched unsaturated fatty acids [36].
Heat shock protein family

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are involved in a highly conserved family, and first recognized by their upregulated
expression in response to host exposure to raised temperatures [37]. In the present study, we identified
GroEL1, GroEL2, DnaK, DnaJ and FurA in gel band VI
(see Table 1 for details). In 2-D gel, spots 29 and 30
were identified as the 60 kDa chaperonin 2 (GroEL 2)
and 1 (GroEL 1), respectively. It has been reported that
60 kDa chaperonins are one type of molecular chaperones found on the surface of cells and these proteins
have high affinity for lipid monolayers and bilayers and
can associate with lipid membranes [38]. Accordingly, it
was no great surprise to detect the presence of two
60 kDa chaperonins (GroEL1 and GroEL2) in the membrane fractions.

Page 7 of 11

Additionally, DnaJ (spot 31) is a stress gene-encoding
protein that is highly conserved among bacterial genera.
Therefore, gene dnaJ is useful not only for identification
of mycobacterial species but also for inferring their phylogenetic relationships [39]. Suzanna et al. found that
during the folding of some proteins, DnaK (spot 28)
recognized extending polypeptide chains and cooperated
with DnaJ in stabilizing this intermediate conformation
[40]. In addition, spot 32 was identified as a ferric
uptake regulation protein (FurA). On the basis of bioinformatics analysis, FurA was a cytoplasmic protein and
no interaction with Hsp family members. Thus, the protein migrated as “free” proteins in 2-D gel.
Polyribosomal proteins

In general, ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein particles
consisting of two subunits, which are designated as the
small subunit (30S) and the large subunit (50S) in bacteria [41]. Ribosomal proteins involved in the subunits
are the major components of the polyribosome complex
where mRNA is translated into protein [9]. In this
study, seven ribosomal proteins were detected in band
VIII, including five proteins in the large ribosomal subunit (L2, L5, L13, L18 and L22, see Table 1 for details)
and two in the small ribosomal subunit (S4 and S5). All
these proteins identified in BN gel were confirmed using
2-D SDS gel. Despite the lack of predicted TMHs, some
ribosomal proteins are associated with the plasma membrane by IMPs and may interact transiently with the
nascent membrane or secreted proteins [33]. It is important to note that some ribosomal proteins can easily dissociate from polyribosomal complex during their
preparation and separation.
Succinate dehydrogenase complex

Members of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex
were found in band IX. SDH is a membrane-bound protein complex and key enzyme participating in intermediary metabolism and aerobic energy production in
bacteria [42]. This complex is composed of four subunits SdhA/B/C/D. Here we were only able to identify
two subunits: SdhA and SdhB (spot 43 and 44, respectively). MS analysis indicated that SdhA matched with
20 peptides, which was the highest number of unique
peptide reported in our study. Intriguingly, these two
subunits can exhibit SDH activity in the absence of
SdhC/D, which are the membrane components [43].
In addition to the proteins discussed above, some
spots were observed in 2-D gel but no identifications
were found by MS analysis. For example, there were five
spots presented in band VI (spot a, b, c, d and e, see
Figure 3 for spots without circles) which showed exogenous stains on 2-D denaturing gel, while no proteins
were determined among these spots. The spots without
identifications also presented in other bands (including
band IV, V and VII, spots were not showed in Figure 3).

Zheng et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/40

This observation may suggest that some pigment molecules can bind to gel without destaining completely.

Conclusions
In the present study, by coupling LC-MS/MS to BN
PAGE we were able to unambiguously identify potential
membrane/membrane-associated protein complexes in
BCG membrane fractions. The proteins identified in
complexes were confirmed using 2-D gel. For example,
eight subunits of ATP synthase complex which were
obtained in BN gel band were all detected in 2-D gel.
Furthermore, we were able to identify large, extremely
hydrophobic proteins in BN gel by in-gel digestion and
MS/MS analysis. In summary, this study is the first to
apply the BN PAGE technique to the separation of
potential BCG membrane protein complexes. Our
results may provide some clues for BCG protein interaction studies and designing strategies against bacterial
infection.
Methods
Bacterial cell cultivation

M. bovis var BCG NCTC 5692 from Beijing Tuberculosis and Thoracic Tumor Research Institute (Beijing, P.R.
China) was cultivated in 5 liters of Sauton’s liquid medium for 3 weeks at 37°C without shaking. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at
4°C, and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate
buffered saline (pH 7.4). Protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Germany) was added to all buffer solutions
before use. The pelleted cells were frozen at -80°C prior
to use.
Sample preparation

All bacteria and sample manipulations were performed
at 4°C. Membrane samples were prepared according to
the method described by Sinha et al. with some modifications [7]. In brief, the cell pellet was probe-sonicated
in ice-cold sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, l0 mM
MgCl2, 0.02% sodium azide, pH7.4) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail. The sonicates were centrifuged initially at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove any unbroken
cells and debris, and later at 150,000 × g for 90 min to
obtain cell membrane sediment. The sediment was
washed three times in sonication buffer containing protease inhibitor to remove cytosolic contaminants. The
washed sediment was divided into four aliquots.
The first two aliquots were suspended in sample buffer
(750 mM ε-aminocaproic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris, 0.5 mM
EDTA-Na2, pH 7.0) and 10% DDM was added to a final
concentrations of 2% and 1%, respectively. The samples
were stirred slowly on ice for at least 1 h to solubilize
the membrane fractions. The soluble proteins were collected by centrifugation at 12, 000 × g for 60 min at 4°C

Page 8 of 11

prior to electrophoresis. The other two aliquots were
solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 to final concentrations
of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The subsequent samples
were treated as described above prior to electrophoresis.
BN PAGE and extraction of the peptide mixtures

Membrane samples were analyzed by BN PAGE according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow with
minor modifications [17]. Briefly, a stacking gel of 3.5%
and a separating gradient gel of 4-16% were used.
Anode and cathode electrophoresis buffers were different as described previously [44]. About 80 μg protein
from each aliquot was loaded to each lane and electrophoresis was conducted at 120 V for 2 h, and then
adjusted to 200 V. After the blue running front has
moved about half the desired total running distance, the
blue cathode buffer was replaced with colorless BN
cathode buffer for better detection of faint protein
bands and the run was then continued until the front
had reached the bottom of the separating gel. A high
molecular weight calibration kit (GE Healthcare, UK)
was used to indicate the protein size. Thyroglobulin
(669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate
dehydrogenase (140 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (66
kDa) were used as markers.
After electrophoresis, gels were stained with colloidal
Coomassie stain as described previously [45]. From the
stained gels, nine bands with high staining intensity
were chosen for excision and destaining. Proteins in
each band were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol and
alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. In-gel trypsin
digestion was then performed as described previously
[46]. Tryptic peptides were then extracted by incubating
each band with extraction solution (50 μl 1% TFA in
60% ACN) for 20 min at RT. The supernatant collected
by centrifugation were concentrated and desalted with
ZipTip C18 (Millipore, USA). The tryptic peptides were
dried using a Speed-vac centrifuge (Eppendorf,
Germany) and resolubilized in 0.1% TFA for subsequent
2-D LC-MS/MS analysis.
LC separation and MS identification

Each distinct sample of 8 μl peptide mixture was loaded
by the autosampler onto a reverse phase C18 PepMap
100, 3 μm, 100Å nano-column (75 μm i.d. × 15 cm) of
Ultimate 3000 Nano and cap system (Dionex, USA).
The flow rate was 2.0 μl/min for the nano-column, and
the solvent gradient was 4% B to 60% B in 30 minutes,
then 60-100% B in 5 minutes. Solvent A was aqueous
0.05% TFA and solvent B was aqueous 80% ACN in
0.04% TFA. Thirty seconds fractions of the LC flow
were automatically spotted onto a Prespotted
AnchorChip disposable targets using PROTEINEER fc
(Bruker, Germany). Dried samples were washed with

Zheng et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:40
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/40

10 mM NH4H2PO4 in 0.1% TFA (15 seconds) to provide matrix (a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, HCCA)
thin layer preparations for MALDI TOF/TOF analysis
using an Ultraflex III spectrometer (Bruker, Germany).
MS measurements were performed in positive ion
reflector mode with 20 kV accelerating voltage and
23 kV reflecting voltage, and spectra were calibrated using
PeptideCalibStandard II (Bruker, Germany) of mass range
800-3200 Da as external standards [47]. WARP-LC 1.0
software controlled the precursor ion selection and triggered the MASCOT (Matrix Science) database search, and
BioTools 3.0 was used for data visualization and post processing. All these software packages were provided by Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Germany.
SDS PAGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS measurements

Nine bands corresponding to complexes with high staining intensity were excised from BN gel and incubated in
1% (w/v) SDS/1% (v/v) b-mercaptoethanol solution for
1 h. After a rapid rinse with water nine bands were
loaded on top of a 5% stacking and 12% separating gel.
The gap between the bands and the gel was filled with
1% low melt agarose. Electrophoresis was performed at
4°C, starting for 3 h at 80 V, and the voltage was then
raised to 150 V overnight (max. 50 mA). Spots were
excised from the Coomassie blue-stained gel and subjected to in-gel digestion protocol. The digestion mixture was dissolved in 2 μl 0.1% TFA prior to MALDITOF MS analysis. One microliter of the analyte solution,
along with equivalent matrix solution (HCCA), was
mixed and applied onto 600 μm AnchorChip target for
MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. MS measurements were
performed as described above.
Data Interpretation and Database Searching

The raw MS/MS data were searched against a composite target/decoy protein sequence database using the
program MASCOT 2.1 http://www.matrixscience.com.
The target component comprised 3,952 protein
sequences derived from M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2
(downloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database (NC_008769)) and protein
sequences of known contaminant proteins, including
trypsin and human keratin. Moreover, the decoy component was composed of the reversed sequences of all proteins in the target component. Search parameters
allowed for up to two missed tryptic cleavage sites, the
carbamidomethylation of cysteine, the possible oxidation
of methionine, and monoisotopic mass type. Furthermore, peptide mass tolerance was ±0.2 Da and MS/MS
tolerance was ±0.6 Da. For positive identification, the
Mowse score of the result of (-10 × Log (P)) had to be
over the significance threshold level (P < 0.05). Moreover, identification of individual proteins matched with

Page 9 of 11

two or more unique peptides was considered as valid
identification.
Bioinformatics analysis

The physicochemical characteristics of all identified proteins were analyzed by some software. The theoretical
Mr, pI value and average GRAVY score were obtained
from the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases http://us.
expasy.org/tools/protparam.html. Predictions of transmembrane topology and possible signal sequence in the
proteins were conducted using the TMHMM 2.0 program and SignalP program, respectively, both of which
were publicly available from the Centre for Biological
Sequence Analysis at the Technical University of Denmark http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services. Functional association prediction between identified proteins was analyzed
using STRING version 8.3 interaction database http://
string.embl.de/. Functional classifications of the identified proteins were determined using the Pasteur Institute functional classification tree http://genolist.pasteur.
fr/BCGList/.
