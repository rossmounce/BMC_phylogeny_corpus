Abstract
Background: Bone-eating Osedax worms have proved to be surprisingly diverse and widespread.
Including the initial description of this genus in 2004, five species that live at depths between 25 and
3,000 m in the eastern and western Pacific and in the north Atlantic have been named to date. Here,
we provide molecular and morphological evidence for 12 additional evolutionary lineages from
Monterey Bay, California. To assess their phylogenetic relationships and possible status as new
undescribed species, we examined DNA sequences from two mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA)
and three nuclear genes (H3, 18S and 28S rRNA).
Results: Phylogenetic analyses identified 17 distinct evolutionary lineages. Levels of sequence
divergence among the undescribed lineages were similar to those found among the named species.
The 17 lineages clustered into five well-supported clades that also differed for a number of key
morphological traits. Attempts to determine the evolutionary age of Osedax depended on prior
assumptions about nucleotide substitution rates. According to one scenario involving a molecular
clock calibrated for shallow marine invertebrates, Osedax split from its siboglinid relatives about 45
million years ago when archeocete cetaceans first appeared and then diversified during the late
Oligocene and early Miocene when toothed and baleen whales appeared. Alternatively, the use of
a slower clock calibrated for deep-sea annelids suggested that Osedax split from its siboglinid
relatives during the Cretaceous and began to diversify during the Early Paleocene, at least 20 million
years before the origin of large marine mammals.
Conclusion: To help resolve uncertainties about the evolutionary age of Osedax, we suggest that
the fossilized bones from Cretaceous marine reptiles and late Oligocene cetaceans be examined
for possible trace fossils left by Osedax roots. Regardless of the outcome, the present molecular
evidence for strong phylogenetic concordance across five separate genes suggests that the
undescribed Osedax lineages comprise evolutionarily significant units that have been separate from
one another for many millions of years. These data coupled with ongoing morphological analyses
provide a solid foundation for their future descriptions as new species.

Background
Osedax, a recently discovered genus of bone-eating marine
worms, are proving to be far more diverse and geographically widespread than initially realized. The genus was
described from two newly discovered species found on
whalebones recovered from 2,893 m depth in Monterey
Bay, California [1]. Subsequently, three additional species
were described from depths between 30 and 3,000 m in
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans [2-4]. Now, five additional
distinct evolutionary lineages are recognized from
Monterey Bay, but these putative species remain to be formally described [5-8]. Here we report genetic evidence for
seven additional putative species. Given this unexpected
diversity of Osedax worms with distinct morphologies,
depth ranges and ecological characteristics, a detailed
examination of their evolutionary history is warranted.
The initial description of Osedax [1] included a phylogenetic analysis that placed the new genus in the polychaete
annelid family Siboglinidae, which also includes the now
obsolete tubeworm phyla Vestimentifera and Pogonophora [9,10]. As adults, all siboglinids lack a functional
digestive system and rely entirely on endosymbiotic bacteria for their nutrition. The other siboglinid taxa host
chemosynthetic bacteria and live in reducing marine environments such as hydrothermal vents, hydrocarbon seeps
and anoxic basins. Osedax, however, are unique because
they penetrate and digest bones with the aid of heterotrophic bacteriathat are housed in a complex branching
root system [6,11]. Osedax also differ because they exhibit
extreme sexual dimorphism involving dwarf (paedomorphic) males that live as harems within a female's tube
[1,4,12].
Considering DNA sequence divergence between the only
two species known at the time, Rouse et al. [1] suggested
that Osedax may have begun to diversify during the late
Eocene, around 42 million years ago (MYA), perhaps
coinciding with the origin of large oceanic cetaceans. Yet,
this hypothesis must be reexamined in view of our current
discoveries of far greater morphological and molecular
diversity in the genus (Fig. 1). Our present goals were to
better characterize the genetic differences among the five
named species and to use this information as a foundation for clarifying evolutionary relationships among the
12 undescribed operational taxonomic units, OTUs
(Table 1). We examined DNA sequences from five genes.
Mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit 1 (COI) was
used to assess levels of sequence diversity within and
among all 17 OTUs and to provide DNA barcodes that
would facilitate the identification of Osedax species in
subsequent discoveries. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted independently with mitochondrial COI and 16S
rRNA and with three nuclear genes, Histone-H3, 18S and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/74

28S rRNA. A combined analysis involving all five genes
provided a robust phylogeny for the genus and identified
several well-supported species-groups that diversified over
a relatively short time scale, though the timing of these
events during either the Mesozoic or Cenozoic remains
uncertain. Formal descriptions of the new species from
Monterey Bay are currently underway (Rouse, in
progress).

Results
We examined DNA sequences from five genes (Table 2).
Substitution models were estimated separately for each
gene. The percentage GC content was lower in the mitochondrial genes (33.9 - 40.2%) than in the nuclear genes
(47.8 - 50.2%). The two protein-coding genes, COI and
H3, exhibited the highest sequence divergence. Ratios of
transitions to transversions were nearly one, and ratios of
synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions were
comparable for COI and H3. For each gene, the sequences
were partitioned by codon position, and substitution
parameters were estimated separately for each position.
Indels were found in all three of the rRNA genes. On average, the lengths of indels and numbers of distinct haplotypes were similar. Ratios of transitions to transversions
were about one-half for the three ribosomal genes.
Phylogenetic analyses
We initially conducted separate phylogenetic analyses for
each gene. Altogether 83 COI sequences from Osedax clustered into 17 evolutionary lineages (Figure 2a). Multiple
COI haplotypes were included, when possible, to represent the sequence divergence among (D) versus that
found within (π) each lineage (Table 3). Only one O.
japonicus sequence was available from GenBank, and to
date we have collected only single individuals of O. nudepalp-F and O. nude-palp-B. The mean pairwise D values
among the Osedax OTUs ranged from 8.4 to 24.3%. The
smallest pairwise D value, obtained for O. yellow-collar
versus O. orange-collar, was an order-of-magnitude
greater than the largest π value observed within these
OTUs (0.82%). COI transitions began to saturate after
about 12% divergence, but transversions were not saturated and many of them resulted in amino acid substitutions (Table 2).

Four additional genes revealed concordant phylogenetic
differences among the Osedax OTUs (Figures 2b-e). The
16S, 28S, and H3 sequences differed among the 15
Monterey Bay OTUs, but sequences were not available for
O. japonicus and O. mucofloris. Although their 18S
sequences were identical, O. yellow-collar and O. orangecollar differed from all the other Monterey OTUs and
from O. mucofloris. The nodes leading to O. spiral and O.
frankpressi were not stable, but all five gene-trees were
broadly congruent in their topologies. Incongruence

length difference (ILD) tests of homogeneity revealed that
four of the five gene partitions were not significantly in
conflict (P range: 0.119 - 1.00). Only the H3 tree was
incongruent with respect to the 16S and 18S rRNA trees (P
= 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). This problem resulted
because H3 provided weak resolution among Osedax species that clustered together on a long branch relative to the
outgroup S. brattstromi. ILD tests of homogeneity between
H3 and the other partitions without the outgroup eliminated all remaining incongruence (P range: 0.125 - 1.00).
Both the individual gene trees and the combined analysis
involving concatenated sequences from all five genes
identified several well-supported Osedax clades (Roman
numerals I - V, Figure 3). Although limited sequence
information was available for O. mucofloris (COI and 18S)
and O. japonicus (COI), they fell firmly within clade IV. O.
frankpressi was also well supported as a member of clade
IV in the combined analysis, but its position varied in the
COI tree. Estimates of the age of Osedax depended on
assumptions about rates of nucleotide substitution for
mitochondrial COI. Mitochondrial COI divergence (D)
between cognate species of shallow-water marine invertebrates isolated across the Isthmus of Panama grows at a
rate of about 1.4% per MY [13]; so, the substitution rate
(r1) equals D/2 or 0.7% per lineage per My. Assuming r1 =
0.7%, Osedax would have split from its monoliferan relatives about 45 MYA (95% HPD bounds: 31 - 47 Mya) (Figure 3). Time (T) to the most recent common ancestor for
the Osedax would be 24 - 29 MY. Alternatively, assuming
a slower substitution rate (r2 = 0.21% per lineage per MY)
estimated for deep-sea hydrothermal vent annelids [14],
Osedax would have split from monoliferans about 130
MYA (95% HPD bounds: 104 - 160 Mya). T for Osedax
would be 81 - 97 My.

Discussion
Species diversity
Genetic and morphological differences among five previously named Osedax species provide a useful reference
frame for assessing levels of divergence among the twelve
undescribed OTUs considered in this study. Osedax rubiplumus, O. frankpressi and O. roseus live together on whale
carcasses at depths greater than 1,000 m in Monterey Bay,
CA (Figure 1; Table 1). To date, we have found no evidence for interbreeding among them. For example, an
examination of 116 male Osedax sampled from the tubes
of 77 O. rubiplumus females found no cases of foreign
males in the female's tubes, despite the presence of O.
roseus and O. frankpressi on the same carcass at 1820 m
depth. Also including O. mucofloris from Sweden and O.
japonicus from Japan, the mean sequence divergence (D)
for mitochondrial COI between pairs of the named species was 19.6% (range: 15.7 to 23.4%; Table 2). Correspondingly, the mean pairwise D among the undescribed
OTUs was 19.9% (range: 8.4 to 23.7%). The smallest
value (8.4% between OTUs O. yellow-collar and O.
orange-collar) was an order-of-magnitude greater than the
largest divergence observed within any of these named or
undescribed OTUs (π = 0.8% for O. nude-palp-A). These
π values probably are underestimates, however, because
each was obtained from a single locality. Isolation-by-distance and population subdivision across oceanic barriers
are expected to increase π within broadly distributed species; however, π rarely exceeds 1 - 2%, unless other factors
are involved. Global-scale phylogeographic surveys of
COI sequence diversity have estimated π values less than
1% within named species of deep-sea hydrothermal vent
annelids, mollusks and crustaceans, whereas D values typically are greater than 4% among species [14-22]. Nonetheless, odd cases of accelerated COI substitution rates
have been reported. Sex-biased mitochondrial transmission and heteroplasmy are associated with accelerated

delineate five Osedax species-groups. Three methods were used to denote the support for internal nodes: Bayesian posterior
probabilities (BPP), maximum parsimony (MP) jackknife, and RAxML bootstrap values. If all three methods produced values ≥
95%, the node is marked with a large black dot. Where support values differ, the BPP, RAxML (italics) and MP values are shown

divergence in some bivalve mollusks [23], but no evidence exists for this phenomenon in annelids, and we
have found no differences in the distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes between males and females for O.
rubiplumus [12]. High mitochondrial divergence rates
have been reported for some marine and freshwater animals [24-26], but for the vast majority of cases mitochondrial COI is relatively conservative in its mutation rate
within and among species. It is precisely the tendency of
COI to discriminate clearly among the named species in
many invertebrate taxa that has made this gene a common
reference tool for DNA barcoding and molecular taxonomy [27,28].
Although numerous species concepts have been debated
over the years [29,30], genealogical concordance across
molecular and morphological characters provides a reliable indicator of longstanding evolutionary independence
and consequently provides an operational criterion for
species recognition [31]. Our confidence that the 12 presently unnamed OTUs from Monterey Bay represent distinct evolutionary lineages and warrant further
consideration for naming as species is bolstered by morphological differences and concordant divergence
observed across multiple gene loci. Only 18S rRNA failed
to distinguish between members of the closest pair of
OTUs, O. yellow-collar and O. orange-collar. This highly
conservative gene barely varies across the bivalve genus
Bathymodiolus, globally widespread and diverse deep-sea
mussels [32], or across a diverse clade siboglinid annelids,
the vestimentiferans [9]. Consequently the 18S differences reported for these Osedax OTUs are substantive. All
the Monterey Bay OTUs also differed in their 16S, 18S,
28S and H3 gene sequences. Phylogenetic trees generated
independently from each of these genes clustered the
OTUs in essentially similar ways (Figure 2). The combined analysis involving concatenated sequences from the
five genes clearly reveals the evidence for long-standing
evolutionary independence among these lineages. Only
single individuals presently represent two of these lineages, O. nude-palp-D and -F. Nonetheless, these individuals differed from one another and clustered
phylogenetically in a concordant fashion for all five genes.
Formal descriptions of the new taxa shall be treated in
forthcoming publications, as we obtain the additional
samples needed for morphological studies and museum
vouchers. Failure to formally recognize such highly divergent evolutionary lineages as distinct species creates a risk
of significantly underestimating biological diversity [33].
In the meantime, attempts to identify these and other
boneworms will be aided by the present gene sequences,
which have been deposited in public databases including
GenBank (Table 4) and the Barcode of Life Data System
[34].

Phylogeny
Individual gene trees (Figure 2) and the combined phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) identified several well-supported groupings within Osedax (clades I - V). Osedax
spiral (clade III) stands alone as the most atypical of these
worms. Its oviduct does not extend beyond the trunk, and
it lacks the vascularized anterior palps that characterize all
other Osedax (Figure 1g). Unlike all other Osedax, O. spiral
is a late successional species which lives at the sediment
interface and produces long fibrous roots that penetrate
the anoxic (black and sulfidic) sediments to exploit buried fragments of bone [5]. The lack of palps in O. spiral
probably represents a character loss under a most parsimonious reconstruction, because all other siboglinids
bear an anterior crown composed of one or more palps.
The nude-palp OTUs (clade II) differ because their palps
do not bear the lateral pinnules seen in the other Osedax
clades (Figures 1i and 1j). Lack of pinnules may represent
a character loss, but supporting evidence regarding the
homology and distribution of pinnules in other siboglinids is uncertain. Monoliferans have two or more palps,
with numerous pinnules in the case of Vestimentifera, but
pinnules are absent in Sclerolinum and in some frenulates
[10,35].

The remaining Osedax clades (I, IV and V) bear four palps
with numerous pinnules that give the crown a feathery
appearance (e.g., Figure 1a). The two members of clade V
have long branched roots that are green in color (Figures
1e-f) and palps that are bright red with outwardly facing
pinnules. Clades II and V share robust lobate roots. The
two members of clade (I) have relatively short trunks and
palps (Figure 1h), but they have not been found in great
numbers because they are small and may have been overlooked in earlier samples. Members of clade IV, which
have red, pink or even white crowns (Figures 1a-d), were
recovered from depths of 1,020 m or less, excepting O.
frankpressi, which has not been found shallower than
1,800 m. Occupation of shallow habitats might be a
derived condition for these members of clade IV, though
support for a shallow clade was weak (Figure 3). Addition
of comparative sequence data from the other shallowmembers of this clade, O. japonicus and O. mucofloris,
might help to strengthen this relationship (only 18S and
COI data are available on GenBank for O. mucofloris and
only COI for O. japonicus). Otherwise, no clear evolutionary pattern of depth utilization is apparent among the
major Osedax clades. Several of these OTUs were sampled
from a single depth, others were sampled across relatively
narrow depth ranges (300 - 600 m for O. yellow-patch and
O. orange-collar), and some were sampled across broad
depth ranges (1,000 m for O. frankpressi, and O. rubiplumus and 1,200 m for O. roseus).

Age of Osedax
For now, we are unable to confidently delineate a timeframe during which Osedax split from its monoliferan relatives or the age (T) of the most recent common ancestor
for this unusual genus. Present evidence indicates that
Osedax species live primarily on organic compounds
extracted directly from sunken bones. Their Oceanospirillales symbionts are capable of growing on collagen and
cholesterol as primary carbon sources [6]. Video evidence
suggests that O. japonicus also grows on spermaceti, a wax
found in the head of sperm whales [3]. There are arguments to suggest that Osedax may not be nutritionally
restricted to living on whale-falls. Experimental deployments of cow bones and observations of sunken possible
pig bones reveal that Osedax can grow and reproduce on a
range of mammalian tissues including those from terrestrial quadrupeds [7,36]. So, it may be unwarranted to
associate the evolution of these bone-eating worms with
the origin and spread of oceanic whales, as previously suggested by Rouse et al. [1]. Nonetheless, one of the scenarios that we have considered here is consistent with that
hypothesis. If we assumed a divergence rate (d = 1.4% per
MY) calibrated for mitochondrial genes from shallowwater marine invertebrates [13], and applied this rate (r1 =
d/2 = 0.70%/lineage/My) to COI divergence, we estimated
that Osedax split from its monoliferan relatives about 45
Mya, possibly coincident with the origins of large archeocete cetaceans during the Eocene [37]. According to this
scenario, the most recent common ancestor for the Osedax
sampled to date would have lived about 26 MYA, during
the Late Oligocene and roughly coincident with the diversification of modern cetaceans [38].

Alternatively, we can assume a slower substitution rate (r1
= 0.21%/lineage/My) calibrated from COI divergence in
deep-sea annelids, including Vestimentifera [14], as was
used by Rouse et al. [1] for estimating the origin of Osedax
when only O. rubiplumus and O. frankpressi were known.
Under this rate then Osedax would appear to be much
older than previously hypothesized [1]. This result is not
surprising given the larger diversity of Osedax shown here.
Accordingly, Osedax split from its monoliferan relatives
during the Cretaceous, and the most recent common
ancestor for the genus would have lived during the Late
Cretaceous. Perhaps the calcified cartilage and bones from
a variety of large Cretaceous vertebrates supported these
worms -- e.g., mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, turtles, and possibly
chondrichthyans and teleosts [39-42]. Fossilized snails
and bivalves were recently found with plesiosaur bones;
so the sunken carcasses of these large marine reptiles
appear to be capable of supporting communities much
like those found on modern whale-falls [43]. Nevertheless, this scenario is problematic, because the major
Osedax clades would have diversified around the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) boundary, after the extinction of
most large-bodied reptilians [44]. Although dyrosaurid
crocodylomorphs survived the K/T event, they were confined to relatively shallow coastal environments [45] and
probably would not have supported Osedax. Large turtles
and chondrichthyans also survived the K/T boundary
[42], and large teleosts appeared again during the early
Paleocene [46]. It is unknown whether Osedax can exploit
these resources; so, arguably a 20 MY gap may have
existed during the Paleocene when there would have been
little in the way of large vertebrate remains for Osedax.
Another problem with this scenario is the concern that
nucleotide substitution rates may be slower in the deep-

sea vent annelids used to obtain the r2 = 0.21% calibration
rate [9].

Conclusion
The present phylogenetic evidence based on DNA
sequences from multiple independent genes provides a
solid foundation for future discoveries and taxonomic
descriptions of Osedax species. However, our efforts to
estimate evolutionary ages for the diversification of this
unusual group of worms only allowed the erection of new
hypotheses that could be tested with independent evidence from the fossil record. Soft-bodied invertebrates
like Osedax do not often leave convincing fossils, but these
worms might leave traces of their activity by the distinctive
holes they bore into bones. To date, we have found no
other animals that create similar borings in bones. Consequently, we have distributed whalebones containing
Osedax to several paleontologists who are also examining
the taphonomy of fossilized bones from plesiosaurs and
cetaceans. It is to be hoped that these efforts will help us
to narrow the age of this remarkable genus of bone-eating
worms.

Locations of the Monterey Bay whale-falls, except whale634, are provided elsewhere [5]. Whale-634 is the carcass
of a juvenile gray whale that was sunk on 5 October 2004
at a depth of 633 m at 36.802°N and 122.994°W. We
used the remotely operated vehicles, ROV Tiburon and
ROV Ventana, operated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute (MBARI) to collect Osedax-inhabited
bones from five whale-fall localities (Table 1). Bones were
transported to the surface in closed insulated containers
and stored temporarily in cold (4°C) filtered seawater.
Worms were dissected from the bones and photographed.
Then a palp tip was removed and stored in 95% ethanol
or frozen immediately at -80°C. The remainder of each
specimen was preserved for anatomical studies and taxonomic descriptions. Voucher specimens were lodged in
Scripps Institution of Oceanography Benthic Invertebrate
Collection (catalogue numbers in Table 1). Other specimens will be distributed to other Museums upon their formal description (Rouse, in progress). For the present
purpose, we list the approximate sizes (trunk plus crown
length) and several morphological characteristics of each
OTU (Table 1).

Published DNA sequences from Osedax mucofloris (18S
rRNA and COI) and O. japonicus (COI) were recovered
from GenBank [2]. A previous phylogenetic analyses [1]
placed Osedax in a clade that also includes the Monolifera,
which includes Sclerolinum and vestimentiferan tubeworms [10]. The frenulates, a diverse group of slender
chemosynthetic worms are basal to the monoliferans and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/74

Osedax [10,47]. Ongoing studies of siboglinid phylogeny
revealed that Sclerolinum is presently our best choice as
outgroup for this study of Osedax phylogeny. The vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia columna was also examined,
and its substitution as outgroup did not substantively
alter the tree topologies for the ingroup. Other vestimentiferans were not considered, however, because incomplete sequence data are available and because
independent evidence from several genes suggests that
rates of nucleotide substitution may have slowed down in
these deep-sea worms [9,14,48]. Consequently, we have
used DNA sequences from the monoliferan Sclerolinum
brattstromi, collected near Bergen, Norway. GenBank
accession numbers for all the DNA sequences used in this
study are listed in Table 4.
DNA methods
Total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. We used primers that amplified approximately
1200 bp of COI [49], approximately500 bp of 16S rRNA
[50], approximately 1000 bp of 28S rRNA [51], approximately 1800 bp of 18S rRNA [52], and approximately 370
bp of H3 [53]. Amplification reactions with AmpliTaq
Gold (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) were
conducted in a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the following
parameters: 95°C/10 min, 35× (94°C/1 min, 55°C/1
min, 72°C/1 min), and 72°C/7 min. If available, at least
six individuals of each species were sequenced for each
locus. PCR products were diluted in 50 μl sterile water and
cleaned with Multiscreen HTS PCR 96 filter plates (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA). The products were
sequenced bidirectionally with the same primers on an
ABI 3100 sequencer using BigDye terminator v.3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).
Phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were assembled using CodonCode Aligner v.
2.06 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA),
aligned using Muscle [54] and edited by eye using Maclade v. 4.08 [55]. We used MrModelTest [56] and the
Akaike information criterion [57] to determine appropriate evolutionary models for each gene (Table 2). COI and
H3 were partitioned by codon position, and parameters
were estimated separately for each position. RNA secondary structures were predicted with GeneBee and used to
partition stems and loops in 16S, 18S, and 28S sequences.
The doublet model was used for RNA stems and a standard 4 × 4 nucleotide model was used for RNA loops. The
number of indel haplotypes for rRNA sequences (total
number of indels, number after excluding overlapping
indels, and average length of indels) were estimated with
DNAsp v. 4.90.1 [58] using the diallelic model. Gaps in
the RNA sequences were treated as a fifth character-state in

subsequent Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and as missing data in parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML)
analyses. The program DAMBE [59] was used to examine
saturation of the mitochondrial COI sequences for the
Osedax OTUs and outgroup taxa.
First, each gene was analyzed separately using MrBayes v.
3.1.2 [60,61]. Bayesian analyses were run as six chains for
5·106 generations. Print and sample frequencies were
1,000 generations, and the burn-in was the first 100 samples. We used AWTY [62] to assess whether analyses
reached convergence and FigTree v. 1.1.2 [63] to display
the resulting trees. We then used the incongruence length
difference (ILD) function implemented in Paup* v. 4.0
[64] to assess congruence of the tree topologies produced
by the individual gene partitions. ILD tests were conducted both with and without the outgroup taxa. The ILD
partition homogeneity test was run for 1,000 replicates
with 10 random additions of gene sequences.
A combined analysis was conducted with concatenated
sequences from the five genes. If available, multiple individuals of each OTU were sequenced for each gene; however, the concatenated multilocus sequences used in the
phylogenetic analyses were obtained from a single representative individual for each OTU. The five gene regions
were partitioned separately according to the previously
determined model parameters. Bayesian phylogenetic
analyses were then conducted with MrBayes v. 3.1.2. Maximum parsimony analysis of the combined data set was
performed with Paup* v. 4.0 [64] using an equally
weighted character matrix, heuristic searches using the
tree-bisection-reconnection branch-swapping algorithm,
and 100 random addition replicates. The resulting shortest tree included 3481 steps. A parsimony jackknife analysis (with 37% deletion) was run for 100 iterations with
the same settings as the parsimony search. ML analysis
was conducted using RAxML 7.0.4 (with bootstrapping)
using GTR+I+G as the model for each partition on combined data. RAxML analyses were performed with the
CIPRES cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
Relaxed molecular clock
A Bayesian, MCMC method implemented in Beast v. 1.4.8
[65] was used to estimate the evolutionary ages of internal
nodes in the tree topology derived from the combined
phylogenetic analysis. Estimates of the time to most
recent common ancestor (T) were based on two calibrations nucleotide substitution rates for mitochondrial COI.
Substitution rates (r) were estimated as percentage per lineage per million years (my) so they equal one-half the
divergence per unit of time (T) between taxa (r = 100 × D/
2T). First, we assumed a conventional substitution rate, r1
= 0.7%, based on D = 1.4% per my pairwise divergence
rate commonly cited for shallow water marine inverte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/74

brates that were isolated by the emergence of the Isthmus
of Panama [13]. Second, we used a slower rate, r2 = 0.21%,
previously calibrated from a vicariant event that split cognate-species of deep-sea hydrothermal vent annelids
between the East Pacific Rise and the northeastern Pacific
ridge system about 28.5 myA [14]. Calibrations were not
available for the other genes.
We used a relaxed, uncorrelated, lognormal molecular
clock with a general time reversible (GTR) substitution
model that was unlinked across codon positions. Initial
MCMC test runs consisted of 10 million generations to
optimize the scale factors of the prior function. Three
independent MCMC chains were run for 100 million generations, sampled every 1000 generations. Results were
visualized in and FigTree v. 1.1.2 and Tracer v. 1.4 [66].
