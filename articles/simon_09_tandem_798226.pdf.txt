<p>Analysis of amino acid repeats
Amino acid repeats and disorder in four mammalian and one bird genome shows that many are associated preferentially with intrinsically
unstructured regions.</p>

Abstract
Background: Amino acid repeats (AARs) are common features of protein sequences. They often
evolve rapidly and are involved in a number of human diseases. They also show significant
associations with particular Gene Ontology (GO) functional categories, particularly transcription,
suggesting they play some role in protein function. It has been suggested recently that AARs play a
significant role in the evolution of intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) of proteins. We
investigate the relationship between AAR frequency and evolution and their localization within
proteins based on a set of 5,815 orthologous proteins from four mammalian (human, chimpanzee,
mouse and rat) and a bird (chicken) genome. We consider two classes of AAR (tandem repeats
and cryptic repeats: regions of proteins containing overrepresentations of short amino acid
repeats).
Results: Mammals show very similar repeat frequencies but chicken shows lower frequencies of
many of the cryptic repeats common in mammals. Regions flanking tandem AARs evolve more
rapidly than the rest of the protein containing the repeat and this phenomenon is more pronounced
for non-conserved repeats than for conserved ones. GO associations are similar to those
previously described for the mammals, but chicken cryptic repeats show fewer significant
associations. Comparing the overlaps of AARs with IURs and protein domains showed that up to
96% of some AAR types are associated preferentially with IURs. However, no more than 15% of
IURs contained an AAR.
Conclusions: Their location within IURs explains many of the evolutionary properties of AARs.
Further study is needed on the types of IURs containing AARs.

Background

Amino acid repeats (AARs) are segments of proteins made up
of simple patterns of amino acids, often strings of a single
amino acid. They have long been recognized to be common
features of eukaryotic proteins [1-4]. Polyglutamine repeats,

the most intensively studied class because of their association
with human diseases such as Huntington's [5], tend to be evolutionarily labile, especially when encoded by pure repeats of
the codon CAG [6,7]. Because of this lability, AARs have often
been considered to be evolutionarily neutral structures [8].

However, a number of experimental studies [9-12] suggest
that AARs play an important role in protein function. Studies
of the functions of AAR-containing proteins also suggest that
they are preferentially found within certain classes of proteins. From the earliest reports through to the most recent
genome-wide surveys in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [3,13,14]
and mammals [15] a consistent pattern of association with
transcription has emerged for the most common tandem
repeat types. Additional associations, notably with protein
kinases [13], suggest possible involvement in cellular signaling networks, which in turn suggest that repeats could play a
significant role in the evolution of such networks [16]. Finally,
studies of the relationship between morphology and repeat
length in dog breeds [17] have shown that variation at repeat
loci can have evolutionarily significant effects on phenotype.
Polyalanine repeats have also been found to be involved in a
number of genetic diseases, in this case involving developmental defects [18]. Removing a polyalanine tract from
murine Hoxd-13 has a direct effect on bone phenotype [19],
again indicating involvement of an AAR in an important biological process.
AAR size difference between orthologous human and mouse
proteins correlates with protein nonsynonymous substitution
rate [20]. A study of the factors contributing to the evolutionary expansion of polyglutamine repeats in a limited number
of human-mouse orthologues [21] concluded that labile
repeats, which are encoded by homogeneous runs of a single
codon [6], have a strong tendency to arise in regions of proteins subject to weaker purifying selection than the protein as
a whole, while repeats that are more conserved did not show
this tendency. This has been supported recently by a largescale study of human, mouse and rat repeats [22]. These
observations suggest a model for repeat evolution whereby
initially labile repeats become fixed when they reach some
optimal length range [21]. Human polyglutamine disease
genes might then be still evolving towards such an optimum.
Intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs), also called disordered regions, are regions of protein, ranging in size from
short loops to complete proteins, that do not form a compact
tertiary structure under normal solvation conditions [23].
They have been suggested to be involved in protein-ligand
binding, including protein-protein interactions, forming
compact structures only when bound to a cognate ligand [24].
Tompa [25] pointed out that many IURs contain AARs and
suggested that IURs may evolve to a considerable extent by
the expansion of such repeats. Disordered proteins - that is,
proteins primarily made up of IURs - have also been suggested to have lower sequence complexity than ordered proteins [26]. Tompa's suggestion [25] would be consistent with
the relatively rapid sequence evolution of many IURs [27,28],
the observation that highly connected (hub) proteins in protein interaction networks appear to be enriched in AARs and
in proteins containing IURs [29], and the suggestion that evolution of AARs could have an effect on network evolution by

altering protein-protein affinities [16]. As Tompa [25] analyzed only a relatively small set of IURs, his hypothesis raises
the question whether AARs show a preferential location in
IURs, and whether any such preference could account for the
evolutionary properties of the bulk of AARs in a proteome.
Such a preference would be consistent with hypotheses on the
causation of triplet expansion diseases that invoke destabilization of protein structure as an important causative factor
[18].
A variety of computational methods exist to detect repeated
sequences in proteins. These range from SEG, which looks for
regions of low complexity [30], to alignment-based
approaches [31]. Here we use an extended definition of amino
acid repetition that includes cryptic repeats as measured by
the program SIMPLE, which we have previously used to look
at AARs in the yeast proteome [32], as well as tandem AARs.
This allows us to study repeats below the normal threshold
taken for tandem repeats (five amino acids) and regions with
significant biases in amino acid content that are not tandem
in nature but may have originated from tandem repeats (C4
repeats; see Materials and methods for more detail).
Using a set of orthologues to human genes from four species
(chimpanzee, mouse, rat and chicken; Pan troglodytes, Mus
musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Gallus gallus) we show that
the most common AARs show strong preferences to be
located within IURs in all five proteomes. We also confirm
that sequences flanking AARs evolve more rapidly than the
remainder of their respective proteins. We conclude that the
forces shaping the evolution of IURs and AARs are strongly
linked, although AARs are present in only a subset of IURs.

Results
Repeat frequencies
Our protein set contained 5,815 orthologous proteins. Figure
1 shows the frequencies of tandem and C4 cryptic repeats in
this set: Figure 1a shows frequencies for all detected single
amino acid repeats and Figure 1b shows frequencies for all C4
repeats with a homogeneous repeat motif (such as Q4).
(Homogeneous C4 repeats are regions containing a significant overrepresentation of runs of a single amino acid of
length 4; they therefore differ from tandem repeats of that
amino acid because they fall below the definition of a tandem
repeat. Throughout this paper, tandem repeats of an amino
acid are referred to by the single letter code for the amino acid
concerned. Homogeneous cryptic repeats are referred to as
X4 repeats, where 'X' is the single letter code for the repeated
amino acid.) It should be noted that numerous other nonhomogeneous C4 motifs were detected; these are not considered here.
Comparing the frequencies of homogeneous C4 repeat types
with their tandem equivalents showed significant correlations (P < 0.01 or less after Bonferroni correction) ranging

from 0.555 (chicken) to 0.718 (rat). Despite this broad similarity it was noteworthy that L4 repeats were absent amongst
C4 repeats, although relatively common among tandem
repeats.
The frequency distributions of the tandem repeat types are
highly similar between the four mammals, with correlation
coefficients > 0.99 (P << 0.001) for all six pairwise comparisons. The distribution for chicken correlates less well with
those seen in mammals, showing correlation coefficients
ranging from 0.894 (human-chicken) to 0.929 (rat-chicken).
In general, chicken proteins contained fewer tandem repeats
than mammalian proteins (961 in total, compared to 1,940,
1,792, 1,723 and 1,703 for human, chimpanzee, mouse and
rat, respectively). Serine tandem repeats were less extreme in
this respect, chicken proteins containing 193 repeats compared to 241, 230, 219 and 215 for the mammals.
We also calculated inter-species correlation coefficients
between the frequencies of the commonest homogeneous C4
repeats. These C4 repeats also showed strong and significant
(P << 0.001) correlations between frequencies in all five species, ranging from 0.870 for chimpanzee-rat to 0.989 for
human-chimpanzee. C4 repeats were rarer in chicken proteins than mammalian proteins, glycine (G4) and glutamine
(Q4) C4 repeats being particularly underrepresented in
chicken.
Finally we considered the proportion of repeats conserved
between pairs of species, as judged by the absence or presence
of repeats at the same position in pairs of orthologs. This enabled us to classify repeats into conserved and non-conserved
classes between any two species and provides a measure of
the relative degree of conservation of tandem and C4 repeats.
Figures 2 and 3 show the results of these analyses. Generally,
conservation of both tandem and C4 repeats decreased with
phylogenetic distance, as might be expected. This pattern was
seen whether the repeats compared to other species were
identified in human or mouse proteins.

Evolutionary divergence
It has been suggested that regions surrounding tandem
repeats are under weaker purifying selection than the remainder of the protein they are embedded in [7,21,22]. Recent evidence also suggests that repeat-containing proteins evolve
more rapidly than non-repeat-containing proteins [33].
IURs, on average, also show more rapid evolution than the
average protein [27]. To confirm that repeats are located in
regions under relatively weak purifying selection we measured pairwise protein sequence distances between orthologues. Proteins were subdivided into those with conserved
repeats (that is, present in both species) and non-conserved
repeats (present in only one), as previous analyses suggested
that only non-conserved repeats lie in regions of lower purifying selection [21].

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R59

Simon and Hancock R59.4

Table 1 summarizes the results of these analyses. Sequences
flanking both tandem and cryptic repeats evolve significantly
more rapidly than the remainder of the protein they are part
of. The difference between flanking sequence and protein
remainder is larger for non-conserved repeats than conserved
repeats but both show the effect. This is broadly consistent
with previous observations based on a small set of conserved
and non-conserved repeats [21], which showed elevated
divergence around non-conserved but not conserved repeats.
Divergences around conserved AARs were lower than those
around non-conserved AARs, and conserved repeats tended
to lie in more conserved proteins than non-conserved repeats.
To estimate more precisely the relative increase of evolutionary divergence in the neighborhood of repeats, we carried out
regression analysis. The slope of the regression of the flanking
sequence divergence on the corresponding protein remainder
divergence represents the relative enhancement of flanking
sequence divergence in a given dataset. Regression results for
human-mouse, human-rat and human-chicken comparisons
are summarized in Table 2. Non-conserved tandem repeats
show more than twice the divergence in the neighborhood of
repeats than in the remainder of the corresponding protein in
human-rodent comparisons. This ratio is somewhat lower in
the human-chicken comparison, possibly because of the
effects of mutational saturation, which would have the effect
of reducing the estimated divergence of the more rapidly
evolving regions. For conserved tandem repeats the elevation
was of the order of 50%, which is more modest but still significant. C4 repeats showed a weaker elevation of divergence
rate, of the order of 10 to 15% for most human-rodent comparisons. The elevation for human-chicken comparisons was
comparable to that seen for tandem repeats but was not statistically significant (P > 0.05 after Bonferroni correction).

Functional (Gene Ontology term) association
A number of authors have discussed associations of tandem
and cryptic AARs with transcription factors and protein
kinases in particular [1,3,13-15,34-36]. Here we consider the
Gene Ontology (GO) term associations of repeat-containing
members of our orthologue set in comparison with the rest of
the set. We looked for significant associations (P < 0.05 after
adjustment for false discovery rate) at levels 3 and 4 of the GO
molecular function hierarchy. We carried out the analyses for
human and chicken to characterize any differences reflected
in the different repeat frequencies seen in the chicken and
mammal proteomes.
Results were broadly similar to those obtained previously for
yeast and other species [13,15] (Figure 4). All of the common
tandem AAR types showed significant association with
nucleic acid binding proteins in both human and chicken, and
A, S, L, G and Q repeats also showed associations with DNA
binding proteins in both species. Q repeats also showed a specific association with RNA polymerase II transcription. A

but not both. The importance of these is unclear.

between 10% for L and A and 20% for Q and E. For C4 repeats
the range was between 0% for A4 and S4 and 24% for Q4.

C4 repeats showed fewer common associations between the
human and chicken proteins sets. The only shared association
was found for P4 repeats with RNA binding (level 3: nucleic
acid binding). In humans, Q4 repeats showed qualitatively
similar associations to those seen for tandem Q repeats. E4
repeats also showed an association with cytoskeleton protein
binding in chicken, which is to some extent similar to the
cytoplasmic roles identified for tandem E repeats.

These proportions represent a lower bound on the proportion
of repeats lying within structured regions of proteins because
structures have not been determined for all domains. An
approximate upper bound can be estimated by considering
the proportion lying within domains identified by InterProScan searches (excluding PANTHER; see Materials and methods). Many of these represent regions of proteins with
functional associations but no known structure. Between 25%
(for Q) and 95% (L) of tandem repeats lay within domains
identified by InterProScan. Slightly lower proportions,
between 0% (A4) and 40% (E4) of common homogeneous C4
repeats also lay within identifiable domains.

Domain and intrinsically unstructured region
associations
To investigate the relative distribution of tandem and C4
repeats between structured and unstructured protein regions,
we related the locations of repeats to protein domains, as
defined by a search against the SUPERFAMILY [37] database
(Figure 5a, b). SUPERFAMILY represents domains for which
a three-dimensional structure is available and searches
against it are, therefore, a stringent test for location of AARs
within domains. Repeats were inferred to overlap domains if
they lay entirely within the predicted domain. For tandem
repeats the proportions of repeats lying within domains were

Tables 3 and 4 list the identifiable InterPro domains most
commonly containing each of the main tandem and C4 repeat
types. Of the tandem repeats, L repeats colocalized at high
frequency with signal peptide domains identified by the SignalPHMM method [38]. Other tandem repeats showed less
frequent associations with particular domains, although the
domains they associated with in many cases are broadly consistent with their GO term associations. In particular, S and P
repeats were most frequently found within protein-kinase-

like domains. For C4 repeats few domains were found associated with repeats more than once. Notably, however, both E4
and P4 repeats were found associated more than once with the
protein-kinase-like domain, mirroring results for S and P tandem repeats and consistent with the suggestion that some
amino acid repeats are associated with cellular signaling cascades [32].
We then considered the locations of tandem and C4 repeats
compared to those of IURs. We predicted IURs using the
RONN (Regional Order Neural Network) algorithm [39],
which we selected because of its good performance, code
accessibility and because it does not explicitly include information on the chemical properties of individual amino acids
in its algorithm (although it may do so implicitly) - we preferred such a predictor as including chemical properties
would introduce circularity into the analysis as we were inves-

tigating the propensity of particular chemical entities to lie
within IURs.
Residues with RONN scores of > 0.5 are predicted to be disordered (that is, IURs), whereas residues with scores < 0.5
are predicted to be ordered. Repeats were inferred to overlap
IURs if they lay entirely within them. Figure 6 summarizes
the proportions of amino acids within the different types of
repeat that fall into the ordered and disordered classes across
the five species.
Most repeats showed a strong tendency to lie in unstructured
regions; for tandem repeats the proportions lying within
unstructured regions ranged from 96% for E and S to 67% for
A, compared to 22% for the average amino acid within a protein. The exceptions were L repeats, which were predicted to
be predominantly ordered. Among C4 repeats, all the com-

mon repeat types again showed a strong preference for highly
disordered regions. As for tandem repeats, E4 repeats showed
the highest level of disorder while A4 showed a higher degree
of order. Corresponding tandem and C4 repeats showed similar distributions between ordered and disordered regions.
The exceptions to this trend were Gln repeats, which showed
a higher tendency to be within structured regions as C4
repeats (32%) than as tandem repeats (13%).
Finally, we considered the proportion of IUR regions that
contain an AAR. These proportions differ depending on the
minimum length permitted for an IUR. For a minimum IUR
length of 10, on average 85% of proteins contained a predicted IUR. Twenty to 21% of mammalian proteins and 13%
of chicken proteins contained some kind of tandem AAR and
12% of mammalian proteins and 9% of chicken proteins contained some kind of C4 repeat; 4.6% of IURs contained a tandem AAR and 0.5% a C4 AAR. The proportion of proteins
containing an IUR reported here is higher than the generally
accepted proportion of around 40% [40,41]. We therefore
investigated whether a longer length cut-off for our definition
of an IUR would significantly affect these proportions. At a
cut-off of 50 residues, 34% of proteins contain an IUR, which
is similar to the proportion reported previously. Under this
definition, 13% of IURs contained a tandem AAR and 2% a C4
AAR.

Numerous predictors of IURs are available - for a comparison
see [42]. We compared results obtained with RONN to those
obtained with two other predictors, DISOPRED [43,44] and
IUPRED [45]. DISOPRED, like RONN, uses a machine learning approach coupled to protein structure information to predict IURs while IUPRED uses pairwise amino acid energy
content. Comparison of the results from RONN with these
predictors is shown in Table 5. Results from the three programs were broadly similar, with IUPRED and DISOPRED
producing the closest result to RONN for an approximately
equal number of tandem repeat types (four for IUPRED and
three for DISOPRED). A notable difference was observed for
A repeats, which were predicted as ordered in 63% of cases by
IUPRED but 23% by DISOPRED and 32% by RONN.

Discussion

Although tandem repeats of amino acids are easily recognized
features of proteins and have been extensively studied, protein sequences show more widespread repetitive features.
This is shown by the high proportion of proteins containing
repetitive segments - approximately 50% as measured by SEG
[30] and over 70% of the S. cerevisiae proteome as measured
by SIMPLE [32]. In this study we have compared the frequencies of tandem repeats with those of C4 repeats (repetitive
regions with a local overrepresentation of motifs of length
four residues) using SIMPLE, which has the advantage that it
identifies explicitly the overrepresented motif in a given

region. We have carried out this comparison in a large set of
proteins orthologous between four mammals and chicken,
which is the most closely related non-mammalian species
with a sequenced genome. This allows us to compare repeat
frequencies both between types and between species.
After excluding C4 motifs that overlap tandem repeats, many
of the C4 motifs detected in these genomes are clearly related
to common tandemly repeated amino acids (six of the seven
most common tandem amino acid types in Figure 1a are mirrored by the six most common homogeneous C4 repeat types
in Figure 1b), suggesting that the underlying mechanisms

that gives rise to them is similar. This is also reflected in the
high correlations seen between the frequencies of tandem
repeats and their respective homogeneous C4 repeats. Tandem AARs most likely evolve by replication slippage, as they
evolve more rapidly if they are encoded by pure codon repeats
than interrupted codon repeats [6,13]. Dieringer and SchlÃ¶tterer [46] introduced a novel, slippage-related process they
called indel slippage that acts in a non-repeat-length-dependent manner on repeated motifs as short as a single nucleotide.
Such a mechanism could contribute to the evolution of C4
repeats and other cryptically repetitive sequences [47,48] and

could give rise to differences in the frequencies of tandem and
cryptic repeats.
The biggest difference in frequency between tandem and
cryptic repeats was seen for Leu, which is rare among C4
repeats. In addition, Q4 repeats are by far the most common
class of C4 repeats while Gln is only the seventh most numerous class of tandem repeat in our sample. These large differences could reflect differences in underlying mechanisms
(although this seems superficially unlikely as Q tandem
repeats are known to undergo rapid evolution [6,49]) but
could also reflect differential selective forces (acting strongly
against L4 repeats and Q tandem repeats but less so against
their counterparts).
Repeat frequencies were highly similar between the mammals, but the chicken proteome showed a distinct frequency
distribution in which most repeat frequencies were lower. A
partial exception to this pattern were tandem S repeats, which
although rarer in chicken than in mammals, were the most
common class in the chicken proteome. A trivial explanation
for these differences could be the currently lower quality of
the chicken genome sequence. However, this is unlikely to be
the main explanation as the dataset we used contained only
clearly identifiable orthologues. Another, and more interesting, possibility is that the lower frequency in chicken is the
result of the general reduction of genome size in birds. The
chicken genome is approximately one-third the size of the
human genome [50] while bird genomes in general are
approximately half the size of mammalian genomes [51].
Analysis of the evolution of bird genome size indicates that
genome shrinkage took place in the saurischian lineage leading to the birds circa 200 to 300 million years ago and that
this was accompanied by a reduction in the genome fraction
of repetitive elements [51]. A global correlation of genome
sequence repetition with genome size has also been described
[52,53]. The lower frequency of amino acid repeats in chicken
proteins may therefore reflect a parallel process of loss of

transposable elements and tandem and cryptic repeats in that
evolutionary lineage. A possible explanation for the stronger
conservation of S repeats between mammals and chicken
than other repeat types is that they play a less dispensable role
in protein function; serine-rich domains (RS domains) are
intimately involved in alternative splicing [54] and it is possible that this role is sufficiently important to ensure their
retention.
Previous analyses of the evolution of Gln repeats have suggested that in the early stages of their emergence, when
encoded by pure codon repeats, they appear preferentially in
regions of proteins that are subject to relatively low levels of
purifying selection (that is, regions that evolve more quickly
than the rest of the protein) [7,21,22]. In this study we have
analyzed the evolution of regions flanking tandem and C4
AARs in human-rodent and human-chicken comparisons and
show the same trend, confirming that the majority of tandem
and C4 repeats in proteins emerge in rapidly evolving subregions. We also confirm earlier suggestions [21,22] that conserved repeats lie in relatively more conserved protein
subregions than non-conserved repeats and show that conserved AARs tend to lie in more conserved proteins than nonconserved AARs. In addition, we observe elevated sequence
differences around conserved repeats of both types, although
this elevation is less extreme than is observed for non-conserved repeats. The latter result differs from a previous study
that did not find a difference between flanking regions and
the remainder of the proteins for conserved AARs [21]. However, that study only considered a relatively small number of
proteins and so most likely failed to detect this difference due
to a lack of statistical power. Generally, the results are consistent with a model of repeat evolution whereby repeats tend
to emerge in less-conserved regions of proteins and become
frozen in length as they reach a length at which they are close
to a threshold at which they may cause deleterious phenotypes [16,21] but they also suggest that the regions in which

repeats become fixed may continue to evolve relatively rapidly after repeat fixation.
IURs are regions of proteins that do not form stable tertiary
structures under native conditions. Analyses of the extent of
disorder in whole genomes suggest that in eukaryotes more
than 40% of proteins are either completely disordered or contain significant regions of disorder [40,41]. In this dataset we
find 34% of proteins to contain IURs of length > 50 and 85%
to contain an IUR of length > 10. These regions are thought to
form flexible regions of proteins that might have a number of
functions, including binding to other proteins and small molecules and providing flexibility in multidomain proteins. In
an analysis of repeat content of a relatively small number of
intrinsically unstructured protein regions, Tompa [25] identified an apparently strong role for AARs in IUR evolution.
The definition of 'repeats' in his analysis is different from ours
as it included longer, complex repeated motifs as well as simple sequence repeats, but some simple sequence repeats did
appear in his results. This raises the question whether there is
a real association of simple AARs with IURs, and whether an
association of this type can account for the evolutionary
dynamics of AARs. Here we have investigated this by considering the overlap between tandem and C4 repeats and, first,
domains identifiable searching the SUPERFAMILY and
InterPro databases, and second, unstructured regions predicted by the RONN predictor. The majority of AARs, with the
exception of L tandem repeats, lie within IURs predicted by
RONN (Figure 6).
We obtained inconsistent predictions on the level of structure
shown by A repeats. They were predicted to be predominantly
unstructured by two methods, RONN and DISOPRED, but
not by a third, IUPRED. This disagreement may reflect the
different methodologies employed by the different algorithms
as IUPRED takes account of the chemical characteristics of
the sequence being analyzed whereas RONN and DISOPRED
use structural analyses of proteins. The ambiguous position
of A in these analyses is interesting in the light of its role as the
second major cause of human repeat expansion disease, after
Q. Gln repeats are notable in showing markedly higher proportions of disorder as tandem repeats than as C4 repeats,
suggesting that expansion of Q repeats could have a destabilizing effect on proteins, as suggested previously [18].
Seven of the eight most common tandemly repeated amino
acids in our dataset correspond to the seven disorder-promoting amino acids defined by Dunker et al. [55]. Lise and
Jones [56] in their study of common amino acid patterns in
unstructured regions also identified a number of patterns
similar to the most common C4 repeats, notably E- and P-rich
regions. A strong element of the purifying selection acting
against the emergence of AARs within folded regions of proteins therefore appears to be selection against their propensity to lower the stability of these regions. Interestingly, as
noted by Kreil and Kreil [57], N repeats are much rarer than

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R59

Simon and Hancock R59.13

Q repeats - indeed, in our analysis of human proteins we
found only four tandem N repeats. This observation may
reflect the propensity of Asn to promote order [55] and consequent purifying selection acting against the appearance of
N repeats in unstructured regions. A similar argument may
apply to D and E repeats - Glu, which is common in AARs, is
disorder-promoting whereas Asp, which is rare in AARs, is
not. In this context, it is noteworthy that although E repeats
are the most common class in mammals and the most often
predicted to be unstructured, they are also, after L repeats,
the class most commonly found associated with SUPERFAMILY and InterPro domains. This raises the question
whether the domains in which they are located tend to be
close to the threshold of instability. Mean RONN scores of
domains containing E repeats are 0.44 for SUPERFAMILY
and 0.46 for InterPro domains. These compare to means for
all domains containing repeats of 0.43 for SUPERFAMILY
domains and 0.41 for InterPro domains. The mean for E
repeats in SUPERFAMILY domains is typical of all repeatcontaining domains, but that for InterPro domains is the
highest amongst all repeat types. As most of the domains containing E repeats are InterPro and not SUPERFAMILY
domains, this raises the possibility that some E repeat-containing InterPro domains are relatively unstable.
L tandem repeats form interesting exceptions to the general
association of AARs with unstructured regions as they are
predicted to be 100% structured. The amino acids found in
tandem repeats tend to be hydrophilic; all the most
hydrophilic amino acids [58] are found in the class of common tandem AARs - the only strongly hydrophobic amino
acid in this class is Leu. Hydrophobic amino acids tend to
occupy buried positions within proteins, so it is not surprising
that Leu repeats show a high propensity to be structured. In
earlier analyses, Leu repeats have been found to be concentrated close to the amino termini of proteins [15,59], presumably forming part of the hydrophobic region of signal
sequences, although Leu may also contribute to transmembrane segments of proteins and more generally to protein
cores and stabilizing secondary and tertiary structure [59].

Conclusions

The majority of AARs have arisen during evolution within
protein regions with the characteristics of IURs. This is true
both of tandem and cryptic repeats, which have many common characteristics such as relative frequency and, to a lesser
extent, GO associations. The dynamics of the evolution of
most AARs are, therefore, likely to mirror those of IURs.
Some, but not all, IURs, evolve more rapidly than the proteins
they are part of [27,28]. Despite this, our results suggest that
only a small subset (no more than 15%) of IURs contain
AARs. This raises the question whether there are specific subclasses of rapidly evolving IURs that have a higher propensity
to evolve AARs. As AARs tend to be associated with transcription and cell signaling, it is possible that proteins with these

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R59

Genome Biology 2009,

types of functions have particular types of IUR that might
predispose them to evolve repeats.
IURs are thought to play an important role in protein-protein
interactions. Repeat accumulation may, therefore, play a role
in the evolution of protein-protein interactions in transcriptional and signaling networks by expanding the repertoire of
disordered regions. Because they evolve rapidly, repeat
sequences potentially provide a means for organisms to rapidly tune their transcriptional and signaling protein-protein
interaction networks [16].
Leu (and Ala) repeats form a special class in being hydrophobic amino acids that commonly form repeat structures. Leu
repeats are consistently predicted to be structured, and Ala
repeats often are. Glu repeats, which are very common, are
also often found within structured regions, although Glu is
disorder-promoting. Further studies of the evolution of these
repeat classes are therefore merited as repeat variation in
structured regions may be expected to have significant effects
on protein structure and/or stability.

Materials and methods
Data set
For the analyses presented in this paper we prepared a set of
orthologous proteins present in all five species, extracted
from the Ensembl database version 41 [60]. We downloaded
mouse, rat, chimp and chicken proteins that are orthologous
to human proteins. All proteins were chosen to be orthologous to the same human protein. We excluded any duplicate
entries, any sequences that were under 300 amino acids
(thereby removing proteins too short to allow meaningful
analysis of sequences' flanking repeats) and any human and
mouse protein that did not have a Swissprot [61] identifier.
The final dataset consisted of 5,815 orthologous proteins.

Identification of amino acid repeats
Perfect tandem AARs were identified using a standalone
JAVA program. Tandem repeats are defined here as continuous runs of a single amino acid with a length of more than four
residues.
Cryptic repeats were identified using version 3 of the program
SIMPLE [32] with modifications to increase its speed (S
Greenaway, MS and JMH, unpublished [62]). To distinguish
C4 repeats from overlapping tandem repeats, we excluded all
C4 repeats that overlapped tandem repeats from further analysis. For any given repeat unit size, SIMPLE identifies
sequence windows that achieve simplicity scores above any
value seen in 100 randomized versions of the test sequence.
The repeat unit corresponding to this window is recorded as
a significantly simple motif (SSM). We considered repeats
with repeat motifs of length four, which we call C4 repeats.
For homogeneous motifs such as QQQQ (Q4), these correspond to regions that fall just below our definition of a tan-

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R59

Simon and Hancock R59.14

dem AAR. By looking at C4, rather than tandem repeats of a
shorter length, we were also able to look at interrupted, tandem-like cryptic structures. It should be noted that using
longer motif lengths would essentially replicate searches for
tandem repeats of different lengths. Using shorter motif
lengths (one to three) produces results more similar to those
for tandem repeats than those seen for C4 repeats (data not
shown).

Evolutionary rate analysis
To confirm whether the flanking regions of AARs have
evolved more rapidly than the whole protein, we constructed
multiple alignments of orthologs from the five species using
the default settings of CLUSTALW [63].
Replication slippage has been implicated as a mutational
mechanism giving rise to variation in cryptically repetitive
sequences [48] as well as being the major mutational mechanism at microsatellites [64]. As described previously for analyses of rates of evolution of sequences flanking microsatellites
[49], care needs to be taken when analyzing the evolutionary
rates of sequences flanking slippage-derived repetitive
sequences. This is because sequences immediately flanking
the repetitive sequence may also have been derived by slippage and subsequently modified by point mutation, and comparisons of these regions may, therefore, violate the
requirement that aligned sites be homologous. By analogy
with microsatellites at the DNA level, we therefore defined a
transitional zone [49] for these analyses. This comprised all
contiguous amino acid residues one mutational step away
from the repeated motif at the codon level. For tandem
repeats, the transitional zone started immediately amino- or
carboxy-terminal to the limit of the repeat. For C4 repeats we
took the region defined by the length of the window used to
detect a significant motif (64 amino acids - that is, 30 amino
acids either side of the central motif) to define the limits of the
repeat, as this is the region containing a significant overrepresentation of the motif in question [32].
We then used Protdist from the PHYLIP package [65] to estimate the sequence divergence of a region 33 amino acids
either side of the repeat plus transitional zone (the flanking
region) and for the remainder of the protein less the flanking
regions, transitional zone and repeat region [21]. Distance
estimates calculated by Protdist were based upon the JonesTaylor-Thornton model [66]. For regression analysis of flanking sequence of divergence against protein remainder divergence, outliers (regions whose residual divergence exceeded
2.326 standard deviations after accounting for the regression
between flank and remainder) were removed from calculations.

Gene Ontology term analysis
FatiGO+ [67] was used to identify level 3 and 4 GO terms significantly overrepresented in subsets of proteins containing
particular repeat types. This analysis was carried out only on

human and chicken proteins to minimize effects of multiple
testing.
8.

Domain analysis
To test whether C4 and tandem repeats are embedded within
functional domains or proteins, we searched for domains
annotated in the Interpro database using the InterproScan
web service [68-70]. The Interpro database characterizes a
given protein, domain or functional site by integrating the
most commonly used protein annotation databases. Hits to
the SUPERFAMILY database were extracted from these
results for separate analysis. Results from the PANTHER protein classification system were excluded from this analysis as
they refer to protein function rather than domains [71].

Prediction of intrinsically unstructured regions
IURs were predicted using the RONN algorithm [39]. Results
from RONN were compared with two other predictors for
which we could obtain code: IUPRED [45] and DISOPRED
[43].
