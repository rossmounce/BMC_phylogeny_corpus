Transfer RNA modifications and genes for
modifying enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana
Peng Chen1,2, Gunilla Jäger3, Bo Zheng2*

Abstract
Background: In all domains of life, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules contain modified nucleosides. Modifications to
tRNAs affect their coding capacity and influence codon-anticodon interactions. Nucleoside modification deficiencies
have a diverse range of effects, from decreased virulence in bacteria, neural system disease in human, and gene
expression and stress response changes in plants. The purpose of this study was to identify genes involved in tRNA
modification in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, to understand the function of nucleoside modifications in
plant growth and development.
Results: In this study, we established a method for analyzing modified nucleosides in tRNAs from the model plant
species, Arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × tremuloides). 21 modified nucleosides in tRNAs
were identified in both species. To identify the genes responsible for the plant tRNA modifications, we performed
global analysis of the Arabidopsis genome for candidate genes. Based on the conserved domains of homologs in
Sacccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, more than 90 genes were predicted to encode tRNA modifying
enzymes in the Arabidopsis genome. Transcript accumulation patterns for the genes in Arabidopsis and the
phylogenetic distribution of the genes among different plant species were investigated. Transcripts for the majority
of the Arabidopsis candidate genes were found to be most abundant in rosette leaves and shoot apices. Whereas
most of the tRNA modifying gene families identified in the Arabidopsis genome was found to be present in other
plant species, there was a big variation in the number of genes present for each family.
Through a loss of function mutagenesis study, we identified five tRNA modification genes (AtTRM10, AtTRM11,
AtTRM82, AtKTI12 and AtELP1) responsible for four specific modified nucleosides (m1G, m2G, m7G and ncm5U),
respectively (two genes: AtKTI12 and AtELP1 identified for ncm5U modification). The AtTRM11 mutant exhibited an
early-flowering phenotype, and the AtELP1 mutant had narrow leaves, reduced root growth, an aberrant silique
shape and defects in the generation of secondary shoots.
Conclusions: Using a reverse genetics approach, we successfully isolated and identified five tRNA modification
genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We conclude that the method established in this study will facilitate the
identification of tRNA modification genes in a wide variety of plant species.

Background
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the adapter molecule mainly
responsible for decoding mRNA into the corresponding
peptide sequence. tRNA molecules are generally 75-87
nucleotides long and form clover-leaf shaped structures
through base pairing in the acceptor stem; D-stem, TΨC
stem and anticodon stem (Figure 1A). Modified tRNA
nucleosides are found universally in living organisms.

Some are conserved across all domains of life (e.g. Ψ, D,
m1G, m7G, Cm, Um and Gm), indicating an evolutionary ancient enzyme [1]. According to the RNA modification database http://library.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/,
107 different modified nucleosides were found in RNA
as at 2008. Among these, 92 are present on tRNA molecules. All modified nucleosides are derivatives of the
four normal nucleosides: adenosine, guanosine, uracine
and cytosine. The modifications vary from a simple
methylation on the ribose or base moiety to complicated
side chain modifications in different positions of the
purine/pyramidine ring (Figure 1B).

Chemical structures of some modified nucleosides.

All nucleoside modifications except Q are made on
the polynucleotide level, i.e. they are made post-transcriptionally [2]. Many variations exist, however, in the
regulation of modifications. For example, some eukaryotic tRNA modifications require intron-containing tRNA.
Also, the modification of tRNAs can differ depending
on the intracellular compartment, e.g. using yeast PhetRNA as a substrate in Phaseolus vulgaris, cytoplasmic
and mitochondrial enzymes had m5C modification activity whereas chloroplast enzymes had m1A modification
activity [3]. Modification pathways vary from a single
methylation to complicated pathways involving multiple
protein complexes, e.g. at least 25 gene products have

been found to be involved in mcm5s2U modification in
S. cerevisiae [4]. In E. coli, no modified nucleosides were
shown to be essential for viability, however, the lack of
certain modifying enzymes can lead to lethality [5]. In S.
cerevisiae, three tRNA modifying enzymes (Gcd10p/
Gcd14p, Tad2p/Tad3p and Thg1p) that modify m1A58
[6], I34 [7] and tRNAHis G-1 (guanine nucleotide to the
5′-end of tRNAHis) [8] are known to be essential. Modified nucleosides influence the coding capacity of tRNA
by strengthening or weakening anticodon-codon interactions and by influencing codon choice and codon context sensitivity. Deficiency of modified nucleosides can,
therefore, lead to reduced translation efficiency and
increased translation errors, which will affect gene
expression regulation and cell metabolism [9]. Growth
conditions and the environment can affect tRNA modifications both quantitatively and qualitatively, e.g. bacteria
growing under starvation conditions for certain amino
acids or iron leads to under-modification of tRNA [10].
The link between the synthesis of modified nucleosides
in tRNA and metabolism has been suggested to be a
regulatory device and tRNA modification as a “biological
sensor”. Studies in wheat have shown chromatographic
changes of aminoacylated-tRNAs in different developmental stages [11] and an increase of Phe-tRNA Y
(wybutosine) modification in older leaf tissues than in
young leaf tissues [12]. Studies of different tissue types
of tobacco showed that the abundance and variety of
methylated nucleosides are greater in intact plants than
in habituated and tumorous tissues [13]. tRNA modifications also differ upon maturation and/or transport
into subcellular compartments such as mitochondria
[14] or chloroplasts. Finally, some tRNA modifications
require the presence of introns [15]. Clearly, therefore,
which modified nucleosides are present on mature
tRNA depends on when and where the modification
occurs on the tRNA molecule.
Nucleoside modifications of tRNA have been extensively studied in bacteria and yeast and most of the biochemical pathways and genes encoding modification
enzymes have been identified. By contrast, the study of
tRNA modified nucleosides in plants has rarely been
documented. As a result of their key role in the translation machinery, the mechanisms of regulation of tRNA
activity by modified nucleosides are quite well-conserved. Some modified nucleosides are universally found
in tRNAs from organisms of different domains of life,
presumably because of their essential role for the structural stability of tRNA interactions with partner molecules during translation. In bacteria and S. cerevisiae
tRNA, tRNA modifications have been suggested to act
as biological sensors, changing quantity and quality
according to the growth conditions. Plants encounter
great environmental changes throughout their life cycles.
This begs the question; do modified nucleosides change

Chen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:201

at different developmental stages, in different plant tissues or in response to environmental stimuli? How
many modified nucleosides exist in plants, and how are
they synthesized? These are the questions we want to
investigate in order to understand the function of modified nucleotides in plant development. We chose Arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula×
tremuloides) for the study because both the Arabidopsis
and the hybrid aspen genomes have been fully
sequenced and because pools of mutants exist for Arabidopsis, facilitating the identification of genes for specific
modified nucleosides. In addition, transgenic methods
for both Arabidopsis and aspen are well-established.
Hybrid aspen complements Arabidopsis because it is a
perennial plant and therefore more suitable for study
wood formation.
The methods used for RNA extraction and subsequent
purification separate small RNAs (including tRNA,
snRNA and miRNA) from high molecular weight RNA
molecules (mRNA and rRNA). snRNA (small nuclear
RNA) are extensively modified post-transcriptionally
mainly by 2′-O-methylation and pseudouradylation at
multiple positions. Modification in U2 snRNA from
yeast and mammals have been shown to be important
for the assembly and function of spliceosomes [16]. 2′O-methylation of U2 snRNA has been shown to be conserved in plants but different from yeast and animals.
The sequences of snoRNA which guide U2 snRNA
modification by complementary sequences were also
shown to be different between rice and Arabidopsis
[17]. Plants have hundreds of miRNA genes and the
abundance of miRNA might exceed tRNA under specific
conditions (e.g. upon fungi infection). A considerable
number of modifications (A to I editing and 2′-Omethylation of ribose,) are known to exist in plant
miRNA [18]. The presence of modified nucleosides in
plant tRNA is well accepted but modifying enzymes in
plants has rarely been documented. One example of a
modifying enzyme is the ABO1/ELO2 gene. Mutations
in this gene, encoding a homolog of the yeast elongator
complex protein, ELP1, can increase abscisic acid sensitivity and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis [19]. There
are very few plant tRNA sequences available [20] for the
identification of modified nucleosides on different positions of individual tRNA species, and very few plant
tRNA modifying enzymes have been purified [21] or
identified [22].
In this study we established a method for tRNA purification for the analysis of modified nucleosides in Arabidopsis and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula ×
tremuloides). Twenty one known and four novel modified nucleosides were detected in comparison with modified nucleosides found in other organisms. A
combination-bioinformatics study and loss-of-function
approach in Arabidopsis was used to identify five genes

Page 3 of 19

involved in modification of four specific modified
nucleosides: m1G, m2G, m7G and ncm5U.

Results
21 modified nucleosides and 4 novel nucleosides were
detected in tRNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid
aspen

The model plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid
aspen (Populus tremula× tremuloides) were chosen for
tRNA isolation and HPLC analysis. Because of the low
yield of tRNA from plant tissues from previous experience, we used young seedlings of Arabidopsis and young
leaves and shoot apices from hybrid aspen due to higher
abundance of RNA in tissues of early developmental
stages. From 5 g frozen tissue we were able to obtain
approximately 1 mg total RNA using Trizol reagent.
After removal of rRNA and mRNA by LiCl method we
routinely obtained about 200 μg small RNA. From the
last step of DE52 column purification about 40-50 μg
tRNA were used for degradation and subsequent HPLC
analysis. Gradient buffers consisting of three buffers
were used to separate modified nucleosides and the elution time and spectrum of each peak were used to identify different modified nucleosides.
Twenty-one modified nucleosides were detected in
Arabidopsis and hybrid aspen, listed according to the
order of elution time from C30 column of HPLC analysis in Table 1. HPLC chromatograms of the two species
were very similar (Figure 2); all modified nucleosides
present in Arabidopsis were also present in hybrid
aspen, with only slight differences for the relative abundance of some peaks. Dihydrouridine (D) is difficult to
detect because it elutes together with Ψ, however D is
well conserved and is the second most widely distributed modified nucleoside, therefore it should be present
in plant tRNAs. Q was not analyzed because it is
destroyed during the procedure used for tRNA extraction and digestion in this study. Q is present in E. coli
and mammalian tRNA but absent in yeast tRNA[23].
Because the TGT gene responsible for Q biosynthesis is
found in P. trichocarpa but not in A. thaliana, Q should
be present in tRNA from hybrid aspen but absent in
Arabidopsis. We compared the chromatogram with that
from S. cerevisiae, calf liver and E. coli (Figure 3), certain
prokaryotic tRNA modifications (e.g. s 2 C, s 4 U,
mnm5s2U) were not found in plants, however m2A and
ms2 io 6 A which is present in bacteria but not in yeast
and calf liver, was found in Arabidopsis and hybrid
aspen tRNAs (Table 1). We also observed differences in
tRNA modifications between plants, S. cerevisiae and
calf liver. m3C and i 6A are present in yeast tRNA but
were not found in Arabidopsis and hybrid aspen. Genes
for m3C modification were not identified. Several modified nucleosides (mcm5U, ncm5Um and Ar(p)) that were
detected using purified single tRNA species from S.

cerevisiae were not detected in this study. It is difficult
to conclude whether these modified nucleosides were
absent or of extremely low abundance. Wybutosine (Y)
derivatives were not detected either, however, Arabidopsis genes involved in Y synthesis (At4g04670 and
At1g75200) have been proposed [24].
To summarize, four U derivatives, nine A derivatives,
three C derivatives and five G derivatives were detected
in a total of 21 modified nucleosides from Arabidopsis
and hybrid aspen tRNAs. Four novel modified nucleosides were detected (marked with black triangles in Figure 2) and the identity of these plant-specific modified
nucleosides requires further experimentation.

Using bioinformatics to find tRNA modifying genes in
plants

Many genes for tRNA modifying enzymes have been
identified in yeast and bacteria (Table 2). We decided to
look for tRNA modification genes by homology-based
bioinformatics approaches [25]. We used protein
sequences from S. cerevisiae or E. coli genes for the
modified nucleosides detected in this study to find plant
gene homologs from TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource, http://www.arabidopsis.org) and NCBI
databases http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Homologous
genes are listed in Table 3 according to the order of
modified nucleosides eluted from a C30 column from
HPLC analysis. Phylogenetic trees for each family of
genes were constructed using Geneious Basic 4.5.5 Tree
Builder http://www.geneious.com based on protein
sequences (Additional file 1).
Dihydrouridine (D) and pseudouridine (Ψ) modification genes belong to dihydrouridine synthase superfamily or pseudouridine synthase superfamily, respectively.
Dus1p-Dus4p are required for D modification at six different positions in yeast tRNA [26]. Dus3p homologs in
plants were well grouped, less well for Dus1p homologs
and no grouping was obvious for Dus2p and Dus4p
(Additional file1). Pseudouridine is the most widely distributed modified nucleoside. It has been identified at
15 different positions on yeast tRNA [27]. In total,
almost 100 homologous genes were found in plants,
which code for modification enzymes responsible for Ψ
at different locations on plant tRNA (Additional file1).
To completely understand the differences between these
gene homologs requires more phylogenetic and motif
analyses and will not be investigated in this study.
Methylation is the most common RNA modification,
many methylated modified nucleosides exist in plant
tRNA (m 1 G, m 2G, m2 2 G, m 7G, m5 U, m 5 C, m 1 A, m 1 I,
Am, Cm, Um and Gm, etc.). m 1 G is one of the most
conserved modifications in tRNA. Trm5p and Trm10p
are enzymes involved in the modification of m1G at different positions in S. cerevisiae. Although carrying similar biochemical activity, these two proteins do not share

homology and are likely unrelated [28]. The Trm5p
enzyme for m1G37 modification is an ancient protein. It
is also involved in m1I modification [29]. Three TRM5
gene homologs and one TRM10 gene homolog were
found in Arabidopsis and gene homologs are widely distributed in other plant species. Trm11p and Trm112p
are both required for m2G modification in yeast tRNA
[30]. One TRM11 and two TRM112 gene homologs
were found in Arabidopsis. Conserved residues D215 of
motif I and D291 of motif IV which are crucial for
Trm11p catalytic activity [30] were conserved in all

plant TRM11 gene homologs (Figure 4A). TRM1 codes
for tRNA(m22G) methyltransferase in S. cerevisiae [31].
Three Arabidopsis TRM1 gene homologs were found.
Plant TRM1 gene homologs were divided into two
groups (Additional file1). Trm8p and Trm82p form protein complexes required for m7G modification [32]. Two
TRM8 gene homologs were found in Arabidopsis and
plant TRM8 gene homologs can be divided into two
groups. Plant TRM82 gene homologs are recognized as
WD40-domain proteins (the same domain was found in
Trm82p) which confer a wide variety of functions. m5U

is one of the most conserved modified nucleosides,
Trm2p protein contains tRNA(m5U) methyltransferase
activity in S. cerevisiae [33]. In Arabidopsis, two TRM2
gene homologs were found. The yeast Trm4p protein
catalyzes formation of m5C at positions 34, 40, 48 and
49 [34]. Eight TRM4 gene homologs were found in Arabidopsis belonging to the NOP1/NOP2/Sun protein
family. Trm6 and Trm61 are essential genes coding for
the two subunits of tRNA(m1A58) methyltransferase in
yeast. One homolog was found in Arabidopsis thaliana
for Trm6 and Trm61, respectively. m 1 I modification
requires two gene products in yeast, Trm5p for methylation and Tad1p for deamination of A [35]. TRM5 homologs have been mentioned above. The Tad1p protein
contains a deaminase domain and the conserved residue,
E103, is maintained in all plant TAD1 gene homologs
(Figure 4B).
In addition to base methylation, ribose methylation
requires another group of methyl-transferases. Trm13p
is responsible for Am and Cm modification at position
4 in S. cerevisiae [36]. Trm13p does not share obvious
homology with other methyltransferases, plant TRM13
gene homologs all contain the TRM13 superfamily
domain. One Arabidopsis TRM13 gene homolog was
found, however, we failed to detect decreased amounts
of Am in T-DNA knock-out mutants of this gene (data
not shown). The Trm7p protein is responsible for both
Cm32 and Gm34 modification in yeast [37]. Three
TRM7 gene homologs were found in Arabidopsis.
Trm44p was identified recently as tRNA(Um44) methyltransferase in S. cerevisiae [38]. Although Um was
detected in Arabidopsis and Poplar tRNAs in this study,

Page 6 of 19

TRM44 gene homolog were not found. TRM3 gene is
responsible for Gm18 modification [39]. One TRM3
gene homolog was found in Arabidopsis; however, once
again we did not find any change of Gm content in a TDNA knockout mutant carrying an insertion in an exon
of this gene. This may be due to the presence of Gm at
other positions.
At least 13 proteins have been shown to be involved
in ncm5 U modification in S. cerevisiae [4]. Elp1-6 are
components of the elongator complex which are also
involved in ncm5U modification by unknown mechanisms. Sit4p, Sap185p, Sap190p and Kti12p are a group
of proteins that affect the phosphorylation status of Elp1
protein [40]. One Elp1 homolog was found in Arabidopsis and a few were identified in other plant species.
Interestingly the Arabidopsis abo1(Elp1) mutant has
been shown to be more resistant to drought and oxidative stress [19]. Sit4p belongs to the calcuneurin-like
phosphoesterase protein family and 26 SIT4 gene homologs were found in Arabidopsis. Four Arabidopsis genes
were found to be Sap185p and Sap190p homologs.
Kti11-14 proteins are involved in resistance to K. lactis
killer toxin of S. cerevisiae [41]: Kti13p belongs to the
RCC1 family (regulator of chromosome condensation
family) involved in regulating chromatin partitioning
and cell division; Kti14p belongs to the Casein Kinase Ilike protein family and physically interacts with the
Elongator complex [4]. One Arabidopsis gene was found
for Kti11p, one for Kti12p, six were found for Kti13p
and around 90 homologs were found for Kti14p.
Inosine is a common modified nucleoside found in
tRNAs. In S. cerevisiae Tad2p and Tad3p are subunits
of adenosine deaminase for I34 formation [7]. Both proteins contain a deaminase domain and position E56 in
Tad2p which is important for activity was retained in all
plant TAD2 homologs (Figure 4C). Tan1p is responsible
for ac4C modification in yeast [42] and one Arabidopsis
TAN1 homolog was found. Plant TAN1 homologs can
be divided into two groups (Additional file1). The SUA5
gene has been identified as a tRNA(t6A) synthase [25].
One SUA5 homolog was found in Arabidopsis and several were identified in other plants. ms2io6A modifications have two side chains: the ms2-group requires the
MiaB protein in S. enterica and E. coli [43] and for i6group modification, the MOD5 gene is required in
S. cerevisiae [44]. The MiaE protein is required for modifying i6A to io6A in S. enterica. We found ms2io6A present in both Arabidopsis and hybrid aspen tRNAs. Two
MiaB gene homologs were found in Arabidopsis and
nine isopentenyl-transferases (ATIPT) have been identified in Arabidopsis, however, only two (ATIPT2 and
ATIPT9) use tRNA as substrate [22]. No MiaE homologs were found in Arabidopsis.
Based on the tRNA modification candidate genes found
in Arabidopsis (Table 3), we decide to use publically

for each modified nucleoside in Arabidopsis. We have
chosen the genes of small gene families for which less
than three genes were potentially involved in a certain
modifications. 21 T-DNA insertional mutant lines were
ordered from the European Arabidopsis Stock Center
(NASC, http://arabidopsis.info/) for 13 genes involved in
nine different modified nucleosides. Homozygote lines
were isolated and modified nucleosides in total tRNA
were subsequently analyzed. Twelve homozygous TDNA lines were isolated, among them six lines were
defective in four specific modified nucleosides: m 1 G,
m2G, m7G and ncm5U (Table 4), T-DNA lines and their
insertion sites are shown schematically in Figure 5. T-

DNA lines in gene At5g47680 (Trm10p homolog)
showed a 50% decrease in m 1 G content compared to
wild type plants (Figure 6A). We named this gene
AtTRM10. No m7G could be detected in plants with a TDNA insertion in gene At1g03110 (Figure 6B). This gene
is homologous to Trm82p. At1g03110 was named
AtTRM82. Mutant plants from T-DNA NASC lines
N661341 and N658947 showed no detectable ncm 5 U
(Figure 6C). The corresponding genes, At5g13680 and
At1g13870 were named AtELP1 and AtKTI12.
At3g26410 was homologous to Trm11pthe gene required
for m2G modification in S. cerevisiae. Only 7.3% of m2G
remained in mutant plants compared to wild type plants
(Figure 6D), At3g26410 was named AtTRM11.

tRNA modifying genes from S. cerevisiae or E. coli were used for BLAST search in TAIR database to find homologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis
genes for each modified nucleosides detected in this study is listed and gene used in query was shown in bracket. For multiple gene homologs found in
Arabidopsis the query gene is shown in bracket next to the last gene. Genes for m2A and m6A modification were not available, TsaA for m6t6A did not give any
homologous genes in Arabidopsis. Predicted subcellular localization of gene products was shown when at least two prediction programs gave the same result
(Additional file 2).

Subcellular localization of tRNA modifying enzymes is
an important issue, tRNA molecules are distributed in
different subcellular compartments therefore modified
nucleosides differ in mitochondria, chloroplast and cytoplasm. We performed prediction of protein subcellular
localization using three programs: TargetP, WoLFPSORT and ESLpred (Additional File 2). The results from
the three prediction program complement each other
because different algorisms were used. Distribution of
plant tRNA modification in different subcellular organelles is one of the future work to do, however we need
to be cautious about cross-contamination to avoid falsepositives because some of the modified nucleosides are
present in low abundance.
tRNA modifications are involved in regulating organ
growth, stress responses and flowering time in
Arabidopsis thaliana

Among the five genes identified in this study, two genes
showed phenotype in the knock-out mutants. AtTRM10
and AtTRM82 mutants which showed dramatic decrease
of m 1 G (Figure 6A) and m 7 G (Figure 6B) modified

nucleosides respectively, did not show any phenotype
under LD conditions. The AtKTI12 mutant, which carries a T-DNA inserted in an exon of At1g13870 similar
to the previously isolated drl1 mutant [45] showed no
detectable ncm5U (Figure 6C), however, narrow leaves
and meristem defect phenotypes in drl1 mutant were
not observed in the AtKTI12 mutant.
The AtELP1 mutant, which carries a T-DNA insertion
in the third exon of At5g13680, similar to the previously
identified elo2 mutant[46] showed no detectable ncm5U
(Figure 6C). The elo2 mutant belongs to the elongata
mutants that have pleitrophic phenotypes, generally
identified as reduced organ growth: narrow leaf, reduced
growth of primary roots, altered inflorescence architecture and reduced length, delayed seeding growth [46].
The elo2/abo1 mutant also showed increased resistance
to drought and oxidative stress, hypersensitivity towards
ABA and elevated expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes[19,47]. The AtELP1 protein can complement
the yeast Δelp1 mutant [19] and physically interacts
with AtKIT12 [46]. The AtELP1 mutant in this study
showed a narrow leaf shape (Figure 7A), and also

growth on MS medium plate (Figure 7E) compared to
wild type plants (Figure 7D). AtELP1 mutants had
reduced lateral shoot growth after the removal of the
primary shoot. Lateral shoots had difficulties with

(Figure 7G). Finally, silique morphology was aberrant in
this mutant (Figure 7I).
The AtTRM11 mutant, which carries T-DNA insertion in the third exon of At3g26410, showed a small
amount (7.3% of wild type level) of m 2 G (Figure 6D).
Under LD conditions the AtTRM11 mutant plant
showed an early-flowering phenotype (Figure 7A) as
well as reduced root growth on MS medium plates (Figure 7C). In S. cerevisiae, Trm112p is needed for m 2G
modification by regulating Trm11p activity [30]. No TDNA lines are available for the two TRM112 homologs
in Arabidopsis. Modifying enzymes for m 2 G at other
positions have not been reported.
Analysis of gene expression and phylogeny

We have investigated the expression pattern of all the
Arabidopsis tRNA modification candidate genes identified in this study using the AtGenExpress database (Figure 8). 62 tissue samples were included. The candidate
genes were grouped according to predicted function in
specific modified nucleosides and mean-normalized
expression values from the AtGenExpress database were
transformed into log values for heat map construction
using MeV (MultiExperiment Viewer) software. Most

genes had prominent expression in rosette leaves and
apex tissues, except for the D and ncm5U modification
genes. The AtTRM10, AtTRM11, AtTRM82, AtKTI12
and AtELP1 genes identified in this study are marked
with an asterisk. From the Tilviz database, except for
AtKTI12, their expression was highest in apex tissues,
and the expression level was higher in inflorescence
apices than in vegetative apices according to the tiling
dataset (Figure 8). AtKTI12 is only expressed in late
stages of seed development. The expression heat map is
a guideline for developmental and tissue specific expression of the candidate genes. The expression profile is
very important for functional study. If the phenotype of
the transgenic plants is consistent with the expression
pattern, the following-up experiments will be performed
in the right tissues and at the right developmental
stages.
We searched for homologs for the 21 modified
nucleosides and dihydrouridine present in Arabidopsis
and hybrid aspen. Arabidopsis tRNA modification candidate genes are listed in Table 3. An unrooted Neighbour-Joining tree was constructed showing the
phylogeny between plant genes in relation to yeast
genes (Figure 9). The result shows that most gene

families in Arabidopsis also exist in other plants; however, the number of genes in each family varies. In this
section we will discuss only the homologs for the five
Arabidopsis tRNA modification genes identified in this
study: i.e. the homologs for AtTRM10, AtTRM11,
AtTRM82, AtKTI12 and AtELP1. Trm10p is a conserved methyl-transferase, but it does not contain a typical AdoMet-binding domain and shares no homology
with other classical tRNA methyltransferases, e.g.
Trm5p [28]. Fourteen plant TRM10homologs were
found, including one Arabidopsis gene (AtTRM10), two
from M. truncatula and three from P. trichocarpa (Figure 9A). Trm11p is required for m2G modification in
yeast tRNA. The residues D215 and D291 that are
essential for Trm11p catalytic activity are retained in all
plant TRM11 gene homologs, including AtTRM11 (Figure 4A). Trm82p belongs to the WD40-domain protein
family. Members of this protein family have different
biological functions. AtTRM82 is clearly responsible for
m 7 G modification in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elp1 and
Kti12p are well conserved proteins and both are
involved in ncm5U modification. Only a few ELP1
homologs were found in plants (Figure 9D), in contrast
to the KTI12 homologs that are found from archea to
human (Figure 9E).
The majority of tRNA modification enzymes are not
essential, in bacteria only TrmA enzyme has been
shown to be essential, however the lethality is not due
to lack of m5U modification on tRNA but from its effect
on ribosome assembly by association with rRNA. In
yeast three tRNA modifying enzymes/complexes were
found to be essential: Gcd10p/Gcd14p, Tad2p/Tad3p
and Thg1p. At present we could not conclude which
plant genes encoding tRNA modification enzymes are
essential, however during the preliminary screening of
the T-DNA lines for tRNA modification genes in Arabidopsis we were not able to isolate homozygote plant
from some of the lines (n ≥ 24, n represent number of
plants used), which is probably due to essentiality of the
corresponding genes. To confirm this, we will increase
the amount of plants for screening in the next generation (n ≥ 200), at the same time we will carry out more
comprehensive identification and confirmation of the
tRNA modification candidate genes.

Discussion
In this study we investigated modified nucleosides in
the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and
hybrid aspen. Twenty one modified nucleosides were
detected in young tissues from both species. The
method used did not allow for dihydrouridine (D) and
queosine (Q) derivatives to be analyzed. However as D
is much conserved in tRNAs from all domains of life,
we assume that D is also present in plant tRNAs. The
TGT gene responsible for Q modification has been

Page 15 of 19

reported in aspen (GenBank: EEE81588.1) but not in
Arabidopsis, suggesting that Q should be found in
hybrid aspen but not in Arabidopsis. acp3U [48,49] and
k 2 C [50,51], which have been reported in sequenced
chloroplast tRNA were not detected either in total
tRNA from 14 d whole seedlings of Arabidopsis. This
may be because these modified nucleosides are present
in only a few chloroplast tRNA, meaning that their
abundance is below the detection threshold for the
method used in this study. tRNA enrichment from
chloroplast compartments might allow us to see these
modifications more easily. Generally patterns of modified nucleosides in plants are similar to those observed
in yeast and calf liver, however, several modified
nucleosides, including mcm5 U, mcm 5 s2 U, Y and Y OH
that have been detected in yeast individual tRNA species were not detected in plant tRNAs, potentially
because of extremely low abundance. Two prokaryotic
modified nucleosides, m2A and ms2io6A, were present
in plant tRNAs. It is likely that these are from chloroplast or mitochondria subcellular compartments. m3C
is present in yeast tRNA but was not observed in the
tRNAs in this study. At present we are unable to conclude whether this is because m 3 C is present in low
abundance or that plants lacks genes responsible for
m3C modification. Four novel nucleosides were discovered in plant tRNAs. In subsequent work, we will
further characterize the identities of these compounds
by use of combined LC-MS method.
For the 21 known modified nucleosides mentioned
above, we used a loss-of-function study and identified
five genes responsible for four specific modified nucleosides, m 1 G (AtTRM10), m 2 G (AtTRM11), m 7 G
(AtTRM82) and ncm5U (AtKTI12 and AtELP1). Modified nucleosides participate in fine-tuning the activity of
tRNAs during translation. For example, defects of certain tRNA modifications result in decreased translation
efficiency and increased translational error. Depending
on which codon the tRNA recognizes and the codon
context, various aspects of cellular metabolism and signaling pathways may be altered. Two of the Arabidopsis
tRNA modification mutants identified in this study
showed an early flowering phenotype (AtTRM11
mutant) and had reduced organ growth (AtELP1
mutant), respectively. To study the mechanism of earlyflowering of AtTRM11 mutant, we will investigate
expression of some flowering key regulators (e.g. GI, FT,
LFY, FLC and SOC1) to see which pathway is affected
in the mutant. Flowering regulation in Arabidopsis is
rather complicated network but investigating expression
of the key regulators will help to unravel the molecular
mechanism. AtELP1 has been reported being involved
in different developmental processes (leaf and root elongation) and stress response (anthocyanin biosynthesis
and oxidative stress key regulators); we will study gene

Chen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/201

expression and regulation in the different pathways.
With more genes to be identified in the future, we
expect to see a more complex profile of the function of
modified nucleosides in plant growth, development and
stress responses. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved, we need to investigate the temporal and
tissue specific expression of tRNA modification
enzymes, to find the targets of genes underlying the
phenotypic changes of each mutant. In addition to regulation on a translational level, certain Arabidopsis tRNA
modifying enzymes might also interact physically with
other proteins.
In this study we have established a method for the
analysis of modified nucleosides in transfer RNA from
plants. With this method we identified five genes
responsible for specific modified nucleosides. The
advantage of the HPLC method is that we could
observe global changes of all the modified nucleosides.
The disadvantage is that the sensitivity of the HPLC
method we are using could not detect very low abundance modified nucleosides that may be present in only
on a few tRNA molecules and the HPLC method alone
could not determine the identity of unknown compounds. However, in future experiments we should be
able to overcome these problems by enriching for individual tRNA species using hybridization-based Dynabead technology followed by HPLC analysis; and by
combining the HPLC with LC-MS or by enriching the
compound of interest by HPLC followed by MS or
NMR studies to resolve the structure. With the method
established in this study, more tRNA modification genes
in plants should be able to be identified. Characterization of mutants for these genes will reveal the function
of modified nucleosides in plant physiology and gene
expression.

Conclusions
In this study we established a method for analyzing modified nucleosides of tRNA from plant tissues, described
the amount and recovery efficiency for each step. We
detected 21 modified nucleosides in young seedlings of
Arabidopsis and from young tissues of hybrid aspen
(Populus tremula × tremuloides). More importantly, we
have predicted and summarized the tRNA modification
candidate genes in plants. Through loss-of-function studies we identified five genes responsible for four specific
modified nucleosides in Arabidopsis thaliana: AtTRM10
for m 1 G, AtTRM11 for m 2 G, AtTRM82 for m 7 G,
AtKTI12 and AtELP1 for ncm5U modification. We conclude with the method established here, more modified
nucleosides in plants can be investigated in order to
understand the function of tRNA modifications in plant
growth, development and stress responses. This systematic study on tRNA modification genes in Arabidopsis is
very useful as a tool for those in the same research area

Page 16 of 19

and those who are interested in developing new research
projects related to nucleoside modification on small
RNAs. Also the four novel plant-specific modified
nucleosides will be of great interest for plant researchers.

Methods
Plant growth conditions

For total RNA preparation from young seedlings Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col.0 was grown as a lawn in
soil and vermiculite (3:1) in a greenhouse at 22°C/18°C
(day/night temperature), with light intensity of 150 μmol
m-2 s-1 and 60% humidity under long-day conditions (16
h-light/8 h-dark cycle). 3-weeks seedlings were harvested
and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA
extraction. Hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × tremuloides; clone T89) were grown in soil in green house at
22/18°C (day/night temperature), with light intensity of
maximum 400 μmol m-2 s-1 from natural daylight (controlled by curtains, supplemented when required with
high-pressure sodium lamps) and 80% humidity under
long-day conditions (16 h-light/8 h-dark cycle). Young
leaves and apical shoot tips within 2 cm from the top of
about 1.5 m high trees were collected and frozen in
liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction.
For phenotypic study, seeds for all lines were stratified
3 days in +4°C before being sown; plants were grown in
LD conditions (16 hr photoperiod, light density 150
μmol m-2 s-1, day temperature 22°C, night temperature
18°C, and 60% humidity). MS (Murashige-Skoog, Duchefa Biochemie) medium, supplemented with 0.8% plant
agar (Duchefa Biochemie) and 1% sucrose (Sigma) was
used for Arabidopsis root growth studies under LD conditions (same as above).
All T-DNA mutant lines were purchased from The
European Arabidopsis Stock Center (NASC, http://arabidopsis.info/). Homozygote or heterozygote genotypes
were determined using gene specific primers designed
by T-DNA primer design tool (Salk Institute Genomic
Analysis Laboratory, http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.
html), LBa1 primer (5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′) was used as left border primer for T-DNA
insertion.
RNA isolation and digestion

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA concentration was determined using
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). sRNAs (including tRNA, miRNA and snRNA)
were separated from rRNA and mRNA using the LiCl
method: rRNA and mRNA were precipitated with 2 M
LiCl final concentration, sRNAs in supernatant were
precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol, washed once
with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 0.1 M Tris pH7.4, 0.1
M NaCl. tRNA was further purified using DE52 anion
exchange resin: RNA in binding buffer (0.1 M Tris

Chen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:201

pH7.4, 0.1 M NaCl) was loaded on DE52 column (bed
volume 2 ml), washed three times with 5 ml binding
buffer each time, eluted with 7 ml elution buffer (0.1 M
Tris pH7.4, 1 M NaCl). tRNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in
MQ water. 50 μg tRNA from Arabidopsis or hybrid
aspen were degraded to nucleosides with P1 nuclease
(Yamasa Corporation, Japan) and bacterial alkaline
phosphatase (Sigma) as following: to 50 μg tRNA (in
100 μl MQ) add 10 ul of 20 mM ZnSO4, 10 ul nuclease
P1 (1 mg/ml, 200 units/mg in 30 mM NaAc pH5.3) and
digest at 37°C for at least 24 hrs; add 5 ul bacterial alkaline phosphatase (about 190 units/ml, 30 units/mg,
diluted 1:100 with water) and 20 ul 0.5 M Tris pH8.3
and digest at 37°C for 2 hrs, the digested nucleosides
are now ready for HPLC analysis.

min, 100% buffer A. The threshold level for detection of
modified nucleosides was approximately 0.002% of the
total area. The abundance of each modification was calculated relative to two internal standards (Ψ and t6A),
with similar results.
Bioinformatics analysis of plant tRNA modifying genes

The protein sequences for tRNA modifying genes from
S. cerevisiae or E. coli were used to find homologous
genes in Arabidopsis thaliana using blastp tool (on
TAIR database: The Arabidopsis Information Resource,
http://www.arabidopsis.org), cut-off value 1e-06 (except
for KTI13 and SUA5 where cut-off value is 1e-05).
Other plant homologs were identified using the Arabidopsis genes as query sequence, using the tblastn program and the NCBI nucleotide collection (nr/nt)
database with default settings, the cut-off value was
above 60% positives and e-value above 1e-60. All plant
genes were aligned with multiple sequence alignment
using the CLUSTAW program http://align.genome.jp/.
The unrooted neighbour-joining tree was constructed
using Geneious Basic 4.5.5 Tree Builder http://www.geneious.com. Data for Arabidopsis gene expression in different tissues and under different developmental stages

Additional material
Additional file 1: Phylogenetic trees of plant tRNA modification
candidate genes. All protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTAW
multi-sequence alignment program http://align.genome.jp/, non-rooted
neighbourhood-joining tree was constructed using Geneious 4.5.5
software (see Methods) for each group of plant genes. For query gene
from S. cerevisiae or E. coli, tree is named according to the query gene
(e.g. TRM11 tree). Candidate genes were annotated with accession
number and name of the organism.
Additional file 2: Subcellular prediction of tRNA modification
candidate proteins. Protein sequence of Arabidopsis tRNA modification
candidate genes in Table 3 were used in three different protein
subcellular localization prediction programs: TargetP, WoLFPSORT and
ESLpred. Predicted subcellular localization were also shown in Table 3
when at least two program gave similar predictions.
