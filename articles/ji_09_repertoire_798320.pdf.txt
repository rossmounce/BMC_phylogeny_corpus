Abstract
Background: The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily represents the largest protein
family in the human genome. These proteins have a variety of physiological functions that give them
well recognized roles in clinical medicine. In Xenopus tropicalis, a widely used animal model for
physiology research, the repertoire of GPCRs may help link the GPCR evolutionary history in
vertebrates from teleost fish to mammals.
Results: We have identified 1452 GPCRs in the X. tropicalis genome. Phylogenetic analyses
classified these receptors into the following seven families: Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled,
Secretin, Taste 2 and Vomeronasal 1. Nearly 70% of X. tropicalis GPCRs are represented by the
following three types of receptors thought to receive chemosensory information from the outside
world: olfactory, vomeronasal 1 and vomeronasal 2 receptors.
Conclusion: X. tropicalis shares a more similar repertoire of GPCRs with mammals than it does
with fish. An examination of the three major groups of receptors related to olfactory/pheromone
detection shows that in X. tropicalis, these groups have undergone lineage specific expansion. A
comparison of GPCRs in X. tropicalis, teleost fish and mammals reveals the GPCR evolutionary
history in vertebrates.

Background
The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily represents the largest protein family in the human genome
[1,2]. These proteins have ancient origins and their
sequences are very diverse in a number of species. Nonetheless, all GPCRs share a common molecular architecture
consisting of seven transmembrane (TM) domains.
GPCRs transduce outside signals to intracellular effectors
and play a central role in almost all physiological functions. The disruption of their normal activities in humans
results in a wide variety of diseases and disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), hypo- and hyperthy-

roidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, several fertility
disorders and carcinomas [3]. GPCRs are the richest
source of targets for the pharmaceutical industry [4].
The evolutionary data for GPCRs can be applied to further
functional analyses and are particularly useful for structural evaluation of disease-causing mutations. In this
respect, because of their common physiological traits with
all vertebrates, amphibians can be ideal non-mammalian
models for GPCR-related functional and medical research
[5]. Although the overall repertoires of GPCRs have been
documented in teleost fish [6] and mammals [7,8], no

such report yet exists for amphibians. However, recent
developments relating to genomic sequence data have
allowed us to conduct extensive analyses of the amphibian GPCR family, which may help us to understand the
connections in the GPCR evolution from teleost fish to
mammals.
For this purpose, we chose the western clawed frog Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis for our investigation. X. tropicalis is
a preferred model for genetic studies because it has a
smaller diploid genome than that of its relatives. Recently,
its genome has been sequenced, and the sequences have
been released in the form of scaffolds. In this study, we
present a strategy for detecting and identifying GPCR
genes from a genomic assembly. Using this strategy, we
have provided the first overall map of the GPCRs in X.
tropicalis. By comparing X. tropicalis receptor groups with
those of mammals and/or fish, we performed detailed
phylogenetic analyses. These comparative data provide
information about the evolutionary history of GPCRs,
and the available receptor sequences may help to identify
conserved sequence motifs that are responsible for certain
aspects of GPCR functionality, especially those which may
cause disease through mutation.

Results and Discussion
The overall GPCR repertoire in Xenopus tropicalis
The genome of X. tropicalis is estimated to be approximately 1.7 billion base pairs contained in 10 pairs of chromosomes. The protein sequences used in our research
were obtained from the Joint Genome Institute's X. tropicalis genome project [9]. The current database, JGI Xenopus
tropicalis v4.1, contains 27,917 protein sequences. As the
protein sequences represent approximately 95% of the
full-length cDNAs of X. tropicalis, we expect that the GPCR
genes identified here comprise the majority of the GPCR
repertoire in X. tropicalis. The gene sequences of X. tropicalis have been released in the form of scaffolds, so highly
polymorphic genes might be overestimated. In order to
avoid overestimation, CD-HIT [10] 90% sequence identity was applied to remove polymorphisms, splice variants, pseudogenes and duplicates from the database.

Using the strategy shown in Figure 1, 1,452 GPCRs were
identified. GPCRs represent about 5.2% of the total
number of genes predicted from the X. tropicalis genome.
Homologues of the chemosensory GPCRs from nematodes, plant GPCRs, yeast pheromone receptors, or insect
gustatory and olfactory receptors were not identified. The
X. tropicalis receptors were named after their closest
known GPCRs by BLASTP against the NCBI non-redundant database. The names in each family are listed in
Additional file 1 and the sequences of each receptor are
listed in Additional file 2.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed for strict family classification. With regard to the large number of genes for
olfactory receptors and CaSR like receptors (consisting of
extracellular calcium-sensing receptors and pheromone
receptors) would hamper the preliminary phylogenetic
analysis, the positions of the two groups were established
by diverse receptors of the two groups using CD-HIT 40%
sequence identity. The phylogenetic analysis first separated the GPCR sequences into rhodopsin like receptors
and non-rhodopsin like receptors, then separated the rhodopsin like receptors into six families. In addition to the
five main GPCR families (GRAFS: Glutamate (G), Rhodopsin (R), Adhesion (A), Frizzled (F) and Secretin (S)
[8]), Taste 2 receptors (T2Rs) and Vomeronasal 1 receptors (V1Rs) were considered as two independent receptor
families (Figure 2). Besides the above seven families, nine
other X. tropicalis GPCRs that could not be classified into
any of these families were referred to as "Other GPCRs".
Figure 3 compares the distribution of a number of different GPCR families in X. tropicalis with those from six different species [6,7,11-13]. The main difference in the
GPCR repertoire between X. tropicalis and other species
genomes is the number of vomeronasal 2 receptors
(V2Rs) in Glutamate receptor family.
The Adhesion (24 members), Frizzled (11 members) and
Secretin (16 members) families
In the phylogenetic tree (Figure 4A), 24 Adhesion receptors
of X. tropicalis were compared with the related receptors in
humans. The I-VIII groups of the Adhesion family based on
phylogeny [14] are shown in the tree. There are 17 cases
of one-to-one orthologous relationships between human
and X. tropicalis Adhesion receptors, while the ortholog to
human EGF-TM7-latrophilin-related protein (ETL) receptor and EGF-like modules containing mucin-like receptor
proteins (EMRs) seem to be missing in X. tropicalis. The
location of brain-specific angiogenesis-inhibitory receptor
1 (BAI1) in X. tropicalis could not be calculated in this tree,
but its one-to-one human ortholog was determined
(Additional file 3).

One smoothened receptor and 10 frizzled receptors were
identified in X. tropicalis, which was in agreement with the
findings in both humans [8] and chickens [11]. Figure 4B
describes the relationship between human and X. tropicalis
Frizzled receptors. Indeed, it can be seen that this family
displays 100% ortholog conservation between humans
and X. tropicalis. This high conservation could be related
to their crucial role in early embryonic development [15].
The X. tropicalis genome contains 16 Secretin receptors,
while the human genome contains 15. There is a high
degree of 13 one-to-one orthologs between humans and
X. tropicalis (Figure 4C). Only the calcitonin receptor

Figure 1
Sequence analysis strategy for the identification of X. tropicalis GPCRs
Sequence analysis strategy for the identification of X. tropicalis GPCRs. Two parallel methods were used for searching the crude sequence database. One was retrieval of proteins with six to eight TM domains from the X. tropicalis proteome
database, and the other was extraction of the BLASTP top 20 hits by comparing the GPCR sequences from GPCRDB against
the X. tropicalis proteome database. The crude database, which eliminated polymorphism, splice variants, pseudogenes and
duplicates by CD-HIT 90% sequence identity, was searched for GPCR conserved domains using CDD v2.14 (E-value = 10-4)
and Plam 22.0 (E-value = 0.01). The sequences with conserved seven TM domain were searched using BLASTP against the
NCBI non-redundant database. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out to separate the GPCR sequences into rhodopsin like
receptors and non-rhodopsin like receptors.

(CALCR) lacks a human ortholog. One of the two X. tropicalis corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1
(CRHR1, named after their best BLASTP hits) copies does
not cluster with the CRHR group, indicating that it may
not function as a CRHR. No protein sequence could be
found for the secretin receptor (SCTR) in X. tropicalis.
The Glutamate family (360 members)
X. tropicalis Glutamate receptors represent all of the human
Glutamate receptors with the exception of Taste 1 receptors
(T1Rs) and have an almost 100% ortholog conservation
with human Glutamate receptors (Figure 4D). T1Rs are
responsible for detecting sweet and umami tastes in
humans [16], so the lack of these receptors in X. tropicalis
suggests that it may have other modes for detecting sweet
and umami tastes.

Although two copies of metabotropic glutamate receptor
(GRM) 7 were identified in X. tropicalis, one of them clustered with human GRM6. Both GRM6 and GRM7 belong
to GRM group III and share the same agonist [17]. Human
GPRC5A (GPCR family C, group 5, member A) and
GPRC5D (GPCR family C, group 5, member D) may represent a duplication of the ancestral GPRC5A. Indeed, this
is in accord with the findings in chickens [11].
The main difference between the Glutamate receptor family in humans and X. tropicalis can be attributed to the
gene expansions of V2Rs. In mice, V2Rs bind peptides and
are responsible for pheromone-induced male-male
aggression [18]. The V2R was not found in humans [8],
although we identified more than 330 V2Rs in X. tropicalis. This is nearly six times greater the number of intact

V2Rs found in the mice [19]. V2Rs are related to the CaSR
like subfamily of the Glutamate receptor family by means
of the phylogenetic relationship [20]. Previous studies
have revealed two phylogenetic V2R groups (family A + B
and family C). Only one gene in fish and three in mice
were identified as family C V2Rs, while a large number
were determined to be family A + B V2Rs [19,21].

Figure 5 shows a neighbour-joining tree for X. tropicalis
V2Rs, CaSRs and the related receptor family members in
pufferfish, humans and mice (the pufferfish V2R
sequences were obtained from [21] and the human and
mouse sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Reference Sequence database). According to this tree, one CaSR
and one family C V2R were identified in X. tropicalis (supPage 4 of 12

ported by 100% bootstrap percentage). The fish family A
+ B V2Rs have a monophyletic relationship. Except one
gene, all X. tropicalis family A + B V2Rs separate from the
fish genes. No particular subgroups of X. tropicalis family
A + B V2Rs can be distinguished by a high bootstrap percentage. All mouse family A + B V2Rs form a monophyletic clade within the main cluster of X. tropicalis
family A + B V2Rs. This indicates that family A + B V2Rs
were created through multiple local duplications from
perhaps a single ancestral gene. To summarize, the divergence of family A + B and family C predated the separa-

tion of amphibians and teleost fish. Furthermore, the
divergence of family A + B was the results of multiple local
duplications.
The Taste 2 family (33 members)
Thirty-three T2Rs were identified in X. tropicalis. Taste 2
receptors are involved in the bitter taste sensing and help
to avoid the ingestion of potentially poisonous and harmful substances [22]. In humans, this family clustered
together with the Frizzled receptors [8], but in our phylo-

Previous study has found no orthologous relationship
between mammal and amphibian T2Rs, and it was
deduced that the origins of mammal and amphibian T2Rs
were independent [23]. To better understand the evolutionary position of X. tropicalis T2Rs, the phylogenetic tree

of 33 X. tropicalis, 36 human, 4 zebrafish and 3 chicken
T2Rs was calculated (see Additional file 4; human, fish
and chicken gene sequences were obtained from [23]).
Gene expansions appear to have occurred independently
in X. tropicalis and humans. However, the origin of mammalian T2Rs still requires further investigation as three
human T2Rs are grouped with X. tropicalis T2Rs (low
bootstrap percentage).

The Vomeronasal 1 family (12 members)
In mice, V1Rs bind small volatile molecules and are
involved in gender discrimination [18]. Fish are known to
possess only a single V1R [24], whereas mice and rats contain 102 and 187 receptors respectively [25], suggesting
the investigation of X. tropicalis V1Rs might help to better
understand this discrepancy. Twelve V1Rs were identified
in X. tropicalis. The phylogenetic relationship among the
12 X. tropicalis V1Rs, 2 fish and 166 mouse V1Rs (fish and
mouse gene sequences were downloaded from GPCRDB
[26]) was calculated by the neighbour-joining method
(Additional file 5). The V1R subfamilies (V1RA to V1RL
[27]) in mice are clearly distinct. Fish and X. tropicalis
V1Rs have a monophyletic relationship that is distant
from the mammalian families. The divergence of mammalian V1Rs was posterior to their separation from
amphibians, meaning that the V1R gene expansions in
mammals and amphibians were independent.
The Rhodopsin family (987 members)
The Rhodopsin receptor family is the largest family of
GPCRs in vertebrates [12] and perhaps in all animals (Figure 3). In X. tropicalis, the family includes 987 receptors
that constitute about 68% of the entire GPCR repertoire.
If the V2Rs are excluded, this percentage can reach to 89%.
The Rhodopsin receptor family has been divided into four
main groups that in turn are subdivided into 13 major
subfamilies in humans [8]. Unlike humans, no distinct
clustering into four major groups was observed in our
phylogenetic analysis of X. tropicalis. Although 8 of the 13
subfamily clusters (MAS-related, MCH, opsins, prostaglandin, glycoprotein, melatonin, olfactory and purin)
could be distinguished from each other in the neighbourjoining tree, the rest of the subfamilies (chemokine, SOG,
peptide, amine and MECA) were not observed to form
distinct clusters. For the above reason, we did not further
subdivide the Rhodopsin family by phylogenetic clustering.

The main difference between the Rhodopsin receptor family in humans and X. tropicalis is the number of olfactory
receptors (ORs). There are 665 ORs in X. tropicalis
(approximately 62% more than previously predicted
functional ORs in X. tropicalis [28]), while 388 ORs exist
in humans [7,28]. The number of ORs varies greatly
among vertebrates, ranging from approximately 22 genes
in Tetraodon nigroviridis [6] to 1234 genes in the rats [7].
Previous studies have classified vertebrate ORs as class I or
II genes [29], and this distinction was first proposed in
Xenopus laevis [30]. Class I genes are referred to as "fishlike" genes because all fish ORs are believed to belong to
this class. Class II genes are referred to as "mammal-like"
genes because the majority of mammalian ORs belong to
this class. A phylogenetic tree of X. tropicalis ORs with
those of humans and fish (zebrafish) was constructed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/263

(human and zebrafish OR sequences were downloaded
from GPCRDB [26] and the NCBI Reference Sequence
database, respectively). The tree (Additional file 6) suggests that X. tropicalis has 66 genes in Class I and 599 genes
in Class II. The 66 Class I ORs may be further classified
into at least 3 subgroups, while no clear subgroups of
Class II ORs can be distinguished by the high bootstrap
percentage. Significant gene expansion is observed in
Class II ORs, and most X. tropicalis ORs are mammal-like.
There is more diversity in X. tropicalis ORs than there is in
mammals or fish ORs.
Class I genes are exclusively expressed in the water-filled
lateral diverticulum of the nasal cavities and are specialized for detecting water-soluble odorants, whereas class II
genes are expressed in the air-filled medial diverticulum
and are specialized for detecting airborne odorants [31].
The number of odorants in water is much more limited
when compared with the number of volatile airborne
odorants. This suggests that more ORs would have been
required in terrestrial environments as opposed to aquatic
environments. Therefore, the diversity and expansion of
X. tropicalis ORs might be an adaptation to life in both
aquatic and terrestrial environments.
The MAS-related receptor subfamily is related to the MAS1
oncogene receptor (MAS) and the MAS-related receptors
(MRGs) [8]. MAS is expressed predominantly in the testis
and forebrain and expressed less strongly, but at detectable levels, in the kidney and heart [32,33]. It mediates the
vasodilator effect of Ang-(1–7) playing an important role
in cardiac function [34]. MRGs are selectively expressed in
the small diameter sensory neurons of trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and are involved in the perception
of pain [35]. These receptors seem to be missing in fish
[36], while the X. tropicalis genome contains five MASrelated receptor subfamily members. Hence, it is suggested that the common ancestral genes for modern day
vertebrates might exist in the ancestral amphibians. A
neighbour-joining tree of five X. tropicalis, six chicken and
nine human MAS-related receptor subfamily genes was
constructed (the chicken genes were obtained from [11]
and the human genes were downloaded from the NCBI
Reference Sequence database). One X. tropicalis MAS has
weak orthologous relationship with human and chicken
MASs (a bootstrap percentage of 47%), while the other
four X. tropicalis genes have a monophyletic relationship
(Additional file 7). We investigated the gene expression
pattern for functional information. However, no EST hit
was obtained and it remains unknown whether these
receptors work as MASs or MRGs.
X. tropicalis has four melanin-concentrating hormone
receptors (MCHRs), consisting of two MCHR1s and two
MCHR2s. The split into MCHR1 and MCHR2 occurred

Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:263

before the divergence of the vertebrate lineage [37]. The
MCHR exists in all vertebrates and its function may be an
evolutionary novelty. In fish, the MCHR acts as a colourregulating hormone receptor in skin, whereas in mammals, it acts in the brain as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator receptor that regulates food intake, energy
homeostasis, stress and behaviour [38]. Figure 6 shows a
neighbour-joining tree for four X. tropicalis MCHRs, two
human MCHRs and two fish MCHRs. Each X. tropicalis
MCHR formed a monophyletic clade with one human or
fish MCHR. This suggests that MCHR1 and MCHR2 gene
duplications occurred before the mammal lineage split
from the amphibian lineage. Subsequent to gene duplication, a new function evolved. In modern-day humans,
only one MCHR1 and one MCHR2 are retained. We investigated the tissue distribution of the four X. tropicalis
MCHRs in order to support our hypothesis. Because of the
lack of EST data in the database, the four MCHR
sequences had a common best EST hit identified as the
MCHR1 specifically expressed in the brain.
The extensive expansion of olfactory/pheromone
receptors
Vertebrate olfactory/pheromone receptors comprise at
least three types of GPCRs: the ORs, V1Rs and V2Rs. In
mammals, these receptors are expressed in two distinct
organs, the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the
vomeronasal organ (VNO) [39]. It seems that the VNO,
which is absent in fish, first evolved in amphibians [40].
In the MOE, ORs bind volatile odorants and are responsible for the conscious perception of odours. In the VNO,
two evolutionarily distinct vomeronasal receptor families
(V1Rs and V2Rs) bind pheromones and are responsible
for various behavioural and neuroendocrine responses
between individuals of the same specie. The ability to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/263

detect these particular molecules from outside is important in that odorant detection is necessary for the survival
of the individual and pheromone detection is necessary
for the survival of the species [41].
As many as 70% of X. tropicalis GPCRs belong to olfactory/
pheromone receptors. In our phylogenetic analysis, most
X. tropicalis olfactory/pheromone receptors were found to
have no one-to-one orthologs in other species. They were
further found to match another gene within the same
genome better than one in the genome of the other species. The orthologous relationships among OR genes are
often one copy to many copies or many copies to many
copies rather than one to one. This indicates that the repertoire of these receptor groups in X. tropicalis have been
shaped by extensive local expansions: new gene family
members have frequently arisen by gene duplication followed by divergence.
Gene expansion is the major mechanism for functional
innovation in the evolution of life [42]. The findings
among vertebrate species suggest that the ability of chemosensation may be largely determined by the number of
related genes [43]. Amphibians occupy a transitional state
in the evolution of air breathing and terrestriality, so the
extensive expansion of olfactory/pheromone receptors
may be an evolutionary adaptation to their special living
environment. Multiple specific receptors help amphibians
extract information from both aquatic and terrestrial environments, which helps them to find food, identify mates
and offspring, recognize territories and avoid danger.
There may be an alternative explanation for these expansions [41]: the lack of specific evolutionary pressure on
these receptors. Because of lower selective constraints on

humans or fish MCHR.

these receptors, new gene family members arose frequently by gene duplication. This hypothesis is supported
by two facts: (i) in our phylogenetic trees, many genes in
the same subfamily clusters are so similar and they are
supposed to play the same physiological function; furthermore, (ii) previous study has shown that large proportion of OR genes consist of pseudogenes (over 53%) in X.
tropicalis [28].

Conclusion
This is the first study of the overall GPCR repertoire in X.
tropicalis. We have identified a total of 1452 GPCR
sequences from the X. tropicalis genome and classified
them into seven receptor families through careful phylogenetic analyses. X. tropicalis shares a more similar repertoire of GPCRs with mammals than it does with fish. A
large percentage (70%) of X. tropicalis GPCRs are related
to the detection of odorants and pheromones in the external environment. The repertoires of these receptors are
shaped by lineage specific expansions which are
demanded by functional innovation or are simply the
results of lower selective constraints. However, the current
analyses are based only on predictions from a preliminary
genome assembly and hence may need to be revised.
X. tropicalis is a suitable model for physiology and biomedical research. It has adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial environments and occupies a useful transitional
state from an evolutionary perspective. The availability of
the repertoire of X. tropicalis GPCRs can yield insights into
the physiological functions of GPCRs and, more importantly, into the evolution of GPCRs in vertebrates.

Methods
Identification of GPCRs
The complete proteome of X. tropicalis was obtained from
the JGI Xenopus tropicalis v4.1 database [9]. Protein transcripts shorter than 250 amino acids were removed as they
were too short to hold seven transmembrane regions.
Transmembrane regions were predicted using the
HMMTOP [44], TMMHMM [45] and SOSUI [46] programs with default settings. For each program, a range of
six to eight predicted TM domains were retrieved into
Temporary file 1.

In this temporary file, some GPCR sequences were still
likely to be missed because a few GPCRs might have under
predicted or over predicted the number of six to eight TM
domains (when we tested on a dataset of 1426 human
GPCRs obtained from GPCRDB, 99% of the receptors had
between six to eight predicted TM domains). To detect the
potential missing GPCRs, additional BLASTP searches
were conducted. GPCR amino acid sequences were downloaded from GPCRDB and included the A-F GPCR classes,
the putative families, the non-classified and the non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/263

GPCR families. We performed a BLASTP search with an Evalue below 10-20 against the complete proteome of X.
tropicalis by using the sequences from GPCRDB as queries.
For each sequence, the top 20 hits longer than 250 amino
acids were extracted into Temporary file 2. These two temporary files were merged together into one database.
CD-HIT was performed with 90% sequence identity to
remove polymorphisms, splice variants, pseudogenes and
duplicates from the database. CDD v2.14 [47] (E-value =
10-4) and Pfam 22.0 [48] (E-value = 0.01) were used for a
GPCR conserved domain search. The remaining
sequences in the database used BLASTP against the NCBI
non-redundant database. The GPCRs were named according to the BLASTP best hit if at least four of the five best
hits were in the same family. Throughout this article the
GPCR families are written in italics.
Phylogenetic analysis
CDD v2.14 (E-value = 10-4) and Pfam 22.0 (E-value =
0.01) were used to identify the borders of the transmembrane region and remove the N- and C-termini. The GPCR
sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.0 [49] with
default alignment parameters. Neighbour-joining trees
were constructed with MEGA4 [50] using the Poisson correction model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Gap sites in
the alignment were not used in the phylogenetic reconstruction (the complete-deletion option). In the phylogenetic tree, we opted to use a suffix of sequence number (or
only the sequence number) for each X. tropicalis receptor
gene. When referring to other species, a one-letter symbol
was used as a prefix (e.g., hGLP1R, zV1R1, etc.).
Tissue expression distribution
The tissue expression distribution of X. tropicalis GPCRs
was investigated based on expressed sequence tag (EST)
data. The X. tropicalis GPCR sequences were queried using
TBLASTN against Xenbase 2.3 database [51] with an Evalue of 1e-15.

Authors' contributions
YJ has carried out the study, participated in the design and
written the first draft of the manuscript. ZZ participated in
the sequence alignment. YH was involved in useful discussions and drafting of the final manuscript. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
