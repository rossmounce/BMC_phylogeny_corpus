Prediction of a novel RNA binding domain in
crocodilepox Zimbabwe Gene 157
Nicole S Little†, Taylor Quon† and Chris Upton*

Abstract
Background: Although the crocodilepox virus (CRV) is currently unclassified, phylogenetic analyses suggest that its
closest known relatives are molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) and the avipox viruses. The CRV genome is
approximately 190 kb and contains a large number of unique genes in addition to the set of conserved
Chordopoxvirus genes found in all such viruses. Upon sequencing the viral genome, others noted that this virus
was also unusual because of the lack of a series of common immuno-suppressive genes. However, the genome
contains multiple genes of unknown function that are likely to function in reducing the anti-viral response of the
host.
Results: By using sensitive database searches for similarity, we observed that gene 157 of CRV-strain Zimbabwe
(CRV-ZWE) encodes a protein with a domain that is predicted to bind dsRNA. Domain characterization supported
this prediction, therefore, we tested the ability of the Robetta protein structure prediction server to model the
amino acid sequence of this protein on a well-characterized RNA binding domain. The model generated by
Robetta suggests that CRV-ZWE-157 does indeed contain an RNA binding domain; the model could be overlaid on
the template protein structure with high confidence.
Conclusion: We hypothesize that CRV-ZWE-157 encodes a novel poxvirus RNA binding protein and suggest that as
a non-core gene it may play a role in host-range determination or function to dampen host anti-viral responses.
Potential targets for this CRV protein include the host interferon response and miRNA pathways.

Background
Crocodilepox virus (CRV) is an unclassified member of
the Poxviridae family and its complete genome spans
190,054 base pairs [1]. The genome of this species is
approximately 61.1% G+C, similar to the genomes of
molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) and the ORF-like
viruses. This relatively high G+C% distinguishes these 3
groups of viruses from other poxviruses; MCV and ORF
are in separate genera, and it is likely that CRV will also
be placed into a separate genus when officially classified.
It is not clear what has driven the genomes of these 3
groups of viruses to become relatively GC-rich while
other poxviruses have drifted towards a high A+T content. It is important to note that although an overall A
+T% is often used to characterize poxvirus genomes, the

individual genes in the viruses vary widely in nucleotide
composition; for example CRV and vaccinia virus
(VACV) genes range in A+T composition from 24-56%
and 54-73%, respectively.
The level of conservation between the ortholog sets
from viruses in the various poxvirus genera varies
greatly (25-50% aa identity), this reflects varying structural and functional constraints on different proteins.
This level of sequence conservation does not hinder
identification and inclusion of CRV proteins into poxvirus ortholog sets, but it does create problems when
the CRV proteins of unknown function are searched
against databases using programs such as BLASTp [2]
since the additional aa changes generated by the pressure to switch to G/C nucleotides reduces the percentage aa identity even though chemically similar aa may
have been substituted.
Poxviruses encode numerous proteins that block the
host anti-viral response, including proteins that resist

the actions of both type I and type II interferons (IFN).
These viruses not only encode soluble receptors that
block IFN activity (orthologs of VACV-Cop B19, B8)
and intracellular inhibitors of IFN activity (orthologs of
VACV-Cop H1, E3, K3, and C7) but also interfere with
host IFN signalling [3,4]. VACV-Cop E3 is a dsRNA
binding protein that blocks the action of the IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). E3 binds
both dsRNA and PKR to inhibit its activity as well as
inhibiting other host molecules that are part of IFN signalling [3].
CRV is interesting because of its diversity from other
poxviruses, but it also creates significant problems for
crocodile farming around the world. Therefore, identifying gene function is of interest in trying to understand
how this virus controls host anti-viral responses and for
potential vaccine design. Such work can also lead to a
better understanding of the reptilian immune system.
Therefore we have used a variety of bioinformatics tools
to try to predict the function of the many CRV proteins
for which the function is currently unknown.

Results and Discussion
Similarity searches for remote homologs of CPV unknown
proteins

65 CPV proteins annotated as unknown function in the
Viral Orthologous Clusters database (VOCs) [5] were
searched against the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein database
using position-specific iterated-BLAST (PSI-BLAST).
The only significant hits returned by these searches
were self-matches to CRV proteins or matches to other
poxvirus orthologs. This was somewhat surprising
because of the recent explosive growth in genome
sequencing, but may reflect the paucity of sequencing of
reptilian or related genomes.
Next, these protein sequences were processed using
the remote homology detection server HHPred [6,7]
through the PDBalert interface [8], which is a more sensitive tool that uses 2° structure information and makes
profile-to-profile searches against structural databases.
Only 5 of the unknown CRV proteins generated significant (probability ≥80%, e-value ≤ 0.05) hits in the PDBalert [8] scoring system. For 2 proteins (CRV-ZWE-016
and CRV-ZWE-028) the matches were due to amino
acid repeats in the protein sequences. These repeats did
not match other protein repeats, but they generated
areas rich in a few amino acids and these triggered
matches to other proteins with regions in those particular amino acids. One match (CRV-ZWE-076), to the
family of flap endonucleases (VACV strain Copenhagen
is G5R), had been discovered previously by using PDBalert [8] (but had not been included in the genome GenBank file which is used to populate the VOCs database),

as had the similarity between CRV-ZWE-078 and the
NLPC/P60 superfamily of proteins [9]. The final significant match, and the focus of this paper, from the PDBalert searches was between CRV-ZWE-157 and a series
of proteins containing dsRNA binding domains (DRBP).
Characterization and Comparative Analysis of CRV-157
and dsRNA binding domains

Prediction of protein function from low similarity alignments, within the so-called twilight zone (<20% identity), is difficult and is best approached by gathering
multiple lines of evidence that can build to form a solid
conclusion. As determined above using PSI-BLAST, it
appears that CRV-ZWE-157 is unique in the known
poxviruses and is not an ortholog of the poxvirus PKR
inhibitor (VACV-Copenhagen-E3L) that also contains a
dsRNA-binding domain. The E3L ortholog of ORF
virus, which also possesses a very GC-rich genome, is
more than 22% identical to any of the poxvirus orthologs so it is unlikely that CRV-ZWE-157 simply fails to
classify with this ortholog family.
When CRV-ZWE-157 was used as input with the
PDBalert tool, more than 15 protein hits were matched
to a dsRNA-binding domain containing protein, each
with a probability score of over 95% and with e-values
less than 5.0 × 10-2. The significant feature of this result
is that many of these proteins were distinct with relatively
low identity scores showing that critical, well-conserved,
amino acids within these dsRNA binding domains were
responsible for the significant scores. Following this discovery, we revisited the PSI-BLAST search results and
noted that although the E-values for the top two hits
were very poor (>0.85), they were both proteins that contained dsRNA-binding domains (data not shown).
The CRV-ZWE-157 primary sequence was also analysed with InterProScan[10], which searches a protein
against a variety of databases containing confirmed and
predicted protein motifs/domains. Only the Gene3D and
Superfamily tools were able detect a dsRNA binding-like
domain in the early region of CRV-157. Ribonuclease III
[11], ATP-dependent RNA helicase A [12], Interferoninducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase activator A
[13], and Maternal effect protein staufen [14] all contain
comparable dsRNA-binding domains.
To appreciate the degree of conservation between the
primary sequences of CRV-ZWE-157 and 3 distinct
DRBPs from the PDBalert results, they were aligned
using multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation
(MUSCLE) [15] and manually refined using the BaseBy-Base editor [16]. The alignment (Figure 1) revealed
that the proteins are only similar over the dsRNA-binding domain (amino acids1-65 of CRV-ZWE-157) and
that the percent identity between CRV-ZWE-157 and
any of these DRBPs was very low (10-30%). However,

dsRNA-binding regions of the other proteins are shown. Asterisks show amino acids crucial for dsRNA binding, dots indicate other perfectly
conserved residues. Lower panel: Red bars represent a helices and green arrows represent b strands; these are aligned with the amino acid

the small set of conserved amino acids are in fact conserved among all of the DRBPs including the key residues required for RNA binding. Of the 5 amino acid
residues critical to Staufen RNA binding [17], 4 are
absolutely conserved in CRV-ZWE-157 and the other
proteins (Figure 1). The RNA binding domain of these
proteins happens to be at the N-terminus, but frequently they are located at other positions. The RNA
binding domain of CRV-ZWE-157 is contained within
the first 65 aa of the 127 aa protein. This also differentiates CRV-ZWE-157 from the poxvirus E3L orthologs
that have a Z-DNA binding domain at the N-terminus
and the dsRNA binding domain at the C-terminus of
the protein [18].
To further assess the prediction that CRV-ZWE-157
contains a dsRNA-binding domain, we used BindN+
[19], a tool that predicts nucleic acid binding regions
from primary protein sequences. This algorithm also
indicated that the N-terminal region of CRV-ZWE-157
could bind RNA and calculated that the sites with the
highest RNA binding affinities were located 1) at the
end of the third b strand/start of the second a-helix and
2) and the end of the first a-helix. This is in agreement
with the later modeling experiment (see below).
The secondary structure of almost all dsRNA-binding
domains consists of two a helices that lie on a threestranded anti-parallel beta sheet to produce a characteristic a-b-b-b-a fold [20]. Jpred [21] predicted this exact
pattern in the N-terminus of CRV-ZWE-157 with minor
variations in the lengths of the secondary structure units
(data not shown).
Structure Modeling of CRV-157

Given the preceding support that the CRV-ZWE-157
protein contains a RNA binding domain we submitted

the protein sequence to the Robetta structural modeling
server [22]. Robetta produced 5 models of CRV-157 (1127). The 3D models for CRV-ZWE-157 developed
from Robetta used the human TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP; PDB:2CPN) as a reference parent. TRBP is
involved in RNA interference (RNAi) and affects the
pathway through associations with the enzyme Dicer,
which may be involved in the initiation process of RNAi
[23]. Dicer requires the association of TRBP, which
facilitates the recruitment of siRNA to Ago2 bound by
Dicer and miRNA processing by Dicer [24]. DiGeorge
syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8), which takes
part in the recognition of primary microRNA substrates
prior to cleavage ([PDB:2YT4] [25]), was subsequently
used for the creation of the full 3D models. However,
this does not imply that any particular DRBP is significantly more similar to the CRV protein. The Ginzu
module [26] of Robetta that predicts domain architecture of proteins also separated CRV-ZWE-157 into the
DRBP-like N-terminal domain and the C-terminal (aa
70-127) domain with a confidence of 2.27, which corresponds to a 96.5% probability in HHSearch [6]; Robetta
found no hits for the C-terminal domain. I-TASSER
[27,28], another protein structure and function prediction server, supported the choice of DGCR8
([PDB:2YT4] [25]) as the best model for the N-terminal
domain of CRV-ZWE-157. The results of the Robetta
prediction are shown in Figure 2 with cartoon and
space-filling formats. Both the overall structure and distribution of surface charge on the predicted CRV-ZWE157 structure are very similar to the known structures
of the three DRBPs shown in Figure 3.
The secondary structure of dsRNA-binding domains
can be divided into three motifs [29]. The first motif is
an a helix, the second motif consists of the three b

strands and the last is another a-helix. As shown in Figure 1 (bottom panel) the secondary structure of the
CRV-ZWE-157 model agrees very well with the actual
secondary structure of known DRBP structures. Several
structures of DRBPs bound with RNA have been solved;
the first and second domains display a relatively neutral
charge and interact with the dsRNA minor groove,
while the third domain has a net positive charge that
supports interactions with phosphate backbone of the
major groove (Figure 3). Substitutions with arginine in
this second a helix maintain strong binding to the
major groove [30]. Generally, the first a-helix and the b
sheet are less well conserved and are thought to act primarily as a scaffold for the second helix by binding to
the RNA minor groove [31]. The DRBPs do not bind
RNA through specific nucleotide sequences. This is
thought to be due to the fact that the interactions with
the minor grooves are water-mediated and allow greater
flexibility [32].
To provide support of the similarity of the CRV-ZWE157 model and the known structures we used Chimera
[33] to superimpose the CRV and DGCR8 structures
(Figure 4). These two structures generated a root mean
square deviation (RMSD) of 1.67 Å over 62 alpha

Page 5 of 7

carbon pairs whereas the RMSD for CRV and TRBP2
was 1.76 Å over 55 alpha carbon pairs. The RMSD for
the superimposition of DGCR8 and TRBP2 DRBPs was
only slightly better at 1.502 Å over 63 alpha carbons.
Genomic localization and Possible Origins of CRV-ZWE157

As discussed above, the CRV-ZWE-157 protein is not
an ortholog of the VACV-Copenhagen E3L RNA-binding protein. The CRV gene is located approximately 25
kb from the right end of the genome in a region mostly
populated by hypothetical genes of unknown function
that are unique to CRV. Thus, there is little information
to be gleaned from the location of this gene to indicate
a possible origin. However, it is interesting that the
CRV-ZWE-157 gene contains only 51.3% G+C, which is
relatively low for the CRV genome, whereas the set of
80 core chordopoxvirus CRV genes have a G+C range
of 52-76% with a mean of 64% and the non-core CRV
genes have a G+C range of 45-73% and a mean of 59%.
Thus, this gene and flanking regions appear to be distinct from the bulk of the genome and the comparatively low G+C content of CRV-157 offers support for
its acquisition from the host. There are also numerous

Little et al. Microbial Informatics and Experimentation 2011, 1:12

such regions scattered throughout the genome that may
represent areas that have been acquired via horizontal
transfer of DNA, most probably from a host [34].

Conclusions
This bioinformatics study has gathered several lines of
evidence to support the hypothesis that the CRV-ZWE157 protein contains an N-terminal dsRNA-binding
motif. HHpred searches matched a number of DRBPs to
the CRV protein and Jpred predicted an a-b-b-b-a fold
that is standard in all DRBPs. Perhaps the most conclusive evidence is the fact that Robetta successfully modeled the CRV-ZWE-157 amino acid sequence onto the
structure of known DRBPs placing the few highly conserved amino acids in the correct location for interactions with dsRNA. The data supports the hypothesis
that the CRV-ZWE-157 is unique in poxviruses and that
this gene has been acquired from a CRV host since the
virus evolved from the last known common ancestral
virus.
DsRNA-binding domains are not sequence specific
and are often present in association with a variety of
other functioning protein domains including those
involved in mRNA localization [17], inhibition of interferon activity [35], Z-DNA binding as part of virus
pathogenesis [36], and providing platforms for multiprotein complex assembly through WW domains
[37,38]. Unfortunately, analysis of the C-terminal half of
CRV-ZWE-157 gave no clue as to the possible function
of this domain. However, given that this protein is
unique among the poxviruses, it is clearly not one of the
“essential poxvirus genes”. Two possible scenarios are
that it functions in a unique host-range capacity or as a
novel virulence factor. For the latter, the dsRNA-binding
domain suggests possible functions that include the
blocking of interferon function, well known in poxviruses, or a role in the processing of miRNAs.
Methods
All poxvirus genome, gene and protein sequences were
obtained from the VOCs database [5]; other protein
sequences were downloaded from the NCBI databases.
Protein crystal structures models were retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and referenced by its PDB
ID in parentheses. Searches for remote homologs were
initially conducted with PSI-BLAST [2] with subsequent
searches using HHPred [6,7] via the PDBalert interface
[8]. InterProScan [10] with its associated domain analysis tools was run at the European Bioinformatics Institute web site. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of
protein sequences were generated using MUSCLE [15],
which has been incorporated into the Base-By-Base
MSA editor [16]. Complete poxvirus genomes were
visualized and analysed using the Viral Genome

Organizer (VGO; [39]) tool at the Viral Bioinformatics
Resource Centre (VBRC [40]).
Prediction of the secondary structure of CRV-ZWE-157
and other DRBPs was performed with the Jpred secondary
structure prediction server [21] and BindN was used to
calculate regions that were likely to bind RNA based on
amino acid side chain pK a, hydrophobicity, and amino
acid molecular mass [19]. The Robetta protein structure
prediction server [22] was used to determine if the amino
acid sequence of CRV-157 could be modeled onto the
structure of known DRBPs with confirmation using ITASSER [27,28]. Protein structures were displayed using
Chimera [33] and JMol [41]. Secondary structure information used in the MSA was extracted from the 3D structures using the Kabsch and Sander algorithm for defining
the secondary structure of proteins (ksdssp) module [42]
of Chimera. The electrostatic surface representations of
the CRV-ZWE-157 protein structure and the DRBP template were produced by the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann
Solver (APBS) plugin [43] in PyMOL [44]
