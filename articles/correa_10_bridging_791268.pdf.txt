Abstract
Background: Lymnaeidae snails play a prominent role in the transmission of helminths, mainly trematodes of
medical and veterinary importance (e.g., Fasciola liver flukes). As this family exhibits a great diversity in shell
morphology but extremely homogeneous anatomical traits, the systematics of Lymnaeidae has long been
controversial. Using the most complete dataset to date, we examined phylogenetic relationships among 50 taxa of
this family using a supermatrix approach (concatenation of the 16 S, ITS-1 and ITS-2 genes, representing 5054 base
pairs) involving both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference.
Results: Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the existence of three deep clades of Lymnaeidae representing
the main geographic origin of species (America, Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region). This phylogeny allowed us to
discuss on potential biological invasions and map important characters, such as, the susceptibility to infection by
Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, and the haploid number of chromosomes (n). We found that intermediate hosts
of F. gigantica cluster within one deep clade, while intermediate hosts of F. hepatica are widely spread across the
phylogeny. In addition, chromosome number seems to have evolved from n = 18 to n = 17 and n = 16.
Conclusion: Our study contributes to deepen our understanding of Lymnaeidae phylogeny by both sampling at
worldwide scale and combining information from various genes (supermatrix approach). This phylogeny provides
insights into the evolutionary relationships among genera and species and demonstrates that the nomenclature of
most genera in the Lymnaeidae does not reflect evolutionary relationships. This study highlights the importance of
performing basic studies in systematics to guide epidemiological control programs.

Background
Basommatophora (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) is a suborder
comprising essentially all pulmonate gastropods living in
freshwater. Basommatophorans are monophyletic and
encompass five families: Acroloxidae, Chilinidae, Lymnaeidae, Physidae, and Planorbidae (including the Ancylidae) [1]. The group contains ~300 species and has
been extensively studied because some species have a
role in transmitting parasites of human and veterinary
importance (e.g., Schistosoma and Fasciola). The Lymnaeidae, Physidae and Planorbidae comprise ~90% of

the Basommatophoran species [1,2]. The phylogenetic
relationships within the Physidae and Planorbidae are
now well established (e.g., [3-5]). However, the phylogeny of the Lymnaeidae has only been partially inferred
[6-11] and we currently lack a comprehensive treatment
of this family.
Lymnaeidae snails are distributed worldwide [12-14].
They are of major medical and veterinary importance
since they act as vectors of parasites that severely affect
human populations and livestock, and cause important
economic losses [15,16]. Indeed, lymnaeids serve as
intermediate hosts of at least 71 trematode species distributed among 13 families [17,18], including some species of Schistosomatidae and Echinostomatidae, with
implications for human health [19,20], and Paramphistomum daubneyi, which is of veterinary interest [21].

Undoubtedly, the most emblematic case of parasite
transmitted by lymnaeids is Fasciola hepatica (Digenea:
Fasciolidae), the agent of fascioliasis. The disease it
causes is recognized as a major veterinary problem as it
is responsible of the loss of productive capacity (e.g.,
meat, milk). Fascioliasis is also an important human disease with about 20 million cases around the world [22].
Fasciola hepatica presumably originates from Europe
and now has a worldwide distribution. The definitive
hosts of this parasite are vertebrates, usually mammals,
e.g., cows, sheep, goats, buffalos, and also humans. Mollusks, generally lymnaeids, are required as intermediate
hosts to complete the life cycle. At least 20 species of
Lymnaeidae have been described as potential vectors of
fascioliasis (see reviews in [17,23,24]). Due to the important role of these species as intermediate hosts of trematodes, a solid phylogenetic framework of Lymnaeidae is
required. The correct identification of intermediate-host
species should help characterize areas of epidemiological
risk and increase our understanding of the evolution of
the Lymnaeidae- Fasciola host-parasite interaction.
Lymnaeidae exhibit a great diversity in shell morphology which is linked to substantial eco-phenotypic plasticity (see e.g., [25,26]). Hubendick [12] illustrated this
point by compiling up to 1143 species names, a large
number of which he synonymized. In contrast, the anatomy of their reproductive tracts (including prostate,
penis and preputium) is extremely homogeneous (e.g.,
[1,27,28]). Immunological [29], cytogenetical [30,31],
enzyme electrophoresis studies [25,32,33], and DNAbased approaches [7,10] have demonstrated extensive
homoplasy in anatomical characters [12,26,34-38]. The
difference between patterns in shell morphology and
anatomy explains why lymnaeid systematics has been
controversial [6]. Today, it is accepted that the total
number of species might be less than 100 [1], with most
occurring in the Palearctic and Nearctic regions [2].
Although some effort has been done to resolve their
phylogenetic relationships, the small number of genes or
species considered (e.g., a single gene in [7]) and limited
geographical coverage (e.g., Neotropic in [10], Australasia in [11] and ancient European lakes in [39]) represent
severe limitations and biases. Furthermore, some wellrecognized species have never been considered (e.g., the
Neotropical species Lymnaea cousini and L. diaphana).
These limitations and biases have generated gaps in our
understanding of their biogeographic patterns, and their
epidemiology in areas of high endemicity of trematode
diseases (e.g., South America; [40]).
In this paper, we contribute to fill these gaps by performing a phylogenetic analysis using a supermatrix
approach. We infer the most complete phylogeny to
date in Lymnaeidae using sequences of 50 taxa (i.e.,
approximately half of the supposed diversity of the

Page 2 of 12

family) covering most Neotropical species (including the
unstudied L. diaphana, L. cousini and Lymnaea sp. from
Colombia). Using this phylogenetic framework, we analyze how susceptibility to infection by F. hepatica and
F. gigantica (the sister-species of F. hepatica mainly
responsible for fascioliasis in Asia and Africa) has
evolved. In addition, this phylogeny allows us to establish biogeographic aspects, to pinpoint potential biological invasions, and determine the evolution of
chromosome numbers.

Methods
Sampling

Sequences of one to three genes among the two nuclear
internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA (ITS1 and ITS-2) and the mitochondrial 16 S ribosomal
DNA of 38 lymnaeid species and two outgroups, the
planorbids Bulinus forskalii and Biomphalaria tenagophila (Planorbidae), were retrieved from GenBank
(Table 1). We chose these three genes because they are
highly variable and have been extensively used in phylogenetic studies of Lymnaeidae. They represent most
known clades of this family (e.g., [6,7,9-11,41]). In addition, living individuals of 12 lymnaeid species and an
additional outgroup, Physa acuta (Physidae), were collected in 13 populations sampled in a variety of countries/continents (Table 1). Sampled individuals were
stored in 80% ethanol for DNA analyses.
Genus names are still fluctuating in Lymnaeidae.
However, we conserved the names given in GenBank for
the sequences retrieved there in order to facilitate comparisons between this and previous studies. For the species we sampled, we adopted the widely accepted genus
Lymnaea for all species, except for Galba truncatula,
Omphiscola glabra, Pseudosuccinea columella and Radix
peregra (see Table 1).
DNA Extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Amplification

Total DNA was isolated from the distal part of the foot.
We carefully controlled for trematode presence during
dissection in order to avoid exogen DNA. Extractions
were performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen) according to manufacturers’ instructions. The
two nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and
ITS-2) and the 16 S gene were amplified using published primers [6,42] (Table 2). PCR amplification was
performed for each pair of primers in a total volume of
25 μl containing 5 μl of PCR reaction buffer 5×, 2.5
mM MgCl 2 , 200 μM of each dNTP, 10 pmol of each
primer, 1 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 2
μl of DNA template. Temperature cycling for the ITS-1
and ITS-2 was as follows: 94°C for 2 min, 94°C for 30
sec, 50°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec, repeated for 30

sec, 50°C for 8 sec, 72°C for 1.5 min and 25 times at 93°

μl) were checked on 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer.
DNA sequencing was performed by CoGenics Genome
Express (Meylan, France) using PCR-amplified products
as templates.
Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analyses

We aligned ITS-1, ITS-2 and 16 S sequences of 50 lymnaeid species and the three outgroups using Prank v.
100311 [43]. Prank is based on an algorithm that can
distinguish insertions from deletions and avoid repeated
penalization of insertions. Compared to Clustal-W and
Muscle, it considerably improves the alignment quality
especially in highly variable sequences such as ITSs.
Alignments of individual genes were concatenated in a
supermatrix with the seqCat.pl v1.0 script [44].
Two different approaches of tree reconstruction, Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI),
were implemented. Analyses were performed by partitioning the supermatrix on the basis of individual loci.
ML analyses were conducted using the best-fitting
model of sequence evolution. Model selection was based
on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) using ModelTest 3.7 [45]. ML trees and the corresponding bootstrap
supporting values (BP) of the nodes were obtained with
PAUP* 4.0b10 [46] using heuristic search with neighbor-joining starting tree, tree bissection-reconnection
swapping and 100 bootstrap replicates. BI analyses were
performed with MrBayes 3.2 [47]. The tree space was
explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

analyses with random starting trees, five simultaneous,
sequentially heated independent chains sampled every
500 trees during five million generations. Suboptimal
trees were discarded once the “burn-in” phase was identified and a majority-rule consensus tree, with posterior
probability support of nodes (PP), was constructed with
the remaining trees.
Susceptibility to Infection by Fasciola hepatica and F.
gigantica, and the Evolution of the Chromosome Number
in Lymnaeidae

We searched available information on susceptibility to
infection by F. hepatica and F. gigantica, derived from
either analyses of natural populations or from experimental infections, in all species considered using the ISI
Web of Science (Thompson-Reuters). We recorded the
susceptible or not susceptible status for each species
(Table 3). In addition, the haploid number of chromosomes (n) was obtained from previous publications
[7,11,31,48].

Results
A Comprehensive Phylogeny of Lymnaeidae

The ML and BI trees inferred with the alignment of the
supermatrix including 50 Lymnaeidae species and three
outgroups (5054 aligned sites) were extremely similar,
although some node supports varied between the two
approaches. The best model describing the evolution of
the supermatrix was TVM+I+G (proportion of invariable sites = 0.2298; shape parameter = 0.8159). Overall,
the clades obtained here are consistent with previous
results [7-9,18,39,41]. Three deeply-rooted clades (hereafter C1, C2 and C3) were detected, basically matching
the geographic origin of species (Figure 1). The C1
clade (n = 18) included all American species and two

species thought to originate from Europe (Galba truncatula and Lymnaea occulta = Catascopia occulta),
although the inclusion of Pseudosuccinea columella was
only weakly supported (0.18 BP and 0.30 PP). Two
highly supported subclades can be recognized within
this clade. The first one (C1a) included the South American L. diaphana, the North American Stagnicola caperata, the European L. occulta (= C. occulta), and all
other North American Stagnicola. The second subclade
(C1b) grouped the South American L. cousini with the
North American Fossaria obrussa and L. humilis, on the
one hand, and the European G. truncatula, Neotropical
L. cubensis (= Bakerilymnaea cubensis), L. neotropica
and L. viatrix, the North American F. bulimoides and
Lymnaea sp. from Colombia, on the other hand.
The C2 clade (n = 18) consisted of exclusively Eurasian species. In this clade, Omphiscola glabra (a smallshelled, morphologically distinct species) first diverged
from all other species, including most large-bodied species found in Europe (excluding Radix spp.). This was

[9]
[73]

followed by divergence of L. stagnalis, L. corvus (= S.
corvus), L. fuscus, Stagnicola sp. EEAR-Ukraine-2002, L.
palustris (= S. palustris) and S. turricola (= L. palustris
turricola). These relationships are identical to those
reported in [7,8,18].
The C3 clade contained all Australasian and Radix
species, including the African Lymnaea (Radix) natalensis. ML and BI analyses indicated that there were two
subclades within C3. The first one (C3a) was formed by
Austropeplea lessoni and Bullastra cumingiana (n = 16),
A. tomentosa and Kutikina hispidina (n = 16), and a
subclade grouping A. ollula and A. viridis (= L. viridis)
(n = 16), on the one hand; and Lymnaea sp. EEARChina-2002 and Lymnaea sp. EEAR-Hawaii-2002 (n =
18 according to [48] and [11]; n = 16 according to [7]),
on the other hand. The second subclade (C3b) consisted
of all Radix species (n = 17), including L. (R.) natalensis,
and included two monophyletic groups. The first one
was formed by Radix labiata sister to R. peregra,
R. ampla and R. lagotis. Note that our samples of

Correa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:381
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/381

R. peregra from Southern France clustered within the
MOTU2 clade described in [26] with no ambiguity,
based on analyses of COI and ITS-1 sequences (results
not shown). The second, more recently derived clade,
was formed by R. auricularia and R. ovata which were
sister to a clade comprising Radix sp. EEAR-Philippines2002, Radix sp. EEAR-Canada-2002 and Radix
sp. EEAR-Romania-2002, L. (R.) natalensis sister to
R. luteola, and R. quadrasi sister to R. rubiginosa.

Discussion
A Comprehensive Phylogeny of Lymnaeidae

Recent studies have suggested that the Lymnaeidae contains approximately 100 species [1,2], meaning that our
phylogeny represents approximately half the existing
diversity of the family. The tree presented in Figure 1
indicates that species cluster by geographic origin in
three deep clades. One is almost entirely composed of
American species, while the two others are from the
Old World. The split between the American C1 clade
and Old World C2 clade probably dates back to the
opening of the Atlantic Ocean 160-130 million years
ago (Mya). This date is reasonable given the fossil
record suggests the divergence of Physidae-Lymnaeidae
took place near the Jurassic period (~200-145 Mya;
[49]).
Concerning the American clade (C1) various aspects
should be highlighted. Our study is the first to include
L. diaphana in a phylogenetic analysis and suggests that
this species is sister to the North American Stagnicola
and L. occulta (= C. occulta) (clade C1a), although with
low support (0.54 BP and 0.71 PP). Baker [50] reported
L. diaphana in South Dakota, consistent with a possible
North American origin. However, the species was originally described from southern South America (Strait
of Magellan, Chile; [51]) and is currently found in
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. It could be
either that the current distribution of L. diaphana in
South America is not representative of its North American origin or that the ancestor of clade C1a was originally from South America and then migrated northwards,
where it gave origin to the Stagnicola of clade C1a. A
further point is that L. occulta (= C. occulta) from
Poland is unambiguously grouped with this clade and
agrees with [41]. This is unexpected as this species is
thought to originate from Europe, and was formerly
grouped, on the basis of anatomical characters, together
with the European L. palustris (= S. palustris) and S.
turricola (= L. palustris turricola), which appear, as
expected, in a predominantly European clade (C2). We
hypothesize that L. occulta was actually introduced in
Europe from North American populations (see below).
Finally, our results do not contradict the hypothesis that
S. emarginata, S. elodes and S. catascopium are

conspecifics, as suggested by [6] and [18]. If this is true,
Stagnicola sp. EEAR-Manitoba-2002 should also be
synonymized with these three taxa.
Species with similar shell morphology (G. truncatulalike) in the C1b clade cluster together. The only exception is L. cousini which clearly belongs to this clade
(with maximal BP and PP values) but is morphologically
different from all other species in terms of both shell
morphology and the anatomy of reproductive organs. Its
phylogenetic position suggests the ancestor of clade C1b
had a G. truncatula-like morphology and the L. cousini
morphology is a derived character. The inclusion of
G. truncatula within this clade is unambiguous and
agrees with previous results [10]. This species has always
been considered a native from the Old World, occurring
in Europe, Russia, and North Africa, and to have been
recently introduced to South America [32,52]. Our phylogeny suggests that G. truncatula represents a branch
of an American clade that reached the Old World,
where it has evolved and diverged from its American
sister species (see below). Interestingly, Lymnaea sp.
from Colombia, previously described as G. truncatula
[53], was unambiguously identified as a distinct taxonomic entity, yet to be sequenced. We currently lack
sequences and population-genetic studies of several taxa
described in North America presenting morphological
similarities with Lymnaea sp. Therefore, we are not in
position to ascertain that this is a new species and to
determine whether it is endemic or has been introduced
to South America. Thus, we refrain from describing this
entity as a new species to avoid adding more noise to
the already confusing systematics of the Lymnaeidae.
The second deep clade (C2) consists exclusively of
Eurasian species, and species branching agrees [7] and
[18]. It does not contradict the hypothesis that L. palustris (= S. palustris) and S. turricola (= L. palustris turricola) are synonymous, as proposed by [18]. These two
taxa indeed only differ by two anatomical characters
(preputium length to penis length ratio, and the relative
length of the distal part of the prostate) [54].
The third deep clade (C3) includes all species inhabiting Australia and the Indo-Pacific region, as well as
Radix species. According to this tree, Austropeplea is a
polyphyletic genus, in agreement with results obtained
by [6], [7] and [11]. Remigio [7] suggested monophyly of
Autropeplea spp., Bullastra cumingiana, Lymnaea sp.
EEAR-China-2002 and Lymnaea sp. EEAR-Hawaii-2002.
Our results indicate that Kutikina hispida and Lymnaea
gen. sp. from Hawaii are also members of this clade. On
the other hand, Radix seems to be a monophyletic
genus, in agreement with [8], [11], [18] and [26], but in
contradiction with results of [6] and [7]. Importantly, L.
(R.) natalensis, the only known endemic African species,
branched unambiguously within the Radix clade, in

agreement with [39], sister to R. luteola from Sri Lanka.
This result confirms that the name Radix natalensis better reflects its phyletic relationships than does Lymnaea
natalensis. Our results do not support the hypothesis
that R. peregra and R. ovata are synonymous [18]. Their

synonymy is indeed still a controversial matter
[26,38,55]. Alternatively, R. peregra, R. ampla and
R. lagotis are closely related taxa, in agreement with
[18], and might potentially be conspecifics, although
confirmation using mating experiments seems necessary.

Correa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:381
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/381

In summary (and ignoring recent introductions) we
have three old centers of diversification in the Lymnaeidae family: America, Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region.
In the latter, the Radix clade diversified and then
expanded towards Eurasia and Africa. This is also true
of G. truncatula, a branch of the American clade that
invaded the Old World. In general, the Lymnaeidae
morphology has evolved slowly and most species within
clades are similar: small-shelled turriform, G. truncatula-like in the American clade; large and high-spired
shells in the Eurasian Lymnaea; and large, rounded or
ovate shells in the Indo-Pacific clade, especially in
Radix. A few branches, including O. glabra, and L. cousini, have evolved distinctive morphologies that differ
from all other lymnaeids. Note, however, that limpetshaped species (e.g., Lanx) were not analyzed here, and
it is not possible to discuss their phylogenetic position
and morphological evolution. If they constitute a separate clade, say C4, our hypothesis of slow morphological
evolution would be valid.
Concerning chromosome numbers, [31] and [56]
hypothesized that evolution in Lymnaeidae proceeded
from low (n = 16) to high (n = 17 and 18) values.
Accordingly, Austropeplea with 16 chromosome pairs
was thought to be the most “primitive” form, followed
by Radix with 17 pairs and Stagnicola with 18 pairs.
Our molecular phylogeny contradicts this idea. The
ancestral state in Lymnaeidae seems to be n = 18, as it
is in other Basommatophoran gastropods (Chilinidae,
Lancinae, Latiidae, Planorbidae and Physidae) [57]. Eighteen pairs of chromosomes is likely to be a pleisomorphic character, in agreement with [6] and [7], and
thus species of clades C3a (n = 16) and C3b (n = 17)
would represent derived rather than ancestral states.
Remigio [7] suggested that n = 16 evolved from n = 17.
Our results do not contradict this idea, although it is
difficult to infer the number of chromosomes for the
ancestor of clade C3. In addition, if Lymnaea spp. from
Hawaii and China have indeed 18 chromosome pairs, as
suggested by [11], either a reversion from n = 16 to n =
18 or three independent evolutions to n = 16 would be
required (Figure 1).
Nomenclature in Lymnaeidae

The nomenclature of genera has been one of the most
confusing issues in the Lymnaeidae systematics. Most
genus names are not fixed and are based more on phenotypic resemblances than on sound evolutionary and
phylogenetic considerations. For instance, a single genus
was recognized by [58], two by [12], and up to 34 genera by others [13,59-62]. Our results indicate that genera
in Lymnaeidae do not reflect phylogenetic relationships,
to the notable exception of Radix (including L. (R.)
natalensis).

Page 8 of 12

The type species of Lymnaea is L. stagnalis Linnaeus,
1758; the type species of Stagnicola Jeffreys, 1830 is
S. palustris (= L. palustris); and the type species of
Omphiscola Rafinesque, 1819 is O. glabra. However, it is
clear from our results that these three species belong to
the same clade (C2) and that Lymnaea is not a monophyletic group. We propose that species of clade C2
should all be called Lymnaea, according to the principle
of priority of the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN). By extension, Stagnicola should
not be used to name species in clade C1a since the type
species belongs to clade C2. Meier-Brook and Bargues
[63] suggested including S. emarginata, S. elodes, S. catascopium and L. occulta within a new genus Catascopium, while S. caperata would belong to the genus
Hinkleyia Baker, 1928 [8]. Our phylogeny does not conflict with this nomenclature, although it would seem
preferable to identify all species of clade C1a with the
same name to reflect the close evolutionary relationships
among these species. Hinkleyia would be the preferable
name according to the ICZN. On the other hand, at
least four genera names have been used for species of
clade C1b: Lymnaea Lamarck, 1799; Galba Schrank,
1803; Fossaria Westerlund, 1885; and Bakerilymnaea. In
the light of the present results, it would be preferable to
unify nomenclature. According to the ICZN, Lymnaea
should be the unified name, but given that the type species belongs to clade C2, Galba could be a more appropriate name. Finally, as said above, Austropeplea Cotton,
1942 is not a monophyletic group, and employing the
genus Kutikina Ponder and Waterhouse, 1997 (one species: K. hispida) seems unjustified on the basis of the
current phylogeny. This would also be consistent with
results of [11]. It would be preferable to use Bullastra
Pfeiffer, 1839 for all species of clade C3a to fit the
ICZN.
Unravelling Biological Invasions of Lymnaeidae using the
Phylogeny

Although the Lymnaeidae phylogeny presented in Figure
1 matches reasonably well with the geographical origin
of samples, some species clustered in clades with different geographic origins stand out and potentially correspond to biological invasions of a more or less recent
origin. From an epidemiological standpoint, this is a key
issue because some lymnaeid species are more susceptible than others to trematode infection, hence biological
invasions can help explain the broad geographic distribution of fascioliasis and in determining the risks for
veterinary and public health (see e.g. [64]).
First, one of our most puzzling results concerns the
origin of G. truncatula Müller, 1774, the main vector of
fascioliasis in the Old World. The idea that this species
is native to Europe, as it was described from Germany,

Correa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:381
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/381

is widely accepted [65]. However, a very different picture
emerges from our phylogeny: it is the only European
species branching with the wholly American clade C1b.
This strongly suggests that America is where G. truncatula originated. This is consistent with its detection in
Alaska and the Yukon territory [50]. It is possible the
current distribution of G. truncatula in North America
is broader, but has remained cryptic because it has been
confounded with other taxa. Indeed, Hubendick noted
that, “it is a matter of some doubt whether Lymnaea
humilis in North America is a distinct species or is specifically connected to L. truncatula“ (= G. truncatula)
[66]. It could be that some populations of L. humilis in
reality correspond to G. truncatula. At least 10 species
of Lymnaeidae from North America placed in synonymy
of L. humilis by [12], but considered as valid by [13],
present conchological similarities with G. truncatula:
L. galbana Say, 1825; L. modicella Say, 1825; L. obrussa
Say, 1825; L. parva Lea, 1841; L. exigua Lea, 1841;
L. rustica Lea, 1841; L. tazevelliana Wolf, 1869; L. dalli
Baker, 1906; L. cyclostoma Walker, 1908; and L. peninsulae Walker, 1908. Unfortunately, neither detailed anatomical descriptions nor molecular data are available in
any of these taxa. Sampling and sequencing of morphologically similar North American taxa could shed light
on this question.
Second, as mentioned above, L. occulta (= C. occulta)
is the only species from Europe clustering within clade
C2 and seems to correspond to a passage from North
America to Europe. As stated by [8] (and references
therein), L. occulta is distributed in eastern Germany,
Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Sweden, and some rivers in the delta of
Lake Baikal. It is hypothesized that the species could
reach the far east Asia where it could have been confounded with other stagnicoline species because of similarity in shell morphology [12]. In any case, it seems
clear that L. occulta has its origins in America.
Finally, the two Radix sp. are likely introductions originating from the Indo-Pacific area to Canada and
Romania. The fact that these two sister taxa (potentially
the same species) are found in distant geographic locations is indicative of recent introductions.
The Relationships between Lymnaeidae and Fasciola
hepatica and F. gigantica

From an epidemiological standpoint, digenetic trematodes show marked specificity for their intermediate
hosts but can infect a broad spectrum of definite hosts.
Usually, species are oioxenous (one parasite species: one
snail species) or stenoxenous (one parasite species: a
few, closely related snail species) [67]. This is because
when the infectious form of the parasite (the miracidium) enters a snail, it must encounter an internal

Page 9 of 12

physiological and biochemical environment that supports its complete development. However, the case of
F. hepatica seems to be different. Our results show that
lymnaeid species serving as intermediate hosts of this
trematode are widely distributed across the phylogeny
(Figure 1). Basically, all clades contain species that have
proven to be naturally or experimentally infected with
this parasite. Only a few species have been shown to be
resistant to infection (Table 3). In contrast, species
involved in F. gigantica transmission are more clustered
in the phylogeny (Figure 1). Although not all species are
equally susceptible to infection by F. hepatica, the broad
capacity of this parasite to infect phylogenetically distant
species is remarkable. The Lymnaeidae-Fasciola system
differs from the well known Planorbidae-Schistosoma
system, in which each trematode species infects a narrow group of hosts that share a close phylogenetic relationship [4]. The behavior of F. hepatica with respect to
Lymnaeidae is of paramount importance in epidemiology control programs: rather than focusing on a single,
or a handful of snail species, fascioliasis control programs should cover a broader spectrum of intermediate
hosts that inhabit diverse habitats and ecological conditions. Our results confirm that the presence of F. hepatica in all continents is strongly favored by its capacity
to infect local lymnaeids. Based on these results, it
seems that all geographic regions in the world are
exposed to the epidemiological risk of fascioliasis.

Conclusion
At least four conclusions can be drawn from this study.
First, combining information from different genes
(supermatrix) is a robust approach to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of the Lymnaeidae. Our results
indicate that members of this family diverged in three
deeply-rooted clades corresponding to the geographic
origin of species (America, Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific
region). Our phylogeny allowed us to pinpoint discordances between ancestral and current geographic distributions of some species, potentially indicating more or
less recent biological invasions. Transfers from America
to Eurasia are suggested for G. truncatula and L. occulta
(= C. occulta), as well as passages from the Indo-Pacific
to Europe and North America for Radix sp. However,
sampling and sequencing efforts remain to be done
especially in the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions in
which the family diversity is thought to be the largest.
This would help resolve the weakly supported relationships (e.g., P. columella), determine the pace of morphological evolution, establish taxonomic synonymy, and
determine the phylogenetic relevance of poorly known
genera (e.g., Acella, Lantzia, Lanx and Myxas). Second,
with the exception of Radix (including the African L.
(R.) natalensis), genus names in Lymnaeidae do not

Correa et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:381
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/381

reflect the phyletic relationships among species. The
group taxonomy should be reconsidered to gain some
biological meaning. Third, the number of chromosomes
in Lymnaeidae has evolved from an ancestral state of 18
pairs to a derived 17 and 16 pairs. Finally, while the
intermediate hosts of F. gigantica are basically restricted
to clade C3, F. hepatica is able to infect species from all
main clades (C1, C2 and C3). This suggests that the cosmopolitan distribution of F. hepatica is largely favored
by its capacity to infect local lymnaeids, and highlights
the importance of the correct identification of intermediate-host species in fascioliasis control programs.
