Abstract
Background: Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., is one of the most important food and forage
legumes in the semi-arid tropics because of its drought tolerance and ability to grow on poor
quality soils. Approximately 80% of cowpea production takes place in the dry savannahs of tropical
West and Central Africa, mostly by poor subsistence farmers. Despite its economic and social
importance in the developing world, cowpea remains to a large extent an underexploited crop.
Among the major goals of cowpea breeding and improvement programs is the stacking of desirable
agronomic traits, such as disease and pest resistance and response to abiotic stresses.
Implementation of marker-assisted selection and breeding programs is severely limited by a paucity
of trait-linked markers and a general lack of information on gene structure and organization. With
a nuclear genome size estimated at ~620 Mb, the cowpea genome is an ideal target for reduced
representation sequencing.
Results: We report here the sequencing and analysis of the gene-rich, hypomethylated portion of
the cowpea genome selectively cloned by methylation filtration (MF) technology. Over 250,000
gene-space sequence reads (GSRs) with an average length of 610 bp were generated, yielding ~160
Mb of sequence information. The GSRs were assembled, annotated by BLAST homology searches
of four public protein annotation databases and four plant proteomes (A. thaliana, M. truncatula, O.
sativa, and P. trichocarpa), and analyzed using various domain and gene modeling tools. A total of
41,260 GSR assemblies and singletons were annotated, of which 19,786 have unique GenBank
accession numbers. Within the GSR dataset, 29% of the sequences were annotated using the
Arabidopsis Gene Ontology (GO) with the largest categories of assigned function being catalytic
activity and metabolic processes, groups that include the majority of cellular enzymes and
components of amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. A total of 5,888 GSRs had homology
to genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) and transcription associated factors (TAFs)
representing about 5% of the total annotated sequences in the dataset. Sixty-two (62) of the 64
well-characterized plant transcription factor (TF) gene families are represented in the cowpea
GSRs, and these families are of similar size and phylogenetic organization to those characterized in

other plants. The cowpea GSRs also provides a rich source of genes involved in photoperiodic
control, symbiosis, and defense-related responses. Comparisons to available databases revealed
that about 74% of cowpea ESTs and 70% of all legume ESTs were represented in the GSR dataset.
As approximately 12% of all GSRs contain an identifiable simple-sequence repeat, the dataset is a
powerful resource for the design of microsatellite markers.
Conclusion: The availability of extensive publicly available genomic data for cowpea, a non-model
legume with significant importance in the developing world, represents a significant step forward
in legume research. Not only does the gene space sequence enable the detailed analysis of gene
structure, gene family organization and phylogenetic relationships within cowpea, but it also
facilitates the characterization of syntenic relationships with other cultivated and model legumes,
and will contribute to determining patterns of chromosomal evolution in the Leguminosae. The
micro and macrosyntenic relationships detected between cowpea and other cultivated and model
legumes should simplify the identification of informative markers for marker-assisted trait selection
and map-based gene isolation necessary for cowpea improvement.

Background
Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata L. Walp., is both one of the
most important food and forage legumes in the semi-arid
tropics and a valuable and dependable commodity for
farmers and grain traders [1,2]. Of the ~21 million acres
grown worldwide, 80% of cowpea production takes place
in the dry savannah of tropical West and Central Africa,
mostly by poor subsistence farmers in developing countries [2,3]. Despite its economic and social importance in
the developing world, cowpea has received relatively little
attention from a research standpoint and remains to a
large extent an underexploited crop. Among the major
goals of cowpea breeding and improvement programs is
the stacking of desirable agronomic traits, such as those
governing abiotic stress (drought, salinity, and heat) tolerance, photoperiod sensitivity, plant growth type, and seed
quality with resistances to the numerous bacterial, fungal,
and viral diseases and insect, invertebrate (nematode),
and herbivorous pests [1,2]. Implementation of marker
assisted selection and breeding programs is severely limited by a paucity of trait-linked markers and a general lack
of information on gene structure and organization. Thus,
relatively large genetic gains can likely be made with only
modest investments in both applied plant breeding and
molecular genetics.
The Leguminosae (Fabaceae) family consists of 757 genera and over 20,000 species [4]. Diversification commenced soon after the first identifiable legumes appeared
in the fossil record ~56 million years ago (Mya), and all
living legumes are thought to share a common ancestor
that existed an estimated ~59 Mya [5]. The family is
divided into several major clades [6], with most of the
major crop and model species concentrated in the Papilionoideae clades "Halogalegina" (adapted to temperate
climates, such as Lotus and Medicago) and "phaseoloid/
millettioids" (warm-season species such as Glycine and
Phaseolus). Cowpea belongs to the latter clade, along with

the other major warm-season crops: common bean (P.
vulgaris), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and soybean (G.
max) [7]. The split between Glycine and Medicago is dated
at ~54 Mya and that between Glycine and Phaseolus at ~19
Mya [5,8].
The most significant progress in legume genomics has
been made for the small genome model species, M. truncatula and L. japonicus, and for soybean (G. max), economically the most important legume crop species [8-13].
Large Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) collections are available for all three of these species [14], along with near
complete genome sequences and well-developed genetic
and physical maps [12]. The availability of genomics level
information lags substantially in other legumes, although
some progress has been made in pea (P. sativum), common bean (P. vulgaris), alfalfa (M. sativa), and peanut
(Arachis hypogea) [7,15-18].
Little attention has been paid to gene characterization and
the development of resources in cowpea [2,19] despite the
fact that its genome size of 620 Mb is one of the smallest
among the legumes and is at the lower end of plant
genomes in general [20-22]. At the time of writing, fewer
than 1,000 cowpea ESTs have been deposited in public
databases [14] and most of the genomic DNA sequence
available relates to either rRNA coding and spacer regions
or represents anonymous sequence exploited for RFLP
mapping. Increasing our knowledge of the structure and
composition of the cowpea genome will help in the interpretation of genome evolution in this phaseoloid/millettoid clade and Papilionoideae in general, and will
undoubtedly contribute substantially to efforts aimed at
improvement of this crop.
While advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies make the prospects of whole genome sequencing possible, for most plant species the associated cost still

remains prohibitive because of their genome size and
complexity. Reduced-representation approaches, such as
methylation filtration (MF) and Cot-based cloning and
sequencing, have been developed to alleviate some of the
difficulties presented by the presence of ubiquitous repetitive DNA [23-27]. Both techniques rely on gene enrichment for the recovery of genic sequences. While Cot-based
selection separates low-copy from high copy sequence
based on differential annealing [28,29], MF targets the
hypomethylated fraction of the genome for cloning. The
use of MF as an enrichment technique has been successfully demonstrated in maize, sorghum, soybean and
tobacco [13,23,25,30-32]. Empirical comparisons suggest
that the relative efficacy of MF and Cot-based enrichment
the techniques is species dependent [25,26,33,34]. Here
we show how MF was successfully applied in cowpea for
the enrichment of gene-rich regions and report a detailed
analysis of the resulting recovered sequences.

sequence attempts, respectively (Table 1). The gene
enrichment or filter power (FP) obtained was determined
by comparison of the sequence reads from the UF and MF
library clones to a highly-curated Arabidopsis protein
database from which transposons and other repetitive elements had been removed [35]. Curation is an important
step because it allows for the accurate determination of
relative gene densities of the MF and UF sequence sets.
Match rates were calculated over a range of BLAST e values
(1e-5 to 1e-20) for the various MF and UF sequence reads
and the resulting FP achieved by MF was 3.9 to 4.3, with a
median value of 4.1 [see Additional file 1]. Given an estimated genome size of 620 Mb, a 4.1-fold enrichment predicts a hypomethylated, gene-rich space for cowpea of
151 Mb, about the size of the Arabidopsis genome. The
enrichment following MF observed in cowpea was similar
to the 3.2-fold enrichment observed in soybean (18) and
better than the 2.4-fold enrichment found in Phaseolus (A.
Budiman and J. Bedell, personal communication).

Results and discussion
Sequencing the gene-rich space of cowpea sampled by MF
In order to determine whether the application of methylation filtration (MF) technology could be used to enrich
for hypomethylated gene-rich DNA from cowpea, a pilot
study was carried out in which two whole genome shotgun libraries were generated from nuclear genomic DNA
isolated from the cowpea variety UCR-1115. One library
was made using the McrBC- strain of E. coli (the "unfiltered" (UF) library) and the other was made using the
McrBC+ strain (the "methylation filtered" (MF) library).
Nucleotide sequences were generated from one end of the
inserted DNA in randomly selected clones picked from
the UF and MF libraries, resulting in 1,152 and 864

Based on empirically derived results from the Orion Sorghum GeneThresherâ¢ project and a simulation conducted
on finished Arabidopsis sequence [35], we estimated that
in order to sequence tag some portion of ~95% of the
genes in the cowpea genome, it would be necessary to
generate ~252,000 MF sequence reads of an average read
length of ~600 nucleotides [36]. This number depends
heavily on the accuracy of the genome size estimate, and
the probability that all genes lie within the sampled
hypomethylated gene space. In the scaled-up version of
the project, MF libraries were prepared from DNA isolated
from the African cowpea cultivar IT97K-499-35 and
150,336 random clones were sequenced (147,744 inserts

the forward direction only, and 480 inserts in the reverse
direction only) (Table 2). In all, 298,848 MF gene-space
sequence reads (GSRs) were generated, of which 263,425
or 88.1% were classified as successful sequencing attempts
(i.e., were greater than 100 bp in length and at the time of
their initial annotation were believed not to be derived
from vector, microbial, fungal (yeast), viral or animal
genomic DNA). Chloroplast (9985), mitochondrial
(856), and transponson/retrotransposon-like (24,582)
DNA sequences identified by BLAST (= 1e-10) were also
removed. In total, the GSR dataset provided 160,696,129
nucleotides of raw sequence with the average length of a
successful GSR being 610 nucleotides [see Additional file
2]. All GSRs, including organellar genome-derived
sequences, as well as information on individual GSR
lengths and other statistical analyses are available for
interested individuals [36,37].
The 263,425 successful GSRs were clustered and assembled [38] into 52,149 GSR assemblies (contigs) and
70,679 singletons (Table 2). Relatively few singletons
were generated by the assembly process indicating that the
clustering of sequences was effective. The largest cluster
(CL1) contains 1557 contigs with 17,407 members and
the smallest cluster contains two GSRs. Clusters 2 through
30 contain from 354 to 57 component GSRs. Following
assembly, the GSR dataset represents a nuclear coverage of
~78 Mb, which is equivalent to 52% of the sampled gene
space and 12.7% of the total cowpea genome.

match DNA of extracellular (fungal, insect, bacterial or viral) and
organellar (mitochondrion and chloroplast) origin when compared to
available databases using blastx.

Gene annotation and gene ontology analysis
To assess the efficiency of gene discovery following MF,
the FASTA formatted cowpea GSRs were annotated and
analyzed by both BLAST and Hidden Markov Model
(HMM)-based algorithms [36]. The percentage of GSRs
containing BLAST-identifiable gene sequences present in
four public protein sequence databases and the proteomes of four completely or nearly completely
sequenced plant genomes (Arabidopsis, M. truncatula,
rice, and poplar) was determined. As shown in Table 3,
between 13% and 31% of the cowpea GSRs were annotated via the homology-based approach. Combining all of
the distinct annotated GSRs, approximately 36% (95,364/
263,425) of total cowpea GSRs could be assigned a putative function.

To determine the number of unique gene sequences represented in our dataset, BLAST comparisons to the NCBI
GenBank peptide database [39] performed using the
52,149 GRS assemblies and 70,679 singletons resulted in
the 41,260 annotated sequences. Of these annotated
sequences, 19,786 had distinct GenBank accession numbers. By comparison, 23,561 distinct GenBank accession
numbers were found by BLAST annotation of the 95,364
GSRs prior to assembly. Thus, the assembly process did
not enhance or significantly compromise the identification of putative gene coding sequences.
The goal of reduced representation sequencing strategies
such as MF is to capture as much gene complexity as possible without the laborious task of complete genome
sequencing. Most plant genomes are thought to encode
between 35,000 and 40,000 genes [22]. In legumes, gene
density is estimated to be 1 gene per 6â10 kb [12,17,4042]. With a gene space coverage of ~78 Mb captured by
MF, the estimated minimum number of genes potentially
tagged in our MF dataset should be between 7,800 and
13,000. In contrast to these predicted values, our annotation data clearly indicate that we tagged ~40,000 gene
coding regions, representing a minimum of 19,786 distinct GenBank accession numbers. This latter number is
also likely an underestimate, since we only included the
single lowest e-value score per sequence. Some of the
sequences matched multiple GenBank accession numbers
and the second or third ranked e-values could represent
additional coding regions on the same fragment.
To determine whether there was any bias in the enrichment for genes using MF, we made putative functional
assignments for the individual GSRs based upon the most
significant match obtained from database searches against
the Arabidopsis GO annotation categories. As shown in
Figure 1, the putative annotations were grouped into three
top-level ontologies: cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. Approximately 29%

(77,591/263,425) of the cowpea GSRs could be annotated in this way. Among those sequences that could be
assigned a functional classification, the largest categories
were catalytic activity and metabolic processes, groups
that include the majority of cellular enzymes and components of amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
Cellular binding activities (e.g., receptors) and gene products involved in cellular response to stimuli are among the
second group of gene products. Among the GSRs assigned
molecular function by GO annotation, 5,888 GSRs
(~11%) had homology to genes encoding transcription
factors (TFs) and transcription associated factors (TAFs).
This value is similar to what was found by direct annotation of the GSR assemblies, in which ~5% (1042/19,786)
of the total annotated sequences have this putative function assignment.
Comparisons to ESTs of cowpea and other legumes
To better estimate the quality of our gene discovery, we
compared the cowpea GSRs to available consensus ESTderived unigenes from cowpea and other legumes, including species closely and more distantly related (Table 4). In
our analysis, we used 16,954 unigenes assembled from
~42,000 ESTs derived from root and leaf/stem transcripts
of four different cowpea cultivars grown under both
drought-stressed and well-watered conditions (Sarah
Hearne, personal communication). Approximately 73.7%
of cowpea ESTs-derived unigenes were represented in the
GSR dataset as defined by blastn homology. Since the
cowpea ESTs and GSRs come from different cowpea cultivars, nucleotide sequences differences are expected and,
therefore, we also performed comparisons at the protein
level using tblastx. These comparisons indicated an ~90%
match rate. While the total number of ESTs available from
cowpea is admittedly low, the high hit rate is a strong indication that the GSRs provide a broad and robust coverage
of genic sequence.

BLAST comparisons (tblastx) of the consensus ESTsderived unigenes from other legumes and the GSRs
showed that 88.6% of the unigenes from P. vulgaris
matched cowpea sequences. This is not surprising since

common bean and cowpea and phylogenetically very
close. Not surprisingly, ESTs-derived unigenes from the
more distally related M. truncatula and L. japonicus only
had match rates with cowpea of 68.68% and 60.61%,
respectively. The mean percentage of match for cowpea
GSRs and available legume ESTs-derived unigenes was
~70%.
Mapping cowpea GSRs to M. truncatula pseudomolecules
Using tblastx searches, 42,988 GSRs (24,075 GSR assemblies and 18,913 singltons) could be mapped to the M.
truncatula chromosome-scale pseudomolecules available
on the TIGR M. truncatula database [43]. The cowpea
sequences are broadly distributed among the nine M.
truncatula pseudomolecules [see Additional file 3]. Several
examples of the mapping are shown in Figure 2. We were
able to find over 500 cases where GSR assemblies/singletons map to at least 2 adjacent IMGAG genes along the
pseudomolecules, indicating a significant level of
microsynteny. We also found examples where along a syntenic region, there appears to be a gene missing in either
cowpea or M. truncatula (Figure 2C). This could be due to
either a gene insertion/deletion in one of the species. It is
unlikely to be due to an annotation error in M. truncatula,
since tblastx would detect sequence similarity in this
region even if no gene model was predicted.
Analysis of transcription factor (TFs) families
Plants devote ~7% of their genome coding capacity to
proteins that regulate transcriptional activities [44-46].
Analysis of completed plant genome sequences suggests
that are upwards of 60 TF families present in most plant
genomes. In Arabidopsis [47,48] and P. trichocarpa
[49,50] the 64 TF families vary in size from 1â2 members
to over 100 members. Rice contains 63 of the dicot TF
families [51,52], missing only the SAP1 family represented by only a single gene in both Arabidopsis and P. trichocarpa. About 43 of the known TF families and ~25
potentially novel plant TFs and TAFs were identified in an
in silico analysis of the M. truncatula genome using the
Medicago Gene Annotation Group (IMGAG) dataset as
starting material [53]. Since ~5% of the cowpea GSRs

families relative to what is found in other plant species.
BLAST homology searches were carried out using conserved domains for the 64 TF families previously defined
in Arabidopsis [47,48] and tobacco [54]. One or more
gene coding sequence for 62 of the 64 TF families previously identified in vascular plants could be identified in
the cowpea GSR dataset, including sequences encoding
the SAP1 TF family. Among the low copy TF families
present in other plants, one member of each of the LFY,
NZZ, and ULT families, two members of the CCAAT-DR1
and Whirly gene families, and 3 members of the LUG and
VOZ gene families were present. Only the HRT-like and
S1Fa TF families were not represented among the cowpea
GSRs.
The ERF, WRKY, and CONSTANS (CO)/CONSTANS-like
(CO-like) gene families were chosen for a more detailed
analysis. These families are well characterized in other
plant species and encode proteins that regulate a variety of
plant developmental, stress, and growth responses. In Arabidopsis and P. trichocarpa, the ERF and WRKY families
are among the largest TF families present, and the CO-like
gene family has ~20 members. However, the most important criteria for selecting these TF families for analysis was
that the gene products contain short, well-conserved
DNA-binding domains that can be used to estimate diversity and phylogenetic relationships among family members, and to study gene family evolution [44,47,53,55].
Significant comparative information is available for the
CO-like family in legumes [56].
The ERF family
ERF transcription factors play important regulatory roles
in plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses,
sugar signaling, and determination of organ identity [5759]. BLAST searches of the GSR dataset were based on a

representative DNA binding domain from each of the ten
major ERF subgroups (I-X) [58] using low stringency (cut
off value = 10). The complete set of ERF domain-containing GSRs was assembled into contigs, each sequence was
manually verified and false positives removed. This
approach ensured that all possible gene family members,
including the most highly divergent ones, were isolated.
As a result, 111 ERF sequences were obtained, representing a minimum of 109 ERF genes. The minimum number
is lower than the total number because a small number of
sequences contain incomplete DNA-binding domains,
and therefore some ERF sequences may represent the 5'
and 3' ends of the same gene. The predicted minimum
number of ERF gene family members present in cowpea
(109) is similar to that predicted to be in the Arabidopsis
genome (122â124) [44,58].
The phylogenetic structure of the cowpea ERF gene family
(Figure 3) is similar to that of Arabidopsis. Two major
clades are recognized, the ERF and CBF/DREB subfamilies, consisting of the ten major subgroups. Subgroup
IX contains the largest number of genes and is divided
into two branches. The placement of Group V genes in
cowpea differs significantly from what is observed in Arabidopsis [44], with the cowpea Group V ERFs forming
separate branches in both the CBF/DREB and ERF clades.
This may be a more common feature of the ERF family,
since the Group V genes of tobacco also form separate
branches in both the CBF/DREB and ERF clades [54], and
in rice, some Group V genes cluster with Group XI [58].
The high degree of similarity in the phylogenetic arrangement of ERF genes between cowpea and Arabidopsis indicates that it should be possible to use such analyses to
identify potential targets for cowpea improvement. We
also constructed a phylogeny that contained the ERFs of
cowpea and those of other plant species whose biological
function has been reported (data not shown). Using this
type of analysis we were able to identify the closest cowpea homologues of CBF1, DREB1A, TINY, CaPBF1,

Figure 2of cowpea assemblies and singletons to the M. truncatula pseudomolecules
Mapping
Mapping of cowpea assemblies and singletons to the M. truncatula pseudomolecules. GSR assemblies and singltons
were mapped by tblastx searches to the M. truncatula chromosome-scale pseudomolecules available on the TIGR M. truncatula
database. The broad green lines represent tblastx alignments; narrow lines connect High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) derived
from the same cowpea sequence. An HSP consists of two sequence fragments of arbitrary but equal length whose alignment is
locally maximal and for which the alignment score meets or exceeds a threshold or cutoff score. A: An example of mapping
cowpea contigs and singletons to a 40 kb region of chromosome 0 (which represents BACs that have not been anchored to
the genetic map). B: A closer view of the same region from 396 k to 404 k. C: A region of M. truncatula chromosome 6 where
a single cowpea GSR spans and has high quality tblastx matches to three distinct IMGAG gene models, indicating microsynteny.
M. truncatula gene model AC134521_19 has no match in that region of the cowpea genome. D: A region of M. truncatula chromosome 2 where there are several GSR matches, but no M. truncatula gene model.

The WRKY TFs regulate responses to biotic and abiotic
stresses, senescence, germination, and a number of developmental processes [60-63]. Each WRKY transcription
factor contains at least one conserved ~60 amino acids

The ERF3gene family of cowpea transcription factors
The ERF gene family of cowpea transcription factors. GSRs encoding the conserved DNA binding domain of ERFs were
identified, the 111 cowpea ERF genes were arbitrarily assigned names, and the conserved domains were aligned using ClustalW. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was produced using the PHYLIP program based on the neighbor-joining method and presented using PhyloDraw. The cowpea ERF family is separated into two major clades.

region (the WRKY domain) with the peptide sequence
WRKYGQK at the N-terminus and a Zn-finger motif at its
C-terminus [64]. The ancestral-type WRKY TF (Group I)
contains two WRKY domains, one N-terminal and the
other, C-terminal. All other genes contain just one WRKY
domain and are classified into Groups IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, IIe
and III on the basis of their primary amino acid sequence
and structure of their Zn-finger motifs. A BLAST search of
the cowpea GSRs was performed with each of the WRKY
domains from the various subgroups and with both the
N-terminal and C-terminal domains from Group I. A total

of 79 contigs, containing at least part of a WRKY domain,
were obtained. Discovery of WRKY genes was technically
more difficult than the ERF genes because most WRKY
domains are interrupted by an intron separating the
WRKY and Zn-finger parts of the domain. The effect of this
intron was that frequently only the 5'- or 3'-end of the
WRKY domain was present in the assembled contigs. Nevertheless, it was possible to estimate the minimum
number (e.g., if all 5'- and 3'-ends were joined) and maximum number (e.g., if all 5'- and 3'-ends were not joined)
of WRKY genes present to be, 53 and 79, respectively.

These values are consistent with the prediction of 72
WRKY genes in Arabidopsis [44].
A phylogenetic tree of the cowpea WRKY TFs based on
their WRKY domain sequence, and including some key
Arabidopsis WRKY genes, was generated (Figure 4). This
revealed that the organization of the gene family in cowpea is similar to that in Arabidopsis, with the exception of
the Group IIb genes that appear to fall into two distinct

clades. This is likely an artifact caused by the presence of
some truncated WRKY domains in the analysis, because of
all the genes found in the cluster designated IIb*, only two
(VuWRKY13 and VuWRKY29) have full-length WRKY
domains.
Cowpea homologs of functionally characterized WRKY
genes could also be identified. These include VuWRKY44
and VuWRKY36, homologs of AtWRKY70, a TF that func-

tions at the intersection of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid
signaling during defense responses [65], VuWRKY35, a
homolog of AtWRKY6, whose product plays a role in regulating senescence [66], and VuWRKY27 and VuWRKY55,
homologs of TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA (TTG2/
AtWRKY44), which plays a key role in trichome and seed
coat development [67].
CONSTANS and the CONSTANS-like gene family
The timing of flowering is an important agronomic trait in
crop plants [68-71]. Many genes involved in photoperiod
responsiveness are functionally conserved in monocot
and dicot species [72,73]. As a result, it was possible for us
to identify GSRs encoding many members of various gene
families involved in light perception (e.g., PHY, CRY), as
well as GSRs encoding components of the signal transduction pathways connecting photoperiod and phytohormonal stimuli in the induction of flowering. For example, the
interaction between the products of the CONSTANS (CO)
and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes underlie long- and
short-day responsiveness [70-74]. CO encodes a TF that
plays a central role linking the circadian clock to genes
controlling meristem identity [73,75]. CO and members
of the CO-like gene family are defined by the presence of
two conserved domains, a Zn-finger domain that resembles a B-box domain near the N-terminus and a CCT
domain [75] near the C-terminus [76]. In Arabidopsis, the
CO-like gene family consists of three broad groups: Group
I which includes CO and factors with two Zn-finger Bboxes near the N-terminus, Group II with one B-box, and
Group III with one B-box and a second diverged Zn-finger.
There is a surprising amount of disagreement in the literature about the number of CO-like genes present in Arabidopsis, with values ranging from 17 [76] to between 33
â 51 genes [44,77], due to variation among researchers in
defining what constitutes a CO-like gene. Some researchers accept "CO-like genes" that only contain a CCT
domain and but not a B-box. Since CCT domains are
present in other TFs (e.g., ZIMs) and the B-box is a feature
absolutely required for CO function [73,75], in our analysis we only considered those genes that fit the stricter definition (i.e., CO and COL1-COL16). As a result, 23
cowpea CO-like genes were identified.

The cowpea CO-like gene family has several interesting
features. Two cowpea genes, VuCOL1 and VuCOL2, clustering together within Group I are clearly the closest
homologs of the Arabidopsis CO, COL1, and COL2 genes
(Figure 5). Their corresponding functional role is currently under investigation. The cowpea Group II and
Group III CO-like genes are similar in number to those in
Arabidopsis, whereas the Group IIIb, consisting of
VuCOL16 to VuCO25, has no counterpart. Two M. truncatula homologs of cowpea Group IIIb genes exist suggesting that perhaps this branch is legume specific. Four CO-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/103

like genes are known in monocots (two each from rice
and barley) that similarly contain only a single B-box
domain [76]. The functional role of these Group IIIb COlike genes in cowpea remains to be elucidated.
Vernalization acts to promote flowering by repressing the
expression of another floral regulator, the MADS-domain
protein termed FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis. Cereals appear to be missing FLC-like genes in
their genomes, with the corresponding role being carried
out by an unrelated Zn-finger TF [78]. FLC is also conspicuously absent in the legumes [53,56]. Consistent with this
previous observation, we were unable to identify a FLC
homolog in the MADS-domain TF family represented in
the cowpea GSRs (J. Opoku, P. Rushton, and M.P. Timko,
unpublished observations).
Genes controlling symbiosis and biotic stress responses
Legumes form mutually beneficial symbiotic associations
with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and bacteria collectively known as rhizobia that are of tremendous agricultural importance [79,80]. Establishing a fully
functional symbiosis requires the successful completion
of numerous steps, beginning with the recognition of
chemical signals exchanged between the plant and bacterial/fungal symbiont and culminating in the differentiation of functional symbiotic cells/tissues. The process is
the result of tightly regulated biochemical and molecular
interactions between the legume host and its symbiont
[81-86]. While the processes of nodulation and AM invasion have been extensively examined in other legume species, little experimental work has been done in cowpea.
We searched the GSRs for homologs of genes known to be
involved in nodulation and AM-legume symbiosis and
identified the following: NFR1/NFR5, receptor kinases
that perceive the bacterial derived signal in nodulation;
SYMRK, receptor-like kinases that integrate perception of
the signal and initiate symbiosis; NIN1 and members of
the NIN-like family of TFs; GRAS-domain family proteins,
such as NSP1 and NSP2; DMI1 and DMI3; putative plastidic ion channel protein components CASTOR and POLLUX; nucleoporin NUP133, required for the induction of
Ca2+ spiking in nodule development; nodulin (NOD)genes and genes encoding various nodule-specific proteins.

A large number of genes are involved in plant responses to
biotic stresses (e.g. bacteria, fungi, insects, nematodes,
and parasitic plants) [87]. Both resistance (R) genes and
genes encoding components of the signaling pathways
activated by the R genes in the defense response have been
extensively studied [88-90]. The largest class of R genes
encodes intracellular proteins containing a nucleotide
binding-site (NBS) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats
(LRR). The NBS family can be divided into multiple sub-

families based upon the presence or absence of other
domains, such as a Toll/interleukin receptor domain (TIR)
region, a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and a BED finger and/
or DUF 1544 domain [87,89]. Comparison of legume and
non-legume resistance gene homologs indicates that legume genes possess a unique evolutionary history, with
many clades either unique to legumes or expanded within
legumes [91]. Preliminary homology-based analysis of
the cowpea GSRs dataset using previously identified conserved NBS domains from cowpea R genes [92], and NBS
and LLR domains from R genes of other legume and nonlegume species, identified > 500 R genes and R gene candidates. A fuller analysis of the diversity and phylogenetic
relationships of these R genes is now underway.

analysis in crops [95,96]. A total of 30,877 GSRs (11.7%
of the total) contain at least one SSR. Of these, 3,717 have
been allocated a putative function through a BLASThomology based search. The SSRs vary in both repeat
composition and repeat length, with di- and tri-nucleotide motifs being the most prevalent. AT/TA repeats were
the commonest dinucleotide motif. Among the trinucleotide repeats, AT-rich groups (AAT > ATA > TAT > ATT)
predominated in the total GSR dataset, whereas ATA and
TTC were the most frequently occurring trinucleotide
repeats among the annotated GSRs. The nature and size
distributions of the cowpea SSRs 24 bp or greater is summarized in Table 5 and additional information can be
found at [37].

In addition to the R genes, many of the conserved signaling components of the disease resistance response pathways are present in the cowpea GSRs, including NDR1,
RPM1, COI1, EDS1, EDS5, PR5, SGT1, RPS5, and RIN4.
Consistent with previous reports in other plant species,
expression of these genes in cowpea has been shown to be
activated by treatment with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid,
or ethylene, and by wounding or by attack by the parasitic
angiosperm Striga gesnerioides [93,94].

Conclusion

Categories and distribution of simple sequence repeats
(SSRs)
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) provide the basis of the
most flexible and most widely exploited molecular
marker systems for marker assisted selection and genetic

Among the legumes, comparative genetic mapping established early on that linkage relationships were well conserved between closely related genera [97-102]. As more
sequence information has become available, the extent to
which both macro- and microsynteny relationships exist
has emerged. Despite significant differences in genome
size, a high level of macrosynteny exists between Medicago
and the Galegoids (such as alfalfa, pea, chickpea, and
Lotus), whereas less macrosynteny is observed between
Medicago and the Phaseolids (such as soybean and mungbean) [103-110]. The present work provides a firm foundation for detailed comparative studies of cowpea with
other warm season legumes, which apart from soybean
are as yet poorly represented. Many of the cowpea coding

regions were readily mapped to the M. truncatula pseudomolecules, allowing for future efforts aimed at the dissection and analysis of regions of macro- and microsynteny.
Such information, in combination with improvements of
the current cowpea genetic map [111] will facilitate positional cloning of key genes of agronomic interest.
The development of genomic scale information and its
use to conduct global transcriptomic, proteomic, and
metabolomic analyses is a major goal of the legume
research community [16,22]. Such analyses are already
well advanced in the model legumes [112-117]. The provision of extensive genomic data for cowpea, a non-model
legume with significant importance in the developing
world, represents a significant step forward in legume
research. Not only does the gene space sequence provided
here enable the detailed analysis of gene structure, gene
family organization and phylogenetic relationships
within cowpea, but it also facilitates the further characterization of syntenic relationships among cultivated and
model legumes. Ultimately these types of studies will contribute to determining patterns of chromosomal evolution in the Leguminosae. The determination of microand macrosyntenic relationships between cowpea and
other cultivated and model legumes should assist in the
identification of informative markers for use in markerassisted trait selection and map-based gene isolation. The
GSRs sequences we have generated also provide a resource
for future studies of gene expression within cowpea. The
development of oligonucleotide-based microarrays for
functional genomics analysis is currently underway in our
laboratory and this resource should soon be available for
the legume community. We hope that the information
and materials provided here will stimulate the broader
goal of the genetic improvement of cowpea, which is a priority for the alleviation of the burden of biotic and abiotic
stresses on subsistence farmers in developing parts of the
world.

Methods
Plant materials
Seeds of two cowpea cultivars were used in these studies.
Cultivar UCR-1115 (obtained from Dr. Jeff Ehlers,
Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of
California, Riverside, CA) was used in the pilot study and
IT97K-499-35 (obtained from Dr. Mohammad Ishiyaku,
Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria) was used in the
full scale gene space sequencing project. Seeds of both
genotypes are publicly available on request.
Genomic library construction and methylation filtering
Genomic DNA was purified from isolated nuclei of 1
month-old cowpea leaves [24] except that OptiPrepâ¢
(Axis-Shield PoC, Oslo, Norway) was used [35]. Purified
nuclear DNA was sheared using a Hydroshear apparatus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/103

(GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA, USA) and the sheared
fragments end-repaired using End itâ¢ kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). BstXI adaptors (Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA,
USA) were ligated to the end-repaired fragments, and the
ligation products were size separated by agarose gel elecrophoresis. DNA fragments ranging from 0.7 â 1.5 kb
were extracted from the gel and ligated to dephosphorylated, BstXI-digested pOT2 vector (from the Berkeley
Drosophila Genome Project, BDGP) for use in library
construction. Ligation reactions were transformed into
McrBC+ and McrBC- strains of Escherichia coli for generation of methylation filtered (MF, GeneThresherÂ® technology) and unfiltered (UF) libraries, respectively. The MF
and UF libraries were plated onto selective agar medium,
recombinant colonies were randomly picked using a
Genetix Q-bot robot (Research Genetics, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and the selected clones arrayed individually into
glycerol storage medium in 384-well microtiter plates for
archiving and storage at -80 C.
In a Pilot Study, clones were picked at random from the
MF and UF libraries, plasmid DNA isolated from each
clone, and sequenced from one end using an ABI 3730
(PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting
sequence data was analyzed as described below to estimate gene enrichment or filtering power. The purity of the
nuclear genomic DNA preparation was determined by
measuring two sources of DNA contamination: extracellular DNA (e.g., fungal, insect, bacterial or viral) and
organellar DNA (i.e., mitochondria and chloroplast) [35].
Library preparation and clone picking for the full-scale
genespace sequencing project was carried out as in the
Pilot Study. The quality and filtering capacity of each
library made from IT97K-499-35 was determined. A total
of 150,336 randomly selected recombinant clones were
picked from the MF libraries using a Genetix Q-bot robot
(Research Genetics, Carlsbad, CA, USA), arrayed and
stored individually in 384-well microtiter plates. One
sequence attempt was made from each end of the insert
fragment for each of the individual clones. A successful
sequence read met the following criteria: at least 100 contiguous bases of good quality, insert sequence following
vector and quality trimming performed using the trim_alt option of the Phred basecaller software program
[118] and was not derived from organellar (chloroplast
and mitochondrion), vector, transposon/retrotransposon, microbial, fungal (yeast), viral or animal genomic
DNA as determined by BLAST searches of relevant public
databases. A significant similarity score equal to or less
than 1e-10 was used.
Bioinformatic analyses
The gene enrichment or filter power (FP) was calculated
by comparing the rate of gene discovery between MF and

UF sequences and is based on the proportion of matches
of MF sequences compared UF sequences over a range of
e-values from 10e-5 to 10e-20, such that all matches better
than the given e-value are tabulated [see Additional file 1].
To ensure high quality, unique sampling events, reads
were chosen that contained at least 100 contiguous Phred
Q20 bases and only one read per clone was used. Detection of genes was accomplished by a blastx search (parameters: -e 0.01; -b 5; -v 5) of the curated Arabidopsis protein
database. Aside from the curation of the Arabidopsis database to remove repetitive elements, matches to proteins
annotated as hypothetical were not counted as hypothetical genes are often false gene predictions or unknown
repetitive elements. The Arabidopsis protein set, which
was used for the FP calculations and assessment of crossgenome annotation potential, is described elsewhere [35].
Raw sequence reads and vector-trimmed gene-space
sequence reads (GSRs) are stored in FASTA format on a
publicly available PostgrelSQL relational database [36].
The primary sequence dataset consists of 263,425 FASTA
formatted cowpea GSRs with an average length of 610 bp
(see Additional file 2). Sequence annotation and analysis
was performed using both BLAST and Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) based algorithms [36]. For homologybased annotation, each GSR was searched with blastx,
with cutoff expectation (e) value of 1e-8, against the UniProtKB-TrEMBL Database [119], UniprotKB-Swiss-Prot
Database [120], NCBI GenBank Proteins Database [121],
and UniProtKB-PIR (Protein Information Resource) Database [122] and the Arabidopsis, rice, Medicago, and poplar
protein datasets as described in [36].
Sequence assembly (clustering) was done with the TGI
clustering tool (TGICL) from Harvard University [38]
which uses megablast to group overlapping sequences
into clusters, then assembles the clusters using CAP3
[123]. Parameters used were a minimum overlap length of
30 bp with 94% sequence identity.
Analysis of gene ontology
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of GSRs were generated
by Arabidopsis refseq BLAST searches. Accession numbers
from the BLAST annotation were used to look up GO term
and name for each annotatable sequence. For each cowpea GSR that had a GO term, we tracked backwards by the
shortest path to an ancestor at the third level. We used the
GO MySQL database file go_20070204-seqdblitetables.tar.gz [124]. Although geneontology.org distributes
the GO SQL database in MySQL we prefer PostgreSQL.
Only the usual minor conversions were necessary to load
the GO data into PostgreSQL. The GO database includes
a number of related tables. SQL joins allow accession
numbers to be associated with GO terms. For the sake of
efficiency (to avoid repeating a SQL join on four tables)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/103

we created a new table assoc_term_seq to capture the
available associations between table's term, association,
gene_product, and seq. One additional query gave us the
term, and a second query gave us the closest level 3 ancestor for that term. A Perl script handled the database connections, the gathering of the cowpea refseq accession
numbers, iteration of the SQL queries over the cowpea
accession numbers, and the accumulation of counts into
the GO category terms.
EST comparisons and mapping of GSRs to M. truncatula
pseudomolecules
Computational comparisons were made between the
cowpea GSRs and available consensus ESTs (unigenes)
from other legumes available at the Legume Information
System (LIS) website [125]. Each legume EST was
searched against the total cowpea GSRs dataset using
tblastx with a cutoff value of 1e-8. We also compared the
cowpea GSRs to a dataset of 16,954 unigenes with an average size of 709 nucleotides (7894 assemblies with of average size 859 nucleotides; 9060 singletons of average size
578 bp) derived from 42,000 ESTs. The ESTs were generated from two different libraries (a root library and a leaf/
stem library) comprising material from four drought
stressed and non-stressed cowpea cultivars (Dan Ila, a
type II drought tolerant cultivar; Tvu11986, a type I
drought tolerant cultivar; Tvu7778, a drought susceptible
cultivar; and 12008D (Tvu9956), an advanced forage line
with good feed quality and reported drought tolerance.
The EST sequence data was kindly communicated to us by
Drs. Sarah Hearne and Richard Bishop (IITA and ILRI,
Nairobi, Kenya). A full description of the libraries and
their generation is in preparation (Hearne S, personal
communication). For this comparison both tblastx and
blastn was used.

To locate cowpea GSRs on the M. truncatula chromosomescale pseudomolecules [126] we employed tblastx with a
threshold of 1e-5 and Medicago truncatula Gbrowse Mtr
1.0 pseudomolecule release.
Identification of cowpea transcription factors and
phylogenetic analysis of TF gene families
Homology searches (tblastn) of the cowpea GSRs were
performed with the amino acid sequences of the DNA
binding domains from each of the ten major ERF subgroups [see Additional file 5 and Additional file 6], representative WRKY domains from Groups IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, IIe
and III and a N-terminal and C-terminal domain from
Group I [see Additional file 7 and additional file 8], and
the complete sequences of the At CO, COL6 and COL9
genes [see Additional file 9]. For each TF family, the GSRs
recovered were assembled into contigs using a local webbased implementation of the Phrap program [36]. Each
contig was then individually analyzed by blastx searches

Page 15 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:103

against the non-redundant protein database [120].
Sequences not containing the targeted TF domain under
analysis were discarded. The minimum number of genes
for each family was calculated based on the number of
unique 5', 3', full-length and partial conserved domains
present. Alignments of the predicted amino acid
sequences of the conserved domains were carried out
using ClustalW [127]-following removal of any intronic
sequences. Phylogenetic trees were produced using the
PHYLIP program using calculations based around the
neighbor-joining method and are presented using PhyloDraw [128].
Identification of simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
The presence of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in each of
the 263,425 cowpea GSRs was determined using the Tandem Repeats Finder program [129]. GSRs containing SSRs
along with information on repeat size, composition and
the primers for their amplification were parsed and
loaded into relational tables for sorting, search, and joining [37].
