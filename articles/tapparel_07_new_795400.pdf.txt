Abstract
Background: Human rhinoviruses (HRV), the most frequent cause of respiratory infections,
include 99 different serotypes segregating into two species, A and B. Rhinoviruses share extensive
genomic sequence similarity with enteroviruses and both are part of the picornavirus family.
Nevertheless they differ significantly at the phenotypic level. The lack of HRV full-length genome
sequences and the absence of analysis comparing picornaviruses at the whole genome level limit
our knowledge of the genomic features supporting these differences.
Results: Here we report complete genome sequences of 12 HRV-A and HRV-B serotypes, more
than doubling the current number of available HRV sequences. The whole-genome maximumlikelihood phylogenetic analysis suggests that HRV-B and human enteroviruses (HEV) diverged
from the last common ancestor after their separation from HRV-A. On the other hand, compared
to HEV, HRV-B are more related to HRV-A in the capsid and 3B-C regions. We also identified the
presence of a 2C cis-acting replication element (cre) in HRV-B that is not present in HRV-A, and
that had been previously characterized only in HEV. In contrast to HEV viruses, HRV-A and HRVB share also markedly lower GC content along the whole genome length.
Conclusion: Our findings provide basis to speculate about both the biological similarities and the
differences (e.g. tissue tropism, temperature adaptation or acid lability) of these three groups of
viruses.

Background
Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most frequent cause of
infection across all age groups of the population [1]. Replication is often restricted to the upper respiratory tract

leading to self-limited illnesses such as the common cold.
However, HRV infections can also exacerbate pre-existing
airway disorders, invade the lower respiratory tract and
lead to serious complications [2,3].

HRVs are single positive-stranded RNA viruses of approximately 7200 base pairs. They belong to the Picornaviridae
family and are closely related to HEVs, another genus of
the same family. The genome organization of Picornaviridae is conserved among the family with a long 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF)
encoding a polyprotein, a short 3'UTR, and a poly(A) tail
[4]. The 5'-terminal UMP of the viral RNA is covalently
linked to the small viral protein VPg [5]. The 5'UTR contains two structural elements [6]. One is the 5'-cloverleaf
structure involved in the plus-strand RNA synthesis and in
the process of switching from translation to replication
[7,8]. The other is the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)
which promotes translation of the polyprotein. The 3'UTR is necessary for efficient RNA replication, but the
exact mechanism is still not well understood [9,10]. In
addition, species-specific internal cis-acting replication
elements (cre) have been identified in HEV [11,12], HRVA [13] and HRV-B [14,15].
HRV strains have been classified into 99 serotypes [16]
based on the ability of a given serum to neutralize virus
growth of a given strain in cell culture, although several
serotypes share significant antigenic cross-reactivity [17].
According to nucleotide sequence relatedness of some
serotypes [18-21] and to sequence comparison of all serotypes in the VP1 [16,22] and VP4-VP2 capsid protein-coding regions [23], the 99 serotypes segregate in two
different groups: 74 belong to the HRV-A species and 25
to the HRV-B species. In addition to the division of HRVs
into two species, they have also been classified into major
and minor groups according to receptor usage. The major
group ofHRVs (composed of 65 serotypes of species A and
25 serotypes of species B) binds ICAM1, whereas the
minor group viruses (9 serotypes of species A) bind preferentially to LDL receptors [24-27]. The existence of multiple serotypes within each of these two lineages and
different receptor usage support the hypothesis of significant differences at the protein level. Surprisingly, despite
the fact that HRVs are the major cause of human respiratory infections, little is known about their genome variability at the full-length scale. To the best of our
knowledge, part of the VP4-VP2 [23] and VP1-2A
[16,22,28] regions have been sequenced for all serotypes
and half of them for the 3D regions [19], but full-length
sequences of only 8 serotypes are publicly available in the
Picornaviridae database [29] (7 HRV-A and 1 HRV-B) [3037]. While the present manuscript was in the process to be
accepted, Kistler and coworkers published additional
HRV-A and HRV-B full-length sequences increasing significantly the number of sequences available [38].
Among the Picornaviridae, HEVsare the closest relatives of
HRVs and, as for HRVs, humans are the only known reservoir. Phylogenetic analyses of VP1-2A HRV and HEV

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/224

sequences suggest thatHRVs and HEVs could be considered members of the same genus [28]. In addition, HRV87 presents a high sequence similarity to HEVs and was
recently reclassified as EV-68 [18,23,39,40]. Yet, the exact
relation between HEV and HRV remains ambiguous without full-length genome comparison. At the phenotype
level, however, HRV and HEV are clearly distinct: in vitro,
cell tropism, pH tolerance and optimal growth temperature are significantly different; in vivo, the site of infection,
organ tropism and the ability to disseminate are wellestablished characteristics that differentiate HEVs from
HRVs. HRVs infections are restricted to the respiratory
tract (temperature of 33°C), whereas most HEVs have the
ability to replicate predominantly in the gastrointestinal
tract (37°C). A large proportion can also disseminate,
causing viremia and potentially invading the central nervous system [41]. Full-length genome comparison of these
two genera helped us to identify genomic features and
divergences at the amino acid level that might explain
some biological differences.
We have sequenced 12 full-length genomes of different
HRV serotypes and we present here the comparative analysis of 20 prototype HRV strains (13 HRV-A and 7 HRV-B)
and 14 publicly available HEV strains that identifies the
key elements differentiating these medically important
viruses.

Results
The 12 newly sequencedHRV genomes have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank accession EF173414–
EF173425]. They vary in sequence length from 7124
nucleotides (HRV-12) to 7219 nucleotides (HRV-17)
which is similar to the length range of previously
sequenced genomes (from 7102 to 7208 nucleotides).
The average size ofHRVs type A (7131 nt) is smaller than
the average size of HRVs type B (7215 nt), whereas the
average size of 14 HEVs analysed in this study is 7417.
HRV-B is more closely related to HEV than to HRV-A
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogeny of HRV-A, HRV-B and HEV was reconstructed by using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
method for the full polyproteins (Figure 1), as well as for
each individual protein, using Simian picornavirus (SV-2)
as the outgroup. The whole-polyprotein phlyogenetic
analysis suggests the hypothesis that HRV-B and HEV lineages radiated from a common ancestor after its separation from HRV-A (Figure 1), where the percentage of
bootstrap support of each grouping reflects the statistical
confidence. Yet, when the analysis is conducted at the
level of each individual protein, the subsequent reconstructed tree topology does not always support the same
conclusion (Figures 2B-D and additional file 1). In the
region of VP2, VP3, 3B and 3C proteins, the analysis sup-

ports the alternative hypothesis that HRV-B and HRV-A
radiated from a common ancestor after separation from
HEV. In the region of VP4, VP1 and 3A proteins, the analysis cannot discriminate the phylogenetic relationships
between these three virus groups. The bootscanning
experiment (see Methods) presented in Figure 2D is consistent with all the above-mentioned findings and also
supports the hypothesis that in some parts of the capsid
HRV-A and HRV-B share the last ancestor after their separation from HEV.

Protein product similarity
For each individual protein cleavage product, we also
quantified pair-wise sequence identities among the HRVA, HRV-B, and HEV genomes under consideration. Figure
2(A-B-C) shows the arrangement of these proteins along
the picornavirus genomes and the corresponding protein
identity matrices. Over all these three picornavirus (HRVA, B and HEV), VP1 is the least conserved protein (48.5 %
amino-acid identity) and VP4 the most conserved
(66,6%). Globally, these comparisons are consistent with
the phylogenetic analysis and confirm that the 2A, 2B, 2C,
and 3D percentage of sequence similarities are higher
between HRV-B and HEV than between HRV-A and B (see
additional files 1 and 2). In contrast, at the level of VP1,
VP2, VP3, 3B and 3C sequences, HRV-A and HRV-B have
a higher percentage of homologies compared to HEV (see
additional files 1 and 2).

Between the HRV-A and HRV-B groups, VP2 shows the
highest overall conservation (> 60%) and 2A protein
exhibits the lowest (< 40%). Within each of the species
(HRV-A or HRV-B), the VP1 protein appears as the least
conserved (< 80% of averaged amino-acid identity) and
VP4 as the most conserved (> 96%) (see additional file 2).
Protein 3B also shows poor conservation among HRV-B
serotypes, but this may be an artefact due to its small size.

sequence of simian picornavirus 1 (SV-2) was used as an outgroup. The branch lengths are measured in substitutions per

RNA structural elements
5'- and 3'- UTRs
Analysis of the 5'UTR of HRV-A, HRV-B and HEV shows
that the well known 5' cloverleaf cre element as well as the
IRES structure are highly conserved throughout the three
groups (see additional file 3). The cloverleaf structure was
originally discovered in polioviruses [42]. This secondary
structure is deposited in the Rfam database (a collection
of multiple sequence alignments covering many common
non-coding RNA families and conserved RNA secondary
structures [43]) under the accession number [RF00386].
The corresponding consensus structure of HRV-A, HRV-B
and HEV, which was recovered without prior knowledge
of it by comparative sequence analysis (see additional file
3A) matches well this Rfam consensus structure. In the
same line, the IRES structure for HRV-A, HRV-B and HEVs
is also very similar to the Rfam Picornaviridae consensus
structure [RF00229] [44], except for the presence of two
additional small helices (see additional file 3B).

The picornavirus 3'-UTR encodes astem-loop structure
that may play a role in replication efficiency (through
interaction with the 5'UTR) as well as in polyadenylation
of genomic RNA [9,45,46]. In contrast to the 5'UTR structures, the 3'UTRs structures (see additional file 4)are not
universally conserved in sequence and position among
the three groups studied. The length of the 3' UTR
between the groups varies between 47 nt (HRV-A), 50 nt

the log likelihood of the tree at each position which is a measure of overall confidence in the tree. Darker colour indicates
higher confidence.

(HRV-B) and 83 nt (HEV). Furthermore, both HRV-A and
HRV-B contain a stable stem-loop structure of 35 nt at the
3' end of the 3'UTR. HEV also contains a 42 nt stem-loop
which is located closer to the middle of the 3'UTR. Nevertheless, there is a large amount of sequence variability
within this whole group which leads to a less stable consensus stem-loop for all the analyzed HEV sequences.
In addition, there is a conserved stem-loop structure in
HRV-A located close to the 3'UTR, yet the corresponding
region in HRV-B and HEV suggest different structures, and
the overall high sequence conservation in the region
could give a misleading signal of structural conservation
(see additional file 5).
Internal cis-acting elements
Besides the 5' and 3'UTR, disparate internal cre elements
have been previously described among various rhinoviral

serotypes of both HRV-A and HRV-B [15], and have been
identified by our comparative analysis.
HRV-A cre
The HRV-2 2A internal cre motif [Rfam RF00220] [13] is
conserved among all HRV-A genomes analysed in this
study, but has not been identified in any HRV-B or HEV
viruses (see additional file 6A). The same region of HRVB also folds into a conserved secondary structure that
seems specific to this group (data not shown).
HRV-B cre
Similarly, the internal cre motif reported for the HRV-14
VP1, a member of HRV-B, is present in all 7 HRV-B serotypes and is notably absent in all HRV-A and HEV analyzed (see additional file 6B).

Furthermore, the availability of new HRV-B sequences
allowed us to identify another conserved cre motif within

the HRV-B 2C coding sequence (Figure 3) that has the typical R1NNNAAR2NNNNNNR3 cre motif [47-51] in all
HRV-B serotypes analysed (the 7 full genomes plus 17
partial sequences), with the exception of HRV-27 that has
a U instead of an R at position R1. More importantly, the
newly identified HRV-B 2C cre corresponds to the HEV 2C
cre, previously identified in several HEVs [11,12].
GC content
The GC composition is an important genomic factor that
can be evolutionary optimized for adaptation to multiple
environmental constraints (such as ideal growth temperature). The GC content varies substantially between the
groups of HEV, HRV-A and HRV-B (Figure 4), where HRVB exhibits lowest values, HEV exhibits the highest values,
and HRV-B is intermediate. This holds not only globally,
but also locally, for each of the sliding windows along the
whole genomes. These trends are statistically significant as
the two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the hypothesis that GC contents of HRV-A, HRV-B and HEV can be
drawn from the same underlying distribution: HRV-A vs.
HRV-B p-value < 10-15; HRV-A vs. HEV p-value < 10-15;
HRV-B vs. HEV p-value < 10-15.

Discussion
HRVs were first classified into two groups based on a differential sensitivity to a variety of antiviral compounds
targeting VP1 [52]. The members of the HRV-A group
were susceptible to most of these antiviral compounds,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/224

whereas the HRV-B were not. This classification was then
confirmed by nucleotide sequence relatedness in the VP1
[16,22] and VP4-VP2 capsid protein-coding regions of all
serotypes [23]. Analysis of other regions like the 3C protease has been restricted to a limited number of serotypes
[18,20,21]. Whole genome comparisons have not been
conducted since only one full-length HRV-B genome
(HRV-14) as well as a limited number of HRV-A genomes
were available. Complete sequencing and analysis of
additional HRV-B and HRV-A genomes allowed us to
describe their phylogeny and the similarity of individual
proteins between the two HRV groups and HEV. For
example, proteins such as 2A show a particularly pronounced difference in inter- versus intra-group conservation. Conversely, surface proteins such as VP2 (capsid) are
better conserved across all groups.
It appears that HRV-B share a common ancestor with HEV
as shown by the whole-genome phylogenetic analysis,
which suggests that Rhinovirus is not monophyletic. This
observation is reinforced by the identification of a new
HRV-B 2C cre that is lacking in all HRV-A genomes studied. This cre consists of a hairpin structure with a conserved R1NNNAAR2NNNNNNR3 motif in the loop [4751] and was previously only known in HEV 2C gene. The
first two As in this motif serve as the template for the VPg
uridylylation reaction by the viral polymerase. Uridylylated VPg then serves as a primer for RNA synthesis [5].
Although the question is still open to debate, it has been
suggested that the polyA tail may serve as template for VPg
uridylylation and synthesis of the minus strand RNA,
whereas internal cre are necessary for plus strand synthesis
[53,54]. HRV-14 VP1 cre, as well as HRV-2 2A cre, were
shown to be functionally equivalent to poliovirus RNA 2C
cre in in vitro uridylylation assays with poliovirus VPg and
polymerase [11-13,49]. Further studies are underway to
define whether the HRV-B 2C cre identified in this study
plays a role in VPg uridylylation or can be considered as
an evolutionary leftover of HEV 2C cre. Concerning the
replacement of an R position by a U in HRV-27 cre, it
should be noted that the effect of a similar substitution on
replication efficiency could not be studied for HRV-14 2C
cre since it results in the introduction of a stop codon [4751]. However, for Coxsackiesvirus B3 2C cre, a substitution at the R3 position by a U was shown permissive for
replication [53,54].
Besides this putative new cre element in the 2C region of
HRV-B, we could also identify the already known elements (cloverleaf structure and IRES in 5' as well as the
stem-loop element in 3') in the 5' and 3' UTRs from all
studied genomes. The cloverleaf structure and the IRES are
highly conserved. Interestingly, we identified many compensatory mutations in the sequences of these structures,
which points out that the selective pressure is "working"

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:224

on the structural level. The functionality of these elements
is therefore more determined by their structure than by
their primary sequence.
The observation that HRV-B and HEVs are more closely
related to each other than either is to HRV-A seems paradoxical, given that HRVs differentiate themselves from
most HEVs at the phenotypic level. This could be
explained by recombination events that would have taken
place soon after the divergence of HEV and HRV-A and
during which regions were exchanged between HRV-A
and the HEV ancestor of HRV-B. The protein identity plots
and the bootscanning suggest that the recombining region
may have included the capsid region. This is consistent
with the fact that recombination breakpoints have been
found to be largely restricted to nonstructural regions of
the genome, mostly in the 2A-2C parts, and between the
5' UTR and the capsid-encoding region [55-57]. Recombination has been extensively documented as a driving force
for the evolution of some Picornaviridae [58], although
only hypothesized forHRVs [19]. Interspecies in vivo
recombination was also suspected for HEVs [59]. Our
hypothesis is that early recombination events may have
occurred between HRV and HEV. Although these two
virus species have often different tropism in vivo, both can
easily infect the respiratory tract, an event that could provide opportunities for recombination.
Since VP1 is responsible for recognizing the receptor on
the host cell surface, the hypothesis of capsid sequence
transfer from HRV-A to HEV to yield HRV-B could explain
a tissue tropism and a disease pattern similar to that of
HRV-A rather than HEV. In addition, the similar GC content observed between HRV-B and HRV-A may account for
some of these phenotypic differences. The relatively lower
GC content of HRV-B may reflect an adaptation to the
environment of the upper respiratory tract, whereas the
higher GC content of HEVs might reflect convergent adaptation to the gastrointestinal tract of the central nervous
system environment (such as higher temperature, acidity,
etc.).

Conclusion
The analysis of new HRV full-length genomes statistically
supports (> 90% bootsrap confidence) the current classification of HRV into two distinct species. HRV-B seems to
be phylogenetycally more closely related to HEV, another
important member of the Picornaviridae family, than it is
to HRV-A. However, our observations suggest that this
species classification accurately reflects the capsid type,
but not all parts of the genome. We have shown that HRVA and HRV-B differ significantly at the protein level and in
the composition and structure of their cis-acting
sequences. One of the evolutionary scenarios that would
explain the differential grouping of HRV-B with HEVs or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/224

with HRV-A along the genome is that of an ancient recombination between HRV-A and HEV lineages, given that the
HRV-B closer relation with HEVs is overall more statistically sound. However, without additional data, this
remains only a hypothesis. The genomic features highlighted in our study help to contribute to our understanding of why these viruses maintain different phenotypic
variations in humans, thereby enabling a more accurate
analysis of their relationship.

Methods
Viruses
The prototype strains of 12 HRV serotypes (HRV-3, 17, 27,
37, 52, 93, 11, 12, 24, 78, 64 and 94) were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Promochem,
Molsheim, France) and the RNA was eitherextracted
directly from ATCC stocks (HRV-17, HRV-52, HRV-64 and
HRV-94) orthe stocks were first amplified by one (HRV11, HRV-12, HRV-24 and HRV-78), two (HRV-27) or
three (HRV-3, HRV-37 and HRV-93) passages in HeLa
Ohio cell lines (kindly provided by Prof FG Hayden, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA). These serotypes were chosen tobe well scattered on the trees
performed previously with HRV VP1 and VP4-VP2 subregions [16,22,23] and to complete sequence analysis of
clinical isolates studied in the laboratory [2].

The full-length genome sequences of the 8 additional
HRV serotypes (HRV-1B [GenBank:D00239], 2 [GenBank: X02316], 14 [GenBank:X01087], 16 [GenBank:
39
[GenBank:AY751783],
89
[GenL24917],
Bank:M16248], 85 and 9 whose sequences were directly
downloaded from the Picornaviridae sequence database
[29]), as well as the sequences of the 14 HEV serotypes
and the simian picornavirus (SV-2) outgroup [GenBank:AY064708] analyzed in this study, were obtained
from GenBand at the NCBI. The 14 HEV sequences
include the two members of the HEV-D subspecies: EV-68
[GenBank: EF107098] and EV-70 [GenBank:DQ201177],
the three members of the poliovirus subspecies: PV-1
[GenBank:V01148], PV-2 [GenBank:X00595] and PV-3
[GenBank: X00925] as well as three representatives of the
HEV-A, B and C subspecies randomly chosen: Coxsackie
CV-A6
[Gen(CV)-A2
[GenBank:AY421760],
Bank:AY421764]and CV-A14 for HEV-A [GenBank:AY421769]; Echovirus (E)-1 [GenBank:AF029859],
and
CV-B2
[GenE-6
[GenBank:AY302558]
HEV-B;
and
CV-A1
[GenBank:AF081485]for
Bank:AF499635], CV-A17 [GenBank:AF499639] and CVA18 [GenBank:AF499640] for HEV-C. A list of all viruses
with their corresponding GenBank accession numbers can
be found in the additional file 8 in the supplementary
material.

Sequencing
Complete genome sequences were determined for each of
the 12 above-mentioned strains. Reverse transcription
(Superscipt II, Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) was performed with random hexamers on TRIzol- extracted (Invitrogen) RNA [60]. Overlapping fragments representing
each complete viral genome were then amplified by PCR
using degenerate primers designed to anneal highly conserved sequences among HRVs. Specific, non-degenerate
primers were then designed to fill the gaps between the
original PCR products. All primers used in this study are
listed in the additional files (see additional file 7). The 5'
and 3'ends were obtained with the 5'/3' RACE Kit (Roche
Applied Science, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). PCR products
were purified with the microcon columns (Millipore, Zug,
Switzerland) before sequencing. Each PCR product was
sequenced at least twice. Chromatograms produced with
the ABI Prism 3130XL DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, PE Europe BV, Basel, Switzerland) were directly
imported for proofreading with the vector NTI Advance
10 program (Invitrogen).
Multiple sequence alignment
Open reading frames (ORFs) were extracted from the
whole-genome nucleotide sequences of each virus species
using the getorf programme from the EMBOSS package
[61], using a minimal ORF length of 6000 nt to ensure
that small, spurious ORFs were not reported. The multiple
alignment of encoded polyprotein was produced with the
extracted ORFs using MUSCLE [62] with default parameters. The alignments for each of the protein products were
extracted from the full multiple alignment. The wholegenome nucleotide level alignment was assembled using
T-Coffee [63] from 3 separate alignments: 5'-UTR and 3'UTR aligned with MUSCLE (default parameters), and the
amino acid level multiple alignment of the ORFs projected to the nucleotide level using the TRANALIGN programme from the EMBOSS package with default
parameters. The alignments are available from [64].
Phylogenetic analysis
The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed using PhyML [65] with estimated proportion of
variable sites, estimated Gamma distribution parameters
and 16 substitution rate categories. Protein-level trees
were made using the JTT [66] molecular evolution model,
and nucleotide-level trees were made using the GTR
model with empirical base frequency estimates. The consensus trees were reconstructed from bootstrap trees using
PHYML or Tree-Puzzle [67] with the same parameters.
Protein identity plots
All-against-all protein product identity scores were produced using the Belvu programme [68], and reformatted
into symmetrical square arrays of sequence identity per-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/224

centage values (one for each cleavage product) represented as greyscale bitmaps in Figures 2B and 2C.
Bootscanning
A polyprotein multiple alignment was constructed (as
described above) with 14 HEV sequences, 13 HRV-A
sequences, 7 HRV-B sequences, and 1 SV-2 sequence. This
alignment was subjected to bootscanning (as described in
[69]) with a window size of 200 aa and a step of 50 aa. For
each window, a maximum-likelihood tree with 100 bootstraps was computed as described above. HRV-A formed a
single clade in all trees, HRV-B in all but one. HEV formed
a single clade in many, but not all trees. The tree's topology was categorized as follows: i) the smallest clade that
contained all rhinoviruses and at least one enterovirus
was determined; ii) this clade was categorized as "HRV-B
closest to HRV-A", "HRV-B closest to HEV", or "undecided" according to which clade was the sister clade of all
HRV-B, iii) the bootstrap value of the clade determined in
(i) was used as a measure of support of the topology.
Finally, the log-likelihood of each tree was also recorded.
For each window, this yielded: i) an indication of the
most likely topology (with possibility of undecidedness);
ii) a measure of support of this topology; and iii) a measure of confidence in the whole tree.
GC content
We extracted sub-alignments for HEV, HRV-A, and HRV-B
from the above-described nucleotide-level, wholegenome alignment of 14 HEV, 13 HRV-A, 7 HRV-B
sequences. This allows direct comparison of the GC content at the orthologous positions using a sliding window
of 600 nt along the alignment, computing GC percentage
over all sequences within the window, and with a step of
10 nt. The resulting set of three measures of local GC percentage content, one each for HEV, HRV-A, and HRV-B
were plotted.
Identification of conserved RNA structural elements
The complete genome alignment of all 34 genomes spanning 7852 positions (5'UTR+ORF+3'UTR) was scanned
for thermodynamically stable and structurally conserved
RNA structures using RNAz [70] The structures were evaluated using a sliding window of 120 bp with 40 bp steps
over the whole alignment, as well as separately for each of
the three groups (HRV-A, HRV-B, HEV). To identify
shorter secondary structure elements, the same procedure
was performed using a window of 60 bp in steps of 20 bp.
The consensus RNA structures of the selected alignment
regions were folded using RNAalifold from the Vienna
Package [71] with the least stringent option for consensus
folding. These alignment regions were manually elongated and corrected in order to capture the whole RNA
secondary structure. Furthermore, all alignment columns
with more than 75% gaps were removed from the RNAal-

ifold consensus folding procedure, since gaps are not
excluded for the folding energies evaluation. The resulting
structures as well as the alignments were color-coded
according to the amount of consistent, compensatory and
inconsistent base changes at a certain alignment and
structure position using Vienna RNA Utilities [72].
