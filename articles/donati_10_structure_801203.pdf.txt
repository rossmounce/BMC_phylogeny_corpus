Abstract
Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. The
genomes of 44 diverse strains of S. pneumoniae were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic
streptococci of the Mitis group.
Results: Despite evidence of extensive recombination, the S. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major
lineages. With the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of
isolation and disease outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes - genes present in more than one strain but
not in all strains - was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this
correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was the
dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic exchange occurred both within and
across the borders of the species, and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of S. pneumoniae. The
pan-genome size of S. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the
number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate
proportionately to the age of clones. Most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all S. pneumoniae
strains, but were also present in S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to
determine virulence.
Conclusions: Genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of
evolution of S. pneumoniae. The open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to
diverse environments.

Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major causative agent of
human diseases, which include chronic otitis media,
sinusitis, pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. While
other pathogenic streptococci can be easily identified
both phenotypically and through molecular phylogenetic
analysis, S. pneumoniae is very similar to commensal
species of the Mitis group, in particular Streptococcus
mitis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus infantis [1].

Most strains of these species can take up DNA from the
environment and recombine sequences into their chromosome [2], resulting in both substitution of DNA fragments
by homologous sequences from other clones and acquisition of novel genes from donor organisms, a process
termed horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Due to the
dynamic effects on genome content and organization
resulting from HGT, it has been argued that the evolution
of individual strains is substantially shaped by recombination-dependent novel acquisitions of DNA, commensurate
with the genetic diversity of the species. The repertoire of
genetic sequences of named species, such as S. pneumoniae, has been termed the pan-genome [3,4]. The maintenance of these HGT systems is particularly striking when

viewed from a genomic perspective. Commensal and
pathogenic bacteria that are exclusively adapted to a
restricted range of hosts maintain relatively small genome
sizes, in the range of 1.5 to 3 megabases, when compared
to free-living environmental species. The reduction in genome size, reflecting evolutionary constraints on the retention and build up of nonessential genes, occurs despite the
conservation of multiple operons that support HGT. It has
been proposed that the ability of some bacterial commensal pathogens to generate diversity through HGT provides
a selective advantage to these microbes in their adaptation
to host econiches and evasion of immune responses [5,6].
Isolates of S. pneumoniae are traditionally characterized in terms of the chemical composition of their polysaccharide capsules, of which there are more than 90
serotypes. Different serotypes display different pathogenic
potential and geographic distribution [7,8]. However,
genomic variability among strains of S. pneumoniae is
more accurately inferred from a comparison of allelic
profiles of housekeeping genes [9], multi-locus sequence
typing (MLST) [10], than by capsular serotyping [2,4].
This assertion has been strengthened by analyzing the
distributions of the pilus-encoding rlrA and PI-2 islets in
large collections of strains [11,12]. Although frequent
recombination violates the paradigm of strict clonal
inheritance, recently evolved clones maintain a high level
of genomic similarity. This raises the question as to the
extent of the distribution of dispensable genes, how these
might be understood in terms of a clonal population
structure and which genes, or classes of genes, violate
this structure.
Most of these aspects of molecular evolution, traditionally addressed by population genetics methods, can be
more advantageously studied by comparing whole genome sequences [3,13,14]. There are several complete genome sequences of individual strains of S. pneumoniae
[15-20] and a comparative analysis of 17 complete and
draft sequences predicted that the complement of genes
that can be found in the genome of S. pneumoniae comprises more than 5,000 families of orthologs [4]. Here we
report the genomic variability in 44 strains (24 newly
sequenced and 20 already present in public databases) of
S. pneumoniae in comparison with four newly sequenced
genomes of S. mitis and one newly sequenced genome
each of S. oralis and S. infantis. This genome scale study
uses the most complete sampling of the diversity of the
S. pneumoniae species to date, including the first analysis
of multiple strains of the same serotype or MLST clonal
complex (CC), to investigate the evolutionary processes
that lead to the divergence of S. pneumoniae from other
related commensal species.
Our analysis is divided in two parts. In the first section, we present data on the genomic variability of

Page 2 of 19

S. pneumoniae in the context of previous studies on the
population structure of this species. In the second section we focus on genome dynamics, extending the analysis to the non-pathogenic streptococcal strains, and
discuss possible evolutionary implications.

Results and Discussion
Genomic variability of S. pneumoniae
An average of 74% of any individual genome is shared by
all strains

We aligned the genome sequences of 44 S. pneumoniae
strains, 14 complete and 30 draft (Additional file 1). The
collection spanned 19 different serotypes, 24 MLST
CCs, as defined by the eBURST algorithm [21], and a
set of laboratory (n = 1), disease-associated (n = 37) and
carriage-associated (n = 6) strains isolated in different
geographic locations. The sampled CCs accounted for
53% (1,715 0f 3,222) of the known sequence types (STs)
as of March 2009 if singletons are excluded (that is, STs
that are not part of any CC), or 42% (1,715 of 4,098) if
singletons are included.
Excluding gap-containing aligned areas, the cumulative
length of the alignment shared by all strains, the core
genome, was 1,536,569 bp. Given an average genome
length of 2,088,534 bp, on average 74% of each sequence
is conserved by all strains. This core genome alignment
had 79,171 polymorphic sites, of which 50,924 were
informative, that is, the substitution was common to at
least two sequences.
Based on the polymorphic sites, we computed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree that was rooted using
the S. mitis genomes as outgroup (Figure 1). This phylogeny had high bootstrap values in both the inner and
outer branches. Strains of the same ST or CC were monophyletic. In addition, six major monophyletic lineages (I to
VI in Figure 1) that included closely related STs or CCs
were identified. While details on the mutual relationships
between the lineages varied depending on the tree reconstruction method tested, the lineages themselves were supported with high confidence from alternative analyses
(Additional files 2 and 3). Since CCs always formed monophyletic branches in the genome-based tree and given the
coverage of our strain collection and of the MLST database, we estimate that about half of the circulating strains
of S. pneumoniae fall into one of the six lineages.
To quantify the correlation between phylogeny and
genome composition, we measured the average association value V [22] (see Materials and methods) of lineages
I to VI and the CCs with the presence/absence of dispensable genes (that is, genes present in more than one
strain but not in all strains; Additional file 4). Values of
V = 0.5 for lineages and V = 0.82 for CCs were obtained.
An even stronger association was found between the

allelic form of core genes and the classification into
lineages I to VI and CCs (V = 0.747 and V = 0.94,
respectively).
In general, the position on the tree (Figure 1) did
not reveal patterns predictive of whether strains were
associated with carriage or disease, nor their geographical site of isolation. In particular, the eight strains
isolated at a single institution in a short time window
[4] were distributed randomly across the tree, supporting a model of global circulation of pneumococcal
strains.

Frequent recombination distorts but does not obliterate
phylogenetic signals of descent from a common ancestor

Most S. pneumoniae strains and other related species are
naturally competent, that is, they can take up genetic
material from the environment and recombine it into
their chromosome [2,13,23], weakening the phylogenetic
signal contained in sequence alignments. To determine
the effect of homologous recombination on the phylogeny, we used split networks [24] to visualize the contrasting phylogenetic signals (Figure 2). The main groups
highlighted in Figure 1 are confirmed by the network

strains. In this representation, all the conflicting phylogenetic signals due to each SNP are represented as alternative bipartitions that account

analysis. Lineage V is split into two subgroups, one composed of the serotype 1 strains, and the other composed
of the two serotype 6B CC90 strains (670-6B and SP18),
which appear to be more similar to Taiwan19F-14. The
role of recombination was evident from the non tree-like
structure of the inner connections between the different
lineages, the presumed consequence of DNA exchange
amongst unrelated strains. However, the long branches
separating groups of strains closely related to the lineages
(I to VI) of Figure 1 support the idea that, while the inner
structure of the inferred genealogy of S. pneumoniae is
heavily influenced by recombination, molecular phylogenetic methods based on whole genomes are able to correctly reconstruct recent genealogical relationships.

Frequent recombination disrupts associations between
capsular serotypes and clonal complexes, except for
serotype 1

Poor correlation was observed between the serotype of a
strain and its position in the tree. The notable exceptions
were strains of serotypes 1 and 3, which formed two
monophyletic branches. However, while all serotype 3
strains (except SpnA45) were of a single ST (ST180), serotype 1 strains constituted three major lineages belonging to a single cluster with significant bootstrap support.
These lineages represent the three CCs (CC217, CC306
and CC2296) of circulating serotype 1 strains that are
associated with distinct geographical areas [25]. The
robustness of our sampling of serotype 1 was supported

Donati et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R107

by an analysis of the MLST database (see Materials and
methods). The three CCs present in our dataset
accounted for 87% of all serotype 1 strains, and five CCs
made up 97%, a situation very different from other serotypes that were much more heterogeneous in terms of
genotype composition. For comparison, 97% coverage
required 12 CCs for serotype 3, 14 CCs for serotype 14,
and 27 CCs for serotype 19F.
We tested the hypothesis that genetic exchange in serotype 1 strains is restricted by estimating the fraction of
680 core genes that displayed evidence of recombination
(see Materials and methods) in the serotype 1 strains.
We found evidence of recombination in 205 of 680 loci,
suggesting that the correlation between capsular serotype and position on the tree cannot be attributed only
to the low probability of exchange of genetic material
with strains of different serotypes.
The pan-genome of S. pneumoniae

Sequence variability can be described from static and
dynamic points of view. While a description of the
dynamics requires a realistic model of the relevant evolutionary processes, here we report a static description
that provides a synthetic representation of the genome
variability of the species in terms of a few parameters.
We calculated the size of the total S. pneumoniae gene
pool accessible to the species, or pan-genome, using two
different methodologies, namely the finite supragenome
model [26] and the power law regression model [3,27].
The finite supragenome model allows prediction of
the number of genes present in a given fraction of the
circulating strains, varying from rare genes (less then 3%
of the strains) to core genes (all the strains). Based on
the 44 sequenced strains, giving a total of 3,221 clusters
(Table 1), the number of core, dispensable and total
genes that would be expected for a 100-strain comparison was estimated. The model predicted a strong
decline in the number of new genes identified (1 per
genome at 100 strains) (Figure 3a) and stabilization in
the number of core genes at 1,647 (Figure 3b). The
supragenome model predicted that 48% of the genes are
core and approximately 27% are rare, that is, present in
less than 3% of the strains. Given that, by construction,
this model predicts a finite number of genes in the species, the maximum likelihood size of the pan-genome
was estimated to be 3,473 genes (range 3,300 to 5,000;
see Materials and methods). Thus, we estimate that the
44 strains taken together encompass 92.7% (3,221 of
3,473) of the pneumococcal pan-genome.
In contrast to the supragenome model, the power law
regression model [3] (Figure 4) allowed the extrapolation to an infinite number of strains, providing a prediction of whether the number of distinct genes that can
be found in S. pneumoniae is finite (closed pan-genome)
or unlimited (open pan-genome). A comparison of the

Page 5 of 19

data from Figures 3 and 4 showed that, for an intermediate number of genomes (<40) the predictions of
the two models were consistent. For large numbers of
genomes (>40), the finite supragenome model sharply
goes to zero, while in the regression model the average
number of new genes as a function of the number of
genomes is well described by a power law, with a fitted
exponent ξ = -1.0 ± 0.15 (Figure 4). Thus, the pan-genome is open, its size increasing logarithmically, findings
that position the pneumococcal species on the edge
between an open (ξ >-1) and closed (ξ <-1) pan-genome
(see Materials and methods).
To investigate how the size of the pan-genome is
related to the genetic diversity within the sample of
strains, and to estimate how the rate of acquisition of
new genes compares to the mutation rate, the pan-genome size was plotted versus the number of polymorphic
sites for samples of different sizes (Figure 5; see Materials and methods). The results show a linear correlation
between these two quantities. This result can be
explained if we assume that new genes and mutations
are acquired by pneumococci with constant rates (ω and
θ, respectively) over time. While these parameters cannot be estimated separately from the data, from the
slope of a linear fit of the two quantities plotted one
versus the other (Figure 5), the ratio ω/θ between the
rate of acquisition of new genes and the population
mutation rate can be estimated: ω/θ = 0.017 ± 0.002.
This result indicates that, on average, a new gene is
acquired by the population every 59 mutations.
Genome dynamics and evolution
Dispensable sequences are recent acquisition events, and
are frequently transferred among strains

To investigate how the dispensable genome is distributed in
the pneumococcal population, the frequency distribution of
the genome segments that were absent from at least one
strain was studied. To avoid bias and give equal weight to all
acquisition and loss events, we selected the 1,030 genomic
regions longer than 500 bp that were not present in all
strains, irrespective of the number of genes that they encoded
(see Materials and methods). Figure 6 depicts a histogram
counting the number of strains sharing a particular region.
The distribution is bi-modal, since the variable regions were
present either in most of the 44 strains, likely representing a
recent deletion, or in a small proportion of strains (less than
10), probably including recent acquisition events.
To gain insight into the dynamics of the dispensable
genome, the most parsimonious pattern of acquisitions
and losses compatible with the tree in Figure 1 was
reconstructed for each variable region. In Figure 7 we
show a histogram counting the number of segments
that have undergone a given number of acquisition or
loss events during the evolution of the species. The

elements (yellow bars in Figure 7).
On the basis of these data, the presence or absence of
dispensable regions can be used to discriminate only
recently diverging groups of strains, whereas they give a
much weaker signal for older differentiation events, indicating that the dispensable genome composition cannot
resolve the inner structure of the phylogenetic tree of
the species (Additional file 5).

Despite the presence of widespread recombination, the
persistence of a detectable phylogenetic signal in whole
genome alignments indicates that recombination, although
frequent, did not completely obscure the non-random
association of polymorphisms at distant loci. To further
investigate this phenomenon, the correlation between
polymorphisms at different loci, or linkage disequilibrium
(LD), was characterized by measuring the Lewontin’s D’
parameter [28] as a function of the distance along the
chromosome (Figure 8). D’ quickly converged to a plateau,
as expected under a gene conversion model, where
exchange of DNA sequences occurs through the substitution of short stretches of DNA with homologous DNA
from a different cell. An exponential fit to the data (green
line in Figure 8) revealed a decay length x0 = 896 ± 7 bp,
and a plateau value A = 0.7103 ± 0.002. These results do
not change appreciably if closely related strains are
excluded from the analysis by retaining only one representative strain for each ST.
The value of the characteristic length of the recombining
segments, close to the average length of genes (855 bp in
the sequenced strains), is probably the result of a bias
towards events in which entire genes are exchanged, and
is similar to the estimates previously obtained in a different species [29]. The relatively high value of the D’ plateau
indicates that recombination, although frequent, did not
completely obscure the non-random association of distant
alleles, implying that long sequences contain a coherent
phylogenetic signal even in the presence of recombination,
as recently found by simulations [14].
To quantify the relative contribution of mutation and
recombination to sequence variability, for each of the
locally collinear blocks (LCBs) of the core alignment we

both θ and r for the different regions of the alignment.
θ ranged between 7.06 × 10-5 and 0.019, with an average
of 0.0032, while r ranged between 9.3 × 10-5 and 0.98,

with an average of 0.018. The average value of the ratio
r/θ between the recombination rate r and the mutation
rate θ was equal to 5.57. We estimated the relative
impact of recombination and mutation in generating the
sequence diversity of S. pneumoniae by computing the
rate θr at which a mutation is introduced by a recombination event and the ratio θr/θ, where θ is the mutation
rate. θr was estimated using the formula θr = θ·r·l, where
l is the average length of the recombining segments, and
θ and r are the mutation and recombination rates,
respectively. Considering l = 896 bp, as determined from
the linkage disequilibrium decay length (Figure 8), we
estimated that the rate θr was θr = θ·r·l = 0.052, and the
average value of the ratio θ r /θ was θ r /θ = 16.2, to be
compared with the previous estimate of θ r /θ = 50
obtained for housekeeping genes [31].

To gain insight into the differences underlying closely
related pathogenic and non-pathogenic streptococcal
species, the comparative analysis performed on the 44
genomes of S. pneumoniae was extended to include four
S. mitis, one S. oralis and one S. infantis strains (Additional file 1).
The whole genome alignment of the 50 strains was
computed. Excluding gaps, 998,057 bp of each sequence
can be aligned against all other sequences, representing,
on average, 48% of the pneumococcal genomes, 51% of
the S. mitis genomes (average genome length of
1,949,224 bp), and 53% and 55% of the S. oralis and
S. infantis genomes, respectively. Of these, 283,596 positions were polymorphic. A phylogenetic tree based on
these polymorphic sites (Figure 9, where the S. pneumoniae branch is collapsed for readability) revealed that

value calculated among S. mitis strains was much larger
(0.066 ± 0.007), and only slightly smaller than that
between strains of S. mitis and S. pneumoniae (0.081 ±
0.010), confirming the high variability of the S. mitis
species [1] and suggesting that S. pneumoniae is a
pathogenic and epidemiologically successful clone of a
larger distinct and coherent population that includes the
numerous S. mitis lineages.

the most divergent species from S. pneumoniae is
S. infantis, followed by S. oralis, while the S. mitis
strains are the most closely related to S. pneumoniae.
Interestingly, while the average genetic distance among
the S. pneumoniae strains was 0.010 ± 0.001, the same

To characterize the differences in the genomic composition between the different species, we computed the set
of cluster of ortholog genes shared by all S. pneumoniae
isolates and by S. pneumoniae, S. mitis, S. infantis, and
S. oralis (Table 1). In total, these four species contained
4,904 clusters of orthologs, of which 1,111 are present in
all strains. We investigated how the size of the pan- and
core genome is influenced by the addition of strains
belonging to closely related species (Figure 10). The addition of the first S. mitis strain contributed approximately
200 new genes to the pneumococcal pan-genome. As an
additional three strains were added, each introduced
approximately 200 new genes, providing further evidence
for the high variability of the dispensable part of the genome of S. mitis.
On the other hand, as might be expected for the addition of a different species, the first S. mitis strain caused
a drop in the core genome from approximately 51% to
approximately 39% of the total clusters, showing that
some of the essential pneumococcal genes are not core
in S. mitis. Yet, additional S. mitis strains had a minimal
effect on the core genome, reflecting stabilization in the
number of core genes shared between these species. The
effect of the S. mitis strains on the streptococcus pangenome calculation stood in stark contrast to the effect
of S. pyogenes and/or S. sanguinis strains, since addition
of any of these added over 1,000 new genes and caused
a sharp drop in the core genome to less then 14% of the
total genes. The difference in magnitude between the
increase in variability observed from the inclusion of
S. mitis strains relative to that observed with S. sanguinis or S. pyogenes strains highlights the close relationship between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis.
S. mitis evolved by genome reduction from its common
ancestor with S. pneumoniae

To gain insight into the speciation of the S. pneumoniaeS. mitis complex, we inferred the genomic content of the
common ancestors of S. pneumoniae (node 1 in Figure 9),
S. mitis (node 2 in Figure 9) and of the S. pneumoniae-S.
mitis complex (node 3 in Figure 9) using maximum likelihood. According to this reconstruction, the ancestral genome of all S. pneumoniae strains was composed of 2,281
genes, while the ancestral genome of S. mitis was

composed of 1,888 genes, and the genome of the common ancestor of S. pneumoniae and S. mitis encoded
2,039 genes. For comparison, the average number of
genes of S. pneumoniae is 2,104, and the average number
of genes in S. mitis is 1,900. Although probably biased by
the different number of sequenced S. mitis and S. pneumoniae strains, these results indicate that while the size
of the S. mitis genomes has reduced since their diversification from S. pneumoniae, the ancestral S. pneumoniae
genome has grown since its diversification from S. mitis
while contemporary S. pneumoniae strains are now in a
process of genome reduction. Interestingly, S. pneumoniae strains were more closely related to the ancestor of
S. mitis (node 2 in Figure 10) than to the contemporary
sequenced S. mitis strains themselves. Indeed, while contemporary S. pneumoniae strains shared between 71%
(Hungary19A_16) and 67% (CDC0288) of their genome
with the reconstructed ancestral S. mitis genome (node 2
in Figure 9), contemporary S. mitis strains conserved
only between 67% and 64% of the genome of their common ancestor. These observations support the recently
proposed theory that S. mitis evolved by genome reduction from a bacterium closely related to S. pneumoniae
[1].
S. mitis and other streptococci are the main reservoir of
genetic variability for S. pnemoniae

S. pneumoniae and S. mitis are known to colonize the
same ecological niche and to actively exchange genetic
material [32]. It is therefore interesting to quantify the
degree by which homologous recombination and HGT
between these two species contributed to the evolution
of their core and dispensable genomes.

Figure 10 Variation of the number of dispensable and core
genes upon the addition of new species or strains. Strains are
added sequentially, starting with the 44 S. pneumoniae strains
followed by the S. mitis (region I), S. oralis and S. infantis (region II),
S sanguinis and S. pyogenes (region III) strains.

To estimate the fraction of the genome shared by
S. pneumoniae and S. mitis that has been exchanged by
homologous recombination, we have computed the number of bi-allelic SNPs in the multiple alignment of the 50
genomes that are polymorphic both in S. pneumoniae
and in S. mitis. We found that of the 49,670 SNPs in
S. pneumoniae (107,602 in S. mitis), 14,655 were bi-allelic
also in S. mitis. Although the directionality of the
exchange events cannot be established, these data suggest
that as much as 30% of the sequence variability in the
part of the genome of S. pneumoniae shared with S. mitis
could be due to homologous recombination with the latter. This fraction is likely to be an underestimate, due to
the small number of sequenced S. mitis strains.
In order to identify the most likely origin of genes
recently acquired by S. pneumoniae and to estimate the
contribution of HGT between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis
to the evolution of the dispensable genome of the former,
all dispensable genes present in less than 50% of the
S. pneumoniae strains were searched against a database
of 792 complete bacterial genomes, supplemented by the
newly sequenced S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis. The
choice to restrict the analysis to genes present in a minority of the sequenced strains is aimed at minimizing the
probability that these genes were present in the ancestor
of S. pneumoniae and lost by some lineages, although
this possibility cannot be ruled out. To select only recent
acquisitions, hits with >90% identity over >90% of the
sequence of the query gene were considered. Of 1,286

Donati et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R107

genes, only 16% (200) had a hit satisfying the cutoff. The
vast majority of these (183 of 200) shared the highest
homology with other streptococci. In particular, 62%
(113) of the hits are in at least one of the S. mitis strains,
followed by 31 hits in Streptococcus suis, 24 in Streptococcus pyogenes, 5 in Streptococcus agalactiae and S. oralis, 4
in S. infantis and 1 in Streptococcus gordonii. Hits outside
the Streptococcus genus are: 7 in Finegoldia magna, 3 in
Staphylococcus aureus, 2 in Staphylococcus epidermidis,
2 in Macrococcus caseolyticus, and 1 in each of Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus fecalis, and Lacobacillus reuteri. These data demonstrate that although most genes
acquired by S. pneumoniae come from an unknown
source, most of the genes with hits to the 792 complete
bacterial genomes appear in other streptococci, and in
particular in S. mitis, although HGT between distant species is also occasionally possible. Given the high variability of the S. mitis species, it is possible that many of the
remaining 1,086 genes of unknown origin were acquired
from S. mitis strains not yet sequenced, or more generally, from other still unknown bacterial species.
Strain distribution of genes involved in host-pathogen
interaction and virulence

To elucidate the relationship between virulence potential
and the evolution of S. pneumoniae, we have determined
the distribution and conservation level of a set of 47
proteins that are either surface exposed, or known to be
involved in interaction with the host and virulence [15].
The panel of selected proteins includes the entire set of
LPXTG cell wall anchored molecules, and the choline
binding proteins, a family of surface proteins that are
specific to pneumococci and that are involved in bacterium-host cell adhesion [33]. Furthermore, we have
added pneumolysin (Ply), a cholesterol-dependent cytotoxin implicated in multiple steps of pneumococcal
pathogenesis [34,35], and a number of proteins that
have been investigated as potential vaccine candidates
[36], including the histidine triad proteins PhtA, B, D, E
[37], PpmA [38], PsaA [39], PppA [40], and PcsB and
StkP [41]. The distribution and level of conservation of
each of these proteins within pneumococcal strains and
the presence in S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis are
reported in Table 2 and Additional file 6.
Out of 47 selected proteins, 31 are part of the core
genome of S. pneumoniae (since our dataset includes
several draft genomes, we consider proteins present in
43 of 44 genomes to be conserved in all strains). Of
these, 27 have an average percentage of identity greater
than 90%, while the remaining are the well-known
hypervariable proteins PspA, PspC, ZmpB and the IgA1
protease, four of the most important virulence factors
expressed by S. pneumoniae [42-46].
According to sequence conservation, PspA is subdivided
into three families, which in turn are classified into different

Page 10 of 19

clades: family 1 is composed of two clades (clade 1 and 2),
family 2 comprises three clades (clades 3, 4 and 5), and
family 3 has only one divergent clade (clade 6) [42]. Similarly, PspC has been classified in 11 major variants, based
on sequence similarity and gene organization [47]. To verify
whether the allelic profile of antigens correlates with pneumococcal phylogeny, we have mapped the allelic variants of
PspA and PspC onto the tree of the species (Figure 11). As
is generally found for most core genes, an overall strong
association between allelic variants and MLST was
observed, in agreement with recent data on PspA [48].
However, we found instances where a single ST or CC corresponds to more than one allelic variant (for example, the
two antigens exist in two different variants within ST180
strains; similarly PspA,C in CC15, PspC in CC156, PspC in
CC90), and little correlation was found with the lineages I
to VI.
The remaining 16 proteins, including the structural
components of the pneumococcal pili PI-1 (RrgA, RrgB
and RrgC) and PI-2 (PitA and PitB), the serine-rich repeat
protein PsrP [49], the putative neuraminidase NanC, five
members of the choline binding proteins family (CbpC, I,
J, F, and PcpA), the histidine triad proteins PhtA, D, E and
the zinc metalloprotease ZmpC, were present in a variable
number of strains (from 6 to 39).
The poor correlation between phylogeny and protein
presence (Figure 11; Additional file 4) suggested that
genes encoding proteins with antigenic properties might
be acquired and lost easily. A good level of association was
noted for PI-1 and PI-2 components, as previously
reported [11,12], and for PsrP. According to a parsimonious reconstruction, the PI-1 islet appears to be present
in the root of the S. pneumoniae tree, and to have been
repeatedly lost during the course of evolution.
The patchy distribution of most of the surface-exposed
proteins with antigenic properties is probably due to the
selection exerted by the immune system, which selects for
strains able to vary their repertoire of virulence-related
genes. In the case of PI-1, evidence of selection driven by
host immune response has recently been shown [50].
Furthermore, 34, 24 and 20 of the 47 putative virulence
factors were also present in S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis, respectively, further supporting the concept that these
commensals act as main gene reservoirs for S. pneumoniae.
A closer look at the differences between S. pneumoniae
and S. mitis revealed that some of the putative virulence
factors that are always present and extremely conserved in
S. pneumoniae are absent from all S. mitis strains. This
group includes the hyalorunidase HysA, in agreement with
the finding that S. mitis does not have hyaluronidase activity [1], StrH, which is involved in early colonization of the
nasopharynx [51] and resistance to phagocytic killing [52],
the choline binding protein G CbpG, and the two cell wall
anchor proteins SP_0368 and SP_1992. Although the

Figure 11 Presence/absence pattern of the PI-1, PI-2 pilus-encoding islets, psrP, and allelic variants of the core pspA and pspC genes.
To show the degree of correlation with the phylogeny of S. pneumoniae, the data are reported on the phylogenetic tree of the S. pneumoniae
strains. Only the topology of the tree is shown, branch lengths are not to scale. Red bars mark strains of the same ST, and blue bars mark strains
of different STs, but of the same CC. For PI-1, PI2 and psrP, green squares indicate presence while gray squares indicate absence. For pspA and
pspC, the numbers indicate the allelic variants defined according to [42,47].

sampling of S. mitis is far from being exhaustive of the
diversity of this species, this observation could suggest that
these protein factors are crucial for pathogenicity.

Conclusions
We have studied the genomic variability of S. pneumoniae in a large panel of isolates, including multiple serotypes and clonal complexes. Despite the effect of
widespread recombination, the phylogeny inferred by a
whole genome alignment is well supported and confirms
the MLST-based classification. In particular, we found
that strains of the same CC are highly correlated, both
in terms of the composition of their dispensable genome
and in the allelic variants of core genes. Given that the
CCs represented in our collection account for 44% of
the STs in the MLST database (56% excluding singletons), this study provides a good sample of the overall

species diversity of S. pneumoniae. We identified six
lineages broader than MLST classification that reveal
more ancient relationships. However, since recombination events accumulate with time, these ancient groups
are more affected than MLST-based CCs. As a consequence, the strength of the association with the composition of the genome is stronger for MLST than for
lineage-based classification.
The dispensable genes are usually shared by small
groups of strains and are frequently acquired and lost,
suggesting that most of them are not fixed in the long
term. This is compatible with previous analyses on the
dispensable genome of Escherichia coli, where it was
estimated that, on average, dispensable sequences are
lost after 6.7 million years, to be compared with the 100
million years since the speciation of E. coli from Salmonella enterica [53].

The pan-genome of the S. pneumoniae species is
open, and newly sequenced strains contribute a decreasing number of genes, as expected if the natural population of S. pneumoniae derived from a common ancestor.
The longer an individual has evolved independently, the
more new genes it will potentially contribute to the species pan-genome. The size of the pan-genome therefore
reflects the degree to which the sequenced strains are
phylogenetically related, and it yields information on the
evolution of the species. A fast growing pan-genome,
with strains that are quickly diversifying by integrating
new genes, indicates that the species is exploring novel
evolutionary possibilities. This process, we suppose, is
only transient in the evolution of S. pneumoniae or any
other species, since there are constraints on this diversification if the natural population is to remain a species.
The position of S. pneumoniae on the extreme limit of
being open is likely not due to chance. The species is
possibly adapted to its current ecological niche, but is
just open to the acquisition of new genes while maintaining stability. Analyzing the origin of dispensable
sequences, we found that S. mitis is the main external
reservoir of genetic variability of S. pneumoniae, and
that most events of HGT involve closely related species
that share a similar ecological niche.
Given these results, it is legitimate to ask why these
organisms maintain a costly system to acquire, modify
and lose genetic material. Experimental and simulation
studies have shown that, under certain environmental
conditions, intra-species homologous recombination
increases the fitness of bacterial populations [54-56], at
the same time limiting the divergence of lineages due to
drift [57]. Similarly, it is conceivable that an open pangenome, together with a mechanism to spread genes
through unrelated strains, guarantees the species a quick
and economical response to fluctuating environments.
These findings have obvious implications for vaccine
design. Subunit vaccines based on variable genes with
alleles that do not cross-protect might be subject to allele
replacement. Similarly, dispensable genes used for vaccination might be discarded under the effect of immune
pressure, unless they confer a selective advantage to the
harboring strain. Although the estimated turnover timescale of the dispensable genome appears to be long, the
selective pressure exerted by widespread vaccination
could speed up these processes, as indicated by capsular
switching events reported following the introduction of
the heptavalent conjugate vaccine [58].

Materials and methods
Genome sequences

All genome sequences used in this study are listed in
Additional file 1. They include complete genomes where

Page 14 of 19

all gaps remaining after assembly of shotgun reads have
been closed. The TIGR4 genome sequence, the first one
published [15], meets the absolute definition of a
sequencing gold standard with all nucleotides covered
by at least two reads, in most cases in opposite directions, all the repeated sequences confirmed for proper
assembly, and all consensus bases inspected manually.
Because this is an extremely time consuming effort,
bringing all genomes to gold standard is not practically
feasible. Thus, the other complete genomes do not meet
the absolute gold standard but were nevertheless
inspected for proper assembly and manually inspected
for ambiguous consensus base calls.
The quality of draft genomes is highly dependent on the
sequencing technology or technologies used and the
amount of sequence coverage generated (Additional file 1).
All the draft genomes used in this study display a minimum average sequence coverage per base of 10 ×. This
combined with the requirement to identify SNPs shared by
at least two genomes (see below) warrants that the SNPs
used in this study are of high quality.
Multiple genome alignments and identification of SNPs

Multiple genome alignments have been computed using
the progressiveMauve algorithm of the Mauve software
[59] using default options. Mauve produces an output file
containing separate alignments for each LCB. We have
extracted and concatenated each LCB containing
sequences from each of the 44 genomes to build a core
genome multiple alignment. From the concatenated multiple alignment the polymorphic sites were determined.
Polymorphic sites were identified from this core genome alignment as the loci where at least one sequence
had a mutated base. We identified 79,171 polymorphic
sites, of which 50,924 were informative, that is, the
mutation was common to at least two sequences. While
it is possible that some of the SNPs that are specific to
a single sequence are due to sequencing errors, this possibility becomes very unlikely in the case of informative
sites. Strain-specific SNPs can have an effect on the estimated value of the mutation rate and on the branch
length of the phylogenetic tree. However, they do not
affect the structure of the tree and the estimates of the
recombination rate.
Clonal complex designation

CCs were defined running eBurst [21] on the whole
S. pneumoniae MLST database downloaded from the
MLST website [60] in March 2009. Briefly, internal fragments of the aroE, gdh, gki, recP, spi, xpt, and ddl genes
are sequenced and compared to alleles from the S. pneumoniae MLST website [60] for ST determination. In
MLST, an ST is uniquely determined by the allelic profile.
CCs are groups of STs that share a recent common

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were computed
using RaxML [61] using the GTR model and discrete
Gamma distributed rate parameters with four categories
with bootstrap. RAxML first conducts a bootstrap
search then identifies the best scoring tree with maximum likelihood and reports the support values for each
branch of the best scoring tree. Branch support was
computed by bootstrap with 1,000 replicates.

statistical software [63]. Briefly, for the presence/absence
profiles of each gene, we have computed the Cramer’s V
association index and the P-value of the Pearson correlation [22] with both the lineages defined in Figure 1
and the CCs. A value of V equal to 1 indicates perfect
association between the partitions of the strains and the
presence/absence, while V = 0 means that dispensable
genes are randomly distributed amongst the groups. The
P-values give the statistical significance of the
association.
The allelic forms of the 680 selected core genes were
assigned from the multiple alignments by giving a different ID to each different sequence. Similarly to the analysis performed for the presence/absence profiles of
dispensable genes, for each gene we computed the Cramer’s V and the P-value of the Pearson correlation
between the allelic designation and the lineages and
CCs.

Phylogenetic networks

Identification of putatively recombining loci

Phylogenetic networks were generated using the program SplitsTree v.4 [24] using the NeighborNet method
and distances computed with the Kimura 2 parameters
substitution model.

For a given monophyletic group, we selected those of
the 680 core genes that have at least two distinct
alleles within the group, both of which are also present in other strains outside the group. In an infinite
sites model it is guaranteed that, if the group is monophyletic, at least one of the two alleles has undergone
recombination. This method provides a conservative
estimate of the fraction of genes that underwent
homologous recombination, since it cannot identify
recombination where only a fraction of a gene is
transferred and it is limited to cases in which both the
parent and recombinant alleles are present in the
dataset.

ancestor. The eBURST algorithm [21] defines clonal complexes by partitioning the MLST data set into groups of
single-locus variants, that is, profiles that differ at one of
the seven MLST loci. This partitioning associates each ST
with a CC and identifies the most likely founder ST, which
is defined as being the ST with the greatest number of single-locus variants within the CC. Computed CCs were
named after the ST of the predicted founder.
Phylogenetic trees

Clustering of orthologous genes

A complete description of the algorithms used to create the orthologous clusters is given by Hogg et al.
[26]. Briefly, to allocate the genes into core or dispensable gene clusters, tfasty34 (Fasta package, version
3.4) was used for six-frame translation homology
searches of all predicted proteins against all possible
translations [62]. Software designed at the Center for
Genomic Sciences was used to parse this output,
grouping the genes into clusters that share 70% identity over 70% of the length with one or more of the
other genes in the cluster. These parameters were
selected because they minimize the change in the
number of clusters per change in parameters and thus
may represent a good estimate to distinguish orthologs
from paralogs [26]. To account for the cases where
genes were missed in the gene-calling step, fasta34
(Fasta package, version 3.4) was used to align all predicted genes against the contigs. If an alignment with
the required score was detected in the contig, the gene
was considered present even if the prediction software
did not identify the gene.

Calculation of pan-genome size
Finite supragenome model

The finite supragenome model predicts the number of
clusters of orthologous genes present in six population
frequencies, varying from rare genes (less then 3% of the
strains) to core genes (all the strains) [26]. The finite
supragenome model trained on 44 sequenced strains
identified a total of 3,221 clusters (Table 1) that were
used to predict the number of core, dispensable and
total clusters of orthologous genes expected for a 100strain comparison. At 100 sequenced strains, the supragenome model predicts that 48% of the clusters are core
and approximately 27% of the clusters are rare, that is,
present in less than 3% of the strains.

Allelic designation of core genes and association tests

Power law model

The association between presence/absence of dispensable genes and the allelic form of core genes with the
lineages I to VI and the CCs has been tested using the
function ‘assocstats’ of the vcd v.1.2-3 package of the R

The average size Ω(n) of the pan-genome as a function
of the number of strains n can be computed from the
number of new genes N(n) found by sequencing the
n-th genome by the following relation:

Donati et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R107

Ω ( n ) = Ω0 +

n

∑N(i)
i =2

where Ω0 is the average number of genes in a strain.
By assuming N(n) = A*nξ we obtain:
⎧ C + A n 1 +
 > −1
1
⎪ 1
⎪
Ω ( n ) ≅ ⎨ C 2 + A2 ln ( n )  = −1 n → ∞
⎪
A3
 < −1
⎪
⎩

where A1, A2, A3, C1 and C2 are constants. The pangenome is ‘open’, that is, diverges as a power law for
n ® ∞ for ξ > -1, logarithmically for ξ = -1, while it
converges to a constant, that is, it is closed for ξ < -1.
Dependency of the pan-genome size and the number of
polymorphic sites

If we assume that each strain has a constant probability
ω per unit of time to acquire a gene, the average number of new genes contributed by a strain to the pan-genome is proportional to the time t(n) since this has
evolved independently from the n already sequenced
strains. t(n), on average, decreases with n, since it is
increasingly difficult to find new strains that are not closely related to the already sequenced ones. The average
size Ω(n) of the pan-genome in a sample of n strains is
given by:
Ω ( n ) ≅ Ω 0 + T ( n )

where T(n) is the average length of the phylogenetic
tree of the strains and Ω 0 is the average size of a S.
pneumoniae genome. If the tree distribution is well
described by a coalescent process both with and without
recombination, t(n) and T(n) are proportional to 1/n
and 1n(n), respectively, for n ® ∞ [64], in agreement
with our data (Figure 4 and Figure 5 inset). Similarly,
the number of segregating sites in a set of n sequences
is given by:
S ( n ) ≅ T ( n )

where θ is the population mutation rate. Substituting
the average tree length, we obtain:
Ω ( n ) ≅ Ω0 +


S(n)


Therefore, by a linear fit of the relation between S(n)
and Ω(n) we can estimate the ratio between the rate of
acquisition of new genes and the mutation rate.

Linkage disequilibrium

For each pair of polymorphic sites, we computed D’
using the formula:
D
⎧
⎪ min p , q , p q
( 1 2 2 1)
⎪
D’ = ⎨
D
⎪−
⎪ min ( p1q1 , p 2q 2 )
⎩

D>0
D<0

D = p11p22 - p12p21 where pij is the proportion of individuals carrying allele i at site 1 and allele j at site 2, and
pi,qi are the proportion of individuals carrying allele i at
site 1 and 2, respectively. D’ was then averaged over all
pairs of polymorphic sites within a given alignment
block as a function of their distance along the
chromosome.
Definition of the dispensable sequences

From the multiple genome alignment obtained using
Mauve we selected 1,958 variable regions, that is, LCBs
that are absent in one or more genomes and are longer
than 500 bp, in order to avoid small regions where
alignments could be problematic. Due to the alignment
algorithm of Mauve, these regions are not split by indels
in one or more of the genomes [59]. Of these regions,
1,030 are present in two or more strains and therefore
are informative from the point of view of phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Genetic distances

The average genetic distance within and between the
S. pneumoniae and the S. mitis groups was calculated by
selecting the portions of the multiple genome alignment
that were common to 50 genomes, concatenating those
aligned sequences into a single multiple alignment and
then computing on the concatenated sequences the pairwise per-site number of substitutions using the maximum composite likelihood method [65] for the TamuraNei substitution model [66] using Mega 4.1 [67].
Reconstruction of acquisition/loss events with parsimony

We represented the presence/absence of each of the
1,030 informative variable segments as a 0/1 character,
and we computed the parsimony score Sp of the tree for
each of these characters. The parsimony score of a discrete character on a tree is the minimum number of
state transitions that a character must have undergone if
it evolved on a given tree, and in this case represents
the minimum number of independent acquisition/loss
events that are necessary for a given pattern of presence/absence. If the distribution of a given character
can be explained by a single acquisition/loss, its

Donati et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/10/R107

Page 17 of 19

parsimony score is 1, while if multiple events of acquisition/loss are necessary, its parsimony score is greater
than 1 according to the rule Sp = Na + Nl where Na and
N l are the number of acquisitions and losses, respectively. Since an acquisition followed by a recombination
event can always be explained by multiple acquisitions,
events with Na > 1 are possible intra-species recombination events.

Ancestral genomes were reconstructed using the ‘ace’
function of the package ape v. 2.3 of the R software [68].
The presence/absence of each gene in a given strain was
indicated as a two state discrete character (1 for presence,
0 for absence), and an asymmetric transition matrix
between the two states with different acquisition/loss
rates was assumed. The rates of acquisition/loss and the
states in the internal nodes were determined by maximizing the likelihood of the observed distribution assuming
that strains evolve on the three shown in Figure 1. A
gene was considered to be present in a given node if the
likelihood of the state ‘1’ exceeded 0.5.
