Reduced MHC and neutral variation in the
Galápagos hawk, an island endemic
Jennifer L Bollmer1,2*, Joshua M Hull3,4, Holly B Ernest3,5, José H Sarasola6 and Patricia G Parker1

Abstract
Background: Genes at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known for high levels of polymorphism
maintained by balancing selection. In small or bottlenecked populations, however, genetic drift may be strong
enough to overwhelm the effect of balancing selection, resulting in reduced MHC variability. In this study we
investigated MHC evolution in two recently diverged bird species: the endemic Galápagos hawk (Buteo
galapagoensis), which occurs in small, isolated island populations, and its widespread mainland relative, the
Swainson’s hawk (B. swainsoni).
Results: We amplified at least two MHC class II B gene copies in each species. We recovered only three different
sequences from 32 Galápagos hawks, while we amplified 20 unique sequences in 20 Swainson’s hawks. Most of
the sequences clustered into two groups in a phylogenetic network, with one group likely representing
pseudogenes or nonclassical loci. Neutral genetic diversity at 17 microsatellite loci was also reduced in the
Galápagos hawk compared to the Swainson’s hawk.
Conclusions: The corresponding loss in neutral diversity suggests that the reduced variability present at Galápagos
hawk MHC class II B genes compared to the Swainson’s hawk is primarily due to a founder event followed by
ongoing genetic drift in small populations. However, purifying selection could also explain the low number of
MHC alleles present. This lack of variation at genes involved in the adaptive immune response could be cause for
concern should novel diseases reach the archipelago.

Background
Genes at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
are known for their high levels of polymorphism [1],
and for their importance in initiating the adaptive vertebrate immune response by binding to foreign peptides
and presenting them to T cells [2]. Class I MHC molecules primarily bind to peptides derived from intracellular pathogens, while class II molecules are associated
with extracellular pathogens. MHC variability is maintained through balancing selection, with parasitemediated natural selection and MHC-dependent sexual
selection being the most likely mechanisms [2]. A number of lines of evidence indicate that MHC genes are
under selection [3], including an excess of nonsynonymous mutations at the peptide-binding region [4] and
the long-term retention of allelic lineages post* Correspondence: bollmer@uwm.edu

speciation (trans-species polymorphism; [5]). Discrepancies between population genetic structure at selectively
neutral and MHC loci also provide evidence of selection
[6,7], because both neutral and MHC loci are affected
by neutral forces (gene flow, genetic drift), but only
MHC loci should also be affected by selection.
Many natural populations studied have the high variability expected at MHC loci [8,9]. While population bottlenecks are predicted to result in a loss of variability,
balancing selection may counteract the effects of drift
unless the effective population size becomes so low relative to the selection coefficient that genes under balancing selection behave in a neutral manner [10,11]. A few
studies have found relatively high variability at MHC
genes in bottlenecked species with low neutral variability
[12-14]. However, most studies of small island [15,16]
and mainland [17,18] populations that have undergone
severe bottlenecks have documented reduced MHC
diversity and concluded that genetic drift had overwhelmed selection (reviewed in [19]).

In this study, we investigated MHC and neutral
genetic variation in an island species, the Galápagos
hawk (Buteo galapagoensis), and its closest mainland
relative, the Swainson’s hawk (B. swainsoni; [20]). Galápagos hawks are endemic to the Galápagos Archipelago
and breed on eight islands but were historically distributed on these and three additional islands (Figure 1). No
systematic estimate of current population size exists for
Galápagos hawks; however, our rough estimates are that
two populations consist of several hundred individuals
each, while the other six almost certainly are fewer than
100 individuals each.

Previous genetic work revealed low within-population
variability and significant between-population differentiation at minisatellite and mitochondrial loci [21,22],
indicating little to no current gene flow among islands.
In contrast, the migratory Swainson’s hawk ([23]; Figure
1), whose population size is unknown but likely numbers at least in the hundreds of thousands based on
counts of migrants [24], shows limited population
genetic structuring across its western North American
breeding range [25]. With their broader distribution and
larger population sizes, Swainson’s hawks are more variable than Galápagos hawks at minisatellite [26] and

Figure 1 Distributions of the Galápagos (Buteo galapagoensis) and Swainson’s hawks (B. swainsoni). The Galápagos Islands (inset) are
located on the equator about 1000 km off the coast of South America. The archipelago is volcanic in origin and there is no evidence that it has
ever been connected to the mainland. The Galápagos hawk has breeding populations on all the gray-filled islands; breeding populations have
been extirpated from Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal, and Floreana. The Swainson’s hawk distribution is from [83]. While the majority of Swainson’s
hawks overwinter in Argentina, some winter in the southern United States and Mexico.

mitochondrial loci [22,27]. Mitochondrial data suggest
that these two species diverged recently relative to other
avian taxa, approximately 125,000 years ago (95% CI:
51,000 - 254,000; [22]). Hull et al. [27] documented
mitochondrial paraphyly of the Swainson’s hawk relative
to the Galápagos hawk, likely a result of incomplete
lineage sorting subsequent to colonization.
Here we present the first characterization of MHC
class II B genes in Galápagos and Swainson’s hawks
with the goal of comparing MHC variability in these
two species. We predicted that variability would be
lower in the Galápagos hawk due to a genetic bottleneck
at foundation followed by ongoing genetic drift in these
small populations. To better assess the role of genetic
drift, we genotyped Galápagos hawks at nuclear microsatellite loci to compare neutral diversity with Swainson’s hawks (data from [25]). Finally, we provide a
preliminary assessment of MHC evolution in these two
closely related species by characterizing the gene copies
amplified.

Results
MHC diversity

Sequencing of exon 2 from MHC class II B genes revealed
that Galápagos hawks had lower MHC diversity than

Swainson’s hawks. We recovered three different MHC
sequences from 32 Galápagos hawks and 20 sequences
from the 20 Swainson’s hawks sampled. Each sequence
yielded a different amino acid sequence, and no frameshift
mutations or stop codons were present (Figure 2). Each
Galápagos hawk individual had two or three sequences.
One sequence, Buga*01, was present in all individuals. All
individuals also had one or both of Buga*02 and Buga*03:
twelve individuals had only Buga*02, fifteen had only
Buga*03, and five had both. The most parsimonious explanation for this pattern is that the primer set amplified two
loci: a locus that is fixed for Buga*01 and a locus that has
two alleles, with individuals being homozygous or heterozygous for Buga*02 and Buga*03. Buga*02 and Buga*03
differed by only one base pair; in contrast, Buga*02 and
Buga*03 differed from Buga*01 by 30 and 31 bases,
respectively, out of 255 bp, and had a one codon deletion
not present in Buga*01 (Figure 2). We sampled only four
birds per island, so our characterization of the geographic
distribution of Buga*02 and Buga*03 is preliminary; however, each was present on at least six of the eight islands:
Santa Fe, Pinta, Santiago, and Fernandina had both
sequences; Pinzón and Marchena had only Buga*02; and
Española and Isabela had only Buga*03. Buga*01 was present on all islands.

From the Swainson’s hawks, we recovered 20 different
sequences, with each individual having three or four
confirmed sequences. Fifth sequences were recovered
from three of the individuals; however, we were unable
to confirm these because in each case the fifth sequence
amplified in only one reaction or did not sequence
cleanly. So, every individual had at least two loci. In the
20 birds sampled, we found 18 different MHC genotypes
(three birds had the same three sequences). The most
common sequence (Busw*08) was recovered from 11
different birds, while 11 of the sequences were recovered
from one or two birds. Four of the 20 sequences had a 3
bp deletion at the same codon as the two Galápagos
hawk sequences. Of the 255 sites considered, 72 were
variable (compared to 31 in Galápagos hawks), and
sequences differed by an average of 26.0 ± 12.1 bp.

sequences and the fixed Galápagos hawk sequence
(Buga*01) formed a cluster designated Group 1, ten
Swainson’s and the two remaining Galápagos hawk
sequences formed a second group (Group 2), and one
Swainson’s sequence (Busw*12) was divergent from the
rest, being more similar to sequences from other species. All six sequences with the codon deletion were in
Group 2. One common buzzard (Buteo buteo) sequence
(Bubu1) also fell into Group 1, while the second buzzard
sequence (Bubu2) had characteristics of both groups; the
first two-thirds of the sequence closely matched Group
1, while the remainder matched Group 2 (Figure 2).
Sequences within Group 1 were less divergent than
those within Group 2 (Figures 2, 3; Table 1). The two
groups had similar numbers of sequences (10 in Group
1 and 12 in Group 2); however, sequences in Group 2
had 53 variable sites and differed by an average of 22.3
± 9.1 bases, whereas sequences in Group 1 had only 16
variable sites and differed by an average of 5.9 ± 3.0
bases. Group 1 and Group 2 sequences differed by an
average of 32.5 ± 4.6 bases. Busw*12, present in only
one individual, was more divergent than the other
sequences. It differed from Group 1 sequences by an

1 and 2 sequences: two were significant in Group 1
only, three in Group 2 only, and three in both. Of the
eight sites identified by CODEML as being under positive selection, six were designated by Brown et al. [28]

2 by an average of 36.4 ± 5.4 bases. Galápagos and
Swainson’s hawks did not share any sequences, and
within-group diversity was lower in the Galápagos hawk
than in the Swainson’s hawk (Table 1).
Positive selection on exon 2

We found evidence for positive selection on putative
peptide-binding codons (PBCs), with results being very
similar for PBCs identified by Brown et al. [28] and
Tong et al. [29] (Table 2). Analyzing all of the sequences
together, rates of nonsynonymous substitutions were
significantly greater than synonymous substitutions at
PBCs but not at the remaining codons. The same was
true when Swainson’s hawks were analyzed separately;
we did not analyze Galápagos hawks separately due to
the paucity of sequences. Substitution rates were higher
in Group 2 than Group 1; 93.3% of PBCs (based on
Tong et al. [29]) were polymorphic in Group 2 and only
46.7% in Group 1. We also found evidence of positive
selection using the maximum likelihood method implemented in CODEML. Both selection models (M2a, M8)
provided a better fit than their respective neutral models
(M1a, M7) for all three sequence sets tested (P < 0.001;
Table 3). The M8 models identified a total of eight sites

Neutral variability

Galápagos hawks have low diversity at microsatellite loci
as well. We found a total of 78 alleles across 17 loci in
the 185 individuals genotyped. For the seven populations, mean allelic richness varied between 1.53 and
3.29. This low variability does not appear to be the
result of a recent bottleneck. The program Bottleneck
reported a significant excess of heterozygosity in only
one (Pinta; P = 0.027) of the seven populations; however, sample sizes may have been too small to provide
statistical resolution.
Microsatellite variation was lower in Galápagos hawks
than in Swainson’s hawks. For a more direct comparison, we pooled the Galápagos hawk populations and reevaluated them using only the 13 loci that had also been
used to genotype Swainson’s hawks [25]: BswA110w,
BswA204w, BswA302w, BswA317w, BswB220w,
BswD107w, BswD122w, BswD127w, BswD210w,
BswD220w, BswD310w, BswD313w, and BswD324w.
Galápagos hawks had significantly lower mean allelic
richness, expected heterozygosity and observed heterozygosity than Swainson’s hawks (Wilcoxon signed rank
tests: Z = -3.18, p < 0.001; Table 4).

Discussion
While MHC peptide-binding genes typically display high
variability, in some cases small or bottlenecked populations are reported to exhibit reduced variation. We had
predicted that MHC class II B variability would be

lower in the endemic Galápagos hawk than in the mainland Swainson’s hawk due to a colonization event followed by ongoing genetic drift in the small island
populations. We found that Galápagos hawks had fewer,
less divergent sequences than Swainson’s hawks. A corresponding low level of neutral microsatellite variability
suggests that drift has played a strong role in shaping
MHC variation in Galápagos hawks.
Low genetic diversity in the Galápagos hawk

Galápagos hawks exhibited low MHC class II B diversity, with all 32 individuals having Buga*01 (possibly a
fixed locus) and one or both of Buga*02 and Buga*03
(possibly a second locus). Fixed loci have been reported
in other species, including an island rat [30] and bottlenecked populations of the Eurasian beaver [18]; however, in those cases populations were fixed for different
alleles. Likewise, other island populations have fewer
MHC alleles compared to a mainland relative [9,30,31].
The reduced set of alleles found in the island

populations of Eurasian kestrel [9] and Seychelles warbler [31] were just as divergent as alleles present in
mainland populations. In contrast, Buga*02 and Buga*03
differ by only one base. Exon 2 alleles typically differ by
a larger number of bases; for example, lesser kestrel
sequences differ by an average of 22.7 bases [9]. So, it is
more likely that one of these Galápagos hawk alleles
arose from the other through point mutation, than both
being retained ancestral alleles. Similarly, the endangered Galápagos penguin has only three sequences (differing by 1-3 bp) at one locus, suggesting the penguins
were once fixed for a single allele also [16]. Interestingly,
none of the Galápagos sequences was present among
the Swainson’s hawks sampled, which could be because
those sequences were rare in the ancestral population or
they mutated from ancestral sequences after
colonization.
The low genetic diversity present at neutral markers
provides strong evidence for the role of a founder event
and ongoing genetic drift within the Galápagos hawk.

Allelic richness (AR), gene diversity, and observed heterozygosity (Ho) are given. For the Galápagos hawk, we present measures from each population individually
using all 17 polymorphic loci, and then we present measures for all populations combined at the 13 loci that were also used to genotype Swainson’s hawks [34].

Allelic richness and heterozygosity at microsatellite loci
were lower in Galápagos populations than in the Swainson’s hawk population. A similar pattern of low diversity
occurs at minisatellite loci; individuals within populations share an average of 69-96% of their minisatellite
alleles [21], while an average of 20-30% is more typical
for outbred populations [32]. At the mitochondrial control region, Galápagos hawks had five haplotypes that
were on average less divergent than the 36 haplotypes in
Swainson’s hawks [27], and seven of eight populations
appear fixed for single haplotypes at almost 3 kb of
mitochondrial sequence [22].
The pattern of MHC variation in the Galápagos hawk is
likely the result of a loss of ancestral variability at the
time of colonization. The apparent fixation of Buga*01
and possible past fixation of Buga*02/03 is more consistent with an extreme bottleneck than ongoing drift. Also,
Buga*01 is present on all eight islands; the other two
sequences are each present on at least six islands, with at
least four populations having both. Minisatellite and
mitochondrial data indicate little current gene flow
among populations [21,22], so the geographic distribution of the sequences suggests that MHC variability was
reduced at or soon after foundation and that the hawks
carried the reduced set of alleles with them as they colonized the various islands. Minisatellite data also hint at
an early reduction in genetic variability because of high
background similarity across all populations [21], and
four of the populations (Pinta, Marchena, Santiago, Santa
Fe) are fixed for the same mitochondrial haplotype [22].
In addition to drift, low MHC variability in the Galápagos hawk could be attributed to relaxed selection or
purifying selection. Parasite diversity on islands may be
lower than on the mainland [33], so island populations
may experience reduced selection pressure, resulting in
less MHC variation being maintained [34]. Island kestrels that experienced lower pathogen diversity and prevalence than mainland kestrels also had lower MHC
variability [9]. Galápagos hawks harbour five ectoparasite
species and an undescribed Trypanosoma species
[26,35], but Swainson’s hawks are likely exposed to a
greater diversity of both endo- and ectoparasites. For
example, Swainson’s hawks carry five louse species [36],
while Galápagos hawks carry three. Swainson’s hawks
are migratory and should encounter different sets of
pathogens at their breeding and wintering grounds,
which has been hypothesized to lead to greater selection
for variability at the MHC [6]. Alternatively, the lack of
MHC variation could be explained by purifying selection
for alleles advantageous against a current parasite or a
past selective sweep [37]. These alternatives do not
explain the corresponding low variability at neutral markers, but they cannot be ruled out with our dataset and
could be occurring in addition to drift.

While studies have demonstrated a relationship
between MHC diversity and resistance to parasites
[38,39], the consequences of low MHC diversity remain
unclear. Low MHC diversity has been implicated in the
rapid spread of an infectious cancer that has caused
declines in Tasmanian devil populations [40]. However,
other species appear to have experienced little negative
impact, with some able to undergo population expansions [18,41] and survive thousands of years [42]. Radwan et al. [19] concluded that most bottlenecked
populations do lose MHC variation, but data demonstrating an associated population decline or extinction
are scarce, although they point out that studies are
biased toward populations that have survived past bottlenecks. In some bottlenecked populations, the remaining alleles are divergent [17,43], and it is possible that
this variation is sufficient for survival under current
environmental conditions. The introduction of novel
diseases may pose the greatest threat, as genetically uniform species may be less capable of adapting. Whiteman
et al. [26] found that smaller, more inbred (as measured
at minisatellites) Galápagos hawk populations had
higher loads of a coevolved body louse and, in general,
lower and less variable natural antibody titres than the
larger populations. This suggests that genetic variability
may indeed affect this species’ ability to mount an effective immune response.
Characterization of MHC genes

Class II B genes are prone to duplication and deletion
events [44], and gene number may vary both within and
between species [45,46]. Among birds, it appears that
two class II B genes were present before the major avian
radiations [47], and existing bird taxa range in gene
copy number from one or two [48,49] to seven or more
[50,51]. The number of sequences we recovered from
each hawk (≤ 4) suggests we amplified two loci, which is
similar to the one to two loci amplified from other accipitrid species [52]. However, we cannot be certain, so
two loci is a minimum estimate; it is possible that the
primer set we used did not amplify all exon 2 sequences
or genes actually present. A more thorough investigation
of the class II architecture of these species is needed to
determine the true number of genes.
Assignment of alleles to particular MHC class II B
genes based on exon 2 has proven difficult in birds, possibly because recent gene duplication or elevated rates of
gene conversion have resulted in higher intergenic similarity [53,54]. However, the hawk sequences exhibited
substructuring, clustering into two groups that may
represent separate genes. Group 1 was notable because
of its low sequence divergence compared to sequences
in Group 2. Other studies of avian MHC have also identified genes or clusters of sequences with low

Bollmer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:143
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/143

divergences, mostly in passerines [55] but also the Y
complex in Galliformes [56]. Some low variability genes
appear to be nonfunctional pseudogenes, having mutations that prevent transcription [57,58], while others are
nonclassical with limited expression and specialized
functions [56,59].
Because we used genomic DNA, we cannot be certain
that the hawk sequences we amplified are expressed. No
frameshift mutations or stop codons were present within
the region sequenced, and evolutionarily conserved
amino acid residues occurred at 17 of the 19 sites
thought to be functionally important for class II molecules (Figure 2; [60]). Also, an excess of nonsynonymous
substitutions was present in both groups of sequences,
which is evidence that selection has acted on these loci,
although not necessarily recently [3], and Group 2
sequences had genetic distances similar to those of
expressed sequences from classical MHC loci in other
species. More sequence data and expression analyses are
needed to better characterize these genes and to determine if the Group 1 sequences are from pseudogenes or
specialized genes. The presence of a Group 1 sequence
in the Old World common buzzard suggests that allelic
lineage predates the divergences of these Buteo species.

Conclusions
Here, we documented low MHC variability in an island
endemic, the Galápagos hawk, compared to its closest
mainland relative, the Swainson’s hawk. The corresponding loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers
(microsatellite, minisatellite, and mitochondrial loci)
suggests that a founder event at colonization followed
by ongoing drift in small populations is the primary
cause of low MHC diversity. However, purifying selection or a past selective sweep could also explain the low
number of MHC alleles present. The Galápagos hawk’s
low genetic variability may affect its ability to mount an
immune response [26] and could be cause for concern
should novel diseases reach the archipelago.
Methods
Sampling

Galápagos hawks (n = 189) were sampled from 1998 to
2003 on eight islands encompassing the entire breeding
range of the species: Española, Santa Fe, Pinzón, Santiago, Isabela, Fernandina, Marchena, and Pinta. Overwintering Swainson’s hawks (n = 20) were sampled in
2003 at a communal roost near Las Varillas, Córdoba
province, Argentina. Both radio-tracking [23] and stable
isotope [61] data show that Swainson’s hawks from different breeding populations intermix on the Argentine
wintering grounds. Therefore, it is likely that our sample
is derived from more than one breeding population;
however, our measure of Swainson’s hawk variability is

Page 8 of 12

still an underestimate of the variability present in the
species. We banded each hawk and took morphological
measurements as well as two 50 μl blood samples for
genetic analyses (see Bollmer et al. [21] and Whiteman
et al. [26] for more details).
MHC genotyping

At the MHC, we genotyped four Galápagos hawks at
class II B genes from each of the eight island populations (using unrelated adults from different territories)
for a total of 32 individuals. With this sampling, we
intended to gauge overall variability at the species level
rather than evaluate the amount of variability within
individual populations. The twenty Las Varillas Swainson’s hawks were also genotyped at the MHC. Individuals that had been used in previous population genetic
studies were preferentially chosen [21,22]. We targeted
exon 2, which codes for the peptide-binding region of
the class II B molecule and has been shown to be under
balancing selection [4]. We first amplified a 307 bp fragment (primers included) using the primers Acc2FC and
Acc2RC developed by Alcaide et al. [52] from other
diurnal raptors. Acc2FC begins in intron 1 and extends
9 bp into exon 2, whereas Acc2RC comprises bases 9
through 27 of intron 2. This PCR amplification was carried out in 40 μl reactions using 1.25X buffer, 0.25 mM
dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 μM of each primer, 1 U
Bioline Taq DNA polymerase, and 100 ng of genomic
DNA. Reaction conditions were as follows: 94°C for 4
min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 40 sec, 56°C for 40 sec,
and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension of 72°C for 5
min. We used QIAquick gel extraction kits (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA) to gel-purify the PCR products and then
cloned them using the pGEM-T easy vector cloning kit
(Promega, Madison, WI). Positive clones were
sequenced on an ABI 3100 sequencer using BigDye
chemistry (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Using
sequences aligned from Galápagos and Swainson’s
hawks, we developed a new reverse primer ButeoR (5’TTC TGG CAC RCA CTC ACC TC-3’), which overlaps
the final 3 bp of exon 2 and extends into intron 2.
We employed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) to genotype the 52 individuals. We screened
eight of these individuals using cloning as well and confirmed that genotypes from DGGE and cloning were
consistent. We amplified a 298 bp fragment (primers
included) using the primers Acc2FC and ButeoR with a
GC-clamp applied to the 5’ end of ButeoR to facilitate
separation of alleles on gels [62]. Reaction conditions
were the same as above, and PCR products were run on
8% 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels using a 25 to 35%
denaturing gradient of formamide and urea. We ran gels
for 4.5 h at 160 V at a constant temperature of 60°C,
stained them with SYBR © gold (Promega) and then

Bollmer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:143
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/143

visualized them on a Kodak IS440CF imaging system. In
order to obtain the sequences of the alleles, we cut
bands out of the gels, suspended them in 50 μl of
dH2O, re-amplified them using the Acc2FC/ButeoR primer set, and then sequenced them using those same primers. All DGGE bands were cut out and sequenced at
least once. Because spurious alleles may form when
amplifying multiple sequences in one reaction [63], we
considered sequences to be confirmed only if they were
amplified in at least two independent reactions. Confirmed sequences are available online [GenBank:
EU876805 - EU876827].
Microsatellite genotyping

We genotyped 185 individual Galápagos hawks at 22
microsatellite loci (BswA110w, BswA204w, BswA302w,
BswA303w, BswA312w, BswA317w, BswB111a2w,
BswB220w, BswD107w, BswD122w, BswD123w,
BswD127w, BswD210w, BswD220w, BswD223w,
BswD234w, BswD235w, BswD310w, BswD312w,
BswD313w, BswD324w, BswD330w) using the protocol
described in Hull et al. [64]. A subset of these loci have
been previously used in an examination of Swainson’s
hawk populations [25]. PCR fragments were size-separated on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.), and alleles were scored with STRand version
2.3.89 [65]. The 185 individuals represented seven of the
eight island populations; our sample size from Pinzón
was too small to include.
Data analysis

For the MHC data, we assembled and edited sequences
using SeqMan Pro v. 7.1 (DNASTAR, Inc.) and aligned
them in BioEdit [66]. We recovered three or more
sequences from most individuals, indicating that two or
more gene duplications were amplified. This is consistent with previous data from other accipitrid species
where one or two genes were recovered [52]. Co-amplification of multiple genes is common in studies of avian
MHC, as the high similarity of duplicated genes often
makes it difficult to amplify them individually and to
assign sequences to particular genes [8].
We calculated MHC sequence diversity measures
using 255 bp of exon 2 (the bases within the primer
region were excluded) both within and between species
in the program DnaSP v. 4.50.3 [67]. To evaluate relationships among sequences, we constructed a phylogenetic network using the program SplitsTree4 [68]. We
employed the Neighbor-Net method [69] using JukesCantor distances. As opposed to traditional phylogenetic
trees, phylogenetic networks permit visualization of conflicting signals from processes such as gene duplication
and recombination [69]. We tested for evidence of balancing selection on the peptide-binding region by

Page 9 of 12

calculating nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS)
substitution rates. A d N/dS ratio of ω = 1 is expected
under neutral evolution, ω < 1 under purifying selection,
and ω > 1 under positive selection. First, we calculated
the substitution rates using the Nei and Gojobori [70]
method with the Jukes-Cantor correction in MEGA v. 4
[71]. Rates were calculated separately for both putative
peptide-binding and non-peptide-binding codons as
assigned by Brown et al. [28] and Tong et al. [29] for
human class II molecules, and Z-tests were used in
MEGA to test for positive selection. We also tested for
positive selection using the maximum likelihood method
implemented in CODEML in the package PAML v. 4
[72,73]. With this method we did not need to make a
priori assumptions about which codons may be peptidebinding. We used a likelihood ratio test to compare
model M1a, a neutral model with two site classes (ω0 <
1, ω1 = 1), and M2a which incorporates a third site class
(ω2 > 1) allowing for positive selection [74]. Similarly,
we compared M7, a null model with a beta distribution
(0 < ω < 1), and M8, which uses a beta distribution but
also allows for positive selection [72]. The models were
compared using likelihood ratio tests. The test statistics
were calculated as two times the difference between the
likelihoods of the two models, and they were compared
to the Chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom
equal to the difference in the number of parameters for
the two models (M1a and M7 each have 2 parameters;
M2a and M8 have 4). M7 and M8 are the most robust
to the effect of recombination, which may cause false
positives [75]. Positively selected codons with a ω > 1
were identified using the Bayes empirical Bayes
approach [73].
For the microsatellite data, we tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by locus and population using a randomization test that employs the F IS statistic in FSTAT
version 2.9.3 [76]. We tested for linkage disequilibrium
between all pairs of loci within each population via randomization tests employing the log-likelihood ratio G-statistic in FSTAT. We tested for the presence of null alleles in
MICROCHECKER [77]. Bonferroni tests were used to correct for multiple comparisons. Of the 22 loci, three had
significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
in at least one population (P < 0.0003, the adjusted critical
value): BswA303w in Pinta, BswA312w in Fernandina, Isabela, and Pinta, and BswD234w in Española and Pinta. We
found evidence of linkage for three pairs of loci (P <
0.00022, the adjusted critical value): BswD312w x
BswD235w, BswA303w x BswD234w, and BswD123w x
BswD223w. To eliminate Hardy-Weinberg and linkage
issues, we removed BswA303w, BswA312w, BswD234w,
BswD235w, and BswD223w from further analyses and
used the remaining 17 loci. We found no evidence of null
alleles among these 17 loci.

We calculated microsatellite allelic richness as the
number of alleles per locus after controlling for differences in sample size using rarefaction analysis [78,79] in
FSTAT. Average gene diversity and observed heterozygosity were calculated using Arlequin v. 3.1 [80]. We
tested for evidence of a recent bottleneck (a significant
excess of heterozygosity) in each of the Galápagos hawk
island populations using the program BOTTLENECK
[81,82]. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests under the
two-phase model (TPM) of microsatellite evolution with
the stepwise mutation model (SMM) set at 70% and the
infinite alleles model (IAM) at 30%. We checked the
sensitivity of the data to the mutational model by running additional trials using multiple SMM/IAM
combinations.
