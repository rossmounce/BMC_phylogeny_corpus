Abstract
Background: Of the 20 or so signal transduction pathways that orchestrate cell-cell interactions
in metazoans, seven are involved during development. One of these is the Notch signalling pathway
which regulates cellular identity, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis via the developmental
processes of lateral inhibition and boundary induction. In light of this essential role played in
metazoan development, we surveyed a wide range of eukaryotic genomes to determine the origin
and evolution of the components and auxiliary factors that compose and modulate this pathway.
Results: We searched for 22 components of the Notch pathway in 35 different species that
represent 8 major clades of eukaryotes, performed phylogenetic analyses and compared the
domain compositions of the two fundamental molecules: the receptor Notch and its ligands Delta/
Jagged. We confirm that a Notch pathway, with true receptors and ligands is specific to the
Metazoa. This study also sheds light on the deep ancestry of a number of genes involved in this
pathway, while other members are revealed to have a more recent origin. The origin of several
components can be accounted for by the shuffling of pre-existing protein domains, or via lateral
gene transfer. In addition, certain domains have appeared de novo more recently, and can be
considered metazoan synapomorphies.
Conclusion: The Notch signalling pathway emerged in Metazoa via a diversity of molecular
mechanisms, incorporating both novel and ancient protein domains during eukaryote evolution.
Thus, a functional Notch signalling pathway was probably present in Urmetazoa.

Background
The emergence of multicellularity, considered to be one of
the major evolutionary events concerning life on Earth,
occurred several times independently during the evolution of Eukaryota in the Proterozoic geological period [1].
Multicellular organisms are not only a superimposition of
the fundamental unit of life, namely the cell; the emergence of multicellularity further implies that cells must
communicate, coordinate and organise. In Embryophyta
and Metazoa, higher levels of differentiation and organization of cells resulted in the emergence of organs and
their organisation into complex body plans. Reaching this
critical step required the elaboration of sophisticated
intercellular communication mechanisms [2,3]. Cell-cell
interactions through signal transduction pathways are
therefore crucial for the development and the evolution of
multicellular organisms. The modifications of these signal
transduction pathways explain the macroevolution process observed. In metazoans, fewer than 20 different signal
transduction pathways are required to generate the
observed high diversity of cell types, patterns and tissues
[4]. Among them, only seven control most of the cell communications that occur during animal development: Wnt;
Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β); Hedgehog;
Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK); Jak/STAT; nuclear hormone receptor; and Notch [5,6]. These pathways are used
throughout development in many and various metazoans
to establish polarity and body axes, coordinate pattern
formation and choreograph morphogenesis [4]. The common outcome to all of these pathways is that they act, at
least in part, through the regulation of the transcription of
specific target genes by signal-dependent transcription
factors [6].
The Notch signalling pathway is a major direct paracrine
signalling system and is involved in the control of cell
identity, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in
various animals (reviewed in [7-12]). Notch signalling is
used iteratively in many developmental events and its
diverse functions can be categorized into two main
modalities "lateral inhibition" and "boundaries/inductive
mechanisms" [8,13]. During lateral inhibition, Notch signalling has mainly a permissive function and contributes
to binary cell fate choices in populations of developmentally equivalent cells, by inhibiting one of the fates in
some cells and therefore allowing them to later adopt an
alternative one. Lateral inhibition is a key patterning process that often results in the regular spacing of different cell
types within a field. The Notch pathway may also have
more instructive roles, whereby signalling between neighbouring populations of different cells and induces the
adoption of a third cell fate at their border, establishing a
developmental boundary [14,15].
A large number of studies, mainly conducted on Drosophila, Caenorhabditis and vertebrates, have characterized

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

the molecular properties and functions of the main components and auxiliary factors of the Notch pathway. These
are strongly conserved in bilaterians (Figure 1 modified
from [16]). Both the Notch receptor and its ligands (Delta
or Jagged/Serrate also known as DSL proteins) are type I
transmembrane proteins with a modular architecture. In
eumetazoans, the Notch protein is classically considered
to be composed of an extracellular domain (NECD) that
comprises several EGF and LNR motifs, an intracellular
domain (NICD) that includes ANK domains and a PEST
region [7,8,17,18]. The Notch protein is synthesized as an
inactive precursor that has to be cleaved three times and
to undergo various post-translational modifications to
become active [19-22]. In the Golgi apparatus, the first
cleavage (S1) is done by the Furin protease resulting in
two fragments (NICD and NECD) that subsequently
undergo O-fucosylation (by O-Fucosyltransferase) and
glycosylation (by Fringe). Upon ligand binding, the second cleavage (S2) occurs by the metalloproteases ADAM
10 and 17 [19-21]. The final cleavage (S3) is performed by
the γ-secretase complex (Presenilin-Nicastrin-APH1PEN2). These cleavages result in the release, upon ligand
binding, of NICD into the cytoplasm and its subsequent
translocation to the nucleus. There, NICD interacts with
the CSL (CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1)/Ncor/SMRT/Histone
Deacetylase (HDAC) transcriptional complex and recruits
the coactivator Mastermind and a Histone Acetylase
(HAC), thus activating the transcription of target genes in
particular the HES/E(Spl) genes (Hairy/Enhancer of Split)
[9].
In addition to these core components of the Notch pathway, several other proteins are used to regulate Notch signalling in some cellular contexts, and act either on the
receptor Notch or on the ligand DSL (Figure 1). Some of
these regulators modulate the amount of receptor available for signalling [23]. Numb, the NEDD4/Su(dx) E3
ubiquitin ligases, and Notchless are important negative
regulators, while Deltex is considered to antagonize
NEDD4/Su(dx) and therefore to be an activator of Notch
signalling [24,25]. Strawberry Notch (Sno), another modulator of the pathway whose role is still unclear, seems to
be active downstream and disrupts the CSLrepression
complex [26]. Regulation may also occur at the level of
ligand activity via the E3 ubiquitin ligases Neuralized and
Mindbomb [27,28].
Most of what we know about the Notch signalling pathway comes from studies conducted on a few bilaterian
species. Recently, studies have shown the existence of a
Notch signalling pathway in non-bilaterian species, such
as the cnidarian Hydra and the sponge Amphimedon, and
its putative functions in the former species [29,30]. However, the ancestral structure, functionality and emergence
of this complex multi-component signalling system are
still open questions. Few studies have been initiated to

Major components and auxiliary factors of the Notch signalling pathway as described in Bilateria (modified from [16])

from [16]). Most of the mentioned components are studied hereafter. S1 to S3 represent the cleavage sites. See Table 1 for

understand how signalling pathways appeared and
evolved beyond the Bilateria [4-6] but the recent sequencing of the first sponge genome, Amphimedon queenslandica
has opened new perspectives for studying the origin and
evolution of signalling pathways in the Metazoa [31-35].
With the goal of illuminating the early evolution of the
Notch pathway, we have therefore undertaken a comparative genomic study of the components of this pathway
across the Eukaryota. Our study encompasses 35 species
(31 with fully sequenced genomes) covering the 8 major
clades of eukaryotes [36] (Figure 2), and includes the 22
main components of the Notch pathway (Table 1). We
have also paid special attention to the evolution of
domain composition (within the Metazoa) of the multidomain proteins Notch, Delta, Mindbomb, Su(H) and
Furin, to investigate whether domain shuffling has
occurred during their evolution, as in other signalling
pathways [31,37].
This wide genomic comparison reveals that most of the
Notch components are present in all the metazoan species

studied, including putative basal metazoans such as
sponges and placozoan, suggesting that a functional
Notch pathway was already present in the last common
ancestor of present-day metazoans and was subsequently
strongly conserved during metazoan evolution. While
many of the Notch pathway components are also shared
with non-metazoan eukaryote lineages, thus suggesting a
more ancient origin, nine of the components are metazoan-specific, including the Notch receptor and the DSL
ligands. This indicates that while the Notch pathway is a
metazoan synapomorphy, it has been assembled through
the co-option of pre-metazoan proteins, and their integration with novel metazoan-specific molecules acquired by
various evolutionary mechanisms.

(EST) data of 35 different eukaryote species (Figure 2).
Table 1 lists the 22 genes that we analysed and summarizes their functions in the Notch pathway (see also Figure
1). We included in this list both genes that encode core
components of the Notch pathways (such as receptor, ligands, and molecules involved in receptor processing) and
genes that encode modulators of the pathway not used in
all cases of Notch signalling (such as Numb and Notchless)
[23]. We selected 35 species representative of the major
clades of eukaryotes [36]: 18 metazoans, 4 fungi (including one microsporidia), 1 choanoflagellate, 2 amoebozoans, 2 species of plants (one embryophyta and one
volvocale), 2 alveolates, 2 heterokonts, 2 species of discicristates, 1 species of excavates and 1 rhizaria. Figure 2 provides the full list of the chosen species with their assumed
phylogenetic position and internet links to the genomic
databases.

We performed BLAST searches [38] to assess the presence
or absence of Notch pathway genes in the sampled species, as described in the methods section. In most cases,
the Notch pathway elements are multidomain proteins
and share some of their domains with other proteins. For
each target protein, only the combined occurrence of all
requisite domains was considered diagnostic for identification. We systematically defined a diagnostic domain
organization for each target protein (Table 2) and identified genes as detailed in the methods section. We also constructed multiple alignments for each protein and
performed phylogenetic analyses to confirm the orthology relationships (Additional files 1 and 2). Figure 3 summarizes the output of our analyses: genes were scored as
"present" when all the domains were identified, "incomplete" when some domains were missing, or "absent"
when blast searches gave no significant result. For EST
libraries, as the absence and the incomplete status of
genes cannot be definitive due to the partial nature of this

type of data, we chose to indicate "present" only when all
domains were retrieved. Detailed domain composition
for each gene in each species is presented in the Additional file 3.
Our data confirm the strong evolutionary conservation of
the Notch pathway in bilaterians as all components are
present in almost all the analysed bilaterian species (Figure 3). There are two exceptions to this rule, Fringe which
is absent from the genome of two protostomes,
Caenorhabditis and Helobdella, and Mastermind is not
found in 5 of the studied bilaterian species across both
protostomes and deuterostomes. The latter case is puzzling given the documented importance of Mastermind in
both vertebrates and Drosophila [39,40] and its presence
in the non-bilaterian species Nematostella (Figure 3). This
suggests that Mastermind has been repeatedly lost in various bilaterian species. Alternatively, as the sequence sim-

ilarity between the Mastermind genes in Drosophila and
vertebrates is quite weak [41], these genes may be difficult
to track by sequence similarity searches. Our data also
indicate that the overall Notch pathway conservation
extends to non-bilaterian species. Indeed, most pathway
components can be identified in the cnidarians Nematostella and Hydra, in the placozoan Trichoplax and the
sponge Amphimedon (Figure 3). We can therefore conclude that most Notch pathway components were already
present in the last common ancestor of all metazoans, the
Urmetazoa.
Four genes were not found complete outside bilaterians,
SMRT, Furin, Numb and Neuralized, suggesting that these
genes are specific to bilaterians (Figure 3). Genes encoding proteins with a SANT domain (which is found in bilaterian SMRT) are found in non-bilaterians, but the
sequence similarity is too weak to establish that some are

bona fide SMRT genes. The case of the Furin protein is puzzling. This protein pertains to the proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin family (PCSK) [42]. In the demosponge
Amphimedon and the choanoflagellate, there are some proteins of the PCSK family and some of them possess the
diagnostic domains of the Furin proteins (data not
shown). Nevertheless, the phylogenetic analysis revealed
that these proteins do not group with bilaterian Furins,
however the latter are paraphyletic in the phylogenetic
tree (Additional file 2). In the case of Neuralized, while
Neuz domains are found in non-bilaterians, they are only

found in association with a RING binding domain in the
Bilateria. In the same way, Ph-like domains of Numb are
only found in association with a NumbF domain in bilaterians. The gene Mastermind is only found in eumetazoans and two others, Fringe and Mindbomb, are found in
Amphimedon but not in Trichoplax (Figure 3).
The absence of some components in some non-bilaterian
species may represent a progressive elaboration of the
pathway during early metazoan evolution, or else may
correspond to secondary losses in some lineages. How-

ever, these data can be difficult to interpret in terms of the
evolution of the Notch pathway, as the phylogenetic relationships of the aforementioned non-bilaterian species
are still controversial [43-45]. Nevertheless, we decided to
base our discussion on the metazoan relationships
hypothesised in the most recent phylogenomic study [46]
as we believe it to be the most robust and complete analysis to date.
Our data so far indicate that most of the Notch pathway
components were already present in Urmetazoa. Interestingly, among the 22 targeted genes, only nine are specific
to metazoans (Notch, Delta, Furin, Mastermind, Numb,
Neuralized, Mindbomb, HES and SMRT). Strikingly, among
these, nine are the genes encoding the ligand and the
receptor, suggesting that the canonical Notch pathway
only exists in metazoans. Indeed, in the genome of the
choanoflagellate Monosiga, no Notch gene has been
found, only cassettes of some protein domains encoded
on separate genes have been reported [47]. Of note, we
also found another gene in this species that possesses the
domain arrangement of a Notch gene (1 signal peptide, 1
EGF domain, 2 LNR domains, a transmembrane domain
and 3 ANK domains, Additional file 4). While this gene
contains the minimum set of diagnostic Notch domains,
it has very weak sequence similarity to Notch genes, and in
the absence of further evidence we choose here to name it
"Notch-like". Nevertheless, we can not exclude that a "protoNotch" receptor might have been already present in
Holozoa.
13 components are found in various other eukaryote taxa;
some are likely to have appeared during early eukaryote

evolution and may even have been present in the last
common ancestor of present-day eukaryotes (LECA). Others seem to have specifically appeared in the opisthokont
lineage. Figure 4 represents the possible scenarios of emergence and loss of the various Notch components, inferred
from the most recent and robust phylogenetic hypotheses
[45,46] and on the basis of the parsimony principle. Four
genes of this pathway seem to have appeared early in evolution and are inferred to have been present in the LECA.
These include Notchless (Nle) and three of the four genes
coding for proteins implicated in the so-called "γ-secretase
complex". Indeed, the Presenilin gene is shared by all
eukaryotes (except Fungi + microsporidies and alveolates)
whereas Nicastrin and APH1 are found in the Holozoa, the
Amoebozoa, the Plantae and the Heterokonta. Interestingly, none of these genes are found in species of Fungi +
Microsporidia and Alveolata, suggesting a secondary loss.
For other genes (3) that are shared by fewer taxa, it is difficult to state whether they were present in the LECA and
lost various times, or acquired independently: this is the
case for PEN2, Strawberry Notch (Sno), the role of which in
the Notch pathway is not yet clear, and Fringe (a Fringelike gene is present in plants and Excavata). All other
genes originated more recently, in the last common ancestor of opisthokonts (Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H))[48];
Suppressor of Deltex (NEDD4/Su(dx)). This might also be
the case for the two Adam genes. We cannot confidently
assign the Adam genes we found in Fungi and Microsporidia to a particular Adam group; however these genes
are most closely related to metazoan Adam 10 and 17
families (see Additional file 2) as already reported by
another study on Aspergillus fumigatus [49]. Other genes
are specific to holozoans (O-Fut; Deltex).

For the ctenophore species (Mnemiopsis and Pleurobrachia)
as well as the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella, only a
few target genes were identified in the available non
exhaustive EST databases and we were unable to conclude
whether or not the remaining genes are present in those
taxa.
Focus on Notch and DSL proteins evolution in metazoan:
phylogenetic analyses and domain composition
arrangement
We chose to focus our further analyses on the two main
molecules of the pathway, Notch and DSL, and study their
evolution in metazoans. We first performed phylogenetic
analyses using both Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) approaches and then investigated the
domain organizations of each. Topologies obtained in
our phylogenetic analyses are not fully resolved, as previously noticed for the Notch ligands [50-52]. Long branch
attraction bias (LBA) may be suspected in some cases and,

as previously reported by different authors [53,54], ML
appears more sensitive to LBA than BI. Concerning
domain composition and organization, generally all the
diagnostic domains in Delta or Notch genes are present in
bilaterian sequences, but some domains seem to be lacking in a few species. In these cases, we can not state
whether this is due to prediction errors, sequencing gaps
in the available genome sequences or secondary losses.
When the available software prediction is equivocal,
important conserved residues can often be identified in
the regions where domains would be expected, suggesting
functional conservation. Despite these technical limits,
our analysis presents several features of interest.
First, a single Notch gene is found in most species (Figure
5, Additional file 5), except in vertebrates (from 2 to 4
genes) and in the annelid Helobdella (2 genes). In the
former case, this is most probably due to the well documented occurrence of two whole genome duplication

Page 8 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:249

events in this lineage [55]. In the latter case, it may correspond to a recent duplication, limited to an annelid lineage. Indeed, the two Helobdella genes form a
monophyletic group in our trees (Figure 5, Additional file
5) and only a single Notch gene has been found in the
genome of another annelid species, Capitella sp. I [56]. In
the Bayesian analysis, we note that the sequences from
bilaterians form a monophyletic group and the cnidarian
sequence clearly appears more related to bilaterian
sequences than to other non-bilaterian sequences (PP:
0.99). The receptor Notch is considered to be made of several domains: EGF repeats (Epidermal Growth factor:
about 30 to 40 amino acids, containing six conserved
cysteines), three LNR (lin-notch repeat) or Notch
domains, two enigmatic domains NOD and NODP (their
roles are unknown), a RAM 23 domain, a PEST domain
and several Ankyrin repeats (Figure 6). The number of
EGFs is variable and spans from 10 in Caenorhabditis to 36
in humans. The NOD and the NODP are absent in
sponges and in some bilaterian species. The absence of a
signal peptide is observed in 8 of the 25 sequences, and
the PEST domain is absent at the C-terminus of three
sequences (Figure 6).
Second, in the DSL family (Figure 7, Additional file 6) Jagged is absent from placozoans and sponges and present (1
to 4 copies) in all other studied metazoans. Delta is
present in all metazoan species of our study, and in contrast to Jagged, is also found in non-eumetazoans. The
number of copies of Delta is also variable but is notably
high (7 copies) in the gastropod snail Lottia. We also note
that 5 copies are present in the sponge genome, which is
remarkably high in comparison to the other non-bilaterians such as Trichoplax and Nematostella. In spite of the
differences between the ML and BI topologies and the
weak statistical support of deep nodes in both analyses,
we are able to draw some conclusions about the evolution
of the DSL family. In the Bayesian tree (with better resolution), a strongly supported clade (PP: 0.99) contains all
eumetazoan Jagged sequences plus one sequence from
Branchiostoma and one from the sponge Oscarella (not
supported by the ML tree; Additional file 6). This suggests
the existence of a subfamily of Serrate/Jagged proteins that
is found in all the major animal lineages and therefore is
of ancient origin. Most of the other studied proteins (32
out of 35 remaining sequences) form another large monophyletic group (although of weak support, PP: 0.55) likely
corresponding to what may be called a Delta clade (Figure
7) since it includes the known Deltas from vertebrates as
well as from the main metazoan lineages, including the
sponge Amphimedon and the placozoan Trichoplax. Nevertheless, the internal branching of the Delta sequences
makes no sense in the light of species phylogenies. Our
phylogenetic analysis rather suggests that the last common ancestor of all eumetazoans already possessed at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

least one Delta and one Jagged/Serrate gene and that the
Urmetazoa possessed at least one sequence of Delta. The
position of the of D/J-Oscarella carmela in the Bayesian
tree is puzzling, the BLAST analysis revealed a higher similarity between this sponge (unfortunately incomplete)
sequence and Delta sequences but we cannot definitively
rule out the possibility that it might be an incomplete Jagged protein.
To support our phylogenetic analyses, we also systematically investigated the domain arrangements of the DSL
family proteins (Figures 8, 9). DSL proteins are usually
considered to be composed of several domains, namely a
signal peptide (secretion signal), a MNLL domain (a conserved region at the N terminus), a DSL domain (DeltaSerrate-Lag-2: about 50 amino acids, containing six conserved cysteines and a YYG motif), a variable number of
EGF repeats and a transmembrane region. In addition to
these domains, the Serrate/Jagged proteins also contain a
supplementary domain, the Von Willebrand factor C
domain (VWC) [57]. Interestingly, all but two proteins
included in the Jagged group in our phylogenetic trees
contain the VWC domain, confirming that they are bona
fide Jagged proteins (Figure 9). The exceptions are the two
Branchiostoma genes; phylogenetic analyses highly support their belonging to the Jagged clade, suggesting that
the absence of the VWC domain may be due to incorrect
protein predictions, incomplete genome assemblage or
secondary loss.
Third, in our ligand domain analyses (Figures 8, 9), we
found that the MNLL, the signal peptide and the transmembrane domains are not present (or detected) across
all metazoan Delta ligands but we could find them in the
majority of Jaggeds. Most deuterostome Delta sequences
possess the MNLL domain, in contrast to the protostome
sequences. Among the sponge species a MNLL is only predicted in one copy of the Amphimedon Deltas. The number
of EGF repeats ranges from 0 (in the sponge Amphimedon)
to 75 in Delta and from 12 to 18 in Jagged. An average of
7-8 EGF motifs are present in deuterostome Delta
sequences; it is much more variable in protostomes. We
note that motifs expected at the N or C terminus are more
often lacking. As this absence of a signal peptide or a
transmembrane region appears incongruous and hardly
compatible with the conservation of functionality, the
assembly and annotation of the concerned genomes may
require a re-examination [58].
Surprisingly, in cnidarian genomes, in addition to the
Delta and Jagged sequences, we found genes composed
only of DSL domains (from 1 to 11 repeats) and one gene
composed of a MNLL domain associated to 3 DSL
domains (Additional file 7). It remains to be seen either

Origin and evolution of protein domains involved in the
pathway
We focused on five genes that encode multidomain proteins in the pathway: DSL, Notch, Mindbomb, Su(H),
Furin. We mapped the possible acquisition(s) and loss

events of the different domains during eukaryote evolution according to the phylogenetic hypothesis of Baldauf
(2003) [36] (Figures 10, 11, 12).
On one hand, it appears that various domains have an
ancient origin; they are shared by several eukaryote lineages, so we can hypothesize their presence in the LECA (or
in the ancestor of eukaryotes bearing mitochondria: all

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:249

eukaryotes except discicristates and excavates). This is the
case for: EGF repeats of Notch and DSL (only present in
eukaryotes [59]), ANK repeats of Mindbomb and Notch
(present in eukaryotes, Archaea and Bacteria); the LNR
domain of Notch; both ZZ and Ring type ZN finger
domains of Mindbomb; the IPT RBP-JKappa domain of
Su(H); the Subtilisin domain and the Furin domain. In all
of these cases, a hypothesis of ancestrality followed by one
or more secondary losses is most parsimonious.
On the other hand, several domains appear to have originated more recently since they are specific to opisthokonts
or even to metazoans: the MNLL, DSL and VWC domains
involved in DSL composition; the NOD and NODP
domains of Notch; the Mib/Herc2 domain of Mindbomb;
the Lag1 and Beta-trefoil domains of Su(H). Thus, a total
of six domains may represent synapomorphies of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

Metazoa. In the case of the P-proprotein of Furin, the
more parsimonious inference is that it may have appeared
convergently three times in Excavata, Heterokonta and in
Opistokonta (with a secondary loss in Microsporidia).

Discussion
A functional Notch pathway seems to have been present
in the Urmetazoa and comprised at least 17 components
[30]. The later addition of five other components (in
Eumetazoa or Bilateria) can thus be considered as facultative and responsible for additional regulation properties
of the pathway. Our study indicates that the presence of
the Notch pathway is a synapomorphy of metazoans as
this is the only kingdom to possess all the key components of the pathway, most importantly the receptor and
ligands. Our analysis also sheds light on the molecular
mechanisms that may have been invoked in the forma-

tion of this pathway. Indeed, as we discuss hereafter, our
study shows that Notch signalling has originated by cooption of pan-eukaryotic ancestral genes; modification of
ancestral functions by new protein-protein interactions
(mediated by novel metazoan domains); lateral gene
transfer; formation of new proteins by both exon shuffling and duplications + divergence.
Cooption of pre-existing genes and ancestral functions
This study, at the scale of the Eukaryota super-kingdom,
reveals the presence of Notch components in diverse
eukaryotic organisms, and thus their ancient origin. Certain highly conserved genes, despite their ancestrality,
seem to be absent in Fungi and Microsporidia. This is consistent with previous genomic analyses that have documented massive gene losses in the LCA of Fungi +
Microsporidia, and a further round of losses in microsporidies in relation to their parasitic life style [60,61].

The origin of Presenilin and of the γ-secretase complex
One of the most striking features uncovered by our study
is the evolutionary conservation of the γ-secretase complex [22,62]: the four proteins composing this large transmembrane complex (Nicastrin, APH1, PEN2 and
Presenilin [63,64]) are present in both plants and
unikonts (except in Fungi + Microsporidia). While the
entire γ-secretase complex does not seem to be paneukaryotic, our analysis nonetheless supports an altered
evolutionary scenario than that formerly proposed for its
main player, Presenilin. Previously, authors have hypothesized (based on an early view of the tree of life) a convergent acquisition of this gene in the metazoan and the
plant lineages [65]. Our study reveals instead that Presenilin was present in the LECA, and then lost independently
twice (in the LCA of Fungi + Microsporidia and in Alveolata). The APH1 and Nicastrin proteins may also be ancestral to Eukaryota, but our data is inconclusive for PEN2 on
this point (found only in Unikonta and Plantae). Until
now, functional analyses of this complex are available

only in Embryophyta [66] and Metazoa, where it is
known to be involved in the cleavage of Notch and other
proteins such as ErbB4 [67] and APP (amyloid precursor
protein, implicated in Alzheimers disease [68]). But the
lack of evidence for a complete γ-secretase complex in the
LECA (because of the possible later emergence of PEN2)
parallels recent functional data indicating that in both
mammals [69] and a bryophyte (Physcomitrella patens
[66]), Presenilin is also involved in various γ-secretaseindependent functions such as protein degradation and
trafficking. The association of PEN2 (present either in the
LCA of unikonts and plants or acquired independently in
these two lineages) is considered to be necessary to
acquire the proteolytic activity of Presenilin via conformational changes [70]. These changes may result in the accessibility of the two catalytic motifs Y/WD and GXGD,
which are conserved at the eukaryotic scale [71]. This suggests that proteolysis might not have been the ancestral
function of Presenilin (alone or in association with Nicas-

trin [66]), but might have been acquired secondarily by its
co-option into the four protein γ-secretase complex
(including PEN2). This challenging evolutionary scenario
requires further investigations to be tested.
The origin of the Notchless inhibitor
Notchless encodes a protein containing a NLE domain and
WD40-repeats [72]. In Eumetazoa, this member of the
WD-repeat (WDR) protein superfamily [73,74] modulates the Notch pathway by binding the NICD [75] but
also by interacting with Deltex and Su(H) [72]. Our analysis shows that Notchless was probably present in LECA.
Nevertheless, in some of the studied species, the NLE
domain is missing, and we cannot define whether this is
due to secondary loss or to a high level of sequence divergence obscuring domain prediction. The high conservation of NLE sequences seems to be compatible with
functional conservation as shown by transgenic experiments between a plant, Solanum chacoense and an animal,

Page 17 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:249

Drosophila [76,77]. However, while both plant and yeast
Notchless proteins share an involvement in ribosome biogenesis, until now no such role has been reported in animals [78]. These observations have led authors to propose
that either Notchless was primarily involved in ribosome
biogenesis in eukaryotes and was secondarily recruited in
the metazoans for a new function (regulator of Notch
pathway), or that this role may still exist in animals
despite the lack of experimental evidence [79].
Ancestrality or lateral gene transfer?
Two other members of the Notch pathway show an
ambiguous history, in which the eventuality of lateral
gene transfer (LGT) cannot be excluded. This is the case
for both Fringe [80] and Strawberry Notch (Sno). Our analyses reveal that Fringe is present in Metazoa, but also in
plants and parabasalia (Trichomonas). A fringe domain
alone was also identified in the studied Ascomyceta species; however no complete Fringe or Fringe-like gene seems
to be present in this taxon (data not shown). We could
hypothesize that the Fringe gene was present in the LECA
and then lost several times; nevertheless, the most parsimonious scenario suggests three independent acquisitions. We can speculate that LGT might have occurred,
favoured by either the tight association existing between
Parabasalia and Metazoa lineages or via bacterial transfers
[81]. However, we failed to find any specific relationships
or signatures (Additional file 2) between the Fringe genes
of Homo and its parasite Trichomonas as well as we failed
to detect Fringe outside Eukaryota to strongly argue for a
LGT hypothesis.

In our analysis, Sno is shown to be present in Holozoa and
Plantae. Unexpectedly, Sno has been reported recently in
a nuclear and cytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) of
the haptophyte (taxon related to Heterokonta [36]) Emiliania huxleyi [82]. As our analysis on the genomes of the
two chosen heterokonts (Phytophthora sojae and ramorum)
failed to reveal the presence of Sno, we chose to extend our
research to other heterokonta related species. Interestingly, Sno is not only present in the genome of the haptophyte Emiliania, suggesting a LGT between this species
and its virus EHV (Emiliania huxleyi virus), but also in two
other heterokonta, Aureococcus anophaegefferens and Thalassiosina pseudonana (Additional file 8). Another interesting feature is that Sno has been shown to be derived from
the SNF2/SWI2 ATPases encoding gene of α-proteobacteria [83]. The presence of Sno or Sno-related genes in both
NCLDV and α-proteobacteria may suggest LGT events in
the history of these genes because i) α-proteobacteria are
often found in tight associations with various eukaryote
taxa (e.g: Wolbachia/Metazoa; nodosities of Fabaceae
plants) and ii) NCLDVs have been reported from Amoebozoa, Haptophyta, Discicristata and Viridiplantae however their ecological distribution and importance is still

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

largely unknown and newly described virophage of
NCLDVs may also be involved in LGT [82-84].
In the two cases (Fringe and Sno), further analyses (on
more species) are needed to shed light on the origin and
history of these genes and to state whether they were
acquired by LGT or not.
The Notch pathway is specific to Metazoa
The cooption or acquisition (by LGT) of "old" genes is not
sufficient to explain the formation of the canonical Notch
pathway. One of the pivotal steps in the evolutionary history of the Notch pathway seems to be the transition
between the choanoflagellates and the animals [85].
Indeed, this study reveals that the majority of Notch components appeared in the LCA of the Holozoa. Nevertheless, several molecular components critical for signal
transduction are lacking in choanoflagellates, in particular, the ligand Delta and the receptor Notch (although we
found a gene that possesses a domain arrangement similar
to that of the metazoan Notch genes, it has very weak
sequence similarity to these genes), thus we consider the
Notch pathway as a synapomorphy of the Metazoa (this
study, [47]).

An increase in the complexity of this pathway has also
occurred after the divergence between sponges and other
metazoans. Several Notch components are absent from
the demosponge Amphimedon (Furin, Mastermind, SMRT,
Numb and Neuralized), yet the pathway may still be functional in this species [30]. This suggests that these components were not critical for the function of the pathway and
may constitute additional regulatory elements that were
subsequently added to the pathway in eumetazoans. Nevertheless, the possible pan-metazoan ancestry of these
genes (and their subsequent loss in Amphimedon) cannot
be excluded; data from other sponges may help to resolve
this issue.
The absence of Furin in Amphimedon is not really unexpected; although Furin has a critical role for the maturation of the receptor Notch in vertebrates, it has been
shown in Drosophila that Furin is not essential for Notch
signalling. Indeed, the Notch receptor can still be trafficked to the membrane without this initial cleavage [86].
Furin belongs to the PCSK superfamily which contains
diverse families of proteases. Several PCSK proteins are
present in Amphimedon although none seem to be bona
fide Furins (as they do not group with bilaterian Furin in
the phylogenetic tree; additional file 2). Nevertheless, we
cannot exclude the possibility that one of these PCSKs
may perform the S1 cleavage in the Amphimedon Notch
pathway instead of Furin. Indeed, all PCSKs share the
same canonical cleavage site R-X-R/K-R and (presently
scarce) available functional data suggest that some of

Page 18 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:249

them may play similar roles in different cellular lineages
[87].
The absence of a complete Neuralized in non-bilaterians
is not incompatible with a functional pathway, due to the
functional redundancy of Neuralized and Mindbomb
[88]: the latter being present in non-bilaterians. Indeed,
these two components are both E3 ubiquitin ligases
involved in ligand endocytosis and regulation
[27,28,89]via ubiquitylation [90], and were shown to be
able to rescue each other in Drosophila [91,92]. A functional study of the Notch pathway in Placozoa, which
lacks both a complete Neuralized and Mindbomb, would
allow a better understanding of the effects of the absence
of E3 ubiquitin ligase regulation.
Regarding the inhibitor Numb, it inhibits Notch via endocytosis and regulates cell fate acquisition by asymmetric
cell division or by lineage decision processes [93-95].
Functional studies in sponges would be necessary to state
whether another protein replaces Numb function. Nonetheless, it appears that the mechanism of Numb-mediated
asymmetric cell fate acquisition is a synapomorphy of
Notch pathway activity in Bilateria.
The co-activator Mastermind (MAM) is classically considered an integral part of the co-activation complex. Its non
critical nature is highly unexpected and its absence from
the demosponge species, as well as several bilaterian species, is puzzling. The high sequence divergence of the
MAM proteins in bilaterians (MAM proteins share little
sequence similarity apart from the N-terminal region [23],
the region which interacts with Su(H) and NICD [96])
could make searching for them by sequence similarity
alone inconclusive. Alternatively, these proteins may have
been secondarily lost in several species, indicating that
MAM proteins may be facultative for pathway function or
replaceable by other proteins. In the absence of functional
data on species that apparently lack MAM, we cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses.
Recent acquisition of new functions: intervention of
domain shuffling
It is clear from our data that novelty arose either in the
LCA of Holozoa or in the metazoan stem lineage, which
resulted in the assembly of disparate components into the
functional Notch signal transduction pathway in animals.
Our study further enables us to partly understand the
molecular evolutionary mechanisms that may have facilitated these events.

Hereafter, we focus on the origin of the two main players,
the receptor Notch and the ligands Delta-Jagged, all of
which are metazoan specific multidomain proteins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

The origin and evolution of Notch
In the light of the recent data concerning sponges [30] and
the present study, we can infer that Notch is a synapomorphy of Metazoa and consists of 3 core protein domains:
EGF, ANK and LNR. Interestingly, these 3 domains exist in
all eukaryotes. Proteins composed of EGF domains, LNR
domains or ANK domains have been reported on separate
chromosomes in M. brevicollis [47]. It has been proposed
that the presence of these domains in separate Monosiga
proteins suggests that Notch is the result of a new recombination of existing domains, known as exon or domain
shuffling [97,98]. Data concerning the role of the LNR
domains also found in the pregnancy associated plasma
protein A (PAPP-A) are too scarce to infer the ancestral
function of this domain [99]. The only common feature
that we can note between the LNR domains of Notch and
PAPP-A is a calcium binding capability [100]. In contrast,
EGF and ANK are modular protein subunits, that are very
common in eukaryote proteins and that are known to be
involved in protein-protein interactions [101]. The ANK
repeat is one of the most common protein-protein interaction motifs in living beings [102,103]. It has been primarily reported in eukaryotes, although examples from
prokaryotes and viruses are also known and may be the
result of lateral gene transfer [104]. ANK domains are not
only part of the composition of Notch (3 to 5 ANK
repeats) but also of Mindbomb (1 to 6). The ANK repeat
is a relatively well conserved motif with strongly conserved residues (a Thr-Pro-Leu-His tetrapeptide motif and
Val/Ile-Val-X-Leu/Val-Leu-Leu motif) and 2 α-helices
[103]. We note that the Mindbomb ANK motifs are less
well conserved than the Notch ANKs, suggesting that the
structural integrity of the ANK motifs of Mindbomb are
less constrained than in Notch. ANK motifs in Notch have
a crucial role; they are involved in the assembly and stability of the complex with Su(H) and Mastermind [105,106].
When ANKs are deleted, the Notch signalling pathway is
not functional in mice [105]. Mindbomb ANK repeats are
important for the Delta internalization process but are not
necessary for Delta ubiquitination [107]. As already mentioned, Mindbomb can be functionally replaced by Neuralized; this flexibility may have led to weaker
evolutionary constraints on the Mindbomb ANK repeats
than on those of Notch.

The two enigmatic domains NOD and NODP, the roles of
which are still unknown, seem to be an innovation of
Eumetazoa. Our analysis does not allow us to infer the
process by which they appeared.
The origin of DSL proteins: Delta and Jagged
Notch has two possible ligands encoded by the two paralogous genes Delta and Jagged. Our analyses show that
Delta was ancestrally present in Metazoa, while a complete Jagged is absent from Placozoa and Porifera. Phylo-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:249

genetic analyses of the ligands do not provide conclusive
results. As already mentioned, we can envisage that the
ligands are evolving in a rapid and divergent way in each
lineage, and this could cause the loss of ancient phylogenetic signals.
Experimental data suggest that Delta and Jagged may be
complementary, functionally interchangeable or antagonistic [108,109]. They share two protein domains, MNLL
and DSL, associated with the EGF repeats that they have in
common with Notch, and are directly involved in receptor/ligands interactions. While EGF repeats represent an
ancient domain, as previously discussed, MNLL and DSL
domains are absent outside Metazoa. Their origin cannot
be clarified by our study. Nevertheless, we may speculate
that the DSL domain shares ancestry with the LNR
domains of the Notch receptor. Indeed, comparison of
cysteine patterns from these two domains revealed that,
for 4 of the 6 cysteines, positions and spacing are conserved.
Despite the common characteristics of Delta and Jagged,
they differ by two main features: i) a VWC domain present
in Jagged and absent in Delta, the function of which is not
clear but it may be involved in protein complex formation; ii) the number and spacing of EGF repeats differ
between Delta and Jagged (an average of 7 and 14 respectively). Nevertheless, no correlation between the number
of EGF repeats in the ligand and the affinity to the Notch
receptor has been reported. Instead, Notch ligand choice
is modulated by other proteins such as Fringe and O-fucosyltransferase that modify Notch EGF residues [110].
It is worth noting that the sponges and the placozoan possess complete Delta genes (with or without MNLL
domains) but Jagged genes seem to be absent. Nevertheless, in the case of the sponges (Amphimedon and
Oscarella) and of Trichoplax, the VWC domain, (the specific domain of Jagged) is indeed present in the genomes,
but it is never found in association with a DSL domain
(data not shown). Intriguingly though, in Trichoplax, the
VWC domain is found in association with EGF domains
(7). These observations lead us to propose two possible
evolutionary scenarios for the Notch ligands (Figure 13):
- An ancestral Delta gene duplicated before the radiation of the Eumetazoa, followed by an association of
the VWC domain to one of these Delta copies. The
number of EGFs increased either by tandem duplications within a gene (where a segment is duplicated
and the copy inserted next to its origin), exon shuffling
(which may be responsible for internal duplications of
repeats) or DNA slippage (due to the formation of
DNA hairpins) [98,111].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

- An ancestral Delta gene duplicated before the radiation of the Eumetazoa, at which time EGF repeats were
already independently associated with a VWC domain
(the state observed in Placozoa). One copy of the
ancestral Delta joined the EGF+VWC motif to create
Jagged. This second hypothesis could explain the
higher number of EGFs in Jagged compared to Delta
(as the result of the addition of two series of EGF
repeats). The fact that EGF motifs from Jagged seems
to be physically separated into two groups, as shown
in Figure 9, may support this hypothesis. This second
scenario is also convincing because the shared possession of motif repeats (EGFs) between independent
genes was previously reported to favour domain shuffling (non homologous recombination) with likely
consequences the creation of new exon combinations
and thus new proteins [97,111].
As we failed to find any specific signature in EGF repeats
that could allow us to favour one of these two scenarios,
the sequencing of additional non-bilaterian genomes may
help to resolve this question. Nevertheless we have to
keep mind that currently the placozoan phylogenetic
position is still controversial [44,45,112,113].

Conclusion
This study focusing on the Notch signalling pathway provides for the first time a complete description of Notch
components and auxiliary factors across the Eukaryota.
These investigations have enabled us to re-assess the
ancient origin of some components such as the γ-secretase
complex and Notchless. Fringe and Sno are probably old
genes that were convergently acquired by lateral gene
transfer. Several new functions of the Notch pathway
likely originated in the last common ancestor of Holozoa,
which already possessed 12 genes of the pathway. Nevertheless, the core genes needed for a functional pathway
are only present in metazoans and it apparent that the two
main players, Notch and Delta, emerged via both the shuffling of old domains (EGF, ANK, LNR), and the invention
of new ones (MNLL, DSL).
At present, functional data on non-bilaterian models are
scarce, but such efforts need to be realized in order to
understand the emergence of functionality in the Notch
pathway. More largely this will pertain to an understanding of the emergence of signal transduction pathways during the acquisition of multicellularity in the Metazoa.

the Amphimedon queenslandica genome is still not annotated, sequences were identified and concatenated following the previously published procedure [85,114].
Regardless of the origin of the sequence data, TBLASTN or
BLASTP searches [38] were carried out on genome data
(including 31 complete genomes) when available with a
cut-off E-value threshold of e-25 or less. When BLASTs
against genome data gave results, the sequences obtained
were systematically reciprocally BLASTed against the
NCBI database. In this way, we could confirm the validity
of the sequences retrieved with the initial BLAST searches
(reciprocal best hits [115]).

Sequences analyses
Genes were scored "present", "absent" or "incomplete"
(Figure 3). Genes were annotated "incomplete" when the
domain composition considered as diagnostic was not
recovered (for details see Table 2 and procedure for
domain arrangement analysis hereafter) Genes were
scored as "absent" only when BLAST searches against a
complete genome gave no result. Abbreviations for species names are as follows: Aae: Aedes aegypti; Aqu:

For phylogenetic analyses, 18 alignments (one alignment
for each gene except for O-fut, SMRT and HES, the latter
having been recently reported in [116]) were performed
using the online software Muscle (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/muscle/index.html[117,118]) and subsequently
corrected by eye in Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor
5.09 [119] (additional file 1). The alignments were then
treated with the program GBLOCKS with the least-stringent settings to release positions of uncertain homology
[120].
For Notch and DSL proteins, the number of EGF domains
is variable so they were excluded from the phylogenetic
analyses. For the analysis of Notch, the alignment used
includes only a part of the sequence from LNR domain to
the end (749 bp). The DSL alignment used includes also
partially the DSL protein sequence from the beginning to
the end of the DSL domain (169 bp). Five sequences were
incomplete in the DSL alignment (Delta: O. carmela; S.
purpuratus 3; Jagged: L. gigantea 2; H. robusta; B. floridae).
For ligand nomenclature, all genes that contain the VWC
domain were named Jagged (prefixed with J-).
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the protein
alignments using the maximum likelihood method (ML)
with the PHYML program under a WAG model of amino
acid substitution [121]. To take into account rate variation
among sites, we computed likelihood values by using an
estimated gamma law with four substitution rate categories and we let the program evaluate the proportion of
invariant sites (WAG+I+ Γ4). Node robustness was tested
by bootstrap (BP) analysis [122] with 1,000 replicates. In
addition, for DSL and Notch phylogenetic analyses, Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes 3.1, using the
WAG fixed model [123]. Two sets of six independent
simultaneous metropolis-couples Markov chains Monte
Carlo were run for five million generations and sampled
every hundredth generation. The runs were monitored for
convergence and an adequate burn-in was removed
(above 25% of tree and parameters). Bayesian posterior
probabilities (PP) were used for assessing the confidence
value of each node [124].
Domain arrangements and composition
For multidomain protein coding genes, the presence of
specific protein domains and the domain arrangements

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/249

were checked by scanning sequences with Prosite http://
www.expasy.org/prosite/[125], CDD http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml[126] and InterProscan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/ online
software [127].
In addition, for Notch, Delta and Jagged genes we used
PSORTII [128] and PESTfind [129] software for identifying the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) and the PEST
region respectively. For other regions and/or domains
characteristic of the Notch receptors and Delta ligand that
cannot be detected by the previous software (C-C linker,
RAM motif, cleavage sites) conserved regions were identified "by eye" on the basis of sequence alignments and previous works [19,62,96,130]. It is worth noting that the
prediction of cleavage sites was confounded by sequence
divergence, such that these sites cannot always be stated
with full confidence. For designing the Notch, Delta and
Jagged compositions, MyDomains Image Creator from
Prosite was used.
Five major genes of the Notch pathway were selected for
more detailed domain composition analyses: the receptor
Notch, the ligand DSL, Suppressor of Hairless, the ligand
regulator Mindbomb and the enzyme responsible for the
S1 cleavage, Furin. We used multiple software platforms
for gene domain prediction (Prosite, Interproscan,
SMART [131,132], Pfam [133], Superfamily (supfam.org/
SUPERFAMILY/) [134]). Evolution of these five genes
among eukaryotes was discussed according to two previously proposed rooting hypotheses [36,135]. Two conflicting hypotheses for the position of the root of the
eukaryote tree are currently recognized [36,136]: subdivision of eukaryotes between opisthokonts + amoebozoans
and bikonts (all remaining eukaryotes, on the left of Figures 10, 11, 12) [135], and the more classical rooting on
excavates (on the right of Figures 10, 11, 12) [137,138].
