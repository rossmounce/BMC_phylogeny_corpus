A three-way comparative genomic analysis of
Mannheimia haemolytica isolates

Abstract
Background: Mannhemia haemolytica is a Gram-negative bacterium and the principal etiological agent associated
with bovine respiratory disease complex. They transform from a benign commensal to a deadly pathogen, during
stress such as viral infection and transportation to feedlots and cause acute pleuropneumonia commonly known as
shipping fever. The U.S beef industry alone loses more than one billion dollars annually due to shipping fever.
Despite its enormous economic importance there are no specific and accurate genetic markers, which will aid in
understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of M. haemolytica at molecular level and assist in devising an
effective control strategy.
Description: During our comparative genomic sequence analysis of three Mannheimia haemolytica isolates, we
identified a number of genes that are unique to each strain. These genes are “high value targets” for future studies
that attempt to correlate the variable gene pool with phenotype. We also identified a number of high confidence
single nucleotide polymorphisms (hcSNPs) spread throughout the genome and focused on non-synonymous SNPs
in known virulence genes. These SNPs will be used to design new hcSNP arrays to study variation across strains,
and will potentially aid in understanding gene regulation and the mode of action of various virulence factors.
Conclusions: During our analysis we identified previously unknown possible type III secretion effector proteins,
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated sequences (Cas). The
presence of CRISPR regions is indicative of likely co-evolution with an associated phage. If proven functional, the
presence of a type III secretion system in M. haemolytica will help us re-evaluate our approach to study hostpathogen interactions. We also identified various adhesins containing immuno-dominant domains, which may
interfere with host-innate immunity and which could potentially serve as effective vaccine candidates.

Background
Mannhemia haemolytica is a weakly haemolytic, Gramnegative bacterium and the principal casual agent associated with the respiratory-disease complex in ruminants. M. haemolytica is a normal commensal of the
upper respiratory tract and tonsillar crypts in healthy
ruminants. However, in the case of animals with compromised pulmonary defense mechanisms and stress, it
can migrate into the lungs and cause acute fibrinous
pleuropneumonia or pasteurellosis, commonly known as
“shipping fever” [1-3]. Young animals are more susceptible than adults leading to sudden death with or without
clinical signs [4]. Outbreaks of Pasteurellosis caused by

M. haemolytica result in substantial economic losses to
the global cattle industry and accounts for 30% of the
total cattle deaths worldwide [5-7]. This impact is particularly devastating to the North American cattle and
sheep industries [5,6]. The U.S beef industry alone loses
more than one billion dollars annually to shipping fever
[8]. In addition, M. haemolytica infection results in collateral losses to other domestic and wild ruminants.
Despite its enormous economic importance, there
are no specific and accurate genetic markers to precisely understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology
of M. haemolytica at molecular level. Commonly used
genotyping techniques such as16 S rRNA sequence
phylogeny, DNA:DNA hybridization, pulse field gel
electrophoresis and restriction fragment length polymorphisms are unreliable, time consuming and cannot
be correlated to pathogenesis or species specificity of

an isolate [9-11]. The molecular basis of virulence
mechanisms of M. haemolytica is fragmentary, due to
the complex gene regulatory machinery involved during the expression of virulence and virulence-associated factors in host tissues [12]. In addition, until
our recent publication of the genome sequences of two
M. haemolytica serotype A2 strains, only one genome
sequence from M. haemolytica, serotype A1 was available in the GenBank [13,14]. As a result, there was
clearly a dearth of knowledge about the range and
diversity of potential virulence factors in different
strains of M. haemolytica.
The current classification of M. haemolytica relies on
serotyping based on external capsular polysaccharides
and twelve different serotypes have been identified.
Furthermore, these serotypes do not conform to the
classical Koch’s postulates on microbial pathogenesis
due to a great deal of genome plasticity and frequent
serotype switching [15]. Of these, A1 and A2 are the
most prevalent serotypes and are normal residents of
the upper respiratory tracts of healthy cattle and sheep
worldwide [16,17]. They are generally, but not exclusively, species-specific in their ability to cause pneumonia [16,17]. Bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis is mostly
caused by M. haemolytica serotype A1, while the serotype A2 causes pneumonia in sheep. With the objectives
of identifying the species specificity of serotypes at the
molecular level, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that may be associated with fibronecrotizing pneumonia,
and identifying additional virulence factors, we
sequenced two M. haemolytica A2 serotypes from two
different ruminant species. One was isolated from the
pneumonic lungs of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and
designated as Ovine (O), while the other isolate from
cattle (Bos taurus), was designated as Bovine (B). We
performed a genome-wide comparative sequence analysis between these strains and the genome sequence of
M. haemolytica bovine serotype A1, PHL213 which we
designated as A1.
During this investigation, we identified all the previously described virulence factors including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, iron acquisition, complex
carbohydrate biosynthesis, capsular polysaccharides and
adhesion biosynthesis genes in both the B and O genomes. We used our data to identify genes that are
unique to each strain as well as SNP variation between
the strains with a focus on non-synonymous SNPs in
known virulence factors. In pathogenic bacteria, SNPs
serve as evolutionary markers and those present in virulence factors may aid in defining the host specificity at
molecular level [18]. We identified clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR),
CRISPR-associated sequences (Cas) and a previously
undetected possible type III effector protein secretory

pathway, which may be implicated in modulating
M. haemolytica pathogenesis in a species-specific manner.
We identified high confidence SNPs (hcSNPs) within
the leukotoxin (Lkt) operon across all three isolates
but only one hcSNP between bovine isolates in
the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding O-sialoendoglycopeptidase, a key enzyme which determines the
host-specific colonization of the bacteria. Along with
these genotypic markers, we identified various adhesins
containing hedgehog/intein and hep/hag immunodominant domains, which could potentially be used to
engineer vaccine strains.

Construction and content
Genome sequencing and assembly

M. haemolytica serotype A2 isolated from pneumonic
lungs of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos
taurus), were grown overnight in brain heart infusion
broth at 37°C/200 rpm. The next day, cells were harvested and the total genomic DNA was extracted using
QuickExtract™ Bacterial DNA Extraction Kit (Epicenter
Biotechnologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic libraries for sequencing were prepared
from 5 μg of total genomic DNA. The sequencing reaction was performed using the 454 pyrosequencing technology and run on Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument
(Software 1.0.53) following the manufacturer’s instructions (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd) [19]. The raw data
was assembled using the Newbler Assembler Software
(Genome Sequencer 20, Version 1.0.53), with default
parameters.
Gene prediction and annotation

The assembled contig sequences were processed by our
in-house pipeline for gene prediction and annotation
using the genome of serotype A1 as a guide. We adapted
the protocol previously developed by The Institute for
Genomic Research (J. Craig Venter Institute). Briefly,
Glimmer3, Exonerate and tRNAscan SE tools were
used to predict protein-, rRNA- and tRNA-coding
genes respectively [20-22]. All protein-coding genes
were then annotated by using the RAST annotation
pipeline http://rast.nmpdr.org/ [23]. Each protein
sequence was also BLAST searched against Clusters of
Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) database
using the NCBI BLAST package [24,25]. Then a COG
identification number was assigned to each gene if the
best BLASTP hit exhibits at least 80% sequence coverage in both query and hit sequences and at least 30%
protein sequence identity. Finally, protein-coding genes
were analyzed to identify putative frameshift mutations
using BLAST Extend-Repraze http://ber.sourceforge.
net/. Genes containing frameshift mutations were considered as putative pseudogenes. Unique genes of each

Lawrence et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:535
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/535

genome were identified by BLAST searching each gene
sequence to the genome of another strain with an Evalue cutoff of 1e-6. A gene was considered unique if
no significant hit was reported. Novel computational
methods were used to detect evidence of secreted
effector proteins for the type III secretion system and
web based software (http://www.genome.jp/, KEGG
pathway) was used to detect secretion system components [26].
Identification of high confidence single nucleotide
polymorphisms (hcSNPs)

We developed a protocol that utilizes raw 454 read data
(Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd) to identify hcSNPs between
two genomes. Given two sets of 454 reads (readA and
readB) from different genomes, we first used the newbler assembler to create two independent sets of contigs,
named as contigA and contigB. The contig sequence
from one genome was used as a reference while the
reads from the other genome were aligned based on
them using gsMapper software. Specifically, two gsMapper runs were carried out, where readA was mapped to
contigB in one run and readB to contigA in another run.
The gsMapper software utilizes a reference sequence to
aid the assembly of raw read data. In addition to
sequence assembly, this software gives a “high confidence
difference (HCD)” file that summarizes all regions, where
the sequence alignment shows differences between reference and multiple read sequences spanning that region.
From “readA mapped to contigB” gsMapper run, readA
sequences spanning a HCD region (e.g., HCD1) were
checked to identify regions within contigA sequence,
where they were assembled by the previous newbler run.
If this particular region also appears in the HCD output
file from the “readB mapped to contigA” gsMapper run,
where readB sequences spanning this HCD have been
assembled to the region where the previous HCD1 is
found, we considered this HCD to be an hcSNP. This
protocol essentially allows us to screen for differences
between two genomes that were supported by multiple
raw sequencing reads. For the comparison of B and O
strains, each hcSNPs are supported by at least 10 reads
from each genome, where at least 80% of the reads spanning that region show the difference. For comparison of
B or O to previously sequenced A1 serotype, we were
limited by the lack of raw data from A1. Hence, we were
able to compare only to the consensus sequence of A1 as
reported in the GenBank. As a result, hcSNPs from comparisons to A1 are only supported by multiple reads from
either B or O genome. We anticipate that the error rate
in such an assembly will range from 1 part in 10,000 to
about 1 part in 40,000. For a genome of approximately
2.2 Mb in length, we anticipate approximately 55-220

sequence errors in the assembly. Hence sequence differences between B/O and A1 will be a combination of both
real sequence differences and errors in the assembly of
A1. Finally, the hcSNP data is filtered based on contig
base quality score (at least 60) as well as whether or not
the hcSNP is found on a homopolymer region of 3 bases
or more to reduce false positive error.
Phylogenetic trees construction

We identified conserved genes common in all nine genomes based on their DNA sequence similarity using a
combination of BLASTCLUST and BLAST software
[25]. This resulted in a list of 28 genes, most of which
coded for 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunit proteins.
The concatenated sequences of these 28 conserved
genes (average length of 17,638 bp) were then aligned
using ClustalW version 2 with default parameters [27].
PHYLIP program version 3.6 was used to construct the
tree using the F84 evolutionary model and neighborjoining method http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/
phylip/getme.html [28]. Finally, the Phylodendron software was used to draw the tree [29].

Utility and discussion
Gene content analysis

We obtained 20× coverage for B and O genomes after
high-throughput sequencing using the 454- pyrosequencing technology. The assemblies produced 84 contigs for
the B (average contig length of 30.2 kb) and 144 contigs
for the O (average contig length of 17.9 kb) genomes
respectively. The average contig length selected for cut
off was >300 bp. Based on our previous experience, at
this coverage, the gaps in the sequence are likely to be
small and typically associated with repeat regions. The
total number of base pairs in the contigs were 2,478,004
for B and 2,584,200 for O, which is comparable to the
only other previously sequenced M. haemolytica A1
draft genome with a 8× coverage (2,569,125 bp) [14].
The complete annotation of B and O strains with additional details can be found in the GenBank (accession
numbers ACZY00000000 and ACZX00000000, project
numbers 40173 and 40171 respectively) [13]. The overall
GC content of the M. haemolytica genomes is approximately 41%. Using an automated gene finding and annotation pipeline (see construction and content), we
identified 2,550 open reading frames (ORFs) in the B
and 2,682 ORFs in the O genome. The number of genes
identified in these genomes are comparable to the previously reported M. haemolytica A1 genome (2,695
ORFs, GenBank accession number AASA00000000).
Table 1 summarizes the basic features of the B and O
genomes. We found 82-100% (average = 99.2%) overall
nucleotide identity among the 1,664 protein encoding

genes that are at least 300 bp in length in all 3 strains
(Figure 1), which suggests that most of these common
genes are highly conserved among these three isolates.
By performing an all genes against all genomes analysis,
we found that the A1, B and O genomes have 233, 38 and
62 unique genes respectively (a full list of A1, B and O
strain specific genes can be found in the Additional file 1,
Table S1, Additional file 2, Table S2 and Additional file
3, Table S3 respectively). Among the A1 specific genes
57% are hypothetical proteins and 20% are bacteriophage
encoded proteins. The A1 genome has a few functionally
important enzymes such as the UDP N acetylglucosamine 2 epimerase (MHA_0505), capsule biosynthesis
protein (MHA_0507) and sialyltransferase (MHA_1780),
indicating their possible role in conferring serotype

specificity. Similarly, 57% of the B genome specific genes
are hypothetical proteins and 29% are phage proteins.
Among the B specific genes, enzymes such as peptidoglycan transglycolyase (COK_0539) involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and beta hexosamidase (COK_2260), a
glycoside hydrolase involved in trimming carbohydrate
decorations and pathogenesis are unique and noteworthy.
On the other hand, the O genome accounts for 70%
hypothetical proteins, of which less than 2% originate
from phages. The only specific protein in the O genome,
is the silent information regulator (Sir2, COI_1007), a
homolog of transcription regulator, which is critical in
maintaining bacterial replication and gene expression.
In summary, we found that the vast majority of these
strain specific genes do not exhibit significant sequence
similarity to other proteins of known function and cannot be categorized into any Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COG, Figure 2). However, the B and O strain
specific genes appear to resemble integrated phage genomes. The pair wise comparison of gene content from
one serotype in relation to the other reveals that about
9-12% of the genes are variable between A1 and A2 (B
and O). Comparatively, a smaller number of variable
genes (2-6%) are found between B and O, indicating
that these two genomes share a more similar gene content in relation to each other than to A1 (Table 2). This
degree of strain specificity and variable gene pool is an
important group for further study, since bacteria frequently acquire virulence factors via horizontal gene
transfer [30].
SNPs among virulence genes

Pathogenicity of M. haemolytica is due to a repertoire of
exotoxins, endotoxins, and host immune-modulating
proteins produced by it. Therefore, to characterize the
potentially interesting SNPs in the M. haemolytica genome, we performed a SNPs analysis between these three
genomes. In brief, we mapped individual reads from
each strain to the consensus sequence of the other
strains and identified SNPs that meet certain quality criteria (see construction and content). These SNPs are
dubbed as high confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (hcSNPs). The availability of individual reads from
the strains of interest allowed us to compare the B and
O genomes in both the directions (e.g., reads from B
mapped to the consensus sequence of O and vice versa),
which enabled us to filter the results and identify
hcSNPs that meet the quality criteria for both mapping
directions. These hcSNP’s have high sequence coverage
in both strains and consistently vary between strains in
the individual reads.
To estimate the rate of false positives in our SNP detection methods and to obtain a quantitative estimate of the
overall error of 454 sequencing and assembly, we have

assembled genomes, we have subsampled (without replacement), the reads from one these strains to create independent assemblies at 20× coverage (see Additional file
4, Table S4). 3) Assembled these sampled reads using the
newbler assembler and mapped the trimmed contigs
from these two independent assemblies onto each other
to determine the precision, e.g., the differences that one
obtains through sequencing and assembly errors when
sequencing the same DNA. 4) Our results show that the
difference between the two independent sequencing and
assemblies was 1 bp in 17,681 bp (a total of 368 differences in a total of 6,506,615 aligned basepairs) and most

Lawrence et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:535
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/535

(280 out of 368 or 76%) of these differences is in areas of
homopolymer repeats. Since the B and O M. haemolytica
genomes were sequenced to a similar depth (about 20×),
we estimate a similar level of precision in the assemblies
of the O and B genomes, e.g., approximately 1 difference
in 17,681 bp due to sequencing and assembly errors.
Furthermore, we estimate the precision in non-homopolymer repeat regions to be approximately 1 bp in 74 kb.
The SNP’s that we have called between the O and B genomes occur at a rate of approximately 1SNP per 646 bp.
Since we have filtered out SNP’s in homopolymer
regions, an estimate of the false positive rate in our SNP
calls is of order 1% (646 bp/74 kb = 0.008).
For the SNP comparisons between the O/B genomes
and the A1 genome it is a bit more difficult to estimate
the false positive rate, since we don’t have the raw read
data that went into the assembly of A1. However, we do
have quality value estimates for each position in the
assembly ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/MhaemolyticaPHL213/MhaemPHL213-10Aug2006-scaffolds.qual
and we filtered SNPs to eliminate regions in the A1
assembly that are of Q-value <60. Even with this stringent filtering, we identified 13,705 and 9,968 hcSNPs
between B and A1 and O and A1 respectively (or 1SNP/
180 bp for B/A1 and 1SNP/259 bp for O/A1). Given
that typical precision rates for assemblies from eight
fold Sanger sequencing data are of order 1 bp in 20,000100,000 bp, we assume that the A1 assembly is accurate
to at least 1 bp in 20,000 [31]. Hence, we estimate that
the rate of false positive for SNP detection in comparing
the O/B genomes to the A1 genome is also of order 1%.
Table 3 summarizes the total number of synonomous
and non-synonomous hcSNPs across all three isolates
with additional files 1, 2 and 3 showing individual
hcSNP genes with substitutions across each genome. In
the following sections, we discuss the sequence variations which we identified in known virulence and virulence associated factors.
Leukotoxin hcSNPs and sequence variation

The leukotoxin (Lkt) secreted by M. haemolytica is a well
studied, chief virulence factor [32-34]. Lkt is also produced by other members of gram-negative bacteria
including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Escherichia coli
[35,36]. Lkt belongs to the RTX (repeats-in-toxin) family
of pore-forming exotoxins. Although these toxins have
broad target cell specificity, M. haemolytica Lkt is specific
for ruminant macrophages, neutrophils and all leukocyte
subsets [37]. The b2 integrins LFA-1, Mac-1 and CR4
expressed by ruminant polymorphonuclear leukocytes
(PMNs), serve as receptors for M. haemolytica Lkt
[38-42]. These receptors exhibit a high degree of plasticity by binding to Lkt produced by different M.

haemolytica serotypes [40,41]. Furthermore, the leukotoxin operon (lktCABD) of M. haemolytica is a complex
mosaic structure derived by extensive inter- and intraspecies horizontal DNA transfer and intragenic recombination events [43]. LktA protein sequences of B, O and
A1 (COK_0274, COI_0481 and MHA_0254 respectively)
have an overall dissimilarity of 12%, accounting for 17%
amino acid substitution at the amino- terminal (1-378)
and 21% substitution at the carboxyl- terminal (780-953)
(Figure 3A). However, the amino terminus of LktA of A1
has 51% amino acid substitution in this region when
compared to B and O, but shares 98% overall identity
with O and 88% with B respectively. The region encompassing the first 35 amino acids of LktA, which is
involved in pore formation, is 100% identical between the
O and B isolates [44]. At the nucleotide level, there are a
total of 415 variations across the multiple sequence alignment of the lktA genes from B, O and A1 genomes,
which account for 113 amino acid sequence variations
(Figure 3A, Additional file 5, Figure S5). The multiple
alignment result also shows that lktA sequences from O
and A1 are more similar to one another and most of the
variations identified by three-way comparisons are due to
the lktA sequence of the B genome. Among all the variations identified, 116 mutations found between ltkA genes
of B and O genomes are considered as hcSNP by our
SNP filtering methodology encompassing 21 non-synonymous mutations (Additional file 6, Table S6). Similarly,
135 (28 non-synonymous) and 3 (1 non-synonymous)
mutations found between B versus A1 and O versus A1
respectively are considered as hcSNPs (Additional file 7,
Table S7, and Additional file 8, Table S8).
The DNA sequence of Lkt translocation ATP-binding
gene, lktB, appears to be more conserved between the
B, O and A1 genomes (COK_0273, COI_0482 and
MHA_0255 respectively) relative to the lktA gene. The
multiple sequence alignment shows 82 nucleotide substitutions, but amounts to only five amino acid substitutions (Figure 3B, Additional file 5, Figure, S5). The lktB
sequence from A1 and O genomes are more similar to

Lawrence et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:535
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/535

each other, but both are more diverged from the lktB
sequence of the B genome. Out of the 54 mutations
identified between lktB of B and O that are considered
as hcSNP, five are non-synonymous (Additional file 6,
Table S6). Similarly, out of the 78 mutations found
between B and A1, four are non-synonymous and only
one non-synonymous mutation is shared between O
and A1 (Additional file 7, Table S7, and Additional file
8, Table S8). Although Lkt polymorphism has been

Page 7 of 15

implicated in species specificity, we found that the Lkt
isolated from individual M. haemolytica isolates bind to
b2 integrins from various ruminant species [40,41,43].
We suspect that this degree of polymorphism in LktA is
important to enhance the ability of M. haemolytica serotypes to adapt to its niche, the ruminant respiratory
tract.
Although Lkt is an important virulence factor, our
earlier experiments have shown that lktA-deletion

mutants of M. haemolytica still cause mild lung lesions
with reduced mortality when compared to the wild type
bacteria [45]. Therefore, it is logical to hypothesize that
this organism has an arsenal of accessory virulence factors, which aid in host colonization, help gain a competitive advantage to act synergistically and modulate host
gene expression. These accessory factors possibly
include CRISPR and a type III secretion system identified during this study along with the previously known
factors such as lipopolysaccharides, O-sialoglycoprotein
endopeptidase, capsular polysaccharides, iron-regulated
outer-membrane proteins and adhesins [46].
Lipopolysaccharides

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an integral part of the Gramnegative bacterial cell wall and is the chief endotoxin that
contains pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
[46]. LPS activates the macrophages through toll like
receptors (TLRs) and elicits inflammatory cytokine production resulting in septicemia [46,47]. M. haemolytica
LPS also induces an inflammatory cytokine response leading to increased expression of b2-integrins in the host
[48]. The structure of M. haemolytica A1 O-antigen consists of trisaccharide repeat of two D-galactose residues
and one N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue [49]. The Leloir
pathway catalyzes the epimerization of UDP-galactose to
UDP-glucose in most Gram-negative bacteria, which is an
important step in LPS biosynthesis [50]. This enzymatic
reaction is carried out by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase
(GalE). GalE mutants of Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which have truncated LPS, are avirulent when
compared to their wild type, while in M. haemolytica they
may abrogate adhesion [51-55]. Both the B and O genomes contain 32 out of the 38 previously reported genes
found in the A1 LPS biosynthetic pathway (Additional file
9, Table S9). The A1 LPS biosynthetic pathway enzymes
missing in the B and O genomes include UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (MHA_0521), glycosyltranferase
(MHA_1849, MHA_1850), possible sialyltransferase
(MHA_1852) and hypothetical proteins (MHA_1847,
MHA_1851). Most of the LPS biosynthetic genes shared
between these three genomes exhibit 99-100% sequence
identity (Additional file 9, Table S9), suggesting that the
pathway leading to carbohydrate addition during LPS
synthesis is critical and resistant to mutations.
O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase

The adherence of pathogenic bacteria to mucosal
epithelium is dependent on the expression of adhesive
molecules or ligands called adhesions that allow attachment of the organisms to complementary molecules on
mucosal surfaces or receptors. Pathogens from the
family of Pasteurellaceae, employ various types of

Page 8 of 15

ligands, which enable them to adhere, colonize, and
cause infection. These include pili, filamentous proteins
(fimbriae), outer membrane proteins and capsular
polysaccharides.
Although not cytotoxic, O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase helps M. haemolytica to colonize the upper respiratory tract of ruminants in a host-specific manner and
serves as an important virulence factor. A1 and B are serotypically different, but the gene (MHA_1559 and
COK_2067 respectively) encoding O-sialoglycoprotein
endopeptidase has only one nucleotide substitution
resulting in one amino acid substitution at position 70 (P
® T) (Additional file 7, Table S7), while B (COK_2067)
and O (COI_0128) show four substitutions, 70 (P ® E),
191(T ® E), 327 (S ® G) and 340 (P ® S) (Additional
file 6, Table S6). Interestingly, the glycoprotease domain
(amino acids, 96 - 116) remains conserved across all the
three isolates.
Iron-regulated outer-membrane proteins

Pathogenic bacteria often use iron as an environmental
signal for the regulation of virulence genes [56,57]. In
mammalian host, pathogens from the families of Neisseriaceae and Pasteurellaceae frequently deal with the lack of
free iron for uptake, as most of it is stored in intracellular
or extracellular (transferrin, lactoferrin, haemopexin and
haptoglobin) bound forms [58,59]. To overcome this problem, Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria have evolved an
elaborate iron-regulatory system, to acquire this element
from the host. These include the direct binding of ironcontaining proteins to outer-membrane receptors and the
secretion of siderophores or haemophores [60]. Although
M. haemolytica has no known siderophores, these bacteria
produce two highly conserved transferrin (Tf)-binding
proteins that specifically bind the Tf of their particular
host [61,62]. Earlier experiments clearly indicate that iron
is required for the proper growth and Lkt production in
M. haemolytica, as pathogenic gonococcal mutants devoid
of these proteins lose their virulence [63,64]. The B and O
genomes encode several iron acquisition and iron homeostasis proteins similar to serotype A1. The presence of an
elaborate set of iron-acquisition genes, therefore reiterates
the importance of iron in controlling the transcription and
expression of Lkt and other virulence factors in modulating M. haemolytica pathogenesis. Expression of these proteins allows M. haemolytica to acquire iron from host the
hemoglobin, hemopexin, and transferrin. B and O encode
two hemoglobin receptors HmbR1 (COK_2539 and
COI_1763) and HmbR2 (COK_1624 and COI_2258) that
are 99-100% identical to HmbR1 (MHA_1639) and
HmbR2 (MHA_2261) of A1. The previously described
transferrin-binding proteins, TbpA (MHA_0196) found in
A1, is shared by B (COK_1753) and O (COI_2333) with
98% DNA sequence identity, but the TbpB (MHA_0197)

Lawrence et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:535
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/535

is only 50% identical to TbpB, found in the B and O genomes (COK_1752 and COI_2332 respectively).
Adhesins

Adhesins help in tethering the bacteria to the host cell surface in a manner similar to a grappling hook. Most of the
adhesins are pili, and the type IV pilus locus pilABCD of
O (COI_1201-COI_1998) and B (COK_1994-COK_1991)
genomes are encoded in an opposite orientation, when
compared to A1 (MHA_0662-MHA_0665). The PilC protein from A1 and B are 100% identical, indicating their
bovine origin, whereas, strain O has a 29 amino acid deletion in its amino-terminus. PilC in N. meningitides is
implicated in human epithelial cell-specific interaction and
pilus biogenesis [65,66]. The amino-terminal deletion of
PilC in M. haemolytica strain O may serve as a modification, necessary for ovine epithelial cell-specific colonization. The biogenesis and function of type IV pili is
controlled by a large number of genes, almost 40 of which
has been identified in P. aeruginosa [67]. B and O
genomes share a high degree of homology to a number of
genes required for pili assembly that are involved in
type II protein secretion and competence for DNA uptake,
suggesting that these systems share a common hierarchy
along with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and Neisseria
species [68].
Filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is a major cell surface-associated adhesin that attaches to the host ciliary
epithelial cells and is a virulence determinant [69,70].
Pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ analysis indicates the
possible involvement of internal FhaB domain of FHA
protein in heme utilization. FHA (fhaB) from A1
(MHA_0866) shares 99% DNA sequence identity to the
homologous regions of strains B (COK_0334) and O
(Contig00015). The fhaB ortholog of M. haemolytica is
also shared by Bordella pertussis, N. meningitidis,
A. pleuropneumoniae, M. succiniciproducens and P. syringae. The fhaB genes of the B and O strains are adjacent to the fhaC ortholog, similar to the two-partner
secretory pathway found in A1. The fhaB proteins in the
B and O genomes lack the integrin-binding RGD motif,
but are characterized by the presence of three bacterial
intein-like (BIL) regions at their carboxyl- termini, similar to A1. BILs belong to the HINT (hedgehog/intein)
superfamily of domains, which post-translationally selfprocess by protein splicing and self-cleavage, hence
interferes with the host innate immune system [71].
The adhesin, serotype A1-specific antigen (Ssa1) is
present in both the B and O genomes [72]. Surprisingly
the amino acid sequence of Ssa1 from A1 (MHA_2492)
is only 79% identical to B (COK_2411) considering their
origin from a common host, but 95% identical to O
(COI_0850). The Ssa1 protein also contains an aminoterminal peptidase S8 superfamily domain, which can be

Page 9 of 15

cleaved by serine peptidases and a carboxyl-terminal
autotransporter superfamily domain.
The orthologs of H. influenzae and N. meningitides
IgA-specific serine metallo-endopeptidase of A1
(MHA_0563 and MHA_2800), is 99% identical at amino
acid level to B and O enzymes (COK_0634, COI2_430
and COK_1350, COI_2438). However, the MHA_2800
homologues of B and O (COK_1350, COI_2438) are
only half the size and are devoid of amino acids ranging
from 704-1503, including their carboxyl- terminal. This
deletion removes the entire pertactin and autotransporter domains and almost 75% of the second peptidase S6
domain. These domains are not predicted to contain
any active amino acids http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/search/
sequence. On the other hand MHA_0563 homologues,
COK_0634 and COI_2430 contain all the three domains,
i.e., S6 peptidase, AT-pertactin and carboxyl- terminal
autotransporter. Iga1 hydrolyses the host mucosal antibody IgA and possibly IgG, and helps in colonization by
immune-evasion [73].
The autotransporter/adhesion protein of A1
(MHA_2701), shares 75% identity with B (COK_1437)
and O (COI_2393) genomes, whereas the AT family of
autotransporter/adhesion MHA_1367 shares 96%
(COK_2435) and 99% (COI_1943) identities respectively. These proteins are involved in promoting adhesion to the host mucosal surfaces and are closely related
to autotransporter/adhesins of A. pleuropneumoniae,
M. succiniciproducens and hep/hag family proteins of
N. mucosa. The hep/hag domain is a seven-residue
repeat that makes up the majority of the sequence of a
family of bacterial haemagglutinins and invasins. The
ORFs COK_2435 and COI_1943 show four and seven
hep/hag repeats and one carboxyl-terminal YadA-like
domain from Yersinia species. The hep/hag proteins
also serve as immuno-dominant antigens in Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei [74]. Therefore, hep/
hag domains can be exploited for serodiagnosis in M.
haemolytica along with hcSNP markers, for increased
fidelity.
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

CRISPR loci consists of a family of DNA direct repeats
separated by regularly sized non-repetitive spacer
sequences that are found in most bacterial and archaeal
genomes [75]. CRISPR regions provide acquired immunity against super infecting bacteriophages, possibly acting via RNA interference-like mechanism [76]. The
differences in the number and type of the spacers
between CRISPR repeats correlate with phage sensitivity.
CRISPR regions are often hypervariable between the
otherwise closely related strains [77]. In addition, there
are many protein families known as CRISPR-associated
sequences (Cas), which are encoded in the vicinity of

Lawrence et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:535
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/535

CRISPR loci [78]. CRISPR/Cas gene regions can be quite
large, with up to 20 different, tandem-arranged cas
genes next to a CRISPR cluster or filling the region
between two repeat clusters. Cas proteins are thought to
be involved in the propagation and functioning of
CRISPRs and some show similarity to helicases
and repair proteins [78]. The CRISPR/Cas loci of B and
O consist of four genes, COK_0798, COK_0799,
COK_0800, COK_0801 and COI_0267, COI_0268,
COI_0269, COI_0270 respectively. The Cas family,
which is represented by CT1134 and CT1133
from Chlorobium tepidum, is also found in the B and O
genomes (COK_0798, COK_0799 and COI_0267,
COI_0268). This family belongs to the three-gene
CRISPR/Cas subtypes found in Desulfovibrio vulgaris
and is a member of the Dvulg subtype [78]. There are
five hcSNPs in CT1134 and eleven in CT1133 loci
between strains O and B, which can be used for strain
typing. The locus, COK_0800 and COI_0269 are 100%
identical to Thermotoga maritima Cas family, TM1801
[78]. The last gene in this cluster is a recB exonuclease
(COK_0801 and COI_0270) which is 100% identical
between these two isolates. Furthermore, we also identified CRISPR/Cas loci in the A1 genome (MHA_0343,
MHA_0344, MHA_0345, and MHA_0346), previously
reported as hypothetical proteins [14]. A schematic
representation of the CRIPSR loci along with spacers
from all the three isolates is shown in Figure 4. The presence of CRISPR regions in the M. haemolytica genome
indicates its potential resistance to superinfection by
phages. The CRISRP/Cas mechanism is analogous to the
eukaryotic RNAi system [79,80].
Type III secretion system

We performed a novel computational analysis to search
for previously undiscovered secretion systems in these
genomes. In addition to genes encoding a type I secretion system similar to E. coli haemolysin, both the B
and O genomes also contain genes that encode a previously undiscovered putative type III secretion system
(T3SS) and twin arginine targeting (Tat) systems [81]. B
and O encode proteins that show low to moderate
homology to T3SS effector components of E. coli O157:
H7, needle-like protein, SctF (49%), secretin SctC (35%),
outer membrane protein SctW (40%), inner membrane
proteins SctJ (37%), SctR (< 20%), SctS (> 20%), SctT
(> 20%), SctU (41%), StcV (low), an ATPase SctN (46%)
and an ATPase associated protein SctQ (low). They also
share 40% identity to SctC and 47% to an ATPase SctN
of B. pseudomallei. The genes encoding possible T3SS
of B and O do not fall under a unique operon. The possible organization of T3SS genes is depicted in figure 5
along with type III secretion protein Ysc C homolog

Page 10 of 15

(COK_1782/COI_2362), which has a distinct secretin Ndomain. Interestingly, we failed to identify T3SS operon
in the A1 genome, due to either low sequence coverage
or complete absence.
The presence of a T3SS in M. haemolytica B and O
could equip them with a unique virulence mechanism
that enables them to inject bacterial effector proteins
directly into the host cell cytoplasm. The T3SS bypasses
the extracellular milieu and potentially facilitates bacterial pathogenesis by specifically interfering with host cell
signal transduction/transcription and other cellular processes [82,83]. Additional file 10, Table S10 describes
the list of possible effector proteins showing high, moderate and low probability of being secreted through
T3SS across all the three isolates. These effectors were
predicted using a machine-learning method that uses
the N-terminal region of proteins to predict secretion
and does not rely on detecting homologous effector
domains [26]. Almost 50% of the proteins predicted to
be exported through T3SS are hypothetical and phage
proteins. It is interesting to note that the Lkt acyl transferase and LktA are predicted to be highly exported
through this machinery, although LktA has been shown
to be secreted by type 1 system [84]. A family of
metallo-endopeptidase S6, specific for cleaving IgA
(COK_1350 and COI_2438) is also secreted with high
probability. Similary, the list of moderately exported
protein is also filled with a large number of hypothetical
and phage proteins. There are quite a few virulence
associated proteins, that are exported with moderate
probability, and includes a S6 metalloendopeptidase
homolog, (COK_0634 and COI_2430), iron scavenging
transferrin binding protein (COK_1753 and COI_2333),
siderophore esterase (COK_ 1515 and COI_0656), TonB
(COK_1730, COI_2309), which is required to transduce
cytoplasmic membrane energy to the outer membrane,
Ton B dependent outer membrane receptor (COK_0223
and COI_0091), hemoglobin receptor (COK_2540 and
COI_1762) and a neuraminidase (COK_1504 and
COI_0667). Secretion of these proteins clearly indicates
that M. haemolytica interacts with the host immune system, by bypassing mucosal defense and by scavenging
iron to colonize.
One of the interesting effector protein from B, O and
A1 (COK_1445, COI_1309 and MHA_0531) shows 2040% identity to a transcription activator-like (TAL) type
III effector, gene locus from Xanthomonas oryzae
(AvrXa27), that activates the transcription of the host
resistance gene Xa27, resulting in resistance to bacterial
blight in rice [85]. TAL effectors target host general
transcription factors and manipulate the host transcriptional machinery for virulence and/or avirulence [86].
To date, no such effector proteins have been identified

CT1133 and TM1801 genes. The A1 also locus has an additional 94 bp spacer between CT1134 and CT1133 genes, which is absent in B and O
genomes.

from any Mannheimia species, which re-route the ruminant transcriptional/translational machinery to their
advantage. Further experimental evidence directed
towards isolating and characterizing these effector molecules from M. haemolytica will be necessary to confirm
these computational inferences.
The twin arginine translocation (Tat) machinery
exports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Many Tat-secreted proteins are periplasmic
enzymes that catalyze multiprotein oxido-reduction systems involved in respiration or anaerobic growth [86].
M. haemolytica Tat proteins ABC and E shares high
homology with E. coli O157:H7 sec-independent translocase components (43%, 41%, 65% and 53% respectively).

The presence of Tat pathway in M. haemolytica is interesting, because all proteins or complexes of proteins
destined for Tat export must be covalently attached to
one of these specialized amino-terminal twin-arginine
signal peptides unlike the Sec pathway [87]. The Tat
system is also an important virulence factor in aiding
bacterial pathogens to infect plants and animals [88,89].
The B and O genomes encode trimethylamine N-oxide
(TMAO)-inducible operon (torABCE), which is orthologous to E. coli [90]. The TorA protein, trimethylamine
N-oxide reductase relies heavily on the bacterial twinarginine system for its export [87]. Various bacteria
grow anaerobically using TMAO as an alternative
terminal electron acceptor of a respiratory transport

chain [91], but its presence in M. haemolytica is intriguing since this organism grows in an oxygen rich
environment.
Phylogenetic analysis

Overall, the phylogenetic tree (Figure 6) constructed in
this study is in congruence with the earlier results indicating that M. haemolytica B, O, A1, A. pleuropneumoniae, and H. ducreyi form a group that is divergent from
the other members of the family, Pasteurellaceae [14].
Due to the limitations in using 16 S rRNA gene
sequences for phylogenetic analysis, especially in the
Pasteurellaceae species [14,92], we used genes encoding
various 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits. In this analysis, the M. haemolytica isolates are closely related to
H. ducreyi followed by two different isolates of Actinobacillus. This is in agreement to the earlier analysis
obtained using the housekeeping genes from A1 [14].
A. pleuropneumoniae and M. haemolytica occupy the
upper respiratory tract of their hosts and operate using
identical virulence mechanisms and transition from
commensalism to pathogenesis. On the other hand,

Page 12 of 15

H. ducreyi is an opportunistic organism that infects
human genitalia through breaks in the skin or epidermis
and appears to be closely related to M. haemolytica
based on its competence genes, but shares the lowest
number of orthologs with B, O and A1 [14]. Based on
these analyses, it is reasonable to expect that M. haemolytica, H. ducreyi and A. pleuropneumoniae share a
common Pasteurellaceae ancestory when compared to
M. succiniciproducens which had been clustered with
Mannheimia species based on 16 S rRNA sequences
[92]. M. succiniciproducens MBEL55E used in this analysis is a capnophilic ruminant rumen bacterium, thus it is
expected to have a low similarity to the other members
of M. haemolytica cluster. Furthermore, it lacks virulence-related genes such as the leukotoxin and capsule
biosynthesis genes [93]. Considering these phylogenetic
trees, it will be interesting to see how the taxonomic
classification of other M. haemolytica isolates fall into,
once their genome sequences become available. Furthermore, comparative genomic sequence analysis involving
other RTX toxin secreting pathogens will help in analyzing their molecular drives in causing such divergence.

Conclusions
In summary, we have performed a three-way comparison between the genomic sequences of three strains of
M. haemolytica. We identified a number of genes that
are unique to each strain, which are “high value targets”
for future studies that attempt to correlate the variable
gene pool with phenotype (strain virulence, species specificity, etc). We also identified a number of hcSNPs
and focused on non-synonymous SNPs in known virulence genes. This data will be used to design new
hcSNP arrays that will aid in studying variation across
strains and will potentially aid in understanding gene
regulation and the mode of action of various virulence
factors. The additional virulence factors identified in this
study include a previously unknown type III secretion
system and CRISPR regions, which can modulate host
immune responses. These additional virulence factors
along with adhesins, which contain protease cleavage
domain will be used to investigate bovine immune
responses and will serve as effective candidates for vaccine development.
