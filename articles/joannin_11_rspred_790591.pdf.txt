Abstract
Background: Many parasites use multicopy protein families to avoid their host’s immune system through a
strategy called antigenic variation. RIFIN and STEVOR proteins are variable surface antigens uniquely found in the
malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. reichenowi. Although these two protein families are different, they
have more similarity to each other than to any other proteins described to date. As a result, they have been
grouped together in one Pfam domain. However, a recent study has described the sub-division of the RIFIN
protein family into several functionally distinct groups. These sub-groups require phylogenetic analysis to sort out,
which is not practical for large-scale projects, such as the sequencing of patient isolates and meta-genomic
analysis.
Results: We have manually curated the rif and stevor gene repertoires of two Plasmodium falciparum genomes,
isolates DD2 and HB3. We have identified 25% of mis-annotated and ~30 missing rif and stevor genes. Using these
data sets, as well as sequences from the well curated reference genome (isolate 3D7) and field isolate data from
Uniprot, we have developed a tool named RSpred. The tool, based on a set of hidden Markov models and an
evaluation program, automatically identifies STEVOR and RIFIN sequences as well as the sub-groups: A-RIFIN,
B-RIFIN, B1-RIFIN and B2-RIFIN. In addition to these groups, we distinguish a small subset of STEVOR proteins that
we named STEVOR-like, as they either differ remarkably from typical STEVOR proteins or are too fragmented to
reach a high enough score. When compared to Pfam and TIGRFAMs, RSpred proves to be a more robust and
more sensitive method. We have applied RSpred to the proteomes of several P. falciparum strains, P. reichenowi,
P. vivax, P. knowlesi and the rodent malaria species. All groups were found in the P. falciparum strains, and also in
the P. reichenowi parasite, whereas none were predicted in the other species.
Conclusions: We have generated a tool for the sorting of RIFIN and STEVOR proteins, large antigenic variant
protein groups, into homogeneous sub-families. Assigning functions to such protein families requires their
subdivision into meaningful groups such as we have shown for the RIFIN protein family. RSpred removes the need
for complicated and time consuming phylogenetic analysis methods. It will benefit both research groups
sequencing whole genomes as well as others working with field isolates. RSpred is freely accessible via

Background
Many pathogens have evolved strategies to survive
within the hosts they infect. One strategy consists of
varying the antigens the pathogen exposes to its host
immune system, usually resulting in the proliferation of
multicopy protein families, commonly named Variable
Surface Antigens (VSA) [1]. In the case of the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum, there are three major
VSA that allow the parasite to avoid the host’s immune
system and establish chronic infections: the Plasmodium
falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1, RIFIN and
STEVOR proteins (reviewed in [2,3]).
The RIFIN and STEVOR families are groups of VSA
proteins that are unique to the Plasmodium falciparum
and P. reichenowi parasites [4-9]. They are only present
in two species, but they number more than 200 copies
per genome. Although the genome of Plasmodium falciparum has been fully sequenced [6], the information
obtained for the reference strain does not represent the
full knowledge of these antigenic variant protein
families. Field isolates investigated for their repertoire of
rif and stevor genes show an extensive variability [10,11].
This hypervariability makes these proteins difficult to
study and their primary function(s) remain to be discovered. A recent analysis of the whole rif gene repertoire,
which encode for RIFIN proteins, from the reference
genome has concluded that this family can be subdivided into functionally distinct groups [12]. One of
these sub-groups, A-RIFIN, as well as the STEVOR proteins are predominantly exposed to the host’s immune
system at the surface of the infected red blood cell
(RBC) [4,7,8].
Sequestration of infected RBCs is a virulence factor
that allows the parasite to avoid passage through the
spleen, therefore increasing its chances of survival.

A recent analysis of gene expression of VSA of a
P. falciparum strain isolated from a splenectomized
patient showed that A-rif and stevor genes were not
expressed [13], whereas, in isolates from normal
patients, these genes are expressed [4,7,10,11]. The
authors relate this loss of expression to the loss of the
sequestration phenotype. Conversely, B-rif genes are
expressed regardless of the absence of this virulent phenotype [13]. These differences in phenotype as well as
in the localization of these proteins [4,11,14,15] and the
predicted sub-functionalization of RIFIN proteins [12]
demonstrate the importance of distinguishing each of
these sub-groups.
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of ARIFIN, B-RIFIN and STEVOR proteins, including the
potential signal peptide (SP?), variable regions (V1 and
V2),Plasmodium export element motif (PEXEL) [16,17],
conserved regions (C1 and C2) and finally the two predicted transmembrane regions, first a questionable one
(TM?) and second a highly probable one (TM).
Currently, the RIFIN and STEVOR protein families
are represented by the Pfam domain PF02009 [18].
However, this hidden Markov model (HMM) fails to
distinguish RIFIN from STEVOR proteins. There are
TIGRFAMS HMMs [19] that do separate RIFIN and
STEVOR proteins, but they fail to classify the RIFIN or
STEVOR proteins into sub-groups. Although STEVOR,
A-RIFIN and the different B-RIFIN groups are identifiable by experts, they require cumbersome phylogenetic
methods to be divided into their respective sub-groups
[12]. In this study we report the development of a tool,
consisting of a set of HMMs and an evaluation program,
to automatically sort RIFIN and STEVOR proteins
according to their sub-groups. We have named the tool
RSpred for RIFIN and STEVOR predictor.

Results
Curation of the RIFIN and STEVOR repertoires of the
Plasmodium falciparum DD2 and HB3 genomes

We have carried out manual curation of the RIFIN and
STEVOR repertoires in the DD2 and HB3 draft genomes. We used BLAST to detect the DD2 and HB3
sequences, using the entire 3D7 rif and stevor gene
repertoire as query and the DD2 and HB3 supercontigs
as databases. This allowed us to detect all potential rif
and stevor genes.
We compared these BLAST hits with the automatically generated annotations provided by the Broad Institute. Although most of our manually curated genes
correspond to automatic annotations, we have revised
the exon-intron boundaries for more than 25% of
them (three examples shown in Figure 2A). In addition
to these modifications, we have found some odd

Page 3 of 11

predictions: four of our manually curated genes had
automatic predictions as two genes, interrupted by a
frame shift or stop codon, and one had been predicted
as a shorter hypothetical gene on the opposite strand
(data not shown). Finally, we have detected 30 genes
that had no automatic predictions at all (example shown
in Figure 2B). The naming system of the DD2 and HB3
predicted genes uses the format PFDG_XXXXX and
PFHG_XXXXX, where XXXXX is a number. Currently,
there are 5380 and 5623 predicted genes for DD2 and
HB3, respectively. We have decided to annotate the new
genes using incremental numbering from 5381 for DD2
and 5624 for HB3, i.e. PFDG_05381 and PFHG_05624.
Additionally, we have appended all the RIFIN and STEVOR genes, manually curated for this study from DD2
and HB3, with “-NJ” in order to distinguish them from
the original and future annotations. All curated genes

We needed curated data sets of sequences belonging to
each group in order to train the HMMs. STEVOR and
RIFIN proteins share little similarity, which makes
them easy to distinguish from one another after completion of multiple sequence alignment with known
STEVOR and RIFIN sequences. Full-length A-RIFIN
and B-RIFIN proteins are easily recognized, upon
visual inspection of multiple sequence alignments,
based on the presence (A-RIFIN) or absence (B-RIFIN)
of a fairly conserved 25 amino acid residue indel in the
conserved region (Figure 1). However, the sub-groups
within the B-RIFIN cluster are not so easily sorted
without the help of phylogenetic analysis.
Previous research, based on the RIFIN repertoire of
the reference genome, describes three sub-groups in the
B-RIFIN cluster: B1-, B2- and B3-RIFIN [12]. Our present analysis confirms the integrity of the B1- and B2RIFIN sub-groups. However, we find that there is too
little coherence (less than 50% average pairwise identity
in the reference strain, and low confidence bootstrap
scores in the phylogenetic trees) within the B3-RIFIN
cluster to make it form a defined sub-group. We propose to redefine these sequences simply as B-RIFIN.
We also investigated the homogeneity of the STEVOR
family. In phylogenetic trees, derived from multiple
sequence alignments of STEVOR proteins of sequences
obtained from the three P. falciparum genomes, 3D7,
HB3 and DD2, the majority of STEVOR proteins forms
a cluster. However, a small group of proteins, which we
call STEVOR-like, cluster separately from the main
STEVOR group (Figure 3). These sequences differ from
typical STEVOR proteins by different amino acid compositions from the signal sequence through the majority
of the conserved domain. Also, the variable domain’s
length is less consistent than in most STEVOR proteins.
Regardless of these differences, STEVOR-like proteins
share short amino acid motifs throughout the protein,
as well as the entirety of the very typical C-terminus,
with STEVOR proteins.

Sorting out the results and limits of detection

A program was created to evaluate the results obtained
when the five HMMs were used in database searches. This
program uses cut-offs to determine the proper call for
each sequence (Figure 4). Since there are several cut-offs,
our method includes several limits of detection (LOD).
The first LOD is the detection of sequences as True
or False: whether they are RIFIN or STEVOR sequences
or neither. Any score <20 is considered False, i.e. not a

Figure 4 Evaluation program. The evaluation program compares the scores of all HMMs in database searches. Depending on each sequence’s
scores, the program designates the sequence as “False”, i.e. neither STEVOR nor RIFIN, or as belonging to one of the groups: STEVOR, STEVORlike, RIFIN, A-RIFIN, B-RIFIN, B1-RIFIN or B2-RIFIN.

RIFIN or a STEVOR. Of all the curated sequences in
our dataset, three have scores <20: PFDG_05381,
PFDG_04771 and PFDG_04350. The first protein,
PFDG_05381, is an extremely short protein derived
from a gene at the end of the supercontig 1.45. The
sequencing coverage and assembly of contig ends are
often questionable, generating erroneous sequences;
therefore it is not surprising that this protein is not
detected with the STEVOR HMM. The second protein,
PFDG_04771, is one of the three sequences of the rifA2
group described by Wang et al. [21]. The two other
rifA2 sequences, PFD0070c and PFHG_03700, are
among the proteins with the lowest of all the positive
A-RIFIN HMM scores (60.9 and 63.8 respectively).
These three sequences are extremely similar to each
other with the exception of a short variable region preceding the C-terminal transmembrane domain. In the
case of PFDG_04771, it is a low complexity repeat of a
SSGGS motifs. Additionally, this sequence is missing its
N-terminal end. We assume that these circumstances, as
well as the divergence of the rifA2 proteins from the
basic RIFIN type, reduced its score below the detection
limit. Although these sequences are full length (with the
exception of PFDG_04771), all other low scoring (but

higher than any rifA2) A-RIFIN sequences are fragments, again stressing the atypical properties of rifA2.
The third protein below the first LOD, PFDG_04350, is
a partial sequence (119 residues) covering only the
C-terminal part of the protein. It is most similar
to PFL2585c, a protein with very atypical N- and Cterminal ends, although the majority of the protein is
typical of A-RIFIN proteins. The limited length and odd
sequence of PFDG_04350 prevent its recognition as a
RIFIN protein. Thus the three proteins failing to reach
the first LOD have too little sequence similarity to be
identified as RIFIN or STEVOR sequences.
The second LOD is specific to STEVOR proteins: if
the score against the STEVOR HMM is higher than the
True/False cut-off, but <120, then the sequence is reliably related to STEVOR proteins, but either differs from
typical STEVOR sequences or is too fragmented to
reach a high enough score. We refer to these potential
STEVOR sequences as STEVOR-like proteins. The protein fragment PFHG_05644 is an example of low confidence sequence (score < 120) that we assign as
STEVOR-like, although it probably is a valid STEVOR
fragment. Among the sequences that score <120 with
the STEVOR HMM are two identical sequences,

Joannin et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/119

PFC0045w and PFDG_03056, found in the 3D7 and
DD2 strains, respectively. The PlasmoDB version 7.1
annotation for the PFC0045w protein is “RIFIN”. However, although they are distinct from STEVOR proteins,
our phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that these
sequences are not RIFIN proteins, as they tend to cluster separately from the RIFIN and closer to STEVOR
proteins. Until we can accumulate more sequences of
this type, RSpred will predict these proteins to be similar to STEVOR and will assign them the STEVOR-like
tag.
The third LOD is specific to RIFIN proteins: if the
score against either the A-RIFIN or the B-RIFIN HMM
is higher than the score against the STEVOR HMM, but
<300, then the sequence is reliably a RIFIN protein, but
it is not possible to identify its sub-group. Typical examples are fragments of proteins, e.g. PFDG_04007,
PFHG_05281 and A1KQT0 (from DD2, HB3 and Uniprot respectively). In several cases, the short length of
the sequence and the absence of determining properties
(e.g. the 25 amino acid residues indel) result in these
sequences having low scores against both the A-RIFIN
and the B-RIFIN HMMs. Some rare proteins include
enough of the conserved C1 region to identify them as
A- or B-RIFIN, but nevertheless score <300 and are
thus sorted into the RIFIN group. These sequences are
most often truncated sequences or contain very odd
amino acid composition, e.g. PFDG_02116 and
PFHG_03477, respectively, possibly caused by low
sequencing coverage or genome assembly problems.
Finally, the fourth limit of detection concerns B1- and
B2-RIFIN proteins: if the score against the B-RIFIN
HMM is >300, but the B1- and B2-RIFIN HMMs do
not reach the cut-offs, then the protein will be evaluated
as B-RIFIN instead of its proper sub-group. Among all
the sequences from our curated dataset, we have not
detected any false negative B1- or B2-RIFIN sequences.
Automatic detection of RIFIN and STEVOR sub-groups in
draft genomes

We applied our HMMs to all coding sequences (CDS)
equal to or longer than 100 amino acids from 15 draft
genomes (downloaded from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT [22] and the Welcome Trust Sanger
Institute [23]) that do not have available annotations.
The screening of these CDS gave variable results,
depending on the genome, from 76 to 286 RIFIN and
STEVOR sequences detected (see Table 1 for the distribution per sub-group). Although most of these genomes
have been sequenced to a very low coverage (1.25×),
each sub-group was detected in almost all genomes. The
only exceptions are the 7G8 genome in which B1-RIFIN
proteins were not found and FCC-2_hainan in which
B2-RIFIN proteins were not detected. Interestingly the

Page 6 of 11

Plasmodium reichenowi genome had the highest number
of hits.
Negative datasets

Currently, RIFIN and STEVOR proteins have only
been found in Plasmodium falciparum and the related
P. reichenowi. Neither Pfam nor TIGRFAMs detect
these proteins in any other known species. Additionally, orthology prediction tools and databases do not
yield any RIFIN or STEVOR homologues in any other
species [24-26]. Finally, the investigation of other Plasmodium multigene families have not detected any
RIFIN or STEVOR homologous proteins [27,28].
Hence, we decided to use other Plasmodium species as
negative controls. No RIFIN or STEVOR sequences
were predicted in P. vivax, P. yoelii, P. berghei,
P. knowlesi or P. chabaudi. RSpred was also run
against the entire Uniprot database, but there were no
RIFIN or STEVOR sequences predicted, except for
those belonging to P. falciparum.
Comparison with Pfam and TIGRFAMs

Other prediction methods exist for the RIFIN and
STEVOR protein families, although each one has its
limitations. Pfam [18] only predicts if a sequence is a
RIFIN/STEVOR (PF02009) or not, while TIGRFAMs
[19] only separates RIFIN (TIGR01477) from STEVOR
(TIGR01478) proteins. Additionally, the TIGRFAMs
were trained as global models and therefore do not
detect sequence fragments. None of the two predict
RIFIN sub-groups, as RSpred does.
In order to test the sensitivity of the three methods,
we applied them to the set of RIFIN and STEVOR
sequences that were not used for the training of RSpred.
Out of 339 RIFIN/STEVOR sequences, RSpred identified 338 (99.7%) of them, whereas Pfam detected 332
(97.9%) and TIGRFAMs only detected 297 (87.6%). Both
TIGRFAMs and Pfam fail to identify low scoring STEVOR, and the former also fails to identify fragments.
The sorting of RIFIN and STEVOR proteins into subgroups makes RSpred more specific than the other models. In addition, RSpred detects more sequences than
Pfam and TIGRFAMs; it is therefore also the most sensitive of the three methods.

Discussion
Redefining the RIFIN and STEVOR sub-groups

Previous studies describe RIFIN and STEVOR sequences
as a large group of related proteins unique to P. falciparum. Subsequent analysis of the RIFIN protein family,
based on the reference genome, showed that the RIFIN
family can be further sub-grouped into A- and B-RIFIN
sequences and the latter divided into B1-, B2- and
B3-RIFIN [12].

All CDS, equal to or larger than 100 amino acids in length, from publically available draft genomes were scored with RSPred.

Our current analysis, which includes many more
sequences, confirms the sub-division of RIFIN sequences
into A-, B1- and B2-RIFIN groups, which all have
defined characteristics. However, it is an overstatement
to create a defined group for the remaining B-RIFIN
sequences. These sequences represent a heterogeneous
cluster (10 genes in the 3D7 reference strain) of
sequences that are defined by the fact that they are not
A-RIFIN sequences and have relatively little similarity to
B1- and B2-RIFIN proteins. We have therefore decided
to retrograde the B3-RIFIN sequences to the rank of
B-RIFIN.
A recent study has defined potential sub-groups
within the A-RIFIN sequences, rifA1 and rifA3. These
groupings rely on sequence similarity of 71% and 84%
and, for a large majority, their genomic location in a
head-to-head orientation with group A var genes [21].
We have not trained HMMs to recognize these groups
because of the low number of sequences available from
the curated datasets. Also, we find that there are several
other such sub-group candidates, but the small number
of sequences within a single genome makes it difficult
to distinguish between bona fide sub-groups and
recently expanded genes.
These authors also defined a sub-group, rifA2, which
is composed of one divergent RIFIN sequence that is
present, with 78% conservation, in all genomes investigated [21]. The case of single copy genes that are very
conserved between genomes are possibly better classified
as conserved genes rather than sub-groups. Also, we
have noted that the proteins that compose the rifA2
group score the lowest of all RIFIN sequences, with one
of them predicted as “false”. The fact that partial

A-RIFIN protein sequences score higher than the full
length rifA2 and the divergence of these sequences from
typical RIFIN proteins strongly suggests that these are
related to RIFIN proteins but have a different function
not requiring multiple copies for the survival of the
parasite.
In this study, we have only focused on the three genomes (3D7, HB3 and DD2) for which annotations are
available as well as the Uniprot database that contains
data from field studies. We confirm the finding, by
Wang et al. [21], that several RIFIN sequences are relatively conserved across strains, however it is difficult to
evaluate whether this represents a measure of the divergence of parasite populations or if they have been evolutionarily selected for specific functions.
Also, we have chosen to adopt a conservative
approach to the STEVOR designation. All sequences
that are clearly related to STEVOR sequences, but that
do not score high enough will be tagged STEVOR-like
by the RSpred program.
Ambiguous sequences

Four sequences predicted to be A-RIFIN proteins also
had relatively high scores (> 300) with either the B1- or
the B2-RIFIN HMM. Upon closer inspection of these
sequences, applying phylogenetic analysis to alignments
of each half of these proteins, it appears that their
N-terminal half correspond well with A-RIFIN sequences
whereas their C-terminal half is characteristic of B1- or
B2-RIFIN proteins (data not shown). These sequences
are hybrids between A- and B1/2-RIFIN proteins and
confirm previous reports of recombination as a mean for
the diversification of these VSA gene families [29].

Advantages, limits and utility of RSpred

We have named our set of HMMs and the evaluation
program RSpred, for RIFIN and STEVOR predictor. We
have shown that it efficiently detects RIFIN and STEVOR proteins and classifies them according to their
sub-group. Although there are no false positive detections, RSpred is conservative with truncated and remotely related sequences. However, most of these
sequences are at least recognized and predicted as
RIFIN or STEVOR proteins. Finally, RSpred proves to
be more sensitive than the existing Pfam and TIGRFAMs HMMs [18,19], which are also limited in the
scope of their classification, as they do not recognize
RIFIN or STEVOR sub-groups.
We have applied RSpred to whole proteomes
extracted from novel genome assemblies. Although
these genomes are mostly sequenced to a very low coverage (1.25×), we were able to detect all sub-groups
within these genomes. This resource will be increasingly
useful as more genomes are being sequenced: in particular, there is a large Plasmodium genome sequencing
project [30] that is scheduled to sequence over 100 Plasmodium parasite genomes, which will allow for metagenomic analysis of the RIFIN and STEVOR protein
families.

Conclusions
The analysis of proteins that are members of large
families is often overwhelming due to the difficulty to
assign proper classification. The RIFIN and STEVOR
families are such groups of proteins: complications are
in part due to their large diversity within each parasite’s genome, but even more so with the extreme
diversity between parasite populations [4,5,10,11,31].
Our prediction tool, RSpred, is designed to simplify
the classification of these proteins into previously
identified sub-groups [6,12] with the following benefits:
• It eliminates the need to manually retrieve reference sequences and perform multiple sequence
alignments;
• It eliminates the need for any prior knowledge of
these protein families in order to sort them properly;
• It out performs existing tools;
• It identifies and sorts RIFIN proteins into RIFIN,
A-RIFIN, B-RIFIN, B1-RIFIN and B2-RIFIN.
Although these groups probably have diverged in
function [12], the sequence conservation between these
proteins assumes that their respective functions are still
closely related. Greater knowledge of the smaller subgroups B1- and B2-RIFIN proteins will improve our
understanding of the larger A-RIFIN and STEVOR

groups that play a more preponderant role at the surface
of the infected host cell [4,13].

Methods
Data sets, retrieval and curation

We obtained sequence information from several sources,
including PlasmoDB [32], Uniprot [33], the Welcome
Trust Sanger Institute [23] and the Broad Institute of
Harvard and MIT [22].
3D7 sequences

We used search functionalities of the PlasmoDB v6.3 to
retrieve all proteins annotated as RIFIN and STEVOR
(221 sequences) excluding MAL7P1.208 that is annotated as RIFIN-like but is more similar to Rhoptry Associated Membrane Antigen (RAMA) proteins.
DD2 & HB3 retrieval and curation

We downloaded all data files pertaining to the DD2 and
HB3 genomes (version 1) from the Broad Institute website [22].
The Supercontigs of both DD2 and HB3 were
searched against the 3D7 repertoire of rif and stevor
genes using BLASTn [34]. The BLAST results were
visualized using Artemis and ACT (Artemis Comparison
Tool) [35,36]. Each hit in the draft genomes was manually checked for the presence of a Broad Institute annotation (BIA). Generally, three case scenarios would
occur:
1. Either there was an annotated gene corresponding
to the manually curated rif or stevor gene. In this
case, the gene would take the BIA gene name.
2. Or there was an annotated gene that did not quite
overlap with the manual curation. In this case, the
manually curated gene would take the BIA gene
name.
3. Or there was no annotated gene at or near those
coordinates. In this case, a new gene would be annotated with a new name.
We detected 193 and 179 RIFIN and STEVOR
sequences from DD2 and HB3, respectively.
Field isolate data

We retrieved all RIFIN and STEVOR protein sequences
from the Uniprot Knowledgebase [33] (446 sequences).
We then removed all sequences from the 3D7 reference
genome (215 sequences after filtering).
Additional draft genomes

Finally, we retrieved additional draft genome sequences
from the Broad Institute and Welcome Trust Sanger
Institute websites [22,23]. The additional genomes downloaded from the Broad Institute were Plasmodium falciparum supercontigs files of 7G8 nucleus, D10 nucleus,
D6 nucleus, Fcc-2/Hainan nucleus, RO-33 nucleus, Santa
Lucia (SL) nucleus, K1 nucleus, Senegal_V34.04 nucleus,

Joannin et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/119

VS/1 nucleus, IGH-CR14 nucleus, RAJ116 nucleus http://
www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/plasmodium_falciparum_spp/MultiDownloads.html and from
the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute were the Plasmodium falciparum Ghanaian Isolate contigs version
20080302 ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Plasmodium/falciparum/Ghanaian_Isolate/ and IT strain supercontigs version 2007114.phusion ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/
pub/pathogens/Plasmodium/falciparum/IT_strain/
Archive/, as well as the Plasmodium reichenowi contigs
version 031104 ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/
Plasmodium/reichenowi/.
These sequence data were produced by the Broad
Institute and Welcome Trust Sanger Institute,
respectively.
At the time of writing, these genomes have no official
annotations; therefore, using Artemis, we extracted from
them all coding sequences (CDS) equal to or greater
than 100 amino acids long, regardless of the presence of
a start codon (see Table 1).
Sequence analysis for sub-group determination

All alignments were carried out using MAFFT or Kalign
2, with default parameters [37,38]. We used Jalview and
Bioedit for alignment visualization and editing [39,40].
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with Molecular
Evolutionary Genetic Analysis 4 (MEGA 4) [41]. All
phylogenetic trees were built with the Neighbor-Joining
method, considering gaps and missing data as pairwise
deletions and using the Amino: Poisson correction
model. Phylogenetic trees were tested with 500 bootstrap replicates.
We first aligned all sequences together in order to distinguish STEVOR and RIFIN proteins from each other.
During this process, we detected a small subset of
sequences that are related to STEVOR proteins but do
not have a high enough HMM score. These sequences
will be tagged as STEVOR-like until the availability of
more sequences will allow for better categorization.
The RIFIN sequences were subsequently sub-divided
according to the classification described in Joannin et al.
[12]. A first approximation of the sub-grouping relies on
the presence or absence of the characteristic 25 amino
acid sequence that is present in A-RIFIN but absent in
B-RIFIN proteins [6,12,42]. Sequences, which were
either truncated or contained large indels, that were not
identifiable as A- or B-RIFIN according to this criterion,
were gathered into an “Unknown RIFIN” group. The
remaining RIFIN sequences (A- and B-RIFIN) were
aligned and sorted into groups according to the resulting phylogenetic tree. Sequences were grouped into
A-RIFIN, B-RIFIN, B1-RIFIN, B2-RIFIN, modified from
Joannin et al. [12] with the B3-RIFIN sub-group here
renamed as B-RIFIN (see Results), as well as an

Page 9 of 11

“Ambiguous” subgroup. The Ambiguous group gathered
all sequences that were identifiable as A-or B-RIFIN
sequences but were not resolved in the phylogenetic
trees.
HMM training, testing and evaluation program

The HMMs for the five different groups of RIFIN and
STEVOR sequences were built using HMMER2 [43].
Both global and local build options were tried and the
local (hmmbuild-f) was found to perform best with this
type of data, containing full length as well as truncated
and fragmented sequences.
For the purpose of HMM training, all alignments were
created using Mafft-linsi [37]. A number of protein
sequences were either truncated compared to typical
sequences or contained indels. We decided that
sequences should be complete and typical from the
PEXEL motif (Plasmodium Export Element motif)
[16,17] to the C-terminal transmembrane domain; the
alignments were constrained to start at this motif as
well. The five training sets were made non-redundant
using FASTA [44], so that the final sets contained no
sequence with more than 80% identity to any other.
Outliers were removed using a jack-knifing test. During
this test each sequence in the training set was excluded,
one at a time, an alignment created and a new HMM
built. The removed sequence was scored against this
new HMM, together with every sequence from the
other training sets (i.e. a negative dataset). If the
excluded sequence did not score higher than every
sequence from the negative dataset it was removed from
the final training set. The final training sets consisted of
259 A-RIFIN, 96 B-RIFIN, 26 B1-RIFIN, 9 B2-RIFIN
and 51 STEVOR sequences.
A program, written in C, was created to manage the
results obtained when the five HMMs were used in
database searches. Figure 4 displays the decision process
and the cut-offs. The cut-offs were set using the manually curated dataset as ‘truth’, including the odd
sequences (with respect to the amino acid composition
or sequence length) removed from the final training set.
Control data sets

In order to test our HMMs for false positives, we
retrieved the proteomes of several other Plasmodium
species. All plasmodium specific datasets where downloaded from PlasmoDB version 7.1 [32] and downloaded
protein coding sequences from Plasmdium falciparum
3D7 (5418, version: 2010-06-01) [6], Plasmodium vivax
Sal-1 (5393, version: 2007-06-13) [45], Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi (5123, version: 2010-06-01), P. knowlesi
strain H (5194, version: 2010-06-01) [46], P. yoelii yoelii
strain 17XNL (7724, version: 2005-09-01) [47] and
P. berghei strain ANKA (4857, version: 2010-06-01) [48].

Additionally, we used the original Broad Institute annotated protein sequences from the DD2 (5380, version:
2007-04-13) and HB3 (5623, version: 2007-03-16) genomes [22].
