Abstract
Background: The 9.6 kb long RNA genome of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is under the control of RNA dependent RNA
polymerase, an error-prone enzyme, for its transcription and replication. A high rate of mutation has been found to
be associated with RNA viruses like HCV. Based on genetic variability, HCV has been classified into 6 different major
genotypes and 11 different subtypes. However this classification system does not provide significant information
about the origin of the virus, primarily due to high mutation rate at nucleotide level. HCV genome codes for a
single polyprotein of about 3011 amino acids which is processed into structural and non-structural proteins inside
host cell by viral and cellular proteases.
Results: We have identified a conserved NS4A protein sequence for HCV genotype 3a reported from four different
continents of the world i.e. Europe, America, Australia and Asia. We investigated 346 sequences and compared
amino acid composition of NS4A protein of different HCV genotypes through Multiple Sequence Alignment and
observed amino acid substitutions C22, V29, V30, V38, Q46 and Q47 in NS4A protein of genotype 1b. Furthermore, we
observed C22 and V30 as more consistent members of NS4A protein of genotype 1a. Similarly Q46 and Q47 in
genotype 5, V29, V30, Q46 and Q47 in genotype 4, C22, Q46 and Q47 in genotype 6, C22, V38, Q46 and Q47 in genotype
3 and C22 in genotype 2 as more consistent members of NS4A protein of these genotypes. So the different amino
acids that were introduced as substitutions in NS4A protein of genotype 1 subtype 1b have been retained as
consistent members of the NS4A protein of other known genotypes.
Conclusion: These observations indicate that NS4A protein of different HCV genotypes originally evolved from
NS4A protein of genotype 1 subtype 1b, which in turn indicate that HCV genotype 1 subtype 1b established itself
earlier in human population and all other known genotypes evolved later as a result of mutations in HCV
genotype 1b. These results were further confirmed through phylogenetic analysis by constructing phylogenetic
tree using NS4A protein as a phylogenetic marker.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus belongs to Flaviviridae family of viruses
and its chronic infection has affected 350 million people
worldwide [1]. HCV has a positive-sense single-stranded
RNA genome of about 9.6 kb that has one single open
reading frame and conserved un-translated regions
(UTRs) at the 5’ and 3’ ends [2]. Within host cell the
polyprotein is processed into structural (Core, E1, E2 and

P7) and nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B,
NS5A and NS5B). Nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein is an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is responsible for
viral genome replication [3]. The error-prone nature of
this enzyme is responsible for a high mutation rate in
HCV. Based on nucleotide sequence comparison analysis
in 5’UTR, Core/E1 and NS5B regions six major HCV
genotypes (HCV-1 to HCV-6) have been described, each
containing multiple subtypes (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c etc). In
terms of genetic variability, genotypes differ from each
other by 31 to 33% and subtype by 20 to 25% [4].

Though HCV classification system has evolved considerably [5,6], it does not provide convincing information
about origin of the virus. Suzuki and Nei used amino
acid sequences of hemagglutinin genes instead of nucleotide sequences in their work on origin and evolution of
influenza virus and they reported that amino acid
sequences provide more reliable information in establishing evolutionary relationship than nucleotide sequences
when the sequence divergence is high [7]. During our
protein blast analysis http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.
cgi?PAGE=Proteins of NS4A gene (HCV genotype 3a)
isolated from Pakistani population, we observed a relatively conserved nature of NS4A protein. Furthermore,
we observed occasional amino acid substitutions in the
NS4A protein sequences from genotype 3a.
NS4A protein is a small protein consisting total of 54
amino acids and it functions as cofactor of NS3 protease
in viral life cycle. NS3-4A serine protease is a non-covalent, heterodimer complex formed by the association of
two proteins, the N-terminal serine protease domain of
NS3 (catalytic subunit) and NS4A cofactor (activation subunit). NS3-4A serine protease has a role in HCV polyprotein processing and is responsible for proteolytic cleavage
at NS3/NS4A, NS4A/NS4B, NS4B/NS5A and NS5A/
NS5B junctions to release individual proteins from the
polyprotein [8-18].
The purpose of this study is to establish the identity of
the parent HCV genotype that first established itself in
human population. We have analyzed amino acid
sequences of NS4A protein of all known Hepatitis C
virus genotypes through Multiple Sequence Alignment
and by constructing a phylogenetic tree using CLC
sequence viewer software. We used NS4A protein due to
many reasons. First of all due to its relatively conserved
nature, second the occasional amino acid substitutions
that we observed and third due to availability of large
number of sequences for this region in sequence databases from all over the world. We have used amino acid
substitutions as a tool because it would be logical to
think that when an amino acid substitution is introduced
into NS4A protein it will be retained in future progenies
until mutated again. Due to a relatively conserved nature
of NS4A protein, some of these amino acid substitutions
might travel a long distance across different HCV genotypes as HCV evolved. If we follow such substitutions
across different HCV genotypes it can provide valuable
information about evolution of NS4A protein, and in
turn about evolution of HCV. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method
with Arithmetic Mean) method to support our results.

Material and methods
Total of 346 nucleotide sequences were randomly selected
and downloaded from Hepatitis C Virus Database http://

Page 2 of 19

www.hcvdb.org and GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov representing 6 different HCV genotypes. The 346
sequences included in this study were reported from all
over the world; France, Germany, UK, Switzerland,
Ireland, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden,
Russia, Japan, China, Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong,
Thailand, Viet Nam, Pakistan, Singapore, India, Australia,
USA, Canada, Algeria, Egypt, Cameroon and South Africa
representing Europe, Asia, North America and Africa
(Table 1). These nucleotide sequences were then adjusted
for NS4A gene region using BioEdit software http://www.
mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html and isolated H77 as a
reference sequence http://www.hcvdb.org/gene_detail.asp?
gene_id=64592. Amino acid sequences were deduced
for these sequences using EXPASY protein translate
tool http://expasy.org/tools/dna.html. The amino acid
sequences were then fed to CLC sequence viewer 6 http://
www.clcbio.com/index.php?id=28 for Multiple Sequence
Alignment (MSA) to be performed. CLC sequence a
viewer 6 is freely available software.
First of all MSA was performed for 56 sequences from
genotype 3 subtype 3a. After that single MSA was done
for all the 346 sequences. Then MSA was performed for
73 sequences from genotype 1 subtype 1b and 3
sequences from genotype 1 subtype 1c. Furthermore,
MSA was performed for the 73 sequences from genotype
1 subtype 1b with 64 sequences from genotype 1 subtype
1a, 35 sequences from genotype 5, 37 sequences from
genotype 4, 58 sequences from genotype 3 and 58
sequences from genotype 2 respectively. Finally a single
phylogenetic tree was constructed for all the 346
sequences using UPGMA method using CLC sequence
software http://www.clcbio.com/index.php?id=28.

Results
NS4A protein HCV genotype 3a

Total of 56 different amino acid sequences that were
reported from different parts of the world for NS4A protein genotype 3 subtype 3a were analyzed through Multiple
Sequence Alignment. Out of 56 sequences that were
observed 41 sequences had same amino acid sequence as
shown in Figure 1, where dots show similarity and Roman
letters shows amino acid substitutions relative to the
sequence 1 (PK/FG3). PK/FG3 isolate used as a reference
sequence was isolated from local Pakistani population.
These 41 sequences which show same amino acid
sequence for NS4A protein of HCV genotype 3a have been
reported from different parts of the world i.e. Pakistan,
France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium,
Australia and United States of America, representing 4 different continents of the world i.e. Asia, Europe, Australia
and North America. Different amino acid substitutions F6,
V 13 , I 20 , S 22 , E 32 , R 32 , R 41 and R 46 were observed in
sequences 42-56 relative to sequence 1. These results

indicate relatively conserved nature of NS4A protein at
genotype level and may help in performing evolutionary
studies with HCV.
Amino Acid sequence comparison of NS4A protein of
different HCV genotypes

Multiple Sequence Alignment of NS4A protein of HCV
genotype 3a provided useful information about its conserved nature. These results indicated that both the conserved nature and occasional amino acid substitution in
the NS4A protein might provide useful information about
origin of HCV in humans. So we compared amino acid
composition of NS4A protein of different HCV genotypes
through Multiple Sequence Alignment. Single MSA was
performed for all 346 sequences included in this study
(data not shown) and amino acid substitutions were critically analyzed in all HCV genotypes. We observed amino
acid substitutions in genotype 1b that were consistent
members of NS4A protein of different HCV genotypes. So
we analyzed and compared sequences of genotype 1b with
sequences from different HCV genotypes and subtypes.

NS4A protein HCV genotype 1b and 1c

A total of 72 sequences for NS4A protein HCV genotype
1 subtype 1b and 3 sequences for subtype 1c were compared through Multiple Sequence Alignment as shown in
the Figure 2. Genotype 1b sequences included in this
study were reported from France, Switzerland, United
States of America, Japan, Germany, China, Sweden,
Korea, Ireland, Australia and Russia while genotype 1c
sequences were reported from Indonesia and India.
Sequences 1 to 22 have same amino acid sequence with
no amino acid substitution. These 22 sequences were
reported from France, Switzerland, Japan and USA, indicating the relatively conserved nature of NS4A protein.
Sequences 23 to 38 have 6 different single amino acid
substitutions C22, V30, R34, I37, V38 and Q46 (Roman letters
and numbers indicate specific amino acids and their position in the NS4A protein respectively). Sequence 39 to 51
shows double amino acid substitutions in which the
already observed 6 different single amino acid substitutions
were combined in pairs and in different combinations. In
sequences 52 and 53 another amino acid substitution Q47

was found coupled with the already observed substitution
Q46. Sequences 54 to 64 have three amino acid substitutions in each sequence where the already observed substitutions were found in different combinations except for a
new substitution V29 in sequence 63. Sequences 65 to 71

have four different amino acid substitutions in each
sequence while sequence 72 has five different substitutions
C22, R34, I37, V38 and Q46. So the overall concept we get
here is that 6 different kinds of single amino acids substitution that were found from sequences 23 to 38 were

Sarwar et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:317
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/317

somehow combined in different combinations while on the
other hand further amino acid substitutions like Q47 and
V29 were introduced as the NS4A protein of genotype 1
subtype 1b evolved.
NS4A protein of genotype 1 subtype 1c closely resembles the NS4A protein of subtype 1b as shown in Figure 2.
Sequence 74 shows that NS4A protein of genotype 1 subtype 1c evolved when T19 in NS4A protein genotype 1
subtype 1b was substituted to S19. G32 is another amino
acid that we observed in subtype 1c sequences 74 and 75
but not in any of the 72 sequences of the subtype 1b.
NS4A protein HCV genotype 1a

MSA was performed for 64 different sequences of NS4A
protein genotype 1 subtype 1a with 72 sequences from
genotype 1 subtype 1b and the file that was generated is
shown in Figure 3, for convenience only one sequence
for genotype 1b is shown. Genotype 1a sequences that
are included in this study were reported from France,
UK, Japan, USA, Australia, Switzerland, Singapore and
Canada. We observed that C22 and V30 that were introduced as occasional amino acid substitutions in NS4A
protein of genotype1b are consistent members of NS4A
protein of genotype 1 subtype 1a. R34, I37, V38 and Q46
that emerged as single amino acid substitutions in NS4A
protein of genotype 1b are also present in different
sequences of genotype 1a. S19 amino acid which was also
observed in genotype 1c sequences is a consistent member of genotype 1a NS4A protein. The overall similarity
represented in the form of dots, the presence of C22 and
V30 as consistent members, the presence of V29, R34, I37,
V 38 and Q 46 amino acids which originally emerged at
genotype 1b level clearly indicates that NS4A protein of
genotype 1a evolved later as compared to NS4A protein
of genotype 1b.
NS4A protein HCV genotype 5

MSA for 35 different sequences of NS4A protein of genotype 5 was performed with 72 sequences form genotype 1
subtype 1b. Genotype 5 sequences that are included in
this study were reported from France, Belgium, USA,
South Africa, Algeria, UK and Spain. MSA results for
genotype 5 sequences are shown in Figure 4 and for simplicity only one sequence from genotype 1b is shown.
Comparative analysis of genotype 1b and genotype 5
sequences (Figure 4) shows that L 10 , T 20 and V 24 of
NS4A protein genotype 1b has been replaced by V10, V20
and A24 respectively in NS4A protein of genotype 5. Q46
and Q 47 are the amino acids that were introduced as
amino acid substitutions in genotype 1b sequences has
been retained as more consistent members in genotype 5
sequences. R 34 and I37 amino acids are also present in
different sequences of genotype 1b and 5. We propose
that NS4A protein of genotype 5 evolved when V10, V20

Page 6 of 19

and A24 amino acid substitutions were introduced into
NS4A protein sequences of genotype 1b (sequences 52 to
58 in Figure 2).
NS4A protein HCV genotype 4

MSA was performed for 37 different sequences of NS4A
protein genotype 4 with 72 sequences form genotype 1
subtype 1b. Genotype 4 sequences included in this study
were reported from USA, Egypt, UK, Spain, France, Indonesia, Cameroon and Portugal. Some of the sequences for
genotype 1b that were reported from African patients in
Canada are also included in this study. MSA results are
shown in Figure 5 and for simplicity only one sequence
from genotype 1b is shown.V29, V30, Q46 and Q47 amino
acids that emerged as amino acid substitutions in NS4A
protein sequences of genotype 1b can be seen to be present more consistently in NS4A protein of genotype 4.
I37 amino acid can also be seen in some sequences. Q34
amino acid has been observed to be present consistently
in NS4A protein sequences of genotype 4 only. S19 and
V20 are the other amino acids that are present more consistently in NS4A protein sequences of genotype 4 but
not in the sequences that we had observed for genotype
1b. Other amino acids occurring less frequently are also
shown in Figure 5.
NS4A protein HCV genotype 6

Thirty amino acid sequences for NS4A protein genotype
6 were uploaded to the CLC software and MSA was performed with 72 sequences from genotype 1 subtype 1b.
Genotype 6 sequences that were included in this study
were reported from Hong Kong, UK, France, China,
Japan, Thailand and Viet Nam. Results for this alignment
are shown in Figure 6, for convenience only one
sequence from genotype 1b is shown. It is clear from the
figure that C22, Q46 and Q47 are present as more consistent members of NS4A protein sequences of genotype 6.
These amino acids emerged as amino acid substitutions
in NS4A protein of genotype 1b. V38 amino acid present
in different sequences of genotype 6 also emerged in genotype 1b sequences. S19, V20, C26, T30, T31, T32, I43 are
the amino acids that are present in different sequences of
genotype 6 but not in the 72 sequences we observed for
genotype 1b. Some other amino acids shown in Figure 6
are also present in genotype 6 sequences but they occur
less consistently.
NS4A protein HCV genotype 3

MSA was performed for 58 sequences of NS4A protein
of genotype 3 and 72 sequences from genotype 1b. Genotype 3 sequences included in this study were reported
from Pakistan, France, UK, Switzerland, Australia, USA,
Germany, Belgium, Japan, Singapore, Denmark, Indonesia and India. Results for this alignment are shown in

Phylogenetic Analysis

NS4A protein HCV genotype 2

58 sequences for NS4A protein genotype 2 that were
reported from Japan, UK, USA, Indonesia, and Viet
Nam were included in this study. MSA was performed
for 58 sequences from genotype 2 and 72 sequences
from genotype 1b for NS4A protein. Results are shown
in Figure 8, for convenience only one sequence for genotype 1b is shown. C22 is the amino acid that appeared
as occasional substitution in NS4A protein of genotype
1b but is more frequent member of NS4A protein
sequences from genotype 2. K41 is a frequent member
of genotype 2 and genotype 3 sequences. NS4A protein
sequences from genotype 2 differs the most from

Phylogenetic tree was constructed for 346 sequences of
NS4A protein representing so far known HCV genotypes
using CLC sequence viewer software and through

Figure 9, 10, 11, 12 (A single Phylogenetic tree was constructed but for convenience it has been shown in four different figures and these figures should be considered in
continuation from Figure 9, 10, 11, 12). UPGMA method
assumes that evolution has occurred at a constant rate in
the different lineages and that is why root of the tree can
also be estimated. For bootstrap analysis the default value
of 100 was used. Bootstrap values are attached to each
branch. Genotype 1b sequences occupy the root of the

tree and sequences from the individual genotypes are clustered together in the tree which clearly demonstrates that
NS4A protein of different HCV genotypes originally
evolved from NS4A protein of genotype 1b.

Discussion
NS4A gene (Accession no. HM135518 and isolate name
PK/FG3) that we had isolated, sequenced and reported
to the Gen Bank from a Pakistani patient chronically
infected with HCV genotype 3a showed 100% homology
on protein blast available at NCBI with many sequences
reported from United Kingdom. This was an amazing
observation as HCV is known for a high mutation rate
but still NS4A protein reported from Pakistani and UK
populations show such a high similarity at amino acid
level. These Blast results prompted us to investigate the

conserved nature of NS4A protein across different
regions of the world.
Our results in Figure 1 clearly shows that Hepatitis C
virus genotype 3a is widespread to the four different continents of the world but it still retained same amino acid
sequence for NS4A protein despite high mutation rate in
HCV genome. The relatively conserved nature of NS4A
protein indicates that the original NS4A protein, which
was part of HCV polyprotein when it first established itself
in humans, might have been passed on in its dormant
form to the present day HCV and its sequence might have
been reported to sequence databases. And by comparing
the amino acid composition of NS4A protein of different
HCV genotypes, the occasional amino acid substitutions
that we had observed might help us to investigate its
identity.

The conserved nature of NS4A protein has two
important implications. First when amino acid substitutions are introduced into this protein, there is a considerable chance that they will be retained in future
progenies. And secondly, some of these amino acid substitutions may travel a long distance across different
HCV genotypes. By locating such amino acid substitutions and following them across different HCV genotypes, might help us identify the genotypes that evolved
earlier or later in HCV evolution. Our study suggests
that C22, Q46 and Q47 are three very important amino
acid substitutions that were introduced into NS4A protein of genotype 1b early in HCV evolution. Amino acid
composition analysis of NS4A protein of different HCV
genotypes shows that at least one of the three amino
acids is a consistent member of NS4A of the all other
known HCV genotypes. C22 is a more consistent member of NS4A protein sequences of genotype 1a, genotype
6, genotype 3 and genotype 2. Q46 and Q47 amino acids
are more consistent members of NS4A protein

sequences of genotype 5, genotype 4, genotype 6 and
genotype 3. V29, V30 and V38 are the other three important amino acid substitutions introduced into NS4A
protein of genotype 1b. V30 is a consistent member of
NS4A protein sequences of genotype 1a, V29 and V30
are more consistent members of genotype 4 sequences
and V 38 is more consistent member of genotype 3
sequences.
Previous studies that were performed to understand
HCV evolution and to classify different genotypes used
nucleotide sequences [5,6,19,20]. We have used amino
acid sequences in this study because sequence divergence is very high in HCV at nucleotide level due to
error-prone nature of its polymerase. For the study of
evolutionary history and origin of new subtypes of HCV
there is a need of consistent system. We used amino
acid substitution in individual genotypes and subtypes of
HCV for the study of origin and evolution. Suzuki and
Nei used amino acid sequences to study the origin and
evolution of Influenza virus [7]. Furthermore previous

studies used 5UTR, Core/E1 and or NS5B gene regions
[6,19,21,22]. While on the other hand we have used
relatively conserved NS4A protein sequences which can
better predict the picture of evolution. Previous studies
used ClustalW for Multiple Sequence Alignment, we
have used CLC software that automatically arranges
sequences on the basis of sequence similarity. Furthermore, CLC software allows the movement of individual
sequences up and down in the MSA file that is generated. So we can arrange sequences in different orders
and look for different patterns of amino acid substitutions that may emerge.
We have identified different amino acids as consistent members in different HCV genotypes that we did
not observed in our NS4A protein sequences from
genotype 1b. We believe that these amino acids were
introduced later as HCV evolved with time. T 19 and
S 32 amino acids in genotype 1b sequences have been
replaced by S 19 and G 32 in genotype 1c sequences
respectively. T 19 of genotype 1b sequences has been
replaced by S19 in genotype 1a sequences. L10, T20 and
V 24 in genotype 1b sequences have been replaced by
V10, V20 and A24 in genotype 5 sequences respectively.
Genotype 4 sequences have S 19 , V 20 and Q 34 amino
acids as more consistent members while genotype 1b
sequences have T 19 , S 32 and K 34 amino acids. Genotype 6 and genotype 3 sequences also have S19 and V20
amino acids similar to genotype 4 sequences. T30 and
T 32 are also members of genotype 6 sequences but
these are less consistent members compared to S19 and
V20 amino acids. R28, I30, S32, V37, K41, F48 in genotype
1b sequences has been replaced by H28, E30, G32, L37,
K 41 , Y 48 in genotype 3 sequences. Genotype 2 shows
highest diversity from genotype 1b sequences in terms
of amino acid composition and is indicated in Figure
8. The overall similarity of genotype 1b sequences with
other genotypes denoted by dots (Figure 2 to Figure
8), the occasional amino acid substitutions in genotype
1b and their presence as more consistent members in
sequences of other known genotypes and presence of
further substitutions that we just discussed shows that
NS4A protein of the other so far known HCV genotypes originally evolved from NS4A protein of genotype 1b.
To further confirm our results phylogenetic analysis
was performed by constructing a single phylogenetic tree
using UPGMA method as shown in Figure 9, 10, 11, 12.
Many studies related to HCV classification and evolution
has used UPGMA method for constructing phylogenetic
tree [23-25]. NS4A protein sequences from genotype 1b
occupied the root of the phylogenetic tree. Sequences
from individual genotypes were clustered together in the
tree which indicates that our constructed tree is in accordance with current classification system which is based

Page 17 of 19

on nucleotide sequence analysis of 5TUR, Core/E1 and
NS5B gene regions. This also shows the importance of
NS4A protein as a phylogenetic marker of HCV history
and UPGMA as a relevant method for tree construction.
Both amino acid composition analysis and our phylogenetic tree indicates that genotype 2 differ the most from
genotype 1b than any other HCV genotype. Based on the
above mentioned observations it is now easy to generalize
that HCV genotype 1b established itself earlier in humans
and that all other known HCV genotypes evolve later as
result of mutations in genotype 1b. We propose that the
following amino acid sequence (Figure 2, Sequence 1 to
22) might have been sequence of the NS4A protein
which was part of HCV polyprotein when it first infected
humans.

Some of the genotype 6 variants reported from Southeast Asia have 5’UTR sequences identical to those of genotype 1b and 1a [26-29]. At nucleotide level, 5’UTR is the
most conserved region in HCV genome and these reports
support our results. Few of the HCV genomic sequences
reported from Russia have structural genes similar to
genotype 2 and non-structural genes similar to genotype
1b [30,31], which according to our findings is the parent
HCV genotype. Another genomic sequence reported
from Peru has structural genes similar to genotype 1a
and non-structural genes similar to genotype 1b [32].
These sequences have been classified as recombinants
because it is believed that these sequences were generated as a result of recombination events between different HCV genotypes [30-32]. It is well documented that
HCV target structural genes like E1 and E2 for mutation
to avoid immune responses [33,34]. There is a possibility
that these recombinant genotypes evolved as result of
much higher mutation rate than normal in the structural
region and lower mutation rate in non-structural regions
and not as a result of recombination events. This much
higher mutation rate could be due to high pressure on
HCV from immune system in certain individuals. But
much work needs to be done to establish facts regarding
recombinants genotypes and our discovery will have a
role to play in that regard.

Conclusion
This work highlights the significance of NS4A protein as
phylogenetic marker in studies related to origin and
evolution of HCV. Amino acid substitution and phylogenetic analysis of NS4A protein sequences of different
HCV genotypes shows that NS4A protein of the so far
known HCV genotypes evolved from NS4A protein of
HCV genotype 1b. This implies that genotype 1b established itself earlier in humans and that all other known

HCV genotypes evolved later as a result of mutations in
HCV genotype 1b.
