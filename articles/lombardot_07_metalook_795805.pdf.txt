Abstract
Background: Marine ecological genomics can be defined as the application of genomic sciences
to understand the structure and function of marine ecosystems. In this field of research, the analysis
of genomes and metagenomes of environmental relevance must take into account the
corresponding habitat (contextual) data, e.g. water depth, physical and chemical parameters. The
creation of specialised software tools and databases is requisite to allow this new kind of integrated
analysis.
Results: We implemented the MetaLook software for visualisation and analysis of marine
ecological genomic and metagenomic data with respect to habitat parameters. MetaLook offers a
three-dimensional user interface to interactively visualise DNA sequences on a world map, based
on a centralised georeferenced database. The user can define environmental containers to organise
the sequences according to different habitat criteria. To find similar sequences, the containers can
be queried with either genes from the georeferenced database or user-imported sequences, using
the BLAST algorithm. This allows an interactive assessment of the distribution of gene functions in
the environment.
Conclusion: MetaLook allows scientists to investigate sequence data in their environmental
context and to explore correlations between genes and habitat parameters. This software is a step
towards the creation of specialised tools to study constrained distributions and habitat specificity
of genes correlated with specific processes.
MetaLook is available at: http://www.megx.net/metalook

Background
The cost reduction and high-throughput automation of
DNA sequencing over the last years have had a profound

impact on the field of microbial ecology, giving birth to
the field of ecological genomics. Ecological genomics can
be defined as the application of genomic sciences to

understand the structure and function of marine ecosystems. This field of research is focussed on the investigation
of environmentally relevant microorganisms taken from
their natural habitats. The sequencing of the genomes of
such organisms, especially the new wave of ecological
metagenomics, in which DNA sequences are directly
retrieved from the environment without prior cultivation,
produces huge amounts of new proteins, which theoretically reflect the prominent metabolic processes in the
environment [1,2].
Nevertheless, the functional potential coded in the DNA
sequences can be successfully interpreted only if considered in their ecological context. Currently, general-purpose DNA databases, as provided by the International
Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC
[3]), store only limited environmental contextual (meta)information with the sequences, if any. Exact geographic
origins and the corresponding on-site physical and chemical parameters are rarely found in these databases. This
clearly hinders integrated ecological interpretations and
limits the extraction of biological knowledge from raw
sequence data. With the increasing awareness of this issue
[1] and the introduction of new organisms and samplecentric contextual (meta)-data standards, such as those
proposed by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC)
[4,5], this is likely to change in the future. Furthermore,
genomic and metagenomic sequence data can be supplemented by information extraction from the literature for
proper georeferencing. In parallel, new specialised database architectures and software tools for data visualisation
and interpretation are needed [6], enabling the representation of sequence and habitat data in a geographic information system [7,8]. Here we introduce MetaLook, a 3D
visualisation software allowing browsing and interpretation of marine sequence data in their ecological context.

Implementation
Database server
Genomes and metagenomes from marine environments
were selected for import from the NCBI databases [9] into
a local PostgreSQL/PostGIS database [10], according to
the following criteria: i) the DNA sequence must be of
marine bacterial or archaeal origin; ii) sequence quality
must be high (i.e. sequencing coverage of at least eight
fold); iii) marker and single genes are rejected; and iv) the
geographic origin of the DNA sequences must be known
precisely (e.g. from the original publication). Lower quality sequences (draft genomes and short metagenomics
reads) will be included in future releases.

Geographic locations were stored in our database for
accepted DNA samples. Moreover, on-site contextual
(meta-)data, such as physical and chemical parameters at
the sampling site, were retrieved manually from the origi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/406

nal publications and additional web pages when available. This manual curation step is crucial in order to
reliably link on-site contextual data to DNA sequences.
Moreover, having the exact geographic position for each
sample in our database allows the interpolation of environmental parameters from worldwide data sets. Currently, the following global oceanic physical and chemical
parameters are integrated into our database from the
WOA data set (World Ocean Atlas): temperature, nitrate,
phosphate, oxygen and silicate concentration, as well as
salinity [11].
Java 3D-based client
The MetaLook interface is a locally running client based
on the Java 3D API [12], started using the Java Web Start
technology from the megx.net data portal [7]. The starting
point of the interface is a 3D workbench displaying a
world map with the sampling sites of genomic and
metagenomic studies available in our database (Fig. 1).
The 3D approach allows displaying larger amounts of
data and interconnections than a classical 2D visualisation [13]. Within MetaLook, the user can sort the corresponding DNA sequence data into so-called environmental
containers, which are flexible entities grouping data
according to specific criteria, such as habitat types, ocean
water depth or physical and chemical parameters. This
custom data classification allows the user to define ecological niches according to specific biological questions
(Fig. 2). The DNA sequence fragments grouped into the
containers can be visualised on the workbench for browsing and comparing (Fig. 3). Moreover, each container can
be searched for specific genes based on their annotations.

The environmental containers in MetaLook
Figure 2
The environmental containers in MetaLook. DNA sequences of genomes and metagenomes can be sorted into 3D containers according to habitat information such as e.g. water column vs. sediments, depth profile or physical-chemical parameters. The geographic origins of the DNA sequence samples in each container are shown on the world map.

Search results are shown graphically in their genomic context. The DNA or protein sequence of each gene can be displayed or easily downloaded from the database. All DNA
sequences in a container can be downloaded in batch
mode. Custom sequences can be imported into the MetaLook interface in FASTA format.
BLAST against environmental containers
Any protein encoding gene from our georeferenced database or user-imported sequences can be used as a query
for a BLASTP run [14] against the genes grouped into userdefined environmental containers. The BLASTP analysis is
started from the MetaLook interface (client) and runs on
the centralised server. The results are shown graphically
using 3D connectors between the query gene and the containers with sequence matches (Fig. 4). This representation reveals the distribution of similar genes in the userdefined habitats. The results are saved in a result panel for
detailed investigation, showing the habitat parameters of

each match, the corresponding BLASTP e-value, and
sequence alignment (Fig. 5a, b).
Comparison to other programs
Some interesting DNA sequence tools making use of 3D
are currently available. Sockeye is a 3D environment for
comparative genomics allowing simultaneous visualisation of the annotations of different eukaryotic organisms
[15]. The Correlogo server is a tool to display DNA
sequence alignments using 3D sequence logos [16]. The
Walrus graph visualisation tool allows visualisation of
very large phylogenetic trees in a hyperbolic space [17].
These examples show the benefits of advanced visualisation tools for DNA research and the management of large
data sets. However, within this context, MetaLook is
unique in its orientation toward environmental genomics, geographic and contextual data integration.

Results and Discussion
The MetaLook interface allows the sorting of sequence
data according to sampling sites and habitat parameters,
with respect to targeted biological questions. The distribution of genes in the environment is revealed using the
BLAST algorithm with a selected query gene against other
sequences sorted in environmental containers. The following examples illustrate some expected and unexpected
habitat distributions of genes in the environment using
the MetaLook interface.
Methanogenesis genes (mch and mcr)
In microorganisms, methanogenesis is a form of microbial anaerobic respiration leading to the formation of
methane. Recent experimental and genomic data support
the hypothesis that anaerobic oxidation of methane
(AOM) is using a reverse-methanogenesis pathway [1820]. Such biochemical processes are crucial in the environment, as methane is an important greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. One of the key genes of

methanogenesis and AOM is mcr, encoding a methylcoenzyme-M reductase (Mcr). The distribution of mcr in
the environment was visualised by MetaLook with the following steps: i) predefined environmental containers were
created from the world map, grouping sediment and
water samples by depth (Fig. 2); ii) a text search for the
gene "mcr" was performed; iii) Mcr protein sequences
(e.g. McrB, [Genbank: AAB98847]) were blasted against
all containers (BLASTP, e-value cut-off 10-10). The results
show that within the georeferenced marine bacteria and
archaea currently available in our database, genes encoding Mcr are only found in sediments. Although expected,
this observation shows that mcr genes are habitat specific,
which is consistent with the strictly anaerobic nature of
methanogenesis and the AOM process.
Another key gene of the methanogenesis and AOM processes is mch, encoding a methenyl-tetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase (Mch). Interestingly, this gene was
reported in some proteobacteria and planctomycetes,

where an archaea-like C1 metabolism appears to be
present [21]. Following the same procedure used for mcr
(see above) revealed, as expected, that the mch gene is not
only present in genomes and metagenomes originating
from sediments, but is also found in the genome of at
least one sea water column bacterium, the planctomycete
Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1T from the Baltic Sea [22] (e.g.
[GenBank: CAD74990]). Furthermore, this analysis
showed that mch is also found in the high-throughput
metagenomics data set of the Sargasso Sea [23], suggesting
an even more widespread distribution of this gene in the
environment. Hence, the analysis of the habitat specificity
of mcr and mch revealed differential environmental distribution of genes relevant for major biochemical processes
involved in the global cycling of carbon.
Photolyase gene (phr)
Solar UV-light induces pyrimidine dimers in genomic
material, leading to enhanced mutation rates. Photolyases

are proteins involved in a light-dependant, single-step
DNA repair mechanisms, which protect microorganisms
against this destructive effect [24]. Comparative analysis
of the genomes of three Prochlorococcus marinus strains,
one of the most abundant phototrophic prokaryote in the
ocean, previously reported the presence of photolyase
encoding genes (phr) in the high-light ecotype, and its
absence in the low-light ecotypes (water depth: 5 m and
120/135 m, respectively) [25]. This finding suggests that
for this particular species, the phr gene is lost if an organism is exposed to little or no UV-light. As no DNA pyrimidine dimers should form where no UV-light stress occurs,
the phr gene is not expected in the deep layers of the
ocean.
To systematically test the occurrence of the phr gene in the
marine environment, a phr gene with experimental evidence (Escherichia coli K-12, [Swiss-Prot: P00914]) was
imported into the MetaLook interface and searched

against predefined environmental containers with the
BLASTP algorithm (e-value cut-off 10-10). Some sequence
hits in the top layers of the ocean were found, as expected
(e.g. Prochlorococcus marinus MED4,[Genbank:CAE18744]
and Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1T, [Genbank: CAD77347]).
Moreover, unexpected sequences from deep-sea water
(hot vent) and coastal sediments were also hit by this
analysis (Idiomarina loihiensis L2TR,
[GenBank: AAV82228] and Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396,
[GenBank: ABC28582]) [26,27] (Fig. 3). These genes are
likely to be functional, with full-length BLASTP alignments and excellent statistical support, with e-values
below 10-100 (Fig. 4a, b). Such unexpected occurrence of
genes encoding photolyases in these environments might
be explained by: i) the presence of allochthonous organisms [28], ii) residual phr genes awaiting deletion in

organisms recently adapted to deep-sea or sediment environments, or iii) the possible need for protective mechanisms against geothermal light, even if the dominant
wavelengths are not in the UV range [29].
Future work
The availability of worldwide physical and chemical
parameters linked to DNA sequences opens the way to
multivariate analysis. This approach will be crucial as
more georeferenced genomic and metagenomic samples
become available. The integration of low quality
sequences (e.g. single reads from metagenomics) and biodiversity markers (e.g. ribosomal RNA genes) in our geographic-centric system is also a follow-up perspective.

Conclusion

Competing interests

Marine ecological genomics is an emerging field of
research but available high quality and accurately georeferenced sequence data are still sparse compared to the natural habitat and organism diversity. Therefore, the
observed absence of genes in particular habitats may
reflect a mere gap in the database coverage. However, with
the use of appropriate software tools, common knowledge can be easily confirmed and unexpected findings can
be obtained for further investigation, as shown here with
the example of a light-dependant gene present in the
deep-sea. As more sequences with rich contextual (meta-)
data from marine genome and metagenome projects are
released, the accuracy and reliability of correlations
between gene occurrence and habitat parameters will continuously improve. Targeted studies of gene distribution
in the environment are greatly facilitated by our specialised databases and software tools presented here, offering
an advanced software workbench for biologists.

The author(s) declares that there are no competing interests.
