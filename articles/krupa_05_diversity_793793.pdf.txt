Abstract
Background: Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases (STYKs) commonly found in eukaryotes have been recently
reported in many bacterial species. Recent studies elucidating their cellular functions have
established their roles in bacterial growth and development. However functions of a large number
of bacterial STYKs still remain elusive. The organisation of domains in a large dataset of bacterial
STYKs has been investigated here in order to recognise variety in domain combinations which
determine functions of bacterial STYKs.
Results: Using sensitive sequence and profile search methods, domain organisation of over 600
STYKs from 125 prokaryotic genomes have been examined. Kinase catalytic domains of STYKs
tethered to a wide range of enzymatic domains such as phosphatases, HSP70, peptidyl prolyl
isomerases, pectin esterases and glycoproteases have been identified. Such distinct preferences for
domain combinations are not known to be present in either the Histidine kinase or the eukaryotic
STYK families. Domain organisation of STYKs specific to certain groups of bacteria has also been
noted in the current anlaysis. For example, Hydrophobin like domains in Mycobacterial STYK and
penicillin binding domains in few STYKs of Gram-positive organisms and FHA domains in
cyanobacterial STYKs. Homologues of characterised substrates of prokaryotic STYKs have also
been identified.
Conclusion: The domains and domain architectures of most of the bacterial STYKs identified are
very different from the known domain organisation in STYKs of eukaryotes. This observation
highlights distinct biological roles of bacterial STYKs compared to eukaryotic STYKs. Bacterial
STYKs reveal high diversity in domain organisation. Some of the modular organisations conserved
across diverse bacterial species suggests their central role in bacterial physiology. Unique domain
architectures of few other groups of STYKs reveal recruitment of functions specific to the species.

Background
Extracellular signals perceived by the cells invoke an
appropriate intracellular response triggering cascades of
events that alter the activities of various signalling molecules. The variations in functional states of the proteins

are brought about by covalent and non-covalent molecular interactions. Intracellular signalling in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes is often achieved by phosphorylation of target
proteins. The phosphorylated proteins undergo changes
in their three-dimensional (3-D) shapes resulting in

altered functional states. Phosphorylation events also lead
to changes in the electrostatic interactions and ionisation
states of residues at the catalytic site as exemplified by regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenases and HMG-CoA
reductase [1,2]. Covalent attachment of the phosphoryl
groups to various proteins is catalysed by protein kinases.
These enzymes transfer a phosphate group from adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) onto an acceptor amino acid in a
substrate protein. The acceptor groups on amino acid residues could be alcoholic as in Ser and Thr, phenolic group
as in tyrosine or basic amino acid such as histidine (Nπ or
Nτ), arginine (guanidino group), and the ε-NH2 group of
lysine, carboxyl groups of aspartate and glutamate or thiol
group of cysteine [3,4]. In addition to nucleoside triphosphates as donors of the phosphate groups, certain class of
phosphorylating enzymes makes use of either phosphoenzyme intermediates or low molecular weight metabolites such as phosphoenol pyruvate, acetyl phosphate or
carbamoyl phosphates and polyphosphates as donors [57].
Despite the occurrences of various phosphorylating
enzymes, cellular signalling mechanisms are dependent
on a subset of the list of enzymes mentioned above, for
intra-cellular communications. In eubacteria and archaea,
two component signal transduction systems [8], also
referred to as His-Asp phospho-relay systems, mediate
adaptive responses to changes in environmental conditions. The two-component system is composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a cognate regulatory protein
referred to as a response regulator (RR). HKs consist of an
ATP-binding kinase domain and the H-box domain carrying the histidine which is the site of phosphorylation. HKs
have also been identified in eukaryotes, such as yeast,
Neurospora and Arabidopsis thaliana, and their functional
roles have been studied [9,10].
However, in eukaryotes, Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases play a key
role in cellular signal transduction. The Ser/Thr and Tyr
kinases differ completely from the HKs both in sequence
and structure. The Ser/Thr and the Tyr kinase share a common catalytic core of about 270 residues made up of Nterminal lobe consisting of mainly β-strands and a C-terminal lobe composed predominantly of α-helices [11].
The eukaryotes also possess two other distinct classes of
protein kinases, the myosin heavy chain kinase/EF-2
kinase [12] and the mitochondrial protein kinases that
include the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and branchedchain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase [13] that differ from the Ser/Thr kinases in sequence and structure.
Protein phosphorylation is hence considered to have originated independently in prokaryotes and eukaryotes in
order to meet their diverse cellular and environmental
requirements.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/129

However studies on the eukaryotic protein-Ser/Thr/Tyr
kinase like sequences (STYKs) in the prokaryotes emerged
with the identification of proteins phosphorylated on Ser/
Thr and Tyr residues in bacteria [14]. Phosphorylation of
Ser/Thr residues in archaeal proteins has also been
reported for Sulfolobus acidocaldarius by earlier studies
[15]. Subsequent identification and characterisation of
genes encoding STYKs in Myxococcus xanthus [16] and
Streptomyces species [17] confirmed the presence of homologues of eukaryotic protein kinases in bacteria. Following
these reports of STYKs, and the release of large number of
bacterial genome sequences, a number of groups have surveyed for the occurrences of STYKs in them [18-22]. Their
surveys suggested the occurrences of significant number of
STYKs in both archaea and eubacterial genomes and they
have been further classified based on their sequence similarity to various subfamilies [19]. A previous study [20]
proposed that the Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases in bacteria
have bacterial origin. Kinase activity in the STYKs has been
demonstrated in a few species. These studies have suggested the involvement of STYKs in secondary metabolism [17], morphology of the aerial hyphae in Streptomyces
granticolor [23], regulation of fruiting body formation in
M.xanthus [24]. STYKs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [25,26] are shown to be critical for
progression of infection and expression of virulence factors during certain stages of infection. The role of STYKs in
the repression of proline utilisation operon and degradation of proline in S.typhimurium has been suggested [27].
The recently reported 3-D crystal structures of Mycobacterial PKN-B [28,29] has revealed an overall similarity of
their structure to the eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases
with variations in the nucleotide binding regions. The
prokaryotic homologues also include aminoglycoside
kinases which phosphoryate antibiotics, and share remote
sequence similarity with the STYKs. The 3-D fold of their
catalytic domain is highly similar to the structures of
eukaryotic STYKs [30]. Studies on the evolution of STYKs
in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 have proposed the origin of
STYKs before the divergence between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes during evolution [20]. The conservation of
these sequences in significant number of bacterial
genomes despite limitation on their genomic size during
evolution have therefore suggested their functions are
essential in regulation of cellular activities in prokaryotes,
as in their eukaryotic counterparts.
The present analysis is focussed on understanding the biological roles of the prokaryotic STYKs which have been
shown to be encoded by significant number of genes in a
large number of bacterial genomes by various groups. The
present study is based on representative domain architectures of STYKs identified from the completely sequenced
genomes of 125 prokaryotes which includes 35 genomes

compiled in our early version of KinG database [31]. The
domain architectures of STYKs and their homologues in
90 additional genomes included in this paper are recently
added
to
the
KinG
database
http://hodg
kin.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~king.
About 600 STYKs and their homologues have been identified in the current study in 125 bacterial genomes, of
complete genomic data, using various sequence and profile search methods. Manual analysis of each of these
STYKs and homologues has been made in order to check
for the presence or absence of residues known to be critical for the activity of eukaryotic protein kinases. Using
profile based search method (See Materials and Methods)
the extent of similarity of bacterial homologues with different subfamilies of eukaryotic protein kinases has been
analysed. The analysis suggests that the bacterial homologues form a distinct class of protein kinases as indicated
by the highest similarity (20–30% sequence identity) of
their catalytic kinase domain with the generic kinase profiles rather than any individual subfamily profile of
eukaryotic protein kinases. i.e., the percent sequence identities of bacterial kinases with specific sub-families of
eukaryotic STYKs is lower.
During the course of current analysis we encountered
lipopolysaccharide kinases (LPSKs) which are well known
for their remote relationship with STYKs [32]. RIO1 class
of STYKs have been previously identified in eukaryotes
[33,34] and in archaea [19] and our earlier work reported
the occurrence of RIO1 proteins in all the three major taxons namely, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota [32].
The domain organisation of STYKs identified from various genomes has been studied in an attempt to understand their probable biological roles. Groups of STYKs
conserved only among specific classes of bacteria have
been identified. Diverse domain arrangements observed
in bacterial STYKs are radically different from those
observed in eukaryotic Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases and prokaryotic HKs. These domain arrangements unique to bacterial
STYKs are therefore suggestive of their functional roles distinct from that of other well-known families of protein
kinases. Consideration of known functions of domains
tethered to catalytic kinase domain of bacterial STYKs enabled obtaining clues about gross functional roles of various bacterial STYKs. Involvement of STYKs in stress
response, protein folding, extensive protein-protein interactions and sugar transport has been suggested by covalent tethering of catalytic kinase domains of STYKs with
other enzyme and non-enzyme modules. Homologues of
bacterial PKs that have been previously well characterised
in terms of biochemical activity and function have also
been identified in the study. Putative substrates for a small
set of bacterial STYKs have also been identified based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/129

their similarity to bacterial kinases with well characterised
substrates.

Results
The STYK-like sequences have been identified in various
completely sequenced bacterial genomes and have been
analysed for the occurrence of other functional domains.
The domains have been identified using different profile
search methods with stringent search parameters as
described in the section on Materials and Methods and have
also been manually checked for the conservation of key
motifs. It should be noted that we have used stringent evalue cut-off of 10-8 and 0.01 respectively in the PSSM
(Position Specific Scoring Matrix) matching and HMM
(Hidden Markov Model) matching procedures. All the
functional domain assignments discussed below are
detected within the e-value limit of 0.01 by HMMER and
are ensured, manually, that there is no obvious erroneous
domain assignment.
Distribution of the STYKs and STYK-like sequences in
bacterial genomes
The data set of bacterial genomes considered in the current analysis includes predicted ORFs from the genomes
of sixteen archaeal and 109 bacterial genomes representing major division of these prokaryotic phylogenetic
domains. A list of these completed genomes and number
of Protein Kinase-like sequences (PKLS) that includes
STYKs, RIO1 and ABC1-like kinases is given in Table 1.
Table 1 also includes information on number of protein
kinase-like sequences lacking the catalytic base residue
(aspartate) and hence are likely to be non-functional as
kinase. All the archaeal genomes analysed have at least
one STYK, which belongs to the RIO1 family [19]. The
RIO1s share a significant sequence similarity to the
eukaryotic protein kinases and have recently been shown
to possess a Ser/Thr autophosphorylation activity [35].
These RIO1 sequences have been initially observed in
yeast [33,34] and subsequently detected in other eukaryotic genomes as well [36]. We have previously identified
RIO1 like sequences in two of the eubacterial species, Deinococcus radiodurans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [32].

Occurrence of RIO1 in many other eubacterial genomes
has been reported in this paper for the first time. RIO1
sequences have been identified in other bacterial species
including Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Pseudomonas putida,
Pseudomonas syringae, Shewanella oneidensis and Yersinia
pestis. The ubiquitous nature of RIO1 across archaea, bacteria and eukaryota is thus evident. Examination for the
occurrences of HKs among the genome analysed reveal
their absence in significant number of archaeal genomes,
as well as in mycoplasma, Buchnera and Onion yellows phytoplasma genomes.

Domain arrangements in bacterial homologues of
eukaryotic protein kinases
Interactions of multi-modular signalling proteins with
cognate ligands are often mediated by the constituent
modules. The domain organisation of the STYKs has been
analysed extensively by various profile-search and fold
recognition methods described in a later section. The
details of the domain organisation of the bacterial kinases
analysed in this paper have been included in the KinG
database http://hodgkin.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~king[31,37].
Incorporation of information about STYKs in 125
prokaryotic genomes in the KinG database represents a
major update in the database compared to the previous
version with STYKs only from 35 prokaryotic genomes. A
comprehensive study on the domain organisation of the
previously compiled repertoires of STYKs and those
encoded in the additional genomes has been described
here. Modular organisation of STYKs, newly identified in
the current analysis have been listed in Table 2

Influence of the diverse domain composition of STYKs
and their probable biological functions are discussed in
the following sections.
Transmembrane bacterial Ser/Thr kinases
The amino acid sequences of kinase catalytic domains of
bacterial STYKs are generally more similar to eukaryotic
Ser/Thr kinases than the eukaryotic tyrosine kinases. The
profiles of Ser/Thr kinase subfamilies match the bacterial
kinases with better similarity (<1e-32) in contrast to the
tyrosine kinases (>1e-17). However a significant number
of bacterial STYKs contain trans-membrane spanning seg-

ments unlike the eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases. The known
rare exceptions of eukaryotic transmembrane protein with
Ser/Thr kinase domain are TGF-beta receptor and the
IRE1. Trans-membrane STYKs are absent in certain Gramnegative species Haemophilus influenzae, Rickettsiae, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydiae and in the hyperthermophilic
bacteria, Aquifex aeolicus. The Gram-positive species analysed in the data set have at least one trans-membrane
STYKs in them. The presence of significant number of
trans-membrane kinases (TM-kinases) in most bacterial
species suggests many of them could play as receptor like
kinases and are probably involved in direct interaction
with the extra-cellular ligands. Further the TM kinases
with extracellular PASTA (Fig 1i) domain such as PKNB
[28,29] of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are encoded in
diverse groups of Gram-positive bacteria analysed in the
current study. The selective conservation of PASTA
domains in STYKs encoded by Gram-positive bacteria
implies their role in signalling pathways conserved across
diverse Gram positive species. Currently the nature of ligands stimulating the trans-membrane STYKs is not
known.
Archaeal multi-domain STYKs
The multidomain STYKs of archaea include the kinases
with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidases (OSGP)
domain (Fig: 1c) present at the N-terminal of the kinase
domain. The OSGP domains belong to the glycoprotease
family (PFAM00814). The members of this family are
known to cleave proteins that are heavily sialylated on serine or threonine residues. The OSGP containing STYKs
described in earlier studies [19] are also encoded only in

archaeal genomes. The archaeal species with the OSGP
domains in their STYKs include Methanococcus janaschii,
gi|2826367), Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus
(gi|2622538), Halobacterium sp (gi|1058146), and Thermoplasma acidophilum (gi|10639497). OSGP domains of
archaeal STYKs bear highest sequence similarity with the
OSGP domains of the yeast gene product YK18 which is a
putative glyco protease.
Phosphatase associated protein kinases
We report for the first time the tethering of the PP2C
domains with STYK domain in bacteria. This unique class

of STYKs has not been characterised so far. The PP2C like
domains (Fig 1a) are tethered to the N-terminal of kinase
domains in few STYKs encoded in Pseudomonas putida and
Pseudomonas syringae. In addition to the well-characterised
STYK of P.aeruginosa [38] a protein kinase (gi|9947763)
with phosphatase-like domain described above has been
identified in the current study. Earlier studies have
biochemically characterised Stp1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a single domain protein homologous to PP2C [38].
The regulation of Stp1 by its neighbouring gene encoding
the protein kinase Stk1 has been suggested to be similar to
the regulation of phosphatase and Ser/Thr kinases, YopH

and YpkA of Y.pseudotuberculosis that serve as critical virulence determinants. Phosphatase like domain of Pseuodomonas species of the composite STYK shares 35%
identity with Stp1 and about 30% identity with PP2C
domains of Gram positive bacteria.

encoded in the genomes of Mesorhizobium loti, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Nitrosomonas_europaea. Protein
kinases with USPA domains have been recently identified
in STYKs of Arabidopsis thaliana [43] and HisK of bacteria
[44].

Protein kinases associated with nitrate disimilation
A group of STYKs (gi| 7190465, gi|4376414, gi|8978521,
gi|7189538) specifically conserved in different species of
Chlamydiae has a highly conserved C-terminal domain. A
domain family previously referred to as NirV in Conserved Domain Database [39] has been assigned to this Cterminal region (E-58). This homologous domain family
comprises of NirV like proteins, methylase involved in
chemotaxis and sulphatase modifying enzymes and is
referred to as DUF323 (Domain of unknown Function) in
the PFAM database. The crystal structure of DUF323 has
been recently solved [40] for a human homolog of
Formylglycine generating enzyme (pFGE), which is a nonfunctional counter part of human FGE. FGE modifies the
active site residue glycine of the sulphatases. The NirV
domain of the Chlamydial kinases shares a sequence
identity of 37% over a stretch of 100 residues with the
NirV protein from Rhodobacter spaeroides. The NirV gene is
situated in the operon containing two other genes
namely, NirK and ppaZ whose gene products regulate
nitrate dissimilation. The disruption of NirV gene in other
organisms does not affect the nitrate reduction [41].

Protein kinases with protein – protein interaction modules
Protein kinases considered in the analysis have also
revealed their association with domains made up of
repeats that serve as an interface for the interaction of protein modules. An other class of STYKs with PQQ family
repeats have been identified in Deinococcus radiodurans,
Streptomyces avermilitis and Streptomyces coelicolor that have
been described in the greater detail in later section with
respect to their role in regulation of secondary metabolism. The PQQ repeats are known to form β-propeller like
structures similar to WD – repeats that could serve as sites
of interactions with target proteins.

Protein kinases with domains homologous to modules
associated with chaperones
We have identified a protein kinase (gi|32474490) with
C-terminal domain homologous to HSP70 family of proteins in Pirellula species. The HSP70 family includes proteins that act as chaperones and assist the folding of a wide
range of proteins.

Another class of STYKs that are also potentially involved
in interactions with chaperonic proteins has been identified. STYKs with Tetratrico peptide repeats (TPR) have
been identified in a number of bacterial species including
M.tuberculosis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Gloeobacter violaceus, Leptospira interrogans, Nostoc sp., Pirellula, Streptomyces avermitilis, Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus tokodaii.
TPR is known to form a series of anti parallel amphipathic
α-helices that bundle together through hydrophobic
interactions to form a fold with deep concave groove.
They are suggested to bind a number of proteins of regulatory importance such as HSP90 based chaperone system
[42].
Stress-responsive protein kinases
In the current analysis we have identified STYKs (gi|
13475495, gi|27353958 and gi|30180007) with universal
stress induced protein associated (USPA) domain

STYK (gi|9948555) with leucine-rich repeats (LRR) have
also been identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LRRs are
known to serve as protein interaction domains that form
non-globular structures made up repeated ba subunits
[45].
NHL repeats are also identified in two STYKs of M. tuberculosis (gi|2078052) and D.radiodurans (gi|6457717)
which have 6 and 3 repeats following the kinase domain.
They are known to serve as protein interaction surfaces
and some times possess enzymatic activity as exemplified
by the bifunctional peptidyl glycine α-amidylating monoxygenase protein.
Ubiquinone biosynthesis associated protein kinases
Significant number of archaeal and bacterial genomes
encode STYKs with regions most similar to ubiB gene
products flanking the catalytic kinase domain. Ubiquinone, is a critical component of the respiratory chain of
most of organisms. The gene product of ubiB is involved
in the production of an intermediate of Ubiquinone or
the co-enzyme Q [46]. Based on the sequence comparisons, this group of kinases has been predicted to be
involved in the regulation of ubiquinone biosynthesis
[19]. This group of STYKs had been grouped into ABC1
family and was initially believed to have restricted occurrence in archaea [19]. The currently available genomic
data reveals a wider representation of the ABC1 kinases in
significant number of archael species.

They include Halobacterium salinarium, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Methanosarcina acetovirans, Methanosarcina
mazei, Sulfolobus sulfotaricus, Sulfolobus tokadii, Thermoplasma volcanium All the ABC1 kinases encoded in archeal
species analysed in the current study have an N-terminal
ABC1 kinase domain and a putative trans-membrane

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:129

spanning segments at the C_terminal. Thermoplasma acidophilum (gi|10639567) also has an unique ABC1 kinase
with N-terminal RI01 like domain and C-terminal ABC1
Kinase-like domain followed by a putative trans-membrane spanning segment. ABC1 family of STYKs has a
wide representation in large number of bacterial species.
As described before Nitrosomonas europaea encodes a STYK
of ABC1 family that has a N-terminal Usp domain.
Phosphorylation and structural components of bacterial
cells
A set of closely related protein kinases is conserved in
Mycobacterium bovis subsp. bovis AF2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.
This new group of kinases identified in the current analysis has a N-terminal protein kinase domain and a C-terminal hydophobin like regions. The hydrophobins are low
molecular weight cysteine rich proteins that form a critical
component of the hydrophobic sheaths covering the fungal spores.

STYKs conserved among all the Gram-positive bacteria
considered in the current analysis, have a C-terminal
region that is highly similar to the C-terminal region of
high molecular weight penicillin binding proteins. This
domain is believed to play a role in the recognition of Dalanyl D-alanine dipeptides used to build up the peptidoglycan layers and is classified into the family called
PASTA [47] in Pfam database due to their occurrence in
bacterial Ser/Thr protein kinases and penicillin binding
proteins.
Other domain combinations observed in bacterial protein
kinases
A STYK found in the M.tuberculosis (gi|3261694) is comprised of an N-terminal kinase domain followed by C-terminal domain that shares high sequence similarity to
distinct group of ABC transporters, MalT (E-value:10-180).
MalT group of transporters are unique in terms of their
direct participation of the transporter in transcriptional
regulation of mal regulon [48]. These observations suggest
the possible role of the STYK in the regulation of uptake
of sugars. This domain has been observed only in M.tuberculosis STYK and is not found in the closely related species,
M.leprae. This protein kinase is likely to be critical for
nutrient uptake.

M.tuberculosis also contains a PK (gi|2131007) with a
domain that shares significant similarity (e-value 10-4)
with the periplasmic oxido reductase of thioredoxin family (DSBA). The thioredoxins are known for their interaction with a broad range of protein as a general protein
disulphide oxido reductase. The potential role of this
kinase for its possible involvement in disulphide isomerisation of various proteins during protein folding is there-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/129

fore suggested. The occurrence of the DSBA domain in the
extracellular region of the PK emphasises their role in
reduction of periplasmic mycobacterial proteins. This is
unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is not found in
M.leprae.
The genome of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
also encodes another STYK probably assisting the folding
of proteins. The domain orgainisation of this novel kinase
includes an N-terminal kinase domain, a central transmembrane domain and a C-terminal peptidyl-prolyl cistrans isomerase (Pro_isomerase) domain. Among all
available completely sequenced genomes of various species of Mycobacteria, this novel protein kinase is encoded
in only in the M.avium genome.
Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 encodes one of the
largest STYK of 1826 amino acids encompassing a N-terminal kinase domain with six TPR repeats followed by the
GGDEF domain at the C-terminal end. The domains of
sensor kinases and response regulators of the His-Asp
phospho relay systems have been studied previously [49].
The GGDEF domain is suggested and subsequently shown
to be homologous to the catalytic domain of adenylyl
cyclases [50,51]. Recent studies have also suggested their
role in the regulation of bacterial growth and development through novel response regulators [52] by turnover
of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. Studies have also
underlined the importance of adjacent sensor domains in
the regulation of the catalytic activity of GGDEF [53]. The
occurrence of GGDEF with STYKs implies the sharing of
down stream signalling components by the HisKs and
STYKs and their role in production of cyclicdiguanylate.
The Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 encodes a protein kinase
(gi|17229994) with a pectinesterase domain (Fig 1b). The
pectin esterases catalyse the hydrolysis of pectin, a component of extra cellular capsules and cell walls. The association of two such enzymatic activities is unique to this
organism and suggests the probable role of phosphorylation in maintenance of integrity of bacterial cellular structural components.
A novel protein kinase (gi|17134087) with a C-terminal
GUN4 domain has been identified in the Nostoc sp. PCC
7120. The GUN4 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana are
known to bind to magnesium-protoporphyrin IX, an
intermediate in chlorophyll biosynthesis and there by regulating the enzyme Mg-chelatase involved in the
biosynthesis [54]. The novel protein kinase is therefore
suggested to be involved in the regulation of chlorophyll
production in Nostoc species.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known to be an opportunistic
pathogen encodes a total of 11 STYK-like sequences.

Seven of these are STYKs and the rest are KDO kinases. We
have identified the von Willebrand A domain located to
the C-terminal of kinase domain in one of the STYKs that
has been previously referred to as Ppka [55]. The glycoprotein binding vWA domain [56] might be playing an
important role in its interaction with the host proteins as
described in the later sections.
A STYK (gi|3328716) in Chlamydia species has a N-terminal kinase domain, and a C-terminal domain with similarity to TPR domain. Using remote homology detection
methods as described in the 'Materials and Methods' section, the similarity of this region with the TPR domain of
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferases
[57] has been detected. The TPR domain of O-GlcNAc
transferase (OGT) has been recently shown to be responsible for its targeting OGT and in determining its substrate
specificity [58]. The domain homologous to TPR in the
STYK is therefore likely to mediate its substrate
interactions.
Ser/Thr kinases of bacteria with periplasmic protein
domains
The periplasmic solute binding proteins are a part of the
ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter that transfers the
amino acids and sugars into the cytoplasm. Ser/Thr
kinases from Streptomyces coelicolor (gi|21223285) and
Nostoc sp. 7120 (gi|17227840|) contain a solute binding
domain for Glu, Gln (Fig 1g) and ANF receptor like
domain (Fig 1h), which is involved in the binding of
branched chain amino acids respectively.
Bacterial STYKs with non catalytic domains homologous
to domains associated to eukaryotic PKs
This section describes the possible functions of a few bacterial STYKs inferred based on their similarity in domain
combination with the well characterised eukaryotic protein kinases.

Synechocystis sp. is a cyanobacteria that encodes 12 STYKs.
One of the STYK (gi|1006577) has a SH3b (bacterial SH3
domain) following the N-terminal kinase domain. Occurrences of SH3 domains in bacteria have been previously
well documented [59]. They have also been classified into
a different family in SMART database [60].
Protein kinases with WD repeats (Fig 1f) were identified
in many bacterial species including Thermospora curvatum,
Thermodesmium erythraeum, Chloroflexus aurantia, Nostoc
punctiforme, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 and Thermobifida fusca.
Most of these kinases contain 7 WD repeats and are identified in cyanobacteria. The number of repeats varied in
few from 4 to 14 and all the species mentioned above contain more than one such protein kinase with the exception
of Thermobifida fusca. The WD repeats are associated with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/129

beta-propeller like folds and the most extensively studied
are the Gβ-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-proteins in
eukaryotes.
The FHA domain containing PKs (Fig: 1e) have been identified in the current analysis in the cyanobacterial species,
Thermodesmium erythraeum (gi|23042923, gi|23043171,
gi|23041283), Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1
(gi|22298671, gi|22299030|) Chloroflexus aurantia
(gi|22970578), Nostoc punctiforme (gi|23127167), and
Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (gi|17232446, gi|17228044,
gi|23043171). The phospho – threonine binding resiudes
GR, SxxH and NG are well conserved in all these FHA
domain containing protein kinases (Fig. 2). In eukaryotes
the FHA containing protein kinases are conserved from
yeast to mammals and are involved in the regulation of
the various stages of cell cycle and development [61].
The Myxococcus xanthus protein kinase, PKN2 has an interesting domain organisation. The PK consists of an N-terminal kinase domain that extends as a stretch of Ala/Ser/
Pro/Thr rich segments which further continues as a trans
membrane segment as described in earlier studies [62,63].
We have identified a Adenylyl/ Guanylyl cyclase (AC/GC)
domain in the region between the Ala/Ser/Pro/Thr rich
regions and the trans membrane (TM)- region. Regions
homologous to cyclases have been also observed in previous studies [64,65]. Cyclasess of this nature also occur in
the eukaryotes. A stretch of nearly 200 residues with no
similarity to any extra cellular domains known so far lies
on the external side of the TM segment. However the protein kinase like domain (PKLD) in the eukaryotic GCs lack
the catalytic residues. In the case of PKN2 the PK domain
has all the catalytic residues and is also known to phosphorylate on Ser/Thr residues [62]. The conservation of
catalytic residues of cyclase domain and the topology of
the gene product has been analysed in the current study.
The key residues at the catalytic sites of the GC, Glu and
Cys confer nucleotide specificity to the enzyme. Mutation
of Glu and Cys to Lys and Asp, the corresponding residues
of the adenylyl cylases, changes the nucleotide specificity
of GC to adenylate [66]. Among the residues known to
confer the nucleotide specificity of the GCs the glutamate
residue is conserved (Fig. 3) while the other residue
involved in specific nucleotide binding, Cys, is substituted
by Thr which is found in equivalent positions in few the
adenylate cyclases. The nucleotide specificity of the GClike domain of PKN2 sharing less than 15% identity with
receptor GC is unclear. Trans membrane region of PKN2
follows the GC domain unlike eukaryotic transmembrane
GCs.
A wide representation of eukaryotic signalling domains in
the bacterial kingdom has been described in previous
studies [67-69] and is also manifested in the bacterial Ser/

Thr kinase family. Such domain recruitments across
diverse signalling protein families imply the versatility in
the nature of interactions of these domains.
Dual protein kinases in bacteria
It has been observed in the yeast, an unicellular eukaryote,
that the osmo – regulation is brought about by both HisK
and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) suggesting the signal transduction from HisK to the MAPKs to
elicit the appropriate response [70,71]. The occurrences of
such composite signalling pathways have been suggested
in bacteria from other very early studies [72] and in studies on STYKs in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 [72]. The STYKs
with HisK, HATPase (the catalytic domain of HisKs) and
GAF (regulatory domains found in phosphodiesterases,
adenylate cyclases and pytochromes) have been referred
to as dual protein kinases (Fig 1d) as they contain catalytic
domain of two distinct kinases fused to form a single gene
product. Hybrid kinases such as those described above
have so far been identified in cyanobacterial species
[64,65,73,74]. The cyanobacterial species Nostoc sp. PCC
7120 and Nostoc punctiforme have 12 and 11 dual protein
kinases respectively. In the current study, the occurrences
of such composite kinases have been noted in 5 different
species. The other organisms that encode similar STYKs
include Trichodesmium erythraeum, Leptospira interrogans,

Ralstonia metallidurans and Rhodopsuedomonas plustris and
Psuedomonas putida. The nature of signals these composite
kinases perceive and the cellular processes they influence
is intriguing. Some of these STYKs also have the PAS
domains in the same polypeptide chain which is likely to
serve as redox sensors and thereby suggesting the roles of
such dual protein kinases in signalling pathways sensitive
to redox potentials.
Protein kinases involved in bacterial cell division
Protein kinases encoded in the genomes of Bacillus subtilis
and
Bacillus
halodurans,
yabT
(gi|2632333gnlPIDe1181999)
and
BH0080
(gi|10172692dbjBAB03799.1) respectively, are located in
the same gene clusters as spoIIE and FtsH/MesJ. These
STYKs are therefore suggested to be involved in the control of cell division like other genes in the same cluster.
Among the many genes known so far to control the cell
division in bacteria are the spoIIE and the FtsH/MesJ genes
[75]. This group of STYK that are likely to be associated
with cell division are analogous in their broader function
to cyclin dependent kinases of the eukaryotes that control
cell cycle.

Bacterial protein kinases and their substrates
Despite the identification of bacterial STYKs by genomewide analysis and demonstration of in vitro phosphorylation activity on exogenous substrates of significant
number of STYKs, very limited information is available
regarding their natural substrates and their specificity.

Putative homologues of AfsK, a well characterised Ser/Thr
kinase S.coelicolor, has been identified in Deinococcus radiodurans and Streptomyces avermitilis. In S. coelicolor, AfsK
phosphorylates of a global regulator of secondary metabolism AfsR that also controls the production of Actinorhodin [17,76,77]. This is brought about by the Ser/Thr
kinase AfsK. AfsK, encoded in the genomes of Streptomyces
coelicolor and S. lividans is a membrane associated phosphokinase encoded by the afsK gene. The analysis of the
domain composition of AfsK revealed the presence of
nine bac_PQQ repeats located at the C-terminal of the
protein.
A search for the AfsR homologues in Deinococcus radiodurans that are likely to be the putative targets of Afsk
revealed a gene product (gi|15807540) with N-terminal
transcription regulator domain (trans_reg) and Bacterial
trans-activation domain (BTAD) similar to the domains
observed in AfSR. This observation suggests that the gene
product could probably be the target of the Afsk like

kinase (gi|6460339) of D.radiodurans. Trans_reg or the
BTAD domain conserved among all the transcription regulators of AFSR family are therefore likely to harbour sites
for phosphorylation by AfsK.
The STYK sharing highest sequence similarity with AfsK in
the catalytic domain (38% identity) in the M.tuberculosis
genome is PKNB. A search for AfsR like gene products in
the M.tuberculosis genome revealed the gene product of
embR as its closest homologue. A further sequence analysis of embR gene product is known to be involved in the
resistance to etambutol revealed the presence of BTAD,
transactivation domain. This common domain shared by
the AfsR and its homologue in M.tuberculosis and D.radiodurans further suggests that the BTAD, transactivation
domain is critical for regulation of AfsR like gene products
and as the most likely region of the phosphorylation
mediated control of its activity. Recently embR gene product has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated by PKNH [78].
Substrate identification studies on PKN2 of Myxococcus
xanthus have revealed histone like proteins (HUα and
HUβ)[63] and beta-lactamase [79] as the target proteins
phosphorylated by the recombinant PKN2 expressed in
E.coli. The phosphorylation of beta-lactamase inhibits its
secretion [79] while the phosphorylation of HUα and

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:129

HUβ+ [63] has been shown to prevent their binding to
DNA resulting in toxicity to cells. PKN4 has been further
been shown to phosphorylate phosphofructo kinase
[80,81].
Phosphorylation as a mode of regulation of bacterial
STYKs
Among the completed genomes analysed in this study, a
significant number of STYKs are 'RD' protein kinases. The
protein kinases in the eukaryotes are in turn regulated in
a number of ways. Phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues in
the activation segment of the catalytic domains of these
kinases is a common mode of regulation [82]. The PKs
that undergo phosphorylation in the activation segment
have a characteristic 'RD' doublet sequence motif in the
catalytic loop wherein the Arg helps in neutralisation of
the negative charge on the phosphorylated residue to suitably poise the catalytic aspartate for phosphorylation.
These protein kinases are referred to as 'RD' kinases. A
multiple sequence alignment of the putative activation
segment in the catalytic domains of the bacterial 'RD'
kinases have revealed the strong conservation of threonines in their activation segments (Fig: 4) These threonines are therefore suggested to be the sites of
phosphorylation. Most of these kinases have two threonines that are well conserved and hence multiple phosphorylation for activation of these kinases as exemplified
by the PKN-B of M.tuberculosis [83] is suggested.

Discussion
The genome-wide analyses reveal the occurrences of a
large number of STYKs in bacteria. However the available
knowledge about their biological functions is limited.
The STYKs show a lower representation compared to HKs
in most of the genomes analysed (Data not shown). HKs
are encoded by higher number of genes in comparison
with STYK encoding genes in the prokaryotes. Nearly two
percent of the genomes of eukaryotic organisms encodes
STYKs as suggested from the genome-wide analysis by various groups [34,84-87]. Difference in the relative abundance of kinases belonging to the two classes, namely HKs
and STYKs in the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes probably
arises from the selection of specific class of PKs during the
course of evolution, as an adaptation to distinct cellular
environment. Low occurrence of STYKs compared to HKs
in most bacterial species with the exception of Pirellula
(Rhodopirellula baltica SH1) suggests, in general, the predominant role of HKs in prokaryotes.
HisK in archaeal genomes have been suggested to have
arisen from lateral gene transfer events explaining their
limited representation [88,89]. With the exception of
Buchnera, Onion phytoplasma and Thermococcus kodakaraensis, all the above mentioned genomes have at least one of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/129

the two kinds of protein kinases, namely HisK and STYK.
STYKs have not been identified in genomes of the two spirochaetes, Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi,
Chlorobium tepidum, Helicobacter hepaticus, Thermotoga
maritima and Xanthomonas species. The absence of either
classes of protein kinases in Buchnera species, an obligate
symbiont of the Aphids and Onion phytoplasma (intra-cellular plant pathogen) suggests the loss of such enzymes in
the above species is likely to be an adaptation to the hostintracellular environment. Our analysis also identifies an
anaerobic obligate heterotrophic thermophile, T.kodakaraensis as the only species with a non-symbiotic or nonparasitic habitat that lacks HisK and STYKs. Further studies on influence of phosphorylation on response to external stimuli will therefore be able to provide insight into
the nature of enzymes and significance of phosphorylation in these organsims.
The number of STYKs in phylogenetic domains of archaea
and bacteria increase with the growing size of bacterial
genomic data. The assignment of probable biochemical
functions and biological roles to large number of
sequences are often dependent on the occurrence of
homologous gene products in other phylogenetic
domains despite the vast divergence between the species.
Earlier studies have also indicated that the gross biological
function and interaction network of multi-domain proteins are conserved by the preservation of domain composition and arrangement [90-92]. Therefore domain
organisation of the bacterial STYKs have been studied here
to get an insight into their putative biological roles in
comparison with other proteins of similar domain
organisation.
Enzymatic and non-enzymatic domains described in the
earlier sections have been found covalently tethered to the
kinase catalytic domain. Among the archaeal multidomain STYKs, the OSGP-containing STYKs are widely
represented. Knowledge of substrates of the OSGP-containing STYKs and their sites of phosphorylation is
required to understand their role in regulation of functions of glycoproteins. The Ser/Thr residues serve as sites
for both glycosylation and the phosphorylation [93,94].
In many instances the phosphorylation and glycosylation
occurs at common sites in a competitive manner. The
phosphorylation would therefore prevent the glycosylation of the proteins. OSGP domains are involved in the
cleavage of those proteins at the sites containing glycosylated Ser/Thr residues. The phosphorylation of the target proteins by the associated kinase domains of the
OSGP containing STYKs might therefore serve as a regulatory mechanism to inhibit the proteolysis of
glycoproteins.

Eubacterial STYKs are associated with a large variety of signalling domains. Chase 2 domains containing STYKs
identified by recent studies [64,65,73] are also found in
other classes of trans membrane receptors including histidine kinases, diguanylate cyclases and methyl accepting
proteins. Presence of widely occurring sensory domain in
Ser/Thr kinases of Nostoc further emphasises on its role in
the perception of some critical signals that are likely to
trigger cellular pathways synergistically.

STYK of P.aeruginosa with phosphatase like domain has
significant similarity with spoIIE protein family in the
PFAM database. Recent studies [95,96] have shown the
involvement of Ser/Thr kinase-Phosphatase pair, PrkC
and PrpC in the sporulation of B.subtilis. Psuedomonas aeruginosa however encodes a composite kinase-phosphatase
in the same gene. The phosphatase-2C (PP2C) domains
are known to selectively dephosphorylate protein phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues and their homologues
have been previously identified and characterised in various bacteria [97-101]. The PP2C domains have been prePage 12 of 20

dicted to be functionally active in SpoIIE [102,103] of
Bacillus subtilis, a Gram positive bacterial species. SpoIIE
controls the activation of sporulation transcription factors
and critical for the development of the bacteria.

accumulation of glycolipids into the heterocysts is
brought about by a number of proteins. Some of these
proteins have the pentapeptide repeats, which are known
to be critical for the localisation of glycolipids [108].

The bacterial STYKs with TPR repeats identified here are
suggested to be influenced by the chaperone like protein
during their trafficking, folding or interactions with substrate proteins. The involvement of HSP90 in hormonal
and growth factor signal transduction mediated by protein kinases through proteins containing TPR repeats is
well characterised in eukaryotic cells [42]. Further phosphatase pp5 of Plasmodium falciparum with TPR domain is
known to act as co-chaperone for hsp90 and it has been
therefore suggested that protein dephosphorylation might
play a regulatory role in protein folding [104,105].
Despite their high sequence divergence the TPR repeats
and their constituting domain form a general interface of
interactions with HSP90 like chaperones [104].

PASTA domains conserved in a group of STYKs encoded
by Gram positive bacteria are found in proteins comprising the divisome complex. The representation of this
group of STYKs in all gram positive bacteria, including the
Lactococcus lactis (gi|12724921), and Streptococcus pyogenes (gi|13622698), which contain only one STYK suggest their role to be critical in their cell division. The role
of these protein kinases in cell division is reiterated with
their genes clustering with rodA involved in the regulation
of cell morphology during cell division. The phosphatase
2C encoding genes also lie in the same cluster supporting
the role of reversible phophorylation during cell division.

STYKs with stress response domains such as USPA have
been identified. The USPA proteins are suggested to be
autophosphorylated to switch on to active state. Subsequent to the induction of USPA proteins, many phosphorylated proteins have been detected [106]. The twocomponent system involved in nitrate assimilation is
known to induce bacterial universal stress proteins of the
nucleotide binding class [44]. Majority of these proteins
are tightly regulated and expressed under various conditions of stress in the bacteria.
The USPA containing kinases of plants have been implicated in disease resistance signalling pathway based on
their similarity to other protein kinases like Pto and Pto
interacting proteins of tomatoes that are involved in disease resistance [43,107]. Based on the role of USPA
containing proteins in stress response and their regulation
by the some two component system, we suggest the bacterial STYKs with USPA domains are likely to be induced
during stress response. In the eukaryotes, MAP kinases are
also known to trigger stress induced signalling pathways.
This group of bacterial kinases could therefore be functionally analogous to their eukaryotic counterparts that
are induced during stress.
Protein kinase containing gene products with C-terminal
pentapeptide repeats have been identified initially by an
early study [73] in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (gi|17132363) and
Synechocystis sp. PCC 7803 (gi|1653478). Nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation are well characterised in various
species of Cyanobacteria. The key enzyme involved in this
pathway, the nitrogenase, is highly sensitive to oxygen.
Some multi-cellular cyanobacterial species like Nostoc sp.
form specialised cells called heterocysts wherein the glycolipid layer prevents the diffusion of oxygen [77]. The

Lipopolysaccharide kinases (LPSK) engaged in the phopshorylation of the lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria share remote similarity
with eukaryotic STYKs [32]. They could be grouped into
two classes based on their sites of phosphorylation into
waaP gene products and Kdo kinases (KdoK) [109,110]. A
remote similarity between STYKs and the two family of
LPSKs has been recently reported by our group [32]. The
similarity in the potential 3-D structure and catalytic residues of LPSKs with the eukaryotic protein kinases suggests
analogous catalytic functions to the residues that are well
conserved across the two distinct families of enzymes. The
occurrence of Kdo kinase is so far restricted to pathogenic
Gram-negative species and is also known to be influencing the virulence in H.influenzae [109]. Inferences drawn
on the structure and the catalytic mechanism of LPSK
based on their similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases can
therefore serve as a guide to the design of inhibitors to the
LPSKs in virulent organisms.
The genomic organisation of all STYKs encoded in
M.tuberculosis H37Rv genome has been analysed in an earlier study [111]. The gene encoding the protein kinase
PKN-G of M.tuberculosis is clustered with the genes, glnH
for periplasmic Gln binding proteins. Therefore PKN-G is
likely to be the functional homologue of the other Gln
binding periplasmic Ser/Thr protein kinase of Streptomyces
coelicolor (gi|21223285). These protein kinases therefore
suggests the intake of amino acids in to the cell is also
likely to be influenced by phosphorylation, in addition to
the sugar transport in M.tuberculosis as described previously. Recent studies have established the involvement of
PKN-G in the regulation of cellular levels of Gln/Glu
[112,113] and in evading phagocytosis by the host cells.
Eukaryotic signalling domains have been observed in a
large number of bacterial proteins including in the STYKs

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:129

[67-69]. The cyanobacterial STYK with a SH3b domain
has a transmembrane segment between the kinase
domain and the SH3 domain. The nature of signals perceived by this trans-membrane STYK is not clear. These
SH3 domains are distantly related to their eukaryotic
counterparts. Eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases with SH3
domains have been well studied which is exemplified by
mitogen activated protein kinase kinase [114,115].
WD-repeats, a versatile protein-protein interaction module has also been observed bacterial protein kinases
[64,73,116,117] and in human protein kinases [46].
Pkwa of Themospora curvata, a member of WD-repeat
kinase family has been shown to be phosphorylated by
exogenous protein kinase form S. granticolor [100].
The fork head associated (FHA) domain was initially
found in transcription factors and has been recently identified as protein – protein interaction modules known to
bind to phospho-threonine residues on target proteins.
Hence the interactions of the FHA domains with their cognate proteins are largely influenced by phosphorylation.
Many bacterial proteins have been recently identified with
FHA domains [117]. Previously it has been observed that
the genes encoding FHA containing proteins cluster along
with Ser/Thr protein kinases and phosphatases in the M.
tuberculosis genome [111]. Thus the identification of the
PKs with FHA domains in cyanobacteria suggests synergistic actions of FHA domains containing proteins and
enzymes involved in reversible phosphorylation as
observed in eukaryotes.
Very few studies have shed light on the nature of substrates of bacterial kinase [17]. The AfsR, the substrate of
AfsK has an N-terminal transcription regulator domain
(trans_reg domain), trans-activation domain (bacterial
trans-activation domain, BTAD) followed by a signalling
domain NB-ARC and a C-terminal tetratrico peptide
repeat region which is known to be involved in proteinprotein interactions. The BTAD domain is shared by all
the members DNRI/REDD/AFSR family of transcription
regulators involved in secondary metabolism. Other proteins in Streptomyces coelicolor and related species that control actinorhodin production share the trans_reg domain
and the BTAD domain. A similar domain organisation
among the homologues of AFSR is intriguing and is likely
to contain sites of phosphorylation.
The phosphorylation site of HUα has been identified as a
threonine residue which is well conserved across HUα of
various species. RXXRTGR is the sequence pattern conserved at the phosphorylation site (P-site). The occurrence
of R at the P-1 site suggests PKN2 to be a 'basic directed'
protein kinase like Protein Kinase A (PKA) that specifically phosphorylates substrates with consensus motif

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/129

RRXS/TZ' (X is any amino acid and Z is any hydrophobic
amino acid). Based on the residue preferences of PKN2, at
known phosphporylation sites on substrates, bacterial
STYKs sharing significant similarity with PKN2 have been
examined, that are likely to seek similar residue determinants on their substrates. The catalytic domain of PKN2
shares highest similarity (40% identity) with PKNB of
M.tuberculosis and its homologue in M.leprae. The high
sequence similarity between PKN2 and PKNB is likely to
reflect in similar substrate binding modes such as preferences for N-terminal basic amino acid residues as also
observed for PKA.
PKN2 of Myxococcus xanthus is known to autophosphorylate in the region following the kinase domain. The GC
domain that lies C-terminal to the kinase domain contains 10 threonines. Further experimental studies are
therefore necessary to ascertain if these sites could be the
natural phosphorylation sites targeted by their respective
enzymes.
A significant number of bacterial STYKs have been biochemically characterised previously to elucidate their biological roles. STYKs of the PKN subfamily have been
identified and well characterised in Myxococcus xanthus
[79-81]Streptomycetes coelicolor [17], Strepyomycetes granticolor [86], Synechocystis sp [118-120], Yersinia tuberculosis
[33],
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
[111,122] and
Psuedomonas aeruginosa [55]. The PKN representatives of
Myxococcus xanthus and Streptomyces species are involved
in the specialised developmental cycles characteristic to
these species. They are also shown to be capable of autophosphorylation although it has been suggested to be
unimportant for their kinase activity in vitro [17,79-82].
The YpkA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a secreted STYK
that has been previously shown to interact with small
GTPases like RhoA and Rac1 of the host [26]. We have
identified the homologue of YpkA, the only STYK in the
completely sequenced genome of Yersinia pestis CO92
sharing 99% sequence identity with YpkA. However the
genome of Yersinia pestis KIM does not encode any YpkA
homologues. In addition to ABC1 and RIO1 class of
STYKs, a single gene product containing only the kinase
domain is identified.
PpkA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in
their virulence and are suggested to be induced during the
process of infection [55]. An unusual domain arrangement of PpkA identified in the current analysis comprises
of an N-terminal kinase domain followed by a stretch of
300 residues of unknown function and a C-terminal von
Willebrand factor Type A (vWA) domain. The vWA
domain, known to bind to glycoproteins and growth fac-

Large-scale genomic analysis are fraught with uncertainties related to the inheritance of function among remotely
homologous proteins. Nevertheless search procedures
employed in the current study for the study of domain
organisation of gene products has been extensively bench
marked [122] An accuracy level of 96% is achieved by use
of stringent search parameters described in 'Materials and
Methods' section. The functional roles of STYKs and
related systems encoded in various prokaryotic organisms
deduced using computational approaches in the present
analysis and in a recent independent analysis [123] is
hoped to provide useful leads for further studies on their
regulation.
Experimental studies [eg., [124]] elucidating the mechanisms of action STYKs and their homologues in various
cellular processes as suggested from the analysis would
therefore have implications in understanding their influence on the growth and development of the bacteria.

Methods
tor receptors, in PpkA is therefore suggested to aid in interactions at the surface of the host cell.
Mbk, is a Ser/Thr kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
encoded by the gene mbk [121] that lies in pst operon that
controls phosphate transport. Mbk corresponds to STYK
gi|2078052 in M.tuberculosis genome, which has an N-terminal kinase domain, a transmembrane region and a Cterminal NHL-repeats. The occurrence of membrane spanning region and extra-cellular NHL-repeats that forms an
interaction surface suggests the Mbk to serve as receptors
for unknown ligands regulating the phosphate transport.
The STYK, referred to as SpkA in Synechocystis is previously
shown to be required for the motility of the cyanobacteria.
SpkA corresponds to STYK (gi|1652312), in the genome
of Synechocystis sp that has an N-terminal kinase domain
and a C-terminal extension of 200 residues to which no
known functional domain could be associated. The role of
the C-terminal extension in the regulation or interaction
with other proteins controlling the motility of the organism remains to be elucidated
The attempt made in the current analysis to study the bacterial STYKs by In silico analysis is hoped to aid in the further understanding of STYKs encoded in various genomes.
The diversity of the functional domains occurring in these
protein kinase like gene products provide clues to their
biological functions that are yet to be explored experimentally. The involvement of bacterial STYKs in various cellular processes described in the previous sections suggests a
very little overlap with the Histidine kinases and the protein kinases of the eukaryotes.

The complete set of predicted protein sequences from the
ORFs of the bacterial genomes has been obtained from
NCBI [125] Using sensitive sequence profile matching
algorithms, STYK like sequences have been identified in
the genomes.
We have employed multiple sensitive sequence search
and analysis methods PSI-BLAST [126], IMPALA [127]
and HMMer which matches Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) [128]. These programs have been previously
benchmarked [122,129,130] and we have used a stringent
cutoff for e-values (0.0005 in PSI_BLAST, 10-5 in IMPALA
and 0.01 for HMMer) for identifying homologues of
kinases. The list of predicted STYKs used for further analysis has been arrived at after careful cross-referencing
between the results of these methods as well as manual
scrutiny for a variety of factors such as length of the kinase
domains and presence of critical functional residues.
Kinase catalytic domains of the PKLA were aligned using
CLUSTALW. Manual decisions are taken considering the
presence/absence of functional motifs and the lengths of
putative kinase domains. Those kinase-like sequences
without functional residues, such as an aspartate in the
catalytic base position, are segregated separately and are
not considered for the detailed analysis. Number of such
sequences in various genomes is provided in Table 2.
Domain assignment to the non-catalytic regions of the
kinase containing genes has been carried out using the
HMM search methods by querying each of the kinase containing sequences against the 6190 protein family HMMs
available in the Pfam database [131]. Trans-membrane
segments were detected using TMHMM [132].
