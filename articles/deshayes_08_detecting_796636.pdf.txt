Abstract
Background: Computer-assisted analyses have shown that all bacterial genomes contain a small
percentage of open reading frames with a frameshift or in-frame stop codon We report here a
comparative analysis of these interrupted coding sequences (ICDSs) in six isolates of M. tuberculosis,
two of M. bovis and one of M. africanum and question their phenotypic impact and evolutionary
significance.
Results: ICDSs were classified as "common to all strains" or "strain-specific". Common ICDSs are
believed to result from mutations acquired before the divergence of the species, whereas strainspecific ICDSs were acquired after this divergence. Comparative analyses of these ICDSs therefore
define the molecular signature of a particular strain, phylogenetic lineage or species, which may be
useful for inferring phenotypic traits such as virulence and molecular relationships. For instance, in
silico analysis of the W-Beijing lineage of M. tuberculosis, an emergent family involved in several
outbreaks, is readily distinguishable from other phyla by its smaller number of common ICDSs,
including at least one known to be associated with virulence. Our observation was confirmed
through the sequencing analysis of ICDSs in a panel of 21 clinical M. tuberculosis strains. This analysis
further illustrates the divergence of the W-Beijing lineage from other phyla in terms of the number
of full-length ORFs not containing a frameshift. We further show that ICDS formation is not
associated with the presence of a mutated promoter, and suggest that promoter extinction is not
the main cause of pseudogene formation.
Conclusion: The correlation between ICDSs, function and phenotypes could have important
evolutionary implications. This study provides population geneticists with a list of targets, which
could undergo selective pressure and thus alters relationships between the various lineages of M.
tuberculosis strains and their host. This approach could be applied to any closely related bacterial
strains or species for which several genome sequences are available.

Background
Recent in silico surveys showed that most bacterial
genomes contain interrupted coding sequences (ICDSs)
[1-3]. These ICDSs generally result from the insertion or
deletion of nucleotides, affecting the frame read and splitting the original coding sequence into two or more
smaller open reading frames. These mutations may also
result in a shift in reading frame, thereby altering the carboxy-terminus of the protein. ICDSs may be present in
genes with known or unknown functions, or in hypothetical open reading frames [4]. Reported prokaryotic
genomes have a mean of 74 ICDSs per genome, corresponding to 1 to 5% of the genes present, irrespective of
genome size or GC content [2,3]. One of the few exceptions is the genome of M. leprae, which contains about
30% ICDSs, frequently described as pseudogenes [2,5].
The accumulation of mutations in this species is thought
to be due to the loss of the proofreading activity of the
DnaQ subunit of DNA polymerase III [6]. A similar sort of
reductive evolution is also observed in the case of M. ulcerans [7] or for species of the genus Rickettsiales [8]. ICDSs
may correspond to authentic mutations, generally resulting in a loss of function, but may in some cases reflect
sequencing errors. These sequencing errors are misleading
when conducting genomic analysis, but have been shown
to account for only some of the detected ICDSs [4,9-12].
Most ICDSs correspond to authentic mutations and can
therefore be compared between strains, making it possible
to explore conserved and unique mutation events.
The availability of complete genomes sequences for genetically related organisms has facilitated comparative analyses of ICDSs. This simple concept, which has not been
reported before, enables to investigate evolutionary relationship between isolates or species. In this study, we took
the finished genome of two mycobacterial species as a
model: M. tuberculosis, which causes tuberculosis in
humans, and M. bovis, which principally causes tuberculosis in ruminants. We also studied six phylogenetically distinct isolates of M. tuberculosis – H37Rv, CDC1551,
Haarlem, F11, C [13], and 210 (a representative of the WBeijing family) and M. africanum, a species of the M. tuberculosis complex for which the genome sequence is still at
the assembly step. These isolates are different from each
other as they belong to distinct evolutionary branches of
the M. tuberculosis species, sensu stricto (s.s), yet more
closely related to each other than to the more distantly
related members of the M. tuberculosis complex (M. africanum, M. bovis, M. microti and M. pinnipedii) [14]. The WBeijing family is a clonal group of highly successful M.
tuberculosis strains associated with multiple outbreaks
[15]. This family is one of the oldest lineages to diverge as
determined by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
and region of deletion analysis [14]. In contrast, H37Rv,
the first M. tuberculosis strain to be completely sequenced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/78

is believed to be one of the most recent (youngest) lineages of M. tuberculosis [14,16]. Strain CDC1551 belongs to
a lineage that branched between the W-Beijing and the
H37Rv isolates. Overall these three isolates represent 3
different genetic groups of the species [14-17]. These isolates have been studied in detail and display differences in
genotype [14,18], phenotype and virulence properties
[19,20]. By comparing the open reading frames containing frameshifts in these organisms, we showed that ICDSs
could be classified as "common to all strains" or "lineageor strain-specific". The common ICDSs probably correspond to mutations occurring before the divergence of the
isolates, whereas lineage- or strain-specific ICDSs correspond to more recently acquired mutations. Thus, ICDS
investigation can be used to characterize the molecular
scars of evolutionary relationships between organisms
and may well provide a unique molecular signature for a
particular strain or species, complementary to single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other molecular
markers analyses for the characterization of strain variation [18,21]. We also show that ICDS formation is not
associated with mutation in the promoter region. The
present data suggests that promoter extinction is not a
major event in the "pseudogenization" process. To experimentally prove that ICDSs comparison is a powerful phylogenomic tool, we analyzed 21 clinical M. tuberculosis
isolates for their ICDS content. We showed that the WBeijing lineage differs from the other TB phyla by a lower
number of common ICDSs, confirming early divergence
with M. tuberculosis s.s strains. ICDS characterization in
addition to phylogenetic investigations or typing can be
used to select strains or phenotypes for studies of particular phenotypic characters, such as virulence. Indeed, as
frameshift acquisition may lead to a loss of function,
researchers should consider the possible presence of ICDS
before choosing a strain or species for investigating a particular phenotype.

Results
Detecting the molecular scars of evolution in M.
tuberculosis and in M. bovis
Comparative analyses of frameshift-containing genes
require the complete genome sequences of closely related
organisms. The TB complex, which includes two recently
sequenced species and at least 6 accessible strains, is therefore a highly suitable model. We investigated ICDSs in M.
tuberculosis and in M. bovis. The genome sequence of M.
tuberculosis H37Rv has been available since 1998 and has
recently been re-annotated [22,23]. The genome
sequences of M. tuberculosis strain CDC1551 and M. bovis
have been characterized independently [18,24]. The great
advantage of studying this model system is that the evolution of these two species and the phylogenetic links
between them are well documented [25]. The M. tuberculosis genomes (CDC1551 and H37Rv) have nucleotide

sequences more than 99.95 % identical to that of M. bovis
[18,24]. The three genomes were screened for the presence
of ICDSs. To this end, the genomic sequences of each predicted ICDS [3] were extracted for each strain or species
and compared between them. Each common or specific
ICDS was then analyzed manually to characterize the
molecular event leading to the detected frameshift. The
genome of H37RV contains 113 ICDSs, whereas
CDC1551 has 137 ICDSs and M. bovis has 134 ICDSs, corresponding to about 2% of the total coding sequences [3].
These organisms have similar numbers of ICDSs, but the
alterations do not always affect the same genes. We therefore investigated whether some of these ICDSs were common to all three organisms. We compared the nucleotide
and deduced amino-acid sequences of each frameshiftcontaining open reading frame in the three organisms. We
found that 81 of the frameshift-containing genes were
common to all three strains (Figure 1A, Table 1), and were
identical at the molecular level. The proteins affected by
these frameshifts included proteins of unknown function
as well as annotated and/or characterized proteins (Table
1). The fact that these three mycobacterial genomes were
sequenced and assembled independently suggests that
these 81 common ICDSs correspond to authentic

frameshift-containing genes rather than sequencing
errors. These results indicate that these 81 ICDSs correspond to frameshifts acquired before the splitting of the
M. tuberculosis and M. bovis species (Table 1). Alternatively, the same 81 genetic mutations may result from
convergent evolution and hence have occurred independently in all three genomes, a highly unlikely scenario.
The two M. tuberculosis s.s strains were found to have 19
additional common ICDSs, raising their total number to
100 (Figure 1A, Table 2). This suggests that the 19 additional mutations common to these two strains but not to
M. bovis were acquired post-divergence of M. tuberculosis
and M. bovis. One ICDS in M. bovis (ICDS0046, Mb1789cMb1790c) was present in M. tuberculosis CDC1551
(ICDS0057, MT1807) but not in M. tuberculosis H37Rv
(Rv1759c). This mutation (deletion of one G) was identical in the M. bovis and M. tuberculosis CDC1551 strains,
but an additional mutation was present close to this
mutation in the M. bovis genome. One ICDS in M. bovis
(ICDS0128, Mb3813-Mb3814) was also present in M.
tuberculosis H37Rv (ICDS0118, Rv3784-Rv3785) but not
in M. tuberculosis CD1551 (MT3893) (Table 2).
The availability of genomic resources for M. tuberculosis is
increasing exponentially. This enabled us to investigate
the presence or absence of these shared ICDSs in the Haarlem, F11, and C strains, the genomic sequences of which
are currently at the assembly stage at the Broad Institute
[26]. As the sequence of these genomes is in progress, the
total number of frameshift-containing genes in these
genomes cannot yet be accurately determined; nonetheless, it is possible to check whether the 81 ICDSs present
in M. bovis and in other M. tuberculosis strains are present
in these strains. All 81 ICDSs common to all three strains
previously tested were also present in Haarlem and F11
strains, while 79 were present in the C strain (corresponding H37Rv ORFs ICDS0103 and ICDS0105 were fulllength in this strain) (see Additional file 1). Noteworthy,
was the identification of additional mutations in the
vicinity (≤ 200 bp) of the original frameshift (see additional file 1). We next investigated whether the 19 ICDSs
common to all M. tuberculosis s.s strains were present in
the other clinical isolates. In each case, the ICDSs were
also present in the three strains (Haarlem, F11, and C),
but accompanied, in some cases, by additional mutations
in the flanking region (see Additional file 1). Thus, 98
frameshift-containing genes were found to be conserved
in all five M. tuberculosis strains analyzed.
The recently published M. bovis BCG genome sequence is
of a particular interest in this respect [27]. This strain,
which is currently used for vaccination in humans, was
derived from M. bovis after 13 years of repetitive passages
in vitro [28]. A number of genetic differences, such as dele-

tions and duplications had already been identified in the
BCG strain [29,30], but large amounts of additional information have now been obtained from its genome
sequence. According to our investigation, M. bovis BCG
1173P2 contains 127 ICDSs in total, 9 of which are strainspecific (Figure 1B). The 81 ICDSs common to the 3 other
isolates are also present in this strain (Table 1) and 35
ICDSs are common to the M. bovis strain. We detected
frameshift-containing genes in M. bovis AF2122/97 that
corresponded to full-length ORFs in M. bovis BCG
1173P2, suggesting that this M. bovis strain is not the
direct progenitor of the BCG vaccine (see Additional file
2).
Strain-specific ICDSs reflect newly acquired mutations and
are a useful phylogenetic tool
Eighty-one ICDSs were common to all three strains, but
some were specific to one strain only: 12 for M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (see Additional file 3), 36 for CDC1551 (see Additional file 4) and 51 for M. bovis (see Additional file 2, Figure 1A). The proportion of ICDSs that were strain-specific
was highly variable. These ICDSs accounted for 10% of all
ICDSs in H37Rv, 26% in CDC1551 and 38% in M. bovis.
The much larger proportion of strain-specific ICDSs in
CDC1551 than in H37Rv strain is surprising, and we currently have no reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. A plausible hypothesis is that the genome sequence
of CDC1551 strain has not been re-sequenced like the
H37Rv genome sequence [22,28]. Strain-specific
frameshift-containing genes most likely correspond to
mutations acquired after the divergence of these strains.
Like the common ICDSs, these events affected genes from
several classes, including "unknown or hypothetical
ORFs", "intermediary metabolism" and "cell wall, process" (Additional files 2, 3 and 4). As stated above, few of
these strain-specific ICDSs may correspond to errors introduced during the sequencing procedure [4,11], but such
errors would nonetheless have only a slight effect on the
overall outcome of the comparative analysis.

assembled; nevertheless it can be consulted in homology
searches. Consequently the total number of frameshiftcontaining genes in this species and the full characterization of specific ICDSs remain elusive. It is however possible to screen for the presence of ICDSs in this strain.
We first investigated whether the 81 frameshift-containing
genes common to all strains were also present in the
genome of strain 210. All 81 of these genes also contained
the same frameshift in strain 210, in agreement with the
data described above. This suggests that these 81
frameshift mutations were acquired before the divergence
of strain 210 from these other strains. We then investigated the 19 genes containing frameshifts common to the
five strains of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv, CDC1551, Haarlem,
F11, C) but not to M. bovis. We found that eight of these
19 genes contain no frameshift in strain 210, and hence
corresponded to full-length ORFs (Table 2). Three genes
contained frameshifts corresponding to those observed in
strains CDC1551, H37Rv, Haarlem, F11 and C, but also
contained additional mutations in the corresponding
flanks (≤ 200 bp) of the original frameshift (Table 2). The
remaining 11 ICDSs corresponded to frameshift-containing genes common to all six TB strains examined
(CDC1551, H37Rv, Haarlem, F11, C, 210) and the events
were identical at the molecular level. Thus, the 19
frameshift-containing genes in the two TB strains
(CDC1551 and H37Rv) displayed polymorphism in
strain 210 and 11 of these identified ICDSs were common
to all six TB strains examined. Some of these ICDSs display no further mutation (the gene contains the
frameshift alone), whereas others have acquired additional mutations, contributing to the "pseudogenization"
process (data not shown).

This study shows that the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis contains ICDSs that have been acquired during the
evolution of this species. The pool of ICDSs can be classified into ICDSs common to a set of strains or species and
ICDSs specific to a particular strain-lineage or strain,
revealing genetic differences between strains or species.

We then investigated the eight ICDSs showing polymorphism in M. tuberculosis in 21 strains of the W-Beijing lineage from several phylogenetic groups (Table 3). The eight
loci were amplified by PCR, sequenced and the nucleotide
sequence was compared with that of strains 210 and
H37Rv. In all W-Beijing strains tested, the eight genes
were full-length, with sequences 100% identical to that in
strain 210, excepted for the ICDS0085 where a non-disruptive SNP is present in the region. The W-Beijing lineage
is therefore a genetically homogeneous group with fewer
ICDSs in common with other TB strains.

Using ICDS comparisons to type W-Beijing strains and
other M. tuberculosis lineages
W-Beijing is a lineage of M. tuberculosis that has attracted
considerable attention. Indeed, strains of this lineage have
been implicated in severe outbreaks and have been shown
to have different genetic and phenotypic properties
[20,21,31]. The genome of a strain of the W-Beijing family
(strain 210) is currently sequenced but not yet fully

To extend our analysis, we investigate the M. africanum
strain, which is currently sequenced at the Sanger centre.
Similarly to M. tuberculosis 210 strain, the M. africanum
genome is still at the assembly step, but can be nevertheless consulted on line. We investigated whether the 81
frameshift containing genes common to all strains tested
were also present in the M. africanum strain (Table 1). All
81 of these genes also contained a frameshift in M. africa-

Hypothetical phylogenetic links assessed by comparative analyses of ICDSs
Hypothetical phylogenetic links assessed by comparative analyses of ICDSs. In this schematic representation, the common
ancestor gave rise to several branches of strains of the TB complex. Eighty-one frameshifts were acquired during the common
evolution of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis. Since the separation of these species, M. bovis has acquired 51 frameshifts, while the
branch leading to M. tuberculosis isolates has acquired 19 new frameshifts. Since separation of the isolates, M. tuberculosis H37Rv
has acquired 12 new frameshifts and CDC1551 36 new frameshifts. Common and unique ICDSs are shown in dark and light
gray, respectively. "*" these 8 ICDSs correspond to full-length ORF in M. tuberculosis 210 and in M. africanum GM041182. "**" 7

num, which suggests that these mutations were acquired
before the divergence of the M. tuberculosis complex. We
then investigated the 19 genes containing frameshift common to the 5 M. tuberculosis strains (CDC1551, H37Rv,
Haarlem, F11, C). We found that 15 out of these 19 genes
were deprived of the frameshift in M. africanum and corresponded to full-length ORFs in this strain (Table 2). Eight
out of these 15 genes match the wild-type ORFs identified
in M. tuberculosis strain 210 and other strains of the W-Beijing lineage. In conclusion, the genome of M. africanum
contains fewer ICDSs in common with the other TB isolates (CDC1551, H37Rv, Haarlem, F11, C) than with the
W-Beijing strain and seems genetically closer to this lineage.
ICDS formation is not correlated with mutation in the
promoter region
It has been suggested that pseudogene formation is associated with mutations in the upstream untranslated
region, abolishing pseudogene expression to prevent a

loss of metabolic function [32]. Once turned off, the gene
continues to accumulate mutations, leading to complete
pseudogene formation. ICDSs are not pseudogenes in the
strict sense of the word. Indeed, the ORF is split into only
two or three unframed fragments and can, in theory,
revert to a wild-type allele. ICDSs are therefore considered
to be ORFs undergoing "pseudogenization" rather than
pseudogenes per se. Strain-specific ICDSs are, by definition, genes that are mutated in one strain, but not in
another. We therefore investigated whether ICDS formation was correlated with mutation in the promoter region.
All the intergenic regions (99) located upstream from
strain-specific ICDSs of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, CDC1551
and M. bovis were compared with the corresponding
region in the two strains having a wild-type gene. We used
as a control the promoter region of randomly selected
genes that are full-length in these 3 strains. We compared
the level of differences observed in the promoter regions
of genes full-length or containing frameshift. Nucleotide
differences were observed in 27% of the upstream region

of genes containing frameshift (see Additional file 5A),
while 20% was observed in the case of the full-length
genes (see Additional file 5B), which is not statistically significant using the chi square test. In all but 6 cases for
ICDS and 2 cases for full-length genes, the difference in
the upstream region was limited to one or two SNPs.

epidemiological studies, but as far provide little information pertaining to genetic differences in terms of putative
function. In contrast, studies of regions of deletion (RD)
have proved useful for both global phylogeny and study
of a loss of phenotype in both M. tuberculosis and in M.
ulcerans [25,30,37].

We therefore conclude that ICDS formation is not correlated with mutation in the untranslated upstream region
and suggest that either promoter mutations do not play a
major role in pseudogene formation in the M. tuberculosis
complex or that "pseudogenization" is recent.

Frameshift acquisition generally leads to a loss of function, as shown in a number of published studies. Loss-offunction associated with the presence of a frameshift has
been reported in both M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. For
instance, ICDS0066 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv corresponds
to a frameshift-containing gene encoding a polyketide
synthase (pks1). This pks1 gene also contains a frameshift
in M. tuberculosis CDC1551, resulting in two different
ORFs: pks1 and pks15. In contrast, M. bovis and M. leprae
carry a full-length functional pks1 gene [38]. The pks15/1
gene is now frequently used as a marker in epidemiological studies [39,40] and, interestingly, the pks gene contains no frameshift in the W-Beijing strains of M.
tuberculosis [40], resulting in phenolglycolipid production
in most cases [41]. Our analysis shows that the pks gene of
M. africanum is also full-length suggesting that this species
produces PGL. This observation suggests that these early
strains are more closely related to M. bovis or to the last
ancestor than other M. tuberculosis strains. Similarly,
ICDS0067 in M. bovis corresponds to a putative
frameshift-containing glycosyltransferase gene. The
ortholog of this gene has no frameshift in the two strains
of M. tuberculosis (Rv2958c and MT3034). Functional
complementation of M. bovis BCG with the Rv2958c gene
from M. tuberculosis leads to the accumulation of a new
metabolite, the diglycosylated phenolglycolipid [42].
Some frameshift-containing genes have been studied
experimentally in M. tuberculosis, without considering the
possibility that these ORFs may well contain frameshift
[43,44]. Mutation by homologous recombination has
been achieved at the mntH and mmpL13 loci. In both
cases, no detectable phenotype was associated with the
mutation. Our data indicate that MmpL13 function
should be investigated in a W-Beijing strain or in M. africanum. Another example that has not yet been studied is
the pks3 and pks4 genes of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, which
constitute a single ORF in CDC1551 and in M. bovis. This
suggests that – like the pks1 and pks15 genes, which are
pseudogenes in M. tuberculosis – the pks3 and pks4 genes
are probably not functional in the H37Rv strain. It would
therefore be pointless to investigate function in the
H37Rv strain by creating mutants in pks3 and pks4 genes
or by expressing constructs encoding the corresponding
polypeptides. These examples from previous publications
illustrate the major biological impact of frameshift acquisition. They demonstrate the importance of choosing the
right strain or species for investigations of the function of
a particular gene. However, it is not always possible to

Discussion
The presence of frameshift-containing genes in bacterial
genomes is well documented [1-3,33]. A few species can
bypass such frameshifts, but most do not, generally resulting in a loss of function.
We show here that ICDSs can be classified as "common to
all strains" or "strain-specific". The ICDSs common to all
strains probably correspond to mutations acquired before
the divergence of the strains, whereas strain-specific ICDSs
correspond to those acquired subsequently (Figure 2).
Mutations acquired after the speciation of M. tuberculosis
from M. bovis were also detected. We identified 19 ICDSs
common to the five M. tuberculosis strains (H37Rv,
CDC1551, Haarlem, F11 and C) but not to M. bovis, about
one-fifth of ICDSs common to all strains. Comparative
analyses of ICDSs help to characterize the phylogenetic
relationships between highly related strains and species
(Figure 2) and could be applied to any bacterial species for
which several genome sequences are available. In few
cases, ICDSs may correspond to fusion/fission of orthologous genes in other genomes. The detection of this kind of
events is due to the method of identification of ICDS but
remains however a minor inconvenience [3]. It is however
possible that a low percentage of specific ICDSs does correspond to sequencing errors, inducing thus artifactual
phylogenetic relationships. Researchers should resequence these regions before assuming that the ICDS corresponds to a frameshift acquisition. Several studies have
compared the genome sequences of M. tuberculosis
CDC1551 and H37Rv, using high-resolution genomics
techniques [18]. This has led to the definition of regions
containing large-sequence polymorphisms (LSPs, greater
than 10 bp) and single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). The SNPs have been investigated in more detail in
various clinical isolates, to draw up a global phylogeny of
M. tuberculosis [17]. Other molecular methods, such as
analyses of the deleted regions (deligotyping), variable
numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR), mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) and spoligotyping, have
helped to unravel global genomic sequence diversity in
this species [34-36]. These techniques are highly useful for

infer from the position of the frameshift whether the protein's activity will be affected. For instance, GlnA3, a
glutamine synthetase generated from a frameshift-containing gene (Table 1), has been purified and shown to
retain some activity [45]. It would be interesting to
reframe these ORFs to test the impact of frameshift on
protein function. On the other hand, it has been shown in
silico that protein-coding sequences can be tolerant of
frameshift translation events and thus that frameshit
acquisition is an important reservoir for creating novel
proteins [46]. Several of the truncated ORFs described
here have also been detected in other studies, based on
different analyses [17,18,40,47,48]. However, we present
here a comprehensive comparative analysis of three
related mycobacterial species and nine strains at the ICDS
level.
We found no association between ICDS formation and
mutation in the promoter region of the corresponding
ORF. This suggests that promoter mutation and inactivation of gene expression are not the principal source of
ICDS formation and hence of pseudogene accumulation
in the M. tuberculosis complex. It may also suggest that
ICDS formation in these species is a recent process. We
favor the hypothesis that ORFs are first split into two or
three parts, inactivating their function, and are then subject to secondary mutation (in both the ICDS and the
untranslated region), leading to irreversible pseudogene
fixation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have
observed additional mutations in the vicinity of the original frameshift in some strains.
We have shown that ICDS investigation can be used to
infer the evolutionary relationships between strains and
species. We provide here a list of more than 150 ICDSs
that may be useful for characterizing TB strains and inferring phylogenetic relationships. The genome sequences of
more than 10 TB strains will be released in the near future
[26], and will, by no doubt, identify some new common
and strain-specific ICDSs. Strain typing should clearly
combine various markers, such as SNPs, MIRU, LSPs, RD,
PE polymorphism [49] and ICDSs, in a matrix-based comparison from which the global phylogeny of TB isolates
may be deduced. The polymorphism associated with
these mutations is complementary to other methods
[17,34,36,37,50], hence can be used to explore genetic
diversity within a given species. Interestingly, in strain
210, from the W-Beijing family, eight of the 19 ICDSs
common to the five M. tuberculosis strains tested (H37Rv,
CDC1551, Haarlem, F11, C) corresponded to full-length
ORFs, illustrating its earlier divergence. Some of these
genes may be involved in virulence, as they concern functions such as host cell invasion (ICDS0011 of H37Rv),
lipid biosynthesis (ICDS0066 and ICDS0031 of H37Rv)
and intermediary metabolism (ICDS0085 of H37Rv). To

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/78

test whether this trait was a particularity of the 210 strain
or applied more generally to the W-Beijing phylum, we
sequenced these eight ORF that were full-length in this
strain in 21 other clinical isolates of the W-Beijing (Table
3). In all cases, the ORF were corresponding to a fulllength ORF and not to an ICDS, demonstrating that these
strains are genetically homogenous. The analysis performed using a strain of M. africanum showed that this
species is characterized by an even fewer number of ICDSs
common to M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CDC1551 than to
the W-Beijing strains. More genome sequences of various
strains and species are required for characterization of the
genetic differences between the W-Beijing strains and
other species of the M. tuberculosis complex. The alkA gene
has been shown to contain frameshift in both M. bovis and
some M. tuberculosis isolates from Central African Republic [48]. The presence of SNPs in the adjacent region of the
non-sense mutation has led the authors to propose a convergent evolution. Although, it probably depends from
genes to genes, we instead favor the hypothesis that the
non-sense mutation was acquired by the ancestor and
spread to the progeny with acquisition of subsequent
mutations in the adjacent region. Epidemiologists should
bear in mind that a small percentage of ICDSs may correspond to sequencing errors [4,11], generating artifactual
genetic differences. Our analysis did not allow for the
detection of mutations in which the frame of the coding
sequence was conserved (synonymous mutation, in frame
deletion), decreasing the total level of diversity observed.
However, comparative ICDS analysis presents the major
advantage of making it possible to associate the frameshift
with a putative function and, possibly, with a particular
phenotype. In conclusion, more attention should be paid
to ICDS detection and comparison, particularly at the
genomic scale.

Conclusion
We report here a comparative analysis of ICDSs in six isolates of M. tuberculosis, two of M. bovis and one of M. africanum. We show that these ICDSs can be classified as
"common to all strains" or "strain-specific". Common
ICDSs result from mutations acquired before the divergence of the species, whereas strain-specific ICDSs were
acquired after this divergence. Comparative analyses of
these ICDSs allow the definition of the molecular signature of a particular strain, phylogenetic lineage or species.
We further show that ICDS formation is not correlated
with the presence of a mutated promoter, and suggest that
promoter extinction is not the main cause of pseudogene
formation. The correlation between ICDSs, function and
phenotypes could have important evolutionary implications and provides population geneticists with a list of targets, which could undergo selective pressure and thus
alters relationships between the various lineages of M.
tuberculosis strains and their host.

Methods
Databases
The genome sequences of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and
CDC1551 and M. bovis AF2122/97 were taken from TIGR
website [51]. The genome sequences of M. tuberculosis
strains 210 or F11, C and Haarlem have been consulted
on the TIGR or Broad Institute websites [52]. The genome
sequence of M. bovis BCG 1173P2 has been taken from
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
website (accession number, AM408590). The genome
sequence of M. africanum GM041182 was consulted on
line at the Sanger centre [53].
Detection of common ICDS
The genomic sequences of M. tuberculosis CDC1551, M.
tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis AF2122/97 and M. bovis BCG
1173P2 have been scanned for couple of adjacent coding
sequences that exhibit common homologs after translation. Such pair of coding sequences is considered as an
ICDS if no paralogy relationship exists between the two
coding sequences. The detailed description of ICDS detection is described in [3]. The ICDSs detected in each strain
were then cross-compared by all-against-all blastn
searches. For each ICDS, the best hits (E < 10-65) detected
in the different strains were manually analysed to discriminate common and strain-specific ICDS.
Sequencing analysis
Chromosomal DNA of M. tuberculosis isolates from various lineages (Table 3) was used as a template for PCR
amplification of the selected locus. The primers used to
amplify and sequence were designed as previously
described [3], using an optimized version of CADO4MI
[54]. The nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences
were analyzed with DNA Strider [55].
Promoter analysis
A region of 200 bp upstream the initiation codon was
extracted for each of the 99 ICDSs specific to M. tuberculosis H37Rv, CDC1551 and M. bovis AF2122/97 (Additional
files 2, 3 and 4). As a control group, 200 bp upstream the
initiation codon was extracted for 99 genes (full-length)
randomly selected from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. These 99
genes are full-length in M. tuberculosis H37Rv, CDC1551
and M. bovis AF2122/97. In each case (promoter to be
tested and control group), the promoter regions of the 3
strains were aligned using ClustalW [56] and the sequence
variation was recorded. The number of differences
observed in the upstream region was statistically compared using the Chi2 test.
Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of the distribution of the frequency of sequence polymorphism observed in the
upstream ICDS regions and upstream full-length regions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/78

was tested using a Chi square test (X2). The chi square test
is used to determine relationship between two distributions. The calculated values were obtained: X2: 1,367, df:
1, P value: 0.2423, hence the difference between 2 groups
are not statistically significant (α < 0.05).
