Abstract
Background: Understanding structure and function of human genome requires knowledge of genomes
of our closest living relatives, the primates. Nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) play a significant
role in differentiation that underlies phenotypic differences between humans and chimpanzees. In this
study, we evaluated distribution, evolutionary history, and function of indels found by comparing syntenic
regions of the human and chimpanzee genomes.
Results: Specifically, we identified 6,279 indels of 10 bp or greater in a ~33 Mb alignment between human
and chimpanzee chromosome 22. After the exclusion of those in repetitive DNA, 1,429 or 23% of indels
still remained. This group was characterized according to the local or genome-wide repetitive nature, size,
location relative to genes, and other genomic features. We defined three major classes of these indels,
using local structure analysis: (i) those indels found uniquely without additional copies of indel sequence in
the surrounding (10 Kb) region, (ii) those with at least one exact copy found nearby, and (iii) those with
similar but not identical copies found locally. Among these classes, we encountered a high number of
exactly repeated indel sequences, most likely due to recent duplications. Many of these indels (683 of
1,429) were in proximity of known human genes. Coding sequences and splice sites contained significantly
fewer of these indels than expected from random expectations, suggesting that selection is a factor in
limiting their persistence. A subset of indels from coding regions was experimentally validated and their
impacts were predicted based on direct sequencing in several human populations as well as chimpanzees,
bonobos, gorillas, and two subspecies of orangutans.
Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that while indels are distributed essentially randomly in
intergenic and intronic genomic regions, they are significantly under-represented in coding sequences.
There are substantial differences in representation of indel classes among genomic elements, most likely
caused by differences in their evolutionary histories. Using local sequence context, we predicted origins
and phylogenetic relationships of gene-impacting indels in primate species. These results suggest that
genome plasticity is a major force behind speciation events separating the great ape lineages.

Background
In the past decade, the focus of genomic diversity studies
mainly included single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) in humans as
well as in other organisms. More recently, the International HapMap project directed efforts toward understanding haplotype structure in human populations and
helped to form our perception of genomic diversity based
on SNPs [1-4]. At the same time, Olson and Varki [5]
argued that understanding our own genome would not be
complete without the evolutionary perspective, and
requires knowledge of the genomes of our closest primate
relatives [5,6]. Previously, direct comparisons of human
and chimpanzee sequences have used either a single chromosome [7] or the entire genomes [8]. Resulting extensive
sequence datasets opened a possibility for carefully examining alternative sources of genomic variation, such as
insertions and deletions (indels).
Since humans diverged from a common ancestor with
chimpanzees approximately 5 million years ago [16],
understanding genome differences between these two lineages is critically important for defining our own species.
Several studies that examined chimpanzee and human
genomes comparatively, located and characterised
sequence differences, including single-base pair indels,
monomeric and multi-base pair extensions (repeats),
indels with random DNA sequences, and transposon
insertions [5,10,15]; and more are currently under way.
Initially, differences between humans and chimpanzees
were estimated at 1% [7,17,18], but later this number was
refined to 1.2% [8]. Several studies pointed out that the
number of differences is much higher when indels (insertions and deletions) are included in the comparison [1921], and the total divergence may be as high as 6.5% [19].
Removing repeats and low-complexity DNA reduces this
calculation to 2.4% [19], doubling the original estimates.
Indels, fragments missing in sequence comparisons
between individuals or closely related species, are plentiful across genomes [9,10]. Only a small fraction of indels
occurs within coding sequences; it seems that these may
play a key role in primate evolution [19,22]. While most
indels have no adaptive value, some are known to alter
important functions, and many are known to be involved
in disease phenotypes [11-14]. It has been noted that
while the human genome might contain as many as 1.6–
2.5 million indel polymorphisms, efforts directed toward
the discovery of this type of genomic variants are still significantly less intensive than efforts involved in the SNP
discovery [10]. Many indel polymorphisms can still be
discovered and classified in comparative genomic studies.
As the number of described indels accumulates, several
mechanisms have been proposed to explain their source

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/51

and existence. The origin of individual indels seems to
depend on their size, sequence context as well as other factors [15,23,24]. For example, it appears that many recent
short insertions in the human genome originated as tandem duplications, while smaller indels (<5 bp) were generated either by unequal crossing over or by replication
slippage [23]. In addition, a non-homologous end joining
mechanism initiated by a double-strand breakage [15] has
also been proposed as a main mechanism of indel generation for a wide range of sizes [24].
In this study, we report on those indels (10 bp or larger)
that cannot be simply explained by short tandem repeats
and/or other repetitive DNA occurrence. We obtained a
set of indels by comparing homologous sections of
human and chimpanzee chromosome 22 (following the
orthologous numbering nomenclature [8,25]), and characterized it relative to the local, chromosomal, genomic,
and gene-specific sequence contexts. We divided our data
into three groups (referred to as "core classes") according
to presence, sequence identity, and relative locations of
additional copies of indel sequence in the neighboring (±
5 kb) region. We also considered the observed indels in
their genomic context and further divided the data into
three groups (referred to as "genome classes") based on
the presence of copies locally on chromosome 22 or elsewhere in the human genome. The presence of indels in
coding sequences of genes and other genomic elements
was examined relative to the random expectation using a
tenfold chromosome-wide resampling approach. Finally,
we examined predicted transcripts for their impacts on
peptide sequence to confirm genes where an insertion or
deletion can change the amino acid sequence or alternate
splice products that differentiate between the two species.
Indels that impacted genes by altering coding sequences
and splice sites were further characterized. Gene impacts
were considered both computationally, by looking at the
resulting amino acid sequence, and by direct sequencing,
in comparison among five human populations and with
five closely related primate species.

Results
Identification and analysis of indels
We identified 6,278 indels (≥ 10 bp) in a comparison
between 33 Mb of syntenic regions from human and
chimpanzee chromosome 22, using human genome as a
reference (Fig. S1(see Additional file 1)). Human
sequence extended from 15.4 to 49.3 Mb while the chimpanzee sequence covered a region from 15.4 to 50.0 Mb
(Table 1). Most of these variants were found around simple sequence repeats (2,572), but similar numbers were
located in and around the known repetitive DNA
sequences (2,277) and were filtered out (Table 1). For
simplicity, throughout this paper we refer to the data set
containing the remaining 1,429 repeat-filtered sequences

A total of 6,278 indels of size ≥ 10 bp were seen in comparison of human and chimpanzee chromosomes 22. Most of these were either in Short
Tandem Repeats (STRs) or Known Repetitive DNAs, where the major types are shown. The remaining indels (0.25%) were classified as insertions
or deletions relative to the human sequence. Another 0.25% of the indels were 2–9 bp (19,932, totalling 76,486 bp). In addition, 346,771 Single
Nucleotide Differences were seen in the UCSC alignment totalling 1.0% of the bases compared.

tenfold random resampled dataset of fragments of human
chromosome 22 with distribution of lengths identical to
those of the previously described observed dataset (see
Materials and Methods, Fig. S1(see Additional file 1)). We
will refer to this artificially generated data set and the
"indels" it contains as "resampled," and consider it as the
baseline expectation in our subsequent statistical analysis.

Identification and characterization of genomic context
and core indel types
Indels in the observed dataset were classified according to
their local or genome-wide repetitive nature. Both datasets (observed and resampled) were divided into three
core classes based on local structure analysis: (i) those
found uniquely in the 10 Kb indel-harbouring region
were marked as "unique" (31%), (ii) those with at least
one exact copy found locally were categorized as "exact"

Classification of Indels into Core Types, Based on the Flanking Sequence
Classification of Indels into Core Types, Based on the Flanking Sequence. The indels are classified into 3 core types
based on their similarity to the sequences in the 5 Kb flanking regions. The unique type is formed by the indels with no similarity to the flanking regions. The indels with at least one exact copy of indel sequence in the flanking regions define the exact
type; and the approximate type includes indels with only partial (sub-repeats of indel sequence) or complex (combination of
indels sub-repeats) copies of indel in the flanking region. Sub-repeats (length of ≥ 10 bp) are shown in frames, colors are used
to designate between different core types: unique (blue), exact (red) and approximate (green).

Indels from the three core classes (approximate, exact, or
unique) were not represented equally among the three
genome classes (genome-unique, chromosome-unique,
or chromosome-multiple) (LR χ2 = 23.28, 4 d.f., p =
0.0001, Table S2.1A (see Additional file 1)). We identified
a significant excess of approximate and exact indels at the
expense of unique indels in the observed dataset (Likelihood Ratio (LR) χ2 = 916, 2 d.f., P < 0.0001; Table S1(see
Additional file 1) and Fig. 2). The majority of genomeunique indels had copies locally and were classified as
approximate core indels (56.3%) reflecting their locally
repetitive nature (Table S1(see Additional file 1)). Most
chromosome-unique indels were also found in the
approximate core class (75.7%). At the same time, the
unique core indels (those with no copies in the 10 Kb
flanking sequence) were better represented among the
genome-unique (no copies elsewhere in the genome)
(31.7%) compared to the chromosome-unique indels
(copies unique to the chromosome) (14.6%) (Table S1,
Fig. S2(see Additional file 1)).
Characterization of core indel classes among and within
genic features
The locations of 1,429 observed and 14,290 expected
indels were assessed in relation to RefSeq genes annotated
on chromosome 22 and assigned into five gene element
categories: (1) intergenic sequence, sequences located (2)
upstream and (3) downstream of known genes, (4) functional gene elements, and (5) introns (Fig. 3, bottom
panel). The observed frequency distribution of indels
among these five gene element categories was not random
(LR χ2 = 27.63, 4 d.f., p < 0.0001; Fig. 3, bottom). Indels
were less frequent immediately upstream (10.1%) and
downstream (8.6%) of the genes, and in functional

(12%), and (iii) those with similar but not identical copies of the core indel sequence found locally were labelled
as "approximate"(58%) (Fig. 1, Table S1). In addition, we
divided the observed dataset into three genome classes
according to the presence and location of additional copies of sequences in the human genome (Table S1, Fig. S2
(see Additional file 1)). A group of indels whose exact
sequences (including the indel and ± 18 bp of the flanking
sequence) were unique to their genome location were the
most common ("genome-unique," 92.3%), followed by
the group of indels with copies present elsewhere, but
exclusively on chromosome 22 ("chromosome-unique,"
7.2%). There was also a small fraction of indels whose
copies were also identified on other chromosomes of the
human genome, outside of chromosome 22 ("chromosome-multiple," 0.5%). Our subsequent analysis was
based on comparisons among genome or core classes of
intels, as well as on contrasting between the observed data
and the baseline provided by the tenfold resampled dataset.

observed and resampled datasets (orange bars) There is an

shortage of unique indels compared to the expected values
for chromosome 22 (LR χ2, d.f. = 2, χ2 = 916, p < 0.0001).

observed indels were found either in introns and intergenic regions (33.5 and 41.8%; respectively, Fig. 3). The
overall distribution of the three indel core classes among
the five categories also differed from the distribution of
the resampled dataset (p = 0.02; Table S3), largely due to
fewer approximate indels located within genes than
expected (6.5% vs. 13.5%, LR χ2 = 31.6, 4 d.f., p < 0.0001,
Table S3(see Additional file 1)).
Indels located within genes were divided into five more
categories according to the type of functional gene elements as located in: (a) promoters, (b) coding sequence,
(c) splicing sites, (d) 3' gene flanking regions, and (e)
untranslated regions (UTRs) (Fig. 3, top panel). Three of
the five gene functional elements – promoter sites, splice
sites, and coding regions – contained fewer observed
indels than expected (LR χ2 = 46.82, d.f. = 4, P < 0.0001;

in the upper panel represents distribution of indels within the functional element category classified further by specific functional region. Promoter, coding regions and splice sites contain many fewer observed indels than expected (LR χ2, d.f. = 4, χ2 =

more indels than expected were found within the UTRs
and 3' flanking regions (Fig. 3, top panel).
The three core classes of indels differed in their proximity
to genes estimated as a distance to the boundary of the
nearest exon (Fig. S3(see Additional file 1)): approximate
indels were found furthest away from genes ( x = 8,886

bp), followed by the unique ( x = 5,792 bp), and exact ( x
= 6,877 bp) categories (p = 0.02, Table S2.1B (see Additional file 1)). The observed distribution of distances
between indels and genes differed among indel core
classes, and between the observed and the resampled data
(p < 0.0001, Table S2.1B (see Additional file 1)). In the
observed dataset, unique indels were located closer to

Evaluation of the observed indel impacts on gene structure
Using a comparative approach, we reconstructed indel
fragments within the human sequence that potentially
impacted genes, and evaluated them either by deleting
insertions or by adding deletion sequences (relative to the
chimpanzee). Among the 23 indels identified in coding
exons or in splice sites, 10 had potential impact on protein products: seven resulted in truncated proteins, two
caused short insertions of amino acids, and one resulted
in an amino acid substitution in eight impacted genes:
CELSR1, FLJ41993, FLJ44385, NEFH, RUTBC3, SMC1L2,
TCF20, and UNC84B5 (Table 2). The inferred ancestral
state of each indel was based on whether the species interrogated in the laboratory had an insertion or a deletion

Length and distance to the nearest exon differences
among the indel types
A comparison of indel lengths (Fig. 4 and Table S2.1(see
Additional file 1)). A and among the three core classes and
across gene elements was performed. Approximate indels,
making up the largest core class, were shorter in length in
the observed compared to the resampled dataset (47 vs.
52 bp on average, p = 0.0003; Table S2.1A (see Additional
file 1)). Unique and exact indels were similar in size, and
both contained indels that were on average smaller than
their counterparts in the approximate class (p < 0.0001,
Table S2.1A and Fig. S1(see Additional file 1)). Observed
indels located within genes were the shortest (26 bp),
shorter than that expected from the resampled distribution (34 bp on average, p < 0.0001; Table S2.1A (see Additional file 1)). Approximate indels showed the greatest
difference in size within gene elements (p < 0.0001, Table
S2.1A (see Additional file 1)), while their presence in
other categories, such as introns and intergenic elements,
had no effect on length (p = 0.2–0.7, Table S2.1A (see
Additional file 1)). Unique indels were shorter than
expected overall, but the most significant differences
between observed and expected length were found among
those unique indels located outside genes, rather than
within gene elements (p = 0.007–0.009, Table S2.1A (see
Additional file 1)).

unique indels, within the functional gene elements were
on average twice as far from exons than expected (146 vs.
341 bp and 165 vs. 387 bp, respectively (Table S2.1B (see

relative to the known primate phylogenies (Fig. 5). The
other 13 predicted indels observed in ACSIN, BCR, BRD1,
CHKB, CYP2D7P1, DGCR8, PCQAP, PRODH, RUTBC3,
SBF1, SELO, and ZDHHC8 genes, had no effect on the
predicted coding sequence (not shown).
Along with the computational evaluation, the gene
impacting indels were also examined by direct PCR and
sequencing, using primers from conserved flanking
sequences. The presence of an insertion or deletion was
then examined by PCR amplification in 189 samples from
five human populations (Asians, American Indians, African Americans, Africans, and European Americans), as
well as 26 chimpanzees, 11 bonobos, nine gorillas and 10
individuals from two subspecies of orangutans (five samples each; see Materials and Methods). Products were
sized on agarose gels to identify polymorphisms and species differences in these indel loci. When different-sized
fragments were present in at least one of the five species,
the indel-containing region was sequenced (Table 2).
The results of the laboratory validation varied among
indels. For instance, in the FLJ44385 gene, the human
insertion was present in its entirety and led to the truncation of the protein from 125 to 113 amino acids (Table 2).
Predicted indels were found and their impacts confirmed
for genes SMC1L2 and FLJ41993 also. However, in
FLJ41993 an additional sequence that is not present in the
reference sequence (Build 36) was also detected. The
UNC84B sequencing yielded an incomplete fragment of
the predicted indel. One of the sites in the RUTBC3 genes
was amplified, but with an indel different from the

human draft sequence. DNA amplified from another site
within RUTBC3 and one in TCF20 did not show any
detectable differences in PCR fragment size in the different species. Computationally predicted indels within
NEFH were additionally corroborated by human traces
alignments (trace IDs: 1181046117, 1183837089,
1200564777,
1227912385,
1229518898,
and
546289986). In the experimental validation, only one of
the sites at NEFH was successfully amplified with the
indel size and sequence as predicted. The regions containing other indel site at NEFH and indel within CELSR1 did
not amplify, despite numerous attempts.

Discussion
Indels that differentiate between humans and chimpanzees likely contribute to the speciation process [23,26] of
these closely related species. In the current analysis, a
comprehensive evaluation of insertion/deletion variations between human and chimpanzee chromosome 22
was performed. Upon examination, 1,429 out of 6,278
indels were found in genomic areas free of known repetitive DNA and STRs on chromosome 22 (Table 1), and
these were examined with respect to their structure,
length, and location relative to known structural gene elements, and also the number, sequence similarity, and the
location of the additional copies. We compared observed
distributions of different indel classes to the baseline distribution of an expected set generated by a tenfold resampling approach (see Materials and Methods), as well as
among one another. We also developed a framework for

With the use of GENSCAN, the 23 indels found in coding exons or in splice site regions of the human REFseq genes were analyzed for their impact
to these genes. Out of the 23, 10 of these indels impact genes through truncation/insertion of amino acids or substitution within a protein. The
other 13 indels had no affect on the proteins generated from genes DGCR8, ZDHHC8, BRD1, SELO, SBF1, CHKB, PCQAP, BCR, PRODH, RUTBC3,
CYP2D7P1, &ACSIN2. In order to confirm the presence of an insertion or a deletion, the loci and its harboring regions were sequenced in each of
the species. Assembly confirmation is dependent on whether the indel product is completely present (all of the bases) in the corresponding species
predicted. For gene FLJ44385, the indel was present in its entirety. The assembly was also confirmed for genes SMC1L2 and FLJ41993 with all of the
bases of the indel present, however additional sequence was also detected. The inferred ancestral state of each indel is based on whether a species
has the insertion or deletion of that locus and the species' position on the phylogenetic tree.

role in primate evolution and contribute to important
genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees
[10].
Many indels from the syntenic human and chimpanzee
chromosome 22 sequences were located around known
repetitive DNA, and initially filtered out (4,849 out of
6,278). The remaining 1,429 were distributed unevenly
across the genome features (Fig. 3). Indels were found
under-represented within functional elements (Fig. 3),
probably due to some selective constraints. This situation
is not unique to indels as a subtype among other genomic
variants. Previously, studies have shown that indel events
and single nucleotide substitutions correlate, and there
may be common underlying properties for both processes, since indels accumulate in the same parts of the
genome that exhibit higher substitution rates [19] with
hotspots often coinciding [10]. As is the case in single substitutions, indels occur with different frequencies across
the genome. Specifically, indels are scarcer and shorter in
coding sequences [19] where selective constraints are the
most intensive, and 3 bp indels in the coding regions,
which maintain the coding sequence without frameshifts,
are by far the most common class [22]. In the current

study, the approximate class of indels is on average larger
and located the furthest from the coding sequences (Fig.
S3(see Additional file 1)). Approximate indels were only
half as numerous as expected within genes (6.5% vs. 13%,
Table S4), and within the functional elements, they were
both shorter than, and not as numerous as the unique and
exact ones (Table S2.1A (see Additional file 1)). In addition, approximate indels were furthest away from the
nearest exons (Table S2.1B (see Additional file 1)).
Only 6.5% of all indels characterized in our study were
parts of gene elements (positioned within promoters,
splice and terminator sites, untranslated and coding
regions of known genes), nearly a half as many as
expected in comparison to the baseline represented by the
resampled data (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Only in the 3' gene
flanking regions did indels occur at frequencies similar to
the expectation in the resampled dataset. The presence of
selective constraints acting on functional elements of the
genome probably explains why the intergenic regions
contain many more indels than genes [22]. However,
somewhet unexpectedly, indels in the introns were more
frequent than in the intergenic regions (Fig. 3). The paucity of intergenic indels is consistent with the presence of

Page 8 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:51

unknown regulatory elements or genes [27]. Other studies
point out to a twofold larger number of intronic over the
intergenic indels [22], but the filtering of repetitive DNAs
and the 10-bp cutoff applied in this study likely accounts
for the reduced number of intergenic indels observed. Our
estimate of the number of indels within five gene elements (6.5%) and introns (41.8%), if combined, is higher
than previously reported (35.7% [10]). This may reflect
our choice to focus on indels longer than 10 bp.
Structural characteristics and origins of indels
Together with identification of the sequence context
around indels, the structural characteristics of local
repeats proved to be useful for systematic understanding
of their nature and origin. More recently, non-homologous end joining mechanism, one of the consequences of
double-strand breakage [15], and non-allelic homologous
recombination have been proposed as main indel-generating mechanisms [24,28]. Still, the role of repeats as the
underlying mechanism that gives rise to insertions and
deletions should not be overlooked, especially given the
indel proximity to known repetitive DNA [7,20,29], and
their frequent association with short duplications
[23,30,31]. Other work suggested that indels have been
generated mainly by unequal crossing over and replication slippage [22].

All of these molecular mechanisms generate copies of
indels, making the presence of identical sequences locally,
on the chromosome, and genome-wide a point of interest
(Fig. 1 and S1 (see Additional File 1)). We followed this
scheme and found that most of the observed indels in this
study (1,317 of 1,427) did not have any exact or approximate copies anywhere else in the genome (genomeunique, Fig. 2, Table S1, and Fig. S2 (see Additional file
1)), but 103 of them had copies present on the same chromosome (chromosome-unique), and seven were found
on other chromosomes (chromosome-multiple, Fig. 2
and Fig. S2 (see Additional file 1)).
Current analysis focused on delimiting three core indel
classes (Fig. 1), based on exact or approximate copies of
the indel in the flanking sequence (± 5 Kb), or its unique
presence (see Materials and Methods and Fig. S4 (see
Additional file 1)). Differences in repeat structure among
indels suggested that a local mechanism of indel formation may be the result of two main duplication processes,
where new local duplications, resulting in the exact indel
core class, and the subsequent nucleotide substitution
generate indels in the approximate class. The origins of
the unique core class are not clear, but could be partially
explained by a smaller-than-10-bp local repeat structure
(our repeat finder analysis size). Approximate and exact
copy indels were over-represented, while unique indels
were under-represented in the observed dataset (Fig. 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/51

While numerous elsewhere, approximate indels were
scarce within genes, and especially within coding
sequences, possibly a consequence either of negative
selection, and/or their older evolutionary age, compared
to the members of other core classes (Fig. 2). Age of indels
may also account for other observations in this study:
while exact indels are longer than expected, approximate
indels are both shorter and located further away from
genes than expected (Fig. 4, Table S2.1, and Fig. S3 (see
Additional file 1)). Unfortunately, the exact core class of
indels was not well represented in our survey (168
observed and 141 resampled indels, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 (see
Additional file 1)), and making inferences about this
important class was more tentative.
Since distances between conserved duplications are highly
preserved between humans and chimpanzees [30], we
were able to search for numbers of repeats of each indel
sequence among the indel classes. Most of the approximate and unique indels were found in clusters represented by four or more copies. These included more than
half of exact indels (88 of 168) and more than 2/3 of the
approximate ones (586 of 831). This suggests that the
number of nearby copies in the two respective classes is an
important characteristic of indels, and has a potential to
serve as a metric of the evolution of duplicates.
The scale and validation of indel impacts
Insertions and deletions comprise less than one percent of
known disease-causing mutations [23]. Some indels can
have a significant effect on protein product and gene
expression, especially when they are located within functional gene elements [10]. According to some estimates, at
least 13% of the genes harbour at least one indel [19].
Insertions in coding sequences often result in translational frameshifts, with the consequence of premature
protein termination or nonsense-mediated RNA decay
[19]. It is highly likely that some of them are actually disease-causing, and several indels have already been
included in a list of candidate genes for cancer and other
disorders [32-35]. Our approach identified 23 indels in
coding exons or in splice site regions of human RefSeq
genes (Fig. 5). Among these, 10 indels were found to alter
the sequence of a corresponding protein, and our experimental validation confirmed five: FLJ44385, FLJ41993,
NEFH, SMC1L2, and UNC84B (Table 2).

A parallel study of genetic variation on human chromosome 22 [36] suggested that humans harbour similar levels of indel variation: indels represented 22% of the total
polymorphic events, which is somewhat more than the
18% reported earlier, but within the predicted range estimate of 16% to 25% of all sequence polymorphisms in
humans [10]. Our findings support the conclusion that a
large fraction of the differences between human and

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:51

chimpanzee genomes is comprised of indels [22]. However, not all indels have been validated, or even
sequenced; therefore, those estimates should be cautiously evaluated. Only three of the 10 indels in the coding sequence that had a potential impact on gene function
revealed the same indel after sequence analysis (Table 3).
One of the limitations of the present work was that it utilized the low coverage draft sequence of the chimpanzee
genome and relatively early version of the human
genomic sequence. However, even an unfinished chimpanzee genomic sequence could be useful for detection of
the gene-modifying indels, as demonstrated by previous
work [37]. Our computational and experimental data partially support this notion. Unfortunately, incomplete data
that consists of misassembled or poor-quality sequences,
and unsequenced genomic fragments can also contribute
to the high volume of false-positive indels. We addressed
this problem in the follow-up validation by PCR and
sequencing. Not surprisingly, we encountered primate
sequences different from anything currently listed in public databases (Table 2). In the future, higher coverage
genomic sequences of the different primate species should
allow a more accurate identification of the loci that differentiate primates closely related to humans [38].

Conclusion
In the current report, we investigated and discussed several aspects of the indels phenomenon: (i) indels represent the abundant group of the genomic sequence
variations; (ii) the mechanism of their formation is potentially reflected by the local structure of the indel containing region; (iii) indels represent a source of the potential
mutations in primate genes and genomes; (iv) indels can
play an important role in the understanding of genome
evolution and genome plasticity; and (v) indels are an
important of source polymorphisms that directly influence human phenotypes and diseases.

Methods
Sequence alignment and identification of indels
Syntenic regions of human chromosome 22 (Genome
Assembly July 2003, hg16) from 15.4 to 49.3 Mb and
chimpanzee chromosome 22 Chimpanzee (Genome
Assembly Dec 2003) from 15.4 to 50.0 Mb were retrieved
from the UCSC database and Ensembl database, respectively. Coordinates are from the August 2003 release of
the human sequence and Ensembl May 2004 of the chimpanzee. Syntenic fragments (33 Mb) from human chromosome 22 and chimpanzee chromosome 22 (Human
Genome Assembly [July 2003]) and Chimpanzee
Genome Assembly (Dec 2003) were aligned using the
MUMmer program [39,40]. MUMmer output was parsed
to identify small insertions and deletions (with lengths of
10 bp to 10 Kbp). The evolutionarily neutral term "indel"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/51

was used to signify these length differences. All indel
sequences surrounded by at least 10 bp of perfectly
aligned flank and with no more than 50% undetermined
bases (Ns) were selected for further analysis (Table 1). All
coordinates were transferred to the most recent genome
assembly using LiftOver http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/
hgLiftOver for reference and given in the Supplementary
Materials (Table S6 (see Additional file 2).
Characterization of indel sequences
The insertion sequences with 500 bp of flanking sequence
were extracted. The selected fragments were analyzed with
RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder [41]. Sequences
that overlapped with known repetitive elements and/or
short tandem repeats (≥ 10 bp) were filtered from the
original data set. The remaining indel data set was subjected to a more detailed analysis of the local and genomic
features. Insertion sequences were extracted from human
and chimpanzee chromosomes, and BLAT [42] searches
were performed with these fragments against the entire
human genome assembly to identify genomic locations
harbouring identical sequences (± flanking 18 bp). The
local repeat structure of the indel region was examined in
the 5 Kbp of flanking genomic regions on both sides (Fig.
S4 (see Additional file 1)). New repeats and repeat classes
in these regions were found using REPuter [43,44] and
RepeatFinder [45], utilizing a minimal repeat length of 10
bp and a gap of 1 bp for repeat clustering parameters.
With these results, indels were categorized into the classes
based upon the local structure of the indel region (Fig. 1).
Resampling and statistical analysis of indel data
We generated a random data set to examine the significance of the identified indels' features and classes. The
random set of sequences was created using the following
rules: (i) human genomic sequence was selected as the
source of all sequences; (ii) coordinates of beginnings of
randomly chosen sequences were selected from the range
and frequency distribution of the analyzed human chromosomal fragments; (iii) the number of generated resampled sequences was 10 times larger than the number of
indels in the original data set (Fig. S1 (see Additional file
1)). This random set of sequences was filtered using the
same criteria as the original set of observed indels where
N-rich sequences, known repeats, and tandem repeats
were deleted. Then, a subset of this cleaned data was
extracted so that the distribution of the sequence lengths
matched exactly the distribution of sequence lengths in
the original or observed indel set (Fig. S1 (see Additional
file 1)). Finally, the local structures of the indel regions in
the resampled data were determined using the same procedures as with the observed indels. These procedures are
described in the next section. Statistical significance of the
described classifications was assessed by linear general
models regression procedures (GLM). Fisher exact test was

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:51

applied for the table analysis. All statistical analyses were
performed with SAS Version 9.1 software (SAS Inc., Carey,
NC)[46].
Location of indels relative to known genes
Coordinates of the exons and coding regions of the REFseq genes annotated on human chromosome 22 (553
transcripts) were downloaded from the UCSC genomic
database. We measured distances between each indel and
the nearest exon, represented by the distance between the
closest ends of both features. Next, we classified the entire
dataset based on the distance of the indel to the nearest
exon, the indel and exon lengths, the strand of the exon,
exon number, and the coding region coordinates. Thus,
we defined 10 general gene-related groups of the indels:
(i) intergenic – the shortest distance from the indel to the
nearest first and/or last exons of the neighbouring genes
was greater than 25 Kb; (ii) upstream – the indel was 2–
25 Kb away from the 5' side of the first annotated exon of
a gene; (iii) downstream – the indel was 2–25 Kb away
from the 3' side of the last exon of a gene; (iv) promoter –
the indel was positioned less than 2 Kb away from the 5'
side of the annotated first exon; (v) terminator – the indel
was sited less than 2 Kb from the 3' side of the last exon;
(vi) intronic – the indel was located in its entirety between
the exons of the same gene; (vii) 5' UTR – the indel was
found within an exon but outside the coding region on
the 5' side; (viii) 3'UTR – the indel was found within an
exon but outside the coding region on the 3' side; (ix)
exonic – indel was contained entirely within an exon and
within its coding region; (x) splice-site – the indel coordinates overlapped either the beginning or the end of an
exon.
Estimation of indel impact on gene structure and protein
product
We concentrated on those indels with the highest potential impact on their protein product, and subsequently, on
the biological function. Hence, using Build 36 Genome
Assembly (February 2006, hg18), 23 indels found either
in the coding sequences of exons or in the splice site
regions of human REFseq genes were analyzed for their
possible impact on those genes. For each gene we collected 2 sequences: first, a fragment of human chromosome 22, including the entire gene transcript; second, a
putative sequence constructed from the first fragment by
suppressing the indel, either by deleting the insertion or
by adding the predicted deletion sequence of chimpanzee
origin. Both sequences were analyzed using GENSCAN
[47]. Differences between protein products predicted in
these pairs were reported to characterize the indel impact.
Primer design
A semi-automatic procedure was developed to identify
primers in the indel regions. The procedure identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/51

conserved regions in the flanks of the selected indel by
parsing the MUMmer alignment, then pairs of the primers
were predicted by the primer3 [48] and the uniqueness of
the primer pairs in both human and chimpanzee
genomes was checked. The uniqueness rule was implemented as follows: each pair of primers was mapped by
BLAT [42] to the human and chimpanzee genomic
sequences. One of the primer sequences had to be unique
in each genome and the other one could not have more
than 10 copies per genome to be selected as a unique PCR
set. Some indel regions did not satisfy such criterion, so,
manual choosing was performed.
DNA samples
We selected 189 DNA samples from five species of great
apes, as well as several populations of humans. The apes
in the sample set included 26 chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), 11 bonobos (Pan paniscus), and nine gorillas
(Gorilla gorilla). The set also included two orangutan subspecies: five samples of Sumatran (Pongo pigmaeus abelii)
and five samples of Bornean orangutans (P. p. pigmaeus).
Most of these were available from within the Laboratory
of Genomic Diversity (LGD) repository. The remainder
was purchased from either the Integrated Primate Biomaterials and Information Resource (IPBIR, beginning with
PR) or the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden,
NJ (beginning with NG and NS). Purchased chimpanzee
samples were PR00226, PR00496, PR00512, PR0064,
PR00744, NS03629, NS06939, NS03487, NS03639,
NS03641, NS03659, NS03656, NS03650, NS03660,
NS03623, NS03622, NS03657, NS0361; bonobo
(PR00092, PR00251, PR00367, PR00661, PR00446,
PR00111, NG05253); and gorilla (NG05251, PR00107,
PR00573). To our knowledge, all of these were unrelated
individuals, except for one father-son pair of gorillas from
the LGD repository (GGO-3 and GGO-7). The human set
of samples represented five distinct ethnic groups: Asians
(n = 24), European Americans (n = 25), Amerindians (n =
25), African Americans (n = 25), Senegalese (n = 25), and
Botswanian (n = 9). These DNA samples were some of the
same samples we have characterized previously [49].
Indel verification
Twenty-three indels were selected for experimental evaluation and validation based on their predicted gene
impacts. At each locus, five nanograms of human or primate genomic DNA were amplified with AmpliTaq gold
(Applied Biosystems) and the touchdown PCR protocol
was used with the Applied Biosystems 9700 thermal
cyclers. The touchdown protocol conditions were the following: we started reactions with 9 min heating at 94°C,
followed by 5 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 65°C, and
30 sec at 72°C, subsequently followed by 21 cycles at the
same conditions, except lowering the annealing temperature by 0.5°C at each cycle (to 55°C), continued by 15

cycles of 30 sec annealing at 94°C, 30 sec at 55°C, and 30
sec at 72°C, and finished by 10 min of final extension at
72°C. Indels were initially detected by PCR amplification,
analyzed on 4% agarose gels using 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels
were run for three hours at 100 volts and stained with 0.5
ug/mL EtBr for 30 min. PCR primer sets were tested on all
189 samples.
A subset of 12 human and 12 primate samples was
selected for sequencing those fragments that exhibited
indel polymorphisms in the larger panel. The subset
included: European (n = 3), Asian (n = 3), American
Indian (n = 3), Senegalese (n = 3), African American (n =
3), Botswanian (n = 3), gorilla (n = 4), chimpanzee (n =
3), bonobo (n = 3), Sumatran (n = 2), and Borneo orangutan (n = 2) samples. PCR products from the subset were
sequenced by using ABI BigDye Terminator and ABI
PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Sequence results were analyzed with
Sequencher 4.2 software. Each experimental sequence was
checked against the public datasets and reanalyzed as
described above for indels, because some were different
from the genomic sequences in the databases.
