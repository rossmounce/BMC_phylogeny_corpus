Identification, classification and evolution of Owl
Monkeys (Aotus, Illiger 1811)
Albert N Menezes1, Cibele R Bonvicino2,3, Hector N Seuánez1,2*

Abstract
Background: Owl monkeys, belonging to the genus Aotus, have been extensively used as animal models in
biomedical research but few reports have focused on the taxonomy and phylogeography of this genus. Moreover,
the morphological similarity of several Aotus species has led to frequent misidentifications, mainly at the
boundaries of their distribution. In this study, sequence data from five mitochondrial regions and the nuclear,
Y-linked, SRY gene were used for species identification and phylogenetic reconstructions using well characterized
specimens of Aotus nancymaae, A. vociferans, A. lemurinus, A. griseimembra, A. trivirgatus, A. nigriceps, A. azarae
boliviensis and A. infulatus.
Results: The complete MT-CO1, MT-TS1, MT-TD, MT-CO2, MT-CYB regions were sequenced in 18 Aotus specimens.
ML and Bayesian topologies of concatenated data and separate regions allowed for the proposition of a tentative
Aotus phylogeny, indicating that Aotus diverged some 4.62 Million years before present (MYBP). Similar analyses
with included GenBank specimens were useful for assessing species identification of deposited data.
Conclusions: Alternative phylogenetic reconstructions, when compared with karyotypic and biogeographic data,
led to the proposition of evolutionary scenarios questioning the conventional diversification of this genus in
monophyletic groups with grey and red necks. Moreover, genetic distance estimates and haplotypic differences
were useful for species validations.

Background
The small-sized neotropical primates with unique nocturnal habits, known as “owl monkeys” or “night monkeys” are grouped in the genus Aotus. This genus is
widespread across several biomes of South America, and
in Panama at the northwestern part of its distribution
(Figure 1). Several Aotus species have been extensively
used as animal models for vaccine research, vision physiology and susceptibility to viral infections but few
reports have focused on the taxonomy and phylogeography of this genus. Moreover, several surveys on the distribution of neotropical primates have not included owl
monkeys because their nocturnal habit makes them elusive to field workers [1,2].
Early taxonomic studies of Aotus were mainly based
on pelage coloration [3] and karyotyping [4-8], leading
to the revision of the taxonomic status of several species

[9] and the description of new ones [10]. In Hershkovitz’s taxonomic revision, two novel species were
described, comprising a total of nine species divided in
two groups with different pelage coloration (red neck
and grey neck). Aotus taxonomy and evolution has also
been analyzed based on morphologic, karyologic and
carbonic anhydrase II electrophoretic data [11,12] while
phylogenetic reconstructions were later inferred based
on partial cytochrome oxidase COII DNA data [13,14].
A study of grey neck species [15], mainly based on karyotypic data, recognized at least seven species of this
group, A. brumbacki, A. griseimembra, A. lemurinus, A.
trivirgatus, A. vociferans, A. zonalis and a presumably
novel one named A. jorgehernandezi.
The morphological similarity of Aotus species has led
to frequent misidentifications, mainly at the borderlines
of their distributions where more than one species might
be captured at collecting sites. Care should be taken
when selecting specimens for taxonomic and phylogenetic studies although the karyotype of most Aotus species is well known and might be useful for their

identification. In fact, precise identification is crucial for
biomedical studies using Aotus as animal models. Several
studies suggested that grey neck species were susceptible
to malaria contrary to the presumably resistant red neck
species [10,11] although the red neck species A. azarae
boliviensis and A. infulatus were found to be susceptible
to Plasmodium falciparum [16,17] while different Plasmodium species or strains showed varying degrees of
pathogenicity among Aotus species. Similarly, different
Aotus species displayed manifold phenotypes to HIV-1
restriction by tetherin [18], an integral membrane protein
that prevents budding of nascent retroviral particles in
infected cells [19]. Tetherin alleles from A. nancymaae
and A. vociferans potently restricted HIV-1 replication
while those from A. griseimembra failed to do so, showing that closely related species might express different
restriction phenotypes [20]. These findings are illustrative
of the need of precise species identification for validating
biomedical research.
Here we report a study of Aotus with five mitochondrial DNA sequences and one Y-linked gene and used

these markers for species identification and phylogenetic
reconstructions. This allowed us to reassess several GenBank specimens, analyze the species status of Aotus taxa
and infer putative evolutionary scenarios based on biogeographic and karyotypic data.

Methods
Samples

We analyzed 18 Aotus specimens belonging to eight
Aotus taxa and two Saimiri sciureus (Table 1). Figure 1
shows the geographic distribution of Aotus species and
sites of collection. Skull and skins of Aotus trivirgatus
(TR1 and TR2; field numbers CRB1479 and CRB2597,
respectively) were deposited in the mammal collections
of Museu Nacional (MN), Universidade Federal do Rio
de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (catalog numbers
MN69297 and MN53667, respectively).
DNA isolation, amplification and sequencing

DNA was extracted from blood or liver tissue preserved
in ethanol following standard procedures [21].

Cytochrome b DNA was amplified with primers L14724
[22] and Citb2 [23], and amplified products were labeled
with primers Citb AloAotR [24] and Citb AloAotF [24],
Citb Alo [23] and Citb Aot (5′-CATGAGGCCAAATATCATTCTGAGG-3′). Cytochrome Oxidase Units I
and II were amplified with two primer pairs: CO1F/
CO1R (5′-ATGCTTACTCAGCCATTTTA-3′ and 5′TTTGAGGAGAAAGCTTCTC-3′ respectively) and
CO1F3/CO2R2 (5′-TTGCTATCCCTACTGGGGTAAA3′ and 5′-GGTCTTTAACTTAAAAGGTTAATGCTARRTA-3′ repectively). Amplified products were
sequenced with primers CO1R2 (5-AATGGCTCCTAGAATTGAAGAAA-3), CO2F1 5′ CTCCTCCTTATCACACATTT 3′) and CO2F2 (5′ TAACYCACACCA
GCACCATA 3′). SRY DNA was amplified with primers
SRY- [25] and SW2 [26]; internal primers SRY 2i- and
SRY 2i+ were used for sequencing [25]. Cytochrome b
DNA of A. griseimembra and A. trivirgatus has been
previously reported [20].
All fragments were amplified under the following conditions: 94° (3 min); 35 cycles of 94° (30 sec), 55° (45 sec),
72° (90 sec); and a final extension of 72° (3 min). Amplified
products were purified using Illustra GFX PCR DNA and

Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). Sequencing
was carried out with ABI Prism™ 377 and ABI 3730 DNA
Analyzers, manually aligned with Chromas Lite version
2.01 [27] and Bioedit [28] and deposited in GenBank.
Nomenclature of mitochondrial DNA sequences were
MT-CO1 for cytochrome C oxidase subunit I, MT-TS1
for tRNA serine 1, MT-TD for tRNA aspartic acid, MTCO2 for cytochrome C oxidase subunit II, MT-CYB for
cytochrome b, and SRY for the Y chromosome “sex
determining region Y” gene following HGNC rules
(latest accession on January 2010 [29,30]).
Analyses of molecular data

Separate analyses were carried out with the following
DNA datasets: (1) Dat-CON, with concatenated MTCO1, MT-CO2 and MT-CYB sequences; (2) Dat-CO1,
with MT-CO1 sequences; (3) Dat-CO2, with MT-CO2
sequences; (4) Dat-CYB, with MT-CYB sequences. (5)
Dat-SRY, with SRY sequences. A partition homogeneity
test [31] implemented in PAUP* 4.0b10 [32] was performed using 1,000 replications and 100 random addition replicates to compare phylogenetic signals between
different data partitions in Dat-CON.

A complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of Cebus
albifrons ([GenBank:AJ309866]) and MT-CO1, MT-TS1,
MT-TD, MT-CO2, MT-CYB data from two Saimiri
sciureus sequenced by us (SA1 and SA2) were used as
outgroups as was the SRY DNA sequence of Cebus albifrons ([GenBank:AF338385]).
The best model of evolution for each dataset was estimated with the Akaike information criterion test [33]
with modifications (AIC2) [34] and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [35] with Modelgenerator 0.85 [36].
Estimates of sequence divergence were calculated and
constructed with pairwise deletion using PAML 4.4 [37]
except for Dat-SRY due the low number of variable sites.
Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were obtained with
PAUP* 4.0b10 [32] by heuristic searches with the treebisection-reconnection algorithm (TBR) and 100 random
addition sequences. Additionally, 1,000 bootstrap replicates indices were obtained with GARLI version 0.96 [38]
(available in http://garli.nescent.org). Bayesian posterior
probabilities were computed using the Metropoliscoupled Markov chain Monte Carlo method
(MCMCMC) with MrBayes 3.1.1 [39], by running four
chains with 20,000,000 generations. Trees were sampled
every 100 generations and the first 10% were discarded as
the “burn-in” phase before computing a consensus tree
with PAUP*. Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) were
obtained from the 50% majority rule consensus of
the remaining trees. Bayesian analyses for Dat-CON were
performed in a partitioned framework, allowing specific
parameter estimation for each locus. Comparisons of
alternative topologies (Additional file 1) were carried out
with BASEML of PAML 4.4 package [37].
The time of divergence between species was estimated
with Dat-CON using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with BEAST 1.5.3 [40], with
unlinked substitution and unlinked relaxed clock [41]
models for each gene. We used 21.81 ± 1.24 Million
years before present (MYBP) as the time of divergence
of Aotus from Cebus/Saimiri, and 19.05 ± 1.5 MYBP as
the time of divergence of Cebus from Saimiri [42], with
a normal prior distribution, a randomly generated starting tree and chain length of 20,000,000 generations with
parameter samples every 1,000 steps. Monophyletic
taxon sets were assumed for congruence with topologies
produced by ML and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions. For acceptable mixing and convergence to the stationary distribution, the first 10% were discarded as
burn-in using Tracer [43] and TreeAnnotator 1.5.4 of
BEAST 1.5.3 [40] package.
Additionally, GenBank sequences from several Aotus
specimens (Table 2) were compared with analogous
datasets (Dat-CO1, Dat-CO2 and Dat-CYB). ML and
Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out
using the same parameters as above, although branch

Page 4 of 15

lengths were not estimated because several GenBank
specimens contained only partial sequence data. Only
Cebus albifrons was used as outgroup in the analysis of
MT-CO2 sequences from GenBank.
Aminoacid sequences were deduced, for MT-CO1,
MT-CO2, MT-CYB and the coding region of SRY (nt
177 - 803) using MEGA 4.02 [44]. The best models of
evolution for each deduced protein were obtained using
the same parameters as above. ML topologies with 1,000
bootstrap replicates were constructed with PHYML 3.0
[45] and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions were
carried out as previously described.
Karyotypic analyses

Cell suspensions of A. nigriceps NI2 were prepared with
short-term cultures of 46 hours in Dulbecco’s minimal
essential medium, enriched with fetal serum (20%), phytohemagglutinin (2%), and colchicine (10-6 M) during
the last two hours. Short term, bone marrow cultures of
TR1 female specimen of A. trivirgatus from Barcelos
were prepared in the field and incubated for 2-hours in
RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum (20%), colchicine
(10-6 M) and ethidium bromide (5 μg/mL).

Results
Gene markers

The complete MT-CO1, MT-TS1, MT-TD, MT-CO2,
MT-CYB genes were sequenced in 18 Aotus specimens
belonging to eight taxa (Table 1) and Saimiri sciureus
SA1 and SA2 except for the initial 9 bp region of the
MT-CO1 5′-region of SA2. A region containing five SRY
regions (832 pb) was also sequenced: (1) the untranslated region upstream of the start codon (nt 1-176), (2)
the codon region upstream of the HMG box (nt 177350), (3) the HMG box domain (nt 351-582), (4) the
downstream coding region (nt 583-800), (5) the untranslated downstream region (nt 801-829) from at least one
specimen of the following species: A. azarae boliviensis,
A. infulatus, A. nigriceps, A. trivirgatus, A. vociferans,
A. lemurinus and A. griseimembra (Table 1). The size of
each Dataset, number of specimens, haplotypes, variable
sites, parsimony informative sites, number of protein
variable sites and number of deduced proteins are listed
in Table 3. Genetic distance estimates are shown in
Table 4.
Comparisons with Cebus albifrons SRY ([GenBank:
AF338385]) showed a minimum of 45 nucleotide substitutions and one deletion in all Aotus corresponding to
nucleotides 672 to 674 of C. albifrons.
Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences

The partition homogeneity test did not show significant
differences between loci (p = 0.116; p ≥ 0.05) supporting
the congruence and subsequent combination of the

parameter (HKY + G) was indicated by AIC2 and the
BIC tests for phylogenetic reconstructions using all
mitochondrial sequences datasets. For SRY analysis,
both tests indicated the Kimura’s 2-parameter model
(K80) [47].
The ML topology resulting from analysis of SRY data
(Figure 2) showed three collapsed lineages: one leading to
A. vociferans, a second one leading to A. griseimembra
and A. lemurinus, and a third one leading to A. trivirgatus A. nigriceps A. azarae boliviensis, and A. infulatus.
ML and Bayesian reconstructions using Dat-CON
showed two sister lineages (Figure 3A-B), one leading
to the most basal offshoot represented by A. nancymaae and another to a clade grouping the seven other
Aotus taxa. This clade split in two sister lineages, one
leading to A. vociferans and the other one further splitting in (A. griseimembra, A. lemurinus) and to a more
derived clade (A. trivirgatus (A. nigriceps (A. infulatus,
A. azarae))).
Two ML topologies resulting from analysis of DatCO1 and the consensus topology (Additional file 2A)
showed a similar arrangement to the one resulting from
Dat-CON analysis, except that NA2 did not group with
the other A. nancymaae specimens. Bayesian reconstruction (Additional file 2B) was identical with the DatCON topology.
The ML topology produced by analysis of Dat-CO2
(Additional file 3A) showed few differences with the one
produced by Dat-CON, with a paraphyletic arrangement

of A. infulatus while, in the Bayesian reconstruction
(Additional file 3B), specimen IN3 grouped with
A. azarae boliviensis (AB1 and AB2) rather than with
other A. infulatus (IN1 and IN2). Moreover, the
branches leading to A. vociferans, A. lemurinus and
A. griseimembra collapsed in the Bayesian topology.
The ML topology derived from Dat-CYB (Additional
file 4A) showed two clades, one grouping (A. vociferans
(A. trivirgatus (A. nigriceps (A. azarae boliviensis, A
infulatus)))), and another grouping (A. nancymaae
(A. griseimembra, A. lemurinus)) while, in the Bayesian
reconstruction (Additional file 4B) the branches leading
to A. vociferans and A. nancymaae collapsed, as was
also the case of the branch leading to A. griseimembra
and A. lemurinus.
Comparisons between different topologies using DatCON, carried out with BASEML are shown in Additional file 1. These trees were constructed taking in consideration the differences between the following
topologies: (1) Dat-CON ML (Figure 3A); (2) Dat-CO2
Bayesian (Additional file 3B); (3) Dat-CYB ML (Additional file 4A); (4) Dat-CYB Bayesian (Additional file
4B); (5) Dat-CON ML (Figure 3A) with collapsed low
supported lineages (A. nancymaae, A. vociferans, A.
lemurinus and A. griseimembra); (6) Dat-CO2 ML
(Additional file 3A) with collapsed low supported
lineages (A. nancymaae, A. vociferans, A. lemurinus/A.
griseimembra and A. trivirgatus). Topology 1 showed
the highest RELL bootstrap proportion (pRELL = 0.79)
although topologies 3 and 4 could not be rejected by
the Shimodaira and Hasegawa test [48] (p-values = 0.62

Phylogenetic analyses of deduced protein sequences

The AIC2 and BIC test indicated the MtMam model
[49] with invariable sites parameter (MtMam+I) as the
best model phylogenetic reconstructions based on MTCO1 and MT-CO2 protein data, while MtMam with
Gamma shape parameter (MtMam+G) was indicated for
MT-CYB, and the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) [50]
model for SRY. Analyses of aminoacid sequences (Additional file 5) showed different arrangements and less
supported nodes than their respective ML nucleotide
topologies. Comparisons of protein and nucleotide ML
topologies showed the following differences: (1) A. infulatus (IN2), A. azarae boliviensis (AB1), A. nigriceps
(NI2) and A. trivirgatus (TR3) shared the same SRY protein sequence; (2) A. azarae boliviensis (AB1, AB2) and
A. infulatus (IN1, IN2, IN3) shared the same MT-CO1
protein sequence, as was the case of A. griseimembra
(GR1, GR2) with A. trivirgatus (TR3), and of A. vociferans (VO1) with A. nancymaae (NA2). On the other
side, another A. vociferans (VO2) appeared as the most
basal lineage; (3) A. trivirgatus (TR1, TR2, TR3) shared
the same MT-CO2 protein sequence, A. azarae boliviensis (AB1, AB2), A infulatus (IN1, IN2, IN3), A nigriceps
(NI1, NI2), A lemurinus (LE1), A griseimembra (GR2), A
vociferans (VO1, VO2) and A. nancymaae (NA1, NA2,
NA3) shared another protein sequence while one A. griseimembra (GR1) showed a third protein. Furthermore,
the topology did not group Saimiri with Cebus; (4) the
MT-CYB protein arrangement showed a clade (A. trivirgatus (A. vociferans (A. lemurinus (A. griseimembra))))
with A. nancymaae specimens as three basal lineages.

VII previously described by Ma et al. [8]. Analysis of the
Aotus trivirgatus female showed 2n = 50; the chromosome complement containing 12 pairs of biarmed chromosomes varying in size from large to small, and 13
pairs of acrocentric chromosomes varying in size from
medium to small.

Discussion
Molecular markers and species identification

Our findings showed different MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MTCYB and SRY haplotypes between Aotus species
although some SRY haplotypes differed by only one
nucleotide (see Figure 2A), as was the case of A. infulatus (IN2) when compared to A. azarae boliviensis (AB1)
and A. nigriceps (NI2).
Identification based on MT-CO2 was shown to be
unreliable for closely related species in view of (i) small

gene size, (ii) relative paucity of parsimony informative
sites, and (iii) low genetic distance between species.
Species identification of several GenBank specimens
was confirmed while the identification of other specimens was reassessed (see Table 2). The identification of
7 A. azarae specimens ([GenBank:EF658652] - [GenBank:EF658656, GenBank:EU179516, GenBank:
EU179517]) and one A. azarae boliviensis ([GenBank:
U36846]) could not be confirmed because only partial
sequence data were available, lacking phylogenetic resolution. Specimen [GenBank:DQ321669], reported as
A. brumbacki, could not be confirmed because only partial sequence data were available and a reference specimen was not available for comparison. Finally, specimen
[GenBank:AF181085], reported as A. a. azarae, with a
presumably complete MT-CO2 sequence, grouped with
Saimiri sciureus. This sequence presented several sites

with missing or ambiguous data and lacked a stop
codon, suggesting a nuclear mitochondrial DNA insertion (Numt).
Phylogenetic considerations

Analyses of the different datasets showed that Dat-CO1
contained the highest number of PI sites (182), closely
followed by Dat-CYB (181), while Dat-CO2, showed the

lowest number (66). This might be related to the smaller
size of MT-CO2 (696 bp) respective to MT-CO1 (1,557
bp) and MT-CYB (1,140 bp) although a similar number
of PI sites was found in these two last genes regardless
of their difference in size. These findings, and the fact
that several MT-CO2 intraspecific distance estimates
were higher than interspecific estimates, and lack of
resolution between A. azarae and A. infulatus, indicated

Menezes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/248

that MT-CO2 was the least reliable marker for analyzing
Aotus phylogeny. Thus, phylogenetic reconstructions
based on MT-CO2 [13,14] must be carefully
reconsidered.
Phylogenetic reconstructions resulting from Dat-CON
provided the most coherent topologies (ML and Bayesian), with strong support for most branches while analysis of MT-CO1 resulted in very similar phylogenetic
reconstructions, only differing by the position of NA2 in
the ML topology (Additional file 2A). In the MT-CO1
protein topology (Additional file 5B), however, the
shared sequence between A. griseimembra and A trivirgatus pointed to the close relation of these two grey
neck species although A. lemurinus failed to group with
A. griseimembra. On the other hand, the MT-CO1 protein shared by the red neck species A. nancymmae and
the grey neck species A. vociferans indicated a close
relation between them. Analyses of MT-CO2 showed
paraphyletic arrangements in both ML and Bayesian
topologies (Additional file 3) while the MT-CO2 protein
topology (Additional file 5C) could only distinguish
A. trivirgatus species apart from the others. The MTCYB ML topology (Additional file 4) differed from all
other DNA topologies by showing a weakly supported
grouping of A. griseimembra/A. lemurinus with A. nancymaae (two grey neck species with one red neck species). The MT-CYB protein topology (Additional file
5D) showed one cluster of red neck species, a second
cluster grouping all grey neck species, and placed the
red neck A. nancymaae specimens as basal offshoots.
The monophyly of Aotus was corroborated by a single
three base deletion in Aotus respective to Cebus SRY
(Figure 2). SRY from A. vociferans (VO2), A. griseimembra (GR2) and A. lemurinus (LE1) shared two synapormophies (C and A at positions 306 and 593,
respectively) with Cebus albifrons. The grouping of the
red neck species A. nigriceps, A. infulatus, A. azarae
boliviensis with the grey neck species A. trivirgatus in
the SRY topology and the common SRY protein
sequence shared by these species (Additional file 5A)
coincided in showing their close relation.
Evolutionary, karyological and taxonomic considerations

Our phylogenetic reconstructions question the classical
grouping of red neck and grey neck species proposed by
Hershkovitz [10]. All phylogenetic reconstructions based
on mtDNA showed that the lineage leading to the grey
neck species A. trivirgatus was a sister lineage of the
one leading to the red neck clade (A. nigriceps
(A. azarae, A. infulatus)). If the proposed topologies
were accepted as a valid representation of the evolutionary divergence of Aotus the red neck pelage trait must
had appeared independently in A. nancymaae and in the
red neck clade (A. nigriceps (A. azarae, A. infulatus))

Page 11 of 15

and this would also be acceptable in the event of an
alternative polytomy (Figure 5) which might be proposed in view of the low value of bootstrap and posterior probability indices at some nodes (Figure 3,
Additional files 2 and 3). Moreover, phylogenetic reconstructions based on SRY and MT-CO1 protein sequence
data showed close relations between red neck and grey
neck species; this latter topology as well as the MT-CYB
topology (Additional file 5D) corroborated that the red
neck trait was not monophyletic. On the other hand,
the monophyly of the grey neck group was only apparent in the MT-CYB topology, albeit with low support.
Lack of SRY data from A. nancymaae does not allow us
to infer the position of this species using this nuclear
marker. Analyses of carbonic anhydrase II biochemical
patterns, karyology and morphology suggested that Aotus
split in two separate clades, one comprising the red neck
species and another with the grey neck species [11].
Cytonuclear discordances, as the ones resulting from differences between nuclear and mtDNA phylogenic reconstructions might well result from retention of ancestral
polymorphisms during a short time of evolutionary divergence or reticulate evolution represented by historic episodes of hybridisation.
Biogeographic data indicate that red neck species are
distributed south of the Solimões-Amazonas River and
grey neck species north of this river except for the red
neck A. nancymaae and the grey A. vociferans, the only
Aotus species occurring north and south this river, and in
sympatry in some localities [10] (Figure 1). Contrary to
the proposition of Hershkovitz [10], that A. nancymaae
emerged south of the Solimões-Amazonas, originating all
other red-neck species and migrating to the north of this
river, our phylogenetic reconstructions indicate the alternative possibility that A. nancymaae might have emerged
north of the Solimões-Amazonas, originating the greyneck group, in agreement with the proposed geographic
origin of the ancestral Aotus population [11].
Altogether, the genus Aotus comprises a suite of karyotypically rearranged species consequently to extensive
shuffling of their chromosome complement respective
to other neotropical primates and man. This has been
demonstrated by reciprocal chromosome painting
between humans and A. nancymaae as well as with A.
nancymaae chromosomes painted with wooly monkey
whole chromosome probes [51]. This study showed that
A. nancymaae karyotype that only three human syntenic
groups were conserved, coexisting with 17 derived
human homologous associations, while a minimum of
14 fissions and 13 fusions were required to derive the A.
nancymaae karyotype from that of the ancestral karyotype of neotropical primates.
The monophyly of the red neck species A. azarae, A.
infulatus and A. nigriceps was in agreement with

Figure 5 Proposed scenarios of Aotus evolution. Left: Tentative Aotus phylogeny as indicated by Dat-CON analyses based on 8 Aotus species
herein analyzed. The presumptive positions of A. miconax, A. brumbacki and A. zonalis are based on biogeographic and karyotypic data [11,15].
Diploid chromosome number (2n) is indicated. This arrangement requires at least two separate events accounting for red neck pelage. Right:

karyologic data showing that they shared the same
X1X1X2X2/X1X2Y sex chromosome system, contrary to
other species with an XX/XY sex chromosome system
(Figure 5). In all analyses based on DNA sequence data,
the grey neck A. trivirgatus was the closest species to
this red neck group, suggesting that A. azarae/A. infulatus/A. nigriceps might have originated from a more
recent common ancestor with A. trivirgatus in eastern
Amazonia, rather than in western Amazonia from an
older common ancestor with A. nancymaae (a species
with an XX/XY sex chromosome system). Determining
the sex chromosome system of A. trivirgatus might be
elucidating for a better understanding of this scenario.
Aotus trivirgatus showed 2n = 50 one female (TR1)
from Barcelos (Amazonas State, Brazil), at the southwestern limit of its distribution (Figure 1). Recently, a new
Aotus species, A. jorgehernandezi, has been described
based on karyotypic data of a female specimen of
unknown provenance [15,52] with the same diploid
number as the Aotus trivirgatus karyotyped by us. Other
specimens collected near Manaus, with 2n = 52 in one
female, 2n = 51 in one male, and 2n = 51 or 52 in
another male, were previously attributed to A. trivirgatus [53]. However, as the distribution of Aotus species
were not clearly delimited, their identification is

questionable; in fact Manaus (Figure 1) is located at the
confluence of the distribution of A. vociferans, A. nigriceps and A. trivirgatus.
Aotus specimens captured in Samuel Hydroeletric dam
reservoir, the same locality of our A. azarae boliviensis
specimes, showed a 2n♂ = 49; 2n♀ = 50 karyotype [54].
The karyotypic similarity between A. infulatus and A.
azarae suggested a close proximity and recent common
ancestry, a finding coincident with their low interspecific
distance estimates and their unresolved arrangement
when analyzing Dat-CO2, and by the recent time of
their evolutionary divergence (0.53 MYBP; Figure 2B).
Aotus azarae boliviensis separated from A. infulatus
when analysing Dat-CON, Dat-CO1 and Dat-CYB
(Figures 2, Additional files 2 and 4); the insertion of one
cytosine in position 59 of MT-TS1 in all A. azarae boliviensis being exclusive of this species. These differences
as well as the presence of different SRY haplotypes justify the status of A. infulatus as a valid species rather
than a junior synonym of A. azarae [55]. This taxonomic arrangement implies that the eastern distribution
of A. azarae is limited by the rivers Tapajós-Juruema.
We agree with Silva Jr & Fernandez [56] and Silva Jr et
al. [57] in considering the A. infulatus distribution from
southeast Amapá, north of the Amazonas River and the

Menezes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:248
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/248

Islands of the mouth of the Amazonas to south of this
river, from the Rio Tapajós, in the west, to the left bank
to Rio Parnaíba in the east (Figure 1).
Nictipithecus felinus von Spix, 1823 was considered a
junior synonym of A. infulatus by Elliot [58] and a
junior synonym of A. trivirgatus by Groves [55]. Nictipithecus felinus was first described with an ochraceus
neck (similar to A. infulatus and unlike the grey neck A.
trivirgatus) and illustrated by von Spix [59] in his original description, while the illustration of Nictipithecus
vociferans showed a grey neck. The N. felinus holotype
was collected in “les environs de la capitale de Pará”, or
nearby Belém, the capital of Pará state (Brazil). These
findings indicated that Nictipithecus felinus was a junior
synonym of A. infulatus, a reason why we restrict the
type locality of A. infulatus to Belém, Pará state, Brazil.
Our findings indicated that A. lemurinus, A. griseimembra and A. vociferans are valid species. This is because
genetic distance estimates between A. lemurinus and A.
griseimembra were higher than many other interspecific
estimates and even higher when comparing A. vociferans
with A. lemurinus and A. griseimembra (Table 4), and
because A. lemurinus and A. griseimembra differed by
more SRY replacements than between any two sister
lineages in our ML topology (see Figure 2). These findings argue against the proposition that A. lemurinus and
A. griseimembra are junior synonyms of A. vociferans
[11] and in agreement with a recent karyologic study [15]
indicating that these species are valid taxa.
Our findings indicated that the genus Aotus diverged
some 4.62 MYBP (with 95% HPD intervals of 3.07 6.43 MYBP), and probably before the previous estimate
of 3.3 MYPB [13]. Ma [60] suggested that geographic
isolation in geographic niches led to karyotypic diversity in Aotus. According to Plautz et al. [14], the 100m
rise of sea level over the past 5 million years probably
allocated Aotus species in three refuge groups, one
comprising A. vociferans, A. lemurinus, A. griseimembra in the Andean foothills, A. trivirgatus in the northwestern Guyanan shield, and A. nigriceps, A. azarae, A.
infulatus and A. nancymaae in the Brazilian shield
refuge. Our findings suggested that A. nancymaae
should be included in the Andean foothill refuge rather
than in the Brazilian shield refuge (Figure 5) and that
A. nigriceps, A. azarae and A. infulatus must have
diverged after the rise of sea level while grey neck species and A. nancymaae could have diverged before this
event.

Conclusions
Our findings provided a tentative phylogenetic reconstruction of Aotus and considered an alternative polytomy based on the low support of some critical nodes.
Regardless of these alternatives, however, comparisons

Page 13 of 15

with biogeographic and karyotypic data led to the proposition of an evolutionary scenario that questioned
the classical division of Aotus in grey and red neck
groups. Comparisons of GenBank sequences with data
from well characterized specimens were useful for
assessing the identification of deposited specimens.
Our findings further indicated that A. infulatus, A.
lemurinus, A. griseimembra and A. vociferans are valid
species based on genetic distances and haplotypic
differences.
