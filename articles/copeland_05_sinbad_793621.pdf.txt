Abstract
Background: Of the major families of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, the Pao/BEL family is
probably the least well studied. It is becoming apparent that numerous LTR retrotransposons and other mobile
genetic elements have colonized the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni.
Results: A proviral form of Sinbad, a new LTR retrotransposon, was identified in the genome of S. mansoni.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Sinbad belongs to one of five discreet subfamilies of Pao/BEL like elements.
BLAST searches of whole genomes and EST databases indicated that members of this clade occurred in species
of the Insecta, Nematoda, Echinodermata and Chordata, as well as Platyhelminthes, but were absent from all
plants, fungi and lower eukaryotes examined. Among the deuterostomes examined, only aquatic species harbored
these types of elements. All four species of nematode examined were positive for Sinbad sequences, although
among insect and vertebrate genomes, some were positive and some negative. The full length, consensus Sinbad
retrotransposon was 6,287 bp long and was flanked at its 5'- and 3'-ends by identical LTRs of 386 bp. Sinbad
displayed a triple Cys-His RNA binding motif characteristic of Gag of Pao/BEL-like elements, followed by the
enzymatic domains of protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), RNAseH, and integrase, in that order. A phylogenetic
tree of deduced RT sequences from 26 elements revealed that Sinbad was most closely related to an unnamed
element from the zebrafish Danio rerio and to Saci-1, also from S. mansoni. It was also closely related to Pao from
Bombyx mori and to Ninja of Drosophila simulans. Sinbad was only distantly related to the other schistosome LTR
retrotransposons Boudicca, Gulliver, Saci-2, Saci-3, and Fugitive, which are gypsy-like. Southern hybridization and
bioinformatics analyses indicated that there were about 50 copies of Sinbad in the S. mansoni genome. The
presence of ESTs representing transcripts of Sinbad in numerous developmental stages of S. mansoni along with
the identical 5'- and 3'-LTR sequences suggests that Sinbad is an active retrotransposon.
Conclusion: Sinbad is a Pao/BEL type retrotransposon from the genome of S. mansoni. The Pao/BEL group appears
to be comprised of at least five discrete subfamilies, which tend to cluster with host species phylogeny. Pao/BEL
type elements appear to have colonized only the genomes of the Animalia. The distribution of these elements in
the Ecdysozoa, Deuterostomia, and Lophotrochozoa is discontinuous, suggesting horizontal transmission and/or
efficient elimination of Pao-like mobile genetic elements from some genomes.

Background
Schistosoma mansoni, the African blood fluke and etiological agent of intestinal schistosomiasis, is endemic in
numerous countries in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean and northeastern South America. The life cycle of S.
mansoni involves parasitism of both humans and aquatic
snails of the genus Biomphalaria. Cercariae, the infectious
larvae, emerge from the snails into lakes and fresh water
streams, where they initiate human infection by direct
penetration of the skin. Within the infected person, the
worms develop into male and female adults within the
portal system blood vessels and mesenteric veins of the
intestines. Eggs released from the female parasite into the
blood traverse the intestinal wall and are passed out with
the feces. Among the tropical diseases, schistosomiasis
ranks second only to malaria in terms of morbidity and
mortality [1] and has proved refractory to control by the
more conventional public health approaches. No vaccine
is yet available.
Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) represent a major force
driving the evolution of eukaryotic genomes [2-4] and
play an important role in the establishment of genome
size [5]. One of the major categories of MGEs is the long
terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposable element, i.e. the
LTR retrotransposons and the retroviruses [6]. These elements are of interest for their potential for horizontal
transmission, as well as their ability to shed light on phylogenies of their host organisms when solely vertically
transmitted. The genomes of schistosomes, blood flukes
of the phylum Platyhelminthes, are estimated at ~270
megabase pairs (MB) per haploid genome [7], arrayed on
seven pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes [8,9]. Both the evolution and size of this genome
may be highly influenced by mobile genetic elements.
Indeed, more than half of the schistosome genome
appears to be composed of, or derived from, repetitive
sequences, to a large extent from retrotransposable elements [10,12]. Mobile genetic elements colonizing the
genome of S. mansoni are of interest both for their potential in developing tools for schistosome transgenesis and
for their influence on the evolution and structure of the
schistosome genome [13,14]. Previously characterized
schistosome MGEs include SINE-like retroposons [15,16],
long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons [12,17,18],
non-LTR retrotransposons [10,11], and DNA transposons
related to bacterial IS1016 insertion sequences [19]. Boudicca, the first LTR retrotransposon characterized from the
genome of S. mansoni [20] belongs to the gypsy -like retrotransposons, one of three highly divergent groups of LTR
retrotransposons: the Gypsy/Ty3 group, the Copia/Ty1
group and the Pao/BEL group [21]. Although active replication of schistosome retrotransposons has not been
established, transcripts encoding reverse transcriptase
(RT) and endonuclease are detectable [10,11,22], as is RT

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/20

activity in parasite extracts [23], suggesting that at least
some of these elements are actively mobile within the
genome. Indeed, actively replicating MGEs have been
described from other platyhelminths as RNA intermediates [24] and DNA transposons [25,26]. Furthermore, the
schistosome retrotransposons characterized so far are
highly represented within the genome with copy numbers
of up to 10,000 [10,20].
It has been suggested that the Pao-like elements exhibit a
host range limited to insects and nematodes [27]. More
recently, however, Pao-like sequences have been reported
from vertebrates including the teleost fishes Takifugu
rubripes and Danio rerio [28]. Here we have characterized a
new Pao-like element from the genome of S. mansoni,
which we have named Sinbad after the mariner-explorer
Sinbad from the classical Persian/Arabic tales of the "1001
Arabian Nights" (e.g., [29]). (Sinbad roved through near
Eastern countries where schistosomiasis remains endemic
even today [30].) Further, we investigated the phylogenetic distribution of Pao-like elements related to Sinbad
and report that there is a discontinuous distribution of
these elements throughout the Ecdysozoa, Deuterostomia, and Lophotrochozoa that suggests horizontal transmission and/or efficient elimination of Pao-like mobile
genetic elements from some host genomes.

Results
A LTR retrotransposon in BAC 33-N-3
BLAST analysis indicated the presence in BAC 30-H-16 of
a reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding sequence with identity to Pao and other Pao-like retrotransposons including
Ninja and MAX (not shown). Using a probe based on an
RT encoding segment of the end sequence of BAC 30-H16, we identified 14 positive clones in the S. mansoni BAC
library [31]. DotPlot analysis of a 7,531 bp portion of one
of the positive BACs, 33-N-3, revealed the presence of two
identical, direct repeat sequences of 386 bp separated by
~5.5 kb of intervening sequence, suggesting the presence
of an LTR retrotransposon of 6,287 bp in length. This dot
matrix is presented in Figure 1, with a map predicting the
size and general domain structure of the new element provided below the matrix (both matrix and map share the
same size scale). The direct repeats appeared to be LTRs,
and included the promoter initiation motifs CAAT (positions 347–350) and TATA (positions 111–114 and 216–
219), transcriptional signals for RNA polymerase II. The
LTRs begin with TGT and end with TCA. These motifs
(TGN/NCA), known as the direct inverted repeats (DIR),
are common to LTRs of many retrotransposons and retroviruses [32]. BLAST searches of GenBank revealed that this
retrotransposon closely resembled the elements Pao and
Ninja, followed by other Pao/BEL type retrotransposons.
We have termed this new retrotransposon Sinbad. The
coding region between the two LTRs of Sinbad was

disrupted by several stop and frameshift mutations (as has
been seen in many other retrotransposons (e.g., see Ref.
[32]), although the reverse transcriptase, retroviral protease, and gag-like domains of Sinbad were clearly evident.
The sequence of the copy of Sinbad from BAC 33-N-3 has
been assigned GenBank accession AY506538.
Pao-like nucleoprotein, protease and reverse transcriptase
Inspection of the region downstream of the 5'-LTR of Sinbad revealed the presence of an ORF encoding retroviral
gag and pol-like proteins. A multiple sequence alignment
of some of the key structural and enzymatic domains is
presented in Figure 2, with the Sinbad sequence and

orthologous regions from Pao, Roo, BEL, MAX and Ninja.
The Cys-His box is a highly conserved cysteine and histidine based motif of the nucleocapsid protein (part of the
gag polyprotein) of retroviruses and retroviral like elements [33]. Whereas many other retroviral and retrotransposon families exhibit Cys-His boxes based on a single or
double motif of three cysteine and one histidine residues,
Pao-like elements are characterized by a distinctive triple
Cys-His box [21,27], with zinc finger motifs of CX2CX34HX4C, CX2CX2-4HX4-5C, and CX2-4CX3HX4H. Sinbad
also exhibits the latter type, hallmark triple Cys-His box
motif (Fig. 2, panel A), although neither Sinbad nor Pao
shows a doublet HH in the middle of the third zinc finger

motif, another characteristic of this group of retrotransposons [32]. Notably, Tas, a Pao/BEL like element from
Ascaris lumbricoides does not share this characteristic triple
Cys-His box [34], and though Suzu from Takifugu rubripes
exhibits a triple Cys-His box, its third zinc finger motif
exhibits the structure CX4CX6HHX3C [28]. As illustrated
in Figure 2, panel B, Sinbad exhibited a protease domain
motif ALLDSGS-X98-LIGCD, typical of the LLDXG and
LIG protease motifs conserved in Pao-like retrotransposons [27]. The usual active site tripeptide motif in retroviral aspartic proteases is DTG, with a full conserved
sequence of LLDTG, complemented by another site, a
highly conserved G preceded by two hydrophobic residues, often I or L, which loops around to interact with the
LLDTG [35]. Whereas the Gypsy-like and Copia-like elements exhibit DTG at the active site, Sinbad has DSG, as do
two other Pao-like elements, Roo and MAX. Other Pao-like
elements have even more divergent catalytic domains:
DCG for Kamikaze, GDG for Yamato, and DNG for Moose
[27]. Since only Thr and Ser include the alcohol groups
required for catalysis [35], the non-DT/SG motifs, including the DDG and DEG of Pao and Ninja likely represent
inactivating mutations in non-functional copies of the
retrotransposons.
Nucleotides 2761 to 3375 of the Sinbad sequence from
BAC 33-N-3 encoded a RT domain, a conceptual translation of which was aligned with the RT domain from six
other elements, Pao, Ninja, Roo, BEL, Max, and Saci-1. A
frameshift apparent in the ORF was resolved by inserting
a N at the frameshift site, position 2761. The seven blocks
of conserved RT residues of Pao-like elements, as modified
by Abe et al. [27] from the blocks described by Xiong et al.
[21], are annotated in green in the alignment (Figure 3).
The Pao-like retrotransposons presented in Figure 3 all
exhibited the RT active site motif YV/MDD, in block 5, a
motif conserved in the RT of many other retrotransposons, including the gypsy family [32].
RNAse H and Integrase of Sinbad
An RNaseH domain spanning ~300 amino acid residues
was located carboxyl to RT, in which the conserved active
site motif DAS was apparent [see Additional file 1]. At its
COOH-terminus, the Sinbad pol included an integrase
(IN) domain of ~260 amino acids in length. Integrase
mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome
into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three
domains, the amino-terminal zinc binding domain, a central catalytic domain, and a carboxyl terminal domain
that is a non-specific DNA binding domain [36]. A multiple sequence alignment of the IN zinc binding and central
catalytic (DDE) domain of several informative BEL/Paolike retrotransposons including MAX, Saci-1, Pao, Ninja,
Roo, Suzu, BEL, and Tas as well as Sinbad is presented in
Figure 4. All three domains were apparent in the Sinbad

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/20

sequence. The NH2-terminal zinc-finger region of Sinbad
included two conserved Cys residues and one His residue
characteristic of other zinc finger motifs of IN (Figure 4).
A second His expected here was replaced by Asn in this
copy of Sinbad. The catalytic active site DDE motif of Sinbad's integrase displayed the residue spacing of
D(62)D(49)E. The IN of non-Pao/BEL retrotransposable
elements, for example, Copia, exhibit a DD(35)E motif
[36]. However, the IN of BEL/Pao like elements is unusual
in that there is an expanded number of residues between
the second D and E conserved residues, with DD(45)E for
Pao and DD(53)E for BEL. Sinbad conformed to this BEL/
Pao-like paradigm with a spacing of DD(49)E. Saci-1, also
from S. mansoni, shows DD(49)E, although the IN
domain of these two elements exhibited only 52% identity. The carboxy terminal domain of IN of Sinbad
extended about 135 amino acids beyond the E residue of
the catalytic domain [see Additional file 1].
As noted, the IN of Sinbad exhibited identity to Saci-1
from S. mansoni, and indeed these Pao-like retrotransposons from S. mansoni share substantial identity in
deduced amino acid sequence and in structural organization [37]. This similarity extended to several other
domains including the Triple Cys-His box region of Gag,
32% identical (23/71, Fig. 2A); PR,32% identical (36/111,
Fig. 2B); and RT, 45% identical (106/236, Fig. 3). Whereas
these levels of sequence identity confirmed a close relationship between Sinbad and Saci-1, they also demonstrated that Sinbad
and Saci-1
are distinct
retrotransposons. Finally, Sinbad did not appear to encode
an envelope protein, the retroviral gene product necessary
for extracellular existence and infection [38].
Sinbad, a new Pao/BEL clade retrotransposon, is closely
related to Pao and Ninja
The RT domain of Sinbad was aligned with that of 19 Pao/
BEL retrotransposon family elements, and with RT from
informative Gypsy-like elements, from HIV-1, and Copia
using ClustalW. Bootstrapped trees were then assembled
using the neighbor joining method and Njplot. Copia was
employed as the outgroup to root the tree. The phylogenetic tree confirmed that Sinbad belonged to the Pao/BEL
family of LTR retrotransposons (Figure 5), and revealed
that its two closest relatives were the Saci-1 element from
S. mansoni and an unnamed element from D. rerio, the
zebrafish (BK005570). Sinbad also grouped closely with
Pao and Ninja. Sinbad is clearly distinct from the Gypsy-like
retrotransposons, including Gulliver of Schistosoma japonicum and Boudicca of S.mansoni. Sinbad is also clearly distinct from HIV-1, representative of vertebrate retroviruses,
and from Copia, representative of the Ty1/Copia group of
LTR retrotransposons. Among the 20 BEL/Pao family elements represented in the tree, it was possible to distinguish several subfamilies. First, the outlying subfamily

was a clade including Suzu (from T. rubripes) and an
unnamed element from zebrafish. These are the only two
elements that we have observed in this subfamily, and
both occur in fish genomes. The other two branches of
these retrotransposons include Pao, on the one hand, and
BEL on the other. Moreover, two subfamilies of elements
were apparent within each of the Pao and BEL branches.
For the Pao branch, one sub-family included Pao (from B.
mori), ninja (from D. simulans) and an unnamed element
from Anopheles gambiae (XP_3092181). These subfamily
elements were all from insect genomes. The other subfamily included Sinbad, Saci-1 and the D. rerio element
BK005570; this subfamily has elements from schistosomes (Phylum Platyhelminthes) and fish. On the BEL
branch of the tree, the first subfamily includes elements
solely from nematode genomes – Tas (A. lumbricoides),
several Cer elements from C. elegans, and an unnamed element from C. briggsae (BK005572). The other branch
included BEL itself (from D. melanogaster), Kamikaze (B.
mori), MAX (D. melanogaster) and Moose from A. gambiae.
Members of this fifth subfamily occurred only in insect
genomes.
In addition, a phylogram of IN sequences was assembled
from 14 Pao/BEL family retrotransposons. The tree displayed the same general topography of branches as the
RT-based phylogram and supported our suggestion that
there are (at least) five discrete sub-families of BEL-Pao
family retrotransposons: Tas-like, BEL-like, Pao-like, Sinbad/Saci-1-like, and Suzu-like (not shown; tree available
from corresponding author). In similar fashion to the RT
based tree, Sinbad and Saci-1 were closely related to each
other and to the IN from the unnamed Pao-element from
zebrafish (BK005571).
Copies of Sinbad interspersed throughout the
schistosome genome
Southern hybridization analysis of S. mansoni gDNA, S.
japonicum gDNA and BAC 33-N-3 confirmed the presence
of Sinbad in the S. mansoni genome but indicated it was
absent from the genome of the related schistosome, S.
japonicum (Figure 6). BamH I was expected to cut three
times within Sinbad, whereas Hind III, which cleaves the
BAC 30-H-16 copy of Sinbad, was not predicted to cut
within the sequence of the BAC 33-N-3 copy. The probe
did not contain restriction sites for BamH I or Hind III. The
hybridization signals from the two S. mansoni gDNA lanes
(Hind III or BamH I digested) were strong and dispersed,
with a band of ~2.6 kb in the Hind III digest. The smeared
pattern of hybridization indicated that a number of copies
of Sinbad were interspersed throughout the genome of S.
mansoni rather than being localized at a discrete locus. By
contrast, the probe did not hybridize to the gDNA of S.
japonicum. Additional blots with larger amounts (30 µg)

by hybridization and/or other analyses.

loid genome, based on four separate estimates comparing
the signal in each of the genomic DNA lanes to the signal
in each of the 33-N-3 BAC lanes (comparison of lane 1
with lane 4, comparison of lane 2 with lane 5, comparison
of lane 1 with lane 5, and comparison of lane 2 with lane
4). (These estimates assumed that BAC 33-N-3 included
only one copy of Sinbad.)
Copy number was estimated by two additional methods.
First, upon screening the 23,808 clones of the BAC library
of Le Paslier et al. [31] that represents a ~8-fold coverage
of the haploid S. mansoni genome, approximately 0.7% to
1.0% of the clones were positive, indicating a copy
number for Sinbad of ~20 to 30 copies (not shown). Second, the bioinformatics approach of Copeland et al. [20]
was used to compare these estimates with reference copy
number estimates of other mobile genetic elements and
genes reported previously. BLASTn searches were undertaken using the nucleotide sequences of these reference
genes and the complete sequence of Sinbad (Table 1).
Because the construction of the BAC library involved partial digestion of the genomic DNA with Hind III [31],
genes without Hind III sites will be underrepresented in
the BAC end sequences. Accordingly, since sequenced
BAC ends from this library constitute a large proportion of
the genomic S. mansoni sequences in the public domain,
we used only genes containing Hind III sites as reference
sequences. As shown in Table 1, the number of hits for
Sinbad, 38, was higher than the number of hits for the single-copy cathepsin D gene (0 hits) but lower than that for
the multiple-copy 28S ribosomal RNA gene (157 hits)
(~100 copies; Ref. [7]) and for three high copy number
retrotransposons Boudicca (100 hits, 1,000–10,000
reported copies), SR2 (102 hits, 1,000–10,000 copies),
and SR1 (104 hits, 200–2,000 reported copies). In overview, all three methods were in reasonably close agreement, and together they indicated that approximately 50
(range ~20–100) copies of Sinbad reside in the genome of

S. mansoni. Based on copy numbers estimated for other
schistosome retrotransposons (see [13]), we consider that
Sinbad is not a high copy number element.
Sinbad-like elements transcribed in developmental stages
of S. mansoni
BLASTn analyses were undertaken using the full length of
Sinbad as the query sequence and the GenBank EST database of non-human, non-mouse sequences. The database
includes more than 130,000 EST sequences from six
developmental stages of S. mansoni – egg, miracidium,
cercaria, germball (= sporocyst), schistosomulum, and
mixed sex adults [39,40]. Significant hits were found to
ESTs from all of these six developmental stages. Of these,
the hits with highest similarity to Sinbad, CD111741,
CD060185, CD163413, CD062550, CD156994, and
CD156946, exhibited contiguous ORFs spanning each
EST without frameshifts or stop mutations. Positive ESTs
spanning most or all of the LTR, gag, PR, RT, RH and/or IN
regions were located in most of these six developmental
stages, indicating that Sinbad-like elements are actively
transcribed in all or most developmental stages of S.
mansoni.
Discontinuous distribution of Sinbad-like elements
In order to examine the phylogenetic distribution of Sinbad-like retrotransposons, we examined numerous complete and partial genomes, including prokaryotes, plants,
fungi, animals, and lower eukaryotes [41]. The genomes
were searched using tBLASTn with the amino acid
sequence corresponding to the region of Sinbad spanning
from the Cys-His box to the conserved protease catalytic
domain (bp 1588–2236) [see Additional file 1] as the
query. To minimize the likelihood of spurious positives,
we lowered the E-value for significance from 10 to 0.001;
this corresponded to a bit score of 40 or above. Although
it is more stringent than that of the BLAST default, this cutoff point was employed because it is permissive enough to

BEL family at large. No significant hits were found in any
of the plant, fungal, or protist genomes examined, or in
the 275 bacterial and 21 archaean genomes searched. All
of the nematodes examined were positive. Of the insects,
the other branch of the Ecdysozoa, Drosophila melanogaster
and Anopheles gambiae contained Sinbad-like elements,
whereas Drosophila pseudoobscura and Apis mellifera did
not. Of the vertebrates, Danio rerio and Takifugu rubripes
contained Sinbad-like sequences, whereas Homo sapiens,
Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris, Sus scrofa,
Gallus gallus, and Bos taurus did not. Interestingly,
although most higher chordates examined were free of
Sinbad-like elements, the tunicates Ciona intestinalis and
Ciona savigny, were positive for over 100 hits of sequences
highly similar to the Sinbad search sequence (up to an Evalue of 4e-22). In addition, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a non-chordate deuterostome, was positive for the Sinbad search sequence. These findings are
summarized in a tree-of-life style illustration, based on
the tree presented in Pennisi [42], and drawn in the style
of the taxonomic relationship diagrams used at NCBI
[43]. (This diagram is not a phylogram, and displays
broad relationships among major taxa only; although
relationships are in correct branching order, branch
lengths are not to scale.) Genomes with regions of
significant similarity to Sinbad are marked with a "+" symbol and those without are indicated with a "-" symbol.
The results of a search of dbEST corroborated and
expanded these findings, revealing nine non-Schistosoma
organisms with Sinbad -like sequences: C. intestinalis,
Molgula tectiformis (tunicate), S. purpuratus, D. melanogaster, Bombyx mori, Salmo salar, Xenopus laevis, and
Trichinella spiralis. E-values and accession numbers for the
top match for each organism are provided in Table 2.

Discussion
Sinbad – a novel Pao/BEL family LTR retrotransposon
from the genome of S. mansoni
Although several LTR retrotransposons have been characterized previously from the genome of S. mansoni, includ-

ing Boudicca, Saci-1, Saci-2, Saci-3 and the fugitive
[17,20,37], the Sinbad retrotransposon characterized here
is a novel retrotransposon and it is discrete from these
other elements. Sequence identity, structure, and phylogenetic relationships indicate that Sinbad is a member of the
Pao/BEL family of retrotransposons. The hallmark structures included a triple Cys-His box zinc finger domain in
the Gag polyprotein, protease with the active site tripeptide DSG, RT domain that included a YVDD active site
motif, RNAseH with DAS at the active site, and an integrase domain with a DD(49)E spacing of the active site
aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues. The YVDD motif
of RT, a version of the F/YXDD consensus motif of Gypsylike LTR retrotransposons, is shared by Pao and BEL.
Bowen and McDonald [32] reported that the Cer7-Cer12
series of elements from C. elegans displayed YVDN at this
site. Whether the Asn could replace Asp as the carboxy-residue of this conserved tetrapeptide with retention of
enzyme activity remains to be determined by biochemical
analysis, although mutation of either aspartate in YXDD
of retroviral RT (HIV-1 or Moloney murine leukemia
virus) inactivates the polymerase [see [44]].
The LTRs of Sinbad in BAC 33-N-3 are identical in
sequence, and appeared to contain a putative promoter
for initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.
Along with conservation of most residues contributing to
the active sites of the retrotransposon enzyme domains,
these structural characteristics suggested that Sinbad is
active or had been transpositionally active in the recent
past. Several other features also indicated that Sinbad is
transpositionally active. Numerous transcripts spanning
enzymatic domains and LTRs of Sinbad, from at least six
developmental stages of S. mansoni, have been sequenced
[40], and of these, the ESTs most closely resembling Sinbad are composed entirely of contiguous open reading
frames, suggesting non-mutated copies. On the other
hand, potentially inactivating mutations, including stop
codons and frameshifts, suggested that the BAC 33-N-3
copy of Sinbad was incapable of autonomous retrotransposition. If active copies are present, functional proteins

Page 11 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:20

coded by these copies could have been used in the recent
past to mobilize the 33-N-3 Sinbad copy in trans, as
recorded for other retrotransposons [45-47], explaining
the presence of identical LTRs. Indeed, Frame et al. [28]
noted that mutated copies framed by similar LTRs are
common in BEL like elements in C. elegans, implying
recent transposition.
The LTRs of Sinbad, at 386 bp in length, were substantially
shorter than those of Saci-1, ~840 bp [37], but longer than
those of Gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons from schistosomes, the fugitive, Gulliver and Boudicca. Whereas Sinbad
and Saci-1 are clearly closely related, dissimilar LTRs and
the low amino acid identity of the most highly conserved
domains (35 to 52%) confirmed they are distinct retrotransposons. Sinbad can be added to the catalog of mobile
genetic elements characterized from the schistosome
genome, where retrotransposons appear to have proliferated and flourished and contributed significantly to its relatively large size (270 MB; ~14,000 protein-encoding
genes) [13,20,40]. The colonization of the genome of S.
mansoni by Sinbad and Saci-1 and that of S. japonicum by
the related Tiao element [48] represents the first demonstration of infection of a Lophotrochozoan taxon by Pao/
BEL family LTR retrotransposons. The presence of Sinbad,
Saci-1, and Tiao in two species of Schistosoma suggests that
an ancestral schistosome was already host to the ancestors
of these elements. (Though Tiao is a Pao/BEL family retrotransposon, and is therefore predicted to be detected in
low-stringency BLAST searches, as in Figure 7, the absence
of a positive signal on the genomic Southern hybridization suggests that it is not particularly closely related to
Sinbad.)
A Sinbad/Saci-1 subfamily of Pao-BEL like LTR
retrotransposons
Whereas the sequence and deduced structure of the three
signature Pao-like elements, Pao from the silk moth B.
mori, Tas from the human roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides
and BEL from D. melanogaster have been known for about
a decade, the Pao/BEL family is not as well understood or
apparently as widespread as the other two major families
of LTR retrotransposons, the Copia/Ty1 and the Gypsy/Ty3
families. However, at least three branches of the Pao/BEL
family have become apparent – branches represented by
Pao, BEL, and Suzu (from T. rubripes) [27,28,32,49-51].
Using the new sequence information from Sinbad, and
some related elements, we have been able to investigate
the intra-family relations of the Pao/BEL elements more
thoroughly. Our findings, based on phylogeny of RT, and
supplemented by phylogeny of IN, indicated the presence
of at least five sub-families of Pao/BEL elements. The
majority of the sub-families may have a restricted host
range; the Tas subfamily occurred only in nematodes
(these elements may be endogenous retroviruses because

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/20

they appear to include env genes), the BEL subfamily only
in insects, the Pao subfamily only in insects, and the Suzu
subfamily only in fishes. By contrast, the Sinbad/Saci-1
subfamily is known from schistosomes and zebrafish.
Phylogenetic range of Sinbad-like retrotransposons
The Pao/BEL retrotransposons are known only from animals, a less extensive distribution than those of the Copia/
Ty1 or Gypsy/Ty3 groups that include elements known
from fungi and/or plants as well as animals. The ostensible absence of these elements from prokaryotes, lower
eukaryotes, fungi and plants suggests that ancestral Paolike elements appeared after the differentiation of the Animalia. Though the number of sequenced entire genomes
of animals is small, the distribution of Pao/BEL LTR retrotransposons within these few genomes displays a topography that we would not expect to be the result solely of
vertical transmission alone (Fig. 7). Sinbad-like sequences
were found in D. melanogaster, but not in D. pseudoobscura,
nor in A. mellifera, even though close relatives are found
in other insects such as B. mori and A. gambiae, and even
in species as phylogenetically distant as D. rerio (a fish)
and S. mansoni (a platyhelminth). Further, the distribution among chordates is enigmatic. Of the vertebrate
whole genomes searched, only two, T. rubripes and D.
rerio, were positive for Sinbad like elements. The human,
mouse, rat, cow, chicken, pig and dog genomes were
devoid of Sinbad-like matches. Since the genomes of lower
chordates and a non-chordate deuterostome were positive
for Sinbad-like sequences, progressive radiation would be
expected to give rise to similar sequences in these
vertebrates.

Feschotte [19] reported a similarly patchy distribution for
the Merlin DNA transposons; Merlin like elements are
abundant, for example, in anopheline mosquitoes but are
absent from D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and A. mellifera. Also, they are present in some vertebrate genomes
but not others. Merlin-like elements are also present in
schistosome chromosomes. This type of distribution suggests that either the vertical lineage of the elements has
been curtailed by the extinction of these elements from
several genomes, or that horizontal transmission has
taken place. Genomes need to restrain the uncontrolled
proliferation of mobile genetic elements, especially retrotransposons, and indeed some eliminate mobile
sequences more efficiently than others [5,52]. Goodwin
and Poulter [53] have shown that Ngaro elements have
been lost from certain genomes, as evidenced by the
presence of small, corrupt fragments serving as fossil
sequences. Similarly, especially in view of the low number
of Sinbad copies, Pao-like elements may have followed a
course of progressive radiation followed by elimination
from the Sinbad-negative genomes. However, if this were
the case with Pao-like elements, relic sequences could be

expected in at least some of the Sinbad-negative genomes.
Their absence from mammalian and avian genomes
favors the alternative explanation, that the current range
reflects horizontal transmission.
What might have been the origin of the Pao/BEL radiation
within the Animalia? Felder et al. [34] suggested that a
common ancestor of Tas and Pao may have undergone a
horizontal transmission event between the Insecta and
Nematoda, followed by the eventual differentiation of
these elements, including the gain or loss of env. Of the
sub-families of Pao/BEL elements apparent in the RTbased phylogram (Figure 5), the Tas subfamily includes
retrotransposons with an envelope encoding gene (specifically Tas from A. lumbricoides and Cer7 from C. elegans).
The acquisition of an envelope protein by an ancestral Tas
or Tas-like element would have enabled its extracellular
existence and facilitated its horizontal transmission and
infection of other hosts [38].
Interestingly, the deuterostomes bearing Sinbad-like
sequences included a sea urchin, tunicates, pufferfish,
zebrafish, the Atlantic salmon, and the African clawed
frog X. laevis (Figure 7). These are aquatic species and,
moreover, all are known from coastal or brackish waters
at the interface of freshwater and marine systems. The secondary hosts of S. mansoni, snails of the pulmonate genus
Biomphalaria, are also aquatic, as are the larval (miracidium and cercaria) stages of S. mansoni which enter and exit
the snail. It will be of interest to determine whether or not
Pao-like elements are present in this snail host, from
which numerous RT-encoding sequences already have
been reported [54]. Also of potential relevance is that the
genomes of both X. laevis and S. mansoni contain Pao-like
elements and that X. laevis is the secondary host of the
trematode parasite Tylodelphys xenopi [55], a fluke closely
related to the human schistosomes. Both T. xenopi and
another human schistosome, Schistosoma haematobium,
use snails of the genus Bulinus as intermediate hosts. An
aquatic lifestyle is an obvious relationship that links all of
the deuterostome hosts of Sinbad-like elements. This
aquatic, in comparison to a terrestrial, existence may have
facilitated transmission of infectious particles of the Taslike ancestors of Pao, Tas, BEL, Suzu, Sinbad, and relatives.
Alternatively, schistosomes may have acquired a Tas- element directly from Ascaris lumbricoides, an exceedingly
common human parasite and the host of Tas. A. lumbricoides occurs in the intestines of infected people, as do
schistosome eggs, so direct transmission of a mobile
genetic element from roundworm to schistosome could
have been facilitated by their physical proximity within
the human intestines.

Conclusion
A Pao/BEL like LTR retrotransposon named Sinbad is interspersed within the genome of the blood fluke, S. mansoni.
About 50 copies of this element appear to reside in the S.
mansoni genome. Analyses of the phylogenetic distribution of Pao/BEL-like retrotransposons indicated that Pao/
BEL-like elements are present only within phyla of the
Animalia, and not in prokaryotes, fungi or plants. Further,
the analyses indicated that there are at least five discrete
sub-families of the Pao/BEL clade of LTR retrotransposons, and that the distribution of these retrotransposons among the Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa and
deuterosomes has been influenced by horizontal as well
as vertical transmission.

Methods
Screening the bacterial artificial chromosome library
Le Paslier et al. [31] described the construction and characterization of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
library of the Schistosoma mansoni genome. The library,
constructed in the plasmid vector pBeloBac11 with
genomic DNA (gDNA) from cercariae of a Puerto Rican
strain of S. mansoni partially digested with Hind III, consists of 23,808 clones, about 21,000 of which are estimated to contain inserts ranging from 120 to 170 kb,
providing ~8-fold coverage of the schistosome genome.
Numerous BAC end sequences determined from randomly selected clones from this library are in the public
domain. Inspection of the end sequence of BAC clone
number 30-H-16 indicated identity with Pao-like LTR retrotransposons (not shown). Because the retrotransposon
sequence was located at the end of the BAC, the clone was
unlikely to contain the entire Pao-like element. Given that
retrotransposons can be expected to be present in multiple copies in the host genome, we screened the library
with a probe based on the end of BAC 30-H-16 in order to
locate an entire copy of the retrotransposon. The gene
probe was obtained by PCR amplification of a fragment of
BAC 30-H-16 using the primers 5'-CGCGGATCCAAGAGAAAAACCTTGATAGAC and 5'-CCGGAATTCCTGTCGAAGATAAAAGAGC, was cloned into pBluescript and its
identity confirmed by sequencing (Accession AY871176).
This probe spanned residues 2457 to 2823 of the BAC 33N-3 copy of the new retrotransposon (see below). The
cloned insert was labeled with digoxygenin (DIG) and
employed to screen the BAC library, as described [20],
represented as high-density clone arrays on nylon membranes. Positive clones were cultured as described [31]
and the presence of sequences with identity to the novel
retrotransposon in the positive clones was confirmed by
PCR (primers as above) or by colony hybridizations [56]
to the DIG labeled probe. One positive clone, BAC 33-N3, was investigated further by sequence analysis. BAC plasmid DNA was isolated from bacterial cultures using the
PhasePrep BAC DNA purification system (Sigma). Analy-

sis of the insert of 33-N-3 was accomplished after subcloning BamH1 fragments of the BAC into pNEB 193 (New
England Biolabs, MA), sequencing the inserts of the subclones, and also by direct sequencing of BAC 33-N-3.
Automated nucleotide sequencing, using ABI BigDye Terminator chemistry (ABI, Foster City, CA) and an ABI
Prism 3100 sequencer, was undertaken using primers specific for the probe and subsequently with gene specific
primers at Tulane University and at Davis Sequencing
(Davis, CA).
Sequence analysis and alignments
Contigs of the sequences were assembled using SeqMan
(DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Repeat sequences were
identified with a Pustell style dot matrix [57] using the
DotPlot3 program (Ramin Nakisa, Imperial College, London, UK) [see [58]] and the Pustell DNA Matrix function
in MacVector (Accelrys). Amino acid alignments were
accomplished with MacVector and ClustalW [59] using
sequences from GenBank or using conceptual translations
of nucleic acid sequences. Open reading frames were
located and conceptually translated using MacVector.
Sequences of the following retrotransposons were used in
the multiple sequence alignments based on gag, protease,
and reverse transcriptase: Ninja, T31674; Pao, S33901;
MAX, CAD32253; Roo, AAN87269; BEL, AAB03640; and
Saci-1, BK004068. Sequences of the following retrotransposons were used in the multiple sequence alignment
based on Integrase: Saci-1, DAA04498;Pao, S33901; Ninja,
T31674; Roo, AAN87269; Suzu, AF537216, BEL,
AAB03640, Tas, Z29712, and MAX, CAD32253.
Parasite DNAs, Southern hybridization, densitometric
estimation of copy number
Genomic DNAs of cercariae of a Puerto Rican strain of S.
mansoni and of adults of a Chinese (Anhui Province)
strain of S. japonicum were extracted using the AquaPure
Genomic DNA Purification system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). S. mansoni gDNA (30 µg/lane) and 33-N-3 BAC DNA
(800 ng) were digested with Hind III and BamH I restriction enzymes, and S. japonicum gDNA (20 µg/lane) was
digested with Hind III. Digested gDNA and BAC DNA
were size fractionated by electrophoresis through a 0.8%
agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe
GT, Bio-Rad) by capillary action [60], and UV-light crosslinked to the membrane. Southern hybridization analysis
to the DIG-labeled probe (above) was performed as
described [20]. Chemiluminescent signals were detected
using X-ray film (Fuji). Densitometric analysis of Southern hybridization signals was accomplished using the
Versa-Doc gel documentation system (Bio-Rad) and
Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad). Densitometry values
for signals evident in the gDNA and BAC DNA lanes were
used to estimate the copy number for the new retrotransposon, Sinbad, according to the formula [(A/B) × C]/E = F.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/20

This formula was derived from two equations: (A/B) × C
= D and D/E = F, where A was the number of copies of Sinbad in the BAC 33-N-3 lane, B was the density volume of
the 33-N-3 lane in units of optical density per mm2, C was
the density volume of the S. mansoni genomic DNA lanes
in units of optical density per mm2, D was the total
number of copies of Sinbad per genomic DNA lane, E is
the number of haploid genomes in the gDNA lane, and F
represented the copy number of Sinbad per haploid S.
mansoni genome. The insert of 33-N-3 was estimated to be
145 kb in length and assumed to contain only a single
copy of the retrotransposon.
Other copy number estimations
In addition to the densitometry-based estimate, estimates
of the copy number of the Sinbad retrotransposon also
were obtained by a comparative bioinformatics approach
[20] wherein BLAST analysis of the bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) -end database of S. mansoni genomic
sequences targeted more well-characterized retrotransposable elements from S. mansoni for which copy numbers
had been reported. These included the Boudicca LTR
retrotransposon [20] and the non-LTR retrotransposons
SR1 and SR2 [61,62]. The NCBI database was searched by
BLAST using the sequences of these mobile genetic elements and some other genes of S. mansoni, all of which
included at least one Hind III site. Specifically, the
Advanced BLAST function was used, set to search only the
S. mansoni sequences in the GSS database (Limit by Entrez
Query: <Schistosoma mansoni[organism]>), and with the
E value at 0.000001. The E value (Expect value) reflects the
probability of obtaining a match purely by chance. Scores
at or below this stringent cutoff E value of 10-6 were
counted as positive. This exceptionally stringent cutoff
value was used to minimize the chance of counting other
Pao-like elements in the total copy number of Sinbad.
Since the formula for E is based not only on the bit scores
of the local alignment of each pair of sequences, but also
on the lengths of the subject and query [see [63]], no additional correction was made for the length of the query
sequence.
Phylogenetic analysis of Pao-like elements
Sequences for phylogenetic analysis comparing the RT
region of several different retrotransposons were prepared
by trimming sequences from the large single polyprotein
of each retrotransposon to just the conserved domains of
RT (see [21,27]). Pol sequences presented in Xiong et al.
[21] and Abe et al. [27] were trimmed exactly to the stretch
of sequence shown by these authors to represent the RT
domain. Other elements were aligned with these
sequences and likewise trimmed to obtain just the RT
domain. For some elements, nucleotide sequences were
analyzed for open reading frames and translated before
being trimmed to include just the 7 conserved blocks of

the RT domain. Alignments were accomplished using
Clustal X [64], after which bootstrapped trees (1,000 repetitions) were prepared using the neighbor joining
method [65] and drawn with Njplot. The accession numbers for sequences included in the phylogenetic analysis
are as follows: Ty3, S53577; Tas: Z29712; Suzu, AF537216;
Sinbad, AY506538 (an N was inserted at position 2761 to
a resolve a frameshift and generate a single ORF) Saci-1,
DAA04498; Roo, AAN87269; Ninja, T31674; Moose,
AF060859; Max, CAD32253; Kamikaze, AB042120; HIV1, P04585; Gypsy, GNFFG1; Gulliver, AF243513; Copia,
OFFCP; BEL, AAB03640; Cer7, AAB63932, Cer8,
CAB04994, Cer9, CAB1647, and Cer11, AAA82437, two
uncharacterized Anopheles gambiae retrotransposons,
XP_309281 and XM_308737, an uncharacterized
Caenorhabditis briggsae retrotransposon, AC084491, and
two uncharacterized Danio rerio retrotransposons,
BX537152 and BX005079 [see Additional file 2]. Two
additional sequences were either not in the database or
were composites made to reconstruct sequences more
closely resembling non-mutated forms of the retrotransposons. The sequence representing Pao was a
reconstruction prepared by Abe et al. [27], from accession
numbers S33901, AB042118, and AB042119; the
sequence representing Boudicca was a composite of translated cDNA sequences introduced in Copeland et al. [22],
AY308018, AY308019, AY308021 and AY308022 [see
Additional file 2].
Screening entire or partial genomes for Sinbad
A panel of fully or partially sequenced entire genomes was
searched by BLAST for elements exhibiting sequence similarity to Sinbad. The deduced amino acid sequence encoding the region from the Cys-His Box through to the
protease domain (encoded by nucleotides 106 to 753 of
Sinbad [Y506538]) was employed as the query to search
each genome individually using tBLASTn. The genomes
searched in this way were as follows: Homo sapiens, Mus
musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Takifugu rubripes, Danio rerio,
Bos taurus, Gallus gallus, Sus scrofa, Canis familiaris, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Brugia malayi, Caenorhabditis elegans,
Caenorhabditis briggsae, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Ciona
intestinalis, Ciona savigny, Giardia lamblia, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium berghei, Cryptosporidium parvum, Eimeria tenella, Theileria annulata,
Toxoplasma gondii, Dictyostelium discoideum, Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma
cruzi, Arabidopsis thaliana, Avena sativa, Glycine max, Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, Zea mays, Lycopersicon
esculentum,
Schizosaccharomyces
pombe,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces castelli, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii,
Neurospora crassa, Magnaporthe grisea, Aspergillus nidulans,

Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Candida albicans,
Coccidioides posadasii, Gibberella zeae, Coprinopsis cinerea,
Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago maydis and Encephalitozoan cuniculi. In addition, 275 eubacterial and 21
Archaean genomes were searched [see Additional file 3].
Genomes with matches with E values less than 0.001 (corresponding approximately to bit scores greater than 40)
were considered positive for Sinbad-like elements.
GenBank accession numbers
Sequences of the Sinbad LTR retrotransposon have been
assigned accession numbers AY506537, AY506538,
AY645721, AAT66412, and AY871176. Other sequences
