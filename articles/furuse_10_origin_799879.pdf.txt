Origin of measles virus: divergence from
rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th
centuries
Yuki Furuse, Akira Suzuki, Hitoshi Oshitani*

Abstract
Measles, caused by measles virus (MeV), is a common infection in children. MeV is a member of the genus Morbillivirus and is most closely related to rinderpest virus (RPV), which is a pathogen of cattle. MeV is thought to have
evolved in an environment where cattle and humans lived in close proximity. Understanding the evolutionary history of MeV could answer questions related to divergence times of MeV and RPV.
We investigated divergence times using relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics. Our estimates reveal that MeV had
an evolutionary rate of 6.0 - 6.5 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year. It was concluded that the divergence time of the
most recent common ancestor of current MeV was the early 20th century. And, divergence between MeV and RPV
occurred around the 11th to 12th centuries. The result was unexpected because emergence of MeV was previously
considered to have occurred in the prehistoric age.
MeV may have originated from virus of non-human species and caused emerging infectious diseases around the
11th to 12th centuries. In such cases, investigating measles would give important information about the course of
emerging infectious diseases.
Findings
Measles is a common infection in children and is spread
by the respiratory route. It is characterized by a prodromal illness of fever, coryza, cough, and conjunctivitis followed by appearance of a generalized maculopapular
rash. Measles virus (MeV) infects approximately 30 million people annually, with a mortality of 197,000, mainly
in developing countries [1]. In the prevaccine era, more
than 90% of 15-year-old children had a history of
measles [2]. Measles remains a major cause of mortality
in children, particularly in areas with inadequate vaccination and medical care.
MeV infection can confer lifelong immunity [3,4], and
there is no animal reservoir or evidence of latent or
common persistent infection except for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Therefore, maintenance of
MeV in a population requires constant supply of susceptible individuals. If the population is too small to establish continuous transmission, the virus can be

eliminated [5]. Mathematical analyses have shown that a
naïve population of 250,000-500,000 is needed to maintain MeV [6-8]. This is approximately the population of
the earliest urban civilizations in ancient Middle Eastern
river valleys around 3000-2500 BCE [6,9,10]. Historically, the first scientific description of measles-like syndrome was provided by Abu Becr, known as Rhazes, in
the 9 th century. However, small pox was accurately
described by Galen in the 2nd second century whereas
measles was not. Epidemics identified as measles were
recorded in the 11th and 12th centuries [9-11].
MeV is a member of the genus Morbillivirus, which
belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae [12]. In addition
to MeV, Morbillivirus includes dolphin and porpoise
morbillivirus, canine distemper virus, phocid distemper
virus, peste des petits ruminants virus, and rinderpest
virus (RPV) [12,13]. Genetically and antigenetically,
MeV is most closely related to RPV, which is a pathogen of cattle [12,14]. MeV is assumed to have evolved in
an environment where cattle and humans lived in close
proximity [11]. MeV probably evolved after commencement of livestock farming in the early centers of

civilization in the Middle East. The speculation accords
with mathematical analyses as mentioned above [6,9,10].
Molecular clock analysis can estimate the age of ancestors in evolutionary history by phylogenetic patterns
[15,16]. The basic approach to estimating molecular dates
is to measure the genetic distance between species and use
a calibration rate (the number of genetic changes expected
per unit time) to convert the genetic distance to time.
Pomeroy et al. showed that “Time to the Most Recent
Common Ancestor” (TMRCA: the age of the sampled
genetic diversity) of the current MeV circulating worldwide is recent, i.e., within the last century (around 1943)
[17]. Nevertheless, the time when MeV was introduced to
human populations has not been investigated until date.
In the present study, we performed molecular clock analysis on MeV to determine the time of divergence from
RPV, suggesting the evolutionary path of the virus.
MeV sequences were downloaded from GenBank and
aligned using ClustalW. Additional file 1 includes a list of
accession numbers for sequences used in this study.
Sequences of the hemagglutinin (H) and nucleocapsid
(N) genes collected worldwide between 1954 and 2009
were used. The H and N genes were selected for analyses
since their sequences are registered commonly.
Sequences associated with the persistent disease manifestation SSPE were removed because these were expected
to exhibit different evolutionary dynamics [18]. To avoid
weighting specific outbreaks, we also excluded sequences
that had been collected at the same time and place and
that were genetically similar to each other. Consequently,
the final data sets comprised 149 taxa with an alignment
length of 1830 bp for the H gene and 66 taxa with an
alignment length of 1578 bp for the N gene.
To determine the divergence time between MeV and
RPV, sequences of peste des petits ruminants virus
[GenBank: FJ750560 and FJ750563] were used to define
the root of divergence between MeV and RPV.
The rates of nucleotide substitutions per site and
TMRCA were estimated using the Bayesian Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the
BEAST package [19,20]. This method analyzes the distribution of branch lengths among viruses isolated at
different times (year of collection) among millions of
sampled trees. For each data set, the best-fit model of
nucleotide substitution was determined using MODELTEST [21] in HyPhy [22]. All models were compared

using Akaike’s Information Criterion. For both the H
and N genes, the favored models were closely related to
the most general GTR + Gamma + Inv model. Statistical
uncertainty in parameter values across the sampled trees
was expressed as 95% highest probability density (HPD)
values. Runs were carried out with chain lengths of 100
million and the assumption of an ‘exponential population growth’ using a ‘relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal)
molecular clocks’ [23]. All other parameters were optimized during the burn-in period. The output from
BEAST was analyzed using the program TRACER
http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer. BEAST analysis was also
used to deduce the maximum a posteriori (MAP) tree
for each data set, in which tip times correspond to the
year of sampling.
The Bayesian approach assumed varied rates by branch.
Using the Bayesian estimate, our analysis derived a mean
evolutionary rate of 6.02 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year for
the N gene and 6.44 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year for the
H gene (Table 1). Based on this approach by analyses for
the N gene, 1921 was estimated to be the TMRCA of the
current MeV (Figure 1). Date of divergence between
MeV and RPV was 1171. Analyses for the H gene yielded
similar results; the TMRCA of the current MeV was
1916. 1074 was estimated to be the date of divergence
between MeV and RPV.
Our results indicate that divergence of MeV from RPV
occurred around the 11th to 12th centuries. The population size at that time was sufficient for maintaining
MeV. However, this result was unexpected because
emergence of MeV was previously considered to have
occurred in the prehistoric age [6,7,9,10]. Estimation
errors seem unlikely since Bayesian approach yielded
results which are compatible with other reports. In general, substitution rates between 10-3 and 10-4 substitutions/site/year have been previously estimated for RNA
viruses including MeV [17,24,25]. Pomeroy et al. also
found that the date of divergence of the current MeV
was within the last century [17].
In the prevaccine era, over 90 percent of children is
infected with MeV by age 15 [2]. Nevertheless, measles
has been rarely described earlier. An increasing number
of descriptions of measles in the 11th and 12th centuries
may reflect the emergence of MeV in human populations at that time [9-11]. Linguistic evidence suggests
that the disease was recognized before the Germanic

migrations but after the fragmentation of the Roman
Empire, i.e., between 5th and 7th centuries [10,11]. This
age is still within 95% credible intervals of our results.
Alternatively, a common ancestor of MeV and RPV may
have caused zoonosis in the past; the archaeovirus can
infect both humans and cattle. Even if the earliest urban
civilizations in ancient Middle Eastern river valleys
(around 3000 to 2500 BCE) were infected by an ancestor
of the current MeV, the virus probably had different
characteristics from the current MeV.
Emerging infectious diseases have recently caused significant morbidity and mortality. Many diseases are
caused by viruses originating in non-human species
[26]: HIV from non-human primates [27]; SARS coronavirus from bats [28]; and the pandemic strain of influenza virus in 2009 from swine [29]. MeV may have
originated from non-human species and caused emerging infectious diseases around the 11th to 12th centuries. In such cases, investigating measles would give

important information about the course of emerging
infectious diseases after their introduction into the
human population, from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives.
