highly divergent haemagglutinin region

Abstract
Background: In Mycoplasma synoviae, type strain WVU 1853, a single member of the haemaglutinin vlhA gene
family has been previously shown to be expressed. Variants of vlhA are expressed from the same unique vlhA
promoter by recruiting pseudogene sequences via site-specific recombination events, thus generating antigenic
variability. Using a bacterial stock of M. synoviae WVU 1853 that had been colony purified thrice and maintained in
our laboratory at low passage level, we previously identified a vlhA gene-related partial coding sequence, referred
to as MS2/28.1. The E. coli-expressed product of this partial coding sequence was found to be immunodominant,
suggesting that it might be expressed.
Results: Reverse transcription-PCR amplification (RT-PCR), using a sense primer located at the 5’-end region of the
expected vlhA transcript and a reverse primer located at the 3’ end of MS2/28.1 coding sequence, yielded a
consistent amplification product showing that MS2/28.1 was indeed transcribed. Nucleotide sequence analysis of
the RT-PCR product identified an 1815-nucleotide full-length open reading frame (ORF), immediately preceded by a
nucleotide sequence identical to that previously reported for expressed vlhA genes. PCR amplifications using
genomic DNA isolated from single colonies further confirmed that the full-length ORF of MS2/28.1 was located
downstream of the unique vlhA promoter sequence. The deduced 604-amino acid (aa) sequence showed a perfect
sequence identity to the previously reported vlhA expressed genes along the first 224 residues, then highly
diverged with only 37.6% aa identity. Despite the fact that this M. synoviae clone expressed a highly divergent and
considerably shorter C-terminal haemagglutinin product, it was found to be expressed at the surface of the
bacterium and was able to haemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes. Importantly, the E. coli-expressed C-terminal
highly divergent 60 residues of MS2/28.1 proved haemagglutination competent.
Conclusions: In contrast to the previously characterized vlhA expressedvariants, MS2/28.1 displayed a highly
divergent sequence, while still able to haemagglutinate erythrocytes. Overall, the data provide an indication as to
which extent the M. synoviae vlhA gene could vary its antigenic repertoire.

Background
Mycoplasma synoviae is an economically important
pathogen of poultry, causing synovitis, chronic respiratory tract disease, and retarded growth in chickens and
turkeys [1,2]. M. synoviae is a member of the genus
Mycoplasma of the class Mollicutes, a group of wall-less
Gram-positive bacteria with genomes ranging from 1358
kb to as little as 580 kb [3]. The genome sequence of

M. synoviae strain WVU 1853 has been determined and
comparative analysis with M. gallisepticum, another
major avian pathogen, provided evidence for horizontal
gene transfer between the two species, though belonging
to two distinct phylogenetic groups [4,5]. Among the
genes that could have arisen by horizontal gene transfer
are those encoding for haemagglutinins. In avian mycoplasmas, genes encoding for these immunogenic and
surface exposed proteins are the subject of considerable
antigenic variability [6]. By alternating the composition
of their surface proteins, mycoplasmas are thought to
colonize more efficiently mucosal surfaces and become

more virulent [7,8]. Haemagglutinins account among the
most important surface proteins involved in colonization
and virulence of avian mycoplasmas [6,9].
In M. synoviae, haemagglutinins are encoded by
related sequences of a multigene family referred to as
vlhA genes [10-12]. The haemagglutinins of M. gallisepticum (pMGA) and M. imitans are also encoded by
multigene families related to vlhA [13,14]. Both organization and control of expression of vlhA genes are quite
different between M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae. In
the former species, vlhA genes are located in five distinct genomic regions and each gene appears to be
translationally competent [14,15]. By contrast, in M.
synoviae, all vlhA sequences are confined to a restricted
genomic region with a unique copy being expressed in a
single strain [16,17]
The uniquely expressed vlhA gene of M. synoviae
yields a product that is cleaved post-translationally
into a N-terminal lipoprotein (MSPB) and a C-terminal
haemagglutinin protein (MSPA) [11]. Cleavage was
found to occur immediately after amino acid residue
344 [17]. Both MSPA and MSPB are surface-exposed
proteins and exhibit high frequency antigenic variation,
but only MSPA mediates binding to erythrocytes
[10,11]. Sequence analysis of several M. synoviae
strains suggested that MSPA was more antigenically
variable than MSPB [6,10,11]. Consistently, in isogenically derived M. synoviae clones that have lost their
haemadsorbing and/or haemagglutinating activity,
MSPA was no more detectable by polyclonal antisera
or monoclonal antibodies, suggesting extensive antigenic variation [12].
The molecular basis underlying the generation of antigenic variants of M. synoviae vlhA genes has been elegantly demonstrated in a study conducted by
Noormohammedi et al. 2000 [17]. It resides in the ability of a single strain to undergo high frequency site-specific recombination, owing to the availability in the
genome sequence of a significant pool of pseudogenes
(vlhA-related partial sequences). Recombination between
the single complete vlhA gene and one of the multiple
pseudogene copies ensures the creation of a new vlhA
gene variant. To date, three expressed vlhA gene variants (vlhA1, vlhA4, and vlhA5) have been characterized
in M. synoviae strain WVU 1853 [17]. These genes are
equally sized and show extensive sequence variability in
a 400-bp DNA segment in the middle of the vlhA
sequence, suggesting that the recombination event,
though introduced sequence variations, tended to preserve the overall sequence length and composition.
Although it has been concluded that the potential of
vlhA genes to vary is considerable, there is no indication
as to which extent a vlhA gene could diverge without
losing its properties.

Previous studies from our laboratory have identified in
M. synoviae strain WVU 1853, an immunodominant
vlhA variant (termed MS2/28.1) [18] whose haemagglutinin region displayed a dramatic sequence shift and was
considerably reduced in size, relative to the previously
characterized expressed vlhA genes (vlhA1, vlhA4, and
vlhA5) [17]. To better evaluate the extent of antigenic
variation that could be tolerated by the M. synoviae haemagglutinin, we sought to know whether this highly
divergent vlhA member was properly processed and
whether it remained functionally competent. Our results
provide evidence that the antigenic repertoire of M.
synoviae vlhA genes might be wider than previously
perceived.

Results
Isolation of the MS2/28.1 fragment

The complete nucleotide sequence of MS2/28, the l
phage-derived DNA fragment (GenBank accession number MSU66315) harbouring the immuno-reactive MS2/
28.1 sequence, has been previously described [18]. It is
2657 bp long and contained two partial ORFs, referred
herein to as, MS2/28.1 (5’ end) and MS2/28.2 (3’ end)
(GenBank accession numbers ORF G2149016 and ORF
G2149017, respectively). MS2/28.1 lacked its N-terminal
sequence, whereas the C-terminal region of MS2/28.2
was incomplete. The two partial ORFs shared 71% and
61.27% identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino
acids sequences, respectively, and were separated by a
481-nucleotide non coding region (data not shown).
Amino acid sequence comparisons between the two partial ORFs and the expressed vlhA1 gene have been previously described [11]. MS2/28.1 displayed 54.1%
identity with vlhA1, along a 244-residue overlapping
region, while MS2/28.2 showed 58.4% identity through a
495-amino acid overlapping sequence, starting at residue
260 of the vlhA1 gene sequence. Thus, the two partial
open reading frames MS2/28.1 and MS2/28.2 are members of the vlhA gene family.
Evidence that MS2/28.1 was transcribed through the
unique vlhA promoter

Immunoreactivity of the l phage MS2/28 clone was
associated with the 5’ end of the MS2/28.1 partial ORF.
With regard to the vlhA1 sequence, the MS2/28.1
expressed region corresponded to the MSPA (haemagglutinin) sequence extending from residues 346 to 446,
located immediately after the cleavage site.
Given the strong immuno-reactivity of the MS2/28.1
encoded product, we hypothesised that it might be
expressed in the bacterium as a vlhA variant. Indeed, it
has been well established that in M. synoviae, strain
WVU 1853, there exist only a single copy of the vlhA
promoter. New variant sequences, recruited from a pool
of vlhA pseudogenes, are placed under the control of

Béjaoui Khiari et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/6

this unique promoter via site-specific recombination
[17]. Hence, we performed RT-PCR using a sense primer targeting the 5’-end of the expected vlhA promoterderived transcript coupled to a reverse primer located at
the 3’ end of MS2/28.1 partial coding sequence. As
shown in Figure 1, RT-PCR reaction yielded a DNA
fragment around 1.934 kb that could not be amplified
when PCR was attempted without RT reaction. This
result provides evidence that MS2/28.1 was transcribed
as a vlhA variant.
Analysis of MS2/28.1 cDNA sequence

To further confirm the authenticity of the RT-PCR product and to complete the full-length coding sequence of
the MS2/28.1, we subjected the RT-PCR product to
nucleotide sequence analysis. As expected, the 5’-end
region preceding the ATG initiation codon was identical
to that reported for the previously reported vlhA
expressed genes [17]. The MS2/28.1 full-length ORF
consisted of 1815 nucleotides (GenBank accession number FJ890931). The deduced 604-amino acid sequence is
predicted to encode a protein with an expected molecular mass of 64.3 kDa. Sequence alignments with vlhA1
(GenBank accession no. AF035624), as well as with the
two full-length pseudogenes vlhA2 and vlhA3 (GenBank
accession nos. AF085697 and AF085698, respectively)

Page 3 of 9

[17] (Figure 2), showed a perfect identity along the 670
5’-end first nucleotides, corresponding to the N-terminal
first 223 amino acids. Downstream from this region, a
very high divergence was observed with 37,6%, 37,8%,
and 38,7% aa identity, respectively. Likewise, in this
region, MS2/28.1 shared only 39,8% and 38,8% identity,
respectively, with the two vlhA1 expressed variants,
vlhA4 and vlhA5, previously identified in M. synoviae
strain WVU 1853 (Figure 2). Overall, the haemagglutinin region of MS2/28.1 was found to be considerably
reduced in size (148 aa less than in vlhA1) and displayed
high level of sequence divergence in comparison to the
previously reported vlhA expressed genes, namely vlhA1,
vlhA4 (GenBank accession no. AF181033), and vlhA5
(GenBank accession no. AF181034) [17].
Demonstration that MS2/28.1 sequence is preceded by
the vlhA1 promoter

To confirm that in our bacterial stock MS2/28.1 was
located downstream of the unique vlhA promoter
sequence, we performed PCR amplifications on single
colonies using oligonucleotide primers placed in the
vlhA promoter sequence with either vlhA1- or MS2/
28.1-specific reverse primers. As shown in Figure 3,
amplicons migrating at the expected mobility were
obtained solely with MS2/28.1-specific reverse primers.
Sequence analysis further confirmed that the upstream
sequence is identical to that of the vlhA1 promoter, a
result consistent with the finding that MS2/28.1 is transcriptionally active and that, in its transcript, the region
preceding its ATG initiation codon was identical to that
reported for vlhA1.

exposed at the bacterium’s surface

control, PCR was directly performed on RNA without RT (lane 1).

To characterize MS2/28.1 encoded product and to
examine whether it was processed similarly as the vlhA1
product, we generated antisera towards four bacterially
expressed distinct regions of the coding sequence. The
reactivity of these antisera is shown in Figure 4. The
antiserum raised against the N-terminal 323 residues
(region A), which represent the vlhA1 MSPB protein,
recognized three main protein bands (Figure 4, lane 1):
a diffuse 25 to 30 kDa band similar to the previously
described MSPC3 [10], a second diffuse band migrating
at the range of 45 to 49 kDa, typical to the previously
described MSPB2 and MSPB3 proteins, and a third less
intense, high molecular mass protein of 97 kDa, consistent with the uncleaved vlhA1 gene product. All these
protein bands were revealed by the rabbit polyclonal
anti-M. synoviae serum (Figure 4, lane 5. The monospecific antiserum raised against the 19-amino acid peptide
(region B) located immediately upstream of the putative
cleavage site reacted essentially with a non diffuse single
band of 45 kDa (Figure 4, lane 2), identical to the vlhA1

MSPB protein. Thus, MS2/28.1 product was properly
cleaved. This was expected because, although MS2/28.1
diverged significantly from vlhA1, the sequence environment of the putative cleavage site was conserved along a
17-amino acid stretch (residues 339 to 355, relative to
the vlhA1 sequence). The monospecific antiserum to the
highly reactive domain, located immediately downstream
to the cleavage site (region C), reacted with only a

doublet of 45 and 50 kDa (Figure 4, lane 3), similar to
the two different sized bands previously described as
size variants of the vlhA1 MSPA protein [10]. Finally,
the antiserum directed against the C-terminal portion of
MS2/28.1 (region D) failed to recognize a distinguishable protein band (Figure 4, lane 4). By contrast, this
antiserum strongly reacted in filter colony immunoblotting assay (Figure 5C), suggesting that this C-terminal

The C-terminal highly divergent region of MS2/28.1
encoded product was haemagglutination competent

Mycoplasma synoviae strain WVU 1853 antigen prepared from a single colony culture with an equivalent
titer of 3 × 107 CFU/ml showed haemagglutination of
chicken red blood cells at a high dilution of 1:256, corresponding to a titer of 2 × 104 CFU/ml. In addition,
uniform hemadsorption of chicken erythrocytes to MS2/
28.1 expressing colonies was demonstrated (additional
file 1). Strikingly, the E. coli-expressed C-terminal 60
residues of MS2/28.1 showed an haemagglutination
activity. Consistently, the antiserum raised against this
C-terminal highly diverged region inhibited (at a 1/00
dilution) chicken erythrocytes haemagglutination. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the haemagglutinating activity of the vlhA variant MS2/28.1 maps to its
surface-exposed and highly divergent C-terminal 60
residues.

Discussion
The molecular basis underlying the antigenic variability
of M. synoviae vlhA protein, the abundant immunodominant surface haemagglutinin, has been attributed to sitespecific recombination, where recruited vlhA pseudogene

sequence [17]. Such a gene replacement mechanism, also
known as gene conversion, allows a single strain of M.
synoviae to generate a large number of variants by
recruiting new sequences from a large pseudogene reservoir. This pseudogene reservoir was found to be confined
to a restricted region of the genome [4,16], providing an
optimal environment for site-specific recombination. The
finding that MS2/28.1 gene sequence occurs in tandem
with another vlhA related gene (MS2/28.2), suggests that
it is part of this pseudogene reservoir.
Overall, the data point to the selection and clonal
expansion of a WVU 1853 bacterial cell expressing a
variant vlhA gene with an exceptionally highly divergent
haemagglutinin region, comparatively to the expressed
vlhA variant sequences described to date [17]. Indeed,
all tested colonies contained an MS2/28.1 sequence
located immediately downstream of the unique vlhA1
promoter. Comparative sequence analyses with the previously full-length vlhA genes, suggest that gene replacement could have occurred from aa residue 224 to the
carboxy terminus. This finding adds a new 5’ recombination site to the previously identified three sites (codon
for residues 136, 356, and 442) [17], thus increasing the
potential to generate antigenic variability.
Selection of clones expressing other vlhA1-related
genes from a culture of M. synoviae WVU 1853, led to
the identification of two variant clones, referred to as
vlhA4 and vlhA5 [17]. These expressed variants showed
a predicted protein length close to that of vlhA1 and
diverged in their amino acid sequence by only 15% and
25%, respectively, from residue 211 to the carboxy terminus. This limited sequence variability most likely
allows maintaining proper vlhA processing, subcellular
location, and haemagglutination activity, while providing
sufficient antigenic variability. By contrast, the coding
sequence of the full-length MS2/28.1 ORF is considerably shorter than vlhA1, from which it diverged by 64%.
The results showed that this highly variant sequence
was properly processed, with its C-terminal highly divergent region exposed at the cell surface. In addition, the
M. synoviae clone expressing MS2/28.1 efficiently haemagglutinated chicken erythrocytes, a property that was
mapped to the surface-exposed and highly divergent Cterminal 60 residues of MS2/28.1. As far as could be
ascertained, this is the first report mapping the heamagglutinating activity of a M. synoviae vlhA gene. The
finding that the antiserum raised against this C-terminal
region inhibited the haemagglutinating activity of the
homologous M. synoviae culture, definitely confirmed
that the surface exposed C-terminal 60 residues of MS2/
28.1 is associated with haemagglutination. It remains to
be seen whether other regions of MS2/28.1 contribute
to haemagglutination.

Figure 5 Colony blot of M. synoviae probed with MS2/28.1 C-terminal region antiserum. Immunostaining of M. synoviae colonies with a
rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the MS2/28.1 C-terminal region (panel C). As negative and positive controls, the colony blots were
either reacted with a preinoculation serum (panel A), or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against whole M. synoviae WVU 1853 antigen (panel B),
respectively.

The results described above highlight the extent to
which vlhA genes could vary, in both the size and the
sequence composition, without compromising their haemagglutination activity. Hence, comparing the expressed
sequences from several naturally evolved haemagglutinin
variant clones may help identifying critical residues
involved in the haemagglutinating activity of vlhA.
These variations would enable the bacterium to expose
an antigenically highly divergent product to better
escape the immune system [6,17]. Such a plausible consequence is presently under investigation. However, we
anticipate that, during natural infection, in the face of
the immune pressure, such an antigenic shift may occur
frequently. It would thus be of interest to perform
sequence comparisons between naturally derived vlhA
gene sequences by focusing on their variable haemagglutinin portion. Finally, because site-specific recombination events within vlhA genes occur frequently through
in vitro culture passages, inter-laboratory variations in
M. synoviae stocks that had been colony purified are
likely to exist.

Conclusions
The present study provided an indication of the extent
to which the vlhA haemagglutin gene of M. synoviae
could vary without compromising the surface exposure
and the haemagglutinating activity of its encoded product. We thus anticipate that the antigenic repertoire of
M. synoviae vlhA gene could be much wider than previously thought.
Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions

Mycoplasma synoviae strain WVU 1853 was obtained
from the American Type Cell Culture collection (ATCC
25204 ) and grown in Frey’s medium [19] supplemented
with 15% (v/v) foetal calf serum. The strain was initially
passaged in vitro at least 7 times before being subjected

to three colony purification steps. A single colony was
selected and grown. All mycoplasma cultures were then
prepared from this primary stock and never exceeded
two additional passages. Culture conditions and antigen
preparation were performed as described elsewhere
[20,21]. The mycoplasma antigens were stored at -20°C
until they were needed either for Western blot, RNA or
DNA extraction protocols. The growth of E. coli strains
was carried out in LB or 2YT broths [22]. Ampicillin
was added to the media at the concentration of 100 μg/
ml and IsopropylB-D-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) was
included for induction of protein expression at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer (GE
Haelthcare) when the screening was performed in
pGEX-4T-1 plasmid transformed into E. coli BL21.
Growth temperature were 37°C, except where indicated
and growth rates were estimated by measuring the
increase in OD600.
Origin of the immunoreactive MS2/28 DNA fragment

Isolation and characterization of the M. synoviae DNA
fragment MS2/28 [GenBank: MSU66315] was previously
described [18]. MS2/28 contains two partial ORFs,
referred to as MS2/28.1 (5’ end) and MS2/28.2 (3’ end).
Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)

The total RNA of M. synoviae strain WVU 1853 was
isolated from a 24-h culture, using a protocol recommended for Gram-positive bacteria [23]. Genomic M.
synoviae DNA was eliminated from the RNA preparation using DNAse I (2,5 mg/ml) digestion for a 1-h period at 37°C. DNAse I-treated total RNA of M. synoviae
was prepared as described above. Reverse transcription
was performed at 55°C in a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 2 μg of total RNA, 4 μl of dNTP at 20 mM
each, 12.5 μM of the reverse primer 2/28.1Rev (5’GGGCGGCCGCCTACACTTGCAGTACTTGGCG-3’),
20 units of AMV reverse transcriptase and 2 μl of 10 ×
buffer reaction (50 mM Tris-Cl, 8 mM MgCl2, 30 mM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/6

KCl, 1 mM dithiotreitol, pH = 8). The first strand
cDNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for 1 h followed
by inactivation at 65°C during 10 min. PCR amplification was next performed using 2/28.1Rev coupled to the
PromF primer (5’-GTCGACGAAATTAAGTAAATTATTAAAG-3’) which anneals to the 5’ end region
(-120 to -98) of the expected vlhA1-derived transcript.
The amplification reaction consisted of 30 cycles of 94°
C for 120 s, 55°C for 120 s and 72°C for 120 s, followed
by an extension of 72°C for 7 min.
Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR product

The 1.934 kb RT-PCR product was purified and ligated
into NotI/SalI-digested pBluescript II KS+ plasmid. The
ligation product was used to transform E. coli HB101
cells and recombinant clones were screened using
restriction analysis. Determination of the nucleotide
sequence was performed with the Prism Ready Reaction
Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing Kit on an ABI
PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The
cloned amplicon was sequenced in both orientations
from two different plasmid clones using sequence-specific internal and plasmid-anchored primers. The
sequence data were edited and aligned using the software programs BioEdit [24] and ClustalW [25].
Confirmation of the position of the completed MS2/28.1
gene sequence relative to the unique vlhA1 promoter

Using genomic DNA extracted from single colonies as
template, PCR amplifications were performed, combining EXpro (5’-CAAATTTAGTTAATTCACTTA-3’), a
sense primer placed in the vlhA1 promoter region (-213
to -193), with either vlhA1 R (5’-TATTGTTTTCGGCATTATTTGCTACGTC-3’), a vlhA1-specific reverse
primer,
or
ORF5.1R
(5’-GCCTCCACTTCCATCTCCGCTTTCACT-3’), the MS2/28.1-specific
reverse primer. To ensure that the full-length MS2/28.1
gene sequence was placed downstream of the vlhA1
promoter sequence, a second sense primer, EXproint
(5’-ATTAACTACGTTAATTTCTTGC-3’) located in
the vlhA1 promoter region (-172 to -151) was combined
with 2/28.1Rev reverse primer (5’-GGGCGGCCGCCTACACTTGCAGTACTTGGCG-3’), which anneals to the
3’-end sequence of MS2/28.1.
Escherichia coli expression of distinct regions of the MS2/
28.1 and purification of their products

The coding sequences corresponding to amino acids 1
to 324 (the N-terminal region, region A), 326-344
(region B, 19-amino acid stretch lying immediately
upstream of the putative cleavage site), 354-460 (region
C, the region immediately downstream of the cleavage
site), and 546-604 (the C-terminal 60 residues, region
D) of the full-length MS2/28.1-associated ORF (referred
to as MS2/28.1) were amplified by PCR using the three
primer pairs 2/28.1For (5’-GGGATCCATGAAAAATAAAAAAATTAAATT-3’)-TGA1R
(5’-

GCGGCCGCTTGAGCTGTTCATTGGAAT-3’),
TGA1F(5’-GGATCCATTCCAATGAACAGCTCAA-3’)TGA2R
(5’-GCGGCCGCAGCTTTGGCTCAAGCTCTA-3’), and TGA6F (5’-GGATTCATATACTTGAAAAAATCCA-3’)-2/28.1Rev
(5’GCGGCCGCCTACACTTGCAGTACTTGGCG-3’) and
cloned into BamHI/NotI-restricted pGEX-4T-1 expression vector, after being verified by nucleotide sequencing. The coding sequence of the region immediately
downstream of the cleavage site (354-460, region C) was
obtained from a plasmid containing the MS2/28.1 segment and subcloned in the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1.
The recombinant plasmids encoding regions A, B, C,
and D of MS2/28.1 were electroporated into competent
E. coli strain BL21, to produce the GST-MS2/28.1A,
GST-MS2/28.1B, GST-MS2/28.1C, and GST-MS2/28.1D
fusion proteins, respectively. Briefly, overnight cultures
of transformed bacteria were diluted 1:100 of 2YT medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 37°
C with shaking (250 rpm) to an A 600 of 0.6. Protein
expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mM
IPTG, and maintained for 4-h incubation at 30°C with
vigourous agitation (250 rpm). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm and resuspended in
1× PBS. The E. coli pellet was disrupted by sonication
and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) of 30
min. Both fusion proteins proved to be soluble and were
readily purified by affinity chromotography on Glutathione Sepharose 4B Beads (GE Haelthcare), using the
Bulk GST Purification Module, following the instructions of the manufacturer. The purified recombinant
proteins were analysed by electrophoresis on sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-12% polyacrylamide gels and
allowed to react, in western immunoblotting, with a rabbit polyclonal anti-M. synoviae serum.
Production of monospecific antisera to MS2/28.1 regions
A, B, C, and D

Polyclonal monospecific antisera to the purified fusion
proteins GST-MS2/28.1A, GST-MS2/28.1B, GST-MS2/
28.1C, and GST-MS2/28.1D were raised in female New
Zealand White rabbits. Pre-immune serum was collected
from each animal followed by intramuscular immunization on day 1 with 200 μg protein mixed with an equal
volume of Freund’s complete adjuvant. Subsequent
immunizations with 200 μg protein in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant were given at 2 week intervals. The produced antisera were then used to identify, in M.
synoviae, the proteins encoded by MS2/28.1.
A rabbit polyclonal anti-M. synoviae serum was generated as described above, using 200 μg of sonicated total
M. synoviae antigen.
The immunization of rabbits and collection of sera
were performed following the protocols approved by the
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research/Food and

Committee.
Identification and Characterization of MS2/28.1 encoded
proteins

M. synoviae total proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Rabbit antisera
directed either against the fusion proteins or the whole
M. synoviae antigen were then reacted with these membranes followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The
reactive protein bands were visualized using a substrate
solution consisting of 0.05% 4-chloro-1-naphtol (Sigma)
in PBS containing 20% (v/v) methanol.
Filter colony blotting

Fresh M. synoviae colonies growing on the surface of
agar plates were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane
discs (Bio-Rad). Discs were dried for 5 min at room
temperature, then, they were incubated in blocking buffer (1 × PBS/5% BSA (Sigma)) for an hour. The discs
were washed three times for 5 min in wash buffer (1 ×
PBS/0.1% BSA/0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad)) and then
incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (diluted in
wash buffer). After three briefly washes, nitrocellulose
discs were incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare)
diluted at 1:3,000 in wash buffer. Colony blots were
visualized, after washing steps, with substrate solution
containing 4-chloro-naphtol (Bio-Rad) as chromogen
and the reaction was stopped by washing blots in deionised water.
Haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition (HI)
tests

Purified M. synoviae colonies were grown as described
previously then harvested and adjusted to an equivalent
titer of 3 × 10 7 CFU/ml. The cells were centrifuged,
washed three times in PBS, and finally resuspended in
PBS to 1/50 of the original broth volume. In rows of a
U-bottomed microtiter plate duplicate serial twofold
dilutions of the mycoplasma cell suspension were made
in 50 μl of PBS in eight subsequent rows. To each of
these wells was added 25 μl of a 0.5% suspension of
chicken erythrocytes in PBS. After incubation at room
temperature for 2 hs, the plate was examined for
haemagglutination.
For HI assay, a 1/100 dilution of MS2/28.1 C-terminal
antiserum was added to the resuspended M. synoviae
colonies and incubated for 1 h, before adding
erythrocytes.
Colony hemadsorption assay

Distinct colonies of M. synoviae strain WVU 1853
derived from a single clone expressing MS2/28.1 (2.5 ×
107 CFU/ml), were observed on Frey’s agar after incubation for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . The colonies were

covered with 15 ml of 0.5% chicken erythrocytes in PBS
and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Agar plate was then
gently washed twice with PBS and examined at low
magnification under a microscope for erythrocyte adherence to mycoplasma colonies.
