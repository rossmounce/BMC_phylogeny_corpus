Abstract
Background: The poor peri-urban areas of developing countries with inadequate living conditions
and a high prevalence of HIV infection have been implicated in the increase of tuberculosis (TB).
Presence of different lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been described in different parts of
the world. This study determined the predominant strain lineages that cause TB in Rubaga division,
Kampala, Uganda, and the prevalence of resistance to key anti-tuberculosis drugs in this
community.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive patients
aged ≥ 18 years. A total of 344 isolates were genotyped by standard spoligotyping and the strains
were compared with those in the international spoligotype database (SpolDB4). HIV testing and
anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility assays for isoniazid and rifampicin were performed and
association with the most predominant spoligotypes determined.
Results: A total of 33 clusters were obtained from 57 spoligotype patterns. According to the
SpolDB4 database, 241 (70%) of the isolates were of the T2 family, while CAS1-Kili (3.5%), LAM9
(2.6%), CAS1-Delhi (2.6%) were the other significant spoligotypes. Furthermore, a major
spoligotype pattern of 17 (4.5%) strains characterized by lack of spacers 15–17 and 19–43 was not
identified in SpolDB4. A total of 92 (26.7%) of the patients were HIV sero-positive, 176 (51.2%)
sero-negative, while 76 (22.1%) of the patients did not consent to HIV testing. Resistance to
isoniazid was found in 8.1% of strains, while all 15 (4.4%) strains resistant to rifampicin were multidrug resistant. Additionally, there was no association between any strain types in the sample with
either drug resistance or HIV sero-status of the patients.
Conclusion: The TB epidemic in Kampala is localized, mainly caused by the T2 family of strains.
Strain types were neither associated with drug resistance nor HIV sero-status.

Background
Uganda is one of the countries with the highest burden of
tuberculosis (TB) in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated incidence of 559 cases per 100,000 per year and
ranks 16th among the 22 high-burden countries [1]. Kampala, the capital of Uganda, has an approximate population of 2 million (Nation Census, 2002) and accounts for
30% of the TB burden in the country (National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme, 2006). To date,
there are very limited data available pertaining strains circulating in Uganda and the East African region as a whole
[2-5]. Poor peri-urban areas of most developing countries
where living conditions are unsatisfactory are usually
affected by TB [6,7]. The presence of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has caused an increase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) infection [8] and rapid
progression of the infection [9], and is also known to
increase MTC transmission rates at the community level,
further threatening the health and survival of HIV seronegative individuals as well [10].
Spoligotyping, one of the genotyping techniques, is a simple, rapid and cost-effective method that has been used
widely to define predominant and a growing number of
important clades worldwide [2,3,11-13]. The World spoligotyping Database, SpolDB4.0, describes an update on
the global distribution of M. tuberculosis complex spoligotypes but shows little information about Uganda. A previous characterization of 234 MTC strains collected between
1995 and 1997 at the National Referral Hospital in Kampala grouped 67% of the isolates into two closely related
spoligotype families [4] but provided neither an estimate
of the burden of other strain lineages and associated HIV
sero-status data nor the anti-tuberculosis susceptibility
pattern of the isolates.
The present study has characterized isolates from a periurban patient population in Rubaga division, Kampala.
We have assigned 244 of the 344 strains to the major
clades in SpolDB4.0, and also investigated association
between the predominant spoligotypes and HIV sero-status as well as anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in this community.

Methods
Ethical considerations
Institutional permission to conduct the study was
obtained from the Faculty Research and Ethics Committee
of Makerere University Medical School (institutional ethics board of the Medical School). Informed consent to
participate in the study as well as permission to use isolates from samples provided were obtained from all
enrolled participants.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/101

Study setting
Patients were recruited from sputum smear positive residents in Rubaga attending four main TB clinics in the division. Sample processing, confirmatory microscopy and
culture and susceptibility testing were performed at the
National Tuberculosis and Reference Laboratory (NTRL);
molecular assays were run at Makerere Medical School,
and data analysis for spoligotyping was done at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, Stockholm.
Study design
This was a cross sectional study in which all consecutive
newly-presenting Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear-positive
patients between February and November 2006 aged 18
years and above were enrolled. The patient recruitment
and sample collection process was done as described in
our previous report [14]. Briefly, all patients underwent a
standardized interview and three consecutive sputum
samples (spot, early morning and spot) were taken from
each patient. Only the sample with the highest ZN smear
grade was further analyzed for each patient. Samples were
stored at 4°C at the recruitment clinics, in any case for not
more than 48 hours, until transported in a cold box to the
NTRL for processing, confirmatory fluorescent microscopy and culture.
Sputum sample processing
Specimens (2.5–10 ml) were processed by the standard Nacetyl L-cystein (NALC)-NaOH method [15] and concentrated at 4000 × g for 15 minutes. The sediment, irrespective of the original sample volume, was reconstituted to
2.5 ml with phosphate buffer pH 6.8, to make the inoculum for the smears and cultures.
Culture and identification
Two Lowenstein-Jensen slants, one containing 0.75%
glycerol and the other containing 0.6% pyruvate, were
inoculated with the sediment and incubated at 37°C. Cultures were considered negative when no colonies were
seen after 8 weeks incubation. Isolates were harvested,
DNA extracted using a standardized protocol [16] and
confirmed as MTC by an in-house PCR [17].
Drug resistance assays
Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed by the
indirect proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen media
at the following final drug concentrations: rifampicin, 40
μg/ml and isoniazid, 0.2 μg/ml, as recommended elsewhere [18]. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined in
accordance with standard criteria of resistance to at least
isoniazid and rifampicin.

Quality control for DST
For all test panels, drug susceptible strain (H37Rv) and
specific drug resistant strains (TMC 303 for isoniazid and
TMC 331 for rifampicin) internal controls were included.

The NTRL successfully participates in two annual external
proficiency testing programmes organized by Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Supra
national laboratory net work.
Spoligotyping
Standard spoligotyping [19] was done generally as
described by Kamerbeek and colleagues using a commercially available kit (Isogen Bioscience BV, Maarssen, The
Netherlands).
HIV testing
HIV-1 rapid testing was performed according to the Ministry of Health, Uganda, algorithm. Anticoagulated whole
blood was immediately used for HIV rapid testing at the
clinics of enrolment. Two rapid HIV tests, Unigold
Recombinant HIV (Trinity Biotech, Wicklow, Ireland) and
Determine HIV-1/2 (Abbott, Tokyo, Japan), were run
sequentially. Samples were tested first with Abbot Determine and reported only when negative. Positive samples
were confirmed with Unigold, while discordant results
were resolved by a third rapid test kit, HIV-1/2 Stat-Pak
(ChemBio, Medford, NY). All tests were performed and
interpreted according to the manufacturers' instructions.
Data analysis
Spoligotypes were analysed by a BioNumerics software,
version 5.0 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) as character types. The obtained signatures were compared in
binary format with the international spoligotyping database of the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe. The SpolDB4
database [20] (an online version is available on http://
www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr:8081/SITVITDemo) provides
information on the spoligotype international type (SIT)
distributions of M. tuberculosis spoligotypes worldwide.
Labels for major phylogenetic clades were assigned
according to signatures provided in SpolDB4. Statistical
associations between strain types, drug susceptibility data
and HIV sero-status were generated by Stata 8.0 using the
Pearson's chi-square test. Odds ratios were estimated at
95% confidence intervals, and a P value of < 0.05 was considered evidence of a significant difference.

Results
Study population and samples analyzed
Between February and November 2006, 2639 TB suspects
from Rubaga division, Kampala, were screened at 4 division TB clinics. The population of Rubaga division is
mainly low to middle income, and the clinics chosen are
the subsidized mission founded hospitals at which a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/101

majority of the residents seek medical care. Only 386 of
these suspects were sputum smear positive and enrolled.
Extra samples from randomly selected patients were taken
for internal quality control as generally described in our
previous report [14]. The demographic information of the
patients shows that 163 (47.4%) of the isolates were from
female patients while 181 (52.6%) were male. The sample
median age was 32 with a range of 18 to 62 years. The
median age among female subjects was 30 (SD 8.3) with
a range of 18 to 60 years while that of the males was 34
(SD 8.6) with a range of 18–62 years. Stratification
according to age showed that 267 (77.7%) of the patients
were between 18 and 39 years old while 75 (22%) were
between 40 and 60 years. Only 1 (0.3%) patient was over
60 years of age.
Spoligotypes
To determine the strain lineages present in the sample, the
344 isolates were spoligotyped and binary outcomes compared with those existing in SpolDB4 so as to assign spoligotype international type (SIT) designations. A total of
320 isolates, or 93% of our sample, were grouped into 33
clusters (2 to 49 isolates per cluster), while the remaining
24 (7%) of the strains did not cluster. Of these 24 strains
that did not cluster, 21 did not exist in the SpolDB4.0 data
base, hence represented the true orphans in the study
sample. The remaining 3 of the unclustered isolates
included one M. bovis strain and were all present in
SpolDB4 with labels SIT 34 (S), SIT 61 (LAM10-CAM),
and SIT 482 (BOV1) for the M. bovis strain.

Among the 33 clusters, seven included more than ten isolates each and were defined as major spoligotypes, while
minor spoligotypes, on the other hand, were defined as
spoligotype international types (SITs) that contained two
to ten isolates per cluster (Figure 1). Analysis of the frequency of the spoligotypes in our study with SpolDB4.0
allowed differentiation between ubiquitous types (SIT 1,
SIT 4, SIT 21, SIT 26, SIT 42, SIT 52, SIT 59, SIT 78, SIT
356, and SIT 288) and those believed to be endemic in
Uganda (SIT 125, SIT 128, SIT 135, and SIT 590). Furthermore, up to 14 clusters ranging from two to seventeen isolates per cluster formed a total of 100 strains and were not
yet defined in SpolDB4.0. These were labeled UGA1 (17
isolates) to UGA14 (2 isolates) (Figure 1). Seventy percent
(241/344) of the isolates lacked hybridization to either
spacer 40 or both 40 and 43, and these were characteristic
of strains that were previously classified as M. africanum
genotypes Uganda II and I respectively [21]. Most (227/
241) of the Uganda genotype strains formed 16 clusters
(ranging 5 to 49 isolates) with 80 strains being genotype I
while 147 were genotype II (Figure 1). Only 14 Uganda
genotype strains did not cluster.

Overall, 4 Beijing strains (SIT 1) were identified, making
1.2% of the sample. The six major shared spoligotypes in
our sample were SIT 128 or T2 with 49 isolates, SIT 135
(T2-Uganda) with 38 isolates, SIT 52 (T2) with 26 isolates, SIT 590 (T2) with 15 isolates, SIT 21 (CAS1-Kili)
with 12 isolates and SIT 125 (T2) with 11 isolates. Additionally, one other major cluster of 17 isolates with a characteristic lack of hybridization to spacers 15–17 and 19–
43 is not yet defined in SpolDB4.0 and was labeled UGA
1 (figure 1).
HIV sero-status
In the current sample, 92 patients (26.7%) were HIV seropositive, 176 (51.2%) sero-negative, while 76 (22.1%)
did not consent to HIV testing hence their status
unknown. There was no significant difference (P = 0.116)
in sero-status between female and male patients in the
sample. An analysis of the predominant spoligotypes in
HIV sero-positive and sero-negative patients showed that
53/92 (57.6%) of sero-positive individuals carried strains
of the T2 family, while only 6.5% carried the CAS strains,
3.3% LAM3/S, and 4.3% carried unique strains. Further-

more, 138/176 (78.4%) of the HIV sero-negative individuals and 50/76 (65.8%) of those who did not consent
carried the T2 family of strains. The other patients carried
either minor spoligotypes or those not yet defined in
SpolDB4.
Drug susceptibility patterns
Susceptibility testing results for the two key anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin) showed that resistance to isoniazid was 28/344 (8.1%), that to rifampicin
was 15/344 (4.4%), and all the rifampicin resistant isolates were also MDR, being defined as resistance to both
isoniazid and rifampicin. 13 strains, including 1 Beijing
genotype, were monoresistant to isoniazid. Five patients
were recruited with recurrent TB, but all the isolates were
susceptible. There was no relationship (p = 0.80) between
MDR and HIV sero-positivity. A summary of patient
demographic characteristics and associated drug susceptibility pattern is shown in Table 1.

Regarding cluster analysis in drug resistant isolates, SIT 52
(T2) had four of the 15 MDR isolates; SIT 128 (T2) three

MDR isolates, while SIT 135 (T2-Uganda) had two MDR
isolates. The other 6 MDR isolates were distributed as follows: one LAM9 (SIT 42), one UGA7 (T2), one UGA18
and three unique (T2) isolates. Although strains of the T2
family accounted for 13 of the fifteen MDR strains in the
sample, there was no statistical relationship (p = 0.25)
between this strain type and MDR. The relationship
between the different spoligotypes and resistance to
rifampicin, isoniazid or both is summarized in Table 2.

in order to study transmission patterns within communities and to understand the epidemiology of the disease in
the country as a whole. This report presents the largest
amount of molecular epidemiological data on M. tuberculosis isolates from Uganda to date. It is also the first systematic community based study conducted to assess strain
diversity, associated HIV sero-status and anti-tuberculosis
drug resistance of M. tuberculosis complex in a peri-urban
population of Uganda.

Discussion

Our findings on the predominance of the T2 family of
strains in Kampala compare well with previous data from
the study at Mulago hospital, Kampala, in which 67% of
the isolates were identified as lacking hybridization to
either spacer 40 or both 40 and 43 [4,21]. Else where in
East Africa, a previous study in Kenya found only eight
(11%) of 73 isolates to be of the T2 family and its variants,
while in northern Tanzania four (3%) of 130 strains were
T2-Uganda, frequencies much lower than 70% observed
in our sample [3]. It is therefore plausible that the TB epidemic in Kampala is local and well established, and that
this strain is well adapted to transmit in the local popula-

Characterization of prevailing M. tuberculosis lineages and
clones focusing on different geographical levels such as
continents, countries, regions or cities is important for
locating the origin, evolution and spreading dynamics of
a particular M. tuberculosis clone, which is often difficult to
be identified by traditional epidemiological investigations alone. Like most of sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda has
a high prevalence of TB infection with peri-urban communities of Kampala recording higher rates than those in the
rest of the country [22]. In this region where TB is
endemic, it is critical to identify predominant strain types

tion. Similar trends have been observed in other studies
where local genotypes tend to form a greater proportion
of the circulating strains. Cases in point are Guinea Bissau
where 199 (51%) of 229 isolates belonged to the Guinea
Bissau family [23]; Cameroon where 193 (46.7%) of 413
M. tuberculosis isolates belonged to the Cameroon family,
LAM10-CAM [24]; Harare, Zimbabwe where 68/214
(31.8%) isolates in one study and 116/246 (47.2%) in
another were LAM-ZWE variants [25,26] and in Zambia
where 74/114 (65%) isolates were also of the LAM-ZWE
family [26]. These are in further agreement with recent
findings where it was noted that different strains of M.
tuberculosis have adapted to specific human populations,
and that such local strains are more likely to transmit
compared to others [27,28].
Other significant spoligotypes in our study were CAS1-Kili
(3.5%), LAM9 (2.6%), CAS1-Delhi (2.6%), LAM3/S
(1.7%), CAS1 (1.7%), and LAM11-ZWE (1.5%). In comparison to other studies in the region, the CAS, LAM and
EAI families were reported at 37%, 22% and 17% respectively of a total of 147 isolates in a study in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania [2]; while in northern Tanzania, the most predominant families were CAS-Kili (30%), LAM11-ZWE
(14.6%), EAI (6.2%), Beijing (5.4%), and CAS1-Delhi, T1
and LAM9 at 3.8% [5]. In Kenya, on the other hand,
35.6% of 73 isolates were of the CAS family, while 11%
were LAM [3]. These studies show more success of the
CAS, LAM and EAI families in the neighboring East African countries, while in Central Uganda, the T2 family of
strains predominates.
A comparison of the prevalence of the Beijing family of
strains, highly prevalent in many Asian locations [13],
shows that in East Africa, Tanzania has reported 14 cases
[2,5], Kenya six [3], while in a recent study of mycobacteria causing human cervical lymphadenitis in pastoral
communities in the Karamoja region of Uganda, three isolates with the Beijing spoligotype were identified from 34
biopsies [29], but the susceptibility pattern and associated
HIV sero-status of the individuals is not known. In this
study, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first
four M. tuberculosis Beijing strains in Uganda with known
anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility pattern to date, with
none of the four strains being MDR. Our results further
show that the Beijing family at 1.2% is not common. This
result differs from that seen in a study in Kenya in which
two of the six Beijing strains in the collection were MDR
[3]. In Malawi, 44/1,029 (4.3%) of strains in one study
were Beijing and susceptible [30]; in the Dar es Salaam
study, the susceptibility pattern of the seven Beijing isolates was not determined [2], while more recently in
northern Tanzania, 5.4% of 130 isolates were Beijing and
all susceptible. Generally, the trend and susceptibility pattern of the Beijing genotype in sub-Saharan Africa has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/101

been described to be one of three: epidemic and associated with drug resistance (high level in South Africa); epidemic but drug sensitive (Malawi); and very low level or
absent (parts of Africa) [31]. Our data suggest that the Beijing strains in Kampala are of the low level and susceptibility pattern.
The emergence of drug resistance in the treatment of TB
has complicated its management. In the developing countries, lack of resources hinder regular drug resistance surveys, hence the magnitude of this problem remains largely
unknown. The last national anti-tuberculosis drug resistance survey in Uganda (1996–1997) on 586 patients [32]
indicated that primary resistance to isoniazid was 6.7%,
that to rifampicin 0.8%, while MDR was 0.5%. In neighboring Rwanda, the most recent survey results [33] show
that of 616 strains from new cases, 6.2% were resistant to
isoniazid, 3.9% to rifampicin and 3.9% were multidrugresistant TB. In northern Tanzania, a study of 111 isolates
showed that 9.9% were resistant to isoniazid, 2.7% to
rifampicin, with 2.7% being MDR [5]. Our result for
resistance to isoniazid at 8.1% is comparable to that in
northern Tanzania, while that to rifampicin (4.4%) is
comparable to the Rwanda findings.
Regarding cluster analysis, although the T2 family of
strains accounted for 13/15 MDR strains, there was no statistical evidence (p = 0.25) to suggest that it might be the
driving force of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in this
community. Additionally, as observed in northern Tanzania [5], our results show that HIV sero-status could not be
identified with a particular spoligopattern. Furthermore,
import of strains from Asia (CAS1-Kili, 3.5%; CAS1-Delhi,
2.6%; CAS1, 1.7%; and CAS2, 0.6%) has not had a major
impact on the M. tuberculosis population in Kampala.
However, together with the single M. bovis seen in our
sample, there is clearly a diverse set of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex strains circulating in Kampala,
although T2 strains are predominant.

Conclusion
This study provides an insight into the M. tuberculosis
strains circulating in Kampala. We have shown that the T2
family is likely to be responsible for the TB epidemic in
this region, and that import of new strains has not had a
significant bearing on the burden of disease in Rubaga
division. Additionally, strain types in our sample were
neither associated with drug resistance nor HIV sero-status.
