Abstract
Background: Timing the origin of human malarias has been a focus of great interest. Previous studies on the
mitochondrial genome concluded that Plasmodium in primates, including those parasitic to humans, radiated
relatively recently during a process where host switches were common. Those investigations, however, assumed
constant rate of evolution and tightly bound (fixed) calibration points based on host fossils or host distribution. We
investigate the effect of such assumptions using different molecular dating methods. We include parasites from
Lemuroidea since their distribution provides an external validation to time estimates allowing us to disregard
scenarios that cannot explain their introduction in Madagascar.
Results: We reject the assumption that the Plasmodium mitochondrial genome, as a unit or each gene separately,
evolves at a constant rate. Our analyses show that Lemuroidea parasites are a monophyletic group that shares a
common ancestor with all Catarrhini malarias except those related to P. falciparum. However, we found no
evidence that this group of parasites branched with their hosts early in the evolution of primates. We applied
relaxed clock methods and different calibrations points to explore the origin of primate malarias including those
found in African apes. We showed that previous studies likely underestimated the origin of malarial parasites in
primates.
Conclusions: The use of fossils from the host as absolute calibration and the assumption of a strict clock likely
underestimate time when performing molecular dating analyses on malarial parasites. Indeed, by exploring
different calibration points, we found that the time for the radiation of primate parasites may have taken place in
the Eocene, a time consistent with the radiation of African anthropoids. The radiation of the four human parasite
lineages was part of such events. The time frame estimated in this investigation, together with our phylogenetic
analyses, made plausible a scenario where gorillas and humans acquired malaria from a Pan lineage.

Background
Human malaria has been long recognized as a major global health problem. Malaria is caused by parasitic protozoa
belonging to the genus Plasmodium, a diverse group with
a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including reptiles, birds,
and mammals. The known Plasmodium species found in
mammals are mostly restricted to primates primarily from
Africa and Southeast Asia, as well as a handful of Plasmodium species parasitic to African rodents. There are four
species commonly found in humans; however, they are

not a monophyletic group but rather part of two distinct
clades of primate malarias indicating independent origins
as human parasites. One clade includes P. falciparum
together with several lineages found in African apes [1-7]
and the second includes the other three human malarial
parasites (P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae) intertwined
with the remaining Plasmodium species found in nonhuman primates [2,8-10]. The general consensus, supported by molecular phylogenetic inferences, is that host
switches are relatively common for primate malarial parasites and they have been crucial in the origin of those
found in humans [4-8,11-13].
Given the diversity of Plasmodium parasites found in
humans and their importance as cause of disease worldwide, it is of considerable interest to estimate a timeline

for the evolutionary path through which malarial parasites colonized the human host. Having such a timeline
will provide a necessary framework for investigating the
dynamic of speciation/host-switch events leading to the
actual human pathogens. It will also allow for hypothesis
testing while investigating adaptations at a molecular
level, such as those related with mechanisms of invasion.
However, the lack of a fossil record combined with
these complex dynamics involving host switches have
made molecular dating studies particularly difficult in
this important group of parasites. As a result, in-depth
analyses timing the origin of human malarias have been
limited.
Most evolutionary genetic studies that include timing
have used complete or partial mitochondrial genome
sequences. Those investigations have focused on the origins of P. vivax from non-human primates in Southeast
Asia [14,15] and P. falciparum from African apes
[3,5,16,17]. These molecular dating analyses have in common the use of relatively simple timing methodologies
that employ strong assumptions, which can introduce
biases in the estimated times. For example, recent studies
have assumed constant rate (strict) molecular clock models using tightly bound (fixed) calibrations based on fossils records or biogeographic events from the extant
hosts [10,17-19]. Such studies yielded estimates for the
origin of Plasmodium spp. in primates, and mammals in
general, that were very young (12-19 Mya, [10,17]) when
compared with the origin of their hosts (61.7 Mya for the
human-mouse divergence as minimum time, [20]).
Although ad hoc host switches offer plausible explanations for such discrepancies [10], it is possible that these
young time estimates for malarial parasites were the
result, at least in part, of using fixed calibration points
tightly defined around the host’s fossils underestimating
their time of divergence [18,19]. Moreover, whatever scenario past studies assumed, they all lacked an external
group that allowed them to validate the estimated divergence times. An event that will provide a most needed
external validation is the radiation of Plasmodium species
found in Lemuriformes.
Given the hosts’ geographic isolation, malarial parasites
from Lemuriformes provide a benchmark for validating
the plausibility of timeframes that can explain their introduction into Madagascar. Lemuridae malarias, originally
considered in the same sub-genus with rodent malarias,
are a group that appears to be as diverse as those found
in Cercopithecidae from Southeast Asia [21-23]. Nevertheless, no evidence has been provided indicating that
the lemur malarias are part of a monophyletic group
[21-23]. A recent phylogenetic analysis that included partial mitochondrial gene sequences (cyt b and cox1) from
a parasite found in a white sifaka, Propithecus verreauxi
[24], suggested that this lemur parasite lineage may share

a common ancestor with the group of Catarrhini parasites that includes the agents of human malarias
P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax. However, its relationship with rodent malarias was still unclear given the low
support at that node. Nevertheless, it was proposed that
Lemuridae Plasmodium might have radiated with their
hosts, 75-80 Mya [24]; a time frame that clearly contradicts estimates generated by previous studies [10,17].
Here we investigate the time of origin of human malarias as part of the radiation of Plasmodium found in primates. Specifically, we study the impact that different
molecular dating methods, assumptions and calibrating
points have in timing the radiation of primate malarias
and how this process relates to the lineages leading to
human parasites. In our analyses, we include nearly complete mitochondrial genomes for five species of Lemuridae malarias. The origin of those species are not used to
calibrate the clock per se since we have no grounds for
assuming co-speciation with their hosts, yet they provide
“a temporal landmark” that allows us to determine the
plausibility of timing scenarios. Thus, we compare estimated timelines and verify if they take into account the
introduction of primate malarias into Madagascar, an
event that could not have happened after the last terrestrial mammal colonization event (~20 Mya) [25,26].
Then, the complete mitochondrial genome analyses is
followed by a study of an extended dataset of partial
mitochondrial genome sequences recently reported
for African apes [7] in order to explore the origin of
P. falciparum.
In contrast to previous studies, we found that the Plasmodium mitochondrial genome (as a single locus or each
of its genes separately) does not evolve at a constant rate
necessitating the use of relaxed clock methods in timing
analyses. Our investigation indicates that previous timelines for the radiation of primate malarias and the origin
of those parasitic to humans were likely underestimates
since they fail to properly explain the introduction of
lemur malaria into Madagascar. Overall, our analyses
indicate that there were several ancient host-switches
among major mammalian Plasmodium during the
Eocene, a time compatible with the radiation of African
anthropoids (monkeys and apes) [27]. The separation of
the P. falciparum lineage from other mammalian clades
can be dated back to that time. Our analyses also indicate
that the divergence of three of the four lineages with
human parasites took place in the Oligocene, at a time
consistent with the divergence of Cercopithecoidea and
Hominoidea.

microscopy. Using cytb diagnostic primers, eight individuals were positive for Plasmodium spp.: one black and
white ruffed lemur, one indri, and the six lesser bamboo
lemurs (Table 1). However, we could only obtain complete mtDNA sequences from six samples. In these samples we found four haplotypes (A-D, Figure 1): two of the
haplotypes (A and C) were obtained from two different
individuals of lesser bamboo lemur, while haplotype B
was found in a black and white ruffed lemur and D in an
indri. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
of malarial parasites in these Lemuridae species that are
found at different locations than those previously studied
[23,24]; our species are in the eastern coast whereas previous reports are from the western and northwest parts
of Madagascar. In previous studies, four species of Plasmodium isolated from Eulemur macaco macaco were
described, but no molecular data was available for comparison [23]. We obtained the complete mitochondrial
genome from one of those parasite species (see methods)
[23]. The original E. m. macaco infection included three
different species [23]; however, after experimental infections, the isolates used in this investigation were enriched
with P. percygarnhami [23]. We included isolates from
these experimental infections finding one distinct haplotype and it is reported as Plasmodium sp. (E) (Figure 1,
see methods).
The genetic divergences among the five haplotypes (four
from the field samples reported in this study and one from
E. m. macaco [23]) suggest an equal number of Plasmodium species (Table 2). Indeed, the average divergence
among the lemur malaria haplotypes is twice the average
divergence observed among well characterized rodent
parasite species and at least one order of magnitude
greater than the polymorphism observed within Plasmodium species (e.g. P. vivax, P. knowlesi, P. chabaudi, and
P. falciparum (Table 2). Thus, the most parsimonious
explanation for such divergence among the five lemur
haplotypes is that they represent an equal number of species. In the case of P. ovale wallikeri and P. o. curtisi, the
divergence is more than double that found in subspecies
of rodent malaria (Table 2), supporting previous studies
indicating that these two lineages of P. ovale should be
considered sub-species [28].

When we evaluated the phylogenetic signal in all three
genes (cox3, cytb and cox1) and the non-coding region,
the results from the statistical saturation tests show that
overall all genes of the mitochondrial genome have phylogenetic information; however, cox3 seems to be the
gene with the most saturation. Specifically, if we assume
an asymmetric tree, we found that the 3rd positions in
cox3 are not useful in phylogenetic reconstructions.
Despite this saturation, the gene cox3 retains enough
phylogenetic information when all positions are used
(see additional file 1).
Therefore, we used the complete mitochondrial genome to infer phylogenetic relationships of Plasmodium
spp. from lemurs and other hosts using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods (Figure 1); these two analyses yield similar results. The phylogenetic analyses
were performed using the coding and non-coding
regions (see methods).
As expected, the rodent malaria parasites are part of a
monophyletic group that includes P. atheruri, the African
porcupine parasite (Figure 1); however, the phylogeny
and time estimates indicate that host-switches have taken
place among malarial parasites found in the rodent
families Muridae and Hystricidae. The five lineages of
lemur malarias are part of a monophyletic group that
shares a common ancestor with one of the groups of Catarrhini parasites, the one including all primate malarias
except those species found in the P. falciparum clade.
We found no evidence that the lemur parasites shared a
more recent common ancestor with rodent malarias [21].
This result holds when we include the partial sequence
(1671 bp) of lemur malaria reported elsewhere [24] (see
additional file 2). It is worth noting that the branching of
the lemur malaria clade resembles the relationship
among the host taxa [29], although there is no definitive
evidence of co-speciation.
The relative position of the human parasite P. ovale,
however, was not fully solved. In the analysis using
shorter sequences but an extended data set that included
several lineages found in African apes, P. ovale conforms
a monophyletic group with all Catarrhini parasites that is
a sister clade of the lemur lineage (Figure 2); however, it
seems to share a recent common ancestor with the lemur

parasites when the complete mtDNA (coding + non-coding regions) is used (Figure 1). These uncertainties, however, do not change the fact that parasites found in
Catarrhini and Lorisiforms primates share a common
ancestor in both analyses (see Figure 1 and 2).
The phylogeny obtained in Figure 1 was then used for
timing purposes. The assumption of a strict clock (constant rate of evolution) was rejected when we applied
maximum likelihood methods on the complete mitochondrial genome. Assuming different rates for each
gene and the non-coding regions, we have found a significant difference (c2 = 566.8, df = 34, p < 0.001) between
the fitting under the assumption of a strict molecular
clock (Ln = -9405.74, n parameters = 39) and no molecular clock (Ln = - 9122.32, n parameters = 73), rejecting
the strict molecular clock model. Consistent results were
found in each gene separately (data not shown). Thus, we
found that there was not a good fit to a “constant clocklike” rate in the Plasmodium mitochondrial genome and
that it exhibits rate heterogeneity among genes. The
divergence among genes in our phylogenetic analyses
and time estimates using relaxed clocks has a R2 = 0.70
for cytochrome b, followed by cox1 (R2 = 0.69) and cox3
(R2 = 0.60), indicating that cytochrome b and cox1 are
the genes with less rate heterogeneity. We therefore estimated divergence times using two different relaxed clock
methods and evaluated the effects of their assumptions
and of different calibration boundaries on these estimates
[19,30].
In order to study the effect of calibration points, we
calibrated the relaxed clocks with increasingly informative boundaries, starting with a minimum-only boundary
of 6 Mya for the divergence of African/Asian malarias
based on the fossil record of the Papio/Macaca split. The

second and third scenarios introduced a maximum
boundary on this same node based on either the fossil
record (8 Mya) or previous molecular clock estimates
(14.3 Mya) (see Methods). This approach produces multiple time estimates for each node that can then be compared to evaluate their robustness to model perturbations
(Table 3).
In all the scenarios explored, we find that BEAST produces time estimates that are significantly younger than
MultiDivTime (MDT) (Table 3 additional files 3 and 4).
The most extreme case is the one with a minimum-only
boundary (6 Mya) which produces time estimates that
differ, on average, by 60% (see additional files 3 and 4).
For example, the origin of South Asian primate parasites
was dated at 15.54 Mya (with a credibility interval of
7.66-25.24 Mya) using MDT and 4.09 Mya (2.61-6.31
Mya) by BEAST, whereas the origin of Plasmodium in
mammals was dated at 65.60 Mya (36.78-89.34 Mya) and
24.21 Mya (15.84-37.53 Mya) for MDT and BEAST
respectively. The uninformative nature of using only a
minimum time with a uniform probability distribution is
likely the major cause of this large discrepancy between
the two methods that implement different underlying
assumptions [19,30]. We therefore expected the two
methods to yield more similar estimates with increasingly
informative calibrations.
This is indeed what we find with the most conservative
calibration scenario, a uniform probability distribution
between 6-8 Mya, which produces time estimates for the
two methods that are within 8% of each other (on average)
(see Table 3 and additional file 5). Under this scenario
Catarrhini parasites (all Plasmodium found in primates
except those related to P. falciparum) are very young
when compared with the Homo-Macaca divergence

[20,27] supporting the notion that even the lineages leading to the human parasites P. ovale and P. malariae originated via host switches from an undetermined host. The
origin of African ape malarias, including the human parasite P. falciparum, is estimated at a time frame consistent
with multiple host switches among chimpanzee and gorillas, with a composite credibility interval (cCrI, [30]) of
6.12-13.06 Mya. The falciparum-reichenowi split, on the
other hand, is estimated between 1.75-4.71 Mya, a time
interval relatively young for the Homo-Pan divergence.
However, despite the similarities on the time estimates

yielded by the two timing methods, this scenario produces
divergence times that are inconsistent with the biogeographic distribution of the Lemuroidea malarial pathogens.
The divergence of the Lemuroidea and Catarrhini parasites is estimated at 16.31 and 15.66 Mya by MDT and
BEAST respectively, with a composite credibility interval
(cCrI, [30]) of 12.14-20.38 Mya (Table 3, Figure 3). The
credibility interval from BEAST does not include the
20 Mya benchmark (Table 3). Therefore, only the most
inclusive cCrI [30] barely includes the youngest boundary
of the colonization events of Madagascar by terrestrial

mammals and is included only by one of the two methods.
Such young time estimates leave the introduction of
malarial parasites in lemurs with an unexplained
mechanism.
The third scenario that we considered uses an informative calibration point (minimum and maximum boundary) and accounts for the underestimation bias of the
fossils [19] by using a molecular time estimate as upper
bound (14.3 Mya, see methods). Similar to the most conservative scenario, several primate malarias are younger
than their hosts, consistent with our current understanding of frequent host-switches in malarial parasites. We
found that MDT estimates are still older, on average,
than those obtained using BEAST (Table 3 and Figure
4A). However, under this scenario, both methods estimate times for the origin of Lemuroidea malarias that are
compatible with their known biogeographic distribution
with a cCrI of 11.71-33.14 Mya (see Table 3, Figure 3 and
additional file 6). It is worth noting that the two methods
now include the 20 Mya benchmark in their credibility
intervals but BEAST still gives younger estimates than
MDT. If true, these time estimates support an introduction of malarial parasites by terrestrial mammals other

than lemurs, and a subsequent adaptation of these
lineages to their lemur hosts. Furthermore, the divergence of the human malarial parasites P. malariae, from
the lineage leading to the macaque malarias is consistent
with the minimum time, 23.5 Mya, proposed for the
human-macaque split [20]. Interestingly, the falciparumreichenowi split is consistent with Pan-Homo divergence
whereas the radiation of African ape malarias could be as
young as cCrIs 2.21-7.54. We repeated these analyses
using only coding sequences, without cox3, and with
only first+second codon positions to evaluate the effect
of potentially saturated signals on the estimations. The
results were similar or slightly older (on average 12%
when cox3 is removed, data not shown).
Given that the time of divergence of P. malariae (and
potentially P. ovale) from the other parasites found in Cercopithecoidea is consistent with the proposed fossil evidence for the split of Homo and Macaca [20], we explored
the effect of this additional calibration point in our time
estimates as a minimum only boundary (Table 3, Figure
4B). Whereas the estimated times for the origin of primate
malarias are slightly older on average than those reported
in the original analyses (6-14.3 Mya as the calibration

Pacheco et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:299

point), these estimates have the advantage that their credibility intervals are dramatically reduced in both timing
methods. Indeed, several of the credibility intervals of this
scenario with two calibration points are within the credibility interval of the time estimates obtained by using 6-14.3
Mya only (see examples in Table 3 and comparison
between time trees A and B in Figure 4). It is also worth
noting that if we explore the effect of considering P. ovale
as monophyletic with other Catharrini parasites (a possibility not ruled out given the uncertainty found in that
clade), those time estimates (data not shown) are not different when the calibration point of 23.5 Mya is used for
all Catarrhini parasites excluding P. ovale (Table 3). It is
worth noting that relaxed clock methods can accommodate uncertainties in the phylogeny such as the one
observed in P. ovale [19,20]; however, researchers should
always check their effects on the credibility intervals.

Discussion
Timing the origin and radiation of human malarial parasites has been the subject of active discussions for almost
20 years. Yet in most phylogenetic studies, time has been
an implicit variable and not formally incorporated into
the analyses. The use of molecular clocks is problematic
even when good calibration points are available since
time estimates are affected by the underlying assumptions of the dating methods [18,19,30]. In phylogenetic
studies of parasitic organisms additional challenges occur
because of the absence of direct calibrations from the fossil record. Our study indicates that in order to estimate a
timeline for the evolution of parasites where there are
host switches such is the case of malarial parasites, we
need to use more complex assumptions and methodologies which compensate for variable evolutionary rates
(i.e., relaxed clock methods) and biased host fossils information (i.e., minimum and maximum boundaries).
Following this approach, we explored the consequences
on the estimated times by using different methods and
calibration boundaries and evaluated not only their
robustness to parameter perturbations, but also their
compatibility with known divergences and biogeographical distributions. Because of the presence in our phylogeny of a monophyletic group conformed by the five
lemur malarial lineages, we were able to use the colonization patterns of terrestrial vertebrates in Madagascar as a
proxy for biologically plausible time estimates, since the
introduction of malaria into lemurs could not have happened after the last terrestrial mammal colonization
event (~20 Mya) [25,26].
We found that time estimates vary across methods and
calibration boundaries used, suggesting that the time estimates on the Plasmodium mitochondrial DNA are not
robust to model and parameter perturbations. It may be
possible that such uncertainty could be reduced by

including nuclear and/or apicoplast genes. In any case,
such observed heterogeneity in evolutionary rates and
estimated divergence times should be considered given
the extensive use of mitochondrial genomes, and even
gene fragments, in malarial parasites studies [4,6,7,17]. In
the context of timing the origin of human malarias, some
estimates can be reasonably discarded based on biogeographic evidence. For example, the most commonly used
calibration point (the Papio/Macaca split) produces estimates that are too young when used tightly bound
around the fossil date (6-8 Mya, Table 3). This result
casts doubts on the recently proposed young divergence
times that were obtained with a strict clock and a young
calibration point [10,17].
Instead, we propose using a more inclusive time interval for the split of Southeast Asian and African malarial
parasites (6-14.3 Mya) that considers also the molecular
estimates for the divergence time of their hosts. Given
the indirect nature of the calibration points that are
used for parasitic organisms, we consider the inclusion
of all possible scenarios for the hosts a more reasonable
approximation even when using such broad calibrations
increases the credibility intervals. Several considerations
can be made based on this scenario.
First, all mammalian Plasmodium could be as old as
50.26 Mya, as the cCrI indicates for the 6-14.3 Mya scenario (53.03 Mya if we assume 23.5 Mya as minimum
time for the Catharrini parasites, see Table 3 and Figure
4). This estimate is significantly older than those previously reported. Such an early time provides new insights
about the origin of malarial parasites in mammals since it
is consistent with the radiation of African anthropoids
[27] and with the divergence of the contemporary rodent
lineages that harbor malarial parasites [31].
Second, it is clear that the sampled Lemuroidea parasites
did not originate with their hosts early in the evolution of
primates but rather arrived in Madagascar at a later time.
Our data, however, does not allow us to speculate about
the organisms that introduced malarial parasites into
lemurs in Madagascar (Figure 3) during the colonization
by terrestrial vertebrates between ~65 Mya and ~20 Mya
[25,26]. We explored an alternative scenario that has been
proposed where lemur malarial pathogens diverged with
their hosts 75-80 Mya [24]. However, if we assume such
an early calibration point (the split of lemurs from other
primates), the time estimates are too old for the radiation
of malarias in South Asia, an event that is well grounded
in both the host and parasite distributions and phylogenies
[8,14,32] (see additional files 3 and 4).
Finally, our time analyses provide a time frame for the
origin of the human pathogen P. falciparum. The lineage leading to the Laverania clade (the one including
P. falciparum) may have diverged from the other parasites in primates during the radiation of African

Figure 4 Timetrees for all known primate and rodent malarial parasites. Time is shown in millions of years ago (Mya). Divergence times
were estimated using two calibrations points: the host divergence Papio/Macaca (6-14.3 Mya) (Figure 4A) and then a second scenario that
includes a minimum of 23.5 Mya for the divergence of the pathogens in Homo and Macaca (Figure 4B). The horizontal bars show the credibility
intervals (CrIs); CrIs from MDT are shown in yellow, those from BEAST in blue and the overlap between the two is shown in green. Vertical lines
allow comparing the two timetrees. Notice that the two methods lead to similar estimates under scenario 4B as evidenced by the overlap in
their CrIs (green). Plasmodium sp. (A-E) are those found in lemurs.

anthropoids (see Figure 4A). Our estimates on the time
for the radiation of the Laverania species are, overall,
consistent with the proposed divergence for Homo and
Gorilla for the group of ape malarias including P. falciparum (Table 3). Our study differs from others by the
fact that we do not use the divergence of Homo and
Pan as a proxy to the P. falciparum - P. reichenowi
divergence. This assumption has been recently questioned given the possibility that P. falciparum originated
via a host-switch from a more complex dynamic among
African apes [4-7,33].
These scenarios were further explored in the extended
dataset that included several partial mitochondrial genome sequences from Plasmodium found in African apes
(Figure 2, Table 4). Like in the case of complete mitochondria, the 6-8 Mya scenario does not explain the origin of lemur malarias (data not shown). We then limit
our comparison to the more inclusive 6-14.3 Mya calibration at the Papio-Macaca split (one calibration) and

the scenario that considers the same 6-14.3 Mya with
23.5 Mya as a minimum (two calibrations). Unfortunately, the credibility intervals varied greatly in these
analyses carried out on partial sequences (Table 4 and
additional file 7). These results allow us to reiterate that
the use of short or single gene mitochondrial genes as
molecular clock for malarial parasites should be done
with extreme caution [17]. Nevertheless, it seems that
the radiation of the extant African ape malarial lineages
may have taken place as early as the radiation of the
hominoids, which includes both African and Asian apes.
Considering the phylogeny (Figure 2), it is clear that
there were several host switches among Gorilla and
Pan. However, the number of host switches needed is
the same in both scenarios, Gorilla or Pan proposed origins for P. falciparum. Thus, it is plausible that the
actual phylogeny of P. falciparum and related lineages
simply reflect that gorillas are particularly susceptible to
P. falciparum-like parasites and they acquired it from a

Time estimates and their credibility intervals (CrIs) were estimated with MultiDivTime (MDT) and BEAST using two calibration points (6-14.3 Mya for the
pathogens of Papio and Macaca; and a minimum of 23.5 for the divergence of the pathogens of human and macaques). Combined CrIs (cCrIs) are also shown.

Pan lineage. It is clear that host switches have occurred
in African apes; however, whether P. falciparum originated “recently” as result of a host switch from Gorilla
or Pan needs further investigation.

Conclusions
The expanded sampling of malarial parasites from lemurs,
chimpanzees, and gorillas, enriches our understanding
about the evolutionary history of malarial parasites. Lemur
malarias are a diverse group of species, their geographic
isolation and diversity make them an excellent system to
investigate factors leading to the radiation of parasite species. In the context of this investigation, lemur malarias
provided a much needed external validation point.
Whereas the mitochondrial genome seems suitable for
phylogenetic investigations, it does not evolve as a strict
molecular clock. The fact that the malaria mitochondrial
genome exhibits rate heterogeneity should be taken into
account in systematic, phylogeographic, and molecular
dating studies, especially those investigations that solely
use partial sequences. Based on our results, we recommend applying relaxed clock methods and exploring at
least two scenarios on an extended set of loci that should
also include nuclear genes whenever possible. The first
scenario should consider as a calibration point the inclusive interval for Southeast Asian and African non-human
primate malarial parasites (Figure 4A). The second scenario should include, in addition to the previous calibration point, one that considers the split of P. malariae from
other lineages at the time of the Cercopithecoidea and
Hominoidea split, a minimum time of 23.5 Mya (Figure
4B). Although this second calibration seems reasonable
given that it is consistent with all available data, it is an
additional assumption so its effect should be considered
separately. The observed rate heterogeneity in the mitochondrial genome makes us suggest that its use in molecular clock studies should focus on general trends
observed on the credibility intervals rather than punctual
time estimates. The timetrees obtained in this study,
which account for rate variations and fossil uncertainties;
confirm the common occurrence of host-switches in Plasmodium lineages. Contrary to previous studies, our findings favor older times for the divergence of the major
groups of primate parasites in the Oligocene with the origin of all mammalian Plasmodium and the separation of
the lineage leading to P. falciparum taking place as deep
as the Eocene, together with the radiation of African
anthropoids.
Methods
Samples

As part of an ongoing health assessment project, whole
blood samples in EDTA were collected from multiple
species of lemurs in Madagascar, between 2006 and 2009

Page 12 of 17

(See Table 1). DNA was extracted from venous blood
using QIAamp ® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH,
Hilden, Germany) and each sample was screened for
Plasmodium parasites by nested PCR by direct sequencing the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. Cytochrome b (cyt b)
was chosen for diagnostics given that this gene has been
widely used in malaria ecology and evolutionary biology
allowing us to access a relatively extensive dataset available in the Genebank (National Center for Biotechnology
Information, National Institutes of Health) that includes
Plasmodium and other haemosporidia. The cytb primers
are forward-TGT AAT GCC TAG ACG TAT TCC/
reverse-GTC AAW CAA ACA TGA ATA TAG AC;
which amplify a 1200 bp fragment. PCR amplifications
were carried out in a 50 μl volume reaction using 20 ng
of total genomic DNA, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 × PCR buffer,
1.25 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.4 mM
of each primer, and 0.03 U/μL AmpliTaq polymerase
(Applied Biosystems, Roche-USA). The PCR conditions
were: a partial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min and 35
cycles with 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 53°C and 2 min
extension at 72°C, a final extension of 10 min at 72°C
was added in the last cycle. All the cytb fragments were
identified as Plasmodium using BLAST showing significant similarity with different malarial parasite species
found in primates. For all positive samples, approximately 5,800 bp of the parasites mitochondrial genomes
(mtDNA) were amplified using the oligos Forward 5’
GAG GAT TCT CTC ACA CTT CAA TTC AAT TCG
TAC TTC and Reverse 5’ CAG GAA AAT WAT AGA
CCG AAC CTT GGA CTC with Takara LA Taq™ Polymerase (TaKaRa Takara Mirus Bio). The PCR conditions
were: a partial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min and 30
cycles with 30 sec at 94°C and 7 min at 68°C, and a final
extension of 10 min at 72°C. To detect mixed infections,
samples were both cloned and direct sequenced. Mixed
infections yield overlapping peaks in the sequence electropherogram when they are sequenced directly; they
also can be evidenced by inconsistencies among haplotypes obtained by cloning from independent PCR amplifications and/or inconsistencies between sequences
obtained by cloning and those obtained by direct sequencing (e.g. cyt b in this case). In all cases, at least two independent PCR products were cloned in the pGEM ® -T
Easy Vector Systems (Promega, USA), and four clones
were sequenced from each individual. In order to compare our molecular data with Plasmodium species previously found in lemurs, we included a species isolated
from E. m. macaco identified at the Muséum National
d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France [23]. The original
infection included three different species [23]; however,
after experimental infections using sporozoites from
laboratory feed mosquitoes, the isolate used in this investigation showed predominantly P. percygarnhami based

Pacheco et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:299

on microscopy. The amplification of only one haplotype
from this isolate is consistent with presence of only one
species; this finding was confirmed by four independent
PCR amplifications using cloning and direct sequencing.
Nevertheless, we choose to call this mitochondrial haplotype Plasmodium E until a single natural infection of P.
percygarnhami yield comparable results.
In addition to lemur samples, we also amplified the
mtDNA genome for P. atheruri isolated from an African
brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus) at the
Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris, France),
and P. ovale-wallikeri and P. ovale-curtisi isolated from
humans. The sequences reported in this investigation
from the field isolates are deposited in the GenBank
under the accession numbers HQ712051 to HQ712057.
The sequence from P. percygarnhami was deposited
under the number JN131536.
Phylogenetic analyses

The species and sequences included in these analyses
are described in Table 5. Sequences were aligned using
ClustalX Version 2 with manual editing. Phylogenetic
relationships were estimated using maximum likelihood
and Bayesian methods using MEGA 5.0 and MrBAYES
v3.1.2 respectively, with the complete mitochondrial
genome (coding and non coding regions) and then
using each gene as a separate partition plus the noncoding regions [34,35]. Both methods used a general
time reversible+gamma model (GTR+Γ) since it was the
one with lower number of parameters that best fitted
the data as estimated by MEGA 5.0. Bayesian support
for the nodes was inferred in MrBAYES using 4 × 106
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps after convergence was reached, discarding a very conservative
50% of the samples as burn-in. Sampling was performed
every 100 generations. Support for maximum likelihood
analyses was carried out using bootstrap with 200
replicates.
Given that mitochondrial genes have been widely used
in the study of malarial parasites, we evaluated the phylogenetic signal in all three genes (cox3, cytb and cox1)
and the non-coding region. We used methods based on
information theory as implemented in DAMBE [36,37].
The assessment of the phylogenetic information with
these methods was performed separately for the first, second and third positions of the genes, and also for the
joined sites. Saturation plots showing the relationship
between GTR+gamma and the simple p-difference (corrected by gene length) are shown along with the results
from the statistical saturation tests (see additional file 1).
Because the index of saturation performs differently
under different topology symmetries [36], we evaluated
the symmetry of the maximum likelihood tree using the
MESA software (http://www.agapow.net/software/mesa)

Page 13 of 17

[38]. We compare the observed entropy as estimated
assuming a symmetrical (Iss.c) or a highly asymmetrical
(http://Iss.cA) tree. The tree imbalance can change
depending on the node of the tree examined; we arbitrarily chose the node that includes most species as the critical point.
Estimation of divergence times: methods

We tested if the strict clock model fits the mitochondrial
genome data by using maximum likelihood methods as
implemented in PAML v4.4c. We used a GTR model of
substitution with heterogeneity among sites and we allow
for different rates among cytb, cox1, cox3 and the noncoding regions. We tested the fitting of the data under two
scenarios: i) assuming a global clock (equal rates along the
branches of the tree); and ii) assuming no clock (free parameters along each branch of the tree). The maximum likelihoods of the two fittings were compared via likelihood
ratio test with degrees of freedom equal to the difference
in the number of parameters between the two scenarios.
Based on the results of this test, we applied relaxed clock
methods to estimate divergence times of malaria parasites.
Times were obtained using MultiDivTime (MDT) and
BEAST v.1.6 on three mitochondrial genes (cox1, cox3,
cytb) and a non-coding mitochondrial region. These two
methods were chosen because they are widely used in timing analyses and because they rely on different sets of
assumptions [39,40]. An additional method (MCMCTree;
[41]) was also used in a subset of analyses and produced
similar or slightly older results. Because we are interested
in testing the validity of the young time estimates previously obtained [10,17] we discuss only the two methods
(MDT and BEAST) that produce the youngest results.
Genes were treated as separate partitions and parameters
were optimized specifically for each of them. Analyses
were carried out using (a) all four partitions (three genes
and non-coding regions), (b) excluding cox3 due to its
higher saturation, and excluding the 3rd codon position in
all three genes (data not shown). In MDT, branch lengths
were estimated with the Felsenstein84 (F84) model and
alpha values for the gamma distributions were estimated
with the program PamL v. 4.4c. In BEAST, the best fit
model (GTR+Γ), as found by MEGA 5.0, was used alongside a relaxed lognormal clock. Priors for the calibrations
were described by uniform distributions so that no particular time point within a given time interval was favored
(see below); such assumption facilitates the MDT and
BEAST comparison and limits the biases introduced by
skewed distributions (e.g., lognormal) in the absence of
strong evidence that would favor their use. In all cases the
maximum upper boundary for the ingroup root node was
conservatively placed at 91 Million years ago (Mya) (molecular time estimate of the divergence of humans and
rodents; [20]). Both relaxed clock methods were run until

Estimation of divergence times: calibration points

A widely used scenario assumes that African parasites
found in Mandrillus spp. and Cercocebus spp. [42]
diverged from those Plasmodium spp. found in Southeast
Asia macaques when Macaca branched from Papio [14].
Fossils identified as Macaca spp. indicate that such an
event took place 6-8 Mya as minimum boundaries [43].
These calibration points are used only as minimum times
when studying primates [44]. Since fossils usually underestimate the time of divergence [18,19], we explored several
scenarios. The first two scenarios were based on the conservative calibration points of 6-8 Mya for Papio-Macaca.
First, we use 6 Mya only as a minimum time and then, as
a second scenario, we consider 6 Mya as a minimum time
and 8 Mya as a “maximum” for the parasites. These two
calibrations are consistent with those considered elsewhere
[10,14]. A third scenario assumes that the divergence at
the same node took place between 6 Mya as a minimum
time and 14.3 Mya as a maximum, the latest being the
molecular estimate for the same Papio-Macaca divergence
event [45]. The use of 14.3 Mya as a maximum is consistent with older fossils reported for Macaca spp. (9.5 Mya
reported in Qi 1979, Paleobiology Database at http://www.
paleodb.org/) and considers also the fact that P. gonderi is
a parasite of Chlorocebus (a Cercopithecini), making this
scenario more inclusive. Finally, we explore using a combination of the 6-14.3 Mya calibration with a minimum of
23.5 Mya for the human/Macaca split, where the second
calibration point was used at the base of the primate
malarias found in both Humans and Cercopithecoidea. In
addition to these scenarios, we explored the robustness of
our time estimates using a large data set that includes the
most recent gorilla and chimpanzee malaria sequences
(mtDNA-3.4 kb, [7]) using a conservative and an inclusive
scenario (6-8 Mya and 6-14.3 Mya).
Additionally, the results of each of these scenarios are
compared to the known biogeographical distribution of
malaria, especially in lemur species which are currently
present only in Madagascar. The colonization of Madagascar by terrestrial mammals, including lemurs, happened during a relatively short timeframe in the
Cenozoic (~65-20 Mya) during which ocean currents
allowed for the eastward transport of vegetation rafts
from Africa to Madagascar [25,26]. This colonization
pattern means that either the Lemuroidea malarial pathogens co-speciated with their host at the time of colonization, or they were introduced sometime after the initial
colonization by other mammals. In either case, divergence times younger than ~20 Mya are unlikely to be
biologically realistic and, therefore, provide a validation
criterion for the accuracy of time estimates.
