Phylogenetic exploration of hantaviruses in
paraguay reveals reassortment and host
switching in South America
Yong-Kyu Chu1, Robert D Owen2,4 and Colleen B Jonsson1,3*

Abstract
Background: Longitudinal mark-recapture studies of rodents in two sites in the Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve in
the Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay have revealed a complex and intriguing pattern of hantaviruses
harbored by rodents in this area. Full-length sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were conducted for several
rodents from Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys fornesi. The phylogenetic relationships of these viruses were
analyzed in the context of hantaviruses in South America with published S- and M-segment sequences.
Findings: Phylogenetic analyses of hantaviruses identified in the Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve in Paraguay
revealed Jabora and Juquitiba viruses are harbored by Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys fornesi, respectively.
These analyses revealed that in general the constituents of the major subclade for the S- and M-segments differ for
the South American hantaviruses. Further, the two major groups within subclade C for the M-segment reflect in
general the lethality associated with the viruses within each group.
Conclusions: Phylogenetic studies of Jabora and Juquitiba viruses and other Paraguayan viruses in the context of
American hantaviruses revealed reassortment and host-switching in the evolution of South American hantaviruses.
Keywords: Hantavirus, reassortment, host switching, zoonotic pathogens, ecology, emerging pathogens, phylogenetics, Akodon, Oligoryzomys

Findings
Numerous South American hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) [1]. These viruses
are harbored by rodents and studies suggest that each
virus has coevolved with its unique rodent reservoir
host, which allows viral persistence in the reservoir [2].
Our studies in the Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve in the
Interior Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay have
revealed a complex and intriguing pattern of hantaviruses harbored by rodents in this area [3]. In Paraguay,
Laguna Negra (LAN) virus in Calomys laucha was identified as the etiologic agent following an outbreak of
HPS in western Paraguay [4].
We have conducted longitudinal mark-recapture studies of rodents in two sites in the Reserve (Jejui Mi and

Horqueta Mi), and two outside (Rama III and Britez
Cue) [3]. We have analyzed rodent population dynamics
and hantavirus seroprevalence in this subtropical region
[5] and reported on sympatry of hantaviruses in Akodon
montensis and Oligoryzomys fornesi [3]. Full-length
sequencing and phylogenetic analyses from several
rodents from each species support these rodents as
reservoirs of genotypes of Jabora virus (JABV) and
Juquitiba virus (JUQV), respectively (Figure 1 and 2).
JUQV is associated with HPS in cases in Brazil and in
northeastern Argentina [6,7], while JABV-like viruses
are not [8].
We have made Baysian phylogenetic analyses of these
and published S and M sequences that have at least one
Kb of sequence from American hantaviruses (Figure 1
and 2). In Figure 1 and 2, for the JABV and JUQV identified in the Reserve, the genotype is indicated as the
viral strain followed by the rodent reservoir and identification number. The phylogenetic relationships of

Figure 2 Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of full length M-segment open reading frame nucleotide sequences of hantaviruses in
Paraguay in the context of the Americas. Abbreviations: Akodon montensisis Akmo; Oligoryzomys fornesiis Olfo.; Clades are grouped A, B, C;

subclade C reveal several features in the evolution of
hantaviruses in Paraguay and in South America when
comparisons are made between S- and M-segments.
First, these phylogenetic analyses revealed that in general the constituents of the subclade C for the S- and

M-segments differ for the South American hantaviruses.
For the S-segment, the phylogenetic tree for subclade C
shows four subgroups: C1-JAB strains (Brazil, Paraguay),
and a strain (AAI) from Itapúa, Paraguay; C2- Andes
(AND), Araraquara (ARA), and Juquitiba (JUQ) viruses

relationship with JABV. In agreement with in vitro published reassortant studies of ANDV [10], the AAIV genotype was a reassortment of the S-segment of the JABVlike viral genotypes and the M-segment of the AND-like
viral genotypes. The direction of the reassortment
would suggest spillover of the AND-like viral genotype
into an A. montensis, which would have necessarily harbored a JABV at that time. Even more intriguing is the
grouping of JABV in the S- and M-Segment analyses.
The JABV strain clearly shows a strong relationship in
the M-segment C-2 subclade with the LAN and RIOM
viral strains. However, the S-segment analyses reveal
that the JAB and AAI are more closely related, and
remarkably, these strains do not cluster with any of the
other subclades, C2-4.
Finally, the phylogenetic trees do not support strong
associations of any host phyletic groups within any subclade. The lack of association with the rodent groups
argues that unlike hantaviruses in Europe and Asia [2],
hantaviruses do not show the level of coevolution with
their hosts in South America and hence these viruses
have great potential for host switching and adaptation.
Certainly, the recent radiation of the Sigmodontinae in
South America [11,12] reflects a more recent introduction of hantaviruses into South America. Molecular
clock analyses suggest that hantaviruses were introduced
approximately 800 years ago [13].
In summary, future studies that integrate large scale
phylogeographic mapping coupled with local molecular
phylogenetic analyses of rodent-hantavirus relationships
in the Americas have great potential to address important questions in the ecology of zoonotic pathogens
such as the molecular events that lead to transfer and

(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay); C3- Caño Delgadito
(CAD), and Choclo viruses (Venezula, Panama); and,
C4- LAN, Rio Mamoré (RIOM), Maporal viruses (Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, Venezula). All the subclade C
groups show strong bootstrap values except for C4,
which is due to the sequence of Maporal virus. For the
M-segment, the phylogenetic tree for subclade C shows
three subgroups: C1- Choclo; C2-LAN, RIOM, JAB
viruses; and, C3- AND, ARA, JUQ viruses. Notably, the
M-segment analyses improved the low bootstrap value
for the group with Maporal virus through creation of an
independent subgroup (compare M-segment C2 and Ssegment C4).
Secondly, we noted two major groups within subclade
C for the M-segment that reflect in general the lethality
associated with the viruses within each group. Most of
the viruses in subclade C2 show a mortality in HPS
cases of ~5-10%. In contrast, many of the viruses in subclade C3 show a very high mortality of 40-50%. The Ssegment phylogenetic tree further subdivides the M-segment C2 subclade into the JABV group (S-segment C1)
and the LANV/RIOM group (S-segment C4). At present, we have no information on whether viruses of the
JABV group cause HPS. The amino acid homologies of
representatives of these viruses also break into two
major groups based on low or high severity of HPS
(Table 1).
Our analyses further revealed a reassortment of AAIV
(harbored by A. montensis), identified in Itapúa, Paraguay [9], that falls in subclade C3 in the M-segment.
AAIV shows a strong relationship with Pergamino virus
(PRGV), originally identified in Argentina in A. azarae.
However, for the S-segment, AAIV shows a strong

adaptation to a new host. In South America, events that
lead to transmission, host switching, recombination,
reassortment and post-transfer adaptation have not been
addressed. These questions are critical to interpretation
of ecological trends in the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases, causes of outbreaks, and importantly,
guidelines for control and prevention of disease.
