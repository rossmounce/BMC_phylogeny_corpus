Abstract
Background: Several studies have shown that genomes contain a mixture of transposable
elements, some of which are still active and others ancient relics that have degenerated. This is true
for the non-LTR retrotransposon Helena, of which only degenerate sequences have been shown
to be present in some species (Drosophila melanogaster), whereas putatively active sequences are
present in others (D. simulans). Combining experimental and population analyses with the sequence
analysis of the 12 Drosophila genomes, we have investigated the evolution of Helena, and propose
a possible scenario for the evolution of this element.
Results: We show that six species of Drosophila have the Helena transposable element at different
stages of its evolution. The copy number is highly variable among these species, but most of them
are truncated at the 5' ends and also harbor several internal deletions and insertions suggesting that
they are inactive in all species, except in D. mojavensis in which quantitative RT-PCR experiments
have identified a putative active copy.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that Helena was present in the common ancestor of the Drosophila
genus, which has been vertically transmitted to the derived lineages, but that it has been lost in
some of them. The wide variation in copy number and sequence degeneration in the different
species suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of Helena depends on the genomic environment of
the host species.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components
in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. They constitute
the largest part of some of them [1], and play an impor-

tant role in their evolution [2]. Genome sequencing has
shown that TE sequences constitute about 15% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome [3,4], about 45% of the
human genome [5], and up to 90% of the genomes of

some plants [6]. Why species harbor such different proportions of TEs is still unknown, but it may be related to
the reproductive characteristics and population size of the
host [7,8], and to environmental stresses [9] that may
influence TE dynamics. Various different mechanisms
may prevent genome invasions by TEs, ranging from DNA
deletions [10,11] to epigenetic control mechanisms, such
as chromatin conformation [12].
Several studies have shown that genomes harbor a mixture of TEs, some of which are still active, whereas others
are ancient relics that have degenerated [13-16]. Degraded
elements can result from point mutations or from DNA
deletion [17]. Deletions may occur either by recombination, which is common to all classes of elements, or as a
consequence of the transposition mechanism of the specific element concerned. For instance, the latter occurs in
LINE elements (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements, also
known as non-LTR retrotransposons or retroposons),
which are retroelements that use an RNA intermediate to
transpose [2]. Their transposition mechanism leads to 5'
end truncations of the new inserted sequence. Considerable internal deletions have previously been reported in
the inactive copies of several non-LTR retrotransposons
[10], and this deletion mechanism seems to act at an high
rate, since sequences that are similar at the nucleotide
level may have very different internal deletions
[10,11,18,19].

Results
Identification and analysis of reference copies
Using the full-length copy of Helena already identified in
the draft sequence of the D. simulans genome [18], and 23
reverse transcriptase (RTase) fragments of the melanogaster
species group [10], we performed a search for Helena-like
elements in the other 10 Drosophila genomes. We identified Helena reference sequences in all the genomes (Additional file 1), apart from D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D.
willistoni and D. grimshawi (Figure 1). The results of Blast
analyses in D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. willistoni
revealed only short sequences (10 copies ≤ 210 bp, 23
copies ≤ 251 bp and seven copies ≤ 100 bp, respectively)
with percentage identities to the BS element that were
higher than or similar to those to Helena (D. pseudoobscura
– BS: 78%, Helena: 69%, D. persimilis – BS: 80%, Helena:
74%, D. willistoni: BS: 85%, Helena: 89%). BS is a previously-described LINE element that belongs to the same
"jockey clade" as Helena [27]. Sequences equally distant
from BS and Helena have also been reported in D. melanogaster, and it has suggested that they may constitute a
new family, named Helena/BS [21]. We did not therefore
classify these sequences as Helena elements, and performed no further analysis of them. Our results for D.
pseudoobscura are not consistent with previous data
reported by Petrov et al. [10], who isolated just one
sequence in this species. However, we should note that

One example of this type of TE evolution is the retrotransposon Helena, which is a 4,912 bp LINE [18] first reported
in the D. virilis species [20], and later identified in all the
species analyzed in the melanogaster subgroup, as well as
in D. pseudoobscura [10]. Helena has been shown to be
present at different stages of its life-cycle in natural populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Only degenerate copies were found in D. melanogaster [4,18,19,21,22],
whereas in D. simulans several different types of sequences
have been identified, ranging from highly degenerate to
putatively active ones [18]. The analysis of Helena in these
two closely-related species has shown how important the
host genome can be in the evolution of a TE, and how
important it is to analyze specific TE families in a wide
spectrum of species. This is possible now that the genome
sequences of 12 Drosophila species [23-26] are available,
and Helena can be considered to provide an ideal model
system for investigating TE evolution across a range of species.
We investigated the evolution of Helena sequences using a
combination of experimental and population analyses
with sequence analyses of the 12 Drosophila genomes, and
we propose a possible scenario for the evolution of the
element in the different host genomic environments that
influence the "fate" of TEs.

the same strains were not used in these two studies, and
this could explain the differing results. We did not detect
any Helena sequences in D. grimshawi, which is consistent
with the fact that this a TE-poor genome [25], but in all
the other species the selected reference copies we examined all contained one or two open reading frames (ORF1
and ORF2) (Figure 2).
The D. sechellia reference sequence (see Additional File 2
for details) is 4,888 bp long, and contains several of the
hallmarks of Helena-related elements that have already
been characterized: a 15 bp poly-A tail, and two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). The first
ORF is 1,732 bp, and the second 2,870 bp long. Both
ORFs are interrupted by three premature stop codons, and
the pol-like protein contains only the reverse transcriptase
domain.
In the other species in the melanogaster group, the reference copies are smaller than the Helena reference copy in
D. simulans. In D. erecta (see Additional File 3 for details)
and D. ananassae (Additional File 4), the ORF1 and ORF2
are separated by sequences of 279 bp and 401 bp respec-

tively, but both species contain the apyrimidic endonuclease, the exonuclease and the reverse transcriptase domains
(Figure 2). In D. yakuba (Additional File 5) and D. virilis
(Additional File 6) the reference copies consist only of a
small ORF2, 1,755 bp and 561 bp in length, respectively.
The reference copy of D. mojavensis is the only putatively
active Helena-like element identified in the species analyzed (Additional File 7). It is 4,502 bp long, and harbors
two overlapping ORFs without premature stop codons.
The first ORF is 1,782 bp long, and potentially encodes a
593 aa protein. The second is 2,722 bp long, and could
encode a 907 aa protein. Moreover, the gag-like protein
contains a conserved PRE_C2HC domain, and the pollike protein contains the three domains required for its
function: an apyrimidic endonuclease, an exonuclease
and a reverse transcriptase domain. However, the poly-A
tail was not identified.

with sizes ranging from 80 bp (D. yakuba) to 4,888 bp (D.
sechellia). The average percentage identity of the copies
with the reference within each species ranged from
91.51% (D. ananassae) to 95.95% (D. yakuba). Size-divergence between these copies results from the presence of
indels that occur throughout the sequences (Additional
File 8). No relationship can be inferred between the size
and the percentage identity, since copies with small sizes
display an identity level as high as the larger ones (Figure
3). This may be expected when considering only the 5'
truncations, produced by the transposition mechanism of
Helena. However, the different copies reported here are
also internally deleted, and can be expected to be old relics of Helena, with more neutral mutations than the fulllength copies. The only exception concerns D. sechellia, in
which significant correlation between size of the copies
and identity was detected. This is probably due to the large
number of copies detected in this species.

Analysis of the activity in natural populations
Since our in-silico analyses show that only D. simulans and
D. mojavensis harbor full-length, putatively active copies,
we performed Southern blot analyses on several populations of these two species to infer their TE activity (Figure
5 and Additional File 9). Our results show that these species display insertion polymorphism, suggesting that
Helena is active. We cannot of course exclude the possibility of restriction fragment length polymorphism, which
would lead to the same kind of result. The qRT-PCR experiments on these two species show that Helena is highly
expressed in D. mojavensis, which displayed population
variability that contrasted with that of D. simulans, in
which the levels of expression were much lower (Figure
6). We were only able to compare the Helena transcripts,
because the housekeeping gene (rp49) used to normalize
qRT-PCR is equally expressed in both species (Additional
File 10).

Table 2 shows the average GC content for the upstream
and downstream regions of the Helena insertions for each
species. It ranges from 36.8% (D. erecta) to 43.1% (D.
melanogaster). These values are closer to the intergenic
values for these species (35.3% – 39.9%) than to those for
the gene regions (46.8% – 50.4%), suggesting that Helena
is more abundant in the non-transcribed genomic environment [4,16,28-30]. The genome of D. melanogaster is
the only one in which the GC values were intermediate
between those of the intergenic and gene regions. This
could simply reflect the better annotation available for the
D. melanogaster genome.

Discussion
This study describes the evolutionary dynamics of the
Helena non-LTR retrotransposon in the sequenced Drosophila genomes. We have shown that Helena occurs in D.
sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta and D. ananassae (melanogaster species group), in D. mojavensis (repleta group)
and in D. virilis (virilis group), as well as in D. melanogaster
and D. simulans, which had been studied previously
[10,18]. In D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. willistoni,
the small copies that we found displayed similar percentage identities to Helena as to BS, a non-LTR retrotransposon related to Helena. Sequences with the same kind of
similarity have been reported in D. melanogaster, and were
grouped by the authors as Helena/BS family [21]. The D.
pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. willistoni sequences we
found can be included in this family. We agree with the
suggestion that there could be members of the Helena/BS
family in these species as shown in D. melanogaster [21],
and so we did not include them in our study. The 907 bp

Helena-related sequences form a monophyletic clade (Figure 4) that includes a well-defined cluster of the species of
the melanogaster subgroup (D. yakuba, D. simulans, D. melanogaster, D. erecta and D. sechellia). The other group contained D. ananassae, D. virilis and D. mojavensis. This
phylogeny is typical for a TE with vertical transmission.

the common ancestor of the Drosophila genus, and has
been vertically transmitted to the derived lineages, but
subsequently lost in some of them, or at least diverged so
much as to escape detection. The high variability in copy
number and sequence degeneration in the different species shows that the evolutionary dynamics of Helena
depends on the genomic environment, as has already
been reported for other retrotransposons, such as Tirant
[31].

sequence of Helena that had been previously described
(GenBank AF012036) in a strain (stock center: 140110121-0, Tucson, Arizona) of D. pseudoobscura [10] was not
found in the sequenced genome of this species. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Helena is a monophyletic
group of sequences patchily distributed in the species of
the two subgenera of the genus Drosophila (Figure 1). Taking our data together with those from other authors
[10,18,20], we can conclude that Helena was present in

Recent work has reported the presence of deteriorated and
inactivated Helena in the D. melanogaster genome, but also
of a full-length copy in D. simulans carrying all the structures required for activity, and with a high level of insertion polymorphism in the natural populations [18]. This
suggests that in this species Helena is either still active or
has been active until recently. In our analysis, all the reference copies in the other 10 Drosophila genomes were
found to be devoid of intact ORFs, except in D. mojavensis.
In this species, two copies of Helena contain intact ORFs,
which suggest that full-length and potentially active
Helena sequences could exist. This means that this species
may offer a unique opportunity for studying the evolutionary dynamics of Helena.
Our analysis of the copy numbers reveals a strikingly variable distribution of Helena in the 12 species. In D. sechellia, 181 copies of Helena were observed, whereas in D.
erecta only seven copies were identified. Even though
these genomes have not been well annotated, and there
are some low quality sequences that could bias copy
number estimation, this should not invalidate the tendency identified. It has been proposed that effective population size could be one of the main factors accounting
for differences in copy number of TEs [32,33], with selection against TEs being less effective in smaller populations
[34]. This seems to apply to D. sechellia. This species is
restricted to the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean,
and is the most specialized fly within the melanogaster

group. It has a very low effective population size [35,36],
and carries the highest number of Helena sequences
recorded (181 copies). We would expect to find a similar
scenario for D.erecta, which is also a specialized species
with a small population size [37,38]. However, as has also
been observed for the mariner element, the observed copy
number of Helena is not in fact consistent with this
hypothesis [37]. This means that other factors may be
affecting the copy number of TEs, including genomic and
environmental features.
We did not observe any major differences in copy number
between the two species of the Drosophila subgenus, even
though D. mojavensis has a higher copy number than D.
virilis. What is more striking is that the only potentially
full-length active copies identified were detected in D.
mojavensis, together with the other potentially active copy
previously described in D. simulans [18]. The Southern
blot analyses of several natural populations of D. mojavensis and D. simulans suggest that Helena has recently displayed transpositional activity. However, we confirmed
that the transcriptional activity is low in D. simulans, as
had previously been suggested [18], and this clearly indicates that Helena is being lost in this species. In D.
mojavensis, the situation is completely different. We have
observed high levels of Helena transcripts in several popu-

lations, confirming its activity. Moreover, expression varied between different populations, indicating that Helena
must be present at different stages of its evolutionary
cycle, i.e. different stages of activity, in different populations within this species.
Our analysis has shown that the evolution of Helena is
influenced by the host species, resulting in differences in
copy number, degradation and activity. In all the species
analyzed, D. mojavensis is the only one in which the
Helena has survived, which gives us a unique opportunity
to observe the "fate" of this TE. However, it is crucial to
investigate natural populations from this and other species in the repleta group in order to find out how widespread the scenario described here actually is, and to
understand the process and speed of the degradation and
extinction of Helena.

Conclusion
Here we show that six species of Drosophila have Helena
transposable elements at different stages of its evolution,
and may represent different stages of the TE evolutionary
cycle. The copy number is highly variable in different species, but most of them are truncated at the 5' ends and display several internal deletions and insertions. In all the
species analyzed, Helena has only survived in D. mojaven-

Methods
In-silico analyses
The draft sequence data from the 10 related Drosophila
Genome Sequencing Projects used in this study are listed
in the Table 3. Sequence searches for the Helena element
were carried out using the 4,912 bp full-length sequence
of Helena characterized in D. simulans [18] as the query.
Twenty-three partial sequences of reverse transcriptases
(RTases) of Helena from the melanogaster group [10], and
the two LINE elements closest to Helena, BS [27] and X

[39] were found. Comparisons between the query and the
Drosophila data set were performed using High Scoring
Pairs (HSPs) within BLAST algorithms [40] with an Evalue ≤ 1e-10. The sequences correspond to the three best
BLAST hits, which were more than 80 bp in length, and
were selected and extended to include 3 kb of the flanking
regions. These sequences were analyzed using the ORFFINDER program to identify putative occurrences of coding regions [41]. Conserved domains were predicted using
the "Conserved domain search" tool from NCBI, as well
as BLASTn and BLASTx searches against the nt and nr databases, respectively. Thus, we determined the most complete Helena sequence in each of the 10 Drosophila species

to be considered as a reference copy within each genome.
To determine the copy number in each species, the previously-determined reference copy was blasted against the
full genomes. Significant matches were required to be
more than 80 bp long, and to have at least 80% identity
[42]. Regions similar to Helena that were separated by less
than 200 bp were considered to be a single insertion. For
each genome, the copies have been aligned with the reference, using MUSCLE [43] and the % identity to the reference was computed using the DNADIST program from the
PHYLIP package [44]. The flanking regions of each insertion were extracted for analysis of the GC content in the
first 5,000 nt using "geecee" of the EMBOSS package [45].
The GC contents of the flanking regions of the Helena elements were compared to those of the intergenic regions
and genes (exon plus introns) in the other Drosophila
genome versions, as noted in the Table 3.
Phylogenetic analyses
The sequences used in the evolutionary analysis were
obtained from GenBank: Jockey (M22874), TART

Southern blot
The occurrence of Helena in populations of D. simulans
and D. mojavensis (Additional File 8) was confirmed by
Southern blot using the detection system Gene Images
CDP-Star detection module (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Genomic DNA was prepared from 50
adult flies [49] and digested by Hind III, which has no
restriction site within the Helena sequence, so that each
hybridized fragment would correspond to a single
genomic insertion. The restricted fragments were separated in 1% agarose gels, and transferred to Hybond N+
membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK).
Blots were prehybridized for 1 h at 60°C in 5× SSC, in 5%
dextran sulfate, subjected to 20-fold dilution of the liquid
block, and hybridized overnight with the probes. Blots
were washed twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and then
exposed to autoradiographic film for 20 minutes at room
temperature. A 644 bp Helena sequence amplified from
plasmid AF012044 (DsechF: 5' AGGATTTGTCATGCCACGCT 3' e DsechR R 5' TGTTTGGTGCTGCCATGTGT 3'), and a 674 bp sequence, corresponding to the
RTase of D. mojavensis Helena (DmojF: 5' TAAGAG
GCCATAGTACGGAGCAGGTA3' and DmojR: 5' GCGAAT
TGGAACAGGCTAACGCAT 3'), were used as probes for
the D. simulans and D. mojavensis populations, respectively.
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
The expression profiles of Helena RTase in different populations of D. simulans and D. mojavensis (Additional File 8)
were determined by real-time PCR. For this analysis, 20
ovaries and 15 carcasses of each population were used to
extract total RNA using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 1 μg of total
RNA treated with DNAse Ambion was converted into
cDNA using Thermoscript kit (Invitrogen) primed with
oligo-dt and random primers mix. The cDNA samples
were diluted 50 fold, and PCR was carried out using
QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Roche) on the LightCy-

that amplify 193 bp and 204 bp respectively. Quantitative
PCR cycling conditions were 5 min at 95°C (1 cycle), 15 s
at 95°C, followed by 10 s at 62°C and 20 s at 72°C (50
cycles). A negative control for DNA contamination of
cDNA of each population (without Thermoscript
enzyme) was tested (data not shown). Reactions were
done in duplicate, and standard curves were calculated
from serial dilutions of specific amplified PCR fragments.
The quantity of the transcripts was estimated relative to
the RP49 expression (qPCR fragments of 182 bp and 167
bp for D. simulans and D. mojavensis respectively). Primers
were: RP49_DsimF: 5' CGGATCGATATGCTAAGCTGT 3',
RP49_DsimR:
5'
GCGCTTGTTCGATCCGTA
3',
RP49_DmojF: 5' GTCGTCGCTTCAAGGGCCAAT 3',
RP49_DmojR: 5' ATGGGCGATCTCACCGCAGTA 3'. In
both species, RP49 expression is equivalent (Additional
Figure nine) allowing relative expression of Helena to be
comparable between D. mojavensis and D. simulans.
Hence, Helena transcripts plotted in Figure 6 are the result
of quantification of Helena transcripts normalized by the
quantification of RP49 transcripts for each strain.
