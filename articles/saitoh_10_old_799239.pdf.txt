long-term survival through the Ice Ages

Abstract
Background: Unlike northern Europe and most of northern North America, the Eastern Palearctic and the
northwesternmost tip of North America are believed to have been almost unglaciated during the Quarternary
glacial periods. This could have facilitated long-term survival of many organisms in that area. To evaluate this, we
studied the phylogeography in east Asia and Alaska of a boreal migratory passerine bird, the Arctic Warbler
Phylloscopus borealis, and compared our results with published data on especially North American species.
Results: In a sample of 113 individuals from 18 populations we identified 42 haplotypes of the mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene, which separated into three clades: A - Alaska and mainland Eurasia (except Kamchatka); B Kamchatka, Sakhalin and Hokkaido; and C - Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (i.e. Japan except Hokkaido). The oldest
split among these clades, between A/B and C, is estimated to have taken place sometime between the mid
Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and the second divergence, between clades A and B, in the early to mid
Pleistocene. Within all of the three main clades, there are signs of population expansion.
Conclusions: The Arctic Warbler separated into three main clades in close succession around the Pliocene/
Pleistocene border, with the two northern clades diverging last. All three clades probably experienced population
bottlenecks during the Pleistocene as a result of range shifts and contractions, but nevertheless survived and
maintained their integrities. Several other clades of Northeastern Palearctic birds are noted to have diversified
during the Pliocene. In contrast, avian species or phylogroups presently occupying formerly glaciated North
American ground are generally younger. The differences between these regions could be due to slower speciation
rates in the Eastern Palearctic due to less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer
survival of Eastern Palearctic clades as a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern North
America. Several other Palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns to that of the Arctic
Warbler, indicating common causes of their diversifications.

Background
In recent years, substantial knowledge accumulated on
the genetic consequences of the climatic oscillations in
the Quaternary for European and North American species [e.g. [1-4]]. Since the ice sheets repeatedly spread
considerably southward on both continents during glacial periods (to 52°N in Europe and 40°N in North
America at the last glacial maximum, 23-18 kya; [3]),
boreal and temperate biota were repeatedly pushed
southward into isolated refugia and subsequently recolonized northward again. As a result, shallow genetic

divergence [5-8] and low genetic diversity [1,9,10] are
typical of various taxa in northern regions. In contrast,
relatively deep DNA divergences [7,11] and higher
genetic diversity [1] occur in many taxa inhabiting temperate refugial areas in Europe and North America, suggesting survival of these populations over several glacial
periods. Since the Eastern Palearctic and northwesternmost tip of North America are considered to have
remained largely ice-free throughout the Quaternary
[12-14] (but see [15] for a different opinion), deep DNA
divergences and high genetic diversity would also be
expected in that region. However, even in the absence
of ice sheets, the habitats in that region are believed to
have been much affected by the climatic oscillations,

and this is likely to have affected the distributions and
consequently also the population dynamics of many
animals.
Several studies have dealt with the phylogeography of
widespread northern Palearctic animals, including mammals such as badger Meles meles [16], hares Lepus spp.
[17], and various rodents [18-23], as well as birds
including ducks [24], shorebirds[25,26], woodpeckers
[27,28], and several species of passerines [26,29-41].
Most of these studies have reported little or no divergence over large areas of the northern Palearctic,
although some divergent clades, mostly dated to the
Pleistocene, have been found in some species. For example, a southeastern Palearctic clade has been noted in
several birds and mammals and also in an amphibian
and two ants, suggesting common causes of their divergences (reviewed in [22]). Hewitt et al [3] concluded
that some Arctic species have shallow genetic clades
with coinciding geographical boundaries. Some phylogeographical studies of birds have dealt with groups of
closely related species with extensive north-south distributions from the taiga to temperate forests in central
China and the Himalayas, and some of these have found
relatively deep divergences between boreal and more
southern taxa, which date back to the Pliocene or early
Pleistocene [42-44].
The Arctic Warbler Phylloscopus borealis is a small
insectivorous passerine, which breeds in the boreal forests from northern Scandinavia through Siberia to
Alaska, south to northern Mongolia, Russian Far East,
northeasternmost China and Japan [45,46] (Fig. 1). All
populations winter in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the
Philippines [45,46]. This is the only species in the large
genus Phylloscopus that breeds in North America [45].
Three to six morphologically subtly different subspecies
are generally recognised, with much disagreement
among authors [45-51] (Fig. 1). In the breeding season,
it inhabits both coniferous, mixed and broad-leaved forest, and also bushes (e.g. Salix) on the tundra and above
the tree limit; in Japan it breeds in mountains up to
2500 m [45-47,52]. A recent paper [53] analysed mitochondrial ND2 sequence variation across a large part of
the species’ continental range (but not including Japan),
and found little divergence, except between Kamchatka/
Sakhalin and the rest of the range, concordant with
results from several other studies on other species as
noted above [22]. The same study [53] also found the
haplotypes from northeast Siberia and Alaska to form a
clade separated from the haplotypes from south Siberia
to northeast Europe. Moreover, the nucleotide diversity
was highest in south Siberia/northeast Europe and lowest in Alaska, with northeast Siberia having intermediate
values. It was concluded that the direction of postglacial
colonization was likely from south Siberia towards the

northwest and northeast, with Alaska being colonized in
a stepping-stone pattern.
In this paper, we conduct a more extensive analysis of
variation in mitochondrial DNA (1-3.2 kbp) from 18
populations of the Arctic Warbler from across the species’ range, including denser sampling from the previously poorly sampled Kamchatka and Sakhalin and the
formerly unsampled Japan, in order to examine: (1) the
phylogeographic structure compared with other boreal
species, with the specific hypothesis that the Eastern
Palearctic/Northwesternmost Nearctic populations
might show deep divergences as a result of long-time
survival in a region which has been less affected by ice
during the Pleistocene than other parts of the Holarctic;
(2) whether the genetic diversity is high throughout this
part of the range, as in many species inhabiting unglaciated temperate refugial regions in Europe and North
America; and (3) whether latitudinal trends in genetic
diversity and signs of population expansions are lacking,
unlike in European and North American species inhabiting formerly glaciated areas.

Results
Phylogeny and divergence times

Forty-two cytochrome b haplotypes were identified
among the 113 individuals from 18 populations (Table
1, Additional file 1) based on 99 polymorphic sites (91
transitions, 8 transversions). According to the AMOVA,
3.2% of the variance is attributable to within-population
variation and 96.8% to among-population variation.
In the cytochrome b tree comprising all samples (Fig. 2)
the Arctic Warbler is divided into three main, strongly
supported clades (A, B and C). These represent separate
geographical locations: clade A - Alaska and mainland
Eurasia (except Kamchatka); clade B - Kamchatka,
Sakhalin and Hokkaido; and clade C - Honshu, Shikoku
and Kyushu (cf. Fig. 1). In the BEAST and bootstrap
analyses, clades A and B are inferred to be sisters,
although with low support (Fig. 2), whereas in the
MrBayes analysis (not shown) clades A and C are
inferred to be sisters, although with effectively no support (0.55). Within clades A, B and C there is no correlation between the inferred relationships of the
sequences and their geographical locations, except that
the sequences from northeast Siberia and Alaska form a
well supported clade both in the BEAST (Fig. 2) and
MrBayes analyses (0.93; not shown) (but with insignificant support in the bootstrap analyses).
In the tree estimated from the concatenated ND5cytochrome b-control region-ND6-12S-tRNA sequences
(Fig. 3) the samples representing clades A and B are
recovered as sisters, with 100% parsimony and maximum likelihood bootstrap support and somewhat lower
posterior probability.

Figure 1 Distribution of the Arctic Warbler Phylloscopus borealis. Map based on [46], with the ranges of the subspecies according to [49]
(Sakhalin population not studied by [49], but thought to belong to examinandus). The sampling sites are marked, with the sample sizes
indicated by numbers. Blue circles represent clade A, yellow circles clade B, and red circles clade C.

The estimated ages of the main clades differ among
the analyses. In the analyses with a fixed clock rate of
2.1% per million years (MY) the mean age of the split
between clades A/B and C is inferred to be 2.5 or 3.0
MY, i.e. in the early Pleistocene or late Pliocene, respectively, and between clades A and B 1.9 or 2.3 MY, i.e. in
the early Pleistocene (Table 2, Figs. 2, 5). The analyses
employing a lognormal uncorrelated relaxed clock with
a fixed mean rate result in ages with large differences in
means (A/B-C: 2.1 and 3.6 MY, respectively) and confidence intervals of up to 4.4 MY (not shown). We conclude that a relaxed clock prior is unsuitable for our
data in the absence of independent information, such as
fossils, that can help us define a strong prior on the
time to most recent common ancestor.
The estimated mean ages of the deepest splits within
clades A, B and C are approximately 0.17-0.28 MYA
(Fig. 2), although most divergences are much shallower
(and many haplotypes are identical).
Population genetics and demography

Within each clade, some populations share haplotypes:
e.g., haplotype A3 is found in Alaska and Magadan
(clade A); haplotypes B1 and B2 in Kamchatka and
Sakhalin, B3 in Kamchatka and Hokkaido, and B7 in
Sakhalin and Hokkaido (clade B); and haplotypes C1 in
Iwate, Yamanashi, Shizuoka and Ehime (clade C) (Table
1). Haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π)
are shown in Table 3. Overall haplotype diversity (0.921)
and nucleotide diversity (2.97%) are high. However,

within the three main clades the mean diversity estimates are lower, especially the nucleotide diversity (h:
clade A, 0.887; clade B, 0.818; clade C, 0.687; π: clade A,
0.29%; clade B, 0.15%; clade C, 0.10%), and the differences among clades A-C are not significant (ANOVA:h,
F = 0.65, p = 0.54; π, F = 0.25, p = 0.78). There are no
latitudinal trends in haplotype and nucleotide diversity
within the three main clades (h, Spearman rank correlation: clade A, rs = -0.5, n = 3, p = 1.00; clade B, rs =
1.0, n = 3, p = 0.33; clade C, rs = -0.77, n = 6, p = 0.10;
π, Spearman rank correlation: clade A, rs = 0.5, n = 3,
p = 1.00; clade B, rs = 1.0, n = 3, p = 0.33; clade C,
rs = -0.6, n = 6, p = 0.35; Fig. 4). However, diversity
estimates in peripheral populations within the main
clades are relatively low (Alaska, clade A; Hokkaido,
clade B; Iwate, clade C; Table 3).
The pairwise Fst values for the localities for which our
sample sizes are ≥7 are shown in Table 4. Fst values are
higher between clades A, B and C (0.946-0.998) than
within these main clades (0.166-0.703). The highest
value is between Hokkaido (clade B) and Iwate (clade
C), which are only approximately 600 km apart. The Fst
value between Alaska and Magadan is 0.499, and significantly different, despite the sharing of one haplotype.
Combining samples from localities with small sample
sizes with geographically adjacent localities (e.g. west
and central Siberia or Anadyr and Magadan) yield very
similar results.
The Tajima’s D values of all three major clades are
negative (Table 3), which suggests sudden population

In addition, Fu’s Fs are negative, with significant pvalues for all three main clades (Table 3), again suggesting past population expansions.

Discussion
Phylogeny, divergence times and comparison with North
America

The three main clades are highly divergent and well
supported, and are estimated to have diverged around
the Pliocene/Pleistocene border. The combined
sequence data provide reasonably strong support for a
sister relationship between the two northerly distributed
clades (A and B).

Weir & Schluter [7] found, based on an extensive survey of New World species, that 100% of boreal North
American members of superspecies coalesced during the
Pleistocene, in contrast to 56% of sub-boreal and 46% of
tropical superspecies. A similar latitudinal trend of
divergence times has been found in North American
fishes: clades occupying formerly glaciated areas are
generally of Pleistocene origin [54,55], whereas more

southerly distributed clades usually predate the Pleistocene [56]. The separation of the three main Arctic Warbler clades in the Pliocene or early Pleistocene is older
than the divergences of closely related species from formerly ice-covered boreal regions of North America, but
in agreement with species pairs from temperate North
American and Neotropical regions [7] (Fig. 5) (note that
[7] used different limits of the Pleistocene than done
here, see Fig. 5).
Several other studies suggest that sister species of boreal Eastern Palearctic forest birds might be on average
older than their New World counterparts. Boreal Eastern Palearctic sister species of Phylloscopus warblers are
estimated to have diverged between mid-Pliocene and

that most Palearctic thrush Turdus spp. sister species,
several of which have boreal Eastern Palearctic distributions, separated in the mid to late Pleistocene (although
the Southeast Palearctic T. mupinensis was inferred to
have separated from a common ancestor with an African species during the early Pliocene).
The generally older ages of boreal sister species in the
Eastern Palearctic than in North America could be due
to lower recent speciation rates or lower extinction rates
in the Eastern Palearctic (or a combination). Weir &
Schluter [7] concluded that the fragmentation of forests
by ice sheets during the Pleistocene was the main cause
of the elevated rates of diversification of forest birds in
boreal regions compared to sub-boreal and tropical New
World regions. It is possible that forest habitats were
less fragmented in the Eastern Palearctic than in North
America during the Pleistocene (but see below), causing
less subdivision of forest bird populations and hence
less divergence. Alternatively, the less severe conditions
in the Eastern Palearctic than in northern North America, e.g. [12-14,63] might have facilitated long-term survival of already separated lineages.
Distributional patterns

mid-Pleistocene [57]. The widely distributed boreal
Parus montanus separated from the Eastern Palearctic
Parus affinis around the Pliocene-Pleistocene border
[58]. In a clade of boreal mainly Eastern Palearctic
Emberiza buntings, uncorrected cytochrome b divergences are 5.1-8.3% [59], indicating separation during
the Pliocene (assuming 2.1% divergence per million
years; [60]). Two species of Erithacus robins, one endemic to Japan and one occurring in Japan and on Sakhalin, are estimated to have separated from their mainland
relatives 1.5-5.2 Mya, during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene [61]. In contrast, Nylander et al. [62] inferred

The three major Arctic Warbler lineages have apparently maintained their integrity through several successive glaciations, with little or no mixing, despite likely
shifts and contractions of their breeding ranges and
shared winter distributions. The divergence between
clade C and the common ancestor of clades A and B is
here postulated to have occurred between 2.5 and 3.0
mya. This coincides with the climate crash associated
with the final closure of the Panama Isthmus at 2.7
MYA. Northern Hemisphere ice sheets expanded, and
there was a global tendency toward a more arid climate,
causing among other things decreasing and fragmented
forest cover [64-66]. During the last glacial maximum,
14 000-26 000 years ago, the northwesternmost part of
the present range of the Arctic Warbler was glaciated,
while the rest of northern Eurasia and northwesternmost North America was arid and tree-less, with polar
desert or steppe-tundra conditions at least in higher-elevation areas, e.g. [12-14,63,67]. Parts of China and Japan
are believed to have been forested [68-75]. Accordingly,
the conditions were probably unsuitable for Arctic Warblers in much of its current range. However, since the
Arctic Warbler can thrive in scrub on tundra further
north than practically all other warblers [45-47,52], it is
possible that it could have occurred at least locally
within part of its present range. It seems probable that
it could have remained in Japan throughout the glacial
periods. Based on the current breeding distributions and
the fact that all Arctic Warblers winter in Southeast
Asia, the Philippines and Indonesia [45], it seems likely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/35

that all three major lineages have survived the glaciations in eastern Asia. Reeves et al. [53] found evidence
of gene flow in continental Eurasian/Alaskan populations of Arctic Warblers (corresponding to clade A of
the present study) from south Siberia towards the northwest and northeast, and concluded that this pattern
probably indicates the routes of postglacial expansion.
Although we do not know for sure in which areas the
three Arctic Warbler clades diverged, the combined
sequence data strongly suggest that first a lineage comprising the two northern clades (A and B) separated
from a common ancestor with the southern clade (C),
whose distribution probably included Japan, and later
the two northern clades separated from each other. This
scenario makes sense also from a geographical point of
view, since the ancestry of the clade including the Arctic
Warbler is inferred to have been somewhat further
south [57]. The very short internode leading up to the
clade comprising A and B indicates that all three
lineages separated close in time. A similar “simultaneous” burst of lineage splittings has been suggested for
a clade of mainly Eastern Palearctic boreal Emberiza
buntings [59].
Several species groups and phylogroups of birds and
mammals have distributional patterns that agree fairly
well with that of the Arctic Warbler, suggesting that
geographical barriers leading to vicariant divergence of
populations have existed in the past between, on the
one hand, much of the northern Palearctic and, on the
other hand, Russian Far East (including Sakhalin and
southern Kamchatka) and Japan, and on a finer scale
within the latter area, between Sakhalin/southern Kamchatka/Hokkaido and the rest of Japan. Some of these
divergences may have been caused by Pleistocene climatic oscillations, while others are apparently older and
must have other causes. The importance of the Tsugaru
strait, “Blakiston’s line”, between Hokkaido and Honshu
as a biogeographic division line in various taxa of animals and plants has been stressed by [76-78]. Several of
the birds breeding in Japan and, in some cases, also on
Sakhalin and southern Kamchatka have their closest
relatives in the boreal forests on the mainland
[29,57,59,61,62,79]. Three of these (Emberiza variabilis,
Locustella amnicola and Phylloscopus borealoides) differ
from their respective sister species by c. 3.4-4.4% in
cytochrome b (uncorrected p; P. Alström & U. Olsson,
unpublished). This is similar to the differences among
the three main Arctic Warbler clades (3.8-5.1%, uncorrected p), suggesting common causes of their divergences. In addition, several bird and mammal species
show relatively deep divergences between a clade covering much of the northern Palearctic and a clade from
the Russian Far East (sometimes including Sakhalin and
southern Kamchatka) and in some cases Japan

Page 8 of 13

[22,23,28,33,34]. However, these divergences are of more
recent origin than the Arctic Warbler clades, and probably all date to the Pleistocene.
Despite apparent historical range shifs, it is possible
that the three main Arctic Warbler clades have diverged
in complete geographical isolation. There is presently no
known geographical overlap between them, although the
parts of Kamchatka and continental Russian Far East
where this might occur are unsampled. The present
study indicates significant divergence between some
geographically closely situated localities within the main
clades, even in the absence of apparent geographical
barriers. Reeves et al. [53] also reported significant isolation-by-distance in Arctic Warblers in continental Eurasia/Alaska. Presumably, the natal philopatry is strong
and the innate migration routes strictly adhered to,
which has been suggested to be at least part of the
explanation for the maintenance of geographically
neighbouring clades in the boreal migratory Willow
Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus [80], Greenish Warbler
Phylloscous trochiloides complex [81] and Dunlin Calidris alpina [25].
Population expansions

Within each of the three main clades, the nucleotide
diversity is low (mean π = 0.10-0.29%), especially in the
marginal populations from Iwate (clade C), Hokkaido
(clade B) and Alaska (clade A) (π = 0.010-0.066), and
neutrality tests indicate sudden population expansion in
each of these clades. These results suggest that each
clade has suffered from past bottlenecks, and that the
range of each of them has expanded in more recent
times. There is observational data supporting recent
expansion in at least one area: the Arctic Warbler was
only recently confirmed to breed in Hokkaido, on the
Shiretoko peninsula [82]. Reeves et al. [53] also found
evidence of population expansion in Arctic Warblers in
northeast Siberia/Alaska, while they inferred more stable
populations in south and west Siberia and north Europe.
Although they did not find any signature of population
expansion in the west Siberian and European populations, these populations must have expanded their
ranges considerably during the Holocene, since their
present breeding areas were coverd by ice during the
latest glaciation. Reeves et al. [53] further deduced that
Beringia was likely colonized in two steps, first from
south Siberia to northeast Russia and then, after a delay,
across the Bering Strait to Alaska.
A similar pattern of post-Pleistocene population
expansion has been found in another forest bird, the
Great Tit Parus major complex. The northern major
(Europe to northern Russian Far East) and eastern
minor (China, Japan, Korean pensinsula, southern Russian Far East) groups show signs of population

Saitoh et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/35

expansion, unlike the Central Asian bokharensis and
South Asian cinereus groups [32]. It is most likely that
the northern major group was forced to retreat south to
escape from the advancing ice during the glacial periods,
and that at the same time the east Asian minor group
probably also had to reduce its range due to habitat
changes resulting from the colder and drier climate. Evidence of population expansion has been found in several
other widely distributed boreal forest taxa, including
seven more birds, two rodents, a flying squirrel, a newt
and two ants (reviewed in [22,26]).
The results suggest that although the Eastern Palearctic may have been almost free of ice during the Pleistocene, population bottlenecks and subsequent expansions
have nevertheless occurred in that region because of forest dynamics.

Conclusions
The three Arctic Warbler clades are estimated to have
diverged in close succession during the latter part of the
Pliocene to early part of the Pleistocene, and although
all of them experienced population bottlenecks during
the Pleistocene, they nevertheless survived and maintained their respective integrity. Suitable breeding habitats likely existed in east Asia, probably at least partly
within the present breeding ranges of these lineages, e.g.
Japan. Several other clades of Northeastern Palearctic
forest birds are noted to have diversified in the late Pliocene. This pattern differs from that of North American
boreal forest clades that occur on formerly glaciated
ground, and which are generally of Pleistocene origin.
The differences between these regions could be due to
slower speciation rates in the Eastern Palearctic due to
less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer survival of Eastern Palearctic clades as
a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern North America. Several other Palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns
to that of the Arctic Warbler, indicating common causes
of their diversifications.
Methods
Sampling and laboratory methods

A total of 113 Arctic Warbler samples were obtained
during the breeding season from 18 localities across the
entire breeding range (Fig. 1, Additional file 1). Samples
were also obtained from two of the closest relatives of
Arctic Warbler, Large-billed Leaf Warbler P. magnirostris and Sakhalin Leaf Warbler P. borealoides, as well as
two more distantly related Phylloscopus species, Twobarred Warbler P. plumbeitarsus and Eastern Crowned
Warbler P. coronatus [57,79].
Total DNA from blood or pectoral muscle were
extracted using the standard phenol-chloroform

Page 9 of 13

procedure. For each individual, partial mitochondrial
cytochrome b (1012 bp) was amplified with primers mtF (H16065) [83] and mt-A (L14970) [84]. The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 35 μl using
10 ng of total DNA, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM of each
dNTP, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.5 units Ex-Taq polymerase (Takara). The amplification profile was 94°C for
3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 56°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min and a final extension in 72°C
for 5 min, using Takara PCR Thermal Cycler MP
(Takara).
For one or two individuals from each of the three
main cytochrome b clades (see Results) and the two
outgroup taxa we also amplified part of the mitochondrial ND5 gene (964 bp), and a sequence comprising
part of the mitochondrial control region, tRNA-pro
gene, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) gene,
tRNA-Glu and tRNA-Phe genes, and part of the 12S
rRNA gene (hereafter CR-ND6-12S-tRNA; 1232 bp
excluding gaps in the alignment). For ND5, we used primers mt-F [83] and L14080ND5P, 5’-TCAACYCAYGCMTTCTTCAAAGC-3’ (modified from [85]),
which amplifies approximately 2 kbp (ND5 and cytochrome b), and the amplification profile was 94°C for 3
min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 53°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 1.5 min and a final extension in
72°C for 5 min. The CR-ND6-12S-tRNA region was
amplified using primers, DLL3, 5’-TGATGCACTTTGACCCCATTCATGG-3’ and 12SH2, 5’-AGCAACAAC
CAACGGTAAG-3’ and amplification profile [86]. The
PCR cycling parameters were 2.5 min at 95°C; 40 cycles
of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C; terminated by 7 min at 72°C, and a 4°C soak. PCR products
were purified using ExoSAP-IT (Amersham Bioscience).
Sequencing reactions were performed with the primers
L14080ND5P, mt-A and mt-F with BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing FS Kit v.3.1 and run with ABI 3100Avant sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For some samples, products were purified using EZNA cycle pure kit
(Omega bio-tek), and sequencing performed by Macrogen Inc., Seoul, South Korea, using the primers DLL3,
12SH2 and DLLF2. The sequences were checked to
make sure that coding regions contained no stop
codons.
Data analyses

The sequences were aligned by eye with ATGC v. 4.0.8
and GENETYX-MAC v.10.1 (GENETYX).
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using BEAST version
1.5.2 [87,88]. Xml files for analysis in BEAST were generated in BEAUti version 1.5.2 [89] using a GTR+Γ
model and fixed clock rate of 0.0105 (corresponding to
1.05%/MY/lineage: [60]). A coalescent expansion growth
model was used in analyses comprising all sequences of

Saitoh et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/35

Arctic Warblers, including identical haplotypes (as suggested at http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/FAQ#Should_I_remove_identical_sequences.3F), but no outgroups. A birthdeath model was used for datasets including one
sequence per main clade in the Arctic Warbler complex
(as revealed by other analyses) and outgroups. The data
were also analysed employing a lognormal uncorrelated
relaxed clock [90] with a fixed mean rate of 0.0105 per
lineage/MY [60]. Default priors were used. 40 × 10 6
generations were run, sampled every 1000 generation.
The MCMC output was analysed in Tracer version 1.4.1
[91] to evaluate whether valid estimates of the posterior
distribution of the parameters had been obtained. The
first 25% of the generations were discarded as “burn-in”,
well after stationarity of chain likelihood values had
been established. Trees were summarized using TreeAnnotator version 1.5.2 [92], choosing “Maximum clade
credibility tree” and “Mean heights”, and displayed in
FigTree version 1.2.3 [93]. Only the cytochrome b dataset was analysed in BEAST.
Phylogenetic trees were also constructed by Bayesian
inference using the program MrBayes 3.1.2 [94]. Appropriate substitution models were determined based on
the Akaike Information Criterion [95] and a hierarchical
likelihood ratio test [96], both calculated using MrModeltest2 [97] in conjunction with PAUP* [98]. The
selected model for cytochrome b was a general timereversible (GTR) model [99-101] with an estimated proportion of invariant sites (I; [102]) (GTR+I), and for the
concatenated ND5, cytochrome b, CR-ND6-12S-tRNA
sequences the HKY model [103] with an estimated proportion of invariant sites (I; [102] (HKY + I). Default
priors were used. Four Metropolis-coupled MCMC
chains were run for 20 × 106 generations, and sampled
every 1000 generations; the heating temperature was set
to 0.1. Two independent analyses were run simultaneously, starting from random trees (per default). The
first 25% of the generations were discarded as “burn-in”,
well after stationarity of chain likelihood values had
been established by inspection in Tracer 1.4.1 [91] as
well as in the MrBayes summary of parameters, and the
posterior probability was estimated for the remaining
generations. The samples from the stationary phases of
the independent runs were pooled to obtain the final
results.
Parsimony (MP) bootstrapping was performed in
PAUP* [98]: heuristic search strategy, 1000 replicates,
starting trees obtained by stepwise addition (random
addition sequence, 10 replicates), TBR branch swapping.
Maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrapping (1000 replicates) was performed in Treefinder [104,105] using
default settings and the same models as in MrBayes.
For the cytochrome b data, haplotype diversity (h;
[106], nucleotide diversity (π; [106], number of

Page 10 of 13

segregating (polymorphic) sites per nucleotide (θ; [107]),
pairwise Fst [108], and analyses of molecular variance
(AMOVA; [109]) were calculated with Arlequin version
3.0 [110] for all individuals.
