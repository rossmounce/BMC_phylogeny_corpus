Abstract
Background: The analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates of DNA change can help in
the choice among competing explanations for rate variation, such as differences in constraint,
mutation rate, or the strength of genetic drift. Nonphotosynthetic plants of the Orobanchaceae
have increased rates of DNA change. In this study 38 taxa of Orobanchaceae and relatives were
used and 3 plastid genes were sequenced for each taxon.
Results: Phylogenetic reconstructions of relative rates of sequence evolution for three plastid
genes (rbcL, matK and rps2) show significant rate heterogeneity among lineages and among genes.
Many of the non-photosynthetic plants have increases in both synonymous and nonsynonymous
rates, indicating that both (1) selection is relaxed, and (2) there has been a change in the rate at
which mutations are entering the population in these species. However, rate increases are not
always immediate upon loss of photosynthesis. Overall there is a poor correlation of synonymous
and nonsynonymous rates. There is, however, a strong correlation of synonymous rates across the
3 genes studied and the lineage-speccific pattern for each gene is strikingly similar. This indicates
that the causes of synonymous rate variation are affecting the whole plastid genome in a similar
way. There is a weaker correlation across genes for nonsynonymous rates. Here the picture is
more complex, as could be expected if there are many causes of variation, differing from taxon to
taxon and gene to gene.
Conclusions: The distinctive pattern of rate increases in Orobanchaceae has at least two causes.
It is clear that there is a relaxation of constraint in many (though not all) non-photosynthetic
lineages. However, there is also some force affecting synonymous sites as well. At this point, it is
not possible to tell whether it is generation time, speciation rate, mutation rate, DNA repair
efficiency or some combination of these factors.

Background
Rates of DNA sequence evolution vary among taxa and
among genes, and the causes of this variation are many. In
some cases, generation time has been shown to be correlated with rates in plants. For example, annual plants can

sometimes have higher rates of DNA evolution than perennials [1]. In one study, it was shown that long-lived
woody grasses exhibit slower rates than short-lived herbaceous ones [2]. However, a more extensive set of 33

phylogenetically independent comparisons failed to find
a generation time effect for plants in general [3].
A useful method for distinguishing among the potential
causes of rate variation is to separately examine nonsynonymous rates (rN) and synonymous rates (rS). For example, when rN increases relative to rS, relaxation of purifying
selection is a possible explanation. However, when rS
increases, but the rN/rS ratio is not greatly affected, then an
increase in the mutation rate is a possibility. An example
of this is Plantago mitochondrial DNA [4]. However, a
decrease in DNA repair efficiency could also explain such
a change. In addition, population processes, such as
genetic drift could play a role. Reduced effective population size (Ne) can increase the fixation rate of neutral and
slightly deleterious mutations. Thus, if slightly deleterious
mutations are common, both rS and rN are expected to be
higher when Ne is low [5,6].

accelerated (or even lost) in Epifagus or related parasitic
plants. Although plastid encoded, the three genes encode
proteins that participate in different processes in the plastid. rps2 encodes the ribosomal protein S2 in small subunit ribosome, matK is an intron maturase, and rbcL
encodes the large subunit in the CO2-fixing enzyme
RUBISCO. We ask several questions: When does the rate
increase observed in Epifagus begin, relative to the evolutionary loss of photosynthesis? What are the causes?
Relaxation of constraint? More mutations entering the
population? Are these patterns consistent across multiple
plastid genes?

Results

One expectation of this drift-based hypothesis is that rN
will vary from protein to protein, as each protein will have
different functional constraints and thus a different proportion of slightly deleterious mutations. In contrast, rS is
expected to be similar among proteins when the cause is a
change in mutation rate or repair efficiency[7].

Phylogenies of the Orobanchaceae and relatives were constructed using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum
likelihood (ML). The MP analysis discovered four most
parsimonious trees of 3817 steps, with CI = 0.6275, CI
(excluding uninformative characters) = 0.5118, and RC =
0.3888. The strict consensus tree was unresolved as to the
position of Schwalbea relative to the Alectra-Orobanche
clade, the Bartsia-Melampyrum clade and the CastillejaPedicularis clade. It was also unresolved concerning the
relationships among the outgroups Mimulus, Kigelia, Hemimeris, Verbascum, Antirrhinum and Veronica.

During founder-effect speciation, genetic drift can be
expected to increase the substitution rate, even at silent
sites. This has been called the speciation-rate hypothesis
[8]. For example, speciation rate has been used to explain
the difference in non-coding DNA substitution rates
between the sister genera Utricularia and Pinguicula in the
plant family Lentibulariaceae [9].

The ML analysis found two trees, with -ln likelihood values of 24525.88663. The strict consensus of these trees
was unresolved, but in a different place, regarding the
position of the Cistanche-Epifagus clade. When the MP
consensus and the ML consensus were combined into a
semistrict consensus tree, a completely resolved tree
resulted. This tree is shown in Fig. 1.

Rates can also vary if the underlying mutation rate varies
[10,11] or if DNA repair is impaired [12,13]. Although
rates themselves are hard to measure, the number of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions
can be measured and are used to compare rates and calculate rate ratios.

All three gene trees exhibited statistically significant rate
heterogeneity (p < 0.0005), as assessed by the KishinoHasegawa (K-H) test [19]. Synonymous and nonsynonymous branch lengths for each of the three genes are shown
reconstructed in Fig. 2.

Epifagus virginiana, a nonphotosynthetic plant, has an
increased rate of sequence evolution for plastid DNA in
general [14-17] and relative rates tests of the plastid rps2
gene indicate a significant increase for both dN and dS. This
suggests that purifying selection is at least partially relaxed
and that there has been an increase in the rate at which
mutations are entering the population in this species, due
to increased mutation rate or lax DNA repair. MatK,
another plastid gene, is characterized by a partial relaxation of purifying selection in the clade containing Epifagus, Orobanche and Boschniakia [18]. In this paper, we
explore rate variation in E. virginiana and 38 of its relatives
for three plastid genes: rps2, matK, and rbcL. Each of these
genes is present in photosynthetic relatives of Epifagus, is

The correlation analyses show that there is a higher correlation of synonymous evolution across genes than nonsynonymous evolution (Fig. 3). They also show that
within rps2 and rbcL synonymous and nonsynonymous
evolution is poorly correlated, but in matK, the correlation
is better (Fig. 4).
Some of the non-photosynthetic plants, (Epifagus, Cistanche, and the Orobanche species) have increases in both
synonymous and nonsynonymous rates. Rates are not,
however, increased in Boschniakia, Harveya, Hyobanche,
Lathaea, Alectra orobanchoides, and Striga gesnerioides.
Synonymous rates vary markedly among taxa. For example, the branches leading to Epifagus are at least two or

three times as long as those for most of the photosynthetic
taxa. Despite this among-taxon variation, the pattern for
each gene is strikingly similar (Fig. 2D, E, F). For example,
sister taxa (e.g. Veronica and Antirrhinum, Euphrasia and
Panetucellia/Tozzia, Epifagus and Cistanche, O. fasciculata
and O. corymbosa) usually show an identical pattern of
who is faster than whom. This indicates that the causes of
synonymous rate variation are affecting the whole plastid
genome in a similar way.
There is even more extensive variation in nonsynonymous
rates, both among taxa and among genes. This is not surprising because these genes have different functions and
some of the taxa are photosynthetic while others are not.

The scale bars in Figs. 2A, B, and 2C show the overall differences in nonsynonymous rates. MatK is much more
rapidly evolving than the other two genes for nearly all
taxa, but Epifagus' rbcL pseudogene has a similar rate.
When looking at taxa across genes, there is much less consistency than with the synonymous rates. There are some
big differences, such as the branch lengths for Striga, Cycnium and Schwalbea, and the Euphrasia species. Overall the
picture is more complex, as could be expected if there are
many causes of variation, differing from taxon to taxon
and gene to gene.
The pattern of matK rate variation is very similar in the
synonymous and nonsynonymous figures. This fits well

Rates were compared by using two categories at a time and
testing for significant differences using likelihood ratio
tests. These tests are summarized in Table 2. In general, it
was found that the nonphotosynthetic plants have higher
synonymous and nonsynonymous rates of change,
although when tested separately, it was found that Harveya, Hyobanche and Boschniakia do not have higher synonymous rates.

Purifying selection is relaxed in the nonphotosynthetic
plants for all three genes. The test values are as follows.
matK: 2ÃLR = 10.67, df = 1, p = 0.001; rbcL: 2ÃLR = 31.3,
df = 1, p = 2.2 Ã 10-8; rps2: 2ÃLR = 8.56, df = 1, p =
0.00343.
Another way to describe the difference in the pattern of
synonymous and non-synonymous rates is to say that the
former are more correlated across genes. This can be seen
in Fig. 3, which shows plots comparing two genes at a
time. In comparisons including rbcL nonsynonymous
rates, the data point from the Epifagus pseudogene has
been excluded. Its unconstrained evolution is not typical
of "nonsynonymous" change and its position on the plot
made it an extreme outlier with an enormous influence on
the regression line.

For rps2 and rbcL, the synonymous plots are more highly
correlated, whereas for matK, which is relatively unconstrained, they are about the same.

with the fact that it is less constrained overall, as can be
seen by comparing the scale bars in Figs. 2A, B, and 2C.

The dramatic rate increase observed in Epifagus [14], with
branches 5â10 times as long as other taxa, can now be
seen to have begun earlier in the history of the Orobanchaceae. It is shown to be composed of increases in both
synonymous and nonsynomymous rates. The general pattern is that many of the non-photosynthetic plants, such
as Epifagus, Cistanche, and the Orobanche species, have
increases in both synonymous and nonsynonymous rates,
indicating that both (1) selection is relaxed, and (2) there
has been a change in the rate at which mutations are entering the population in these species. However, rate
increases are not immediate upon loss of photosynthesis,
since we do not see increases in Boschniakia, Harveya,
Hyobanche, Lathaea, Alectra orobanchoides, and Striga gesnerioides. This pattern is similar to that found using smaller
data sets [15,20]. Separate analyses of synonymous and
nonsynonymous rates give us some insight into potential
mechanisms.
The speciation rate hypothesis predicts that more speciose
clades should have a faster rs (and therefore larger ds) than
a species-poor sister group. This was suggested as a cause
of rate variation in non-coding DNA in the Lentibulareaceae [9]. In this study, not all genera have been sam-

pled, and those that have are often represented by one or
two species. In addition, some genera may not be monophyletic (for example, Orobanche is not). Thus, accurate
numbers of species cannot be assigned to individual
branches or clades. However, a few things can be noted.
Euphrasia, with ~170 spp., is clearly more speciose than its
sister group, with 3 spp. It has a somewhat faster ds. How-

ever, the Schwalbea lineage, with a single species, has a
fairly high ds. Its position is not certain, but its sister group
is probably the Bartsia â Melampyrum clade (>300 spp.),
the Castilleja â Pedicularis clade, (>700 spp.), or the union
of the two. These groups have do not have dramatically
higher ds values; in fact the Castilleja â Pedicularis clade's
value is slightly lower.

Differences in generation time may play some role in the
observed rate variation. However, as was found previously
[15], the pattern is not clear. Since most of the genera sampled in this study contain both annuals and perennials, it
is likely that most branches on the tree actually represent
a combination of annual and perennial evolutionary history. However, there are some intriguing details that
might merit further study. The clade containing Bartsia,
Euphrasia and Melampyrum contains mostly annuals [21]
and has some high ds values, as one would expect from a
generation time effect. However, both Euphrasia and Melampyrum contain almost exclusively annuals and have very
different rates. Likewise, the large clade containing Boschniakia and Epifagus contains mostly annuals and has an
overall high ds. The perennials Boschniakia and Cistanche
have lower ds than their sister taxa, which also supports
the generation time hypothesis, but there is as much variation among categories (perennial, annual) as between
categories.

Conclusions
The distinctive pattern of rate increases in Orobanchaceae
has at least two causes. It is clear that there is a relaxation
of constraint in many (though not all) non-photosynthetic lineages. However, there is also some force affecting
synonymous sites as well. At this point, it is not possible
to tell whether it is generation time, speciation rate, mutation rate, DNA repair efficiency or some combination of
these factors. Clearly, generating additional data from
nuclear and mitochondrial genes would help us to more
clearly distinguish among these hypotheses. Some of the
above-mentioned hypotheses (generation-time, speciation rate) would be expected to affect nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in a similar fashion, whereas factors
affecting mutation rate or efficiency of DNA repair would
not, as these process involve different, though perhaps
overlapping, sets of enzymes in each of the three genomes
[22-24].

Methods
Sampling
We sampled 15 photosynthetic and 16 nonphotosynthetic Orobanchaceae, and eight outgroup taxa. The specimens used and their GenBank accession numbers are
given in Table 1.
Amplification and sequencing
We amplified and sequenced rps2 as in [15], matK as in
[25], and rbcL as in [26]. A total of 15 new sequences were
generated for this study, including 3 rps2, 7 matK, and 5
rbcL sequences.
Alignment
The rps2 alignment was simple, containing only two small
indels. For matK and rbcL, a search for the best alignment
was conducted using Clustal X and a variety of alignment
parameters. Alignments were evaluated according to the
following optimality criterion: whichever alignment
yields the MP tree(s) with the highest consistency is
considered the best alignment[27]. For alignment assessment, MP analyses with and without indel characters were
used. When used, indel characters were generated with the
program GapCoder [28](available from http://
www.tufts.edu/vet/richlab/young/GapCoder), which uses
the simple indel coding method of Simmons and Ochoterena [29]. The rescaled consistency (RC) index [30] of the
resulting parsimony analyses was used to assess alignment
optimality, with one exception: very low gap opening
penalties (GOP), such as 3 or less were excluded. These
low GOP values lead to inflated RC values, due to the
large numbers of gaps, which reduce the treelength and
the homoplasy. rps2 had just one small indel and was
aligned by eye. For matK, the optimal computer alignment
was generated using GOP = 5 and gap extension penalty
(GEP) = 1. Transitions were weighed the same as transitions. The RC from the analysis with indel characters
included was 0.3693. The RC without indel characters was
0.3759. The alignment was then adjusted by eye. This
final alignment yielded RC values of 0.3878 (indel characters included) and 0.3763 (indel characters excluded).

For rbcL, the optimal computer alignment was generated
using GOP = 5 GEP = 3. Transitions were weighed the
same as transitions. The RC from the analysis with indel
characters included was 0.4679. The RC without indel
characters was 0.4437. The alignment was then adjusted
by eye. This final alignment yielded RC values of 0.4635
(indel characters included) and 0.4499 (indel characters
excluded).

been synonymous and nonsynonymous are now expected
at equal rates. Thus, by including these sequences in the
tests, we get additional evidence that constraint is relaxed
in nonphotosynthetic plants. Therefore, even for the pseudogenes, we have still calculated the synonymous and
nonsynonymous rates separately, assuming a reading
frame based on alignment to the other genes in the data
set, and have indicated the pseudogenes in Fig. 2C.

Phylogenetic analyses
For rps2, positions homologous to positions 48â660 of
the Nicotiana gene were used. For matK, the entire gene
was used. For rbcL, positions homologous to Nicotiana
gene positions 5â1325 were used. The three genes were
then combined into a single data set. PAUP* 4.0b8 [31]
was used to conduct a MP heuristic search, including indel
characters, and using Nicotiana tabacum as the outgroup
taxon, TBR branch swapping and 100 random addition
replicates. Bootstrap analyses were conducted with the
same settings, except with only 40 random addition
orders. 500 bootstrap replicates were performed.

Rate increases were compared among categories of taxa
(such as photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic), using
dN, dS, and the dN/dS ratio (Ï) in likelihood ratio tests [36].
These tests were conducted using HYPHY and the category
assignments of the branches are those shown in Figure 1.
In addition, a previous study [15] indicated that some
nonphotosynthetic branches might not have rate
increases. Thus, two subsets of the nonphotosynthetic
branches were tested: (1) Orobanche, Epifagus and Cistanche branches and (2) Harveya, Hyobanche and Boschniakia branches. Each of these tests used the data set from a
single gene and compared two nested hypotheses: H1: the
photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic branches share a
single value (for one of the parameters dN, dS or Ï). H2: the
photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic branches have
two separate values. If the tree has a significantly higher
likelihood under H2, that is taken as evidence that the
nonphotosynthetic branches have higher rates. Scatter
plots and correlation tests were used to examine the
degree of correlation between synonymous and nonsynonymous sites within a gene, and also to see if either class
of sites was correlated between genes.

ML analyses excluded indels. Using the hLRT method of
the program ModelTest 3.06 [32], the ML model of
GTR+G was selected as the best evolutionary model for
the combined data set. Base frequencies (A = .298, C =
.177, G = .203) and substitution rates (A-C = 1.51, A-G =
2.11, A-T = 0.264, C-G = 0.788, C-T = 2.62, G-T = 1) were
obtained from the MP trees. Among-site variation was
included in the model, based on a gamma distribution
with four categories. A heuristic search was conducted,
similar to the MP search, but with only 10 random addition replicates, each limited to the examination of 5000
rearrangements.
Rates of DNA change
Overall rate heterogeneity was assessed using the K-H test
as implemented in PAUP, using the same ML analyses,
except that the starting tree was a neighbor-joining tree
and the analysis was limited to 40 rearrangements. Nonsysnonymous and synonymous changes were reconstructed on branches using the codon-based likelihood
model of Muse and Gaut [33], as implemented in HYPHY
for MacOS, ver. 0.95 beta [[34] 2004], available at http://
www.hyphy.org. At least nine of the rbcL "genes" are
probably pseudogenes. These are indicated in Figure 2C.
Seven of these have already been discussed elsewhere
[20]. The Orobanche caryophyllaceae and Cistanche phelypaea "genes" have internal stop codons and thus are probably also pseudogenes. There may also be other
pseudogenes with intact ORFs, making their pseudogene
status less obvious [35]. Once a pseudogene is formed, it
is no longer constrained for a protein function, so synonymous and nonsynonymous changes can no longer be
formally defined. Moreover, changes that would have
