Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene
for identification of clinically relevant species of
the genus Streptococcus
Devi Lal, Mansi Verma and Rup Lal*

Abstract
Background: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus
are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to
distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that
can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinicallyrelevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus.
Methods: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae,
S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed
with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to
identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis.
Results: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus
level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43
uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach.
Conclusions: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further
used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
Keywords: phylogenetic framework, signature sequences, genetic heterogeneity

Background
The genus Streptococcus consists of spherical Gram
positive bacteria belonging to the class Bacilli and the
order Lactobacillales [1]. The group is large and comprises of numerous clinically significant species which
are responsible for wide variety of infections in human
and animals. Streptococcus of different groups are
known to cause human diseases, some species being
highly virulent and responsible for major diseases. Species like S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae
are important as they cause serious acute infections in
man, but several other species are also involved in a
number of diseases like infective endocarditis, abscesses
and other pathological conditions [2]. Various species of

Streptococcus are known to be associated with infections
of cattles, pigs, horses, sheeps, birds, aquatic mammals
and fishes [3]. The genus has undergone considerable
taxonomic revisions and has been divided into different
groups (pyogenic, anginosus, mitis, mutans, salivarius,
bovis) based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity [4].
Since many species belonging to the genus Streptococcus are associated with various pathological conditions,
different protocols have been used for their identification. Still precise identification of these species is laborious. Clinical laboratories use serological grouping by
Lancefield, haemolytic reactions and phenotypic tests for
identification of various Streptococcus isolates. However,
these Lancefield groups are not species-specific [5,6]
and haemolytic activity differs within species and
depends on incubation procedures. Strains within a
given species may differ for a common trait [7,8] and

even the same strain may exhibit biochemical variability
[9,10].
Various alternatives have been employed for identification of Streptococcus isolates. These include DNA
hybridization [11-14]; rDNA restriction analysis [15-17];
use of 16S-23S rRNA interspacer region [18-21], D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase gene (ddl gene) [22]; autolysin gene
(lytA) [23]; dextranase (dex) [24]; heat shock protein
(groESL) [25,26]; RNA subunit of endoribonuclease P
(rnpB) [27]; the elongation factor Tu (tuf) [28]; gyrase A
(gyrA) and topoisomerase subunit C (parC) [29];
sequence analysis of small subunit rRNA [30]; manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (sodA)
[31,32]; recombination and repair protein (recN) [33];
tDNA PCR fragment length polymorphism [34,35] and
use of multilocus sequencing typing loci [36,37].
16S rRNA gene sequencing has proved to be one of
the most powerful tools for the classification of microorganisms [38] and has been used for identification of
clinically relevant microbes [39,40]. Therefore, molecular
tools based on 16S rRNA gene can be developed and
used for identification. However it is also true that the
correct identification of bacterial species may not be
based on the nucleotide sequence of a single gene. Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) of several housekeeping genes has to be performed. But from practical
standpoint there is need for a simplified approach for
preliminary identification of a species, particularly under
the conditions if the amount of isolated DNA is not
enough for MLSA or it does not react with a complete
set of typing primers. The current work considers the
possibility to use 16S rRNA sequences for this purpose
and is useful for practical applications.Thus the present
study aims to explore internal features of 16S rRNA
gene for preliminary identification of a species that can
supplement the existing methods for identification.
These methods include construction of phylogenetic framework, identification of species-specific signatures and
restriction enzyme analysis.

twelve sets of Streptococcus species occurring with higher
frequency were used as the master species set for generating a phylogenetic framework, species-specific signatures and restriction enzyme analysis.
Phylogenetic Analyses

For phylogenetic analyses, the sequences were aligned
using multiple alignment program CLUSTAL_X [43].
Evolutionary distances between all the sequences were
calculated with DNADIST of the PHYLIP 3.6 package
[44]. The program NEIGHBOR was used to draw neighbor joining [45] tree with Jukes and Cantor correction
[46]. Statistical testing of the trees was done using SEQBOOT by resampling the dataset 1000 times. The trees
were viewed through TreeView Version 1.6.6 [47]. For
each of these 12 Streptococcus species data sets,
sequences that formed a single cluster were aligned and
a consensus was obtained by using JALVIEW sequence
editor [48]. The sequence close to consensus from each
group was chosen as a representative for that particular
group. Based on this, a reference set of 63 sequences
was selected to define the range of genetic variability
present in each of the Streptococcus species.
Specific Signatures

Signatures were identified in each of the species data set
using online MEME program [49]. Sequences of 12
Streptococcus species data sets were submitted groupwise in MEME program Version 4.6.1 http://meme.sdsc.
edu/meme4_6_1/cgi-bin/meme.cgi. In order to obtain
maximum number of motifs the default setting was
modified from 3 motifs to 20 motifs. The default value
of motif widths was also modified and re-set between 25
and 50. Each of the 20 signatures was checked for its
frequency of occurrence among a particular Streptococcus sp. The signatures which did not appear in other
Streptococcus spp. were considered as unique. BLAST
search against NCBI database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/ was carried out for these signatures to check their
uniqueness.

Methods
Sequence data

Restriction enzyme analysis

16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the genus Streptococcus from RDP database http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/[41]
were analysed in the present study. These included the
sequences with relatively high number of identified
organisms (86 sequences belonging to isolates of S. dysgalactiae, 61 to S. equi, 61 to S. pyogenes, 29 to S.agalactiae, 31 S. bovis-equinus (S. bovis and S. equinus are
considered to be a single species [42]), 76 to S. gallolyticus, 102 to S. mutans, 23 to S.sobrinus, 28 to S. mitis, 41
to S. pneumoniae, 73 to S. thermophilus, 32 to S. anginosus) and 63 sequences of uncharacterized species identified only upto genus level. The sequences belonging to

Eleven Type II Restriction enzymes (Table 1) were considered for these analyses. Restriction Mapper Version 3
http://restrictionmapper.org/ was used to obtain the
restriction pattern of the 12 Streptococcus species data
sets employed for construction of phylogenetic framework. These restriction patterns were analyzed and a
consensus pattern was determined for each species.
Cluster analysis for restriction profile

For cluster analyses MVSP (Multi Variate Statistical
Package, Kovach Computing Services) version 3.13p was
used. Dendrograms were constructed using the

restriction patterns generated by different restriction

show the utility of these enzymes in distinguishing different strains.

Results
In the present study, 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to 12 different species from the genus Streptococcus
were analyzed with the aim to construct phylogenetic
framework, identification of species-specific signatures
and restriction enzyme analysis.
Phylogenetic framework

Phylogenetic tree (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) based on 61
sequences of S. pyogenes revealed 8 clusters. 8 sequences
representing these 8 clusters were chosen. These
sequences could represent genetic heterogeneity present
within this species. Similarly, sequences from other
Streptococcus spp. were analysed for genetic heterogeneity present within them (Additional file 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12: Fig. S2-S12). Different representative
sequences were choosen from each species that could
provide information regarding the range of genetic
variability present within each species (Table 2). 63 such
representative sequences were selected for framework
construction (Figure 1). Strains of all the species were
clearly segregated except for S. pneumoniae and S. mitis
suggesting a high level of similarity between strains of
these two species, making their identification difficult
solely on the basis of 16S rRNA gene.
The framework generated was then used to check if
uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. can be classified
among the framework species (Figure 2). Out of 63
sequences previously identified upto genus level, 43
were found to segregate with 7 Streptococcus framework
species, supported by high bootstrap values. Among
these 43 sequences, 3 segregated with S. anginosus, 21
with S. mitis, 6 with S. pneumoniae and S. gallolyticus

each, 5 with S. bovis-equinus, 1 with S. dysgalactiae and
S. thermophilus each (Figure 2). No strains could be segregated with S. mutans, S. pyogenes, S. equi, S. agalactiae and S. sobrinus. The framework based segregation
was further validated by checking for the presence of
species-specific signatures and restriction analysis.
Signature sequences

Out of 20 signatures identified for each of the 12 Streptococcus framework species, only 1-5 unique signatures
were found (Table 3) in framework species. The unique
signatures were found in: S. mutans: 5; S. dysgalactiae:
3; S. equi, S. sobrinus and S. thermophilus: 2 each; S. gallolyticus, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. bovis-equinus, S.
anginosus and S. pneumoniae: 1 each. These signatures
were found to occur with high frequency. Moreover,
these signatures were also found to be highly conserved
across a particular species showing 98-100% sequence
identity but were found to be fragmented in other species. No unique signature could be identified for S.
mitis. But S. mitis can still be distinguished from S.
pneumoniae using the signature found unique to S.
pneumoniae. In S. mitis the signature was found to be
substituted at specific positions and thus can distinguish
these two species (Table 3). The signature found for S.
bovis-equinus was effective in distinguishing it from very
closely related species like S. lutetiensis and S. gallolyticus. These signatures were further used to validate the
segregation of 43 sequences among 7 different framework species. All 43 sequences were found to contain
the signature unique to the particular species thus validating the affiliation of these sequences to a particular
species.
Restriction enzyme analysis

In-silico restriction enzyme analysis using eleven type II
enzymes revealed different patterns. Restriction sites for
AluI, BfaI, HaeIII, MspI, RsaI and Sau3AI occurred with
frequency of 3-10 resulting in 4-11 fragments. The sites
for enzymes EcoRI, SmaI and HhaI were found in
majority of sequences studied but they were found to be
less frequent cutters producing single, single and double
cuts respectively. These enzymes thus are less informative and serve no purpose. Inspite of low frequency,
BamHI and HindIII can still be used for distinguishing
different Streptococcus spp. BamHI produced single but
unique cut in S. thermophilus and can be used to distinguish S. thermophilus isolates. HindIII produces single
but unique cut in S. sobrinus and can be used to distinguish S. sobrinus isolates. As can be seen from the dendrograms (Additional file 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18: Fig. S13S18) different restriction enzymes can be used for identification and distinguishing different isolates. While
AluI was found to distinguish majority of Streptococcus

framework species, MspI produced maximum numbers
of cuts and thus proved informative for such analysis.
Closely related species like S. dysgalactiae and S. agalactiae can be distinguished using BfaI, MspI and HaeIII.
Similarly, S. gallolyticus and S. bovis can be distinguished using BfaI and HaeIII. Therefore a combination
of AluI, BfaI, MspI or HaeIII can be used for distinguishing closely related organisms. The sequences segregated with framework species were further validated
using in-silicorestriction enzyme analysis. The identified
sequences showed unique restriction enzyme pattern
close to the nearby framework species (Table 4) again
validating the framework based segregation. Thus combining the information from framework, signature
sequences and restriction enzyme analysis it was possible to identify 43 sequences (out of 63) upto species
level which were previously designated as Streptococcus
sp. (Table 4).

Discussion
Streptococcus is a clinically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and
animal pathogens. This genus has undergone considerable taxonomic revisions and has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity.
The present study aims to explore internal features of
16S rRNA gene sequences of different Streptococcus spp.

to develop methods for their identification. A phylogenetic framework was constructed using different representative sequences followed by identification of
signature sequences and restriction enzymes analysis.
The framework based analysis suggests a high level of
genetic heterogeneity present within different Streptococcus spp. Signature sequences specific for each Streptococcus framework sp. were identified. These signature
motifs would be simple to use as a supplement to the
automated identification process. Restriction analysis has
proved to be an important tool to identify newly isolated
strains [50-52] and can be exploited for describing new
species [53]. Multiple restriction enzyme usage is
recommended for better resolution. Although it has
been documented that closely related species cannot be
distinguished solely on the basis of 16S rRNA gene, but
exploring the internal features of this gene can be of
definite use. Therefore researchers are now looking to
explore the unique features of 16S rRNA gene that have
not been explored yet [54,55]. As already described the
genus Streptococcus has been divided into different
groups based on 16S rRNA gene similarity [4]. The framework species used for these analyses belong to these
different groups.
Four framework species- S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S.
equi and S. dysgalactiae belong to pyogenic group
which is the largest group of the genus Streptococcus. S.
pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. equi and S. dysgalactiae can

The signatures were found to 98-100% identical and conserved in a particular species. Py denotes pyrimidine, Pu denoted purine and N denotes any nucleotide.

be distinguished on the basis of specific signatures
(Table 3) as well as using different restriction enzymes
(Additional file 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18: Figures S13-S18).
Two framework species, S. pneumoniae and S. mitis
belong to mitis group. Identification of members of mitis
group, particularly S. pneumoniae is problematic. Identification of S. pneumoniae isolates is usually done using
serological [56,57] and molecular techniques [58-60]. S.
pneumoniae isolates can be easily identified using the signature sequence as given in Table 3. We could easily distinguish S. pneumoniae isolates from S. mitis using this
signature sequence. Other members of this group (S.
mitis and S. oralis) that are almost indistinguishable on
the basis of complete 16S rRNA gene sequence can be
differentiated using different restriction enzymes. S. mitis
can be distinguished from other two species of this group
by using enzyme Sau3AI. S. pneumoniae, S.mitis and S.
oralis can be distinguished from each other by exploiting
AluI and MspI (data not shown for S. oralis).
Framework species S. anginosus belongs to anginosus
group. This group consists of only 3 species (S. anginosus, S. intermedius and S. constellatus). Members of
anginosus group are also difficult to identify and distinguish. An identification scheme for differentiation of
these 3 strains was proposed by Whiley et al. [61] and
Whiley and Beighton [62]. Commercial identification

systems [63,64] and molecular methods have been used
for identifying and distinguishing these three species
[65,14]. S. anginosus can be easily identified using the
signature sequence (Table 3) and use of restriction
enzymes. Restriction enzymes AluI, BfaI, RsaI and
HaeIII can be used for distinguishing members of anginosus group efficiently (data not shown for S. intermedius and S. constellatus).
Framework species, S. thermophilus belongs to salivarius group which is closely related to bovis group [66]
and consists of only 3 species (S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. thermophilus). S. thermophilus can be identified
by using unique signature sequence (Table 3).
Two framework species, S. bovis and S. gallolyticus
belong to bovis group. Members of bovis group, S. bovis
and S. gallolyticus are difficult to identify. Isolates of
these two species can be distinguished using the signature specific for S. gallolyticus and S. bovis. Moreover,
the use of restriction enzymes AluI, BfaI and HaeIII can
be instrumental in distinguishing them. The signature
found for S. bovis was found to be efficient in distinguishing S. bovis from closely related species-S. lutetiensis. These two species are difficult to distinguish solely
on the basis of 16S rRNA gene.
Framework species S. mutans and S. sobrinus belong
to mutans group. These two species are also difficult to

distinguish. Beighton et al. (1991) [8] provided a scheme
for identification of S. mutans and S. sobrinus strains. In
the present investigations these two can be easily distinguished using species-specific signature and use of
restriction enzymes- AluI, BfaI, HaeIII, MspI, RsaI and
Sau3AI.

Conclusions
The species that are difficult to distinguish solely on the
basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence can be identified
using inner secrets of 16S rRNA gene, the signatures.
These signatures can be exploited for quick identification. The aim of phylogenetic framework construction is

Lal et al. Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials 2011, 10:28
http://www.ann-clinmicrob.com/content/10/1/28

to define a range of genetic variability within the species
and later exploiting this variability for identification of
different isolates. Similarly, use of restriction enzymes
help in generating markers that can distinguish closely
related species. Present study reveals that the framework, use of specific signatures in 16S rRNA gene and
pattern generated by different restriction enzymes can
be exploited for identification of isolates belonging to
the genus Streptococcus. The markers generated in the
present study are based on 16S rRNA gene sequence
which is conserved and neither subjected to changes
due to culture conditions nor exhibit biochemical variability. Thus the scheme proposed can be applied to any
isolate. The approach is cost effective and rapid way for
identification of various isolates and thus can be used to
differentiate isolates that are difficult to distinguish due
to very close traits and biochemical features. Additionally the approach is simple for preliminary identification
of a species and can supplement existing automated
identification processes. But we should keep in mind
that this is a simplified procedure and thus it is also
important to know the limitations of such simplified
approach.
