Abstract
Background: Fruit coloration of red-skinned grapevines is mainly due to anthocyanin pigments.
We analysed a panel of nine cultivars that included extreme phenotypes for berry colour, ranging
from green (absence of anthocyanins) to red, purple, violet and blue. Expression of six genes of the
anthocyanin pathway coding for flavanone-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H),
flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H), UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT),
glutathione-S-transferase (GST), O-methyltransferase (OMT) and four transcription factors (MybA,
MybB, MybC, MybD) was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR at four developmental stages from before
the onset of ripening until full maturity and compared to anthocyanin metabolites.
Results: Total anthocyanin content at full maturity correlated well with the cumulative expression
of F3H, UFGT and GST throughout ripening. Transcripts of the last two genes were absent in the
green-skinned cultivar 'Sauvignonasse', also known as 'Tocai friulano', and were at least 10-fold less
abundant in pale red cultivars, such as 'Pinot gris' and 'Gewürztraminer', compared to fully coloured
cultivars. Predominance of tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins (delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin) in
cultivars bearing dark berries with violet and blue hue was associated with higher ratios of F3'5'H/
F3'H transcription, compared to red-skinned cultivars. Higher levels of OMT transcripts were
observed in berries of cultivars that accumulated methoxylated forms of anthocyanins more
abundantly than non-methoxylated forms.
Conclusion: Colour variation of the grape berry conforms to a peculiar pattern of genotypespecific expression of the whole set of anthocyanin genes in a direct transcript-metabolitephenotype relationship. Cumulative mRNA levels of the structural genes and their relative
abundance throughout ripening explained per se the final phenotype for anthocyanin content,
anthocyanin composition, colour intensity and colour hue of grapes at berry maturity.

Background
Regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis has been studied
across a number of flowering plants thanks to the availa-

bility of colour mutants that have facilitated the dissection
of complex regulatory networks. Many studies have concerned themselves with the genetic control of colour phe-

notypes in floral organs of ornamentals (mainly
Antirrhinum majus and Petunia × hybrida) or in kernels of
Zea mays and seed teguments of Arabidopsis thaliana,
which has led to a comprehensive view of the common
features and the species-specific peculiarity of anthocyanin regulation in those plants [1-6]. In fruit trees, the
genetics underlying the presence or absence of anthocyanin pigmentation has been elucidated in bilberry [7],
grapevine [8,9] and apple [10]. However, studies pertaining to the quantitative and qualitative variation of
anthocyanins in fruit and the resulting shifts in colour
have only scratched the surface of the regulatory network
by separately analysing the role of single genes [11-13] or
single transcription factors [14,15].
Grapevine is a fruit crop that encompasses a wide phenotypic variation in berry colour. Plant adaptation to different environments and centuries of human selection have
produced numerous genotypes in which the intensity and
the hue of red coloration vary extensively. A mixture of
variations in anthocyanin content and in the relative proportion of different anthocyanins can produce extreme
phenotypes for skin pigmentation. Anthocyanin concentration in epidermal cells correlates well with the darkness
of berry colour. According to [16], anthocyanin concentration ranged from 6.2 to 26 mg kg-1 of berry in a panel
of 64 pigmented cultivars. Anthocyanin profile and hue
might vary dramatically as well. We have previously demonstrated that the ratio of blue tri-hydroxylated to red dihydrohylated anthocyanins is under transcriptional control of flavonoid 3'(5')-hydroxylase genes (F3'H and
F3'5'H) and it correlates well with the evolution of colour
hue throughout ripening in the cultivar 'Merlot' [11]. All
red cultivars investigated so far synthesise all five grapevine anthocyanins (cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin,
petunidin and malvidin) [16,17]. This means that all cultivars express functional F3'H and F3'5'H genes for the
synthesis of 3'4'-OH and 3'4'5'-OH anthocyanins as well
as O-methyltransferases (OMT) for the methylation of primary anthocyanins. These genes, alongside other key
genes of the core pathway, are assumed to be differentially
regulated in different genetic backgrounds. The biological
questions we aimed to address are: does most regulation
of the anthocyanin biosynthesis in ripening fruit occur at
transcriptional level in a similar way as it occurs in other
species in pigmented organs other than fruit ? Are the distinct patterns of expression of structural genes sufficient to
explain the observed variation of contrasting colour phenotypes peculiar to each cultivar ?
Red-to-blue colour variation across grapevine cultivars
has evolutionary, technological and health implications
of fascinating interest. It is generally assumed that red coloration was the most primitive form of reproductive
organs in plants that synthesise anthocyanins. Anthocy-

anins appeared approximately 120 million years ago
[18,19] and naturally served for the recruitment of seed
dispersers and in UV protection. Unlike roses and carnations, which still do not naturally display blue colouration, most species including grapevine have later acquired
the capability of synthesising anthocyainic blue pigments.
According to this view, the gene F3'H coding for the
enzyme that leads to red anthocyanins is ancestral to the
gene F3'5'H coding for the enzyme that converts red into
blue anthocyanins [20]. Based on phylogenetic analysis,
most F3'5'H arose from F3'H by gene duplication before
the divergence of angiosperms and gymnosperms but in
the documented case of the Asteraceae family this event
occurred repeatedly and much more recently in the evolutionary time scale [20]. This raises the questions of how
and when genes for blue coloration appeared in the grape
genome. F3'H and F3'5'H currently known in the grape
genome split in two different branches of a phylogenetic
tree, that included also F3'H and F3'5'H from other plants
[11]. F3'5'H from the grape genome grouped together
with the homologous F3'5'H from other species rather
than with the paralogous F3'H from grape. This feature is
predictive of an ancient origin of the F3'5'H found in the
present-day grapevines which was already present in the
palaeo-ancestor before the split of major dicot lineages.
More recently, F3'5'H has undergone further evolution in
the grape genome, as witnessed by the structural complexity of the genomic region on the linkage group 6 containing F3'5'H [11].
Anthocyanin composition has a technological impact on
the colour of must obtained from a given cultivar. Colour
of pure anthocyanins shifts progressively from red to blue
as the number of substituted groups on the B-ring
increases and as methoxyl groups replace hydroxyl groups
[21]. After must fermentation, anthocyanin stability in
wines is threatened by a number of factors (light exposure,
fluctuations in storage temperature, oxygen, enzymatic
activities, etc.) which might lead to a premature deterioration of colour. The number and the pattern of the
hydroxyl and methoxyl groups on the B-ring also affect
the reactivity of the moiety. Cyanidin, delphinidin and
petunidin have orto-di-phenolic groups which enhance
susceptibility to oxidation [22]. Methoxylated anthocyanins, such as peonidin and malvidin, are more stable.
The relative number of hydroxyl and methoxyl groups
also affects polarity and solubility of the corresponding
anthocyanin in aqueous and hydro-alchoolic solutions
such as must and wine, respectively.
The whole class of polyphenol compounds, including
anthocyanins, present in red grapes and wines is regarded
as a powerful source of ROS scavengers [23,24]. However,
the benefit for human health of each compound depends
on its bioavailability and its antioxidant capacity. Dietary

anthocyanins are adsorbed as intact 3-monoglucosides by
a bilitranslocase in the epithelial cells of the gastric
mucosa. For instance, the affinity of this carrier to each
one of the five 3-monoglucoside anthocyanins varies
within a 6-fold range [25]. This greatly affects the biological value of food and beverages depending not only on
their total anthocyanin content but also on their peculiar
anthocyanin profile.
In this paper, we report on transcript-metabolite-phenotype relationships between anthocyanin genes, anthocyanins and berry colour across cultivars of Vitis vinifera. The
regulation of six genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic
pathway (F3H, F3'H, F3'5'H, UFGT, OMT, GST) as well as
four related transcription factors (MybA, MybB, MybC,
MybD) were monitored at four stages of ripening. The correlation between gene transcriptional levels, anthocyanin

content/profile and skin pigmentation was assayed in
nine cultivars encompassing most of the extreme variation for berry colour known in naturally occurring grapevines.

Results
Anthocyanin content
The anthocyanin content in ripe berries of the pigmented
cultivars ranged from 0.7 to 9.7 mg g-1 of skin (Table 1,
Figure 1A). Anthocyanins were not detected in berry skin
of the white (green/yellow-skinned) cultivar 'Sauvignonasse', synonym for 'Tocai friulano'. Total anthocyanin
content was less than 1 mg g-1 of skin in the palely pigmented cultivars 'Gewürztraminer' and 'Pinot gris',
ranged from 5.0 to 6.2 mg g-1 of skin in 'Grignolino',
'Moscato rosa', 'Nebbiolo' and 'Pinot noir' and exceeded
7.3 mg g-1 of skin in the dark pigmented cultivars 'Aglian-

ico' and 'Tempranillo'. The cumulative transcription of
UFGT, the specific gene for anthocyanin biosynthesis, calculated as the area below the curve of expression throughout ripening, increased proportionally to the anthocyanin
content (Table 1) and showed a strong correlation (R2 =
0.80) with the final anthocyanin content (Figure 1E). The
kinetics of anthocyanin accumulation through four ripening stages showed overlapping patterns with the curve of
expression of UFGT. Four examples of the expression profile of UFGT in a cultivar that does not synthesise anthocyanins ('Sauvignonasse'), a cultivar in which anthocyanins
are barely detectable ('Pinot gris'), a cultivar that has an
intermediate amount of anthocyanins ('Grignolino') and
a cultivar rich in anthocyanins ('Tempranillo') are
reported in Figure 1B. In all but one fully coloured cultivars ('Pinot noir', 'Tempranillo', 'Nebbiolo', Moscato rosa'
and 'Grignolino'), expression profile of UFGT peaked
between mid- and full-véraison. Transcript levels of the
same genes were undetectable in 'Sauvignonasse' and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/46

barely detectable in the palely coloured cultivars 'Pinot
gris' and 'Gewürztraminer'. The peak of UFGT gene
expression was delayed in the cultivar 'Aglianico' compared to all other cultivars (data not shown). Sugar accumulation, burst of organic acids, expression of DWF1, a
gene involved in the brassinosteroid-dependent promotion of ripening, and of other anthocyanin genes were also
delayed in 'Aglianico'. The cultivation of this variety is
more suited to warmer climates and it did not attain complete phenolic maturation at the site of this trial. All other
cultivars displayed curves of anthocyanin accumulation
and patterns of gene expression for DWF1 and UFGT as
their requirements of growing degree days (GDD) had
already been met at the moment of harvest.
The gene GST showed an expression pattern similar to
that of UFGT (Figure 1C), even though the correlation
between cumulative transcription throughout ripening
and final amount of anthocyanins was slightly lower (R2

was also strongly correlated with the final anthocyanin
content (R2 = 0.81) (Figure 1D). None of the four transcription factors MybA, MybB, MybC, and MybD showed
strong correlation between cumulative transcription
(Table 1) and total anthocyanin content at harvest (R2 <
0.52).
Anthocyanin profile at full maturity
The composition of 3-monoglucoside, acetyl-3-glucoside
and p-coumaryl-3-glucoside anthocyanins in each cultivar
is reported in Table 1. With regard to the acylation of the
glycosyl group, non-acylated anthocyanins were the most
abundant fraction in all cultivars except 'Gewürztraminer', in which acetyl-3-glucosides (50.6 %) predominated. The contribution of p-coumaryl forms was the
lowest in all cultivars except 'Aglianico' and 'Tempranillo'.

'Pinot noir' was the only cultivar that synthesised exclusively monoglucoside (92.4 %) and acetyl-3-glucoside
(7.6 %) anthocyanins, while p-coumaryl anthocyanins
were not detected in the berry skin of this cultivar.
The contribution of each anthocyanin (cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, malvidin) to the final
anthocyanin profile was calculated based on the
monoglucoside forms and is expressed as percentage in
Table 1. Malvidin was the most abundant anthocyanin in
all cultivars that had a prevalence of tri-hydroxylated
anthocyanins. By contrast, among the cultivars that had a
predominance of di-hydroxylated anthocyanins, peonidin was the most abundant in 'Grignolino', 'Moscato rosa'
and 'Nebbiolo', while cyanidin was the most abundant in
'Gewürztraminer'.

Hydroxylation of the B-ring and evolution of anthocyanin
composition during ripening
Anthocyanin profiles differed dramatically among the
nine cultivars studied. The abundance of blue tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins in ripe berries ranged from the lowest
extreme of 14.5 % in 'Grignolino' to the highest extreme
of 93.2 % in 'Aglianico' (Table 1 and Figure 2A). 'Tempranillo' and 'Pinot noir' also had a remarkable prevalence of
tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins (89.7 and 70.0 %, respectively). Tri-hydroxylated derivatives roughly equalled dihydroxylated derivatives in 'Pinot gris'. By contrast,
'Grignolino', 'Moscato rosa', 'Gewürztraminer' and 'Nebbiolo' had more di-hydroxylated than tri- hydroxylated
anthocyanins. The evolution of the anthocyanin profile
during ripening is reported in Figure 2B. Cyanidin-based
pigments accumulated more promptly at the first sampling stage after the onset of colouration but their contribution to the total anthocyanin content declined as
ripening proceeded, to the advantage of a more abundant
synthesis of delphinidin-based anthocyanins. Whatever
the final percentage in each cultivar, the contribution of
tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins was higher at harvest than
at the onset of véraison in all pigmented cultivars but
'Pinot noir'.

The expression pattern of F3'5'H throughout ripening is
shown in Figure 2C using four examples of a cultivar that
does not synthesise anthocyanins ('Sauvignonasse'), a cultivar in which 3'4'-OH anthocyanins predominate
('Grignolino'), a cultivar in which 3'4'-OH and 3'4'5'-OH
equally contribute to final anthocyanin content ('Pinot
gris') and a cultivar very rich in 3'4'5'-OH anthocyanins
('Tempranillo'). We also normalised the expression of
F3'5'H to the rate of anthocyanin biosynthesis by dividing
the transcript level of F3'5'H by the transcript level of
UFGT (F3'5'H /UFGT). The evolution of the ratio F3'5'H /
UFGT through ripening is reported in Figure 2D. The
cumulative ratio F3'5'H /UFGT calculated from the onset
of ripening to harvest was strongly correlated with the
final percentage of tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins (R2 =
0.90) (Figure 2E). We also calculated the expression ratio
between F3'5'H and F3'H, shown here in four representative cultivars (Figure 2F). Colour of berry skin in cultivars
in which F3'5'H transcription was highly activated
showed a shift to blue, in agreement with higher relative
abundance of tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins. Skin colour
evolution is represented in Figure 3. Colour was reproduced by an image editing software (CorelDraw) using
mean L, a, b values averaged on 70 berries at all ripening
stages investigated in this study.
Methoxylation of the B-ring
The contribution of methoxylated (peonidin, petunidin
and malvidin) and non-methoxylated (cyanidin and delphinidin) anthocyanins to the final profile was calculated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/46

in the genotypes studied (Figure 4A). 'Gewürztraminer'
had the lowest percentage of methoxylated anthocyanins
(28.1 %) whilst all other pigmented cultivars had a percentage of methoxylated forms higher than 78 %. In particular, 'Pinot gris' and 'Pinot noir' scored the highest
percentages of 97.1 and 93.4 %, respectively. 'Grignolino',
'Moscato Rosa', 'Nebbiolo' and 'Aglianico' had percentages of methoxylated anthocyanins ranging between 86
and 90 %; in 'Tempranillo' the percentage was lower than
80 %. The percentage of each methoxylated derivative calculated among the corresponding hydroxylated form is
reported in Table 1. The expression pattern of OMT in four
reference cultivars, 'Sauvignonasse', 'Pinot gris', 'Grignolino' and 'Tempranillo', is reported in Figure 4B. The relative expression of OMT was normalised to the rate of
anthocyanin biosynthesis by dividing the transcript level
of OMT by the transcript level of UFGT (OMT /UFGT).
The evolution of the ratio of transcriptional level OMT /
UFGT through ripening and the relative abundance of
methoxylated anthocyanin is compatible with a role of
OMT in the methoxylation of the B-ring (Figure 4C).

Discussion
Anthocyanin pigmented grapes appear in many stunning
colour variations. In spite of the invariable presence of all
anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in any investigated cultivar, a genotype-specific regulation of the genes along the
core pathway and at the main branching points is presumed to underlie the observed quantitative variation in
anthocyanin content and the red-to-blue shift in anthocyanin pigmentation [26]. In the experiment presented in
this paper, differences in anthocyanin pigmentation
across fruit of nine grapevine cultivars are attributable to
variations of the peculiar pattern of expression for the global set of anthocyanin genes. Gene expression of F3H,
UFGT, OMT, GST strongly increased at véraison in all cultivars except for the non-pigmented 'Sauvignonasse', and
the palely pigmented 'Gewürztraminer' and 'Pinot gris'. In
the latter two palely pigmented cultivars, the levels of
transcripts remained low although detectable throughout
ripening. Striking differences were also observed in the
regulation of flavonoid hydroxylases. Expression profile
of F3'H was relatively high even before the onset of
anthocyanin biosynthesis, and transcripts of this gene
were present after véraison in all cultivars, also including
the white cultivar 'Sauvignonasse'. By contrast, transcription of F3'5'H was developmentally activated after the
onset of véraison in 'Aglianico', 'Tempranillo' and 'Pinot
noir', the cultivars that synthesise mostly 3'4'5'-hydroxylated anthocyanins and bear blue-skinned berries, while it
remained at lower levels in the red cultivars and was not
transcribed at all in 'Sauvignonasse'. Cumulative mRNAs
of F3H and UFGT throughout ripening and relative abun-

dance of F3'5'H to UFGT and of OMT to UFGT explained
per se large part of the phenotypic variation for anthocyanin content, anthocyanin composition, colour intensity
and colour hue of grapes at berry maturity. Most regulation of the flavonoid pathway has been shown to occur at
transcriptional level also in pigmented organs other than
fruit in other species [1,6,27,28]. In Z. mays kernels, the
entire flavonoid pathway from chalcone synthase downwards is simultaneously regulated by Myb type and basic
helix-loop-helix transcriptional factors; in A. majus floral
organs, the anthocyanin pathway is regulated as a block
from the gene F3H downwards; in P. hybrida flowers, the
pathway is regulated as a unit from the gene DFR downwards. In grapevines, the main control point for anthocyanin quantitative variation is downstream in the pathway
at the UFGT level in agreement with the early observations
by [29], but the variation in anthocyanin composition is
finely tuned upstream of UFGT at the level of flavonoid
hydroxylases (F3'H and F3'5'H) and downstream of UFGT
at the level of O-methyltransferase. This would reflect a
higher specialisation in partitioning flavonoid intermediates towards different classes of end-products (flavonols,
catechins, various anthocyanins) which accumulate in the
same tissue during different stages of berry development.
We have shown that colour variation in the grape fruit is
directly dependent on changes in mRNA levels of the global set of anthocyanin enzymatic genes. Also in other species, mostly ornamentals, shifts in flower colour across
genotypes are more frequently associated with changes in
regulation of gene expression rather than with structural

mutations that result in altered protein activity [30,31].
Variation in the expression of enzymatic genes might ultimately depend on regulatory genes that control transcription of some or all structural genes or on variation of cisacting elements of the target structural genes that respond
to the regulators [32]. We analysed gene expression of
four Myb-type transcription factors known in grape,
including the MybA gene that controls the transcriptional
activation of UFGT [8]. The cumulative expression of
none of the four transcription factors was sufficient per se
to explain the quantitative variation in anthocyanin content, which probably conceals the presence of additional
factors involved in the process. The synthesis of different
classes of flavonoid compounds from common precursors occurs in the same cells within the grape skin. Hence,
the few anthocyanin transcription factors investigated so
far in grape may represent only the tip of the iceberg of a
more complex regulatory network of the flavonoid pathway. Like in other species, it is possible that other Mybtype and basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factors and
WD40 proteins might differentially modulate the expression of structural genes of the early and late steps, of the
core backbone and of side branches of the pathway, at different developmental stages and in different genotypes.

pigmented cutlivars or 50 % of softened berries in 'Sauvignonasse' and 'Gewürztraminer'), 100 % véraison, full
maturity (on average at 17.4 °Brix of soluble solids and
7.4 g L-1titratable acidity). Due to different thermal
requirements for reaching the same phenological stage in
different cultivars, complete véraison occurred in a window of time from July 28th, 2005 in 'Moscato rosa' to September 2nd in 'Aglianico', 'Grignolino' and 'Nebbiolo' and
technological maturity was reached from September 5th in
'Pinot Noir', 'Moscato rosa', 'Pinot gris', and 'Gewürztraminer' till October 4th in 'Aglianico' and 'Nebbiolo' [see
Additional file 1]. At each stage, samples of 70 berries
were collected for berry weight determination and colorimetric measurements. At mid-véraison, green berries were
sampled separately from red berries on the same clusters.
Berry colour was measured with an X-Rite 948 Chromameter (X-Rite). Colorimetric specification was referenced to
the CIELab scale. Then, skin was peeled for anthocyanin
extraction (see below) and pulp was used for quantifying
total soluble solids and titratable acidity. Soluble solids
were measured by a refractometer and expressed as °Brix,
titratable acidity was expressed as tartaric acid equivalents.
Forty more berries were sampled on the same clusters and
peeled skins were used for RNA extraction.

Conclusion

Anthocyanin quantification and profiles
Anthocyanins were extracted for 4 hours from 200 mg of
berry skin with 2 mL of methanol, then centrifuged and
filtered with a 0.2 µm PTFE filter (Chemtek analitica).
After methanol evaporation, anthocyanins were re-suspended with 100–400 µL of 27:73 methanol:perchloric
acid 0.3% (v/v). Anthocyanins were separated by HPLC
using a C18 Purospher RP-18 (5µm, 250 mm × 4 mm)
column (Merck), according to the procedure reported by
[11]. Anthocyanin content was expressed as mg L-1 of malvidin 3-glucoside. The composition of monoglucoside
anthocyanins was used for calculating the percentage of
3'4'-OH and 3'4'5'-OH derivatives and the percentage of
methoxylated anthocyanins.

Natural phenotypic differences offered us the opportunity
to follow up the role of anthocyanin genes that lead to
extreme colorations in grapes. We traced the determination of berry colour from the phenotypic level down to
the transcriptional level through the metabolite level. The
regulation of the anthocyanin pathway was peculiar to
each cultivar. By following the expression profile from the
onset of véraison till full maturity, it was possible to associate anthocyanin metabolites and discrete colour phenotypes with transcriptional profiles of structural genes.
Further investigations are required to identify the suite of
changes in regulatory elements across cultivars. Thanks to
the privilege of being the first fruit crop to have its genome
sequenced [33] and owing to the economical impact of
grape anthocyanins for enological worth (production of
premium red wines), nutraceutical value (dietary
polyphenols) and dye industry uses (natural colorants),
grapevines may become the archetype for studying
anthocyanin regulation in fruit just as petunias have been
for studying anthocyanin regulation in flowers.

Methods
Plant material
Vines were grown at the germplasm repository of Vivai
Cooperativi Rauscedo, northeastern Italy (46° 04' N; 12°
50' E; 110 masl). Vines were trained to Sylvoz. Sampling
was scheduled at four ripening stages: pre-véraison (on
average at 4.2 °Brix of soluble solids and 37.1 g L-1 titratable acidity), mid-véraison (50 % of coloured berries in

Transcript profiling
RNA extraction, DNase treatment and cDNA synthesis
were performed as described in [11]. Quantitative realtime PCR was carried out on a DNA Engine Opticon2 (MJ
Research) using SYBR Green. Each reaction (20 µL) contained 200 nM each primer, 1:60 (or 1:240) diluted
cDNA, 0.4 U of HotMaster Taq polymerase (Eppendorf),
4.0 mM Magnesium Acetate, 0.4 mM dNTPs and SYBR
solution (Eppendorf). Thermal cycling conditions were
95°C for 3 min followed by 94°C for 15 s, 56°C for 20 s,
and 68°C for 30 s for 40 cycles, followed by a melting
cycle from 65°C to 95°C. Each cDNA sample was analysed at two different dilutions (1:60 and 1:240 of the
original cDNA), each dilution run in duplicate. Gene transcripts were quantified upon normalisation to Ubiquitin

of the target gene with that of UbiCF (CF203457.1, primer
forward 5'-CTATATGCTCGCTGCTGACG, primer reverse
5'-AAGCCAGGCAGAGACAACTC). Gene expression was
calculated as overall mean and standard error among all
dilutions and replicates. Primers pairs for UFGT were
retrieved from [34], DWF1 from [35], GST from [36],
F3H, F3'H, F3'5'H, OMT, MybA, MybB, MybC and MybD
from [11].
