Abstract
Background: Revealing the past and present demographic history of populations is of high
importance to evaluate the conservation status of species. Demographic data can be obtained by
direct monitoring or by analysing data of historical and recent collections. Although these methods
provide the most detailed information they are very time consuming. Another alternative way is to
make use of the information accumulated in the species' DNA over its history. Recent development
of the coalescent theory makes it possible to reconstruct the demographic history of species using
nucleotide polymorphism data. To separate the effect of natural selection and demography,
multilocus analysis is needed because these two forces can produce similar patterns of
polymorphisms. In this study we investigated the amount and pattern of sequence variability of a
Europe wide sample set of two peat moss species (Sphagnum fimbriatum and S. squarrosum) with
similar distributions and mating systems but presumably contrasting historical demographies using
3 regions of the nuclear genome (appr. 3000 bps). We aimed to draw inferences concerning
demographic, and phylogeographic histories of the species.
Results: All three nuclear regions supported the presence of an Atlantic and Non-Atlantic clade
of S. fimbriatum suggesting glacial survival of the species along the Atlantic coast of Europe.
Contrarily, S. squarrosum haplotypes showed three clades but no geographic structure at all.
Maximum likelihood, mismatch and Bayesian analyses supported a severe historical bottleneck and
a relatively recent demographic expansion of the Non-Atlantic clade of S. fimbriatum, whereas size
of S. squarrosum populations has probably decreased in the past. Species wide molecular diversity
of the two species was nearly the same with an excess of replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum.
Similar levels of molecular diversity, contrasting phylogeographic patterns and excess of
replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum compared to S. squarrosum mirror unexpected differences
in the demography and population history of the species.
Conclusion: This study represents the first detailed European wide phylodemographic
investigation on bryophytes and shows how pattern of nucleotide polymorphism can reveal
unexpected differences in the population history of haploid plants with seemingly similar
characteristics.

Background
Geographic distribution of species is continuously shaped
by several extrinsic factors causing repeated historical
range and demographic expansions/contractions [1,2].
Using historical observations, short-term range expansions and contractions, together with associated demographic changes, have been documented in several,
mostly invasive species in Europe and also world-wide [36]. From a conservation biological point of view, it is of
high importance to reconstruct the historical demography
of populations, which can help to work out conservation
strategies. In addition, correlations between demographic
changes and climatic oscillations may be useful to predict
species responses to the accelerated climate change [7]. If
a series of temporarily spaced data is available, demographic changes over several decades are relatively easy to
reconstruct. However, comparison of historical and recent
observations is challenging, among others because of the
difficulties emerging when comparing data gathered by
different sampling strategies [8].
Methods using the current level and distribution of
genetic variability to estimate the historical demography
of populations provide an additional tool to test demographic hypotheses suggested by simple historical observations [9-12]. Historical demography considerably
influences both qualitative and quantitative properties of
sequence-level polymorphisms at neutrally evolving sites
[13,14]. Consequently, based on the current pattern of
sequence-level polymorphisms, it is possible to distinguish among populations, which currently underwent a
demographic expansion and those, which are in a declining phase. Populations after a demographic expansion are
described by rapid coalescent events following long
branches on the coalescent tree [14]. In the mismatch distribution, long branches lead to an excess of low frequency polymorphisms [15,16].
Unfortunately, selective forces might lead to the same pattern of molecular variation as would be expected in an
expanding population. Investigating noncoding, neutrally
evolving sequence portions does not overcome the problem of selection because they might be influenced by
hitchhiking effects of linked loci [17]. Although selective
forces and demography might produce the same pattern
of polymorphism, selection affects the genome locally,
whereas demography extends its effect on the whole
genome. Consequently, investigating multiple, unlinked
loci can help to separate the influence of selection and
demography on the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism
[18,19].
In the present study, we aimed to reconstruct the demographic histories of two peat moss species based on nucleotide polymorphism data. Peat mosses are an ancient

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/144

plant group with a worldwide distribution [20] and represent a model system for population genetic research in
bryophytes [21-24]. In addition, phylogenetically closely
related species pairs with similar distribution patterns and
life history characteristics provide an outstanding opportunity to test the influence of species-specific demography
on nucleotide polymorphism.
To concentrate on the effect of demography and minimize
the influence of other possible factors on the pattern and
amount of sequence-level variability, two phylogenetically closely related species with similar distributions, ecological requirements and mating systems have been
selected. Both species are monoecious (produce antheridia and archegonia on the same gametophore) and distributed from the Iberian Peninsula to Svalbard across
Europe. They frequently occur together at the edge of
mires under Alnus or Salix stands and can tolerate higher
nutrient concentrations [20,25]. Although they share similar characteristics, recent investigations show that S. fimbriatum is more successful in colonizing open soil surfaces
and produces more rapidly sporophytes after establishment than S. squarrosum [26]. In addition, analyses of past
and current distributions of the species show that S. fimbriatum is presumably experiencing a rapid expansion at
least in some parts of Europe, whereas S. squarrosum
shows no evidence of a recent population demographic
change [27].
Previous investigations on a limited number of accessions
using chloroplast sequences, suggested contrasting phylogeographic patterns in the monoecious S. fimbriatum and
S. squarrosum in Europe [28]. Although chloroplast markers allowed drawing of phylogeographic hypotheses, very
low resolution of the dataset hampered any further statistical inference. Moreover, the chloroplast genome consists
of completely linked loci and thus may be strongly influenced by selective forces. Consequently, it is impossible to
separate the effect of demography and natural selection
on nucleotide polymorphisms using only chloroplast
sequence data.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate the historical
demography of the two species in detail using more
detailed sampling, and sequence data of three unlinked
nuclear regions covering appr. 3000 bps of the genome.
We intended to differentiate between selective and demographic forces and were particularly interested in the following questions: 1. Does phylogeographic structure
depend on the loci investigated? 2. Does multilocus analysis support assumed population expansion of S. fimbriatum? 3. What kind of demographic histories could lead to
the current amount and pattern of molecular variability?

Results
Geographic distribution of haplotypes
In S. fimbriatum, the GapC and the RAPDa regions
resolved the highest number of haplotypes (19 and 16
respectively), whereas the ITS region had much less resolution (9 haplotypes). All three regions supported a welldefined split of haplotypes into two groups (Figure 1).
One lineage, further referred to as "Atlantic clade" occurs
along the Atlantic coast of Spain, France and southern part
of Britain. The rest of the accessions grouped into a clade
extending from Southern France to Scandinavia ("NonAtlantic clade") with one or two frequent and several rare
haplotypes. In contrast to the ITS and RAPDa regions, the
GapC gene gives further interpretable resolution within
the Non-Atlantic clade. Plants from eastern part of Spain
(haplotypes G and H, Figure 1) form a separate, geographically well-delimited clade, also accessions from Austria
and Hungary (haplotype E, except one occurrence in Scandinavia, Figure 1) show some geographic affinity.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/144

In S. squarrosum, all three nuclear markers provided similar distributions of haplotypes, however, markers differed
much more in their resolution than in S. fimbriatum (Figure 2). The ITS region contained only two singleton polymorphisms and one indel, which divided the accessions
into two haplotype groups with similar numbers of accessions. The GapC gene resolved 11 haplotypes, whereas in
the RAPDa region no substitutions were found except two
informative indels. In spite of the lack of substitutions, the
RAPDa region contained a complete dinucleotide repeat,
which showed considerable variability and resolved 20
haplotypes. The dinucleotide repeat was also present in S.
fimbriatum sequences but showed no variability. In contrast to S. fimbriatum, S. squarrosum haplotypes show no
clear geographic affinity. One of the ITS types tends to be
more frequent in the south than in the north, but with a
considerable admixture. RAPDa haplotypes show no clear
geographic pattern either. Haplotypes of the GapC gene

are also widely distributed and only two of them show
any geographic grouping (D, G Figure 2).

No signs of recombination were found in RAPDa and ITS
data sets of both species. GapC sequences of S. fimbriatum
showed one incompatible pair and an Rm value of 1. The
two accessions causing the incompatibility were removed
from the data set in further analyses. No signs of recombination were found in GapC sequences of S. squarrosum.

Molecular polymorphism, tests of neutrality and
recombination
Estimates of θ were lower in S. squarrosum for the ITS
region but were similar for the GapC gene in both species
(Table 1). The GapC gene of S. fimbriatum showed high
diversity at synonymous sites whereas in S. squarrosum all
mutations were found in noncoding regions.

Population growth
Without gaps, Fu's Fs statistic was only significant in the
case of the GapC gene including all European accessions
of S. fimbriatum (Table 2). In contrast, when gaps were
used in the calculations, it turned out to be significantly
different from a constant population in all three regions
investigated. Analysing only the Non-Atlantic group of
accessions, test statistic was significantly negative in all
three genomic regions when including gaps. None of
these statistics were significant using European accessions
of S. squarrosum and accessions of the Atlantic clade of S.
fimbriatum.

The RAPDa region has been excluded from the multilocus
HKA test because it showed no point mutations in S.
squarrosum and only the microsatellite repeat was variable.
No significant deviation from the neutral model was
detected using the multilocus HKA test (p = 0.48). Despite
of the excess of non-synonymous substitutions in S. fimbriatum compared to S. squarrosum (Table 1), the McDonald-Kreitman test (GapC gene) was not significant either
(p = 0.50). In S. squarrosum, Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's
H statistics were never significantly different from the neutral expectations.

Due to low substitutional variability, ITS and RAPDa
regions of both species had to be excluded from the maximum likelihood estimation of exponential growth rate
and historical theta. In S. fimbriatum estimation was made
separately for all European accessions and for the NonAtlantic clade. Analysis using all European accessions of S.
fimbriatum showed about 4 times higher growth rates than
in S. squarrosum, however, values were not significantly
different from a shrinking, stable or expanding population (Table 3). Historical theta values were nearly the
same for both species. Estimation provided two orders of
magnitude higher growth rates and about one order of
magnitude higher theta estimates for the Non-Atlantic
clade of S. fimbriatum compared to S. squarrosum. Growth

Using all European accessions of S. fimbriatum, Tajima's D
was significant for all three nuclear regions investigated
when including gaps (Table 1). However, it turned out to
be non-significant when excluding gaps, except for the
GapC gene. Fay and Wu's H was never significant. Analysing accessions of the Non-Atlantic clade of S. fimbriatum,
Tajima's D was significantly negative except the RAPDa
region. The latter showed a significant negative value as
well when gaps were included. The Atlantic clade showed
no significant deviations from neutrality.

rate of S. fimbriatum in the Non-Atlantic clade was significantly different from zero, whereas that of S. squarrosum
might come from a declining, expanding or stable population as well. Although likelihood surfaces were relatively
flat, growth rate values of the two species turned out to be
significantly different taking approximate confidence
intervals into account.

tum. Theta estimated by the spatial expansion model was
greater in S. fimbriatum, but this difference was not statistically significant. Estimation of parameters of sudden population growth or population expansion models failed for
the Non-Atlantic group of S. fimbriatum, because the nonlinear least squares algorithm failed to converge in ARLEQUIN.

In the mismatch distribution analysis, only the GapC
sequences were used because of the low variability of the
RAPDa and ITS regions (Table 3 and 4). The sudden demographic and the spatial expansion model both fit mismatch data of S. squarrosum. However, the fit was better
using the spatial expansion model. The mismatch distribution of all European accessions of S. fimbriatum was significantly different from the pure demographic expansion
model, but matched the spatial expansion model. Tau was
at least 4 times larger in S. squarrosum than in S. fimbria-

Fitting the data to the IM model
The provided population genetic parameter estimates of
the IM model are all scaled with the mutation rate. In the
absence of reliable mutation rate estimates of the regions
results were interpreted in a relative way (Figure 3). Current theta values of the Atlantic and Non-Atlantic clades of
S. fimbriatum showed considerably different distributions
and point estimates. The Atlantic clade had lower theta
than the Non-Atlantic clade and theta of the ancestral population was much lower than both of them. Estimate of

theta for the Non-Atlantic clade was flat and converged
but did not reach zero even after considerable extension of
the prior. Scaled migration parameters were all very close
to zero. Point estimate of the splitting parameter was high.
In contrast to S. fimbriatum, current thetas in S. squarrosum
almost gave the same point estimates. Point estimate of
the ancestral neutral mutation parameter was an order of
magnitude higher than that of the current populations,
but the posterior distribution was relatively flat. It converged to zero at higher theta values but did not reach zero
even after extending the prior of theta considerably.
Scaled migration parameters showed non zero values but
were flat. Posterior probability distribution of the splitting
parameter was flat and uninformative (not shown).

Discussion
Phylogeographic structure
Results of the present analysis confirm the divergence of
an Atlantic and a Non-Atlantic lineage in S. fimbriatum
and almost no geographic population structure in S.
squarrosum [28]. Moreover, our current results evidently
support a genome-wide historical event, which influenced
all regions in the same way regardless of genomic position.

Since there is no reliable calibration point in the history of
the genus, it is not possible to date the split in S. fimbriatum. In absence of dating, at least two hypotheses are plausible. The first one assumes that Quaternary cold periods
were long enough to allow accumulation of the observed
number of mutations among the Atlantic and Non-Atlantic groups of populations. In addition, it presumes that
current geographic position of populations roughly correspond to that of the historical ones. The Atlantic group
might have survived along the Atlantic coast of Spain,
France and South England, but location of refugia of the
Non-Atlantic group remains ambiguous. Results suggest
that Eastern Iberian populations represent recent colonization events. Using reconstructions of Gajewski et al. [29]
based on peat moss spores we hypothesize survival of the
Non-Atlantic lineage along the border of Poland and Slovakia where extensive Sphagnum dominated habitats
occurred in about 19 ky before present.
The second hypothesis assumes intercontinental migration between Europe and America. North American and
European populations of several Sphagnum species appear
to be closely related [30-33]. Among others, long-range
dispersal as a plausible explanation for the observed pattern has been suggested [26,34,35]. Assuming effective
intercontinental migration, colonization from a divergent

American population might account for the difference
between the two lineages. To test this hypothesis we analysed additional samples from different parts of North
America. Most of the North American accessions either
shared haplotypes with the Non-Atlantic group or differed
by only one substitution and represented derived tip haplotypes. Therefore recent colonization from America does
not account for the divergence of the Atlantic and NonAtlantic clades.
In addition, several issues indicate that the Quaternary
period has played an important role in the observed
genetic structure of the species. First, the patterns detected
in this study were very similar to those found in other bryophyte species [36-38] and seed plants [39,40]. The second reason comes from fossil data and climatic
reconstructions. Occurrence of relic Sphagnum species
[20], fossil remains of peat moss spores or leaves [41,42]
and climatic reconstructions also support survival of populations along the Atlantic coast of Europe [29,43]. Consequently, our results and the above-mentioned
observations support the separation of the Atlantic and
Non-Atlantic lineages of S. fimbriatum by Quaternary glacial cycles and reject recent colonization from another
continent as the cause of the split.
Population demography
Selection influences each gene differently, whereas demographic processes affect the individual as a whole and thus
influence all parts of the genome uniformly regardless of
genomic position [18]. Hence, in an expanding population an excess of low frequency variants is expected for all
loci. This leads to negative Tajima's D and Fu's Fs statistics
[44,45]. These statistics all analyse the total or relative
number of singleton mutations compared to the neutral
coalescent. Their power depends on the total number of
segregating sites in the data set and the time elapsed since
the demographic event [45,46]. Therefore it is not surprising that some of the statistics were not significant when
excluding gaps as segregating sites from the analyses. This
shows that substitution rates are relatively low compared
to the time elapsed since the demographic event. Increas-

ing the mutation rate with including gaps as mutations in
the calculations improves power of the tests and extends
the time frame in which those are applicable. Using these
assumptions, all test statistics for all regions of S. fimbriatum were significantly different from the neutral expectations, whereas none of them provided significant
deviations in S. squarrosum. This confirms a general excess
of low frequency variants, in S. fimbriatum especially in
the Non-Atlantic clade. Since the regions used are
unlinked, we favour a population demographic expansion against a genome wide selection hypothesis in S. fimbriatum. Sequencing errors are negligible because both
species were analysed using the same protocols and polymorphisms have been rechecked on the original chromatograms.
Mismatch distribution analysis revealed further details
about the demographic history of the two species. Mismatch distribution of spatial expansion only slightly differs from that of pure demographic expansion, the latter
showing a higher frequency of identical sequences [47]. In
case of S. fimbriatum, data support the spatial expansion
model, which is in concordance with the hypotheses
about rapid spatial expansion of the species after the Quaternary glaciations. Data from S. squarrosum fit both scenarios, however, considerably better match the latter. This
suggests that S. squarrosum probably went through spatial
expansion as well. Tau value of S. squarrosum was approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of S. fimbriatum, although they were not significantly different.
This suggests that expansion of S. fimbriatum is more
recent than that of S. squarrosum. Assuming that S. fimbriatum expanded immediately after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the estimate for S. squarrosum suggests
expansion related to earlier geological or climatic events
than the LGM. However, results of mismatch analyses
need to be interpreted with caution. These analyses do not
use genealogical information included in the data and
testing the fit between observed and expected distributions and estimating approximate confidence intervals
represent a complex problem as well. Estimation and confidence intervals of tau and θ are skewed and biased, espe-

cially in data sets with low resolution [48]. Maximum
likelihood (LAMARC) and Bayesian analyses (IM) also
supported rapid population expansion in S. fimbriatum.
Results of both analyses showed no significant evidence
for population growth in S. squarrosum. The IM analysis
even supported a population decline since the separation
of the two lineages of S. squarrosum.
Information on the nucleotide polymorphism of three
independent regions gives the opportunity to reconstruct
the historical demography of the two species in details.
Populations of S. fimbriatum and S. squarrosum have been
separated by the Quaternary glaciations, which led to the
differentiation of two and three genetically well diverged
European lineages, respectively. Fixed replacement mutations among the Atlantic and Non-Atlantic groups of S.
fimbriatum indicate that both lineages went through a
severe bottleneck, which led to the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations. It is worth noting that populations of
the Atlantic group retained relatively divergent haplotypes
(Figure 1) despite of their scattered occurrence and small
extent (occurrences are usually not larger than 5 × 5 m).
Hence, these populations very likely represent the leftovers of a formerly more widely distributed genetic lineage.
Fitting the IM model to the data set suggests that a very
high proportion of the ancient population of S. fimbriatum founded the Atlantic clade and the size of the ancient
population was very small. These results show that the
Atlantic clade is very likely a direct descendant of the
ancestral population, which retained ancestral haplotypes
and went through a severe bottleneck. IM and maximum
likelihood estimations show that the Quaternary glaciations shaped population size of the two species differently. Ancient population size of S. squarrosum is
considerably larger than that of S. fimbriatum indicating a
more severe bottleneck in the latter. Larger effective population size of the ancient population of S. squarrosum also
explains the lack of replacement mutations in coding
regions as well as the lack of geographic structure of haplotypes.
Pattern and amount of molecular variability
Overall diversity values for the ITS region were usually an
order of magnitude higher in S. fimbriatum than in S.
squarrosum, however all values were very low. Moreover,
in S. fimbriatum, a considerable portion of the diversity
was due to the genetic differentiation between Atlantic
and Non-Atlantic clades. In contrast, GapC sequences of
the species showed nearly the same nucleotide diversity
values. This is an unexpected result because the pioneer
characteristic of S. fimbriatum (Sundberg et al. 2006), even
when combined with a parallel reduction of the historical
population size of S. squarrosum, implies lower level of
molecular polymorphism in the first species. Peat moss
populations are likely to function as a metapopulation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/144

[49,50]. Theory shows that species-wide genetic diversity
is rapidly lost in metapopulations of pioneer species if
among population migration rates are lower than extinction/recolonization rates [51,52]. Although pioneer characteristic reduces the level of molecular diversity, in range
expansion, due to the phenomenon of surfing mutations,
molecular diversity is increased by a higher proportion of
retained neutral mutations [53]. Consequently, it seems
likely that range expansion contributed significantly to
the molecular variability of S. fimbriatum.
Although the magnitude of molecular polymorphism was
similar in both species, its pattern differed considerably
showing an excess of polymorphism in coding regions of
S. fimbriatum compared to S. squarrosum. Recent increase
of effective population size results in a significant excess of
slightly deleterious replacement mutations [54]. Weakened selection due to reduced effective population size
can lead to the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations as well and thus to elevated nucleotide diversity in
selfing plants [55]. The McDonald-Kreitman test showed
no significant deviations from neutral expectations for the
GapC gene, however, exons of this gene contained
replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum whereas in S.
squarrosum all mutations were restricted to noncoding
regions. Replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum (Lys-Arg,
Ile-Val, Lys-Gln) caused no change in hydrophoby and
almost no change in pI values and thus are likely to be
only slightly deleterious. Consequently, elevated number
of replacement mutations in S. fimbriatum also supports a
rapid population demographic expansion in Europe.
Both species are easily dispersed by spores to longer distances [26,27], however, nuclear markers resolved distinct
Atlantic and Non-Atlantic clades only in S. fimbriatum. All
markers indicate either restricted migration or establishment potential measured on the time scale of the markers'
mutation rates. S. fimbriatum produces considerable
amounts of spores, which can germinate on a wider range
of substrates (especially on substrates with low phosphate
availability) compared to other Sphagnum species [26,56].
Based on these characteristics of the species, the NonAtlantic clade of S. fimbriatum might have rapidly recolonized available soil surfaces after the last glaciation. In
absence of further space, the Atlantic clade might have
been unable to follow this lineage and remained restricted
to the Atlantic coast of Europe. Similar patterns of leading
edge colonization have been observed in several tree species in Europe [57,58].
Overall nucleotide diversity of the three regions was low
in both species compared to estimations in seed plants
[reviewed in [18]], which might be a general trend in bryophytes. Due to the haploid gametophores, no sheltering
of recessive alleles exists in bryophytes and the haploid

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:144

genome of each individual is directly exposed to selection
[30,59]. This, coupled with the presence of deleterious
mutations, considerably reduces the amount of genetic
diversity. Mutation rate also influences genetic variability.
Selection against high mutation rates should exist in bryophytes; otherwise the presence of slightly deleterious
mutations will lead to a severe mutational load [60]. Our
results show that slightly deleterious mutations are
present but are removed very efficiently. The theory of
selection directly acting on the gametophores and low
mutation rates are supported by the data set presented
here. Assuming the same mutation rates in both species,
selection is so efficient, that no replacement mutations
were found in the GapC gene of S. squarrosum at all. Interestingly, in a previous study McDaniel and Shaw [61]
investigated the level of nucleotide polymorphism in the
moss Ceratodon purpureus which turned out to be an order
of magnitude higher than in our species. As this investigation relied on a worldwide sample and used multi-copy
genes, high level of polymorphism may reflect the complex interplay of various forces, such as evolution of gene
families, selective sweeps and phylogeographic history.
Hence, the two studies are hardly comparable and further
investigations on the extent of population level sequence
polymorphism are needed to test theoretical predictions.
In contrast to our results, high levels of isozyme diversity
were found within populations of several bryophytes
[30,60]. This has partly been interpreted as a result of local
adaptation [61]. Although local adaptation might be
important in several species, our results do not support
this hypothesis, since only one of the three replacement
mutations in the GapC gene resulted in charge change.
Hence these mutations probably do not influence enzyme
functions significantly.

Conclusion
Analysing nucleotide polymorphisms of multiple loci
combined with the application of the coalescent theory
provides an effective way to draw inferences about historical demography of species. Furthermore, investigating
polymorphisms of several independent loci makes it possible to separate the effects of selective and demographic
forces. Our study evidently shows that species with similar
ecology, mating systems and current distributions may
have very different demographic and phylogeographic
histories. Such cryptic differences are probably frequent
among bryophytes and must be taken into account when
assessing the vulnerability of species and planning conservation strategies. Due to their haploid gametophores, bryophytes are especially appropriate for studies on sequence
level polymorphisms. Future research using nucleotide
polymorphism data will certainly discover undetected
demographic, phylogeographic and evolutionary processes in this group of haploid plants.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction
S. fimbriatum and S. squarrosum plants were collected by
the authors, provided by colleagues or obtained from herbaria [see Additional file 1]. Plants were dried and stored
in silica gel at 4°C. DNA was extracted using the DNAeasy
plant mini kit (Qiagen, Switzerland) following the manufacturers protocol. Three regions of the nuclear genome
were used for sequencing. The region spanning the 5th–
9'th exons of the GapC (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase C) gene (appr. 1500 bps) was amplified
using protocols and primers described in Szövényi et al.
[64]. A genomic region with unknown function [RAPDa
sensu [65]] was also used. New primers were designed to
improve amplification and sequencing of the fragment. As
a third locus the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region (hereafter ITS)
were amplified and sequenced. Yield of PCR reactions
were improved by applying a semi-nested PCR, where 1 µl
of the 10 × diluted first round product was used as template in the second reaction [see Additional file 2]. The
PCR reaction contained the same amount of components
as described in Szövényi et al. [64] except that final DMSO
concentration was set to 1% v/v in the PCR mastermix to
amplify the ITS region. PCR reactions were run on Biometra (T1 or Tgradient, Whatman Biometra) and Techne ptc
412 (Barloworld Scientific Ltd.) thermocyclers. The PCR
program was the following: 94°C denaturation for 4 min,
then 94°C for 1 min, different annealing temperatures for
1 min and 72°C extension for 1–1.5 min [see Additional
file 2] with 35 cycles with a final extension step at 72°C
for 7 min. The products were checked on 0.8% agarose
gels and cleaned using the GFX PCR and gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences, Switzerland). Approximately 10 ng product was sequenced in 10 µl cycle
sequencing reaction with the Big dye v3.1 in an ABI prism
3100 (Applied Biosystems) genetic analyzer using either
the original and/or different internal PCR primers [see
Additional file 2]. Sequences were contiged and corrected
if necessary with the Sequencher 4.5 software (Gene Code
Corporation).
Sequence alignment, molecular diversity and
recombination event estimates
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [66], checked by
eye and adjusted if needed. All polymorphic sites were
rechecked on the original electropherograms and corrected to avoid false base callings. Haplotype networks
were reconstructed using the TCS software [67]. To
describe the infra specific molecular diversity of the
regions Watterson's (θw) [68] and Tajima's (θπ) [44]
moment estimators of the neutral mutation parameter
were calculated. In case of the GapC gene, levels of polymorphism were calculated for synonymous, nonsynonymous and silent sites as well.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:144

All regions were tested for recombination using the four
gamete test and the minimum number of recombination
events during the history of the sample was calculated
[Rm, [69]]. For several following analyses (cf. below)
sequences with incompatible nucleotide pairs were cut
into recombination free blocks. All calculations were
done using dnaSP v.4.10.4 [70].
Testing deviation from neutrality
To test whether the sequenced regions evolved under neutral expectations, four different methods were applied.
The multilocus HKA test was conducted using the HKA
software [71]. 10 000 coalescent simulations were run to
generate the null distribution of χ2 values. Neutral evolution of the GapC gene was also tested with the McDonaldKreitman test [72]. To test the neutraliy of each locus separately, Tajima's D [44] and Fay and Wu's H statistics [73]
were calculated for each of them. For each locus the latter
two test statistics were calculated considering nucleotide
substitutions alone and recoding gaps as well. Gaps were
coded as single and independent events. Due to the low
variability and non-overlapping occurrence of gaps in the
data set, alignment, assessment of homology and subsequent coding of gaps was straightforward.
Analysis of population growth
As a powerful descriptive statistic of population growth,
Fu's Fs [74], was calculated using frequency distribution of
alleles for each region separately. Fu's Fs statistic compares
the number of alleles expected under the neutral coalescent in a constant sized population based on the neutral
mutation parameter and the size of the sample. In an
expanding population large negative values are expected
due to the excess of rare mutations. Populations after a
demographic expansion show a star-like phylogeny and a
unimodal mismatch distribution [15], where the peak
corresponds to the time of the expansion. The method of
Schneider and Excoffier [48] implemented in ARLEQUIN
3.0 [75] was used to fit observed and expected mismatch
distributions and to estimate parameters of a pure demographic and a spatial expansion model. The two models
are expected to produce different mismatch distributions
when the number of migrants between populations is not
large. Otherwise the two hypotheses can not be distinguished. In this study both models were considered to
complement genealogical methods that fail to detect signs
of a spatial expansion.

As an alternative, maximum likelihood estimation of the
exponential growth rate and historical θ was conducted.
The software LAMARC 2.0 [11] was used to get estimates
of growth rates for all European accessions of S. squarrosum and S. fimbriatum and for the Non-Atlantic clade of S.
fimbriatum. 30 short chains (20 000 steps each) and 2 long
chains (200 000 steps) with a sampling interval of 20

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/144

steps and a burn in period of 1000 and 10 000 respectively were applied.
The IM software [76,77] was used to fit the data to the Isolation with Migration model (IM). This model assumes
two populations connected by migration, which are
derived by the splitting of an ancient population. The IM
model estimates several parameters simultaneously and
therefore describes processes in natural populations in
their complexity. Populations were defined based on our
a priory knowledge of chloroplast lineages using the parsimony networks of each species [28]. Runs were conducted for the combined dataset including all three
nuclear regions sequenced. Initial runs with wide priors
were used to delimit the plausible range of priors. Since
indels of all three regions were informative, analyses have
been conducted both with and without indels coded.
Including gaps as additional characters did not change the
multilocus parameter estimates but narrowed their confidence intervals, however, only results without coding gaps
are shown. The infinite site mutation model of sequence
evolution was applied and loci were cut into non-recombining blocks. In case of the RAPDa sequences of S. squarrosum, only the microsatellite region was used. Each run
was introduced by a 100 000 steps long burn-in period.
Multilocus analyses were run using 5–7 parallel chains
under a linear heating scheme with a heating value of 0.05
– 0.005. Convergence of parameters and mixing of chains
were followed by visual inspection of parameter trend
lines and checking of ESS values. Analyses were run until
the lowest ESS value reached minimum 200. In all analyses population demographic changes were allowed.
