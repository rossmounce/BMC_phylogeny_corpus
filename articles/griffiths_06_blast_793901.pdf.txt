Abstract
Background: Chlamydiae species are of much importance from a clinical viewpoint. Their
diversity both in terms of their numbers as well as clinical involvement are presently believed to be
significantly underestimated. The obligate intracellular nature of chlamydiae has also limited their
genetic and biochemical studies. Thus, it is of importance to develop additional means for their
identification and characterization.
Results: We have carried out analyses of available chlamydiae genomes to identify sets of unique
proteins that are either specific for all Chlamydiales genomes, or different Chlamydiaceae family
members, or members of the Chlamydia and Chlamydophila genera, or those unique to
Protochlamydia amoebophila, but which are not found in any other bacteria. In total, 59 Chlamydialesspecific proteins, 79 Chlamydiaceae-specific proteins, 20 proteins each that are specific for both
Chlamydia and Chlamydophila and 445 ORFs that are Protochlamydia-specific were identified.
Additionally, 33 cases of possible gene loss or lateral gene transfer were also detected.
Conclusion: The identified chlamydiae-lineage specific proteins, many of which are highly
conserved, provide novel biomarkers that should prove of much value in the diagnosis of these
bacteria and in exploration of their prevalence and diversity. These conserved protein sequences
(CPSs) also provide novel therapeutic targets for drugs that are specific for these bacteria. Lastly,
functional studies on these chlamydiae or chlamydiae subgroup-specific proteins should lead to
important insights into lineage-specific adaptations with regards to development, infectivity and
pathogenicity.

Background
The Chlamydiales are clinically important intracellular parasites and endosymbionts of eukaryotic hosts, and cause a
wide spectrum of diseases in humans and animals [1].
Recently, the taxonomic classification of this group was
revised and currently contains at least 4 distinct families
(viz.Chlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, Parachlamydiaceae and

Waddliaceae) based on >90% 16S rRNA identity and a
common developmental cycle [2,3]. While chlamydial
infections are best known for the genitourinary, ocular
and respiratory infections they cause in humans, the
chlamydiae are also quite common in many wild and
domestic animals with potential for severe zoonotic disease [4]. The newly described chlamydial species Simkania

and Parachlamydia have also been found associated with
human respiratory infections, while Waddlia has been
implicated in abortion in bovines [5-7]. These revisions
reflect important changes in perceptions regarding
chlamydial diversity in line with recent discoveries of
novel animal isolates (Waddliae and Simkaniae) and more
strikingly of chlamydia-related endosymbionts or "environmental chlamydiae" (i.e. Parachlamydiae) infecting
free-living amoebae [8-10]. Free-living amoebae, important components of soil and water ecosystems, are being
increasingly recognized as vectors for various bacterial
human pathogens [4,7,11,12].
Species are currently recognized as belonging to the
Chlamydiales according to 16S and 23S rRNA similarities
and pathogenic traits [2]. As these organisms are antigenically and genetically diverse, it is important to develop
additional means to identify and distinguish them unambiguously from all other bacteria. The intracellular nature
of chlamydiae species has been a hindrance in understanding their genetics, physiology and development.
Hence, other means that can provide some insight in
these regards are needed. In recent years, the genomes of
several chlamydiae species have been sequenced including five Chlamydiaceae members (viz. Chlamydia (Chl.) trachomatis, Chl. muridarum, Chlamydophila (Chlam.)
pneumoniae, Chlam. caviae and Chlam. abortus [13-16] and
the environmental chlamydiae species Protochlamydia
amoebophila (Parachlamydiaceae) [11]. Until recently when
the P. amoebophila genome (formerly Parachlamydia
UWE25;[17]) sequence was released, the information for
chlamydiae-like organisms was practically non-existent,
and it was virtually impossible to establish a core set of
genes that are common to various Chlamydiales species.
The Protochlamydia genome (2.41 Mb) was found to be
about twice the size of various Chlamydiaceae species
(1.04–1.23 Mb) and it showed a number of important differences including the presence of a complete TCA cycle
and highly modified gene order [11]. The availability of
these genomes has made it possible to carry out comparative studies. Horn et al. [11] reported 711 open reading
frames (ORFs) or coding sequences that were shared
among all chlamydiae genomes. However, many of these
proteins have homologs in bacteria outside of the Chlamydiales and the proteins which were unique to only chlamydiae were not examined. Similarly, other studies which
have determined proteins common to all Chlamydiaceae
genomes also included peptides which were ubiquitous
among bacteria [13-16]. While the work of Kalman et al.
[18] revealed a number of potentially chlamydiae-specific
genes, these studies were based on only 2 genomes,
Chlam. pneumoniae and Chl. trachomatis, and the study was
carried out when sequence information for other bacteria
was limited.

Our recent work on comparative genomics is aimed at
identifying novel and distinctive molecular characteristics
of different groups of bacteria, including chlamydiae,
which can be used for their identification, classification as
well as genetic and biochemical studies [19-23] (see also
[24]). We have recently described a number of molecular
signatures consisting of conserved inserts and deletions
(i.e. indels) in widely distributed proteins that are distinctive characteristics of all available chlamydiae species and
are not found in any other bacteria [25]. In the present
study, we describe a different kind of taxonomic marker,
consisting of whole proteins that are specific for different
groups of chlamydiae species, which provides additional
powerful means for identifying these groups of species
and for understanding their evolution as well as physiological characteristics. In this work, we have carried out
systematic BLAST searches on all proteins or ORFs in the
genomes of a number of chlamydiae species to compile
profiles of proteins that are either uniquely shared by all
Chlamydiales-species or particular subgroups (family or
genera) within this phylum and can likely be used as distinct molecular markers for these groups. The study of
these chlamydial group specific proteins should prove
instrumental in the discovery of novel physiological characteristics that are uniquely shared by this important
group of pathogens.

Results
The present study was undertaken to identify unique proteins (or ORFs) which are found in the chlamydiae species
at various taxonomic depths. Kalman et al [18] have previously examined the presence of chlamydiae-specific
proteins in 2 sequenced genomes, Chl. trachomatis serovar
D and Chlam. pneumoniae. Their study documented a
number of proteins such as EUO, Gp6D, IncsB/C, LtuA/B,
a number of Pmps and hypothetical proteins, which were
specific for these species. However, because the number of
species examined was so small, it was unclear how
broadly these proteins were distributed among different
chlamydiae species. At that time there was also no
sequence information for the proteins from any chlamydiae-like organisms. Thus, based on this earlier study it
was unclear whether the identified peptides were distinctive of different Chlamydiales, or only particular subsets of
chlamydial species [18].
In order to identify chlamydiae-specific genes/proteins
that are present at different phylogenetic depths, each
ORF from the Chl. trachomatis and Chlam. caviae genomes
were individually BLAST searched against all available
databases. These species were chosen in order that
sequences from both the Chlamydia and the Chlamydophila
genera were represented in the searches. Results of the
BLAST searches were inspected to identify proteins where
either all of the observed hits were from other chlamydial

The Chlamydiales-specific proteins were identified by systematic BLASTP searches using Chl. trachomatis ORFs as probes, where the only significant
BLAST hits obtained were for chlamydiae species (see Methods section). Accession numbers of the query sequences are shown beside the Chl.
trachomatis loci (CT number) in the first column. The observed expected (E) values for various chlamydiae homologs as well as the first nonchlamydial hit in the BLAST results are given. E values of 0.0 indicate an extremely high degree of similarity between proteins sequences. The
second column describes the function and the size of each query protein (protein sizes are described for other chlamydiae only if they noticeably
differ from the query protein). Abbreviations are: C. tra, Chl. trachomatis; C. mur; Chl. muridarum; C. pne, Chlam. pneumoniae; C. cav, Chlam. caviae;
C. abo, Chlam. abortus; hypoth, hypothetical protein; Omc; Outer membrane cytochrome; OMP, outer membrane protein; Protochlam,
Protochlamydia; Pred., Predicted; PTMP, Possible transmembrane protein.

species, or where all hits showing significant homology to
the query protein (see Methods section) were members of
the Chlamydiales. These studies have resulted in the identification of large number of signature proteins, which are
uniquely found in chlamydiae species. Some of these proteins are present in all available chlamydial sequences
indicating that they are likely specific for the entire
Chlamydiales phylum. Other proteins were found to be
specific for only the Chlamydiaceae family or the two genera, Chlamydia and the Chlamydophila, which comprise
this family. Additionally, large numbers of proteins that
are unique to P. amoebophila were also identified. Most of
the identified chlamydiae-specific proteins or ORFs are
annotated as hypothetical, hence their functions remain
unknown. The genes for most of these proteins are scattered throughout the Chl. trachomatis and Chlam. caviae
genomes, however a number of these hypothetical proteins were also found in clusters. Although, it is not clear
whether these genes form operons, the presence of these

genes in clusters suggest that they could be involved in
related functions [26]. In the description of these proteins
that follows, the "CT", "CC" and "PC" part of the descriptors refer to the source of the original query protein
sequence from Chl. trachomatis (CT), Chlam. caviae (CCA)
and P. amoebophila (PC) genomes, respectively.
Chlamydiales-specific proteins
Proteins were considered Chlamydiales-specific if they
were present in all sequenced Chlamydia and Chlamydophila genomes, as well as P. amoebophila, but were absent
in all other bacteria. A total of 59 Chlamydiales-specific
proteins were identified (Table 1). Of these, 49 peptides
were annotated hypothetical indicating that these organisms have created new strategies allowing them to pursue
a parasitic lifestyle with a minimum gene complement.
Upon examination of the positions of various Chlamydiales-specific proteins within the Chl. trachomatis and
Chlam. caviae genomes, some of them were found to be

clustered on the chromosomes (those with adjacent CT
numbers). A few of these gene clusters are discussed
below.
Of the proteins annotated with a predicted function, only
two represent outer membrane proteins (CT131 and
CT546), which is surprising in light of large expansion of
genes encoding chlamydial polymorphic membrane proteins [15,27]. One of these proteins CT546 is in a cluster

with two other Chlamydiales-specific proteins (CT547 and
CT548), whose functions are not known, but they could
be involved in related functions [26]. Another important
Chlamydiales-specific protein that is involved in the formation of their cell envelope is CT443 (OmcB). OmcB is not
actually intercalated into a membrane. However, this protein is 4.4% cysteine, water-soluble and crosslinked to
MOMP and another protein OmcA (CT444) to form the
membrane complex [28,29]. OmcA and OmcB are two of

the very few chlamydiae-specific proteins that have been
functionally characterized [28,29]. The OmcA (CT444)
protein is 15% cysteine and so has homology only to proteins with high cysteine content. It has a classic SPII signal
sequence and is a proven lipoprotein [28,29]. OmcA and
OmcB are transcribed together [28,29] and the proteins
that are annotated as OmcA and OmcB are present in all
genome sequenced chlamydiae [13-16], including P.
amoebophila [11]. However, in BLASTp searches using
either the Chl. trachomatis or Chlam. caviae OmcA
(CCA00184) homologs as the query proteins (with or
without the low complexity filter), an OmcA homolog
was not detected in P. amoebophila although a protein
PC0617 (accession number YP_007016) has been annotated as its OmcA homolog. Hence, by the criteria used in
this study we regard CT444 as a Chlamydiaceae-specific
and not a Chlamydiales-specific protein, and we have
included it in Table 2. OmcA and OmcB annotation is
presently based on the high cysteine content of the predicted protein products, as the cysteine residues are the
basis for OmcA and OmcB function in Chlamydiaceae.
Because OmcA and OmcB annotation has changed many
times in the literature over the last 15 years [28,29], these
proteins are best located by BLAST search. It should be
mentioned that besides the Chlamydiales a homolog of
CT443 with low E value (3e-25) is also found in Rhodopirellula baltica (Table 1). The R. baltica protein (accession
number CAD72259) is larger in length (907aa) in comparison to the chlamydiae homolog and the sequence
similarity between these two proteins is mainly seen in the
C-terminal region. Importantly, the R. baltica homolog of

OmcB contains no cysteine, hence the possible significance of the presence of this homologous protein in R.
baltica (Planctomycetes) is presently unclear. A close relationship of chlamydiae to the Planctomycetes, which also
lack peptidoglycan in their cell wall, has been noted in
earlier studies [30,31]. Although such a relationship was
not supported in a later study [32], in view of the presence
of this commonly shared protein, it would be of interest
to reexamine the relationship between these groups based
on genomic sequences.
The finding of only a limited number of outer membrane
proteins unique to various Chlamydiales suggests that the
chlamydiae species most likely favour lineage-specific
mechanisms or surface receptors for interacting with their
different hosts rather than sharing a homologous system.
Cell surface interactions are not limited to the outer membrane proteins. The LysM domain is a widespread protein
module, which the available evidence suggests is a general
peptidoglycan-binding module in cell surface proteins
associated with cell wall degradation [33]. A LysM
domain protein (CT474) was found to be common in all
members of the Chlamydiales sequenced to date. The presence of this protein is intriguing as chlamydiae are not
known to contain detectable levels of peptidoglycan (PG),
despite housing genes for almost a complete PG biosynthetic pathway [34-36].
In addition to interacting with their hosts via cell surface
molecules, the chlamydiae are also known to utilize a type
III secretion system [37]. Genes encoding the basic type III

secretory apparatus have been identified in all sequenced
Chlamydia, Chlamydophila and Protochlamydia genomes
[11,13-15]. These surface projections are used to inject
chlamydiae-derived proteins into the host cytosol from
within the inclusion body [38]. Orthologs or paralogs to
effector proteins commonly found in other bacteria utilizing this apparatus have not been identified in chlamydial
systems although they are likely to be critical for transducing the signals required to modulate host cell function. A
type III secretion chaperone (CT274) was identified in all
Chlamydiales members, which may facilitate a number of
processes such as adhesion, cell signaling, transport and
the perpetuation of infection. Another Chlamydiales-specific protein, CT273, was found in a tight cluster with
CT274. The function of CT273 is not known, but it could
also play a role in type III secretion [26]. Both of these
genes lie in close proximity to CT271, another Chlamydiales-specific hypothetical protein which resides in the
chromosome in the opposite orientation of the above
mentioned ORFs.
Due to the reduction in metabolic capabilities of the
chlamydiae, it is likely that many different permeases
would be necessary for acquiring sufficient levels of different substrate molecules [18,39]. Members of the YjgP/
YjqE family are predicted integral membrane proteins
containing 6 transmembrane regions which are predicted

to function as permeases [40]. Although YjgP/YjqE proteins are distributed throughout the major domains of
life, a novel protein which is indicated to be related to this
family, CT838, is uniquely found in various Chlamydiales.
The iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin (Fd) is an electron
acceptor which participates in the redox-based metabolisms in plastids, mitochondria and bacteria [41]. A novel
predicted ferredoxin is uniquely present in various
Chlamydiales species (CT312) suggesting that it serves a
common evolutionary adapted function in these groups
of species.
Another Chlamydiales specific protein, EUO (CT446),
encoded by the euo gene (early upstream open reading
frame) is found just upstream of the 2 genes encoding
lysine-rich proteins Hc1 and Hc2 which are highly similar
to the eukaryotic H1 histone [42,43]. One study has
shown that Hc1 binds to DNA, inducing nucleoid compaction observed late in the chlamydial developmental
cycle when vegetative reticulate bodies differentiate into
the metablocially inert infectious particles known as elementary bodies [42]. The EUO protein, which is expressed
early in the chlamydial cycle, has been shown to specifically cleave the C-terminal portion of Hc1, initiating dissociation of DNA-Hc1 complexes and DNA
decondensation [42-44]. Little is known about the signals
that trigger the different events throughout the chlamydial

life cycle. However, the unique presence of the EUO protein (CT446) in various Chlamydiales species suggests a
common mechanism for chromatin remodeling.
The Chl. trachomatis locus CT583 encodes Gp6D, a
genomic paralog (31% similarity) of a plasmid-born virulence factor pGp6D [45]. Three of the four sequenced
Chlamydiaceae species (except Chlam. abortus) [2] have
been found to contain extrachromosomal DNA elements
(cryptic plasmids) believed to encode genes which might
play a role in pathogenicity and/or modulating virulence
[46]. P. amoebophila does not contain an extrachromosomal plasmid. The chlamydial plasmids encode 8 ORFs
of significance (>100 amino acids), and although 5 have
been characterized, the function of pGp6D is unknown

[45]. While the plasmid-borne pGp6D is only 102aa long,
the genomic Gp6D homolog found in all Chlamydiales is
more than twice that size (263aa). The high degree of similarity among plasmids from both Chlamydia and Chlamydophila species suggests that an ancestral plasmid was
acquired by the chlamydial lineage, perhaps before divergence of the two Chlamydiaceae genera. That plasmid-less
chlamydiae are rare suggests that plasmid loss is selected
against – that the plasmids do have a function specific to
this family, which is apparently absent in chlamydiae-like
organisms. All of the proteins in this category, which are
uniquely present in various Chlamydiales, have likely
evolved in the last common ancestor of all chlamydiae
and were subsequently passed on to various descendent
species through vertical descent.

The temporal expression patterns of these proteins is based upon the microarray analysis of Nicholson et al [63]. According to the microarray
profiles, significant differences were seen in the expression pattern of genes for these proteins at 4 different time points (6–24 hours post infection,
12–24 h.p.i., 18–24 h.p.i., and 24–36 h.p.i.) which correspond to different phases of the chlamydial developmental cycle where key phenotypic
changes take place. It is of interest that the majority of the temporally regulated Chlamydiales and Chlamydiaceae-specific genes are expressed
between 12–24 h.p.i. and 24–36 h.p.i. Such coordinate regulation suggests they play essential roles during these phases of the chlamydial cell cycle.
Other chlamydiae-specific proteins which are not listed in this Table were not found to show significant differences in their temporal expression in
the study by Nicholson et al. [63]. Abbreviation; h.p.i., hours post infection.

Chlamydiaceae-specific proteins
The proteins in this grouping corresponded to those
which were found strictly in species belonging to members of the Chlamydia and Chlamydophila genera, but
whose homologs were not detected in P. amoebophila.
Interestingly, among this category of proteins, 12 distinct
gene clusters were located (described below). Of the 79
Chlamydiaceae-specific proteins identified in this work
(Table 2), 60 were hypothetical. Those with predicted
function are discussed below.

Chlamydiae possess an intracellular developmental cycle
defined by the orderly interconversion of infectious, met-

abolically inactive elementary bodies (EBs) and noninfectious, dividing reticulate bodies (RBs) [1]. Only a few
stage-specific genes are known, including the two latestage genes encoding histone-like proteins. While chlamydial Hc1 (histone H1-like protein) is highly conserved
(CT446), Hc2 (a second H1-like protein) is less conserved
and variable in size (CT046) [42]. While both proteins are
thought to participate in DNA compaction, Hc1 is found
only in members of the Chlamydiales while Hc2 is found
uniquely in the Chlamydiaceae, to the exclusion of Protochlamydia. Indeed, there are no other homologs of this protein outside of the Chlamydiaceae found in BLAST searches
using Chl. trachomatis as the probe. LtuA and LtuB (CT377

The pair-wise amino acid sequence identity was determined for various chlamydial species for six C. trachomatis proteins that are specific for
Chlamydiales (A) and seven other proteins that are broadly distributed in bacteria (B). The numbers in these Tables indicate the length over which
the two sequences match each other as well as the % amino acid identity between the two sequences.
The abbreviations in protein names in part (B) are as follows: Ribo. HII, Ribonuclease HII; HthTR, Helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator; Cyt.

and CT080 respectively) are two other proteins, which are
uniquely shared by members of the Chlamydiaceae family.
Both of these proteins are not expressed until the RBs
begin to reorganize to EBs. These molecules do not bear
strong homology to any other known protein and their
functions are not known. The ltuB gene exhibits unusual
stability properties in that the 5' end appears to break
down, while the 3' end accumulates as a stable fragment
of about 240 bases [47]. It has been hypothesized that the
shorter ltuB RNA functions in someway in the late stage of
the chlamydial developmental cycle [47]. These unique
Chlamydiaceae specific proteins are likely playing distinctive stage-specific roles in the developmental cycles of the
Chlamydia and Chlamydophila genera. The ltuB gene is
found in close proximity to a cluster containing two other
hypothetical Chlamydiaceae-specific proteins (CT082 and
CT083).
A vast array of Chlamydiaceae-specific membrane proteins
have been identified in our study, including Major outer
membrane protein (MOMP or OmpA, CT681), polymorphic membrane protein PmpA (CT412) and PmpB
(CT413) which lie in a cluster, the putative outer membrane proteins OmpD (CT812), OmpE, OmpF, OmpG,

OmpH (CT869-CT872, which are clustered together on
the C. trachomatis chromosome) and OmpI (CT874). Several of these predicted outer membrane proteins have
recently been shown to be translated and localized to the
surface of the chlamydial outer membrane [27,48]. Outer
membrane proteins of microbial pathogens serve essential roles in engaging the host environment and can be
important immunotherapeutic targets [49]. Besides the
above outer membrane proteins, several other members
of the outer membrane complex were uniquely present in
all Chlamydiaceae species. Some of these e.g., porinb(CT713) or SRP (previously annotated as CrpA) (CT442)
[50], have been described as being immunogenic. PorB
(CT713) is the target of neutralizing antibody responses in
vitro and it lies in a cluster with another Chlamydiaceaespecific protein (CT712) of unknown function [51].
OmcA (CT444) is a well characterized chlamydial envelope-related protein (discussed in the previous section)
that is found to be Chlamydiaceae-specific in our work.
None of these proteins could be detected in the Protochlamydia by BLASTp searches using Chl. trachomatis proteins. Unlike the Pmps and Omps, chlamydial Inc
proteins are localized to the chlamydial inclusion membrane. Different Inc proteins share minimal primary

sequence identity with each other or with other proteins
in the databases making the assignment of specific function difficult. Studies of individual Incs have shown that
these peptides protrude from the surface of the inclusion
and may mimic or bind to host cell proteins that selectively manicure the surface of the inclusion to avoid
fusion with phagosomes or the host cell exocytic pathway
[38,52,53]. Two Inc proteins, IncB (CT232) and IncC
(CT233), were found to be unique to various Chlamydiaceae species. IncC is secreted by the type III secretion
system and is expressed early during the initial stages of
infection, and the gene for this protein lies adjacent to the
incB loci in a cluster [37,54].
Another Chlamydiaceae specific protein, YprS (CT392),
contains cysteine-rich complement-type repeats which are
implicated in ligand-binding. Based on these repeat
sequences, this protein bears some similarity to the insect
vitellogenin and yolk protein receptors (VgR/YPR) family
of proteins [55]. Many other Chlamydiaceae specific proteins of unknown functions are present in a number of
different clusters including CT142-CT144, CT288/CT289,
CT565-CT568, CT577-CT579, CT646/CT647, CT695/
CT696 and CT846-CT849.
Chlamydia- and Chlamydophila- specific proteins
The Chlamydia and Chlamydophila constitute two of the
genera within the Chlamydiaceae family [1,2]. Thus, it is
likely that unique proteins will be found exclusively in the
species belonging to these two groups of bacteria. The
genomes of two Chlamydia (Chl. trachomatis and Chl. muridarum) and three Chlamydophila species (viz. Chlam. pneumoniae, Chlam. caviae and Chlam. abortus) have been
sequenced. In our work, we have identified twenty unique
proteins for each of these two genera. A brief description
of these results is presented below.

Of the twenty Chlamydia-specific ORFs identified in this
work (Table 3), 16 were hypothetical. Those proteins of
predicted function were Incs, specifically IncD, IncE, IncF
and IncG (CT115-CT118). These 4 ORFs are transcribed
from a single operon in Chlamydia species and when
expressed, are not uniformly distributed [56]. Instead,
these peptides appear to be concentrated at discrete sites

in the inclusion membrane, primarily at sites of membrane-RB contact which can be visualized by both
immunofluorescence and electron microscopy [56].
Unlike IncD-G localization, chlamydial MOMP appears
to be depleted at the point of contact of RBs with the
inclusion membrane but is found throughout the rest of
the chlamydial outer membrane [56]. The asymmetric distribution of these proteins suggests that RBs exhibit polarity. The presence of such diversity of chlamydial
polypeptides in the inclusion membrane lends support to
the concept that chlamydiae actively control the interactions of the inclusion with the host cell to maintain a
highly specialized environment favourable to chlamydial
replication, in a lineage-specific manner. The other
Chlamydia-specific proteins are of unknown function and
some of these are arranged in 3 additional clusters, consisting of loci CT134/CT135, CT226-CT229 and CT357/
CT358.
Of the 20 Chlamydophila-specific proteins identified in
this work (Table 4), 9 are hypothetical while 11 have been
minimally characterized previously. Among this group,
four putative lipoproteins were identified, whose functions are not yet understood (CCA00246, CCA00575,
CCA00578, CCA00738). Additionally 6 proteins have
been described as putative membrane proteins in Chlam.
abortus (CCA00222, CCA00261, CCA00621, CCA00360,
CCA00361 and CCA00434), of which the last three are
thought to be localized to the inner membrane [16]. Loci
CC00360 and CC00361 are part of a cluster, which is the
only cluster found among Chlamydophila-specific ORFs.
This group also contained a serine-rich protein of
unknown function, annotated as YwbM (CCA00062),
which is absent from other chlamydiae as well as all other
organisms.
Protochlamydia-specific proteins
Protochlamydia amoebophila provides the only completed
genome of a Chlamydiales species that belongs to a family
other than the Chlamydiaeceae. The comparative genomics
studies by Horn et al. [11] determined which of the Protochlamydia proteins were not present in other sequenced
chlamydiae genomes. Although the list compiled by these
authors contained over 1000 ORFs, which were present in

analysis in order to determine Protochlamydia-specific proteins. A total of 445 Protochlamydial ORFs were identified,
and all were of unknown function. The listing of these

Cases of putative gene loss or transfer
The impact of gene acquisition and loss on bacterial
genome evolution is currently a central question in microbiology which remains unresolved. It was therefore of
interest to identify cases in which a gene appears to have
been lost or possibly transferred from chlamydial
genomes. Such cases were detected when all other species
of a particular chlamydial group (e.g. Chlamydiales,
Chlamydiaceae etc) contained a specific protein, with the
exception of one or only a few species. In all, 33 such cases
were identified among the different chlamydial groups
(Table 5). Interestingly, 10 proteins which were found in
the Chlamydophila and Protochlamydia were absent in the
two available Chlamydia species (CCA00154, CCA00168,
CCA00180,
CCA00266,
CCA00333,
CCA00495,
CCA00619, CCA00733, CCA00743, CCA00855). These
genes may represent incidences of gene loss in the Chlamydia, or possible gene transfer between the Chlamydophila
and Protochlamydia. Some phylogenies based on rRNA
support the early separation of Chlamydia [57,58]. However, indel analysis and some protein phylogenies indicate that the Chlamydophila are ancestral to the Chlamydia
[25]. Among the results, 6 proteins were found in all

Chlamydiaceae species with the exception of Chl. trachomatis (CCA00231, CCA00396, CCA00425, CCA00538,
CCA00827, CCA00910). Furthermore, 6 different proteins were found in all Chlamydiaceae species except for
Chlam. pneumoniae (CT049, CT050, CT051, CT214,
CT867, CT868). Also, 2 proteins were missing from
Chlam. caviae which were found in all other available

chlamydial species (CT244 and CT277), while 2 different
proteins were absent in Chl. muridarum which were
present in other Chlamydiaceae genomes (CCA00470,
CCA00259). One protein which was unique to all
Chlamydiales (CT550) and two proteins which were found
in various Chlamydiaceae (CT444.1 and CT702) were also
not found in the Chlam. abortus genome. One protein was

Page 14 of 20

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:14

found which was uniquely shared by all Chlamydia species
and Chlam. pneumoniae, to the exclusion of all other
Chlamydophila which may represent a lateral gene transfer
(CCA00075). A single protein was absent in Chlam. pneumoniae which was present in all other Chlamydophila
genomes (Chlam. caviae and Chlam. abortus) (CT785).
Since Chl. trachomatis and Chlam. pneumoniae were used as
probes, it is possible that other genes may have been lost
from these genomes which were not identified during the
searches. When the functions of these proteins are elucidated, these patterns of putative gene loss will likely shed
light on their importance in regards to the differences in
chlamydial biology, as well as why such gene losses may
have occurred. Another well-studied example of a Chlamydiales protein that is also present in various Rickettsiales as
well as various plants and algal plastids, consist of the
nonmitochondrial ADP-ATP translocases (CT065 and
CT495). Phylogenetic studies indicate that these genes
have been transferred from a Chlamydiales ancestor to the
other groups where these proteins are found [59,60].
Temporal expression of Chlamydiae-specific genes
The developmental cycle of chlamydiae is regulated at the
transcriptional level, although this regulation is not well
understood [61]. Determining the stage-specificity of different genes is important for understanding the development and function of different chlamydial species. In vivo
expression studies [62], in vivo transcription studies [47],
and transcriptosome studies [63] have been carried out.
The different lineage-specific proteins were compared
with microarray studies carried out by Nicholson et al.
[63]. Of all the group-specific proteins identified in this
work, 61 chlamydiae loci were determined to be regulated
in this manner, and fall into one of the following 4 categories as divided by Nicholson et al. [63]): early (6-24
hours post infection (hpi)), midlate I (12-24 hpi), midlate
II (18-24 hpi) or late (24-36 hpi). The results for the stagespecific expression of these proteins are summarized in
Table 6. IncC, a Chlamydiaceae-specific protein, is the only
identified ORF in this study to be expressed at the early
time point. Of the midlate I expressed genes, all the
Chlamydiales-specific proteins were hypothetical (CT053,
CT066, CT273, CT504, CT635, CT666, CT667, CT670,
CT734). Of the midlate I Chlamydiaceae-specific proteins,
LtuA (CT377) and PmpB (CT413), Pmp F-I (CT870-2,
CT874) were the only ORFs of known function, while others (CT289, CT372, CT618, CT668, CT671) remain to be
understood. Interestingly, only Chlamydiaceae-specific
molecules and 2 putatively lost/transferred genes were
found to be expressed during the midlate II phase. These
Chlamydiaceae-specific proteins consisted of the clustered
loci CT412/413, as well as OmpA (CT681) and OmpB
(CT713). The lost/transferred genes, CT049 and CT051,
were hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Many
temporally expressed chlamydiae-specific genes were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/14

found in the late phase of the developmental cycle. Of the
Chlamydiales proteins, OmcA (CT444) and OmcB
(CT443) were the only proteins of known function while
the remaining 4 were hypothetical (CT016, CT017,
CT181 and CT546). Several interesting proteins were
expressed late in the Chlamydiaceae-specific category
including HctB (CT046), LtuB (CT080), YprS (CT392),
SRP (CT442), the clustered loci OmcA (CT444) and
OmcB (CT443), PmpE (CT869) and the clustered loci
CT578/579 and CT082/083. All other differentially
expressed proteins during this phase were hypothetical
regardless of chlamydial lineage; Chlamydiaceae (CT005,
CT288, CT365, CT552, CT565, CT620, CT695, CT712,
CT848), Chlamydia (CT249, CT694) and lost/transferred
genes (CT050, CT214, CT702, CT868).
Divergence rates of Chlamydiae-specific proteins
We have also examined the sequence divergence rates for
chlamydiae-specific proteins as compared to more ubiquitous proteins to determine whether the former proteins
are evolving at a much faster rate. A relative measure of
this was obtained by determining the degree of sequence
conservation (as measured by % amino acid identity)
among different chlamydial species for a number of Chl.
trachomatis proteins that are either Chlamydiales-specific or
which are more broadly distributed among bacteria.
Results of these analysis for the two classes of proteins (i.e.
Chlamydiales-specific vs broadly distributed) are presented
in Tables 7A and 7B, respectively. As seen, in both cases,
Chl. trachomatis proteins exhibited highest identity (~75–
90%) to the Chl. muridarum homologs. This was followed
by the species from the Chlamydophila genus (41–62%
identity for the chlamydiae-specific proteins vs 60–80%
identity for the broadly distributed group) and the P.
amoebophila. The overall pattern that was observed was
very similar for the two sets of proteins, although the proteins that are more broadly distributed were found to
exhibit between 5–15% higher degree of conservation
(i.e. slower rate of divergence) in comparison to the
Chlamydiales-specific proteins.

Conclusion
Chlamydial species are among the 'high profile' pathogens of the 21st century [1]. These species are responsible
for a vast array of serious diseases in humans and animals.
Our understanding of the chlamydial diversity, host
range, environmental distribution, as well as clinical
involvement is presently limited and significantly underestimated. In this work, we have determined a large
number of proteins which are uniquely present in various
known chlamydiae species at different taxonomic levels.
The whole protein signatures that we have identified
include 59 ORFs that are unique to various known
Chlamydiales, 79 ORFs unique for the Chlamydiaceae family, 20 unique ORFs each for the Chlamydia and Chlamydo-

phila genera, as well as 445 ORFs that are presently
distinctive of the P. amoebophila (Table 8) The smaller
numbers of unique ORFs that are found in the Chalmydiaceae species in comparison to the P. amoebophila may
be related to their smaller genome sizes and also the fact
that former species grow in a more stable niche as compared to the latter species [11]. Also, 31 cases of putatively
lost genes from the different chlamydial genomes were
detected. The simplest and most parsimonious explanation for these shared unique signature proteins is that they
were introduced only once in a common ancestor of the
indicated chlamydial taxonomic groups located at different phylogenetic depths and then vertically passed on to
species that descended from that particular ancestor
[64,65]. In our analysis, we have also found some examples of chlamydiae-specific proteins which show sporadic
species distribution (e.g. present in only a few Chlamydia
and Chlamydophila species, but not in other species from
these genera). Such proteins could possibly arise from two
different mechanisms. First, it is possible that such genes
were introduced initially at a deeper phylogenetic level
(i.e. order or family) and then selectively lost in some species from the latter branching taxa. Alternatively, their distribution can be explained if the gene in question was
initially introduced in one chlamydia species and then laterally transferred to some others, as is the case for the nonmitochondrial ADP-ATP translocases [59,60]. The
numbers of such proteins is relatively small in comparison to the proteins that show taxa specific distribution.
We have recently described a number of molecular signatures consisting of conserved indels (i.e. inserts and deletions) in widely distributed proteins viz. RNA polymerase
α subunit, elongation factor-Tu, elongation factor-P, DNA
gyrase B and lysyl-tRNA synthetase, that are distinctive
characteristics of all chlamydial species [25]. The sequence
information for these proteins was also obtained from
Simkania negevensis, Waddlia chondrophila, and in a
number of cases for Neochlamydia hartmanellae, covering
all families within the Chlamydiae phylum. The unique
presence of these conserved indels in all chlamydiae species provides strong evidence that they are distinctive
characteristics of the entire Chlamydiales order. In phylogenetic trees based on a combined dataset of these protein
sequence as well as 16S rRNA, the traditional Chlamydiaceae species (i.e. Chlamydophila and Chlamydia) and the
chlamydiae-like organisms (viz. Simkania, Waddlia and
Parachlamydia) were found to form two distinct clades
indicating that these two groups have diverged from each
other very early in the evolution of chlamydiae. The
chlamydiae-specific proteins identified in the present
work provide additional powerful means for understanding and constructing a reliable phylogeny of the Chlamydiales. Based upon the shared presence of these
chlamydial-specific proteins, different taxonomic clades

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/14

or groups within the Chlamydiales could be identified. Figure 1 shows a tree indicating branch points marked by the
different chlamydiae group-specific proteins. In addition
to distinguishing P. amoebophila from other Chlamydiaceae
species, these proteins also support the distinctness of the
two genera (i.e. Chlamydophila and Chlamydia) within this
family. The phylogenetic inferences based on these proteins are in complete agreement with the relationships
observed within this phylum based on different proteins
as well as 16S rRNA trees [2,8,25]. The genes encoding this
set of peptides were likely acquired or evolved sometime
after the divergence of the Protochlamydia and the other
chlamydia-like organisms. Although sequence information for other chlamydiae (viz. Simkania and Waddlia) is
lacking at present, it is likely that many of the Chlamydiales-specific proteins identified here will also be found
in these species. Further, the clustering of the chlamydiaelike species in phylogenetic trees [2,25]suggests that many
of the proteins which are presently indicated to be specific
for P. amoebophila may also be found in the other chlamydiae-like organisms and they may provide unique molecular markers for these groups of species.
The analyses of bacterial genomes have indicated that a
substantial proportion of their gene repertoire is comprised of signature proteins or ORFans i.e., open reading
frames which have no known homologs and consequently no known function [64-66]. The mechanisms by
which such novel genes arise in different genomes are
presently not clearly understood and they have been discussed in other recent publications [67-69]. However, it is
possible that homologs of some of these genes/proteins
are also present in other bacteria but because of their
extensive sequence divergence significant similarity to the
chlamydiae homologs is not observed. One example
where this may be the case is that of the OmcA (CT444)
protein, which is listed as a Chlamydiaceae-specific protein
in this study (Table 2). An OmcA homolog is annotated in
P. amoebophila genome because it is cysteine-rich and
upstream of a large cysteine-rich protein, but it does not
show significant similarity to the Chlamydiaceae homologs
in BLASTp searches. Another protein that we have not
included in any of the Tables but is of interest is CT020
(signal peptidase I). The homologs of this protein are
highly conserved in all chlamydiae (E values ranging from
0 to 1e-101) and there is a large drop in E value from
chlamydiae to the first non-chlamydiae hit (E value 3e09), which is also indicated as signal peptidase I. The
sequence of this protein has again greatly diverged
between chlamydiae and non-chlamydiae species.
Although the presence of these proteins could be
explained by extensive sequence divergence, the possibility that they may have originated independently cannot
be excluded. Our survey of the divergence rates of proteins
that are either specific for the Chlamydiales vs those that

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:14

are broadly distributed in different bacteria, indicate that
Chlamydiales-specific proteins exhibit only slightly higher
divergence rate (~10%) in comparison to the more
broadly distributed proteins. This difference in our view is
unlikely to be generally responsible for the failure to
detect the orthologs of most of the chlamydial-specific
proteins in other species.
Most of the chlamydiae-specific proteins that have been
identified in the present work are of unknown function.
Many of these genes are present in distinct clusters in
genomes indicating that these clusters could comprise
functional units and the corresponding proteins may be
involved in related cellular functions [26,70]. The studies
aimed at understanding the cellular functions of the
Chlamydiales-specific proteins (i.e. their localization,
expression and function) should prove highly informative
for understanding chlamydial development, virulence
and infectivity. The studies on the Chlamydiaceae-specific
proteins should provide important insights regarding
characteristics that distinguish them from other chlamydiae families. Additionally, a large number of protein coding sequences that are specific for either particular genera
or different chlamydial species have been identified. The
functional studies of such proteins could provide important information regarding factors, which are presumably
responsible for their different properties such as tissue tropism and disease spectrum.
The identified chlamydiae-specific proteins also provide
novel biomarkers that should prove of much value in the
diagnosis of these bacteria and in exploration of their
prevalence and diversity. The identification and screening
of chlamydiae and chlamydiae-like organisms in the past
has relied on a small number of biomarkers (e.g. 16S and
23S rRNA, MOMP, GroEL protein, lipopolysaccharide
epitope Kdo, small cysteine-rich lipoprotein and 60-kDa
cysteine-rich protein) [71-74]. In this context, our identification of numerous proteins, which are uniquely found
in either various Chlamydiales, Chlamydiaceae, Chlamydophila or Chlamydia groups of species is of great interest and
they provide novel and valuable means for detection of
these groups of species. Many of these group-specific proteins are highly conserved and sequence alignment for
one Chlamydiales-specific protein (CT429) and one
Chlamydiaceae-specific protein (CT712) are presented in
Figure 2. The sequence alignments of both these proteins
contain many highly conserved regions that are suitable
for design of PCR primers that should enable successful
amplification of all species belonging to these groups.
Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies based upon different chlamydial-specific proteins provide another means
for diagnostic studies. Thus, based upon different groupspecific proteins that have been identified in the present
work, it should be possible to develop novel diagnostics

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/14

that are capable of distinguishing different groups of
chlamydiae species (viz. Chlamydia, Chlamydophila,
Chlamydiaceae and Chlamydiales) from each other with
high degree of accuracy.

Methods
Identification of Chlamydiae-specific proteins
In order to identify proteins which are chlamydiae-specific, systematic BLAST searches were carried out on different proteins in the genomes of Chl. trachomatis and Chlam.
caviae against all available sequences in the databases.
BLASTp searches were performed using each of the proteins or ORFs in these genomes as probes to identify all
other bacteria which contain related protein sequences
[75]. The searches were carried out using default search
parameters, as set by the protein-protein BLAST program,
which included the low complexity filter. The low complexity filter removes regions of query sequence which are
highly repetitive and which could lead to spurious high
similarity with unrelated proteins. The results obtained
were visually inspected for homologs showing specificity
to the chlamydiae with no other similar homologs present
in any other bacteria. This was done by analyzing expect
values (E values) for all proteins. The Expect value (E
value) represents the statistical significance of a hit in a
BLAST search. This number equates to the number of hits
that one would find by chance when searching a database
of a particular size. The E values depend upon the length
of the protein as well as the extent of sequence homology
that is observed with any given protein. The E values
which are very low (generally less than e-200) are indicated in the results obtained as '0'. In our extensive work,
the E value for the top hit (i.e. to the query itself) is generally found to be '0', when the query protein is of a length
longer than 325 aa. For proteins of smaller lengths, the E
value for the top hit has a finite value. The E value of top
hits may be slightly affected by the application of the filter
which effectively shortens the query length [75]. Proteins
were considered Chlamydiales-specific if all hits belonged
to the chlamydiae species, or if the next best non-chlamydiae hit had an expect value which was not significant and
could occur by chance. BLAST results with E values > 10-4
are in range where the observed similarity could occur by
chance. All such hits were examined for protein lengths to
ensure that it was similar to that of the query protein
before it was considered as a related protein. Occasionally
higher E-values were permitted in analysis when the
length of the query protein was small as with fewer characters the E values are higher and this often produce hits
with higher E-values (i.e. > 10-4) that are significant for the
study. It should be mentioned that BLAST searches can
sometime indicate misleading relationships, particularly
when no close relatives of the query species are in the
database [76]. However, in the present study where most
of the reported BLAST hits are for chlamydiae species, for

Page 17 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:14

which there are several published genome, such a possibility is highly unlikely. For all chlamydiae-specific proteins, E-values for each chlamydiae BLAST hit, as well as
the first non-chlamydial hit are reported here. Furthermore, the sizes of each protein in Chl. trachomatis (or
other genomes that were used as BLAST probes) are also
listed, and the sizes of other chlamydial homologs are
highly similar, unless it is otherwise stated. The same criteria were used for the detection of Chlamydiaceae-specific,
Chlamydia-specific and Chlamydophila-specific proteins.
For clarification purposes, the chlamydiae loci and accession numbers are given as reference for the different proteins. The genome of P. amoebophila was also examined in
this manner to identify proteins that are specific for Protochlamydia. Those genes which were found in all species
within a given group (i.e. Chlamydiales, Chlamydiaceae etc)
except for one or a few species, were considered to be due
to gene loss or lateral gene transfer.
Alignments of Chlamydiae-specific proteins and
percentage identity determination
The global alignments of Chlamydiales-specific protein
CT429 and Chlamydiaceae-specific protein CT712 were
carried out by first retrieving chlamydiae sequences from
the NCBI database [77] in FASTA format. ClustalX program [78] was then used to construct both alignments
using the default parameters. Pair-wise alignments of
sequences for determining percentage identity between
Chl. trachomatis proteins and those from other chlamydial
species were carried out using the ALIGN Plus 4 program
package (Scientific and Educational Software) using the
BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix [79] and the default parameters of the alignment program.

Analysis of temporal expression of Chlamydiae-specific
proteins
Lineage-specific chlamydial proteins were compared to
the microarray data of Nicholson et al. [63]. In that work,
the expression patterns of Chl. trachomatis genes were
divided into different stages: early (6–24 hours post infection), midlate I (12–24 hpi), midlate II (18–24 hpi) or
late (24–36 hpi). Proteins identified in that work which
exhibited at least 3-fold differences in expression patterns
at different stages, were then placed into one of these different groups. The information for stage-specific expression of chlamydiae-specific proteins was extracted from
this study.
