Abstract
Background: Due to its high polymorphism and importance for disease resistance, the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) has been an important focus of many vertebrate genome projects. Avian MHC organization is of
particular interest because the chicken Gallus gallus, the avian species with the best characterized MHC, possesses a
highly streamlined minimal essential MHC, which is linked to resistance against specific pathogens. It remains
unclear the extent to which this organization describes the situation in other birds and whether it represents a
derived or ancestral condition. The sequencing of the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata genome, in combination
with targeted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing, has allowed us to characterize an MHC from a
highly divergent and diverse avian lineage, the passerines.
Results: The zebra finch MHC exhibits a complex structure and history involving gene duplication and
fragmentation. The zebra finch MHC includes multiple Class I and Class II genes, some of which appear to be
pseudogenes, and spans a much more extensive genomic region than the chicken MHC, as evidenced by the
presence of MHC genes on each of seven BACs spanning 739 kb. Cytogenetic (FISH) evidence and the genome
assembly itself place core MHC genes on as many as four chromosomes with TAP and Class I genes mapping to
different chromosomes. MHC Class II regions are further characterized by high endogenous retroviral content.
Lastly, we find strong evidence of selection acting on sites within passerine MHC Class I and Class II genes.
Conclusion: The zebra finch MHC differs markedly from that of the chicken, the only other bird species with a
complete genome sequence. The apparent lack of synteny between TAP and the expressed MHC Class I locus is in
fact reminiscent of a pattern seen in some mammalian lineages and may represent convergent evolution. Our
analyses of the zebra finch MHC suggest a complex history involving chromosomal fission, gene duplication and
translocation in the history of the MHC in birds, and highlight striking differences in MHC structure and
organization among avian lineages.

Background
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a genedense genomic region within which many genes play a
role in vertebrate immune response. MHC Class I genes
encode surface receptors in most nucleated cell types
and facilitate immune responses to intracellular pathogens. MHC Class II genes also encode receptors but are
restricted to antigen presenting cells of the immune system where they play a role in combating extracellular
pathogens. After the binding of antigens, Class I and
Class II proteins present them to CD8 and CD4 T cells,

respectively. This presentation in turn triggers the adaptive immune response against the antigen. Polymorphism at MHC loci facilitates binding of a diversity of
pathogens and this evolutionary selection pressure is
thought to contribute to the high genetic variation in
MHC loci [1]. MHC genes are perhaps the most thoroughly studied example of adaptive molecular evolution,
representing a classic example of balancing selection
[2-4]. MHC genes have also played an important role in
studies of molecular ecology with MHC genotype influencing patterns of mate choice [reviewed in [5]], local
adaptation [6], disease resistance [7], and the expression
of sexually selected ornaments [8,9].

An MHC has been identified in all jawed vertebrates
studied to date. A core set of genes, including TAP,
TAPBP, TNXB and CENP-A, are syntenic to the MHC
across vertebrates that have been characterized [10-12].
Therefore, the presence of these genes, along with Class
I and Class II genes can be used to define the MHC
region. In addition to Class I and Class II genes, many
of the other genes in the MHC region also play a role in
immune response. Like Class I and Class II genes, CD1
genes (which are MHC-linked in the chicken but not in
mammals) play a role in the adaptive immune response.
CD1 molecules present lipid, glycolipid and lipopeptides
to T and NKT cells [13]. CD1 genes are in fact evolutionarily related to Class I and Class II genes [14-16].
Some MHC-linked genes encode proteins that interact
with MHC molecules. TAP1 and TAP2 genes, for example, are involved in the loading of peptides onto Class I
molecules for transport to the cell surface [17,18]. The
interaction between Class I and TAP is itself mediated
by TAPBP (tapasin).
While MHCs share many structural features there is
also tremendous variation in their organization among
species. Among birds, the chicken Gallus gallus has
been most intensively studied, and its MHC (also known
as MHC-B or B-complex) has a rather remarkable structure: a minimal essential MHC [19]. In contrast to
humans, in which the MHC spans four megabases (MB)
and consists of over 200 genes, the chicken MHC consists of only about 40 genes spanning only a few hundred kb on chromosome 16 [19,20]. In addition to the
MHC-B, chicken MHC Class I and Class II genes are
also present in a separate and unlinked cluster called
the MHC-Y (or rfp-Y) region [21-25]. Even when considering both the MHC-B and MHC-Y together, the
chicken MHC has fewer total genes, gene duplicates,
pseudogenes, repetitive sequences, and shorter genes
and introns than its mammalian counterparts.
Tight linkage of genes in the MHC may facilitate their
coordinated coexpression [19,23,26] and coevolution in
the chicken B-complex [27]. Furthermore, the suppression of recombination among MHC genes is thought to
contribute to the evolution of gene complexes coadapted
to particular pathogens and environments [26,28]. Interacting TAP and Class I genes are more closely linked in
the chicken than in mammals and these genes in particular are thought to coevolve in birds [24]. Some of the
strongest genotype/disease resistance correlations have
been identified in the chicken [for example, [29,30]] and
the simple architecture of the chicken MHC, with few
highly expressed MHC genes, likely contributes to this
pattern [19,23,24,26]. Due to the limited taxonomic and
genomic sampling of MHC regions in birds, however, it
remains unclear whether the streamlining of the MHC
reflects the broader trend of reduced genome size in

birds [31,32] and whether a small MHC represents the
ancestral condition for birds. Alternatively, a small
MHC may be a highly derived condition unique to the
biology of Galliforms.
The zebra finch genome, representing the taxonomically diverse Passerine clade (approximately 5,400 species), offers the opportunity to characterize MHC
structure in an avian lineage highly divergent from the
chicken. Molecular estimates of divergence between Passerines and Galliforms indicate that they diverged
between about 90 and 120 million years ago [for example, [33]]. Among birds, only two Galliform MHCs, the
domestic chicken and Japanese quail Coturnix japonica,
have been well characterized [34,35]. The MHC-B complex of another Galliform species, the turkey Meleagris
gallopavo has also recently been sequenced and appears
similar to the chicken in structure spanning about 200
kb [36,37]. MHC polymorphism surveys in passerines
suggest that their MHC may differ from the structure
seen in Galliforms [7,38-40]. Class IIB genes in particular appear to have been extensively duplicated in passerine birds, although little is known regarding the
expression of these genes. Initial attempts to characterize the passerine MHC regions using genomic sequence
data have uncovered pseudogenes and have revealed a
much lower gene density than the chicken [41-43]. The
number of expressed Class I genes in some songbirds
also appears greater than in the chicken [44]. None of
the core MHC-associated genes described above have
been characterized in passerines making it unclear
whether classical MHC regions have been sequenced. In
this study we used the draft assembly of the zebra finch
genome [45] in combination with targeted BAC sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping,
and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
analysis to describe the fundamental features of the
zebra finch MHC.

Results
Genome assembly analysis

In our scan of the zebra finch genome assembly we
found one or more homologous loci for 18 of 28 investigated chicken MHC related genes (Table 1). These
represent whole coding sequence (cds) or fragments of
genes (one or more exons). Since several of the genes
we queried had multiple loci in the zebra finch assembly, our set of sequences comprises a total of 22 manually curated MHC genes and eight putative pseudogenes
(sequences containing frame shift mutations or premature stop codons).
We found only one functional MHC Class I gene,
which was situated on chromosome 22_random (linked
to chromosome 22, but exact location and orientation
unknown). In addition, there are also 10 contigs

Genes are listed in order according to their organisation on chicken chromosome 16. Duplicated genes are given a numbered Locus ID if they appear functional.
Putative pseudogenes are marked with a ψ and given a lettered locus ID. Loci are classified based on sequence similarity such that identical sequences found in
multiple places in the genome assembly are given the same Locus ID. Where Ensembl IDs have been assigned these are also given. Three genes outside of the
MHC region but with a related function (CIITA, Ii, and B2M) are also included.

unincorporated into the genome assembly, and one contig on chromosome 16_random, that contain fragments
of Class I genes (Table 1). Sequence differences suggest
that these genes correspond to at least three different
pseudogenes. In the case of MHC Class IIB, we found
14 contigs on chromosome Un (unmapped genomic
region), and three hits on chromosomes 22_random and
7_random, containing parts of the cds. Four distinct
sequences with an open reading frame spanning exons
two and three appear to be functional.
The genome assembly suggests that some MHC-associated genes may not be as clustered in the zebra finch
MHC as they are in the chicken. Blec1, NKR and
TRIM27, for example, map to the Z chromosome in the
zebra finch genome assembly, while two CD1 loci map
to chromosome 12. Many of the other genes for which
we searched, however, mapped to chromosome UN or
were not found in the assembly (Table 1).
BAC screening, sequencing and gene prediction

We further characterized the zebra finch MHC by isolating and sequencing MHC-containing BAC clones. We
first identified 96 clones that hybridized strongly with a
probe targeted to exon 3 of an MHC Class IIB gene.
Four of these BACs were selected for sequencing (hereafter Class II clones). Because of the large number of
Class IIB positive clones, we conducted further screening using overgo probes targeted to five conserved genes
linked to the MHC across a diversity of taxa (Table 2;
Additional File 1). For this second screening, we

screened a different BAC library derived from the same
zebra finch individual as the whole genome sequence
(see methods). Positive clones were found for each of
the five genes: MHC Class I (n = 21), KIFC (n = 56),
CENP-A (n = 44), TAP2 (n = 14), and TNXB (n = 11).
Probes for three pairs of genes were found to cohybridize to individual BAC clones: MHC Class I and KIFC,
MHC Class I and TNXB, and TNXB and TAP (Table 2).
One BAC clone containing each of these three gene
pairs was chosen for 6× sequencing (hereafter Class I
clones). No clones were positive for both TAP2 and
MHC Class I, suggesting that these two genes are not
closely linked in the zebra finch as they are in the
chicken. CENP-A probes also did not cohybridize with
any of the other MHC genes, again indicating a lack of
close linkage observed in other species (Figures 1 and
2). We did not sequence any of the CENP-A positive
clones.
Each clone was assembled into multiple ordered contigs
(Table 3). The fragmented nature of the BAC assemblies
is expected given the coverage, but was exacerbated by
high repeat content (see below; Additional File 2).
Sequence analysis of two Class I clones, TGAC-86I22
and TGAC-167E04, revealed extensive sequence overlap
and thus were assembled together (Table 3). To improve
the assembly for the Class II clones we generated additional sequencing reads. Because the Class I clones were
derived from the same zebra finch as the whole genome
sequence, we were also able to incorporate sequence
reads from the whole genome sequencing effort to
improve the assembly of these BACs.
Most of the BAC assemblies contained at least a fragment of the genes expected based on the probes used to
identify them (Additional File 3). Class I clones contained a number of genes of interest. The assembly of
clones TGAC-86I22 and TGAC-167E04 contained
sequences with similarity to TAP1, TAP2, and TNXB
genes, and clone TGAC-102M22 contained KIFC,
DAXX, TUBB, Class I, and FLOT (Figure 1). Although
numerous genes separate KIFC and Class I genes in
chicken (Figure 2) we did not find evidence for these

genes within this BAC. DAXX, TUBB and FLOT have
not yet been identified in the chicken MHC but are
associated with the MHC in other vertebrates (Figure 1).
Because of gaps in the BAC assemblies complete coding
sequences could not always be reconstructed (for example, TAP2, Additional File 3). Although TGAC-86I22
hybridized with both Class I and TNXB probes,

sequencing only revealed a small region with similarity
to the Class I 3’ UTR in the great reed warbler (e-value:
8e-19, identities: 166/230; 72%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of this clone also identified a
stretch of a short exon 3 sequence (200 bp) that is identical to the expressed locus. The UTR region, however,
is distinctive in sequence from the expressed zebra finch

Figure 2 Genomic map of the Chicken MHC - B complex after Shiina et al. [20] compared to two sequence zebra finch Class I clones.
While KIFC and MHC Class I were identified in a single BAC, no orthologs of the intervening chicken genes were found in zebra finch. An MHC
Class I gene was not found in the TAP containing zebra finch clone despite the proximity of these genes in the chicken MHC. Following the
chicken naming scheme, class I MHC genes in chicken are denoted BF1 and BF1, and class IIB genes are denoted BLB1 and BLB2. Genes targeted
in the BAC screening are marked with arrows.

Class I 3’ UTR and BLAST searches of brain expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) and 454 sequencing data from
multiple tissues suggest that this locus is not expressed
[46]. Together this suggests that clone TGAC-86I22
contains an MHC Class I pseudogene.
Class II clones contained numerous predicted genes
with sequence similarity to zinc finger genes, as well as
gag and pol proteins (endogenous retroviral genes).
Aside from these and the expected Class IIB sequences,
however, only one other gene of interest was found. A
gene whose best blast hit matched the first four exons
of the turkey TAPBP gene (blastx e-value 6e-22) was
found in clone TGAA-157B03. Sequence conservation
mapping using Zpicture [47] of this clone and a previously sequence red winged blackbird Agelaius

phoenicius Class II region [48], highlight sequence similarities in the coding and UTRs of predicted genes, as
well as in some putative intergenic regions (Figure 3).
FISH mapping of BAC clones to zebra finch chromosomes

Single-color FISH mapping experiments revealed that
sequenced Class II BACs (TGAA-157B03, TGAA351E14, TGAA-323J16 and TGAA-47O03) hybridized to
several pairs of microchromosomes each (Figure 4),
likely due to the high repeat content in these clones (see
below). In contrast, sequenced Class I BACs (TGAC86I22, TGAC-102M22 and TGAC-167E04) each hybridized to one pair of small microchromosomes. Some
BACs also cross-hybridized to repeats in the centromeric and telomeric regions of macrochromosomes (for

example, Figure 4). Linkage analysis by dual color FISH
demonstrated that BACs TGAC-102M22 (containing
presumptive Class I, FLOT, TUBB, KIFC, DAXX), and
three Class II BACs (TGAC-323J16, TGAC-351E14 and
TGAC-47O03) shared hybridization to one pair of small
microchromosomes. Sequenced BACs TGAC-86I22 and
TGAC-167E04 (containing presumptive TNXB, TAP1,
TAP2) and 157B03 (Class II, TAPBP), however, hybridized to a different pair of small microchromosomes
(Figure 4). MHC genes are thus found in two linkage
groups on separate chromosomes in zebra finch.
To further test whether TAP and MHC Class I genes
are syntenic, we conducted five additional two-color
FISH experiments with BAC clones that were positive
for TAP2 and MHC Class I. While some MHC Class I
probes hybridized to multiple microchromosomes, in
only one case did we find colocalisation of Class I and
TAP2 probes (Table 4, Additional File 4). In this case,
MHC Class I probes hybridized to multiple microchromosomes, and the colocalisation occurred on the W sex
chromosome. It is therefore likely that this colocalisation is due to nonspecific binding, and the repetitive
nature of the avian W chromosome. In total we have

four cases in which TAP2 probes hybridize unambiguously to a single microchromosome and in all of these,
Class I maps to a different chromosome.
In order to identify the zebra finch chromosomes corresponding to the two zebra finch linkage groups, we performed dual-color FISH experiments in which one BAC
from one of the two linkage groups (TGAC-102M22 or
TGAC-86I22) was co-hybridized with a non-MHC BAC
with known chromosomal location (Additional File 5).
These experiments covered all microchromosomes for
which BACs are currently available (chromosomes 9 to
15 and 17 to 28). Neither of the two MHC linkage
groups mapped to these chromosomes, suggesting that
both microchromosomes to which the MHC BACs
mapped may indeed correspond to parts of zebra finch
chromosome 16, the only chromosome for which we do
not have known BACs.
Polymorphism survey via RFLP/Southern Blot

To test our findings on the numbers of Class I and
Class IIB genes, and as a preliminary survey of gene
number and intraspecific polymorphism, we conducted
a RFLP analysis using probes targeted to these loci.

Figure 4 FISH mapping of BAC clones. A) Single color FISH mapping of TGAC-157B03 reveals extensive cross-hybridization across
chromosomes. Similar results were observed for other Class II clones presumably as a result of their high repeat content. B) Lack of
cohybridization between Clones TGAC-102M22 and a known chromosome 22 BAC indicates that TGAC-102M22 is not on chromosome 22 as
indicated by the genome assembly. C) Dual color FISH of TGAC-86I22 (red) and TGAC-167E04 (green) indicating cohybridization of these clones,
a result also supported by sequence analysis. These clones were assembled together, and contain g-filamin, TNXB, TAP1 and TAP2 genes. D)
Clones TGAC-102M22 (red) (contains MHC Class I, FLOT, TUBB, KIFC and DAXX) and TGAC-86I22 map to different chromosomes. Key components
of the classical MHC therefore map to different chromosomes in the zebra finch genome.

There are clearly a larger number of RFLP bands for
MHC Class IIB (range = 12 to 27) than for Class I
(range = 2 to 4) and this also suggests that there are
more Class IIB genes than Class I genes in zebra finches
(Figure 5). This difference in gene number is not likely
due to differences in the sequence similarity of probe

and target for Class I and IIB probes as we would
expect that the longer Class I probe (280 bp) should
hybridize to a larger number of fragments than the
Class IIB probe (207 bp). We repeated this hybridization
twice using different Class I and II probes (data not
shown). For MHC Class I there are two to four RFLP

1 to 7) and two to three fragments in the zebra finches
from Sweden (ind 8 to10). For MHC Class IIB there are
12 to 20 RFLP fragments in the zebra finches from the
US and as many as 27 fragments in the three zebra
finches from Sweden.
Comparative analysis of MHC genes

In order to explore the evolution of the compact avian
MHC structure observed in chicken, we estimated the
average gene density in quail, chicken, zebra finch and
human. Interestingly, the estimated gene density in the
zebra finch is similar to that in humans, and distinctive
from both quail and chicken (Figure 6). Repeat content
also differs markedly between the chicken MHC region
and the zebra finch BACs. Long interspersed nuclear
elements (LINEs) occur at frequency of 0.07 per kb in
chicken versus 0.02 per kb across the 739 kb of zebra
finch BAC sequence. Long terminal repeat (LTR) content, specifically in the form of ERV1 elements, was
exceptionally high in zebra finch Class II sequences,
occurring at frequency of 0.14 per kb, whereas the
chicken MHC is depauperate in LTR at 0.01 per kb
(Figure 7). Zebra finch Class I clones sequenced here
more closely resemble the chicken content, but still had
higher LTR content (0.02 LTR/kb).
To examine the evolutionary relationships among
MHC genes, we placed exons 2 and 3 of four putatively functional zebra finch MHC Class IIB sequences
in a phylogenetic context by comparing them with
other passerine sequences from GenBank. Exon 2 of
the Class IIB gene encodes the protein that forms the

peptide binding region of the Class II protein, and
exons 2 and 3 have been amplified and sequenced in a
diversity of bird taxa. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses
using both exons concatenated together grouped three
zebra finch sequences in a highly supported clade (Figure 8). Using outgroups to the passerine sequences
(data not shown), a divergent zebra finch locus was
placed basal to all passerine sequences, between passerine and non-passerine sequences. Thus for analyses
of passerine sequences we rooted the tree at this zebra
finch sequence (Figure 8). We also analyzed exons 2
and 3 separately. These results reflect previously
described differences among the exons [for example,
[38]] so are not described further here. Phylogenetic
analyses of exon 3 sequences from MHC Class I also
placed zebra finch Class I sequences in a strongly supported clade (Additional File 6).
Passerine sequences were analyzed using Phylogenetic
Analysis using Maximum Likelihood (PAML) [49,50], to
test for the influence of positive selection on MHC
Class I exon 3, and Class IIB exon 2. Two pairs of models were compared in CODEML, M1 (nearly neutral)
versus M2 (positive selection) and M7 (b) versus M8 (b
and ω > 1) [49,50]. For Class I exons both tests indicate
that models incorporating positive selection provide a
better fit to the data than do neutral models (M1 vs.
M2, 2ΔlnL = 270.5, P = 0.00; M7 vs. M8, 2 ΔlnL =
271.7, P = 0.00). Bayes Empirical Bayes analyses [49]
identified 10 sites with ω > 1 (posterior probability >
0.95; see Additional File 6). Analyses of MHC Class IIB
exon 2 also suggest a strong influence of positive selection (M1 vs M2, 2 ΔlnL = 540.4, P = 0.00; M7 vs M8,
2ΔlnL = 511.0, P = 0.00) with 21 sites with ω > 1 (Figure 8). In both Class I and Class IIB, these sites correspond well with the peptide binding region (PBR) from
the human MHC [51,52] and with selected sites identified in birds of prey [53,54].

Discussion
We have provided here a detailed characterization of the
zebra finch MHC. There is clear cytogenetic evidence
that MHC genes map to at least two different chromosome pairs in the zebra finch. If the chicken MHC
represents the ancestral state, the situation in the zebra
finch may have arisen through fission of chromosome
16 or a translocation of part of it to another pair of
microchromosomes. The hypothesis of chromosomal fission is consistent with the finding that the MHC BACs
did not map to zebra finch chromosomes 9 to 15 or 17
to 28, and that the microchromosomes recognized by
these probes were small.
The finding of MHC genes on two chromosomes in
the zebra finch is particularly intriguing because TAP
genes map to one of them, whereas an expressed Class I

Class II probe. Results from Class I analysis suggest a minimum of two loci whereas Class II probes indicate a very large lumber of loci (mean

gene (and a number of other MHC-associated genes)
maps to a distinct chromosome (Figure 1). This finding
is unexpected because TAP and Class I genes functionally interact and are syntenic in most MHCs studied to
date including both chicken and humans [reviewed in
[10], but see [55,56]]. In chicken this tight linkage is
thought to result in coevolution between TAP and Class
I genes and strong correlations between MHC haplotype
and disease resistance [reviewed in [57]]. TAP genes in
mammals, while generally syntenic, are not as closely
linked to Class I as they are in Galliform birds. The
separation of TAP and Class I in mammals has been
hypothesized to have resulted in their evolutionary independence and in turn led to high levels of duplication
and divergence in Class I genes [56]. This dissociation is

perhaps most clearly illustrated by the tammar wallaby
Macropus eugenii in which Class I sequences have been
found dispersed across seven chromosomes [56]. The
separation of TAP and Class I genes in the zebra finch
may therefore represent convergent dissociation of these
genes.
An alternative explanation for the separation of Class I
and TAP genes in the zebra finch is that the regions
sequenced here could represent duplication blocks. The
sequenced Class I locus could even be related to the
MHC-Y region of chicken. Phylogenetic analyses of
zebra finch Class I and chicken Class I (MHC-B and
MHC-Y), however, suggest that our sequenced Class I
gene is not the ortholog of a chicken MHC-Y gene as
chicken (including MHC-Y) and zebra finch sequences

are reciprocally monophyletic (Additional file 6). It is
also possible that a second Class I gene resides on the
same chromosome as TAP1 and TAP2 and therefore,
that Class I and TAP are actually syntenic. In fact, a
sequenced BAC was positive for both MHC Class I and
TNXB; Another four clones were positive for TNXB and
TAP2 suggesting a possible linkage between these MHC
Class I and TAP2. Based on a divergent sequence and a
lack of expression, we suggest that this Class I sequence
is a pseudogene. Even if it were not a pseudogene, TAP
and this Class I gene would be much more distantly
located in zebra finch than they are in chicken and
would be free of the linkage seen in the chicken. The
whole genome assembly, digital expression profiling [46]
and EST data suggest only one full-length, expressed,
Class I gene. It is also possible that there is a second set
of TAP genes that we have not sequenced. Given the
extremely low coverage of TAP genes in the genome
trace archives (for example, only one read covering
TAP2), it is unlikely that TAP genes have been duplicated. FISH mapping of five pairs of putative TAP2 and
MHC Class I clones further supports the lack of synteny
among TAP and Class I genes (Table 4). Together these
findings suggest that the Class I and TAP are not linked
in the zebra finch. In addition to Class I loci identified
in the BACs, we identified three distinct Class I

sequences that appear to be pseudogenes. One of the
putative pseudogenes only contains exon 2, one only
contain exons 4 to 6, while the third contains exons 1
to 3. Because the probes used in RFLP analyses target
exon 3 only one of these pseudogenes would be
reflected in the RFLP banding patterns. While the zebra
finch appears to possess only one expressed Class I
locus, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceous, another passerine species, expresses multiple Class
I loci [44]. An intriguing possibility is that the dissociation of TAP and Class I in ancestral passerines preceded
the radiation of Class I genes in some passerine groups
[44] as has been suggested for the wallaby [55,56].
Class IIB genes in zebra finch are highly duplicated as
evidenced by the genome assembly, BAC sequencing
and the RFLP analysis. We identified 10 distinct Class
IIB sequences in the genome assembly (Table 1) some
of which appear to be pseudogenes. These findings corroborate previous surveys of Class IIB variation in other
passerine birds [40,58,59]. Another feature of zebra
finch Class IIB regions is their high LTR content, mostly
in the form of ERV elements (Figure 7). The finding of
multiple zinc-finger genes and retroelements in proximity to Class II genes was also presaged by multikilobase MHC sequences from red-winged blackbirds,
which showed a similar pattern [43,48]. Given the large

number of Class IIB duplicates and pseudogenes we
speculate that duplication may have been related to the
presence of retroviral sequences. Thus, the passerine
MHC Class IIB may have been invaded by endogenous
retroviruses much like the primate Class I [28]. Endogenous retroviruses have also been implicated in the
duplication of wallaby Class I genes and their spread
across multiple chromosomes [56].
Given the FISH mapping results and the whole genome assembly, MHC genes appear to be located on
even more than two chromosomes. The genome
assembly suggests that homologs of chicken MHC
genes have been dispersed in the genome. There are at
least three possible explanations for this: 1) There have
been chromosome rearrangements for these genes
between the chicken and zebra finch; 2) The contigs
containing these genes have been misplaced in either
the chicken or the zebra finch genome assembly; 3)
The zebra finch gene identified is not the true ortholog
of the chicken gene. Chicken MHC genes placed on
different chromosomes in the zebra finch assembly
compared to the chicken include MHC Class I
(Chr22_random), CD1 and CD2 (Chr12), and NKR,
Blec1 and TRIM27 (ChrZ) (Table 1). The MHC Class I

gene placed on chromosome 22 and its surrounding
region in the assembly is essentially identical to that in
our sequenced BAC. This sequenced BAC did not
cohybridize with two known chromosome 22 BACs
(Figure 4B; Additional file 5), so the placement of this
Class I region on chromosome 22 appears to be an
assembly artifact. Rather, the FISH mapping results
suggest that these genes are in fact on chromosome 16
as they are in chicken. The genome assembly data
underlying the placement of CD1 genes on chromosome 12 is also somewhat uncertain, with no BAC-end
sequences linking contigs containing these genes to
chromosome 12. Further work will be needed to test
whether the genome assembly has properly placed
these genes. Contigs containing, Blec1, NKr and
TRIM27, however, are linked by BAC-end sequence
pairs to the Z chromosome, making it likely that these
are appropriately placed in the assembly.
A number of core MHC-associated genes including
DMA, BG, C4, TNXB, TAP2 and TAPBP are conspicuous by their absence in the zebra finch genome assembly (Table 1). There is no reason, however, to believe
that these are truly absent in the zebra finch as they are
present in a wide range of other vertebrates and are

GenBank. The root of the tree was placed at a divergent zebra finch lineage (TAGU 2) based on a larger analysis in which non-passerine
sequences were included. TAGU 1 to 4 correspond to loci 1 to 4 in Table 1. B) Predicted amino acid sequences of the second exon of four

crucial for MHC function. More likely, these genes cannot be identified due to the incomplete assembly of
zebra finch chromosome 16. TAP2, TAPBP and TNXBlike sequences, for example, were found in the BAC
sequences but are not represented in the genome
assembly. Many of the zebra finch MHC-related genes
identified in the genome scan map to linkage groups in
chromosome unknown. This again appears to be a result
of the incomplete assembly of chromosome 16. The
problem of assembling chromosome 16 is likely due in

part to the highly duplicated MHC region in combination with the high repeat content in these regions.
BAC sequencing revealed two genes, FLOT and
DAXX, that are MHC-linked in non-avian vertebrates
[10,11], but have not been described in chicken. The
relatively close linkage to MHC Class I and II genes of
FLOT, TUBB and DAXX in the zebra finch is actually
more similar to the organisation in some teleost MHCs
[for example, [12]] than it is to either Xenopus or the
human MHC, where DAXX is physically distant from

Balakrishnan et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/29

the FLOT and TUBB genes. Chicken chromosome 16,
like the zebra finch, is not well assembled at this point
so it is possible that these genes will be found as the
chicken assembly continues to improve.
Phylogenetic analyses highlight the clustering of Class
IIB loci by species rather than by orthology relationships, suggesting a history of concerted evolution, at
least on portions of the genes [38,60,61]. We did, however, identify a unique Class IIB lineage that falls at the
base of all other passerine Class II sequences. This
appears to be a novel locus that has not previously been
sequenced in birds and it is unknown whether it is
expressed and/or polymorphic. Further analysis will be
needed to clarify the role of this locus but its discovery
underscores the utility of genomic approaches (rather
than PCR amplification using degenerate primers) for
characterizing MHC genes in birds. Tests of selection
using zebra finch and other passerine MHC sequences
support a strong role of selection in shaping patterns of
polymorphism in the peptide binding region of Class I
and Class II genes in passerines. The specific sites under
positive selection are similar to those previously identified for other bird groups [53,54] and they closely
match the peptide binding regions in humans [51,52].
High variability among individuals in RFLP banding patterns support the prediction that MHC Class IIB genes
are influenced by balancing selection.
Among birds, there is tremendous variation among
lineages in the number of MHC genes. In quail [34],
red-winged blackbird [42,48] and the zebra finch, there
are multiple Class II genes. Most non-passerine species,
in contrast, appear to have only between one and three
loci [60,62,63]. Given the derived phylogenetic position
of passerines [64], these patterns imply that in terms of
Class II genes, a minimal MHC may be ancestral for
birds [60,62]. Because of the extensive variation among
avian lineages in the number of Class I genes [for example, [34,44,65]], it remains unclear what the ancestral
condition for Class I genes might be.

Conclusions
We have made significant progress towards the understanding of the complex structure of the zebra finch
MHC, the first such analysis from a representative of
the diverse passerine radiation. Although the genome
assembly and BAC sequencing are fragmentary, the
zebra finch appears to possess an MHC differing markedly from previously described avian MHCs. The genomic architecture of the zebra finch MHC highlights the
dynamic nature of MHC evolution. The evidence for
gene duplication, pseudogenization and the distribution
of MHC genes on multiple chromosomes in the zebra
finch are particularly striking when measured against
the compact MHC of the chicken present on a single

Page 14 of 19

chicken microchromosome. Further genomic characterization of MHCs from a broader diversity of birds, as
well as further refinement of the zebra finch MHC
assembly, will continue to refine our picture of MHC
evolution in birds.

Methods
Genome assembly scan

We searched the zebra finch genome assembly extensively for MHC genes using a variety of methods.
Chicken MHC genes and proteins were downloaded
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) website and blasted (blastn and tblastn) against
the published version of the zebra finch genome and the
available EST library and MHC containing BACs (see
below). Since many of the genes of the MHC are diverging quickly we used rather relaxed blast settings (high
minimum e-value and low w). For especially tricky multigene families and genes not found using the regular blast
searches we constructed alignments using several vertebrate species and searched using conserved regions only.
We also constructed a hidden Markov model of conserved features using the program HMMER 2.3.2 [66]
and used the output consensus sequence in an additional
blast search. The HMMER model was also used with the
program Wise2 [67] in an additional attempt to identify
corresponding exons in the zebra finch genome.
Regions in the zebra finch genome with significant
hits on one or more chicken MHC exons were aligned
to each of the chicken exons from the target gene using
ClustalW [68] and checked manually in BioEdit [69].
Zebra finch sequences matching chicken MHC exons
were extracted and complete or partial coding sequences
of genes were blasted (blastx) back against the chicken
RefSeq protein database. Hits with a best reciprocal
blast with an e-value of less than 1e-05 against the target gene in chicken were considered to be orthologs.
Most of the genes were also identified using automated annotation of the zebra finch genome. In these
cases we have included the accession numbers for the
ENSEMBL entries (Table 1). These results, however,
were not available to us at the time we conducted our
analysis and have not affected our gene finding. Instead
our manual annotation provides support for many of
the genes identified using the computerised ENSEMBL
annotation [70]. Also note that in some cases there are
slight differences between the sequences presented here
and the sequences with the provided ENSEMBL IDs.
BAC screening, sequencing and gene prediction

We characterized the zebra finch MHC by isolating and
sequencing MHC-containing BAC clones. To generate a
probe for MHC ClassIIB we PCR amplified exon 3
using degenerate primers described by Edwards et al.

Balakrishnan et al. BMC Biology 2010, 8:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/29

[71]. Probes were then radioactively labeled and hybridized with eight BAC filters following previously
described protocols [72]. BAC filters were purchased
from the Arizona Genomics Institute http://www.genome.arizona.edu. Clones from the AGI library are listed
by names with the TGAA prefix. Positive clones were
fingerprinted and four clones representing two pairs of
putatively overlapping clones were sequenced to 6× coverage using an Applied Biosystems 3730 sequencer (Foster City, CA, USA). Because MHC Class IIB clones had
apparently high repeat content, additional plasmid end
reads were generated to improve the assembly.
We conducted additional screening using oligonucleotide probes targeted to five conserved genes linked to
the MHC across a diversity of taxa (Table 2). This second round of screening was conducted using a different
BAC library (TGAC), available through the Clemson
University Genome Institute because this library was
generated using DNA from the same individual zebra
finch as the genome itself. Screening was done using
previously established protocols [73]. Oligos were typically 24-mers (Supplemetary Table 1) overlapping by 8
bp to generate a radiolabeled double-stranded 40-mer.
These 40-mers were then pooled by gene and hybridized
against the filters to identify BACs containing the specific gene sequence. Once the clones were identified, they
were fingerprinted and end sequenced to confirm their
location in the region. For these BACs we incorporated
overlapping reads from the genome into the final BAC
assemblies to increase contig length and improve ordering. Individual BAC assemblies were created with
PHRAP [74] and assessed for contiguity. BAC assemblies were then manually examined for misassemblies
and if they were found, the data was sorted as best as
possible by using forward and reverse pair data. Consensus sequence blocks for each clone were then ordered
and subjected to further analysis.
We used FGENESH [75] and GENSCAN [76] to predict genes contained within the BAC sequences. FGENESH uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) for gene
prediction, and we used both human and chicken databases for gene prediction. Predicted amino acid
sequences were blasted (blastp) against the non-redundant protein database in Genbank. Predicted genes with
strong blast hits were given putative gene names, and
were visually inspected to further confirm orthology
with known genes. We assessed repeat content of clones
using RepeatMasker [77] and chicken repeat libraries.

hybridization buffer and chicken genomic DNA or herring sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Dorset,
UK) in a 1:2:1 ratio, applied to slides and sealed under
cover slips. Hybridization was carried out in a humidified chamber at 37°C (overnight for same-species hybridizations and for three days for cross-species
hybridizations (see below)). Post-hybridization washes
for same-species hybridizations consisted of 50% formamide in 2 × SSC for 2 × 10 minutes at 37°C; one minute
in 2 × SSC with 0.1% Igepal at RT; 15 minutes in 4 ×
SSC with 0.05% Igepal at RT; 25 minutes in 4 × SSC
with 0.05% Igepal and 2% BSA at RT. For cross-species
hybridizations, the first washing step was modified (10%
formamide in 2 × SSC for 2 × 10 minutes at 30°C).
Probes were detected with 1:200 streptavidin-Cy3
(Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK), in 4 × SSC, 0.05% Igepal, 1.25% BSA, plus 1:200 FITC-anti-digoxigenin
(Amersham) for dual-color experiments, for 35 minutes
at 37°C. Excess detection mix was removed by washing
the slides in 4 × SSC, 0.05% Igepal for 3 × 3 minutes.
Slides were counterstained using Vectashield with DAPI
(Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were viewed
using an Olympus BX-61 epifluorescence microscope
equipped with a cooled CCD camera and appropriate
filters. Images were captured using SmartCapture 3
(Digital Scientific, Cambridge, UK).
We also performed cross-species FISH experiments to
investigate whether MHC-containing chromosomes in
the zebra finch correspond to chicken chromosome 16
(Additional file 7). These experiments involved co-hybridization of zebra finch BACs TGAC-102M22 or TGAC86I22 in combination with chicken BAC WAG65G9
(containing genetic markers LEI0258 and MCW0371) to
chicken and zebra finch chromosomes. Unfortunately,
none of these experiments gave unequivocal evidence
for colocalisation of chicken and zebra finch MHC
BACs and therefore the data are not shown.

identical parallel agarose gels that were transferred to

labeled zebra finch class I and II probes, respectively (for

Comparative analysis of MHC genes

We estimated and compared gene density, across three
avian lineages (chicken, quail and zebra finch) and the
human MHC. To describe the human MHC, gene coordinates for protein coding genes were extracted from
Ensembl [70] using the extended version of the human
MHC map [79] as a template. To make an appropriate
comparison among species, gene sets from human MHC
were defined based on the flanking genes SCGN and
SYNGAP1, but excluding pseudogenes, histones, tRNAs,
vomeronasal and olfactory receptors. These genes were
excluded because of their absence in the chicken MHC
[20] and/or their lack of synteny with other MHC gene
clusters in the zebra finch. For the chicken MHC gene
set was based on the chicken extended MHC haplotype
[20] and include the MHC-Y region. Gene coordinates
were extracted using the latest annotation and assembly
published in NCBI. For the quail MHC, extended regions
have not been characterised and could not be included
[35]. We calculated gene density by dividing the total
number of genes by the total extent of the MHC region
as defined above. Because zebra finch genes were often
unmapped, and because of numerous pseudogenes, we
approximated gene density for zebra finch using the two
Class I BACs which appear to be a classical MHC region.
Inclusion of all seven of the BACs also does also not alter
the conclusions of this analysis. Although the zebra finch
MHC assembly remains fragmented, the patterns

revealed by this analysis highlight marked differences
between zebra finch and chicken.
Phylogenetic analysis and tests for selection

Class I (exon 3) and Class IIB (exons 2 and 3) sequences
were downloaded from GenBank (Accession #s given in
Figure 1). Nucleotide sequences were aligned using
MUSCLE [80] and then imported into Se-Al [81] for
manual verification. Sequences were translated into
amino acids and then adjusted by eye. All phylogenetic
analyses were done using MrBayes v 3.1.2 [82]. For
Class IIB we analyzed the two exons separately (not
shown) and in a combined analysis where the data were
partitioned by exon, and models were fitted to each
codon position independently. To determine an appropriate root for passerine MHC sequences we first conducted analyses across all birds (including raptors,
galliforms, and shorebirds, not shown here). For use in
tests of selection, we conducted further analyses using
only passerine sequences. MrBayes was run for 2.4 million generations, with 400,000 generations discarded as
burn-in. One thousand sampled trees were then used to
generate consensus trees and posterior probabilities.
Trees from MrBayes and sequence alignments were analyzed in PAML [49,50] to test for evidence of selection
acting on sites in the alignments. We used CODEML
and tested two pairs of models using likelihood ratio
tests. We tested the M1 model of nearly neutral evolution versus the M2 model of positive selection. We also
tested the M7 model with the M8 model in which ω
(dN/dS) can be greater than one. Both of these tests are
routinely used to test for the influence of positive selection. Bayes Empirical Bayes analyses was used to identify
specific sites with ω > 1 [83]. We also constructed phylogenies using only chicken and zebra finch sequences,
but including putative zebra pseudogenes that spanned
the exons of interest.

Overgo probes targeting five genes of the MHC. Two pairs of probes
were designed for each gene using sequences from the zebra genome
trace archive.
Additional file 2: Self-self BLAST analysis of six BAC assemblies
(Class II: A to D, Class I: E to F). Theses results highlight the repetitive
nature of these genomic regions, and the challenges faced in assembly.
Additional file 3: Genes found by BAC sequencing. Genes found by
BAC sequencing and manual and automated gene prediction.
Additional file 4: Two-color FISH mapping of TAP2 and MHC Class I
BACs. Depicted is the only case in which BACs putatively containing
TAP2 and Class I colocalised. Colocalisation was on the W chromosome.
Additional file 5: BACs used in two color FISH mapping. BACs used
in dual-color FISH experiments with zebra finch MHC. These BACs are
specific for zebra finch microchromosomes 9-15 and 17-28. None of
these BACs cohybridized with MHC BACs. Because the whole genome
assembly places some MHC genes on chromosome 22, we tested two
chromosome 22 BACs. Both of these cohybridize with each other, and
neither cohybridized with MHC BACs.

found in the zebra finch genome. The remaining sequences are from
GenBank. B) Predicted amino acid sequences of the genomic sequence
and one EST for MHC Class I. Stars represent sites showing evidence of
