In the year 1315, on the battle field of Morgarten, a Swiss
hero named Winkelried, stabbed himself with lances he
grabbed from the wall of armed Austrian soldiers. His sacrifice, was thus essential to open the way for the victory of
the Swiss army. In his mind, there was a clear suicide plan
under which action was taken towards a goal, that is, the
survival of his colleagues. Such a suicide plan is found at
the cellular level in metazoa, namely in their cell death
program. Programmed cell death (PCD), is a suicidal
pathway that has clear benefits for multicellular organisms, whereby, cells that are damaged, infected, or no
longer required are eliminated. Considering the importance of PCD in metazoa, it is reasonable to ask if such a
predetermined mechanism of behavior, or operations,
exists in phylogenetically ancient, single cell organisms,
such as, pathogenic trypanosomatids.
In this issue, Seed and Wenck make comments relating to
the role of the long slender (LS) to short stumpy (SS) transition in the life cycle of the African trypanosomes. The
authors quote several different reports describing the presence of PCD in trypanosomatids. There is strong evidence
to suggest that cell death in Trypanosoma exhibits some
morphological features of PCD common to higher
eukaryotes. However, these morphological changes are
not yet definitive proof of a program or coded set of
instructions. Thus far, genes, that are involved in metazoan PCD, have not been functionally characterized in
trypanosomatids. Furthermore, it is likely that the Kinetoplastida genomes do not encode caspases, suggesting that,
if programmed cell death does exist, it is not an apoptotic
process but an apoptotic-like mechanism. Such apoptoticlike programs have already been described in higher
eukaryotes. The observations that these death features are

visible under stress or during differentiation of parasites
into the infectious stages are, however, interesting. In the
infectious stage, the parasite will encounter its host and be
exposed to the hosts' immune system. From this point
onwards, the parasite may either, survive by controlling or
escaping the immune system of the host, or alternatively,
be killed. In the latter case, it is advantageous for the parasite to expose phosphatidylserine and be phagocytized as
for any metazoan cell undergoing death. In Leishmania
mexicana, it has been shown that antigens can be presented to T cells by macrophages harbouring dead organisms but not by cells harbouring live parasites [1]. Such
observations, however, do not imply, de facto, that the parasite is acting altruistically. In their analysis on the role of
LS and SS forms of T. brucei, Seed and Wenck conclude
that some parasites of <<...the SS stages during the apoptosis-like process are acting altruistically >>...and also
<<give their lives to insure the long-term survival of the
host, and insure renewed growth of the minor LS variants
and new infective SS forms...for a successful transmission
of the trypanosomes to a new host>>. According to the
authors' conclusion, one ends up with the feeling that
some short stumpy (SS) forms of the African trypanosomes are programmed to die and that this program is
altruistic.
We do not contest the authors' comments concerning the
different roles of the LS and SS forms, however, we feel
that interpretation of the data concerning the altruistic
role of the SS should be taken with more caution. There is
strong evidence suggesting that quorum sensing exists in
bacteria, therefore, cross-talk between protozoan parasites
may also take place, and thereby controlling the virulence
and genetic competence of the parasite. These processes

are, however, designed for the survival of the pathogen
and not for its programmed elimination. We therefore feel
that the authors may have gone one step too far by asserting that the death of some SS parasites is due to an altruistic program. The question concerning the role of cell
death in trypanosomatids is still pending. Some recent
reports suggest that promastigotes of Leishmania parasites
may undergo autophagy when exposed to specific peptides [2]. This process differs from the cell death program
observed when parasites are exposed to stress conditions
such as exposure to H2O2, suggesting that parasites could
die using varying mechanisms. It is likely that the immune
response of the host will then differ depending on which
pathway is used.
In conclusion, most of the "ingredients" are presently
available to better understand the mechanism(s) of death
in trypanosomatids. However, the pathways of cell death
in these parasites require much further dissection. Once
this has been achieved we may have some ideas to the
definitive role of a cell death program(s) in trypanosomatids and its potential relevance to the immune response of
the host.
