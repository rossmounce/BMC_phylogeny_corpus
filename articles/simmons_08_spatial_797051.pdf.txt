Abstract
Background: The Prolactin (PRL) hormone gene family shows considerable variation among placental
mammals. Whereas there is a single PRL gene in humans that is expressed by the pituitary, there are an
additional 22 genes in mice including the placental lactogens (PL) and Prolactin-related proteins (PLPs)
whose expression is limited to the placenta. To understand the regulation and potential functions of these
genes, we conducted a detailed temporal and spatial expression study in the placenta between embryonic
days 7.5 and E18.5 in three genetic strains.
Results: Of the 22 PRL/PL genes examined, only minor differences were observed among strains of mice.
We found that not one family member has the same expression pattern as another when both temporal
and spatial data were examined. There was also no correlation in expression between genes that were
most closely related or between adjacent genes in the PRL/PL locus. Bioinformatic analysis of upstream
regulatory regions identified conserved combinations (modules) of putative transcription factor binding
sites shared by genes expressed in the same trophoblast subtype, supporting the notion that local
regulatory elements, rather than locus control regions, specify subtype-specific expression. Further
diversification in expression was also detected as splice variants for several genes.
Conclusion: In the present study, a detailed temporal and spatial placental expression map was generated
for all murine PRL/PL family members from E7.5 to E18.5 of gestation in three genetic strains. This detailed
analysis uncovered several new markers for some trophoblast cell types that will be useful for future
analysis of placental structure in mutant mice with placental phenotypes. More importantly, several main
conclusions about regulation of the locus are apparent. First, no two family members have the same
expression pattern when both temporal and spatial data are examined. Second, most genes are expressed
in multiple trophoblast cell subtypes though none were detected in the chorion, where trophoblast stem
cells reside, or in syncytiotrophoblast of the labyrinth layer. Third, bioinformatic comparisons of upstream
regulatory regions identified predicted transcription factor binding site modules that are shared by genes
expressed in the same trophoblast subtype. Fourth, further diversification of gene products from the PRL/
PL locus occurs through alternative splice isoforms for several genes.

The closely related Prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone
genes are thought to have arisen from a common ancestral
gene as a result of gene duplication and subsequent divergence early in vertebrate evolution [1]. Further gene duplications have given rise to expanded growth hormone or
PRL clusters in a species-specific manner. Primates, for
example, have an expanded growth hormone locus (containing five genes in close proximity on Ch 17) but a single PRL gene. In contrast, rodents have a single growth
hormone gene but an amplified PRL locus containing 23
PRL-like genes in mice [2-4] and at least 25 in the rat [5],
all located in close proximity in a single locus. While
many of the genes in the mouse and rat PRL family are
orthologues, some are specific to either species indicating
gene duplications since the divergence of mice and rats.
Amplification of the PRL gene appears to have happened
independently at least twice in mammals as ruminants
have an expanded PRL locus whose members are not
orthologous to those of the rodent PRL family [3,6-8].

duction and mice harboring null mutations in the PRL or
PRL receptor genes have deficits in ovarian hormone production, decidualization, pup-induced maternal behavior
and other adaptations to pregnancy [10-12]. The mammalian placenta is an important endocrine organ coordinating maternal and fetal responses to pregnancy and is a
source of extrapituitary lactogenic activity as it produces
several lactogenic PRL-related proteins. The first PRLrelated proteins were discovered in rodents and called Placental Lactogen I and II (PL-I and PL-II) based on their lactogenic effects. With molecular cloning and genome
sequencing, the family has grown to include at least three
genes encoding PL-I proteins in mice plus many other
more distantly related genes, although not all family
members are lactogenic. All of the PRL/PL-related genes
are expressed at the fetal maternal interface, predominantly in cells of the trophoblast lineage [3,4]. The
nomenclature of the PRL/PL genes has recently been
revised [13] and the new nomenclature will be used
throughout the paper (see Table 1).

The PRL family consists of 23 closely related genes in mice
found within a one megabase locus on chromosome 13
[2-4]. PRL was originally identified as a pituitary hormone
involved in mammary gland development [9] but is now
understood to have a wide range of biological actions and
targets. PRL is of particular importance for female repro-

The Placental Lactogen proteins (now called Prl3b and
Prl3d) bind to the PRL receptor and mimic the actions of
pituitary PRL [14], which include multiple pregnancydependent processes such as mammary gland development, corpus luteum function [15], maternal behavior
[16] and pancreas function [17]. However, the additional

PRL/PL-related proteins are 'non-classical' members of the
PRL family as they do not bind and activate the PRL receptor, although receptor-binding activity for several members has not yet been investigated. Overall, the biological
targets and functions are known for only a few of the PRL/
PL-related proteins. Prl2c (Proliferin) [18] and Prl7d1
(Proliferin-related protein) [19] have angiogenic and antiangiogenic effects on endothelial cells, respectively [20].
Prl7a1 (PLP-E) and Prl7a2 (PLP-F) promote blood cell
production [21,22]. Prl4a1 (PLP-A) suppresses natural
killer cells [23]. The only mouse mutants that have been
reported so far are for Prl4a1 [24] and Prl8a2 (dPRP) [25].
Neither mouse mutant shows an obvious phenotype
under normal conditions but embryonic lethality ensues
when pregnant mice are exposed to hypoxia. This implies
either that the PRL/PL-related genes have evolved to
respond to physiological stress or alternatively that redundancy within the gene family minimizes the effects of single gene mutations.
The human growth hormone locus relies on a locus control region 15–32 kilobases upstream to drive tissue-specific expression [26,27]. Within the PRL/PL locus in
rodents, however, there is no evidence so far for similar
control of regulation and no correlation between gene
location within the PRL/PL locus and temporal or spatial
expression patterns within the placenta has been observed
[4]. Placental expression data for most of the murine PRL
family members has been reported [4,25,28-34],
although almost exclusively at mid-gestation, and comprehensive temporal and spatial expression data for all 23
members of the PRL/PL family has not yet been compiled.
We have recently expanded on trophoblast cell type classifications within the murine placenta [35]. Our objective
here was to generate a high-resolution map of PRL/PL
expression patterns and explore associations between coexpressed genes and their respective positions within the
locus and/or similarities in regulatory elements.

Methods
cDNA probes
cDNAs with the full length open reading frames for each
PRL/PL family member were used as probes for northern
blot and in situ hybridization. cDNAs for Prl3b1, Prl2c1,
Prl7d1 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Rossant. cDNAs for
Prl3d1, Prl8a2, Prl4a1, Prl6a1, Prl7a1, Prl3c1, Prl5a1 were
kindly provided by Dr. D. Linzer. cDNAs for Prl8a9,
Prl8a8, Prl3a1, Prl2b1, Prl2a1, Prl7b1, Prl7c1 were kindly
provided by Dr. M. Soares. Full length cDNAs for Prl,
Prl8a6, Prl8a1, Prl7a2, and Pcdh12 were generated by PCR:
Prl (forward 5'-CTCTCAGGCCATCTTGGAGA-3', reverse
5'-TAAGCAGTTGTTTTGATGGGC-3); Prl8a6 (forward 5'ACGATGGCACTGCTATTGAGT-3', reverse 5'-TGGAGCATTTTCAAAGCAGA-3'); Prl8a1 (forward 5'-CAAAGATGGTGCTGCCATTA-3', reverse 5'-CCCAGTTATGCGA

CATTTCA-3'); Prl7a2 (forward 5'-GCCAGAACTCTTCAGAGATGTC-3', reverse 5'-TTAAGCATCATGAAGCATCTC
T3'); Pcdh12 (forward 5'-CAATGGGAATCCCCCTAAGT3', reverse 5'-TAGGTGGTCCACACTGGTGA-3'). PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega) and
sequence verified.
PCR primers and conditions
RT-PCR was used to determine whether predicted isoforms of Prl6a1, Prl8a6, Prl8a8, Prl8a1, and Prl7a1 were
expressed in vivo. RNA was isolated from implantation
sites or placentas at various stages of gestation by using
Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. cDNA synthesis employed oligo dT primer
and superscript enzyme (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. PCR primer sets and conditions are listed in Table 2. All PCR amplicons were cloned
into pGEM-T easy (Promega) and sequence verified.
Phylogenetic analysis and transcription factor binding site
analysis
cDNA sequences of the 23 paralogous PRL/PL family
members were input into the Mega 3.1 software program
to generate a phylogenetic tree [36]. Three kilobases of
upstream promoter regions of paralogous PRL/PL family
members were analyzed for transcription factor binding
sites by using the Toucan 2 software program [37].
Northern blot analysis
Northern blot analysis was performed as previously
described [35]. Briefly, RNA was extracted by using Trizol
(Invitrogen), separated on a 1.1% formaldehyde gel and
transferred to nylon membranes (Perkin Elmer). After UV
cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized in Church
buffer [38] containing 32P-labeled cDNA probes. An 18S
ribosomal RNA probe was used to check for RNA integrity
and standardize for gel loading.
In situ hybridization
Placentae were dissected in cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS at 4°C. After rinsing in PBS, tissues were processed
through sucrose gradients (10% in PBS and 25% in PBS)
before being embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek). Ten μm sections were cut and mounted on Super Frost Plus slides
(VWR) and stored at -80°C. For in situ hybridization, sections were re-hydrated in PBS, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, treated with proteinase K (30
μg/ml) for 10 minutes at room temperature, acetylated for
10 minutes (acetic anhydride, 0.25%; Sigma) and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probes overnight at 65°C.
Digoxigenin labeling was done according to the manufacturers instructions (Roche). Hybridization buffer contained 1× salts (200 mM sodium choride, 13 mM tris, 5
mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 5 mM sodium phos-

(1% w/v bovine serum albumin, 1% w/v Ficoll, 1% w/v
polyvinylpyrrolidone), and DIG-labeled probe (final
dilution of 1:2000 from reaction with 1 μg template
DNA). Two 65°C post-hybridization washes (1× SSC,
50% formamide, 0.1% tween-20) followed by two room
temperature washes in 1× MABT (150 mM sodium chloride, 100 mM maleic acid, 0.1% tween-20, pH7.5) were
followed by 30 minutes RNAse treatment (400 mM
sodium chloride, 10 mM tris pH7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 20 μg/
ml RNAse A). Sections were blocked in 1× MABT, 2%
blocking reagent (Roche), 20% heat inactivated goat
serum for 1 hour and incubated overnight in block with
anti-DIG antibody (Roche) at a 1:2500 dilution at 4°C.
After four 20 minute washes in 1× MABT, slides were
rinsed in 1× NTMT (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl, 100
mM tris pH 9.5, 0.1% tween-20) and incubated in NBT/
BCIP in NTMT according to the manufacturers instructions (Promega). Slides were counterstained with nuclear
fast red, dehydrated and cleared in xylene and mounted in
cytoseal mounting medium (VWR).
For double labeled in situ hybridizations, a fluoresceinlabeled probe was generated following the manufacturers
instructions (Roche) and added to the hybridization mix
along with the DIG-labeled probe. Following NBT/BCIP
development of the first probe, the antibody-enzyme conjugate was inactivated by 30 min incubation in 1× MABT
at 65°C, followed by 30 min in 0.1 M glycine pH 2.2 at
room temperature. The slides were then blocked again in
1× MABT, 2% blocking reagent (Roche), 20% heat inacti-

vated goat serum for 1 hour and incubated overnight in
block with anti-Fluorescein antibody (Roche) at a 1:2500
dilution at 4°C. The second signal was developed as previously described but one modification, the substrate
INT/BCIP (Roche), producing a brown colour, was used
in place of NBT/BCIP. As the INT/BCIP is soluble in alcohols and xylene, slides were counterstained with nuclear
fast red and mounted directly under Crystal Mount Aqueous Mounting Medium (Sigma).

Results
PRL/PL Family Nomenclature and Expression Analysis
A revised system for naming members of the mouse and
rat PRL/PL gene families has recently been introduced [13]
and is used throughout (see Table 1). Our analysis was
aimed at being able to discriminate the patterns of expression of all 23 genes in the PRL/PL locus. However, the similarity of some family members precluded us form being
able to do this for both spatial and temporal analysis. For
example, the new nomenclature cites four additional
murine Prl2c (Proliferin) genes (Prl2c2, Prl2c3, Prl2c4, and
Prl2c5) since four cDNAs have been reported, but the
actual number of genes and their respective locations
within the genome remain a matter of debate. Differentiation among the various Prl2c cDNAs requires RT-PCR
analysis followed by restriction enzyme digestion of the
resultant amplicons [39-41]. Therefore, as the methodology used in the current study (cDNA probe for Prl2c1 used
in northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization) could
not discriminate expression from the various Prl2c genes
or isoforms, hypothesized or annotated, the data for all
genes was summarized as Prl2c. Similarly, data for Prl3d1,

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:352

Prl3d2 and Prl3d3 (Placental Lactogen I alpha, beta and
gamma) are summarized as Prl3d.
In situ hybridization was used to define the spatial patterns of expression between embryonic days (E) 8.5 and
18.5 (term gestation). The various trophoblast cell types
in the mouse placenta are shown in Figure 1 for reference.
In general, the fully developed placenta has distinct layers:
a maternal decidual zone which also contains spiral
artery-associated trophoblast giant cells (TGC) and glycogen trophoblast cells that invade into it; a junctional zone
consisting of parietal TGCs, spongiotrophoblast cells and
glycogen trophoblast cells; and finally the labyrinth, in
which TGCs line maternal blood canals that enter the labyrinth leading into small sinusoids lined by sinusoidal
TGCs and syncytiotrophoblast cells (Fig 1) [35,42,43].
Northern blotting of whole placental tissue was used to
confirm the specificity of the cDNA probes and to assess
temporal expression. Analysis was performed in three
commonly used mouse strain backgrounds (CD1
(Charles River) or Swiss, C57/B6, 129 svj), which are
independently derived strains, to explore possible variation.
Expression Profiles for PRL/PL Family Members
Throughout Placental Development
The summary of northern blot and in situ hybridization
analysis is shown in Figure 2 and Additional file 1, and the
detailed data for each gene is presented in Additional files
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, (see additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21). Prl1a1 (Prl) expression
was not detected in the placenta whereas all of the other
genes were, in distinct patterns. The expression patterns
were generally consistent across the three strains and data
are shown for the CD1 background. However, a subset of
PRL/PL-related genes displayed subtle variations by strain,
either in the timing of the onset/offset of expression
within a particular trophoblast subtype or in the number
of cells of a given subtype that express the PRL family
member. These small differences are outlined in Additional files 3, 11, 16 and 20. Unexpected and unpublished
expression patterns were also noted, particularly the
expression of many PRL/PL genes in the developing ectoplacental cone (see below) and the segregation of certain
family members to the spongiotrophoblast or glycogen
cell populations within the junctional zone (discussed
below). Interestingly, not one PRL/PL gene was expressed
in the chorion early in placental development or in the
syncytiotrophoblast cells of the mature labyrinth.

In general, because of the inclusion of numerous gestational time points and detailed spatial analysis, our analysis generated new expression information for all family
members. However, three family members showed dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/352

crepancies with previously published data. Prl3c1 (Prolactin-like protein J) is expressed in the antimesometrial
decidua early in pregnancy and lasts as long as the antimesometrial decidual tissue persists [25,31]. In the current
study, Prl3c1 expression was also detected in the mesometrial decidua, although to a lesser extent, and in spongiotrophoblast at mid-gestation (see Additional file 3).
Prl8a1 (Prolactin-like protein C delta) expression was not
detected in the migratory glycogen trophoblast cells at
mid-gestation (see Additional file 12), or as strongly in
the spongiotrophoblast cells compared to a previous
report [4]. Finally, Prl7c1 (Prolactin-like protein O) has
been reported to be expressed in spongiotrophoblast,
TGCs and the labyrinth [4] but in the present study Prl7c1
expression was detected in the ectoplacental cone early in
gestation and was then restricted to glycogen trophoblast
cells later in gestation, although by E12.5 expression was
very much reduced (see Additional file 17). Some of these
differences could be explained by differences in the use of
in situ hybridization compared with immunohistochemistry or with the use of different in situ hybridization
probes or sensitivity, but the significant discrepancy
regarding Prl7c1 expression is more difficult to reconcile.
We have re-sequenced all of our cDNA plasmids to confirm that we used the correct probes.
No Correlation Between the Spatial/Temporal Expression
Profiles of PRL/PL Family Members and their Position
within the Locus or Sequence Similarity
In comparing the expression profiles of the genes in the
PRL/PL locus, each gene had a largely unique pattern
when considering both spatial and temporal expression.
By aligning the expression patterns with an evolutionary
tree based on gene sequence similarity (Fig. 2B) or with
position along the locus (see Additional file 1), it was
clear that there were no obvious patterns. This was true
regardless of the phylogenetic methodology applied or
the nature of the comparison (cDNA versus amino acid
sequence).
Expression of Numerous Prolactin Family Members within
the Ectoplacental Cone
An unexpected finding was that expression of at least half
of the PRL/PL family members was detected within the
ectoplacental cone at E8.5 (Figs 2 and 3). Prl3d1, Prl2c,
Prl7a1 (not shown, same pattern as Prl3d1, see Additional
file 14), Prl4a1, Prl8a9, Prl8a1 and Prl5a1 were detectable
in parietal TGCs at the periphery of the ectoplacental cone
at E8.5, although not all were uniformly expressed in all
parietal TGC (Fig 3). Only Prl3d and Prl7a1 were truly
restricted to the parietal TGC subtype however, as Prl2c,
Prl4a1, Prl8a1 and Prl5a1 were also expressed with the
core of the EPC (Fig 3). In contrast, expression of Prl3b1,
Prl7d1, Prl6a1, Prl2a1, Prl7b1 and Prl7c1 were detected
within the centre of the ectoplacental cone and not in

uniform or similar to each other.
Glycogen Trophoblast or Spongiotrophoblast-Specific
Expression
We detected expression of several PRL/PL-related genes in
the junctional zone of the placenta that contains spongiotrophoblast and glycogen trophoblast cells. Expression of
the protocadherin gene, Pcdh12, has been shown to be
specific to trophoblast glycogen cells in the murine placenta [44,45]. Therefore, Pcdh12 was used as a probe for
double in situ hybridization analysis to assess whether
PRL/PL family members expressed in the junctional zone
were specific to spongiotrophoblast or to glycogen trophoblast cells (Fig 4). Surprisingly, most PRL/PL-related
genes that were expressed within the junctional zone were
either specifically expressed in spongiotrophoblast cells or
in glycogen trophoblast cells (Fig 4), not in both populations as is the case for Tpbpa [46], a very widely used
marker for these two cell types. Prl3b1, Prl2c, Prl8a6,
Prl8a8, Prl8a1, Prl7a2, Prl3a1, Prl2b1, and Prl5a1 had complementary expression patterns to Pcdh12, indicating
spongiotrophoblast cell specificity (Fig. 3). Prl6a1, Prl2a1,
Prl7b1 and Prl7c1 all had expression patterns overlapping
with Pcdh12 (or complementary to Prl7a2 or Prl8a8 as
shown) indicating they were specifically expressed in glycogen trophoblast cells. The Prl4a1, Prl8a9 and Prl7d1
genes were expressed in both spongiotrophoblast and glycogen trophoblast cells (Fig. 4). Importantly, though, not
all cells of a given subtype were positive for each gene. For
example, only a small proportion of spongiotrophoblast
and glycogen trophoblast cells were positive for Prl4a1, a
gene more highly expressed in TGCs. Prl6a1 and Prl7b1
were both expressed in glycogen trophoblast cells specifically, but Prl6a1 was more prevalent in glycogen trophoblast cells that were resident within the junctional zone and
less abundantly expressed in migrating glycogen cells
located within the decidua. In contrast, Prl7b1 was more
abundantly expressed in migratory glycogen trophoblast
and spiral artery-associated TGCs throughout gestation.
Common Regulatory Modules Within Unique Gene
Promoter Regions Likely Convey Trophoblast SubtypeSpecific Gene Expression
A major aim of the current study was to gain insights into
the transcriptional regulation of PRL/PL-related genes in
the murine placenta. Despite a significantly expanded resolution of PRL/PL family member expression, our data set
did not show any correlation between the expression patterns of genes and their proximity to one another within
the locus, or between those most evolutionarily related.
This is consistent with previously published studies [2,4]
and bolsters the notion that local regulatory regions convey trophoblast subtype- and temporal-specific expres-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/352

sion rather than locus control regions. We then used the
Toucan2 bioinformatics program [37] to examine the
upstream regulatory regions (~3000 nt) of genes coexpressed within trophoblast subtypes in an attempt to
identify conserved groups, or modules, of putative transcription factor binding sites involved in subtype-specific
expression. Genes robustly expressed in glycogen trophoblast cells (Prl6a1, Prl2a1, Prl7b1, Prl7c1, Prl8a9) were
analyzed for modules of transcription factor binding sites
that occur in all five promoter regions. Two modules were
identified, each containing putative binding sites for five
transcription factors within a region of ~600 base pairs
(Fig. 5A). The two modules both contained sites for AP1,
PRRX2, GATA3 and NKX3A. One of the modules also contained a GFI1 site whereas the other contained a FOXJ2
site. We also examined the promoters of three genes coexpressed in the sinusoidal TGC population (Prl3b1,
Prl2b1, Prl7d1) and detected two conserved modules (Fig.
5B). Both modules contained sites for GATA3 and SOX9.
Multiple Splice Variants for Some PRL/PL Family Members
The mouse genome sequence assemblies from the
Ensembl [47] (m36-Jun2006) and Vega [48] (v19Jun2006) databases predict the existence of splice variants
for several PRL/PL family members, including Prl6a1,
Prl8a6, Prl8a8, Prl8a1 and Prl7a1. In an effort to determine
whether the predicted isoforms were expressed in vivo,
sequences unique to each variant cDNA were used both to
search EST databases and for primer design for RT-PCR
analysis and cDNA sequencing.
Prl6a1
Use of an alternative exon 1 was predicted both in the
Ensembl assembly (transcript ENSMUST00000091679)
and by the Vega database (named Prl6a1-002) (Fig. 6).
Blast searches [49] using the predicted novel exon 1
sequence did not match any EST sequences in the NCBI or
the institute for genomic research (TIGR) [50] databases.
In addition, RT-PCR amplification using a forward primer
specific to the alternative exon 1 and a common reverse
primer recognizing exon 3 did not yield any bands,
despite using cDNA generated from all stages of placental
development and from three different genetic backgrounds (Fig. 6).
Prl8a6
The novel splice variant of Prl8a6, predicted by both the
Ensembl (transcript ENSMUST00000080762) and Vega
(Prl8a6-001) genome assemblies, has a unique 5' untranslated region (UTR) and an absence of exon 4 (Fig. 6). EST
database searches using the predicted cDNA identified an
EST from a placental cDNA library that was a perfect
match (accession AK005478), suggesting that this isoform
is expressed in vivo. RT-PCR analysis using primers flanking exon 4 produced two amplicons (Fig. 6) and sequenc-

missing exon 4. Since the entire published 5' UTR (transcript ENSMUST00000018392) is contained within predicted novel 5' UTR (ENSMUST00000080762), it is
possible that the novel 5' UTR is not unique but reflects
the incomplete 5' sequencing of ESTs in the databases corresponding to Prl8a6. However, RT-PCR analysis using a
forward primer specific to the predicted 5' UTR of
ENSMUST00000080762 produced a fragment which was
expressed only at E14.5 and not at E9.5, suggesting that
the novel 5' UTR sequence could be isoform specific (data

NCBI database searches indicated 3 ESTs that contained
the novel exon (accession CK022447, CK032606,
CK020277) as well as over 33 ESTs that did not. The novel
isoform had already been submitted to Genbank as Prl8a8
isoform2 (accession AF230923). RT-PCR analysis and
sequencing of the PCR products confirmed expression of
both isoforms in E14.5 placenta (Fig 6).

An alternative isoform of Prl8a1 was predicted by both
Ensembl (transcript ENSMUST00000095926) and Vega
to terminate with an extended exon 5 rather than with
exon 6, as is the case for the originally reported Prl8a1
(transcript ENSMUST00000006664) (Fig. 6). Searches of
the NCBI and TIGR EST databases revealed an EST that
was a 100% match with the predicted Prl8a1 novel isoform (accession AK014414). Our RT-PCR analysis indicated that both isoforms are expressed at E9.5 and E14.5,
although similar to Prl8a8, the novel isoform is expressed
at a lower level (Fig. 6).
Prl7a1
An alternative isoform of Prl7a1 was predicted by the
Ensembl assembly (transcript ENSMUST00000095924)
to terminate with an extended exon 6 rather than with
exon 7, as is the case for the originally reported Prl7a1
(transcript ENSMUST00000006659) (Fig. 6). An EST
search returned a match with the novel isoform (accession
AK028371). In addition, RT-PCR using primers specific to
either the extended exon 6 or to exon 7, coupled with a
common forward primer for exon2, could amplify transcripts from both isoforms (confirmed by sequencing) at
E9.5 and E14.5 (Fig. 6).
Multiple Prl2c Genes Exist, Located Both Inside and
Outside the PRL/PL Family Locus
Between four and six Prl2c genes are predicted to exist
within the mouse genome [51,52]. Four unique cDNAs

Page 8 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:352

have been described [40,41,52], which correspond to the
four Prl2c genes currently annotated in the mouse
genome: Prl2c2, Prl2c3, Prl2c4 and Prl2c5. Notably, all of
these four genes are located outside of the main PRL/PL
locus but are still on chromosome 13. Three of the genes
are located approximately 10 Mb away from the main
PRL/PL locus; Prl2c4 is found at 12.88 Mb, Prl2c2 (MRP1/Plf-1) is found at 13.09 Mb and Prl2c5 (Formerly
Mrpplf4, MRP-4 and Plf-4) at 13.27 Mb (Fig 2), representing a Prl2c cluster outside the boundaries of the main PRL/
PL locus. Some discrepancies and confusion remain
regarding the Prl2c genes, however, as searches of
Ensembl show that Prl2c3 is listed as an alternative name
for Prl2c4 (also formerly Mrpplf3, MRP-2, Plf-2 and Plf-3).
Originally, detailed mapping of the mouse PRL/PL locus
[2,4] had identified only a single Prl2c gene located
between Prl2a1 and Prl4a1 within the PRL/PL cluster on
chromosome 13. Only a single gene was identified in the
rat PRL/PL cluster also [5]. Indeed, a candidate Prl2c gene
exists in this location in mice (ENSMUSG00000062551)
and is currently predicted to have several alternative splice
variants. Interestingly, to our knowledge, cDNAs corresponding to these predicted transcripts have yet to be
described. Overall, it is very likely that the nomenclature
will have to be revised as the existence of additional Prl2c
genes located inside and/or outside of the PRL/PL locus is
verified.

Discussion
In the present study, a detailed temporal and spatial placental expression map was generated for all murine PRL/
PL family members from E7.5 to E18.5 of gestation in
three genetic strains. This detailed analysis uncovered several new markers for some trophoblast cell types that will
be useful for future analysis of placental structure in
mutant mice with placental phenotypes. Moreover, several important conclusions about regulation of the locus
are apparent. First, no two family members have the same
expression pattern even when complete temporal and spatial data are examined. Second, most genes are expressed
in multiple trophoblast cell subtypes though none were
detected in the chorion, where trophoblast stem cells
reside, or in syncytiotrophoblast of the labyrinth layer.
Third, bioinformatic comparisons of upstream regulatory
regions identified predicted transcription factor binding
site modules that are shared by genes expressed in the
same trophoblast subtype. Fourth, further diversification
of gene products from the PRL/PL locus occurs through
alternative splice isoforms for several genes.
In reviewing the summary data, it was striking that so
many genes within the PRL/PL family are expressed in the
ectoplacental cone and in the adjacent parietal TGCs early
in gestation. It was already reported that TGCs at the
periphery of the ectoplacental cone express Prl3d and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/352

Prl2c as early as E6.5 [53] and Prl7a1, Prl4a1 and Prl6a1
are expressed in the developing placenta as early as E8.0
[32,54]. Interestingly, PRL/PL family members found at
the periphery of the ectoplacental cone are not uniformly
expressed in all TGCs and likely demarcate distinct TGC
subpopulations and/or stages of TGC differentiation.
Expression of genes in trophoblast cells at the center of the
ectoplacental cone was also diverse. Of note, Prl3b1 is
expressed in a small subset of cells within the center of the
ectoplacental cone at E8.5, possibly in secondary TGC
precursors or spongiotrophoblast precursors. Prl3b1
expression, which is broad later in gestation, has not been
described before E9 at which time Prl3d expression in
TGCs begins to decline [53]. Prl5a1 expression is also
interesting as it is biphasic in its expression, expressed in
both TGCs and cells in the centre of the ectoplacental
cone early in gestation and not again until late in gestation where it is expressed in spongiotrophoblast cells. Further studies are required to understand the heterogeneous
ectoplacental cone and parietal TGC cell populations.
The current studies have also provided several markers
that are restricted to either the spongiotrophoblast or glycogen cell populations. The junctional zone of the placenta contains both spongiotrophoblast cells and
glycogen trophoblast cells. While many genes are known
to be expressed within this layer [35], there had been very
few genes definitively characterized as markers of either
spongiotrophoblast or glycogen trophoblast cells,
although members of the PRL/PL family (Prl2a1, Prl7b1 in
mouse and Prl4a1, Prl2a1, Prl7b1 and Prl5a1 in rat) have
been specifically localized to invasive/migratory trophoblast within the decidua [55], suggesting 'migratory' or glycogen trophoblast specificity. Pcdh12 [44,45] and
connexin 31 [56] have been recently identified as glycogen trophoblast cell-specific markers, but no spongiotrophoblast-specific markers have been reported. Double in
situ hybridization with PRL/PL family members and
Pcdh12 showed that expression of Prl3b1, Prl2c, Prl8a6,
Prl8a8, Prl8a1, Prl7a2, Prl3a1, Prl2b1, and Prl5a1 is
restricted to spongiotrophoblast cells. Prl8a8 appears to
be the best spongiotrophoblast-specific marker as it is not
expressed in any other trophoblast cell subtypes throughout gestation and appears to be broadly expressed within
the entire population of spongiotrophoblast. In contrast,
Prl6a1, Prl2a1, Prl7b1 and Prl7c1 all have expression patterns overlapping with Pcdh12 expression (or complementary to Prl7a2 as shown) indicating they are
specifically expressed in glycogen trophoblast cells within
this layer. Markers that allow the distinction of glycogen
trophoblast and spongiotrophoblast cells will be very useful in dissecting the pathology of mouse mutants with placental phenotypes, since the most commonly used
marker, Tpbpa, is expressed in both [46]. It is also unclear
whether glycogen trophoblast cells differentiate directly

from spongiotrophoblast later in gestation [46] or
whether they represent an independent trophoblast population earlier within the ectoplacental cone [44]. Examining both spongiotrophoblast and glycogen trophoblast
in mutant mice with defects in the junctional zone will
give insights into this question.
Gaining a better understanding of the regulation of gene
expression from the PRL/PL locus was also a major aim of
our study. Placental-specific expression from the
expanded human growth hormone locus is regulated by a
locus control region 15–32 kb upstream of the gene cluster [26,27]. The evidence to date has not generally supported the notion that the rodent PRL/PL genes are
similarly regulated; small defined upstream regions isolated from the promoters of several PRL/PL family members, including rat Prl3b1 (Pl2) [57-59], mouse Prl3d (Pl1)
[60-62] and Prl2c (Plf) [60], rat Prl4a1 (Plp-A) [63], rat
Prl8a2 (d/tPrp) [64], rat Prl8a3 (Plp-Cv) [65], independently drive trophoblast-specific expression in vitro. Furthermore, genes with similar placental expression patterns
do not appear to be grouped together within the PRL/PL
cluster [2,4]. Nevertheless, regulatory elements for Prl3b1
[66] and Pl3d and Prl2c (J.C. Cross, unpublished data)
that are sufficient in vitro fail to drive trophoblast-specific
expression when tested in vivo. This indicates a requirement for additional elements for these genes at least making it difficult to rule out completely the involvement of
locus control regions or additional enhancers. In addition, complete temporal and spatial expression data for
each PRL/PL family member have not been compiled. In
the current study we compiled expression data for each
family member over the whole time course of placentation with high resolution, reporting expression patterns in
all the characterized trophoblast subtypes, in an effort to
uncover unappreciated associations between locus position and expression patterns. The identification of regulatory elements driving trophoblast subtype-specific gene
expression would be of particular use for future studies of
trophoblast differentiation and placental development. It
is now clear from our data set however that each PRL/PL
family member has a truly unique expression pattern with
no correlation to locus structure, consistent with previous
reports [2,4] and diminishing further the likelihood of
control regions driving subtype-specific trophoblast
expression. As such, subtype-specific expression patterns
are likely driven by elements contained within the local
upstream promoters of individual genes, although this
does not preclude the possibility of a locus control region
regulating placental-specific for the entire cluster, regulating trophoblast-specific transcriptional access to the
whole of the region.
We therefore sought another way to investigate trophoblast subtype-specific regulatory elements. Previous studies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/352

of PRL/PL gene regulation have rarely investigated what, if
any, subtype-specific expression is conveyed by the identified elements. Two notable exceptions are an enhancer
element from the rat Prl8a3 promoter shown to drive
expression preferentially in spongiotrophoblast cells
rather than TGCs [65] and the demonstration that the
transcription factor Gata2 is essential to restrict Prl4a1
expression to secondary TGCs within the TGC population
[67]. We used the bioinformatics software program
Toucan2 [37] to identify groups, or modules, of putative
transcription factor binding sites present in multiple promoter sequences from genes co-expressed in a particular
trophoblast subtype, rather than a single promoter in isolation. This approach effectively narrows the focus to elements involved in gene expression within a particular cell
population, rather than trophoblast specificity in general.
Our comprehensive expression data set allowed us for the
first time to try such an in silico approach and we compared the promoters of genes co-expressed in the poorly
characterized glycogen trophoblast and sinusoidal TGC
populations as examples, identifying several modules of
putative transcription factor binding sites common to the
promoters of each group. The identification of these conserved modules serves not only to bolster the notion of
local versus distant regulation of PRL/PL family members,
but provides a valuable in silico resource to identify candidate elements for further experimental studies. Interestingly, putative Gata3 sites were identified in all the
modules, a factor of known importance for trophoblastspecific expression of Prl3d and Prl2c [60-62]. Also, putative AP-1 sites were present in both modules contained in
the promoters of genes co-expressed in glycogen trophoblast cells, motifs important for Plr3d and Plr3b1 expression
[59,62]. The presence of motifs previously been shown to
play roles in regulating trophoblast-specific PRL/PL members within the modules imparts a higher degree of confidence to these predicted elements, making them strong
candidates for further experimental studies.
We conducted our expression analysis in three different
mouse lines, not only to increase the confidence of our
data set but also to investigate whether any PRL/PL family
members are expressed differently between commonly
used strains. We chose the outbred stock CD-1 and two
inbred strains C57/B6 and 129svj, all commonly used
lines. Average litter sizes are known to vary among different mouse stocks and strains (129svj – average 4.5 pups/
litter [68], C57/B6 – average 6.2 pups/litter [68], CD-1 –
average 11 pups/litter (Charles River) and several PRL/PL
family members have been shown to regulate reproductive adaptations to physiological stresses such as hypoxia.
Differences in PRL/PL gene expression between lines may
therefore be related to differences in litter size and the
accompanying changes in physiological adaptation [69].
Interestingly, only a few slight differences in the timing of

PRL/PL family expression or the breadth of expression
within a certain trophoblast subtype were observed.
Gene duplication followed by the acquisition of novel
gene function offers a way for species to adapt to changing
environmental challenges or to capitalize on newly available niches. Interestingly, members of the murine PRL/PL
family have undergone further diversification by adopting
splice variants. Evidence for positive selection within large
families of amplified genes, particularly those associated
with reproduction, has been accumulating [70-74]. One
theory suggests that the gene duplication event itself is
positively selected for to allow the amplification of genes
that are somewhat pre-adapted to meet a particular environmental challenge or biochemical niche, so that divergence and acquisition of new functionality may follow
[75]. It is tempting to visualize the evolution of the PRL/
PL genes in rodents and ruminants as a result of the driving environmental challenge of reproductive fitness.
Numerous other gene families have been reported in the
mouse genome that are also associated with reproduction
such as the placentally expressed cathepsins [76-78], Rhox
transcription factors [79] and pregnancy-specific glycoproteins [80,81], although their specific roles in reproduction remain largely unknown. The functions of the
individual PRL/PL family members are just beginning to
be revealed through knockout mouse studies. The diverse
patterns of expression and evidence of splice variants indicates that the family is rapidly evolving and suggests that
the different genes have distinct functions. The majority of
PRL/PL genes are expressed later in gestation when it is
likely they are acting as hormones to affect feto-maternal
adaptations to pregnancy, but it is also apparent from this
study that approximately half of the PRL/PL family members are expressed early in the ectoplacental cone and may
be involved in decisions affecting cell fate. Whether the
PRL/PL locus evolved as a result of positive selection, or
some other adaptive force, it is now clear that PRL/PL gene
amplification serves as an excellent model for studying
the process of genetic diversification.

Conclusion
The gene expression data in this study clearly demonstrates that no two PRL/PL family members share the
same temporal and spatial expression pattern. It is now
very clear that there is no correlation in expression
between genes that are most closely related or between
adjacent genes in the PRL/PL locus. Bioinformatic analysis
of upstream regulatory regions identified conserved modules of putative transcription factor binding sites shared
by genes expressed in the same trophoblast subtype. Interestingly, we have also observed that although mouse PRL/
PL genes are expressed in multiple trophoblast subtypes,
no family members were detected in the chorion, where
trophoblast stem cells reside, or in syncytiotrophoblast of
the labyrinth layer. The information gleaned in this study

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/352

has also identified novel markers that will provide valuable insight into mouse models with placental phenotypes.
Additionally, we have observed for the first time that
approximately half of the PRL/PL genes are expressed
early in the ectoplacental cone and may be involved in
decisions affecting cell fate. Based on our findings, we propose that the PRL/PL gene family represents an excellent
model for studying the process of genetic diversification.

indicate positive expression of the corresponding gene within the designated trophoblast subtype population, although there is no indication of
the proportion of cells within a given population that are positive. Grey
boxes indicate no gene expression within a given trophoblast subtype.
Genes labeled in red indicate those genes which are expressed in only one
trophoblast subtype while black labels indicate genes expressed in multiple
subtypes. Rectangles are used to indicate the location of genes within the
locus on chromosome 13 while ovals are used to indicate the location of
pseudogenes. *The Prl2c gene located within the main prolactin family
cluster (27–28 Mb) does not correspond to any of the 4 Prl2c genes previously annotated from cDNA sequences (Prl2c2, c3, c4 and c5) and is
therefore referred to as Plf, the original gene symbol. Summary of spatial
expression data for each PRL/PL family member correlated with gene position within the PRL/PL locus.
