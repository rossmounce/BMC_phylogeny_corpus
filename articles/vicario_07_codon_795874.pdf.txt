Abstract
Background: Codon usage bias (CUB), the uneven use of synonymous codons, is a ubiquitous
observation in virtually all organisms examined. The pattern of codon usage is generally similar
among closely related species, but differs significantly among distantly related organisms, e.g.,
bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila. Several explanations for CUB have been offered and some have been
supported by observations and experiments, although a thorough understanding of the
evolutionary forces (random drift, mutation bias, and selection) and their relative importance
remains to be determined. The recently available complete genome DNA sequences of twelve
phylogenetically defined species of Drosophila offer a hitherto unprecedented opportunity to
examine these problems. We report here the patterns of codon usage in the twelve species and
offer insights on possible evolutionary forces involved.
Results: (1) Codon usage is quite stable across 11/12 of the species: G- and especially C-ending
codons are used most frequently, thus defining the preferred codons. (2) The only amino acid that
changes in preferred codon is Serine with six species of the melanogaster group favoring TCC while
the other species, particularly subgenus Drosophila species, favor AGC. (3) D. willistoni is an
exception to these generalizations in having a shifted codon usage for seven amino acids toward A/
T in the wobble position. (4) Amino acids differ in their contribution to overall CUB, Leu having
the greatest and Asp the least. (5) Among two-fold degenerate amino acids, A/G ending amino acids
have more selection on codon usage than T/C ending amino acids. (6) Among the different
chromosome arms or elements, genes on the non-recombining element F (dot chromosome) have
the least CUB, while genes on the element A (X chromosome) have the most. (7) Introns indicate
that mutation bias in all species is approximately 2:1, AT:GC, the opposite of codon usage bias. (8)
There is also evidence for some overall regional bias in base composition that may influence codon
usage.
Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that natural selection has acted on codon usage in the
genus Drosophila, at least often enough to leave a footprint of selection in modern genomes.
However, there is evidence in the data that random forces (drift and mutation) have also left
patterns in the data, especially in genes under weak selection for codon usage for example genes
in regions of low recombination. The documentation of codon usage patterns in each of these
twelve genomes also aids in ongoing annotation efforts.

protein-coding genes that were available in November
2006. We identify patterns of preferred codons for each
individual amino acid in each species, as well as examine
variation among genes, amino acids, and chromosome
arms for level or intensity of CUB in a species. Evidence is
provided as to the causes of CUB by considering population sizes and mutation bias as assessed by base composition of introns and non-recombining genes.

Background
The genetic code is redundant, i.e., more than one triplet
sequence of DNA bases codes for the same amino acid.
Thus genes and species may use different sets of codons
preferentially, the phenomenon of codon usage bias
(CUB). This well documented un-evenness of use of synonymous codons may come about by a variety of evolutionary forces, in particular, mutation bias, selection, and
genetic drift. Generally, species have a characteristic pattern of codon usage that holds across most genes in the
species; notable exceptions are warm-blooded vertebrates
where isochores, large stretches of DNA with high AT or
GC content [1], appear to affect synonymous codon usage
depending on the characteristic AT/GC content of the isochore in which a gene resides [2]. There is evidence for
heterogeneous regional base content in Drosophila (discussed later), although clearly not as strong as in mammals and having much less influence on codon usage.

Results
Not all species have the same overall intensity of codon
usage bias
We calculated the average effective number of codons [5],
ENC, for each species' set of CDSs. We performed a bootstrap randomization test for CDSs with homologue candidates across all species to determine if ENC for different
species are statistically significantly different. Figure 1
presents the data. Clearly there is a large range of intensity
with Dpse and Dper having the greatest CUB as measured
by ENC and Dwil the least. (See Materials and Methods
for species abbreviations used in the text.) In the Discussion, we suggest that some of this variation is likely due to
differences among species in effective population sizes.

Drosophila have been well-studied for patterns and processes that lead to CUB, in particular D. melanogaster, and
less often, a few other species for which very limited
sequence data were available. The newly available complete genome sequences of 12 species of Drosophila[3,4]
provide a hitherto unattainable insight into CUB variation and evolution in a set of phylogenetically welldefined related taxa. In addition, knowing the particular
codon usage patterns of different species allows more
accurate identification of protein-coding sequences (i.e.,
annotation). Here we examine the patterns of codon
usage in these 12 species based on reliably identifiable

Identification of preferred codons for each amino acid for
each species
Various terms have been used to describe the most used
codon for amino acids. The term "optimal" codon is often
used, although this term has been co-opted by Duret and
Mouchiroud [6] to mean codons associated with high
expression of genes, i.e., a mechanism for CUB is

assumed. Here we will use the mechanism-neutral term
"preferred" codon. Various ways are possible to identify
preferred codons and we present three here, which identify very similar sets of preferred codons (Figure 2). Our
favored method is Figure 2A, which is to ask: As genes
become more biased (uneven) in codon usage, which
codon(s) for each amino acid increases in frequency? This
is done by simply taking the correlation between overall
codon usage bias for each gene (negative ENC) and the
use of codons for each amino acid. A related method is to
look for correlation between the individual amino acid
ENC, sENC-X (see Materials and Methods), and usage of
particular codons. Figure 2B presents this correlation
between individual amino acid bias and codon usage. A
third way of identifying preferred codons is based on the
relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) measure. Figure 2C presents the RSCU for the 10% most highly biased
genes in each species as indicated by ENC. The preferred
codons identified by these three methods are very similar
to one another. But it should be noted that there is an
essential difference between the methods used to generate
Figures 2A and 2C on the one hand, and Figure 2B on the
other. Figures 2A and 2C identify the preferred codons relative to overall level of codon usage bias of entire genes.
Figure 2B does this for individual amino acids. Thus at
least some of the minor differences may be due to the possibility that evolutionary forces that are dominant on
overall codon usage on an entire gene may not always be
identical for individual amino acids. This would seem to
be the case in Dwil and the subgenus Drosophila species in
comparing Figures 2A and 2B. While selection may still be
acting to provide optimal translation of the entire gene
sequence, when selection is weak, those amino acids least
sensitive to such selection may not respond and display a
codon usage pattern more reflective of mutation bias.
Bootstrap analyses of the data in Figure 2 were done to
assess the statistical support for identification of the preferred codon (see Additional File 1 and 2 and [3]). Overall
these analyses indicate strong statistical support of identification of the preferred set of codons for each species. For
example, of the 216 highest correlation coefficients in Figure 2A (12 species × 18 redundant amino acids), 209 are
supported with a bootstrap value of 95–100%. The other
methods give similarly high bootstrap support for the preferred codon (see Additional File 1 and 2).
Two important generalities are clear from Figure 2. First,
the preferred set of codons is quite constant across Drosophila.
Second, in most cases the preferred codons in all species are
those with G and especially C in the third codon position. That
is, generally in Drosophila, codon usage is biased toward
C/G-ending codons as previously deduced from limited
data on fewer species. Exceptions to these two generalities
exist, with Dwil being the obvious species with the most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/226

exceptions as well as being the species with the least overall CUB (Figure 1). We discuss Dwil in more detail later.
Among the 11 species (excluding Dwil), Ser is the only
amino acid that actually has a change in preferred codon
(Figure 3). TCC is the preferred codon in all members of
the melanogaster group (Dsim, Dsec, Dmel, Dyak, Dere,
and Dana) whereas in the two members of the obscura
group (Dpse and Dper) AGC is slightly more preferred
and in the subgenus Drosophila (Dmoj, Dvir and Dgri)
AGC is the most preferred codon. In fact, in the subgenus
Drosophila, TCC becomes the third most preferred codon
with TCG rising to the second most preferred.
Amino acids contribute differently to a gene's CUB
Here we examine the issue of whether amino acids vary in
CUB. Figure 4 presents the results. Note that in this figure
we present sENC-x as defined by Moriyama and Powell
[7] which scales ENC to have the same range (0–1) regardless of the level of redundancy. In subgenus Sophophora,
Leu is clearly the single amino acid that accounts for the
greatest CUB of a gene and Asp accounts for the least. This
can also be seen in Figure 2 in that the strongest correlations with codon usage are for Leu and the least for Asp.
In subgenus Drosophila (Dmoj, Dvir and Dgri) Leu still
contributes highly to CUB, but Arg and Gly are about
equal in high levels of CUB. Similarly, there are differences between the subgenera in which amino acids contribute the least to CUB, with Tyr, His, and Phe being
about equally low as Asp in contribution to CUB in subgenus Drosophila. Again the uniqueness of Dwil is evident
in Figure 4.
D. willistoni: the outlier
It is evident from Figures 2, 3, 4, that Dwil has a pattern of
codon usage very different from all other species. Generally this is seen as an increased usage of A/T-ending
codons compared to the 11 other species, resulting in an
overall lower level of CUB as measured by ENC (Figure 1).
This lowering of overall CUB in Dwil can best be seen in
Figure 4 where almost all amino acids produce a blip
downwards (toward less bias) in Dwil compared to the
other species. In Figure 4, however, note that in Dwil four
amino acids, His, Asn, Tyr, and Asp actually increase in
sENC-X relative to the other species. These four amino
acids are all T/C-ending two-fold degenerate amino acids
and are among the weakest in CUB among the 11 other
species (Figure 4B); this increase in bias is especially surprising for Asp, which, as noted above, is generally the
least or among the least biased amino acids. But it is
important to note that the increase in bias of these four
amino acids in Dwil is not toward the preferred codon of
other species (C-ending) but rather toward T-ending
codons. Table 1 summarizes the differences and similarities of Dwil to the other species.

acid codon usage bias, sENC-X. (C) is the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for the 10% highest biased genes based on

Indication
Indication of change in preferred codon for serine. The Y axis is the correlation of usage of each codon with negative ENC of
genes, a measure of the relative usage of each codon in each species. Positive correlations indicate favored codons, and negative correlations indicate avoided codons.

Amino acids vary in sensitivity to selection for codon usage
We also explored whether different amino acids vary in
their response to selection for codon usage. If we use the
overall CUB of a gene to indicate the level of selection for
CUB, we ask whether different amino acids respond differently to selection for overall gene CUB, what we term
sensitivity to selection for CUB. If, as we discuss later, there
is good evidence that the level of CUB increases with
increasing levels of gene expression, another way to pose
this question is: As proteins increase in level of expression,
does codon usage for different amino acids respond differently? We present in Figure 5 results for two species
(Dsim and Dvir), one from each subgenus, for two-fold
degenerate amino acids; similar graphs for the other ten
species are in the Additional File 1 and 2. We confined this
analysis to two-fold degenerate amino acids to avoid
problems of secondarily or even tertiarily favored codons
when more than two codons code for the same amino
acid (see Figure 2). The pattern of change in amino acid
codon usage is quite consistent between the two species in
Figure 5 as well as for the other 10 species (Additional File
1 and 2). Consistent with the patterns of overall contribution to CUB (Figure 4), among two-fold degenerate
amino acids, A/G-ending amino acids, especially Lys and
Gln are the first to respond to increasing gene CUB (Figure

5), while T/C-ending are less sensitive (with the exception
of Cys). Asp, in fact, in Dvir, does not change in frequency
of codon usage (Figure 5B). These observations indicate
that T/C-ending two-fold degenerate amino acids are
under weaker selection compared to A/G-ending two-fold
degenerate amino acids, confirming an earlier observation based on much less data [7].
Mutation bias and codon usage
Mutation bias can affect codon usage especially when
selection is weak. In order to assess the pattern and
strength of mutation bias, we identify regions of the
genome thought to have the least selective constraint,
wherein base composition at equilibrium should reflect
mutation bias. We identified the intron sequences from
the 6,698 CDSs with homologues across all 12 species as
described in the Materials and Methods. In order to
increase the likelihood of examining selectively neutral
DNA sequences, we removed embedded transposable elements as well as 50 bp on each end of the introns in order
to avoid constrained splicing signals. We also compared
all introns to a subset of introns between 100 bp and 2000
bp (after removal of 50 bp at each end) in order to
decrease the probability of including unidentified embed-

atively high in A/T, between 59 and 65% across all 12
species. This implies that for all 12 species, contrary to
codon usage bias, mutation bias is toward A/T. This observation is consistent with the previous observation based on
fewer genes mainly from D. melanogaster [e.g., [8,9]] and
is now shown to be more general for the genus Drosophila.
(For reasons that will become clear in the next section, we
separated genes on the fourth chromosome of Dmel in
Table 2.)
Also note that when the data are trimmed to avoid very
large introns (>2000 bp), the A/T content consistently
increases by about one percent across all species (Table 2),
implying that there may be some small degree of unidentified embedded CDSs or control elements in the longer
introns. This is consistent with Comeron and Kreitman
[10] indicating that higher recombination rate expected in
genes with longer introns enhances selection on base
composition.

Non-recombining genes have different codon usage
Most species of Drosophila have a "dot" chromosome, the
4th in Dmel, also known as element F [11,12]. Of particular interest is the fact that genes on this chromosome very
rarely recombine compared to all the other chromosomes
[13,14]. Among the 6,698 CDSs homologous across all 12
species, 33 are known to be on the F element in Dmel, and
by chromosome arm homology, may be assumed to be on
this element in the other species. Among the 12 Drosophila
species with completed genome sequences, Dwil is again
different in this regard in lacking a dot chromosome [15].
There is good evidence that in Dwil the genes on the F ele-

ment have been incorporated into one of the other elements, in particular element E [16]. The importance of
comparing non-recombining genes to recombining genes
is that the effectiveness of selection at individual loci
(nucleotide sites in this case) is positively correlated with
recombination rate, the well-known Hill-Robertson effect
[17]. Codon usage bias has been shown to positively correlate with rate of recombination in Drosophila[18-22] and
that genes on the (nearly) non-recombining dot chromosome of Dmel are particularly low in codon usage bias
[18,23].
Figure 6 presents the cumulative distribution of codon
adaptation index (CAI) for each of the six Muller-Sturtevant elements for four species for which good data are
available on element linkage of available CDS. (Syntenic
assignments at the time of the study were not sufficiently
developed for the other eight species to perform this analysis.) Two patterns are apparent. First, element F CDSs
have the least CUB; this is consistent with the more limited data presented previously [18,23] and shows that the
predicted pattern expected in low-recombining regions is
general at least for these four species. Second, as previously noted for Dmel [24](Singh et al. 2005), element A
(X chromosome in all species) has the most biased CDS.
Interestingly, in Dpse element D is also part of the metacentric X; this element does not differ significantly from
the autosomes in CUB.
In the Additional File 1 and 2, graphs similar to those in
Figure 6 are presented using ENC as the measure of CUB

and the same conclusions are supported by this measure.
Alternative codon usage
Given that mutation bias in Drosophila is generally toward
A/T while CUB is generally toward G/C, the two forces,
selection and mutation bias, are opposed. Also note that
when selection is nonexistent or very weak, mutation bias
will cause CUB but the pattern will be opposite that
caused by selection. Thus non-directional measures of
unevenness of codon usage such as ENC will identify
genes/amino acids that have CUB due to both preferred
GC in the wobble position (due largely to selection in
Drosophila) and AT bias (due largely to mutation bias in
Drosophila). Genes/amino acids with completely even
codon usage would occur only when the mutation bias
toward A/T is exactly balanced by selection toward G/C.
The directional measure CAI does not have this property
as it measures deviation from usage of a set of pre-defined
preferred codons. Thus, unlike ENC, the CAI of genes/
amino acids dominated by mutation bias would have a
lower CAI than those with completely even usage of
codons.

Figure 7 presents the correlation between ENC and CAI
for each of the 12 genomes. These two measures are quite
tightly correlated, with all correlation coefficients associate with p < 10-16, and the correlation is quite linear over
much of the range. If we assume that increasing CAI is
largely controlled by selection for use of the preferred
codon and ENC indicates bias that could be due to either
selection or mutation bias, then the level of correlation
between CAI and ENC may differ for different species

depending on the relative balance of selection and mutation (likely associated with differences in effective population size as argued in the Discussion). The correlation
coefficients in Figure 7 are all less than -0.8 except for Dwil
(-0.51), Dvir (-0.75), and Dgri (-0.61). This pattern is consistent with the overall ENC of the different species (Figure 1) if we assume the scatter of the ENC measure is
greater in these species due to the increased effect of mutation. That is, selection will cause a correlation between
ENC and CAI, but the randomness of mutation will lessen
this correlation when mutation bias becomes a relatively
stronger force.

It is of considerable interest to note that the upper eight
species in Figure 7, the evident linear association between
ENC and CAI breaks down at the very lowest end of CAI
on the left in these graphs. Genes at this end actually have
somewhat lower ENCs resulting in a downward "hook" in
this range of the relationship. This means they are biased
when measured by unevenness of synonymous codon
usage (ENC), but the direction of bias is away from usage
of the optimal codon as defined by the reference set used
to calculate CAI. As noted by the color differences, these
genes tend to be those located on the non-recombining
element F. This is as expected if mutation bias is dominating these genes so that they are biased (as measured by

Scatter plot of CAI versus ENC values for each of the 12 genomes. The reference set for CAI is relative to each genome (see
text for details). The red dots are the genes that are localized in the fourth chromosomes (element F) in D. melanogaster. The
dashed line indicates the CAI index value that a gene with equal codon usage (no CUB) would have, which occurs when mutation bias to A/T is exactly balanced by selection to G/C. One interpretation of these graphs is that genes to the right of the
dashed lines are dominated by selection for codon usage, whereas genes to the left are dominated by mutation bias.

ENC) due to mutation bias toward A/T, opposite to usage
of the optimal set of codons rich in G/C. The dotted line
in each graph in Figure 7 are for completely equal usage of
all codons, when mutation bias to A/T is exactly balanced
by selection to G/C; thus one interpretation is that genes
to the left of the dotted lines are dominated by mutation
while those to the right are dominated by selection. [Note
that this interpretation would only hold for cases as in
Drosophila where mutation bias to A/T is opposite to selection for G/C, and thus this approach may not be generally
applied to other organisms where this is not true.]
The four lower species in Figure 7 do not display much
evidence for the downward hook associated with the
other species, at least not associated with genes known to
be on element F in Dmel. This is expected for Dwil, without a separate element F. The other species (Dmoj, Dvir,
and Dgri) that do not exhibit this downward hook associated with element F genes are in subgenus Drosophila.

Consistent with other evidence below, we speculate this is
due to the fact that there has not been complete conservation of linkage of Dmel F element genes in subgenus Drosophila. If at least some genes that are found on element F
in Dmel have now become incorporated in other chromosome arms, they would not be expected to produce the
downward hook in Figure 7 evident in other species.
In the Additional File 1 and 2 we present graphs similar to
those in Figure 7 identifying other genes with the alternative codon usage pattern. It is likely that many of these
reside in other regions of the genome that have unusually
low recombination such as near telomeres and centromeres.
Another way to identify alternative codon usage on the
non-recombining F element is to compare the GC content
at third positions of four-fold degenerate amino acids.
Table 2 shows these data. An increase of 20–30% in A/T at

Page 10 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:226

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/226

these positions compared to the total data set is evident
for most species. For Dwil, there is much less difference
(6%) for these genes that have now become incorporated
into normally recombining chromosome arms.
Finally we note the added evidence of the dominance of
mutation bias on base composition of element F by examining the base composition of introns on this element
compared to introns on all other elements. Table 2 shows
that the A/T content of F element introns is consistently
higher than introns on other elements. We suspect that
the base content in non-recombining introns reflects most
accurately the actual mutation bias which, fairly consistently across species, has a mean of 32% G/C, 68% A/T.
This implies that introns in genes not on element F are
still under some selective constraints (as indicated by a
35–41% G/C content) even after removing 50 bp at each
end and eliminating predicted TE sequences. Note again
that Dwil is the exception in that there is no difference in
base composition between introns in genes that are on the
F element in the other species and introns on all other elements (Table 2). This implies that the incorporation of
these sequences into "normally" recombining chromosome arms subjects them to the same evolutionary forces
as all other sequences.
Also evident in Table 2 is the fact that the F element genes
in Dvir and Dgri have fairly high GC% at four-fold degenerate sites. This is consistent with the previous observation
(Figure 7) indicating that there has not been complete
conservation of synteny between Dmel and these two species in another subgenus diverged for about 50 million
years.

Regional patterns of base composition and its effect on
codon usage
There is evidence that Drosophila are regionally heterogeneous in base composition [25,26]. Further Singh et al.
[27] noted that substitution patterns are heterogeneous
across the genome. Some evidence exists that this could be
due to GC-bias-gene conversion associated with recombination [28,29]. It is not the intent of this paper to address
this issue in detail, rather here we will simply address the
evidence for such heterogeneity and how much effect it
may have on CUB. To do this, we correlated the GC content of introns and with the GC content at the 3rd position
of 2-and 4-fold degenerate amino acids in the exons of the
same gene. Table 3 displays the results; actual graphs are
in the Additional File 1 and 2. As can be seen there are
indeed significant positive correlations between GC content of introns and GC content of 3rd position of 4-fold
degenerate amino acids. The amount of variation in GC
explained by this correlation (R2) is between 1 to 8%.
These results are similar to those of Kliman and Hey [19]
for only Dmel. So there is evidence for regional effects
consistent with perhaps variation in recombination associated with Hill-Robertson effects or GC-biased gene conversion, although clearly the magnitude of the effect does
not explain all, or even a majority of the variation in GC
content at the 3rd position. Because good information on
genome variation in recombination is only known for
Dmel and relatively little is known about the rates of GCbiased gene conversion, it is impossible to further speculate on this issue.

Discussion
Stability and change in codon usage in Drosophila
As with many organisms, there is a characteristic pattern
of codon usage in the genus Drosophila, at least for 11/12
species with complete sequenced genomes. With the
exception of serine, all species have the same preferred
codon for all amino acids (Figure 2 and Table 1). Codon
usage for serine has a clear phylogenetic component in
that all members of the melanogaster group have a different favored codon from all the other species. All favored
codons in 11/12 species have either C or G in the third
codon position.

D. willistoni is clearly the most different of all the species
with regard to codon usage and is a clear exception to the
generalities just expressed. The unusual codon usage in
this species was first pointed out by [30] and has since
been confirmed to be similar in all species in the lineage
leading to Dwil including the saltans group [31-33]. Thus
the shift in codon usage likely occurred ancestrally in the
lineage leading to all extant members of this willistoni-saltans lineage. Generally, the change in codon usage in Dwil
(Table 1) has been toward higher usage of T instead of C
in the preferred codons (Arg, Leu, Gly, Asn, Asp, and Ile)
or A for C (Pro). This results in a lower overall codon
usage bias in this species as can be seen in Figures 1 and 5.
But, interestingly not all amino acids shift in preferred
codon, although there does seem to be an overall decrease
in magnitude of CUB in Dwil even for those amino acids
for which there is not a qualitative change in preferred
codon.
This shift in codon usage could be due to a number of factors: (a) a quantitative increase in the level of mutation
bias toward A/T, (b) a small effective population size so
that the relative balance between mutation bias and selection has shifted toward the former even if the magnitude
of mutation bias has not changed, and (c) change in the
relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs so that the level
and pattern of selection mediated by tRNA has shifted.
There is some evidence that the magnitude of mutation
bias toward A/T has increased in Dwil compared to the
other species as assessed by intron base composition
(Table 2). However, this magnitude of change in mutation bias by itself seems incapable of explaining changes
in codon usage in Dwil [34]. Further, if we assume mutation bias is best reflected by base composition of the nonrecombining introns of element F with a mean AT of 68%
in 11/12 species, Dwil AT content for these same introns
as well as all introns is marginally lower (66.5%) arguing
that neither the pattern nor strength of mutation bias in Dwil
is significantly different from other species. With regard to
relaxed selection due to small population size, today Dwil
has a very large distribution with dense populations
[20,35,36] and its contemporary population size is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/226

undoubtedly very large. It is possible, however, that this
may represent a relatively recent expansion since the Pleistocene and that the willistoni lineage went through a bottleneck that continues to affect patterns of molecular
evolution. Consistent with this idea is the fact that Dwil
has a higher level of non-synonymous polymorphisms
than other species [37], implying relaxed selection. But
again, this would seem to be insufficient to account for
greater shifts in codon usage for some amino acids and
not others. That the selective pressure for codon usage in
the willistoni/saltans lineage has shifted, possibly due to a
change in tRNA pools, is still a strong likelihood as argued
in more detail in [33].
Intensity of CUB and population sizes
As can be seen in Figure 1, there is considerable variation
in level of CUB among the 12 species. Overall, this pattern
is reasonably consistent with what can be inferred from
the effective population sizes of the species, with selection
for codon usage being more effective in larger populations; this is especially relevant as it has been shown that
the level of selection on codon usage is very close to the
border of when selection or drift dominate, l2Nesl ≅ 1 [3842]. Dpse and Dper are widespread species in the western
half of N. America and considerable data exist indicating
high levels of gene flow among populations [e.g., [43,44]]
consistent with a large Ne. Also consistent with a large Ne
for Dpse is that it has a higher level of DNA plymorphism
than Dmel or Dsim [20,45]. On the other hand, Dgri is an
Hawaiian endemic with presumably a relatively small
population and has the least degree of CUB (with the
exception of Dwil). As first pointed out by [39] and now
more thoroughly confirmed [[3]; Akashi et al. in preparation], Dsim has greater CUB than Dmel, again consistent
with Dsim having greater molecular variation [45] indicating a larger Ne than Dmel. Presumably, the relatively
recent "out of Africa" history of the domestic populations
of Dmel affected its historical effective population size,
the effect of which can still be seen in the DNA patterns of
variation. Dana has a history similar to Dmel in being a
fairly recently domesticated species associated with
human refuse. Among the other members of the melanogaster group, Dsec has the least CUB consistent with a
small population size for an island endemic.
Selection-mutation balance
Given that codon usage in Drosophila favors G and C in the
wobble position of codons (Figure 2; Table 1) while
mutation bias is toward A and T (Table 2), it is difficult to
escape the conclusion that non-random synonymous
codon usage is due, at least to a large degree, to selection.
This is not to imply that selection need necessarily always
act on synonymous codons nor equally on all genes. Figure 7 indicates a range of selection on genes with a minority having codon usage more indicative of mutation bias.

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:226

Rather selection has acted on most genes over evolutionary time such that the footprint of selection is still evident
in the newly available complete genome sequences. Also,
as noted above, given that the selection coefficients associated with synonymous codon usage are near to the point
where population size is crucial, given the inevitable fluctuations in populations over long periods of time, it
seems very likely that the dominance of selection and
mutation/drift has also fluctuated. In fact, one can see in
the non-recombining element F genes, strong evidence
that mutation and drift dominate. Given that we can document the expectations of mutation/drift dominance in
non-recombining genes, makes it all the more evident
that the patterns of DNA variation in "normally" recombining genes not on element F cannot solely be due to
mutation/drift.
Also, we (Table 3) and others have noted that there may
well be regional base composition effects that can affect
codon usage. The precise quantitative interaction between
factors influencing regional base composition and codon
usage remains to be determined. However, the data presently available indicate that the influence exists, but it is
not great.
But the level of selection must be weak as pointed out
above, and different species, genes, and amino acids are
differentially affected by selection. This explains the differences in Figures 2A and 2B. Figure 2A indicates that selection is acting reasonably consistently across all 12 species
when considered on the entire gene level, yet Figure 2B
indicates more complexity when considering individual
amino acids for which the balance between selection and
mutation bias may differ among species.
Nature of selection
Two, interdependent, factors for selection on synonymous codon usage are speed and accuracy of translation.
In unicellular organism (i.e., bacteria and yeast) it is well
established that more highly expressed genes have greater
CUB than lowly expressed genes and that the codons preferred are optimally translated by the most abundant isoaccepting tRNAs [46-49]. For Drosophila, similar
observations have been made [e.g., [6-8]]. For example,
there is a good correlation between level of expression and
CUB for Dmel and Dpse for which microarray expression
data are available [50]. In addition, experimental evidence
indicates higher level of expression of alleles with optimal
codons compared to non-optimal codons [51]. Finally,
the relative abundances of isoaccepting tRNA in Dmel correlate with the preferred codons [7,52].

With regard to accuracy (avoidance of misincorporation
of the wrong amino acid), it is known that synonymous
codons can vary by as much as ten-fold in rates of misin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/226

corporation [53]. Akashi [54] presented evidence for
selection for accuracy in Drosophila by showing that conserved amino acids among species have higher CUB than
amino acids free to vary; the implication is that conserved
amino acids are more crucial to protein function than
those that vary among species. In this regard, it is interesting that among 2-fold redundant amino acids, Cys has the
highest overall contribution to CUB and the second most
overall all 18 amino acids (Figure 4) as well as being
among the most "sensitive" to increasing gene CUB (Figure 5). Given its importance in three-dimensional structure of proteins by forming disulfide bridges,
misincorporation at a Cys site should be strongly selected
against. Leu has the greatest contribution on average to
overall CUB (Figure 4). Leu is the most abundant hydrophobic amino acid [55] and thus may on average be more
constrained against misincorporation than most amino
acids. It is less clear why Lys and Gln are among the most
sensitive two-fold degenerate amino acids (Figure 5),
although generally (with the exception of Cys), A/G twofold redundant amino acids are more biased in codon
usage than C/T two-fold redundant amino acids.
Another potential explanation for different amino acids
varying in intensity of CUB is that it is related to the
number of different isoaccepting tRNAs for each amino
acid. One possibility is that amino acids with one or very
few tRNAs translating it are more prone to CUB than
amino acids with several isoaccepting tRNAs. A comparison of the numbers of different isoaccepting tRNAs for
each amino acid given in White et al. [56] and which
amino acids contribute most or least to CUB does not
obviously support this speculation.
The relative lack of codon bias for Asp can be more clearly
associated with tRNA pools. Asp has both the least contribution of amino acids to the total CUB of a gene (Figure
4) as well as being the least sensitive (Figure 5). At least in
Dmel (the only species studied for relative abundance of
isoaccepting tRNAs), Asp is unique among amino acids as
it is the only one for which the most abundant isoaccepting tRNA changes among developmental stages, with the
most abundant tRNA in the larval stage optimally translating CAC and other stages optimally translating CAU
[56]. Vicario [50] showed that genes with maximum
expression at different developmental stages preferred Asp
codon usage that matches the tRNA levels. The fact that
genes expressed at different stages have selection for different Asp codons explains why this amino acid has relatively low contribution, on average, to overall gene CUB
as well as why, when averaged over all genes (as done in
Figure 5), Asp appears to respond slowly to increasing
overall CUB.

If subsequent information such as levels of gene expression and tRNA pools becomes available for all 12 species
considered here, then what we have referred to as "preferred" codons, may eventually become considered "optimal" codons sensu [6].
Heterogeneity among chromosome arms (elements)
As noted in Figure 6, genes on the different chromosomal
arms of Drosophila, or elements, have different codon
usage. We discussed above the role of recombination and
its lack in element F in many species of Drosophila and
how this affects on codon usage. Less clear is why element
A, an X chromosome in all species, has more biased CDS
than other elements. This is true not only in Drosophila,
but also in Caenorhabditis [34]. Two factors have been
suggested, the hemizygosity of X in males and dosage
compensation [34,50]. Exactly the role of these factors is
unknown, although the evidence is that, whatever the factor(s) affecting X chromosome codon usage they are still
weak. This is most evident in Dpse where an arm, element
D, that is an autosome in many Drosophila has become
part of a metacentric X chromosome. The codon usage
bias in element D in Dpse is indistinguishable from other
autosome arms (Figure 6), implying that not enough time
has elapsed for this element to evolve a true X pattern of
codon usage, although the incorporation of this element
into the X likely occurred at least 10 million years ago
[20]. It will be of considerable interest to observe what has
occurred on element D in Dwil that evidently experienced
a similar fusion of D and A elements around 25 million
years ago [20]; this awaits syntenic assignments for this
species.
Prospects
Here we have presented largely descriptive aspects of
codon usage in Drosophila based on the newly available
complete genome sequences. It can be anticipated that
with further analyses of these genomes, as well as acquisition of relevant data such as from microarray expression
experiments for all 12 species, we will gain increased
insights into the evolution of codon usage and its causes.
Synonymous mutation, the basis of the evolution of
codon usage, are clearly the kind of "nearly neutral" mutations that likely play a large role in molecular evolution
[57]. Examination of codon usage and its evolution provides insights into the dynamics of this crucial class of
mutations that have been fundamental in molding
sequence patterns of genomes.

Materials and methods
Species
Complete (or nearly complete) genomic DNA sequences
for twelve Drosophila species were announced by [3] and
[4]. The species have a well-documented phylogenetic
relationship as noted in Figure 1 of [3], and this figure can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/226

be consulted for details such as times of lineage splitting,
chromosome composition, etc. The genus Drosophila is
split into two major subgenera, Sophophora and Drosophila. Here, "Drosophila" will refer to the genus; the subgenus will be referred to as "subgenus Drosophila". These
subgenera split from each other approximately 50 million
years ago, and the available genomes are from 9 Sophophora and 3 subgenus Drosophila species. For ease of communication, we will use the following abbreviations to
refer to the 12 species: D. melanogaster, Dmel; D. simulans,
Dsim; D sechellia, Dsec; D. yakuba, Dyak; D. erecta, Dere;
D. ananassae, Dana; D. pseudoobscura, Dpse; D. persimilis,
Dper; D. willistoni, Dwil; D. mojavensis, Dmoj; D. virilis,
Dvir; and D. grimshawi, Dgri.
Data
Comparative Assembly Freeze 1 (CAF1) of all 12 genomes
was downloaded from [58]. The final gene annotations
for coding sequences (as of November 16, 2006) were
available from [59]. We confined our analysis to the 6,698
protein-coding sequences (CDSs) that at this time have
been identified as being homologous across all 12 species
as defined in [60]. From these alignments we removed all
codons from poorly aligned regions or those with insertion/deletions. This assured that we only compared
codons for which there is strong evidence of homology
across all 12 species. The D. melanogaster genome
sequence was based on the Flybase release 4.3. There are
221 transcripts corresponding to 89 genes identified in
the fourth chromosome of D. melanogaster. Thirty three of
them were found in the 6,698 homologous CDS set.
Codon usage analysis
Raw counts of the number of times a codon is used for
each amino acid is the basic data. Various ways of summarizing codon usage have been proposed and used here.
Relative synonymous codon usage, RSCU
The most straight forward way to measure codon usage
bias is simply deviation from even usage. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) statistic is calculated by
dividing the observed usage of a codon by that expected if
all codons were used equally frequently [61]. Thus an
RSCU of 1 indicates a codon is used as expected by random (even) usage, RSCU > 1 indicates a codon used more
frequently than expected randomly, and RSCU < 1 indicates a codon used less frequently than random.
Effective number of codons, ENC
Another measure of CUB is "effective number of codons"
[5] which we abbreviate ENC. This is also a measure of the
unevenness of use of codons across all amino acids in a
protein and is estimated by 2 + 9(1/F2) + (1/F3) + 5(1/F4)
+ 3(1/F6) where Fi (i = 1,3, 4, 6). The value of F can be
interpreted as the average "homozygosity" or probability

Page 14 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:226

of two randomly chosen codons for an amino acid being
identical for the i-fold degenerate codon groups. If all
codons for each amino acid are used equally (completely
random usage), ENC will be 61; the other extreme would
be if a single codon is used for each amino acid yielding
an ENC of 20. Because the magnitude or strength of
codon usage bias is negatively correlated with ENC, when
correlating level of CUB with ENC, we use negative ENC.
In its original formulation [5], ENC referred to the average
"homozygosity" across a whole protein-coding sequence.
Moriyama and Powell [7] modified it to be applicable to
each amino acid, X, in a protein, called ENC-X. The maximum possible ENC-X is 2, 3, 4 or 6 depending on the
degeneracy of the particular amino acid; thus to normalize codon bias among amino acids, ENC-X is scaled to
range from 0 (no bias) to 1 (maximum bias); this is abbreviated sENC-X. The sum of sENC-X across all amino acids
is denoted sENC for the protein. Note that sENC is positively correlated with the degree of CUB.

to remove possible sites under splicing restrictions. This
last step limited our intron analysis for those longer than
200 bp (100 bp after removal). In order to further exclude
long introns potentially with embedded CDSs or with
misidentified exons, we also examined introns that are
longer than 100 bp and shorter than 2000 bp (after
removing possible TE sequences and 50 bp from each
end). The GC content of each intron was calculated and
their unweighted average (disregarding intron length) was
obtained from each genome. We also calculated the
weighted GC content from the cumulative GC content
from all introns concatenated. Further details of the
intron data including the GC contents obtained with and
without length limitations are available in the Additional
File 1 and 2. For correlation analysis of GC contents
between introns and CDS of the same gene (Table 2 and
Additional File 1 and 2, only the first intron from each
gene was used for the convenience.

Authors' contributions
Codon adaptation index, CAI
ENC, in its various formulations, and RSCU are nondirectional measures of CUB being simply measures of
unevenness. Codon adaptation index, CAI, was devised
by Sharp and Li [62] as a directional measure of codon
usage relative to a set of pre-defined reference optimal
codons for a species. The identification of the reference set
for each species analyzed here was done by examining the
genes with the lowest ENC (highest bias) and accumulating at least 100 codons for each amino acid; depending on
species, this involved between 12 and 20 most biased
genes. Once the reference set is defined, a gene's CAI is
simply CAIobs/CAImax where CAIobs is the geometric mean
of observed RSCU across all amino acids of a protein and
CAImax is the geometric mean of the maximum RSCU for
each amino acid in the reference set and is the maximum
possible given the particular amino acid composition of
the protein being considered. Thus, CAI measures deviation from the optimum codon usage pattern defined for
that species, 0 being furthest from the optimal set (no
optimal codons used), and 1 indicating only usage of
optimal codons.
Intron base composition
Intron sequences were identified from each of the 12 species' genomes based on the gene model GFF3 files available from the AAAwiki site cited above. In order to exclude
possible transposable element (TE) sequences embedded
in introns, we used the TE annotations based on the
BLASTEr/tblastx analysis by Quesneville et al. [63] (GFF3
files available at [64]). All 12 genomes were first double
masked against their BDGP TE and PILER-DF annotations. Next all introns from the 6,698 homologous gene
set were extracted from each genome. Finally 50 bp each
at the start and end regions of each intron were excluded
