Niche differentiation of two sympatric species of
Microdochium colonizing the roots of common
reed
Michael Ernst1, Karin Neubert1, Kurt W Mendgen1 and Stefan GR Wirsel2,3*

Abstract
Background: Fungal endophyte communities are often comprised of many species colonizing the same host.
However, little is known about the causes of this diversity. On the one hand, the apparent coexistence of closely
related species may be explained by the traditional niche differentiation hypothesis, which suggests that abiotic
and/or biotic factors mediate partitioning. For endophytes, such factors are difficult to identify, and are therefore in
most cases unknown. On the other hand, there is the neutral hypothesis, which suggests that stochastic factors
may explain high species diversity. There is a need to investigate to what extent each of these hypotheses may
apply to endophytes.
Results: The niche partitioning of two closely related fungal endophytes, Microdochium bolleyi and M. phragmitis,
colonizing Phragmites australis, was investigated. The occurrences of each species were assessed using specific
nested-PCR assays for 251 field samples of common reed from Lake Constance, Germany. These analyses revealed
niche preferences for both fungi. From three niche factors assessed, i.e. host habitat, host organ and season, host
habitat significantly differentiated the two species. M. bolleyi preferred dry habitats, whereas M. phragmitis prevailed
in flooded habitats. In contrast, both species exhibited a significant preference for the same host organ, i.e. roots.
Likewise the third factor, season, did not significantly distinguish the two species. Differences in carbon utilization
and growth temperature could not conclusively explain the niches. The inclusion of three unrelated species of
Ascomycota, which also colonize P. australis at the same locations, indicated spatio-temporal niche partitioning
between all fungi. None of the species exhibited the same preferences for all three factors, i.e. host habitat, host
organ, and time of the season.
Conclusions: The fungal species colonizing common reed investigated in this study seem to exploit niche
differences leading to a separation in space and time, which may allow for their coexistence on the same host. A
purely neutral model is unlikely to explain the coexistence of closely related endophytes on common reed.

Background
Traditionally, biodiversity has been explained by the
niche partitioning hypothesis, which stresses that coexisting species are differentiated by niche dimensions. On
the other hand, the neutral hypothesis proposes that
species at the same trophic level colonizing the same
space are functionally equivalent [1], because different
species have the same likelihood of dispersal, death and

birth. Assessment of plant communities has yielded controversial results, some seemed to support the neutral
hypothesis [1-3], whereas others did not [4,5]. Attempts
have been made to resolve the controversy between the
traditional and the neutral hypotheses by integrating
stochastic factors into niche-based models [6]. A metaanalysis comparing 158 community studies, covering a
wide range of habitats, regions and organisms indicated
that the neutral hypothesis explained the observed data
well in 8% of the cases [7]. However, 44% of the studies
matched traditional niche partitioning models, whereas
the remaining studies either matched mixed models or
were not assigned. Thus, niche factors appear to be

essential in many cases for explaining biodiversity but
the integration of stochastic elements may improve
interpretation. Most research addressing these hypotheses has been performed with plants and animals. For
fungi, such research has focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which are widespread root symbionts
of a vast range of plant species. AM fungi promote host
nutrition, diversity and survival under biotic and abiotic
stress conditions [8,9]. Besides AM fungi, other types of
fungal mutualists, for example endophytes, can improve
the health and the performance of plants. Studies on
endophytes have assessed their occurrences and their
influences on their hosts and on plant community structure [10-13]. However, further research is required to
elucidate the causes and mechanisms leading to the
observed diversity of endophytes.
Common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex
Steudel) has been used as a model to investigate the
interactions of a plant with its associated mycoflora
and the interactions between different fungi colonizing
the same host. Previously, it was found that many different fungi colonized healthy common reed growing
in the native freshwater habitats of Lake Constance in
the northern alpine forelands of Germany. The number of fungal species identified by cultivation-independent, molecular approaches [14,15] clearly exceeded
those isolated by classical cultivation [16,17]. However, only a fraction of the many fungal species present reached a high prevalence, suggesting that
competition and niche differentiation may shape these
communities.
Abiotic and biotic factors, which distinguish various
niches and which may allow some fungal species to
dominate over others, are manifold. One approach to
identify such factors is to analyze distribution patterns
of fungal species observed in classical cultivation
schemes, in gene libraries from cloned environmental
DNA or in datasets generated using other molecular
approaches. The need for sufficient replications in such
studies can be met by employing nested-PCR assays that
monitor specific fungal species in large collections of
field samples. For common reed in Lake Constance
these analyses revealed that habitat type and host organ
influenced the occurrences of two uncultured fungi [15].
Additional abiotic and biotic factors that may lead to
niche differentiation like temperature, pH, carbon, nitrogen, and other resources can be analyzed, if cultured
strains are available.
Isolates belonging to the genus Microdochium (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina, Sordariomycetes, Xylariales),
were the most frequent among those recovered from P.
australis under conditions favoring the isolation of
endophytes [16]. These Microdochium isolates were preliminarily assigned to Microdochium sp. and M.

phragmitis. The former, which was later characterized as
M. bolleyi, was shown to colonize living roots of reed
without causing symptoms [18]. M. bolleyi has a broader
host range, since it occurs as a minor root pathogen or
an endophyte on other grasses as well [19-21]. M.
phragmitis seems, however, to associate only with reed.
To investigate coexistence, several approaches were
used to search for evidence of niche partitioning
between fungal species sympatrically colonizing common reed at Lake Constance. Presence-absence patterns
were obtained using specific nested-PCR assays on a
large set of field samples determining co-occurrences of
the two Microdochium species and three additional,
unrelated species. Furthermore, whether divergent
growth temperature optima and resource partitioning
could define the niches of the two closely related fungal
species was examined.

Methods
Cultivation of fungi

The fungal isolates used in this study (Additional file 1)
originated from a previously published study [16]. Reference strains were purchased from CBS (Utrecht, Netherlands). All fungi were cultured on 2% malt agar
(Biomalt, Villa Natura Gesundprodukte GmbH, Kirn,
Germany) at 20°C in the dark.
Mycelial growth rates were determined using three
culture replicates for each isolate and each temperature
assayed. These ranged from 0°C to 30°C at intervals of
5°C. The mycelial radii for all cultures were determined
after 14 d and additionally at 7 d for cultures incubated
at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C. Four individual isolates were analyzed for the 5/97-16 sequence
type and five isolates for the 5/97-54 sequence type.
Two reference strains were used for M. bolleyi (CBS
137.64, CBS 172.63), and for M. nivale (CBS 110.94,
CBS 320.78), respectively. Where applicable, data from
strain replicates were combined and averaged. The data
were analyzed statistically using the Dunnett test and
multifactorial analysis of variance (MANOVA) that
separately analyzed the growth rates of the isolates
belonging to a species and their individual replicates
(confidence limits at P < 0.05). Both tests were implemented using JMP software version 4.04 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis

DNA preparations from fungal mycelia were performed
as described previously [22]. DNA preparations from
reed tissues used for nested-PCR assays had been conducted earlier [17,22] and were kept frozen at -20°C.
Reed was harvested from Lake Constance (Germany) at
four sites, described previously [16].

DNA sequences of the ITS (internal transcribed
spacers) rDNA region from fungal isolates were produced, assembled, aligned and edited as previously
described [22].
Phylogenetic analysis relied on the alignment of 37
sequences created using the software ClustalX ftp://ftp.
ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/mac/clustalx and then manually
adjusted. The alignment comprised the ITS1-box, the
5.8S rRNA gene, and the ITS2-box. Besides the
sequences of isolates listed in Additional file 1
sequences from related fungi were included that were
detected using BlastN searches in public databases. The
program PAUP Version 4.0b10 was used to generate the
phylogenetic tree depicted in Figure 1[23]. The BioNJ

Page 3 of 13

method with the HKY85 setting for distance measures
was used to create a tree that served to estimate the
proportions of invariable sites and gamma shapes. A
heuristic search under the maximum likelihood criterion
and the GTR+G+I substitution model, using the neighbor-joining tree as input, was created. The confidence of
the resulting ML tree was estimated using 1000 quartet
puzzle steps.
Sequences obtained during this study were deposited
in the EMBL-EBI Nucleotide Sequence Database (European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) under the
accession numbers AM502255 to AM502266 (Additional file 1).

Nested-PCR assays

DNA preparations originated from 251 samples of 66
standing reed plants that were harvested from Lake
Constance from July 1998 to August 2001 [17]. The
same DNA preparations had been used earlier to determine the distribution of three additional fungi that were
frequently observed in common reed using specific
nested-PCR assays [15,17]. These previous data allowed
assessment of fungal co-occurrence at a broader scale
investigating whether other fungi may have influenced
the prevalence of Microdochium spp. Two of the additional fungi were uncultured Ascomycota and were originally identified using a molecular approach [15]. They
were designated as Ms7Mb4 (related to Podospora) and
Ms43Mb21 (distantly related to an uncharacterized ericoid mycorrhizal fungus). The third fungus was an
endophyte, Stagonospora sp. 4/99-1 that originated from
cultivation [17].
The first PCR-step of the two-step nested-PCR assay
targeted the Eumycota using the primers ITS1F and
ITS4. Reaction mixtures contained: 100 ng of DNA, 2
mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin, 0.25 μM of each primer and 0.05 U/μL of
recombinant Taq DNA Polymerase (MBI Fermentas) in
a total volume of 25 μL. An initial denaturation step at
94°C for 150 s was followed by 40 cycles of the following protocol: 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 15 s and 72°C for
45 s plus one additional second per cycle. The reaction
was terminated by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
The second PCR step applied specific primers annealing
at the highly variable ITS1 and ITS2 boxes. These primers were: 5/97-54/ITS.F2 (5’-GGT GCT GGA AAC
AGT GCT GCC AC-3’) and 5/97-54/ITS.R2 (5’-GTC
GTC TGG CCG GCT TGC AG-3’) that were derived
from the sequence of isolate M. bolleyi 5/97-54 (Accession no. AJ279475), and 5/97-16/ITS.F2 (5’-ACC CGA
AAG GGT GCT GGA AG-3’) and 5/97-16/ITS.R2 (5’TTG GCT ATC GTC TAG ACG TGT TCA A-3’) that
were derived from the sequence of M. phragmitis 5/9716 (Accession No. AJ279481). Reaction mixtures contained: 0.25 μL of the first PCR reaction, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.125 μM of each primer and 0.05 U/μL of recombinant Taq DNA Polymerase in a total volume of 25 μL.
Reactions with primers 5/97-54/ITS.F2 and 5/97-54/ITS.
R2 included an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 120
s that was followed by 5 cycles of a touch-down protocol (94°C for 30 s, 82°C for 45 s with a decrease of 1°C
per cycle) and then by 40 additional cycles (94°C for 30
s, 77°C for 45 s plus one additional second per cycle).
This was followed by a final extension at 77°C for 10
min. Reactions with primers 5/97-16/ITS.F2 and 5/9716/ITS.R2, basically followed the same scheme but had
an initial annealing temperature of 77°C at the first

Page 4 of 13

cycle, followed by a touch-down to 72°C. Positive and
negative controls included genomic DNAs of target and
non-target fungi, respectively.
Results of nested-PCR assays were scored as 0 vs. 1
and statistically analyzed using a contingency table and
a binomial distribution test (P < 0.05) with the Bonferroni correction. The co-occurrences of two fungi in the
same samples were examined using pair-wise contingency analysis and two-sided Fisher’s Exact test (confidence limits at P <0.05) to determine deviation from a
random distribution, either positive or negative. Fisher’s
Exact test provides a precise likelihood for the observed
distribution, but is restricted to pair-wise analysis. These
statistical analyses were performed using JMP version
4.04. Analyses of co-occurrences of several species were
carried out with the Co-occurrence module in the software EcoSim Version 7.72 http://garyentsminger.com/
ecosim/index.htm. EcoSim applies a Monte Carlo
approach to create a random distribution of data for statistical testing that is compared to the experimental data
to test the null hypothesis that the co-occurrence patterns observed in the field samples result from random
variation (confidence limits at P <0.05) [24]. The recommended default settings were used except for the number of randomized data matrices generated by the
software, which was increased to 10000. It had previously been suggested that deviation from other default
program settings, that keep the number of species
observed in each sample ("fixed columns”) constant, as
well as the sum of the incidences of each species ("fixed
rows”) for the randomizations, could result in misleading assertions [25].
Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with PCORD version 5.10 (MjM Software Design, Gleneden
Beach, OR) was used to assess the degree to which each
of three factors analyzed contributed to the frequencies
of the fungi detected in the field samples. CCA used the
incidences of five species examined for 46 distinct habitat-organ-month combinations. In CCA setup, axis
scores were standardized using Hill’s method. Axes were
scaled to combine representation of species and stands.
Stand scores were treated as linear combinations of factors. Graph ordination was set up in two dimensions to
present the two most important factors. A Monte Carlo
permutation test based on 999 random permutations
was applied to test the null hypothesis that the community was independent of the analyzed factors.
Registration of substrate utilization spectra

Microdochium isolates were grown in liquid medium
containing 4 g/L glucose, 10 g/L malt extract, 4 g/L
yeast extract [26] for 3-7 d at 20°C and 120 rpm to
obtain the inoculum for the physiological tests. The
reed strains A7, 4/97-7, 5/97-48, 5/97-49, and 5/97-54

Ernst et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:242

were taken for M. bolleyi, whereas 4/97-39, 5/97-16, 5/
97-30, and 6/97-20 represented M. phragmitis. In addition, reference strains from CBS, (Additional file 1) were
analyzed. Mycelia were harvested using filtration,
washed with autoclaved distilled water and re-suspended
in 2% carrageenan type II (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) to provide an OD590 of 0.05. Each well of a BIOLOG SF-N2 plate (Merlin Diagnostika GmbH,
Bornheim, Germany) was inoculated with 100 μl of
mycelial suspension. These microtiter plates contained
95 different carbon sources and one control well without any carbon source. Plates were incubated for 10 d at
21°C in the dark. Thereafter, absorption at 560 nm was
recorded using an ELISA reader (SLT Spectra, SLT
Laborinstrumente GmbH, Grödig, Austria). After
exporting the data to Microsoft Excel, the absorption in
the control well was defined as 0% growth and that of
the well with the maximum absorption as 100%. All
other values were scaled in relation to these limits. For
each isolate tested, three independent experiments were
performed and the transformed results were averaged.
The t-test and the Dunnett test in JMP were used to
assess the variation between species for each carbon
source using the average values of each isolate (confidence limits at P <0.05). Furthermore, the overall similarity of carbon usage patterns between species was
compared using the Niche Overlap module in EcoSim
[24]. All four EcoSim randomization algorithms (RA1RA4) were used to generate 10000 simulated data
matrices in each case. For all other parameter settings,
the default was used.

Results
Molecular characterization of Microdochium isolates

A molecular phylogeny of the ITS region was generated
that included previous sequences from Microdochium
spp. [16], new sequences from Lake Constance reed isolates and from CBS reference strains (Additional file 1),
and in addition, sequences from databases that were
identified by BlastN searches. The phylogeny indicated
the existence of three different sequence variants among
the isolates colonizing common reed at Lake Constance
(Figure 1). Eight isolates had identical sequences and
were typified by the previously described isolate 5/97-16
[16]. This sequence variant had 98.4% identity to the
reference M. phragmitis (CBS 285.71). A single isolate,
5/97-66, was identical to CBS 285.71. We treated all
these isolates as M. phragmitis. This degree of similarity
was clearly higher than the limit of 97% that had previously been suggested to differentiate fungal species
using their ITS sequence [27,28]. Furthermore, because
intraspecific variation in the rRNA gene cluster is
known in eukaryotes including fungi, a higher threshold
value may introduce the risk of wrongly dividing isolates

Page 5 of 13

belonging to a single species into different species. A
previous study found that intraspecific ITS variation
ranged from 0.16 to 2.85% in Ascomycota and Basidiomycota [29]. Another group of seven isolates had
sequences that formed a cluster with the references M.
bolleyi CBS 137.64 and CBS 172.63. They diverged by at
most 0.5% from each other. Therefore, and because typical morphological characters were highly similar compared to these references (data not shown), the
previously described Microdochium sp. typified by isolate 5/97-54 [16] was treated here as M. bolleyi. None of
the isolates from reed clustered with references belonging to M. nivale or any of the other species included in
the phylogram.
Nested-PCR assays indicate niche differentiation of
Microdochium spp

To examine whether colonization of P. australis by the
two species of Microdochium reflected stochastic patterns or niche differentiation two nested-PCR assays
were designed that specifically targeted the ITS
sequence of the 5/97-16 and of the 5/97-54 sequence
variants. The specificities of these assays were tested
using genomic DNA preparations as templates that
were extracted from the fungal isolates typifying the
Microdochium sequence variants identified above and
from additional isolates belonging to other genera of
Ascomycota that had been recovered from P. australis
earlier [16]. Genomic DNA from aseptically grown P.
australis served as an additional negative control. As
anticipated, the first PCR step, which used standard
primers targeting the Eumycota, yielded reaction products with all fungal templates (Additional file 2A).
The second PCR steps using primers directed against
the individual Microdochium species yielded reaction
products only with DNA from the targeted fungi
(Additional file 2B-C).
The incidences of the two Microdochium species in
251 DNA samples covering a period of three years, four
host organs, i.e. rhizome, root, stem, and leaf, and two
contrasting habitat types, i.e. flooded and dry, were analyzed. Both targets were generally detectable in all
organs, at all sites and throughout the seasons. The
overall detection frequency was 22% for M. phragmitis
and 27% for M. bolleyi. From each nested-PCR series
one randomly chosen product for each host organ was
sequenced to validate the correctness of the method
employed. Each of the eight PCR-products corresponded
to the respective previously determined sequences (data
not shown).
In general, the results from the nested-PCRs on the
field samples indicated for both targets, but especially
for M. phragmitis, a reduced prevalence during the
warm summer months when the data were pooled

across host habitat and host organ (Figure 2). Statistical
support for this observation was obtained for M. phragmitis when comparing its minimum, i.e. July, in a pairwise manner with the other months that demonstrated
a significant difference to April (binomial test, P =
0.006) and November (P = 0.007). In addition, the variance between September and November was also significant (P = 0.007). When applying the stringent
Bonferroni corrections on an analysis testing all months
against each other, all variations appeared non-significant. Variations in the corresponding data for the other
target, M. bolleyi, did not show any significance, neither
when analyzed in a pair-wise manner nor in a total analysis. For both targets, there was no statistical support
for seasonal variation when evaluating the results for the
individual host organs separately (data not shown, binomial test with P <0.05, Bonferroni corrected). When
comparing the detection frequencies of the two fungi
against each other none of the apparent variations
proved to be significant for any month when the data
were pooled across organs (binomial test with P <0.05,
Bonferroni corrected) (Figure 2).
Statistical analysis of variation with respect to the
colonized host organ revealed for both, M. phragmitis
and M. bolleyi, a significant preference for roots (binomial test with P <0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Besides
host organ, also the host habitat affected the incidences
of the fungi. M. phragmitis occurred significantly more
frequently at flooded sites compared to dry sites (27%
vs. 16%, binomial test, P = 0.0385) when the data were
pooled across organ. The opposite result was obtained
for M. bolleyi (19% vs. 34%, binomial test, P = 0.0110).
When examining variation resolved for all host organhabitat type combinations (Figure 3, small letters), M.

phragmitis showed a significant preference for roots at
flooded sites (P = 0.0127), whereas M. bolleyi significantly preferred roots (P = 0.0002) and in addition rhizomes (P = 0.0386) at the dry sites. Comparisons
between the two species showed that roots were the
only organs with significantly contrasting preferences for
the habitat type (root-flooded: P = 0.0213; root-dry: P =
0.00004) (Figure 3, capital letters).
Carbon utilization patterns of Microdochium spp

To determine whether resource partitioning, as a biotic
attribute, may have contributed to these findings the
potential of Microdochium spp. to utilize 95 different
carbon sources was tested in vitro. The EcoSim Niche
Overlap module was used to evaluate the overall similarity in carbon usage. The niche overlap index in the
experimentally obtained data set was 0.9733, whereas
the mean of the simulated matrices was 0.7127, using
default parameters for calculation (RA3 model). This
difference was statistically significant (P <0.05), and thus
indicated that the carbon usage of the two species was
overall more similar than expected by chance. The
application of alternative parameters for the calculation
(i.e. the RA1, RA2, and RA4 models) led to the same
conclusion. In addition, intra-species comparison of different strains belonging to the same species showed that
within each of the two species there were significantly
more resource overlaps than expected by chance (data
not shown).
Although the carbon utilization capabilities of the two
species were similar, specific differences existed, which
were statistically assessed using t-tests. Significant differences between the two species (P <0.05) were observed
for 21 substrates (22.1%) (Additional file 3). In addition,

the same results (not shown). M. bolleyi grew significantly better than M. phragmitis on 10 of the 95 carbon

of M. bolleyi up to 20°C. However, they grew much
more slowly above 20°C, which was their maximum,
and they completely ceased to grow at 30°C. This also
applied to M. nivale, which was used as an outgroup.
When such cultures were transferred to a temperature

that these fungi were still viable. Dunnett tests (P <

Whether temperature optima determined in vitro
could correspond to soil temperature at sites where the
fungi were originally isolated was investigated. Three
data loggers were buried at a soil depth of 20 cm at one
of the original locations on the shores of Lake Constance to record hourly ambient temperatures from
March 2005 to February 2006 (K. Neubert & J. Nechwatal, data not shown). The average annual soil temperature was 11.1°C with a maximum reaching slightly
above 21°C, which occurred for only a few days in summer. Both species grew equally well in vitro at 21°C.

Co-occurrences of five fungal species

Four statistical tests were used to analyze the occurrences of five fungi, i.e. the binomial distribution test,
the EcoSim Co-occurrence module [24], Fisher’s Exact
test and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA).
Except for CCA, one combined data set, including
nested-PCR results from all 251 samples, was analyzed
simultaneously using each method, and in addition, several partial data sets were analyzed to examine occurrences for season, host organ, host habitat, and for the
combination of organ plus habitat, respectively.
First, the binomial distribution test (P <0.05) with
Bonferroni corrections was applied to examine whether
within a given data set the total incidence of one species
differed significantly from that of another species. Three
of ten species pair comparisons using the undivided
data set showed significantly contrasting occurrences
(Additional file 4). These three comparisons involved
Ms43Mb21, which was generally less prevalent than all
other species. Although season did not significantly
separate the species pair M. phragmitis - M. bolleyi (as
mentioned above), the inclusion of the three additional
species showed that this factor contributed to the
separation of the five species. Four of 60 species pair
comparisons (6.7%) using data sets divided by months
(ten species pairs, six months) showed significant differences (Figure 5A, Additional file 4). Nine of 40 species
pair comparisons (22.5%) using data sets divided by host
organ showed significant differences (Additional file 4).
Five of 20 species pair comparisons (25%) using data
sets divided by habitat type showed significant differences (Additional file 4). Ten of 80 species pair comparisons (12.5%) using data sets divided by the combination
of organ plus habitat showed significant differences (Figure 5B, Additional file 4).
The second statistical test was the Co-occurrence module of EcoSim. In a total data set comprising all five species, significantly less co-occurrence was observed
compared to the null hypothesis (P <0.05; data not
shown). The analyses of data matrices that reflected the
distributions of the five species in the individual months
exhibited significantly decreased co-occurrences in

flooded, showed significantly decreased co-occurrences.
From the eight organ-habitat combinations, only stems
from the dry habitat exhibited a significant decrease.
We did not observe a significant increase of co-occurrence in any of the analyses.
The third statistical test applied was Fisher’s Exact test
(P <0.05) with Bonferroni corrections to determine if
certain species pairs may co-occur significantly more or
less frequently in the same samples than expected by
chance. Three of ten species pair comparisons (M. bolleyi vs. Ms7Mb4 and vs. Ms43Mb21, respectively, and
Ms7Mb4 vs. Ms43Mb21) using the undivided data set
showed significantly more co-occurrences (Additional

sympatrically colonizing Phragmitis australis was assessed.
M. bolleyi and M. phragmitis were found to be significantly segregated for host habitat, but not for host organ
and season. However, when additional, unrelated fungi
that colonize the same host were also included in the analyses, the latter two factors were also found to contribute
to niche partitioning.
Several factors can cause niche differentiation between
endophytes, which may attenuate competition and thus
allow for a high fungal diversity on the same host species. One factor is space, which is with respect to endophytes hierarchically structured from continent to
region, to habitat, to host individual, to host organ, and
further down to the level of host cells. Two of these
levels, i.e. the habitat type and the host organ, were analyzed. Both, M. bolleyi and M. phragmitis, preferentially
colonize the same organ, i.e. roots, confirming an earlier
result [16]. Within the limits of detection, nested-PCR
assays in this study indicated that M. bolleyi occurs
more frequently on roots at dry sites, whereas M. phragmitis occurs more frequently on roots at flooded sites.
This suggests spatial niche partitioning at the level of
habitat type. Like all molecular assays employing fungal
genomic DNA extracted from field samples, the assays
from this study cannot distinguish between growing and
dormant cells, and thus cannot provide details on metabolic activities or developmental stages. In addition, a
possible introduction of bias against rare templates during the first stage of the nested-PCR has to be considered, which would produce false-negative results in case
of fungi present at very low abundance. However, if the
first step of nested-PCR comprises as many cycles as
used here rare templates will be over- not under-amplified, as previously shown [30]. Thus, for assessment of
presence-absence data nested-PCR is a highly specific
and sensitive method.

file 5). Only the pairing of Stagonospora sp. vs. Ms7Mb4
co-occurred less frequently than expected by chance.
Neither the analyses of the 60 species pair comparisons
using data sets divided by months nor those of the 40
comparisons using data sets divided by host organ
showed any significant differences when applying Bonferroni corrections (Additional file 5). In contrast, examination of data sets separated for host habitat revealed
that M. bolleyi co-occurred with Ms7Mb4 and
Ms43Mb21 more frequently at the dry habitat than
expected by chance. Under the same conditions, M. bolleyi co-occurred with Stagonospora sp. less frequently.
None of the 80 pair-wise species comparisons that
examined data sets divided by the combination of organ
plus habitat showed significantly increased or decreased
co-occurrences (Additional file 5).
Finally, CCA was used to estimate which of the analyzed factors most influenced the occurrences of five
species in all samples analyzed. Space at the level of
organ explained 32.9% of the observed total variation,
whereas space at the level of habitat and time at the
level of months did so for 5.5% and 0.1%, respectively.
A plot including the two main axes indicated that all
five species were well separated for at least one factor
(Figure 6). It underlined that Stagonospora sp. was distinguished from the other species mainly because of its
distinct organ preferences. The CCA plot confirmed
that habitat type was most important for separation of
the two Microdochium species. For the remaining species, both organ and habitat determined their
separation.

Further support for an influence of spatial niche partitioning on the composition of the reed-associated fungal
community was obtained when occurrences of three
additional species were also considered. Both binomial
tests and CCA indicated that all five species were differentiated by host organ and / or habitat. Since P. australis has a vast geographical distribution, it would be
interesting to assess the factor space in structuring fungal communities at higher hierarchical levels in the
future.
The importance of space in affecting fungal community composition has previously been acknowledged.
Much of this information comes from pathogens of
agronomically important crops [31] and from mycorrhizal fungi [14,32-36]. In addition, endophyte communities
seem also to be influenced by the factor space [37-39].
However, in contrast to other types of fungi, little is
known about the causes leading to spatial differentiation
in endophytes. At the same sites examined in this study
an even more distinct preference for the habitat type
was previously noted for AM fungi that were not
observed at flooded sites at all, whereas at the dry sites,
21 phylotypes were detected at various frequencies [14].
Vertical distribution patterns of reed-associated fungi
have been recorded in a brackish tidal marsh, with
diverse communities depending on the leaf layer [40].
Site-dependent differences in reed stands are known for
Oomycota, where some species preferred either dry or
flooded sites [41]. It seems likely that it is not space per
se, but rather specific physico-chemical features of the
respective sites that cause such differences.
Another factor that can cause niche differentiation
between fungal endophytes is time, resolved here at the
scale of individual months of the season. The progress
of the season drives host developmental processes like
the emergence of shoots and leaves in spring and senescence in autumn, and thus dynamically modifies the
niches available to plant-associated fungi. The occurrences of M. bolleyi and M. phragmitis were similar for
season. Thus, seasonal niche partitioning does not seem
to significantly separate Microdochium spp. on common
reed. However, binomial tests indicated that time was a
factor involved in the separation of the five species
analyzed.
The contribution of seasonal variation to fungal community variation has previously been recognized. Endophytic colonization of tropical cacao trees increased
with leaf age and partially protected the host against
pathogenic Phytophthora sp. [42]. Similarly, endophytic
diversity increased during leaf development in Camellia
japonica, whereas epiphytic diversity remained stable
with season [43]. Seasonal succession was also demonstrated for the mycoflora in a Colorado mountain soil
that changed substantially between spring and summer,

Page 10 of 13

suggesting functional differentiation [44]. Seasonal variation has been found in an aquatic fungal community
decomposing plant debris in streams [45]. In reed stands
at Lake Constance, Oomycota populations were shown
previously to exhibit seasonal variation [46]. For the
reed pathogen Pythium phragmitis, minimal detection in
August resembled the decrease of Microdochium spp.
during the summer.
Temporal niche differentiation thus contributes to the
separation of the five species examined, although to a lesser extent than space. Thus, niche differences resulting
from abiotic or biotic attributes seem to separate these
fungi and may explain their coexistence on the same
host. Temperature was one attribute that distinguished
the two Microdochium species in vitro. M. phragmitis,
which occurs more frequently at flooded sites, grows faster at lower temperatures, whereas M. bolleyi, which prefers dry sites, grows faster at higher temperatures. For
most of the year, based on the in vitro growth rates, temperatures existed in the soil at which M. phragmitis
would grow faster than M. bolleyi if additional factors
such as competing fungi are not considered. In this context, temperature contributes to the differentiation of
other Microdochium species [47,48].
Other attributes may be involved in spatial niche differentiation for habitat type observed for Microdochium
spp. Carbon usage patterns of the two species were
found to overlap significantly more than expected by
chance, although certain substrates, including compounds of the central carbon metabolism, secondary
sugars, and sugar alcohols, are utilized differentially. In
P. australis site-dependent variations for central metabolites were reported [49]. Basal culm internodes from
flooded sites had higher total amino acid and lower
total carbohydrate contents than those from dry sites.
Several metabolites were individually recorded in that
study, but none of those varying for habitat type could
explain the contrasting habitat preferences of the two
Microdochium species when considering the results of
the BIOLOG experiments.
Earlier studies have noted that host-derived carbohydrates might affect the occurrences of plant-associated
fungi. Root-associated endophytes grew better in vitro
on low concentrations of certain carbohydrates than rhizosphere and soil fungi retrieved from the same Austrian grassland [50]. It was suggested, “that plant sugars
or sugar alcohols may constitute signals that facilitate
adaptation of certain fungi to a specific host plant”.
Some of such compounds are differentially utilizable by
Microdochium spp. Another study reported that Neotyphodium endophytes were inhibited in vitro by high
concentrations of hexose and were incapable of utilizing
xylose and arabinose [51]. These findings were supported by results showing that Neotyphodium lolii

Ernst et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:242
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/242

grows more slowly in varieties of its host Lolium perenne bred for intrinsically high sugar concentrations
[52]. For AM fungi, it was suggested that competition
for the same carbon sources present in the same niche
caused differential colonization [53]. A report comparing
ericoid and orchid mycorrhizal fungi found that carbon
source utilization was generally quite similar in vitro
except for distinct differences for tannic acid and certain
amino acids [54]. These publications indicate that the
quality and the quantity of carbon sources available in
the host may be one of the attributes influencing the
composition of the associated fungal community.
Although the BIOLOG system provides interesting
insights in the capacity of fungi to utilize various carbon
sources, the difference in growth conditions in vitro compared to in planta should be considered. Single carbon
sources are tested in vitro, whereas in planta many different sources are present. For the moment, it is not clear
whether the carbon sources differentially used by Microdochium spp. in vitro are available at contrasting levels in
roots or whether they have physiological importance for
the fungi. Furthermore, competition with other endophytes for carbon sources may also influence their occurrences in the field. Thus, the challenging task remains to
prove that differential utilization of carbon sources in vitro
contributes to the coexistence of endophytes in planta.
Interactions between species implied by positive or
negative co-occurrence was the third factor examined
with respect to the differential colonization of the roots
of common reed by Microdochium spp. Although spatial
niche partitioning between M. bolleyi and M. phragmitis
was significant, it was not perfect. Since none of the comparisons assessed by Fisher’s Exact test exhibited any
negative co-occurrence, a direct antagonism between
these two species is unlikely. Moreover, in 8.4% of the
samples both species were detected which may suggest
“true” coexistence. Otherwise, reduced competition for
space or carbon (or other essential compounds and ions)
may explain this finding. This could occur if colony sizes
were much smaller than sample sizes or if the two species
used different resources. However, the two Microdochium species constitute only a small part of the entire
fungal community colonizing common reed. Thus, antagonism or synergism might be indicated when considering
additional fungi. This is already seen when including the
data available for three more species. Whereas the EcoSim analysis suggests an overall signature of negative cooccurrence, Fisher’s Exact test indicates negative and
positive co-occurrences for certain species pairings. It is
noteworthy that none of the three additional species
exhibited negative co-occurrence with M. bolleyi and M.
phragmitis in the total data set. Instead, M. bolleyi generally co-occurred significantly more frequently with
Ms7Mb4 and Ms43Mb21 than expected by chance. Such

Page 11 of 13

a positive co-occurrence may appear when the conditions
that are conducive for one species are also favorable for
another species. Alternatively, positive co-occurrence
may result from synergism. On the other hand, there
existed an overall negative co-occurrence between Stagonospora sp. and Ms7Mb4, significantly preferring leaves
[17] and roots [15], respectively. This could have resulted
from strongly contrasting niche preferences, severe competition for the same substrates or from the secretion of
toxins (antagonism). Our results suggest that it is rather
unlikely that antagonism by any of the other three fungi
is responsible for the differential colonization of roots by
Microdochium spp. Since the fungal community on common reed is larger than addressed here, we cannot rule
out that other endophytes may exert such influences.

Conclusions
This study supports the concept that niche partitioning
allows for differential colonization of common reed by
the fungal species investigated. Therefore, a purely neutral model is unlikely to explain the assembly of the
mycoflora of common reed. Nonetheless, it remains to
be shown to what extent stochastic factors could also
contribute to variations in the composition, distribution
and diversity of this fungal community.
