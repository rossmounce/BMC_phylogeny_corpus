Identification, analysis, and linkage mapping of
expressed sequence tags from the Australian
sheep blowfly
Siu F Lee1*†, Zhenzhong Chen1†, Annette McGrath2, Robert T Good1 and Philip Batterham1

Abstract
Background: The Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is a destructive pest
of the sheep, a model organism for insecticide resistance research, and a valuable tool for medical and forensic
professionals. However, genomic information on L. cuprina is still sparse.
Results: We report here the construction of an embryonic and 2 larval cDNA libraries for L. cuprina. A total of
29,816 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained and assembled into 7,464 unique clusters. The sequence
collection captures a great diversity of genes, including those related to insecticide resistance (e.g., 12 cytochrome
P450s, 2 glutathione S transferases, and 6 esterases). Compared to Drosophila melanogaster, codon preference is
different in 13 of the 18 amino acids encoded by redundant codons, reflecting the lower overall GC content in L.
cuprina. In addition, we demonstrated that the ESTs could be converted into informative gene markers by
capitalizing on the known gene structures in the model organism D. melanogaster. We successfully assigned 41
genes to their respective chromosomes in L. cuprina. The relative locations of these loci revealed high but
incomplete chromosomal synteny between L. cuprina and D. melanogaster.
Conclusions: Our results represent the first major transcriptomic undertaking in L. cuprina. These new genetic
resources could be useful for the blowfly and insect research community.

Background
The Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is an important biological
tool for medical treatment and forensic investigation.
Disinfected blowfly larvae are routinely used in maggot
debridement therapy to promote wound healing [1-3].
The necrophagous nature of L. cuprina also makes it
invaluable for forensic analysis, particularly in estimating
postmortem interval [4]. In contrast to these beneficial
roles, L. cuprina is the primary cause of flystrike in
Australia and New Zealand [5,6]. The practice of surgical
mulesing, as well as various chemical insecticides, has
been used to control this formidable pest. However, fly
populations often evolved resistance rapidly [7-10].

Research into the genetic and biochemical mechanisms
of resistance has provided some of the best examples of
genetic adaptation to selection [11-13].
Despite its medical and agronomical importance and its
historical status as one of the model organisms in insecticide resistance research, genomic information on
L. cuprina is still relatively sparse. The haploid genome is
approximately 810 mega bases [14], which is about 5
times the genome size of Drosophila melanogaster. Polytene in situ hybridization and genetic mapping studies
have determined the basic organization of its 6 chromosomes [15-17]. In 1993, Weller and Foster published a
recombination map based on 72 morphological and
enzyme markers, and this remains the most comprehensive linkage map of L. cuprina to date [18]. The chromosomal location of these markers indicates that the major
linkage elements (i.e., Muller’s Elements) remain relatively
conserved in higher Diptera [18].
To combat this insect pest more intelligently, it is desirable to improve our knowledge of its genetic makeup.

Molecular tools have become increasingly accessible to
generate large amount of information in a cost-effective
manner. As the per-base cost of DNA sequencing continues to fall, large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST)
projects have been accomplished in many insect species,
and thousands of ESTs have been deposited in public
databases, including higher dipteran species such as the
screwworm Cochliomyia hominivorax [19] and the tsetse
fly Glossina morsitans [20].
This paper describes a similar gene discovery effort to
identify transcripts expressed in preadult stages
(embryonic and larval). An assembly of 7,464 unique
gene clusters was produced from a total of 29,816 ESTs.
The protein-coding contents of this non-redundant
dataset were evaluated via a series of homology analyses.
We short-listed a subset of these L. cuprina genes,
which showed high sequence conservation, favorable
gene structure (suitable exon/intron positions and sizes),
and single correspondence in the D. melanogaster and
Anopheles gambiae genomes. To demonstrate their usefulness in comparative mapping, we carried out

chromosomal assignment of 41 genes to infer interchromosomal rearrangements. Comparison between L.
cuprina and D. melanogaster revealed a high but incomplete chromosomal synteny. This newly generated EST
dataset is a significant step in the systematic buildup of
genomic resources for this important insect in agricultural and medical entomology.

Results
Characteristics of EST assembly

We obtained 13,666 embryonic (JG422424-JG436089),
14,640 first-instar (JG407784-JG422423), and 880 thirdinstar (JG406904-JG407783) ESTs. The combined dataset (29,186 ESTs) was assembled into 7,464 unique clusters (Additional file 1), comprising 2,797 contigs and
4,667 singletons (Figure 1). The basic features of the
sequence assembly are summarized in Figures 2 and 3.
The majority (65.5%) of the 7,464 sequences were 500900 bases in length (Figure 2), and the number of EST
reads in a contig ranged between 2 and 3,700 (Figure 3),
with an average of 8.8 reads (median = 3) per contig.

ESTs from embryonic and larval libraries was assembled into 7,464 unique sequence clusters using the TGICL procedures. E-values from BLAST
searches were arranged in ascending order from left to right, indicated by the darkness of shade.

Abundant transcripts in embryonic and larval stages

Since the cDNA libraries were not normalized, the number of reads in contigs can be used as an indication of
levels of gene expression. Table 1 summarizes information about the most abundantly expressed genes, defined
as contigs containing more than 100 ESTs. The mitochondria-derived transcripts dominate this list, accounting for a total of 5,275 ESTs, or 17% of the entire EST
collection. In comparison to the published Lucilia sericata mitochondrial genome [21], our ESTs captured 12
protein coding genes and the 16S rRNA gene (Additional file 2). In addition to mitochondrial transcripts,
various ribosomal protein genes (RpL6, RpL7A, RpL7,
RpL4, and RpS3A), 18S rRNA, and elongation factors
(ef1-a, ef2, and ef1-g) were also amongst the most highly
expressed genes (Table 1), reflecting the robust translation and protein synthesis processes in the embryonic
and larval stages.
GC content and codon usage bias

Based on results from a set of 200 conserved genes (Additional file 3), the average GC content (mean ± standard
deviation) per coding sequence (CDS) is 0.4344 ± 0.0433

in L. cuprina and 0.5654 ± 0.0418 in D. melanogaster. The
effective number of codons (Nc) is 43.81 in L. cuprina and
40.89 in D. melanogaster. Compared to D. melanogaster,
L. cuprina shows a different codon preference for 13
of the 18 amino acids encoded by redundant codons
(Table 2). The most noticeable changes occur in the preferred codons for glutamine (Q), glutamic acid (E), and
leucine (L).
Protein-coding contents of EST assembly

To evaluate the protein coding contents of our ESTs, the
7,464 non-redundant sequences were subject to various
homology searches against existing sequences (Figure 1).
Our homology analyses showed that 5,257 (70%) of the
non-redundant sequences had significant (E-value ≤ 1e-10)
matches in the public domains (Additional file 4). The
sequences that had recognizable homologs constituted 937
InterProScan and 494 Gene Ontology terms (Additional
files 5 and 6), indicating that a great diversity of protein
motifs and biological processes was represented in our
dataset. We also estimated that ~78% (205 of 262) of the
existing L. cuprina nucleotide sequences in Genbank were
represented in our EST collection. Our Lucilia ESTs

unique polypeptides) at E-value ≤ 1e-10; this is equivalent
to ~24.1% of the total gene count in D. melanogaster
(assuming the total number of genes is ~13,600).
Identification of potential detoxification and insecticide
target genes

We identified 12 cytochrome P450 (Cyp12a5, Cyp12d1,
Cyp302a1 or disembodied, Cyp307a1 or spook,
Cyp317a1, Cyp4d2, Cyp4g15, Cyp6a13, Cyp6d2, Cyp6d4,
Cyp6d5, and Cyp9f2), 2 glutathione S-transferase (GstD1
and GstS1), and 6 esterase (Glt, Nrt, CG9289, alphaEst5, CG9287, and alpha-Est7) homologs in the
L. cuprina (Table 3). In addition to these detoxification
gene families, we also identified ESTs encoding target
proteins that have previously been implicated in insecticide resistance (see [22-25]). These included homologs
of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated
protein (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein; EST =
GI: 333428695), glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 2
(glutamate receptor 6; EST = GI: 333421827), and a
probable sodium channel protein type 9 subunit alpha
(EST = GI:333416352).

Anchor loci development and chromosomal synteny in
higher Diptera

One aim of the current EST project was to identify
single-copy genes that are highly conserved between
species for synteny comparison. Reciprocal homology
searches among L. cuprina, D. melanogaster, and A.
gambiae yielded a set of reciprocal best-hit trios, and
298 of such trios had favorable intron position and
size range in D. melanogaster (Additional file 8). This
list of 298 orthologous groups facilitated our ongoing
linkage map construction in L. cuprina. We successfully assigned 41 gene markers to 5 linkage groups
using a male informative pedigree by scoring intron
length polymorphisms (Figure 4). Comparison between
L. cuprina and D. melanogaster based on 41 gene markers revealed a high level of synteny, although several
deviations were also evident (Figure 5; Additional file
9). Deviations included inx3 RpL30, CG3564, RpS13,
and RpL15., A potential translocation or fusion/dissociation event was identified between the smallest chromosome (Muller F in Drosophila) and an autosome
(Muller D in Lucilia), as suggested by the location of
RpS3A (Figure 5).

Discussion
The main outcome of this project is the significant
improvement of the gene inventory for the Australian
sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina. Amongst other applications, this new resource presents promising benefits to
such areas as medical, forensic, pest control, and the
understanding of genetic adaptation to insecticides.
Barring major gene expansion or contraction, and
assuming that L. cuprina has the same number of genes
as in D. melanogaster (~13,600) [26], the 7,464 unique
gene clusters we found in our EST libraries would
account for up to 55% of the genes present in the species. The actual percentage is much lower due to (but
not limited to) the TGICL assembly parameters and the
presence of 4.7% short (≤ 100 bases) sequences (Figure
2). An estimate of 24.1% gene coverage was obtained by
limiting homology comparison to L. cuprina and D. melanogaster. However, fast-evolving genes and gene
families that have been expanded in the blowfly lineage
are under-represented in this analysis. Hence, the estimate of 24.1% could be considered the lower bound of
total gene coverage. Nonetheless, this is a conservative
yet reasonable estimation given that our cDNA libraries
were not experimentally normalized and that only preadult developmental stages contributed to the transcript
pool. The EST sequences contain a large number of

Compared to D. melanogaster, L. cuprina appears to
have low GC content and a different codon preference
for many amino acids. Despite the fact that the comparison was based on 200 conserved gene homologs, the
codon preferences for D. melanogaster are consistent
with those reported by Vicario et al. [27]. The higher
effective Nc in L. cuprina (43.81) than D. melanogaster
(40.89) suggests a weaker selection constraint on codon
usage in L. cuprina, at least for these highly conserved
genes. It is noted that the 200 sequence pairs analyzed
represent only a small fraction (1.5%) of the coding
sequences in the 2 species; perhaps a different pattern
might emerge when less-conserved gene homologs are

included. Nevertheless, these results could be useful for
training gene-finding algorithms and the analysis of the
full genome sequence when it becomes available.
The acquisition of > 3,280 blowfly genes allows more
sophisticated experimental systems to be developed in the
future. Aside from the improvement in the knowledge
about the genetic composition of the species, the dataset
provides a foundation for designing gene-based microarrays for expression profiling. Furthermore, the plasmid
collections can also serve as a permanent source of cDNA
clones for protein expression, in situ hybridization, and
even for transgenic manipulation such as those described
in [28-30]. The sequence knowledge of the housekeeping
genes such as the ribosomal protein genes, tubulin, and
actin could serve as internal controls for quantitative realtime PCR. In fact, the need for such reference genes was
recently discussed in [31]. The availability of the L. cuprina
cDNA sequences would also facilitate quantification of

melanogaster chromosome arms (X, 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, and 4). The corresponding chromosomal origins (II, III, IV, V, and VI) of the Lucilia homologs

expression profiles of many genes of interest, bypassing
the time-consuming gene discovery steps. It is expected
that our EST collection will be invaluable for annotating
the genic regions of the L. cuprina genome, when it is
eventually sequenced. Conversely, the cDNA information
could itself serve as a gene database, such that short peptides generated by the high-throughput proteome sequencing, similar to those reported in the brain tissues of
another blowfly, Protophormia terraenovae [32], could be
compared, forming a transcriptomic-proteomic feed-forward loop.
We identified genes that are related to insecticide
resistance in L. cuprina (Table 3). Isolation of these
homologs in L. cuprina would allow their expression
patterns to be accurately measured (e.g., by real-time
PCR), and their roles in insecticide resistance to be
evaluated. PCR assays to screen for naturally occurring
DNA polymorphisms (e.g., exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers) could also be developed to monitor the temporal and spatial distribution of different
alleles. While many of their D. melanogaster homologs
have been implicated in insecticide detoxification
[33-36], some of the genes identified are involved in
other developmental processes such as ecdysone biosynthesis (disembodied and spook) [37,38] and brain

function/development (Cyp4g15) [39]. The proportions
of the new L. cuprina homologs represent only a small
fraction of these 3 detoxification gene families (see
[40-42]). With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, large-scale genome or transcriptome sequencing has become increasingly popular.
For example, transcriptomic analyses using NGS have
now been reported in many non-model insect species
[43-48]. Similar approaches could be extended to L.
cuprina and other related blowfly species, to enable a
more comprehensive assessment of novel insecticide
targets.
Another important application of our newly identified
ESTs was to improve the genetic map of L. cuprina.
ESTs can be converted to a set of anchor loci for linkage mapping, as has been repeatedly shown in other
insects [49,50]. We adopted a conservative “reciprocal
best hit with strong homology” strategy in the selection
of homologous markers, in which D. melanogaster
served as the primary reference. A. gambiae, which
diverged from the Lucilia and Drosophila lineages about
250 MYA, acted as an outgroup to improve the confidence in orthology calling, as sequence homology
needed to reach the E-value of ≤ 1e-50 threshold to be
considered further. In other words, we opted for

Lee et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:406
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/406

confidence rather than sensitivity in our search for
orthologous markers.
The EST-derived markers constituted a substantial
proportion of anchor loci in the present study and were
useful for inferring chromosomal synteny (Figure 5).
Linkage assignment of 41 markers allowed us to conclude that chromosomal synteny is high between the
Lucilia and Drosophila lineages. Our results are typical
for higher dipteran species, as suggested by previous
studies [17,51,52]. Several chromosomal fusion/dissociation events have nonetheless been documented within
the Drosophila genus. For example, the fusion of Chr 4
(Muller’s element F) to an autosome was found in Drosophila willistoni [53]. Moreover, comparison between
mosquito and Drosophila reveals that patches of syntenic regions are scattered across many chromosome
regions [54]. Our mapping results suggested that gene
content on each of the Muller’s elements in L. cuprina
can, to a large extent, be predicted from the D. melanogaster map. However, the obvious cases of synteny violation (Figure 5; Additional file 9) would mean that direct
extrapolation of linkage information from D. melanogaster would require extra caution. The interspecies differences should justify future de novo construction of
linkage maps for L. cuprina, with denser markers.
The 298 putative orthologs effectively form a pipeline
for future comparative mapping efforts (Additional file
8). Their chromosome addresses in D. melanogaster span
virtually all regions of the genome, allowing flexible control over marker density for genomic regions of interest.
Several chromosomal areas in Lucilia are of significant
historical importance: the Scallop/Notch [55,56] on chromosome II and the Rop-1 [12,57] regions on chromosome IV. In fact, several gene markers generated in the
present study have already been utilized to understand
the patterns of selective sweeps around the Rop-1 locus
[58]. The marker pipeline also offers a starting point for
fine scale mapping of the fitness modifier locus (M),
which is believed to counter the fitness disadvantage of
the diazinon-resistant flies in the absence of insecticide
[59-61]. Together with an appropriate genomic library,
these newly acquired ESTs provide an ample supply of
markers for positional cloning of the M locus.
The evolutionary origin and phylogeny relationship
among blowfly species has been of great interest to
many researchers, owing to its medical and forensic
implications [62,63]. With the much expanded gene
repertoire, some of the L. cuprina genes identified here,
especially those that show least similarity to other
known sequences could be utilized to develop species
diagnostic assays. The current EST sequences would
greatly complement such an exploration.

Page 9 of 13

While the assemblage of 29,816 ESTs into 7,464 was
straight forward, the interpretation of the information
contents requires regular re-adjustment, in light of the
constantly expanding sequence databases in other species. In order to evaluate the coding components of the
newly acquired sequences, they were sorted according to
the level of homology to their counterparts in the Genbank reference protein database, producing a typical
BLAST significance spectrum (Figure 1). It is anticipated
that such a spectrum would change over time. As new
sequences from other organisms become publicly accessible, it would simultaneously alter the structure of the
existing sequence databases and hence the BLAST
results. The recently released EST collections (116,737
reads) from 3 closely related taxa (Glossina, Cochliomyia
and, Muscinae) clearly illustrate this notion (Figure 1).
Given that the number of non-redundant sequence clusters depends largely on the assembly settings, the “90%
identity over 50 bases” requirement could be viewed as a
balanced option, but might not be an optimized condition
for all genes. One indication is the presence of residual
sequence redundancy in the dataset, presumably due to
the natural existence of splice variants, transcript isoforms,
natural polymorphisms, or genuine gene families. Hence,
it is worthwhile to disassemble relevant contigs that
belong to the gene of interest and find the most appropriate parameters to reassemble these reads. Furthermore, we
did not impose any restriction on the length of the
sequences, i.e., removal of assembled contigs or reads less
than a certain length (e.g., 200 bases), because such
sequences could be part of the untranslated regions of
many legitimate mRNA transcripts. As more similar EST
sequences from closely related taxa become available,
these short reads might ultimately be informative in the
future. In summary, the TGICL assembly described in this
paper only represents a generic, non-discriminatory clustering approach for the entire dataset, and re-assembling
for the original ESTs might be necessary to produce the
most accurate assembly for a given gene or a set of related
genes.

Conclusions
We report the generation of 29,816 ESTs (7,464 unique
clusters) from the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia
cuprina. Homology analyses revealed that the dataset
captured a wide diversity of genes, including those
related to insecticide resistance targets and detoxification gene families. Our data also indicate that L. cuprina
coding sequences are AT rich and that codon usage patterns are distinct from that of D. melanogaster. In addition, a subset of putative orthologous genes was
identified and mapped to the Lucilia linkage groups,

Lee et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:406
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/406

which revealed a high but incomplete chromosomal synteny with D. melanogaster.

Methods
Construction and sequencing of cDNA libraries

Three cDNA libraries were constructed using RNA
extracted from embryos, first-instar, and third-instar larvae. Construction of the embryonic cDNA library was
previously described in Chen et al. (1998) [55]. Embryonic RNA was extracted from the non-modifier “seeking”
strain using the Gibco-BRL mRNA Isolation System
(Gaithersburg, MD). A unidirectional cDNA library was
constructed in the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the lZAP II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced from the
5’ end using the T3 primer and the 3’ end using the T7
primer. Two larval cDNA libraries (first and third instar)
were made using total RNA from the inbred laboratory
M 1 5 strain. cDNA was prepared using the SMART ®
cDNA library construction kit (Clontech Laboratories,
Inc.), directionally cloned into the aTripIEx2 vector via
the Sfi-I A/Sfi-I B restriction sites, and transformed into
BM25.8 competent cells. Plasmid cDNA clones were
sequenced from the 5’ end using the Sp6 primer. All
sequencing was completed using the Sanger dideoxy
sequencing method at the Australian Genome Research
Facility (AGRF) in Brisbane, Australia. Original EST
reads were subject to standard quality-trimming, vectorremoval, and poly-A-clipping procedures. The output
sequences were then assembled using the TGICL (TIGR
Gene Indices clustering tools) algorithm [64] with the
minimum threshold level set at 90% identity over a
stretch of 50 bases.
Homology comparison

The GenBank non-redundant reference protein database
(8,328,903 sequences) was downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/ in July 2010. The complete
L. sericata mitochondrial genome (GI:154623433) [21] was
also retrieved from Genbank. The 18,648 EST sequences
from C. hominivorax (primary screwworm), 18, 797 EST
sequences (generated by 454 GS FLX; SRA: SRA012250)
from Stomoxys calcitrans (the stable fly), and 79,292 EST
sequences from G. morsitans (tsetse fly) were batch downloaded from GenBank via the species taxonomy page in
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/. The
D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae proteome
sequences were retrieved from FlyBase http://flybase.org/
and VectorBase http://www.vectorbase.org/, respectively.
All sequences were converted into separate local databases
using the NCBI standalone BLAST executables. Homology
searches (BLASTX) were performed with E-value cut-off
at 1e-10. To estimate gene coverage of our Lucilia dataset,
we performed a BLASTX (E-value ≤ 1e-10) search against

Page 10 of 13

the D. melanogaster peptide database (r5.37). Due to the
existence of isoforms in the BLASTX hit list, we extracted
their corresponding gene identifiers (i.e., CG numbers and
gene symbols) from FlyBase to estimate the number of
unique genes. To identify putative orthologs among Lucilia, Drosophila and Anopheles, a more stringent BLAST Evalue threshold (1e-50) was used to retain only the most
conserved homolog pairs. EST sequences that failed to
find a significant match in the reference protein database
were then used to search (BLASTN) against the L. sericata
mitochondrial genome, the C. hominivorax and the
G. morsitans sequences with E-value cutoff at 1e -10 .
Finally, a TBLASTX search (at E-value < 1e-10) was performed for EST sequences that did not find sequence
homology in both the BLASTX and BLASTN searches.
GC content and codon bias analyses

To compare the GC content and codon usage properties
between L. cuprina and D. melanogaster, we confined our
analyses to 200 homologous sequence pairs. These 200
homologous pairs are highly conserved (BLASTX E-value
< 1e-50) at the amino acid level and have identifiable complete open reading frames (ORFs) (see Additional file 3).
Putative ORFs in Lucilia were extracted using the GENSCAN program developed by Burge and Karlin [65]. The
homologous ORFs (or CDS) in D. melanogaster were
retrieved from FlyBase http://flybase.org/static_pages/
downloads/ID.html. GC content and codon usage statistics
were calculated using the GEECEE program http://
emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/geecee.
html. The effective Nc was estimated using the CHIP program http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/5.0/
emboss/apps/chips.html. All 3 programs were available at
BioManager http://biomanager.info/ maintained by Peter
Reeves at the University of Sydney, Australia.
Pedigree construction

The M15 and the Tara strains were used to generate the
male and female informative mapping families. The M15
strain is highly inbred and carries 1 visible phenotypic
marker on each of its 5 autosomes. The Tara strain
(provided by Garry Levot) is a more recent field-derived
strain that originated from Tara, Queensland, Australia.
It is morphologically wild type and displays high levels
of resistance to diflubenzuron and tolerance to cyromazine. To generate the male informative family TMM1,
an F1 male from a single pair mating between an M15
male and a Tara female was backcrossed to a virgin
M15 female (Figure 4).
Choice of markers

cDNA sequences (previously characterized genes and
ESTs) were converted into gene markers for linkage analysis and synteny comparison. Marker selection was

Lee et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:406
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/406

based on (1) their physical locations in D. melanogaster,
to ensure an even coverage of all Muller’s elements; (2)
that these genes contain intron(s) of suitable size (100400 bases); and (3) that the intron positions are conserved in both D. melanogaster and A. gambiae. EPIC
primers were designed using the Primer3 program http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/ (see Additional file 9 for primer information).

assigned to the same linkage group if they shared identical segregation patterns in the male informative cross
TMM1. Twenty-two backcross individuals from TMM1
were used in genotyping assays.

DNA isolation, polymerase chain reactions, and
electrophoresis

DNA from all individuals in the pedigrees was extracted
using DNAzol® reagent (Invitrogen; Cat. No. 10503027).
In subsequent genotyping assays, 0.1% of the whole body
DNA in 1 μL was used per PCR reaction. PCR was done
in 25 μL reactions, which contained 1 μL of genomic
DNA, 2.5 μL of 10 × reaction buffer, 3.0 μL of MgCl2 at
25 mM, 2.5 μL of dNTPs at 2 mM, 1 μL of each of the forward and reverse primer at 10 μL, 0.3 μL of Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas; Cat. No. EP0402), and 13.7 μL of
nuclease-free water. We used a touchdown thermo-cycling
strategy for all PCR amplification, which involved an initial
denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 95°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s (reduce 0.5°C per cycle),
and 72°C for 2 min, followed by another 30 cycles of 95°C
for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min. PCR amplicons
were separated by electrophoresis.
The parents of the mapping crosses were first screened
using EPIC primers for detectable size polymorphisms on
a 1.2% agarose gel, which contained 1% agarose (Bioline;
Cat. No. BIO-41025) and 0.2% Ultra-High Resolution
Agarose (Scientifix; Cat. No. 9030A), at 250 V for 25
min. However, if the agarose electrophoresis did not
reveal intron size polymorphism, the PCR amplicons
were heat denatured (95°C for 3 min) and run on a 6%
polyacrylamide gel (SequaGel®-6 system, National Diagnostics; Cat. No. EC-836 and EC-841) at 500 V for 1.25 h
using the Gel-Scan 2000 system (Corbett Research). The
polyacrylamide gels were stained with 1 × SYBRGold® I
nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen; Cat. No. S-11494) to
look for heteroduplex or single-strand conformation
polymorphisms. If polymorphism was found in the parents of the mapping family, then identical procedures
were applied to genotype the progeny.
Linkage analysis

Due to the general lack of meiotic crossing overs in dipteran males, markers on the same chromosome are
transmitted together from the male parent to its progeny. Under our backcrossing schemes (Figure 4), all
polymorphisms should have come from the Tara strain.
Hence, the presence or absence of the Tara allele in the
male informative family indicates the presence or
absence of a specific Tara chromosome. Markers were
