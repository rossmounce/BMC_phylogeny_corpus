Abstract
Background: G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in many different physiological processes and their
function can be modulated by small molecules which bind in the transmembrane (TM) domain. Because of their
structural and sequence conservation, the TM domains are often used in bioinformatics approaches to first create a
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and subsequently identify ligand binding positions. So far methods have been
developed to predict the common ligand binding residue positions for class A GPCRs.
Results: Here we present 1) ss-TEA, a method to identify specific ligand binding residue positions for any receptor,
predicated on high quality sequence information. 2) The largest MSA of class A non olfactory GPCRs in the public
domain consisting of 13324 sequences covering most of the species homologues of the human set of GPCRs. A set of
ligand binding residue positions extracted from literature of 10 different receptors shows that our method has the best
ligand binding residue prediction for 9 of these 10 receptors compared to another state-of-the-art method.
Conclusions: The combination of the large multi species alignment and the newly introduced residue selection
method ss-TEA can be used to rapidly identify subfamily specific ligand binding residues. This approach can aid
the design of site directed mutagenesis experiments, explain receptor function and improve modelling. The
method is also available online via GPCRDB at http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/.

Background
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as 7
transmembrane receptors, represent a large superfamily
of proteins in the human genome and are responsible for
the transduction of an endogenous signal into an intracellular message, which triggers a response in many different physiological pathways. The structural architecture
and chemo-mechanical concept of G-protein coupled
receptors can be seen as an evolutionarily success as witnessed by the large amount of family members and diversity of applications in biological processes [1].
Not surprisingly, an increasing number of these
GPCRs is the subject of investigation as targets in drug
discovery. Historical drug discovery approaches have
identified GPCRs as a successful drug target, since 25* Correspondence: J.Klomp@cmbi.ru.nl

50% of the drugs currently on the market interact with
a GPCR [1,2].
In humans, the family of 7 transmembrane receptors
is represented by approximately 900 members which
can be divided in several classes based upon standard
similarity searches [3-5].
Recently there has been a reclassification of receptors
according to the GRAFS system which has the following
groups: glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/taste2,
and secretin [6]. From the structural and functional viewpoint the rhodopsin-like family, also known as the class
A receptors, is the largest and best studied family [6].
Receptors from different families are very diverse
[1,5,7], but can all be characterized by the presence of
seven structurally conserved alpha helices, which span
the cell membrane. Most GPCRs couple to a G-protein
complex upon ligand binding, resulting in the dissociation of the alpha subunit from the beta and gamma subunit. The final signal depends on the alpha subunit of

the G-protein (Gai, Gas, Gaq/11, Ga12/13) which is activated and is presumed to be receptor and ligand dependent [8-12]. The non olfactory Class A receptors
recognize a large variety of ligands including photons
[13], biogenic amines [14], nucleotides [15], peptides
[16], proteins [17] and lipid-like substances [18-21].
Most ligands are believed to bind fully or partly within
the transmembrane bundle and to trigger signaling
through a conserved canonical switch [9]. The assumption that similar molecules bind to similar receptors
[22] and that small molecules bind within the upper
part of the transmembrane helices, similar to 11-cis retinal in bovine rhodopsin, carazolol in the human beta
adrenergic receptor 2, timolol in the turkey beta adrenergic receptor 1 and ZM-241385 in the human adenosine A2 receptor, gives rise to the application of pattern
recognition analysis on multiple sequence alignments of
those helices or parts thereof to identify ligand binding
residues. It has also been shown that for some receptors
which bind large proteins, like the luteinizing hormone
receptor (LHR), low molecular weight (LMW) compounds can be designed which bind in between the
TM-bundle and modify signaling [23,24], suggesting
that the same pattern detection techniques could be
used for those receptors as well.
Structure based drug design strategies often rely on high
resolution information derived from protein crystal structures. Elucidating GPCR structures at atomic resolution
remains difficult and has only been successful for a small
set of receptors so far (bovine rhodopsin [25], squid rhodopsin [26], human beta-2-adrenergic receptor [27], turkey beta-1-adrenergic receptor [28] and the human A2A
adenosine receptor [29]). These structures have been
extremely helpful for understanding the function and
ligand binding properties of class A receptors and are a
major step forward towards rational drug design in this
class of receptors. However, understanding the differences
in for example agonist and antagonist binding or extrapolating structural information on a small subset of GPCRs
to evolutionary distant receptors remains problematic and
perhaps may only be solved as more structures become
available [30]. As long as this information is limited there
will be a need for comparative methods to explain the
structural and functional differences between GPCRs.
With the recent genome sequencing efforts, more and
more data becomes available to perform comparative
modelling. Currently, data on 51 species is available in
ensemble [31] (release 56) enabling the large scale comparison of sequences within and across species. Methods
to mine sequence data and identify structurally and
functionally important residues have been developed.
For example, in 1996 Lichtarge introduced the evolutionary trace method to calculate the conservation of a
residue in each trace of a phylogenetic tree [32]. In 2004

Page 2 of 12

Oliveira et al. introduced the entropy variability plot and
showed that the location of the aligned residue positions
in these plots correlate to structural characteristics [33].
Based on a similar concept as the entropy variability
plot Ye et al. introduced the two entropy analysis (TEA)
in 2006 to identify structural and functional positions in
the transmembrane region of class A GPCRs [34].
Here we present subfamily specific two entropy analysis
(ss-TEA), the first method to identify the ligand binding
residues on subfamily level. In contrast to the previously
published methods ss-TEA is able to discriminate
between subfamilies and able to identify the approximately five residues that are involved in ligand binding
for each individual subfamily of the class A GPCRs. ssTEA is predicated on high quality sequence information
deduced from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
which was generated by extracting species homologues of
the class A non olfactory GPCR sequences with a method
reported here. This new MSA is characterized by a more
complete set of species orthologs which improves the
subfamily definition and results of ss-TEA. Receptor specific sets of ligand binding residues, generated by ss-TEA,
improve the understanding of receptor ligand interactions and the design of mutagenesis experiments, and
guide the process of homology modelling.

Results & Discussion
Sequence retrieval & Alignment

Using a template set of 286 human GPCR sequences, a
BLAST search was performed to retrieve non olfactory
class A GPCR sequences. This resulted in 20111
sequences originating from 1941 species. An alignment
of the transmembrane helices was obtained by gap free
alignment of all retrieved sequences using HMM models
of the TM domains. Subsequent removal of sequences
with low HMM scores resulted in a MSA of 13324 class
A GPCR sequences. 33 of the 1941 species contained
over 100 class A non olfactory GPCR sequences and
were deposited in a database and used for further analysis. The resulting multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
comprises 6876 sequences of which 4816 sequences originate from Ensembl and 2060 from Swissprot and
TrEMBL. For all aligned helices in the database, it can
be shown that the overlap with the predicted helices in
Swissprot is over 90% for 90% of the TM sequences and
that almost no helices can be found which have less
than 75% overlap (Additional file 1, Appendix 2). Due
to the gap free alignment procedure of TM domains
only those regions are subject to further analysis, loop
regions will be omitted and anomalies in helix architecture, i.e. proline induced kinks will not be addressed.
From the distance matrix of all 6876 sequences a hierarchical tree was constructed. A visualization of all
human entries of this tree is depicted in Figure 1A. The

number of sequences from all other species, which can
be grouped together with a human entry by collapsing a
node, is indicated behind the receptor name. Phylogenetic analysis between human and mouse indicated that
most human GPCRs have one ortholog in mouse [35].
Since most of the 33 species in our alignment are mammals with an evolutionary distance to human comparable to mouse (Additional file 1, Appendix 3), it is to be
expected that one ortholog from every species can be
grouped together with every human receptor. Exceptions
to expected 1-1 ortholog pairs will be receptors that
have been subject to gene expansion or have become
pseudogenes. Examples include the MAS-related G-protein coupled receptors in which gene expansion has
occurred, and the GNRHR and 5HT5A receptors which
have pseudogenes in human [36]. Figure 1B shows the
distributions of species sequences grouped together in a
node with the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor
(TSHR). Figure 1C displays that in most cases one
sequence per species is grouped together in a node containing only one human sequence, suggesting that these
are orthologs of this human receptor.
Subfamily definition

To identify ligand binding residues we use a score composed of two entropy values. The underlying hypothesis
for this score is that the ligand binding residues are conserved within a subfamily but not across all GPCRs. The
residues which are conserved amongst all GPCRs are
likely to be structurally important and can be easily identified by a low entropy value for all GPCRs. The size and
variability of the subfamily should ensure that apart from
structurally important residues only ligand binding residues are conserved within the subfamily. Phylogenetic
distance is a measure for the sequence conservation in a
subfamily. Figure 2 shows that most of the human receptors in our test set have small phylogenetic distances in
subfamilies with sizes towards ~20 sequences. A subfamily of ~20-60 receptors contains homologous receptors
(Figure 1) with slightly larger phylogenetic distances.
It is impossible to conclude whether or not ligand
binding residues are conserved in a subfamily based on
solely phylogenetic distances. Important aspects to consider in subfamily selection are that the receptors in a
subfamily must bind to relatively similar ligands ensuring evolutionary pressure on the conservation of the
residue positions involved in ligand binding, and that
evolutionary distances are large enough to observe different amino acid usage amongst residue positions
which are not involved in maintaining the structural
architecture of the GPCR, signal transduction or ligand
binding. We have therefore chosen to calculate the
entropy values of all subfamilies with at least 50 and at
most 300 sequences.

Reference set

Site directed mutagenesis experiments offer a tool to
investigate the function of specific residues in receptors.
These experiments have helped to identify residues
related to the signal transduction pathway as well as
residues involved in ligand binding in GPCRs. Extracting
this information from such experiments can however be
very complicated, especially if ligands are compared
which use different signaling pathways or when agonist
are compared to antagonists. Antagonists only have to
block active sites and this can be done via interactions
with arbitrary residues. Agonists have to trigger certain
responses and it is possible that ligands bind to different
residues to trigger different responses. Another important aspect in the interpretation of mutation data is to
separate direct from indirect effects. Mutations on the
membrane facing side of a helix will for example very
likely not affect ligand binding in a direct manner, but
are more likely to have an influence due to distortion of
the secondary structure. We have used site directed
mutagenesis data described in literature, to the best of
our knowledge, to compile a reference set of ligand
binding residues for 10 selected receptors. This reference set consists of 47 residues located at 22 different
positions (Figure 3).
Ligand binding residue prediction

Prediction of ligand binding residues as performed by
for example evolutionary trace, TEA and Multi-RELIEF
is limited to the family level and results in a common
description of the structurally important residues and
ligand binding pocket. Analyses of the charged aspartate
3.32 in the amine receptors and lysine 7.33 in the
opsins, known to be crucial for ligand binding from
crystallography, show remarkable conservation

characteristics. In both cases the residue is fully conserved inside the family and only rarely observed outside. This suggests that ligand binding residues can be
identified by comparing the conservation level of a residue position within a subfamily to the conservation at
this same position for all sequences outside this subfamily. In Figure 4A the two entropy values reflecting both
observations are plotted for the ADRB2 receptor subfamily, which also includes the human receptors ADRB1
and ADRB3. The residues shown to disrupt ligand binding are colored green and are found in the upper left
corner as expected. The distance of each residue to this
upper left corner is used to rank the residues and used
to evaluate the performance of ss-TEA. In Figure 4B the
crystal structure of the ADRB2 receptor, co-crystalized

with carazolol (pdbid: 2RH1) is visualized with the residues disrupting ligand binding colored green. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in Figures 4C
and 4D, plotted with linear and logarithmic x-axis, show
the improved ranking of residues according to ligand
binding likelihood compared to random ranking. The
area under the semi-logarithmic curve (Figure 4D) was
used for further analysis because it puts more emphasis
on correctly predicted ligand binding residues in the
early phase of the recovery curve. It is typically in this
region where performance needs to be outstanding,
since many modeling approaches rely heavily on the
correct assignment of only a limited number of ligand
binding residues.
Table 1 shows that the mean area under the semilogarithmic curve of the theoretically optimal ranking
and ss-TEA are both 1.9. ss-TEA has the highest score
in 7 out of 10 cases compared to the theoretically optimal ranking with the 4 highest scores out of 10 cases. A
more realistic example is given by the comparison with
the multi-RELIEF + 3d contacts method, which was
reported to be the best performing method amongst
several state-of-the-art methods [37]. The average pROC
AUC of multi-RELIEF is 1.32 if the 22 reference residues are top ranked (see Methods section). ss-TEA
gains 0.4 in the pROC AUC compared to multi-Relief in
this situation and 0.5 if all residues are taken into

account. It is also noteworthy that ss-TEA outperforms
multi-Relief for all individual reference receptors except
V1AR.
Three distinct receptors (ADRB2, CCR5 and GNRHR)
which use different residue positions to bind ligands
(see Figure 3) have been selected as an example to illustrate the advantage of the subfamily specific approach of
ss-TEA.
Figure 5 shows in green the residues involved in
ligand binding to the ADRB2 receptor only. Likewise,
the ligand binding residues for CCR5 and GNRHR are
colored blue and red respectively. Residue 7.39 is important for ligand binding in both the ADRB2 and CCR5
receptors and is colored yellow, while position 3.32,
colored maroon is a ligand binding residue for all three
receptors. Figure 5 shows that green residues are mainly
located in the upper left corner of the ADRB2 plot,
while the red and blue residues are positioned more to
the right. Similar distributions are observed for the blue
and red residues in the CCR5 and GNRHR plot respectively, clearly illustrating that the selection of residues
by ss-TEA are subfamily specific.
Analyses of the highest ranked residues for all individual human receptors identify subfamily ligand binding
characteristics. Determination of the top 10 scoring residues for all human receptors visualized in Figure 6 and
colored according to the IUPHAR family definition [36],
shows that there is no generic ligand binding mode for
class A GPCRs since none of the positions is scored
amongst the top 10 for more than 50% of the in total
~300 human receptors. Furthermore it can be seen that
that helix I is rarely important for ligand binding, as also
observed in the available crystal structures. Even so,
some orphan, adenosine and chemokine receptors are
characterized by conservation patterns for residues in
this helix and might bind ligands with residues from this

helix. In addition, the amine receptors can be characterized by the importance of helix three in ligand binding.
However the comparison of individual receptors
within a receptor family also reveals interesting differences in ligand binding behavior. This is illustrated by e.
g. position 3.32, which is well conserved in about 50%
of all subfamilies, including the aminergic receptors and
a subset of the adenosine receptors. For the aminergic
receptors it has been proposed that this aspartate is crucial for ligand binding due to its interaction with the
positively charged nitrogen of the basic amines, a
hypothesis which is confirmed by the crystal structures
of ADRB2 and ADRB1. For other receptors this same
position is thought to be important for ligand binding
involving different amino acids. For example, AA2AR
receptor has a conserved valine at position 3.32. Mutation of this valine to alanine or aspartate disrupts ligand
binding and illustrates the importance of this conserved
valine for this receptor [38]. Position 3.32 ranks at position 45 in the AA1R subfamily, while it ranks at position
11 the AA2AR subfamily suggesting a less important
function for the valine in the AA1R receptor, which is
indeed confirmed by site directed mutagenesis [38].
Interestingly, receptors with endogenous ligands which
completely or largely bind to the N-terminus and/or
extracellular loops also demonstrate subfamily specific
conservation of residues at the extracellular side of the
transmembrane helices. It is remarkable, for example,
that 8 of the top 10 ranked residues for the luteinizing
hormone receptor are in fact pocket residues. Also noteworthy is that Asp2.64, known to interact with the
endogenous ligand [39], is ranked 3rd.

Conclusions
We have introduced an alignment methodology to create a
large multiple sequence alignment of the transmembrane

specific residue selection compared to receptor class specific selection, as well as an improved residue selection for 9
of the 10 reference sets in comparison to the state-of-theart method Multi-Relief. The large MSA including
sequences of multiple species allows us to compare receptors with high sequence similarities and more identical
ligand binding profiles which results in a better understanding of the characteristics of those receptors. If more
sequence data becomes available for more species, larger
alignments can be made, which could possibly even
explain differences between close homologs. Our alignment in combination with the residue selection method
described here can be used to quickly identify ligand binding residues. This can subsequently be used to design site
directed mutagenesis experiments, explain receptor function and improve modelling. The ss-TEA predictions for
class A GPCRs can be accessed via GPCRDB at http://
www.gpcr.org/7tm/.

Methods
Our approach makes use of different input sources
which are connected via algorithms as outlined in Figure
7. All steps will be outlined and discussed in sequential
order below.
Sequence retrieval

The first step in our approach is to extract GPCR
sequences for different species from available data
sources. To obtain sequences we performed a BLAST
[40] search with 286 manually curated query sequences
from human class A non-olfactory GPCRs against Swissprot, Ensembl and TrEMBL. All query sequences were
blasted against Swissprot 57.13 [41,42], Translated
EMBL (TrEMBL) 40.13 [42,43] and Ensembl Protein 56
[31], using the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, an expected
cutoff of 10 and word size 3. Furthermore, a gap opening penalty of 11 and a gap extension penalty of 1 were
used. Finally, we selected all sequences with an e-value
< 0.01, subject length identity > 25%, alignment identity
> 40% and a minimal query length of 20 amino acids.

domains of class A non olfactory GPCRs from multiple
species. We also introduced a new method to identify
ligand binding residues from a MSA, named ss-TEA, and
demonstrated the advantage of this new method in combination with the new MSA for the selection of ligand binding residues. The results show the advantage of receptor

The aim of the Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is
to reflect a structural alignment and therefore the loop
regions and termini of all receptors were omitted, since
these are not structurally conserved. The positions
included in our MSA according to the Ballosteros and
Weinstein numbering scheme [43] are: 1.33-1.56 for
TM1; 2.40-2.65 for TM2; 3.25-3.51 for TM3; 4.43-4.64
for TM4; 5.38-5.63 for TM5; 6.37-6.59 for TM6; and
7.34-7.56 for TM7. The pocket is defined by 28 residues
which are directed towards the intramembrane cavity in
the upper part of the transmembrane domains in the
available crystal structures. The residues defined as

and 7.35, 7.39, 7.43, 7.45 for TM7.
Alignment

The available GPCR crystal structures have shown that
all helices can be structurally aligned without introducing gaps in the sequence alignment. For this reason a
manually curated gap-free alignment of the TM
domains of the human class A non-olfactory GPCR
sequences was created and used to construct a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) for each separate helix, using
HMMbuild (HMMER [44] 2.3.2 (Oct 2003)) with default
settings. Subsequently each hmm model of each helix
was aligned against all extracted sequences from the
previous step, without allowing the introduction of gaps,

using HMMalign (HMMER [44] 2.3.2 (Oct 2003)).
Alignments which had an incorrect helix ordering were
subsequently extracted and subject to realignment on a
smaller part of the sequence. A typical example is the
realignment of one helix on the sequence in between
two correctly aligned neighbor helices (see Figure 8). As
a final filter, all sequences with a low similarity score to
the hmm model for over 4 out of 7 helices were discarded. A threshold of 4 was chosen, since a few annotated human sequences, e.g., the prostanoids, were
shown to have weak patterns for up to 4 helices. The
threshold for the similarity score of each individual helix
was set after the compilation of artificial sequences with
an identical amino acid distribution for each helix as in
the manually curated alignment of human GPCRs.
These artificial sequences were subsequently aligned to
the previously built hmm model of the helix, and the
threshold for the helix was set to the score at which

style. The numbers indicate the number of sequences which is used
at each step.

95% of the artificial sequences fails to pass. Low
sequence quality may cause duplicate entries of the
same receptor and species. To avoid these duplicates, all
but 1 sequence, of all sets of sequences of an individual
species which had less than 10 amino acids difference,
were removed.

Incomplete sequencing of the genomes of many species
causes bias towards certain receptor subfamilies. To
prohibit such bias, all sequences of species with less
than 100 amino acid sequences of GPCRs were removed
from the MSA. All GPCR sequences of species of which
at least 100 different sequences were obtained, were
stored in a database and used in all analysis discussed
below. To enable querying on a higher level than the
individual sequences, a hierarchical tree of the phylogenetic distance matrix calculated from the alignment of
all 7 TMs of all receptors was created, using the neighbor joining algorithm as implemented in clustalW [45]
2.0.11 with a 100 fold bootstrap. The sequences which
group together at a node in this tree, a so called subfamily, can be queried for their properties.
Residue selection

To perform knowledge based residue selections which
reflect the likelihood of residues being involved in ligand
binding, we added two Shannon entropy scores for each
alignment position of each receptor to the database.
One entropy value reflects the conservation of a position
inside the subfamily (E in ) while the other entropy
reflects the conservation of this same position in all
sequences which do not belong to this subfamily (Eout).
The Shannon entropy itself is given by:
Ei = −

20
a=1

(1)

Fia ln Fia

With
Fia = Numberia /m

(2)

Number ia is the number of sequences with residue
type a at alignment position i. Others have already suggested that ligand binding residues can be obtained
from both calculated entropy values [33,34]. Therefore
we introduce one score which combines both calculated
entropies.

Figure 8 Schematic representation of the alignment procedure.
First a HMM model is calculated for each TM domain from a
manually curated alignment of the 7TM domains of 286 human
GPCRs. Each HMM model is subsequently aligned to each GPCR
sequence after which the ordering of the aligned helices is checked.
In case of an incorrect ordering realignment is performed on
smaller parts of the sequence. Finally the significance of each
aligned helix is checked.

A final score for each residue position was calculated
after evaluation of the score at multiple branches of the
hierarchical tree using:
Fi = min Si , cuttree j

for all j ∈ [50, 300]

(4)

where j reflects the number of sequences selected in
the branch. To validate the performance we finally
ranked all residues according to the score with the minimum scoring residue at rank 1.

Reference Set

Benchmark

Site directed mutagenesis data is available for many
GPCRs with different levels of detail depending on the
research question. In this paper ten well studied and
evolutionary diverse Class A GPCRs are used for which
extensive site directed mutagenesis data exists as well as
a binding model based on these data. For each of the
receptors a reference set of residues crucial for ligand
binding was compiled using the mutation data described
in GPCRdb [5] and literature models of the binding
mode. The choice of receptors from different branches
of the sequence tree was made to emphasize the advantage of a method able to identify different ligand binding
residues for different receptors and to show that the
method does not have a bias towards certain subfamilies. The receptors in the reference set are; beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) [27,46]; Prostacyclin receptor
(PI2R) [47]; C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor
(C5AR) [48]; Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) [49,50];
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR)
[51]; Vasopressin V1a receptor (V1AR) [24]; Free fatty
acid receptor1 (FFAR1) [52]; C-C Chemokine receptor
type 5 (CCR5) [53]; P2Y purinoceptor 11 [54] and 13
[55] (P2Y11, P2Y13). Residues that were not part of the
pocket [56] were neglected as well as mutations which
are debatable because of different effects using different
ligands or because results were not consistent in different measurements. The final selection only includes
residues with substantial effect on ligand binding. The
A2A adenosine receptor was deliberately not used as a
reference set in this study, since site directed mutagenesis data and the crystal structure suggest that there is
no general, family conserved receptor binding pocket for
the A2A adenosine receptor [29,38].

To illustrate the advantage of subfamily specific ranking
over generic ranking we compiled a theoretically optimal
generic ranking of ligand binding residues. This ranking
is created by ordering the residues of ten different
receptors according to the number of receptors which
use these positions for ligand binding. The ranking of
positions used by the same number of receptors is arbitrary, potentially altering the results, although it is
expected to have only a minor effect. Because the theoretically compiled optimal ranking includes information
about the location of the pocket we also included this
information in the ss-TEA and Multi-Relief method and
scored the 22 residues included in the theoretically compiled optimal ranking prior to all other residues. The
rankings which include this information will be indicated in this paper as top ranked. As a benchmark we
compared our top ranking to both the theoretically
compiled optimal ranking and Multi-Relief + 3d contacts top ranking [37] (Additional file 1, Appendix 1).
Briefly, Multi-Relief takes a multiple sequence alignment
and predefined subfamily ontology as input, then iteratively selects 2 subfamilies and optimizes a weight vector
able to optimally separate the sequences from both [37].
The optimization of a single weight vector in the iterative process results in one vector able to discrimate
between all provided classes. The weight of a residue in
the Multi-Relief + 3d contacts method can be altered
towards its local environment as obtained from recent
crystal structures.

Performance measure (Area Under the Log Curve)

The performance of our residue ranking method is
assessed using the Area under the semi-logarithmic
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [57]. This
method favors true ligand binding residues early in the
recovery curve and is calculated using:
pROC AUC =

Where n is the number of true ligand binding residues
and bi is the false positive frequency corresponding to
the point at which the ith true residue is found. bi is
typically calculated as the fraction of false positives
which is ranked higher than the ith true positive. The
score of the pROC AUC corresponding to a random
selection is 0.434 and is unbounded on the high side. A
perfect ordering of ligand binding residues amongst 100
non ligand binding residues will for example score 2.0.
