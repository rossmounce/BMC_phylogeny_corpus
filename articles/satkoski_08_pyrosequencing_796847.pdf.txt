Abstract
Background: Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are the primate most used for biomedical
research, but phenotypic differences between Indian-origin and Chinese rhesus macaques have
encouraged genetic methods for identifying genetic differences between these two populations.
The completion of the rhesus genome has led to the identification of many single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in this species. These single nucleotide polymorphisms have many
advantages over the short tandem repeat (STR) loci currently used to assay genetic variation.
However, the number of currently identified polymorphisms is too small for whole genome analysis
or studies of quantitative trait loci. To that end, we tested a combination of methods to identify
large numbers of high-confidence SNPs, and screen those with high minor allele frequencies (MAF).
Results: By testing our previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identified a
subset of high-confidence, high-MAF polymorphisms. Resequencing revealed a large number of
regionally specific SNPs not identified through a single pyrosequencing run. By resequencing a
pooled sample of four individuals, we reliably identified loci with a MAF of at least 12.5%. Finally,
we found that when applied to a larger, geographically variable sample of rhesus, a large proportion
of our loci were variable in both populations, and very few loci were ancestry informative. Despite
this fact, the SNP loci were more effective at discriminating Indian and Chinese rhesus than STR
loci.
Conclusion: Pyrosequencing and pooled resequencing are viable methods for the identification of
high-MAF SNP loci in rhesus macaques. These SNP loci are appropriate for screening both the
inter- and intra-population genetic variation.

Background
Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are used more extensively as animal models for the study of human disease
than any other primate species. They provide the primary

model for research in infectious diseases, reproductive
biology, behavior, neuroscience and immunology. More
recently, they have been employed in research and vaccine
development for the human immunodeficiency virus

(HIV) [1-3]. The severe shortage of rhesus macaques as
subjects for biomedical research prompted the establishment of national centers for breeding them in the US [46]. After their exportation from India ceased in 1978,
China became the principal supplier of rhesus macaques
to these centers and, thus, domestically bred rhesus
macaques represent both countries of origin with only
negligible contributions from rhesus macaques from
other countries [7]. The particular shortage of Indianderived rhesus macaques available for use as subjects in
biomedical research and their desirability over Chinese
rhesus macaques have led to efforts to acquire Indian-like
rhesus macaques from sources outside India, such as
Nepal and Bangladesh [7], and to establish close relationships with the National Center for Primate Breeding and
Research currently under construction in Bombay, India.
Nozawa et al. [8] were the first to characterize genetic polymorphisms in a broad range of Asian species of genus
Macaca, including M. mulatta. They reported differences
in allele frequencies for electrophoretically defined protein polymorphisms among regional populations of the
species. Later, short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms
were identified in rhesus macaques by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cross-amplification with
human primers [9-11]. Variation in the frequencies of
MHC alleles [12-16], mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation, restriction-site polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes
[17,18] and sequence [19,20], and Y-chromosome haplotypes [21] were also characterized.
Since then, specific genetic differences between populations of rhesus macaques from China and India have been
characterized based on electrophoretically defined protein polymorphisms [22,23], STR polymorphisms [2429], major histocompatibility (MHC) alleles [30-32],
mtDNA [17,28,33] and, most recently, single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNPs) [34-37]. Unfortunately, the
number of polymorphisms represented above is far too
small, and their distribution throughout the genome too
broad, to permit whole genome studies of quantitative
trait loci (QTL) and disease association [35].
Until recently, STR loci, numbering in the tens of thousands in most mammalian genomes, have been the preferred polymorphisms for characterizing genetic
variability and estimating parameters useful for genetic
management. STRs serve this purpose because they are
neutral to selection pressure, exhibit multiple alleles
(sometimes dozens), and hence demonstrate high levels
of heterozygosity under equilibrium conditions. They are
also spread throughout the genome making it possible to
use them create a linkage map the rhesus genome [38],
albeit at a density insufficient for whole genome association studies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/256

The recent completion of the rhesus genome map [39],
however, has made the discovery of SNPs much easier
[35-37]. While SNPs are typically biallelic and, therefore,
exhibit fewer alleles and lower expected heterozygosity
(gene diversity) than many STRs, they have the following
advantages over STRs, making them more desirable for
genetic management and for biomedical and/or genomic
research. First, several hundred STRs would be required to
achieve reliable estimates of the phylogenetic relationship
and divergence time between Indian and Chinese rhesus
macaques [40], a process would be both time-consuming
and expensive. In contrast, several thousand SNPs can be
simultaneously assayed through automation, reducing
both the size of the confidence intervals around parameter estimates and cost. Second, SNPs are free of many of
the sources of error (e.g., non-specific amplification,
shadow bands, null alleles) that characterize STR genotypes. Being biallelic, the assignment of SNP alleles is free
from the subjectivity that plagues STR genotyping. Additionally, SNPs can be more reliably genotyped with identical results in different laboratories [41].
Additionally, when carefully selected, SNPs can be
expected to exhibit less homoplasy than STRs, and hence
provide fewer false signals of common ancestry (thus,
SNPs will be more reliable and informative as ancestry
informative markers, or AIMs). Because STRs evolve following a stepwise mutation model and exhibit size constraints on mutation rates and direction, genetic
signatures resulting from genetic bottlenecks (or expansions) are more ambiguous than for SNPs, which follow
an infinite allele model of mutation [42]. Moreover, size
constraints on the evolution of STRs, absent in SNPs, can
lead to serious mis-specification of branch lengths and
topology of phylogenetic trees [43].
STRs have been used successfully to identify linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci, such as CD4 [44] and
G6PD [45]. However, SNPs are more plentiful in the
genome than STRs by a half dozen orders of magnitude
and can be located quite close to a greater number of functional genes, allowing the creation of a high-density map
throughout the genome. SNPs located at various distances
from the target of selection exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium and exhibit values of Fst that systematically
decline with distance from the target of directional selection, a pattern that has been observed in the human Duffy
blood group [46], lactase [47] loci, and loci that influence
human skin pigmentation [48,49].
SNPs with high levels of heterozygosity (e.g., between 0.4
and 0.5) will provide estimates of parameters important
for genetic management (e.g., gene diversity, genetic subdivision and average inbreeding coefficient). The extraordinary quantity of SNPs present in most mammalian

genomes insures that the large number of highly informative SNPs necessary for this purpose can be found.
A large number of SNPs evenly spaced throughout the
genome (the current STR map includes only 241 loci
[38]), could be used in many types of genomic research,
including creating a haplotype map of the rhesus
macaque genome and searching for evidence of selection,
studying the histories/phylogenies of multiple genes
linked to SNPs (SNPsters- [50]), mapping of QTLs or
other important phenotypes [see [51,52], and [53] for
examples using the baboon genome]. In addition, a comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes has
detected genes with unusually high ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, suggesting selection on
genes influencing immune defense and tumor suppression in the human lineage [56]. However, this inference
requires the assumption that the chimpanzee always
expresses the ancestral form of these genes, an assumption
that is not always valid. The availability of a rhesus SNP
map would allow testing of this assumption. Thus, a
detailed knowledge of population structure of rhesus
macaques based on SNPs at various distances and on different chromosomes is crucial to the interpretation of
studies of association between specific loci and disease etiology and susceptibility. The pyrosequencing strategy
could provide these SNPs relatively cheaply and quickly.
We subjected a DNA sample from a Chinese rhesus
macaque to pyrosequencing. After parsing the resulting
pyrofragments, we compared them to the newly completed rhesus genome to identify candidate SNPs. We
selected a sample of these SNPs and conducted the following three tests to evaluate pyrofragment comparison as a
method of SNP detection in the rhesus macaque.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/256

Test 2
Screening for Informative SNPs. Because all SNPs were
detected through the comparison of a pyrofragments from
a single Chinese rhesus to the genome of a single Indian
rhesus, we resequenced a pooled DNA sample of four different, geographically diverse rhesus macaques. By this
method, only SNPs located on at least one of the 4 orthologous chromosomes in the pool would be verified (MAF
of at least 12.5%), suggesting that the heterozygosity
under equilibrium conditions exceeds 0.22. Resequencing
a pooled DNA sample will allow us to screen a large group
of loci for those most likely to be informative in a larger
population of animals.
Test 3
Detecting Geographic Variation. Given the large number
SNPs identified from a single pyrosequencing run
(~23,000), it is necessary to develop a method to test the
efficacy with which they measure genomic variation. The
goal of this test was twofold. First, we sought to not just
identify SNP loci with a MAF of greater than 12.5%, but to
identify markers meeting this criterion that were also
AIMs. Second, we wanted to test the utility of randomly
identified SNP loci for population genetic analysis compared with STR loci. To this end, 96 SNPs fitting the criteria established by the first two tests were chosen for
genotyping by the Illumina GoldenGate Assay System in
a sample of 95 geographically diverse Indian and Chinese
rhesus macaques. These same 95 DNA samples were
amplified at 23 microsatellite loci dispersed throughout
the genome, and the utility of these markers for capturing
the genetic variation present in the populations were compared.

Results
Test 1
Fragment Resequencing. Many of the pyrosequenced fragments overlapped each other, ranging from zero to three
overlaps (fragments with more than three overlaps were
removed from the data set, per [37]). The quality of each
base in the sequence was assessed with the program Phred
[54,55]. Phred score is assigned relative to the probability
of an incorrect base call, with each 10-point increase
equating to a 10-fold decrease in the probability of a miscalled base. (For example, a score of 20 equals 99% base
call accuracy, while a score of 30 indicates 99.9% accuracy.) The Phred scores in these fragments ranged from
one to 33. We resequenced a sample of these pyrofragments in both the original pyrosequenced individual and
several other rhesus macaques, to evaluate the impact of
overlap number and Phred score on the accuracy of our
SNP detection algorithm. The goal of this test was determine an appropriate cutoff for overlap number and Phred
score during SNP locus selection.

SNP Detection
Details of our SNP detection protocol can be found in
[37], and the bioinformatic methods are described in
[57]. Our SNP database can be searched by chromosome,
base pair location, or unique pyrofragment ID at our website, located at http://mamusnp.ucdavis.edu.
Fragment Resequencing
Individual and Primer information are shown in Table 1.
There were no differences between the pyrosequenced
454 fragments and the Sanger re-sequenced CHIW sample
(generated from the same individual), supporting the low
pyrosequencing error rate suggested by the Phred scores,
as shown in Figure 1. The only exception is in fragment
D8YOWMI02H6KYZ, where Sanger sequencing revealed
individual Sch00R1684 to be a heterozygote. A minimum
Phred score of 20 (99% accuracy) was considered an
acceptable error rate for all subsequent tests. To increase
our confidence that identified SNPs were true polymorphisms rather than sequencing errors, a SNP had to have

been identified in a minimum of two pyrofragments to be
considered for further analysis. These sequence comparisons demonstrate, though, that the scores assigned by the
Phred program are accurate, and can be used as a general
guideline to allow future SNP selection without having to
verify the polymorphism through sequencing.
Also shown in Figure 1, the SNPs identified through comparison of the 454 fragment with the NCBI rhesus
genome do not tend to be restricted to a particular
regional sample; indeed, although the NCBI genome was
created from an Indian individual, the Indian rhesus
included in our regional sample always carried the same
allele as the pyrosequenced (Chinese) individual, suggesting that a very low percentage of the identified SNPs qualify as AIMs.

However, a significant result of our test was that the comparison of regional samples revealed a great deal of previously undiscovered sequence polymorphism, indicated
by dark grey boxes in Figure 1. This polymorphism suggests that genomic comparison of individuals from different geographic regions has the potential to quickly
generate many more informative SNP loci. This result suggests that pyrosequencing additional, regionally variable,
individuals has the potential to reveal much more of the
variation present in the rhesus genome.
Screening for Informative SNPs
48 SNPs were selected to screen the pooled DNA sample
(individuals listed in Table 2). At least two SNPs were chosen on each chromosome, one on each arm. Primers were
successfully generated for 43 loci. Of these 43, 60% (N =
26) were confirmed as polymorphic. The remaining 40%

that could not be verified are classified as low-frequency
SNPs, and in fact may have been alleles private to the original pyrosequenced individual. Consistent with the
results of the first test, between one and 13 additional
SNPs were identified in each of the 43 amplicons. All four
individuals, when sequenced individually at three randomly selected loci, produced amplicons for two of the
loci, while only three individuals amplified at a third. The
former loci all exhibited minor allele frequencies of 25%,
which the latter exhibited a minor allele frequency of
33%. Thus the strategy of using a pooled sample is an
effective way to select loci with minor allele frequencies of
at least 12.5%. Of course, use of sample pools representing only 2 or 3 samples should identify SNPs with proportionately higher MAFs.

Detecting Geographic Variation
Of the 95 individuals shown in Table 3, 79 produced viable genotypes for at least 95% of the 96 loci (listed in
Table 4). Ninety-two of the loci submitted for genotyping
produced analyzable data. Fourteen of these loci were
monomorphic in all individuals, suggesting that they
were either extremely low-frequency SNPs, or a mutation
novel to the pyrosequenced animal.

Sixty-five SNPs were variable in Chinese animals, and
sixty-four were variable in Indian animals (one locus did
not amplify in any Indian individuals). Of all the variable
SNPs, 67.9% were polymorphic in both Chinese and
Indian individuals. A very small proportion of the polymorphisms were unique to either population – only
18.5% and 17.2% of markers were ancestry informative in

Page 5 of 12

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:256

Chinese and Indian populations, respectively. Of these
private polymorphisms, the distribution of MAF is shown
in Figure 2. There is no significant difference between the
MAF of the Chinese or Indian samples for each frequency
class (2 sample t-test, p = 1), nor is there a significant relationship between the MAF class and the number of SNPs.
The average heterozygosity in the Chinese sample was
0.25 ± 0.18, while in the Indian sample, it was slightly
higher, at 0.28 ± 0.18. We were not able to detect any significant difference in linkage disequilibrium between the
Chinese and Indian individuals (data not shown).
The results of the STR analysis are shown in Table 5. The
Chinese sample demonstrated unique alleles for each of
the 23 loci, with an average of 4.7 unique alleles per locus.
The Indian sample only demonstrated unique alleles at 7
loci, with an average of 1.6 unique alleles per locus. The
observed heterozygosities of the Chinese and Indian sample were 0.76 ± 0.11 and 0.68 ± 0.14, respectively. The
results of the principal component analysis (PCA) for the
SNP and STR data are shown in Figure 3.

Discussion
The results shown in Figure 2 suggest that the allelic variants discovered through comparison of the Chinese 454
fragments and the Indian NCBI rhesus genome are probably broadly polymorphic in the species, rather than
being confined to a particular region. These results conflict with those reported by Ferguson et al. [36] for SNPs
identified in 3' regions of coding sequences of the rhesus
genome, and by Hernandez et al. [35] for SNPs identified
by sequencing several ENCODE regions. While the SNPs
identified by Ferguson et al. [36] and Hernandez et al.
[35] will be extremely useful as AIMs for differentiating
between rhesus macaques originating in India and China

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/256

and for estimating the level of admixture in hybrid rhesus
macaques with ancestry from both regions, they might be
unsuitable for studies of the structure of the rhesus
macaque genome if they prove to be unrepresentative of
this structure.
Additionally, our comparison of regional samples
revealed a great deal of previously undiscovered sequence
polymorphism, indicated by dark grey boxes in Figure 1.
This polymorphism suggests that genomic comparison of
individuals from different geographic regions has the
potential to quickly generate more informative SNP loci
in the process of verifying SNPs that are discovered in the
future using the methodology we have used. This might
be of particular importance for identifying derived SNPs
in non-rhesus species, such as M. fascicularis.
A single pyrosequencing run cannot discover all the variation present in the rhesus macaque genome. Because a
single run does not produce complete coverage of the
genome. However, as shown in Figure 1, the pyrosequencing of additional regional samples will reveal more of
these region-specific polymorphisms. Thus, we can expect
that many more additional candidate SNPs than the
23,000 we have already identified will be revealed using
this re-sequencing procedure, when both additional animals and regionally variable animals are pyrosequenced.
Moreover, recent advances in 454 technologies have significantly increased the efficiency of the pyrosequencing
reaction, nearly tripling the number of reads per run and
increasing by two and one-half fold (to 250 bp) the size
of each read. Thus, we might be able to detect approximately 60,000 SNPs (two and one-half fold larger than
the number identified in fragments of average size 103
bp) from each additional pyrosequencing experiment.

bVBS,

Recently, researchers have developed a method for discovering SNP loci and estimating MAF in a single run, by
pooling individuals and digesting with HaeIII, selecting
fragments in the 70–200 bp range (creating a reduced representation library, or RRL) and resequencing. This
method has been used to successfully identify large numbers of SNPs in domestic cattle [58] and could easily be
adapted to the rhesus macaque.
Finally, the SNP data presented in this study address many
of the concerns of researchers regarding STR data. The
SNPs in this study were identified from a pool of ~23,000
candidates. As shown in Figure 1, the error rate of the Illumina SNP genotyping process is very low, and PHRED
score appears to be quite useful as a measure of genotype
confidence. This is quite different from STR genotyping,
where genotype reliability is generally a measure of how
many times it can be replicated [59]. Additionally,
because the SNP loci are biallelic, there is no subjectivity
necessary in the assignment of genotypes, nor is there a
need for a "universal" allelic ladder, such as that used for
human forensic STR testing [60-62].
In addition to replicability, SNP genotypes can be collected more quickly than STRs. The SNP data presented in
this paper was collected in a single run, while the comparable STR data required hundreds of separate PCR reactions and at least four "pool-plexed" passes or two
multiplex passes through the sequencer to produce complete, high-confidence genotypes.
However, efficiency and thrift are poor tradeoffs if the
resultant data does not adequately assay inter-and intrapopulation genetic variation. Even with the relatively low
number of either Chinese- or Indian-specific polymor-

phisms, as shown in Figure 3, our loci, when taken together,
provide sufficient phylogenetic signal to discriminate
Indian and Chinese rhesus populations. The separation of
the IND1 and Chinese populations using STR loci alone is
not nearly as complete, although the position of IND2
individuals in the STR-based PCA in Figure 3 could be due
to underlying genetic structure not detected by the SNPs.
This PCA, in combination with the heterozygosity measures from both types of loci, suggest not that the STR loci
currently in use are biased [28], but that that genetic data
collected from SNP loci simply provide a more complete
estimate of the genetic variation in the rhesus genome.
There was at least one SNP on each arm of each chromosome (excluding chromosome 19), while the distribution
of the STRs was not as extensive. Nearly 70% of our SNP
loci were variable in both Chinese and Indian individuals,
making them useful for comparing the breadth of
genomic variation between these populations, something
that cannot be done with AIMs. Within populations, the
average observed heterozygosity of our SNP loci was generally lower than the comparable STR data. However, in
both regional samples, high and low MAF loci were
equally common. If a high MAF is the primary criterion
for inclusion in a SNP-based genetic management panel,
pyrosequencing appears to be an especially useful method
for quickly identifying large numbers of these loci. Postidentification, pooled resequencing as described above
identifies loci with a MAF of at least 12.5% with a high
degree of accuracy (although this percentage depends on
the number of samples included in the pool).

Conclusion
In this study, we sought to expand on the SNP detection
methods presented by Malhi et al. [37], by applying three
tests to the approximately 23,000 previously identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/256

SNPs. First, we replicated several of the pyrosequenced
fragments with varying Phred scores, to both check for
sequencing error and to screen for additional, regionally
specific polymorphisms. From this, we found that the
Phred score was an accurate representation of sequencing
error rate, and set a minimum Phred score of 20, or 99%
base call accuracy, for all subsequent tests. Second, we
used a pooled DNA sample containing four different individuals to resequence 48 SNP loci. By using this technique
to screen for polymorphic loci, and then sequencing animals individually to quantify the allele frequencies, we
were able to screen for loci with MAF of at least 12.5.
Third, we genotyped loci in a larger sample of 95 regionally variable macaques. We found that although a small
percentage of the loci qualified as AIMs for this sample, a
large proportion of loci had MAF in the 40–50% range,
suggesting that our method of SNP identification is
appropriate when the goal is the assessment of withinpopulation genetic variation. Finally, we were able to
demonstrate that the SNP loci were at least as useful as
STRs for screening within-population genetic variation,
and were better at between-population discrimination for
the IND1 and Chinese individuals.

based on its mtDNA haplogroup [e.g., see [33]] and its
genotypes for five ancestry informative STR loci [e.g., see
[27,28]], that this animal has no admixture with eastern
Chinese rhesus macaques in its ancestry. We developed
bioinformatic tools to align these pyrofragments with the
Baylor Genome Center/Washington University Genome
Center's Indian rhesus genome sequence [39,63] and to
output these alignments.

Methods

Fragment Resequencing
Eight of the approximately 23,000 candidate SNPs [37]
were selected for Sanger sequencing, representing SNPs
identified in a varying number of overlapping fragments
(0–3 fragments) and a range of PHRED scores [23-33].
After choosing these loci, 150 bp of flanking sequence was
retrieved from Build 1.1 of the NCBI rhesus macaque
genome. When the 454 fragments contained more than
one SNP (e.g. fragments D8YOWMI02HKQEJ and
D8YOWMI02JEKND), the NCBI sequence length was calculated so that all the SNP loci were represented. These
sequences were entered into the Primer3 web interface
[64] and oligonucleotide primers were designed to
amplify an approximately 200 bp fragment containing the
SNP. The validity of these primers, listed in Table 1, was
tested using the program Amplify 3.1 for Macintosh.

SNP Detection
A DNA sample from a rhesus macaque from Sichuan
Province, China, with the ChiW1 mtDNA haplogroup was
submitted to 454 Life Sciences™ for pyrosequencing. This
sample was chosen because there is a high probability,

Six Macaca mulatta individuals were selected for SNP confirmation. DNA was extracted from EDTA-preserved
blood samples using the QIAmp Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia CA). All of these individuals (and all individuals

included in this study) had previously been sequenced for
835 bp of mtDNA and classified into one of six regional
haplotypes: IND1 (Indian); CHIE (Eastern China);
CHIW1, CHIW2, and CHIW3 (all from Western China);
and CHIS (Southern China) [33]. The CHIW1 sample,
individual Sch00R1684, had also been used to generate
the 454 fragments. The Genbank accession numbers and
geographic origins for these samples are given in Table 2.
For amplification, 2 μl of DNA extract was added to a 25
μl PCR reaction with 67 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.8, 16 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.05 mM each dNTP, 0.2
mM each primer, 1.7 mM MgSO4, and 0.025 U/μl Invitrogen Platinum Taq, (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Thermocycling conditions included an initial hold at 94°C for
three minutes, followed by 60 cycles of fifteen seconds at
94°C, twenty seconds at 62°C, and twenty seconds at
72°C, and a final hold at 72°C for five minutes. The
amplicons were digested with ExoI (0.25 U/μl PCR product) at 37°C for 90 minutes to remove any remaining
primer, heated to 80°C for 20 minutes and filtered with
Montage PCRμ96 plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). They
were then submitted to UC Davis Division of Biological
Sciences, where they were sequenced in both the forward
and reverse directions on an ABI 3730 sequencer using the
Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing version 3.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequenced

products were edited and aligned using the program
Sequencher 4.7 for Macintosh. Consensus sequences were
generated from the aligned products.
Screening for Informative SNPs
Forty-eight SNP loci were chosen from pyrofragments
with a Phred score of greater than 20 and at least one overlapping fragment. These SNPs included at least one arm
on each chromosome (except Y). All DNA extraction,
primer design, sequencing and analysis methods are as
described above. Primers were designed to amplify 400 bp
of flanking sequence around the SNP. The primer information for each locus is listed in Additional File 1:
"Primer Information for Rhesus SNP Resequencing".
DNA samples from four rhesus macaques (listed in Table
2) were extracted and combined to produce a single
"pooled" sample.

For amplification, 8 μl of DNA (100 ng, 25 ng per each
sample) was added to a 25 μl PCR reaction with 1× Platinum® PCR Buffer, 1 U Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase,
0.1 mM each dNTP, 2.0 mM MgSO4, 0.2 μM each primer.
Thermocycling conditions included an initial hold at
94°C for two minutes, followed by 40 cycles of fifteen seconds at 94°C, thirty seconds at 59°C, and forty seconds at
72°C, and a final hold at 72°C for five minutes. The
amplicons were digested with ExoI (0.5 U/μl PCR prod-

uct) and SAP (0.05 U/μl of PCR product) at 37°C for 30
minutes to remove any remaining primer and dNTPs and
heated to 80°C for 15 minutes. They were then submitted
to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne HighThroughput Sequencing Unit of the Keck Center, where
they were sequenced in both the forward and reverse
directions on an ABI 3730XL sequencer, using Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequenced products were
edited and aligned using the program Sequencher 4.7 for
Windows. Consensus sequences were generated from the
aligned products. One 800-bp DNA sequence was produced using this pooled sample, for each of the 48 chosen
SNPs. To more accurately assess the distribution of polymorphism, all four rhesus macaques were also individually sequenced at three of these SNP loci, once they were
confirmed to be polymorphic.
Detecting Geographic Variation
In a third test of our methodology, primers were made to
genotype an additional 96 candidate SNPs. These 96 SNPs
were chosen from the 1,559 SNPs theoretically identified
through pyrofragment comparison, with a minimum
PHRED score of 20 and at least one overlapping fragment.
They were amplified in a sample of 95 rhesus macaques
from both India and China (one individual was duplicated, for a total of 96 DNA samples), representing a
regionally diverse and geographically representative sam-

ple of animals from each country. Information on these
animals can be found in Table 3. Genotyping was conducted at the University of California, Davis Genome
Center DNA Technologies Core using the Illumina GoldenGate Assay system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).
Locale information on these SNP markers is shown in
Table 4. Complete information on the SNP loci used for
detection of geographic variation can be found in Additional File 2: "All Validated SNPs".
The 96 animals submitted for SNP genotyping were also
genotyped at 23 autosomal STR loci. The PCR reactions
used 0.5–1.25 μl of DNA extract in each 12.5 μl PCR reaction [67 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.8), 16 mM(NH4)2SO4,
0.01% Tween-20, 0.05 mM each dNTP, 0.2 μM each
primer, 1.7 mM MgSo4, and 0.025 units/ml Invitrogen
Platinum Taq (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA)]. Each STR
primer pair was optimized for annealing temperature and
extension time: 94°C for 3 min., then 60 cycles of 94°C
for 20 sec., 54–62°C (-0.1°C/cycle), 72°C for 45–90 sec.,
and a final extension at 72°C for 5–60 sec. All samples
were analyzed on an ABI 310 sequencer using the Liz 500
size standard, and the ABI GeneScan software to assign
genotypes. Some of the STR genotypes included in this
study were also included in [[28] and [29]]. Heterozygosity, allele frequencies, and linkage disequalibrium was calculated for the SNP data set using Genepop. Similar values
for the STR data were calculated using GenePop [63]. Prin-
