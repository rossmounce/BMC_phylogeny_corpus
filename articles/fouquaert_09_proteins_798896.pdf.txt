Abstract
Background: Cloning of the Euonymus lectin led to the discovery of a novel domain that also
occurs in some stress-induced plant proteins. The distribution and the diversity of proteins with an
Euonymus lectin (EUL) domain were investigated using detailed analysis of sequences in publicly
accessible genome and transcriptome databases.
Results: Comprehensive in silico analyses indicate that the recently identified Euonymus europaeus
lectin domain represents a conserved structural unit of a novel family of putative carbohydratebinding proteins, which will further be referred to as the Euonymus lectin (EUL) family. The EUL
domain is widespread among plants. Analysis of retrieved sequences revealed that some sequences
consist of a single EUL domain linked to an unrelated N-terminal domain whereas others comprise
two in tandem arrayed EUL domains. A new classification system for these lectins is proposed
based on the overall domain architecture. Evolutionary relationships among the sequences with
EUL domains are discussed.
Conclusion: The identification of the EUL family provides the first evidence for the occurrence in
terrestrial plants of a highly conserved plant specific domain. The widespread distribution of the
EUL domain strikingly contrasts the more limited or even narrow distribution of most other lectin
domains found in plants. The apparent omnipresence of the EUL domain is indicative for a universal
role of this lectin domain in plants. Although there is unambiguous evidence that several EUL
domains possess carbohydrate-binding activity further research is required to corroborate the
carbohydrate-binding properties of different members of the EUL family.

Background
Biochemical and molecular studies amply demonstrated
that plants express a multitude of carbohydrate-binding
proteins (also called lectins or agglutinins) [1,2]. Though

a large number of these lectins have been studied in great
detail at the biochemical, molecular, structural and physiological level, it is still not clear why plants accumulate
proteins with no other obvious activity than reversibly

binding to simple or complex glycans. For a long time
plant lectins were regarded as a group of abundantly
expressed proteins that are located in the vacuolar/extracellular compartment and preferentially bind to nonplant glycans. Accordingly, the concept was developed
that most plant lectins do not interact with endogenous
carbohydrates but function in the interaction with foreign
organisms either in recognition or in defence-related phenomena [3,4]. Lectins that accumulate at (very) high levels in seeds or vegetative storage organs combine a
function as a storage protein with a role in defence against
phytophagous invertebrates or herbivorous animals
[1,2,4].
Though applicable to the majority of all previously studied plant lectins, novel concepts had to be developed after
the identification of several novel hormone or stressresponsive lectins. By virtue of their subcellular location
and specificity this new class of lectins is at least in principle capable of interacting with endogenous receptors in
the cytoplasmic/nuclear compartment of the plant cell
[2,5-7]. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the data
generated by biochemical, molecular biological and plant
physiological studies, and genome/transcriptome/proteome surveys it was proposed recently that plants also
express lectins that mediate specific protein-carbohydrate
interactions in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the plant cell,
and by doing so might play an important role in regulatory processes and/or cell signalling [8,9]. Meanwhile, evidence was reported that the jasmonate-induced tobacco
leaf lectin, which is definitely located in the cytoplasm
and nucleus, can interact in situ with conspecific N-glycosylated nuclear proteins [10]. Even in the absence of further insights into the mode of action, the latter findings
put the physiological role of plant lectins in a new perspective because they indicate that at least some plant
lectins interact - like many animal lectins - with endogenous glycan receptors [11-14]. However, it is still precocious to attribute an essential endogenous role to any of
the currently known cytoplasmic/nuclear plant lectins
until it is demonstrated that orthologs/homologs are
ubiquitous among higher plants. Hitherto, five families of
such inducible nucleocytoplasmic lectins have been identified [9].
Here we report the identification and in silico analysis of
the family of cytoplasmic/nuclear protein(s) comprising
domain(s) equivalent to the recently cloned Euonymus
europaeus agglutinin [15]. The main objective of this
research is to elaborate a comprehensive overview of the
occurrence and evolution of this family of nucleocytoplasmic lectins and develop a unified classification system for
this large and heterogeneous protein family. Our results
show that proteins with (an) EUL (Euonymus lectin)
domain(s) are expressed in all Embryophyta - ranging

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/136

from liverworts to flowering plants - for which a reasonable number of sequences has been deposited, but could
not be found in any other eukaryote or prokaryote hitherto. Despite the EUL domain itself being fairly well conserved, the holoproteins comprising such (a) domain(s)
exhibit a marked structural heterogeneity. Some proteins
consist of a single EUL domain linked to an unrelated Nterminal domain whereas others comprise two in tandem
arrayed EUL domains. Both the N-terminal domain and
the linker sequence are highly variable. Transcriptome/
genome analyses revealed that some species express a single EUL per diploid genome whereas up to eight structurally different proteins are found in others. Furthermore,
expression analyses revealed that EUL domains are
present in many stress response proteins suggesting a role
of this lectin domain in stress signalling. The identification of the EUL family is discussed in view of the increasing importance of glycobiology in plant cell biology in
general, and the understanding of the physiological role
of plant lectins in particular.

Results
The Euonymus lectin domain represents the structural
unit for a novel lectin family ubiquitous in terrestrial plants
(Embryophyta)
A recent reinvestigation using a molecular approach
revealed that the Euonymus europaeus agglutinin (EEA)
cannot be assigned to one of the existing lectin families
[15] but shares a high sequence identity/similarity (46%/
62%) with a domain that was originally identified in two
abscissic acid (ABA) and salt stress responsive rice proteins [16]. Based on the apparent Mr (in a 2-D gel) these
rice proteins were called "OSR40 proteins". Though annotated in protein/gene databases as 'Ricin B related lectin
domain containing proteins' detailed BLASTp, and PHIBLAST and PSI-BLAST revealed that the OSR40 proteins
share no decisive sequence similarity with any protein
comprising a ricin B domain but undoubtedly belong to
the same family as the Euonymus agglutinin [15] (Additional file 1: Figures S1A and S1B). A BLASTp search of the
NCBInr protein database using the sequence of EEA as a
query yielded a set of 120 entries with E-value <1e-05. Due
to redundant annotations the number of (putative) proteins is considerably lower (approximately 50). Of all
these entries only EEA has been purified and characterized. For a few others (like the rice OSR40 proteins) there
is experimental evidence based on protein analysis techniques that they are actually expressed. All other hits
detected by BLASTp searches refer to hypothetical proteins
the sequence of which is deduced from either cDNA or
genomic sequences. At present there is no uniform naming for all these putative proteins. Most of them are still
annotated as "putative/hypothetical protein", "expressed"
protein, "unknown" protein or "stress-responsive" protein.

Several experimental data unambiguously demonstrate
that the EUL domain represents a new carbohydrate-binding domain. First, glycan array binding studies showed
that EEA has high affinity towards blood group B oligosaccharides, but also binds to high mannose N-glycans [15].
Second, Edman degradation of a previously characterized
lectin from tulip (Tulipa gesneriana) bulbs (called TxLMI)
[17] that until now could not be classified in one of the
known plant lectin families revealed that the N-terminus
of the 19 kDa subunits shares >66% sequence identity
with EUL proteins from other monocots (Additional file
1: Figure S1C). Additional sequences of tryptic peptides
confirmed that TxLMI comprises a typical EUL domain
(Additional file 1: Figure S1C). Third, preliminary experiments revealed that the EUL homolog from Arabidopsis
thaliana (At2 g39050) expressed in Pichia pastoris agglutinates rabbit erythrocytes (J. Van Hove and E. Van Damme,
unpublished data) and hence must be capable of interacting with carbohydrate structures present in the erythrocyte
membrane. The obvious carbohydrate-binding activity of
three different EUL proteins from taxonomically unrelated species strongly indicates that several EUL domains
can be considered lectin domains. It should be emphasized, however, that sequence similarity to the Euonymus
lectin does not necessarily imply that a given domain possesses carbohydrate-binding activity.
Transcriptome analyses showed that virtually all Embryophyta species for which a reasonable number of sequences
were deposited express one or more proteins with a
domain similar to the EEA polypeptide (see below).
Therefore, it appears that the Euonymus lectin domain represents the structural unit for a novel lectin family ubiquitous in terrestrial plants (Embryophyta). Since neither the
rice OSR40 proteins nor the putative homologs found in
other plants can be classified under the ricin B family, a
more appropriate nomenclature should be introduced.
Taking into account that the Euonymus agglutinin was the
first identified member and, in addition, possesses a welldefined biological activity (in casu carbohydrate-binding),
it seems logical to name this novel protein family after the
Euonymus agglutinin and consider the Euonymus lectin
domain as the diagnostic structural unit. Accordingly, the
term 'Euonymus lectin domain' (or 'EUL domain') will be
adopted for all structural units equivalent to the Euonymus
lectin subunit, and the term 'EUL family' will be used to
refer to the group of proteins containing at least one EUL
domain.
To the best of our knowledge the acronym EUL is not used
yet for any protein family or conserved protein domain,
and hence can be introduced without the risk of confusion. The terms 'EUL' and 'EUL family' are preferred to
'OSR40' and 'OSR40 proteins' for two reasons. First, the
name 'OSR40' includes no information about the biolog-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/136

ical activity of the domain. Second, the term 'OSR40' does
not refer to a well-defined structural unit but to a 40 kDa
ABA/salt stress responsive rice protein with a complex
structure (encompassing two homologous domains of
approximately 150 AA residues separated by a linker
sequence plus an extra N-terminal domain). Hence, the
term 'OSR40' is inappropriate to refer to all related proteins that include only a single 150 AA domain and differ
in molecular mass.
Domain architecture and nomenclature
Comprehensive sequence analyses demonstrated marked
differences in the overall structure of proteins with EUL
domain(s). Based on the sequence information available
at present, seven types of proteins containing a single EUL
domain and five types of proteins with two EUL domains
can be distinguished (Figure 1). Table 1 summarizes the
different types of EULs and examples of plants in which
such proteins can be found. Basically, the EUL family can
be subdivided into single- and two-domain proteins.
Some single-domain proteins consist - like the Euonymus
lectin - exclusively of a sole EUL domain. However, in
most cases the EUL domain is preceded by an unrelated
N-terminal domain varying in length and composition/
sequence. In a minority of the single-domain EULs a signal peptide was detected at the N-terminus, indicating
that some vacuolar EULs presumably also exist. In addition to an N-terminal domain, an extra domain at the Cterminus which can also differ in length is found in a few
single-domain EULs. Most but not all two-domain proteins contain an extra N-terminal sequence and a linker
between the two EUL domains. Despite differences in the
length of the N-terminal sequences as well as the linkers,
the subfamily of two-domain EULs is less heterogeneous
than that of the single-domain proteins.

The obvious differences in domain architecture between
different members of the EUL family combined with the
simultaneous occurrence of multiple structurally different
EULs in some species necessitate a consistent nomenclature. Therefore, a classification system was elaborated
based on the overall domain architecture and the length/
sequence peculiarities of the accessory domains. Individual proteins containing an EUL domain are indicated by a
species code, composed of the three first characters of the
genus name and the first two characters of the species
name, followed by one of the 12 domain architecture
codes (Table 1). If in one species different forms of a given
type occur, different subtypes and isoforms are then indicated by additional characters.
Occurrence of plant proteins containing one or more EUL
domains in sequenced genomes
Initial screening of the plant databases unveiled two
important aspects of the EUL family. First, this family

comprises proteins with a markedly different overall structure. Second, different species express different sets of
EULs. To unravel the complex set of data a comprehensive
analysis was made of the EUL proteins/genes found in
plants for which (nearly) complete genome sequences are
available (Figure 2).

proline-rich glycoprotein family' and contains a 'QXW
lectin repeat domain' (Pfam: PF00652 = Ricin-type betatrefoil lectin domain), whereas in the MIPS database the
protein is annotated as 'similar to stress responsive lectinlike cDNAs from rice'. However, it is evident now that the
C-terminal part of this Arabidopsis protein corresponds to
an EUL domain and accordingly should be classified in
the EUL family. The 154 AA EUL domain in this Arabidopsis protein shows 44% sequence identity and 71%
sequence similarity to the EUL domain of EEA. In addition, this protein contains a long (approximately 160 residues) unrelated N-terminal domain that shares no
significant similarity with any other known domain. Due
to the presence of this long N-terminal domain the Arabidopsis EUL is classified as a type S3 EUL (ArathEULS3).

Single orthologs of the ArathEULS3 gene were also identified in the completely sequenced genomes of Medicago
truncatula (barrel clover), Vitis vinifera (common grape
vine), Ricinus communis (castor bean) and Carica papaya
(papaya). The corresponding proteins are expressed and
have the same domain architecture as ArathEULS3 (Figure

Two orthologs of the Arabidopsis EUL were identified in

identical EUL domains but differ by four deletions/insertions in their respective N-terminal domains. Since all
identified ESTs (>20) apparently correspond to
PoptrEULS3A there is some uncertainty about the expression of PoptrEULS3B.
Glycine max: dicot genome with three paralogous EUL genes
The genome of soybean comprises two genuine orthologs
of
the
Arabidopsis
EUL
(GlymaEULS3A
and
GlymaEULS3B) that are located at different loci and
according to transcriptome data are expressed. In addition, a third gene (GlymaEULS3C) tandemly arrayed to
GlymaEULS3B could be identified that encodes an EUL
protein with a shorter N-terminal domain (Figure 2). No
corresponding ESTs or cDNAs could be retrieved in Glycine max (or any other legume). The occurrence of
GlymaEULS3A and GlymaEULS3B can be explained by
the fact that soybean is a "diploidized tetraploid", whereas
GlymaEULS3C most probably results from an in tandem
duplication. At present, no similar in tandem arrayed pair
of EUL genes was identified in any other dicot. However,
as described below, in tandem duplication made an
important contribution to the evolution of EUL genes in
grasses (and perhaps in other monocots as well).
Oryza sativa: monocot genome with a set of 5 expressed EUL
proteins
In 1995, Moons et al. [18] identified a 40 kDa histidinerich ABA-responsive protein (called OSR40c1) in rice
roots. Sequencing of genomic fragments combined with
Western blotting experiments using antisera raised against
a conserved OSR40 peptide further proved that at least
two other OSR40 proteins accumulated in roots of rice
seedlings upon exposure to salt stress, namely OSR40 g2
and OSR40 g3 [16]. Therefore, it was concluded that the
OSR40 proteins, which are now classified as EULs, belong
to a multigene family.

BLAST searches against the completed rice genome confirmed the occurrence of an EUL gene family. Nine genes
could be identified that encode proteins comprising one
or two EUL domains. Expression was detected for only
five of these genes (Figure 2) suggesting that four genes
might be pseudogenes. The corresponding five proteins
represent four different types of EULs: (i) a single-domain
protein with a medium long unrelated N-terminal
sequence (OrysaEULS2 = OSR40 g3), (ii) a single-domain
EUL protein with a long unrelated N-terminal sequence
(OrysaEULS3 = r40c1), (iii) two two-domain proteins
with a short linker (OrysaEULD1A = OSR40 g2, and
OrysaEULD1B = OSR40c1), and (iv) one two-domain
protein with a long linker (OrysaEULD2 = OSR40c2).
Based on its overall domain structure OrysaEULS3 can be
considered a genuine ortholog of the Arabidopsis-type

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/136

EUL(s) (Additional file 1: Figure S2). The nine rice
(pseudo)genes with EUL domains are located at four loci
on four different chromosomes: OrysaEULS3 on chromosome 1; OrysaEULS2, OrysaEULD1A and OrysaEULD2 as a
cluster on chromosome 7; OrysaEULD1B, clustered with
the two non-expressed (pseudo)genes OrysaEULS0A and
OrysaEULD0, on chromosome 3; the two non-expressed
(pseudo)genes OrysaEULS0B and OrysaEULS0C as a cluster on chromosome 12.
Because no trace of type S0 EUL expression could be
detected in O. sativa, it is suggested that the OrysaEULS0B
and OrysaEULS0C genes might be pseudogenes in O.
sativa. Nonetheless this conclusion cannot be extrapolated
to all Oryza species. A cDNA sequence encoding an S0
type EUL was deposited, indeed, for O. punctata. Interestingly, a virtually identical nucleotide sequence can be
assembled from the O. sativa genomic sequence by joining the first exon of Os12 g08340 and the second exon of
Os12 g08310. A closer examination shows that the
genomic sequences covering Os12 g08340 and Os12
g08310 contain the coding sequence of an S0 type EUL
protein (as expressed in O. punctata) in which the exons
encoding the N- and C-terminal part are interrupted by a
very long intron (20,736 nucleotides) that apparently
comprises a transposon. This might indicate that the O.
sativa gene encoding a S0 type EUL protein was - in evolutionary terms - recently inactivated through the insertion
of a transposon.
Sorghum bicolor: monocot genome with a complex set of
'cytoplasmic' and 'vacuolar' EUL proteins
BLAST searches in the genome and transcriptome databases indicated that Sorghum bicolor expresses closely
related orthologs of all five EUL proteins expressed in O.
sativa (i.e. SorbiEULS2, SorbiEULS3, SorbiEULD1A,
SorbiEULD1B and SorbiEULD2) (Figure 2). In addition
the S. bicolor genome contains also (expressed) EUL genes
that are not found in the rice genome. First, there is a third
two-domain protein (SorbiEULD1C) for which no
ortholog could be identified in rice. Second, the genome
apparently contains four genes (SorbiSv1-4) encoding single domain EUL proteins that are synthesized with a signal peptide. Though the exact subcellular location of these
proteins is not known, it seems evident that they are synthesized in the ER and follow the secretory pathway. To
distinguish them from the 'cytoplasmic' EUL they are
referred to as 'vacuolar' EULs. For both SorbiSv1 and
SorbiSv2 corresponding ESTs could be retrieved indicating
that these genes are expressed.
Zea mays: monocot genome with a complex set of 'cytoplasmic' and
'vacuolar' EUL proteins
Analyses of genome and transcriptome databases confirmed that Z. mays expresses orthologs of all five rice EUL

proteins (referred to as ZeamaEULS2, ZeamaEULS3,
ZeamaEULD1A, ZeamaEULD1B and ZeamaEULD2) (Figure 2). In addition, maize expresses two very similar single-domain EUL proteins lacking an N-terminal domain
(ZeamaEULS0a and ZeamaEULS0b) as well as a presumed vacuolar single-domain EUL protein (ZeamaSv).
Corresponding genomic sequences are available for
ZeamaEULS0a but not yet for ZeamaEULS0b and ZeamaEULSv.
Physcomitrella patens: a moss genome with a set of 3 singledomain and 1 two-domain EUL genes
From the P. patens databases it could be derived that this
moss genome contains three genes encoding singledomain EULs (PhypaEULS1, PhypaEULS3A, and
PhypaEULS3B) and a single gene encoding a two-domain
EUL protein (PhypaEULD1) (Figure 2). Perfectly matching
EST sequences were deposited for PhypaEULS3A,
PhypaEULS3B, and PhypaEULD1 but not for PhypaEULS1,
casting doubt on whether PhypaEULS1 is expressed.
Selaginella moellendorffii: a spike moss genome with a set of 5
single-domain and 3 two-domain EUL genes
Detailed analysis of genome and transcriptome databases
of Selaginella moellendorffii (belonging to the Lycopodiophyta, the oldest vascular plant division) resulted in the
identification of a complex set of at least 34 genes encoding EULs of eight different types: four different singledomain cytoplasmic types (SelmoEULS0, SelmoEULS1,
SelmoEULS3, and SelmoEULS4), one single-domain vacuolar type (SelmoEULSv), and three two-domain types
(SelmoEULD0, SelmoEULD3, and SelmoEULD4) (Figure
2). For each EUL a nearly identical paralog exists (e.g.
SelmoS1Aa and SelmoS1Ab). It is worth mentioning that
4 of these eight types (namely SelmoEULS4,
SelmoEULD0, SelmoEULD3, and SelmoEULD4) have not
been found in any other plant species.

S4-type EULs resemble the S2- and S3-type proteins found
in monocots and dicots but distinguish themselves by the
presence of an extra 34 AA residue C-terminal domain.
Moreover, the latter is located on a separate exon. Besides
these "unique" S4-type genes the S. moellendorffii genome
contains three "novel" types of two-domain genes. Two
genes (SelmoD0a-b) encode two-domain proteins without
N-terminal domain and two other (SelmoD3a-b) twodomain EULs with a long N-terminal domain. Finally, the
Selaginella genome contains at least 6 pairs of genes
(SelmoD4A-Fa-b) encoding SelmoEULD4 proteins.
SelmoEULD4 proteins are like SelmoEULD0 two-domain
EULs without N-terminal domain. However, they are only
distantly related to other two-domain EULs. ESTs have
been identified for all types of proteins (though not for all
individual genes) except for SelmoEULS0, SelmoEULS1C,
and for the vacuolar proteins.

Additional data from transcriptome analyses
To further corroborate the presence and composition of
the EUL gene complement in other plant species, a thorough analysis was performed of available transcriptome
data (Figure 3). A detailed discussion on the EUL
sequences found in all major taxonomic groups is given in
Additional file 2.

Interestingly, two single-domain EULs that have not been
identified in any other plant species have been retrieved
from the transcriptome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Both proteins comprise a short N-terminal
domain followed by an EUL domain and a short to
medium long C-terminal domain (Figure 3). EST encoding proteins with an EUL domain were also deposited for
ferns (Ceratopteris richardii and Adiantum capillus-veneris)
and cycads (Cycas rumphii and 3 Zamia species). Conifers
such as Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) also express a complex
set of EUL proteins comprising S2, S3, D1 and D2-type
proteins. Although the complement of EUL proteins
expressed in Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) resembles that
in P. taeda it is certainly not identical (Figure 3).
Within flowering plants some ESTs encoding EUL proteins are found in basal Magnoliophyta (e.g. Amborella trichopoda) and Magnoliids (e.g. Liriodendron tulipifera).
Within Eudicotyledons EUL sequences are present in stem
eudicotyledons, (e.g. Aquilegia formosa × Aquilegia pubescens) as well as in virtually all EST databases from core
eudicotyledons. Most species express a single S3-type protein per diploid genome but several species (e.g. Lactuca
sp., Helianthus sp., Antirrhinum majus) express complex
mixtures of S3-type EUL proteins.
A search for EUL domains in Liliopsida (monocotyledons) revealed that all EST databases from monocots contain sequences encoding EUL domains. The whole of
retrieved sequences indicates that most if not all of these
monocots express a set of single-domain and two-domain
proteins comparable to that found in O. sativa.
In silico expression analysis of the EUL from Arabidopsis
Several cDNA and EST sequences have been identified
that confirm the expression of the EUL homolog
ArathEULS3 (At2 g39050) in Arabidopsis. Therefore the
expression profile of this EUL homolog was studied using
the Arabidopsis electronic fluorescent protein browser
[19].

The expression of ArathEULS3 is developmentally regulated with a high expression in senescent leaves and in
flowers from the 15th flower stage. The highest absolute
fluorescence value in untreated plants (955) was observed
in the sepals of flowers but cauline leaves also clearly
show expression of ArathEULS3. Microarray expression

analyses of leaf mesophyl cells and guard cells [20]
revealed that ArathEULS3 is weakly expressed in the mesophyl cells of 5 week-old leaves (absolute value of 98.78),
but is highly expressed in the guard cells (absolute value
of 723.92). This expression in guard cells was increased
more then 2-fold in leaves floated on 100 μM ABA (absolute value of 1633).
The relative expression (defined as the ratio between the
absolute fluorescence values measured for a given tissue
with and without treatment) of ArathEULS3 was studied
for different abiotic as well as biotic stresses (Additional
file 1: Figure S3). ArathEULS3 is upregulated 11-fold in
shoots of 18 day-old plants floated on liquid Murashige
and Skoog medium supplemented with 300 mM mannitol for 12 h. Similarly salt stress (150 mM NaCl) and
drought stress cause an 8-fold and 2.5-fold upregulation,
respectively, of ArathEULS3 expression after 24 h salt
treatment and 3 h drought treatment (Additional file 1:
Figure S3A). Other abiotic stress treatments such as oxidative stress, wounding, heat and UV treatment, and application
of
chemicals
such
as
cycloheximide,
brassinosteroid inhibitors, auxin inhibitors and gibberellic acid inhibitors do not affect the expression of
ArathEULS3. In contrast, a treatment of seedlings with the
plant hormone ABA resulted in a 7-fold upregulation of
the gene, already after 3 h treatment. Similarly a treatment
with methyl jasmonate resulted in a 2.5-fold upregulation
of ArathEULS3 after 3 h treatment (Additional file 1: Figure S3B).
Next to abiotic stresses, ArathEULS3 gene expression was
also upregulated by biotic agents such as infection with
the fungus Botrytis cinerea and the bacteria Pseudomonas
syringae pv tomato DC3000 and Pseudomonas syringae pv
tomato avrRpm1 (Additional file 1: Figures S3C and
S3D). In contrast, inoculation of leaves with Phythophtora
infestans and Erysiphe orontii did not alter the expression
level of ArathEULS3.

Discussion
In silico analyses revealed that the recently cloned Euonymus europaeus lectin represents a conserved domain that is
apparently widely distributed in plants and hence can be
considered the prototype of what can be called the Euonymus europaeus lectin or EUL protein family [15]. Detailed
analysis of sequences in publicly accessible databases enabled to study the distribution and the homogeneity/diversity of proteins with an EUL domain. Screening of genome
and transcriptome databases indicated that proteins with
EUL domains are widespread in Embryophyta (terrestrial
plants). EUL sequences were found in all taxa of flowering
plants (including basal Magnoliophyta, Eudicotyledons,
Liliopsida, Magnoliids), in all other taxa of Spermatophyta (Coniferophyta, Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gne-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/136

tophyta), and also in Filicophyta (ferns), Lycopodiophyta
(e.g. Selaginella sp.) as well as Bryophyta (mosses) and
Marchantiophyta (liverworts). Comprehensive BLAST
searches of the completed genomes (and annex transcriptome) of Chlamydomonas reinhardii, Chlorella sp., Micromonas pulsilla, Ostreococcus sp., and Volvox carteri yielded no
significant hit, suggesting that the EUL domain is absent
from these Chlorophyta. Thus, it seems likely that the EUL
domain was developed/acquired after the separation of
the Chlorophyta and Embryophyta lineages (approximately 500 million years ago).
At present there is no evidence for the occurrence of proteins with EUL domain(s) in other eukaryotes (including
green algae) or prokaryotes. Hence, one can reasonably
conclude that the EUL domain is confined to the Embryophyta. It should be noted here that a few ESTs with typical EUL sequence were also found in the transcriptome of
Aedes aegypti (an insect) whole larvae, Wuchereria bancrofti
(a nematode) larvae, and Xenopus laevis whole embryos
(for a complete list see Additional file 3: Table S1). However, all evidence suggests that these sequences represent
contaminants arising from plant material in the respective
organisms. First, all non-plant sequences are virtually
identical at the nucleotide level to sequences found in
Poaceae species (as is illustrated by an alignment of the
sequence found in Aedes aegypti and an EST from the grass
Agrostis stolonifera (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Second,
the genomes of Aedes aegypti and Xenopus laevis contain no
sequences that match the ESTs. Third, all non plant
sequences were found in EST libraries made from complete organisms and hence can readily be contaminated
with foreign cDNAs. Fourth, the apparent absence of
genes encoding EUL domains from all sequenced eukaryotes other than plants is difficult to reconcile with the
expression of EUL proteins in three different animal species (unless one assumes that Aedes aegypti, Xenopus laevis
and Wuchereria bancrofti acquired in a very recent past an
EUL gene from a grass species by lateral transfer). The best
guess is that the larvae used for the construction of the
respective EST libraries were (indeliberately) contaminated by wind carried grass pollen grains that upon RNA
extraction contributed to the EST library. Accordingly, all
evidence suggests that the EUL domain was developed in
plants rather than acquired by either vertical or horizontal
inheritance from a prokaryotic ancestor. However, it can
not be precluded that other yet unidentified organisms
have developed in parallel the same protein domain.
A comparative analysis of the genomic and cDNA
sequences revealed that most EUL sequences contain
introns (Figures 4 and 5). For instance, ArathEULS3 contains three introns, one of which is located within the stop
codon. The first exon comprises the N-terminal domain
plus approximately the first 40 residues of the EUL

domain whereas the rest of the EUL domain is divided
over the second and third exon. A very similar exon/intron
structure was also found in the genes expressing other
EULS3 proteins though the length of the second intron
can be much longer, as is the case in PoptrEULS3A and
PoptrEULS3B where the second intron contains 1,397 and
3,480 nucleotides, respectively. We conclude that the
position of the first and second intron in the EUL domain
is conserved in all EULS3 genes of dicots. The third (firstorder) intron is invariably located in the stop codon (Figure 4).
The EULS3 genes from monocots such as O. sativa and S.
bicolor and from lower plants such as S. moellendorfii have
exactly the same intron/exon structure as the S3-type EUL
genes from dicot plant species. The ZeamaEULS3 gene
also contains introns at the same positions as in the S3type genes of dicots, but contains an additional intron
sequence in the N-terminal domain. This is also the case
for both S3-type genes of P. patens which contain three
introns in their coding sequence and one additional

intron within the stop codon. The second and third intron
are located at the same position as the two introns in other
S3-type genes whereas the first intron is positioned in the
long N-terminal domain. An intron positioned in the Nterminal domain was also found in the S0-type gene of S.
moellendorfii. No introns were detected in the SorbiEULS2
gene, while its rice ortholog contains one intron in the
EUL domain (Figure 4).
Some two-domain proteins (OrysaEULD1A, OrysaEULD2
and SorbiEULD2) have an intron/exon structure reminiscent to that of the EULS3 gene (four introns in the open
reading frame and one in the stop codon). However in
most
proteins
(OrysaEULD1B,
SorbiEULD1A-C,
ZeamaEULD1A-B, ZeamaEULD2) some of these introns
are apparently missing. Interestingly, all introns in the
open reading frame are positioned within an EUL
domain, and all expressed EUL genes contain a nearly
identical exon sequence corresponding to the C-terminal
part (comprising 76 or 77 amino acid residues) of the
respective proteins. In the two-domain proteins of the

lower plants S. moellendorfii and P. patens introns occur
also in the N-terminal domain and/or between the linker
and an EUL domain (Figure 5).
The genes encoding the vacuolar SorbiEULs have one or
two introns, positioned in the EUL domain. No introns
could be found in the genes encoding the presumed vacuolar EUL forms of S. moellendorfii (Figure 4).
Though only 12 (nearly) completed genomes have been
screened, several important conclusions can be drawn
with respect to the composition of EUL genes/proteins in
plants. First, the genomes of dicots contain only one or
two genes (or three as in the case of Glycine max) encoding
a single-domain S3 type EUL. Second, the genome of
monocots comprises a complex family of genes which
encode proteins with either one or two in tandem arrayed
EUL domains. Only one of these genes is a genuine
ortholog of the single-domain S3-type EUL genes in
dicots. The single domain S3-type EULs are present in
dicots, monocots and mosses, and are markedly conserved among these divergent classes. Moreover, they are
encoded by genes with a strictly conserved intron/exon
structure. Therefore the S3-type EUL can be considered a
universal EUL. Third, (some) lower plants such as Selaginella have a more complex set of EULs. Furthermore, the
spikemoss Selaginella and the liverwort Marchantia express
some EUL types that could not be identified in higher
plants, such as EULs with an additional C-terminal
domain. From these observations it is hypothesized that
the EULs of seed plants evolved from the EULs of lower
plants. Additionally, in some EUL genes of lower plants
introns are positioned in the N-terminal domain or in the
linker, which is in strong contrast to genes encoding EULs

from higher plants. Nonetheless, most genes encoding
EULs do typically have an intron sequence in their stop
codon. Next to cytoplasmic EULs which occur in all investigated plant species, vacuolar EULs were detected only in
some monocots and in Selaginella.
In an attempt to unravel the evolutionary relationships
among sequences with EUL domains phylogenetic analyses have been performed. From the alignment of the
sequences of EUL domains from different plant species it
can be deduced that certain amino acids
(Q37XW38XXD41XXXS46, L60XN62K63, H71, L81, D90, W95,
D100, G102, R109, W141, N146Q147XW149) in this EUL
domain are highly conserved (Additional file 1: Figure
S2). The phylogenetic tree (Figure 6) clearly shows several
clusters and some striking symmetries. Strikingly, all
monocot sequences are grouped in one large cluster
except for EULS0 cytoplasmic forms and the vacuolar
forms retrieved from a few monocots. From the tree, a
number of conclusions can be drawn with regard to the
origin and evolution of the EUL domain and proteins possessing one or more EUL domains.
An outgroup for rooting the tree was designated based on
the following intuitive criteria: (1) the EUL domain arose
only once in the course of plant evolution, whereupon it
could expand either by fusion with other segments or by
gene duplication resulting in more complex EUL proteins;
(2) the taxonomically most ancestral operational taxonomic units should make up the root of the tree. On these
grounds SelmoEULS0, which is the oldest and simplest
EUL, indeed, could be the sole outgroup member, but
upon rooting with this single operational taxonomic unit
it immediately became clear that the next most simple

EULs (types S1 and Sv) of this species could likewise be
assigned to the root partition (marked A) of the tree.

in partition B, which basically displays the same patterns
as partition C but to a lesser extent.

The phylogenetic phenomena thus apparent from the tree
generally repeat themselves for every major taxonomic
division descending sequentially from a common EUL
ancestor arisen within a member of the Lycopodiophyta
(Selaginella in this case), which are the most primitive vascular plants. Splitting off from the root of the tree there are
two derived sister clusters: a smaller one (Figure 6, partition B) with lower plants and gymnosperms only, and a
large one (Figure 6, partition C) with the latter plus the
flowering plants (dicots and monocots). The occurrence
of EUL proteins from the most primitive organisms in all
major partitions of the tree, and from gymnosperms (in
evolutionary terms intermediary between lower and flowering plants) in every one but the root partition clearly
illustrates that EUL evolution in the first instance parallels
phylogenesis as we know it today. On top of this primary
pattern there are two secondary and a tertiary pattern that
deserve attention while describing the clusters mentioned
above: extension of single EULs, gene duplication, and
reduction. Both superclusters B and C show that single
EUL extension and gene duplication may have occurred at
the same time, as exemplified by the appearance of EULS
domains of higher order (EULS2 and above) as well as
EULD domains within the more primitive taxa (e.g. the
lower plants of partition B). However, the picture
becomes more complicated as we consider partition C,
especially when starting from its gymnosperm cluster. The
latter, which according to the tree gave rise to the higher
plant EUL proteins, has EULS domains of higher order;
likewise, the lower plant EUL proteins above this cluster
(group 4') have EULD domains of higher order. One
would therefore expect the monocots and dicots, being
close relatives within this partition, to express EUL proteins of higher order, yet they are mixed lower/higher.
This may result from two different and not mutually
exclusive factors: reduction of higher-order EULs due to
deletion of unnecessary parts inherited from certain
ancestors on the one hand, and on the other hand the persistence of lower-order EULs in several ancestors from
which no sequences are available as yet. In any case
among the higher plants there is evidence of both single
EUL extension from zero (dicots and monocots) and gene
duplication (monocots only); they even seem to happen
independently along various lineages (e.g. a duplication
event of a higher-order EUL giving rise to symmetry
groups 6c and 6'c, accompanied by EULD shrinkage in
symmetry groups 6a, 6'a, 6b, and 6'b independently), suggesting that flowering plants may be undergoing a
renewed and accelerated cycle of EUL diversification internally, which is likely to have happened earlier among
lower plants once the first EUL domain had come into
being. Remnants of this early diversification can be seen

Expression profiles for the EUL from Arabidopsis revealed
that this protein is strongly induced by some abiotic as
well biotic stress factors. Similarly the expression of the
so-called OSR40 proteins from rice [16,18] and some EUL
proteins in maize [21] and banana [22] was shown to be
stress-related. In rice the EUL proteins are specifically
expressed upon salt stress and in response to ABA treatment. They have been proposed to play a role in the adaptive response of roots to a hyperosmotic environment and
the response of plant tissues to salt and osmotic stresses.
In maize leaves increased expression of an EUL protein
was observed four days after watering of the plants was
stopped [21], whereas the expression of the EUL protein
in banana was much higher in a dehydration tolerant variety upon sucrose stress [22]. The expression analyses for
these different EUL homologs suggest a role of these proteins associated with stress adaptation.

Conclusion
The identification of the EUL family provides evidence for
the occurrence in terrestrial plants of a highly conserved
plant specific carbohydrate-binding domain. The widespread distribution of the EUL domain strikingly contrasts
the more limited or even narrow distribution of most
other lectin domains found in plants [2]. To our knowledge this is the first lectin family which occurs ubiquitously in plants. Previously it was shown that the EUL
protein in Euonymus is located in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment [15]. Similarly most other EUL proteins
identified lack a signal peptide and therefore presumably
reside in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. At present all evidence from transcriptome analyses suggests that proteins
with EUL domains might be involved in stress responses
in plants.

Methods

EUL homology searches with the nucleotide as well as the
protein sequence were done with the different BLAST programs [23] available at the NCBI website http://

reconstructed from ESTs showing overlaps of at least 200

For phylogenetic analysis, an amino acid sequence dataset
was compiled with one operational taxonomic unit for
every single EUL domain from any known EUL protein.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/[26]. Multiple alignments were
visually inspected and manually corrected where necessary by means of the BioEdit package [27]. Two types of
phylogenetic analysis were carried out with the help of the
PHYLIP suite [28]. First, Maximum Likelihood trees were
calculated (program proml) using the following relevant
parameters: search for best tree (no user tree given as input
to start with), no rough analysis, global rearrangements
(the latter two settings effectively request an exhaustive or
non-heuristic search method that takes longer to complete but yields slightly better results), random input
order of sequences (number of times to jumble set to
two), Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino acid change
(which, being based on a much larger sample size, is an
improved Dayhoff PAM matrix model), discrete approximation to gamma distributed rates (this feature effectively
removes the artificial assumption that all positions have
the same substitution rate, as further imposed by parameter settings hereafter), coefficient of variation (CV) rates
0.6 (implying that the alpha or shape parameter of the
gamma distribution is 2.78, since alpha = 1/CV2), with the
three states in the Hidden Markov Model corresponding
to a rate of change of 0.498 with probability 0.532 (representing more conserved positions), 1.472 with probability 0.442 (representing medium variable positions), and
3.190 with probability 0.027 (representing hypervariable
positions). Second, the latter parameter settings - wherever applicable - were used for calculating Neighbor Joining trees (program protdist followed by neighbor) for
comparative purposes in order to verify the consistency of
phylogenetic inference. A third phylogenetic method was
applied using the MrBayes program with mixed models
[29]; where possible, model parameters were left to estimate by the program itself, and the best scoring tree out of
200,000 cycles from two runs with four Markov chains
each was picked for comparison with the previous two
methods. Trees were visualized by either TreeIllustrator
[30] or Dendroscope [31].

by dashes or colons. The percentage sequence identity/similarity of each
protein with EEA is also shown. Figure S3: Expression profile of the EUL
from Arabidopsis thaliana (At2 g39050, ArathEULS3) based on the
data provided by the Arabidopsis eFP browser. Relative expression of
ArathEULS3 in the shoots of 18 day-old seedlings subjected to different
abiotic stresses (A) and treatments with plant hormones (B). Relative
expression of ArathEULS3 in leaves of 4 week-old plants after infection
with the pathogens Botrytis cinerea (C), Pseudomonas syringae pv.
tomato DC3000 (avirulent strain) and Pseudomonas syringae pv.
tomato avrRpm1 (virulent strain) (D). Figure S4: Alignment of EST
sequence from Aedes aegypti (Aedae) and a nearly identical sequence
from creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) (Agrst). Identical nucleotides are indicated by asterisks. Figure S5: Amino acid sequences of proteins containing one or two Euonymus lectin (EUL) domains. The EUL
domains are shaded yellow and green. Signal peptides are shaded grey.
Only the EUL domains were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree
shown in Figure 6. The first EUL-domain and the second EUL-domain of
the two-domain lectins are indicated in the tree with d1 and d2, respectively. Accession numbers can be found in the Additional file 3: Table S2.
