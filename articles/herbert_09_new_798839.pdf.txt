Abstract
Background: Physiological processes occur in many species for which there is yet no sequenced
genome and for which we would like to identify the genetic basis. For example, some species
increase their vascular network to minimise the effects of reduced oxygen diffusion and increased
blood viscosity associated with low temperatures. Since many angiogenic and endothelial genes
have been discovered in man, functional homolog relationships between carp, zebrafish and human
were used to predict the genetic basis of cold-induced angiogenesis in Cyprinus Carpio (carp). In this
work, carp sequences were collected and built into contigs. Human-carp functional homolog
relationships were derived via zebrafish using a new Conditional Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit
(CSRBH) protocol. Data sources including publications, Gene Ontology and cDNA libraries were
then used to predict the identity of known or potential angiogenic genes. Finally, re-analyses of cold
carp microarray data identified carp genes up-regulated in response to low temperatures in heart
and muscle.
Results: The CSRBH approach outperformed all other methods and attained 8,726 carp to human
functional homolog relationships for 16,650 contiguous sequences. This represented 3,762 nonredundant genes and 908 of them were predicted to have a role in angiogenesis. The total number
of up-regulated differentially expressed genes was 698 and 171 of them were putatively angiogenic.
Of these, 5 genes representing the functional homologs NCL, RHOA, MMP9, GRN and MAPK1
are angiogenesis-related genes expressed in response to low temperature.
Conclusion: We show that CSRBH functional homologs relationships and re-analyses of gene
expression data can be combined in a non-model species to predict genes of biological interest
before a genome sequence is fully available. Programs to run these analyses locally are available
from http://www.cbrg.ox.ac.uk/~jherbert/.

Background
The cold-induced angiogenic response
Angiogenesis can be initiated by a variety of stimuli. For
example, angiogenesis is induced by airway smooth muscle strain in chronic asthmatics [1], by exercise [2-6] and
in some species by cold exposure [7-10]. Many species are
subjected to annual cycles of environmental cooling that
represents a significant challenge for the cardiovascular
system due to the effects of reduced oxygen diffusion and
increased blood viscosity associated with low temperatures [7,11,12]. One way of overcoming limitations to aerobic activity is to increase tissue capillary supply.
Although the underlying process is unclear, cold-induced
angiogenesis may respond to altered hormonal levels or
changes in the mechanical environment of endothelial
cells (ECs) [13]. Even within the mammalian literature, it
is apparent that a number of types of capillary growth
exist, e.g. pathological vs. physiological angiogenesis,
albeit under the influence of a restricted set of genes [14].

In order to improve the signal to noise ratio from the
wealth of published data and reduce the influence of host
tissue in the readout, gene expression profiles for
endothelial-specific up-regulated genes have recently
been identified [15,16]. No such information exists for
fish, although their use as an experimental model is
increasing due to the additional interventions not possible with mammals [17-22]. For the first time, we have
used an in silico approach to identify whether orthologs
between man and fish could be identified that were associated with angiogenesis, then used re-analysis of microarray data to see if these genes were differentially expressed
on cold exposure and finally we determined what proportion of the up-regulated genes were angiogenic or EC-specific. We anticipate this approach could be useful for
similar studies in non-model species for which a genome
sequence is not available but the human orthologs
involved in the biological process are known.

Results and Discussion
Gene assignment by ortholog identification
Orthologs (functional homologs), as a whole, perform an
equivalent function in respective genomes [23-25]. Based
on this assumption, carp orthologs of known angiogenic
human genes provide genes pivotal in their cold angiogenic response. Cold carp data from a study by Gracey
et al. 2004 [26] was to be used in this work to predict the
identity of cold induced angiogenic genes. The genes
assigned to carp sequences from the original article [26]
were not applicable to this study as they used a BLASTX
against multiple species databases and only looked for the
best hit without using a control step. In addition, the databases searched were from 2004, several years out of date,
and a more stringent method of sequence contig construction was used in this work (see methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/490

A problem to be overcome was how best to assign human
orthologs to 19,995 anonymous EST carp sequences collected from Genbank and CarpBASE (additional file 1).
Many of these sequences were less than 500 bases and
many of them contain partial or complete untranslated
regions. An obvious first step was to cluster them, using
CAP3 [27], to extend the sequence length and improve the
quality of any subsequent analyses. This reduced the
sequence count to a total of 16,650 sequence contigs and
singletons (additional file 2). The next challenge was to
identify their human orthologs.
Choosing the ortholog assignment method
Homologs, in the strictest sense, are characters that have
been passed down following a speciation event from a
common ancestor [25,28]. A gene in two species derived
from a single gene in their common ancestor is defined as
an ortholog (functional homolog) and usually has the
same or similar function between species [25,28], i.e. the
same gene in different organisms are orthologs [29]. Conversely, paralogs are defined as genes derived from a single
gene sequence duplication event and usually have different functions [25,28,30]. Orthologs and paralogs are not
the only gene histories and several other events can take
place, see [28] for a full list. In this work, the sole aim was
to find the most likely functional human homologs of
non-model transcripts and did not attempt to define or
classify paralogs or any other forms of gene histories.

Many bioinformatic programs and pre-computed databases of orthologs exist, a number of which are listed in a
recent review [28]. Essentially, there are 3 methods of
finding orthologs, tree based, graph based and a combination of the two. Tree methods use sequence alignments
and phylogenetic trees for predicting evolutionary relationships, while graph based methods use pairwise
sequence similarity search methods (such as BLAST) to
predict orthologs. The review highlights the merits of each
program or database and it provides the reader with a flow
chart (their figure four) to assist in the best choice of tool
for a particular application. After investigation of the recommended programs it was decided that none were applicable to the high-throughput analysis needed to cope with
the > 16 K incomplete anonymous carp nucleotide
sequences. The main reasons were the inability of these
programs to be queried with a high volume of data
through their web servers or the databases were several
years out of date.
Further literature searches revealed a tool called BLAST on
orthologous groups (BLASTO) [31] which searches a
query sequence against a database of orthologous groups
(a collection of homologous genes from at least two
genomes [28]) as a single unit. Although this tool enabled
searches against several combination method pre-com-

puted databases including Homologene [32,33], it could
only deal with one sequence at a time. Additionally, the
BLASTO form did not permit the user to change BLAST filtering options which, as seen below, makes a difference to
the quality and quantity of successful ortholog predictions.
Ortholog assignments, RBH and filtering options
A graph based, nearest neighbour [28] approach, RBH,
was considered the best option since constructing multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees from
incomplete nucleotide sequences would be inaccurate
and not amenable to high throughput. Strengthening this
decision, a performance assessment of different ortholog
prediction methods by Altenhoff and Dessimoz 2009 [34]
found the RBH performed well in comparison with the
other methods.

Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH) [28,29] is a technique using
BLAST to first search a query sequence against a genome.
If the resulting best hit matches the original query
sequence from a reciprocal BLAST then it is an ortholog

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/490

termed RBH. A diagrammatical representation of the RBH
process of carp vs. human is shown in figure 1, labelled
route 1.
An article by Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer 2008 [29]
tested ortholog RBH searching using different BLAST
options. The tests utilised bacterial genomes, neighbouring orthologs and paralogs to estimate error rates of
ortholog assignments by RBH. They found the soft filtering option -F "m S" with the addition of Smith-Waterman
(SW) alignments (-s T) were optimal for RBH success.
These options were tested for eukaryotes using carp vs.
human RBH searches. Four different BLAST options were
tested: soft filtering (-F "m S") with and without SW (-s T)
and hard filtering with and without SW. The results
revealed very little difference in the number of successful
RBH with or without the SW algorithm against their findings of 10%. In contrast, as with prokaryotes, soft filtering
increased the number of RBHs by 2% (209 RBHs). Table
1 shows the number of successful orthologs found using
carp vs. human RBH for the different filtering options. Fig-

This figure shows the routes to ortholog assignment
This figure shows the routes to ortholog assignment. Reciprocal Best Hit (RBH), labelled route 1, conveys if two genes
in carp and human find each other as the best hit in the other species. Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit, SRBH (route 2), extends
RBH by using a closely related species, zebrafish, to enhance ortholog assignments. This is possible as the zebrafish has many
more sequences in the databases, its genome is significantly more annotated and it has a genome sequence available. The Conditional Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit combines both RBH and SRBH as some sequences are still missing from zebrafish.

This table shows the performance of RBH using the different BLAST filtering options with eukaryotic sequences. The results from this analysis
showed the soft filtering option with no Smith and Waterman produced the highest number of successful RBHs.

ure 2 shows a bar chart of the successful RBH results normalised to the default BLAST options (-F T, -s F).
Contrary to the findings of Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer 2008 [29], who showed the SW algorithm improved
results by 10%, in this study using SW produced 0.0004%
(6) less successful results. However the analyses in this
work were slightly different to that of Moreno-Hagelsieb
and Latimer and are listed here:
1) They used complete bacterial genomes: A) These
sequences are generated from genomic DNA and are
sequenced in both strands. B) The Carp sequences are generated from single pass (one strand) cDNA sequencing
from RNA and, as such, are likely to contain more errors.

2) The protein sequences used in assessing RBH success:
A) Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer used full length and
defined proteins from complete bacterial genomes. B) The
carp sequences were partial proteins from 6 frame nucleotide translations and from a eukaryotic and not a
prokaryotic species.
3) The algorithm options used with BLAST were not
exactly the same. A) Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer used
the blastpgp algorithm from the NCBI [35] BLAST, which
has the Smith-Waterman -s T option available. B) In this
work blastall using blastx (carp vs. human) and tblastn
(human vs. carp) were used. The -s T option is only available for tblastn and not blastx with NCBI blastall. Note:

This figure
This figure summarises the number of successful RBHs found using different BLAST options. It can be seen that
soft filtering (-F "m S") makes a significant difference to the number of successful RBHs attained. The Smith-Waterman algorithm, on the other hand, made little difference to the number of successful RBHs. The results of each filtering option were
normalised to the default options of BLAST (-F T -s F).

blastpgp can only be used on protein sequences and not
nucleotides.
4) Some cDNAs span genes on different chromosome
strands and is another way RBH results could be affected
(E.g. cDNA DY691296).
However, even with these differences, the results were very
surprising because of other research [36] and considering
the -s F option is a fast approximation of the SW algorithm
(see methods for details). One thing to bear in mind is an
e-value of 1e-5 and soft filtering were employed in this
work, which in itself, would remove many spurious
matches otherwise found using the default BLAST heuristic. A further investigation into this revealed that the genes
successfully found with each method did not totally overlap. The heuristic BLAST alignment method predicted 62
functional homologs with RBH that SW did not find and
the SW alignment method predicted 63 that failed with
the BLAST heuristic. The intersection of results totally concurred. The questions to answer here were; why did one
algorithm fail RBH, whilst the other method was successful? And of these differences, which algorithm produced
the more believably evolutionary related RBH successes?
To investigate this finding further and to decide on which
method to use in this work, a manual inspection of
sequence alignments was needed in a systematic way to
avoid the problem of biased cherry picking. This was done
using a random number generator to pick 12 sequences to
investigate (see methods), 6 from each algorithm RBH
success. So the investigation was to see if the results were
believable for each algorithm. The results found that
~50% (additional file 3) of results suggested the default
BLAST option found the more likely evolutionary related
sequence as it found higher similar matches but at shorter
alignment lengths, which is believable as SW is good at
finding distant homology. However, this was not always
the case and the different sequence alignment algorithms
were correct for different sequences. As a consequence it
was not possible to automate the choice without manually viewing the results. Therefore, in this work the results
generated using the default BLAST heuristic was used for
the final data. However, it is recommended for other
researchers using these methods on small datasets to use
the intersection of both methods or the SW alone (based
on previous research [36]). This is not a problem for small
numbers of sequences but for Next Generation Sequence
data, for example, it is recommended the default heuristic
be used as it will take weeks to compute SW alignments.
All but one cold induced angiogenic gene were found with
both algorithms and users of this data can be confident in
the ortholog assignments of these genes. The exception
was the plasminogen gene PLG (cDNA CA965299).

Taking advantage of a closely related vertebrate
Zebrafish are a model teleost organism used in the elucidation of vertebrate development, molecular, genetic,
genomic and evolutionary biology [37]. As such its
genome has been sequenced with extensive annotation
and currently in the sequence databases there are over 6
million ESTs and 28 thousand Refseq proteins. Carp, on
the other hand, currently has ~20 thousand ESTs and no
genome sequence. It was possible to take advantage of this
annotation because of the close evolutionary relationship
carp has to zebrafish in that they diverged from their last
common ancestor only 50 million years ago [38]. Previous groups have shown that close genome evolutionary
relationships can aid ortholog identification [39,40]. In
the present study, zebrafish was also utilised as a stepping
stone approach to ortholog identification. Figure 1,
labelled route 2, shows a Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit
(SRBH) approach where RBH analysis is carried out twice,
once between carp and zebrafish and then between
zebrafish and human. If both were successful, then a carphuman ortholog was assigned. Using the SRBH analysis
gained a further 8% (8,145 sequences) successfully
assigned orthologs.
Teleost genome duplication and SRBH
Although there is a discrepancy as to when it happened,
there is much evidence for a genome duplication event in
teleosts [22,41-47]. A good example in zebrafish is the
paralogs Ets1 and Etsrp which both lie next to fli1a and
fli1b, respectively, but on different chromosomes. These
genes are important for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis
[48,49]. From a SRBH analysis, zebrafish genes ets1 and
etsrp best match the human gene ETS1 and fli1a, and fli1b
best matches the human FLI1, suggesting a genome duplication event occurred in zebrafish. Because of duplicate
genes, the best and second best hits to zebrafish and carp
genes were used to attain a successful SRBH. The impact of
genome duplication in ortholog searching can be seen in
the following example. The zebrafish peptide NP_958883
was the best hit to CA969258. However, the peptide
NP_958883 best matched human NP_003002. Blasting
NP_003002 back against zebrafish revealed two very similar sequences, NP_958876 and NP_958883. NP_958876
was the best hit and therefore failed SRBH (additional file
4). This is due to genome duplication of the zebrafish
genome and thus both genes in zebrafish can be considered orthologs to the same human gene.
RBH and a comparison with Homologene
Homologene is a database of orthologous groups defined
with BLAST pairwise alignments and phylogenetic trees
[32,33]. Since CSRBH included a zebrafish and human
ortholog RBH analysis, a comparison was made between
Homologene and this RBH step to see if the zebrafish to
human ortholog assignments from this work agreed.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:490

From the 8,145 successful RBHs, only 7,020 could be
compared as only these had both human and zebrafish
genes present in the Homologene data. This fact alone
gives support to using this approach as a user supplies all
genes, and as such, all are present. From these ortholog
assignments, 85% agreed with Homologene orthologous
groups. A manual investigation of some of those that disagreed suggests Homologene does not always perform
well for a proportion of duplicated genes. For instance,
one example, the zebrafish actc1l gene best matched the
human ACTC1 gene with 99% identity over the full alignment length of the gene but Homologene put actc1l in the
ACTB orthologous group (id: 110648) where alignment
percent identity was less at 94% (additional file 5). The
full results of the comparison can be viewed in additional
file 6. In addition, ten alignments were chosen randomly
and manually investigated (additional file 7) to see which
source of data was most realistic. The results of this suggested 8 out of 10 ortholog assignments were correct with
RBH whilst Homologene put the genes into different
orthologous groups.
A full comparison of RBH with Homologene
A full analysis was also performed that took all human
proteins in the Refseq database of proteins and RBH
searched against the full database of zebrafish Refseq proteins. On July 22nd 2009, there were 29,428 proteins in
the human database. 19,648 of these proteins resulted in
a successful RBH analysis against zebrafish. Build 64 of
Homologene (16th July 2009) contained 19,571 human
proteins. Therefore 33% of the human proteome was not
represented in Homologene at this time and only 12,035
of the 19,571 human proteins had a zebrafish homolog
protein in the same orthologous group.

There were 653 human/zebrafish orthologs identified by
Homologene only and not with the RBH procedure. In
contrast, there were 8,266 human/zebrafish orthologs
found using the RBH but not with in Homologene.
11,382 human proteins were found in both Homologene
and in the RBH analysis. 10,099 of these agreed, an 89%
agreement. This is very similar to the result above with
only the carp data.
These findings, particularly the fact that Homologene
only had 12,035 human proteins with a zebrafish
ortholog and the findings of Altenhoff [34], give a user
some further support and confidence to using a RBH
ortholog assignment approach rather than phylogenetic
tree methods for analysing large amounts of data from a
non-model species in a quick and fairly accurate manner.
The SRBH approach is endorsed by the fact other researchers have used closely related species to predict genes and
sequence motifs [39,40]. However, it should be noted that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/490

the comparisons done here with Homologene only validates the RBH method but not the CSRBH as, to definitively validate the CSRBH approach, the carp genome and
annotation need to be more complete.
In addition, the CSRBH approach does not attempt to better or replace the efforts of databases such as Homologene. One reason is that it does not attempt to deal with
paralogs and other sources of gene histories but only with
the most functional homologs (orthologs), though some
attention was given to the teleost genome duplication
event. So there are examples where Homologene better
assigns orthologs than the methods used here. Having
said that, with a non-model species not present in Homologene, this approach is excellent at giving a good approximation of the human functional homologs of
researchers' genes.
CSRBH, combining RBH and SRBH to find further
orthologs
Although adding the zebrafish intermediary step (SRBH)
improved ortholog assignment by 8%, 581 assignments
that failed using this procedure were successfully found
using a carp vs. human RBH alone (figure 1, route 1).
Inspection of a random sample of these found two examples of why this occurred. BLAST of carp EST EC394432
vs. zebrafish best hit the gene smyhc3 and the reciprocal
BLAST vs. carp found EST AB231800 as the best hit. However, smyhc3 was the fifth best hit to AB231800, thus failing the SRBH analysis (additional file 8). However, this
gene is successfully assigned a human ortholog from an
RBH analysis (figure 1, route 1).

Even more compelling was the situation with EST
AU052068 (additional file 9). It aligns with the human
protein NP_003745 as the best hit and the alignment was
highly similar with a percent identity of 91% over 200
amino acids. The same EST best aligned to the zebrafish
protein NP_956083 with 37% identity over 200 amino
acids. Hence, the EST is significantly more similar to the
human protein rather than the zebrafish. The human protein NP_003745 was BLAST searched against zebrafish to
see if the full-length protein found a likely ortholog in
zebrafish. The best hit to the human protein was
NP_956083, the same as found by searching EST
AU052068. Therefore, there is evidence that either some
genes do not exist in zebrafish and do so in carp or are not
currently found in zebrafish as the genome is not yet completely sequenced or annotated. Another piece of evidence
is, if a simple BLAST search is performed against the multiple species NR database of proteins at the NCBI [35],
24% of carp sequences preferentially match a human protein, whilst 30% match a zebrafish protein. This supports
the use of a Conditional Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit
(CSRBH) approach, which uses whichever species is a

closer match to the query and performs the appropriate
ortholog prediction route (figure 1). In addition, for any
that fail, a rescue was be performed by searching through
the other route.
CSRBH outperformed all other methods and produced
3% and 11% more successful ortholog assignments than
the SRBH and RBH, respectively. In total 8,726 contigs
were assigned an ortholog, totalling 3,762 non-redundant
genes (see additional file 10). See table 2 and figure 3 for
the number of successful ortholog assignments for all the
different analysis methods used in this work. We propose
that CSRBH should be the method of choice for researchers working with non-model species which have no
sequenced genome and partially sequenced genes.
A weakness with this approach is that it does not determine an orthologs absolute gene history and it will not
report to a user whether the ortholog found was derived
from a gene duplication event or from a speciation. That
said, these methods will enable a user to quickly find the
most likely functional homolog of a gene.
Prediction of angiogenic genes
Established angiogenic genes
Previous groups have developed complex data mining
methods using decision trees to identify genes of interest
[50]. In this study, 4 simple strategies were combined to
generate as a complete a set of angiogenic genes as possible. First the cardiovascular and angiogenesis groups at
Birmingham University used their knowledge to produce
a list of angiogenic genes that included those from the
recent literature [51] and the SABiosciences GEArray®
Human Angiogenesis Microarray [52]. A total of 260 angiogenesis related genes were predicted this way and a list
of 73 genes were contained in the successful CSRBH
results (additional file 11, column D, labelled in house).
However, it is possible many other genes have an undiscovered role in angiogenesis and, therefore, three further
methods were employed to predict additional angiogenic
genes.

Putative angiogenic genes
The second and third approaches used Perl programs to
scan article abstracts from PubMed [53] and Gene Ontology processes from AMIGO [54] using the following angiogenic related keywords as baits: 'angiogenic,
angiogenesis, neovascularization, neovascularisation, vasculogenesis, hypoxia, endoth VEGF'. This predicted a further 737 angiogenic genes (additional file 11, columns E
and F respectively).

A fourth method used gene expression of ECs. During the
activation of angiogenesis, ECs become activated and
switch on several signalling pathways that cause proliferation, migration and invasion [55,56]. This angiogenic
phenotype leads to an up-regulation of EC genes. Therefore, genes up-regulated in the endothelial transcriptome
could be angiogenic. The endothelium transcriptome has
been extensively defined [15,16] and genes up-regulated
in ECs were compared with the human/carp orthologs to
identify additional putative angiogenic genes; 98 were
found (additional file 11, columns G and H).
Total angiogenic genes
Combining the results from the four data mining methods gave a total of 908 non-redundant predicted angiogenic genes (additional file 11). We postulate this gave
us a comprehensive set and the best chance of discovering
cold-induced angiogenic genes from the carp data. However, it should be noted, and the authors fully acknowledge, that not every gene predicted here is a genuine
angiogenesis gene and there will be some false positives.
Very few bioinformatic predictions are 100% foolproof
and this study is aimed at guiding the bench scientist into
making more informed decisions before going into the
laboratory. The number of different methods that predicted a gene angiogenic now ranks the genes. For example, the gene HIF1A is a well-known angiogenic gene and
was predicted as such by all four methods. Column I entitled "Number of methods" in additional file 11 gives the
number of methods predicting a gene angiogenic and is
ranked in a descending order. Conversely, genes that are
not so well known to be angiogenic genes are only found
by one or two methods. If this approach is employed and
genes selected that were predicted by more than one

method, reduces the high percentage of angiogenic genes
from 25% down to 9. This is reduced further if you only
take genes with 3 and/or 4 methods. But given the full list,
a researcher can decide based on the presence of functional domains or personal knowledge which ones are of
interest to investigate with full knowledge that the human
functional homolog was only loosely associated with the
biological process of interest.

cooling stages from 30 to 10°C vs. a control temperature
of 30°C. Overall, 252 transcriptional regulatory, RNA
splicing and translation control genes were found to be
up-regulated in all tissues. Interestingly, some tissue-specific affects were also seen, e.g. in the glycolytic pathway
of brain and lipid metabolism of liver. This data set
proved appropriate for re-analysis to predict cold-induced
angiogenic genes in skeletal and heart muscle tissues.

Re-analysis of gene expression data
Three established methods of measuring gene expression
used in biological research are microarrays, cDNA and
Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) libraries. To
investigate numerous pathologies many institutes around
the world have generated, analysed and deposited large
amounts of expression data into public repositories [57].
Examples of such databases are the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO), Cancer Genome Anatomy Project
(CGAP), National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)
arrayExpress. It has been shown that data mining of relevant data sets can successfully lead to the identification of
biologically interesting targets [15,16,58-67].

Persistently up-regulated genes
Two strategies were applied to the data. The first utilised
the data without intervention for heart and muscle tissues,
employing a threshold score > = 2. The total number of
up-regulated cDNAs for heart was 748, 270 non-redundant genes, and for muscle 1230 cDNAs, 475 genes. Any
cDNAs with significant contradicting expression were
removed. For both heart and muscle combined there were
589 non-redundant genes, 143 of which were predicted
angiogenic genes (see table 3 and additional file 12; columns c and d for both heart and muscle sheets).

Cold response differentially expressed genes
Carp is an ectotherm with a body temperature similar to
the water it is immersed in and can adapt to a range of
temperatures (eurythermal). A recent study investigated
physiological adaptation of carp exposed to gradually
lower temperatures [26]. Microarray analysis measured
the change in gene expression, in several tissues, at several

Initial cooling, fold ratio subtraction and microarray reanalysis
It is thought angiogenesis is switched on in the initial
stages of cooling, before the animal has become acclimatised to a particular temperature. This has been shown in
rats subjected to cooling to 4°C which led to a 2.7 fold
increase in VEGF expression for 1 to 4 hours and returned
to the basal level at 24 hours [8,9]. Therefore, the microarray data was analysed between the first and last time
point at each target temperature.

This table conveys the numerical breakdown of results for the differential cDNA expression due to cold temperatures on the carp array. 171 were
the total number of putative cold induced angiogenic genes.

First, ratios were calculated between each of the cooling
time points vs. a control group (see methods). Analysing
heart and muscle separately and combining the results
gave 83 unambiguous cDNAs with a ratio subtraction > =
2 and this represented 30 non-redundant genes. 8 of these
genes were predicted angiogenic, see table 3 and additional file 12, column e for both heart and muscle sheets.

should corroborate each other. Dealing the heart tissue
first, there were 7 cDNAs that reached a p-value < = 0.5
and 3 cDNAs that had a ratio subtraction > = 2 (see additional file 12, sheet 12a). These cDNAs did not overlap
but the ratio subtraction results, though not significant,
for the Limma cDNAs were positive. So they concurred
but not with significance for the ratio subtraction.

To further discover genes switched on at initial cooling,
microarray analysis using Limma from the BioConductor
R package [68] was used to fit a linear model to the arrays
(see methods). An adjusted p-value < = 0.05 was
employed as a significance threshold. 7 and 577 unambiguous cDNAs were found to be up-regulated in heart
and skeletal muscle respectively (table 3 and additional
file 12; columns f and g, both heart and muscle sheets).
Combined, this represented 196 non-redundant genes, of
which 62 were predicted to be angiogenic (table 3 and
additional file 12; columns f and g, both heart and muscle
sheets).

Muscle, in contrast, gave better corroboration between
ratio and Limma analyses. There were 577 cDNAs with
Limma adjusted p-value < = 0.05. There were 82 total ratio
subtractions that reached significance (see additional file
12, sheet 12b). Of these, 47 agreed with significant Limma
results. The results were encouraging. In general, the
number of genes predicted by a method are always a balance between false positives and false negatives. In this
case 47 cDNAs are in common in total between the "ratio"
and the "Limma" methods for muscle. However, differences between the two methods are expected as the first is
based on a hard cut-off on the fold change, the second is
based on a conservative cut-off on a p-value after multiple
test correction (so it accounts for the variation, not only
for the mean value; and also for multiple tests). The reason for using the different methods is: if 3 biological replicates were present than the second would be the ideal,
however, here only different temperatures were used as

replicates and as such, there were no real biological replicates. Therefore, the comparison between the methods
might be more informative. In the results genes that are
predicted by 1 method and not contradicted by the others
are used: this is equivalent to lowering the multiple test
correction threshold in one method when results agree
with the other.
Total cold induced genes
2035 cDNA sequences were unambiguously up-regulated
for all three methods, representing 698 genes and 171 of
these were identified as angiogenesis-related genes (table
3 and additional file 12).
Summary of analyses
The combined results of this analysis are summarised in
figure 4 and are as follows: From the 16,650 contigs
searched, 8,726 were successfully assigned an ortholog,
which amounted to 3,762 non-redundant gene orthologs.
908 of the orthologs were predicted to be angiogenesis
genes and 698 of the predicted orthologs were found to be
induced by cold temperature. Finally, cross-referencing
these genes found 171 cold induced angiogenic genes
(additional file 13).
Biologically relevant genes
The aim of this study was to develop a bioinformatic
method of predicting genes of biological interest in a nonmodel species. Although many putative angiogenesis
genes were found, some key angiogenic genes were not
present on the carp array. For instance, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major activator of angiogenesis [69] and it would have been interesting to see the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/490

effect of cold exposure on this gene. Nevertheless, table 4
displays 12 out of the 171 angiogenesis-related genes upregulated by low temperature. On investigation of these
genes (highlighted on table 4 and below), there is encouraging evidence that these methods were successful.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1)
MAPK1 is part of the MAPK-signalling pathway, which is
the interface to a myriad of cellular processes like differentiation, proliferation and development [70-72]. It is also
activated by two upstream kinases RAF and MEK, which
are themselves activated by growth factor receptors [72].
Upon activation, MAPK1 is phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates targets such
as c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myc and Tal-1 and initiates transcription
of many genes [72]. During angiogenesis MAPK1 is activated in ECs and induces EC proliferation, critical to the
establishment of new vessels [73], abrogates apoptosis
and promotes the transcription of VEGF, itself a key activator of angiogenesis [74]. It is possible this is done via the
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) gene as MAPK1
can activate HIF1A and this transcription factor is known
to mediate VEGF expression [71,74]. The involvement of
HIF1A in cold-induced angiogenesis fits well as reduced
oxygen diffusion and increased blood viscosity can lead to
tissue hypoxia.

Interestingly, the MAPK-pathway regulates expression of
MMP9 [75,76] which also was predicted as a cold-induced
angiogenic gene in this study. This finding is supported by
the fact that inhibition of MEK, an upstream activator of
MAPK1, curtails the expression of MMP9 [75] and that the
MAPK-pathway induces transcription of MMP9 via the
upstream promoter site AP-1 [77].
Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9)
MMP9 is a member of a family of zinc containing
endopeptidases (type IV collagenase) and plays a major
role in angiogenesis [78,79]. MMP9 is synthesised as an
inactive zymogen (pro-MMP9) that is activated by proteolysis [80]. During angiogenesis, MMP9 is secreted by
endothelial cells to degrade the extracellular matrix, thus
allowing ECs to migrate and form new blood vessels [81].
Coupled to this are the facts that MMP9 inhibition significantly decreased cerebral EC migration and proliferation
[82] and that a positive correlation with micro vessel density and MMP9 expression exists [83]. MMP9 is also
known to release VEGF from extracellular matrix (ECM)
stores [84,85].

Ras homolog gene family, member A (RHOA)
Another cold-induced angiogenic gene that was predicted
in this study was RHOA, which is also known to induce
MMP9 expression [86]. RHOA is a member of the RHOfamily GTPases which are part of the RAS superfamily

From the 135 putative angiogenic genes up regulated due to cold temperatures, 12 genes considered biologically interesting in terms of angiogenesis
are listed. The four highlighted in bold are reviewed in the text.

[87]. It has been shown that dominant-negative RHOA in
ECs impairs tube formation and sprouting in vitro [88].
This is replicated in vivo where dominant-negative
N19RhoA impairs vessel assembly and dominant-active
V14RhoA stimulates ECs to form vessels [89]. RHOA has
also been shown to induce cytoskeleton re-organisation,
enhance migration and increase angiogenic capacity [90].
VEGF increases RHOA activity by enhancing its recruitment to the membrane and mediating the RhoA/Rho
pathway during angiogenesis [91]. Over expression of
dominant-active RhoA leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2, which is the key inducer of angiogenesis [92]. Again, related to hypoxia and low oxygen
diffusion at low temperatures, RHOA is up-regulated in
hypoxia and has been shown to be required for the accumulation of HIF1A, which induces VEGF expression [93].
Granulin (GRN)
Some of the cold-induced genes have not been widely
studied as angiogenic factors but have nevertheless been
implicated in the process. These include granulin and
nucleolin. Granulin is not a direct acting angiogenic factor
but has been shown to stimulate VEGF expression in
breast carcinoma cells [94]. Granulin has also been shown
by yeast two hybrid assays to bind the HIV Tat protein that
is actively secreted by HIV infected cells and acts as an EC

growth and angiogenic factor [95]. In addition, granulin
has been shown to be expressed within proliferating ovarian carcinomas blood vessels and interact with perlecan.
Therefore, it is thought to regulate tumour angiogenesis
and influence cancer growth [96]. Finally, an anti-granulin antibody has been shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis in human hepatomas implanted into athymic mice
[97].
Nucleolin (NCL)
Nucleolin is one of the major proteins of the nucleolus
but is also expressed on the cell surface where it binds a
variety of ligands involved in several cell processes.
Expression of nucleolin is particularly high on the surface
of ECs in angiogenic blood vessels [98]. Inhibition of
nucleolin in ECs prevents capillary tube formation and
retards EC migration [99]. It is of interest that MMP9, also
a predicted cold-responsive angiogenic gene in this study,
is associated with nucleolin in angiogenesis. Mimicking
hypoxia led to a 3-fold increase in MMP9 protein levels,
due to enhanced translational efficiency caused by nucleolin binding to the 3' UTR of MMP9 [100]. These data
showed that MMP9 expression during angiogenesis can
be post-transcriptionally regulated by nucleolin. Lastly,
antibodies to nucleolin have been shown to suppress
tumour growth and angiogenesis [101].

Conclusion
We provide evidence in this study that genes of biological
interest in a non-model species, without a sequenced
genome, can be discovered by combining re-analysis with
a fast and efficient method of finding orthologs between
fish and mammals. With the advent of next generation
sequencing we envisage this approach will be useful to
researchers doing similar studies in other organisms or for
other biological processes. Programs using the methods
from this work can be downloaded from http://
www.cbrg.ox.ac.uk/~jherbert/ and can be used to run
these analyses locally.

Methods
Bioinformatics analyses - sequence collection and contigs
assembly
On the 23rd March 2007 the total number of cDNA
sequences represented in the CarpBASE 3.0 [102,103]
database publicly available for download was 17,825.
Additional sequences from other sources were found
using Entrez [104] to search Genbank (release 158, February 2007) for all carp ESTs and mRNAs. A total of 19,995
EST sequences were collected and clustered using the
CAP3 [27] (Version Date: 04/15/05) software to create
overlapping contigs of the same carp genes. All the default
settings were employed except for a stringent overlap percent identity cut-off of 98%. Combining the singleton EST
counts with the clustered contigs gave a total 16,650
sequences for use in ortholog searches. All the cDNA
accession numbers are in additional file 1 (note:
AJ577601 was removed at the author's request) and a key
to which sequences were contained in the contiguous
sequences is in additional file 2.
Unbiased selection for evaluation of results
A systematic method of selecting results to analyse was
required in this study to counteract any cherry picking
bias. This was achieved by choosing random numbers
from the RANDOM.ORG website [105], which generates
random numbers based on atmospheric noise. These
numbers determined the particular results that were
looked at, and in most cases, 10 random results were chosen.
Ortholog identification RBH, SRBH and CSRBH
The carp contigs were BLASTX searched with the stand
alone NCBI BLAST [106,107] in all six frames against the
human Refseq protein database [108]. The best hit was
recorded and assigned as a putative ortholog. To increase
the quality of the data, a reciprocal TBLASTN was performed which took the human ortholog protein and
searched back against the carp contigs sequences. This was
called the reciprocal best hit (RBH) [23,29,109] and was
regarded as successful if the contig found in the RBH

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/490

search represented the same human protein queried (figure 1, route 1).
The default BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic approach
where it searches for small words (sequence regions) in
the query and the subject that are exactly the same. It then
attempts to extend out the matching words until a score
threshold is reached to produce longer alignments. The
Smith-Waterman algorithm [110], on the other hand,
uses a dynamic programming method to produce an optimal local alignment [111,112]. This can be utilised in
BLAST with -s T [113] options for BLASTP and TBLASTN.
Different BLAST filtering performance were tested (-F F, -F
"m S", -F T and -s T) on eukaryotic data to compare those
results of prokaryotes [29]. All BLAST searches employed
an e-value of 1e-5 as done by Woods et al. 2005 [45] All
orthologs that failed this step were removed.
A Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit (SRBH) was a two-stepped
process where an RBH between carp and zebrafish was
first performed and then for the successes, a second RBH
was carried out between zebrafish and human. Only those
sequences successful for both RBH searches were assigned
orthologs (figure 1, route 2).
Finally, a Conditional Stepped Reciprocal Best Hit
(CSRBH) approach was performed using a Perl program
to post-process BLAST results. Carp sequences were BLAST
searched against both human and zebrafish Refseq proteins and the best hit determined the route to ortholog
identification (figure 1).
Angiogenic genes
Four different methods were used to identify which genes
are, or potentially are, angiogenic:

1) The in-house method involved collecting genes based
on the authors own angiogenesis research, combined with
genes on the SABiosciences [52] commercial angiogenic
array and those listed in the literature [51].
2) Gene data was downloaded from Genbank [114] and
Perl programs, in conjunction with PubMed [53], were
used to find article abstracts that contained one or more
of the following angiogenic keywords: angiogenic, angiogenesis, neovascularization, neovascularisation, vasculogenesis, hypoxia, endoth and VEGF.
3) Similarly, Gene Ontology data was downloaded from
Genbank [114] and Perl programs were used to search the
Gene Ontology process data for each protein. The same
keywords were used as in the previous method.
4) Any genes differentially or specifically expressed in ECs
are potential angiogenic genes. Therefore, an in-silico pre-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:490

dicted endothelial transcriptome gene list [15,16] was
compared with the genes in this data set to find those
endothelial up regulated or specific. These genes that had
a False Discovery Rate (FDR) qvalue of < = 0.01 were
classed as endothelial.
Cold response genes: persistently up-regulated genes
Cold response genes were found mining the microarray
data from Gracey et al. 2004 [26]. Differentially expressed
cDNAs for the heart and muscle were taken directly from
the data without any processing. These were the first list of
cold-induced genes.

Then a second list was generated on the hypothesis that
angiogenesis is switched on at initial cooling and
switched off after some time. Therefore, two further strategies were employed.
Cold response genes: ratio subtraction
Gracey et al. 2004 [26] harvested RNA and ran microarrays for several time points at each drop in temperature
(see their figure 1). As angiogenesis is hypothesised to be
switched on at initial cooling, subtracting gene expression
ratio on the 1st day of cooling vs. the expression ratio on
the last day will show which genes showed highest expression on initial cooling. This can be expressed as a simple
equation:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/490

expression between the first day of cooling and the control was significantly different to the change in expression
between the last time points and the control. The Benjamini and Hochberg method [116] was used to correct
for multiple testing. Amongst significant probes, different
patterns were observed. However, angiogenesis-related
genes are predicted to be up-regulated in the initial stages
of cooling, before the animal has become acclimatised to
a particular temperature; therefore, genes that were upregulated at the 1st time point but showed no differential
regulation at the last day of cooling were selected from
this list. An adjusted p-value < = 0.05 was used as a cut-off.

Comparison with Homologene
Homologene orthologous group data was downloaded
from the Homologene ftp site at the NCBI [117]. Then a
Perl program compared the gene symbol assignments for
human and zebrafish between the two data sources. additional file 6 contains the results.
Programs for running ortholog searches

enabling high-throughput ortholog assignment for
incomplete nucleotide sequences. Please contact the first
author for guidance as some customisation maybe needed
depending on species.

using Limma from BioConductor R package [68], a general linear model approach that uses an empirical Bayesian smoothing [115] method to gain power when a large
number of predictors (i.e. probes) are present with a small
number of cases (i.e. arrays). Contrasts were employed
within Limma to detect probes for which the change in
