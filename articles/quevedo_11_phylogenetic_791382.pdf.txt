Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes
for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major
phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to Abiotrophia/Granulicatella.
Results: As lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols
were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization
stringency, and fluorescence intensity. The new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples
harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different
volunteers. Best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined
lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase. Hybridization stringency had to be
established strictly for each probe. Thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and
labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. Applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes
detected only Lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of the Lactobacillus casei group. The most cariogenic biofilm
contained two orders of magnitude higher L. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. Abiotrophia/
Granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas
Streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers.
Conclusions: Application of these new group- and species-specific FISH probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid
bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structurefunction relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. The probes should prove of
value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups
of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

Background
It is estimated that more than 1010 bacteria per gram of
dental plaque colonize the human oral cavity. More than
half of them still remain uncultivable. Their existence is
only known because a fingerprint in form of a sequence
from a gene fragment, most often from 16S rDNA, could
be traced in a clinical sample [1]. All oral microorganisms
form biofilms on surfaces such as the oral mucosa, the
tongue, or the surface of the teeth. Many supragingivally

predominant bacteria belong to the Firmicutes phylum
(Gram-positive rods and cocci of low G+C content) with
the lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) as the largest
and clinically important subgroup [2,3]. Comprising
streptococci, lactobacilli, and Granulicatella/Abiotrophia
species (formerly described as nutritionally variant streptococci), LAB are main constituents of the commensal
microbiota of the human oral cavity, but form also part
of the biofilms colonizing the upper respiratory, intestinal
and urinary tracts. In the oral cavity, they are thought to
play major roles in dental plaque formation and oral biofilm homeostasis. However, under conditions of prolonged shifts of biofilm composition, LAB may induce

dental caries through excessive lactic acid formation [4],
and upon penetration into the blood stream LAB may
cause in susceptible individuals a variety of life-threatening conditions such as endocarditis, septicemia, or
meningitis [5,6].
In situ techniques that allow monitoring individual
cells and cell populations within biofilms are important
tools to investigate natural biofilm ecologies [7,8]. However, few probes for the detection and quantification by
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of oral LAB species have been described so far [9,10]. Here we report
the design, characterization and pilot evaluation of
probes recognizing major phylogenetic clusters or species of oral lactobacilli, the Abiotrophia/Granulicatella
group, and a few taxa of oral streptococci. Applied for
validation to in situ formed supragingival biofilms, the
probes detected high levels of both mitis group streptococci and Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, and identified strains of Lactobacillus fermentum and the
Lactobacillus casei group.
(The study is part of the requirements for BQ’s Doctor degree of Dental Medicine.)

Results and Discussion
Probe design

In this study we relied for probe design on the species
and phylotype description provided by the human oral
microbiome database (HOMD) [11], which comprises a
collection of 16S rRNA sequences of both cultivable and
so far non-cultivable taxa representing the currently
known width of bacterial diversity found in the human
oral cavity [12]. Oligonucleotide probes were designed
with specificity for phylogenetic groups or species of
Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Granulicatella
and Abiotrophia. Table 1 lists all probes with their
sequence and optimum formamide concentration. The
latter was determined by systematic optimization in
experiments with both reference strains and clinical plaque samples.
Figure 1 outlines the concept for the design of the
probes targeting oral lactobacilli. Two broad Lactobacillus probes (LGC358a and LAB759) were generated with
the idea that they should complement each other and
thus limit the potential of misidentifications [7]. Elongated by one and shifted by four bases LGC358a is a
derivative of probe LGC354a [13]. Probes LGC358b (staphylococci and related bacteria) and LGC358c (streptococci) are analogously related to LGC354b and
LGC354c described by Meier et al. [13]. As observed
often with probes to larger phylogenetic groups, initial
experiments with both probes detected besides the targeted lactobacilli significant numbers of false positives
(predominantly cocci) when applied to oral plaque samples (see below). In silico analyses suggested that these

Page 2 of 12

false hybridizations were due to single sequence mismatches and could possibly be avoided by the application of unlabeled competitor probes that are fully
complimentary to the targeted 16S rRNA segment of
the false positive organisms. Applied in excess together
with the labeled FISH probe such competitor probes
can increase the differentiation between true- and
potential false positives [14]. Thus, LGC358a used in
conjunction with LGC358b-comp should recognize
selectively most Lactobacillaceae organisms and in addition detect parts of the non-oral families Leuconostocaceae and Carnobacteriaceae, whereas LAB759, when
applied together with LAB759-comp (which should suppress recognition of Streptococcus mutans as well as
Eikenella, Kingella, and Neisseria sp.) is supposed to
identify all oral lactobacilli except Lactobacillus salivarius and the majority of L. fermentum strains. Application
of these competitor probes to various types of plaques
samples proved to be successful in providing specificity
for lactobacilli (see below). The other probes for lactobacilli were designed to identify bacteria from all major
deep branching clusters of the phylogenic tree (Figure 1).
Three probes recognize deeply branched, individual species (L. fermentum, L. salivarius and Lactobacillus vaginalis), which, however, belong to the most frequently
detected oral lactobacilli. Probes recognizing oral Granulicatella and Abtiotrophia species (ABI161 and
ABI1246), Lactococcus lactis (LCC1030) and cocci
belonging to Streptococcus constellatus/Streptococcus
intermedius (L-Sco/int172-2) or Streptococcus sobrinus
(L-Ssob440) complement the set of new probes.
Permeabilization of lactobacilli for FISH

Uniform permeabilization for FISH of fixed lactobacilli
(but not of streptococci or Abiotrophia/Granulicatella)
is a known problem [9], in particular with certain
‘notorious’ strains. Like other authors before, we have
evaluated several permeabilization protocols that precede hybridization and obtained the best results with a
modification of a procedure proposed by Harmsen et al.
[9] (data not shown). It was applied selectively to all
Lactobacillus probes and consists of a 5 min exposure
to lysozyme and achromopeptidase, followed by a 30
min incubation with lipase.
Fluorescence intensity and probe specificity

Lactobacillus probes were tested with 22 reference
strains representing the different oral lactobacilli clusters
as described by the HOMD (Table 2) and, with the
exceptions of probe LAB759 and Lfer466, displayed the
anticipated reactivity profile. As an example Figure 2A
shows the staining of Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413
with Lcas467-Cy3. Pointing at one of the strengths of
single cell analyses with FISH, strain Lactobacillus

crispatus ATCC 33820 was found contaminated with L.
fermentum and required recloning (Figure 2B). With
several probes the fluorescence intensity was weak but
could be significantly improved by adding non-fluorescent helper probes to the hybridization solution [15], or
by employing probes containing locked-nucleic-acids
(LNA) [16]. The former bind to regions of the 16S
rRNA that are adjacent to the target sequence thereby
contributing to the opening of the rRNA’s 3-D structure
and improving probe accessibility, whereas the latter
contain one or two derivative nucleotide analogs with
their ribose locked in a C3’-endo conformation which
leads to a higher target selectivity of the probe. Unexpected from in silico data, LAB759 labeled the L. salivarius reference strain ATCC 11741 and Lfer466 bound
to the Lactobacillus reuteri type strain CCUG 33624T.
The reasons for these exceptional hybridizations remain
to be determined. Generally, the LNA-probes yielded

L-Lbuc439-2

L-Lbre466-2

high fluorescence intensity but also required high formamide concentrations to display the predicted specificity. In particular, L-Lbre466 was cross-reactive with
Lactobacillus colehominis and L-Lbuc438 was crossreactive with some strains of both the L. casei and
L. reuteri clusters if the formamide concentration was
kept below 45%. Similarly, the L-Lcol732 probe was
false positive with strains from the Lactobacillus buchneri cluster at < 40% formamide. Of the other probes
listed in Table 1, ABI1246 was strongly positive with all
four Abiotrophia/Granulicatella reference strains tested
(Granulicatella adjacens CCUG 27809 T and HE-G-R
613A, Granulicatella elegans CCUG 38949T and Abiotrophia defectiva CCUG 36937), whereas ABI161 labeled
only the Granulicatella strains. Probe LCC1030 was
positive with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis reference
strain NCC2211 [17], and the S. mutans and S. sobrinus

(40% formamide). (B) L. crispatus ATCC 33820 stained with both Lfer466-Cy3 (plus the corresponding helper probes) and Lgas458-FAM (25%

cells, which had to be eliminated by recloning. (C) Identification of L. fermentum in biofilm 013 using probe Lfer466-Cy3 (plus helper probes; 25%

aggregate of large unidentified filaments stained with the Lactococcus probe LCC1030-Cy3 and the streptococcal probe L-Sco/int172-2-FAM at
30% formamide. The bacteria are double false positive under these stringency conditions, whereby the detection of the Cy3 fluorescence is
hampered by the much stronger FAM fluorescence. To prevent such false positive hybridization, the formamide concentration had to be
increased to ≥ 40%. Bars: 10 μm.

UA159T and OMZ 176, respectively, while none of the
probes was positive with strains from other streptococcal species. Probe L-Ssob440-2 yielded better fluorescence intensity than the previously described probe
SOB174 [10], but had to be used at high stringency. All
these findings were as expected from in silico data.
Enumeration of lactic acid bacteria from in situ formed
biofilms

The applicability of the probes was tested with three
in situ formed biofilm samples. The samples were

harvested from bovine enamel discs carried in acrylic
appliances on the buccal side of the mandibular premolar/molar regions [18] by three volunteers whose discs
differed greatly in the extent of demineralization (-3%,
-15%, and -32%) generated during the 10 days of intermittent extraoral exposure to a 5% glucose/5% sucrose
solution. All samples were positive for lactobacilli as
detected by the two broadly reactive Lactobacillus probes
LGC358a and LAB759 (Figure 3). Total cell numbers and
numbers of lactobacilli were very similar to findings from
an earlier study investigating the microbiota associated

16S rRNA probes
Figure 3 Enumeration by FISH of lactic acid producing bacteria in three in situ grown biofilms. Biofilms were harvested from bovine
enamel discs, carried in situ for 10 days and nights by three different volunteers. The discs differed greatly in the extent of demineralization
indicated in the within legend of the plot. The detection limit (dl) of the FISH assay was approximately 103 bacteria per ml of sample.

with the in situ development of caries [19]. Both probes
had to be used imperatively together with their respective
competitor probes, since, without them, large numbers of
cocci and other morphotypes were positive. In the biofilm from disc 013 (biofilm 013 in the following)
LGC358a stained clearly two populations of rods that differed in length, whereas LAB759 identified only the
shorter of the two morphotypes. The longer and predominant cell type had the probe reactivity profile
LGC358a+/LAB759-/Lfer466+/Lreu986+/Lcas467- (Figure
2C), whereas the smaller one was LGC358a + /LAB759
+
/Lfer466-/Lreu986-/Lcas467+, indicating that the larger
rods are L. fermentum and the smaller ones lactobacilli
from the casei group. While the total number of L. casei,
streptococci or Abiotrophia/Granulicatella seemed not
to correlate with the extent of disc demineralization, the
high concentration of L. fermentum in the biofilm of the
extremely demineralized disc 013 was quite remarkable.
All other lactobacillus probes gave negative results.
Concerning Lsal574 and Lvag222 we found that both

these probes had to be used at much higher stringency
conditions (50% formamide) than expected from the
in vitro experiments with reference strains to prevent
cross-reactivity with other biofilm bacteria. In particular
cells with the characteristic morphology of Selenomonas
were often cross-reactive at conditions of insufficient
stringency. Abiotrophia and Granulicatella could be
detected in high numbers in all three samples. Both
ABI161 and ABI1246 recognized cocci, which in double-labeling experiments stained always negative with
the streptococcal probes LGC358c and MIT447 (data
not shown). Finally, all samples contained high numbers
of streptococci, mostly from the mitis group. S. mutans,
however, was found with MUT590 in only one sample
at low concentration, and the probes for S. sobrinus and
S. constellatus/S. intermedius gave negative results. Identification by FISH of streptococci, in particular of the
mitis group, is hindered severely by high conservation of
the 16S rRNA gene sequence among these taxa [20,21]
and therefore FISH detection of oral streptococci still

relies mostly on phylogenic group-specific probes.
A surprise finding, confirmed with supragingival plaque
samples and scrapings from the dorsum of the tongue,
was that both Lactococcus probe LCC1030 and S. constellatus/intermedius probe L-Sco/int172-2 triggered
rather strong fluorescence of long filaments with
blunted ends (Figure 2D), which could only be suppressed by applying formamide concentrations exceeding 40%. The results were confirmed when probes with
exchanged fluorescence labels were used (Cy3 instead of
6-FAM and vice versa). Potential specificity problems
associated with phylogenetic group-specific probes are a
known phenomenon [7,22]. However, screening of the
RDP10 database for oral bacteria with this type of morphology and ≤ 2 sequence mismatches within the gene
fragments complementary to these probes, failed to
reveal any hints about the possible identity of these filaments. Experiments aiming at their isolation by fluorescence activated cell sorting are ongoing.
Typing of Lactobacillus isolates from in situ grown oral
biofilms

With the aim to verify the identification by FISH of the
lactobacilli present in the three in situ grown biofilm
samples (Figure 3), aliquots were cultured on LBS agar.
Five strains (OMZ 1117-1121), representing the various
colony types observed, were isolated and characterized
by both FISH and partial sequencing of the 16S rDNA

(Table 3). Sequence analysis identified two strains as
L. fermentum (OMZ 1117 and 1121) [EMBL: FR667951]
and two as L. casei/L. paracasei (OMZ 1118 and 1120)
[EMBL: FR667952], based on 100% sequence similarity
with respective reference strains. The fifth strain was
typed as L. vaginalis (OMZ 1119) [EMBL: FR667953]
with a sequence match score of 0.995 to reference strain
Dox G3. L. vaginalis had not been detected by direct
FISH analysis of the biofilms (Figure 3), presumably
because the cell number was below the detection limit
of approximately 103 bacteria per ml of sample suspension. Tested by FISH with the whole set of probes all
five isolates showed the anticipated profile (Table 3).
The two L. fermentum isolates were negative to weakly
positive with LAB759 in repeated experiments. This is
explained by L. fermentum strains having an adenine at
position 760 of their 16S rRNA, as opposed to a cytosine at the corresponding position of probe LAB759.
This peripheral mismatch may result sometimes in
weak cross-reactivity (see also L. fermentum strains in
Table 2). In summary, typing by gene sequencing corroborated the data obtained from the direct FISH analysis
of the in situ grown biofilms.
Critical importance of several assay parameters

Lactobacilli are difficult targets for FISH because of their
cell wall’s resistance to probe penetration. The protocol
used successfully in the present study to increase cell

permeability evolved from the method of Harmsen et al.
[9], which we supplemented with achromopeptidase,
previously described to open cell walls of Actinomyces
strains [23,24]. Systematic evaluation of this threeenzyme-pretreatment with 12 reference strains from
seven Lactobacillus species showed its indispensability.
However, a minority of strains proved to be particularly
resistant, as up to 20% of the cells recognizable by phase
contrast could not be stained. Of course this raised concerns that such false-negative results could also affect
analyses of clinical samples. We cannot completely rule
out this possibility, but after comprehensive analysis of
many plaque samples we would like to hypothesize that
there are differences in cell wall permeability between
cultured and native lactobacilli and that false-negative
cells are primarily seen after FISH with cultured
lactobacilli.
With cell wall permeability remaining a potential reason for concern, maximum fluorescence intensity from
penetrated probes is essential. Fluorescence intensity
depends on cellular ribosome content, in situ probe
accessibility to the probe target region, and rRNA
stability [25]. Several procedures to maximize the
performance of FISH probes have been described
[15,16,26,27]. They alter the 3-dimensional structure of
the target region by using helper probes, optimize probe
length and hybridization conditions, improve binding
affinity by modifying the probes’ backbone with LNA
substitutions, or inhibit enzymatic rRNA degradation. In
this study we used all four procedures to improve fluorescence intensity of certain probes. For Lfer466,
Lreu986, and Lpla990 one or two helper probes binding
directly adjacent to the target site were added to the
hybridization solution and in each case a clear-cut
improvement of fluorescence intensity was observed.
The same was the case when the LNA-substituted probe
L-Ssob440-2 was compared to Ssob440. For five other
probes the decision to opt for LNA insertions was taken
solely based on own and published experience [25], suggesting limited accessibility of the probes’ target site. All
these LNA/DNA-probes displayed intensive fluorescence, but required strict adherence of very stringent
hybridization conditions for sufficient specificity.

Conclusions
In this study we have described the application of 20
new phylogenetic group- or species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the single-cell detection of oral LAB in
various clinical or experimental biofilms. The results
show that the probes can be used for the rapid identification and quantification of a broad range of LAB for
both research and diagnostic purposes, provided that
restrictions concerning cell permeabilization (lactobacilli), hybridization stringency, fluorescence intensity

Page 10 of 12

optimization, and use of competitor probes are considered. Although designed to cover the diversity of oral
lactobacilli, these probes should prove of value far
beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them
detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of
importance to gastroenterology, gynecology, heart diseases, food industry, etc. Gene sequence typing of isolated strains confirmed the results obtained by analyzing
biofilm samples directly by FISH. On a speculative note,
the apparent correlation between the L. fermentum cell
number and the extent of demineralization seen with
the three samples from the in situ study could indicate
that these bacteria have played a significant role in the
carious process. The abundance of L. fermentum might
be explained by high resistance to low pH giving these
bacteria a selective ecological advantage during the formation of the biofilm.

Methods
Strains, plaque samples and in situ grown biofilms

Lactobacillus reference strains (listed in Table 2) were
grown in 10% CO2 at 37 °C on LBS (Lactobacillus selection) agar and in LBS broth (Becton Dickinson). Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Abiotrophia and Granulicatella
reference strains from the OMZ strain collection were
propagated anaerobically on Columbia blood agar or in
fluid universal medium [28]. They were harvested after
24-36 h during the late log-phase of growth. Supragingival plaque samples and scrapings from the dorsum of
the tongue were collected from two of the authors,
washed in 0.9% NaCl, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/
PBS (20 min, 4 °C), and stored in 50% ethanol at -20 °C.
In situ grown biofilm samples were harvested from
bovine enamel discs (6.8 mm Ø) carried for 10 days and
nights by three volunteers in the course of a doubleblind split-mouth de- and remineralization study carried
out at the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway [18].
The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics
Western Norway approved the study protocol and the
volunteers gave their informed written consent to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria for volunteers
were normal salivary flow and a full dentition without
non-restored caries lesions or evidence of moderate or
severe gingivitis. Antibiotics, mouth rinses or tooth
pastes containing antimicrobial agents (e.g. chlorhexidine, triclosan, SnF2, Zn2+, etc.) or drugs affecting the
salivary flow rate should not have been used for the last
three months. The appliances were kept in 0.9% NaCl
during meals and tooth cleaning; in addition they were
dipped seven times daily for 10 min in 5% glucose/5%
sucrose solution to promote plaque formation. After 10
days in the oral cavity of the volunteers, the discs were
removed from the appliances and the biofilms were harvested by scraping with plastic scalers (ZI 10; Deppeler,

Quevedo et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:14
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/14

Rolle, Switzerland) into approximately 1 ml of sterile
0.9% NaCl as collecting fluid (exact volume determined
for each sample). The samples were frozen at -80 °C
and shipped to Zürich on dry ice for further analyses.
There, freshly defrosted samples were vortexted for
1 min, sonicated for 5 s, aliquoted and assessed by
FISH. Aliquots were also grown at 37 °C anaerobically
and in 10% CO2 on LBS agar (Becton Dickinson) with
the aim to isolate and type representative strains by partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Demineralization of discs
was determined by quantitative light-induced fluorescence as described [29].
Preparation of multi-well slides for FISH

Overnight cultures of lactobacilli (LBS broth) were
washed in 0.9% NaCl, diluted in coating buffer [30],
spotted on 18- or 24-well slides (Cel-Line Associates),
air-dried, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (20
min, 4 °C). Analogously, in situ grown biofilm samples,
supragingival plaque samples and tongue scrapings were
vortexed at maximum speed for 60 s, diluted in coating
buffer and coated to 18- or 24-well slides as described
[30]. To improve cell wall permeability each well
selected for FISH of lactobacilli was treated individually
at room temperature first for 5 min with 9 μl of lysozyme (1 mg ml-1; Sigma-Aldrich L-7651) and achromopeptidase (1 mg ml -1 ; Sigma-Aldrich A-7550) in
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5 mM EDTA, and then for 30
min with 9 μl of lipase (Sigma-Aldrich L-1754; at 25 mg
ml-1 in water the lipase suspension was centrifuged for
5 min at 16’000 × g after which the supernatant was
used). Thereafter, to limit unspecific FISH probe binding
all wells were covered for 30 min at 37 °C with 9 μl of
PBS containing Denhardt’s solution (Fluka 30915;
diluted 1:50) in the presence of protectRNA RNase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich R-7397; diluted 1:500)
[15,16,26,27]. At the end of the respective incubation
periods the solutions were carefully aspirated and the
slides briefly washed in wash-buffer (0.9% NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20, 0.01% NaN3), dipped in water, and air-dried.
All solutions were made with water of nano-pure
quality.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization

The 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes used in
this study are listed in Table 1. Custom-synthesized by
Microsynth, they were labeled at 5’-end with Cy3 or
6-FAM, or in some cases at both ends with 6-FAM.
Probes marked by “L-” in front of the probe name, contain one or two LNA to improve in situ hybridization
efficiency [16]. Probes were designed as described previously [30] using the ARB software [31] with the SILVA
rRNA database [32,33] and additional rRNA sequence
information from ‘The Ribosomal Data Base Project II’

Page 11 of 12

[34,35] and the ‘National Center for Biotechnology Information’ [36]. Probes LGC358a and LAB759 had to be
used in conjunction with a competitor probe to suppress
cross-reactivity with taxa other than lactobacilli and few
probes were used together with helper probes [15] to
improve fluorescence intensity (Table 1). Probes were
used at final concentrations of 5 ng μl-1 (Cy3 conjugates)
or 15 ng μl -1 (FAM conjugates, competitor and helper
probes). EUB338 served as positive control. FISH was
performed as described [30] using hybridization times of
2 or 4 h and probe-specific formamide concentrations as
listed in Table 1. Optimum formamide concentrations
were determined by varying the formamide concentrations systematically between 25% and 55% in FISH
experiments with both reference strains and oral biofilm
samples.
Scoring and enumeration of stained bacteria

Following FISH, air-dried multiwell slides were covered
with mounting fluid (90% glycerol in PBS with
25 mg g-1 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octan) and cover-slips.
Bacteria stained by FISH were enumerated as described
using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope
(Olympus Optical [Schweiz]) [30]. Scoring of fluorescence intensity is described in a footnote to Table 2.
16S rDNA sequencing

Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of five lactobacillus
isolates (OMZ 1117-1121) from the three in situ grown
biofilms were determined as described previously [35].
The sequences of 1393, 1360, 1366, 1371 and 1379 bp
in length were compared to gene bank data of the The
Ribosomal Data Base Project using the Seq Match algorithm [33]. Identification of isolates was based on
≥ 99.5% similarity. The sequences of OMZ 1117 - 1119
were deposited at EMBL with accession numbers
FR667951 - FR667953.
