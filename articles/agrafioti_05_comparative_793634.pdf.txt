Abstract
Background: Protein interaction networks aim to summarize the complex interplay of proteins
in an organism. Early studies suggested that the position of a protein in the network determines its
evolutionary rate but there has been considerable disagreement as to what extent other factors,
such as protein abundance, modify this reported dependence.
Results: We compare the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans with
those of closely related species to elucidate the recent evolutionary history of their respective
protein interaction networks. Interaction and expression data are studied in the light of a detailed
phylogenetic analysis. The underlying network structure is incorporated explicitly into the
statistical analysis. The increased phylogenetic resolution, paired with high-quality interaction data,
allows us to resolve the way in which protein interaction network structure and abundance of
proteins affect the evolutionary rate. We find that expression levels are better predictors of the
evolutionary rate than a protein's connectivity. Detailed analysis of the two organisms also shows
that the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are not sufficiently similar to be mutually
predictive.
Conclusion: It appears that meaningful inferences about the evolution of protein interaction
networks require comparative analysis of reasonably closely related species. The signature of
protein evolution is shaped by a protein's abundance in the organism and its function and the
biological process it is involved in. Its position in the interaction networks and its connectivity may
modulate this but they appear to have only minor influence on a protein's evolutionary rate.

Background
Studies of the evolutionary history of protein interaction
network (PIN) data have produced an almost bewildering
range of (partially) contradictory results [1-6,8-12]. While
PIN data is notoriously prone to false positive and nega-

tive results [5,13], reasons for disagreements are probably
more diverse than just the quality of the interaction data.
Failure to account for protein abundance – as measured
by gene expression levels, or by proxy, the codon-adaptation index – has been criticized [3]; the choice of species

for comparative analysis will also affect any evolutionary
inferences as shown by Hahn et al. [12]. This may either
be due to loss of power (e.g. fewer reliably identified
orthologues between more distantly related species) or to
differences in underlying PINs in distantly related species.
Below, for example, we will show that results obtained
from a comparison between the two hemiascomycetes
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans differ considerably from those obtained using a distant S. cerevisiae –
Caenorhabditis elegans comparison. Finally, it has recently
been shown that many studies may have suffered from the
fact that present network data, and this is in particular true
for PINs, are random samples from much larger networks.
Unless these subnets are adequate representations of the
overall network, their structural properties (such as node
connectivity) may differ quite substantially from that of
the nodes in the global network. This is, for example, the
case for so-called scale-free network models [14].
Moreover, many studies have ignored the underlying network structure [15] in the statistical analysis. The network,
however, introduces dependencies between connected
proteins which should not be ignored. Fraser et al. [2] for
example find that (i) there is a negative correlation
between a protein's evolutionary rate and its connectivity
k (the number of its interactions), (ii) connected proteins
have positively correlated evolutionary rates, and (iii)
connected proteins do not have correlated connectivities.
All three statements cannot, of course, be strongly true
simultaneously. Here we observe only relatively weak –
though statistically significant – correlations between connectivity and evolutionary rate. We will argue that in a
regression framework [16] some of these quantities contain very little information indeed about the corresponding properties of their interaction partners. Furthermore,
we will demonstrate that when analyzing network data
the network structure must be included into the analysis
from the outset. Here we will first perform an evolutionary analysis of the yeast and nematode PIN data available
in the DIP database [7], a hand-curated dataset combining
information from a wide range of sources, followed by a
comparison of the two datasets. When making comparisons between yeast species and between nematode species, we use only a single PIN dataset – for S. cerevisiae and
C. elegans, respectively – and take comfort from the observation of Hahn et al. [12] who find that evolutionary analysis involving closely related reference taxa produces
consistent results. Previously, topological comparisons of
biological network data from different species have been
made [17] but here we focus on shared evolutionary characteristics of PINs in the two species. We would expect at
least some level of similarity of biological networks
between species; but the more distantly related two organisms are, the more changes can have accumulated in their
respective molecular networks. Thus, the depth of the

phylogeny can affect the evolutionary analysis of PINs; it
is, for example, unlikely that PINs have been conserved
over large evolutionary time-scales.

Results
Evolutionary analysis of the S. cerevisiae PIN
For the evolutionary analysis of the yeast PIN we use a
panel of related yeast species: Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces casteliii, Saccharomyces
kluyveri, C. albicans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (see
Methods section); the evolutionary relationship between
these species is shown in figure 1. We thus focus on relatively recent evolutionary change which allows us to study
the effects of the network structure on the rate of evolution more directly than e.g. distant comparisons of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, which may, after all, have different
PINs.
Connectivity, expression and evolutionary rates in the S.
cerevisiae PIN
For most protein sequences we have not been able to
identify orthologues in all yeast species used in this analysis. We therefore defined the averaged relative evolutionary rate R (see Eqn. (1) in the Methods section) which
allows us to make comparisons for 4124 out of the 4773
yeast genes for which we have interaction data.

we observe that comparisons with all species support this
notion We furthermore estimated approximate confidence intervals for τ from 1000 bootstrap replicates [18]
(shown in table 1).
Observed negative correlations between estimated evolutionary rates and the expression level – which have been
reported previously by Pal et al. [19] – are more pronounced. Equally, k, the number of a protein's interactions, and expression levels are also correlated (τ = 0.09).
There has been considerable controversy as to whether the
effect of a protein's connectivity can be studied independently of expression levels (see e.g. [3,4]). The observed values of τ suggest that expression levels are better predictors
of the evolutionary rate than are connectivities. Calculating partial rank correlation coefficients, τp, provides further evidence for this: correcting for expression reduces
the correlation between the evolutionary rate R (or any of
the individual rates) and the number of interactions, as is
apparent from figure 3. As the phylogenetic distance
between species increases, the negative partial correlation
between evolutionary rate and connectivity decreases
compared to the uncorrected rank correlation measure τ.
In the supplementary tables S1-S3 [see Additional file 1]
we show the evolutionary rates for the different functional
categories, processes and cellular compartments (taken
from Gene Ontology (GO) [20]. Interestingly, once the
effects of expression and protein function on the estimated evolutionary rate are taken into account the
dependence of the latter on connectivity in a generalized
linear regression model [16] (where we log-transformed
the expression level to obtain an approximately normal
distribution) is considerably reduced. This can be assessed
formally using the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
[21] on the sub-models where one of the terms has been

dropped (see methods). For the full model we obtain AIC
= -407.4. Dropping expression from the model results in
AIC = -196.9, indicating that a substantial amount of
information about the evolutionary rate is contained in
the expression levels. Dropping the other terms individually while retaining the rest results in: AIC = -392.9 if the
connectivity is dropped from the statistical model, and
AIC = -352.6 (process), -250.1 (function) and -392.7
(compartment). We thus have the following order of statistically inferred impact on the evolutionary rate (with a
slight abuse of the notation): expression>function>process>connectivity≈compartment. Using the rates obtained
from comparisons with the individual species results in
the same ordering.
Evolution of interacting proteins in S. cerevisiae
So far we have treated nodes/proteins as independent
(using only their connectivities in the analysis) but we will
now consider the extent to which interactions introduce
dependencies into the data. It is intuitively plausible that
interacting proteins have similar evolutionary rates, and
this has indeed been reported by Fraser et al. [2,22] and
studied by others, too, e.g. [3,12]. Just like them we find
that evolutionary rate decreases with connectivity; we also
observe that the connectivities of interacting proteins are
anti-correlated in yeast (τ ≈ -0.03 with p < 10-8). This is
well explained from the statistical theory of networks
[14,23], as well as structural analyses of PIN data, where it
is found that highly connected proteins form hubs which
connect sparsely connected proteins.

Taken together this would mean that the evolutionary
rates of connected proteins should also be anti-correlated.
This is, however, not the case when we look at the yeast
PIN, where we find that evolutionary rates of interacting
proteins are positively correlated as measured by Kendall's

Correlation, even partial correlation, may, however, be an
inadequate statistical measure if the data is structured (as
in a network); one should then rather focus on the power
of a factor such as expression level or connectivity to predict evolutionary rates. We assess this formally through
the use of statistical regression models which describe the
evolutionary rate of one protein as a function of the rate
of its interacting partner, as well as of its expression level,
number of interactions, function, process and cell compartment. The AIC, which for the full model is AIC = 2397.6, allows us to order the factors by the information
they contain about a protein's evolutionary rate. The order
(and the respective AIC value on dropping the factor from
the model) is as follows: Expression (AIC = -1399.6),
function (AIC = -1445.9), process (AIC = -1956.6), cellular compartment (AIC = -2226.6), connectivity (AIC = 2316.8), and the rate of one of its interaction partners
(AIC = -2397.0). Note that, measured by the AIC, the evolutionary rate of an interaction partner provides virtually
no additional information about a protein's own evolutionary rate, once the protein's own expression level, function and process have been taken into account.

-0.017]. Anti-correlation between the CAI measure of
expression and evolutionary rates is again much more
pronounced with τ ≈ -0.30 and approximate bootstrap CIs
of [-0.333, -0.264]. The resulting scatter plots of rate vs.
connectivity and rate vs. CAI are shown in figure 5.

Thus, in summary, we observe that the evolutionary rate
of yeast proteins is inversely related both to their connectivity in the PIN and to their expression levels, with
expression levels having a greater impact on a protein's
evolutionary rate than connectivities. Finally, while there
is statistically significant correlation between the rates of
interacting proteins, the rate of one interaction partner
carries very little information about the rate of the other
protein if other factors are taken into account.

Evolution of interacting proteins in C. elegans
Comparing properties of interacting proteins we again
find a negative correlation between their respective connectivities (τ = -0.07) and a weaker positive correlation
between their evolutionary rates (τ = 0.03).

Evolutionary analysis of the C. elegans PIN
In the evolutionary analysis of C. elegans we use C.
briggsae, the only other congeneric nematode for which
high quality whole-genome data is available. Since nematodes are multicellular, care has to be taken when
analysing the effects of gene expression on evolutionary
rate, as expression levels will vary considerably between
tissues and, indeed, between different stages of the nematode life cycle. Because codon usage bias as a selective
response increasing translational efficiency should be
driven by the overall expression level of a protein integrated over both tissue and time, the codon-adaptation
index (CAI; see Methods and [24]) can serve as a meaningful averaged quantity reflecting overall integrated expression levels better than a direct measurement of mRNA
expression level data obtained from any single tissue type.
Connectivity, expression and evolutionary rates in the C.
elegans PIN
The correlation of evolutionary rate and connectivity is
somewhat reduced compared to S. cerevisiae with a point
estimate of τ = -0.05 with a 95% bootstrap CI of [-0.097,

Partial correlation coefficients again show that the influence of expression is greater than that of connectivity: τp ≈
-0.03 for the partial correlation measure between rate and
connectivity, while τp ≈ -0.30 if the correlation between
expression (CAI) and rate is corrected for connectivity.
This is confirmed by performing an ANOVA [25] on the
regression between rate, CAI and connectivity where no
significant correlation can be found between rate and connectivity (p ≈ 0.62). Generalized linear regression modelling shows that measured by the AIC a model in which the
rate depends only on the CAI but not on the connectivity
(AIC = -660.5) is more powerful than a model in which
the rate depends on both connectivity and CAI (AIC = 618.4). In the absence of extensive GO data we find that
the CAI is the only statistically significant predictor for a
protein's evolutionary rate.

The corresponding 95% bootstrap CI for τ does, however,
include 0 and negative values; thus there is no statistical
basis for concluding that evolutionary rates of interacting
proteins are correlated in C. elegans even if we consider
only the rank correlation measure. In figure 6 the
distribution of τ under the correct Null model (see methods) confirms this result as the observed correlation
between the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins falls
into the 95% confidence interval obtained from the Null
model. Expression levels are, however, significantly correlated and connectivities remain significantly anti-correlated. Regression models, equivalent to those performed
for yeast, confirm the negligible information a protein's
evolutionary rate contains about the evolutionary rate of
an interacting protein.
In summary, for C. elegans we find that expression, even if
measured indirectly through the CAI, is a better predictor
about a protein's evolutionary rate than connectivity and
GO classifications. The evolutionary rates of connected
proteins do not appear to be correlated.
Comparing the PINs of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans
It is instructive to compare the PINs of the two model
organisms, yeast and worm, directly. We have therefore
used our earlier approach of identifying and analysing

Although they essentially agree with the earlier results,
they do suggest that the choice of species used for inferring the evolutionary rate can influence the analysis. For
example, the partial correlation between interaction and
evolutionary rate (calculated directly from the S. cerevisiae
– C. elegans amino acid sequence comparison) accounting
for expression is much less reduced compared with the
simple correlation coefficient (τp = -0.20 in S. cerevisiae,
and τp = -0.10 in C. elegans) than when evolutionary rates
are calculated using more closely related target species.
Over long evolutionary distances it appears as if
connectivity and expression level act almost independently. However, the more reliable comparisons of the previous section suggest that this is not the case.
Comparing properties of orthologous proteins we find
that their expression levels (using the CAI as a proxy in C.
elegans) show the strongest correlation while their
respective PIN connectivities show the lowest value for
Kendall's τ statistic. This may be due to the noise in the
PIN data or the incomplete nature of present PIN data
sets. We expect that the relatively small proportion of C.

elegans proteins included in the DIP database will also
lead to an inaccurate representation of the C. elegans PIN.

Discussion
There are considerable differences between the various
published studies [2-4,12], both in terms of protein interaction data and phylogenetic comparisons. We therefore
focus on closely related species for both S. cerevisiae and
C. elegans in the evolutionary analysis, since we probably
have to assume that the underlying PIN is relatively more
conserved over short evolutionary distances. While we
found some evidence that highly connected proteins
evolve more slowly than sparsely connected proteins, (i)
the negative correlation between rate and expression level
is more pronounced, (ii) in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans connectivity turns out to be a worse statistical predictor of the
evolutionary rate than expression. For S. cerevisiae we also
find that protein function and the principal biological
process a protein is involved in have a greater impact on
the evolutionary rate of a protein than its connectivity.
We believe that the importance of expression over connectivity in determining the evolutionary rate may be due to
three factors. First, highly abundant genes are perhaps
more visible to purifying selection [26], which might tend
to lower the rate at which they evolve. Second, and more
importantly, highly expressed genes, which are under
selection for translational efficiency, use only a small subset of the cognate codons for a particular amino acid (this,
incidentally, is exploited in the construction of the CAI),
and because this subset is often the same even in
phylogenetically remote organisms – for example, for
those amino acids encoded by nnU and nnC (e.g. phenylalanine or cysteine), nnC is almost universally preferred
– the silent substitution rate is reduced. Third, the replacement substitution rate in highly expressed proteins should
also be reduced for a similar reason to selection for trans-

lational efficiency at silent sites: selection for more
cheaply synthesised amino acids at replacement sites [27].
This can be shown to lead to the avoidance of amino acids
which are metabolically expensive to synthesise at functionally-unconstrained sites in highly expressed proteins,
which reduces the set of acceptable amino acids at such
sites and thereby lowers the replacement substitution rate
compared with that at functionally-unconstrained sites in
low expression proteins [28].
We have also applied an improved resampling procedure
to the analysis of correlation between rates and expression
levels of connected proteins. In our analysis we treated
properties of the network as a confounding variable and
in addition to studying correlations we also show how
informative properties of one protein are about properties
of its interaction partners. We find that the correct procedure broadens the resampling confidence intervals but
that expression levels of interacting proteins remain considerably closer than would be expected by chance.
Conversely we found no evidence of a correlation in the
evolutionary rate of interacting proteins in C. elegans and
only extremely weak evidence in S. cerevisiae. Our results
also suggest, that the evolution of interacting proteins is
not as tightly correlated as some researchers have proposed. This level of disagreement may be caused by uncertainties in the data or the fact that subnets sampled from
larger networks inaccurately reflect the properties of the
true network [29].

Conclusion
We believe that the effects of the network structure on the
evolution of proteins, and vice versa, is much more subtle
than has previously been suggested. In the present dataset
expression levels appear to have shaped a protein's
evolutionary rate more than its connectivity. If we are
happy to accept present PIN data with the necessary caution, then this observation is consistent with a scenario
where expression levels are more conserved between species than are details of the interaction network. Nevertheless, we believe that it is important to consider the PIN
and a protein's connectivity explicitly and from the outset
in any statistical analysis as the underlying network
appears to act as a confounding factor.

Methods
Data
Protein interaction data
The names and sequences for proteins with known interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis
elegans were retrieved from the Database of Interacting
Proteins (DIP) on the 5th of July [7]. The database mainly
contains information extracted from the research literature, but recently the database was enriched with information obtained by analysing structures of protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/23

complexes deposited in PDB [30]. We have data for 4773
yeast proteins (comprising 15461 interactions) and 2386
nematode proteins (with 7221 interactions). While there
have been recent attempts at quantifying levels of
confidence in given protein interactions these generally
lead to substantial decreases in sample size. For this reason we have therefore chosen to take the PIN data as it is
deposited in the hand-curated DIP database (we have also
performed analyses with such restricted subsets which
agree with the results presented here).
Protein sequence data
In addition to S. cerevisiae sequences downloaded from
the DIP, publicly available protein sequences of six other
yeast species were investigated: Saccharomyces pombe [31],
Candida albicans [32], Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces kluyveri and Saccharomyces castellii [33]. Genomic protein sequences for only one other
Caenorhabditis species apart from C. elegans are publicly
available, C. briggsae [34]. All sequence files were
converted to searchable indexed databases; these are available from the authors.
Expression data
S. cerevisiae expression data came from Cho et al. [35] who
characterised all mRNA transcript levels during the cell
cycle of S. cerevisiae. mRNA levels were measured at 17
time points at 10 min intervals, covering nearly two full
cell cycles [36]. The mean of these 17 numbers was taken
to produce one general time-averaged expression level for
each protein.

C. elegans is a multicellular organism in which different
cells have different functions. This means that different
proteins have different expression levels in different cells,
which are present in different numbers, so taking a simple
mean of the expression levels in a single cell type would
be meaningless. In addition, C. elegans has a complex lifecycle, with different proteins being expressed in different
stages of that cycle. Thus, an alternative way of calculating
a single expression level for each protein had to be used.
It has long been known that highly expressed genes tend
to use only a limited number of codons thus displaying
high codon bias. Sharp and Li [24] devised a measure for
assessing the degree of deviation from a preferred pattern
of usage estimated from the clustering of codon usage
across proteins, which they called the Codon Adaptation
Index (CAI). We adopt this measure as our expression
level proxy.
Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
The close relationship between the species considered
here, apart from the distant comparison between S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, makes identification of orthologues

relatively straightforward. Orthologous protein sequences
were detected by reciprocal BLAST searches in the standard way. Multiple alignments of inferred orthologues were
obtained using ClustalW.

The AIC (and related approaches [21]) aims to identify a
statistical model that offers the most efficient description
of the data (in an information theoretic sense) from a set
of trial models.

Evolutionary rates were obtained using PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) [37]. We used
both the observed fraction of amino acid differences,
referred to by M1, B1,... (where the letters refer to different
species, see footnote to Table 1), and the distance related
measure calculated from the trees inferred by PAML,
referred to by M2, B2, .... Both rates are highly correlated
τ ≈ 0.9. In order to estimate the latter rate the phylogeny
had to be reconstructed. Inferred phylogenies were
assessed for their agreement with the commonly accepted
family tree of yeast species (see figure 1; we found excellent agreement among the inferred trees assessed using the
clann software package [38]) and the widely accepted phylogenies for the yeast and nematode species, which are
shown in figure 1. For further analyses we chose to use the
maximum likelihood rate.

We explicitly incorporated the network structure into the
statistical analysis. This is necessary if there is reason to
believe that properties of the network may determine
aspects of the evolutionary history, for example when we
want to test if the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are correlated. Here we use resampling or bootstrap
procedures [18] to determine if properties (e.g. expression
levels, evolutionary rates, connectivities) of interacting
proteins are more similar than would be expected to occur
by chance. If instead we had paired proteins completely at
random we would potentially have masked confounding
effects due to the network (for example if expression
depends strongly on a protein's network properties, i.e.
connectivity). In our network-aware resampling procedure we therefore pick each protein with a probability that
is proportional to its number of interaction partners. Each
bootstrap replicate is thus also a sample with the correct
nodal properties and (statistically) the same degree distribution as the true network. In the structural analysis of
networks the need to account for network properties in
the construction of the correct Null model has long been
realized [14,17] but this is, to our knowledge, the first
time that such a topologically correct Null model has been
applied to the evolutionary analysis of network data. As
an illustration figure 7 shows the bootstrap distribution of
correlation coefficients of expression levels in yeast for the
correct Null model and for the model where proteins are
paired completely at random. Ignoring the correlation of
the data introduced by the underlying network structure
reduces the bootstrap confidence intervals considerably
(we find that the two-sided 95% CIs are reduced by
approximately 20% compared to the network aware bootstrap replicate). This mirrors the effects observed in population and evolutionary genetics where the underlying
genealogy/phylogeny increases the CIs compared to the
case of truly independent observations.

Statistical analysis
In order to be able to compare evolutionary rates for as
many proteins as possible we defined the averaged relative evolutionary rate of each protein i via
Ri =

1
vi

∑

s∈{all species}
a

[ evol. rate of protein i form comparison with species s ]
[ Avg. evol. rate in species s across all proteins ]

(1)

where vi is the number of comparisons from which an evolutionary rate can be estimated.
We generally found that analysis of the dependence of R =
{R1, R2, ..Rn} on the number of interactions etc. behaved
similarly to analysis of the species specific rates. We used
ANOVA [25] and partial correlation coefficients to study
the impact the different factors had on the evolutionary
rates. All analyses were performed using the R statistical
environment and the NetZ package (available from the
authors). In order to investigate the relative influence of
the various factors (number of interactions, expression
levels, GO-data [20]) we used linear and generalized linear regression modelling (implemented in R). The Akaike
information criterion (AIC) [16,21] was used to distinguish among the different nested submodels of the full
model. The model which has the smallest AIC (defined as
2(-1 k(θ) + 2v) where 1 k(θ) is the log-likelihood of a –
potentially vector-valued – parameter θ, and v is the
number of parameters) is the model which offers the best
(in an information sense [21]) description of the data. The
full model included the number of interactions, expression levels (or CAI in the case of C. elegans) and GO-data
as explanatory variables. When comparing evolutionary
rates of interacting proteins the evolutionary rate at the
interacting protein was added as an explanatory variable.

Routines used to perform the statistical analysis of the network data are collected in the NetZ package which can be
obtained from the corresponding author.

Including the network structure into the bootstrap procedure leads to a broader distribution.
