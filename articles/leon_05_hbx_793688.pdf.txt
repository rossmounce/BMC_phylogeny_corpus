Abstract
Background: Around 400 million people worldwide are chronically infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). An
estimated 10% of these chronic patients develop progressive liver damage including cirrhosis and Hepatocellular
Carcinoma (HCC). The HBx gene encodes a protein of 154 amino acids which is a transactivator and has been
associated with HBV pathogenesis. A change in the amino acid sequences at positions 130 and 131 in the HBV-X
protein (M130K and V131I) produced by T-A point mutations at the nucleic acids level has been associated with
severe liver damage and HCC in patients from China and Africa. Further, such changes have been proposed as a
prognostic marker for progressive liver damage and HCC. The purpose of this study was to determine if T-A
mutations are present in HBV chronic carriers with genotype F (the major genotype in Costa Rica) and further,
if these mutations are associated with HBV disease progression in Costa Rica HBV patients from 1972 to 1985.
Results: Serum samples from 50 HBV positive individuals were amplified and directly sequenced, 48 belonged to
genotype F, 1 from genotype D and another was classified as D or E.
T-;A mutations were absent in 17 acute patients who recovered, but was present in 12 of 29 chronic carrier
samples (42.8%), in one sample the T-A mutations were detected as early as 29 days after clinical onset of disease.
In 17 carriers with available liver biopsies, T-;A mutations were found in 8 sera of 13 (61.5%) classified as
moderate or severe, and none in 4 biopsies with mild liver damage. However, it was not possible to demonstrate
a statistical association between the presence of T-A mutations and moderate/severe liver damage, using a Fischer
exact test, 1 tail, p = 0.05.
In 4 patients HCC was diagnosed, and 2 of them presented the T-A mutations in their sera.
Conclusion: T-A mutations were found in HBV genotype F in chronic carriers but not in patients who recovered
from acute infection. These mutations could be developing early during infection although the possibility of
infection with the mutant virus could not be excluded.
More studies are necessary to establish if the T-A mutation can be used as a prognostic marker for severity of
liver disease in patients infected with HBV.

chronic patients from China [11,12] and Africa [13]. In
East Asia where genotype C is the most common genotype, it has been reported that the T-A mutation occurs
more frequently in relation to this genotype [14]. HBV is
classified worldwide into eight genotypes designated A to
H, with a specific geographical distribution [15-17].

Background
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small double stranded
DNA virus that produces a chronic infection in 2–10% of
adults and in approximately 90% of infected infants.
Approximately 10% of these chronic patients develop
progressive liver damage including cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)[1]. The mechanism by which
HBV progression to liver cirrhosis and/or HCC occurs is
not clear, however many studies suggest that the X protein
(HBx) is related to this process. HBx has been associated
with a variety of biological functions. As a transcriptional
transactivator, it can regulate transcription of a wide diversity of viral and cellular promoters [2,3]. HBx overlaps
with regions of crucial importance for viral replication
such as: the direct repeat sequences DR1 and DR2, the
preC/C gene promoter and the enhancer II region. There
are controversial results about the consequence of mutations in this region and its relationship with pathogenesis.
A study carried out in Korea determined that mutations in
the core promoter have little effect on viral load and the
HBeAg status [4]. In contrast, another study points out
that changes in HBx especially in the core promoter region
may alter HBV gene expression [5]. Among other alterations observed in the HBx gene are deletions and one of
the most common is the 8 bp deletion between nucleotides 1763–1770 [6], which has been described to
decrease the virus replication [7,8]. These deletions in
HBx as in other HBV genes have also been related to development of cirrhosis in long term renal transplant patients
[9].

Genotype F has been described as the HBV genotype of
the Amerindians. In Central America a study determined
79% of samples belong to genotype F [18] and in Costa
Rica genotype F is the most common, while the overall
prevalence of HBV is considered low (0.5 – 1%).
From 1972 to 1985 a study on the natural history of HBV
was done in San Ramón and Palmares, two adjacent Costa
Rican counties [19]. In this study 488 cases of HBV were
diagnosed, 80% with an age range between 5 and 40
years. In the group ≤ 5 years old 33% became chronic carriers and in the group > 5 years only 4.7% did. The 77.7%
cases were primary HBV infections and the rest were due
to household contacts. The purpose of this study was to
analyze the presence of T-A mutations in the HBx gene for
this population; the time which at they occur and if they
are related to hepatic injure. Furthermore, the presence of
other mutations in this gene were also observed

Results

Natural mutations in the HBx gene have been related to
progression to chronic disease as a consequence of the
rescission of anti proliferative and apoptotic effects, which
might produce uncontrolled growth and contribute to
multistep hepatocarcinogenesis [10].

PCR detection rate
Of the 77 selected samples, 18 were from group A, 14
from group B and 45 from group C; overall, 50 samples
(64.9%) could be amplified and sequenced. Of these fifty,
17 (94.4%) were from group A (recovered patients), 12
(85.7%) from group B (paired samples – known onset),
and 21(46.6%) from group C (chronic patient with
unknown onset). The sensitivity of the nested PCR was
8000 copies/ml.

A double point mutation with a transversion nucleotide
from adenine to thymine at nucleotide 1762, K130M with
a transition from adenine to guanine at position 1764
V131I (T-A mutations), has been found more frequently
in patients with hepatic tumors than in asymptomatic

T-A mutations were present in chronic HBV carriers but
not in acute recovered patients
Table 1 shows the mutation rate of T-A in HBx for M130K
and V131I amongst the three study groups. The T-A mutations were not present in any of the 17 sequences from

group A, where the average days in which samples were
taken was 17 days ranging from 3–33 days. Of 8 chronic
patients in group B, the T-A mutations were identified in
5 (62.5%) of the sequenced samples and V131I alone was
detected in two. In one of the patients, T-A mutations were
detected at day 29 after clinical onset. Four patients were
not considered in the distribution of T-A mutations, since
the follow-up samples could not be amplified. From
group C the T-A mutations were detected in 7 of the 21
sequenced samples, and V131I alone in 3 samples.

Of the 5 carriers with biopsy classified as KI ≤ 2, one sample had an 8 bp deletion that included the T-A mutations
site and another sample the V131I mutation alone. In the
group with KI > 2 points (moderate/severe) T-A mutations
were present in 8 (61.5%) of the sequenced samples
(Table 2).

Biopsy results and T-A mutations distribution
Of the 29 chronic carrier samples from groups B and C
sequenced during the chronic phase, 18 patients had a
liver biopsy characterized using the Knodell Index (KI).
Five (26%) patients had a KI ≤ 2 points, (mild liver lesions
with fatty deposits), 9 (47%) had KI between 3 and 4
points (moderate lesions) and 4 (21%) had a KI > 4
points (severe lesions). These are shown in fig. 1a, 1b and
1c respectively.

According with statistics of the Costa Rican National
Tumor Registry (NTR), four patients included in this study
died from HCC during the last 2 decades and two of these
had the presence of T-A mutations.

Mutations observed in HBV acute infected patients that
recovered versus chronic carriers
The percentage of the most frequent polymorphism
found in the study as well as the consensus sequences of
each of the population selected for statistical analysis are
shown in Table 4. Group A presented more amino acid or
nucleotide variability than the other groups, however, in
acute phase samples from group B, 50% of these had common mutations at position 12 (T12A).
Samples Genotype
Of the total 50 samples sequenced ; 48 belonged to genotype F, one sample belonged to genotype D subtype adw,
and the other to subtype ay, which was classified as genotype E by a web-based genotyping tool and as D by phylogenetic tree analysis (data not shown).

T-A mutations were not found in any of 17 samples from
HBV patients who had recovered; a similar result had been
obtained in a study with self-limited acute hepatitis [20].
However, another study showed T-A mutations during the
acute phase in one out of 11 from genotype A, none of the
5 patients from genotype B and 4 out of 27 from genotype
C [21]. The significance of this finding needs to be further
studied.
T-A mutations were found in 12 (41.3%) of 29 samples
from chronic carriers. In one carrier the mutations were
detected 29 days after onset, with the probability that this
carrier could have been directly infected with HBV containing the T-A mutations. In the 23 acute phase samples,
T-A mutations were not detected and therefore the possibility to have an initial infection with T-A in other populations appears to be low. However, Kobayashi et al, has
shown in their study a higher prevalence of the T-A mutations in chronic patients during the acute phase than in
acute self limited HBV infection in patients infected with
genotypes C, A and B [21].
In chronic carriers, with a liver biopsy classified as moderate or severe, T-A mutations were present in 61.5% (8/13)
and none in 4 biopsies classified as mild. However this
result was not statistically significant based on the Fisher
exact test, 1 tail, p = 0.05, probably due to the small sample size in the groups. Other studies have shown a better
correlation between the presence of T-A mutations and
patients with fulminant hepatitis, severe exacerbation
[20] or liver cirrhosis [22] especially with genotypes A or
C when compared with asymptomatic carriers [12-14]. In
agreement with the literature T-A mutations seem to

leucine in the 131 site and a stop codon in the
position135.

In this study, V131I also occurred alone in 5 samples
(17%) of the 29 chronic patients; this event has been commonly reported by others [6,14,25,27,28]; nevertheless
M130K alone is very unusual. It has been described in 1 of
12 fulminant hepatitis patients [20] and in 1 genotype B
strain [27]. In one of the paired samples from this study
and in another from reference [6], the V131I mutation
appears in time before the methionine change at position
130.

The polymorphic differences observed between the
sequence of acute HBV recovered patients and chronic carriers are related to the genetic diversity of strain more than
the study group classification (A,B,C). All sequences isolated in this study belong to genotype F with the exception
of 2. Using blast searches sequences from genotype F can
be divided in AY090455 – 1889 NIC sequences similar to
those which are related to South American sequences and
the AY090456- 1980HCR sequences similar to those
which are related to Central America sequences. The polymorphism observed in the nucleotides as well as the
amino acids in these groups may be due to a variability
present in the group related to the South American
sequences.

In a Korean study T-A mutations were found in 32% (13/
41) of HBV carriers, and a triple mutation G1714A,
C1718T, A1721G was found in 27% (11/41) patients [4].
In our study wild type (wt) HBV strain nucleotide were
found in the 1714 and 1718 positions, but the mutation
A1721G was found in genotype F samples and not in two
samples with other genotypes. Again, T-A mutations are
common in all genotypes while other mutations seem to
be more related to specific genotypes.
No association could be established between the presence
of T-A mutations and HBeAg status (Table 3), similar to
other published data [4,24]. Of the four samples with the
8 bp deletion only (467 and 6516), two were re-amplified
from the PCR1 product and corroborated by enzyme
restriction digestion, which demonstrates that the deletion was not a PCR artifact. This 8 bp deletion in the T-A
site has been reported previously [6,8,9,27,29] and it has
been associated with a low viral load [7,8,29]. Different
clones isolated from several patients showed a heterogeneous population of strains including T-A mutations, wt
strains as well as the 8 bp deletion. This could be a possible reason why we observed different results in amplified
samples of the initial PCR products with an 8 deletion
than in the reanalyzed two samples where the deletion
was not detected.
An interesting fact is that these deletions alter the X open
reading frame, changing K130N and introducing an iso-

Many efforts have been made in order to clarify the role of
viral variants in the pathogenesis of HBV infection; and
still there is no final consensus. T-A mutations have been
proposed as possible prognostic markers for liver disease
progression [14] however, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of the T-A mutations and its relation to
HBV diversity and disease outcome.

Conclusion
According to our results, T-A mutations were frequently
observed in HBV chronic carriers, but were not found in
acute recovered patients.
T-A mutations are frequent in all genotypes while other
mutations seem to be more related to specific genotypes.
T-A mutations may appear early during HBV infection
although the possibility of initial infection cannot be
excluded.

Biopsy classification Pathology
The inflammatory activity of Knodell in Chronic Persistent Hepatitis (CPH) between 1 and 2 points, is represented by a uniform and diffuse cobblestone arrangement
of swollen hepatocytes, with compressed sinusoids; some
of which show Hadziyannis cells containing abundant
HBsAg.

conditions for the second round were 94°C for 3 min, 40
cycles to 94°C for 0.40 min, 55°C for 0.40 min and 72°C
for 1.30 min. The final extension was 72°C for 4 min.

Lobular Chronic Hepatitis (LCH) is between 2 and 6
points with an intact lobular architecture, perivenular cell
swelling, focal hepatocytolysis and a variable degree of
inflammatory activity [32]. Further, these lesions are characterized by focal necrosis, abnormal hepatocytes and
scattered passive fibrous interportal bridges.

Dilutions of 1:10 of a commercial CPG® DNA plasmid
with 105copies/µl of the total HBV genome were prepared
and used as control as well as to determine the limit detection (sensitivity) of the PCR system.

In this study the Knodell Index (KI) was used as follows:
≤ 2 points was considered mild liver lesion, 3 and 4 moderate and > 4 as severe liver damage.
PCR Methods
Primers were chosen from conserved regions of the following HBV genotypes sequence obtained from GenBank.
Genotype A subtype adw2 (AF297625) and (AF373066),
genotype B (AF121243), genotype C subtype adr
(AB033550), subtype adw (AB033557), genotype D subtype ayw (AF280817), genotype E (AB032431), genotype
F (AB036919), genotype G (AB064310) and (AF160501).

Outer primers selected were: sense (1182–1200)
5'GTTTGCTGACGCAACCCCC3' and the antisense
5'CAATGTCCATGCCCCAAAGC3' (1891–1910). The
expected amplified product size was 728 bp. Inner primers: sense 5'GATCCATACTGCGGAACTCC3' (1263–
1282) and antisense 5'AGCTTGGAGGCTTGAACAGT3'
(1859–1878).
Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 µl of serum using
the QIAamp DNA mini Kits (Qiagen® U.S.A.) according to
manufacturer's instructions.
Nested PCR was performed using a thermocycler (PerkinElmer).
For the first PCR, 10 µl of the extracted product were
added to a total of 50 µl of reaction volume containing 2.5
units of Taq (Promega® 5 units/µl), 3.5 mM of MgCl2,
0.092 nmoles/µl of primers final concentration, 0.4
mmolar/µl of each dNTP. This amplification was performed at 94°C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles at 94°C
for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, with a final
extension of 4 min to 72°C.
For the nested PCR, 5 µl of product from the first PCR
were added to 50 µl of reaction, with a final concentration
of MgCl2, 2.5 mM and 0.080 nM of primers. Cycling

Nested products with a size of 616 bp were corroborated
by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium
bromide.

Sequencing conditions
Nested PCR product (616 bp) was run on 1% agarose gels
and the expected band was cut and purified by a Qiagen
column system following manufacturer's instructions.

An Open Gene™ sequencer system (Visible Genetics) was
used. For sequencing the following primers were labeled
with cy 5.0 and cy 5.5 dyes: Sense 5' 5cy55
GTTTYGCTCGCAGCMGGTC3' y = c/t, m = c/a (1292–
1310)
and
antisense
5'-5cy5
CTTGAACGATRGGACATGAAC3' R = a/g (1848–1868).
Primers were diluted to a concentration of 3 pM in TE
buffer. All reagents were used according to manufacturer's
instructions. The first denaturation step was at 94°C for
2:30 min followed by 35 cycles of 0:30 min at 94°C, 0:30
min at 50°C, 1 min at 70°C and a final extension step at
72°C for 7 min. Finally, 1.5 µl of each sample was run in
a polyacrylamide gel at 1500 volts for 90 min.
A consensus sequence of the genotype F strain (NCBI
AB036919, AB036905, X75658) was used as our wild type
sequence.
Genotype sequencing
The HBx gene sequences were compared with homologue
sequences obtained from the GeneBank data base using
the BLAST program [33]. The genotype was determined
using a web- based genotyping tool for viral sequences
[34]. The subtype of some of the samples was determined
previously by specific antibodies available in our
laboratory.
Restriction Enzyme digestion
In order to corroborate an 8 bp deletion observed in some
sequences, a restriction enzyme SspI was used (New England, BioLabs INC,). As a positive control a sample from
HIV having the same recognition site was used and a HBx
sample with the wild type sequence was employed as a
negative control. Ten µl of each purified product from the
nested PCR were dispensed into two different vials of 200
µl. In one vial 1 µl of SspI enzyme (5000 units/ml), 2 µl

of enzyme buffer (New England, BioLabs INC,) and 7 µl of
water were added; while in the other vial the enzyme was
omitted. All samples were heated at 37°C for 90 minutes
and run in a 3% agarose gel. Results were visualized with
ethidium bromide.
Statistical analysis
The Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the relationship between two discrete and dichotomy variables. The t
test, for independent samples, was used to analyze continuous variables when it was necessary. A new dichotomy
variable for hepatic damage was built into biopsy results
and using data from the Costa Rican National Tumor
Registry (NTR); by division into "mild damage" and
"moderate/severe damage". The relative risk (RR) was calculated with a 95% confidence interval. All analyzes were
done with the JMP 4 software version 4.0.4 A BUSINESS
