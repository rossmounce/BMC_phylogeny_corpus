have so far relied mostly on detecting locally conserved motifs
within global alignments of orthologous upstream sequences
[3,4]. Although very powerful and straightforward, these
approaches cannot be used when upstream regions are very
divergent or have undergone genomic rearrangements. For
example, aligning the mouse and puffer fish orthologous
upstream regions would be very difficult, because of the great
reduction that the puffer fish intergenic regions have undergone [5]. Also, global alignments cannot be used when the
positions of regulatory elements within functionally conserved promoter regions have been scrambled, for example
through genomic rearrangements. Also, global alignmentbased approaches often generate an overwhelming number of
predictions because of the basal conservation between the
genomes under study. To reduce the number of predictions,
multiple global alignments of upstream sequences from several related species have been used, yielding many new candidate binding sites [3,4]. However, multiple (more than two)
closely related genome sequences are not always available;
moreover, by focusing only on regulatory elements that are
conserved between several genomes, these approaches might

interactions

One of the major challenges facing biology is to reconstruct
the entire network of protein-DNA interactions within living
cells. A large fraction of protein-DNA interactions corresponds to transcriptional regulators binding DNA in the
neighborhood of protein-coding and RNA genes. By interacting with RNA polymerase or recruiting chromatin-modifying
machinery, transcriptional regulators increase or decrease
the transcription rate of these genes. Transcriptional regulators bind specific DNA sequences upstream, within or downstream of the genes they regulate, and a large number of
experimental and computational studies are aimed at locating these sites and understanding their functions (for example [1,2]). The increasing availability of whole-genome
sequences provides unprecedented opportunities for identifying binding sites and studying their evolution. The strong
conservation of functional elements (binding sites, proteincoding genes, noncoding RNAs, and so on) across even distantly related species should make it possible to predict these
functional elements and prioritize them for experimental validation. The few large-scale comparative genomics

Background

deposited research

We describe a powerful new approach for discovering globally conserved regulatory elements
between two genomes. The method is fast, simple and comprehensive, without requiring
alignments. Its application to pairs of yeasts, worms, flies and mammals yields a large number of
known and novel putative regulatory elements. Many of these are validated by independent
biological observations, have spatial and/or orientation biases, are co-conserved with other
elements and show surprising conservation across large phylogenetic distances.

miss elements that are conserved in more local areas of the
phylogenetic tree.

served predicted regulatory elements are strongly supported
by these independent sources.

Here we describe a simple and efficient comparative
approach for finding short noncoding DNA sequences that
are globally conserved between two genomes, independently
of their specific location within their respective promoter
regions. Our method, which we call FastCompare, is based on
a principle that we have termed 'network-level conservation'
[6], according to which the wiring of transcriptional regulatory networks should be largely conserved between two
closely related genomes.

Yeasts

Our previous attempts at using network-level conservation
relied on Gibbs sampling to find candidate regulatory elements [7]. However, Gibbs sampling and related algorithms
are not fully appropriate in this context, because of the low
density of actual binding sites in pairs of orthologous
upstream regions. Moreover, these algorithms are non-deterministic, relatively slow, and rely on sequence sampling,
which makes them likely to miss many regulatory elements.
While our previous approach was successful at predicting a
large fraction of functional regulatory elements in the relatively small yeast genome, analyzing larger and more complex
metazoan genomes requires faster and more exhaustive algorithms. Here, we use a faster, simpler and more comprehensive approach for detecting conserved and probably
functional regulatory elements using the network-level conservation principle. FastCompare allows comprehensive
exploration of the conserved - but not aligned - motifs
between two genomes, while retaining a linear time complexity. We apply our approach to a large number of species,
including yeasts, worms, flies and mammals, and describe
some of the most conserved known and unknown regulatory
elements within these genomes. We also show how this
approach may help reconstruct part of the transcriptional
network and reveal some of its associated constraints. Finally,
we show that a large number of predicted motifs are conserved within and across different phylogenetic groups.

The average nucleotide identity between S. cerevisiae and S.
bayanus upstream regions is approximately 62% [4] (similar
to the identity between human and mouse upstream regions)
and divergence times are estimated between 5 and 20 million
years [4]. The number of ortholog pairs between S. cerevisiae
and S. bayanus is 4,358 (see Materials and methods). We
chose to analyze 1 kb-long upstream regions, because most of
the known transcription factor binding sites in S. cerevisiae
are located within this range [8]. Using FastCompare, we calculated a conservation score for all possible 7-, 8- and 9-mers
on the corresponding 8.6 megabase-pairs (Mbp) of sequences
and sorted each list separately according to conservation
score (see Figure 1; the raw sorted lists are available on our
website [9]). On a typical desktop PC, this analysis took
approximately 5 minutes (for example, the entire set (8,170)
of 7-mers was processed in 35 seconds).

Distribution of conservation scores
As described in Materials and methods, conservation scores
are calculated for all k-mers (with fixed k), and are relative
measures of network-level conservation for these k-mers (the
higher the conservation score, the more conserved the corresponding k-mer). We first describe the distribution of conservation scores for all 7-mers. As shown in Figure 2, the
distribution of conservation scores has a very long tail and
many 7-mers on the tail correspond to well known regulatory
elements in S. cerevisiae (see below for a detailed description
of these sites). To verify that such high conservation scores
could not be obtained by chance, we generated randomized
sequences as described in Materials and methods and re-ran
FastCompare on these sequences. The corresponding distribution of conservation scores is shown on Figure 2 and clearly
shows that the high conservation scores corresponding to
known regulatory elements are extremely unlikely to arise by
chance.

Validation using independent biological data

Results

In the following sections, pairs of closely related species are
termed phylogenetic groups. We applied FastCompare to the
four following phylogenetic groups: yeasts (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and S. bayanus), worms (Caenorhabditis elegans
and C. briggsae), flies (Drosophila melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura) and mammals (Homo sapiens and Mus musculus). For each phylogenetic group, we describe some of the
most interesting, known and novel, predicted regulatory elements. For each of these regulatory elements, we perform
independent validation using gene expression data, chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) data, known motifs and data
from several biological databases (Gene Ontology (GO)/
MIPS, TRANSFAC), and show that the most globally con-

We used various independent sources of biological data to
demonstrate that k-mers with the highest conservation scores
are likely to be functional. For a given k-mer, we define the
'conserved set' as the set of ORFs corresponding to the overlap between the two sets of orthologous ORFs containing at
least one exact match to the k-mer in their upstream regions
(see Materials and methods). We found that conserved sets
defined for the highest-scoring 7-mers are significantly
enriched with genes whose upstream regions contain occurrences of known motifs in yeast (Figure 3a), significantly
enriched with genes whose upstream regions were shown to
be bound by known transcription factors in vivo (Figure 3b),
and significantly enriched in at least one MIPS functional category (Figure 3c). We also show that the number of 7-mers
found upstream of over- or underexpressed genes in at least

of the distribution correspond to experimentally verified transcriptionfactor-binding sites in yeast.

Then, for each of these 398 k-mers, we determine the optimal
window within the initial 1 kb which maximizes the conservation score (see Materials and methods); we then re-evaluate
the functionality of each of the 398 k-mers with the independent biological information described above, using the new
conserved sets. The full information for the 398 k-mers is
available at [9].

Known regulatory elements
Using known transcription factor binding site motifs,
genome-wide in vivo binding data, functional annotation and
literature searches, we found at least 27 different known transcription factor binding sites among the 398 highest scoring
k-mers. These regulatory elements, along with their support
from independent biological data, are shown in Table 1. Some

score (Figure 3d) and that the number of 7-mers matching at
least one TRANSFAC consensus also increases with the conservation score (Figure 3e). Altogether, these data provide

Closer examination of Figure 3a-d shows that the 400 highest-scoring 7-mers are most strongly supported by independent data. Therefore we retain them for further analysis and,
when possible, replace them by 8-mers and 9-mers with
higher conservation scores and also add the high-scoring 8mers and 9-mers without high-scoring substrings, as
described in Materials and methods. This processing yields
398 k-mers (k = 7, 8 and 9).

Positional constraints

information

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R18

interactions

It is now known that functional regulatory elements can be
positionally constrained, relative to other regulatory elements or to the start of transcription [7,11,12]. To assess
whether some of the predicted regulatory elements are positionally constrained in yeast, we calculated the median
distance to ATG for the conserved sets of each of the 398 kmers and independently built the distribution of median distances to ATG for all 7-mers as described in Materials and
methods (the distribution is shown in Figure 4) and found
d0.025 = 350 and d0.975 = 680. In other words, a median distance to ATG of less than 350 or higher than 680 should each
arise by chance with only a 2.5% probability. Among the 398
most conserved k-mers, more than a fifth (86) have their
median distance below 350 (p < 10-52), while only seven have
a median distance greater than 680. A closer examination
reveals that a few known sites are particularly constrained.
For example, the binding sites for Reb1, PAC, TATA, Swi4,
Rpn4, RRPE and Mbp1 are found to be situated relatively
close to the start of translation, with a median distance to
ATG between 150 and 300 bp. Some of these constraints were

refereed research

Several known binding sites are not found among the 398
top-scoring k-mers, perhaps because their transcriptional
network has undergone extensive rewiring since the speciation of the two yeasts, or because the corresponding transcription factors regulate few genes. In some cases, the
presence of several known sites (clearly identified in terms of
independent data) among the full set of 7-mers argues in
favor of the rewiring hypothesis. For example, the binding
site for the Rcs1 transcription factor, TGCACCC, only appears
at the 1,883rd position within the list of ranked 7-mers.
Despite its lack of conservation, this site is strongly backed by
independent biological information: it is identified as a
known motif, it is found in 33 microarray conditions, and its
conserved set is significantly enriched in genes annotated
with homeostasis of metal ions (p < 10-5), which is the known
function for Rcs1 [10]. Similarly, the known binding sites for
the Ace2/Swi5 and Hsf1 transcription factors were clearly

Among the 27 different known regulatory elements returned
by FastCompare, several (Swi4, Mbp1, Sum1/Ndt80, Fkh1/2)
are involved in regulating the yeast cell cycle. The other
known sites are also involved in fundamental biological processes in yeast: amino-acid metabolism (Cbf1, Gcn4), meiosis
(Ume6), rRNA transcription (PAC and RRPE), proteolytic
degradation (Rpn4), stress response (Msn2/Msn4) and general activation/repression (Rap1, Reb1). As described in
Materials and methods, our approach also handles gapped
motifs. Thus, the binding sites for Abf1, a chromatin reorganizing transcription factor (CGTNNNNNNTGA), and Mcm1, a
factor involved in cell-cycle regulation and pheromone
response (CCCNNNNNGGA), were also identified as very

of the best-known binding sites are represented several times
within the 398 top scoring k-mers, in the form of slightly distinct or overlapping sequences (see [9]). Note also that we use
very stringent criteria for identifying known binding sites
among our predictions. When we matched our predictions to
the known motifs published in [4] (regular expressions), we
predicted 42 out of 53 known motifs (Kellis et al. [4] predict
exactly the same number of motifs, and essentially the same
motifs, but using multiple alignments of four yeast genomes).

For each known regulatory element, we show the best k-mer, its rank within the set of 398 highest-scoring k-mers, the median distance to ATG (for
occurrences upstream of genes within the conserved set), the optimal window, the corrected ratio of upstream/coding bias, the best known motif
(see Materials and methods), the best chromatin IP (ChIP) enrichment (see Materials and methods), the total (upregulated/downregulated) number of
microarray conditions in which the k-mer was found (see Materials and methods), and the best MIPS enrichment. *This sequence was the most
significantly over-represented 8-mer in the upstream regions of genes that were downregulated upon overexpression of the Rox1 gene (a known
repressor of hypoxia-induced genes under aerobic conditions [95]), as part of a series of microarray experiments measuring S. cerevisiae
transcriptional response to various stresses [96].

study [11] (for RPN4, PAC and RRPE, for example). In contrast, binding sites for Met4, Ume6, Hap4, Rap1, Ino4 and
Ste12 are found to be situated at a greater median distance,
between 400 and 500 bp from ATG.

Novel predicted regulatory elements
We found many novel motifs among our highest-scoring predictions. For example, we found two strongly conserved
motifs, AGGGTAA (rank 17) and TGTAAATA (rank 31), which
are situated relatively close to ATG (with a median distance to
ATG of 349 and 378.5 bp, respectively) and more often in
upstream regions than in coding regions (with ratios of 1.95
and 1.83, respectively). Interestingly, TGTAAATA also has a
statistically significant 5' to 3' orientation bias (binomial pvalue < 10-7). However, neither of the two putative sites is
supported by independent biological data. Additional expres-

sion data may help define their biological role. Other sites,
such as CAGCCGC or GCGCCGC are found upstream of overor underexpressed genes in many microarray conditions (15
and 6, respectively). While these two sites are similar to the
canonical Ume6-binding site, the latter was not found in any
microarray conditions (as none of the microarray experiments we used is related to meiosis, the biological process
which Ume6 is known to be involved in), suggesting that the
two sites are bound by other factors.

Comparing closer and more distant yeast species
We repeated the same analysis on distinct pairs of yeast species other than S. cerevisiae/S. bayanus. We first compared
S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus (a much closer relative of S.
cerevisiae) and found 15 of the 27 known motifs we obtained
when comparing S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus (results are
available at [9]). We also compared S. cerevisiae with S. cas-

Validations
The distribution of conservation scores for all 7-mers shows
that high conservation scores are unlikely to be obtained by
chance (Figure 5a). As shown in Figure 5a, many known regulatory elements fall on the tail of the distribution. We then
used functional categories, over- or underexpression, and
TRANSFAC motifs to assess the ability of FastCompare to
predict functional regulatory elements. Figure 5b-d shows
that support for the highest-scoring k-mers by functional
enrichment, expression and TRANSFAC strongly increases
with conservation score. We have only retained the 400 highest-scoring 7-mers, which are particularly well supported by
independent biological information as shown in Figure 5b,c.
Starting from these 400 highest-scoring 7-mers, we obtain
437 k-mers (k = 7, 8 or 9) using the procedure described in
Materials and methods.

Known regulatory elements

In contrast to yeast, relatively little is known about cis-regulatory sequences in C. elegans. There is a dramatically greater
complexity of transcriptional regulation in multicellular
organisms. Indeed, transcription factors in multicellular

The GAGA-factor binding site (AGAGAGA) was also found as
a highly conserved pattern. GAGA repeats in upstream
regions have been shown to be functional in C. elegans in at
least two separate studies [22,23]. At least one GAGA-binding

interactions

One of the most conserved is TGATAAG, the binding site for
the GATA factors, a family of regulators controlling intestinal
development (see [18] for review). Another motif returned by
FastCompare, GTGTTTGC, corresponds to the binding site
for the forkhead-related activator-4 (Freac-4) [19]. Note that
this motif is also compatible with the PHA-4-binding site
(published consensus: T[AG]TT[GT][AG][CT] [20]), present
in the upstream regions of pharyngeal genes [20] (PHA-4 is
also a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors). FastCompare also returned TGTCATCA, the known
binding site for the SKN-1 transcription factor (published
consensus [AT][AT]T[AG]TCAT). In C. elegans, SKN-1 is
known to initiate mesendodermal development by inducing
expression of the GATA factors MED-1 and MED-2 (required
for mesendodermal differentiation in the EMS lineage) [21].

refereed research

As shown in Table 2, at least 15 distinct known binding sites
in C. elegans and other metazoan organisms were identified
among the 437 predicted regulatory elements.

deposited research

Many of the predicted interactions have not yet been experimentally studied. For example, we found that the highest
scoring Reb1 motif (CGGGTAA) is significantly co-conserved
with both the highest scoring RRPE motif (AAAAATTTT) and
the highest scoring PAC motif (CTCATCGC), with a short
median distance between the two sites in both cases (D = 38
and D = 63.5, respectively). The Reb1/RRPE interaction was
also discovered independently as a good predictor of expression [11]. We also found that Reb1 interacts with the Cbf1
motif (CACGTGA), also at a short median distance (D = 30).
An interesting interaction between RRPE and an unknown
motif, TGAAGAA, displays a conserved set strongly enriched
in translation (p < 10-11), while RRPE alone is more strongly
enriched in rRNA transcription (p < 10-14). The full sorted list
of interactions is available at [9].

We applied FastCompare to the genomes of C. elegans and C.
briggsae, two worms that diverged about 50-120 million
years ago [17]. The number of orthologous open reading
frames (ORFs) between these two species is 13,046 and here
we have only considered 2,000 bp upstream regions. It takes
approximately 11 minutes for FastCompare to process the
corresponding 50 Mbp of sequences and calculate a conservation score for all 7-, 8- and 9-mers on a typical desktop PC.

reports

To discover interactions between regulatory elements, we
searched for co-conservation of pairs of high-scoring
predicted regulatory elements, as described in Materials and
methods. Not surprisingly, the most conserved interaction is
between RRPE (AAAAATTTT) and PAC (CTCATCGC), with a
median distance D = 22 bp [11,13]. We also find that the Cbf1binding site (CACGTGA) is strongly co-conserved with the
Met4-binding site (CTGTGGC), and that these two sites are
separated by a short distance (D = 44.5) in S. cerevisiae.
Indeed, it has been shown that the binding of Cbf1 in the
vicinity of a very similar sequence (AAACTGTG) enhances the
DNA-binding affinity of a Met4-Met28-Met31 complex for
this sequence [14], and that the median distance between the
above Cbf1 and Met4 sites is small [15].

organisms regulate cohorts of genes in different tissues and at
different times during development [16]. C. elegans promoter
regions often contain many domains of activation/repression
and, as a result, are much larger than those in yeast.

upstream regions cannot be globally aligned with those of S.
cerevisiae, because of extensive sequence divergence [3]. We
also found 15 of the 27 known motifs found in the S. cerevisiae/S. bayanus comparison (results at [9]), although they
were different from the S. cerevisiae/S. paradoxus conserved
motifs. Interesting similarities and differences in conservation were revealed when comparing the known motifs discovered in each comparison. For example, the PAC, RRPE and
Mbp1 motifs were found within the highest-scoring k-mers in
all three comparisons, hinting at the conserved role of the corresponding proteins. However, the Reb1-binding site, which
was found to be highly conserved between S. cerevisiae and S.
bayanus (rank 1), is much less conserved between S. cerevisiae and S. castelli (rank 230). This argues for extensive
rewiring in the Reb1 transcriptional network in the lineage
that led to S. castelli.

information

As in yeast, several of the known binding sites in C. elegans
appear to be constrained in terms of position. Using the distribution of median distances for all 7-mers (see Materials
and methods), we found d0.025 = 690 and d0.975 = 1,135.
Among the 437 highest-scoring k-mers, we found that 75 are
located below the lower threshold, a proportion that is much
higher than the expected 2.5% (p < 10-38). The binding sites
for forkhead-related activator-4 (Freac-4), Sp1, E2F and AP-1
are particularly constrained (see Figure 6). We found only 21
k-mers to be located further away from the distant d0.975
threshold. Interestingly, the most conserved k-mer among
these 21, CCACCAGGA (rank 96), is found in the upstream
regions of over- or underexpressed genes in 57 microarray
conditions.

FastCompare also returns the CACGTGG motif, which is the
binding site for the Myc/Max complex, a family of bHLH
transcription factors [37]. Among the top-scoring motifs in
Table 2, we also find AAGGTCA, the hormone response
element (HRE), bound by several transcription factors in
human, mouse, fruit fly and silkworm (published consensus
[CT]CAAGG[CT]C[AG] [38,39]); TGACGTC, the cAMP

CCCGCCC, the binding site for the mammalian Sp1 transcription factor (known consensus CCCCGCCCC); ATCAATCA, the

Several of the C. elegans sites returned by FastCompare and
shown in Table 2 are known to be functional transcription
factor binding sites in other species. For example, TGACTCAT, identical to the AP-1-binding site [34], is known to be
bound in yeast (by Gcn4), Drosophila [35], mouse and
human (see [36] for a review).

Searching for gapped motifs found few strongly conserved
sites. However, when searching for 8-mers with a 5-bp gap,

for nuclear factor I (NFI) [33], had a score comparable to
those of the highest-scoring k-mers.

(exd) protein [42]. Moreover, CEH-20C was identified as the
C. elegans homolog of both Pbx-1 and exd. Other known sites
discovered by FastCompare include CAGGTGA, similar to the
known binding site for the Snail protein, a transcription factor involved in dorso-ventral pattern formation in Drosophila
(published consensus [AG][AT][AG]ACAGGTG[CT]AC [43]),
and TTCGCGC, the known binding site for the E2F proteins,
a family of transcription factors involved in regulating the cell
cycle in Drosophila and mammals (published consensus
TTTCGCGC [44]). An E2F homolog has been identified in C.

were also found to be constrained in terms of orientation, but
at a much lower significance (p < 10-4, see below). Although it
is possible that the TCTC repeats are bound at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) mRNA level, the positional distribution of
the conserved AGAGAGA sites does not indicate a strong
positional bias with respect to ATG (DATG = 893).

Median distance to ATG (bp)
Figure 6 of median to C. elegans and C.of all 7-mers, obtained when
applying FastCompare distances to ATG briggsae
Distribution
Distribution of median distances to ATG of all 7-mers, obtained when
applying FastCompare to C. elegans and C. briggsae. For each 7-mer, a
median distance to ATG was calculated using the positions of matches
upstream of C. elegans genes within the conserved set for this 7-mer. The
8,170 median distances were then binned into 20-bp bins, and the resulting
histogram was smoothed using a normal kernel. The median distances for
several known binding sites in C. elegans are also indicated.

Note that for a few predicted elements (for example, CAGGTGA, rank 111), the median distance falls outside of the
optimal window; this is due to the fact that, for these elements, the median distance does not correspond to the peak
of the distribution of distances to ATG. Hence, for these
elements, the optimal window provides a better descriptor of
the positional bias than the median distance. Additional analysis reveals that several of the known binding sites discovered
in this study are constrained in term of orientation. For example, the binding site for the GATA-factor(s) (as shown in
Table 2) is significantly more often found in the 3' to 5' orientation, relative to downstream genes. Probably the most
interesting finding is that the GAGA repeats appear to be
strongly oriented 3' to 5' relative to their downstream genes.
Indeed, 2,375 out of 3,557 (67%) of the AGAGAGA sites are
oriented 3' to 5', a proportion that is much larger than the
expected 50% (p < 10-90). This bias is confirmed by the fact
that TCTCTCT alone (not taking into account its reverse complement) has a much higher conservation score (129.2) than
AGAGAGA (34.3). We also found that several related motifs
display a similar, albeit weaker, orientation bias, for example,
GAAGAAG (p < 10-16), GGAGGAG (p < 10-10). It is interesting
that all the GAGA repeats found to be necessary for correct
expression of the ceh-24 and unc-54 genes are in fact TCTC
repeats [22,23]. The conserved sets for TCTCTCT or AGAGAGA were not found to be enriched in any GO category.
Note that this orientation bias is not due to genes with the
repeats in their upstream regions being predominantly
located on one strand, as these genes are approximately identically distributed on each strand (1,065/1,122, p = 0.89).
Interestingly, conserved GAGA repeats in D. melanogaster

FastCompare also returned many novel motifs; some of the
most interesting ones are shown in Table 3. The top-scoring
motif, CTGCGTCT, belongs to this category. A larger version
of that motif, TCTGCGTCTCT, was found in a recent study to
be necessary for the expression of several ethanol-response
genes [47]. However, the very high conservation of this site
suggests a broader role. It is interesting to note that this site
was not significantly found upstream of under- or overexpressed genes in any microarray conditions (including the
data from [47]). Interestingly, the most conserved k-mer
found in yeast, the binding site for the Reb1 protein, had the
same property. Moreover, this site displays a relatively strong
orientation bias 5' to 3' (p < 10-10).
Several of the other novel predicted regulatory elements in
Table 3 have interesting properties. For example, the fourth
most-conserved k-mer, CGACACTCC, is one of the closest
motifs to ATG, with a median distance of 234 bp, and its conserved set is strongly enriched in genes involved in positive
regulation of growth (a biological process defined in GO as
the increase in size or mass of all or part of the worm) (p < 107). Another predicted regulatory element, CGAGACC (rank
20), is found upstream of downregulated genes in 23 microarray conditions. Interestingly, it is found upstream of downregulated genes in a study measuring gene-expression
changes at several time points during worm aging [48], in two
distinct strains (fer-15 and spe-9;fer-15) and at similar time
points (6, 9 and 10 days for fer-15, 9 and 11 for spe-9;fer-15).
In addition, the functional enrichment of its conserved set
points at a potential role in embryonic development (p < 107). Another strongly conserved and novel motif, CTCCGCCC
(rank 14), was independently found upstream of almost all
transcribed worm microRNA genes in a recent study [49].

Motif interactions
We found many interactions between the most conserved kmers found at the previous stage. For example, the most
conserved k-mer, TCTGCGTCT, is very often co-conserved
with AGAGAGA. The high-scoring interaction between the
DRE-like motif, AATCGAT and the putative E2F-binding site,
TTTTCGC, also appears interesting. Indeed, the conserved
sets for both k-mers are separately enriched significantly with
genes involved in embryonic development, according to GO
(p < 10-8 and p < 10-7, respectively). However, the conserved
set of genes having both elements in their upstream regions is
even more enriched in this GO category (p < 10-9). TTTTCGC
also seems to interact with the novel site CGACACTCC, and
the corresponding conserved set is enriched with genes

k-mers shown here were selected from the list of 437 highest scoring k-mers based on their short median distance to ATG, short optimal window,
significant orientation bias, strong over-representation ratio (U/C), presence in upstream regions of over/underexpressed genes in several
microarray conditions, palindromicity or resemblance to known sites in other species.

The distribution of conservation scores shown in Figure 7a,
for actual and randomized data, shows once again that the
high conservation scores obtained with the real sequences are
very unlikely to be achieved by chance. Also, as shown in
Figure 7a, many known regulatory elements fall on the tail of
the distribution.

information

As for the yeast and worm genomes, we used functional annotations (GO), expression data and known TRANSFAC sites to
evaluate the FastCompare predictions. Unfortunately,
expression data is often available for only a subset of genes
and its analysis led to very few validations. However, Figure

As shown in Table 4a, we found at least 16 distinct known regulatory elements among the 469 highest-scoring k-mers. The
most conserved element, AACAGCTG, is similar to the site
known to be bound by AP-4 (mammals) and MyoD (worms,
flies and mammals). One of the most interesting predictions
is TATCGATA (rank 12); this palindromic motif, known as the
DNA replication-related element (DRE), has been experimentally proved to be necessary for proper expression of several cell proliferation-related genes in D. melanogaster [51]
and, more recently, the genes encoding the TATA-binding
protein (TBP) [52] and catalase [53] in the same organism.
Interestingly, it is both the motif with the closest median
distance to ATG (DATG = 168), and the most over-represented
k-mer (among the 469 highest scoring ones) within D. melanogaster upstream regions compared to exons, with a ratio of
5.39.

We applied FastCompare to the genomes of D. melanogaster
and D. pseudoobscura, two species of Drosophila that
diverged about 46 million years ago [50]. The number of
orthologous ORFs between these two species is 11,306 and
here we only consider 2,000-bp upstream regions. Using
5,000 bp instead produced similar results, but also produced
additional putative binding sites (results are available at [9]).
It takes approximately 10 minutes for FastCompare to process the corresponding 45 Mbp of sequences and calculate a
conservation score for all 7-mers, 8-mers and 9-mers on a
typical desktop PC.

7b,c clearly shows that functional enrichment of the
conserved sets and TRANSFAC matches strongly correlate
with conservation score. As with yeasts and worms, we
focused on the 400 highest-scoring 7-mers, which are particularly well supported by the functional enrichment analysis
(see Figure 7b). The simple processing described in Materials
and methods yielded 469 k-mers (k = 7, 8 or 9), which we further analyze below.

Validation
Validation of the conservation scores obtained when applying FastCompare to D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. (a) Distributions of conservation
scores for actual (red) and randomized (black) data, showing that high conservation scores are unlikely to be obtained from randomized data.
Conservation scores for certain known regulatory elements are also indicated. Both distributions were constructed using bin sizes of 5, and the top
portion of the figure is not shown for the purpose of presentation. (b, c) Proportion of 7-mers supported by different types of independent biological data
(using windows of size 100, see Materials and methods) as a function of the conservation score rank, obtained when applying FastCompare to D.
melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. (b, c) strongly indicate that the frequency of support increases with conservation score as calculated by FastCompare.

For example, FastCompare predicts TTTATGGC (rank 14)
and TAATTGA (rank 24), the binding sites for two homeodomain transcription factors. The first site matches the TRANSFAC consensus binding site for Abd-B ([CG]NTTTATGGC),
while the second site is the known consensus binding site for
the Antennapedia (Antp) class of homeodomain proteins [54]
(TAATTGA matches the TRANSFAC consensus binding site

for Ubx, a member of the Antp class). FastCompare also predicts ATTTATGC, a site matching the TRANSFAC consensus
binding site for the chicken CdxA protein ([AC]TTTAT[AG]),
the homolog of the Caudal protein in D. melanogaster. Also,
FastCompare predicts CAGGTGC, the binding site for the
Snail repressor/activator protein, a transcription factor
required for proper mesodermal development [43].

Many of the known motifs found when comparing the two

FastCompare also predicts ATTTGCATA (rank 3) as one of
the most conserved putative regulatory elements between the
two flies. This site is the binding site for the POU-domain
family of transcription factors, and it is probably bound by
one or several of the three POU-domain transcription factors
in Drosophila: DFR, PDM-1 and PDM-2. These three proteins
are involved in different stages of Drosophila development:
DFR is expressed in midline glia and in tracheal cells [55],

phogenesis (p < 10-23). GTAAACA (rank 147), the DAF16binding site in C. elegans, is also one of the most conserved
sites between the two Drosophila genomes. This site is
probably bound by dFOXO, the unique homolog of the C. elegans DAF16 protein in D. melanogaster [57].
As for both previous phylogenetic groups (yeasts and worms),
the median distances to ATG for the conserved elements show
that some of the predicted regulatory elements are severely
constrained in terms of position. Among the most constrained k-mers are the DRE site (TATCGATA, DATG = 168)
and the known AP-4/MyoD binding site (AACAGCTG, DATG =
373). However, both the optimal windows and the median
distances in Table 4a show that, compared to previously studied organisms, a smaller number of conserved regulatory
element are constrained. Using the distribution of median
distances for all 7-mers, we find that the d0.025 = 798 and d0.975
= 1,126. Among the 469 highest scoring k-mers, 45 fall below
798 (p < 10-13) and 36 above 1,126 (p < 10-8), once again suggesting weaker positional constraints than in yeasts and
worms, at least when considering the first 2,000 bp of 5'
upstream sequences.

Novel predicted regulatory elements
FastCompare predicts many putative regulatory elements in
Drosophila that to the best of our knowledge are unknown
(Table 4b). One of these novel sites, CAGGTAG (rank 143),
was found upstream of several genes that are activated before
widespread activation of zygotic transcription (which begins
during the 14th nuclear cycle), in several Drosophila species
[58]; it was also found to be necessary for the early expression
of several of these genes (Sxl and sisterlessB) in a subsequent
study (J.R. ten Bosch, J.A. Benavides and T.W. Cline, personal communication). It is interesting to see that this particular site is significantly conserved upstream of genes involved
in cell fate commitment (p < 10-8).
Some of these sites, such as the palindromic TTAATTA (rank
31), are found much more often in upstream regions than in
exons (with an over-representation ratio of 3.07). Others,
such as ACACACAC, are found to be significantly enriched
upstream of genes in known functional categories (embryonic
development, p < 10-9). The same site appears to be strongly
oriented 5' to 3' (p < 10-12). Others, such as GTGTGACC or
AAATGGCG, appear to be located closer to ATG than most
other sites (DATG = 296 and 592, respectively).

Motif interactions
We found many potential interactions between the most conserved sites discovered by FastCompare. For example, the
POU-domain-binding site ATTTGCATA was found to be
strongly co-conserved with TAATTGA, the Antp-binding site,
and with many other potential homeodomain sites, such as
AATAAAT and TAATTAA. The CACA repeats were also found
to be co-conserved with several different sites, and in some
cases, the set of genes having both sites simultaneously con-

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R18

served in their upstream regions (conserved sets) was found
to be enriched in certain functional categories, for example,
ACACACAC and GAGAGAG, regulation of transcription (p <
10-12); ACACACAC and TAATTGC (an Antp variant site),
embryonic development (p < 10-5). The full list of interactions
is available at [9].

Mammals
The much larger noncoding regions of mammalian genomes
present significant challenges for computational motif discovery. Also, many repeat elements (for example, Alu) have
colonized mammalian genomes and are likely to be conserved
between closely related genomes. The distance between
enhancers and the transcriptional start of the genes they regulate can be extremely large, reaching tens of kilobases.
Finally, gene predictions and gene boundaries are still largely
unverified experimentally for a large number of genes.
We applied FastCompare to the genomes of H. sapiens and
M. musculus,, which diverged about 75 million years ago [59].
The number of orthologous ORFs between these two species
is 15,983 and again, we have only considered 2,000-bp
upstream regions. As in flies, using 5,000-bp instead produced similar results. It takes approximately 15 minutes for
FastCompare to process the corresponding 60 Mbp of
sequences and calculate a conservation score for all 7-mers,
8-mers and 9-mers on a typical desktop PC.

Validations
Unlike the other genomes considered so far, the output of
FastCompare from the mammalian genomes is dominated by
GC-rich sequences, probably corresponding to CpG islands
(GC-rich regions known to be associated with the promoters
of many genes). However, analysis of the FastCompare output yielded the same validations as for other species. Indeed,
the distribution of conservation scores obtained on actual and
randomized sequences shows that high conservation scores
are very unlikely to be obtained by chance (Figure 8a). As with
other species, many known regulatory elements are on the tail
of the distribution (Figure 8a). Also, as shown in Figure 8b-d,
more k-mers are found upstream of over or underexpressed
genes, more k-mers have their conserved set enriched with
GO functional categories, and more k-mers match TRANSFAC consensus sites as the conservation score increases.
We found that masking Alu repeats did not influence the output of FastCompare (data not shown). To overcome the overabundance of GC-rich sequences in the FastCompare output,
we use longer k-mers as starting points, namely 8-mers
instead of 7-mers. We started with the 600 highest-scoring 8mers, and replaced each of these 8-mers by one of its substrings (7-mer) or one of its superstrings (9-mer), when their
conservation score is higher. We then removed duplicates in
the list and added the high-scoring 9-mers that have no substrings within the list. This procedure yielded 284 k-mers

Known regulatory elements

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R18

information

As shown in Table 5a, we found 17 distinct known regulatory
elements among the 284 highest-scoring k-mers. Among
these are the well characterized sites for the Sp1, C/EBP,
CREB and Myc/Max proteins or families of proteins. These
four sites reside very close to ATG (their median distance to
ATG is between 100 and 250 bp), suggesting that the four
proteins (or families of proteins) may be involved in intimate
interactions with the transcriptional complex. Sp1 is an

ubiquitous transcription factor, involved in the basal expression of a large number of genes in mammals (see [60] for
review). The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) has
been implicated in the regulation of cell-specific gene expression mainly in hepatocytes, adipocytes and hematopoietic
cells (see [61] for review). Both Sp1 and C/EBP are constitutive transcription factors whose presence is necessary for significant induction of a large number of genes [62]. The CREbinding protein (CREB or CBP) is a transcription factor that
binds cyclic AMP (cAMP) response elements (CREs) in the
promoters of specific genes, and functions as a co-activator
for a large number of other transcription factors (see [63] for

interactions

(k = 7, 8, 9). Subsequent validation was limited to this small set
of high-scoring predictions.

review). The Myc/Max heterodimer binds the CACGTG
sequence, and also acts as a transcriptional activator (see [64]
for review).
Interestingly, we found that some of the most conserved
interactions between k-mers (see Materials and methods)
involve Sp1-binding sites (CCCGCCC or CCGCCCC) with
other known sites such as CACGTGAC (Myc/Max),

TGACGTCA (CREB), CGCAGGCGC (unknown), GCCAATC
(CCAAT-box) and ACTTCCG (Ets), and that the median distances between these sites are relatively small (138, 164,

whose median distance to ATG is 107, whereas the optimal
window is [0;1,000]). Nonetheless, a few known motifs do
not seem to show any positional constraints. For example, the
Bicoid-like site TAATCCCAG has a median distance to ATG of

However, when we looked at the overlap between conserved
sets for identical high-scoring k-mers in different phylogenetic groups (after determination of reciprocal best BLAST
hits between the considered species), we found little overlap.
The only significant overlap we found (after Bonferroni correction) was between the GATA sites (GATAAGA) in worm
and fly (p = 2.5 Ã 10-4). As a control, we performed the same
analysis within the yeast phylogenetic group, using the S. cerevisiae/S. bayanus and S. paradoxus/S. mikatae 400 most
conserved 7-mers. One hundred and ninety-five sites were
found in both groups of 7-mers, and for all of them, the over-

The distribution of distances to ATG for all 7-mers (Figure 9)
shows an interesting bimodal shape, indicating that a large
number of short sequences are constrained to reside around
500 bp to ATG. We calculated d0.025 = 342 and d0.975 = 1,185
and found that 83 k-mers among the 284 highest-scoring
ones have a shorter median distance than 342 (p < 10-63) and
only 11 have a larger median distance than 1,185. Indeed, a
majority of the known sites identified by FastCompare are

To gain a better understanding of the network-level conservation of regulatory elements between the different phylogenetic groups, we compared the results we obtained by
applying FastCompare to yeasts, worms, flies and mammals
in the previous sections. We calculated the overlap (and its
significance) of the 400 highest-scoring 7-mers and 8-mers
found for each phylogenetic group. As shown in Table 6a,b,
the number of shared predicted sites correlates with phylogenetic distance (the number of high-scoring putative motifs
that two phylogenetic groups have in common decreases as
the phylogenetic distance between the groups increases). All
of the overlaps were found to be statistically significant,
except for the yeast-human comparison. For both 7-mers and
8-mers, the best overlap is the one obtained between the two
invertebrate phylogenetic groups: worms and flies. Indeed,
simple observation of the identified known regulatory elements in Tables 2 and 4a reveals that these two organisms
have a large number of predicted binding sites in common.

FastCompare also predicts ATTTGCAT, the binding site for
the POU-domain Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins, known to bind the
promoter and intronic enhancer of immunoglobulin genes
[69]; it also returns GGAAGTCCC, a site that was shown to
bind NFÎºB [70,71], a transcription factor involved in a variety
of pathways (including inflammation, response to infection
and oxidative stress, and apoptosis).

human, and shown to be functional in resting and activated T
cells using site-directed mutagenesis, in vivo footprinting and

known to be bound in D. melanogaster by the anterior morphogen Bicoid, and also recently shown to be bound in human
by Goosecoid-like (GSCL) [68]. Interestingly, this site has a
relatively strong orientation bias 3' to 5' (p < 10-14). It is also
the site with the strongest over-representation in upstream
regions compared to exons that we observed, with a ratio of
7.06.

FastCompare identifies many putative regulatory elements
which to the best of our knowledge are novel (Table 5b). Some
of these predicted regulatory elements are found upstream of
over- or underexpressed genes in many microarray conditions. One example is CCCCAGC, which is significantly found
upstream of overexpressed genes in 21 conditions (out of 30)
of the human cell-cycle experiment [72]. Other conserved elements are found much more often in upstream regions than
in exons, for example, CCCCTCCC or TCTCGCGA, with ratios
of 5.12 and 4.45, respectively. Others appear to be positionally
constrained, for example, the palindromic CTGCGCA with an
optimal window [0;300] and a median distance to ATG of
199, or constrained in terms of orientation, for example,
GTGAGCCAC, which is significantly oriented 5' to 3'
(p < 10-6).

laps between the conserved sets obtained separately in the S.
cerevisiae/S. bayanus and S. paradoxus/S. mikatae analyses
were highly significant, with hypergeometric p-values < 10-40.
Therefore, our results strongly suggest that, while
transcription factors have largely retained their ability to
recognize specific DNA sites, their targets have largely
changed through appearance or disappearance of those binding sites in promoters. This hypothesis is supported by recent
analysis of the fission yeast cell cycle using microarrays,
which showed that the role and the binding sites for several of
the main transcription factors involved in regulating the yeast
cell cycle (Swi4/Mbp1, Fkh1/Fkh2, Swi5/Ace2) are conserved
between budding and fission yeasts (which diverged about 1
billion years ago), but the sets of genes that they regulate
overlap much less than expected (only about 50 orthologous
genes are cell-cycle-regulated in both species) [73].
It is particularly interesting to consider the seven 8-mers that
are top predictions for all three multicellular phylogenetic
groups (note that many more 7-mers are conserved between
these groups). These sites include the CRE (TGACGTCA,
GACGTCAC and ATGACGTC), the POU-domain binding site
(ATTTGCAT), and the HRE (CAAGGTCA). A fourth site is
also shared (GCCACGCC, CCACGCCC), which to the best of
our knowledge is a novel motif. Its strong over-representation
in upstream regions compared to coding regions, and its
closeness to ATG (median DATG = 230 for GCCACGCC) make
it a promising candidate for experimental testing. Interestingly, the location constraints on these conserved sites can
vary across phylogenetic groups. For example, the CRE
appears weakly constrained in worms and flies in terms of

distance to ATG (DATG = 708 and 825, respectively), but is
very close to ATG in mammalian genomes (DATG = 107).
However, the distances to ATG of the POU-domain-binding
sites (862, 882 and 729, respectively) indicate that their positional constraints are shared among the phylogenetic groups.
The same holds for the HRE binding site (845, 1,015.5 and
895, respectively).

Discussion and conclusions

We have presented a powerful approach for discovering transcriptional regulatory elements that are globally conserved
between pairs of genomes. Our approach requires only two
unaligned genomes, thus allowing the use of genomes of arbitrary divergence and those with extensive rearrangements of
noncoding regions. Moreover, our motif-finding strategy
does not use any parameters other than a conservation score
threshold, used to separate presumptive functional from nonfunctional motifs. We have shown that such thresholds can be
roughly estimated using independent biological data, when
available. Our approach is also computationally efficient:
whole eukaryotic genomes can be processed in minutes on a
typical computer. In turn, this efficiency allows FastCompare
to explore exhaustive pattern lists.
Our results show that FastCompare can recover most of the
known functional binding sites in S. cerevisiae when its
upstream regions are compared to those of a related species,
S. bayanus. We comprehensively explored the globally conserved motif content between worms, flies and mammalian
genomes, discovering large sets of known and novel motifs.

There are also several directions in which our approach could
be extended. From a methodological standpoint, the
approach could be extended to take into account local overrepresentation of identical or nearly identical copies of the
same binding sites, a well known feature in the promoter
regions of higher eukaryotic species [16]. To discover highly
degenerate regulatory elements, k-mers could be used to seed
weight matrices whose individual weights could be optimized
for network-level conservation, using stochastic optimization
procedures (for example, simulated annealing; Mike Beer,
personal communication). Introns and downstream noncoding regions could also be explored using our approach, as
these regions are known to harbor functional regulatory elements in metazoan genomes. While our approach can deal

refereed research

As shown by our inter-group analysis, many regulatory elements have remained functional across evolution, but few
have remained upstream of the same genes. The networklevel conservation principle thus appears less applicable to
species that diverged very long ago. For example, when we
compared the Drosophila and mosquito genomes (which
diverged approximately 400 million years ago), we only
found a handful of k-mers (interestingly including GATA-factor and Myc/Max binding sites) to have conservation scores
above those obtained from randomized data.

deposited research

However, Table 7 shows that the conservation score for
weight matrices describing very degenerate binding sites,
such as RAP1, is significantly higher than the conservation
score obtained for the best corresponding k-mer. This suggest
that our k-mer based approach is limited in its ability to discover highly degenerate binding sites.

reports

While powerful, our approach has potential limitations. Our
current approach allows matches to a given k-mer to be on
different strands within pairs of orthlogous upstream regions.
This flexibility substantially increases the number of k-mers
that are supported by independent biological data (that is,
true positives), at least for yeasts and worms (data not
shown). However, it is difficult to evaluate whether this flexibility introduces more true positives than false positives.
Also, transcription factors often bind several slightly distinct
sites with different affinities, and it is widely acknowledged
that binding-site degeneracy is better captured by using position-weight matrices (PWM) instead of k-mers or consensus
patterns [74]. To evaluate whether weight matrices would display better conservation scores, we calculated a conservation
score for weight matrices corresponding to 20 well characterized yeast binding sites, and compared them to the conservation scores obtained for the best k-mers that unambiguously
correspond to the same binding sites. Conservation scores for
weight matrices were calculated as described for k-mers in
Materials and methods, except that we used the weightmatrix score thresholds that maximize the significance of the
overlap between the two sets of ORFs containing matches to
the weight matrices in each species. This involves progres-

sively lowering the score threshold by small increments, and
for each threshold, calculating the overlap and its hypergeometric p-value. We then choose the score threshold corresponding to the most significant p-value, and use the negative
natural logarithm of this p-value as the conservation score. As
shown in Table 7, only in 11 cases out of 20 did weight matrices have a higher conservation score than the corresponding
k-mers. These results suggest that k-mers provide results that
are almost as good as those obtained using weight matrices,
when utilizing the network-level conservation criterion. One
reason why, in many cases, k-mers have a higher conservation
score than weight matrices may have to do with the more narrow selection of k-mers for binding sites with similar or identical affinities. In fact, we recently showed that PWM scores,
widely seen as proxies for binding affinity, are statistically
conserved in a comparison between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus [6]. In the context of the present study, the different kmers representing each transcription factor binding site may
be defining affinity classes that are more strongly conserved
than a looser definition of a binding site represented by a
weight matrix. Recent work in bacteria has established the
importance of binding affinity, especially with respect to
coordinating the temporal order of events [75].

reviews

We have created a set of web tools to superimpose the most
globally conserved k-mers discovered by FastCompare to
user-supplied sequences or multiple alignments. An example
is shown in Figure 10a, in which the upstream regions of the
STE2 gene (encoding the alpha-factor pheromone receptor)
from four different yeast species were aligned using ClustalW,
and the most globally conserved k-mers are highlighted. All
experimentally determined sites for STE2 were also predicted
to be globally conserved by FastCompare. Moreover, several
other sites also appear to be conserved, both at the global level
(predicted by FastCompare) and the local level (shown by the
multiple alignment). In Figure 10b, the same analysis was
performed on only two orthologous upstream regions instead
of four. Many more sites appear to be locally conserved than
when using four species, but the globally conserved sites
found by FastCompare allow the efficient selection of experimentally verified and putative binding sites. These tools
should be particularly useful in designing stepwise promoter
deletions and site-directed mutagenesis experiments for
understanding the regulatory code of specific genes.

comment

The use of external information (expression data, functional
categories, TRANSFAC, chromatin IP and known motifs)
clearly shows that our method is able to detect conserved and
functional motifs in all the phylogenetic groups that we studied. In all analyses, we have shown that some of the
discovered known or novel motifs were severely constrained,
either in terms of position relative to the start of translation
or in orientation. We also observed that some of the known or
novel motifs are co-conserved within upstream regions,
potentially revealing interactions between the (often
unknown) transcription factors that bind them.

with genomes presenting arbitrary levels of divergence and
rearrangements, it would be interesting to investigate how
global alignments or suboptimal and non-overlapping local
alignments [76] could be used to filter out regions of non-conservation. This approach would be particularly interesting
when analyzing very long upstream regions, in order to
increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, mRNA 3' UTRs
could be compared in order to find specific downstream regulatory elements involved in post-transcriptional mRNA regulation (for example, mRNA localization, decay or
translational repression).

Materials and methods
Outline of approach
First we determined orthology relationships between ORFs
on the basis of reciprocal best BLAST hits (Figure 1a) and
extracted the corresponding upstream regions from the
genome sequences. Then, we considered every possible short
DNA sequence of length k (k-mer, with k between 7 and 9) as
a candidate regulatory element. For each k-mer, we found the
set of ORFs whose upstream regions contain at least one exact
match to the k-mer, anywhere in the upstream region, in the
first genome. We did the same for the second genome, obtaining another set of ORFs. Then, we calculated the overlap
between the two sets and assessed its statistical significance
(Figure 1b). The statistical significance of the overlap provides a measure of conservation with which we score and rank
every possible k-mer (Figure 1c). Note that our approach is
very different from the classical k-tuple DNA sequence-analysis methods [77,78], which are not based on comparative
genomics and are local methods; that is, they only deal with
single promoters or small sets of functionally related promoters (while our approach provides a genome-level measure of
conservation for candidate regulatory elements).

Sequence sources and orthology determination
Sequence data were downloaded from the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) for all yeast species considered in
this paper; worm (C. elegans and C. briggsae), Drosophila
(D. melanogaster), human (H. sapiens) and mouse (M. musculus) sequence data were downloaded from Ensembl [79].
The D. pseudoobscura genome sequences (contigs) were
downloaded from [80]. The upstream regions used in this
study are immediately adjacent to the ATG codons of their
downstream genes, and are 1-kb long (yeasts) or 2-kb long
(worms, flies and mammals). Note that transcription-factorbinding sites generally reside in the region situated upstream
of the transcription start site. Unfortunately, not all genes
have well annotated transcription start sites. This problem
should not, however, strongly influence the output of FastCompare, as distances between start of transcription and
start of translation should be at most on the order of a few
hundred base-pairs (except in certain cases, for example
when 5' UTRs are interrupted by long introns). However, as
gene structures become better annotated (mainly as a result

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R18

of massive cDNA sequencing projects) and promoter regions
become more accurately delimited, we expect that the ability
of FastCompare to discover regulatory elements will be significantly improved.
Orthology information provided by Ensembl or by Kellis et al.
[4] was used throughout this study, when available. Ensembl
provides strong homology relationships between genes from
different species, but does not provide reciprocal best
matches. Therefore, we determine reciprocal best matches
using the provided sequence identity between homologous
genes. When orthology information is not available in
Ensembl (for example, between D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura, or between distant species such as S. cerevisiae and C. elegans), we determine orthologs using the reciprocal best BLAST hits approach.

Motif-finding algorithm and simple clustering
Given a value of k, we first generated the set of all possible kmers and removed half of them on the basis of reverse complementarity. We also removed k-mers with very low
complexity and which are over-abundant in the intergenic
regions of the genomes we analyzed (that is, those that contain k - 1 or more As or Ts), as these sequences are unlikely to
be regulatory elements. Every remaining k-mer (that is, 8,170
for k = 7) is then considered as a candidate regulatory element. For each k-mer, we found the set of ORFs in the first
species that have at least one exact occurrence of the k-mer in
their upstream regions. We then found the set of ORFs in the
second species that have at least one occurrence of the same
k-mer in their upstream region. Importantly, the matches can
be anywhere in the upstream regions: they do not have to be
at the same positions in two orthologous upstream regions (as
with multiple alignment) and can be on any strand. Since
both functional and non-functional elements are expected to
be conserved between two closely related species, the two sets
are expected to overlap. However, under the network-level
conservation principle, the extent of the overlap - and therefore its statistical significance - will be even greater for k-mers
that represent functional transcription factor binding sites.
The significance of the overlap can be measured using the
hypergeometric distribution. The probability of two sets of
size s1 and s2, drawn from a set of N elements, to have i or
more elements in common is given by :

P( X â¥ i) =

ï£« s1 ï£¶ ï£« N â s1 ï£¶
ï£·
ï£·ï£¬
ï£­ x ï£¸ ï£­ s2 â x ï£¸

min( s1 ,s2 ) ï£¬

â

x =i

ï£«Nï£¶
ï£¬ ï£·
ï£­ s2 ï£¸

In this way, all k-mers can be ranked by their hypergeometric
p-values. It is important to note that due to basal conservation (that is, conservation arising from common ancestry),
the hypergeometric p-values will generally be very small for
most k-mers. Therefore, we only use these p-values as relative
measures of network-level conservation and focus on k-mers

First, for each high-scoring k-mer, we calculated the median
distance to ATG (as the start of transcription is generally not
known) for the set of all (non-overlapping) occurrences of this
k-mer within the upstream regions of its conserved set (see
previous section for a definition of the conserved set of a given
k-mer). To statistically assess whether the median distance to
ATG for a given k-mer is unusually small or large, we built the
distribution P(d) of median distances to ATG, for the entire
set of 8,170 7-mers. We first created a histogram by binning
the median distances to ATG for all 7-mers into 20-bp bins,
and then smoothed the histogram (using a normal kernel and
a bandwidth of 50 as implemented in the ksmooth function of
the R statistical software package). Then, using numerical
integration, we sought the distance thresholds d0.025 and
d0.975 such that P(d <d0.025) = 0.025 and P(d <d0.975) = 0.975.
We then considered the median distance to ATG for a given kmer as unusually short or long when it is less than d0.025 or
greater than d0.975, respectively.

It is now known that the regulatory code governing the
expression of genes is combinatorial [11,85,86]. The networklevel conservation principle can be trivially extended to

Finally, using the results of the previous step, for each k-mer,
we used the binomial distribution to assess whether the
proportion of occurrences of this k-mer (within its conserved
sets) on one strand is significantly smaller (or larger) than
0.5. Binomial p-values less than 0.05 (after Bonferroni correction) are considered significant.

refereed research

For each k-mer, we also sought the sequence window which
maximizes the conservation score by progressively shortening all upstream regions (all having equal lengths) by 100 bp
increments from the 5' end. Then, we did the same from the
3' end using the optimal 5' end found in the previous step.
Evaluating every possible window whose length is a multiple
of 100 bp almost always yields identical results. We then calculated the conserved sets for these windows, and output the
orientation (strand) for each k-mer occurrence within its conserved set (palindromes were counted on both strand).

deposited research

FastCompare is implemented in the C language and uses efficient data structures (hash tables and prefix trees [83]). For a
given value of k, the worst-case time complexity is O(kn +
4k(p + k)), where n is the total amount of upstream sequences
and p is the total number of orthologous pairs. Note that the
first term is generally much larger than the second one; therefore the complexity of our approach can be seen as linear in
the combined sizes of the genomes to be compared (when k is
restricted to 7, 8 and 9). The calculation of hypergeometric pvalues involves factorials of large integers, so we use specialized C routines, as described in [84]. FastCompare runtimes
provided in the Results section are obtained using a standard
desktop PC (2.0 GHz CPU, 1 GB RAM).

As described in Results, we applied FastCompare to 1 kb
(yeast) or 2 kb upstream regions (worms, flies and mammals). While these lengths are reasonable, they are somewhat
arbitrary, and it is known that some regulatory elements are
constrained to be within specific distances (often shorter than
1 kb) from the start of transcription, reflecting mechanistic
constraints for transcription factor-transcription factor or
transcription factor-RNA polymerase interactions [11]. Moreover, some regulatory elements have orientation biases (see
[11,12] for examples). To discover such constraints, we analyzed the most conserved k-mers found at the previous stage
in the following ways.

reports

We use the following strategy when applying FastCompare to
pairs of genomes. First, we calculate conservation scores for
all 7-mers, 8-mers and 9-mers. We then retain only the m
highest-scoring 7-mers, with m chosen according to independent biological data (alternatively, m could be chosen
according to the estimated number of transcription factors in
the species being considered). We then replace each of the
retained 7-mers by an 8-mer (if there is one) with higher conservation score for which the considered 7-mer is a substring.
We also include within the final list the 8-mers which do not
have any substrings within the m 7-mers. We then repeat the
same process for the retained 8-mers, replacing each of them
by its higher scoring 9-mer superstring if there is one, and
add the 9-mers that do not have any substring within the 8mers. This strategy thus allows the optimal length for candidate regulatory elements to be determined.

Discovering positional constraints for conserved
regulatory elements

reviews

The current FastCompare implementation handles k-mers
with a user-specified gap (termed gapped k-mers), which is a
straightforward extension of the approach described above.
The conservation score returned by FastCompare is independent of the size of the patterns (that is, the value of k);
therefore k-mers with different sizes, and gapped k-mers (for
example, CGTNNNNNNTGA) can be compared.

comment

with the greatest conservation. For simplicity, we define the
'conservation score' to be the negative logarithm (base e) of
the hypergeometric p-value obtained for a given k-mer.
Therefore, the more extensive the overlap between the two
sets, the higher the conservation score. Also, for the same kmer, we call 'conserved set' the set of ORFs corresponding to
the overlap between the two sets of orthologous ORFs
containing at least one exact match to the k-mer in their
upstream regions. Conserved sets are used throughout this
study to get insights into the function of the most conserved
k-mers, using functional annotation [81,82], chromatin IP
[1], known motifs, and to evaluate whether these k-mers are
constrained in terms of position or orientation.

discover interactions (that is, co-conservation) between two
k-mers. To focus on heterotypic interactions, we only examined k-mers that differ by more than l nucleotides, after optimal ungapped alignment. We tested several values of l and
found that l = 4 was most appropriate when using 7-, 8- and
9-mers. Then, we proceeded as described above, except that
instead of seeking two sets of ORFs (one for each species)
whose upstream regions contain a single k-mer, we sought
the two sets of ORFs that contain the two k-mers simultaneously. Once these two sets were available, we evaluated the
extent of their overlap as described above, and rank interaction pairs according to their conservation score.

Validations
We used randomized data to show that high conservation
scores (obtained as described above) are unlikely to be
obtained by chance, and independent biological information
to assess the ability of FastCompare to predict functional regulatory elements by giving them a high conservation score.
We also estimated the over-representation of predicted
regulatory elements in upstream regions compared to coding
regions.

Validation using randomized data
Our goal was to generate new pairs of upstream regions that
are conserved at the same level of divergence as the actual
sequence data. We align each pair of orthologous sequences
using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [87], and calculate
substitution frequencies between all pairs of nucleotides (A â
A, A â T, and so on). Then, we reconstructed new pairs of
orthologous sequences by mutating one of the sequences in
each initial pair using the estimated frequencies. Generating
the sequences to be mutated using locally estimated firstorder Markov models yielded the same results.

Validation using independent biological information
The proportions of 7-mers supported by each type of independent data, as presented in Figures 3, 5, 7 and 8, is calculated as follows. In these figures, support for a given 7-mer is
considered as binary, and depends on whether the 7-mer
meets the particular validation criterion or not (or whether it
is found upstream of over- or underexpressed genes, in at
least one microarray condition, see below). 7-mers are first
sorted by conservation score, and the proportion of supported
7-mers were calculated using a sliding window of 100 7-mers.
For each window and each type of independent biological
data, we simply calculated the number of 7-mers for which
support is available and divided this number by 100.

above. Hypergeometric p-values for functional enrichment
were not corrected for multiple testing, but only p-values
smaller than 10-4 are reported, providing a slightly less stringent thresholds than Bonferroni corrections.

Known motifs
Weight matrices corresponding to known yeast motifs were
obtained from Gibbs sampling-based motif finding on
chromatin IP data [1], functional categories and clusters of
co-expressed genes [85]. Only high-confidence binding sites
(that is, sites confirmed by several sources including the literature) were included in our list of known motifs. We label a
given k-mer as a known motif if it meets the following two criteria. The first is significant overlap (p < 10-4) between the
conserved set for the given k-mer and the set of ORFs whose
upstream regions contain at least one match to the known
motif (the sets of ORFs were defined using ScanACE with the
weight matrix for the known motif, and with the standard
average minus two standard deviations threshold [7]). The
second criterion is strong sequence similarity between the
considered k-mer and the known motif weight matrix. To
evaluate this similarity, we turn the considered k-mer into a
weight matrix of 0s and 1s, and use CompareACE [7] to
calculate the Pearson correlation between the weights of this
matrix and the weights of the known motif weight matrix;
correlation coefficients > 0.65 are considered significant.
Finally, for a given k-mer, we report the known motif for
which the above hypergeometric p-value is the smallest.

In vivo binding data (chromatin IP)
Genome-wide binding locations were previously evaluated
for 106 transcription factors in S. cerevisiae [1]. For each
transcription factor, we retain the set of ORFs with p-value <
0.001 (see [1] for details of the error model). To evaluate a
given k-mer with respect to chromatin IP, we evaluate the statistical significance of the overlap between the conserved set
of the considered k-mer and the set of ORFs defined as
described above corresponding to each transcription factor.
We report the most significant chromatin IP enrichment,
with hypergeometric p-value < 10-4.

TRANSFAC
The 309 weight matrices and corresponding consensus patterns for known transcription factor binding sites were downloaded from [90,91]. k-mers were then simply matched to the
consensus patterns. We eliminated consensus patterns that
match too many k-mers, by matching each of them to all
(8,170) 7-mers and removing consensus patterns that
matched more than 50 7-mers.

Functional annotations
Yeast (S. cerevisiae), worm (C. elegans), fly (D. melanogaster) and human (H. sapiens) functional categories and
corresponding ORF annotations were downloaded from the
MIPS [88] and GO [89] websites. The statistical significance
of the functional enrichments within sets of ORFs was evaluated using the hypergeometric distribution, as discussed

Microarray expression data
Expression data for all species considered were downloaded
from diverse sources [92,93]. Overall, we downloaded 765
microarray conditions for S. cerevisiae, 555 conditions for C.
elegans, 156 conditions for D. melanogaster, and 1,384

reports

As shown in [94] for the yeast RAP1 transcription factor,
some transcription factors bind intergenic regions much
more frequently than they bind coding regions. Consequently, it is expected that sequences corresponding to regulatory elements are more often present in intergenic regions
than in coding regions. To evaluate this bias, we calculate the
ratio of the number of genes that have the k-mer in their
upstream regions over the number of genes that have the kmer in their coding regions (using only exons), and we correct
this ratio using the average length of the upstream and coding
regions.

Over-representation in upstream regions compared to coding regions

Elemento and Tavazoie R18.25

comment

We evaluated the over-representation of each k-mer in the
upstream regions of genes that are themselves over- or underexpressed in certain microarray conditions. Over- or
underexpressed genes are operationally defined as having a
log ratio of intensity above average plus two standard deviations, or below average minus two standard deviations,
respectively (averages and standard deviations are calculated
for each condition; using fold changes instead of standard
deviations produced roughly the same results). To evaluate
the over-representation of a given k-mer in a given microarray condition, we defined as O1 the set of overexpressed genes
in this condition, and as O2 the set of ORFs whose upstream
regions contain at least one occurrence of the considered kmer, genome-wide. Then, we evaluated the significance of the
overlap between O1 and O2 using the hypergeometric
distribution, as described above. Overlaps whose hypergeometric p-value is smaller than 0.05 (after Bonferroni correction) were considered significant. We proceeded separately
with the set of underexpressed genes in the same way. The
total number of microarray conditions (overexpressed plus
underexpressed) for which a k-mer was found to be significantly over-represented is reported. Note that we do not use
the conserved set for the considered k-mer here, as we do not
want to restrict our analysis to orthologous genes. Indeed,
except for yeast, microarrays often contain only a fraction of
all genes within the considered organism. In these cases, the
overlap between conserved sets and over- or underexpressed
genes can be very small, reducing statistical power. Using all
genes, therefore, increases our power to detect significant
associations, while retaining a uniform approach for all species considered.
