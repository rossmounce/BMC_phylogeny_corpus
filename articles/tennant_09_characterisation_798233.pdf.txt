Abstract
Background: Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is a prominent cause of diarrhoea, and is
characterised in part by its carriage of a pathogenicity island: the locus for enterocyte effacement
(LEE). EPEC is divided into two subtypes according to the presence of bundle-forming pili (BFP), a
fimbrial adhesin that is a virulence determinant of typical EPEC (tEPEC), but is absent from atypical
EPEC (aEPEC). Because aEPEC lack BFP, their virulence has been questioned, as they may represent
LEE-positive Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) that have lost the toxin-encoding prophage, or
tEPEC that have lost the genes for BFP. To determine if aEPEC isolated from humans in Australia
or New Zealand fall into either of these categories, we undertook phylogenetic analysis of 75
aEPEC strains, and compared them with reference strains of EPEC and STEC. We also used PCR
and DNA hybridisation to determine if aEPEC carry virulence determinants that could compensate
for their lack of BFP.
Results: The results showed that aEPEC are highly heterogeneous. Multilocus sequence typing
revealed that 61 of 75 aEPEC strains did not belong to known tEPEC or STEC clades, and of those
that did, none expressed an O:H serotype that is frequent in tEPEC or STEC strains associated with
disease. PCR for each of 18 known virulence-associated determinants of E. coli was positive in less
than 15% of strains, apart from NleB which was detected in 30%. Type I fimbriae were expressed
by all aEPEC strains, and 12 strains hybridised with DNA probes prepared from either bfpA or bfpB
despite being negative in the PCR for bfpA.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that clinical isolates of aEPEC obtained from patients in
Australia or New Zealand are not derived from tEPEC or STEC, and suggest that functional
equivalents of BFP and possibly type I fimbriae may contribute to the virulence of some aEPEC
strains.

Background
Strains of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are a well-recognised cause of diarrhoea, particularly in children in less
developed countries [1,2]. EPEC are characterised in part
by their ability to induce attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions
in the intestine [3-5]. These lesions are comprised of bacteria intimately attached to the intestinal mucosa at sites
of cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to characteristic
morphological changes, known as cupping and pedestal
formation, accompanied by the absence of microvilli. The
genes required for the production of these lesions are
located on a pathogenicity island known as the locus for
enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes (i) intimin,
an outer membrane protein product of the eae gene that
acts as an adhesin, (ii) a type III protein secretory system,
and (iii) several effector proteins secreted by the type III
system, including a translocated intimin receptor, Tir,
which, once bound to intimin, serves as an anchor for
host cytoskeletal proteins [6]. EPEC is divided into two
subtypes: typical and atypical. Typical EPEC (tEPEC)
strains carry a ca. 90-kb EPEC adherence factor plasmid
(pEAF) that encodes type IV-like bundle-forming pili
(BFP) [7]. The latter facilitate the adherence of bacteria to
the intestinal mucosa and to each other, allowing them to
form micro-colonies on epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo
[8,9]. Studies with adult volunteers have demonstrated
that intimin, pEAF and BFP are essential virulence determinants of EPEC [10-12]. Interestingly, there is evidence
that a subset of EPEC strains, known as atypical EPEC
(aEPEC), which lack pEAF and BFP, are also pathogenic
[2].
aEPEC is defined as E. coli which possess LEE, but lack
pEAF/BFP and do not produce Shiga toxins [13]. Evidence
of the pathogenicity of aEPEC comes from case control
studies of paediatric diarrhoea in several countries
throughout the world, including Australia, Iran, Norway,
Peru, Poland, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the
USA (reviewed in [2,14]). In addition, at least three separate studies have shown an association between infection
with aEPEC and persistent diarrhoea in children [14-16].
Notwithstanding these reports, the pathogenicity of
aEPEC remains controversial, chiefly because several studies have found aEPEC in patients with diarrhoea and control subjects at similar frequencies. These conflicting
observations prompt the question of whether aEPEC comprise a homogeneous group of pathogens with shared virulence determinants, such as adhesins analogous to BFP,
or whether they are heterogeneous, with one or more subsets being more virulent than others. Although some clinical isolates of A/E strains of E. coli which meet the
definition of aEPEC, appear to be Shiga-toxin producing
strains of E. coli (STEC) that have lost the Shiga toxinencoding bacteriophage(s) during passage through the
intestine [17], others may be tEPEC strains that have lost

pEAF [12]. Alternatively, aEPEC may represent a distinct
subset of human-specific strains of A/E E. coli or be
acquired from domestic animals, such as calves and rabbits, that are commonly infected with EPEC strains, which
lack pEAF [18,19]. In this study we characterised a large
number of clinical isolates of aEPEC from humans by
multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), PCR and/or DNA
hybridisation for E. coli virulence-associated determinants, intimin type, HEp-2 adherence pattern and type 1
pilus production as a way of addressing these questions.

Results
MLST analysis
We have previously reported that aEPEC isolates obtained
during a water quality study were heterogeneous in terms
of serotype, intimin type and patterns of adherence to
HEp-2 cells [20]. This overall heterogeneity was confirmed by MLST analysis, which showed that 56 of the 79
aEPEC strains of human origin investigated in the study
belonged to one of 11 different clades and that 23 strains
could not allocated to a clade (Figure 1). As observed with
phylogenetic analyses of A/E strains of E. coli in general,
there was a tendency for each clade to contain strains with
the same intimin and flagellar type. Five of 11 clades
which contained aEPEC strains in this study were clades
that include either tEPEC or STEC strains, whereas six
clades were apparently distinct for aEPEC. These six clades
comprised one which contained three strains with
intimin-β and H7 (and O-antigens, O25 or O153); one
clade with seven strains with intimin-ν and H19 (all Onontypable [nt]); one clade with six strains with intiminθ and H21 (O119 and Ont); a clade with five strains with
intimin-ι and H8 or H- (O98, O107 or O177); one with
four strains with intimin-κ and H10 or H- (O49, O88, and
O153), and one with 13 strains with intimin-α and H6 or
H34 (O71, O125, O126, and Ont). The last-mentioned
clade was closely related to a tEPEC clade (EPEC-1), which
also comprises strains with intimin-α and flagellar antigen, H6.

Of the strains that clustered with known clades of tEPEC
or EHEC, three (all intimin-γ and O55:H7) belonged to
the EHEC-1 clade, which also includes the pandemic, prototypical O157:H7 EHEC clone. Five aEPEC isolates
grouped within the EPEC-2 clade which includes pEAF/
BFP-positive strains with intimin-β and H2. The aEPEC
serotypes in this clade included O15:Hnt, O114:H2,
O117:H2, O128:H2, and Ont:H2. This clade also contained the prototypical aEPEC strain, E128012 [12], two
rabbit-specific EPEC (REPEC) strains, 84/110/1 and E22
(both of which carry intimin-β and are serotype
O103:H2), and a calf isolate, also O103:H2, but with
intimin-ε. Four aEPEC strains were assigned to the EPEC4 clade (intimin-β and H6). All of these strains were
intimin-β; two were O33:H6, and the others were

O139:H14 and Ont:H6. Two aEPEC strains, both O2:H4,
intimin-κ, belonged to the EPEC-3 clade, which also
included tEPEC strain O86:H34, intimin-κ. Overall, three
of 75 Australian and New Zealand isolates from humans
reported here belonged to EHEC clades, 11 fell within
EPEC clades, 38 belonged to clades distinct for aEPEC,
and 23 could not be classified.
Of the eight Australian calf isolates examined, three were
not assigned to a particular clade, and four belonged to
the EHEC-2 clade (intimin-β and H11), but were of different serotypes from each other (O111:H-, O111:H11,
O177:H11 and Ont:H-). This clade also included archetypal aEPEC strains E65/56 (O26:H-) and F41 (Ont:H-),
which were isolated in Europe more than 50 years ago,
and a well-studied, REPEC strain, 83/39 (O15:H-), in
which Ral, a K88-like adhesin, was first identified [21].
None of the Australian or New Zealand strains of human
origin investigated in this study belonged to this clade,
suggesting that there was no major exchange of aEPEC
strains between the cattle and humans from whom these
bacteria were obtained. One calf isolate (O103:H2) was
assigned to the EPEC-2 clade, which also contained
REPEC strains E22 and 84/110-1 (also O103:H2), tEPEC
strain, Stoke W (O111:H2), and the prototypical aEPEC
strain, E128012 (O114:H2). No aEPEC strains carrying
intimin-β2, -ξ, -o, -ρ or -σ were identified in the entire collection of 87 test and 8 reference strains reported here.
Frequency of adhesins and other virulence determinants of
pathogenic E. coli in aEPEC strains
None of the 67 Australian aEPEC strains of human origin
investigated in this study was positive in the PCR for genes
encoding the following adhesins of pathogenic E. coli:
BFP, Lda, Pap, Saa, Afa, Sfa/Foc, K88, K99, Af/R2 or RalG
(Table 1). On the other hand, all strains were positive in
the PCR for FimH of Type 1 pili. Moreover, all isolates
exhibited mannose-sensitive haemagglutination, indicating that they produced functional Type 1 pili.

One strain, NT731 (O45:H19, intimin-γ) was the only
one of the 67 aEPEC isolates investigated that was positive
in the PCR for Afa, a virulence determinant of uropathogenic E. coli that also serves as an adhesin in some EPEC
strains [22,23].
Two strains, R89 and R104, which belonged to a distinct
aEPEC clade, characterised by intimin-β and H7 flagella,
were positive in the PCR for AF/R1, a fimbrial adhesin and
essential virulence determinant of the prototypical REPEC
strain, RDEC-1 [24]. One strain, R219 (O51:H49,
intimin-α), was the only one that tested positive for AggA,
the pilin subunit of enteroaggregative E. coli [25]. Three
strains, NT286, NT731, and NT786, were positive in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/117

PCR for Iha, an adherence-conferring protein that is
highly prevalent in STEC [26]. The Iha-positive aEPEC
strains identified here were unrelated to each other and to
STEC in terms of MLST type, intimin type and serotype
(Table 1, Figure 1).
The PCR for long polar fimbriae (Lpf) was positive in 13
(19%) of 67 strains, all of which were from patients with
diarrhoea. Lpf-positive strains occurred within the EPEC2 clade (3 strains), the aEPEC clade with intimin-ν and
H19 (7 strains), and the aEPEC clade with intimin-β and
H7 (3 strains). Overall, seven of the LPF-positive isolates
carried intimin-ν, and six had intimin-β.
We and others have previously reported that certain determinants of EPEC, which are not encoded by LEE or the
EAF plasmid, such as Efa1, NleB and the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) are associated with virulence in
attaching-effacing E. coli [15,27]. NleB was detected in 20
(30%) of the 67 strains tested, whereas Efa1 was detected
in 8 strains (12%), all of which were also positive for
NleB. NleB-positive strains were distributed amongst the
following clades: EHEC-1 (3 strains), EPEC-2 (2 strains),
aEPEC-1 (intimin-β, H7; 3 strains), aEPEC-3 (intimin-θ,
H21 [or H6]; 6 strains). Six NleB-positive isolates could
not be assigned to a clade, although all carried intimin-θ
(Table 1). The Efa1-positive strains occurred within the
EHEC-1 and EPEC-2 clades, as well as within the aEPEC1 clade that was characterised by strains with intimin-β
and H7. Seven (10%) strains were positive in the PCR for
Cdt. Three of these strains belonged to the aEPEC-6 clade
(intimin-α and H34), one belonged to EPEC-2 (intiminβ, H2), and three were unassigned (Table 1).
DNA hybridization
To determine if aEPEC carry DNA sequences related to
those that code for the production of BFP, but were not
amplified by the PCR for BfpA, we investigated the aEPEC
strains by DNA hybridisation using probes derived from
the bfpA and bfpB genes of EPEC strain E2348/69. Unexpectedly, six isolates (ESA212, R176, R182, R228-1, R281,
and W114) hybridised with the BfpA probe at high stringency. Three of these strains belonged to the aEPEC clade
with intimin-ι and H8, but they belonged to different Oserogroups. The other three probe-positive strains also differed from each other. Six strains hybridised with the BfpB
probe. Four of these were positive for intimin-α, three carried H34, two carried H6, but all were of different serotypes. No strain hybridised with both Bfp probes.

Some aEPEC strains from humans and animals express
adhesins that are homologous to the K88 fimbriae of
enterotoxigenic E. coli [21,28]. To determine if the aEPEC
strains in our collection carried similar sequences, we

probed these strains for the fae gene of K88, but none of
the aEPEC hybridised with this probe, even when tested at
low stringency.
Adherence to HEp-2 cells
After incubation for three hours with HEp-2 cells, 54
(81%) of 67 aEPEC strains were adherent: 24 strains
adhered in an aggregative pattern, and two in the pattern
termed "localised-like adherence", because it resembles
BFP-mediated localised adherence, but the bacteria are
more loosely associated with each other than BFP-bearing
strains. Twenty-eight strains showed an indeterminate
pattern of adherence described previously [20], in which
bacteria adhere in a mixed pattern of diffuse and localised-like adherence. Thirteen strains did not adhere to
HEp-2 cells after 3 hours. Extending the contact period of
the bacteria with the HEp-2 cells from 3 to 6 hours
allowed some strains that had not adhered after 3 hours
to adhere in an indeterminate pattern, but the pattern of
strains that were adherent after 3 hours did not change.

Five of the six strains that hybridised with the BfpA probe
were non-adherent after three hours, whereas five of the
six BfpB-positive strains showed aggregative adherence
and one showed localised-like adherence. Adherence to
HEp-2 cells was not associated with a positive PCR for
either Lpf or Efa.
Association of specific virulence determinants with clinical
presentation
The 67 aEPEC strains we investigated by PCR, DNA
hybridisation and for adherence to HEp-2 cells originated
from individuals with different clinical presentations
(Table 2). Fifty-seven isolates were obtained from patients
with diarrhoea, and ten were from asymptomatic individuals. Eleven isolates were from children with persistent
diarrhoea (i.e., diarrhoea lasting more than 14 days), and
12 were from children with diarrhoea less than 14 days in
duration. Thirty-four strains were from patients in whom
the duration of diarrhoea was not known. To determine if
any of the putative accessory virulence determinants of
aEPEC that were sought in this study were associated with
a particular clinical presentation, we compared the fre-

quency of these determinants in isolates from patients
with and without diarrhoea, and those known to have
acute or persistent diarrhoea. The results showed that the
frequency of the factors investigated did not differ significantly between the groups under comparison (P > 0.1,
Fisher's exact test, two-tailed).

Discussion
The classification of diarrhoeagenic strains of E. coli into
pathotypes has led to considerable improvement in our
understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and
clinical presentation of infections with these bacteria, and
has spawned novel strategies to diagnose and prevent
these infections [29,30]. Each pathotype of diarrhoeagenic E. coli carries a distinctive suite of virulence determinants, almost all of which show evidence of having been
acquired on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids,
transposons, bacteriophages and pathogenicity islands.
Interestingly, apart from their shared virulence determinants, strains of each pathotype often differ from each
other in terms of serotype, biotype, phage type, and even
with regard to the nature of the specific virulence determinants they carry, e.g., Shiga toxin-1 or Shiga toxin-2 in
EHEC, and heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxin in enterotoxigenic E. coli [30,31].
It was not surprising, therefore, that the clinical isolates of
aEPEC we examined in this study were heterogeneous in
every way we investigated them, including by using MLST
to examine their phylogenetic relatedness. This analysis
confirmed that some strains are closely related to tEPEC,
while others are more like EHEC [32]. Indeed, one of the
aims of this study was to determine if aEPEC obtained
from patients with diarrhoea are derived from tEPEC that
have lost pEAF [12], or LEE-positive STEC strains that
have been cured of the Stx-encoding bacteriophage [17].
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 3 aEPEC strains
obtained from 75 humans in Australia or New Zealand
belonged to EHEC clades, and 11 belonged to clades that
contain tEPEC. None of these 14 isolates belonged to
serotypes of highly virulent or epidemic EHEC or EPEC
and none carried the gene for EHEC-haemolysin
[14,20,33], suggesting that they did not recently arise

from EHEC strains. On the other hand, it was not surprising that three aEPEC strains, which were clustered
together with EHEC O157:H7, were serotype O55:H7,
given the evidence that the latter appears to be the progenitor of EHEC O157:H7 [34].
Most of the strains we investigated (61 of 75) either
belonged to distinctive aEPEC clades or could not be classified, indicating further that they did not arise from
EHEC or tEPEC. Even those strains which clustered with
EPEC or EHEC generally were of serotypes that are not
common amongst tEPEC or STEC strains that are associated with infection of humans. Our finding that each bacterial isolate within each distinctive aEPEC clade generally
carried the same intimin type mirrors observations made
with tEPEC [35] and provides further evidence that E. coli
acquired the LEE pathogenicity island on a number of separate occasions.
aEPEC in different clades did not differ from one another
in terms of their association with acute or persistent diarrhoea. This conclusion is in keeping with our somewhat
unexpected finding that REPEC strains E22 and 83/39,
which carry closely related virulence determinants, and
are proven pathogens of infant rabbits in which they cause
a similar illness, clustered with EPEC and EHEC, respectively.
Our search for virulence determinants in clinical isolates
of aEPEC revealed that a minority of strains carried homologues of DNA sequences that encode known adhesins or
other virulence-associated determinants of pathogenic E.
coli. Overall, six strains each hybridised with DNA probes
for BfpA and BfpB, respectively, and PCR analysis gave
positive results for Lpf (13 strains), Iha (3 strains), AF/R1
(2 strains), Afa (1 strain), or AggA (1 strain). To our
knowledge, this is the first time that AF/R1 has been identified in any E. coli other than the prototypical REPEC
strain, RDEC-1 [36], but we have not determined if this
gene or any of the other putative virulence genes in the
probe- or PCR-positive aEPEC strains we investigated is
expressed by the strain that carries it. Moreover, no strain
was positive in the PCR for ldaH, which is the only known
specific adhesin of aEPEC identified so far [28].
In this study we were unable to confirm previous reports
that nleB or efa1, which are key components of a genomic
island of EPEC and virulent STEC [37], are markers of
symptomatic infection with aEPEC [38], largely because
these determinants were present in so few strains (present
in only 20 and 8 of 67 strains, respectively). We also did
not find any association between the presence of any
genes for particular virulence determinants and the clinical presentation of patients in terms of the presence or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/117

duration of diarrhoea, but the small number of probe- or
PCR-positive strains made the finding of statistically significant associations unlikely.
All of the aEPEC strains we investigated in this study
expressed functional Type I pili. Although these pili are
widespread amongst all varieties of E. coli, including nonpathogens, evidence is accumulating that these pili, which
are well established virulence determinants of uropathogenic and systemically invasive E. coli [39,40], may also
contribute to the virulence of EPEC and enteroaggregative
E. coli, particularly with respect to biofilm formation
[41,42]. Type I pili are also an essential virulence determinant of adherent-invasive E. coli [43]. In addition, overexpression of Type I pili by a BFP-mutant of tEPEC was able
to compensate for the absence of BFP and allowed bacteria to adhere to cultured epithelial cells in vitro [44].
Whether Type I pili contribute to the virulence of aEPEC,
however, remains to be determined.

Conclusion
Our findings show that aEPEC are highly heterogeneous
in terms of serotype, intimin type, multilocus sequence
type, pattern of adherence to HEp-2 cells, and their carriage of known virulence genes (apart from those encoded
by the LEE). Although we did not identify a common type
of adhesive fimbria in aEPEC that is functionally equivalent to BFP, we cannot rule out that one exists. Indeed, the
fact that all tEPEC strains express BFP despite their phylogenetic heterogeneity supports the case for continued
efforts to identify specific adhesins of aEPEC.

Methods
Bacteria
For the purposes of this study, aEPEC were defined as
strains of E. coli that were positive by PCR for the eae gene,
but negative by PCR for the genes for BfpA and Shiga toxins 1 and 2, using the PCR primers and conditions
described previously [14]. Sixty-seven of the aEPEC strains
investigated in this study were isolated in our laboratory
during the course of four separate studies: a Melbourne
water-quality study (21 strains with a prefix of W [20], a
study examining the clinical features of children infected
with aEPEC at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne,
Australia (28 strains with a prefix of R [14]), a study of the
prevalence of STEC in Melbourne (3 strains, prefixed
ESA), and a study of acute diarrhoea in children in the
Northern Territory, Australia (15 strains, prefixed NT
[33]). The remaining clinical aEPEC isolates were
E128012, from a case of sporadic infant diarrhoea in
Bangladesh [12], F41 (Denmark [45]), E65/56 and
D5301 (England [46-48]), all of which are archetypal
aEPEC strains [49]. We also tested 8 clinical aEPEC strains
from New Zealand (kindly supplied by Jenny Bennett,

ESR Ltd., Porirua, New Zealand) and eight aEPEC strains
isolated from symptomatic cattle in Australia [18] (kindly
supplied by Dr Steven Djordjevic, Elizabeth Macarthur
Agricultural Institute, Camden, NSW, Australia).
Reference strains of E. coli included in the phylogenetic
analysis of the aEPEC strains were: tEPEC (eae+ bfpA+)
strains, E2348/69, E990, Stoke W and C771 [12,49];
REPEC strains, E22 [50], 83/39, 84/110-1 [51], and an
STEC O157:H7 strain, EDL933, which is LEE-positive and
classified as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) [52]. E. coli
strains used as controls for PCR included enteroaggregative E. coli strain 17-2 [53]; STEC strains, EH41 [54], and
EH52 (this study); enterotoxigenic E. coli strain K88 and
E. coli K12-K99+ (courtesy of Professor Peter Reeves, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia); REPEC strains,
B10 [55], 83/39 and RDEC-1 [56], and uropathogenic E.
coli strain J96 [57]. Adherent-invasive E. coli strain LF82,
which was isolated from a chronic ileal lesion of a patient
with Crohn's disease, and 52D11 (an isogenic fimA
mutant of LF82) [43] were kindly supplied by Dr Arlette
Darfeuille-Michaud, Université d'Auvergne, ClermontFerrand, France, and used as controls to test for mannosesensitive haemagglutination. Unless otherwise specified,
bacteria were routinely subcultured on horse blood agar
or Luria-Bertani agar (BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at
37°C.
Preparation of DNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from E. coli using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as described in
Ausubel et al. [58], and was used as the template for all
experiments requiring DNA.
Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
Eighty-three test strains isolated from humans or cattle in
Australia and New Zealand, together with four archetypal
aEPEC and eight A/E E. coli control strains were subjected
to MLST analysis using the methods described on the
EcMLST website http://www.shigatox.net/mlst. Briefly,
seven housekeeping genes (aspC, clpX, fadD, icdA, lysP,
mdh and uidA) were amplified with AmpliTaq Gold in 50
μl reaction volumes. PCR products (5 μl) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels to check the size and yield.
The remaining 45 μl was purified using the QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted in 20 μl
elution buffer. Both strands of each gene were sequenced
using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Sequences were checked and cropped to the
required length using Sequencher 4.0 (Gene Codes, Ann
Arbor, MI). Sequences were concatenated for phylogenetic analyses, and aligned with the ClustalW algorithm
using the MegAlign module of the Lasergene software
(DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). Neighbour-joining trees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/117

were constructed using the Kimura two-parameter model
of nucleotide substitution with the MEGA3 software
(Center for Evolutionary Functional Genomics, Tempe,
AZ) [59]. The inferred phylogenies were each tested with
500 bootstrap replications.
Accession numbers
The sequences of the aspC, clpX, fadD, icdA, lysP, mdh and
uidA genes used for the MLST analysis have been deposited in the GenBank data base under accession numbers
GQ130379 to GQ131022.
Intimin typing
The eae gene was subtyped by using the restriction fragment length polymorphism assay described by Ramachandran et al. [60]. This method permits detection of the
following intimin types: α (alpha), β (beta), β2, γ
(gamma), ε (epsilon), ζ (zeta), θ (theta), ι (iota), κ
(kappa), λ (lambda), ν (nu), ξ (xi), o (omicron), ρ (rho),
and σ (sigma).
Detection of genes for adhesins and other virulence factors
by using PCR
PCR amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp PCR
System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) or an
iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a reaction
volume of 20 μl. The genes, primers, amplicon size and
PCR conditions used for these studies are listed in the
additional file (see Additional file 1). The test strains for
these analyses, and those described below, were the 67
aEPEC strains obtained from humans in Australia. The
following E. coli strains were used as positive controls:
E2348/69 (bfpA), 83/39 (efa1, ralG), EDL933 (iha, nleB1),
EH41 (saa, lpfDO113); K88 (fae operon), K12-K99+ (fan
operon), 17-2 (aggA); J96 (fimH, papA, sfa/focDE, focG),
EH52 (afaC), RDEC-1 (afr1), B10 (afr2), and E990 (cdt).
PCR products were electrophoresed on 1–1.5% Tris-acetate-EDTA agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide before visualisation on a UV transilluminator.
DNA Hybridisation
Genomic DNA was spotted onto Magna Nylon Transfer
Membranes (GE Osmonics, Trevose, PA) and denatured
and neutralised according to the "DIG System User's
Guide for Filter Hybridisation" (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Transferred DNA was UV-crosslinked using a
Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV crosslinker (Spectronics Corp.,
Westbury, NY). Digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes were
prepared by PCR (Roche) using primers to detect bfpA
(Table 1); primers MP-bfpB-F (GATAAAACTGATACTGGGCAGC) and MP-bfpB-R (AGTGACTGTTCGGGAAGCAC) to detect bfpB [61]; and primers faeEF
(ATGCGCCGGGTGATATCA) and faeER (TTATTTCTGCTCTGCGGT) to detect faeE. EPEC E2348/69 was used

as template for the bfpA and bfpB probes and enterotoxigenic E. coli strain K88 was used as template for the faeE
probe. These strains were also included as positive controls on the appropriate membranes. Before use, probes
were sequenced using ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator as
described above. Sequencing reactions were purified
using MgSO4 and submitted to the Australian Genome
Research Facility (Parkville, Vic, Australia). Hybridisation
was performed at low stringency (hybridisation at 50°C
followed by washing in 2× SSC at room temperature),
medium stringency (hybridisation at 59°C, washing in
0.1× SSC at 59°C), and high stringency (hybridisation at
68°C, washing in 0.1× SSC at 68°C), and detected by
using chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer. Bacteria were considered probe-positive if the
intensity of the spot was similar to that of the positive control.

Type I pili production
The expression of Type I pili was determined by investigating bacteria for mannose-sensitive haemagglutination of
guinea pig erythrocytes. For these assays, bacteria were
grown in Brain Heart Infusion broth (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, England) or Antibiotic Medium No. 3 (Penassay
broth, PAB; Oxoid Ltd.) at 37°C without shaking, and
tested for haemagglutination using the method described
by Iida et al. [63]. E. coli strains, LF82 and 52D11, were
used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
Strains that were haemagglutination-negative were
retested after passage through Brain Heart Infusion broth
to enhance the expression of Type I pili.
