Abstract
Background: For the past few years, scientific controversy has surrounded the large number of
errors in forensic and literature mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. However, recent research has
shown that using mtDNA phylogeny and referring to known mtDNA haplotypes can be useful for
checking the quality of sequence data.
Results: We developed a Web-based bioinformatics resource "mtDNAmanager" that offers a
convenient interface supporting the management and quality analysis of mtDNA sequence data.
The mtDNAmanager performs computations on mtDNA control-region sequences to estimate
the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups and retrieves similar sequences from a selected database.
By the phased designation of the most-probable haplogroups (both expected and estimated
haplogroups), mtDNAmanager enables users to systematically detect errors whilst allowing for
confirmation of the presence of clear key diagnostic mutations and accompanying mutations. The
query tools of mtDNAmanager also facilitate database screening with two options of "match" and
"include the queried nucleotide polymorphism". In addition, mtDNAmanager provides Web
interfaces for users to manage and analyse their own data in batch mode.
Conclusion: The mtDNAmanager will provide systematic routines for mtDNA sequence data
management and analysis via easily accessible Web interfaces, and thus should be very useful for
population, medical and forensic studies that employ mtDNA analysis. mtDNAmanager can be
accessed at http://mtmanager.yonsei.ac.kr.

Background
The outstanding features of human mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) – such as its high mutation rate, absence of
recombination, stability and the large number of genome
copies per cell – have led to its wide utilization in various

disciplines, including population, medical and forensic
genetics. For the past few years, scientific controversy has
surrounded the large numbers of errors detected in much
of the previously published mtDNA data [1,2]. In extreme
cases erroneous data can alter the main conclusion of a

study [3], requiring confirmation of the absence of errors
before proceeding to further analysis or drawing meaningful conclusions. Since phylogenetic investigations and
database screening could have detected prevalent errors in
published data sets, methodologies based on mtDNA
haplogroup determination and comparisons with existing
mtDNA haplotypes were proposed for preventing mtDNA
errors [4,5]. In particular, the phylogenetic approach –
which is the key tool used to understand the structure of
the mtDNA data under study – was shown to be very useful for systematic reanalysis of an mtDNA data set.
According to data and part of the phylogeny, it was
reported to detect approximately 50% of all sequence
errors [3] and hence has formed a starting point to localizing a sequence to a part of the phylogeny, at least to the
level of the haplogroup for systematic error detection.
Refinement of mtDNA phylogeny with more diagnostic
mutations would facilitate the detection of more errors in
mtDNA sequence data since it is based on mutation
motifs, and if haplogroup determination fails, a neighbourhood search for sequences in the available database
could identify a subset of potentially closely related
sequences, thereby allowing researchers to pinpoint errors
in the sequence by comparing the sequence in question
with a limited subset of the total database [4]. However,
manual haplogroup estimation requires a thorough
understanding of the worldwide mtDNA phylogeny, and
database screening for systematic error detection requires
high-quality databases that are publicly available.
The Human Mitochondrial DataBase (HmtDB) has been
designed and implemented using automatically running
bioinformatics tools to facilitate mtDNA haplogroup
determination [6]. The HmtDB is a database of 1255
human mitochondrial genomes annotated with population and variability data that allows researchers to analyse
their own mtDNA sequences and to automatically predict
their haplogroups, yielding a list of haplogroups that
match. However, haplogroup determination is carried out
by comparing the complete mitochondrial genome
sequences with the updated mtDNA haplogroup classification based on information of the coding-region single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for about 100 mtDNA
haplogroups and subhaplogroups. Accordingly, haplogroup estimation using the HmtDB would be useful for
researchers dealing with complete mitochondrial genome
sequences, but would not be applicable to the detection of
possible errors when researchers have only mtDNA control-region sequences.
As for the database, the EDNAP (European DNA Profiling
Group) mtDNA Population Database (EMPOP) is notable because it was established through a collaborative
project in order to provide reliable frequency estimates for
routine forensic casework [7]. The EMPOP was designed
to be a high-quality, Web-based mtDNA database where

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/483

primary sequence-lane data are permanently linked to
compiled sequences, and phylogenetic quality control
analyses are applied to data to check for errors [8]. Currently, the EMPOP contains 5173 high-quality mtDNA
haplotypes that are classified into sub-Saharan African,
West Eurasian, East Asian and Southeast Asian metapopulations, and thus enables users to assess the rarity of a
forensic mtDNA haplotype in various populations. However, due to somewhat narrow query options and inconvenient method used to display the results, its query tool
appears to be optimized for calculating frequency estimates for random matches rather than for database
screening to detect possible mtDNA errors. Also, the
EMPOP does not allow batch analyses. In addition to the
accessibility of high-quality databases to generate reliable
frequency estimates, the addition of batch analysis of
mtDNA sequence data and the construction of a user's
database would be greatly beneficial to forensic staff.
Here we present a Web-based bioinformatics resource
called mtDNAmanager that provides a convenient interface supporting the management and quality analysis of
mtDNA sequence data. The mtDNAmanager performs
computations on mtDNA control-region sequences for
estimating the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups, and
retrieves similar sequences from a selected database. The
aims of mtDNAmanager are (1) to allow researchers to
automatically estimate the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups of their mtDNA control-region sequences, (2) to
facilitate database screening with improved query tools
and (3) to provide researchers with a convenient interface
for managing and analysing their own data in batch
mode. A query system in mtDNAmanager allows researchers to find sequences in the database that include queried
nucleotide polymorphisms or to exhibit matches from
either a selected population or the entire population.
Inputted mtDNA sequences, which are either partial or
whole mtDNA control-region sequences, are entered as
differences relative to the revised Cambridge Reference
Sequence (rCRS) [9]. During sequence searches, mtDNAmanager automatically estimates corresponding haplogroups for submitted data and calculates frequency
estimates for random matches. Retrieved sequences are
also annotated with the estimated haplogroup affiliation
to highlight nucleotide polymorphisms that are specific to
a certain group of mtDNA haplotypes. This application
provides the first publicly available interface to automatically estimate the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups
according to control-region mutation motifs, thereby
facilitating data comparisons from a phylogenetic perspective.

Implementation
The mtDNAmanager interface was designed to allow
researchers to easily query the database and immediately
view results on a single page. The mtDNAmanager Web

interfaces were implemented using PHP and Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). AJAX makes Web pages
more responsive by exchanging small amounts of data
with a server in the background, and thus mtDNAmanager Web pages do not have to be reloaded after each user
request. This design aimed at increasing the interactivity,
speed, functionality and usability of mtDNAmanager. The
mtDNAmanager system is optimized for Internet Explorer
version 6.0 or later.
mtDNAmanager has a multithreaded and multiuser SQL
database management system designed and implemented
using MySQL. The mtDNAmanager database currently
comprises seven tables containing human mtDNA control-region sequences, data related to the samples and
results of haplogroup estimation obtained by the mtDNA
haplogroup-estimating resource that runs automatically
(Figure 1).

The most-probable haplogroup of a given mtDNA
sequence is estimated using a mathematical algorithm
based on propositional logic via hierarchical verification
of the presence or absence of haplogroup-specific diagnostic mutations. For that purpose, reliable controlregion mutation motifs (strings of characteristic/diagnostic mutations shared by descent) for the assignment of
more than 400 mtDNA haplogroups and subhaplogroups
were first identified based on well-characterized mtDNA
phylogenies (see the list of mutation motifs at http://
mtmanager.yonsei.ac.kr/help/MutationMotifs.pdf) [1049]. Mutation motifs of most of the haplogroups could
immediately be read from the mtDNA tree. However,
since each position of the mutation motif displays different mutation rates and homoplasy mutations are also
observed in multiple motifs, individual diagnostic positions were weighted in each haplogroup background. To
this end, polymorphisms of representative haplotypes

allocated to the corresponding haplogroup or subhaplogroup were screened against other closely related mtDNA
haplotypes. According to the mutation stability and specificity in each haplogroup background, individual diagnostic sites were classified into clearer diagnostic
mutations and their accompanying mutations. To obtain
mutation frequencies, published high-quality data were
mostly used, but the data found on Internet resources
were also used. The clear key diagnostic mutations of a
certain haplogroup could be a single mutation or a combination of multiple mutations. They were selected from
the polymorphic sites observed in every haplotype of the
corresponding haplogroup (100% specificity) and mostly
were not shared with any other haplogroups. On the other
hand, accompanying mutations are also observed in
almost every haplotype of the corresponding haplogroup
(>95% specificity), but could include polymorphic sites
observed in another haplogroups. Based on these haplogroup-specific mutation motifs, the bioinformatics tools
of mtDNAmanager designates the "expected haplogroup"
when a queried data sequence possesses clear diagnostic
mutations, and designates the "estimated haplogroup"
when the data indicate the presence of accompanying
mutations additional to the clear diagnostic mutations.
This haplogroup-estimation workflow gives priority to
certain haplogroups according to their degree of specificity to corresponding population groups. Therefore, the
bioinformatics tools of mtDNAmanager have a hierarchy
consisting of several levels of mutation motifs. Since all of
the key diagnostic mutations equally have very high specificity for their corresponding haplogroups or subhaplogroups, the levels of mutation motifs in haplogroup
designation were determined by the mutation stability of
each mutation motif. Therefore, within a certain haplogroup branch, subhaplogroups have a higher priority than
their root haplogroups, and among haplogroups of different branches, haplogroups associated with key diagnostic
sites that have a lower mutation frequency in a certain
population group have a higher priority. However, since
mutation frequencies and specificities differ among population groups, the order of haplogroup designations in a
hierarchical analysis of diagnostic mutations varied with
the population group represented in the queried
sequence. In addition, for two different haplogroups with
identical key diagnostic mutations, the haplogroup with
the highest prevalence in a certain population group has
designation priority.
The data set used to test the bioinformatics tools of mtDNAmanager contained more than 5000 mtDNA controlregion sequences whose haplogroup affiliations were
available from previous publications or on the Internet.
Actually, the bioinformatics tools of mtDNAmanager
allowed more than 98% of mtDNA to be allocated to an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/483

appropriate mtDNA haplogroup or subhaplogroup. For
data sets with haplogroup information confirmed by coding-region SNPs, relatively good concordance was also
observed between the expected and reference haplogroups (e.g. the concordance of 140 African Americans,
273 Austrians and 593 Koreans was 99.3%, 99.3% and
99.7%, respectively) [34,50,51].

Results
Content and design of the open database
The current open database of mtDNAmanager contains
7090 mtDNA control-region sequences grouped in the
following five subsets: African (n = 1388), West Eurasian
(n = 2857), East Asian (n = 1557), Oceanian and Admixed
(n = 1288) [50-62]. All of the mtDNA control-region
sequences were annotated with estimated haplogroup
affiliations using the mtDNAmanager bioinformatics
tools. In cases where a data sequence had been assigned to
a certain haplogroup in a previous study, relevant haplogroup information is provided in the output results.

The query system of mtDNAmanager retrieves sequences
that include queried nucleotide polymorphisms from a
selected population or the entire population group of its
open database by default (exchangeable with the
"include" or "match" settings). Since any combination of
nucleotide polymorphisms or any partial control-region
sequences can be analysed using the include setting, mtDNAmanager is very useful for analysing partial sequences
or comparing similar sequences that share the same nucleotide polymorphisms (Figure 2). With the alternative setting of match, mtDNAmanager also searches sequences
that match the queried sequence data from the database.
mtDNAmanager provides match options to select specific
regions to be analysed [HV1 (hypervariable region 1): np
16024–16365; HV2: np 73–340; HV3: np 438–576; and
control-region: np 16024–16569, np 1–576], ignore heteroplasmic insertions in poly C-stretches and permit mismatches in order to overcome differences in data
reporting between laboratories due to variability in the
analysis region, ambiguities with respect to mtDNA
nomenclature and different treatment of length variants
(insertion/deletion).
The frequency of a queried nucleotide polymorphism or
sequence is estimated from the number of times (x) that it
appears in a database of size n (that is generally known as
the counting method) while taking into account uncertainty due to sampling errors. This frequency is therefore
estimated as (x+2)/(n+2) [63], and is represented as the
"match probability".
Design of user database
Upon registration, mtDNAmanager provides Web interfaces through which users can submit and store their data

in batch mode and search for sequences that show a
match or include queried nucleotide polymorphisms
from their databases as well as mtDNAmanager's open
database. The sample system allows users to submit their
own data in batch mode and store data in groups while
simultaneously characterizing them by the automatically
running haplogroup-estimating workflow (Figure 3A).
The match system permits cross-matches of all sequence
data between two selected groups as well as the retrieval of
matched sequences for a sample of the user's database
from their own database or mtDNAmanager's open database, which will facilitate casework in disasters involving
many individuals (Figure 3B). In addition, the query system enables users to search sequences that show a match
or include the queried nucleotide polymorphisms from

their own databases or mtDNAmanager's open database,
thus assisting the analysis of the increasing amount of
mtDNA data available worldwide.
Input
Input queries are entered as differences relative to the
rCRS according to ISFG (International Society for Forensic
Genetics) guidelines [64]. When a difference between
sequence data and the rCRS is observed, only the site
(which has a designated number) and nucleotide differing
from the reference standard are recorded (e.g. "73G").
Insertions are recorded by first noting the site immediately 5' to the insertion followed by a decimal point and a
"1" (for the first insertion), a "2" (if there is a second insertion) and so on, and then the nucleotide that is inserted is

nucleotide polymorphisms from their own databases as well as mtDNAmanager's open database. (A) The sample system
allows users to manage and analyse large amounts of data in batch mode. Data are characterized whilst being imported by the
automatically running haplogroup-estimating workflow, and accordingly, each sample is annotated with the most-probable
mtDNA haplogroup (both expected and estimated haplogroups). (B) The match system permits cross-matching of all sequence
data between two selected groups as well as retrieval of matched sequences for a sample of the own database of the user or
mtDNAmanager's open database. Clicking the "Match All" button will display cross-matched results in a new pop-up window.

recorded (e.g. "315.1C"). Deletions are recorded by listing
the missing site followed by a "d" (i.e. "249d"). For convenience, transition mutations can be recorded by listing
the site and omitting the indication of the nucleotide difference. However, transversion mutations are recorded in
every case (e.g. "73" versus "73C") in which the nucleotide differs from the reference standard. Polymorphic
sites can be separated using a space, return or comma
character. Sequence searches are allowed to show matches
even when no data (i.e. no differences relative to the
rCRS) have been submitted, since some Europeans possess mtDNA control-region sequences identical to the
rCRS. The frequencies of nucleotide polymorphisms that
are identical to the rCRS can also be obtained by entering
the site and nucleotide polymorphisms of the rCRS or by
entering the site with "=" (e.g. "73A" and "73=") using the
include setting.

To import data through the sample system in batch mode,
the sample group should first be generated by the user.
User-defined sample groups are added to the group list by
clicking the "Add" button and entering their names and
properties. Then, batch input files are prepared in a text
file to be imported into a specific, user-defined group.
Input files are initially prepared as Excel files that contain
both the mtDNA sequence data and descriptions of the
properties of the data (see examples at http://mtman
ager.yonsei.ac.kr/help/Examples.xls).
The
mtDNA
sequence data are entered using the same method as input
queries. The Excel file is then saved as a text file (separated
by tabs) that is imported to a specific user-defined group
of the sample system. Input sequences can also be
uploaded one by one using the "Add" button on the sample list.
Output
Results from mtDNAmanager are displayed on the same
page on which the query was submitted (Figure 2). While
showing retrieved sequences, mtDNAmanager shows frequency estimates for random matches from a selected
group and the automatically estimated haplogroup affiliations for submitted data. Queried nucleotide polymorphisms that are either identical to the rCRS or entered as
IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) codes for point heteroplasmy are indicated as such
under "Comments". Frequency estimates for all of the
population groups in the database can be obtained by
clicking the "Worldwide Frequency" button, and the
cross-match result can be obtained by clicking the "Match
All" button. The retrieved sequences are displayed with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/483

estimated haplogroup affiliations (both expected and estimated haplogroups), nucleotide polymorphisms and, if
available, the haplogroup affiliations obtained from previous reports. Therefore, mtDNAmanager should facilitate
the comparison of sequences that share the same nucleotide polymorphisms from a phylogenetic perspective. In
addition to the Web-page presentation tools, retrieved
sequences can be exported as an Excel file for user convenience.

Discussion
The mtDNAmanager can be used to manage large
amounts of mtDNA data as well as to estimate the quality
of mtDNA data and compare such data with similar
sequences from a phylogenetic perspective. The application provides systematic routines for error detection and
strategies for screening mtDNA databases by enabling
researchers to automatically estimate the most-probable
mtDNA haplogroups and search the database with two
alternative settings (include and match).
In particular, the phased designation of haplogroups (i.e.
expected haplogroups and estimated haplogroups) facilitates systematic error detection by allowing the respective
confirmation of the presence of clearer key diagnostic
mutations and accompanying mutations. Specifically, if a
certain mtDNA sequence was annotated with the same
expected and estimated haplogroups, this means that the
sequence possessed the complete mutation motif for the
corresponding haplogroup. Likewise, if a sequence was
annotated with only the expected haplogroup, this suggests a lack of accompanying mutations for the expected
haplogroup, which was determined by the presence of key
diagnostic mutations (Figure 4A). From an mtDNA phylogenetic perspective, this would mean that a given
mtDNA haplotype is located at a previously unsampled
interior node of the tree such as a back mutation [4].
Accordingly, in this case, it would be necessary to recheck
the entire set of haplogroup-specific mutation sites in a
given sequence data. More importantly, data without both
of the haplogroup affiliations or that showed discordance
between expected and estimated haplogroups would also
imply a need to recheck the sequence for possible errors
due to contamination or a sample mix-up during the
sequencing and documentation process (Figure 5). Since
mtDNA haplotypes that could only be obtained from separate amplifications of several smaller fragments – such as
those found in highly degraded samples – are prone to
these errors, using mtDNAmanager to confirm the
absence of these errors after data generation will help to
authenticate the sequence data in highly degraded samples. For user convenience, currently identified haplogroup-specific control-region mutation motifs for more
than 400 haplogroups are available on the mtDNAmanager home page. From a phylogenetic perspective, mtDNA

was analysed with the option that permits mismatch. The results showed that the sequence had no match with European populations, but the retrieved similar sequences containing mismatches all belonged to the T2b haplogroup. In addition, the original
sequence was annotated with only the expected haplogroup, T2b. It was suspected that the mutation at 16226 resulted from a
clerical error because the mutation motif for the T2b haplogroup suggested that the sequence lacks the 16126 mutation. (B) By
clicking "Worldwide Frequency", the rarity of the 16226 mutation was investigated and the results showed that none of the

control-region sequence information might not be sufficient for assigning certain mtDNAs into respective haplogroups as reliably as the coding-region information, but
the control-region mutation motifs of mtDNAmanager
will at least suggest candidate sites or regions that need
reinvestigation.

Availability and requirements

Frequency estimates and sequences retrieved using the
include setting indicate the rarity of a nucleotide polymorphism in databases and show similar sequences that share
queried nucleotide polymorphisms. Accordingly, mtDNAmanager can reveal unusual, private mutations (Figure
4B) and suggest a subset of potentially close relatives
annotated with estimated haplogroup affiliations even
when the haplogroup estimation of a queried sequence
data fails (Figure 5B). This will highlight nucleotide polymorphisms that are specific to the retrieved group of
mtDNA haplotypes and help to distinguish sites that
should be analysed further. In other cases, retrieved
sequences with estimated haplogroup affiliations will
contribute to completing and refining haplogroup classification by revealing mutation sites that are specific to a
new branch of phylogeny. Therefore, to improve mtDNA
database screening, we will continue to collect and integrate high-quality mtDNA control-region sequence data
that are publicly available.

Operating system(s): Microsoft Windows

In addition, mtDNAmanager provides a convenient interface that allows users to construct and analyse their own
databases. Therefore, users can collect high-quality data
from public databases (e.g. EMPOP) or direct sequencing
results to construct their own databases. mtDNAmanager
will suggest the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups for
all of the sequences in the database, allowing users to also
easily estimate the quality of the database. Researchers
will therefore be able to select and use the most appropriate database for error detection based on their own evaluation of the quality of the available databases.

Conclusion
The mtDNAmanager supports the management and quality analysis of mtDNA sequence data using software that
performs computations on mtDNA control-region
sequences for estimating the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups. mtDNAmanager will help in checking the quality of data and facilitate data comparisons from a
phylogenetic perspective by displaying information – estimated haplogroup affiliations and nucleotide polymorphisms – of all sequences on a single page. In addition,
mtDNAmanager provides researchers with a convenient
interface for managing and analysing their own data in
batch mode. Therefore, this tool could be very useful for
population, medical and forensic studies that involve
mtDNA analysis.
