Abstract
Background: Protein domains have long been an ill-defined concept in biology. They are generally
described as autonomous folding units with evolutionary and functional independence. Both
structure-based and sequence-based domain definitions have been widely used. But whether these
types of models alone can capture all essential features of domains is still an open question.
Methods: Here we provide insight on domain definitions through comparative mapping of two
domain classification databases, one sequence-based (Pfam) and the other structure-based (SCOP).
A mapping score is defined to indicate the significance of the mapping, and the properties of the
mapping matrices are studied.
Results: The mapping results show a general agreement between the two databases, as well as
many interesting areas of disagreement. In the cases of disagreement, the functional and
evolutionary characteristics of the domains are examined to determine which domain definition is
biologically more informative.

Background
The concept of protein domains has gained increasing
interest from the biology research community because of
its importance in protein classification [1], protein function assignment [2], and protein engineering [3]. Protein
domains are generally considered as protein fragments of
common structures which may independently fold [4] or
have their own functions [5]. They have also been treated
as evolutionary units [6]. Protein domains function as the
building blocks of proteins and are often recombined to
form different proteins [5], leading to high redundancy in
protein structures. Currently, a few thousand protein

domains have been identified, a total much smaller than
the number of proteins. Classifying proteins based on
their constituent domains is therefore one of the most
effective and efficient approaches to organize protein data
both by structures and by evolutionary relationships.
However, such a classification requires the identification
of domain composition for proteins, which is by no
means an easy task. The challenge lies in the ambiguity of
domain definitions, as well as the lack of useful structural
information about most proteins.

Two types of approaches have been widely used to assign
domains: one based on the three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and the other based on protein
sequences. Structure-based approaches define domains
primarily according to the compactness and conservation
of protein structural regions, generally described as globular modules. The domain annotation is best achieved
through an expert's visual inspection of protein threedimensional structures. Currently, the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) [7], the primary protein structural database, contains 26,610 protein structures. A number of structurebased domain classification databases such as SCOP
(Structural Classification of Proteins) [1], FSSP (Families
of Structurally Similar Proteins) [8], and CATH (Class
Architecture Topology Homology) [9] are constructed
using the available protein structures so that proteins can
be easily analyzed for the presence of domains. Among
them, the SCOP database is manually curated and considered the most reliable domain classification. However,
this classification covers only about 2–3% of sequenced
proteins. At this time, the Swiss-Prot+TrEMBL [10]
sequence databases together contain over 1.5 millon
entries. The gap between the number of sequenced proteins and that of proteins with experimentally determined
3D structures is still increasing, which has greatly constrained the development of structure-based protein classification databases. Although 58% of sequences can be
modeled using comparative modeling [11], the accuracy
of such comparative models decreases sharply below the
30% sequence identity cutoff. An alternative classification
schema assigns domains to proteins by only sequence
information. Sequence-based domain databases constructed with this classification schema include Pfam [12],
ProDom [13] and InterPro [14]. These databases define
domains based on sequence similarity and implied evolutionary relationships. In this manuscript we focus on the
Pfam database in which domain boundaries are manually
assigned by experts.
Since domains are structurally and evolutionarily independent units, we may ask whether either a structurebased or sequence-based classification alone is sufficient
and how well they agree. A previous study compared three
structure-based classifications: SCOP, CATH and FSSP
[15], and concluded that the majority of their classifications agreed. Two sequence-based domain databases were
also compared [16] and discrepancies between the two
databases were attributed to their different philosophies.
In this paper, we strive to improve domain definitions
through examining the correspondence between
sequence-based domains and structure-based domains,
using the domain definitions in SCOP as the representative for structure domains and those of Pfam as the representative for sequence domains. Elofsson and
Sonnhammer [17] compared the Pfam and SCOP data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/77

bases in 1999. According to their comparison, 70% of the
SCOP domain families and 57% of the Pfam families
have counterparts in the other databases. However, since
then, both databases have greatly increased in size and
various revisions and updates have been made. For example, the domain representation in Pfam was revised to
model discontinuous domains [12]. Therefore, it is now
timely and important to revisit this topic and compare the
two types of domains under the new setting. Furthermore,
the aim of this comparison is to some extent different
from what Elofsson and Sonnhammer had. Other than
examining the extent that the two databases overlap, we
focus more on their differences. When inconsistencies in
domain definitions occurs, we propose to determine
which domain definition is biologically more meaningful
by inspecting the evolution of those domains.
We directly map SCOP domains to Pfam domains based
on their corresponding locations in their member
sequences. The approach assigns a mapping score to the
pair of domains under comparison to quantitatively represent the quality of the match.
The mapping reveals a moderate agreement among Pfam
families and SCOP domain families. Five types of relationships between the two classifications are clearly indicated in the mapping results and we therefore put them
into five categories. Statistical analysis and individual
instances are provided for each category of mapping. In
the case of disagreement in domain classification, information from past literature, such as known domain functions, is used as external validation. We also propose to
examine the evolutionary history of each individual
domain when disagreement occurs.
An overview of SCOP and Pfam
The SCOP [1] database is manually curated by experts. It
orders all proteins with known structures, according to
their evolutionary and structural relationships. The database adopts a hierarchical organization: domains are
grouped into families, then superfamilies, folds and
classes in the highest level of the hierarchy.

Pfam [12] contains hidden Markov model based profiles
(HMM-profiles) of many common protein domains
based on multiple sequence alignments. While the construction of the HMM-profiles is semi-automatic, expert
knowledge contributes in the grouping of proteins, the
aligning of protein sequences, and the quality control of
the HMM-profiles. Although Pfam is subclassified by
'type' in 2002 as 'family', 'domain', 'repeat' and 'motif', its
organization is generally considered to be flat. We hence
do not differentiate the subtypes in this comparison.

Mapping1between Pfam families and SCOP domain families
Mapping between Pfam families and SCOP domain families. An instance of a SCOP domain (si, i = 1, ..., 5) on its member
sequence is represented by a white rectangle while that of a Pfam domain (fj, j = 2, ..., 6) is represented by a black rectangle.
Striped rectangles represent their overlap. Location information is used to map a Pfam family and a SCOP domain family. Each
Pfam-A family and each SCOP domain family is treated as a set of member protein sequences. The mapping process finds overlapped regions of the two types of domains on their shared member protein sequences. The overlapped regions represent
where the two types of domain definitions agree.

The Pfam database contains two parts: one is the curated
section called Pfam-A and the other is an automatically
generated supplement called Pfam-B which represents
small families taken from the PRODOM database that do
not overlap with Pfam-A. In this study, only Pfam-A families are mapped to SCOP domain families.

Methods
Materials
All PDB protein sequences, based on PDB SEQRES
records, with less than 95% identity to each other were
downloaded from the ASTRAL Compendium [18,19].
This data set contains 8259 protein chains. Pfam 14.0 was
downloaded from http://pfam.wustl.edu/. Only Pfam-A
families were used for the comparison. This version contains 7459 Pfam-A families and corresponding HMM-profiles. The HMMER package, version 2.3.2, was used to
compare PDB protein sequences to Pfam-A HMM-profiles. The Pfam 'trusted cutoff' was used to determine
whether a Pfam domain matches a PDB chain. The SCOP
domain definitions were from the SCOP parsable files version 1.65. Because the SCOP parsable files are based on
the PDB ATOM records, the ATOM records were mapped
to PDB SEQRES records using the RAF mapping provided
by ASTRAL before the comparison.

We propose to map the Pfam-A families to SCOP domain
families based on their locations in member sequences.
Each Pfam-A family or SCOP domain family is treated as
a set of member protein sequences. A mapping between a
Pfam family and a SCOP domain family is defined as follows: (1) they have at least one member protein sequence
in common; (2) their locations in the common protein
sequences overlap; and (3) their mapping score is larger
than the pre-set threshold m. For each PDB protein
sequence, a comparison was then made for the overlaps
and differences in the SCOP domain families and the
Pfam families. The process of mapping is illustrated with
Figure 1.
Mapping matrix
Ideally, if a SCOP domain family and a Pfam family are
defined at the same location over the same set of protein
chains, then they map exactly to each other. However, in
most cases, the mapping is not exact, i.e. they only partially overlap at individual member protein sequences or
their member sequences are not all the same. In order to
measure the extent of overlap, a mapping score is assigned
to each pair of SCOP domain families and Pfam families.
Intuitively, if the SCOP domain family and the Pfam
family have more members in common and their

Two cases of domain mapping
Two cases of domain mapping. An instance of a SCOP domain (s*, * = l, m, n) on its member sequence is represented by a
white rectangle while that of a Pfam domain (f*, * = i, j) is represented by a black rectangle. (A) A Pfam domain and a SCOP
domain overlap at a very small portion of their shared member sequence. This case is considered a partial agreement between
the two types of domain definitions, and the mapping score is assigned as 0.5. (B) A Pfam domain overlaps with two SCOP
domains over the full lengths of the two SCOP domains, respectively. In this case, we consider the Pfam domain maps to both
SCOP domains. Therefore, a score of 1 is assigned to each mapping.

corresponding protein sequence segments overlap more,
then they are more likely to be mapped to each other.
However, this mapping criteria favors those domains
whose frequencies are high. Since we use only PDB protein chains in the comparative mapping, this data set may
be biased towards those proteins of interests to biologists
or whose structures are easier to resolve. For both domain
models, we observe a power law distribution of domain
frequency, where a few domains occurs in a large number
of protein sequences and many domains occur in very few
protein sequences. To account for the frequencies of
domains, the mapping score is normalized by the average
frequency of the two domains under comparison. Let si
denotes the i-th protein domain in SCOP and fj the j-th
protein domain in Pfam. The mapping score M(si, fj) is
defined as
M( si , f j ) =

overlap( sik , f jk )

where P represents the set of PDB protein chains with
both domain si and domain fj; pk is the kth protein chain
in the set; overlap( sik , f jk ) is the length of the overlapped
segment on pk; and length( sik ) is the length of si on pk.
freq(si) and freq(fj) represent the frequencies of the ith
SCOP domain and jth Pfam family, respectively. The fac-

domains overlap in a small part of their coverage and
where one domain is completely covered by the other
domain, as shown in Figure 2.
Properties of the mapping matrix
The mapping scores for all SCOP and Pfam domain pairs
form a matrix M. The matrix representation of the mapping has some nice properties. First consider mapping the
SCOP domain si to all possible Pfam domains. We look at

the i-th row of M. The number of nonzeros, nir , in the row
indicates how many Pfam domains that the SCOP
domain si could possibly map to. Among the possible
mapping, the most likely Pfam domain f * that the SCOP
j
domain si will map to is

f * = arg max Mij .
j
j

Note that the number of nonzeros, nir , could be large,
which implies that si maps to many Pfam domains. However, sometimes, two domains overlap very insignificantly, say only a few amino acid residues. To eliminate
the insignificant mapping, we set a threshold, m, and
require mapping to satisfy Mij ≥ m.

Next consider mapping the Pfam domain fj to all possible
SCOP domains. We look at the j-th column of M. The

number of nonzeros, nc , in the column indicates how
j
many SCOP domains could be mapped to. The most

The threshold m is again used to reduce insignificant
mapping.

Results
Domain mapping
A total of 2081 Pfam families and 2512 SCOP domain
families are defined in the set of 8259 PDB protein chains.
The average lengthes of Pfam families and SCOP domains
are 96 and 174 residues, respectively. The threshold m for
mapping scores is empirically set to be 0.01 to include as
much mapping as possible here, because even a small portion of the overlapping may be informative.

From the mapping results, 2008 (80%) SCOP domain
families overlap with at least one Pfam family, and these
SCOP domain families correspond to 2075 (99.7%) of
the Pfam families. On average, each SCOP domain maps
to 1.3 Pfam families, and each Pfam domain maps to 1.0
SCOP families. This result is expected because Pfam
domains are overall 16% shorter than SCOP domains.
The lengths of protein domains in SCOP are plotted
against those of the corresponding Pfam families in Figure
3. One-fifth (504) of SCOP domain families have no
Pfam counterpart, while only six (0.03%) Pfam families
are not mapped to SCOP domain families (Table 1). Further analysis reveals that all the sequence segments corresponding to the unmapped Pfam families represent
regions of residues that were absent in the PDB structures.
That is, all Pfam families with known PDB structures are
mapped to at least one SCOP domain family. It is unclear
why 20% of SCOP domain families do not correspond to
any Pfam family. One possible explanation is that the
there are too few examples of those SCOP domain families to build HMM-profiles for Pfam families.
Exploring the mapping results
Several types of sequence-structure domain relationships
emerge during this study, including:

• One SCOP domain family maps to exactly one Pfam
family, where the SCOP domain family and the Pfam
family overlap with and only with each other. However,
their member sequences and their coverages at each individual sequence may slightly differ.
• One SCOP domain family maps to many Pfam families,
where for each member sequence, the coverage of the
SCOP domain family corresponds to the summation of
those corresponding Pfam families.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/77

• Many SCOP domain families map to one Pfam family,
where for each member sequence, the coverage of the
Pfam family corresponds to the summation of those corresponding SCOP domain families.
• One SCOP domain family maps to sets of Pfam families,
where the SCOP domain family corresponds to one Pfam
family at each member sequence, but to different Pfam
families at different member sequences.
• Sets of SCOP domain families map to one Pfam family,
where the Pfam family corresponds to one SCOP domain
family at each member sequence, but to different SCOP
domain families at different member sequences.
Examples of each type are provided in Table 2. We present
below a detailed analysis of our findings.
One-to-one exact mapping
996 SCOP domains each maps to exactly one Pfam family. That is, 39.65% of SCOP domain families and 47.86%
of Pfam families have exactly one counterpart in the other
type of domain classification. Among these Pfam families,
431 (43.3%) are labelled as 'Family' type, 558 (56.0%) are
associated with 'Domain' type, 4 (0.4%) with 'Repeat'
type and 3 (0.3%) with 'Motif' type. Thus, the SCOP
domain families largely (99.3%) correspond to 'Family' or
'Domain' types in Pfam.

In the case of one-to-one mapping, these Pfam domains
have an average length of 164.0, and the SCOP domains
have an average length of 182.7, 11% longer on average
than the corresponding Pfam domains. Even where two
domains are mapped one-to-one, their definitions may
slightly disagree. For instance, their member protein
sequences may not be exactly the same, or their corresponding sequence segments may not completely overlap. A few examples of Pfam domains and SCOP domains
are graphed onto the corresponding member protein
structures using Pymol [20] as shown in Figure 4 to illustrate the latter case.
Figure 5 shows the histogram of the differences in
domains' endpoints. For two domains fi and sj, their difference in the endpoints is calculated as the total length of
the regions covered by fi or sj minus the length of the
shared regions covered by fi and sj. More than 50% (511)
of the mappings between Pfam families and SCOP
domain families differ by less than 10 residues, while only
3.4% (34) of domain mappings differ by more than 100
residues. To quantify the extent of the one-to-one mapping, we define a mapping ratio as

less than 20% of the domain sequences, and 90.26% vary
in less than 30% of the domain sequences.
One SCOP domain family to many Pfam families
A total of 76 SCOP domain families map to multiple
Pfam families. About half (33) of these SCOP domain
families correspond to several copies (repeats) of the same
Pfam family. The corresponding Pfam families may be of
Pfam type 'Family', 'Domain', or 'Repeat'. One example is
provided for each case in Figure 7. SCOP domain
a.118.1.8 (Pumilio repeat)corresponds to 8 copies of Pfam
family PUF (Pumilio-family RNA binding repeat) of type

'Family' (Figure 7(A)), SCOP domain c.10.2.8 (Polygalacturonase inhibiting protein PGIP) corresponds to 8 copies of
Pfam family LRR (Leucine Rich Repeat) of type 'Repeat'
(Figure 7(B)), and SCOP domain a.39.1.10 (Polcalcin phl
p 7) corresponds to 2 copies of Pfam family efhand (EF
hand) of type 'Domain' (Figure 7(C)). It seems that these
Pfam families all serve as building blocks for SCOP
domains and more careful investigation is required to
determine the validity of these domains.
Several Pfam families, such as LRR (Leucine Rich Repeat)
and efhand (EF hand) have a high frequency of mapping to
SCOP domain families. For instance, the SCOP domain
c.10.1.2(Rna1p (RanGAP1), N-terminal domain) maps to
two copies of the Pfam family LRR, the SCOP domain
c.11.1.1 (Outer arm dynein light chain 1) maps to four copies of LRR, and the SCOP domain c.10.2.8 (Polygalacturonase inhibiting protein PGIP) maps to eight copies of LRR
(Figure 7(B)). Most of the SCOP counterparts of LRR
belong to the SCOP L domain-like superfamily. Pfam
annotates LRR as Repeat type, and describes them as 'short
sequence motifs present in a number of proteins with
diverse functions'. These types of Pfam families actually
represent structural components that form structural
domains. They differ from domains in that they are functionally and evolutionarily dependent on other structure
components. Therefore, we would suggest these Pfam
families being removed from the Pfam-A family.

Structures
Structures of SCOP domains each mapped to several copies (repeats) of a Pfam family. The corresponding Pfam families may
be of type 'Family', 'Domain', or 'Repeat'. PDB proteins lib2A, 1ogqA, and lk9uA are used for the illustration. (A) SCOP domain
a.118.1.8 (Pumilio repeat) corresponds to 8 copies of Pfam family PUF (Pumilio-family RNA binding repeat) of type 'Family'. The
regions marked by red, pink, blue, purple, green, cyan, orange, and yellow each represent a copy of PUF. (B) SCOP domain
c.10.2.8 (Polygalacturonase inhibiting protein PGIP) corresponds to 8 copies of Pfam family LRR (Leucine Rich Repeat) of type
'Repeat'. The eight copies of LRR are each marked with a unique color: red, pink, blue, purple, green, cyan, orange, and yellow.
(C) SCOP domain a.39.1.10 (Polcalcin phl p 7) corresponds to 2 copies of Pfam family efhand (EF hand) of type 'Domain'. The
two copies of efhand are marked in red and green, respectively.

A series of SCOP domains are mapped to a Pfam family. (A) The Pfam family ACR_tran (AcrB/AcrD/AcrF family) corresponds to
eight SCOP domain families for PDBID 1iwgA, three of which are unique. The regions marked with red and pink are two copies of the SCOP domain family d.225.1.1 (Multidrug efflux transporter AcrB TolC docking domain; DN and DC subdomains), marked
with yellow and orange are two copies of the SCOP domain family f.35.1.1 (Multidrug efflux transporter AcrB transmembrane
domain), and the rest are four copies of the SCOP domain family d.58.44.1 (Multidrug efflux transporter AcrB pore domain; PN1,
PN2, PC1 and PC2 subdomains). (B) The Pfam family Glyco_hydro_42 (Beta-galactosidase) mapped to a series of the SCOP domain
families {c.1.8.1 (Amylase, catalytic domain), c.23.16.5 (A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain), b.71.1.1 (alpha-Amylases, C-terminal
beta-sheet domain)} in PDB protein 1kwgA. They are marked in cyan, green and blue, respectively.

Many SCOP domain families to one Pfam family
There are 106 Pfam families mapped to multiple SCOP
domains. Of them, 25 map to repeats of the same SCOP
domain. Several examples for this type of mapping are
shown in Figure 8. According to the mapping results for
the bacterial multidrug efflux transporter AcrB (PDB ID
1iwgA), the Pfam ACR_tran (AcrB/AcrD/AcrF) family corresponds to eight SCOP domain families in the order of
f.35.1.1 (Multidrug efflux transporter AcrB transmembrane
domain), d.58.44.1 (Multidrug efflux transporter AcrB pore
domain; PN1, PN2, PCI and PC2 subdomains), d.58.44.1,
d.225.1.1 (Multidrug efflux transporter AcrB TolC docking
domain; DN and DC subdomains), f.35.1.1, d.58.44.1,
d.58.44.1, and d.225.1.1 (Figure 8(A)). Among these
SCOP domains, only three are unique, and the second
four SCOP domains are exact repeats of the first four
SCOP domains. These SCOP domains are found to coexist in PDB protein chains 1iwG, 1oy8, 1oyE, 1oy6,
1oy9, and 1oyD based on SCOP records. Further inspection reveals that these domains are always present
together in the multidrug efflux transporter proteins in the

same order, and they act collaboratively in the process of
exporting toxic compounds out of the cell [21].
However, each functions independently: d.225.1.1 docks
TolC into AcrB, f.35.1.1 translocates substrates from the
cell interior, and d.58.44.1 translocates substrates into the
TolC tunnel. In this sense, the SCOP domain classification
is more accurate and the Pfam ACR_tran family may be
chopped into eight small domains. Similarly, the Pfam
family Glyco_hydro_42 (Beta-galactosidase), mapped to a
series of the SCOP domain families c.1.8.1 (Amylase,
catalytic domain), c.23.16.5 (A4 beta-galactosidase middle
domain), and b.71.1.1 (alpha-Amylases, C-terminal betasheet domain), may be partitioned into three small
domains.
One SCOP domain to sets of Pfam families
289 SCOP domains are mapped to sets of Pfam domains,
one set at a time. For example, the SCOP domain d.81.1.2
(Homoserine dehydrogenase-like) maps to the Pfam family
Homoserine_dh (Homoserine dehydrogenase) on the PDB

protein chain 1ebf A (Figure 9(A)) and to the Pfam family
Saccharop_dh (Saccharopine dehydrogenase) on the PDB
protein chain 1e5qA (Figure 9(B)). Another example is the
SCOP domain family e.8.1.1 (DNA polymerase I) which
maps to the Pfam DNA_pol_A (DNA polymerase family A)
and DNA_pol_B (DNA polymerase family B) on different
PDB protein chains. Relationships are suggested between
these Pfam families that are individually mapped to a
same SCOP domain family. If several sets of Pfam families
are mapped to the same SCOP domain, based on the fact
that the SCOP domain families are functionally inde-

pendent, these Pfam families are very likely to share both
functions and structures. Therefore, close scrutiny may be
required to determine whether these Pfam families should
be merged or not.
Sets of SCOP domain families to one Pfam family
We find 314 Pfam families that map to multiple sets of
SCOP domain families. Under this category a subtype of
special interest is Pfam families corresponding to SCOP
superfamilies. Some examples of this subtype are listed in
Table 3. For instance, the SCOP domain families c.107.1.1

(Manganese-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatase (family II))
and c.107.1.2 (Exonuclease RecJ family) each individually
map to the Pfam family DHH (DEE Family). Both of the
SCOP domains belong to the SCOP superfamily c.107.1
(DHH phosphoesterases). Another example is the Pfam
family Glyoxalase (Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/
Dioxygenase superfamily). The Pfam domain is independently mapped to the following four SCOP domain families: d.32.1.1 (Glyoxalase I (lactoylglutathione lyase)),
d.32.1.2 (Antibiotic resistance proteins), d.32.1.3 (Extradiol
dioxygenases), and d.32.1.4 (Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase).
These SCOP domains all belong to the SCOP superfamily
d.32.1 (Glyoxalase/Bleomycin resistance protein/Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase). From the Pfam annotation of the
Pfam family Glyoxalase, we see that Pfam seems to be
aware of it is a superfamily. But the flat organization of
Pfam fails to reflect this property explicitly. In this sense,
the comparative mapping between SCOP and Pfam could
help Pfam to build a hierarchical organization. On the
other hand, it is known that all SCOP classes higher than
7 are considered "not true SCOP classes" and their subtypes (folds, superfamilies, and families) are considered
not "true", either. We can utilize this type of mapping to
put those SCOP domains in meaningful classes. For example, the SCOP domain families c.96.1.1 (Fe-only hydrogenase) and i.4.1.1 (Electron transport chains) each
individually map to the Pfam family Fe_hyd_lg_C (Iron
only hydrogenase large subunit, C-terminal domain). It may
be inferred that the SCOP domain family i.4.1.1 is related
to SCOP superfamily c.96.1.
Combination of types
In many cases, a combination of several types is observed.
For example, the Pfam TCP-1/cpn60 chaperonin
(Cpn60.TCP1) family is mapped to two different sets of
SCOP domains, each consisting of a series of three
domains: {a.129.1.2 (Group II chaperonin (CCT, TRIC),
ATPase domain), d.56.1.2 (Group II chaperonin (CCT,
TRIC), intermediate domain), and c.8.5.2 (Group II chaperonin (CCT, TRIC), apical domain)} and {a.129.1.1 (GroEL
chaperone, ATPase domain), d.56.1.1 (GroEL-like chaperone,
intermediate domain), and c.8.5.1 (GroEL-like chaperone,
apical domain)}. These two sets of SCOP domains usually
occur together. However, the SCOP domain families
c.8.5.1 and c.8.5.2 are also each present on their own in
many PDB protein chains. This indicates that c.8.5.1 and
c.8.5.2 are each an independent, single domain. According to Aroul-Selvam et. al [22], this three domain set is
formed through two insertions as follows: a.129.1.1 and
a.129.1.2 are the parent domains, followed by the insertion of d.56.1.1 into a.129.1.1 and d.56.1.2 into
a.129.1.2. Finally c.8.5.1 is inserted into d.56.1.1, and
c.8.5.2 is inserted into d.56.1.2 (Figure 10). Members with
the domain organization of {a.129.1.2, d.56.1.2, c.8.5.2}
are the molecular chaperone GroEL and proteins with

similar functions. These proteins are known to have three
functional domains: equatorial (ATPase) domain, intermediate domain, and apical domain, each with its own
distinct function. The whole protein functions as a molecular chaperone, which binds unfolded polypeptides in
vitro, and has a weak ATPase activity. The apical domain is
involved in substrate binding. The equatorial domain
contains the nucleotide binding site and provides most of
the intersubunit contacts. The linker domain serves to
transmit allosteric effects between the other two domains.
Comparative mapping may help build Pfam clans
The Pfam database employs a flat organization, with a
'Type' annotation attached to each family. The annotation
is to some extent similar to levels in SCOP hierarchical
organization. Clans have been introduced in Pfam to
reflect the evolutionary relationship between different
families. Each clan contains two or more Pfam families

Page 13 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:77

that have arisen from a single evolutionary origin. However, Pfam release 14.0 contains only 15 clans covering
less than 100 Pfam families. With our comparative mapping results, the SCOP hierarchy may be used to help
Pfam generate the clans. For example, when one SCOP
domain family is mapped to sets of Pfam families, a
strong connection/relationship between those Pfam
domains may be implied. A clan may be inferred from
those Pfam families. Therefore, we compared our results
with the existing Pfam clans. Table 4 lists the member
families in existing Pfam clans and their corresponding
SCOP domains. We only list 10 rather than 15 because the
other five mostly contain Pfam families not used in the
comparison. As can been seen from the Table, members of
a clan usually correspond to a SCOP family or a SCOP
superfamily. Therefore, we believe the results from comparative mapping could potentially be helpful in building
Pfam clans.

Second, for each species, the orthologous protein
sequence with the highest E-value is selected (if a significant one exists). Third, ClustalW is then used to align
these sequences. Fourth, the Pearson correlation coefficient of those mapping matrices is computed with Equation 3, which represents the correlation between the
corresponding sequence pair.

Tan et. al have designed a tool to compute the similarities
between proteins' evolutionary histories [23]. This
approach can be slightly modified to fit our needs for
determining the similarities between domains' evolutionary histories. We define the evolutionary correlation
between two domains as the average correlation between
pairs of their member sequences. The correlation between
two sequence segments is then defined as the Pearson
correlation coefficient of the evolutionary distance
matrices of the two sequences. It is computed using the
following steps. First, Blastp is used to find the orthologous protein sequences in two sets of genomes; bacterial
and eukaryotic. The bacterial data set contains proteins
from the genomes of eighteen species: Acinetobacter sp
ADP1, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Nitrosomonas europaea,
Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus anthracis Ames, Geobacter
sulfurreducens, Pyrococcus abyssi, Xylella fastidiosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter hepaticus, Rickettsia conorii, Yersinia pestis KIM, Deinococcus radiodurans, Lactococcus lactis,
Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli K12, Methanosarcina
mazei, and Thermotoga maritima. The eucaryotic data set
contains genome protein sequences from nine species,
including Arabidopsis thaliana, Encephalitozoon cuniculi,
Plasmodium falciparum, Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

where N is the number of species where orthologous

The correlation between two domains is then expressed
as:

Phylogenetic analysis
Domains are considered evolutionarily independent
units, and the evolution history of each domain is
expected to be characteristic. Similar domain evolutionary
histories may indicate relations among domains. Therefore, we propose to use correlation in domain evolution
to validate the domain definitions by Pfam and SCOP in
the case of disagreement.

where abs (x) gives the absolute value of x, and Ni and Nj
are the number of member sequences for domains i and j,
respectively.
This correlation measures the relatedness of the two
domains. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means
100% similarity in the two domains' evolutionary histories and 0 means no similarity. Now we need to determine
the lower threshold of the correlation which indicates coevolution. We randomly select two Pfam families and
compute their correlation. Similarly, the random correlation between two SCOP domains is calculated. The distributions of the correlations are shown in Figure 11.
When multiple Pfam families are mapped to a SCOP
domain, we compute the evolutionary correlation of these
Pfam families. The correlation may suggest whether those
Pfam families should be merged or not. If two domains
reside on the same set of sequences in close vicinity and
share the same set of evolutionary characteristics, then we
propose those domains should be considered as coevolved and treated as a single, larger domain. Thus,
domain definitions may depend on the relative evolutionary histories.

Conclusion
In this paper, we discuss the comparative mapping of
structure-based domains to sequence-based domains in
order to address the question of how each of these models
individually captures the evolutionary, structural and
functional features of protein domains. The ultimate purpose of our comparative mapping is to provide insight
into protein domain definitions.

Distribution of correlations between two Pfam domains
Distribution of correlations between two Pfam domains. The Pfam families are randomly selected and their correlation is calculated as described in Section Phylogenetic Analysis. The correlation represents the relatedness of two domains. Its value ranges
from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating 100% similarity in the two domains' evolutionary histories and 0 no similarity. Genome protein
sequences from bacteria are used in the computation. About 76% of the domain pairs have a correlation less than 0.5.

Using domain definitions from SCOP and Pfam, we
mapped the two types of domain definitions to each other
using their location information for each domain
instance. Mapping results reveal a general agreement
between the two types of domain definitions. To further
analyze the problem, we introduce several subcategories
(one/many SCOP domain to one/many Pfam domain,
and vice versa), and provide detailed studies of the mapping using examples from each category.
In the subcategory of one SCOP to/from one Pfam mapping, often the mapping is not perfect: the two domains

only partially overlap. Analysis shows that around 62% of
the cases of one-to-one mapping agree on 90% or more of
their coverage. The differences are usually in the domain
boundaries. This result suggests that evolutionary history
of the mapped region versus the unmapped region may be
examined to see how those unmapped portions are evolutionarily related to the mapped region.
In many cases, a SCOP domain family is mapped to a
series of repeats of a Pfam family. These Pfam families,
such as LRR, are more likely domain components without
the properties of structural domains. Therefore, we would

Page 15 of 16

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:77

suggest Pfam remove those families. The mapping results
could also be used to infer classification for SCOP domain
families that do not belong to the true classes (classes
larger than 7). For example, in the cases that a set of SCOP
domains are mapped to one Pfam family, structural and
functional relationships are suggested among the set of
SCOP domains. This information may be useful for the
assignment of SCOP domains to true SCOP classes. On
the other hand, the Pfam database employs a flat organization and fails to indicate the relationship between Pfam
families. Although Pfam introduced clans to reflect the
relationship between different families, the building of
clans needs input from experts and as a result, there only
15 clans in Pfam release 14.0. Our comparison of the
mapping results with the Pfam clans showed that
members of a clan usually correspond to a SCOP family
or a SCOP superfamily.
Therefore, the comparative mapping results may be used
to help Pfam generate the clans. Perhaps most interesting,
several sharp disagreements between SCOP domain families and Pfam families have been discovered, and studied
in some detail. Further examination of those domain families using phylogenetic analysis would be beneficial. We
have proposed using evolutionary correlation between
domains to measure the fitness of the domain
classification. Clearly, further studies on these sharp differences are necessary and future research may be targeted
in this area.
