Abstract
Background: The ABCC5 gene encodes an organic anion pump of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter family, subclass C. The exact physiological function of ABCC5 however is not
known. Here, we have isolated three novel ABCC5 splice variants and characterized their role in
the regulation of ABCC5 gene expression.
Results: Two additional exons within intron 5 of the ABCC5 gene were identified; one of the
exons exhibits alternative donor splice sites. Differential usage of these exons generates three
short ABCC5 transcripts named ABCC5_SV1, ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3. The variants share
the first five exons with the ABCC5 gene but differ in their 3' sequences. ABCC5 and its novel
isoforms are abundantly expressed in the human retina. Splice variant ABCC5_SV1 and
ABCC5_SV2 contain premature stop codons. While inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay
selectively stabilized ABCC5_SV1 but not ABCC5_SV2, the amount of full length ABCC5 mRNA
was simultaneously reduced. A negative regulatory effect on full length ABCC5 expression was also
observed when the ABCC5 isoforms were silenced with siRNA duplexes. Finally, we show that the
evolutionarily conserved ABCC5_SV2 transcript is translated into a protein abundantly present in
endothelial cells of inner retinal blood vessels and along RPE membranes.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that alternative splicing of the ABCC5 gene has functional
consequences by modulating ABCC5 gene expression. In addition, at least one ABCC5 splice
variant is protein-coding and produces a truncated ABCC5 protein isoform with thus far unknown
functional properties in the retina.

Background
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral
membrane proteins which mediate the ATP-dependent
translocation of a wide variety of compounds across extraand intracellular membranes [1]. The substrate diversity
ranges from small inorganic ions, amino acids, peptides,
sugars, lipids, and anticancer drugs to large proteins. ABC

transporters are characterized by a basic modular architecture consisting of two membrane spanning segments and
two intracellular nucleotide binding domains with
Walker motifs A and B and an ATP-binding cassette signature [1].

Based on protein sequence homology and phylogenetic
analyses, the 56 mammalian ABC transporters have been
classified into seven subfamilies with the closely related
multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) grouped together in
the C branch of ABC proteins (ABCC). ABCC5 (MRP5) is
a typical organic anion pump and belongs to the short
type of ABCC proteins which differ from the long type by
the lack of an N-terminal transmembrane domain [2]. In
vitro transport studies identified ABCC5 as a cellular
export pump for numerous compounds including cGMP
[3], nucleoside monophosphate analogs [e. g. [4,5]],
heavy metal compounds and fluorochromes [6]. ABCC5transfected cells were also reported to exhibit resistance to
anticancer and antiviral drugs [5,7]. The affinity of ABCC5
to its substrates, however, has generally been low. This
suggests that the biological significance of ABCC5 as a
mediator of active cGMP efflux, its possible role in drug
resistance and ultimately its physiological function is still
unknown.
Previous mRNA expression studies showed that the
ABCC5 gene is widely transcribed among human tissues
with highest levels in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, kidney
and testis [6,8]. Multiple mRNA species for various ABCC
family members have been described [9,10] including the
ABCC5 locus [6]. Sequencing of a single cDNA clone from
a human lung cancer cell line identified a splice variant of
ABCC5 formed by the alternative usage of a cryptic donor
splice site upstream of exon 11 [11]. This so-called short
type of multidrug resistance protein homologue (SMRP)
translates into an N-terminally truncated version of
ABCC5 (946 versus 1437 amino acids) and shows a similar expression pattern as the full length ABCC5 transcript
[12]. The physiological relevance of the rare SMRP transcript is not known.
In this study we have characterized three novel isoforms
of the ABCC5 gene generated by alternative splicing of
newly identified exons within intron 5 of the ABCC5
gene. The various ABCC5 transcripts are abundantly
expressed in the human retina but are also present in
many other tissues at varying levels. We provide evidence
that alternative splicing of the ABCC5 mRNA may provide
an elegant mechanism to achieve a tissue-dependant regulation of ABCC5 gene expression.

Results
Cloning of three novel ABCC5 isoforms
Large-scale sequencing of a human retinal cDNA library
[13] revealed two small cDNA clones, 6D2F (160 bp) and
A06-Ret7 (171 bp), located within intron 5 of the ABCC5
gene (Fig. 1A). Subsequent BlastN database queries [14]
revealed the retinal sequences to correspond to the 3' end
of three overlapping full length cDNA clones isolated
from cancer cells and placenta [GenBank: BC050744,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/42

CR590924 and CR619835]. After assembly, the human
mRNA sequences from GenBank comprise the first five
exons of the ABCC5 gene spliced to two alternative exons
within intron 5 of the ABCC5 gene, named exon 5A and
5B (Fig. 1A). To further explore the existence of novel
ABCC5 splice variants in retina, we performed RT-PCR on
human retinal RNA with primers located in exon 5 and
exon 5B. Three distinct PCR products of 203, 275 and 353
base pairs (bp) were repeatedly amplified (Fig. 1B). Direct
sequencing of the PCR products showed that the two
smaller fragments differ by the inclusion of exon 5A. In
addition, the usage of an alternative splice donor
sequence produces a larger exon 5A (termed exon 5Aa)
giving rise to the 353 bp fragment (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR with
primers located in exon 5 (F1) and exon 6 (R1) amplified
a single 267 bp fragment lacking exon 5A, 5Aa or 5B (data
not shown) indicating that the newly identified exonic
sequences represent the respective 3'-ends of novel
ABCC5 splice variants ABCC5_SV1 (2010 bp) [GenBank:AY754874], ABCC5_SV2 (1933 bp) [GenBank:AY754875]
and
ABCC5_SV3
(1858
bp)
[GenBank:AY754876] (Fig. 1B). This is confirmed by the
presence of a potential consensus polyadenylation signal,
AATAAA, within 15 bases of the 3' end of exon 5B. Translation of the putative ABCC5_SV1, ABCC5_SV2 and
ABCC5_SV3 mRNA sequences revealed stop codons in
exon 5Aa, exon 5A and exon 5B, respectively (Fig. 1B).
This should lead to putative truncated ABCC5 proteins
which share the 197 N-terminal amino acids with the full
length ABCC5 transporter and terminate in short distinct
C-termini of 15 (ABCC5_SV1), 11 (ABCC5_SV2) and 28
(ABCC5_SV3) amino acids in length.
Nucleotide homology searches using the novel ABCC5
exons as templates showed that the sequence and the
flanking splice junctions of exon 5A are highly conserved
between mammalian species (e.g. 100% sequence identity to monkey/cow and 98% identity to mouse/dog).
Analysis of EST sequences from different species confirmed that exon 5A is commonly spliced to exon 5
whereas each species uses different donor splice sites to
join exon 5A to downstream sequences within intron 5 of
the ABCC5 gene. Thus, sequences overlapping but not
identical to human exon 5B are frequently included in
alternative transcripts. The presence of ABCC5 splice variants with additional exons within intron 5 of the ABCC5
gene appears to be a common feature among mammalian
species possibly indicating a conserved function of these
molecules.
Expression analysis
Qualitative RT-PCR analysis revealed varying transcription levels of the novel splice variants in human retina
with an increase of expression from ABCC5_SV1 to
ABCC5_SV3 (Fig. 1B). The tissue distribution of the novel

Cloning 1 ABCC5 splice variants
Cloning of ABCC5 splice variants. (A) Identification of exon 5A, 5Aa and 5B within intron 5 of the ABCC5 gene. Exons of
the ABCC5 gene are shown as open boxes, the retinal cDNA fragments as solid boxes. The mRNAGenBank represents a cDNA
assembled from three human mRNA sequences deposited in GenBank [BC050744, CR590924 and CR619835]. The locations
of primers used to PCR amplify ABCC5 cDNA fragments and the start and stop codon of full length ABCC5 are indicated by
solid triangles above. Numbers refer to the respective exon number. The vertical line in exon 5Aa indicates an alternative
splice donor site (B) Differential splicing of exons 5A, 5Aa and 5B generates three ABCC5 isoforms in the human retina,
termed ABCC5_SV1, ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3. RNA from human retina was RT-PCR amplified with primer pair F1/R3.

ABCC5 splice variants was studied by virtual Northern
blot analysis with a radiolabeled probe representing exon
5B. A single strong band of approximately 2.0 kb was
detected exclusively in retina but not in bladder, heart,
lung, skeletal muscle and RPE (Fig. 2A). To further investigate the relative expression of the splice variants, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) with primer pairs
specific for each of the ABCC5 transcripts was performed
with RNA extracted from ten human tissues including
samples from three distinct brain areas (Fig. 2B). An overall abundant expression of ABCC5 and the shorter ABCC5
isoforms was observed in human neural retina. In addition, full length ABCC5 is expressed at moderate levels in
several tissues including brain, RPE, bladder and heart. A
relatively high expression in RPE, bladder and stomach
was found for ABCC5_SV2 whereas ABCC5_SV1 and
ABCC5_SV3 are only weakly present in nonneuronal tissues. Moderate expression of ABCC5_SV1 and
ABCC5_SV3 was detected in cerebellum. Taken together,
our data show that each tissue analyzed expresses the var-

ious ABCC5 transcripts but at distinct levels suggesting a
complex regulation of gene expression.
Nonsense mediated decay of ABCC5 isoforms
A stop codon which resides over 50–55 nucleotides
upstream from a downstream exon/exon junction is predicted to be recognized by the translational machinery as
a premature termination codon (PTC) and thus should be
targeted by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [15].
Splice variant ABCC5_SV1 contains a stop codon 104 bp
upstream of the exon 5Aa/5B splice junction fulfilling the
criteria for a PTC. To determine whether the ABCC5_SV1
mRNA is subject to NMD we inactivated the NMD surveillance mechanism by the addition of translation inhibitors
puromycin, or alternatively anisomycin, [16] to human
cell lines ARPE-19 and Y79 which were shown before to
express ABCC5, ABCC5_SV1, ABCC5_SV2 and
ABCC5_SV3 (data not shown). By qRT-PCR, puromycin
treatment drastically increased the relative expression of
ABCC5_SV1 mRNA by almost 3-fold in the ARPE-19 cell

line and by more than 2-fold in the Y79 cell line (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, in both cell lines the expression of the
ABCC5 transcript decreased by a factor of approximately
two. In contrast, the relative expression levels of
ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3 remained unaffected by the
addition of the translation inhibitors. The concentration
of the mRNAs largely returned to pre-treatment levels after
protein synthesis was restored by removing puromycin
from the media. Similar to the treatment with puromycin,
application of anisomycin lead to a 2- and 4-fold increase
of ABCC5_SV1 mRNA in Y79 and ARPE-19 cells, respectively, whereas the levels of the remaining ABCC5 transcript variants were stable (ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3)
or decreased (ABCC5) (data not shown). Together, these
data demonstrate that inhibition of cellular protein synthesis leads to a selective stabilization of the ABCC5_SV1
mRNA indicating that this transcript is regulated by NMD.
In addition, elevated levels of ABCC5_SV1 mRNA appear
to regulate ABCC5 gene expression without exerting any
effects on the remaining short ABCC5 isoforms.

Silencing of the novel ABCC5 isoforms by RNA
interference
To further investigate whether the expression of the various ABCC5 transcripts may be co-regulated, ABCC5_SV1,
ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3 were silenced by RNA interference. Consequently, treatment of ARPE-19 cells with an
siRNA probe targeted to exon 5B (siRNA.1) decreased the
expression of ABCC5_SV1, ABCC5_SV2 and ABCC5_SV3
up to 80% while the expression of ABCC5 increased 1.5fold over time (Fig. 4A). A similar rise in ABCC5 expression was observed when ABCC5_SV1 and ABCC5_SV2
expression was selectively suppressed by siRNA.2 (Fig.
4B). The level of ABCC5_SV3 essentially remained unaffected. siRNA probes to specifically target ABCC5_SV1
without affecting the other two isoforms were designed,
but consistently failed to reveal a measurable knock down
effect of ABCC5_SV1 expression (data not shown). From
our results we conclude that ABCC5 mRNA expression is
differentially regulated by the presence of one or more
short ABCC5 splice variants, most likely by ABCC5_SV1
and/or ABCC5_SV2.

ments. Preadsorption of SV2-304 with GST-ABCC5_SV2
fusion protein completely abolished the immunostaining
in the mouse retina (Fig. 5C) indicating that the labelling
is specific. In the RPE, a tissue with high ABCC5_SV2 transcription (Fig. 2B), SV2-304 antibodies produced markedly staining of the apical and basolateral surfaces with
exclusion of the RPE microvilli (Fig. 5E).

ABCC5 splice variants. The expression values for each variant are depicted by different symbols and are given relative

Localization of ABCC5_SV2 in the retina
The most C-terminal 11 amino acid peptide specifically
encoded by the ABCC5_SV2 isoform appears highly conserved in a number of mammalian species suggesting a
functional constraint on this sequence (Fig. 5A). To investigate whether ABCC5_SV2 indeed is expressed as a short
ABCC5 protein isoform, we generated polyclonal antibodies (SV2-304) directed against its unique 11 amino
acid terminus. Immunofluorescence labeling of frozen
mouse retinal sections with purified SV2-304 antibodies
repeatedly produced strong staining of endothelial cells of
the inner retinal capillaries (Fig. 5B, arrows). Weaker but
distinct labelling was also observed in the synapses of the
outer plexiform layer and the photoreceptor outer seg-

Here we characterize three short ABCC5 splice variants
which consist of sequences corresponding to the first 5
exons of the ABCC5 gene but revealing distinct 3' ends.
The isoforms are generated by the inclusion of one or two
novel exons within intron 5 of the ABCC5 gene and the
alternative usage of donor splice sites in one of these
exons. In-frame translation of the additional exons introduces stop codons, thus generating unique C-termini.
Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that
both, the full length ABCC5 transcript and the shorter
ABCC5 splice variants are present at varying levels in a
number of tissues while all are predominantly expressed
in the human retina. Although ABCC5 mRNA expression
has repeatedly been found in neurons of the CNS [6,8],
this is the first report of ABCC5 being expressed in the
neurosensory retina. ABCC5 can therefore be added to the
list of abundant ABC transporters with a function in the
eye which for example includes ABCA4, the gene underlying Stargardt's disease [17] and ABCC6, the gene implicated in pseudoxanthoma elasticum [18,19]. So far, a role
for ABCC5 in retinal disease has not been determined.
Genome-wide analyses have led to the suggestion that
alternative splicing affects the vast majority of genes in
many organisms [20,21]. EST-based studies indicated a
particularly high level of alternative splicing in neuronal
tissues including the retina [22]. The high fraction of
splice variants among retinal cDNAs are reflected in
numerous reports of alternatively spliced retinal genes [e.
g. [13,23]]. Moreover, retina-specific mRNA processing
has been reported for genes with a broader tissue distribution [24,25]. The retina is a multilayered tissue composed
of a number of distinct cell types that are specialized in
their function to transform light energy into electric signals. Alternative splicing is regarded an important mechanism to create protein diversity but also to regulate gene
expression [26]. Both processes may well be required to
perform and control the complex phototransduction
process in the retina and also to establish and maintain
the structure and integrity of this unique and highly
evolved tissue.
Our results on the functional role of alternatively spliced
products of the ABCC5 gene in the retina demonstrate
that one isoform, ABCC5_SV1, is a target for NMD. NMD
is a post-transcriptional surveillance mechanism in

taining exons of the ABCC4 gene produces mRNAs that
are degraded by NMD [10]. Regulation of ABCC4 gene
expression is thought to be accomplished by facilitating
the re-initiation of translation. As a consequence shorter
ABCC4 proteins lacking a potentially important aminoterminal linker domain would be generated.

eukaryotic cells used to eliminate newly synthesized
mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs)
[15,27]. NMD targets which may be generated by mutations or errors in mRNA processing are potentially harmful and need to be cleared. In contrast, alternative splicing
to induce NMD is a widely used mechanism for gene regulation, also known as regulated unproductive splicing
and translation (RUST) [28]. Our data obtained from
NMD inactivation and confirmed by RNA interference
show that the expression level of full length ABCC5 transcript is influenced by the presence of alternatively spliced
ABCC5 isoforms, in particular ABCC5_SV1. RUST therefore may play a role in ABCC5 gene regulation.
Alternative splicing of genes encoding ABC transporters
has previously been reported [9,10,29]. Noticeably, alternative splicing of two evolutionarily conserved PTC-con-

The newly identified ABCC5 splice variants encode putative proteins with isoform-specific C-termini that are predicted to be cytosolic. We have generated an antiserum
directed against the conserved ABCC5_SV2 isoform which
specifically labels the endothelial cells of blood vessels in
the inner mouse retina as well as apical and basolateral
surfaces of the RPE. This indicates that in addition to gene
regulation, alternative splicing of the ABCC5 gene may be
a mechanism to increase protein diversity. A polyclonal
antibody directed against the C-terminus of the ABCC5
transporter has been widely used to determine the tissue
distribution of ABCC5 in several organs. Among other cell
types, this antibody strongly stains capillary endothelial
cells in the genitourinary tract [30], in the heart [31] and
in the brain [32]. In brain, a contribution of ABC transporters including ABCC5 to the blood-brain barrier is discussed [32]. Similarly, the ABCC5_SV2 isoform could play
a role in the inner and outer blood-retinal barrier function
possibly by controlling ABCC5 transporter activity.

Conclusion
Here we show that alternative splicing plays a role in the
regulation of ABCC5 gene expression via NMD-related
mechanisms. In addition, we present evidence that at least
one of the ABCC5 splice variants encodes a functional
protein localized to the endothelial cells of the inner retinal blood supply and along RPE membranes. Further
studies are needed to determine the precise function of
ABCC5 and its regulatory as well as protein-encoding isoforms in the retina. This may also shed light onto a possible contribution of ABCC5 to retinal disease.

The human total RNA master panel including RNAs from
21 different human tissues was purchased from BD Biosciences. RNA from post-mortem retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was isolated using the RNeasy
Total RNA System Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was
generated from RNA samples by reverse transcription
using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and served as a template
for subsequent PCR assays. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) was performed as described previously

were calculated based on four human housekeeping genes
(B2M, TBP, SDHA and HPRT) which displayed a stable
expression in all tissues. These factors were then used to
determine the relative normalized expression values of
the ABCC5 transcript variants. All samples were analyzed
in triplicate.

The RPE cell line ARPE-19 was cultured in DMEM/Ham's
F12 (1:1 mixture) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine,
15 mM HEPES, 42 mM NaHCO3 and 10% FCS. The retinoblastoma cell line Y79 was grown in DMEM containing
10% FCS. In both cell lines protein synthesis was inhibited by addition of 100 μg/ml puromycin or 100 μg/ml
anisomycin (Invitrogen) for 2 hours. The cells were
washed with PBS and transferred to medium without antibiotics for another 4 hours. Total RNA was then extracted
as described above.

1:800 for 1 h. Labeled sections were washed in 0.1 M PB,
mounted (Confocal Matrix) and examined under an Axioskop-2 mot plus fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). To
evaluate the specificity of the SV2_304 antibody, 100 μl of
diluted purified antibody was preadsorbed for 4 hours
with 100 μg of GST-ABCC5_SV2 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 3 minutes and the supernatants were
used for immunohistochemistry as described above.

Authors' contributions
