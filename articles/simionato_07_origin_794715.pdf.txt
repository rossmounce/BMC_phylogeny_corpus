Abstract
Background: Molecular and genetic analyses conducted in model organisms such as Drosophila
and vertebrates, have provided a wealth of information about how networks of transcription
factors control the proper development of these species. Much less is known, however, about the
evolutionary origin of these elaborated networks and their large-scale evolution. Here we report
the first evolutionary analysis of a whole superfamily of transcription factors, the basic helix-loophelix (bHLH) proteins, at the scale of the whole metazoan kingdom.
Results: We identified in silico the putative full complement of bHLH genes in the sequenced
genomes of 12 different species representative of the main metazoan lineages, including three nonbilaterian metazoans, the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata and the
demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. We have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of
the 695 identified bHLHs, which has allowed us to allocate most of these bHLHs to defined
evolutionary conserved groups of orthology.
Conclusion: Three main features in the history of the bHLH gene superfamily can be inferred
from these analyses: (i) an initial diversification of the bHLHs has occurred in the pre-Cambrian,
prior to metazoan cladogenesis; (ii) a second expansion of the bHLH superfamily occurred early in
metazoan evolution before bilaterians and cnidarians diverged; and (iii) the bHLH complement
during the evolution of the bilaterians has been remarkably stable. We suggest that these features
may be extended to other developmental gene families and reflect a general trend in the evolution
of the developmental gene repertoires of metazoans.

Background
The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein superfamily
constitutes an ancient class of eukaryotic transcription factors that are found in fungi, plants and metazoans [1,2].
The bHLH transcription factors are named after their
highly conserved domain (about 60 amino acids long)
that consists of a DNA-binding basic region (b) followed
by two α-helices separated by a variable loop region
(HLH) [1]. Interaction between the helix regions of two
different proteins leads to the formation of homodimeric
or heterodimeric complexes, and the basic region of each
partner recognizes and binds to a core hexanucleotide
DNA sequence. Many bHLH proteins also include additional domains that are important for their activity as
transcriptional regulators, such as 'leucine zipper', 'PAS' or
'orange' domains, which are mainly involved in proteinprotein interactions [3-5]. In unicellular eukaryotes, such
as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, bHLH proteins mainly regulate
metabolic pathways [1,6]. In contrast, in metazoans and
plants, the bHLH proteins are mainly involved in controlling developmental processes, in regulating the cell cycle,
and in sensing environmental signals [1,2,7,8].
Because of the important functions that they display in
various organisms, bHLH proteins have been the subject
of a number of studies aimed at the identification of their
full complement encoded by completely sequenced
genomes. The putative full set of genes encoding bHLH
proteins ('bHLH genes') has been reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8 bHLH genes), Drosophila melanogaster
(58), Caenorhabditis elegans (39), Homo sapiens (125),
Ciona intestinalis (46), Arabidopsis thaliana (118 to 147),
and Oryza sativa (131 to 167) [4,6,9-16]. In most of these
studies, phylogenetic analyses of the amino acid
sequences of the bHLHs were used to define orthologous
families (that is groups of genes that derive from a common ancestor). In addition, these phylogenetic studies
have enabled the definition of higher-order groups
(named A, B, C, D, E and F) within the bHLH superfamily,
which comprise evolutionarily related families of
orthologs that share structural and biochemical properties
[1,2,4,17,18]. In brief, groups A and B include bHLH proteins that bind core DNA sequences referred to as E boxes
(CANNTG); respectively CACCTG or CAGCTG (group A)
and CACGTG or CATGTTG (group B). Group C corresponds to the families of bHLH proteins known as
'bHLH-PAS', as they contain a 'PAS' domain in addition to
the bHLH. They bind to ACGTG or GCGTG core
sequences. Group D corresponds to HLH proteins that
lack a basic domain and are hence unable to bind DNA.
These proteins act as antagonists of group A bHLH proteins. Group E includes proteins related to the Drosophila
Hairy and Enhancer of split bHLH (HER) proteins. These
proteins bind preferentially to sequences referred to as N
boxes (CACGCG or CACGAG). Most group E proteins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

also contain two characteristic domains in addition to the
bHLH, the 'orange' domain and a WRPW peptide in their
carboxyterminal part. Group F corresponds to the COE
proteins, which lack a basic domain and are characterized
by the presence of an additional domain, the COE
domain, involved in both dimerization and DNA binding. Yeast and plant bHLHs are all included in group B [2].
Based on the analysis of the putative full-set of bHLH
genes from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans,
and Homo sapiens, we previously defined 44 orthologous
families that include most of these bHLHs [4,11]. Of
these, 43 include genes from Homo sapiens, and Drosophila
melanogaster and/or Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that
these families were already present in the last common
ancestor of these three species, thus of all bilaterians. This
study led us to conclude that the diversification of the
bHLH complement independently occurred in metazoans
and plants and might have been related to the acquisition
of multicellularity [11]. In the present study, we identified
the putative full set of bHLHs encoded by several newly
sequenced genomes of species representative of the main
metazoan evolutionary lineages (Figure 1). Of special
interest, we obtained data from three non-bilaterian species, two cnidarians and a demosponge, providing us with
the opportunity to study the early evolutionary history of
the bHLH superfamily in metazoans. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of these bHLHs allows us to conclude
that (i) most of the bHLH bilaterian families of orthologs
are present in cnidarians; (ii) only a few families are
present in a demosponge species; (iii) the number of represented bHLH families of orthologs is remarkably similar
in the different bilaterian lineages. We propose an evolutionary scenario in which the diversity of metazoan
bHLHs has been established in two main steps, one during the early evolution of metazoans, before the divergence of demosponges from other metazoans, and the
second, later, after this split but before the divergence of
cnidarians and bilaterians.

Results
Derivation of the putative full set of bHLH genes of 12
metazoan species
We first developed a list of bHLH genes encoded by the
three genomes (Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Homo sapiens) we had previously studied [4,11],
using the current version of their genome assembly (Figure 1, additional file 1). While we found the same 39
bHLHs as in our previous study in Caenorhabditis elegans,
we identified, in Drosophila melanogaster, one additional
bHLH as compared to our published analysis, raising the
total number of Drosophila bHLHs to 59. In Homo sapiens,
our previous study was made on a draft assembly of the
genome and a few bHLH genes that we identified cannot
be found in the current assembly or correspond to pseu-

Phylogenetic relationships between the species used in this study
Phylogenetic relationships between the species used in this study. The tree is based on the current view of the phylogeny of the metazoans [73,74]. The total number of bHLHs and the number of represented bHLH metazoan families of
orthologs in each genome is indicated. For the number of represented families, a range is indicated for most species, due to the
uncertainty about the presence of some families in these species (see additional file 1 for details). The names of representative
phylogenetic groups are indicated on the left of the nodes that define these different groups and along some of the terminal
branches. The Ciona intestinalis data come from [12] and have not been reanalysed in this study.

dogenes. We found a total number of 118 bHLH genes in
the current assembly of the genome of Homo sapiens.
We then used the sequences of all the bHLHs from Homo
sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster to identify, through
similarity searches using BLAST algorithm, the bHLHs
encoded in the genomes of 9 additional species, the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica (formerly named
Reniera sp.), the cnidarians Hydra magnipapillata (a hydrozoan) and Nematostella vectensis (an anthozoan), the
annelid Capitella sp. I (formerly known as Capitella capitata), the mollusk Lottia gigantea, the arthropods Daphnia
pulex (a crustacean) and Tribolium castaneum (an insect),
the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the
chordate Branchiostoma floridae (a cephalochordate).
These species were chosen because, together with the four
metazoan species in which the putative full set of bHLHs
has been previously determined (Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Ciona intestinalis, and Homo sapiens;
[4,11,12]), they provide a significant coverage of the main
metazoan evolutionary lineages. The phylogenetic relationships between these species and the total number of
bHLHs that have been found for each species are shown
in Figure 1. Additional informations about the studied
species and the status of the corresponding genome
projects can be found in additional file 2. We identified a
total number of 695 bHLH genes in the 12 aforementioned species. All the identified sequences can be found
in additional file 3. In most cases, we were able to retrieve
the complete bHLH domain. Given our extensive
searches, we are confident that we obtained a significant
coverage of the bHLH genes present in the genomes of all
the studied species. We have used this very rich sampling
of metazoan bHLH genes to better understand the evolution of this superfamily through phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses of the bHLH genes
Carrying out evolutionary analyses of multigene families
requires that orthologs, which have evolved by vertical
descent from a common ancestor, are distinguished from
paralogs, which arise by duplication and domain shuffling within a genome [19]. We therefore constructed phylogenetic trees to define metazoan families of orthologs.
Given the large number of sequences, we independently
analysed the sequences from the different species. We
made 9 different multiple alignments, each comprising all
the identified bHLHs from Homo sapiens and Drosophila
melanogaster plus those from one of the nine other species.
We also made two additional multiple alignments, one
with the bHLHs from Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster plus those from the two cnidarian species, Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata and the other
with the bHLHs from Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster plus those from the two arthropod species, Tribolium castaneum and Daphnia pulex. These alignments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

allowed the study of specific relationships of bHLHs
within cnidarians and arthropods. The multiple alignments were then used to construct phylogenetic trees. We
used four different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction: distance (neighbour-joining; NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian
inference (BI). In general, the phylogenetic trees obtained
by the different methods were congruent and displayed
very similar topologies.
These phylogenetic trees were then used to define families
of metazoan bHLH orthologs, using the same criterion as
in our previous studies. That is, we defined bHLH families
of orthologs as monophyletic groups which include
sequences from different species and whose monophyly is
consistent across the different phylogenetic methods and
supported by bootstrap values and posterior marginal
probabilities superior to 50% [4,11]. This criterion was
relaxed for the Mesp, Myc, and Hairy/E(spl) families as
discussed previously [4,11]. Genes that cannot be confidently assigned to any families (because for example their
inclusion in a given family is weakly supported or not
found in all the trees constructed by the different phylogenetic methods) are categorized as 'orphan' genes. The
results of our analysis are consistent with those we previously obtained by using only the sequences from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Homo
sapiens [11]. The additional sequences included in the
present study allowed us to define 2 additional metazoan
families of orthologs, Delilah and MyoRa and b previously grouped into the MyoR family (additional file 1).
We moreover grouped together two previously defined
bilaterian families of orthologs, Hairy and E(spl), into a
single one as there is no clear support for the monophyly
of either of these families in our current analysis (a
detailed phylogenetic study of these families will be published elsewhere). These analyses identified 45 metazoan
bHLH families of orthologs (see additional file 1 for the
full list and for the number of members in each species;
the data that have been used to construct additional file 1
and Figure 1 can be found in additional files 4 to 15,
where each file corresponds to one species and contains a
table with all the bHLHs from this species, the family to
which each bHLH belongs, and the statistical support for
its inclusion in the corresponding family in the trees constructed using the four different phylogenetic methods).
In the case of the bilaterian species, at the exclusion of
Caenorhabditis elegans (in which the bHLH complement
is much derived; [11]), we were able to confidently allocate most of the bHLHs (more than 90%) to defined
metazoan families of orthologs (additional file 1). In
addition, we found, in each species, at least one member
for most families (39 to 44 of the 45 families), confirming
the very good coverage of the bHLH genes present in the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:33

genome of these species (Figure 1, additional file 1). This
also confirms one of the main conclusions of our previous
work, the fact that most bHLH families were already
present in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of all
bilaterians (see Discussion) [11].
In the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata, we found 68 and 33 bHLHs, respectively. The
majority of these bHLHs could be clearly allocated to the
families defined by bilaterian bHLHs (about 90% for
Nematostella vectensis and about 70% for Hydra magnipapillata). The presence of cnidarian members for many families (Figure 1, additional file 1) indicates that these
families were already present in the last common ancestor
of cnidarians and bilaterians, the so-called Ureumetazoa.
However, a significant proportion (10% to 33%) of the
cnidarian bHLHs could not be confidently allocated to
the defined families by our phylogenetic analyses. Most of
these problematic bHLHs nevertheless belong to the
higher-order group A (13/16 in Nematostella vectensis, 8/
11 in Hydra magnipapillata) and tend to be associated with
one or several group A families (especially to those families comprising the so-called Twist and Atonal superfamilies; [11]), albeit with low statistical support (Figure
2, additional files 13 and 14). As these families are also
often lacking a clear cnidarian member (Figure 2, additional file 1), this suggests that the aforementioned 'problematic' cnidarian bHLHs may be divergent members of
these families. Alternatively, these genes may constitute
cnidarian specific families, as we observed monophyletic
groups of Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata
genes (Figure 2, additional files 13 and 14). These monophyletic cnidarian-only families may be ancestral bHLH
families of orthologs that have been lost in bilaterians or
families that have been established in the cnidarian lineage after the divergence between cnidarians and bilaterians. The second scenario implies that the bHLHs from the
higher-order group A have undergone partially independent diversifications in cnidarians and bilaterians.
We identified 16 bHLH genes in the genome of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. In addition to the
phylogenetic analysis of their bHLH domains, we assembled complete genes from the whole genome shotgun
traces in order to detect potential additional domains that
may help in the identification of the genes (see additional
file 16 for gene assemblies). From these analyses, we were
able to clearly assign 8 of the Amphimedon queenslandica
bHLHs to previously defined bHLH eumetazoan families
of orthologs (Figure 3; additional files 1 and 15), 5 from
the high-order goup B (Myc, Max, MITF, SREBP, and AP4),
1 from the group A (E12/E47), one from the group E
(Hey), and one from the group F (Coe). Two other
Amphimedon queenslandica genes may be members of the
group B USF and group C Clock families. Although the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

statistical support for their inclusion in these families was
weak, we found an additional conserved region in the predicted genes whose presence supports their inclusion in
the aforementioned families (additional file 15). Two
other Amphimedon queenslandica bHLHs were strongly
associated to more than one family, one to the ARNT and
Bmal families and the other to the Hif, Sim, and Trh families (Figure 3, additional file 15). As the ARNT and Bmal
families, and the Hif, Sim, and Trh families form well-supported monophyletic groups within the bHLH superfamily (Figure 3) [4,11], these Amphimedon queenslandica
genes may be therefore single genes that are orthologous
to several families in eumetazoans, i.e. correspond to an
ancestral situation before the duplications that have lead
to the families found in the Eumetazoa. A somewhat similar situation was found for three other Amphimedon
queenslandica genes, with two closely-related genes being
associated with the ASCa and ASCb families and one tending to be associated with the Atonal and Twist superfamilies (Figure 3, additional file 15).
Nematostella-specific duplications of bHLH genes
We have found that Nematostella vectensis has a high
number of bHLH genes (68), higher than that of most of
the bilaterian species we have studied (Figure 1). This
large number of bHLHs in Nematostella vectensis is partially because many of the metazoan families of orthologs
have more than one member in this species (about 30%
of the families; additional file 1), while in most other species (with the exception of Homo sapiens), families with
more than one member are rare (mean value is 13%;
range 6% to 19%). This suggests that some of the Nematostella vectensis bHLH genes have been produced through
lineage-specific duplications, as has also been suggested
for homeobox genes in this species [20-22]. We therefore
examined potential linkages between the different Nematostella vectensis bHLH genes that belong to families with
more than one member (including the groups of 'orphan'
bHLHs which significantly cluster together; Figure 2),
using the recently available genome assembly. We identified 7 physical clusters of 2 to 5 bHLH genes without putative intervening genes and 2 additional clusters with one
or two intervening genes (Figure 4, additional file 17). We
therefore conclude that tandem duplications have had a
significant impact on the Nematostella vectensis bHLH repertoire, in a similar way to that which has been reported
for Nematostella vectensis homeobox genes [21,22].
bHLHs from non bilaterians do not cluster with those of
fungi
A recent report has shown that cnidarians may have
retained some ancestral eukaryotic genes that have been
lost in bilaterians [20]. We were interested to investigate
whether some of the 'orphan' cnidarian (and by extension
Amphimedon queenslandica) bHLHs may be such genes. We

Phylogenetic analysis of the cnidarian bHLHs related to the Twist and Atonal superfamilies
Figure 2
Phylogenetic analysis of the cnidarian bHLHs related to the Twist and Atonal superfamilies. The represented
tree is a NJ tree, which has been rooted using a human bHLH sequence from the MyoD family as an outgroup. This tree is
based on a multiple alignment that only includes the bHLH sequences of Drosophila melanogaster (in yellow) and Homo sapiens
(in orange) which constitute the families belonging to the Atonal and Twist superfamilies [11] and their relatives in Nematostella
vectensis (in light green) and Hydra magnipapillata (in dark green). The Atonal superfamily includes the Atonal, Neurogenin,
NeuroD, Net, Oligo, Beta3, Delilah, and Mist families; the Twist superfamily includes the Twist, Paraxis, Hand, PTFa, PTFb,
MyoRa, MyoRb, SCL, and NSCL families. Similar relationships (with similar statistical supports) were found when we used the
entire set of bHLH genes of these 4 aforementioned species. The different metazoan families of orthologs are indicated in blue.
Numbers above the internal branches are their statistical support values obtained with different methods of phylogenetic
reconstruction: first number = bootstrap support in neighbour-joining analysis (10,000 bootstrap replicates); second number =
bootstrap support in maximum-likelihood analysis (150 bootstrap replicates); third number = posterior probabilities in Bayesian inference-based analysis. Only statistical support values >50% are shown except for a few cases. Other internal branches
(with statistical support <50%) should be considered unreliable. Statistical supports for the existence of the different families
are shown in blue. We can see that 7 families (indicated by red asterisks) out of the 18 that are shown on this tree, have cnidarian members and that several cnidarian bHLHs cannot be assigned to any of these families. Some of these bHLHs form
monophyletic groups comprising sequences from either one or both of the two cnidarian species (indicated by dark green
numbers, from 1 to 6). Group 1 is comprised of only Nematostella vectensis sequences and groups 2 to 9 are comprised of at
least one representative from both Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata. Group 2 may correspond to Delilah genes,
group 3 to Oligo/Beta3/Mist genes, and group 4 to NeuroD/Neurogenin genes (see additional files 13 and 14 for more details).

bHLH (named Amq1 to Amq16) sequences (in blue) and one representative sequence (from Homo sapiens) for each of the bilaterian families of orthologs (in orange). Similar relationships (with similar statistical supports) are found when we used the
whole set of bHLHs genes from Homo sapiens. Numbers above the internal branches are as in Figure 2. We only show the statistical support for the internal branches that correspond to monophyletic groups concerning the Amphimedon queenslandica
bHLHs. Higher-order groups (A to F) are shown. The Amphimedon queenslandica bHLHs that can be assigned to a family are in
grey filled boxes (light grey denotes cases for which there is an uncertainty). Amphimedon queenslandica bHLHs that are associated with more than one family (and the concerned families) are in open black boxes. The single 'orphan' Amphimedon queenslandica bHLH is underlined.

therefore retrieved a large set of bHLHs from fungi, which
are among the closest relatives of eukaryotes (reviewed in
[23]) and for which many completely sequenced genomes
are available. We identified 98 bHLHs from 13 different
species as summarized in the additional file 18. We first
performed phylogenetic analyses on a multiple alignment
of these sequences with those of Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that the fungi bHLHs
form several fungi-specific families of orthologs that do
not include bilaterian genes (not shown). We nevertheless
noted that two of these families have a tendency to cluster
with the MITF and SREBP families but with very low statistical support (not shown). We then made multiple
alignments of the fungi bHLHs with those of Amphimedon
queenslandica or those of Nematostella vectensis and Hydra
magnipapillata; all analyses also included Drosophila
bHLHs (used here as representative of bilaterians). We did
not find any monophyletic groups that included both
fungi and cnidarian and/or sponge bHLHs (not shown).
We therefore conclude that the 'orphan' bHLHs from the
cnidarians and from Amphimedon queenslandica are probably not ancestral eukaryotic bHLHs that were lost in bilaterians.

Discussion
We report in this article the in silico identification of 695
putative bHLHs encoded by 12 sequenced metazoan
genomes. Our choice of species represents a significant

sampling of metazoan diversity, as we include representatives of the main metazoan evolutionary lineages (Figure
1). Our dataset therefore allows us to study the evolution
of the bHLH superfamily at the scale of the whole metazoan kingdom. This is, to our knowledge, the first time
that an entire gene superfamily has been studied at such a
large scale. We must however caution that our analysis has
probably not been carried out on a fully comprehensive
dataset of bHLHs sequences. In most cases, our search for
bHLH genes has been with unannotated genome assemblies or even on unassembled whole genome shotgun
reads. It is therefore possible that we may have missed
some bHLHs and/or that we may have included bHLH
domains from some pseudogenes. Nevertheless, these
data are sufficient for the purpose of this study, i.e. to
obtain a qualitatively accurate assessment of the metazoan bHLH complement and of its evolution within this
lineage.
Ancestrality and stability of the bHLH complement in
bilaterians
We determined the existence of 45 different metazoan
bHLH families of orthologs to which most bilaterian
bHLHs can be allocated (additional file 1). Of these 45
families, 44 contain members from both the protostomes
and deuterostomes. If we infer that every bHLH family
shared by protostomes and deuterostomes was represented by at least a single ancestral sequence in their last

Page 8 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:33

common ancestor, an inference consistent with the phylogenetic analyses, then this ancestor (Urbilateria) possessed at least 44 different bHLHs (Figure 5). Since this
ancestor which is estimated to have lived some 600–700
millions years ago [24,25], the bHLH complement in bilaterians is remarkably stable. Only a single new family of
orthologs (Figalpha) has been added in one of the bilaterian evolutionary lineages and very few families have been
lost (additional file 1). Indeed, with the exception of
Caenorhadditis elegans and Ciona intestinalis (the low
number of bHLHs found in these two species has been
already discussed; see [4,11,12] and references therein), a
quite similar number of represented families (ranging
from 38 to 44) is found across the Bilateria (Figure 1).
In contrast, the total number of bHLHs representing each
family of orthologs is much more variable between different species (ranging from 50 to 118). For example, Branchiostoma floridae has 28 bHLHs more than
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (78 versus 50) but each species has approximately the same number of families (44
versus 43). This difference in the total number of bHLHs
is due to the specific expansion of a few families in Branchiostoma floridae: Hairy/E(spl) and Hey (17 genes in Branchiostoma floridae versus 5 in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus);
MyoD (4 versus 2); MyoRa (4 versus 1); and PTFb (3 versus 1). Another significant example is that of Drosophila
melanogaster, which has more bHLHs than Daphnia pulex
(59 versus 57) but in which fewer families are represented
(39 versus 41). The larger number of bHLHs in Drosophila
melanogaster as compared to Daphnia pulex is mainly due
the expansion of one family, Hairy/E(spl) (11 or 12 versus
5 or 6). We can thus conclude that the number of bHLHs
found in a given species is a poor indicator of the diversity
of its bHLH complement, as some families of orthologs
have undergone species- or clade-specific expansions. This
holds true for Homo sapiens, although in this case most of
the families have undergone varying degrees of expansion; 36 of the 44 families (about 80%) have more than
one member in Homo sapiens while in other bilaterians the
mean value is about 18% (range 7% to 26%). The bHLH
complement in other vertebrates [[11]; unpublished
observations] is quite similar to that of Homo sapiens, indicating that an expansion of the bHLH complement
occurred at some early stage of vertebrate evolution, probably related to large-scale duplication events, possibly of
the whole genome (reviewed in [26]).
Cnidarian bHLHs: a complex ancestral complement,
lineage-specific duplications and losses
We have found that 29 to 33 of the 44 conserved bilaterian bHLH families of orthologs have cnidarian members
(Figure 1). Following the same reasoning as we used to
infer the minimal complement of bHLHs in Urbilateria,
we can therefore conclude that the last common ancestor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

of cnidarians and bilaterians (Ureumetazoa) possessed at
least 29 to 33 bHLHs (Figure 5). The estimate given here
for the bHLH complement of Ureumetazoa almost certainly represents an underestimate because (i) it is likely
that additional bHLHs will be found in the future (we
may have missed some genes due to the fact that our
searches were made within unfinished cnidarian genome
assemblies); (ii) some cnidarian sequences that were
included in this analysis could not be placed unambiguously into specific metazoan families of orthologs (and
may represent divergent members of additional ancestral
families); (iii) our analyses were done on the two cnidarian genomes available and we cannot exclude the possibility that some ancestral bHLHs may have been lost in
both species. Ureumetazoa therefore possessed a high
number and diversity of bHLHs, similar to that found in
bilaterians. Although initially surprising, this is fully consistent with recent studies performed on other gene families, which indicate a complex eumetazoan ancestral
complement, for example, of homeobox genes (at least
56; [22]) and Wnt genes (at least 11; [27]). Taken
together, we infer that Ureumetazoa possessed an elaborate complement of developmental genes and as such may
have been morphogenetically complex.
Besides these speculations on Ureumetazoa, what appears
clear is that cnidarians, and in particular anthozoans such
as Nematostella vectensis, are neither 'simple', nor 'primitive' organisms, as is still often assumed. Nematostella vectensis possesses 68 bHLHs, i.e significantly more than most
invertebrate bilaterians (Figure 1). Several recent studies
have shown that Nematostella vectensis also possesses 130
to 139 homeobox genes including probably 7 Hox genes
[21,22,28], 14 Sox (Sry-related HMG-box) genes [29], 15
Fox (Forkhead domain) genes [29], 12 WNT genes [27],
and 6 TGF-β genes and numerous antagonists of these
[30-32]. For several gene families, the number of genes
found in Nematostella vectensis is in fact higher than that
found in invertebrate models such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhbaditis elegans [21,22,27,33,34].
Interestingly, many of these genes are developmentally
expressed in Nematostella vectensis, and these patterns
show some similarities to those found in bilaterians (e.g.
[27-32]). So far, very few bHLH encoding genes have been
studied at the expression level in cnidarians [35,36]. It
would thus be of particular interest to study whether the
bHLH genes we have identified in Nematostella vectensis
and Hydra magnipapillata are expressed during development and how these expression patterns may be related to
those of their bilaterian counterparts.
It is also becoming clear, from this study and others, that
in both the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis and the
hydrozoan Hydra magnipapillata, several lineage specific
genomic modifications have occurred. As already men-

indicated. For the metazoans, we have represented their main subdivisions: the two probable monophyletic groups of
'sponges', the demosponges + hexactinellids, and the calcareous sponges; the cnidarians; and the two main groups of bilaterians, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. Last common ancestors of opisthokonts (Uropisthokonta), metazoans (Urmetazoa), eumetazoans (Ureumetazoa), and bilaterians (Urbilateria) are represented by black polygons. The minimal number of

number of families for the different higher-order groups present in each last common ancestor.

tioned, the high number of bHLHs encoded by the
genome of Nematostella vectensis is due to two factors, the
inheritance of numerous (about 30) bHLH genes from
Ureumetazoa ('ancestral complexity'), but also the expansion of some of the bHLH families through duplications
('lineage-specific duplications'). These two factors have
contributed to the high level of complexity of the Nematostella vectensis genome, as has been previously suggested
based on the analysis of a large set of expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) [20] and is now clearly confirmed for two large
multigenic superfamilies, the bHLH (this study) and the
homeobox [21,22,34]. For both superfamilies, the lineage-specific duplicates are often physically linked, suggesting that they have been produced by tandem
duplication, an apparently frequent event in the evolutionary lineage leading to Nematostella vectensis. It would
now be interesting to see whether the duplications found
in Nematostella vectensis are shared by other cnidarians.
This is clearly not the case in Hydra magnipapillata, where
only two metazoan families of orthologs (ASCa and Myc)
contain more than one member (additional file 1).
Although these families do also contain more than one
member in Nematostella vectensis, the bHLHs from the
ASCa and Myc families of the two cnidarians do not cluster in phylogenetic trees, suggesting independent duplications. Hydra magnipapillata has far fewer bHLHs than
Nematostella vectensis (33 versus 68), again a similar situation to that reported for the homeobox genes (53 versus
139) [21]. From our analysis, we can conclude that Hydra
magnipapillata has lost at least 11 ancestral types of bHLHs
(Mesp, Twist, Hand, SCL, Mnt, SREBP, Mlx, TF4, Clock,
Bmal, and Hey; additional file 1). By comparison, only a
single metazoan family of orthologs (Ahr) has a member
in Hydra magnipapillata but not in Nematostella vectensis,
therefore indicating that this family has been lost in
Nematostella vectensis (additional file 1). Loss of conserved
developmental genes may be a general trend in Hydra
magnipapillata, which could reflect a general simplification of the genome in this lineage.
The Amphimedon queenslandica bHLH complement
may reveal an intermediate step in the diversification of
bHLHs in metazoans
The number of bHLHs and the number of represented
families in Amphimedon queenslandica are markedly less
than those found in cnidarians and bilaterians (Figure 1).
This observation made on bHLHs can be extended to
most developmental gene superfamilies: the genome of
Amphimedon queenslandica encodes a considerable diversity of transcription factors and cell-cell molecules, but
displays fewer members for most orthologs than cnidarians and bilaterians [[37]; B.M.D. et al., unpublished
observations]. Prior to making any evolutionary interpretations from these observations, in particular in terms of
reconstruction of ancestral properties, we must caution

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

that (i) we only have data on one sponge species and we
can therefore not rule out the possibility that Amphimedon
queenslandica may have secondarily lost many genes (e.g.
as we observed in cnidarians for Hydra magnipapillata) and
(ii) the sponges represent a very complex and diversified
phyla that is probably paraphyletic [38-40]. Therefore
Amphimedon queenslandica (a demosponge from the Haplosclerida group) cannot be considered as representative
for all sponges. In particular, calcisponges may be the sister-group of eumetazoans (Figure 5) [38-40], (i.e. more
akin to eumetazoans than to the other sponges), and
might significantly differ, in terms of genomic content,
from demosponges such as Amphimedon queenslandica.
Demosponges themselves constitute a complex group
that is also probably not monophyletic. In particular the
homoscleromorphs do not clearly cluster with the other
demosponges in a recent analysis [41], and sponges from
this group possess eumetazoan-like ultrastructural features, including an epithelium characterized by closely
apposed cells with an underlying basement membrane
and regularly distributed cell-cell junctions [42]. Interestingly, a report of a set of ESTs from a homoscleromorph
species, Oscarella carmela, has been recently published
[43]. We have identified 4 bHLH genes in these ESTs, with
two corresponding to the Myc and Hey families also
found in Amphimedon queenslandica and two to the Mad
and Emc families for which no member can be found in
Amphimedon queenslandica (unpublished observations).
This highlights the importance for broad sampling of
sponges in future studies.
Keeping this in mind, we can nevertheless infer that the
last common ancestor of Amphimedon queenslandica and
eumetazoans, and thus probably that of all metazoans
(Urmetazoa) possessed a minimal number of 10 to 14
bHLHs (Figure 5). Indeed, we have found that 10 bHLH
orthologs do contain clear Amphimedon queenslandica
members (one member in each family; additional file 1),
indicating that these families are ancestral to metazoans.
In addition, 5 Amphimedon queenslandica bHLHs can be
related to several metazoan families of orthologs but cannot be confidently allocated to any of these families: one
to the ARNT and Bmal families; one to three different families (Hif, Sim, and Trh); one to many group A families,
which constitute the so-called Atonal and Twist superfamilies; and two to the ASCa and ASCb families (Figure
3; additional file 1). These data suggest that at least 4 additional bHLH families are ancestral to metazoans, raising
the probable minimal number of bHLHs of Urmetazoa to
14 (Figure 5).
Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that a number of
Amphimedon queenslandica bHLHs are related to more
than one eumetazoan bHLH family. Their relationships
with several families may either be a relic of an ancestral

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

situation that predates eumetazoan-specific duplications
or may be due to gene loss(es) that occurred in the evolutionary lineage leading to Amphimedon queenslandica (Figure 6). The second possibility seems to us less
parsimonious and not as convincing, as we have to
assume, in addition to the gene loss(es), that the single
remaining gene diverged, such that it cannot be allocated
with confidence to a recognized bHLH family, only to a
larger bHLH clade. We therefore favour the first hypothesis and suggest that the Amphimedon queenslandica bHLH
complement may represent an intermediate step in the
diversification of bHLHs and that some of the duplication
events required to generate the diversity of bHLHs found
in other metazoans have occurred after the split between
demosponges and the eumetazoans.

tal processes, such as neurogenesis and myogenesis (e.g.
[4,44] and references therein). Deciphering the expression
of the Amphimedon queenslandica relative would be therefore of particular interest. More generally, the reduced
number of bHLHs found in Amphimedon queenslandica
and the fact that gene expression analyses can be performed during the development of this species [37], offers
an altogether unique opportunity to study the different
functions assumed by this entire gene superfamily in a
non-eumetazoan species. Most of the bHLH genes that we
have been identified from the genome traces have now
been cloned from developmental cDNAs, indicating that
they are expressed during embryogenesis, and the analysis
of their expression patterns is currently being performed
[G.R and B.M.D, unpublished data].

Noteworthy, there is a single bHLH in Amphimedon
queenslandica (Amq1; additional file 15, Figure 3) that may
represent the prototype of the numerous atonal and twistrelated bHLHs found in eumetazoans, which are tissuespecific transcription factors involved in key developmen-

A general model for the diversification of the bHLH

The model is summarized in Figure 5. Our phylogenetic
analysis shows that there are no bHLH families of

Amphimedon queenslandica bHLHs that are associated with more than one bHLH family. We took, as an example,
the case of the ARNT and Bmal families. In Amphimedon queenslandica, there is a single bHLH that clusters with both families as
an outgroup to them (Figure 3). There are two main scenarios that can explain this situation. (A) The duplication that gives rise
to the two families occurred after the divergence between demosponges and the other metazoans. No duplication occurred in
Amphimedon queenslandica, which displays a single gene as in the ancestral situation. (B) The duplication that gives rise to the
two families occurred before the divergence between demosponges and the other metazoans. Amphimedon queenslandica displays a single gene because one of the duplicates was lost. The remaining gene became quite divergent in such a way that it cannot be confidently related to either of the two families.

indicating an independent diversification of the bHLH
complement in these two clades. The minimal number of
bHLH genes in the last common ancestor of fungi and
metazoans (Uropisthokonta) is therefore one. This single
bHLH was most likely from higher-order B, as all of the
fungi bHLHs are from this group (not shown). From our
analysis of the bHLHs from Amphimedon queenslandica, we
have inferred that the last common ancestor to all modern
metazoans (i.e. Urmetazoa) possessed at least 10–14 different bHLHs, including members from 5 of the 6 higherorder groups of bHLHs. We can therefore infer that a first
important expansion (both in terms of number and diversity) of the bHLH complement occurred after the divergence of fungal and metazoan lineages, but before the
divergence of demosponges from the other metazoans.
Although it is tempting to speculate that this expansion of
the bHLH complement (and probably of many other gene
families) has occurred in the early evolution of the metazoans and is related to the acquisition of multicellularity,
we cannot rule out that it might have occurred even earlier. Indeed, fungi do not appear to be the sister-group to
the Metazoa. There are other opisthokont eukaryotes
more closely related, in particular the choanoflagellates
[45]. Choanoflagellates are eukaryotes that share some
similarities with one of the most prominent cell-type of
sponges (the choanocyte) and are usually considered as
unicellular, although some of them display some sort of
multicellularity/colonialism [46]. It has been shown that
choanoflagellates express relatives of a number of cell and
adhesion protein families that have not previously been
isolated from nonmetazoans, including cadherins, C-type
lectins, several tyrosine kinases, and tyrosine kinase pathway components [47]. It is therefore possible that at least
part of the diversification of the bHLH complement might
have occurred in a common ancestor of the choanoflagellates and the metazoans. The completion of the genome
projects conducted on two choanoflagellate species, Monosiga brevicollis and Monosiga ovata, will help to address
this issue.
From our analysis of the bHLHs from the cnidarians
Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata, we have
inferred that the ureumetazoan genome contained at least
29–33 different bHLHs, with representatives from each of
the 6 higher-order groups of bHLHs. A second phase of
expansion of the bHLH complement has therefore
occurred after the demosponge lineage split from other
animals but before the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterians. As demosponges probably do not represent the
sister-group of the cnidarian + bilaterian clade, it would
be worthwhile to study the bHLH complement in organisms with an intermediate position between demosponges and eumetazoans, such as calcareous sponges and
ctenophores [38-40]. This second expansion particularly
concerned the group A bHLH families, which contain tis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

sue-specific transcription factors that control the determination, the specification and the differentiation of many
cell types in bilaterians. We therefore suggest that this second expansion of the bHLH complement can be correlated with the increase in the diversity of cell types that
occurred before eumetazoan cladogenesis.
Finally, a third phase of expansion, which almost exclusively concerns the group A bHLHs, may have occurred
after the divergence of cnidarians and other eumetazoans.
Indeed, there are several bHLH families of orthologs that
have bilaterian but not cnidarian members, and several
related cnidarian bHLHs that cannot be allocated to any
of the defined families (Figure 2). Although we cannot
rule out the possibility that the cnidarian bHLHs may be
derived members of the aforementioned bHLH families
of orthologs, the existence of these cnidarian 'orphan'
bHLHs may indicate an independent expansion of the
bHLH complement in bilaterian and cnidarian lineages.

Conclusion
In this study, we identified the putative full set of bHLHs
encoded by the newly sequenced genomes of 12 different
species representative of the main metazoan evolutionary
lineages, including three non bilaterian species, two cnidarians and a demosponge. Phylogenetic analysis of the
sequence of the 695 identified bHLHs allowed us to conclude that (i) a first diversification of the bHLH superfamily has occurred in the pre-Cambrian and prior to
metazoan cladogenesis; (ii) a second expansion of the
bHLHs has occurred early in metazoan evolution before
bilaterians and cnidarians diverged; and (iii) the bHLH
complement during the evolution of the bilaterians has
been remarkably stable. We suggest that these features
may be extended to other developmental gene families
and reflect a general trend in the evolution of the developmental gene repertoires of metazoans.

Methods
Retrieval of the bHLH sequences
As a starting point, we used the list of bHLH proteins we
previously identified in Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans [11]. In order to confirm this list, we performed similarity searches for each
sequence using TBLASTN and BLASTP algorithms [48] on
the current assembly and the predicted proteins of the
three aforementioned genomes maintained by the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
[49]. The whole set of Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster bHLHs were then used for all the similarity
searches using BLAST algorithm in the other species. The
similarity searches using BLAST algorithm were performed at low stringency in order to obtain all possible
bHLHs sequences, including divergent members relative
to those of Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. All

the retrieved sequences were used as queries to undertake
similarity searches using BLAST algorithm against the
NCBI protein database to ascertain that they corresponded to genuine bHLH domains.
In the case of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Tribolium
castaneum, we used the BLAST server dedicated to these
two species (on the web site of the Human Genome
Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine) [50]. We
performed similarity searches using both TBLASTN (on
the WGS assembly and on the individual WGS reads) and
BLASTP (on the protein predictions) algorithms to
retrieve the maximum number of bHLHs encoded by
these two genomes. For all the other studied metazoan
species, no genome assembly was available. We therefore
downloaded the publicly available shotgun traces
through the Trace Archive v3.0 at the NCBI [49], made
banks of the traces for each species, and performed similarity searches using TBLASTN algorithm against these
banks, all of them being hosted by the Belgian EMBnet
Node [51]. We typically retrieved 6–7 overlapping traces
that corresponded to the same aminoacid sequence. The
nucleotide sequences of the traces were retrieved using the
Ensembl Trace server [52] or from the banks hosted by the
Belgian EMBnet node. Contigs were made for each set of
overlapping traces by using CAP3 [53] at the web site of
the Pôle de Bioinformatique de Lyon (PBIL) [54]. Aminoacid sequences were subsequently predicted using both
Geneid [55] (through the web server at the Genome BioInformatics Research Lab, [56]), Genscan [57] (through
the web server at the Institut Pasteur, [58]) and TBLASTN
against the NCBI nr database. In some cases, only a part of
the bHLH domain was retrieved. In these cases, the
genomic sequences were extended through repeated steps
of discontiguous Mega BLAST (at the NCBI) by using as
query the left and right part of the previously assembled
contig and then assembling new contigs with all the
retrieved trace sequences (by using CAP3). The obtained
contigs were analysed with Geneid, Genscan, and
TBLASTN. This process was pursued until the whole
bHLH domain was obtained or until it became impossible to further extend the contig. This workflow was successful in most cases. In the case of Amphimedon
queenslandica, we systematically made larger gene assemblies using the same type of workflow. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses were then performed on the whole
dataset for each species, and if some of the bHLH families
of orthologs were found to lack a member in a given species, additional similarity searches using TBLASTN algorithm were performed specifically using members of the
missing families as queries. This allowed us, in a very few
cases, to retrieve additional bHLH domains missed in the
first BLAST screen. Finally, each of the retrieved bHLH
sequences were used to make similarity searches using
BLASTP algorithm against the NCBI nr database (in order

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/33

to see whether the corresponding gene may already have
been cloned) and TBLASTN algorithm against the NCBI
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database (in order to see
whether there were ESTs corresponding to the identified
bHLHs).
In the case of Nematostella vectensis, we made our initial
similarity search using TBLASTN algorithm on the WGS
reads. However, in a later phase of our work, genome
assemblies became available on the web site of the US
Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute [59] and on
the StellaBase web site [60,61]. We therefore made additional similarity searches using BLAST algorithm on these
genome assemblies and we assessed the presence of our
identified bHLHs in the genome assemblies and retrieved
the corresponding transcript models using TBLASTN algorithm. In order to study the putative physical linkages
between some of the cnidarian bHLH genes, we used the
genome browser available on the web site of the DOE
Joint genome institute [59]. We also downloaded from
the same source the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding scaffolds and used Geneid and Genscan [55,57]
to predict the size and position of the putative genes contained in these scaffolds. In the case of the searches for the
fungi bHLHs, we used the bHLHs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that we had previously identified [11] and a selection of human bHLHs as queries for similarity searches
using TBLASTN and BLASTP algorithms on the fungi WGS
assemblies and protein predictions, respectively, that are
available at the NCBI.
All the nucleotide sequences (traces, contigs, ESTs) we
have isolated are available upon request.
Phylogenetic analyses
Multiple alignments were performed with Clustal W [62]
using the ClustalW web server at the Bioinformatics
Center of the Kyoto University [63] or using ClustalW at
the Belgian EMBnet Node and they were subsequently
manually improved. Handling of the multiple alignments
was done using SEAVIEW [64] or GeneDoc [65].
Unweighted maximum-parsimony (MP) and neighbourjoining (NJ) reconstructions were performed with the
PAUP 4.0 program [66]. NJ analyses were done using the
BioNJ algorithm [67] and 10,000 bootstrap replicates. MP
analyses were performed with the following settings: heuristic search of over 250 bootstrap replicates; MAXTREES
set at 3000, and other parameters set at default values.
Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed with
PHYML [68]. PHYML analyses were performed using the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) amino-acid substitution
model [69], the frequencies of amino acids being estimated from the data set, and rate heterogeneity across
sites being modelled by two rate categories (one constant
and eight γ-rates). The amino acid substitution model was

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:33

chosen using ModelGenerator [70]. Statistical support for
the different internal branches was assessed by bootstrap
resampling (150 bootstrap replicates), as implemented in
PHYML [68]. Bayesian inference was performed using the
Markov chain Monte Carlo method as implemented in
the MRBAYES (version 3) package [71,72]. We used the
JTT substitution frequency matrix [69] with among-sites
rate variation modelled by means of a discrete γ distribution with four equally probable categories. Two independent Markov chains were run, each containing from
1,500,000 to 3,000,000 Monte Carlo steps (depending on
the number of steps required to get chain convergence).
One out of every 250 trees was saved. The trees obtained
in the two runs were meshed and the first 25% of the trees
were discarded as 'burnin'. Majority consensus of the
obtained trees was computed by means of the PAUP 4.0
program. Marginal probabilities at each internal branche
were taken as a measure of statistical support.
All the alignments and the trees are available upon
request.

The 45 families of metazoan bHLH defined by our phylogenetic analyses. Families have been named as in our previous studies, i.e. according
to the name (or its common abbreviation) of the first discovered or bestknown member of the family [4,11]. The number of members per family
in each of the different analysed genomes is reported. Each family has
been tentatively assigned to the previously defined higher-order groups
[2,4,11,17]. The number of 'orphan genes' is shown as a range due to the
uncertainty in the allocation of some bHLHs to a given family. These
uncertainties are indicated by '?' in the table. Explanations about all these
uncertainties can be found in the additional files 4 to 15. In the cases of
Amphimedon queenslandica, Nematostella vectensis and Hydra
magnipapillata, additional explanations can be found in the main text
and in Figures 2 and 3. The data from Ciona intestinalis come from
[12] and have not been reanalysed in this study. Species abreviations: H.
