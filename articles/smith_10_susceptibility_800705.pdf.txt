Susceptibility of the human retrovirus XMRV to
antiretroviral inhibitors
Robert A Smith1*, Geoffrey S Gottlieb2, A Dusty Miller1,3

Abstract
Background: XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) is the first known example of an exogenous
gammaretrovirus that can infect humans. A limited number of reports suggest that XMRV is intrinsically resistant to
many of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection, but is sensitive to a small subset of these inhibitors.
In the present study, we used a novel marker transfer assay to directly compare the antiviral drug sensitivities of
XMRV and HIV-1 under identical conditions in the same host cell type.
Results: We extend the findings of previous studies by showing that, in addition to AZT and tenofovir, XMRV and
HIV-1 are equally sensitive to AZddA (3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine), AZddG (3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine) and
adefovir. These results indicate that specific 3′-azido or acyclic nucleoside analog inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse
transcriptase (RT) also block XMRV infection with comparable efficacy in vitro. Our data confirm that XMRV is highly
resistant to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz and to inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. In
addition, we show that the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir are active against XMRV, with EC50 values
in the nanomolar range.
Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that XMRV exhibits a distinct pattern of nucleoside analog susceptibility
that correlates with the structure of the pseudosugar moiety and that XMRV is sensitive to a broader range of
antiretroviral drugs than has previously been reported. We suggest that the divergent drug sensitivity profiles of
XMRV and HIV-1 are partially explained by specific amino acid differences in their respective protease, RT and
integrase sequences. Our data provide a basis for choosing specific antiretroviral drugs for clinical studies in XMRVinfected patients.

Background
The genus gammaretroviridae includes several wellcharacterized exogenous retroviruses that cause leukemia, lymphoma and other diseases in their natural hosts
[1]. Although gammaretroviruses have been isolated
from several vertebrate species, until recently, the only
evidence that these agents could infect humans was the
strong sequence similarity between certain human endogenous retroviruses and gammaretroviruses from other
mammalian species [2]. In 2006, Urisman and colleagues
reported the discovery of novel gammaretroviral cDNA
sequences in tumor samples from patients with prostate
cancer [3]. Full-length viral clones derived from the
patient tissues were shown to be genetically similar to
xenotropic strains of murine leukemia virus (MLV), and

thus, the novel retrovirus was named xenotropic MLVrelated virus (XMRV).
Subsequent studies have provided compelling evidence
that XMRV is indeed the first known example of an
exogenous human gammaretrovirus. XMRV sequences
have been identified in tumor samples from three additional cohorts of prostate cancer patients [4-6], in a
prostate carcinoma cell line [7], and in secretions
expressed from cancerous prostate tissues [8]. Virus
produced from a full-length XMRV molecular clone can
infect primary prostate cells in culture, as well as several
immortalized cell lines [7-12], and gammaretrovirus-like
particles have been identified in XMRV-infected cultures
by electron microscopy [5,7]. Although XMRV lacks
direct transforming activity, foci of transformed cells
appear at low frequencies in XMRV-infected fibroblast
cultures, suggesting that the virus is capable of promoting carcinogenesis via insertional activation of cellular

oncogenes [13]. Importantly, the chromosomal locations
of XMRV proviruses have been mapped in tissue samples from 9 different patients with prostate cancer, confirming that XMRV can integrate into the human
genome in vivo [11,14].
Following the discovery of XMRV in prostate tumor
tissues, a PCR-based survey identified XMRV DNA in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 68 of
101 chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients living in
the United States, as well as 8 of 218 healthy controls
[15]. Remarkably, co-culture experiments revealed the
presence of infectious XMRV in activated PBMC and in
cell-free plasma samples from PCR-positive CFS
patients, suggesting that these individuals harbor significant levels of replication-competent XMRV in the periphery. Although other studies of CFS and prostate
cancer patients living outside the United States have
failed to detect XMRV [16-20], data showing that the
virus can infect human cells in vitro [7-12] and in vivo
[11,14] provide a solid rationale for identifying antiviral
inhibitors that block XMRV replication.
A growing body of evidence suggests that XMRV is
intrinsically resistant to many of the drugs used to treat
HIV-1 infection, but is sensitive to a small subset of
antiretroviral inhibitors. In an initial analysis of XMRV
drug susceptibility, treatment of immortalized prostate
cells with 30 nM AZT inhibited XMRV infection by a
factor of 25-fold; equivalent concentrations of other
antiretroviral drugs had no effect on XMRV infection
[21]. A subsequent study in cultured cells found that
XMRV and HIV-1 exhibit comparable sensitivities to
AZT, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and raltegravir suggesting that these drugs are relatively potent inhibitors of XMRV replication [22]. Finally, Singh et al.
reported that AZT, TDF, raltegravir and the integrase
inhibitor L-870812 inhibit XMRV infection at nanomolar concentrations in culture [23]. Although drug susceptibility data for HIV-1 were also presented, direct
comparisons between XMRV and HIV-1 could not be
made due to the differing cell types used to assay these
viruses (i.e., immortalized breast and prostate cancer
cells for XMRV versus primary blood lymphocytes for
HIV-1) [23].
In the present study, we examined the ability of specific reverse transcriptase (RT), protease, and integrase
inhibitors to block XMRV infection in culture by
directly comparing the antiretroviral drug susceptibilities
of XMRV and HIV-1 in the same host cell type. Our
use of the same target cells for both viruses was particularly critical for assessing nucleoside RT inhibitor
(NRTI) susceptibility, since the antiviral activity of these
drugs varies widely in different host cell environments
[23,24]. We also used conditions that restricted viral
replication to a single cycle of infection to ensure that

our drug susceptibility measurements were not influenced by differences in the relative replication rates of
HIV-1 and XMRV. As in previous reports, we found
that XMRV is intrinsically resistant to nevirapine, efavirenz, foscarnet, and all FDA-approved inhibitors of HIV1 protease. However, our data also show that in addition
to AZT and tenofovir, XMRV and HIV-1 are comparably sensitive to other structurally-related NRTIs. These
findings reveal a distinct pattern of NRTI sensitivity in
XMRV that correlates with the structure of the pseudosugar moiety. We also demonstrate that the integrase
inhibitor elvitegravir suppresses XMRV infection with
an EC50 similar to that of AZT, whereas raltegravir is
the most potent anti-XMRV agent of all the inhibitors
tested. These data suggest that the inhibitor-binding
surfaces of HIV-1 and XMRV integrase share similar
topologies despite numerous differences in their respective amino acid sequences. Collectively, our study
reveals important features of the inhibitor specificities of
XMRV RT and integrase and expands the number of
antiretroviral drugs that are active against XMRV in
culture.

Results
Comparison of HIV-1 and XMRV drug susceptibilities

We used a previously-described marker rescue assay
[7,25] in conjunction with a Tat-inducible, b-gal-expressing HeLa cell line (MAGIC-5A) [26] to quantify the
susceptibility of XMRV to antiretroviral inhibitors. Our
XMRV stocks were derived from two independently-isolated strains of the virus: XMRVVP62 and XMRV22Rv1.
XMRVVP62 was produced from a full-length molecular
clone (pVP62) that was previously constructed by joining two overlapping cDNA fragments amplified from
prostate tumor tissues [3,11]. For our experiments, hightiter XMRVVP62 stocks were generated by transfecting
pVP62 into LNCaP prostate cancer cells [11].
XMRV22Rv1 was originally discovered in a prostate carcinoma cell line (22Rv1) that had been grown by xenotransplantation in nude mice [7,27]. 22Rv1 cells contain
multiple integrated copies of the XMRV genome and
release high titers of infectious XMRV into the culture
supernatant [7].
To generate viruses for drug susceptibility testing, HTX
human fibrosarcoma cells were transduced with an MLV
vector encoding HIV-1 tat (LtatSN) and were subsequently infected with either XMRVVP62 or XMRV22Rv1
(Figure 1). The resultant stocks (XMRV+LtatSN) were
mixtures of native XMRV and XMRV-pseudotyped virions
[LtatSN(XMRV)] in which LtatSN RNA was packaged
together with XMRV Gag, Pol and Env proteins; only the
LtatSN(XMRV) fraction was detected in subsequent culture steps. To quantify drug susceptibility, MAGIC-5A
cultures were treated with varying concentrations of

Figure 1 Drug susceptibility assays for XMRV and HIV-1. For XMRV, HTX/LtatSN cells were infected (solid arrows) with XMRV 22Rv1 or
XMRVVP62, resulting in the release of native XMRV (gray virions) as well as XMRV-pseudotyped virions that contain LtatSN RNA (LtatSN(XMRV);
blue virions). Infection of MAGIC-5A cells with XMRV+LtatSN results in transfer of the HIV-1 tat marker gene, thereby inducing b-gal expression
through Tat-dependent transactivation of an upstream HIV-1 LTR promoter. b-gal+ (blue) cells are detected by staining the MAGIC-5A
monolayers with X-gal (dashed arrows). Entry of XMRV into HTX/LtatSN and MAGIC-5A cells is mediated by the endogenously-expressed
xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1). For HIV-1, virus stocks were produced by transient transfection (dotted arrow) of 293T/17
cells with pNL4-3. As with XMRV+LtatSN, infection of MAGIC-5A cells with HIV-1NL4-3 (red virions) results in Tat expression and b-gal+ focus
formation. MAGIC-5A cells were previously engineered to express the CD4 receptor and CCR5 coreceptor for HIV-1 entry; these cells also express
the endogenous CXCR4 coreceptor [26]. Dashed vertical lines indicate the stages at which protease inhibitors (left) and reverse transcriptase or
integrase inhibitors (right) were added to the culture supernatants.

NRTIs, NNRTIs, or integrase inhibitors, and infected with
XMRVVP62 +LtatSN or XMRV22Rv1 +LtatSN (Figure 1).
Entry of XMRV occurs through the interaction of the
virus with xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1
(XPR1), which is endogenously expressed in HeLa cell
lines [28]. XMRV+LtatSN infection of MAGIC-5A cells
induced the expression of b-galactosidase (b-gal) via Tatmediated transactivation of an upstream HIV-1 LTR,
thereby enabling us to quantify the dose-dependent reduction of b-gal+ foci in infected indicator cell cultures. For
assays of protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility, XMRVinfected HTX/LtatSN cells were seeded in microtiter
plates and immediately treated with PIs. Following a twoday incubation period, samples from the PI-treated HTX
cultures were transferred to MAGIC-5A cells for FFU
determination. MAGIC-5A cells also express receptors

and coreceptors for HIV-1 entry (CD4, CXCR4 and
CCR5; Figure 1), and thus, we were able to perform sideby-side comparisons of the drug susceptibilities of XMRV
and HIV-1 in the same host cell type. In both cases, viral
replication was limited to a single cycle of infection.
XMRV is susceptible to a specific subset of NRTIs

We initially measured the susceptibility of XMRV to
each of seven different NRTIs that are FDA-approved
for treating HIV-1 infection. AZT showed the most
potent anti-XMRV activity of all the nucleoside analogs
tested (Table 1); EC 50 values for XMRV VP62 +LtatSN,
XMRV 22Rv1 +LtatSN and HIV-1 NL4-3 were similar for
AZT, indicating that these viruses are comparably susceptible to the analog. These results agree with a previous comparison of the AZT sensitivity of HIV-1 and

XMRV using a reporter virus-based assay [22]. We also
found that, relative to HIV-1NL4-3, XMRVVP62+LtatSN
and XMRV22Rv1+LtatSN were fully sensitive to tenofovir
(the active form of TDF), as the observed EC50 values
were not significantly different between these three
viruses (Table 1). In contrast, XMRV was 13-34-fold
resistant to ddI, d4T and abacavir relative to HIV-1NL43. Higher levels of resistance were observed for 3TC and
FTC, which failed to inhibit XMRV infection at doses
that were 100-fold greater than the corresponding EC50s
for HIV-1NL4-3.
To further characterize the nucleoside analog susceptibility of XMRV, we determined the antiviral activities
of additional NRTIs that are active against HIV-1 and
other retroviruses, but that are not currently approved
for treating HIV-1 infection. AZddA and AZddG contain an azido group at the 3′ position of the ribosyl
sugar, and thus, are structurally related to AZT. AZddA
and AZddG have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in culture, and the 5′-triphosphate forms of these
analogs inhibit the DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1
RT in cell-free assays [29]. EC50 values for the inhibition
of XMRV and HIV-1 by AZddA and AZddG were comparable, although the EC50 for XMRV22Rv1+LtatSN with
AZddG was fourfold greater than that of HIV-1 NL4-3
(Table 1). Importantly, the concentrations of AZddA,
AZddG and AZT required to inhibit XMRV infection
were at least 100-fold lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50 values) of these analogs in HeLa-CD4
cell cultures (> 270 μM for all three inhibitors; [29]).
We also measured the anti-XMRV activity of adefovir,

an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate that is used in prodrug form (adefovir dipivoxil) to treat hepatitis B virus
infection. EC50 measurements for the activity of adefovir
against XMRV VP62 +LtatSN, XMRV 22Rv1 +LtatSN and
HIV-1NL4-3 varied by a factor of twofold or less; these
differences were not statistically significant (Table 1).
Taken together, these data show that XMRV is sensitive to AZT, AZddA, AZddG, tenofovir and adefovir at
doses that are comparable to those required to inhibit
HIV-1 replication. At the highest concentrations of the
drugs used in our assays (10 μM for AZT, 40 μM for
AZddA and AZddG and 100 μM for adefovir and tenofovir), the mean numbers of cells in the fixed and
stained cultures were 80-100% of untreated controls,
indicating that the EC50 values obtained for these analogs were not influenced by drug-mediated cytotoxicity.
XMRV is resistant to NNRTIs and to the pyrophosphate
analog foscarnet

Nevirapine, efavirenz and other NNRTIs inhibit HIV-1
RT by binding to a small hydrophobic pocket located
near the polymerase active site [30]. Although wild-type
strains of HIV-1 Group M are sensitive to NNRTIs,
HIV type 2 (HIV-2), simian immunodeficiency virus and
many Group O isolates of HIV-1 are intrinsically resistant to this drug class. Consistent with the relatively
narrow spectrum of NNRTI-mediated antiviral activity,
both strains of XMRV were >18-fold and >200-fold
resistant to nevirapine and efavirenz, respectively, relative to HIV-1NL4-3 (Table 1). In contrast, the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet (PFA) is active against many

Smith et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:70
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/70

DNA viruses and retroviruses including HIV-1 and -2,
Rauscher MLV, Moloney MLV, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus [31]. Despite this
broad spectrum of antiviral activity, XMRVVP62+LtatSN
and XMRV 22Rv1 +LtatSN were resistant to PFA
(Table 1). Concentrations of PFA as high as 400 μM
had no effect on XMRV infection; increasing the drug
level to 900 μM produced visible cytotoxic effects in
MAGIC-5A indicator cell cultures (data not shown).
XMRV is intrinsically resistant to PIs but is sensitive to
integrase inhibitors

To identify antivirals that inhibit XMRV targets other
than RT, we assessed the ability of nine different HIV-1
PIs to block the production of newly-formed, infectious
XMRV VP62 +LtatSN in chronically-infected HTX cultures. In these experiments, we screened each PI for
anti-XMRV activity using a single drug concentration
that was approximately equal to the EC95 for HIV-1NL43, as determined in our concurrent studies of HIV-1 and
HIV-2 (range = 0.1-1 μM; see Methods section for
details). As seen in our previous assays, these PI doses
reduced the infectious titer of HIV-1NL4-3 in pNL4-3transfected 293T/17 cultures by 94% or greater, relative
to untreated controls (Figure 2). In contrast, each of the
nine PI treatments had no detectable effect on the infectious titer of XMRV VP62 +LtatSN, indicating that

Figure 2 Intrinsic resistance of XMRV to protease inhibitors
(PIs). For XMRVVP62+LtatSN (shaded bars), HTX/LtatSN cells were
infected with virus derived from the pVP62 clone, seeded into
microtiter plates, and immediately treated with the indicated doses
of PIs. For HIV-1NL4-3 (solid bars), 293T/17 cells were seeded into
microtiter plates, transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the fulllength NL4-3 molecular clone, and treated with the indicated
concentrations of each PI. The same PI stocks were used to treat
both sets of virus-producing cultures. Supernatants from PI-treated
HTX and 293T/17 cultures were then diluted and plated onto
MAGIC-5A indicator cells to quantify infectious particles. Bars

XMRV VP62 is intrinsically resistant to this inhibitor
class. These results are consistent with a recent report
showing that XMRV is relatively insensitive to PIs (EC50
values ≥34 μM) in cultures of immortalized human
breast cancer cells [23].
We also examined the susceptibility of XMRV to two
different inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer
activity: raltegravir and elvitegravir. Of the 24 antiretroviral drugs tested in our analysis, raltegravir was the
most potent inhibitor of XMRV infection. XMRV and
HIV-1 exhibited comparable sensitivity to raltegravir, as
the EC50 values for XMRVVP62+LtatSN and XMRV22Rv1
+LtatSN were similar to that of HIV-1NL4-3 (Table 2).
Elvitegravir also inhibited XMRV infection in our indicator cell assays, but higher doses of the drug were
required to observe this activity. EC50 measurements for
XMRVVP62 +LtatSN and XMRV22Rv1+LtatSN were 71and 40-fold greater for elvitegravir relative to raltegravir
and 79- and 46-fold higher than the EC50 for elvitegravir-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 NL4-3 , respectively
(Table 2). Although these data show that elvitegravir is
less potent than raltegravir against XMRV, we note that
elvitegravir inhibited the virus at concentrations in the
nanomolar range, and thus, was comparable to AZT
with respect to anti-XMRV activity (Tables 1 and 2).
For both raltegravir and elvitegravir, no statistically-significant declines in mean target cell number were
observed at the highest doses of drugs tested (10 μM;
p > 0.05, Student’s two-sided t-test). This result agrees
with previously-published CC 50 values for raltegravir
and elvitegravir in PBMC (> 100 μM and 40 μM,
respectively; [23,32]) and excludes cytotoxicity as a
potential confounder in our measurements of integrase
inhibitor susceptibility.

Discussion
In this study, we used a novel marker transfer assay to
directly compare the susceptibility of XMRV and HIV-1
to a panel of antiretroviral drugs in the same host cell
type. Our experimental approach and findings differ
from previous studies of XMRV in several important

ways. With regard to NRTIs, the initial report by
Sakuma et al. [21] suggested that XMRV is sensitive to
AZT but resistant to 3TC, d4T and tenofovir. Importantly, the single dose of tenofovir used in their experiments (30 nM) was substantially lower than the EC50
observed in our assays (~5 μM; Table 1), leading the
authors to conclude that XMRV was resistant to the
drug. Our analysis shows that tenofovir is equally potent
against XMRV and HIV-1 in culture (Table 1). A subsequent study by Singh et al. [23] used differing cell types
to compare XMRV and HIV-1, and as a result, differences in the intrinsic NRTI susceptibilities of the two
viruses could not be resolved from host cell-specific differences in NRTI activity. In fact, careful inspection of
their data suggests that XMRV is relatively resistant to
AZT, tenofovir and TDF (a prodrug of tenofovir), as the
EC50 values for these analogs were 15-94-fold higher for
XMRV compared to HIV-1. Our data are more congruent with the findings of Paprotka et al. [22], who
showed that XMRV and HIV-1 are comparably sensitive
to AZT and TDF in prostate cancer cells. We extend
these observations by demonstrating that, in addition to
AZT and tenofovir, the NRTIs AZddA, AZddG and adefovir are equally active against XMRV and HIV-1 (Table
1). Taken together, our analysis resolves disparities
among earlier reports of XMRV drug susceptibility and
illustrates that XMRV is sensitive to a broader range of
NRTIs than was previously appreciated.
Overall, the patterns of drug susceptibility observed in
our analysis of XMRV are similar to those seen in previous studies of Moloney MLV (MoMLV). MoMLV is
sensitive to AZT, adefovir and tenofovir, but is relatively
resistant to ddI, D4T, 3TC, abacavir and PFA [33-36].
In addition, purified MoMLV protease is highly resistant
to PIs [37], whereas both raltegravir and elvitegravir
have been shown to inhibit MoMLV replication in culture [38,39]. In agreement with our findings for XMRV
(Table 2), MoMLV is moderately resistant to elvitegravir, as evidenced by a 7-fold greater EC50 for the drug
relative to HIV-1 [39]. These concurrent drug sensitivity
patterns are consistent with the high degree of amino
acid sequence similarity shared between XMRV and
MoMLV, which are 99% identical in the protease and
RT polymerase domain and 90% identical in the integrase catalytic core domain (CCD).
To gain further insights into the molecular basis of
antiretroviral drug resistance in XMRV, we constructed
amino acid alignments of the inferred XMRVVP62 and
HIV-1NL4-3 sequences for the entire protease enzyme,
the portion of RT spanning the conserved polymerase
motifs, and the integrase CCD (Figure 3). Within these
three regions, XMRV and HIV-1 share 27-31% amino
acid identity and 18-21% amino acid similarity. Importantly, the XMRV and HIV-1 sequences differ at several

Page 6 of 12

sites that are critical for antiretroviral drug resistance.
XMRV protease contains three residues (V54, S81, and
L92) that correspond to PI resistance-conferring replacements in HIV-1 (I47V, T74 S, and I84L, respectively)
(Figure 3A) [40]. XMRV also contains several amino
acid residues in the RT polymerase domain that, in
HIV-1, result in NNRTI resistance (K101P, K103 H,
Y181L, Y188L, and G190A) and dideoxynucleoside analog resistance (T69N, L74V, Y115F) (Figure 3B) [40,41].
These sites likely contribute to intrinsic drug resistance
in XMRV. In addition, XMRV integrase contains a serine at the position corresponding to Q148 in HIV-1
(Figure 3C), which is known to be critical for integrase
inhibitor resistance in HIV-1 [42]. This amino acid difference may contribute to moderate elvitegravir resistance in XMRV (Table 2).
As observed in previous studies of MoMLV RT [43,44],
XMRV was highly resistant to the L-pseudosugar nucleoside analogs 3TC and FTC (Table 1). Both MoMLV and
XMRV RT encode a valine at the second position of the
conserved YXDD sequence of polymerase motif C,
whereas the corresponding residue in HIV-1 RT is
methionine 184 (Figure 3B). Although the M184V replacement confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC in
HIV-1 [45], mutants of MoMLV that harbor the reciprocal change in the YXDD sequence (V223M) remain
highly resistant to 3TC [43,44]. It is therefore likely that
amino acid sites outside the YXDD sequence of RT contribute to intrinsic 3TC/FTC resistance in XMRV.
In HIV-1 RT, specific substitutions at positions 41, 67,
70, 210, 215 and 219 (commonly known as thymidine
analog mutations or TAMs) confer AZT resistance by
enhancing RT-catalyzed excision of AZT-5′-monophosphate from the nascent DNA strand [46]. Although the
sequences of XMRV and HIV-1 differ at five of the six
TAM sites in RT (Figure 3B), these residues are unlikely
to influence AZT susceptibility in XMRV, as the excision activity of MoMLV RT is orders of magnitude
lower than that of the HIV-1 enzyme [47]. Indeed, we
observed that XMRV and HIV-1 were comparably sensitive to AZT as well as two other NRTIs containing a 3′azido modification (AZddA and AZddG; Table 1). Based
on previous studies of HIV-1 and MoMLV [29,48,49],
we expect that XMRV RT can utilize the 5′-triphosphate
forms of these analogs as alternative nucleotide substrates, resulting in chain termination of DNA synthesis.
Additional biochemical analyses are required to characterize the nucleotide selectivity and excision activity of
XMRV RT.
Two recently-published reports have shown that the
integrase inhibitor raltegravir inhibits XMRV replication
in culture at nanomolar concentrations of the drug
[22,23]. Our results confirm these findings and demonstrate that elvitegravir is also active against XMRV,

Figure 3 Alignment of Pro and Pol amino acid sequences for XMRV and HIV-1. Alignments are shown for the protease (panel A), aminoterminal RT (panel B) and integrase catalytic core domain (CCD) sequences (panel C) of XMRVVP62 and HIV-1NL4-3 ([GenBank: NC_007815.1] and
[GenBank: M19921], respectively). Numbering for XMRVVP62 is based on assigned amino acid numbers for the corresponding MoMLV peptides
[GenBank: AF033811]. Alignments were generated using EMBOSS [62] with the following settings: gap-open = 10, gap extend = 0.5, algorithm =
needle (global), scoring matrix = BLOSUM62. Amino acid identities between XMRVVP62 and HIV-1NL4-3 are shown with yellow boxes, conserved
amino acid residues (BLOSUM62 score ≥1) are shown with grey boxes, and alignment gaps with are indicated with a dash (-). Catalytic active
site residues are indicated with an asterisk (*). For RT, the initial EMBOSS alignment was manually adjusted to conform to a recent structural
alignment of MoMLV and HIV-1 RTs [63]. Boundary boxes for conserved polymerase motifs A-D are shown as previously assigned [64].
Boundaries for motif F are shown as identified in alignments of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases [65]. The X at position five of XMRV
protease indicates the location of a termination codon that, in MLV, is suppressed during translation of Gag-Pol-encoding RNA. Sites involved in
antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1, as tabulated by the International AIDS Society-USA (for protease and RT) [40] or in the Stanford University
HIV Drug Resistance Database (for integrase) [66] are indicated in bold, colored letters. The locations of primary PI, NRTI, and NNRTI resistance
mutations, as well as changes associated with resistance to the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir, are shown in red. Sites involved in
NNRTI resistance are shown in blue. Pound signs (#) indicate amino acid residues believed to be important for the positioning of strand transfer
inhibitors, based on a recent structural analysis of prototype foamy virus integrase [51].

Smith et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:70
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/70

although the concentrations of elvitegravir needed to
inhibit XMRV infection were higher than those required
for raltegravir (Table 2). A third integrase inhibitor, L870812, has also been reported to exert moderate antiviral activity against XMRV in culture, with an EC 50
32-fold greater than that of raltegravir [23]. Although
raltegravir, elvitegravir and L-870812 are structurally
divergent, these three inhibitors share a common pharmacophore that binds the active site metal ions essential
for integrase strand transfer catalysis [50]. Recent crystallographic studies have identified three amino acid
residues that are believed to influence the positioning of
strand transfer inhibitors in the integrase active site
[51], and based on our alignment of the CCD, these
residues are conserved in the XMRV and HIV-1 integrase sequences (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data
suggest that the strand transfer inhibitor-binding sites of
XMRV and HIV-1 integrase share a similar overall
topology despite numerous amino acid differences in
the CCD.
We used two independent sources of XMRV for our
studies: one derived from the infectious molecular clone
VP62 [11] and the other from 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma
cells [7]. Our rationale for this choice was that the VP62
clone might encode alterations that influence drug susceptibility, whereas 22Rv1 cells harbor at least 10 proviral copies of XMRV, presumably providing a more
diverse sample of the virus. However, a recent analysis
of XMRV sequences from 22Rv1 cells revealed that the
proviruses are nearly identical to each other and to the
VP62 molecular clone [22]. There are only two nucleotide differences between the consensus XMRV22Rv1 and
XMRV VP62 sequences ([GenBank: FN6900043] and
[GenBank: EF185282], respectively); these result in single amino acid changes in Gag and Env, whereas the
Pro and Pol proteins are identical. Thus, the key proteins targeted by the antiretroviral drugs tested in our
study are identical in XMRV22Rv1 and XMRVVP62. This
identity is reflected in the similar EC50 values obtained
for these two viruses (Tables 1 and 2). Strikingly, all six
of the full-length XMRV sequences currently available
in GenBank show a high degree of nucleotide identity
(Figure 4). Although the lack of variation reported in
XMRV is difficult to reconcile with the known mutation
rates of MoMLV and other retroviruses, collectively,
these sequencing results suggest that the drugs that are
active against XMRV 22Rv1 and XMRV VP62 should be
similarly active against other XMRV strains.

Conclusions
Our analysis demonstrates that XMRV is sensitive to a
broader range of NRTIs than was previously appreciated; these include analogs that are used in the clinical
treatment of HIV-1 infection (AZT and tenofovir) as

Page 8 of 12

well as other structurally-related NRTIs (AZddA,
AZddG and adefovir). We observed a distinct pattern of
NRTI sensitivity in XMRV that correlates with the
structure of the pseudosugar moiety; while XMRV is
sensitive to 3′-azido nucleoside analogs and acyclic
nucleoside phosphonates, the virus is moderately resistant to dideoxynucleosides and highly resistant to
L-form thiacytidine NRTIs. Importantly, this pattern
suggests that other 3′-azido or acyclic nucleoside analogs might also exhibit anti-XMRV activity. In addition,
our data show that elvitegravir blocks XMRV infection
with a degree of potency similar to that of AZT. This
finding expands the number of integrase inhibitors with
known activity against XMRV in vitro.

Figure 4 Phylogenetic analysis of XMRV. All full-length XMRV
sequences available in GenBank (accessed on April 28, 2010) were
aligned using ClustalW. Unrooted (panel A) and rooted (panel B)
phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbor-joining
algorithm of MEGA 4.0 [67] with default settings. Scale bars indicate
evolutionary distance in base substitutions per site (i.e., the distance
shown in panel A equals 2 substitutions per 10,000 bases). Note
that after the original sequencing of XMRV strains VP62, VP42 and
VP35 [3], strain VP62 was resequenced ("VP62 corrected"; [11]). The
resulting sequence reveals a closer similarity between VP62 and
other XMRV strains and suggests that the branch lengths of VP35
and VP42 are also likely overestimated due to PCR or sequencing
errors. mChrom13 indicates an endogenous MLV sequence located
on Mus musculus chromosome 13 [GenBank: CT030655.7], and is the
most closely related non-XMRV sequence found by BLAST search of
GenBank using the XMRV22Rv1 sequence. DG-75 indicates DG-75
MLV [GenBank: AF221065].

While our use of the same target cell type for XMRV
and HIV-1 provides an important reference point for
characterizing XMRV drug susceptibility, we note that
the two viruses utilize different receptors for entry and
are therefore likely to infect differing host cell types
in vivo. Ultimately, the clinical utility of antiretrovirals
for XMRV will depend on drug distribution and metabolism at anatomic sites of XMRV replication, the
degree to which antiretrovirals reduce XMRV viral load,
and whether reductions in viral load slow pathogenesis.
In the event that XMRV is shown to be the causative
agent of human disease, our data identify candidate
drugs for clinical studies of antiretroviral therapy in
XMRV-infected patients.

Methods
Inhibitors

AZT (generic name: zidovudine; 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine), ddI (didanosine; 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine), D4T (stavudine; 2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxythymidine) and PFA
(foscarnet; phosphonoformic acid) were obtained commercially (Sigma-Aldrich), as were adefovir ((R)-9-(2phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine), tenofovir ((R)-9-(2phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine) and abacavir
((1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol) (Moravek Biochemicals),
AZddA (3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyadeonsine) and AZddG
(3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine) (Berry and Associates),
and elvitegravir (Selleck Chemicals). Nevirapine and efavirenz were a gift from Koronis Pharmaceuticals (Seattle,
Washington). 3TC (lamivudine; (-)-b-L-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′thiacytidine) and FTC (emtricitabine; (-)-b-L-2′,3′dideoxy-5-fluoro-3′-thiacytidine) were kindly provided
by Raymond Schinazi (Emory University) or were purchased from Moravek. All HIV-1 PIs used in this study,
as well as the integrase inhibitor raltegravir, were
obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS
Reference Reagent Program.
Cell culture and virus production

HTX cells are a pseudodiploid subclone of HT-1080
human fibrosarcoma cells [52]. The LtatSN vector was
created by inserting the tat coding region of HIV strain
SF2 into the retroviral expression vector LXSN [53].
HTX/LtatSN cells were generated by infecting HTX
cells with helper-virus free LtatSN virus that was produced in PA317 amphotropic packaging cells [54] and
then treating the cells with G418 (geneticin) to select
for the presence of the vector. 22Rv1 cells [27] and
293T/17 cells [55] were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. MAGIC-5A indicator cells
(CD4+/CCR5+ HeLa cells that express b-galactosidase
(b-gal) under the control of an HIV-1 LTR promoter)

Page 9 of 12

[26] were a kind gift from Dr. Michael Emerman (Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). Cell lines were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
XMRV-pseudotyped LtatSN virus (XMRV+LtatSN)
was generated by infecting HTX/LtatSN cells with virus
produced from the VP62 molecular clone of XMRV
(a kind gift from Robert Silverman, Cleveland Clinic)
[11] or with virus harvested from XMRV-infected 22Rv1
cells [7]. HIV-1NL4-3 was produced using the full-length
pNL4-3 HIV-1 plasmid molecular clone [56]. Plasmid
DNA was isolated from pNL4-3-transformed E. coli
JM109 using an Endo-Free™ maxiprep kit (Qiagen) and
introduced into cultured 293T/17 cells via chloroquinemediated transfection as previously described [57].
XMRVVP62+LtatSN, XMRV22Rv1+LtatSN and HIV-1NL4-3
stocks were harvested from confluent monolayers of
producer cells, passed through 0.45-micron filters
(XMRV+LtatSN) or centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at
room temperature (HIV-1 NL4-3 ) to remove host cells,
and frozen in multiple aliquots at -70°C. Titers of the
resultant stocks were 7.3 × 105, 1.2 × 105, and 3.0 × 106
MAGIC-5A focus forming units (FFU)/ml for
XMRVVP62+LtatSN, XMRV22Rv1+LtatSN and HIV-1NL43, respectively.
Drug Susceptibility Assays-RT and Integrase Inhibitors

To compare the susceptibilities of XMRV and HIV-1 to
NRTIs, NNRTIs and PFA, MAGIC-5A cells were seeded
into 48-well plates at 1.5 × 104 cells/well. After 20-22 h
of incubation, the cultures were dosed with varying drug
concentrations and returned to the incubator for an
additional 2.5 h. Immediately before infection, virus
stocks were diluted to 3,000 FFU/ml in complete
DMEM supplemented with 20 μg/ml diethylaminoethyl
(DEAE) dextran. Supernatants from the drug-treated
MAGIC-5A cultures were then aspirated and replaced
with 100 μl of each diluted virus stock/well. To maintain
drug pressure, a second dose of inhibitor was added to
the inocula (at the same concentration as the first dose),
and the plates were returned to the incubator for 2.5 h.
After this time, an additional 300 μl of complete DMEM
was added, a third dose of drug was added, and incubation was continued for 40 h. Individual dose-response
experiments for each virus strain involved 2-3 solventonly control cultures plus 2-3 cultures for each of seven
different drug concentrations.
To score b-gal-positive (b-gal+) foci, 100 μl of fixative
solution [1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 1×
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] was added to each culture well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for
10 min. After washing the fixed monolayers twice with
100 μl of PBS, 100 μl of staining solution [4 mM

Smith et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:70
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/70

potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mM potassium ferricyanide,
2 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylb-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) in PBS] was added to each
well, and the plates were placed in the incubator for 1 h.
The cultures were then aspirated to remove the X-gal
staining solution, rinsed with 100 μl of PBS per well, aspirated again and stored in 200 μl of PBS per well. Foci
(individual b-gal + cells plus groups of 2-8 contiguous
b-gal+ cells) were counted using a CTL Immunospot Analyzer (Cellular Technology Ltd.) or were manually counted
by light microscopy. Untreated control cultures typically
contained 200-500 foci per well.
To quantify viral susceptibility to integrase inhibitors,
we adopted our MAGIC-5A-based assay to a 96-well
format and used an expanded range of drug concentrations. These changes were necessitated by the shallow
slopes observed in dose-response plots with raltegravir
and elvitegravir relative to inhibitors from other drug
classes [58]. Culture conditions and times of drug addition were identical to those used for the RT inhibitor
assays, except that each culture well was seeded with
5 × 10 3 MAGIC-5A cells in 100 μl of medium, was
infected with 200 FFU of virus in 50 μl of dextran-containing medium, and received an additional 150 μl of
complete medium following the 2.5 h incubation period.
Fixing and X-gal-staining steps were performed with
one half of the volumes of solutions used in RT inhibitor assays, and b-gal+ foci were counted using the CTL
Immunospot Analyzer.
Drug concentrations that inhibited focus formation by
50% (EC50 values) were calculated from dose-response
plots by sigmoidal regression analysis (GraphPad Software). EC50 measurements for HIV-1NL4-3 were comparable to the values obtained in other single-cycle drug
sensitivity assays [26,59,60].
Potential drug-mediated cytotoxicity was assessed by
comparing the number of cells in untreated control cultures to those in cultures that received the maximal
dosage of drug used in our assays. Fixed cells were
stained by exposing the MAGIC-5A monolayers to
10 μg/ml ethidium bromide in PBS for 5 min, then
de-staining for 5 min in deionized water. Cell nuclei were
visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Texas red
filter set (560 nm excitation, 645 nm emission). Images
were acquired from 3-4 culture wells for each drug treatment and corresponding no-drug controls, and nuclei
were enumerated using ImageJ software [61].
Drug Susceptibility Assays-Protease Inhibitors

To measure PI susceptibility, cultured cells that were
producing either HIV-1 or XMRV were treated with
varying doses of PIs, and the numbers of infectious virions released by each drug-treated or no-drug control
culture were quantified in MAGIC-5A indicator cells.

Page 10 of 12

For HIV-1NL4-3, 293T/17 cells grown in 75 cm2 flasks
were digested with trypsin, seeded into 48-well plates at
6 × 10 4 cells/well, and placed in an incubator. The
following day (20-24 h), CaPO 4 -DNA co-precipitates
were prepared by mixing 5 μg of HIV-1 NL4-3 plasmid
DNA with 900 μl of 0.2 M CaCl2, adding the solution
dropwise with mixing into 900 μl of 2× Hepes-buffered
saline, and then incubating the suspension at room temperature for 10 min. During this time, chloroquine was
added to each 293T/17 culture well to a final concentration of 50 μM. Co-precipitate suspensions were then
mixed by pipetting and added directly to the chloroquine-treated cultures (20 μl/well), and the plates were
placed in the incubator for 10-12 h. Following this incubation period, the supernatants were aspirated and
replaced with 400 μl of fresh medium per well, and PIs
were added to the culture wells. The plates were then
returned to the incubator for 30-35 h. Supernatants (20
μl) from the transfected 293T/17 cultures were removed
without disturbing the cell monolayer and diluted 1:10,
1:100 and 1:1,000 in complete medium supplemented
with 20 μg/ml DEAE dextran. Infectious titers in the
diluted supernatants were measured in MAGIC-5A cells
as described above, except that inhibitors were omitted
from this phase of the assay.
For PI susceptibility assays with XMRV, HTX/LtatSN
cells that were infected with XMRV VP62 were trypsinized, rinsed twice with 1× PBS, resuspended in complete medium and seeded into 48-well plates at
approximately 5 × 104 cells/well. The cultures were then
immediately treated with PIs as described above for
HIV-1NL4-3. Following a 40-h incubation period, 180 μl
of culture supernatant was harvested from each well,
and DEAE-dextran was added to the samples to a final
concentration of 20 μg/ml. The supernatants were
diluted 1:4 and 1:16 in medium containing 20 μg/ml
DEAE dextran, and 100 μl each of the undiluted, 1:4and 1:16-diluted samples were transferred to MAGIC5A cultures for FFU determination as described above.
