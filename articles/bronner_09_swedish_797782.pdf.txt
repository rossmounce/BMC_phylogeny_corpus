Abstract
Plasmodium knowlesi is typically found in nature in macaques and has recently been recognized as
the fifth species of Plasmodium causing malaria in human populations in south-east Asia. A case of
knowlesi malaria is described in a Swedish man, who became ill after returning from a short visit
to Malaysian Borneo in October 2006. His P. knowlesi infection was not detected using a rapid
diagnostic test for malaria, but was confirmed by PCR and molecular characterization. He
responded rapidly to treatment with mefloquine. Evaluation of rapid diagnostic kits with further
samples from knowlesi malaria patients are necessary, since early identification and appropriate
anti-malarial treatment of suspected cases are essential due to the rapid growth and potentially lifethreatening nature of P. knowlesi. Physicians should be aware that knowlesi infection is an important
differential diagnosis in febrile travellers, with a recent travel history to forested areas in south-east
Asia, including short-term travellers who tested negative with rapid diagnostic tests.

Background
Plasmodium knowlesi occurs in nature in long-tailed and
pig-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca
nemestrina, respectively), that are commonly found in forested areas of south-east Asia [1]. Until a few years ago,
infection with P. knowlesi was regarded as a rare disease,
occurring only sporadically in humans [2]. The recent
findings of a large number of infected patients in Malaysia
[3-5], especially in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo and other
reports of human cases acquired in Thailand [6], Myanmar [7], the Philippines [8] and Singapore [9], have
changed the perception of P. knowlesi. This parasite is
clearly the fifth species of Plasmodium, causing malaria in
humans in south-east Asia [10]. It has the shortest erythrocytic cycle among the primate malarias, only 24 hours
[1], and high parasitaemias with fatal outcome in humans

can occur [4]. Under the microscope, it is not possible to
distinguish between P. knowlesi and P. malariae due to
their similar morphological characteristics [1,3,10].

Case presentation
In October 2006, a 35-year-old Swedish man presented to
hospital in Stockholm with a two-day history of fever,
sweats, headache and fatigue. He had a temperature of
40°C, but was otherwise in good general condition with a
normal respiratory rate and blood pressure. Laboratory
investigations revealed normal haemoglobin concentration (154 g/L), leucopaenia (2.2 × 109/L), moderate
thrombocytopenia (58 × 109/L) and an elevated C-reactive protein concentration of 109 mg/L (normal < 10 mg/
L). Plasma creatinine was normal, while plasma bilirubin
(31 μmol/L) was just above the upper limit of the normal

range and alanine transaminase (1.68 μcat/L) was slightly
increased (normal < 1.20 μcat/L).
The patient had recently returned from a two-week holiday in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. He had trekked in the
jungle of the Bario Highlands during the last seven days of
his holiday, at altitudes between 800 and 1,400 m. He had
not taken any anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis. His symptoms started 11 days after leaving the Bario Highlands.
There was a strong suspicion of malaria, and although a
rapid diagnostic test (Now® Malaria Test, Binax Inc.,
Maine, USA) was negative, oral mefloquine therapy was
started while waiting for the results of the blood film
examination. Malaria parasites were detected by microscopy in 0.1% of erythrocytes. The Plasmodium species
could not be identified conclusively, but Plasmodium
malariae was suspected, since late trophozoites were
observed and the infected red blood cells were not
enlarged (Figure 1). The patient improved rapidly following mefloquine treatment and was discharged afebrile

after two days. The lowest recorded haemoglobin and
platelet levels were 95 g/L and 34 × 109/L, respectively.
Two blood cultures were negative and a pulmonary x-ray
was normal.
Due to the uncertain identification by microscopy, PCR
assays for P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium
ovale and P. malariae were performed in Sweden. These
assays were negative, but microscopy results that were suggestive of P. malariae and the patient's travel history led to
the suspicion of a P. knowlesi infection. A frozen blood
sample, collected when the patient was admitted to hospital, was sent to the Malaria Research Centre at University
Malaysia Sarawak for further analysis. The infection was
identified as a single P. knowlesi infection following DNA
extraction and examination by PCR assays for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi as
described previously [3]. PCR amplification, cloning and
sequencing of the A-type small subunit ribosomal (SSU r)
RNA gene was also undertaken, followed by phylogenetic

analysis as described earlier [3]. The SSU rRNA gene
sequence of the malaria parasite from the Swedish patient
was phylogenetically indistinguishable from those of
other P. knowlesi isolates (Figure 2).

tion in a Swedish traveller returning from Malaysian Borneo, this indicates that knowlesi malaria infections in
travellers are probably not rare events, particularly since
south-east Asia has become a popular tourist destination.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this report shows that P. knowlesi can infect
short-term visitors to areas in south-east Asia, where
knowlesi transmission occurs, and mefloquine was an
effective anti-malarial. The P. knowlesi infection in the
Swedish traveller was not detected by a rapid diagnostic
test and evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests with further
samples are necessary since early identification and
appropriate anti-malarial treatment of suspected cases are
essential, due to the rapid growth and potentially pathogenic nature of knowlesi malaria. Physicians should,
therefore, be aware that knowlesi infection is an important differential diagnosis in febrile travellers with a recent
travel history to forested areas in Southeast Asia, including
short-term travellers, who tested negative with rapid diagnostic tests.

The nested PCR assay and molecular characterization confirmed that the patient was infected with P. knowlesi. Since
the incubation period of P. knowlesi in the liver is 9 to 12
days [2], this indicates that he most probably acquired his
infection while jungle trekking in the Bario Highlands of
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.
Plasmodium knowlesi parasites morphologically resemble
those of P. malariae [1,2,10] and PCR assays can correctly
differentiate between the two species [3]. However, PCR
assays are not a rapid method of detection and are not a
viable option for routine diagnosis. Rapid diagnostic tests
are becoming an increasingly popular method for diagnosis of malaria [11], particularly by doctors on call and
medical laboratory technologists in non-malaria endemic
countries, who are not experienced in identifying malaria
parasites by microscopy. It is possible that the low parasitaemia may have been a contributing factor to the inability of the rapid diagnostic test to detect knowlesi malaria
in this Swedish patient, since these tests are not as sensitive as microscopy [12]. In a recent study of monoclonal
antibodies against Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase that
have been developed for use in a rapid diagnostic test, it
was shown that certain antibodies that were thought to be
specific for P. falciparum and P. vivax, also bind to P. knowlesi [13]. However, it remains to be determined whether
this, and commercially available rapid diagnostic tests, are
able to detect P. knowlesi infections by examining a larger
number of patient samples.
Early identification and adequate anti-malarial treatment
of suspected cases are essential since P. knowlesi has a 24hr erythrocytic cycle, and high parasitaemias with fatal
outcome in humans can occur [4]. Human P. knowlesi
infections resolve rapidly following treatment with chloroquine [3] and the current report indicates that mefloquine is also an effective anti-malarial for knowlesi
malaria. However, in severely ill knowlesi malaria
patients with high parasitaemias, management and treatment as for severe falciparum malaria has been recommended due to the rapid rate at which P. knowlesi can
multiply [4].
Previous reports of human knowlesi malaria infections
were of people that have either lived or worked in the forest and forest fringe areas of south-east Asia [10]. There
has been a recent report of a Finnish traveller, who
returned from Peninsular Malaysia with knowlesi malaria
[14]. Taken together with this report of P. knowlesi infec-
