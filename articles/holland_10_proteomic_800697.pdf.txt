Abstract
Background: The anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is a human skin commensal that
resides preferentially within sebaceous follicles; however, it also exhibits many traits of an opportunistic pathogen,
playing roles in a variety of inflammatory diseases such as acne vulgaris. To date, the underlying disease-causing
mechanisms remain ill-defined and knowledge of P. acnes virulence factors remains scarce. Here, we identified
proteins secreted during anaerobic cultivation of a range of skin and clinical P. acnes isolates, spanning the four
known phylogenetic groups.
Results: Culture supernatant proteins of P. acnes were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and all
Coomassie-stained spots were subsequently identified by MALDI mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). A set of 20
proteins was secreted in the mid-exponential growth phase by the majority of strains tested. Functional annotation
revealed that many of these common proteins possess degrading activities, including glycoside hydrolases with
similarities to endoglycoceramidase, b-N-acetylglucosaminidase and muramidase; esterases such as
lysophospholipase and triacylglycerol lipase; and several proteases. Other secreted factors included Christie-AtkinsMunch-Petersen (CAMP) factors, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and several hypothetical
proteins, a few of which are unique to P. acnes. Strain-specific differences were apparent, mostly in the secretion of
putative adhesins, whose genes exhibit variable phase variation-like sequence signatures.
Conclusions: Our proteomic investigations have revealed that the P. acnes secretome harbors several proteins
likely to play a role in host-tissue degradation and inflammation. Despite a large overlap between the secretomes
of all four P. acnes phylotypes, distinct differences between predicted host-tissue interacting proteins were
identified, providing potential insight into the differential virulence properties of P. acnes isolates. Thus, our data
presents a rich resource for guiding much-needed investigations on P. acnes virulence factors and host interacting
properties.

Background
The Gram-positive skin commensal Propionibacterium
acnes is ubiquitously present on human skin. It has
been speculated that this bacterium contributes to
healthy skin by deterring the colonization of severe
pathogens [1,2]; however, it is most well known for its
role in skin disorders such as acne vulgaris [3,4]. Acne,
a multifactorial disorder related to the formation of
comedones, hormonal stimulation, bacterial colonization
and the host inflammatory response, is an extremely

common condition affecting approximately 80% of adolescents. Despite intense research effort, the precise role
of P. acnes in acne formation is still unclear [5-7].
In addition to acne, P. acnes has been frequently associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases, including
prosthetic joint infections, shunt-associated central nervous system infections, endocarditis, sarcoidosis,
endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, allergic alveolitis, pulmonary angitis, acne inversa (alias hidradenitis suppurativa), and the SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis,
hyperostosis, osteitis) syndrome [8-10]. This bacterium
is also a common isolate of prostatic glands from
patients with prostate inflammation [11,12]. Interestingly, the role of P. acnes in the development of prostate

cancer through an inflammatory mechanism is currently
a subject of much speculation [12-14].
The prevalence of P. acnes in the above-mentioned
conditions suggests that this bacterium is an etiological
agent of infection and that it possesses an elevated
pathogenic potential. P. acnes has been shown to exhibit
haemolytic and cytotoxic activities [15,16] as well as
extensive immunostimulatory activity and complement
activation [6,17-20]. P. acnes isolates differ in their virulence properties, such as in their ability to trigger production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in
infected keratinocytes [21,22]. The genetic basis for this
has not yet been studied in detail. To date four phylogenetic groups of P. acnes have been described, designated
types IA, IB, II and III, based on sequence differences in
two genes, namely recA and tly [23,24].
Despite the apparent role of P. acnes in disease formation, information on putative pathogenic traits and antigenic substances of this bacterium is scarce. The complete
genome sequence of a cutaneous type IB isolate of P.
acnes (strain KPA171202) provided insights into the
pathogenic potential of P. acnes, revealing numerous gene
products with putative host tissue-degrading activities as
well as predicted cell wall-associated and secreted proteins,
the presence or activity of which might be involved in triggering host tissue inflammation [25]. Some of these proteins are differentially expressed among P. acnes isolates
and were shown to be immunoreactive [26].
To shed light on the biological relevance of predicted
genes from the genome sequence, we used a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and
matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) to identify proteins secreted by P.
acnes. Isolates representing all four phylotypes were
investigated. Several hydrolases and putative virulence
factors were secreted by all strains tested. These factors
are potential host-interacting factors, likely important in
inflammatory responses to P. acnes, as observed in acne
vulgaris. Thus, our data provide a basis to guide further
in-depth studies on individual factors.

Results and Discussion
Choice of P. acnes strains

We selected five strains of P. acnes for analysis of their
secreted proteins. These strains, representing all known
P. acnes phylotypes, i.e. types IA, IB, II and III, were isolated from a range of tissue sites: a type II skin acne isolate (strain 329); a type III strain isolated from a postoperative prosthetic joint infection (strain 487); a type
IA strain isolated from a pleuropulmonary infection
(strain 266); and two type IB strains: a skin isolate for
which the genome sequence is available (strain
KPA171202; KPA); and an isolate from a cancerous
prostate (strain P6).

2-DE-MALDI-MS analysis of P. acnes culture supernatants

To identify proteins secreted by P. acnes using proteome
analysis, we cultured each strain under anaerobic conditions in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth, previously
used for secretome analyses [27]. Growth curves were
generated (data not shown) and culture supernatants
were harvested in the mid-exponential phase. Precipitated proteins from supernatants were separated by 2DE and Coomassie stained, generating reproducible
secretomes of all five strains tested (Fig. 1A-E and additional file 1). All visible protein spots were analyzed by
MALDI-MS and searched against the NCBI non-redundant database, which included (at the time of analysis)
the genome sequence of the type IB strain KPA and the
partial genome sequence of the type IA strain SK-137.
The identified proteins for each strain, with molecular
weights, isoelectric points, Mascot scores and sequence
coverage are listed in additional file 2. In total, 64, 63,
54, 30, and 28 protein spots for P. acnes strains 266,
KPA, P6, 329 and 487, respectively, were unambiguously
identified and assigned to database entries. Several proteins occurred in spot series, representing different protein species of the same protein. Post-translational
modifications are a likely explanation, resulting in
altered molecular masses and/or isoelectric points [28].
A few MS spectra originating from secreted proteins of
strain 329 could not be assigned to any database entry
(Fig. 1D, spots 39-41), indicating that these proteins are
strain-specific. The inability to identify these proteins
also reflects the absence of genome sequence data from
type II and type III strains; only genome sequences from
type I strains are currently available.
Twenty commonly secreted proteins of P. acnes

The identified proteins secreted by the five strains tested
were assigned to the reference KPA genome (Fig. 2,
additional file 2). A set of 20 proteins was secreted by at
least three of the five strains, including eight proteins
secreted by all strains (Table 1). All 20 proteins were
secreted by the P6 strain, whereas 19 (95%), 15 (75%),
15 (75%) and 12 (60%) of these proteins were secreted
by the KPA, 266, 329 and 487 strains, respectively. We
cannot exclude, however, that proteins secreted at lower
levels were missed by our approach, as the amount of
secretion varied between the strains and the sensitivity
of the Coomassie stain is limited to the 100 ng range.
All 20 proteins except one, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), carried a secretion signal in its N-terminus. P. acnes has a general secretion
(Sec)/signal recognition particle (SRP) and a twin-arginine translocation (TAT) secretion system. Other secretion systems have not been reported for P. acnes, and
rescanning of the genome sequence gave no indication
that additional ones exist.

Hydrolytic enzymes are secreted by P. acnes

To gain insight into the biological functions of the 20
commonly secreted proteins, re-annotation was performed based on similarity searches against protein
sequence and protein-domain/-family databases (Table
1). Many of the secreted proteins were found to have
predicted hydrolytic activities: two genes (PPA0644 and
PPA2106) are predicted endo-glycoceramidases, sharing
42% identity on the protein level. Although their substrate specificities are unknown, PPA0644 and PPA2106
share 27% and 30% protein identity, respectively, with
the characterized and structurally analyzed endo-glycoceramidase II from Rhodococcus sp., which hydrolyzes
glycosidic linkages between the oligosaccharide and ceramide moieties of gangliosides [29]. Another secreted
protein, PPA2164, a glycoside hydrolase family 3 protein, shares 31% identity on the protein level with NagZ
(formerly YbbD) of B. subtilis. NagZ is a b-N-acetylglucosaminidase involved in the peptidoglycan recycling
pathway; it cleaves the terminal non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine of muropeptides [30]. P. acnes also secreted
a putative lysozyme (PPA1662) which is 47% identical
on the protein level to the muramidase from Streptomyces coelicolor. This muramidase not only cleaves the
b-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid
and N-acetylglucosamine units, but also exhibits b-1,4N,6-O-diacetylmuramidase activity, enabling this enzyme
to degrade Staphylococcus aureus cell walls [31].
Whether PPA1662 is an autolytic lysozyme involved in
cell wall turnover has still to be elucidated. However,
the peptidoglycan of P. acnes contains non-N-acetylated
glucosamine residues and is therefore resistant to lysozyme [32]. We speculate that PPA1662 has a different
substrate specificity, acting on non-N-acetylated peptidoglycan, or, alternatively, it acts as a defense system
against competing bacteria on the skin.

Two strains, KPA and 329, secreted a hyalorunate
lyase (PPA0380), confirming previous investigations on
a P. acnes protein with hyalorunate lyase activity
[33,34]. Preliminary functional characterization
revealed that the enzyme exerted activity against chondroitin 4- and 6-sulphates but not against dermatan
sulphate [33]. In accordance, the closest characterized
homolog, the chondroitin lyase of Arthrobacter aurescens (37% protein identity to PPA0380) acts on chondroitin sulfate but not on dermatan sulfate [35].
Similar to other chondroitin lyases, it is capable of
cleaving hyaluronan, a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan
and a major component of the extracellular matrix of
connective tissues.
Consistent with the known lipolytic activity of
P. acnes [36], we identified lipolytic enzymes in the
secretory fraction, including the previously characterized triacylglycerol lipase, designated glycerol-ester
hydrolase A (GehA; PPA2105). GehA is recognized as
one of the virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of acne [37-39], and is thought to be the main
enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of sebum triacylglycerides, resulting in the release of glycerol and free
fatty acids. The released fatty acids are thought to be
inflammatory; they favor ductal hypercornification and
increase adhesion between P. acnes and cells of the
hair follicle, promoting colonization of P. acnes and
biofilm formation [37,40-42]. Furthermore, GehA itself
is a strong chemotactic factor [43]. Other secreted
esterases identified include a putative lysophospholipase (PPA2142) and a putative phosphoesterase
(PPA1498) with unknown specificities. Proteases,
another class of secreted hydrolases, were also
detected, e.g. a peptidase S8/S53 family protein
(PPA0598) among others; their substrate specificities
remain to be elucidated.

CAMP factors and other secreted proteins

A set of five highly similar P. acnes genes (PPA687,
PPA1198, PPA1231, PPA1340, PPA2108) in the genome
of P. acnes KPA encodes homologs to Christie-AtkinsMunch-Petersen (CAMP) factors, which are co-haemolytic proteins, found mainly in streptococcal species
[25,44,45]. CAMP factors have been characterized as
pathogenic determinants that exert lethal effects when

administered to rabbits and mice [46]. In addition,
streptococcal CAMP factors have been reported to act
as pore-forming toxins [47]. In agreement with previous
work [45], all P. acnes strains examined here were positive for the co-haemolytic CAMP reaction (data not
shown). Our secretome data showed that all tested
P. acnes strains secreted CAMP2 (PPA0687). In addition, the skin isolate KPA secreted CAMP4 (PPA1231).

Holland et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/230

Secretion of the other three CAMPs was not observed in
any strain using our approach. A previous study
reported variable production of CAMP factors in different P. acnes isolates, as detected by western blotting
experiments using different anti-CAMP sera [45]; the
authors reported an abundance of CAMP1 in type IB
and II strains. We did not find CAMP1 among the
secreted proteins; a discrepancy that could be due to the
detection limits of the different techniques used, i.e. our
MS analysis detects the most prominently secreted factors, whereas immunoblotting is a more sensitive
technique.
A key enzyme of glycolysis, GAPDH, was also secreted
by three out of the five P. acnes strains tested. At first
glance it is peculiar why a glycolysis enzyme should be
secreted; however, a number of studies have identified
GAPDH as an anchorless, multifunctional protein, displayed on the surface of several fungi and Gram-positive
pathogens, which contributes to adhesion and virulence
[48,49]. In Streptococcus pyogenes, this cell-associated
and soluble protein is also known as streptococcal surface dehydrogenase (SDH) and as a plasmin receptor
(Plr); its complement C5a-binding activity was shown to
play a role in evasion of neutrophil recruitment to sites
of infection [50]. Moreover, in S. agalactiae, GAPDH is
an immunomodulatory factor, exhibiting B lymphocytestimulatory activity [51].
In addition to the above-mentioned proteins, several
(conserved) hypothetical secreted proteins were
detected. Three of these hypothetical proteins are
encoded by a gene cluster (PPA0532-0534), with homologs only in Corynebacterium spp. Three additional
secreted proteins (PPA1715, PPA1939, PPA2175) are
unique to P. acnes; PPA1715 contains characteristic
repeats of the dipeptide proline-threonine (PT), similar
to other putative adhesins (discussed below), and
PPA1939 was secreted most strongly by all tested
strains. Future work will determine the function of this
abundantly secreted protein.
Strain-specific secretion of putative adhesions

As expected, the secretomes of the type IB strains, KPA
and P6, share a higher degree of similarity with each
other than with the other three strains tested. Nevertheless, we identified a few prominent differences between
KPA and P6: (i) KPA secreted both CAMP4 and
CAMP2. By contrast, P6 exclusively secreted CAMP2;
(ii) KPA was the only strain which secreted PPA2141, a
protein unique to P. acnes and with no homology to
proteins stored in any database. A likely explanation for
the KPA-specific expression of the gene encoding
PPA2141 is a duplication of a 12 bp repeat within the
5′-end of the gene in strains 266 and P6 (Fig. 3A). This
duplication results in the insertion of four amino acids

Page 6 of 11

just after the predicted cleavage site of the signal peptide, which potentially alter secretion; (iii) likewise,
PPA1880, which also has no existing homology to other
proteins but contains characteristic PT repeats (Fig. 3B),
was secreted exclusively by P6. Interestingly, PPA1880
possesses a phase variation-like signature - a stretch of
guanine residues, located within the putative promoter
region. Sequencing of the upstream region of PPA1880
revealed a variable number of guanine residues in the
three strains (11 nt in P6, 13 nt in KPA and 15 nt in
266) (Fig. 3C). Changes in the number of guanine residues alter the length of the spacer region of the putative
promoter. Thus, observed differences in spacer lengths 18 nt in P6 (close to the consensus length), 20 nt in
KPA and 23 nt in 266 - may explain why PPA1880
expression is P6-specific. Alternatively, if the guanine
tract is assumed to be part of the N-terminus of
PPA1880, frameshifts leading to truncated proteins
would be introduced in KPA and 266, but not in P6
(additional file 3).
A number of major differences were detected between
strains belonging to phylotypes IA and IB: In comparison to the two type IB strains (KPA and P6), strain 266,
a type IA strain, exhibited (i) reduced lysozyme
(PPA1662) secretion, and (ii) increased secretion of the
lipase GehA; (iii) in addition, strain 266 exclusively
secreted PPA2127. PPA2127 (also designated PA-25957)
is a host cell-surface attachment protein with dermatansulphate-binding activity and has immunoreactive properties [26]. The corresponding gene is associated with a
putative phase variation signature; variable expression in
different P. acnes strains has been observed and attributed to mutated start codons or alterations in the length
of the homopolymeric cytosine tract in the 5′-end of the
gene [26]. Comparison of PPA2127 gene sequences
from KPA, P6 and 266 revealed that the start codon was
mutated in KPA. In strain P6 the length of the cytosine
tract was altered, leading to a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon (Fig. 3D). In addition, the number of PT repeats within the C-terminus
of PPA2127 varied. These repeats were more numerous
in strain 266 as compared to the two type IB strains
(Fig. 3E).
Strain 329, a type II strain, secreted a few proteins
(Fig. 1D, spots 39-41) which could not be assigned to
any known protein. MALDI-MS identification and subsequent homology searches against the genomes of P.
acnes and the whole NCBI database retrieved no significant matches, indicating that these proteins are unique
to strain 329.
Strain 487, a type III strain, secreted fewer factors
than any of the other strains. One protein, PPA1758, an
outer membrane lipoprotein of the periplasmic binding
proteins (PBPs) superfamily, was secreted solely by

strain 487. PPA1758 exhibits a 38% protein identity to
the membrane-associated glycylmethionine binding protein (GmpC) of Staphylococcus aureus [52], indicating a
potential role as a dipeptide transporter for PPA1758.
Secretome of P. acnes 266 in stationary growth phase

To investigate growth phase-dependent secretion, P.
acnes was grown to stationary phase. We selected strain
266 for this analysis as it was found to aggregate
strongly upon reaching the stationary phase (additional
file 4). 2-DE/MALDI-MS analysis of strain 266 culture
supernatants revealed approximately half of the identified spots (33 out of 65) corresponded to proteins
already identified as being secreted during the midexponential phase (Fig. 4 and additional file 5). The
other spots corresponded to proteins mainly involved in
key metabolic pathways and that are known to be primarily located in the bacterial cytoplasm. Thus, it is
most likely that lysis of P. acnes occurred in the stationary phase, releasing the most abundant cytosolic proteins. Enzymes of key pathways such as glycolysis,
pyruvate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle
were identified, including phosphoglyceromutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, fumarate hydratase, and succinyl-CoA synthetase. In
addition, we detected amino acid-converting proteins, i.
e. serine hydroxymethyltransferase, tryptophanase and
ornithine carbamoyltransferase. Other identified proteins
included elongation factors, catalase, 10 kDa chaperonin

as well as the fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme acyl-carrier-protein S-malonyltransferase. Only two proteins
with a typical signal peptide, which were not detected in
the exponential phase-secretome, were identified:
PPA2152, an extracellular solute-binding protein, and
PPA2210, another protein containing a long stretch of
PT repeats. PPA2210, designated as dermatan-binding
protein PA-5541, was previously identified as being
immunoreactive [26] and shares many properties with
the above-mentioned protein PPA2127 (PA-25957). To
unambiguously identify the stationary phase secretome
of P. acnes future work is required to reduce the number of ‘contaminating’ (i.e. cytoplasmic) proteins; for
instance, the choice of the culture medium might influence cell lysis. In addition, it is necessary for comparative reasons to determine the complete proteome of the
cytoplasmic fraction.

Conclusions
Despite the ubiquitous presence of P. acnes, our knowledge of this bacterium remains limited, in particular
regarding the factors allowing its growth on human tissues. Many studies have shown that P. acnes has the
ability to act as an opportunistic pathogen, with suggested etiological roles in a variety of inflammatory diseases. Due to its immune-stimulatory activity, it seems
plausible that P. acnes causes inflammation within
blocked sebaceous follicles or when it grows in tissue
sites unaccustomed and/or hostile to this anaerobic bacterium. Hence, the ability of P. acnes to acquire and
process growth substrates from its host, especially in the
harsh environment of human skin, is dependent on the
factors this bacterium secretes. The detection and identification of such factors are therefore important steps
in further understanding P. acnes pathogenesis. Our
study has highlighted the prevalence of secreted hydrolases likely to be involved in degrading human tissue
components. Other identified proteins such as immunoreactive adhesins have a putative role in virulence.
Secreted factors may also fulfill other functions such as
defending against competing organisms and the evasion
of the immune response. Functional characterization of
these secreted factors is a necessary and logical next
step, which requires the development of appropriate
tools, e.g. a mutagenesis approach to create P. acnes
knock-out mutants. Another challenge for the future
lies in the elucidation of the molecular basis for
observed differences in virulence between P. acnes isolates. The relationship between phylotypes (based on
recA/tly sequences) and strain properties remains
obscure; some properties, for instance the ability to trigger production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in keratinocytes, seem to be phylotype-specific
[21,22], whereas other properties, e.g. biofilm formation,

Holland et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/230

are not [53]. Recent work has shown that an extended
typing method based on serotyping in tandem with
sequence comparison of three genes (trigger factor, p60,
and mce) could distinguish invasive from non-invasive
P. acnes isolates [54]; thus, this approach may be more
appropriate for typing P. acnes isolates. In addition, our
secretome analyses has revealed differences not only
between but within phylotypes. A more extensive comparative analysis of P. acnes isolates incorporating robust
phylotype identification will help to further our understanding of strain specificities.

Methods
Bacteria and growth conditions

The following P. acnes strains were used: 266 (type IA),
P6 and KPA171202 (both type IB), 329 (type II), and
487 (type III). Strains 266, 329 and 487 were kindly provided by Oliver Knapp and Michel Popoff (Institut Pasteur). Strain KPA171202 was obtained from DSMZ
(German German Collection of Microorganisms and
Cell Cultures) and strain P6 was isolated from a cancerous prostate [55]. All P. acnes strains were cultured at
37°C on Brucella agar plates under anaerobic conditions
for three days. Plate-grown bacteria were resuspended
and washed in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth. Twenty
ml BHI broth was inoculated with P. acnes (OD600 0.01)
and grown for 12-72 h at 37°C and 160 rpm in an anaerobic jar. After 14-18 h, the cultures typically reached
the mid-exponential growth phase with an OD600 of 0.50.6. Stationary phase was obtained after 72 h of growth.

containing ampholytes in the pH range 2-11. The SDSPAGE of the second dimension was performed using
15% acrylamide gels (7 cm × 8 cm). Protein spots were
visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 [58].
MALDI-MS

Protein spots were identified by MALDI-MS after ingel tryptic digestion of excised spots [59]. The peptide
mixture was solubilized in 1 μl 33% acetonitrile/0.3%
trifluoroacetic acid. For MALDI-MS measurement,
0.25 μl of the solubilized peptides were mixed with
0.75 ml a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) and
spotted onto a MALDI plate. A 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with a mass range of 8004000 Da was used for MS and at least 3 MS/MS spectra were measured per spot. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and MS/MS data were searched against the
complete NCBI Database (Version 20090513). Proteins
were identified using MASCOT 2.1 http://www.
matrixscience.com allowing a peptide mass tolerance
of 30 ppm and ± 0.3 Da for the fragment mass tolerance. A maximum of one missed cleavage, oxidation of
methionine, N-terminal acetylation of the peptide, propionamide at cysteine residues and N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formation were considered in these
searches. The identification criteria were: minimum
30% sequence coverage; or minimum 15% sequence
coverage and one MS/MS confirmation; or sequence
coverage below 15% and at least two MS/MS
confirmations.

Precipitation of extracellular proteins

The exponential cultures were centrifuged for 15 min at
20,000 × g and 4°C, and the supernatant was filtered
through a 0.22-μm-pore-size membrane filter to remove
residual bacteria. Extracellular proteins were precipitated
using a modified trichloroacetic acid (TCA) method as
described previously [56]. In brief, the filtrate (100 ml)
was mixed with 100% TCA to a final concentration of
10% and incubated overnight at 4°C. The mixture was
centrifuged for 30 min (20,000 × g and 4°C) and the
resulting pellet resuspended in 100 ml of acetone and
dissolved using an ultrasonic water bath. The mixture
was centrifuged as before, washed twice with acetone
and the resulting pellet air dried.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis

Protein samples were solubilized for 30 min at ambient
temperature in 9 M urea-1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)-70
mM dithiothreitol (DTT)-2% Servalyte 2-4 (Serva). Protein species were separated by a small-gel 2-DE system
[57]. The samples containing 200 μg of protein were
applied to the anodic side of the isoelectric focusing gel

DNA isolation, PCR and sequencing

DNA from P. acnes was isolated using the MasterPure™
Gram Positive DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre). Typing
of P. acnes strains by recA/tly sequencing was performed
as described previously [23]. For the analysis of the
repetitive elements of PPA1880, PPA2127, and PPA2141
the PCR primers listed below were used to amplify 400500 bps of the corresponding genomic region in strains
P6, KPA and 266. PCR reactions were carried out using
the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), which
has a proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. PCR products were subsequently sequenced using the same primers. Primers: PPA1880_N_for CACTGTACGGAC

Re-Annotation

All identified proteins were re-annotated, i.e. homology
searches against sequence databases such as GenBank, and
protein-domain/family databases, i.e. Pfam and InterPro,
were performed. Homologous proteins in other bacteria
were only discussed if sequence similarity to P. acnes proteins exceeded 25% on the protein level, with an overlap of
the query and subject sequence of at least 90%.
Accession numbers

The sequences reported in this study were deposited in
GenBank. Sequences of recA/tly for the typing of the
five strains have accession numbers HM461111 to
HM461117. Sequence data from PPA1880, PPA2141,
and PPA2127 have accession numbers HM461118 to
HM461123.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Secreted proteins of different P. acnes strains.
Bacteria were grown in BHI medium to an OD (600 nm) of 0.6. Proteins
in the culture supernatants were precipitated using 10% TCA and
separated on 2D-PAGE gels. (A) Second and (B) third replicate of the

Additional file 3: Alternative consequence of guanine stretch
alterations upstream of PPA1880. The homopolymeric guanine stretch
could be part of the N-terminus of PPA1880. The different lengths of the
G tract would lead to the formation of truncated proteins in strains KPA
and 266 due to the appearance of a premature stop codon in the
respective reading frame. Only in strain P6 a full protein would be
synthesized.
Additional file 4: Adherence/agglutination of P. acnes strains grown
to stationary phase. 2 ml BHI medium per well was inoculated with the
indicated five P. acnes strains (OD600 nm 0.01) and grown to stationary
phase (72 h) under anaerobic conditions (37°C, 110 rpm). Strain 266
agglutinated stronger than the other strains. Shown are two
independent experiments.
Additional file 5: MS-based identification of all protein spots
originating from the stationary phase culture supernatant of P.
acnes strain 266. This table lists all MS-identified proteins that were
separated by 2-DE (see Figure 4).
