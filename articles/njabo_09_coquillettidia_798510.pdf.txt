Abstract
Background: The mosquito vectors of Plasmodium spp. have largely been overlooked in studies
of ecology and evolution of avian malaria and other vertebrates in wildlife.
Methods: Plasmodium DNA from wild-caught Coquillettidia spp. collected from lowland forests in
Cameroon was isolated and sequenced using nested PCR. Female Coquillettidia aurites were also
dissected and salivary glands were isolated and microscopically examined for the presence of
sporozoites.
Results: In total, 33% (85/256) of mosquito pools tested positive for avian Plasmodium spp.,
harbouring at least eight distinct parasite lineages. Sporozoites of Plasmodium spp. were recorded
in salivary glands of C. aurites supporting the PCR data that the parasites complete development in
these mosquitoes. Results suggest C. aurites, Coquillettidia pseudoconopas and Coquillettidia metallica
as new and important vectors of avian malaria in Africa. All parasite lineages recovered clustered
with parasites formerly identified from several bird species and suggest the vectors capability of
infecting birds from different families.
Conclusion: Identifying the major vectors of avian Plasmodium spp. will assist in understanding the
epizootiology of avian malaria, including differences in this disease distribution between pristine and
disturbed landscapes.

Background
Avian malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium
(Haemosporida, Plasmodiidae), are cosmopolitan mosquito-transmitted haematozoa [1,2]. In contrast to

human malaria, avian malaria has a worldwide distribution and is caused by approximately 50 species of Plasmodium [3,4]. The widespread geographic distribution of
avian malaria parasites and their broad range of avian

hosts make them excellent models for exploring the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of vector-host-parasite
associations.
Although some 50 species of avian Plasmodium have been
identified using phenotypic characters [2,4], molecular
data reveal remarkable genetic diversity of these parasites,
indicating that the number of avian Plasmodium species
and their taxonomic diversity may be greater than is
accepted in the current classifications [5]. Avian Plasmodium are transmitted wherever the mosquitoes, susceptible birds and minimum temperature and humidity
requirements are available. Many species of avian Plasmodium appear to have evolved with their hosts and do not
typically cause lethal disease [6], although there are
numerous reported cases of pathology and even high
mortalities when naïve birds are exposed for the first time
[6-8].
Although general patterns of the epizootiology of avian
malaria have been well studied [9-11], little is known
about the vectors and the parasites diversity within the
vectors, an essential step in the avian malaria transmission
cycle. Species within multiple mosquito genera (Culex,
Aedes, Culiseta, Anopheles, Mansonia and Aedeomyia) have
been implicated in the transmission of different species of
avian Plasmodium [2,12-16]. Despite the presence of
numerous ornithophilic species within the genus Coquillettidia only one report was found relating presence of sporozoites of Plasmodium gallinaceum and an unidentified
Plasmodium sp. in the salivary glands of Coquillettidia
crassipes [17]. Recently, DNA of a Haemoproteus species
was isolated from 1/77 Coquillettidia xanthogaster collected
in Vanuatu [18]; however, it is unclear if this parasite completes its life cycle in this mosquito.

During recent surveys of the lowland forests of Cameroon
four species from the genus, (Coquillettidia aurites, Coquillettidia pseudoconopas, C. metallica and Coquillettidia maculipennis) were collected. These four species are endemic to
Africa with known distributions in West, Central and East
Africa [27,28]. They all are crepuscular [29,30], rarely bite
man or other mammals [31] and prefer birds as hosts
[32,33]. West Nile, Middleberg and Sindbis viruses have
been isolated from C. metallica; while Tataguine, Simbu
and Usutu viruses, closely related to West Nile and formerly recorded as this pathogen, have been isolated from
C. aurites [32,34]. The viruses associated with C. pseudoconopas are not yet known [25]. Prior to this study, none
of these species were implicated as vectors of malaria.
The avifauna of Cameroon is relatively well-studied and
prior studies for blood parasites have identified Plasmodium spp. in many of the avian hosts [2,4,35-37], but little
is known of the vectors.
The objectives of this paper were to: 1) use high throughput molecular genetic screening techniques of wild collected mosquito heads and thoraces to test for the
presence of Plasmodium spp., 2) investigate the spatial distribution of the parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt
b) sequence lineages found in Coquillettidia spp., 3) microscopically examine the salivary glands of the wild-caught
mosquitoes for presence of sporozoites, which are the last
stage of development of malaria parasites in vectors, and
4) compare the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of these lineages to published lineages found in
other mosquito vectors and birds in Cameroon. This is the
first molecular exploration of avian vector-avian hostmalaria parasite relationships in Africa.

Methods
In this study, the role of Coquillettidia spp. (Diptera, Culicidae) collected in the lowland forests of Cameroon as
potential vectors of avian malarial parasites was explored.
Coquillettidia is treated as a genus [19-21], rather than a
subgenus of Mansonia [22-25]. Worldwide there are 57
described Coquillettidia species [21] with twenty-two from
Africa. Coquillettidia spp. adults are medium in size and
can easily be confused with Aedes and Culex mosquitoes,
but all species (shared only with the genus Mansonia) have
the unusual larval behaviour of attaching to air cells of
aquatic plants to obtain oxygen for respiration [26].
Immature stages are mostly found in permanent bodies of
water and only float to the surface as pupae just prior to
eclosion. The integuments of most of the African species
are bright yellow or have a yellow to greenish hue, which
readily distinguishes them from other African mosquitoes
[27]. Only one species, Coquillettidia metallica, has a dark
body and legs [25].

Sampling sites and habitat characterization
Sampling took place from June–August, 2007 and April–
May 2008 at 20 sites in the lowland forests of Cameroon
(Figure 1). Coquillettidia spp. were only found at four of
those sites, Mvia (N03.5105° E010.0176°) Nk'leon
(N02.3974° E010.0452°), Ndibi (N 03.774897°
E12.201532°), and Nkouak (N03.86735° E013.31634°).
The majority (95%) of the total numbers of Coquillettidia
mosquitoes were collected in Ndibi and Nkouak. The lowland forests of southern Cameroon have a humid equatorial climate with three dry months characterized by
alternating two dry seasons and two wet seasons (the big
dry season between mid-November to mid-March, the
small wet season from mid March to mid June, the small
dry season from mid June to mid August, and the large wet
season from mid August to mid November) [38]. The
average annual temperature of the region is about 23°C
(22.8°C in July to 24.6°C in April) [39].

Sampling locations of mosquitoes in the lowland forest areas of Cameroon. Areas where Coquillettidia sp were
recorded are indicated by filled triangles.

Sampling was done at Mvia in June 11–13, 2007; Nk'leon
in July 28–31, 2007; Ndibi, in August 21–26, 2007 and
May 2–16, 2008; and Nkouak in August 27–31 2007 and
again in May 17–29 2008. Nkouak is the most forested
with the lowest human population density with fewer
than 1000 people. The village is surrounded by swamps,
which are the sources of the Nyong and Bomba rivers.
Nkouak has three major vegetation types: (1) secondary
forest immediately surrounding the village where locals
have planted cocoa, coffee, some palms and other cash
crops (2) mature secondary forest where very little human
activity occurs, (3) mature forest, which is quite distant
from the village and contain major wild life. Ndibi is characterized by secondary forest in various stages of degradation and seasonally flooded swamp forest (September to
December) with floating grass plant communities along
either side of the Nyong river [39]. Ndibi has a comparatively higher human population density and is less than 2
km from the city of Akonolinga (pop. 25, 700) across the
River Nyong.

Mosquito collections and preparation
Light trapping (mini CDC light traps) effort per site
ranged from four to 15 trap nights. No notable changes in
the weather occurred during the collection period that
might bias comparisons of mosquito abundance.

In 2007, mosquitoes were collected using six Center for
Disease Control (CDC) Miniature Light Traps (Figure 2,
[40]) baited with CO2 (John W. Hock, Gainesville, FL),
following protocols for proper use and assembly provided
with the traps. In the 2008 sampling season, a more comprehensive mosquito collection scheme was carried out in
Ndibi and Nkouak that included use of six miniature CDC
traps, four net traps (Figure 2, [41]), four modified bird
baited Ehrenberg lard cans (Figure 2, [42]) and sweep net
collections of resting mosquitoes in forest vegetation (Figure 2). To escape the heat and wind, mosquitoes rest in
more humid conditions under leaves in shaded thick
clumps of vegetation. At the collection sites, the surrounding forest offered many such resting sites. The use of CO2

clues to identification of females collected in the baited
traps. Sweep net collections were performed for an hour
each day (3.00 pm–4.00 pm) in low-lying grasses and
shrubs along the edges of foot paths and clearings in the
forest floor. Females collected in the sweep nets were also
used for Plasmodium spp. DNA isolation.

(John W. Hock, Gainesville, FL) and birds (feral pigeons)
as bait in the net traps was alternated. CO2 sachets and
birds (confined within a cage) were placed in the middle
of the net trap. In 2008 the lights from the CDC traps were
switched off in order to reduce damage to mosquitoes (for
morphological identification purposes) that would have
been caused by thousands of captured moths and other
arthropods attracted to light. In order to fully explore
microhabitat preference and help broaden the sampling
of the mosquito community, traps of each kind were
placed along a vegetation gradient from the floating mat
community, through the grass sedge meadow and upland
forest and plantations to the swamp forest.
Traps were set out each day for at least 12 h (6.00 pm–
06.00 am). Following each trapping period, the collection
bags were removed from traps and the mosquitoes immobilized with chloroform and/or smoke within two hours
of trap closing. On the same day following the collection
and immobilization, mosquitoes were sorted by sex and
identified to species with the aid of a stereomicroscope (×
90) and morphological keys [25,27]. Bird baited and CO2
baited traps collect predominantly blood-seeking females,
and in many African mosquitoes, Culicidae closely related
species can only be identified by examination of the male
genitalia. This was the primary reason an attempt was
made to find males in resting vegetation to identify the
more cryptic species assuming that the males would give

Collections were made at 20 sites, in the lowland forests
of Cameroon, but trapping effort are analyzed for Ndibi
and Nkouak only where more than 95% of Coquillettidia
spp. were collected. Although resting mosquitoes were
also collected, only mosquitoes collected overnight were
used to calculate mosquitoes per trap night. For each site,
sampling date, trap type and species, whole unfed and
recently fed (blood meal still visible) mosquitoes were
pooled separately into groups of between three to 20 individuals, and stored in 95% alcohol in the field and later at
-20°C in the laboratory until DNA extraction and subsequent testing by PCR. Minimum field infection rates for
estimating Plasmodium spp. infection per thousand
pooled mosquitoes were calculated using the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methodology with 95% confidence skewness-corrected score
intervals [43].
Chi-square analysis was applied to compare maximum
likelihood infection rates (MLE) for all the Coquillettidia
spp. and the number of isolated Plasmodium spp. infections as a function of the number of mosquitoes collected
at each site. All statistical analyses were performed using
STATA.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
In the laboratory the head and thorax of each mosquito
was severed from the abdomens and pooled for DNA
extraction. Pools varied in size from 3–20 mosquitoes,
and DNA extraction followed modified procedures of Pilchart et al [44] and Ishtiaq et al [18] Briefly, sample pools
were homogenized with the aid of heat-sealed pipette tips
and 200 μL of total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol
except for the addition of 30 ml of 100 mg/ml dithiothreitol to the tissue digestion buffer [45]. The primer pairs
L1518 and H15730 were used to amplify ~510 bp fragments of cyt b of the parasites. Each PCR cocktail contained 5.0 μL 10× Qiagen PCR buffer, pH 8.3 (10 mM
Tris-CH1, pH 8.3 and 50 mM KC1, 0.01% NP-40), 1.5
mM MgCl2, 5 μL dNTP mix (10 mmol/L each), 0.3 μL Taq
DNA polymerase (1.25 U/reaction), 2.5 μL each primer
(0.1–0.5 μmol/L), 1 μL of 10% BSA buffer [46], 2 μL template DNA and the remaining volume of ddH2O up to
27.7 μL. The PCR thermal regime consisted of one cycle of
5 min at 95°C, 44 cycles of 0.5 min at 95°C, 0.5 min at
50°C, 0.45 min at 72°C, and a final cycle of 5 min at
72°C. Each extraction included a negative control (cock-

tail without the template DNA), which was screened to
detect potential contamination, and a positive control. All
positive pools were later subjected to nested PCR protocol
[47]. In the first PCR reaction, the cyt b gene was amplified
using primers HaemNF and HaemNR2 in a 25 μl volume
reaction. For the second PCR, 2 μl of the first PCR product
was used as template in a 25 μl volume with the primers
HaemF and HaemR2, including the same reagents and
under the same thermal regime as the first PCR, except
that 35 cycles were used instead of 20 cycles.
Additionally, to ensure that the positive results were DNA
from sporozoites and not from some undigested parasite
infected blood cells that might have persisted in the vector
digestive system (as remnants of blood meal), all positive
samples were screened for vertebrate DNA using the same
thermal regimes for the PCR reaction above, but with
primers L14724 and H15149.
Finally, to help ensure that failure to detect a parasite was
not due to poor DNA extractions, a fragment (650 bp) of
vector COI DNA [48] was also amplified using primers
LCO1490 and HCO2198 [49].
Positive or negative amplifications were evaluated as the
presence or absence of bands on 1.5% agarose gels. Samples that showed positive amplification were subjected to
dye terminator cycle sequencing reactions (30 cycles,
55°C annealing), and sequenced on ABI 3730 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) automated sequencers,
using Big Dye vs. 3.1. For all these samples, the mitochondrial cyt b gene was sequenced in two overlapping fragments using the same primer pairs described above.
Sequences were assembled with Sequencher 4.7 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), aligned in ClustalX
and manually corrected by eye. Because the sequences are
from coding genes, alignment was straight-forward.
Lastly, sequences were confirmed by BLASTN (basic local
alignment search tool) to be most closely related to avian
Plasmodium spp. cyt b (identical or nearly identical
matches to lineages posted in GenBank). Potentially new
and unique sequences were checked by additional
sequencing of the fragments. The electropherograms were
also checked for double nucleotide peaks to infer possible
cases of mixed infections of two or more different parasite
lineages. The new sequences have been deposited in the
GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database
(Accession numbers: GQ150187–GQ150196).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in PAUP* [50].
The compiled data set, excluding pools that showed indications of multiple infections, four additional species,
Plasmodium juxtanucleare, Plasmodium relictum, P. gallinaceum and Plasmodium elongatum, all of which are

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/193

known to be transmitted by other mosquitoes
[2,16,17,51] and three outgroup species of positively
identified avian haemoproteids, based on the phylogeny
in Valkiūnas et al [4] was used. Additionally, four parasite
lineages [36,52] recorded from numerous avian host species captured within the tropical lowland forests were
included. Phylogenetic relationships of the parasite lineages were estimated using MrBayes 3.1 [53]. The most
accurate available model of sequence evolution, the GTR
+ G model was used because this level of complexity is
warranted due to the extreme AT bias in Plasmodium mitochondrial genes [54,55]. The Markov chain was sampled
every 200 generations for 10 million generations. Bayesian posterior branch probabilities were obtained by taking the majority rule consensus of the sampled trees,
excluding the first 12,500 trees as burnin. Replicate runs
of the software, each with one cold and three heated
chains, produced essentially identical results. Nodal support for the final tree was assessed using ML100 nonparametric bootstrap replicates each with TBR branch
swapping. Additionally, PAUP* was used to estimate
mean pairwise distances between the different Plasmodium
lineages using the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) model with
uniform substitution rate among sites.
Microscopic examination of salivary glands of mosquitoes
Nine wild-caught female C. aurites collected from Ndibi in
February 2009 were dissected and salivary glands were
isolated on glass slides using traditional mosquito dissection methods [56]. The head of insects was cut off with a
razor and salivary glands were gently pressed out with a
slight pressure by a blunt needle on the thorax near the
base of the fore-legs. The glands were placed in a small
drop of phosphate buffered saline, ruptured by a gentle
pressure of a needle, and mixed with a minute drop of the
saline to produce a thin film. The preparations were airdried and fixed in absolute methanol in the field, and
then stained with Giemsa in the laboratory, as described
by Valkiūnas [2].

An Olympus BX61 light microscope equipped with Olympus DP70 digital camera and imaging software AnalySIS
FIVE was used to examine slides, prepare illustrations and
to take measurements. Entire films were examined at low
magnification (× 400) and recorded sporozoites were
studied at high magnification (× 1,000).
Representative preparations of sporozoites (accession
numbers 47721, 47722 NS) have been deposited in the
collection of the Institute of Ecology, Vilnius University,
Vilnius, Lithuania.

Results
Mosquito collection
In 2007 and 2008, 10,631 mosquitoes of at least 24 species were collected in Ndibi and Nkouak. Species of

Coquillettidia accounted for 17% of the total mosquitoes
collected (1,802/10,631) with over 76% captured with
CDC light traps alone (Table 1). Coquillettidia aurites was
by far the most common of the Coquillettidia species collected, comprising 71% of the species collected in Nkouak
and only 9% of the total collected in Ndibi. Coquillettidia
metallica accounted for 1.2% of the total, collected mostly
in Ndibi and only a single blood fed individual was captured in Nkouak. C. pseudoconopas was captured in
Nkouak, Mvia and Nk'leon and accounted for 15% of the
total species collected (Table 1). Only one individual of C.
maculipennis was captured in Ndibi during the entire season, so this species has been excluded from all the analyses. Relative population densities (light trap counts per
trap night), for C. aurites, calculated for each site showed
that Nkouak had a significantly higher number than
Ndibi. The spatial geographic distribution of the Coquillettidia spp. mosquitoes as a function of habitat use is shown
in Figure 3. Although no significant associations were
demonstrated between the number of Plasmodium spp.
isolations made from mosquitoes and any of the four
microhabitats that were analyzed, most species showed
(except for C. metallica that was mostly captured in open
habitats) a strong preference for swamp forest/upland forest and plantations than more open habitats.
Mosquito morphological considerations
Variation in dark apical scaling of sternites was found
among female and male C. aurites with some having no
dark scales, others with smattering of scales and in others
dark scales formed complete apical bands. Males were collected resting in lower forest vegetation and their genitalia
confirmed they were all C. aurites although the membranous expansion of gonostylus was not quite as large as

there was a significant preference for shaded areas (p =
0.04). No C. pseudoconopas was collected in Ndibi and Plasmodium DNA isolations were not associated with any of the
four microhabitats. Collections from the other sites represent less than 5% of the total and are not included in the
analysis.

that depicted in Service [25]. Images of male genitalia and
other morphological features of mosquitoes are deposited
in [57].
Variation in malaria prevalence among Coquillettidia
species
The number of positive pools in the three species is presented in Table 2. No vertebrate DNA was found in any of
the pools, which shows that only DNA of Plasmodium spp.
sporozoites (but not of blood stages of the parasites) was
amplified. Of the 256 (1285 individuals total) pools
screened for Plasmodium spp., 85 (33%) were positive for
parasites, yielding a maximum likelihood estimates
(MLE) of Plasmodium infections of 112.22/1,000 for C.
metallica, 84.04/1,000 for C. aurites and 35.4/1,000 for C.
pseudoconopas. Within the two sites however, C. aurites
showed a significantly higher MLE in Ndibi than in
Nkouak (Ndibi = 116.46/1000; Nkouak = 66.76/1000; χ2
= 13.49, p < 0.001), although Nkouak had a higher density of C. aurites (Figure 4). Average mosquito densities
within the sites ranged from 39.8 mosquito/trap-night in
Ndibi to 115 mosquito/trap-night in Nkouak, whereas
the average proportion of corresponding Plasmodium isolations ranged from 45.12% in Ndibi to 28.99% in
Nkouak.
Distribution of Plasmodium spp. lineages among
Coquillettidia spp
Parasite lineages based on 750 nucleotides of cyt b
sequence were distinguished after checking carefully
against the original chromatograms from the sequencing
gel. Parasite sequences differing by only a single nucleotide were considered the same phylogenetic species,
while numbered lineages differing by more than one
nucleotide substitutions, or at least 0.2% genetic distance
were considered separate phylogenetic species. At least
eight lineages of Plasmodium spp. were found from the
positive pools. Two of them were already known lineages
(PV11 and PV12) [36] and six were new lineages that were
named by assigning a number in sequential order
(PlasCoq1- PlasCoq6). The 8 lineages differed from one
another by 0.2 and 15.8% sequence divergence. Some of
these are small genetic distances, and likely represent
intraspecies divergence of avian Plasmodium [4] although
in some cases they are well beyond distances corresponding to good species [5]. Cytochrome b sequence divergence as low as 1.0% [58] has been observed between
named species of malaria parasites of mammals, although
biological 'species' boundaries of avian malarial parasite
lineages have not been clearly defined. Of the eight Plasmodium lineages found in this genus, C. aurites harboured
seven lineages; C. metallica at least two (including an additional co- infection which was not included in the analysis) and C. pseudoconopas harboured one. The most
common lineages (PV11 and PV12) were found to be une-

venly distributed in both regions (Figure 4) and represent
more than 88% of the lineages recovered from these mosquitoes. The other lineages were found in very few mosquitoes in both locations (Figure 4). Lineage PlasCoq6 is
widely divergent from the other lineages, and was only
recorded once in a pool sampled from Ndibi. These rare
lineages were re-sampled.
Microscopic examination of salivary glands of mosquitoes
Sporozoites were observed in salivary glands of two mosquitoes. Up to three sporozoites were observed in each
positive salivary gland smear. They were of elongated
shape typical for haemosporidian parasites, with nuclei
located approximately at the center (Figure 5). Nondeformed sporozoites (n = 3) averaged 9.9 μm in length
and 0.9 μm in width.
Distribution of lineages among avian hosts
Identical lineages identified based on sequence similarity
as posted on GenBank were found in parasites isolated
from birds belonging to different families of the Passeriformes and non Passeriformes by Blastn search. PV11 [36]
is an identical match to WA15 [52], while PV12 [36] is
identical to lineages WA9 and P46 [3,52]. Over 35 species
of birds from 11 families have been shown to be infected
with these lineages. The other lineages were relatively rare
and together comprised less than 12% of the total parasite
load in Coquillettidia spp. Lineages PlasCoq2 and
PlasCoq5 however showed a close relationship to PV11
(Figure 6). In general, the parasites obtained from Coquillettidia spp. consisted of closely related lineages also
found in birds of different families and these lineages do
not appear to be shared with lineages found in other mos-

quito species so far (Figure 6). While further sampling will
be necessary, it is possible that these parasites are only
transmitted by Coquillettidia spp.
Variation in parasite prevalence with respect to vector
abundance
The likelihood estimates of infection rate (MLE) was
examined as a function of the sample size of vectors by
asking whether less common species had different infection prevalence than more common species, assuming
that species were captured in CDC traps in proportion to
their relative abundance. Interestingly, the least and most
abundantly sampled species, C. metallica and C. aurites
respectively, had the highest maximum likelihood estimates of infection rates (Table 2). Because only few C.
metallica were collected, it was not possible to determine
if these high estimates of the likelihood infection rates
truly reflect the infection rates in nature. More sampling is
warranted to confirm this.
Phylogenetic analysis and distribution of Plasmodium

Figure 6 summarizes the most important phylogenetic
results of this study. Of the 85 pools infected with Plasmodium spp., 81 yielded sequence data of sufficient length to
be included in the phylogenetic analysis. The remaining
cases (n = 4), showed indications of multiple infections as
revealed by double peaks in the chromatogram, and were
not included in the analyses. However, some double
peaks were easily discernable for parasites lineages PV11
and PV12. All parasites were designated as avian Plasmodium spp. by phylogenetic affinity to published avian Plasmodium spp. cyt b sequences. Support for the nodes,

Discussion
Dissection of the midguts and salivary glands of mosquitoes, with subsequent microscopic examination of preparations of ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites, have
traditionally been used for the detection of malaria parasites in vectors [56,59-61]. These techniques, although
sensitive, are laborious, and demand fresh material. The
PCR procedure is sensitive enough to detect as few as 10
sporozoites in salivary glands and presence of a single
oocyst is easily identified by simple agarose gel analysis
[18], so this is a promising method for investigation of
avian malaria vectors.

Mosquitoes utilize a number of cues to first locate, and
then accept or reject a potential host [62,63]. A general cue
like CO2 may elicit host-seeking behaviour in a widerange of host specific mosquito species like Coquillettidia
spp. regardless of the source. However, when a mosquito

Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:193

locates a potential host through long-range broad-based
cues, another set of highly specific short-range cues ultimately lead to host acceptance or rejection. These results
show that CO2 was an effective cue for attracting Coquillettidia spp.
These results also show that the avian Plasmodium parasites can be consistently isolated from wild caught Coquillettidia spp. mosquitoes confirming some Coquillettidia
species as newly recognized major vectors for avian
malaria assuming these mosquitoes are susceptible at
least to some of the detected Plasmodium spp. lineages.
Because 1) sporozoites were detected in salivary glands of
Coquillettidia spp., and 2) only Plasmodium spp. complete
sporogony in mosquitoes [2], it is unlikely that the sporozoites recorded in salivary gland (Figure 5) might belong
to haemosporidian parasites belonging to other genera.
The size of the sporozoites coincides with the size of sporozoites of Plasmodium (Novyella) rouxi, a widespread
malaria parasite of passeriform birds [56]. To prove that
viable sporozoites develop in Coquillettidia spp., experimental infections of susceptible avian hosts are needed.
Interestingly, all the parasite lineages recovered from
Coquillettidia spp. clustered with parasites identified from
several bird species suggesting the vector's potential of
feeding on and infecting birds belonging to different families. These results therefore implicitly confirm the mostly
ornithophilic behaviour of these mosquitoes, and provide
a genetic link between the infected birds and the mosquito vector, thus defining a complete transmission cycle.
A more conclusive statement to determine mosquito-feeding specificity could be done by determining vertebrate
DNA in fed mosquitoes. The present study thus provides
clear directions for further experimental research on vectors of avian malaria in Africa.
Vector-parasite-avian host association
This study found that over 90% of the pools of Coquillettidia spp. that were positive consistently harboured certain
parasite lineages, which were closely associated to lineages isolated from different bird host groups. All the positive pools were screened for vertebrate DNA to confirm
that none had contaminant bird DNA, and the absence of
vertebrate DNA from all pools suggests that Plasmodium
spp. lineages were isolated from sporozoites rather than
amplified from blood stages of the parasites. At least one
previous study has suggested that Coquillettidia crassipes is
a natural vector of P. gallinaceum and another unidentified
Plasmodium sp. in Ceylon [17].

Recently, several new species and lineages of malaria parasites of the subgenus Novyella have been described from
African birds, Cyanomitra olivaceae and Andropadus latirostris from the same study sites where Coquillettidia spp.
were collected [4,37]. Interestingly, lineages of these para-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/193

sites were not found in Coquillettidia spp. It is thus probable that these lineages may not be transmitted by
Coquillettidia spp., but that Coquillettidia spp. may be
important vectors of eight other Plasmodium spp. lineages
described in the present study. Species identities of these
lineages remain unknown. It is not unprecedented for a
malaria parasite lineage to be restricted to infecting limited species within just one mosquito genus (but see
Valkiūnas [2] for avian malaria). For instance, five species
of anopheline mosquitoes serve as the major vectors for P.
falciparum in continental sub-Saharan Africa, and all five
species belong to the subgenus Cellia [64-68]. Such strict
vector specificity may however, not hold true for avian
malaria since these bird parasites are very diverse. In avian
malarial systems, the vectors of Plasmodium forresteri, P.
elongatum, P. juxtanucleare, P. gallinaceum, and Plasmodium
kempi do not belong to same genus [16,51,69]. If avian
Plasmodium spp. lineages seem to a large extend to be
host-generalists [5,59,70-72], one would expect expansion of parasites to occur freely if the appropriate vectors
are present.
Plasmodium spp. prevalence and diversity
At least eight Plasmodium spp. lineages were found in this
study, with two of the lineages, PV11 and PV12 being the
most common, occurring in over 88% of the positive
pools screened. The reason for the existence of multiple
distinct Plasmodium lineages found in mosquitoes of the
genus Coquillettidia (seven of which are found in C. aurites
alone) is not known, but may provide a plausible explanation for the co-occurrence of two or more parasite lineages in the same vertebrate host [36] and clarify the
contrasting views of Oaks et al [64] and Gager et al [73].
The former purported that multiple parasite species that
share a vertebrate host could be transmitted by the same
mosquitoes genera or species, while the latter's explanation for co-occurrence of congeneric malarial parasites in
an avian host to transmission by mosquitoes of different
genera. Further work with multiple independent markers
from different parts of the Plasmodium spp. genome
should be carried out to clarify species limits.

The genetic distance between recorded lineages ranged
between 0.2% and 17.4%. Because genetic differences
between lineages PV11, PlasCoq2 and PasCoq5 are small
(Figure 6), it is possible that these three lineages represent
genetic variations of the same species, as has been shown
to be the case with numerous lineages of avian P. relictum
and several avian Haemoproteus spp. [4,37]. Lineages with
genetic distances of <5% in cytochrome b gene has been
shown to be a measure representing intraspecific variation
in avian Plasmodium spp, although there are exceptions to
this rule [4]. Thus, the molecular criterion of > 5%
sequence divergence in cytochrome b gene for identification of haemosporidian species should be applied only

Page 9 of 12

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:193

through the careful linkage of molecular and microscopical data. Some of the genetic distances observed in this
study are within this range, and higher than the average
pairwise distances between Plasmodium cytochrome b
sequences from many other avian malaria studies [74], as
well as the average cytochrome b distance among three
most closely related human malarial parasites that are
known to be different species, i.e. Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale [58].

Conclusion
This study strongly suggests that Coquillettidia spp. are vectors of avian malaria in African rainforests. Six previously
unknown lineages of avian Plasmodium parasites were
uncovered, and high numbers of Plasmodium lineages in a
single vector species were detected; that includes the previously unknown lineages and two known lineages PV11
and PV12. The high diversity of Plasmodium parasites in
Coquillettidia spp. is unprecedented among ornithophilic
mosquitoes. Whether this diversity is due to their abundance in areas where they occur, their competitive or
immuno-competent abilities, or a combination of these
and other factors remains to be understood. Any link
between these factors and the success of Coquillettidia spp.
in anthropogenic landscapes would be greatly informative to effective vector control and avian malaria epidemiology studies.
