The structure of the Ca2+-binding, glycosylated
F-spondin domain of F-spondin - A C2-domain
variant in an extracellular matrix protein
Kemin Tan1* and Jack Lawler2*

Abstract
Background: F-spondin is a multi-domain extracellular matrix (ECM) protein and a contact-repellent molecule that
directs axon outgrowth and cell migration during development. The reelin_N domain and the F-spondin domain
(FS domain) comprise a proteolytic fragment that interacts with the cell membrane and guides the projection of
commissural axons to floor plate. The FS domain is found in F-spondins, mindins, M-spondin and amphiF-spondin.
Results: We present the crystal structure of human F-spondin FS domain at 1.95Å resolution. The structure reveals
a Ca2+-binding C2 domain variant with an 8-stranded antiparallel b-sandwich fold. Though the primary sequences
of the FS domains of F-spondin and mindin are less than 36% identical, their overall structures are very similar. The
unique feature of F-spondin FS domain is the presence of three disulfide bonds associated with the N- and Ctermini of the domain and a highly conserved N-linked glycosylation site. The integrin-binding motif found in
mindin is not conserved in the F-spondin FS domain.
Conclusion: The structure of the F-spondin FS domain completes the structural studies of the multiple-domain
ECM molecule. The homology of its core structure to a common Ca2+- and lipid-binding C2 domain suggests that
the F-spondin FS domain may be responsible for part of the membrane targeting of F-spondin in its regulation of
axon development. The structural properties of the FS domain revealed in this study pave the way for further
exploration into the functions of F-spondin.

Background
F-spondin was initially identified in the rat embryo floor
plate [1], a ventralizing structure implicated in the control of neural cell patterning and axon growth in the
developing vertebrate nervous system. The expression
level of F-spondin is high in the floor plate at the time
of axon extension [1]. Further studies have found that
F-spondin plays an important role in the outgrowth of
sensory [1], commissural [2] and hippocampal [3] neurons during development as well as in the migration of
distinct somite domains to neural crest [4]. F-spondin is
an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein with multiple
domains, including an N-terminal domain (reelin_N

domain) [5], an F-spondin (FS) domain and six thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) (Figure 1A). F-spondin,
which is secreted by cells within the floor plate, is proteolytically processed into fragments that differentially
bind to the floor plate cells or the basement membrane
[6]. The portion that binds to the floor plate cells acts
as a short-range repellent of commissural axons and
prevents their migration into the floor plate. Other portions of F-spondin that includes the FS domain accumulate at the basement membrane and support growth
cone migration [6]. The proteolysis of F-spondin and
the coordinated interaction of the different fragments
with the membrane of floor plate and the basement
membrane provide a combinatorial guidance signal for
commissural axons that cross the midline [6]. F-spondin
is also highly up-regulated in injured peripheral nerves
and it promotes outgrowth of sensory neurons [2]. An
antibody against the FS domain blocks neurite outgrowth, indicating the FS domain plays an active role in

runs with a Superdex™ 75 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), six

principal peak was calculated to be 22.7 kDa, which was smaller
than the calculated molecular mass of 27.23 kDa that does not

of the FS domain revealed a single band with a molecular mass
greater than 30 kDa (insert).

axon regeneration [2]. This observation is largely in
agreement with the fact that an F-spondin fragment that
lacks the TSRs is sufficient to promote neuronal differentiation [7].
The expression of F-spondin indicates that it also
functions outside the nervous system. F-spondin is
expressed in various organs including the ovary, lung,
kidney, small intestine, prostate [8] and testis [9].
Human and bovine F-spondins, initially called vascular
smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth-promoting factor
(VSGP), were first cloned from ovarian cDNA libraries,
and bovine F-spondin was purified from adult bovine
ovarian follicular fluid [8]. F-spondin may be a major
factor for SMC proliferation in the ovary. In vitro
experiments suggested that F-spondin may also contribute to the inhibition of angiogenesis via the functional
blockade of endothelial integrin avb3, which plays
important roles in angiogenesis [10]. It has been recently
shown that F-spondin is a promoter for cementoblastic
differentiation [11]. The molecule is up-regulated in

osteoarthritis, promoting prostaglandin production, collagen degradation and proteoglycan synthesis reduction,
probably via the activation of latent TGF-b [12].
The first identification of ligands for F-spondin came
from the studies of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease [13,14]. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type
I membrane protein. Its extracellular domain is initially
cleaved by a- or b-secretases and subsequently by gsecretase to secrete small peptides including Ab40 and
Ab42, which are the primary components of the amyloid-b fibrils found in Alzheimer’s disease. F-spondin
interacts with the extracellular domain of APP, blocks
APP cleavage by b-secretases, and eventually inhibits the
production of the Ab peptides by g-secretase [13,14]. A
working model suggested that F-spondin forms a heterotrimer assembly on the membrane with APP and
apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoEr2) in which the reelin_N domain and the FS domain interact with APP and
TSRs interact with apoEr2 [14,15].
Recently, the structure of mindin FS domain has been
reported [16]. Mindin is a member of the Mindin/Fspondin family [3,17] and an integrin-binding and pattern-recognition molecule for microbial pathgens
[16,18,19]. In this paper, we present the crystal structure
of human F-spondin FS domain. With the structures of
the N-terminal (reelin_N) domain [5,20] and TSRs [21]
of F-spondin characterized, the structure of FS-domain
is the last to be determined and studied.

Results and Discussion
Overview of FS domain structure

The core of the FS domain has an 8-stranded b-sandwich fold, with strands b4, b1, b8, and b7 forming one
b-sheet and strands b3, b2, b5 and b6 forming the other
sheet (Figure 2). The topology represents one of two
types of C2 domain b-sandwich folds [22]. The first
major variation of the FS domain, as compared to a
common C2 domain, is its long linker (38 amino acids)
between b2 and b3 strands, which actually forms two
anti-parallel a-helices, packed against the b3/b2/b5/b6
sheet. The second variation is its long linker (51 amino
acids) between the b7 and b8 strands. The linker first
crosses over to the b3/b2/b5/b6 sheet and forms a short
strand, b7’ (W353D354) that is anti-parallel to the edge
strand, b6 (Figure 2 and 3). It then runs above the b5b6 loop and turns back at Y363. The linker forms a second short strand, b7” (R377-P378), by b7’. The addition
of the two short strands is an expansion of the b3/b2/
b5/b6 sheet to a 6-stranded sheet. Additionally, a part
of the loop between b2 and a1 (G249-G250) runs in an
anti-parallel fashion by the b7” strand, forming two
mainchain-mainchain hydrogen bonds with the residue
I376 right before b7”. These two interactions (G249 N-

I374 O and G250 O-I374 N) do not define another b
strand.
The residues contributing to the hydrophobic core of
the FS domain are A205, Y207, L209 and F211 of the
b1 strand, I234 of the b2 strand, F305 and V307 of the
b4 strand, M314 and F316 of the b5 strand, as well as
A401, V403 and I405 of the b8 strand (Figure 4).
Based on the sequence conservation of these residues
among FS domains of F-spondins, mindins, M-spondin
as well as AmphiF-spondin, we predict that a C2
domain core structure should be conserved in these
proteins.

Disulfide bond pattern

The three consecutive cysteines (C199, C200 and C202)
before the b1 strands form three disulfide bonds with
C336 and C340 from the b6-b7 loop, and C415 after
the b8 strand at the C-terminal region, respectively
(Figure 2). None of these disulfide bonds is located
within the core of the b-sandwich domain. They are all
at the bottom of the FS domain and are associated with
N- and C-termini, especially the N-terminus, where they
seem to help define and stabilize the globular FS domain
(Figure 2). The construct for protein expression begins
from V191. In the electron density maps, D198 is the

(6). C(1-3) are in the fs1 repeat, C(4-5) are in the fs2
repeat and C(6) is in a region after fs2. In mindin, only
C(1) and C(4) exist, suggesting a possible disulfide bond
C(1)-C(4) linking fs1 and fs2. In AmphiF-spondin, C(2)
and C(5) are both missing and are replaced by a pair of
hydrogen bond forming residues, T190 and Q330 (Figure 4). This implies the second disulfide bond C(2)-C(5)
is also between fs1 and fs2 in other proteins. The
remaining cysteine (C(3)) of fs1 likely forms the third
disulfide bond with C(6) after fs2. These results are consistent with the conclusion that fs1 and fs2 are most
likely within a single domain. The functionality and the
evolution of the varied disulfide bond patterns are
unknown. A phylogenetic analysis using the alignment
in Figure 4 as an input suggests that FS domains of Fspondins and mindins have evolved separately from
their common ancestor [23]. The result largely agrees
with the observation that the numbers and the positions
of the exons that cover FS domains in genomic DNAs
are different between F-spondins and mindins.
C-termini of FS domains
Figure 3 The top of the FS domain. Besides Ca2+-binding site,
two of three SO42- groups (from crystallization buffer) identified in
the structure are associated with R226 and R227 on one side of the
top of the FS domain. The top of the FS domain is also rich in
aromatic residues and prolines. The b7-b8 loop covers most the of
FS domain on one side. When it turns at Y363, the sidechain of
Y363 dips into a pocket containing aromatic residues and prolines,
including P388 and F389. After the b7” short strand, four rings from
H384, P385, Y390 and P392 are parallel to each other in a row.
Additional aromatic residues from other loops are also found on the
top of the domain, including W215, W231, P324, W326, P352, W353,
Y363 and F383. All of these residues are either identical or highly
conserved in the FS domains of other proteins (Figure 4). The role
of these aromatic residues is unknown.

first N-terminal residue visible while the other seven
residues together with 6 vector-derived residues were
disordered in the structure. Interestingly, after the b8
strand, about 13 residues between C415 and D428 are
clear in the electron density maps. Two of them, I425
and V426, form a short strand (b8’) parallel to b8, providing structural stability to the C-terminal loop region
after C415.
There is a noticeable difference in the number of disulfide bonds in the FS domains of F-spondin and
mindin. Early understanding of the FS domain structure
was based on two very conserved sequence repeats, fs1
and fs2, which were suggested to represent two individual domains [17]. However, an analysis based on the
number of cysteine residues and their distribution actually suggested a disulfide bond pattern that was not in
agreement with the early prediction. In the F-spondin
FS domain, there are six cysteines, designated C(1) to C

The C-terminal region of FS domains is one of the most
diversified regions in the amino acid sequences (Figure
4). The location of the C-terminus of F-spondin or
mindin is different according to the structures of their
FS domains. In the construct of mindin [16], the C-terminus was truncated at R223, which is equivalent to
E413 of F-spondin. In the structure reported here, E413
is before C415 and on the structured C-terminal loop
between the b8 and the b8’ strands. In mindin, there is
no disulfide bond tethering its C-terminal region to its
N-terminus. The end of the b8 strand is L218 and the
following residue R219 starts to peel off from the
mindin FS domain (Figure 5A), resulting in disordering
of most of the other C-terminal residues of the construct [16]. In F-spondin, residue A409, the equivalent
of R219 in mindin, is the third residue from the end of
the b8 strand (Figure 4). The C-terminal loop region
observed in F-spondin seemingly extends the C-termini
of the FS domain to at least V426 (Figure 2). We note
that exon 10 of human F-spondin genomic DNA
encodes the C-terminal region of the FS domain, from
G412 to E436. It is possible that the C-terminus of Fspondin FS domain extends much beyond the disulfide
bond formed by C415. However, we can’t exclude the
possibility that the C-terminal structured region (from
N416 to V426) results from molecular packing in the
crystal.
N-linked glycosylation, Ca2+- and SO42- -binding sites

There is one N-linked glycosylation site (N214) at the
end of the b1 strand in the FS domain (Figure 2A). The
common pentasaccharide core of the linked glycans is

program MultAlin[38] and ESPript[39]. In Drosophila melanogaster F-spondin (D. M-spondin), the large, likely unstructured, Ser, Gly, Thr and Alarich insertion (VQMQLQSQMQAGKSPSGGISSGTTSFNATAASTATPTGGSGGSGGSGGSGGTGTTTAE) between a3 and b2 is not shown in the alignment.

visible in the electron densities. Two branched mannose
residues were not built in the final model due to their
weak densities. Like other proteins that we have
expressed in Drosophila S2, the N-linked glycans are
not fully processed [5,24]. The post-translational modification in the FS domain is conserved only in F-spondins
while in mindins only zebrafish mindin-1 and -2 FS
domains are glycosylated, at different sites (Figure 4).
Associated with the short strands at the top of the FS
domain, there is a solvent-accessible Ca2+-binding site,
formed from D325 (from b5-b6 loop), D354 (from b7’
short strand) and D358 (right after b7’ short strand).
The site also contains three coordinating water molecules in an approximately octahedral coordination

geometry (Figure 2 and 3). All three aspartic acids are
from the two highly conserved and characteristic FS
domain “repeats”, P322SPDW and D354AGTD (in Fspondin) [17]. Both D325 and D354 interact with the
Ca2+ ion as bidentate ligands involving both carboxyl
groups with bond distances of 2.49 Å/2.53 Å and 2.38
Å/2.46 Å, respectively. Interestingly, D358 interacts with
the Ca 2+ ion with only its mainchain carbonyl group
(2.33 Å) though the residue is part of a highly conserved
motif. All three aspartic acids and three coordinating
waters (2.47 Å for all) are part of an extensive hydrogen
bond network. The geometry of the metal-binding site,
including bond distances, coordination [25] as well as
the similar B-factors of the Ca2+ ion (16.2 Å2) and its

surround protein atoms (~15.5 Å2), support the metal
ion assignment.
Three sulfate groups from the crystallization buffer
that included 0.2M lithium sulfate monohydrate have
also been identified in the structure (Figure 3). One of
them is inside a pocket near the bottom of the domain
(not shown in the figure). The other two sulfate groups,
labeled as SO4(1) and SO4(2) in Figure 3, are associated
with two consecutive arginines, R226 and R227, on one
side of the top of the FS domain. The SO4(1) occupies a
special position with 2-fold crystallographic symmetry,
and binds the residues R226 and R227, and the same
residues from an adjacent, symmetry-related FS
molecule.
Structural homologues

The primary sequence identity of the FS domains
between F-spondin (human, a.a.198-428) and mindin
(human, a.a.34-264) is 35.9%. A secondary-structure
matching (SSM) superposition [26] of two molecules
yields a core root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.14
Å with 200 residues from each aligned (Figure 5A). In
the alignment, there are eight gaps, all in loop regions
with the major difference (an insertion of six residues in

F-spondin) occurring before the b4-strand and creating
a protrusion from the edge of the b4/b1/b8/b7 sheet.
The protrusion is accompanied by the N-linked glycans
extended from the end of the neighboring b1-strand as
described earlier.
A Dali structural homology search (http://www2.ebi.ac.
uk/dali/) using the F-spondin FS domain found a large
number of fits (Z ≤ 5.8 and rmsd ≥ 3.3 Å), including the
N-terminal Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding/C2 domain of
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PDB code:1CJY) [27]. In the
structural alignments of the FS domain with these C2
domains, only the core of the FS domain (commonly
about 110-120 residues) can be superimposed, indicating
that the FS domain represents a derivative of a common
C2 domain (Figure 5B). Though helices are commonly
found within the linker between two strands in C2
domain structures, the two nearly anti-parallel helices
within the loop between the b2 and b3 strands and the
unusual long loop between the b7 and b8 strands found
in the FS domain are unique to FS domains only.

includes the FS domain. The unexpected identification
of a C2 domain homology with the FS domain and the
presence of Ca2+- and SO42--binding sites implies potential roles of this domain in the interaction of F-spondin
with membrane and/or membrane associated molecules.
The C2 domain is the second most abundant lipid
binding domain behind the pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain [28,29]. Though the C2 domain can fold individually with a highly conserved common b-sandwich
core, it seems to be a modular domain that is found in
a large number of multiple domain proteins involved in
signal transduction or membrane trafficking. Most of
the C2 domain-containing molecules that have been studied to date are either soluble proteins or membrane
proteins. The FS domain structures of mindin and Fspondin represent the first examples of structures from
ECM proteins that contain a C2-domain or rather a C2domain derivative. The individual C2 domains commonly participate in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding
in Ca2+-mediated cell processes.
In most cases, the membrane-binding and/or lipid
binding of C2 domains is dependent on the Ca2+-binding site(s), though the number of Ca2+ binding-sites and
their positions at the top of the domains are variable
[28]. Ca 2+ ions can (1) function as an electrostatic
switch for favorable ionic interaction with the anionic
membrane, (2) form a bridge between the C2 domain
and anionic phospholipids, or (3) induce conformational
changes that lead to protein-membrane interactions
[28]. The exact methods for the C2 domain interaction
with membranes, including lipid selectivity, may be
dependent on the number of Ca2+-binding sites and the
conformation of each Ca2+ -binding site. Additionally,
protein-membrane associations mediated by divalent
metals, especially Ca2+ ions, have been reported in many
other proteins, including vitamin-K-dependent proteins,
annexins and pentraxins [30].
The presence of a sulfate group from crystallization
buffer in a crystal structure could be an indicator of a
binding site of an anionic group of a potential ligand,
such as heparin (with sulfate group) and lipid (with
phosphate head group). The arginines, R226 and R227,
on one side of the top of the FS domain could contribute to a binding site for the phosphate head group of a
lipid. It is interesting that R226 is conserved between Fspondins and mindins while R227 in mindins is replaced
by a proline (Figure 4). Heparin-binding has been
demonstrated for F-spondin’s N-terminal reelin_N
domain [5], which is adjacent to the FS domain (Figure
1A). The potential for the two consecutive arginines
R226 and R227 of the FS domain to bind heparin in
synergy with the reelin_N domain remains to be
explored. The presence of two sulfate groups, especially
SO4(1) at a crystallographic special position, could be an

Page 7 of 9

artifact of molecular packing. The heparin-binding, or
more generally glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding,
implies another potential pathway for targeting the
membrane through the interaction with membraneassociated GAGs such as those from transmembrane
proteoglycans.

Conclusions
The structure of F-spondin FS domain, together with
mindin FS domain, represents the first examples of C2
domain-like structures in ECM proteins. Although the
two FS domains have similar overall structures, they
have evolved separately from their common ancestor.
The integrin-binding motif found in mindin is not conserved in the F-spondin FS domain. The F-spondin FS
domain is unique with a conserved N-glycosylation site
and three disulfide bonds, which may play critical roles
in protein folding and stability as well as defining
domain boundaries. The homology of its core structure
to a common Ca2+- and lipid-binding C2 domain suggests that the F-spondin FS domain may be responsible
for part of the membrane targeting of F-spondin in its
regulation of axon development. The structure of the Fspondin FS domain completes the structural studies of
the multiple domain ECM molecule and its properties
revealed in this study pave the way for further exploration into the functions of F-spondin.
Methods
Preparation of the Recombinant FS domain

A cDNA pool was prepared from a mixture of human
spleen, placenta and liver poly(A)+ RNA (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA) using a reverse transcription kit (Gibco-BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD). A recombinant version of the
human F-spondin FS domain (amino acids V191-K434)
was prepared by PCR using the cDNA pool as the template. The FS domain was prepared using the forward
primer fs102f (5’-GAT GAT CCC GGG GTG ACT
GAC AAA CCC ATC-3’) and the reverse primer fs104r
(5’-ATG ATG ACC GGT TTT CTC TTC TGG AGC
CAG-3’). The PCR products were sequenced and cloned
between the SmaI and the AgeI sites of the vector pMT/
BiP V5-HisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for expression
in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cell. The recombinant
proteins include the vector-derived sequence RSPWPG
at the N-terminal and the sequence TGHHHHHH at
the C-terminal.
The vector transfection and cells selection were performed following the protocol from Invitrogen, catalog
no. R690-07. The methods for FS domain expression
and purification were described previously [31]. The
protein was further purified by FPLC in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.8 with
sodium as the counter ion. The apparent molecular

Only two peaks, from the primary beam and Compton
scattering, respectively, were recorded (data not shown).
The F-spondin FS domain structure was determined
with molecular replacement method using the program
MolRep [33]. One monomer from the mindin FS
domain structure (PDB code:3D34) was used as a search
template. After sequence substitution and manual model
building using the program Coot [34], structural refinement was performed using the program Refmac [35]
(Table 1). The final model includes residues from T192
to D428, N-linked glycans (up to the first mannose moiety) attached to the residue N214, one Ca2+ ion, three
sulfate groups from crystallization buffer and 344 water
molecules. The quality of the structure was validated
with MolProbity [36] (Table 1).
The coordinates and structure factors of the human Fspondin FS domain have been deposited in the Protein
Data Bank with accession code 3Q13.

weight of the eluted FS domain was estimated to be 22.7
kDa based on the calibration of the column with known
proteins, indicating the domain exists as a monomer in
solution (Figure 1B).
Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection

The purified protein was concentrated to about 30 mg/
ml. The crystallization was carried out with sitting drop
vapor diffusion technique. Protein crystals grew from
the buffer containing 0.2 M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.1 M HEPES at pH 7.5.
The crystals had a hexagonal form with a dimension of
about 60 μm on edge. The crystals were then treated
with a cryoprotectant (10% glycerol in crystallization
buffer) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
One X-ray diffraction data set was collected from a
frozen crystal at 100K at the 19ID beamline of the
Structure Biology Center at the Advanced Photon
Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The data set was
processed using the program suite HKL3000 [32] (Table
1). An X-ray fluorescence spectrum of the crystal was
measured with the primary beam energy of 12.659 keV.
