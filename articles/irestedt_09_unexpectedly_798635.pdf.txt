Abstract
Background: The birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae) form one of the most prominent avian
examples of sexual selection and show a complex biogeographical distribution. The family has
accordingly been used as a case-study in several significant evolutionary and biogeographical
syntheses. As a robust phylogeny of the birds-of-paradise has been lacking, these hypotheses have
been tentative and difficult to assess. Here we present a well supported species phylogeny with
divergence time estimates of the birds-of-paradise. We use this to assess if the rates of the
evolution of sexually selected traits and speciation have been excessively high within the birds-ofparadise, as well as to re-interpret biogeographical patterns in the group.
Results: The phylogenetic results confirm some traditionally recognized relationships but also
suggest novel ones. Furthermore, we find that species pairs are geographically more closely linked
than previously assumed. The divergence time estimates suggest that speciation within the birdsof-paradise mainly took place during the Miocene and the Pliocene, and that several polygynous and
morphologically homogeneous genera are several million years old. Diversification rates further
suggest that the speciation rate within birds-of-paradise is comparable to that of the enitre core
Corvoidea.
Conclusion: The estimated ages of morphologically homogeneous and polygynous genera within
the birds-of-paradise suggest that there is no need to postulate a particularly rapid evolution of
sexually selected morphological traits. The calculated divergence rates further suggest that the
speciation rate in birds-of-paradise has not been excessively high. Thus the idea that sexual
selection could generate high speciation rates and rapid changes in sexual ornamentations is not
supported by our birds-of-paradise data. Potentially, hybridization and long generation times in
polygynous male birds-of-paradise have constrained morphological diversification and speciation,
but external ecological factors on New Guinea may also have allowed the birds-of-paradise to
develop and maintain magnificent male plumages. We further propose that the restricted but
geographically complex distributions of birds-of-paradise species may be a consequence of the
promiscuous breeding system.

Background
Birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae) are renowned for their
complex courtships and diverse male plumages with
highly elongated and elaborate feathers. Arguably, the
birds-of-paradise form one of the most extravagant clades
of all bird families in terms of beauty and display behaviour. The degree of sexual dimorphism found in the
majority of species of birds-of-paradise (cryptically coloured females while males have spectacular ornamented
plumages and elaborate courtship displays) is one of the
most prominent avian examples of sexual selection. The
birds-of-paradise also show complex biogeographical patterns, where most species and subspecies are locally and
disjunctly distributed, sometimes in seemingly uniform
and interconnected landscapes (summarized in [1]). Consequently, the family has been used as one of the earliest
case-studies in significant evolutionary and biogeographical syntheses (e.g., [2-4]). Despite the evolutionary interest in the family, no comprehensive robust phylogeny of
the birds-of-paradise exists.
Several incongruent phylogenetic hypotheses have been
proposed for the birds-of-paradise based on both morphology [5-8] and molecular distances [9-11]. The only
molecular phylogenetic study [12] lacks several genera
and is based only on a single mitochondrial marker.
Recent molecular studies have demonstrated that some
taxa, traditionally considered to belong to the birds-ofparadise, are more closely related to other passerine
clades. Thus, Macgregor's bird-of-paradise (Macgregoria
pulchra) is a giant honeyeater [13], while the cnemophiline birds-of-paradise form a distinct lineage well separated from the true birds-of-paradise clade [13-15]. The
lesser melampitta (Melampitta lugubris) and the silktail
(Lamprolia victoriae) have also been proposed to be related
to the birds-of-paradise [10,16,17], but are now confidently placed outside this clade [14,15,18].
The Fisherian runaway model of sexual selection [19,20]
suggests that sexual selection could generate a rapid and
continual change in sexual ornaments, as few males get
most of the mating and are free from constraints imposed
by parental behaviour. In lekking species, sexual selection
and dimorphism are expected to be even stronger (e.g.,
[3,21]. The power of sexual selection to drive changes in
mate recognition traits is also potentially a potent force in
speciation (e.g., [22-25]). However, some models suggest
that strong sexual selection may act against speciation
[26].
Here we present a robust phylogenetic hypothesis and
divergence time estimates for the birds-of-paradise (stricto
sensu), based on both nuclear and mitochondrial
sequence data. We use this i) to asses if the speciation rate
and the evolution of sexually selected traits have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/235

excessively high in the polygynous core birds-of-paradise,
and ii) to examine biogeographical patterns and analyze
the geographical differentiation in relation to sexually
selected traits.

Methods
Taxon sampling, amplification and sequencing
We examined the phylogenetic relationship among birdsof-paradise by analyzing DNA sequence data from the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the two nuclear
loci ornithine decarboxylase introns 6 to 7 (ODC), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase intron 11
(GAPDH). The taxon sampling includes all 40 species of
birds-of-paradise recognized by Monroe and Sibley [27],
omitting the genera Loboparadisea, Cnemophilus, Melampitta and Macgregoria, which have been shown to not be
part of the birds-of-paradise clade [13-15]. The taxon sampling also includes Corvus cornix and Monarcha melanopsis,
two taxa representing lineages that have been suggested to
be closely related to the birds-of-paradise [14]. Three
additional but more distantly related representatives of
core Corvoidea as well as representatives from other
major passerine lineages were also included. A representative from Psittacidae, the sister group to passerine birds,
was used to root the trees. See Table 1 for the taxon sampling and GenBank accession numbers.

For extractions, amplifications, and sequencing procedures from study skin samples we followed the procedures described in Irestedt et al. [28]. Several new primers
were also designed (Table 2).
Phylogenetic analyses and estimation of speciation rates
We used Bayesian inference (see e.g., [29]) to estimate
phylogenetic relationships. The models for nucleotide
substitution used in the analyses were selected for each
gene individually by applying the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, Akaike [30]) using the program MrModeltest
2.2 [31] in conjunction with PAUP* [32]. Due to a rather
low number of insertions in the non-coding nuclear loci
the sequences could easily be aligned by eye. All gaps were
treated as missing data in the analyses.

Posterior probabilities of trees and parameters in the substitution models were approximated with MCMC and
Metropolis coupling using the program MrBayes 3.1.1
[33]. Analyses were performed for the cytochrome b gene,
a concatenated data set of the nuclear loci (GAPDH and
ODC), and a concatenated data set of all genes. In the
analyses of the concatenated data sets the models selected
for the individual gene partitions were used. We used an
unconstrained, exponential branch length prior. All
chains were run for 25 million generations, with trees
sampled every 100 generations. The trees sampled during
the burn-in (i.e., before the chain had reached its apparent

target distribution) were discarded, and after checking for
convergence, final inference was made from the concatenated output from the two runs.
Sexual selection has been considered a driving force
behind speciation [22-25]. By comparing speciation rates
between clades with and without sexual selection it could
be possible to investigate if sexual selection promotes speciation (e.g., [34-36]). The temporal variation in diversification rates is reflected by the variation in branch lengths
in a chronogram and can be used to estimate the overall
speciation rates as well as relative contribution of extinction [37]. However, this requires taxonomically almost
complete chronograms which is still lacking for the core
Corvoidea. However, by using the methods described by
Magallon and Sanderson [38] it is possible to estimate the
diversification rate and the corresponding 95% confidence interval for the entire core Corvoidea, and compare
this with the diversification rate of the polygynous birdsof-paradise. As the confidence interval will depend on the
relative extinction rate (which is unknown) we calculated
confidence intervals for both a high ( = 0.90), and a zero
( = 0) relative extinction rate. By using previously published phylogenies and divergence time estimates [39-41]
it is possible to roughly estimate the divergence rates for
Dicruridae and Monarchidae, two bird families closely
related to the birds-of-paradise within the core Corvoidea
assemblage. As the available divergence time estimates for
these groups are based on other calibration points that
suggest slightly different ages on comparable nodes, or
only show relative age estimates, these estimates have
been rescaled to be consistent with our chronogram. The
rescaling was done by calculating the relative age between
the two families, respectively, and the Corvus node (a
node present in all trees) and multiply this age with our
age estimate of the corresponding split. We consequently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/235

used the method to calculate diversification rates for
crown groups [38].
Estimation of birds-of-paradise divergence times
We used a relaxed clock model implemented in Beast
1.4.7 [42-44] to estimate divergence times between phylogenetic lineages based on the concatenated dataset of all
genes. To calibrate the tree we used the geological split
between New Zealand and Antarctica, as it has been associated with the basal separation of the Acanthisitta-lineage
from all other passerines [45,46]. The dating of this split
has often been assumed to be around 85-82 Mya [47,48],
but more recently the timing of this split has been suggested to be more uncertain, 85-65 Mya [49,50]. In order
to account for this uncertainty we used a normal distributed tree prior with a median at 76 Mya and a standard
deviation of 8 (quintiles 2.5% = 60.3 Mya, 5% = 62.8 Mya,
95% = 89,2 Mya, 97.5% = 91.7 Mya). As for other priors,
we used all default settings, except for the Tree Prior category that was set to Yule Process and an uncorrelated lognormal distribution for the molecular clock model. We
used a GTR+ model and ran MCMC chains for 25 million generations.

Results
Variation in the molecular data set, model selection
For all taxa 841 bp of the cytochrome b gene was
sequenced. As we used partially overlapping primers the
region covers a 868 bp region (ending 125 bp from the 3'
end in the cytochrome b gene). Taking into account that
for some taxa a few short fragments are missing, the alignments of the non-coding intron regions are 387 bp for
GAPDH (the individual sequences ranged between 247269 bp), and 685 bp for ODC (ranging between 577-619
bp for all taxa, except Corvus that, due to a large deletion,
is only 429 bp). Some indels in more variable regions
were found to be autapomorphic, while most other indels

are congruent with the phylogenetic tree obtained from
the analysis of the combined data set. The only exceptions
are a 4 bp deletion shared between all Paradisaea and
Monarcha and a 1 bp insertion shared by the Parotia-Pteridophora clade and some outgroup taxa in the GAPDH
locus.
The prior selection of substitution models supported the
GTR+I+ model for cytochrome b, the HKY+  for
GAPDH, and GTR+ for ODC. After discarding the burnin phase the final inference was based on a total of 200
000-225 000 samples from the posterior for all conducted
Bayesian analyses. For the phylogenetic inference of the
concatenated data set of all genes, the mode of the posterior distribution of topologies is presented as a 50%
majority-rule consensus tree (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic relationships
The trees obtained from the analyses of cytochrome b and
the nuclear data sets receive less support than the tree
obtained from the analysis of the concatenated data set.
Nevertheless, several clades are recognized in all analyses,
and conflicts exclusively concern weakly supported nodes
(posterior probabilities < 0.95). Most deviant in relation
to the combined tree is the sister relationship between Epimachus and Drepanornis (pp = 0.83) suggested only by the
cytochrome b tree. In the cytochrome b tree Monarcha is
also nested between the Manucodia, Phonygammus and
Lycocorax clade and core birds-of-paradise (pp = 0.90).

Most nodes in our combined phylogeny receive strong
support (pp > 0.95) and are often recovered by both the
nuclear and the mitochondrial genes. Thus, we consider
our combined phylogeny a reliable estimate of the evolutionary relationships among the birds-of-paradise.
Five main clades are recognized in our phylogeny (A-E in
Figure 1). The first clade (A) consists of manucodes
(Manucodia and Phonygammus) and the paradise crow
(Lycocorax pyrrhopterus). This clade is supported as the sister group to the core birds-of-paradise (remaining genera). The king of Saxony bird-of-paradise (Pteridophora
alberti) and parotias (Parotia) form the second clade (B).
Within this clade P. carolae is highly divergent and warrants separate generic treatment.
The third clade (C) consists of the twelve-wired bird-ofparadise (Seleucidis melanoleuca), Drepanornis sicklebills,
the standardwing bird-of-paradise (Semioptera wallacii),
riflebirds (Ptiloris), and the superb bird-of-paradise
(Lophorina superba). However, support for more basal
nodes within this clade is low, and the affinity of the
twelve-wired bird-of-paradise, Drepanornis sicklebills, and
the standardwing bird-of-paradise should be regarded as
provisional. Although support values are low, New Guin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/235

ean Ptiloris and Lophorina form a clade separate from the
Australian Ptiloris. This apparent relationship is worth
investigating further as it suggests a significant phylogenetic break between Australia and New Guinea.
The fourth clade (D) includes sicklebills (Epimachus), paradigallas (Paradigalla) and astrapias (Astrapia). The fifth
clade (E), consists of Paradisaea birds-of-paradise, Wilson's bird-of-paradise (Diphyllodes respublica), magnificent
bird-of-paradise (Diphyllodes magnificus), and king birdof-paradise (Cicinnurus regius). Within this clade the genera Diphyllodes and Cicinnurus are sister lineages, while the
blue bird-of-paradise (Paradisaea rudolphi) is sister to
other Paradisaea birds-of-paradise.
Divergence time estimates and speciation rates
All nodes supported by posterior probabilities above 0.95
in the tree obtained from the Bayesian analyses of the concatenated data set of all genes (Figure 1) are recognized in
the chronogram. The chronogram and divergence time
estimates are shown in Figure 2. The split between the
Manucodia/Lycocorax clade and core birds-of-paradise
clade is estimated to have occurred around 24 million
years ago, while the basal divergence of the polygynous
core birds-of-paradise is suggested to be around 15 million years old. The age estimates further suggest that
generic separations occurred between 6 and14 million
years ago, while speciation within genera mostly occurred
between 0.5 and 10 million years ago.

The calculated diversification rates and the 95% confidence intervals based on the mean diversification rate for
the core Corvoidea at a relative extinction rates of  = 0
and  = 0.90 are shown in Table 3 (expressed as expected
number of species). The results suggest that the speciation
rates within the entire birds-of-paradise clade as well as
within the restricted polygynous core birds-of-paradise
fall within the 95% confidence intervals for the core Corvoidea at both low ( = 0) and high ( = 0.90) relative
extinction rates.

Discussion
Evolution of sexual dimorphism
Our divergence time estimates suggest that the birds-ofparadise originated approximately 24 million years ago,
which renders the family older than previously suggested
by DNA-DNA hybridization data [10] and allozyme data
[9,11]. Particularly noticeable is the old age (ca 15 My) of
the sexually dimorphic and polygynous core birds-of-paradise. Although the variation in male plumage ornamentations is astonishing within the core birds-of-paradise
(Figure 3), most of this variation is found between genera
that diverged around 10 million years ago. More interesting is that morphologically homogeneous genera seem to
be quite old. One of the most prominent examples is the

Absolute rate of diversification for the entire birds-of-paradise clade, core (polygynous) birds-of-paradise, some closely related families, and core
Corvoidea, estimated in absence of extinction ( = 0) and comparatively high ( = 0.90) relative extinction rate. The 95% confidence intervals at
relative extinction rates of  = 0 and  = 0.90 are expressed as expected number of species for each clade. The 95% confidence intervals have been
calculated as described by Magallon and Sanderson [Magallon and Sanderson 2001] and is based mean diversification rate for the core Corvoidea (at
a relative extinction rates of  = 0 and  = 0.90) and the age of the clades.

genus Paradisaea. In this genus all lekking species are morphologically very homogeneous although the age of the
genus is found to be more than 6 million years old (the
split between P. guilielmi and other lekking Paradisaea species). Similarly, the morphological variation is modest
within the genus Parotia, for which the exploded lekking
system is estimated to be around 10 million years old.
Other sexually dimorphic and polygynous genera such as
Ptiloris and Astrapia also show little morphological diversification between species. The calculated diversification
rates (Table 3) further indicate that the speciation rate in
core birds-of-paradise is not excessively high. In fact the
speciation rate seems to be more similar to the speciation
rate found for the sexually monomorphic drongos (Dicruridae) than to the speciation rate found for the sexually
dimorphic monarch flycatchers (Monarchidae).
Christidis and Schodde [51] postulated that the evolution
of spectacular variation in male plumages in birds-of-paradise could be explained by female sexual selection for
novel partners (but see [52,53]). This model was proposed to explain the apparent rapid radiation of the birdsof-paradise. However, in the present study we find no evidence that sexual selection has promoted a particularly
rapid morphological diversification [19,20] or an exceptionally high rate of speciation [22-25] in birds-of-paradise.
Among passerine birds there is probably no other family
with so many reported cases of interspecific and intergeneric hybrids in the wild as in the birds-of-paradise [1].
For some genera where several species tend to have interconnected distributions, such as Paradisaea, gene flow
through hybridization may have constrained speciation
and phenotypic diversification. However, in most genera
within core birds-of-paradise, species and subspecies are
geographically well separated (i.e. Astrapia and Parotia),
and modest speciation and phenotypic differentiation

rates are thus difficult to explain by hybridization.
Although little is known about the age when birds-of-paradise breed for the fist time, it is assumed that males of
polygynous species do not reproduce until they have
obtained full adult plumages, which happens several
years later than in females [1]. A longer generation time in
polygynous male birds-of-paradise, compared to other
passerine birds, may thus influence the inheritance rate of
phenotypic characters in polygynous species of birds-ofparadise. Ecological factors, such as abundant food
sources in New Guinea, may also explain that male birdsof-paradise have been able to develop and maintain promiscuous breeding, magnificent plumages and elaborate
courtship displays.
Birds-of-paradise are among the few bird groups that have
developed a social system based on promiscuous mating
and arenas or leks [54]. It is therefore notable that our
phylogeny suggests that the degree of lekking behaviour
(from large communal lekking to solitary display) varies
considerably within the polygynous core birds-of-paradise, showing no clear phylogenetic structure (Figure 1). It
is also notable that the strong sexual dimorphism within
core birds-of-paradise has been lost in the genus Paradigalla.
Sexual behaviour and dispersal ability
Groups closely related to the birds-of-paradise, such as
Monarchidae, Rhipiduridae and Dicruridae [41,55-57]
have all dispersed to other continents and remote oceanic
islands. The birds-of-paradise on the other hand have
only colonized islands within the New Guinea orogen,
except two species (Lycocorax pyrrhopterus and Semioptera
wallacii) inhabiting Halmahera and surrounding islands
of the North Moluccas. The present distributions can
largely be explained by vicariance, considering the fluctuating sea levels in the Late Miocene and Pliocene [58].
This raises the question if the development of the special

Page 8 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:235

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/235

However, molecular clock estimates (Figure 2) suggest
that it diverged from other birds-of-paradise in the late
Miocene at a time when these islands, which are of oceanic origin, drifted close by the Vogelkop peninsula
[59,60].
We propose that the main reason why the core birds-ofparadise, unlike other corvoid bird families, have only
diversified within New Guinea and islands in the immediate vicinity is linked with their promiscuous breeding system. It is likely that the costs not only involve handicaps
associated with ornamental plumes and intensive displaying, but also involve a strong attachment to display sites
[1]. Furthermore, the fact that males and females live separately, except during mating time, means that successful
long-distance dispersal and establishment of new breeding populations are less likely.
A similar sedentary life strategy, with limited dispersal
outside mainland areas (and islands which have been
connected with these areas) is evident in several other
families with elaborate plumages, such as Phasianidae
[61], Pipridae and the polygynous species within Cotingidae [62].

reproductive behaviour of birds-of-paradise may have
constrained the capacity to disperse.

Patterns of speciation and diversification
Within several lineages of birds-of-paradise (Astrapia, Ptiloris and Paradigalla) there are distinct allopatric clades
distributed in the east and the west of New Guinea, which
separated about 3 - 6 million years ago (Figure 2). Allopatric speciation also appears to be the major mode of diversification within Paradisaea, which is a mainland lowland
species complex that originated in the Pleistocene, while
island species (P. rubra and P. decora) are slightly older.
However, the divergences involving the mountain species
(P. guilielmi and the highly divergent P. rudolphi) are much
older. Within Ptiloris, the time separation of New Guinean
and Australian taxa corresponds to broad land connections in the upper Miocene and marine transgression in
the Pliocene [59].

In four genera of birds-of-paradise the sexes are morphologically similar: Manucodia, Phonygammus, Paradigalla
and Lycocorax. These species are monogamous and form
pair bonds, which is quite unlike the promiscuous behaviour of the rest of the family. This less "spectacular" life
strategy probably enabled these birds to have a higher dispersal capacity and could explain the present day occurrence of Manucodia and Phonygammus on several islands
off the New Guinea coast and on Australia's Cape York
Peninsula, and of Lycocorax on the North Moluccas. Paradigalla on the other hand is a genus restricted to the central
New Guinean mountain range, which renders it less likely
to disperse. The present day distribution of Semioptera wallacii in the North Moluccas is more difficult to explain.

Heads [63-65] has argued that present day distributions of
birds-of-paradise in New Guinea are difficult to explain
simply by Pleistocene refugia processes, and rather that
biogeographical patterns should be seen in light of historic terrane movements over a longer time span. As support for this hypothesis he used three birds-of-paradise
genera (Astrapia, Parotia, and Paradisaea) for which
assumed sister relationships suggest a strong biogeographical connection between the Vogelkop and the
Huon Peninsula in western and eastern New Guinea,
respectively. Our phylogeny does not provide support for
this biogeographical scenario. A sister relationship
between Parotia sefilata in the Vogelkop and Parotia wahnesi on the Huon Peninsula is only weakly supported (PP

= 0.59), and within the genus Astrapia our phylogeny
strongly suggests sister relationships between species that
occur in closely connected geographical areas (between
Huon Peninsula and the Central Highlands, and between
the Vogelkop and the Star Mountains). Within the genus
Paradisaea, P. guiliemi from the Huon Peninsula is sister to
all other Paradisaea species (except P. rudolphi, a morphologically rather divergent montane species) occupying
almost all lowland areas in New Guinea.
The two species of Drepanornis as well as the two species
of Epimachus separated about 10 and 7 million years ago,
respectively. While the two species of Drepanornis occupy
different elevations in low- and mid-montane forests, the
two species of Epimachus are altitudinal replacements in
mountain forests. Consequently, these two cases could
represent old cases of altitudinal speciation. Parotia lawesii
and Parotia helenae have similar patchy distributions as
Epimachus across the mountains of New Guinea, and may
represent a recent altitudinal speciation event. Examples
of presumed altitudinal speciation in New Guinea have
also been reported in Meliphagidae honeyeaters [66].

Conclusion
The phylogenetic results suggest that the birds-of-paradise
could be subdivided into five main clades (A-E in Figure
1). Some of these clades confirm traditionally recognized
relationships while others are novel hypotheses. The
divergence time estimates further suggest that birds-ofparadise constitute an older clade than previously suggested. It appears that diversification within several genera
of birds-of-paradise has been a continuous process
through the Tertiary and that younger divergences are geographically rather closely linked. In addition to allopatric
speciation, there appear to be some examples of altitudinal speciation. Particularly interesting is the observation
that sexually dimorphic polygynous genera are morphologically homogeneous although divergences between
species are suggested to be several million years old, and
that calculations of diversification rates indicate that the
speciation rate is not excessively high. Thus, sexual selection in birds-of-paradise appears not to have generated a
particularly rapid change in sexual ornamentations or a
markedly high speciation rate. Although the explanation
remains uncertain, a long generation time in polygynous
male birds-of-paradise and extensive hybridization may
have constrained morphological diversifications and speciation. External ecological factors, such as abundant food
sources in New Guinea, may also explain why male birds
of paradise have been able to develop and maintain promiscuous breeding systems, magnificent plumages and
elaborate courtship displays.
