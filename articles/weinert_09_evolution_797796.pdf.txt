Abstract
Background: Rickettsia are intracellular symbionts of eukaryotes that are best known for infecting
and causing serious diseases in humans and other mammals. All known vertebrate-associated
Rickettsia are vectored by arthropods as part of their life-cycle, and many other Rickettsia are found
exclusively in arthropods with no known secondary host. However, little is known about the
biology of these latter strains. Here, we have identified 20 new strains of Rickettsia from arthropods,
and constructed a multi-gene phylogeny of the entire genus which includes these new strains.
Results: We show that Rickettsia are primarily arthropod-associated bacteria, and identify several
novel groups within the genus. Rickettsia do not co-speciate with their hosts but host shifts most
often occur between related arthropods. Rickettsia have evolved adaptations including transmission
through vertebrates and killing males in some arthropod hosts. We uncovered one case of
horizontal gene transfer among Rickettsia, where a strain is a chimera from two distantly related
groups, but multi-gene analysis indicates that different parts of the genome tend to share the same
phylogeny.
Conclusion: Approximately 150 million years ago, Rickettsia split into two main clades, one of
which primarily infects arthropods, and the other infects a diverse range of protists, other
eukaryotes and arthropods. There was then a rapid radiation about 50 million years ago, which
coincided with the evolution of life history adaptations in a few branches of the phylogeny. Even
though Rickettsia are thought to be primarily transmitted vertically, host associations are short lived
with frequent switching to new host lineages. Recombination throughout the genus is generally
uncommon, although there is evidence of horizontal gene transfer. A better understanding of the
evolution of Rickettsia will help in the future to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenicity,
transmission and virulence.

Background
Rickettsia bacteria are intracellular symbionts of eukaryotes. The genus is classified in the family Rickettsiaceae
within the alpha-proteobacteria, and is closely related to

the genera Erlichia and Wolbachia [1,2]. Rickettsia are most
noted for causing human diseases, including Rocky
Mountain spotted fever and epidemic typhus, which has
been a major source of mortality at times in human hisPage 1 of 15

tory [3]. However, all known vertebrate-associated Rickettsia are vectored by arthropods as part of their life-cycle,
and many other Rickettsia are found exclusively in arthropods with no known secondary host (for convenience, we
will refer to the former as 'vertebrate Rickettsia' and the latter as 'arthropod Rickettsia'). In recent years, arthropod
Rickettsia have been discovered in a diverse range of hosts,
suggesting that they are more common than had been suspected [4-16]. Nevertheless, research effort has tended to
concentrate on the medically important vertebrate Rickettsia, or on the more common arthropod endosymbionts,
such as Wolbachia and Cardinium, and so we know little
about the biology of arthropod Rickettsia. Even less is
known about the closely related bacteria that have been
recently discovered in organisms such as leeches and protists, and in metagenomic studies sequencing all DNA in
an environmental sample [17-25]. This neglect is unfortunate, because comparing the vertebrate pathogens with
related species can help to elucidate the mechanisms of
pathogenicity, transmission and virulence [26,27]. However, this requires a robust phylogeny for the genus.
Historically, Rickettsia were classified into three major
groups based on serological characteristics, namely the
'typhus group', 'spotted fever group' and 'scrub typhus
group', although subsequent DNA sequencing led to the
latter being reassigned to the related genus Orientia [28].
The relationship of species within the remaining two
groups of Rickettsia has been the subject of intensive study
over the last decade as progressively more informative
genes have been sequenced [29-32] culminating in a
multi-genic approach [33]. As a result it has been suggested that the spotted fever group consists of two sister
clades, one of which is now designated 'transitional' [34]
(although see [35]). A fourth so-called 'ancestral' clade,
including Rickettsia bellii and Rickettsia canadensis, is
thought to be basal to the other groups and is largely nonpathogenic to vertebrates. However, the position of R.
canadensis remains uncertain [33].
While many studies have helped to clarify the relationships between the vertebrate Rickettsia, only one recent
study has explored the relationship of the well classified
groups to the newly discovered arthropod Rickettsia [36].
The authors found that most arthropod Rickettsia are basal
to the vertebrate Rickettsia and that the Rickettsia associated with leeches, protists and freshwater environments
fell into two phylogenetic groups, distinct from the
arthropod and vertebrate groups. The only known exceptions are a small number of arthropod Rickettsia that fell
within the group otherwise infecting leeches [12,36,37].
However, Perlman et al. [36] were only able to provide little statistically significant support for relationships among
the arthropod Rickettsia. This is almost certainly because
the study relied on partial sequences of 16S rDNA, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/6

is extremely slowly evolving, and so lacking in phylogenetic resolution. Improving this situation is challenging
because amplifying other genes in basal strains has proven
problematic, perhaps because the genes in question may
either be missing or too divergent for PCR amplification
using existing primers. Also, resolving some deep nodes in
the Rickettsia species tree continues to be a problem. The
reasons for this are unclear but could be exacerbated by
long-branch attraction. One of the best ways to minimise
this effect is to sample for more taxa and add them to the
tree in the hope of breaking up (thereby shortening) the
long branches.
Here, to explore the diversity of arthropod Rickettsia, we
screened 4454 arthropods to uncover new Rickettsia
strains and sequenced four genes from five known and 20
new bacterial strains. We use the recently published Orientia tsutsugamushi genome [38] to design PCR primers
allowing amplification of rapidly evolving genes from
strains that lie between the genera Rickettsia and Orientia.
To include other hosts, we also searched published
metagenomic databases for Rickettsia sequences. With
these data, we have been able to produce the first wellresolved phylogeny of the entire genus Rickettsia, showing
how the vertebrate Rickettsia relate to the other taxa. Our
phylogeny has allowed us to identify and name additional
novel groups. Furthermore, we were able to compare host
associations among these groups, identify major life history transitions, and investigate the extent of recombination within the genus.

Results
Strains identified and genes sequenced
Our screens identified 20 novel strains of arthropod Rickettsia from six orders of insects, and these are listed in
Table 1. These strains were combined with five previously
described arthropod Rickettsia (listed at the bottom of
Table 1) to give 25 strains in total. We successfully
sequenced all four of our chosen genes from 18 of these
strains, and one or more genes from the remaining seven.
Rickettsia phylogeny
To obtain a phylogeny of the genus Rickettsia, we combined a concatenated alignment of the four genes we
sequenced, with data from other Rickettsia strains available from Genbank (accession number available in Additional file 1, Accession numbers of genes used in the
phylogenetic analysis). For most of the previously
described arthropod Rickettsia, only 16S rDNA sequence is
available, and so we allowed for missing data in the alignment where a gene had not been sequenced. Missing data
should not decrease phylogenetic resolution for taxa with
complete data, and is likely to be a problem for other taxa
only when the number of characters is very low [39].

Figure 1a shows that our concatenated alignment with
missing data gave a well-resolved tree with strong support
for most nodes. Nevertheless, it is important to determine
whether there are conflicting signals between the individual genes. Therefore, we used SH tests to compare our concatenated topology to the maximum likelihood trees
inferred from each of the four genes (Table 2). Only the
16S gene tree topology was marginally significantly different (although this is no longer significant when controlling for multiple tests by Bonferroni correcting the pvalues).

Comparison of the tree topologies obtained from the four genes
against the topology of the concatenated dataset using four SH tests.
Each dataset was forced to adopt the topology from the concatenated
dataset and the log likelihood of this tree was compared with the log
likelihood of the unconstrained tree. The taxa used in this analysis are
shown in Figure 1b.

It is also important to investigate the influence of missing
data on the phylogeny. Therefore, we constructed a second tree that included only taxa with complete sequences
for the three genes atpA, coxA and gltA (excluding 16S due
to its marginally significant SH test). This 'complete data'
tree is shown in Figure 1b. Overall, the topologies of the
two trees are very similar (Figure 1a and 1b), but most
nodes had higher support in the tree with complete
sequences. In particular, there is strong bootstrap support
for the group largely composed of ladybird symbionts in
the complete data tree (Figure 1b) but not on the missing
data tree (Figure 1a). An exception is the placement of R.
canadensis, which is uncertain in the complete data tree
but is well supported on the missing data tree (probably
because the missing data tree includes two closely related
taxa; Figure 1a). The composition of the transitional
group and the placement of Rickettsia prowazekii also differ
in the two trees. Rickettsia within the typhus group (R.
prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi) are striking in that they
reside on longer branches than other Rickettsia in the trees.
This is indicative of rate heterogeneity, which can cause a
long-branch attraction artefact where the taxa will appear
in an incorrect place. In the missing data tree the transitional group is monophyletic, while in the complete data
tree R. prowazekii groups with Rickettsia akari (Figure 1a
and 1b). However, constraining R. akari and the transi-

tional group to be monophyletic in the complete data tree
only causes a marginally significant drop in the likelihood
(SH test; lnL = 20.003 p = 0.066).
Together, these phylogenetic analyses reveal five distinct
and well-supported major clades of Rickettsia (Figure 1),
one (designated the hydra group) containing protist-associated Rickettsia and a number with unknown host associations from sequences amplified from environmental
samples, a second clade (torix) containing Rickettsia from
amoeba, leeches and arthropods, a third (rhizobius) contains three beetle Rickettsia, a fourth (melloidae) containing a single beetle Rickettsia, a fifth (bellii) containing 11

strains of arthropod Rickettsia and a sixth clade of diverse
bacteria containing both arthropod and vertebrate Rickettsia. This final clade can be further subdivided into the following groups: onychiurus, adalia, canadensis, spotted
fever group, typhus group and transitional group,
although bootstrap support for some of these groupings is
less strong (all groups are also summarized in Figure 2).
Host shifts
By mapping host species onto our phylogeny, we are able
to make inferences about patterns of host-switching in the
genus. It is clear from Figure 1 that Rickettsia bacteria have
an extremely diverse host range, occurring in arthropods,

Relationships and approximate dates of divergence of the major clades within the order Rickettsiales

Relationships and approximate dates of divergence of the major clades within the order Rickettsiales. The 16S

vertebrates, plants, amoebas, ciliates, annelids and hydrozoa, and that there have been numerous shifts between
these hosts. The earliest shift splits the genus into two
major divisions: the hydra and torix groups and all other
arthropod Rickettsia. As mentioned, the hydra group are
symbionts of protists and undetermined hosts. Although
one member of this group was found in the marine ciliate
Diophrys from brackish water [20], and another from a
deep sea octocoral, all others are from freshwater environments or damp terrestrial environments. In general it
appears that marine Rickettsia are rare. Indeed, from over
13 billion open reading frames compiled from marine
metagenomic datasets [40] we detected no homologues of
greater than 91% identity to the 16S gene of hydra group
Rickettsia. The next split in the tree separates all the

remaining Rickettsia from the torix group (Figure 1) which
contains symbionts of leeches (phylum Annelida), an
amoeba [36] and arthropods (a sandfly, a cranefly, a biting midge and a booklouse). In the torix group, as with
the hydra group, the vast majority of the hosts are aquatic
at some stage in their life cycle (the sole exception being
the booklouse).
The remainder of the arthropod Rickettsia, including all
strains sequenced in the present study, form a monophyletic group (Figure 1). Parsimony suggests that the
ancestral state of this clade is to infect arthropods, with
one or more lineages subsequently evolving to also infect
vertebrates. In addition, there have been multiple transitions between blood feeding and non blood feeding

insects. Perlman et al. [36] demonstrated that forcing R.
bellii to group with other blood feeders gives a significantly worse tree. SH tests of our phylogeny showed that
forcing R. canadensis and Rickettsia felis to group with other
blood feeders similarly gives a significantly worse fit (SH
tests on all groups: p < 0.001).
Our results therefore show clearly that there have been
numerous host shifts, sometimes between taxonomically
distant hosts. However, it is equally clear that related Rickettsia tend to share related hosts. Multiple different strains
were detected within ladybird beetles, ticks, lice, parasitic
wasps and bee-flies, and in all cases, two or more of these
strains cluster together. Nevertheless, this pattern does not
seem to be explained by ancestral infection followed by
co-speciation of parasite and host. From Figure 1a, the
three different strains of Rickettsia found in Adalia bipunctata do not appear to be monophyletic as one of the A.
bipunctata strains groups with Adalia decempunctata with
high posterior support. Unfortunately only four parasitoid individuals from the oak gall wasp screen were
infected, not allowing us to test the influence of host relatedness, host interaction frequency and geographic isolation on frequency of horizontal transfer events.
In addition to clustering according to host type, Figure 1
also demonstrates phylogenetic clustering by ecology
(although it is often difficult to separate these effects). For
example, the two major groups of vertebrate Rickettsia, the
spotted fever or typhus groups, consist solely of vertebrate
Rickettsia, containing no arthropod Rickettsia. However,
the transitional group differs from this pattern containing
both vertebrate Rickettsia and Rickettsia infecting nonblood feeding arthropods (Figure 1). A second ecological
adaptation to increase transmission is to skew the sex ratio
of the host towards females, which are the sex that most
efficiently transmits the infection to offspring for vertically transmitted Rickettsia. Some of these Rickettsia are
known or suspected to kill male hosts early in their development, and there appears to be two separate origins of
this adaptation on the tree (once within a buprestid beetle
in the bellii group and once within ladybirds in the adalia
group). There are 11 strains of Rickettsia that infect ladybird beetles, and nine of these cluster in a single monophyletic group. The ones that cluster elsewhere are
probably not male-killers (male ladybird beetles are also
infected at high prevalence [6]). A third possible source of
ecological clustering relates to herbivorous hosts. Such
clustering may reflect ecology in two possible ways.
Firstly, many symbionts are known to supplement their
hosts with amino acids that are rare in phloem sap
(although a mutualistic role for Rickettsia has never been
demonstrated). Secondly, Rickettsia may be transmitted
horizontally through plants (one case is already known).
It has previously been asserted that the bellii group consists mainly of herbivorous arthropod symbionts [36].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/6

Four Rickettsia in this group are indeed known to infect
sap sucking arthropods (a whitefly, a leaf hopper, an
aphid and a red spider mite), and three of these group separately from the other members of the bellii group (Figure
1). However, we have uncovered a large number of predatory insect hosts in this group, and sap sucking insects in
other groups (a spittlebug symbiont is in the transitional
group). Therefore, the view that members of the bellii
group are mainly associated with herbivorous arthropods
is not supported by these new data. However, it is possible
that the DNA signal could have come from the guts of
these insects, as abdomens were sometimes extracted
where there was not enough ovary tissue (although the
signal would not be expected to be strong).
Recombination
Recombination events complicate the inference of species
trees, and so it is important to investigate the extent of
recombination in the Rickettsia genus. We found one clear
instance of recent recombination between different Rickettsia groups (this taxon was excluded from the analyses
above). In the phylogenetic trees of the four individual
genes (Additional file 2, Phylogenetic trees of each of the
individual genes used in the study), the symbiont of the
ladybird Coccidula rufa (sC. rufa) appears in the transitional group on the 16S and gltA trees, and in the bellii
group on the atpA and coxA trees. An alignment of the polymorphic sites and a hybridisation network indicates that
sC. rufa is a chimera of sequences from these two groups
(Figure 3). To verify that the recombination pattern for sC.
rufa was not the result of contamination, this result was
confirmed by sequencing three strains from different individuals of C. rufa. This appears to be the only case of
recombination between the four genes because when sC.
rufa is excluded from analyses, there is little evidence of
topological differences between the datasets (see SH tests
above).

We did, however, detect some evidence of recombination
events within two of the four genes. The maximum χ2 test
and phi test identified multiple recombination breakpoints in the gltA and coxA genes. In coxA, the breakpoint
pattern indicted that there had been some recombination
between an ancestor of the adalia group and of the rhizobius group (maximum χ2 test χ2 = 42.79 p < 0.001; phi test
p < 0.001). In gltA, there was evidence of recombination
between R. akari of the transitional group and the adalia
group (maximum χ2 test χ2 = 46.78 p < 0.001; phi test p =
0.021). In contrast, no recombination was detected
within the 16S and atpA genes (maximum χ2 test χ2 = 8.92
p = 0.783; phi test p = 0.960; maximum χ2 test χ2 = 12.13
p = 0.57; phi test p = 0.759 (respectively)).
Split networks were constructed for each of the four genes
to identify possible sources of conflicting signal and
recombination in the data (Additional file 3, Split netPage 6 of 15

all cases, one of these trees corresponded to that shown in
Figure 1, suggesting that this tree accurately reflects the
evolutionary history of most of the genome. The discrepancies were as follows. The atpA split network showed
additional support for a tree where R. prowazekii is basal to
the other vertebrate groups. This pattern is consistent with
a tree based on protein alignments of the ten Rickettsia
genomes [41]. The coxA split network supported a closer
relationship between Rickettsia chrysomeloides symbiont
and the adalia group, which is consistent with the recombination pattern for this gene. The gltA split network also
supported this same relationship although this was not
reflected in the recombination breakpoint pattern.

Discussion
We have identified a large number of new strains of Rickettsia, including several new groups, and shown that
arthropod Rickettsia are both common and diverse. We
have also constructed the largest and most robust phylogenetic analysis of the genus to date. Importantly, we used
a multiple locus approach, as using single genes to build
species phylogenies can seriously confound the true relationship between strains, especially with loci that are
prone to recombination [42].
The evolutionary history of Rickettsia
It is useful to view our results in the context of the evolution of the whole order Rickettsiales. To do this, we have
used a molecular clock to date the divergence of different
groups, and this is shown in Figure 2. The common ancestor was presumably free-living, as the earliest diverging
genus of the order is Pelagibacter. Pelagibacter species
account for 26% of the bacterial rDNA sequences from sea
water [43] and have the smallest genomes of free-living
bacteria. About 525–775 million years ago there was a
transition to living within cells, followed by a split into
endosymbionts of protists (Holospora) [44,45] and a clade
that primarily infects arthropods. Holospora species infect
the nuclei of paramecium and are generally considered
pathogenic to their hosts; for example, Holospora undulata
can sterilise their hosts, reduce the rate of asexual division
and increase host mortality [46]. The most parsimonious
interpretation of the tree, therefore, is that the transition
to infecting arthropods occurred approximately 425–525
million years ago in this lineage (Figure 2), which can be
compared to the first appearance of most metazoan phyla
in the Cambrian explosion (approximately 540 million
years ago).

All other genera in the order Rickettsiales are associated
with arthropods although many have other diverse hosts.
The genus Midichloria has only been found in Ixodidae
ticks, and resides inside mitochondria. Bacteria in the
genus Neorickettsia are primarily associated with
helminths, where they can be transmitted to vertebrates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/6

[47]. Wolbachia have been described in only arthropods
and nematodes, and most are thought to be vertically
transmitted (reviewed in [48]). Ehrlichia and Anaplasma
are horizontally transmitted in arthropods and vertebrates
[49,50] and Orientia are vertically transmitted in mites
and can be horizontally transferred to humans [51,52].
The genus Rickettsia is approximately 150 million years
old (Figure 2). Parsimony would suggest that the common ancestor of Rickettsia infected arthropods, and that
species in the hydra and torix groups then switched to
infect other eukaryotes such as protists, leeches and
numerous unidentified hosts (many of which may be protists) (Figures 1 and 3). However, care should be taken
with this interpretation, as symbionts of arthropods are
more thoroughly sampled than those of other animals. In
addition, two patterns call into question the interpretation that the ancestral state was arthropod infection. First,
the genome sequence of R. bellii includes many genes that
are more related to other amoeba symbionts than to other
Rickettsia [53]. This is compatible with an ancestor of R.
bellii infecting amoebas and exchanging genes with other
amoebal symbionts. Second, of the arthropod hosts
within the torix group (three Diptera and a booklouse),
all of the Dipteran hosts have larval stages that feed on
aquatic microbiota, with the other hosts within the group
also being aquatic. Although host switching could occur
in either direction, transmission from protist to arthropod
is more intuitive given that the related genus Neorickettsia
is transmitted between hosts through ingestion [47]. Further sampling of other eukaryotic hosts may resolve the
question of the ancestral state.
Regardless of this, we have shown that the remaining
clade of Rickettsia (i.e. those not in the hydra or torix
groups) all have associations with arthropods; either as
the only known host or in conjunction with a vertebrate
or plant host (Figure 1). The rhizobius and meloidae
groups, which all infect beetles, diverged from the other
taxa early in the evolution of this clade. There was then a
rapid radiation about 50 million years ago that led to
most of the strains we know of. This includes the bellii
group, which is probably the largest group of arthropod
Rickettsia as it contains all but three strains from the
worldwide sample. This sample includes both a diverse
array of arthropods (it rarely includes the same host genus
twice), and it will tend to pick up high prevalence infections (only a single specimen of each host species was
tested).
Our results show clearly that switching between arthropod hosts has been a common feature of Rickettsia evolution. Within the genus, closely related bacteria sometimes
infect different host phyla and classes (Figure 1), but the
genus arose long after the major arthropod orders

Page 8 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:6

diverged [54] (Figure 2). However, the host phylogeny is
not entirely unrelated to the bacterial phylogeny, and
there are many cases of related Rickettsia strains infecting
related hosts. In the case of many mutualistic symbionts,
the bacterial phylogeny precisely mirrors the host phylogeny, indicating that the bacteria and host have co-speciated [55]. However, this is not the case in the Rickettsia.
Even in the adalia group, where a group of related bacteria
all infect related hosts, the host and bacterial phylogenies
are different. Therefore, Rickettsia symbioses are shortlived on an evolutionary scale, which is consistent with
most of these infections being parasitic.
Our analysis has also allowed us to reconstruct the
changes in the ecology of the genus. Rickettsia are almost
entirely restricted to terrestrial and freshwater habitats
(Figure 1). Within the genus, there have been three major
transitions in life history: becoming sex ratio distorters,
arthropod vectored vertebrate pathogens and, in one case,
an arthropod vectored plant pathogen. Based on current
data, infecting plants and parthenogenesis induction in
the arthropod host has arisen only once, and male-killing
twice. Until the effect of R. bellii on vertebrates in the field
has been properly defined, we cannot say for sure how
many times vertebrate pathogenesis has evolved.
Recombination
The recent discovery of plasmids in the genus Rickettsia
opens up the possibility that horizontal gene transfer may
be common between strains [56-59]. Furthermore, there
have been reports of recombination between Rickettsia
strains [60,61]. This has important implications for the
evolution of Rickettsia, as genes can sweep through different genetic backgrounds of bacterial strains, thereby
potentially increasing the spread of genes altering bacterial pathogenicity. Recombination can also complicate
the inference of relationships between strains, as recombination violates the assumption that a strain has one evolutionary history.

It is clear from our data that these different genes have
very similar phylogenetic histories and recombination
must therefore be infrequent (although it is possible that
the exchange of plasmids may be common). However, we
detected one clear-cut case of recombination between different groups of Rickettsia. In the symbiont of the ladybird
beetle C. rufa (Figure 3) the sequences of atpA and coxA
place (s)C. rufa within the bellii group, whereas gltA and
16S place it within the transitional group (Additional file
2, Phylogenetic trees of each of the individual genes used
in the study). In the R. felis genome (from the transitional
group), the gene sequences of atpA and coxA are approximately 670 kb apart. If this represents one recombination
event and the genes are syntenic with the R. felis genome,
it will have included approximately 45% of the genome.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/6

The biggest known recombination event in Rickettsia,
which occurred in Rickettsia massiliae, is a 54 kb segment
containing many genes that facilitate conjugal DNA transfer. Intriguingly, although R. massiliae is in the spotted
fever group, this region of DNA was also thought to originate from the bellii group [58]. As well as this, Gillespie
et al. [34] found that many of the genes on the R. felis plasmid have a closer relationship to the bellii group. This evidence suggests that conjugation with the bellii group
Rickettsia may have an important role in the evolution of
the groups containing vertebrate pathogens.
We also detected recombination within the coxA and gltA
genes. This is particularly surprising given that the individual gene topologies did not seem to conflict in any way
(Table 2). This can only be explained if the recombination
event is ancient, and indeed the breakpoint patterns
affected all members in particular groups, suggesting that
the events pre-dated the divergence of the different
groups. Even though recombination machinery has been
detected in Rickettsia genomes [62], this is the first evidence that housekeeping genes recombine, and could
have implications for the inference of relationships, especially since housekeeping genes (in particular gltA in Rickettsia) are often used to build phylogenies. Therefore
recombination should be investigated more fully, especially when using single genes to build phylogenies. These
ancient recombination events involve the adalia group
and the rhizobius group, as well as the transitional group.
This would seem to indicate that recombination is not
unique to the bellii and vertebrate groups, and may be
widespread throughout all arthropod Rickettsia and possibly the other basal groups. However, the recombination
signal is different from the above cases, as it is intragenic
and over a small area.
Transmission and population dynamics
It is clear from our data that Rickettsia are common and
diverse bacteria. However, the basic biology of most of
these strains is entirely unknown and it is therefore
unclear how these have spread through populations. As
Rickettsia are primarily intracellular, they cannot survive
for long in the external environment (but see [63] for cellfree persistence of related Wolbachia). For this reason, they
are most readily maintained either by vertical transmission (mother to offspring) in their arthropod hosts or, in
the case of blood-sucking arthropods, by horizontal transmission through an infected vertebrate (one case is also
known of transmission through a plant [10]). Because
infectious transmission between arthropod hosts is
thought to be rare, the general view is that exclusively
arthropod Rickettsia are maintained within a host species
primarily by transovarial transmission, and therefore
must enhance the fitness of infected females [64]. Some
Rickettsia raise infected female fitness in an indirect way by

Page 9 of 15

BMC Biology 2009, 7:6

manipulating host reproduction towards infected daughters at the expense of sons, either by killing male offspring
as embryos (male-killing) or by inducing parthenogenesis
[13,65]. The closely related bacterium O. tsutsugamushi
also causes a female biased sex ratio in its mite host [66].
Theoretically, arthropod Rickettsia could also be maintained by directly providing a fitness benefit to infected
females as shown for other bacterial groups [67-71], eg by
providing essential nutrients or protection from other
infective agents. Although, Rickettsia are required for egg
production in the booklouse Liposcelis bostrychophila, and
are therefore obligatory, in most cases where the arthropod relationship has been studied in depth, Rickettsia are
pathogenic [8,72-74] or have no observable effect [75,76],
making a mutualistic role for Rickettsia in those hosts
unlikely.
For those Rickettsia that are vertebrate pathogens but vectored by arthropods, the effects of the bacteria on their
arthropod hosts are generally poorly understood
[72].Rickettsia prowazekii is clearly pathogenic to infected
lice, and transmission through humans is essential to the
maintenance of the bacteria in arthropod populations. In
every other case, human infections are accidental, but
transmission through other vertebrates may allow the bacteria to persist in populations. Many of the bacteria that
can infect vertebrates are also transmitted vertically by the
arthropod host [76]. In these cases, even very occasional
horizontal transmission through the vertebrate host can
enhance the maintenance of bacteria in arthropod populations.
Our data also have implications for transmission. We
have shown that R. felis (transitional group),R. canadensis
(canadensis group) and R. bellii (bellii group) are more
closely related to Rickettsia in non-blood feeding hosts
than to those found in other blood feeding hosts. Therefore, are these strains even transmitted horizontally? As far
as we are aware, even in cases where the bacteria can infect
vertebrates (as is the case with R. felis), there has been no
recorded instance of transmission back to arthropods (i.e.
ectoparasites can not pick up the infection from vertebrates). Therefore, while there are multiple origins of
infecting blood-feeding arthropods, the ability to be transmitted from vertebrates back into the arthropod host may
have arisen once only, and subsequently been lost in the
transitional group after the divergence of R. akari and Rickettsia australis.
We still do not have a complete understanding of how
Rickettsia are maintained within host populations or how
they move horizontally between host species. A better
understanding of these dynamic processes can be
achieved by detailed studies of representatives from the
different groups described here.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/6

Conclusion
We have identified 20 new arthropod Rickettsia and
described the major transitions and life-history strategies
throughout the phylogeny. This raises many questions
about how these bacteria are maintained and spread
throughout populations of arthropods and vertebrates.
Rickettsia are known to distort the sex ratio of their hosts
by male-killing and inducing parthenogenesis, and are
also horizontally transmitted through vertebrates and
plants. However, these phenotypes are probably not manifest in the majority of strains discovered and so there may
be other ways in which Rickettsia are maintained in host
populations. For example, there seem to be intriguing
links to host oogenesis in some strains and a possible case
of a beneficial effect in the torix group [77]. Exploring the
biology of these new strains is essential if we are to learn
more about the genus.

Methods
Bacterial strains
We obtained most of the Rickettsia strains we sequenced
from three PCR screens of insects collected in the wild
(Table 1). These used primers that amplify the 16S rDNA
of Rickettsia [15]. The first screen tested 2149 ladybirds
from 21 different species collected from the UK, Germany,
Spain and New Zealand for the presence of Rickettsia [6].
We sequenced a Rickettsia from a single individual from
each of the eight species shown to be infected. The second
screen tested 1458 individuals of Hymenoptera associated
with galls induced by oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera:
Cynipidae, Cynipini; [78]), comprising nine species of
oak gall wasp, 26 species of associated chalcid parasitoid,
and ten species of oak gall wasp inquiline (Hymenoptera:
Cynipidae, Synergini) (A Aebi and G Stone, unpublished
data). We sequenced a Rickettsia from single individuals
from three of the four species that were infected. The third
study screened 847 individuals, each of which was a different species of arthropod from the classes Arachnida,
Entognatha, Malacostraca and Insecta. The individuals
from Arachinida comprised six of the order Araneae and
one Holothyrida. The five Entognatha were all Collembola and the individual from Malacostraca was from the
order Isopoda. The individuals from the Insecta comprised 240 of the order Hymenoptera, 218 Diptera, 206
Coleoptera, 86 Hemiptera, 28 Lepidoptera, nine Orthoptera, nine Thysanoptera, eight Odonata, eight Heteroptera, five Homoptera, five Blattodea, four Neuroptera,
three Dermaptera, and one individual each of Mantodea,
Pscoptera, Siphonaptera, Strepsiptera, and Trichoptera (L
Weinert and J Werren, unpublished data). The insects
were collected from worldwide locations. All nine Rickettsia isolates from this screen were sequenced. More
detailed information on infected and uninfected species
from unpublished data can be found in the supplementary information (Additional file 4, The distribution of

Rickettsia among arthropods). We also included a Rickettsia from the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum [8], a male-killing Rickettsia from the buprestid beetle Brachys tessellatus
[7] and three Rickettsia strains from the ladybird beetle A.
bipunctata, each of which has been shown to be genetically
distinct [73,79].
PCR and sequencing
To obtain estimates of phylogeny from different portions
of the genome, we sequenced four different genes, which
are at least 200 kbps apart in the R. bellii genome. Of the
genes used in a previous study to produce a multi-gene
vertebrate Rickettsia phylogeny [33], we sequenced 16S
rDNA and atpA, which are the only ones that have homologues conserved enough to produce alignments in O.
tsutsugamushi. We also targeted the coxA gene as it is used
in Wolbachia multilocus strain type analysis [80] and is
found in Orientia and all Rickettsia genomes except for R.
typhi. We also used the gltA gene, which is commonly
sequenced from Rickettsia strains [30] and, although it is
absent from the O. tsutsugamushi genome, it is conserved
throughout all other Rickettsiales [38]. This provides four
genes for our multi-gene analysis. The primers used to
amplify the four different genes are given in Table 3[81].

The PCR products were incubated at 37°C for 40 minutes
with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Southampton, UK) to digest unincorporated dNTPs and exonuclease
I (NEB, Hertfordshire, UK) to digest the PCR primers.
They were then sequenced using Big Dye technology
(Applied Biosystems, CA) in both directions using the
PCR primers and run on a 3730 capillary sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, CA).
Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were edited and assembled using
Sequencher 4.1 (GeneCodes, MI), and aligned using the
ClustalW application within Bioedit v.7.0.1. All sequences
within alignments were checked to ensure they encoded

functional proteins (with the exception of the 16S gene).
The model of sequence evolution used for each gene was
selected by including only parameters that significantly
improved the fit of the model to our data. These parameters were identified by comparing alternative models
using hierarchical likelihood ratio tests in the program
MODELTEST v.3.7 [82]. The evolutionary models used
were as follows: 16S – HKY+G, gltA – K81uf+I+G, coxA –
GTR+G and atpA – GTR+G.
Phylogenetic hypotheses were inferred using maximum
likelihood in PAUP v.4.b10 and using the Bayesian MC3
approach implemented in MrBayes v3.1 [83]. We combined our data with published sequences from all the
known non-vertebrate Rickettsia strains, and all the Rickettsia from the ancestral, typhus and transitional groups,
as well as Rickettsia helvetica, Rickettsia montanaensis, R.
massiliae, Rickettsia japonica, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia
peacockii and Rickettsia rickettsii from the spotted fever
group (Figure 1a). We also included O. tsutsugamushi as an
outgroup (we checked that this species is a genuine outgroup by reconstructing a 16S rDNA tree rooted with Wolbachia pipientis; data not shown). All accession numbers
are given in Additional file 1, Accession numbers of genes
used in the phylogenetic analysis. Maximum parsimony
trees were created using the tree-bisection reconnection
branch swapping method, and these were then used both
to estimate model parameters and as a starting tree for the
maximum likelihood analysis. The maximum likelihood
trees were then found using the nearest-neighbour-interchanges branch swapping method. The robustness of the
tree topologies was assessed by repeating the analysis
using 1000 bootstrapped datasets. The GTR+I+G model of
evolution was used for the concatenated dataset of the
three genes.
The Bayesian analysis incorporated four Markov chains
(three heated and one cold chain), consisting of
1,000,000 generations with sampling every 100 genera-

tions. Two simultaneous runs with different random start
trees were performed, and the first 25% of samples were
discarded as burn-in. For the Bayesian analysis including
missing data, the data were partitioned for the four different genes and assigned the appropriate evolutionary
model (given above), then unlinked so that the parameters were estimated separately and allowed to have a different evolutionary rate. The MCMC analysis was then run
for 6,000,000 generations, after which the standard deviation of split frequencies (a measure of the similarity of
the two independent trees in the run) fell below a proposed threshold for model convergence of 0.01 [83]. For
the phylogeny that contains missing data, we used only
the Bayesian approach.
Split networks for each of the four genes were constructed
using the neighbour-net method in SplitsTree4 [84,85].
Networks represent multiple trees simultaneously, and
they can therefore identify conflicting signals in the data.
These may arise from either genetic exchange between
bacterial strains, or from systematic error in the underlying model of evolution. The neighbour-net method computes a matrix of distances (much like the neighbour
joining method) and produces a network with weights
assigned to each split that are proportional to the number
of sites that support the split. We used non-parametric
bootstrapping to identify splits supported with > 95%
confidence, and only included these statistically significant splits in our network (otherwise representing the data
as a bifurcating tree) [85].
Phylogenetic tests
We tested whether there were significant topological differences between the maximum likelihood trees of the
four genes and a tree produced from the concatenated
sequences of all four genes using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [86]. The test statistic for a given gene is generated
by comparing the maximised likelihood score for that
gene with topology unconstrained, with the likelihood
obtained when topology was fixed at the maximum likelihood topology obtained from the concatenated dataset.
The null distribution of the test statistic for a gene is generated from 1000 nonparametric bootstrapped datasets,
although to reduce the computational burden, nuisance
parameters were fixed at values estimated from the original dataset (RELL method). This test was applied to each
of the genes with the Rickettsia strain from C. rufa removed
for reason of recombination (see Results).

We tested for recombination between Rickettsia strains in
two ways. First, we used the maximum χ2 test [87] implemented in RDP v3b22 [88]. This test takes all possible triplets of sequences, removes any gaps, and makes an
alignment of just the polymorphic sites. A window is then
slid along this alignment in single nucleotide steps. At

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/6

each position a χ2 statistic is calculated as a measure of the
likelihood that recombination has occurred between
these sequences. The size of the window was set at approximately 3/4 the numbers of polymorphic sites present for
each triplet. To correct for the large number of multiple
tests performed, we obtained an analysis-wide significance threshold of χ2 by repeating the analysis on 1000
datasets that were simulated without recombination (simulations performed using Seq-Gen [89]). The maximum
χ2 test of recombination is one of the most powerful tests
of recombination [90] but it can occasionally falsely infer
the presence of recombination under some conditions,
such as in regions that contain mutational hot-spots [91].
Therefore we also used the pairwise homoplasy index
(PHI) test of recombination [91] implemented in
SplitsTree4. The test exploits the fact that when recombination has occurred, sites that are physically close in the
sequence should yield compatible phylogenies more
often than distant sites. The phi statistic (Φw) quantifies
the degree of congruence between parsimonious trees at
closely-linked sites up to 100 bp (w = 100). A p-value can
then be obtained by comparing this statistic with a distribution of values obtained when the position of sites along
the sequence is determined at random. To speed computation, this null distribution can be approximated by a
normal distribution, whose mean and variance are calculated analytically from the data.
To date key transitions in the order Rickettsiales, we calibrated a 16S rDNA phylogeny of the order using the substitution rate of this gene estimated for the endosymbiont
Buchnera [55]. This tree was reconstructed with a molecular clock enforced. We checked that enforcing a clock did
not significantly reduce the likelihood of the tree by comparing the likelihoods of a tree with and without a clock
enforced using a likelihood ratio test.
