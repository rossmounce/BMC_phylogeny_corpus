Abstract
Background: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) represent one of the largest groups of functionally
diverse trans-acting non-protein-coding (npc) RNAs currently known in eukaryotic cells. Chicken
snoRNAs have been very poorly characterized when compared to other vertebrate snoRNAs. A
genome-wide analysis of chicken snoRNAs is therefore of great importance to further understand
the functional evolution of snoRNAs in vertebrates.
Results: Two hundred and one gene variants encoding 93 box C/D and 62 box H/ACA snoRNAs
were identified in the chicken genome and are predicted to guide 86 2'-O-ribose methylations and
69 pseudouridylations of rRNAs and spliceosomal RNAs. Forty-four snoRNA clusters were
grouped into four categories based on synteny characteristics of the clustered snoRNAs between
chicken and human. Comparative analyses of chicken snoRNAs revealed extensive recombination
and separation of guiding function, with cooperative evolution between the guiding duplexes and
modification sites. The gas5-like snoRNA host gene appears to be a hotspot of snoRNA gene
expansion in vertebrates. Our results suggest that the chicken is a good model for the prediction
of functional snoRNAs, and that intragenic duplication and divergence might be the major driving
forces responsible for expansion of novel snoRNA genes in the chicken genome.
Conclusion: We have provided a detailed catalog of chicken snoRNAs that aids in understanding
snoRNA gene repertoire differences between avians and other vertebrates. Our genome-wide
analysis of chicken snoRNAs improves annotation of the 'darkness matter' in the npcRNA world
and provides a unique perspective into snoRNA evolution in vertebrates.

Background
The term small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) was originally
coined to describe the nucleolar localization of this group
of RNAs relative to the other small nucleoplasmic RNAs.
In sharp contrast to the relatively low abundance spliceosomal nuclear RNA (snRNA) species, snoRNAs represent
one of the largest groups of functionally diverse trans-act-

ing non-protein-coding RNAs (npcRNAs) currently
known in eukaryotic cells [1,2]. On the basis of conserved
sequence elements and characteristic secondary structures, snoRNAs can be divided into two major classes, box
C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs. Box C/D snoRNAs contain
two conserved motifs, the 5' end box C (RUGAUGA,
where R stands for any purine) and the 3' end box D

(CUGA). Box H/ACA snoRNAs exhibit a common hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail secondary structure with the H box
(ANANNA, where N stands for any nucleotide) in the
hinge region and the ACA motif three nucleotides from
the 3' end of the molecule. During the post-transcriptional processing of diverse RNAs most members of the
known C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs respectively guide 2'-Oribose methylation and pseudouridylation (Ψ). Recently,
a new class of guide RNAs has been found to accumulate
in the small Cajal body [3] and are thus termed small
Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). scaRNAs are often
composed of both C/D box and H/ACA box domains [4]
and guide the modification of RNA-polymerase-II-transcribed snRNAs [3]. Remarkably, an increasing number of
'orphan' snoRNAs lacking antisense to known RNA targets
have been identified [5]. Many of them exhibit a tissuespecific or restricted expression pattern [6,7] and are
linked to genomic imprinting [6].
Interestingly, various snoRNA gene organizations have
been characterized in different organisms [5,8]. Most
snoRNAs are encoded in the introns of protein-coding or
non-protein-coding genes in vertebrates [9]. Many
snoRNA paralogs are usually clustered in different introns
of the same host genes (HGs) or in the introns of different
HGs by intragenic or intergenic duplication (including
retroposition) from existing snoRNAs [7,10-13], respectively. The distinct character of clustering gene organizations and evolutionary conservation of vertebrate
snoRNAs facilitates detection of snoRNA homologs by
sequence similarity alone in the genome [14]. However,
many other snoRNAs in mammals cannot be found by
simple homology search.
To date, hundreds of snoRNAs have been identified in
mammals [7,13,15-18] by approaches including computational and experimental RNomics. Although a limited
number of snoRNAs were predicted in the chicken (Gallus
gallus) genome by similarity search [19], the nature of
chicken snoRNAs is poorly understood when compared
with other vertebrates and their numbers far underrepresented. Additionally, detailed information on snoRNA
guiding functions, genomic organization and evolution in
the chicken genome is still unavailable. As a typical amniote, the chicken has evolved separately from mammals for
about 310 million years [19]. The identification of
chicken snoRNAs using conventional prediction methods
such as a similarity search might be hindered by the sufficient nucleotide variation occurring in the genome.
Recently, we developed an advanced computational package snoSeeker for the specific detection of guide box C/D
(CDseeker) and box H/ACA (ACAseeker) snoRNAs, as
well as orphan snoRNA genes in the human genome [7].
In the present work, 93 box C/D and 62 box H/ACA snoRNAs have been identified in the chicken genome by apply-

ing the computational package and experimental
methods based on RT-PCR. The characteristics of the guiding function and genomic organization of the chicken
snoRNAs have been extensively compared with the
human counterparts. As a result, we provide for the first
time a detailed catalog of chicken snoRNAs that facilitates
understanding of snoRNA gene repertoire differences
between the avian and other vertebrate lineages.

Results
Computational identification of box C/D snoRNA genes
from G. gallus
The CDseeker program was applied to search the G.gallus
genome for box C/D snoRNAs. In total, 132 gene variants
encoding 83 box C/D snoRNAs with the ability to guide
2'-O-ribose methylation at 86 residues in rRNAs and
snRNAs and 10 orphan box C/D snoRNAs were identified
from the G.gallus genome (Table 1, see Additional file 1
and 2). Sixty-five box C/D snoRNAs are singleton. The
other 28 snoRNAs have undergone one or more duplications in the chicken, which account for 67 paralogs. The
majority of these RNAs (73 snoRNAs) have been assigned
to guide only one methylation of the rRNAs or snRNAs,
and are known as single-guide snoRNAs. Seventy-one
snoRNAs uniquely guide methylations of the rRNAs, and
12 box C/D RNAs are predicted to guide methylation in
the snRNAs or both the rRNAs and snRNAs. Interestingly,
two methylation sites at 18S rRNA-C757 and U2-U47
(corresponding to human 18S rRNA-C797 and U2-U47),
which have been previously reported to lack potential
guide snoRNAs, were predicted to be guided by GGgCD20
and GGgCD76, respectively. Among the 83 guide RNAs,
only a fraction of box C/D snoRNAs (~15%) are doubleguide snoRNAs. A comparative analysis of these chicken
box C/D snoRNAs and their counterparts at the corresponding genomic loci in six other vertebrate genomes
(human, mouse, opossum, platypus, lizard and frog)
revealed that 13 snoRNA genes appeared to be specific to
the chicken or avian lineage, and the remainder had their
cognate snoRNAs in at least one other vertebrate genome
(see Additional file 3). In total, 55 chicken box C/D
snoRNA genes are conserved in amniotic species. These
snoRNAs are assigned as the core amniotic box C/D snoRNAs, out of which 31 box C/D snoRNA genes are the core
vertebrate box C/D snoRNAs conserved in vertebrates
(Figure 1A).
Computational identification of box H/ACA snoRNA genes
from G. gallus
Based on the conserved 'hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail' structure and the H and ACA/ATA box motifs, the ACAseeker
program was performed to identify chicken box H/ACA
snoRNA genes. In total, 69 RNA variants encoding 52
guide and 10 orphan box H/ACA snoRNAs were identified in the chicken genome (Table 2, see Additional file 2).

vertebrates
Chicken snoRNAs classified according to their predicted evolutionary relationships with cognate snoRNAs of
six other model vertebrates (human, mouse, opossum, platypus, lizard and frog). (A) box C/D snoRNAs. (B) box
H/ACA snoRNAs. Pairwise orthologs are assigned when orthology is detectable in the chicken and one other vertebrate
genome.
Compared with the chicken box C/D snoRNAs, a higher
percentage of box H/ACA snoRNAs (~90%) are singleton.
Only six snoRNAs had undergone one or more duplications, yielding 13 paralogs. Fifty-two guide box H/ACA
RNAs were predicted to guide 69 Ψs in rRNAs and snRNAs
(see Additional file 1). The majority of these RNAs (42
snoRNAs) have been assigned to guide Ψs of the rRNAs.
Nine scaRNAs have been predicted to guide Ψs of the
snRNAs (GGgACA48~52) or both the rRNAs and snRNAs
(GGgACA10, GGgACA14, GGgACA18 and GGgACA29).
Three Ψs, 28S rRNA-Ψ3751, U2-Ψ58, U2-Ψ91 (corresponding to human 28S rRNA-Ψ4266, U2-Ψ58 and U2Ψ91), which have been previously reported to lack a
potential guide snoRNA, were predicted to be guided by
GGgACA43, GGgACA18 and GGgACA10, respectively. In
sharp contrast to the box C/D snoRNAs, approximately
half of the H/ACA snoRNAs are capable of directing more
than one Ψ which are often located on the same rRNA or
snRNA. Interestingly, GGgACA5 and GGgACA6 show the
potential of directing three nonadjacent Ψs by a single
guide sequence and are the first to be reported in the

chicken. In the case of GGgACA51, whose sequence shows
high similarity to that of half of the U93 composed of two
tandem arranged box H/ACA RNA domains [20], it
should be annotated as the half U93 homolog present in
humans. Comparison of the conserved regions encoding
snoRNAs in the chicken and six other vertebrate genomes
revealed that eight are found to be chicken-specific, and
26 are the core amniotic box H/ACA snoRNA genes which
include 12 core vertebrate snoRNA genes (Figure 1B, see
Additional file 3).
Experimental confirmation of the computational results
Recently, PCR-based methods have been successfully used
for small RNA detection, as well as expression profiling
[21,22]. In this study, we developed an improved method
for specifically detecting the expression of snoRNA candidates (see Additional file 4). As different expression levels
might be detected for snoRNAs in different host genes, we
first detected the expression of 14 guide snoRNAs located
in different host genes to test the method we developed
(Figure 2A). In most cases, unique and obvious bands

RT-PCR2analysis of snoRNAs amplified from small RNA cDNAs of chicken embryos at stage HH34
RT-PCR analysis of snoRNAs amplified from small RNA cDNAs of chicken embryos at stage HH34. A DNA ladder on each side indicates the size of the fragments. NTC, Non-template control. M, DNA marker. (A) Expression of the five
guide box C/D snoRNAs and nine guide boxH/ACA snoRNAs. (B) Expression of the ten orphan box C/D snoRNAs and ten
orphan box H/ACA snoRNAs.

tested whether the different intensities of the electrophoresis bands observed under the same PCR conditions
reflect the different expression levels of the snoRNAs in
vivo. We next applied this method to detect the 20 orphan
snoRNAs predicted in this study. All these orphan snoRNAs were amplified and the sizes of the PCR products
were consistent with their predicted sizes (Figure 2B). Our
experimental analysis by RT-PCR demonstrated that the
snoRNA genes predicted in this study are expressed.
Clustered snoRNAs most often show conserved synteny
between humans and chickens
Almost all of the snoRNAs identified in the chicken are
located in introns of known genes or spliced expressed
sequence tags (ESTs), which is consistent with previous
reports in mammals[1,9,23]. The majority of chicken
snoRNAs (80%) appear on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10
and Z. None of the snoRNA genes was located on chromosomes 21, 22, 26, 29, 30, 31 and W.

From this study, a total of 98 box C/D and 38 box H/ACA
snoRNAs are organized into 44 clusters (see Additional
file 5). Eleven clusters carry both box C/D and box H/ACA
snoRNAs, and the other clusters harbor exclusively either
box C/D or box H/ACA snoRNAs. Five clusters reside in
the introns of non-protein-coding genes or ESTs or novel
transcripts, and the remaining 39 clusters are located in
protein-coding HGs. Genomic analysis was carried out on

clustered snoRNAs (63%) in chicken are syntenic to
human, and 36 protein-coding HGs are the orthologs of
the human HGs. Four types of snoRNA clusters were
determined depending on the synteny characteristics of
the clustered snoRNAs between chicken and human (Figure 3).
The Type-1 snoRNA clusters (clusters 1–14) show perfect
synteny between chicken and human (Figure 3A). The

Comparative analyses of the four types of snoRNA clusters between chicken and human
Comparative analyses of the four types of snoRNA clusters between chicken and human. Only one example is
presented in each type of snoRNA cluster (A-D). The exons and snoRNA regions (not drawn to scale) are denoted by black
and gray boxes, respectively. The snoRNA names, HGs and their chromosomal locations are indicated. The cognate snoRNAs

gous to those in human, indicating that they are derived
from common ancestral genes over 310 million years ago.
The Type-2 snoRNA clusters (clusters 15–33) are conserved in content but neither in snoRNA copy numbers
nor in order. Fifteen HGs of the type-2 snoRNA clusters
are orthologous between chicken and human, and the
other snoRNA clusters reside in either non-protein-coding
genes, novel transcripts or the ESTs of which their mRNA
sequences show low or no similarity between the two species. Interestingly, the HG of cluster 15 is an Ensemble
novel protein coding gene (ENSGALESTG00000033205)
and tandemly encodes multiple chicken counterparts of
human snoRNAs (ACA40, ACA18, mgh28S-2409, ACA8,

ACA1, mgh28S-2411, ACA32 and ACA25) located within
different introns of the same host gene JOSD3 (Figure 3B).
However, these eight clustered chicken snoRNAs are
arrayed in a different order when compared to those of the
human and other vertebrates, which might have resulted
from lineage-specific intragenic translocation (see Additional file 6). Sequence comparison revealed that the
mRNA sequence of ENSGALESTG00000033205 showed
low similarity (45%) to that of JOSD3, which is in sharp
contrast to the high similarity of the snoRNA counterpart
between the two species.
The Type-3 snoRNA clusters (clusters 34–37) have HGs
that are orthologous to human genes but with the inserPage 9 of 16

are inserted in cluster 34 when compared to that in
human, and the HGs (DKC1) between chicken and
human are orthologous (Figure 3C).

an HG (mRNA CR387333) whose genomic organization
is similar to that of human and mouse gas5 (growth arrestspecific transcript 5) [24], a non-protein-coding snoRNA
HG. Both contain short exons (< 100 nt) and tandem
array snoRNA counterparts in the corresponding intronic
regions (Figure 4A). With the exception of the chicken
counterpart of human U77 (in intron 4) that is replaced
by two cognate snoRNAs of human U80 (GGgCD36a and
GGgCD36b in introns 4 and 5 respectively), the other
snoRNA counterparts array in the same order on their corresponding HGs of the chicken and human. The gene
encoding mRNA CR387333 has a typical TATA box
(TATATAA) and a 5'TOP sequence (TCTgCCTTTCCgCCCCT) at position -14 to +3, indicating that it is also
a member of the 5' TOP gene family [25]. Comparison of
the two transcripts (mRNA CR387333 and gas5) revealed
that their sequence similarity varied significantly with

The Type-4 snoRNA clusters (clusters 38–44) have independently evolved in the chicken (Figure 3D). Corresponding snoRNAs could not be identified in human
orthologous regions, suggesting that these snoRNA clusters might have changed their HGs during chicken and
human divergence.

each pair of corresponding portions. The most highly conserved regions are the snoRNA sequences, whereas the
regions not encoding snoRNA are much more discrepant
(42%) between chicken and human. Furthermore, the
presence of only short ORFs and numerous stop codons
suggests the low probability of protein coding (Figure 4B),
which is similar to gas5. Therefore, the gene encoding
mRNA CR387333 is classified as a gas5-like non-proteincoding snoRNA HG, and the intron-encoded snoRNAs
may be the only functional portions of the transcript.
Structural and functional evolution of chicken snoRNAs
Comparative functional analyses have revealed that many
guide snoRNAs involved in rRNA posttranscriptional
modification are phylogenetically conserved in mammals. However, extensive recombination and separation
of guiding function are also discerned in the chicken
snoRNAs when compared with the human snoRNAs. For
example, human box C/D snoRNAs U36A and U36C possess the conserved function as guides for the 2'-O-ribose
methylation of 18S rRNA-A668 and 28S rRNA-A3703
[26], respectively, whereas both of the corresponding sites

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/86

in the chicken rRNAs are predicted to be guided by the single snoRNA GGgCD18a, as well as its paralog GGgCD18b
(Figure 5A). A similar case of recombination can be found
in the box H/ACA snoRNA GGgACA29 which is predicted
to guide the Ψs at 28S rRNA-Ψ1612 and snRNA U5-Ψ43,
while the two corresponding modifications are reported
to be independently guided by human snoRNAs ACA56
and ACA57, respectively [16,27,28]. In contrast, the
human snoRNA U32A/B and U69 are double guiders and
potentially guide two methylations and two Ψs respectively, whereas the four corresponding modification functions are separately possessed by four single guiders in the
chicken (Figure 5B).
It is worth noting that the cooperative evolution of the
sequences and guiding function sites can be found in
some of the chicken snoRNAs. A case in point is the
GGgACA30 and its human cognate E3 snoRNA. Although
high sequence similarity (~75%) was found between the
two counterparts, GGgACA30 potentially guides the 28S
rRNA-Ψ1612, -Ψ3875 and -Ψ3976, whereas E3 is predicted to simply guide the 28S rRNA-Ψ4390 (correspond-

ing to chicken 28S rRNA-Ψ3875) [29]. The analysis of
functional loci has revealed that loss of the other two
guiding functions for E3 results from extensive nucleotide
substitutions and indels, disrupting the snoRNA/substrate
RNA base-pairing potential of the 5' and 3' regions in the
snoRNA. In contrast, the chicken cognate presents a perfect Ψ-guiding domain and functional motif. Another
example is GGgACA14 as a guider for the Ψs of the U1219 and 18S rRNA-775, whereas its human counterpart
ACA22 is predicted to guide the Ψs at different residues of
rRNA (28S rRNA-Ψ4966 [16] and -Ψ4975 [17]). In addition, nucleotide variation can also destroy the guiding
function and results in the conversion of guide snoRNAs
to orphan snoRNAs, such as GGoACA3 versus the human
cognate ACA8 snoRNA.

Discussion
A model for the prediction of functional snoRNAs in the
genome
Comparative analysis of genomes between closely or distantly related species might provide limited information
on conserved regions [30]. The chicken bridges the evolutionary gap between mammals and other vertebrates and
represents an intermediate-level comparison for the
human, making it very useful for detecting functional elements with high specificity [19]. As a family of the most
abundant and important noncoding RNAs, many snoRNAs were found to be conserved in different organisms. In
this study, we have provided a detailed catalog of chicken
snoRNAs to understand snoRNA gene repertoire differences between avian and other vertebrate lineages. A total
of 201 gene variants encoding 93 box C/D and 62 box H/
ACA snoRNAs were identified in the chicken genome. In
contrast to extensive functional and/or pseudogene paralogs found in mammals [17,31], the majority of snoRNAs
in chicken remain singletons, whereas some other novel
paralogs are produced by duplication and seem specific to
the chicken lineage. Notably, clustered snoRNAs show a
large degree of conserved synteny between chicken and
human, which greatly simplifies classification of the
chicken orthologs of human snoRNAs. Unlike the eutherian mammals with tandem repeated snoRNAs in the
imprinted regions [32,33], none of the imprinted snoRNA
orthologs are found in the chicken. Our result might provide some clues to support that imprinting seems to have
evolved in therians and hence has only been confirmed in
marsupials and eutherian mammals [34-36]. Intriguingly,
most of the imprinted snoRNAs in mammals are orphan
snoRNAs and constitute new members of the 'dark matter'
in the RNA world. With the exception of snoRNA HBII-52
that is reported to be involved in RNA editing [37] and
alternative splicing [38], the function of the other orphan
snoRNAs in mammals remains enigmatic. In our study,
we also identified 20 orphan snoRNAs that are expressed
in chicken embryos and conserved in different vertebrate
species. As with microRNAs, the conservation of snoRNAs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/86

among species suggests that they bear conserved biological functions. These orphan snoRNAs might therefore be
subject to purifying selection and hence are predicted to
be functional in still unknown biological processes.
Intragenic duplication and divergence dominated in the
expansion of novel snoRNAs in the chicken
Diverse molecular mechanisms are involved in the creation of new gene (protein-coding gene) structures, such as
gene duplication and retroposition [39]. Compared with
protein-coding genes, little is known about the creation of
novel npcRNA genes in the genome. To our knowledge,
two main strategies are responsible for the generation of
most of the novel snoRNA paralogs in vertebrates. The
first strategy is that some snoRNA paralogs are generated
by intragenic duplication where the snoRNAs are tandemly duplicated within the same gene, a process termed
cis-duplication [12,13]. In many cases, the sequence and
the secondary structure of these snoRNA paralogs are
highly conserved. The second strategy is where snoRNAs
may duplicate and insert into a new host gene or a paralogous host gene in a different genomic location, and is
termed trans-duplication [12,13]. In this study, we
observed that almost all of the chicken snoRNA paralogs
are generated via intragenic duplication, and similar cases
are also found in other vertebrates including platypus
snoRNAs [13]. There is only one case of five GGgCD61
paralogs created by the combination of intragenic and
intergenic duplication during the chicken snoRNA expansion. Most of the novel snoRNA paralogs (~18%) emerge
in the adjacent intron regions where the corresponding
loci in other mammals lack the cognate snoRNAs, which
is in contrast to the few snoRNAs (~7%) found in platypus
[13]. The sequences of many snoRNA paralogs have
undergone extensive nucleotide variation, but the guiding
function regions and the conserved structures are maintained, indicating that strong purifying selection is acting
upon them. However, the nucleotide substitutions and
insertions or deletions (indels) might also endow the
snoRNAs with novel guiding functions (such as
GGgACA30 and GGgACA14) or destroy the guiding function (such as GGoACA3), depending on whether or not a
perfect functional domain is present within the sequence
variation. Recently, hundreds of snoRNAs derived from
non-autonomous retroposition have been reported in the
human [10,11] and platypus genomes [31], revealing a
new dimension in the evolution of novel snoRNAs. However, there is no evident trace of the snoRNA-retroposonlike counterparts found in the chicken genome (data not
shown), which is consistent with the paucity of functional
genes formed by retroposition [19]. Therefore, based on
both our results and information obtained from other vertebrate genome analyses, snoRNAs derived from retroposition may originate from mammals. Intragenic
duplication and divergence might be the major driving

force responsible for expansion of novel snoRNAs in the
chicken genome.
A hotspot of snoRNA gene expansion in the gas5-like nonprotein-coding snoRNA HG
Non-protein-coding HGs encoding snoRNAs are unusual
because they do not appear to specify protein products
and snoRNAs may be the only functional portions of the
transcripts [40]. Different members of the non-proteincoding HGs encoding snoRNAs (UHG, gas5, U17HG,
U19HG, U50HG) have been reported in humans and mice
[24,40-43], and even in fruit flies [44]. Non-protein-coding HGs have not been found in Caenorhabditis elegans,
which suggests a different strategy adopted in higher
metazoa for regulating snoRNA expression [45]. Among
all the members of non-protein-coding HGs, gas5 is of
interest because of its large snoRNA-coding capability and
deviant accumulation in cells undergoing serum starvation or density arrest [24]. In this study, we detect the gas5like HG which also lacks protein-coding potential but
instead encodes 10 box C/D snoRNAs within its introns.
Unexpectedly, we could not find any other non-proteincoding HGs and corresponding snoRNAs in the chicken
genome. Comparative analyses of the snoRNA content in
the gas5 and other gas5-like HGs reveal diverse snoRNA
numbers and gene orders in different vertebrates. In this
study, nine human cognate snoRNAs were identified in
the chicken gas5-like HG. However, the human U77 counterpart within the fourth intron is replaced by its cognate
U80 snoRNA (GGgCD36a), and the other U80 paralog
(GGgCD36b) is tandemly arrayed in the next intron,
which leads to a different gene order compared to human
(Figure 4A). Our comparative analyses of the snoRNAs in
gas5 of vertebrates indicted that the mammalian U77
snoRNA might evolve from the other non-mammalian
vertebrate cognate U80 snoRNA which has undergone
mutation and lost the function of guiding adenine methylation at the corresponding site of 28S rRNA. In addition,
a novel snoRNA-like sequence is also detected in intron 6
and found to be chicken-specific, suggesting the process of
snoRNA expansion is actively ongoing. Intriguingly, similar cases of extensive snoRNA gene tandem duplication
and intragenic transposition can be detected in the corresponding HGs of other vertebrates, such as Danio rerio and
Xenopus tropicalis (data not shown). Although the mechanism by which snoRNA sequences become embedded in
the introns of their HGs is still enigmatic, the gas5-like
HGs appears to be a hotspot for gaining snoRNA novelties
in vertebrates.

Conclusion
This is the first genome-wide and systematic screen for
snoRNAs in the chicken by applying a computational
package and experimental methods. The characteristics of
the guiding function and genomic organization of the
chicken snoRNAs were extensively compared with that of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/86

the human counterparts. We have provided a detailed catalog of chicken snoRNAs to understand snoRNA gene repertoire differences between avian and other vertebrate
lineages. Our results improve annotation of the 'darkness
matter' in the npcRNA world of the vertebrate genome
and provide a unique perspective into snoRNA evolution
in vertebrates.

Methods
Data sources
Ten chicken-vertebrate pairwise alignments (galGal3/
hg18, galGal3/mm8, galGal3/rn4, galGal3/equCab1,
galGal3/monDom4, galGal3/ornAna1, galGal3/anoCar1,
galGal3/xenTro2, galGal3/danRer4 and galGal3/fr2)
whole-genome alignment (WGA) sequences and the
Zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) sequence data (taeGut1)
were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site http://genome.ucsc.edu. The repeat families were
removed by RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/
PreMaskedGenomes.html. Sequences and annotation
data for known human snoRNA genes (which were used
in program training) were downloaded from snoRNALBME-db on March 2008 as references for chicken snoRNAs http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr/[4]. UCSC KnownGene, RefGene, Genscan and Ensembl annotation for
chicken protein genes and transcript units were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site and
Ensembl Genome Browser http://www.ensembl.org/.

The chicken 28S and 18S rRNA gene sequences (see Additional files 7) were obtained by combining experimental
and bioinformatical approaches. The 5.8S rRNA and
snRNA (U1-U6, and U12) sequences were retrieved from
the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site based on similarity search. The 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation
sites of human rRNAs and snRNAs were mapped to the
chicken rRNA and snRNA sequences.
snoRNA searching strategies and sequence analyses
We systematically searched the chicken genome for snoRNAs with 10 whole-genome alignments (WGA) using
as
snoSeeker
http://genelab.zsu.edu.cn/snoseeker/
described previously [7]. For box C/D snoRNAs, the 15 nt
flanking sequences of known snoRNA were extracted for
folding the terminal stem and training (the CDseeker program extends 5' and 3' stems of the snoRNA sequences by
15 nt). For box H/ACA snoRNAs, the maximum tail
length was 3 nt downstream of the ACA box. The potential
targets (2'-O-methylation and Ψ) in rRNAs and snRNAs
were also determined using snoSeeker. For the comparative analyses of vertebrate snoRNAs, we used the BLAT and
the convert track of the UCSC Genome Brower. The
human snoRNA-HGs are used as the reference for retrieving the chicken counterparts using the UCSC convert
track. Next, the introns of chicken HGs were extracted as a
dataset for searching the snoRNA candidates using snoPage 13 of 16

RNA isolation and construction of snoRNA cDNA libraries
Total cellular RNA was isolated from stage HH34 chicken
embryos by the guanidine thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform procedure described by Chomoczynski et al. [46].
The construction of two families of snoRNA cDNA libraries was performed as described previously [18] with little
revision. Briefly, 10 μg total RNA was polyadenylated
using a poly(A) polymerase (Takara) at 30°C for 20 min
and subsequently reverse-transcribed into the firststranded cDNAs using [γ-32P]dATP labeled anchor primer
dT16-TGT (for box H/ACA snoRNA) and dT16-TCAG (for
box CD snoRNA) and MMLV reverse transcriptase
(Promega) at 42°C for 1 hr. The reaction mixture was sizefractioned on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel (8 M
urea and 1 × TBE buffer). cDNAs with sizes ranging from
90 to 180 nt (for box CD snoRNA) and from 140 to 170
nt (for box H/ACA snoRNA) were excised and eluted from
the gel in 0.3 M NaCl buffer. The selected cDNA was tailed
with dGTP at the 3' end by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Takara) at 37°C for 30 min. G-tailed
cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with a forward primer
dT23H2 and a reverse primer polyCM. A snoRNA-specific
primer and a universal reverse primer polyCM were used
for amplification of each of the snoRNAs. The routine
PCR protocol (94°C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of 94°C for
1 min, 50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 5
min) was used. A 5 μl sample of each PCR product was
analyzed on a 2.5% agarose gel.
Oligodeoxynucleotides
Oligonucleotides for PCR-based detection and primers
used for PCR of the chicken 18S and 28S rRNA genes were
synthesized by Invitrogen Co. (Shanghai, China) and are
shown in Additional file 8. The primers used in the reverse
transcription reaction were 5' end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP
(Yahui Co.) and subjected to purification according to
standard laboratory protocols.
