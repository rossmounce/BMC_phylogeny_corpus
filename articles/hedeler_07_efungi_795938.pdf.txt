Abstract
Background: The number of sequenced fungal genomes is ever increasing, with about 200
genomes already fully sequenced or in progress. Only a small percentage of those genomes have
been comprehensively studied, for example using techniques from functional genomics.
Comparative analysis has proven to be a useful strategy for enhancing our understanding of
evolutionary biology and of the less well understood genomes. However, the data required for
these analyses tends to be distributed in various heterogeneous data sources, making systematic
comparative studies a cumbersome task. Furthermore, comparative analyses benefit from close
integration of derived data sets that cluster genes or organisms in a way that eases the expression
of requests that clarify points of similarity or difference between species.
Description: To support systematic comparative analyses of fungal genomes we have developed
the e-Fungi database, which integrates a variety of data for more than 30 fungal genomes. Publicly
available genome data, functional annotations, and pathway information has been integrated into a
single data repository and complemented with results of comparative analyses, such as MCL and
OrthoMCL cluster analysis, and predictions of signaling proteins and the sub-cellular localisation of
proteins. To access the data, a library of analysis tasks is available through a web interface. The
analysis tasks are motivated by recent comparative genomics studies, and aim to support the study
of evolutionary biology as well as community efforts for improving the annotation of genomes.
Web services for each query are also available, enabling the tasks to be incorporated into
workflows.
Conclusion: The e-Fungi database provides fungal biologists with a resource for comparative
studies of a large range of fungal genomes. Its analysis library supports the comparative study of
genome data, functional annotation, and results of large scale analyses over all the genomes stored
in the database. The database is accessible at http://www.e-fungi.org.uk, as is the WSDL for the web
services.

Background
A large number of genome projects are under way, with
about 670 genomes completely sequenced and more than
2,500 genomes still in progress (Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) [1] statistic, accessed November 2007). Bacterial sequencing projects form the largest group of
genome projects with about 1,800 completed or ongoing,
followed by the eukaryotes with about 850 projects.
Amongst the eukaryotes, about 200 fungal genomes are
being sequenced, followed by protozoa and plants with
about 140 and 130 sequencing projects, respectively. The
large number of sequenced genomes can provide the basis
for comparative genomics analyses, which have already
proven invaluable for studying the evolution and genetic
diversity of kingdoms, identifying species-specific genes
and those conserved between genomes, or examining the
expansion or contraction of protein families (e.g., [2-6]).
Not only are the fungi the most frequently sequenced
kingdom within the eukaryotes, in addition the
sequenced fungi have been selected to form clusters of
related species, thus maximising their combined value for
comparative genomics and evolutionary biology [7]. They
also play an important role in medicine, agriculture and
industry. This makes the fungi a prime candidate for a systematic comparative study of eukaryotic biology and evolution.
Comparative analyses can be used, amongst others, for
the following analyses:
• Identification of species-specific proteins/protein families or those conserved in closely related species, which
can help to analyse conservations in species exhibiting
distinct phenotypes, e.g., growth habits, lifestyles, or pathogenicity;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/426

• Distribution, diversity and conservation of proteins with
particular functional domains in related fungal genomes.
With the wealth of sequenced fungal genomes, the fungi
can therefore not only serve as model organisms for
eukaryotes [7], but could also provide an important setting for the development of techniques for comparative
analysis of eukaryotes.
To facilitate comparative genomics, genomic data needs
to be stored in multi-species databases instead of model
genome databases capturing only data on a single genome
[9,10]. For the fungi, a number of multi-genome data
repositories are already available in which data generated
by fungal genome sequencing projects is deposited. These
data sources include SGD [11], the Fungal Genome Initiative (FGI) at the Broad Institute [12] or the Integrated
Microbial Genome (IMG) resource provided at the JGI
[13]. A large number of genomes are also available
through Entrez [14]. Although these data sources store
many fungi, the emphasis in their design is not primarily
on a systematic comparison as such.
Furthermore, a number of additional databases are available, specialising in particular kinds of data, some of
which are placed in Figure 1 according to the diversity of
data they integrate and the number of genomes they
cover. These resources include the Gene Ontology project
[15] providing functional annotation of proteins, the
Pfam database [16] providing information on protein
domains and families, KEGG [17], Reactome [18] and
Metacyc [19] capturing information about pathways, as
well as PCAS [20] and SPdb [21] storing predicted signal
peptides. These specialised databases tend to contain only

one particular kind of data but for a fairly large number of
genomes. However, despite the large number of genomes
integrated, as shown in Figure 1, most of these databases
tend to cover only a limited number of fungal genomes.
In addition to the types of data already mentioned, more
and more functional genomics data sets are becoming
available in various data sources.
Even though a number of multi-genome data sources are
available, the distribution of the genomic data and additional data, such as functional annotation or pathway
information, in heterogeneous data repositories, makes
systematic comparisons of a large number of genomes a
challenging task. To overcome the issues associated with
the distribution of data in heterogeneous data repositories, and to facilitate comparative studies, a number of
approaches have been taken to integrating a variety of different kinds of data for a large number of genomes. Databases that contain fungal among other genomes include
Génolevures [22], IMG [13], Ensembl [23], the UCSC
genome browser [24] and Entrez [14].
However, even though these are multispecies databases
they do not provide analysis facilities powerful enough to
carry out comparative analyses as mentioned above. This
is due to the provision of predominantly gene-centred
query facilities and visualisations that also tend to be species-centred in the sense that the analysis or search is
focussed on a particular genome, and the results can then
be related to other species, for example, by identification
of orthologous proteins. This limitation makes the systematic comparative analysis of a large range of genomes
a cumbersome task.
Here, we present e-Fungi, the first large-scale integrative
repository of fungal genomes with an emphasis on supporting systematic comparative studies. To achieve this, eFungi integrates primary data obtained from a number of
data sources and complements it with results of cluster
analyses and other derived data that has been generated
using large scale analyses of the genome data. The stored
data can be analysed using a library of tasks that can be
accessed using a web interface provided on the e-Fungi
website [25] and as web services. With an emphasis on
cluster-based analysis carried out over a range of genomes,
e-Fungi represents a departure from gene-centric data
sources and a move towards cluster-based data sources
that provide better support for comparative studies.

Construction and content
In this section the construction and content of the e-Fungi
database are described. The data sources from which the
primary data are obtained are introduced, as well as the
processes that generate the derived data. Furthermore, an
overview of the database schema is provided, the loading

infrastructure introduced, and the library of analysis tasks
presented.
Data collection
Primary data
Four different types of primary data are obtained from a
variety of repositories and integrated into the e-Fungi
database: genomic data, Gene Ontology annotations,
pathway data and EST data. Genomic data consists of the
genome sequence with varying degrees of annotation.
This annotation can include the prediction of genes with
their introns, exons and predicted proteins, as well as their
locations on contigs, supercontigs or chromosomes. Table
1 lists all the genomes integrated into the e-Fungi database
with the data sources from which the data has been
obtained. Other data has been obtained as follows:

• Gene Ontology annotation for S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and
C. albicans has been obtained from SGD [11], Sanger
GeneDB [26] and CGD [27].
• Pathway information including the assignment of pathways to proteins for S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae,
S. bayanus, E. gossypii, K. lactis, K. waltii, D. hansenii, C.
albicans, C. glabrata, Y. lipolytica, S. pombe, N. crassa, M. grisea, A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. oryzae and E. cuniculi has
been obtained from KEGG [17].
• Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data are obtained from
the COGEME Phytopathogenic Fungi and Oomycete EST
Database [28].
Derived data
The following kinds of derived data are stored in the database:

• Clustering sequences from 36 fungal genomes: We compared 348,995 protein sequences from the 36 genomes
integrated in e-Fungi (see Table 1) using BlastP [29] with
an E-value cut-off of 10-5. This resulted in 47,342,483 hits.
Markov Chain Clustering (MCL) [30] was then applied to
generate clusters of similar proteins, using 2.5 as a moderate inflation value and 10-10 as a comparatively strict Evalue cut-off. This generated 23,724 clusters containing in
total 282,061 sequences, while 66,934 sequences were
singletons.
• Orthology assignments: To identify orthologous proteins between the 36 genomes, the BlastP results were analysed with OrthoMCL [31] using its default parameters
(i.e., an E-value of 10-5). The analysis produced in total
30,084 clusters, with 5,406 of those containing just paralogues and 24,678 containing potential orthologous proteins. Out of these clusters of potential orthologues,
14,113 are unambiguous orthologue clusters, while

10,565 are ambiguous clusters with orthologues and
recent paralogues.

All the generated data are integrated into the e-Fungi database using the loading infrastructure described below.

• Domain assignments: To identify functional domains
and other known sequence motifs, predicted proteins
from all 36 genomes were scanned with the Pfam database release 18 [16] using hmmpfam [32]. A total of 6,260
different Pfam domains were identified in 196,425 proteins, using an E-value cut-off of 0.1. The distribution of 5
of the most frequently found Pfam domains among the
genomes is shown in Figure 2.

Implementation
The e-Fungi infrastructure consists of several components:
the database itself, the population infrastructure, and the
library of analysis tasks. An overview of the infrastructure
is shown in Figure 5 and its components are introduced
below.

• Protein localisation predictions: Protein sub-cellular
localisations were predicted using SignalP [33], PSort [34]
and Wolf-PSort [35] with the default parameters. Distributions of the most frequently assigned PSort and WolfPSort predictions among the genomes are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

Database schema
The Object Database Management System Versant FastObjects [36] is used to store the data integrated into e-Fungi.
The database schema has been implemented using Java
Data Objects (JDO), an industry standard interface-based
abstraction of persistence. Using JDO for storing the data
allows the direct implementation of the object data model
without the need to map between the object model and,

The database schema can be divided into different parts,
modelling the different types of data introduced above.
The parts of the schema for genomic sequences, annotations, pathways and ESTs are based on published models
[17,28,37,38]. The part of the schema modelling the
derived data is introduced in more detail in the following.
Results of the MCL and OrthoMCL cluster analyses consist
of an identifier for each cluster and the assignments of



proteins to clusters, captured in the classes MclCluster and
OrthoMclCluster. To be able to retrieve the MCL cluster or
the OrthoMCL cluster for a particular protein, the class
Protein has an association with both MclCluster and
OrthoMclCluster.
The results of the predictions of protein sub-cellular localisations are captured following a similar approach for all
three different prediction methods. Each prediction
method can have a number of different outcomes, e.g.,
golgi, cytoplasmic, or plasma membrane. These are captured in PSortPrediction, WolfPSortPrediction and SignalPPrediction. Each prediction has a 0-to-many
association with Protein, enabling the retrieval of all proteins with a particular predicted localisation. However,
not only are the final predictions provided as a result of
the analyses, so are a number of scores associated with the
predictions. Scores returned by each prediction analysis
are captured in PSortResult, WolfPSortResult and SignalPResult, which have a 1-to-1 association with the protein
for which the prediction has been made. The scores are
captured as provenance information associated with each
analysis, thereby recording all the information contained
in the report provided as a result of each analysis.

Figure infrastructure
Loading 6
Loading infrastructure. Schematic overview of the loading infrastructure employed to integrate primary and derived data
into the e-Fungi database.

Loading infrastructure
A loading infrastructure has been developed to integrate
data from a variety of data sources, as listed in Table 1, and
map the information onto the e-Fungi database schema.
The infrastructure consists of 3 general modules, the loaders, parsers and wrappers (see Figure 6). The loaders are
specific to each data source and data format. For example,
the genomic data loader for data from the Broad Institute
gathers the contigs, genes and protein sequence data from
3 separate FASTA files and relates the data to information
provided in other files of different formats. Data from
each source is parsed into a generalised format that can be
processed by the loader using the respective parsers for
each of the available data formats (e.g., FASTA, GTF, GFF).
The wrappers are responsible for creating and linking
objects, e.g., when loading data on a protein the wrapper

will create a Protein, create a PrimaryPolypeptide
sequence, and link these together.
The loading infrastructure is designed to minimise maintenance and ensure extensibility of the database. Each
module protects the others from sections that are prone to
changes. For example, changes in the source, e.g., changes
in location, format or method of access, will only require
modifications of the loaders without affecting the existing
parsers or wrappers. The parsers, on the other hand, act as
tools for the loaders and can be easily improved or added
as required. For the database, wrappers provide a layer of
protection that allows the schema to be changed without
the need to modify existing loaders or parsers. This allows
the database to be extended easily to include further kinds
of data without the need to rebuild the loading infrastructure.

Library of analysis tasks
The data stored in the e-Fungi database can be analysed
using pre-determined analysis tasks that can be parameterised, so-called canned queries. More than 90 queries
are currently available, varying in their complexity from
simple retrieval tasks to complex analysis tasks. Similar
queries based on the type of data analysed are grouped
together (see Table 2 for an overview of the categories).
Providing pre-determined analysis tasks as a means to
explore and analyse the stored data might seem quite limiting at first. However, as shown in the next section, it
allows complex analysis tasks to be provided that are
beyond simple keyword- or identifier-based retrieval of
stored data.

Utility
The data stored in e-Fungi can be accessed through a web
interface and web services, which have been generated
using Pierre [39]. A Java Graphical User Interface (GUI),
described elsewhere [38], is currently only used locally,
but can be made available on request.
Web interface access
The database can be accessed through the e-Fungi web site
[25] by either following the link 'Connect to the database'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/426

or by choosing the category 'Database' in the menu on the
left hand side of the page and choosing the 'Connect to
the database' link. In both cases, a further link to the
WSDL describing the web services is also provided. The
web services are introduced later.
Browse
Browse provides an overview of the genomes stored in the
database, but can also be used as an entry point to explore
and analyse the data by following either of the two different kinds of links provided: (i) navigational links, and (ii)
links to analysis tasks. The former, for example, enable the
retrieval of contigs or chromosomes for a particular
genome, whereas the latter link to analysis tasks provided
in the canned query library using the chosen entry, e.g., a

Simple Search
The Simple Search feature exposes the tasks provided in
the canned query library mentioned above. Documentation for each query can be found under the category 'Documentation' in the menu on the left hand side of the eFungi web site or by following the 'Help' link provided on
each query form (see Figure 7). Information includes the
type of input required, a number of example inputs, and

Table 2: Canned query groups currently provided

Canned query group

Canned query group

Annotation of proteins in
clusters

Queries in this group retrieve annotation of all the proteins in particular clusters. The annotation consists of PSort,
Wolf-PSort and SignalP predictions, as well as GO annotations, Pfam domains, Enzyme annotation and pathways for
each protein, as well as its assignment to a particular MCL and OrthoMCL cluster. The clusters can either be chosen
by providing an identifier of a particular cluster or they can be based on the proteins they contain, such as proteins
with a particular GO annotation or a particular cellular localisation as predicted by PSort or Wolf- PSort.
This group of queries retrieves the cellular localisation for proteins as predicted by PSort and Wolf-PSort. It also
retrieves proteins with a particular predicted cellular localisation.
Collection of general EST analyses. Information available include group/hierarchy structure of ESTs and genes as well
as number of homologs of genes in all genomes in the database.
Queries to retrieve Mcl Clusters containing proteins of a given genome and proteins of essential or non-essential
yeast genes.
This group of queries analyses clusters containing a given genome and proteins of essential or non-essential yeast
genes in terms of the number of genomes present in those clusters.
Queries in this group enable the retrieval of Gene Ontology or Pfam annotation for a given protein, or the retrieval
of proteins with a given annotation.
Collection of queries for general genomic analyses, such as retrieving the exons of a particular gene.
Queries in this group provide a general analysis of the MCL clusters in the database. Clusters containing proteins of
a given genome, or a group of genomes, such as plant pathogens or filamentous fungi, can be retrieved. Furthermore,
clusters that contain more or less than a given percentage of proteins of a given genome can also be obtained.
This group of queries provide a general analysis of the OrthoMCL clusters in the database. The queries in this group
are similar in scope to the queries in the MCL cluster analysis group.
Queries provided in this group retrieve pathways and enzyme annotations for a particular protein as well as all the
proteins in a given pathway or with a particular enzyme annotation.
The query in this group analyses the redundancy in a given species. Genome redundancy is determined by counting
the number of proteins of that given genome in MCL clusters.
To retrieve the SignalP prediction for a given protein or proteins with a given SignalP prediction, i.e., secretory or
non-secretory proteins, queries in this group can be used.
Collection of queries for transcript abundance analyses. These queries enable the identification of genes that may be
highly expressed under a particular growth condition. Information of these genes and conditions can also be
retrieved.

section are introduced in the following to illustrate the
utility of the e-Fungi database:

a description of the output provided by the query. Furthermore, information on the runtime of long running queries is also provided. The canned queries provided to
support the comparative analyses listed in the background

1. Identification of species-specific protein families or those conserved in closely related species. The queries 'Get MCL clusters with proteins of a given genome' or 'Get OrthoMCL
clusters with proteins of a given genome', which can be
found in the group 'MCL cluster analysis' and 'OrthoMCL
cluster analysis', respectively, can be used to retrieve all
clusters containing proteins of a particular genome and
perhaps identify clusters containing only paralogues of
the chosen genome, i.e., possible species-specific proteins.
To run a query, the appropriate query category is chosen,
e.g., MCL clusters or OrthoMCL clusters. From the list of
canned queries in the chosen group, the canned query of
interest is selected and the user is presented with a form
for the required input parameters (e.g., Figure 7). For
some of the input parameters, an existing value feature
exists, enabling users to choose a value from a list of possible values. For other parameters, the Advanced Search
feature can be used to retrieve the exact value, such as for
a particular Gene Ontology Annotation or Pfam domain,
as illustrated later. With the input parameters provided,
the query can be executed and the results displayed (see
Figure 8). Some of the result reports provide navigation in

the form of links, similar to the navigation in Browse, for
further exploration and analysis of the results.

pathway', part of the 'Annotation of proteins in clusters'
group, can be used.

2. Contraction or expansion of protein families. The query 'Get
all MCL clusters with more than a given percentage of proteins of a given genome' can be used to identify outlying
clusters. The query is part of the group 'MCL cluster analysis' and has a counterpart in the group 'OrthoMCL cluster
analysis'. To identify protein families that are conserved in
genomes exhibiting a certain phenotype, the query 'Get
MCL clusters containing proteins of a group of genomes'
or its counterpart that analyses OrthoMCL clusters can be
used. A group of genomes can be specified by their exhibited phenotypes, such as growth form or pathogenicity.
Analyses to identify species-specific protein families or
those that are conserved in related species with a particular phenotype, as well as studies of contraction or expansion of protein families, have been part of recent
comparative studies [3,40-42].

Advanced Search
The Advanced Search feature can be used to retrieve
entries for which a property value or a range of property
values can be specified. The user specifies the type of entry
to be retrieved and the filters that the returned entries have
to match. Similar to the Simple Search, a form is provided
requesting input parameters for the Advanced Search. The
example of an Advanced Search shown in Figure 9
retrieves all the biosynthesis pathways, i.e., all the KEGG
pathways the name of which ends in 'biosynthesis'.

3. Genome redundancy in a range of related species, illustrating the importance of genome duplication [43,44]. The
canned query 'Get the number of paralogues for all clusters containing proteins of a given genome' that can be
found in the group 'Redundancy analysis' can be used.
4. Identification of secreted proteins, which in pathogens could
play important roles in host-pathogen interactions. This analysis can be aided by executing either of the following
canned queries 'Get secretory proteins for a given
genome', which is part of the group 'Secretome analysis',
or 'Get annotation for proteins of a given genome in MCL/
OrthoMCL clusters with secretory proteins'. The queries
retrieving the annotation of proteins in MCL or
OrthoMCL clusters are part of the group 'Annotation of
proteins in clusters'.

Web service access
Programmatic access to all the simple and advanced
search facilities is provided by a web service interface. This
enables the integration of e-Fungi web services with other
web services to build complex workflows for data analysis
and visualisation.

A simple workflow example, implemented in Taverna
[46], is shown in Figure 10. In this example, the ESTs representing an Open Reading Frame (ORF) are aligned. The
workflow, built using web services from e-Fungi and EBI
SOAPLab [47], retrieves the ESTs (that represent the ORF
of interest), and generates a set of aligned EST sequences
and an alignment plot. Firstly, the e-Fungi web service
operation, 'getEstFromOpenReadingFrame' is used to
retrieve all the ESTs that represent the ORF of interest. The
results are then parsed, the required information extracted
(using tools in Taverna) and passed to the web service
operation 'emma' (from EBI SOAPLab) that performs

5. Conservation of genes defined as essential for growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [8] among fungal genomes. This analysis is supported by a number of queries that can be found
in the groups 'Essential yeast genes cluster analysis' and
'Essential yeast genes orthology analysis'. Similar studies
using the essential genes identified in Candida albicans
have been reported in [7].
6. Conservation of components of metabolic pathways among
fungal genomes [45]. Again, this analysis is supported by a
number of canned queries, such as 'Get proteins that are
in the same (KEGG reference) pathway as a given protein'
of the group 'Pathway analysis', which retrieves all the
proteins that are known to participate in a particular pathway. To analyse newly sequenced genomes and identify
proteins that could potentially be part of a pathway, the
query 'Get annotation for proteins of a given genome in
the same MCL/OrthoMCL clusters as proteins in a given

Figure 9

an alignment plot, highlighting the aligned sections for
the group of ESTs. The WSDL for the e-Fungi web service
used within this workflow is:
<wsdl:definitions targetNamespace="urn:uk.org.efungi"

Two different kinds of web services are provided for the
simple searches: (i) specific and (ii) generic. The specific
web service offers users a separate operation for each individual canned query, while the generic service provides
users an all-in-one operation that is able to access all the
available canned queries. All results returned from the
web services are formatted in XML to ease parsing. Supporting operations are also provided to aid the usage of
the web service. For example, the web service operation
'identifyAdvancedSearchCollections' returns all the available types of data that support the Advanced Search. The
e-Fungi web service is deployed using Axis [48] and can be
accessed via Taverna (among other methods) by using
Taverna's 'WSDL scavenger' feature.

Case study – Using e-Fungi to investigate fungal
cytochrome P450 proteins
The case study presented in this section investigates the
distribution, diversity and conservation of proteins with
particular functional domains among related fungal
genomes [3,41-43,49].

Cytochrome P450 proteins form a superfamily of proteins
which are found in many organisms, including bacteria,
fungi, plants and mammals. They are monooxygenase
enzymes that catalyse bioconversion processes. These
include the degradation of complex biopolymers, such as
the breakdown of lignin by Phanerochaete chrysosporium
[50], and the production of secondary metabolites. In
order to compare the P450omes [50] of different fungal
species, we used the query 'Get proteins with a given Pfam
annotation', which can be found in the group 'Functional
annotation analysis', entering the accession number
PF00067. The result of this query is a list of proteins in
which this motif has been identified, along with the EValue and score associated with each identification as well
as the MCL and OrthoMCL cluster in which the protein
has been placed. The numbers of P450 proteins identified
in each fungal species (see Table 3) appear to be in agreement with previously published results for A. oryzae (149
P450 proteins), A. nidulans (102), A. fumigatus (72) [51]
and P. chrysosporium (150) [50].
The distribution of P450 proteins amongst the fungi is
clearly unequal. The Hemiascomycetes and the Schizosaccharomycete Sz. pombe have far fewer P450 proteins than
filamentous Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycetes. However, there are also large differences between different filamentous Ascomycetes and Basidiomyctes. Analysis of
the result with respect to the placement of P450 proteins
in OrthoMCL clusters reveals differences between several
Pezizomycotina and P. chrysosporium. Firstly, for the Pezizomycotina species, there are more P450 proteins that are
not part of an OrthoMCL cluster than there are for P. chrysosporium. The second difference is that P. chrysosporium
P450 proteins are found in far fewer OrthoMCL clusters
than the P450 proteins from the Pezizomycotina species.
This difference is due in part to a few highly duplicated P.
chrysosporium genes. Using the query 'Get annotation for
proteins in a given OrthoMCL cluster' from the group
'Annotation of proteins in clusters', for example, shows
that OrthoMCL cluster ORTHOMCL3134 contains 32
P450 P. chrysosporium paralogues and no proteins from
any other species, while cluster ORTHOMCL190 contains
53 proteins including 14 P. chrysosporium proteins. In
summary, our analysis identifies enormous differences in
the P450omes of different fungal species. It is clear that
budding yeasts and fission yeasts possess much smaller
P450omes than Pezizomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Zygomycetes. More detailed analysis of five fungal species with

large P450omes demonstrates that those of the four Pezizomycotina species appear to possess greater sequence
diversity and less tandem duplication.

Discussion
Queries provided by e-Fungi are focussed on the analysis
of biological or evolutionary phenomena, such as gene
duplication, or expansion and contraction of protein families in related species, rather than on sequence level comparisons of genomes, genes and proteins. Even though the

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:426

clusters, forming the foundation for the majority of analyses provided, are created based on sequence similarity of
proteins, the queries are not limited to retrieval of the
results of those sequence-based analyses, but instead correlate cluster information with additional information,
such as functional annotation, or prediction of protein
sub-cellular localisations or identified Pfam motifs.
A number of data repositories support comparative
genomics analysis, for example, the UCSC Genome
Browser [24,52], NCBI [14], and Ensembl [23,53,54], all
of which integrate a wide variety of genomes from different kingdoms, coliBase/xBase [55,56], Microbase [57],
MolliGen [58] and the Comprehensive Microbial
Resource (CMR) [59], which are data sources dedicated to
bacterial comparative genomics. Furthermore, there is the
Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system [13], integrating a large number of microbial genomes, amongst
them a smaller number of eukaryotes, and Génolevures
[22] which contains 14 hemiascomycetous yeasts. These
data repositories differ with respect to the number and
diversity of genomes they cover, but also in the kinds of
data integrated in addition to sequence data, and the analyses they provide.
Ensembl, NCBI, coliBase/xBase, CMR and Microbase integrate predominantly sequence data and provide comparative analyses based on nucleotide sequence similarities
and orthologous proteins. In addition to sequence data,
Génolevures integrates pathway and Pfam data, CMR also
captures functional annotation and pathways, MolliGen
provides pathway data, and both UCSC and IMG integrate
amongst other data Pfam, functional annotation and
pathway data, all of which have also been integrated into
e-Fungi. However, despite the differences in the number
of genomes and types of additional data integrated, search
facilities tend to be quite similar, and limited to sequence
similarity- or keyword-, identifier- or name-based
searches for retrieval of the stored data. Such search facilities tend to be straightforward and self-explanatory to use,
but less suitable for complex analyses of stored data, than
those provided by e-Fungi.
However, in addition to data retrieval and sequence based
comparisons, NCBI, MolliGen, Génolevures and IMG
provide analyses that are aimed at understanding molecular evolution and are to some extent similar in scope to
analyses provided by e-Fungi. Such analyses include the
study of conservation of proteins between genomes or
groups of genomes, as well as the conservation of pathways. However, these analyses are provided by bespoke
analysis tools that are not part of the general query and
analysis infrastructure, unlike in e-Fungi. Such tools
include TaxPlots provided by the NCBI [14], Phylogenetic
Profiler and Abundance Profiler provided by IMG [13], or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/426

the multi-proteome differential analysis facility provided
by MolliGen [58]. Using bespoke tools for complex analyses is limiting in terms of scalability, as new tools have to
be developed to provide complex analyses of different
kinds. As complex analyses are part of the e-Fungi query
and analysis infrastructure, new queries analysing different kinds of data can easily be added. The e-Fungi database integrates and makes available various of the data
sets that have been used in previous comparative studies
(e.g. [40,42,43]) but that have not typically been central
to genomic databases. With its cluster-based genome
comparison analyses, its integration of a variety of other
kinds of information in addition to sequence and orthologue data, and its complex analysis tasks, e-Fungi moves
away from sequence-based comparative genomics data
sources that can predominantly be accessed by keyword or
gene identifier-based queries.
The e-Fungi database is updated and extended in the form
of themed releases, with 'Sequence' and 'Functional annotation' being the first two releases, and 'Functional
genomics' the next release scheduled for the end of 2007.
Not only are new types of data and new queries added
according to the theme of the release, but also new
genomes are added. For each release, all the derived data,
including clustering and PFAM analysis, is regenerated
and updated.

Conclusion
The e-Fungi database integrates a large number of diverse
fungal genomes and complements the wealth of genomic
data with derived data generated by a range of analyses
performed on the genomic data of all the genomes. The eFungi database is unique in the diversity of data that it
provides for the large number of genomes it integrates. It
is also unique in terms of the extensive canned query
library for the analysis of the stored data it provides. The
canned queries are motivated by recent comparative studies carried out to improve our understanding of evolutionary biology.
