Abstract
Background: Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are major predators in the Arctic marine ecosystem, feeding mainly on
seals, and living closely associated with sea ice. Little is known of their gut microbial ecology and the main
purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial diversity in faeces of polar bears in Svalbard, Norway (74-81°
N, 10-33°E). In addition the level of blaTEM alleles, encoding ampicillin resistance (ampr) were determined. In total,
ten samples were collected from ten individual bears, rectum swabs from five individuals in 2004 and faeces
samples from five individuals in 2006.
Results: A 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed, and all sequences obtained from 161 clones showed
affiliation with the phylum Firmicutes, with 160 sequences identified as Clostridiales and one sequence identified as
unclassified Firmicutes. The majority of the sequences (70%) were affiliated with the genus Clostridium. Aerobic
heterotrophic cell counts on chocolate agar ranged between 5.0 × 104 to 1.6 × 106 colony forming units (cfu)/ml
for the rectum swabs and 4.0 × 103 to 1.0 × 105 cfu/g for the faeces samples. The proportion of ampr bacteria
ranged from 0% to 44%. All of 144 randomly selected ampr isolates tested positive for enzymatic b-lactamase
activity. Three % of the ampr isolates from the rectal samples yielded positive results when screened for the
presence of blaTEM genes by PCR. BlaTEM alleles were also detected by PCR in two out of three total faecal DNA
samples from polar bears.
Conclusion: The bacterial diversity in faeces from polar bears in their natural environment in Svalbard is low
compared to other animal species, with all obtained clones affiliating to Firmicutes. Furthermore, only low levels of
blaTEM alleles were detected in contrast to their increasing prevalence in some clinical and commensal bacterial
populations.

Background
The gastrointestinal microbiota of animals play an
important role in the maintenance of health and modulation of disease. Previously, ecosystems have been characterized using microbiological methods based on
culturing and phenotypic analysis of the isolates. Since
the growth requirements of many bacteria are unknown,
most of the gastrointestinal bacteria remain uncultivated. Molecular studies, avoiding the cultivation bias,
yield more detailed insight into the diversity and characteristics of the intestinal ecosystems. Most cultivation
independent studies have been conducted on the human
gastrointestinal tract, but also animals including pigs,

rats, chicken, termites, zebras, and ruminants such as
reindeer, sheep, cows, and gazelles have been investigated [1-9]. As is the case with the intestinal ecosystems
of many of the carnivore animals, the microbial ecology
of the gastrointestinal tract of the polar bear is unknown
and we know little about the microbial diversity and
dominant species in these animals. The Barents Sea subpopulation of polar bears is located in an area which is
sparsely populated by humans and thereby has little
contact with human activities [10]. This enables us to
study an ecosystem with little human impact.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria are known to originate in
populations located in environments that seem not to
have been exposed to the selective pressure of pharmaceutically produced antibiotics [11]. The b-lactam antibiotics are of the most widely used agents in clinical

and veterinary practice, and resistance to these agents
are commonly observed in clinical settings [12]. Some of
the most common resistance genes are bla genes which
encode b-lactamases that give high level resistance to blactam antibiotics, and within this group, the bla TEM
genes are very important [13,14]. The bla TEM alleles
encode resistance to ampicillin and other b-lactam antibiotics. Even though widespread in clinical settings, only
few studies have determined the distribution of blaTEM
genes in non-clinical environments, included the gastrointestinal tract of free ranging Arctic wild mammals
[15-19]. In this study, we have examined the role of
polar bear gut microbiota as a potential natural reservoir
of the clinically important blaTEM genes.
Polar bears are major predators in the Arctic marine
ecosystem. They are closely associated with sea ice,
which they use as substrate for both hunting and movement [20]. The world population of polar bears is currently believed to be about 20,000-25,000 animals that
can be divided into 19 subpopulations throughout the
circumpolar Arctic [10]. The Barents Sea subpopulation
is one of these, and inhabits the geographic regions of
Svalbard, the Barents Sea and Franz Josef Land. The size
of this subpopulation is estimated to be approximately
2650 individuals [21]. The polar bear has a monogastric
digestive system with a simple and relatively short intestine typical of a carnivorous animal, and with the caecum completely lacking [22]. Polar bears are mostly
carnivorous and feed mainly on seals, although white
whales, narwhals, birds, bird eggs and carrion can be
important food items during times of the year when
seals are less available [23-30]. In Svalbard, polar bear
predation on reindeer on land has also been observed
[23].
To improve our understanding of the intestinal ecosystem of the polar bear we have studied the bacterial
diversity and the prevalence of blaTEM alleles in faeces
of polar bears in Svalbard, Norway (Fig. 1). We here
present the results of the molecular characterization of
the gastrointestinal microbiota of polar bears sampled
through 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing.

measure of diversity, was 1.9, and the coverage was 97%.
The most abundant phylotype contained 42% of the
sequences, and the nearest relative (99.9%) was Clostridium perfringens. Four phylotypes (6% of the sequences)
were novel, showing < 97% similarity to sequences
representing the phylotypes nearest cultivated relative.
Phylotype PBM_a8 contained five sequences and the
nearest cultivated relative (96.6%) was Clostridium bartlettii. The nearest cultivated relative (95.3%) to phylotype PBF_b32 which contained two sequences was
Ruminococcus hansenii. The other two phylotypes
(PBF_b35 and PBM_a2) contained only one sequence
each and the nearest relative belonged to the phylum
Firmicutes (95.1%) and to unclassified bacteria (96.6%),
respectively.
Aerobic heterotrophic cell counts and b-lactamase activity

The aerobic heterotrophic cell counts ranged from 5.0 ×
104 to 1.6 × 106 cfu/ml for the rectum swabs, and from
4.0 × 10 3 to 1.0 × 10 5 cfu/g for the faeces samples
(Table 3 and 4). The coliform counts for the faeces samples ranged from 3.2 × 103 to 8.0 × 104 cfu/g. There was
no growth of ampicillin resistant bacteria in the faeces
samples. For the rectal swabs, the proportion of ampr
bacteria ranged between 3% and 44% (Table 3). A total
of 144 randomly selected ampr isolates cultivated from
rectal swab samples were tested for b-lactamase activity
by the nitrocefin test and all isolates showed b-lactamase activity.
Detection of blaTEM genes in ampr isolates

Results

The absence of PCR inhibitory substances in the DNA
extracted from ampr isolates was tested by running 16S
rRNA gene PCR on extracted DNA from each of 100
single isolates. As much as 98 of the amplifications were
positive, indicating that bacterial DNA is amplifiable in
98% of the samples. Subsequently, 144 amp r isolates
from the rectal samples were screened for the presence
of blaTEM genes with primers designed for the TEM-1
allele and derivatives [15], and 4 of the amp r isolates
were positive. For all four positive isolates, sequencing
of the flanking regions demonstrated the presence of
blaTEM inserted in a Tn3 backbone. The four isolates
were identified as E. coli by ID32 E (bioMérieux, Marcy
l’Etoile, France) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Bacterial diversity

Detection of blaTEM genes in total genomic DNA extracts

Sequences were obtained from 161 clones and none of
the sequences were identified as possible chimeras. All
sequences were affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes,
with 99% of the sequences belonging to the order Clostridiales (Table 1, Fig. 2). The majority of the sequences
(70%) were affiliated to the genus Clostridium. Based on
97% sequence similarity, seventeen phylotypes were
identified (Table 2) within the clone library, with the
Chao1 index estimating the population richness to be
twenty phylotypes. The Shannon-Weaver index, a

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the rectal swab
from polar bear no. 4 (Table 5). The sample was negative for blaTEM PCR and positive when screened for 16S
rRNA genes, confirming the general suitability of DNA
for PCR. Total genomic DNA was also extracted from
faeces from three of the polar bears (no. 6-8, Table 5)
sampled in 2006, and one of the three faecal samples
was negative, while one was positive, and one out of five
DNA extractions from the third sample (bear no. 7) was
positive (Fig. 3).

Discussion
The Barents Sea subpopulation of polar bears has little
contact with human activities [10], and the samples
investigated in this study were collected from the subpopulation in their natural environment in Svalbard, Norway. Fresh faeces were collected from live, sedated bears
and immediately frozen. There is a potential loss of bacteria when samples are stored before cultivation of bacteria. The pure faeces samples were stored at -70°C and
the rectum swabs were stored in 20% glycerol at the
same temperature. Achá et al [31] found that there was
not a great loss of bacterial number and species when

pure faeces samples were stored at -70°C compared to
faeces samples mixed with a cryoprotectant such as glycerol, as long as the samples were not repeatedly thawed
and analysed in shorter intervals. The samples processed
in this study were not repeatedly thawed and analysed
and we expect little loss of bacterial number and species
compared to if the samples were mixed with glycerol
before storing.
The 16S rRNA gene libraries were made from DNA
extracted from faeces, and the samples were pooled
after PCR to ensure that bacterial DNA from all animals
was equally represented. The number of PCR cycles

were reduced to a minimum, as the frequency of formation of chimeric molecules increases by the number of
PCR cycles [32]. We used 30 cycles for the amplification
of the 16S rRNA genes, and did not detect possible chimeras using the Chimera Detection Program. Seventeen
different phylotypes were identified among the 161
sequences analysed (Table 2). The coverage of the combined libraries was 97%, which indicate that we have
detected the majority of the present microbioma in the
faeces. In a study based on faecal microbial communities
of 106 individual mammals representing 60 species from
13 taxonomic orders, including captive bears and pandas, Ley et al [33] observed that host diet and phylogeny
both influence bacterial diversity, which increases from
carnivorous to omnivorous to herbivorous animals. In
captive carnivores between 19 and 75 OTUs were
observed using the 96% similarity criteria, while in herbivore animals up to 223 OTUs were detected. Within

members of the Ursidae family including carnivorous,
herbivorous and omnivorous bears, the number of
OTUs ranged from 14 to 34 which is consistent with
our findings.
Only four of the seventeen phylotypes were < 97%
related to any known cultivated species (Table 2). This
is in contrast to observations made in other studies that
the microbial diversity reflected by cultivation represents
only a minor fraction of the microbial diversity. In a
study of the microbial diversity in reindeer, 92.5% of the
bacterial diversity represented novel taxonomic groupings [7]. A study on the microbial community composition of the intestinal tract of chickens, 85% of the
phylotypes did not have sequence similarity to any cultured species [1], and in the pig gastrointestinal microbiota, 83% of the identified phylotypes were not likely
represented by a known bacterial species [4]. Analysis of
the polar bear faeces in this study showed a homogenous microbial flora dominated by Clostridia class.
These bacteria are well characterized as they are dominant in the human gut and thereby in the interest of
many scientists [34].
All 161 sequences obtained from polar bears were
affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes (Table 1, Fig. 2).
All except one sequence affiliated with the order Clostridiales, and 93% to the family Clostridiaceae. The low
level of diversity observed in the polar bear clone library
is in contrast to the diversity observed in colon content
from another Arctic carnivorous animal belonging to
the same order as polar bears, the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) [35]. Sequences that affiliated with the
phyla Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and

Proteobacteria were identified in the colon content from
the seals. The dominant phylum was the Bacteroides to
which 68% of the sequences were affiliated, while 21%
were affiliated to the Firmicutes [35]. The same molecular methods were used to analyse both the polar bear
and seal samples, indicating that the methods are not
selective towards Firmicutes. Jores et al [36] found Clostridium in 44% of the samples when cultivating faeces
from polar bears in Svalbard. In faeces from a herbivorous mammal, the wild gorilla, 71% of the phylogenetic
lineage was Firmicutes [37]. Ley et al [33] observed that
the microbial faecal bacterial communities from bears
on different diets cluster together, independent of the
diet. However, these observations were made in animals
kept in zoo’s and might not reflect the situation in the
wild. Eight of the 673 sequences (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ
database, NCBI) from polar bear faeces collected in
zoo’s [33] were compared to the sequences obtained in
this study (Fig. 2). The eight zoo polar bear sequences
included in Fig. 2 represent eight out of 100 phylotypes
(analysed by FastgroupII) and contain 59% of the 673
zoo polar bear sequences. Only two of the sequences,
representing 10% of all the sequences, cluster together
with sequences from our study, indicating a difference
between the microbioma in faeces of wild and captive
polar bears.
We investigated the prevalence of bla TEM alleles in
faeces from polar bears with little human impact in
Svalbard, Norway. We have earlier investigated the prevalence of blaTEM alleles in Arctic soils and sediments,
and in colon content of Arctic seals and found low prevalence of the alleles [15,35]. This current cultivation
study of faeces from polar bears did not give any growth
on plates with ampicillin (Table 4). The blaTEM alleles

are likely to be found in coliform bacteria, but the selective growth on MacConkey agar with ampicillin yielded
< 0.3% ampr cfu (Table 4). However, from 3% to 44% of
the isolates from the rectal swabs were phenotypically
ampr. A random selection of ampr isolates all showed blactamase activity, but when tested by blaTEM PCR, only
4 out of 144 isolates were positive. This indicates a low
level of blaTEM alleles. The four isolates were all identified as E. coli, and the blaTEM alleles were inserted in a
Tn3 transposon which is found in a wide variety of bacteria. The presence of blaTEM alleles has previously been
reported in wild animals in Portugal, where they
detected the alleles in E. coli isolated from faeces from
deer, fox, owl, and birds of prey [38]. Others have identified blaTEM in faecal E. coli isolates from pigs, dogs,
and cats [17,39]. The bla TEM PCR on total DNA
extracted was negative for the two rectal swabs, and two
of the three faecal samples were blaTEM PCR positive
(Fig. 3). Previous studies on Arctic soil samples suggest
that the detection limit for total DNA extracted was <
21 bla TEM alleles (pUC18) per PCR sample [15]. The
diversity analysis of polar bear faeces showed a dominance of clostridiales in which there has been no reports
of b-lactamase production. This is consistent with the
low levels of blaTEM alleles detected in the samples.

Conclusions
This study showed that the bacterial diversity in faeces
from polar bears in their natural environment in the
pristine Svalbard area were low, all obtained clones
affiliated to Firmicutes. As with any PCR-based method,
16S rRNA gene clone libraries are biased [40] and the
gastrointestinal microbiota of more polar bears should
be studied to give a more complete picture of the

transport to the laboratory, where they were stored at
-70°C until analysed.

Methods

16S rRNA Clone Library

Sampling

The amount of sampled material was limited due to little faeces in the rectum of the polar bears, and only
three faeces samples gave sufficient DNA yield to make
16S rRNA gene clone libraries. A 16S rRNA gene clone
library was made with DNA extracted from faeces from
bear no. 6, 7 and 8. Total genomic DNA was extracted
using the QIAmp DNA stool kit (Qiagen, Solna, Sweden) according to the protocol provided by the producer, and DNA quantified using a NanoDrop® ND-1000
Spectrophotometer (260 nm) (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, USA). Two parallel 16S rRNA gene PCR
amplifications on DNA from each of the three animals
were performed, using primers 16S-27F and 16S-1494R
(Table 6), in a reaction mixture containing 1× HotStartTaq DNA master mix (Qiagen), 0.3 μM of each primer,
and 20 ng of extracted DNA solution in a final volume
of 50 μl. PCR amplification was initiated by denaturation
at 95°C for 15 min and then 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, with a final extension

Ten samples from ten polar bears were collected on two
occasions. Faeces were sampled from five individuals
March 30th-April 12 th 2004 and from five individuals
March 30th-April 9th 2006 (Table 5). Sampling occurred
on both occasions at the coast or the surrounding sea
ice at Spitsbergen and Nordaustlandet in Svalbard, Norway (Fig. 1). Bears were caught by remote injection of a
dart (Palmer Cap-Chur Equipment) containing the drug
Zoletil® (Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) fired from a helicopter [41]. Animal handling methods were approved by
the National Animal Research Authority (Norwegian
Animal Health Authority, P.O. Box 8147 Dep., N-0033
Oslo, Norway). The sex, reproductive status, and a series
of standardized morphometric measurements were collected from each bear (Table 5). In 2004, the samples
were collected by swabbing rectum and the samples
were kept frozen in LB-broth (Luria Broth, Fluka BioChemica) with 20% glycerol. In 2006, faeces was

randomly selected and recombinant plasmids extracted

DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (260 nm), and sequenced on a 3130
Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA)
using the ABI BigDye Terminator chemistry. The
sequencing primers (Invitrogen) used were M13 forward
primer, M13 reverse primer, and the universal bacterial
16S rRNA primer Bact338, corresponding to nucleotide
position 338-355 of E. coli (Table 6).
Sequence analysis

The 16S rRNA gene sequences were assembled using
the program Lasergene™ Seqman v. 7.1.0. (DNASTAR
Inc.). Putative chimeric sequences were evaluated using
the Chimera Detection Program which is part of the
SimRank 2.7 package available through the Ribosomal
Database Project (RDP) [42]. Sequences generated were
first compared to sequences obtained from the RDP II
(Classifier: Naive Bayesian rRNA Classifier Version 1.0,
November 2003; The nomenclature taxonomy of Garrity
and Lilburn, release 6.0) and then compared to GenBank sequences using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool) [43]. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were
automatically aligned by CLUSTAL-W in the software
package BioEdit (v. 5.0.9) to give a uniform length. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbourjoining method with the Kimura2-parameter correction
model in the software MEGA (v. 4.0) [44]. Statistical significance of branching was verified by bootstrapping [45]
involving construction and analysis of 1000 trees from
the data set in the software MEGA. Sequences were
assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based
on a 97% sequence similarity criterion [46]. Standard
diversity and richness indices, including the ShannonWeaver index [47] (a nonparametric diversity index
combining estimates of richness, i.e. total numbers of
ribotypes) and evenness (relative abundance of each

Page 8 of 10

OTU, indicating diversity) and the Chao1 index [48] (a
nonparametric estimator of the minimum OTU richness) were calculated using the FastGroupII web-based
bioinformatics platform for analyses of 16S rRNA gene
based libraries [49]. The coverage of the clone library
was calculated with the formula [1-(n/N)] [50] where n
is the number of phylotypes (OTUs) represented by one
clone and N is the total number of clones. The
sequence data for the clones have been submitted to the
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database (NCBI) with accession
numbers FJ375772 to FJ375932.
Determination of cultivable, coliform, and ampicillin
resistant counts

Faeces samples were thawed and suspended in saline
immediately before cultivation of aerobic bacteria. For
both rectal swabs and faeces samples, colony forming
units were determined for aerobic heterotrophic cells on
chocolate medium (agar, horse blood, glucose, Vitox SR
090A, Vitox, SR 090H (Oxoid); University hospital,
Tromsø, Norway) and for amp r aerobic heterotrophic
cells on chocolate medium supplemented with 50 mg/l
of ampicillin (Sigma). Coliform cells were determined
for faeces samples on MacConkey medium (Fluka BioChemika), and for ampr coliform cells on MacConkey
medium supplemented with 50 mg/l of ampicillin. All
plates were enumerated after 48 h of incubation at 37°C.
Means and standard deviations (SD) for the cfu’s were
calculated on the basis of nine replicates for each of the
bear samples analysed.
Identification of b-lactamase activity with the nitrocefintest

Extracellular b-lactamase activity was determined by the
nitrocefin test method. A solution (0.5 g/l) of nitrocefin
(chromogenic b-lactamase substrate, Calbiochem, San
Diego, USA) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Ten μl of the solution was added to single
colonies and a colour change from yellow to pink within
30 minutes after application indicated b-lactamase activity.
DNA extraction and test PCR amplification of 16S rRNA
genes

DNA was extracted from randomly chosen colonies by a
boiling lysis method [51]. The general suitability of

DNA for PCR was confirmed with amplification of the
16S rRNA gene, using the primers 16S-27F and 16S1494R (Table 6). The amplification was performed as
explained above, with the following conditions; denaturation at 95°C for 15 min and then 5 cycles of 94°C
for 4 min, 50°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and then
30 cycles of 92°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1
min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
PCR amplification of potential blaTEM genes in ampr
isolates

The amplification of blaTEM alleles in individual bacterial isolates was performed in a reaction mixture containing 1× HotStartTaq DNA master mix (Qiagen), 0.2 μM
of each primer, and 2 μl of the crude DNA solution in a
final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were denatured at 95°C
for 15 min and then subjected to 30 cycles of 94°C for
45 s, 61°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. For all blaTEM PCR analyses, the primers BlaF and BlaR (Table 6) were used to
amplify a product of 828 bp (TEM-1 allele of E. coli)
[15]. The following controls were used: five strains of E.
coli carrying the bla alleles TEM-1, TEM-3, TEM-6,
TEM-9, and TEM-10 as positive controls, and one strain
carrying the SHV-2 allele as negative control. The specificity of the primers were confirmed by ‘in silico’ amplification and by aligning the primer binding region of
approximately 100 sequence polymorphic blaTEM alleles
[15].
Sequencing of 16S rRNA, blaTEM, and blaTEM flanking
regions

The identity of putative ampr positive isolates was determined by sequencing, with primers 16S-27F, 16S-1494R,
and Bact 338 (Table 6), on a 3130 Genetic analyzer
using the ABI BigDye Terminator chemistry. To confirm
the presence of and determine the location of blaTEM in
the DNA extract from ampr isolates, sequencing of the
immediate flanking regions of the blaTEM gene was performed using the sequencing primers TemI3, TemI5a or
TemI5b (Table 6) as described in [15].
