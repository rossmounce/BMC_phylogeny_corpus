Phylogenetic detection of numerous gene
duplications shared by animals, fungi and plants
Xiaofan Zhou1,2,3, Zhenguo Lin1,2,8, Hong Ma1,2,3,4,5,6,7*

Abstract
Background: Gene duplication is considered a major driving force for evolution of genetic novelty, thereby
facilitating functional divergence and organismal diversity, including the process of speciation. Animals, fungi and
plants are major eukaryotic kingdoms and the divergences between them are some of the most significant
evolutionary events. Although gene duplications in each lineage have been studied extensively in various contexts,
the extent of gene duplication prior to the split of plants and animals/fungi is not clear.
Results: Here, we have studied gene duplications in early eukaryotes by phylogenetic relative dating. We have
reconstructed gene families (with one or more orthogroups) with members from both animals/fungi and plants by
using two different clustering strategies. Extensive phylogenetic analyses of the gene families show that, among
nearly 2,600 orthogroups identified, at least 300 of them still retain duplication that occurred before the divergence
of the three kingdoms. We further found evidence that such duplications were also detected in some highly
divergent protists, suggesting that these duplication events occurred in the ancestors of most major extant
eukaryotic groups.
Conclusions: Our phylogenetic analyses show that numerous gene duplications happened at the early stage of
eukaryotic evolution, probably before the separation of known major eukaryotic lineages. We discuss the
implication of our results in the contexts of different models of eukaryotic phylogeny. One possible explanation for
the large number of gene duplication events is one or more large-scale duplications, possibly whole genome or
segmental duplication(s), which provides a genomic basis for the successful radiation of early eukaryotes.

Background
The history of eukaryotic evolution is one of everincreasing diversity and complexity at multiple levels.
The increases in genotypic and phenotypic complexity
are usually associated with expansion of gene families.
For instance, it has been shown that the diversification
of gene families involved in cell differentiation and cellcell communication contributed to the origination of
multicellularity [1]. Other well-known examples are the
MADS-box genes in plants [2] and olfactory receptor
genes in animals [3]. These multigene families are subject to birth-and-death evolution and most new genes
arise by gene duplication [3].
Gene duplication has been a ubiquitous phenomenon
during eukaryotic history and has contributed to evolutionary innovation by generating additional genetic

material for functional divergence and novelty [4]. After
gene duplication, one of the duplicates might be
released from selective pressure and have the potential
to evolve new functions (’neofunctionalization’) [4].
Alternatively, the two duplicates can accumulate different degenerative mutations and each retains a subset of
the ancestral functions (’subfunctionalization’) [5]. In
addition, in certain situations, such subfunctionalization
can lead to the optimization of subdivided ancestral
functions in each duplicate, thus contributing to adaptation [6]. Besides its important role in the evolution of
new gene functions, gene duplication also greatly contributes to the speciation process through the divergent
resolution of duplicated genes in different populations
[7]. Large-scale gene duplication events have been documented in animals and fungi, and are particularly frequent in plants [8-14] and are believed to be associated
with dramatic increases in species diversity, such as the

radiation of vertebrates and the diversification of flowering plants [15,16].
One of the most important evolutionary milestones is
the early diversification of eukaryotes [17]. In the early
1990s, the ‘crown-stem’ model (Figure 1a) of eukaryotic
phylogeny was proposed based on the study of smallsubunit ribosomal RNA sequences [18-20]. This ‘crownstem’ model suggests that plants, animals and fungi
form a crown group in the eukaryotic tree and separated
from each other more recently than some early branching protists. More recently, an alternative view of the
early evolution of eukaryotes has emerged from phylogenomic studies and is increasingly accepted [21]. According to this view, eukaryotes are classified into six
supergroups (Figure 1b): Archaeplastida (includes plants
and green algae), Opisthokonta (includes animals and
fungi) and four other supergroups of protists, including
Excavata, a group of ancient protists that includes members with complex flagella and without functional mitochondria [21-23]. More recent studies further suggest
that the number of supergroups might be more than six
[24,25]. These supergroups would have diverged during
the early phase of eukaryotic evolution, sometimes
described as a ‘Big Bang’ event [17], although the diverging order of these supergroups is difficult to resolve
and different root positions of the eukaryotic tree have
been proposed [26-29]. In a number of scenarios, the
split between Archaeplastida and Opisthokonta is
among the earliest known eukaryotic divergences, before
the divergence of other major protist groups from either
Archaeplastida or Opisthokonta [26,27,29]. Therefore,
the separation of plants from animals/fungi would be
much more ancient than what was suggested by the
‘crown-stem’ model [18-20]. Even if the position of
the root of the eukaryotic tree is between Excavata and
the other supergroups, the split of the lineage with
plants and the lineage with animals/fungi was still before
those of several other protist groups, including Chromalveolata and Amoebozoa.
Previous phylogenetic studies of individual eukaryotic
gene families for transcription regulators, kinesins, and
recombinational proteins all indicate that there were
duplication events before the split of animals and plants,
suggestive of abundant gene duplication during early
eukaryotic evolution [30-35]. This notion is also supported by a comparative genomic study, in which the
established COG (prokaryotic clusters of orthologous
groups) and KOG (eukaryotic clusters of orthologous
groups) databases were used to reconstruct gene clusters
and to analyze their phylogenies [36]. It was found that
the inferred number of genes in the last eukaryotic common ancestor is 1.92-fold higher than in the first eukaryotic common ancestor, leading to the conclusion that
early eukaryotes had significantly more gene duplication

than prokaryotes during similar periods [36]. However, a
systematic investigation of the extent of gene duplication prior to the split of plants and animals/fungi is still
lacking. Here, we present extensive phylogenetic analyses of gene families and our results supporting the
hypothesis that many of these families had experienced
at least one duplication event before the divergence of
the three major eukaryotic kingdoms.

Results
Reconstruction of gene clusters with the Markov
Clustering Algorithm method

To identify gene duplication in early eukaryotic evolution, we reconstructed gene families from representative
eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The three multicellular eukaryotic kingdoms, plants, animals and fungi,
belong to two of the six major eukaryotic supergroups
(plants in Archaeplastida; animals and fungi both in
Opisthokonta) [21]. According to the ‘six supergroups’
model of eukaryotic phylogeny (Figure 1b) and other
recent phylogenies, the separation of plants and animals/fungi could have been as early as the separation of
any major groups of extant eukaryotes. Hence, gene
duplications prior to the split of plants and animals/
fungi can be placed at an early stage of eukaryotic
evolution.
In this study, we included three representatives of
Archaeplastida (the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the moss Physcomitrella patens and the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), three animals (Homo
sapiens, the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes and the sea
urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and two fungi
(the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe), which all have
nearly complete genome sequences (Table S1 in Additional file 1). According to a widely accepted model for
the eukaryotic origin, the ancestral eukaryotic cell was
derived from an Archaea-like organism, with additional
genes originated from the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium-like cell, which evolved into the mitochondrion
[37]. Therefore, we included genes from three bacteria
(Escherichia coli, Rickettsia prowazekii and Bacillus subtilis) and three archaea (Methanosarcina acetivorans,
Sulfolobus solfataricus and Pyrobaculum aerophilum) as
outgroups (Table S1 in Additional file 1).
The predicted protein sequences from all these 14 species were clustered using the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL; see Methods), which is among the most
popular clustering methods and has been shown to be
reliable [38]. By using a relatively low clustering stringency, 222,436 annotated protein sequences from the 14
representative species were divided into 51,396 gene clusters in total. Among these, 1,394 clusters contained both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes and 41,444 clusters

were eukaryote-specific. In addition, 794 out of the 1,394
clusters and 2,276 out of the 41,444 clusters contained
genes from both Archaeplastida and Opisthokonta. The
numbers of clusters of other phyletic patterns are summarized in Table S2 in Additional file 1.
Analysis I - MCL clusters with both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic genes

On the basis of the 794 clusters with genes from Archaeplastida, Opisthokonta, and prokaryotes, we retained only
the clusters that had at least three eukaryotic genes, with
at least one from Archaeplastida and at least one from
Opisthokonta, as this is the minimum requirement for the
deduction of a possible early eukaryotic duplication prior
to the divergence of these two lineages. Also, to ensure the
quality of these clusters, we tested the clusters by searching for one or more common domains in all members and
subsequently removed sequences, if any, that lacked the
most common domain(s) from each cluster. As a result,
we obtained 772 gene clusters that meet these criteria and
used them for phylogenetic analyses (Additional file 2).
The phylogeny for each cluster was estimated by the
neighbor-joining (NJ) method with bootstrap (BS) test and
the maximum-likelihood (ML) method with BS and
approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) (see Methods).
The resulting tree topologies were then examined. Most
gene families known to have experienced duplication in
early eukaryotes were successfully recovered by our analysis (Table S3 in Additional file 1). Since our clusters were
established based on sequence similarity instead of strict
orthology, the eukaryotic genes in one cluster might be
derived from more than one prokaryotic ancestor. To best
distinguish the duplication in early eukaryotes from paralogy before the prokaryote-eukaryote separation, we identified orthogroups in each tree; each orthogroup consisted
of eukaryotic genes that, most likely, originated from the
same gene in the first eukaryotic common ancestor.
According to the tree topology (Figure 1c), we defined an
orthogroup as a eukaryotic clade that meets both of the
following criteria: it has members from both plants and
animals/fungi; and it has a prokaryotic outgroup (designated as type I orthogroups; for example, clades 1 and 2 in
Figure 1c) or being a sister to another orthogroup that has
a prokaryotic outgroup (designated as type II orthogroups;
for example, clades 3 and 4 in Figure 1d). According to
these criteria, we identified about 700 orthogroups. In
each orthogroup, an ancient duplication event was
inferred to be prior to the divergence of plants and animals/fungi if the tree topology of the orthogroup had two
or more eukaryotic clades of which at least one clade consisted of members from both plants and animals/fungi.
According to this definition, more than 35% (BS support ≥
50%) or 20% (BS support ≥ 70%) of the 700 orthogroups
showed one or more ancient duplication events (Table 1).

Furthermore, the aLRT test of ML phylogenies produced
even higher percentages of orthogroups with an early
eukaryotic gene duplication at support levels of both 50%
and 70% (Table 1).
We reasoned that some of the gene duplications identified
might be caused by long-branch attraction (LBA) artifacts
in phylogenetic reconstruction. For example, in an
orthogroup with the phyletic pattern of ((plants, animals,
fission yeast) (budding yeast)), it was possible that the fission yeast gene evolved rapidly and was placed at the basal
position due to LBA. In this case, a duplication event
would be inferred based on the incorrect topology. Therefore, to minimize the impact of LBA, we used a more
stringent criterion for the identification of gene duplication before the divergence of plants and animals/fungi: at
least one gene from at least one species must be present in
each of two paralogous clades. Based on this conservative
criterion, we still found about 25% (BS ≥ 50%) or 15% (BS
≥ 70%) of the orthogroups to have experienced an early
eukaryotic duplication (Table 1, entries in bold). Also, the
ML-aLRT test showed that more than 30% of orthogroups
(at support levels of both 50% and 70%) have experienced
an early eukaryotic duplication (Table 1, entries in bold).
This stringent criterion was also used in analyses II and III
(see below). Moreover, we arbitrarily selected a subset of
the orthogroups with topologies that were vulnerable to
LBA, and added sequences from additional species to
further test the impact of LBA. The results showed that
phylogenies of most of the orthogroups tested (15 out of
21) still supported early eukaryotic duplication (Table S4
in Additional file 1). Especially, all six orthogroups that
initially showed duplication at a support level of 70% still
supported early eukaryotic duplication after adding more
sequences. These results suggest that our phylogenetic
topologies are quite reliable.
To learn about the fate of the ancient duplicates, we
also examined whether specific duplicates were retained
or lost, and found that different orthogroups varied in

their patterns of retention of duplicates. One possible
fate was that both of the duplicates were retained in
plants and animals/fungi (Figure 2a), abbreviated here as
(RO)(RO) (R, Archaeplastida; O, Opisthokonta). Among
all the orthogroups that showed early eukaryotic duplication, about 35% displayed this pattern (Table 2). Alternatively, one of the duplicates could be lost in either
plants or animals/fungi, abbreviated here as (RO)(R) and
(RO)(O), respectively (Figure 2b, c). These two topologies were less frequent than (RO)(RO) (Table 2). Similar
results were obtained with different phylogenetic methods and at different levels of support. A small number
of remaining orthogroups had more complex patterns
(Table 2, ‘Other’ column), possibly due to multiple
rounds of duplication and gene loss. The detailed distribution of phyletic patterns is summarized in Table S5 in
Additional file 1.
In the context of the ‘six supergroups’ model of eukaryotic evolution (Figure 1b), the gene duplications we identified were very ancient events as they happened before the
separation of Archaeplastida and Opisthokonta. This split
possibly represents the most ancient eukaryotic divergence
among extant groups. However, the ‘crown-stem’ model
(Figure 1a) suggests that the plants-animals/fungi split is
relatively recent in comparison to several ‘early branching’
protists, such as members of Excavata and Chromalveolata. To further place the duplications we identified, we
added sequences from representative ‘early branching’
protists (Excavata: Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major; Chromalveolata: Plasmodium falciparum and Phaeodactylum
tricornutum; Amoebazoa: Dictyostelium discoideum and
Entamoeba histolytica) to orthogroups with duplication
(identified by the ML method at a BS ≥ 70% support
level). Additional protists (for example, Chromalveolata:
Tetrahymena thermophila, Paramecium tetraurelia and
Toxoplasma gondii) were searched if no homolog could be
found in the previous group of representative species. We

eukaryotic genomes in our study, we examined gene
clusters that contained only eukaryotic genes. Among
the 41,444 eukaryote-specific gene clusters (Table S2 in
Additional file 1), 2,276 clusters contain members from
both plants and animals/fungi, suggesting that they are
likely descendants of ancestral genes in the early eukaryotes. Therefore, the phylogenies of these clusters could
also provide evidence for early eukaryotic duplication.
Due to the lack of prokaryotic outgroups, it was difficult
to determine the root for the phylogeny of a eukaryotespecific cluster. However, a duplication event could still
be unambiguously inferred if a bipartition could be
found in the tree in which both portions had sequences
from plants and animals/fungi (see Figure 1d for an
illustration). This means that the cluster should have at
least two sequences from each of the plant and animal/
fungal lineages. After filtering out sequences that lack
common domains, 1,903 clusters met this criterion and
were further investigated by phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 2). The results show that, even at a support
level of 70%, more than 10% of the clusters exhibit evidence of duplication before the separation of plants and
animals/fungi (Table 3).

found that most (84 out of 111) of the orthogroups had
protist sequences in at least one of the paralogous clades
(see Figure 3, for example; see Additional file 2 for details).
Among the remaining 27 orthogroups, 19 orthogroups
had no resolution, 2 orthogroups had no detectable protist
homologs and only 6 orthogroups supported a different
phylogeny that placed the duplication after the divergence
of early protists from animals/plants. These results
strongly suggest that most of these duplications were
indeed very ancient events, regardless of which eukaryotic
phylogenetic model (’crown-stem’ or ‘six supergroups’)
was used.
Analysis II - MCL clusters with eukaryotic genes only

Because analysis I required that each cluster contain
some prokaryotic gene(s), the total number of gene clusters was limited. To more widely represent the

To further strengthen our investigation of ancient
eukaryotic gene duplication, we wanted to test an independent dataset of gene clusters to evaluate the reliability of the results. We used an existing dataset of gene
clusters with both eukaryotic and prokaryotic members
that was established with a different methodology from
that of our analysis I [36]; this is our analysis III. In
their study, Makarova et al. [36] used established databases [39] of prokaryotic clusters of orthologous groups
(COGs) and their eukaryotic counterparts (KOGs) to
construct KOG-to-COG clusters. A COG was defined
by best hits from BLAST analyses with members from
at least three relatively distant prokaryotes among a
total of 63 species included in the study [39]. Similarly,
a KOG contains best hits from at least three eukaryotic
species from a group of seven in the earlier study [39];
the total number of eukaryotes was increased to 11 subsequently [36]. The authors used RPS-BLAST search to
find the best COG hit for each KOG and all the KOGs
that have the same COG best-hit were assigned to one
cluster [36]. In total, they identified 1,092 KOG-to-COG
clusters (each with one COG), which covered 2,445
KOGs [36] (Additional file 2).
Since the KOG database does not include some of the
representative species used in analysis I, we first
assigned the predicted protein sequences from Physcomitrella, Chlamydomonas, Takifugu and Strongylocentrotus to KOGs. Then, we extracted the sequences of the
14 representative species from each KOG-to-COG

a result, 89 out of the 1,092 KOG-to-COG clusters were

70% support level) was higher, the percentages of
orthogroups with early eukaryotic duplication we
observed were similar to those from analysis I. Much
higher percentages (more than 40%) of orthogroups
with an early eukaryotic duplication were suggested by
the ML-aLRT test at support levels of both 50% and
70% (Table 4). The distribution of orthogroups with different phyletic patterns was also similar to analysis I
(Table 2; Table S6 in Additional file 1).

Many gene families have experienced duplication during
the evolution of plants or animals, and gene copy can
either remain similar or differ dramatically between
organisms [30,31,33,40,41], possibly related to functional
evolution. To further investigate the properties of
families in our studies that showed detectable gene
duplication before the animal-plant split, versus the
families that did not have such duplications, we plotted

the gene copy number of each family in human versus
that in Arabidopsis and calculated the Spearman’s correlation coefficients (Figure 4). We found that among the
families that had a prokaryotic outgroup, those that
exhibited the early eukaryotic duplication showed a
positive correlation of gene copy number between
human and Arabidopsis (Figure 4a), whereas the families
that did not have detectable early duplication had a
much less positive correlation between human and Arabidopsis (Figure 4b). The difference between the two
correlation coefficients was significant (P-value < 0.01),
according to the permutation test. Similarly, for the
families that did not have a prokaryotic outgroup, the
families with an early duplication showed a significantly
stronger positive correlation than the families without
the duplication (Figure 4c, d).

Discussion
Detection of very ancient eukaryotic gene duplications

In this study, we investigated the extent of eukaryotic
gene duplication before the divergence of plants and
animals/fungi by constructing gene clusters with members from representative prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and performing comprehensive phylogenetic
analyses.
As we sampled only a small number of species from
each lineage, additional cluster analyses were performed

by adding genes from zebrafish (teleost fish), medaka
(teleost fish), Drosophila melanogaster (insect) or the
giant clam Lottia gigantean (mollusc), respectively (see
Additional file 3 for complete clustering results). We
found that adding genes from each of the additional
species resulted in very slight changes in gene cluster
numbers (Table S7 in Additional file 1). Therefore, we
believe that our overall results would not be dramatically affected by inclusion of the additional animal
species.
Our analysis I was based on the gene clusters delineated by the MCL method, and revealed that about
25% (BS ≥ 50%) or 15% (BS ≥ 70%) of orthogroups had
experienced ancient gene duplication. Higher numbers
and percentages of orthogroups that showed ancient
gene duplication were reported by the ML-aLRT test
(also in analyses II and III), possibly because the bootstrap test is consistently conservative [42]. It is known
that, in comparative genomics studies like the ones we
performed here, the accuracy of gene family clustering
has a great impact on the reliability of subsequent analyses such as phylogenetic reconstruction. Therefore, it
is of interest to check whether alternative strategies of
gene family clustering would lead to similar results as
the MCL approach used in analysis I. COG and its
eukaryotic equivalent, KOG, are among the most widely
used databases of orthologous gene clusters. In our

analysis III, we took the KOG-to-COG clusters identified by Makarova et al. [36] and analyzed them using
the same procedures as used in analysis I. In comparison to analysis I, in analysis III we obtained a very similar percentage of orthogroups showing early eukaryotic
duplication, although the total number of orthogroups
identified was higher. Interestingly, however, we found
that less than half of the orthogroups with duplication
overlap between the two analyses. The differences were
mainly due to two reasons: first, the prokaryotic members in a particular MCL cluster were not in any COG
or the corresponding COG were not in any KOG-toCOG cluster; second, a KOG-to-COG cluster may
include sequences of very limited similarity, resulting in
a phylogeny different from that of the corresponding
MCL cluster. Nonetheless, the fact that different gene
family clustering methods (MCL and COG/KOG) and
phylogenetic approaches (NJ and ML) all revealed similar percentages of orthogroups that had experienced
early eukaryotic duplication still supports the reliability
of our results.
One possible bias in our analysis I is that only the
eukaryotic genes with detectable prokaryotic homologs

were studied. This means that we focused on relatively
conserved genes. In consideration of the antiquity of the
gene duplication events we are interested in, some
eukaryotic genes might lack detectable homologs in the
prokaryotes in our study due to gene loss or sequence
divergence and thus were not included in our analysis I.
For this reason, we also carried out analysis II to analyze
the eukaryote-specific MCL gene clusters and found that
more than 10% of the 1,903 gene clusters showed early
eukaryotic duplication. It is possible that this figure is
still an underestimation since some of the ancient duplicates might fail to be clustered together due to a high
degree of divergence and would appear as separate gene
clusters without early eukaryotic duplication.
Our phylogenetic analyses identified approximately
300 (BS support ≥ 70%) or approximately 500 (aLRT
support ≥ 70%) gene duplications in the time window
from the origin of eukaryotes to the plants-animals/
fungi split. However, the estimation of the length of this
time window varies depending on which eukaryotic phylogeny is adopted. According to the ‘crown-stem’ model
of eukaryotic phylogeny (Figure 1a), plants and animals/
fungi are members of a crown group and several groups

Zhou et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R38
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R38

of protists form deep branches in the tree [18,19]. It was
estimated that plants and animals/fungi separated
approximately 1,600 million years ago (MYA), and Giardia, which was considered the deepest branch in the
eukaryotic tree of life, diverged approximately 2,300
MYA [43]. Given the estimated origin of eukaryotes at
approximately 2,700 MYA [44], the duplication events
identified in our study could have taken place during
the long time period before the separation of plants and
animals/fungi (approximately 1,100 million years). A
contrasting picture is depicted by the more recent ‘six
supergroups’ classification of eukaryotes (Figure 1b)
[21-23].
In this model and other related models, both the ‘unikont-bikont’ topology [26,27] and the recent ‘photosynthetic-nonphotosynthetic’ bipartition [29] suggest that the
Archaeplastida-Opisthokonta separation might represent
the first major split, or at least one of the early splits, in
eukaryotic evolution (Figure 1b). In this perspective, the
duplication events we identified could be placed during a
very early stage of eukaryotic evolution, prior to the divergence of most of the major extant protist groups.
Regardless of whether the ‘crown-stem’ model, or ‘six
supergroups’ and other similar models are correct, we
investigated gene duplications among a wider representation of eukaryotes using phylogenetic analyses with
additional sequences from exemplars of divergent
major protist groups, Excavata, Amoebozoa, and Chromalveolata (Figure 1b). For most of the gene families
with 70% BS support, the duplication likely occurred
prior to the separation of these highly divergent protists from plants and/or animals/fungi. Even according
to the ‘crown-stem’ model of early eukaryotic history,
these divergent protists separated from plants/animals/
fungi at an earlier time. Therefore, irrespective of the
models of early eukaryotic phylogeny, these duplications would be placed before any known major eukaryotic divergence. Therefore, our results support many
gene duplication events during very early eukaryotic
evolution.
Functional implication for early eukaryotic evolution

The gene duplications we detected likely generated raw
materials for functional evolution, as proposed before
[4]. Indeed, the duplicates from the 300 or more gene
duplications we identified would most likely be eliminated if they did not provide selective advantage. Therefore, these early eukaryotic gene duplications could have
been of great importance for the success and radiation
of early eukaryotes, and thus have been retained in the
last common ancestor of extant major eukaryotic
groups. If the duplicated gene families are involved in
processes that are fundamental to early eukaryotes,
which are likely to be also shared by extant eukaryotes,

Page 9 of 13

they might show similar evolutionary patterns in different eukaryotic kingdoms. Specifically, copy numbers for
genes with highly conserved functions seem to be more
stable than the number of genes with more divergent
functions (compare RAD51, MSH, and SMC with JmjC
and MADS-box genes) [30,31,33-35].
In fact, we observed a more positive correlation of
gene family size between animals and plants in the
families with early eukaryotic duplication than in the
families without such duplication (Figure 4). In other
words, the families with the early eukaryotic duplication
tend to have more similar evolutionary patterns in both
plants and animals/fungi than those families without the
early duplication, suggesting that these genes might
have relatively conserved functions among the three
major kingdoms. This idea of functional conservation is
also supported by the finding that the (RO)(RO) pattern,
in which both duplicates are retained in both the plants
and animal/fungi lineages, is the most frequent pattern
among all possible patterns.
Also, it is of interest to know whether genes with specific biochemical or molecular functions or involved in
specific processes are enriched among the families with
duplication. Interestingly, our Gene Ontology (GO) analysis did not reveal any GO terms significantly enriched
among the orthogroups with duplication (data not
shown). This might suggest that the detected gene
duplications, which we propose could have benefited the
early eukaryotic ancestor and the ancestors of both the
plant and animal/fungi lineages, affected many types of
functions and processes, not just a few specialized
classes of functions.
A hypothesis for early eukaryotic large-scale duplication

Gene duplication can be generated by several mechanisms, including tandem duplication, transposition and
large-scale duplication (for example, segmental/whole
genome duplication (WGD)). In principle, the 300 or
more gene duplications we identified could be independent events resulting from tandem duplication and
transposition. However, in the absence of supporting
evidence, such a complex pattern of multiple independent events is not parsimonious. Alternatively, the duplications could be explained by one or a few large-scale
duplications. Large-scale duplication, like WGD, is of
special interest because it allows the generation of multiple new functional modules with many genes that are
unrelated at the sequence level [45], which would not
be likely by other duplication mechanisms. Also, segmental duplications (SDs) are increasingly recognized as
frequent phenomena, especially in primate genomes for example, approximately 5% of the human genome
consists of duplicated segments [46]. Therefore, SDs
with sufficiently large numbers of genes could also

Zhou et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R38
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R38

account for the gene duplications we detected. After
WGD/SDs, the different fates of duplicated genes in different populations could generate the genetic diversity
that then allows both reproductive isolation/speciation
and environmental adaptation [47,48].
The large number of ancient eukaryotic duplication
events that we have detected here could have been the
result of one or more early eukaryotic large-scale
duplications. For relatively recent large-scale duplication events, it is possible to identify syntenic genomic
regions [49]. For example, such syntenic regions were
found for the most recent WGD in Arabidopsis, poplar
and yeast, which likely occurred approximately 100
MYA or more recently [10-12,50]. However, for older
ones such as the WGDs in vertebrate (1R/2R; approximately 525 to 875 MYA [51]), synteny is no longer
detectable due to numerous genome rearrangements
and gene loss [52]. If a large-scale duplication was the
cause of the ancient gene duplication events identified
in this study, this event would have occurred at least
1,600 MYA (possibly even earlier), making it exceedingly unlikely that any synteny can still be detected.
Another approach to the detection of large-scale duplication is to analyze the rate of synonymous base substitutions (dS) between paralogous genes, as reported
for many plant species [53,54]. Unfortunately, this
method is also not feasible for events older than
approximately 150 million years because of the saturation of dS values.
An alternative way to obtain evidence for large-scale
duplication is to examine the phylogeny of a large
number of gene families, as we have done here. Our
results indicate that a significant fraction of the
orthogroups in our dataset had experienced duplication before the divergence of the three major eukaryotic kingdoms. By combining the results of analyses I
and II, we estimated that the percentage of
orthogroups showing duplication before the separation
of plants and animals/fungi is over 15% (BS ≥ 50%
support level) and 10% (BS ≥ 70% support level), or
about 30% (aLRT support ≥ 50%) and 20% (aLRT support ≥ 70%). Similar large-scale phylogenetic analyses
showed that, among the duplicate pairs resulting from
more recent WGD in vertebrates (1R/2R; approximately 525 to 875 MYA) and yeast (approximately 100
MYA), 26.6% and 20.1% of the pairs survived, respectively [51,55]. The early eukaryotic duplications we studied were much more ancient than the previously
reported large-scale duplications in animals, plants and
yeast. Thus, during the at least 1,600 million years of
evolution, the duplicate pairs that arose in early eukaryotes might have had a higher chance to be lost or to
be too divergent to be recognized. Therefore, it is

Page 10 of 13

reasonable to expect that a lower percentage of the
duplicate pairs would survive, and our phylogenetic
results could support the hypothesis that the duplication events identified here are the remnants of a largescale duplication (for example, WGD or SDs) in early
eukaryotes. In other words, considering the antiquity
of the early eukaryotic duplications, the 300 or more
duplications we detected probably represent only a
small fraction of the real number of duplications in
early eukaryotes, which could be in the thousands. Our
results could be most parsimoniously interpreted by
one or more large-scale duplications, which were likely
to be WGD/SDs, rather than thousands of independent
duplications.

Conclusions
In this study, we conducted extensive phylogenetic analyses to investigate the extent of gene duplication in early
eukaryotic evolution. We have found at least 300
orthogroups that had likely experienced an ancient eukaryotic duplication event prior to the divergence of the
major eukaryotic supergroups. Our results provide a better
understanding of early eukaryotic evolution in several
ways. The identification of numerous ancient eukaryotic
gene duplication events suggests that gene duplication
played an important role in the evolution of early eukaryotes. The large number of duplicated genes might have
allowed large-scale evolution of new gene functions,
increasing the chance of greater species diversity in changing environments. In particular, the shared duplications
in plants and animals/fungi might have contributed to the
three independent origins of multicellularity in these
lineages. Furthermore, these ancient duplications could be
most simply explained by a hypothesized early eukaryotic
WGD/SDs. We further postulate that this/these WGD/
SDs might have contributed to the early eukaryotic radiation. Therefore, like the early vertebrate and angiosperm
diversifications, the hypothesized WGD/SDs could provide
an explanation at the level of genome evolution for the
high rate of speciation near the origin of the three major
eukaryotic lineages.
Materials and methods
Reconstruction of gene clusters

For analyses I and II, the predicted protein sequences of
the 14 representative species were retrieved from public
databases (see Table S1 in Additional file 1 for the complete list of data sources). These protein sequences were
compared using an all-to-all BLASTP search with a cutoff of 1e -10 [56]. Based on the BLASTP results, MCL
clustering was performed with low stringency (inflation
value of 1.5) to produce gene clusters [38]. To check the
clusters for common domains, the domain architectures

Zhou et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R38
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R38

of all cluster members were annotated using InterProScan v4.5 (InterPro release 22.0, including both integrated
and un-integrated) [57].
For analysis III, we started from the 1,092 KOG-toCOG clusters identified in the study of Makarova et al.
[36]. Since the original KOG database does not cover
the genomes of Physcomitrella, Chlamydomonas, Takifugu and Strongylocentrotus, the predicted protein
sequences from these four species were assigned to
KOGs using BLASTP search. Then the sequences from
the 14 representative prokaryotic and eukaryotic species were extracted from each KOG-to-COG cluster to
form the dataset for the following phylogenetic
analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis

For all the MCL gene clusters and KOG-to-COG clusters, highly similar sequences (more than 80% identity)
from the same species were removed by using BLASTCLUST [56]. Multiple sequence alignments were generated by using MUSCLE 3.6 [58]. The multiple
sequence alignments were trimmed by removing
poorly aligned regions using trimAl 1.2 with the automated1 option [59]. NJ trees were constructed using
PHYLIP 3.68 (JTT model) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates [60,61]. ML trees were constructed using RAxML
7.2.0 (LG model plus gamma correction) with 100
bootstrap replicates [62,63]. The best-scoring ML trees
were also evaluated with the aLRT method by using
Phyml 3.0 [64,65]. For large clusters with more than
100 sequences, representative sequences were selected
based on a preliminary NJ tree. Phylogenetic trees
were screened by custom scripts to identify
orthogroups and duplication events. All scripts in this
study, gene clusters and phylogenetic trees are available upon request.
Gene Ontology analysis

Orthogroups with early eukaryotic duplication were compared with orthogroups that did not have such duplications for overrepresented GO terms [66]. Domains
encoded by the majority of orthogroup members were
considered representatives for the orthogroup. Then GO
annotations of representative InterPro domains were
assigned to each orthogroup using InterPro2GO mapping
[67]. Subsequently, all GO annotations were mapped to
GO slims, a cut-down version of GO, using the map2slim
perl script and generic GO slim version 1.2 [67]. The overrepresentation of GO slims was examined using Ontologizer 2.0 [68] with term-for-term analysis and Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing.
