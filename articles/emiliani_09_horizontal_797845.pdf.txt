Abstract
Background: The pioneering ancestor of land plants that conquered terrestrial habitats around
500 million years ago had to face dramatic stresses including UV radiation, desiccation, and
microbial attack. This drove a number of adaptations, among which the emergence of the
phenylpropanoid pathway was crucial, leading to essential compounds such as flavonoids and lignin.
However, the origin of this specific land plant secondary metabolism has not been clarified.
Results: We have performed an extensive analysis of the taxonomic distribution and phylogeny of
Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL), which catalyses the first and essential step of the general
phenylpropanoid pathway, leading from phenylalanine to p-Coumaric acid and p-Coumaroyl-CoA,
the entry points of the flavonoids and lignin routes. We obtained robust evidence that the ancestor
of land plants acquired a PAL via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) during symbioses with soil bacteria
and fungi that are known to have established very early during the first steps of land colonization.
This horizontally acquired PAL represented then the basis for further development of the
phenylpropanoid pathway and plant radiation on terrestrial environments.
Conclusion: Our results highlight a possible crucial role of HGT from soil bacteria in the path
leading to land colonization by plants and their subsequent evolution. The few functional
characterizations of sediment/soil bacterial PAL (production of secondary metabolites with
powerful antimicrobial activity or production of pigments) suggest that the initial advantage of this
horizontally acquired PAL in the ancestor of land plants might have been either defense against an
already developed microbial community and/or protection against UV.

Background
The appearance of land plants was a key step towards the
development of modern terrestrial ecosystems. Fossil data

indicate that the first land plants appeared around 500
million years ago, from a pioneer green algal ancestor
probably related to Charales [1,2].

Early terrestrial environments were harsh. The ancestor of
land plants that conquered emerged lands had to face
important stresses including desiccation, UV radiation
(not anymore shielded by water), as well as attack by
already diversified microbial soil communities [1,3]. This
drove a number of key adaptations, including the emergence of specialized secondary metabolic pathways.
Among them, the phenylpropanoid pathway was crucial.
It is in fact a ubiquitous and specific trait of land plants,
and provides vital compounds such as lignin -essential for
vascularization (xylem) and stem rigidity out of water-,
and flavonoids -essential for reproductive biology (flower
and fruit colors), protection against UV (pigments) and
microbial attack (phytoalexins), and plant-microbe inter-

action (flavonoids) [4,5]. Three steps constituting the general phenylpropanoid pathway provide the precursors for
the flavonoid and lignin branches (Figure 1). Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) transforms phenylalanine
into trans-cinnamic acid, which leads to p-coumaric acid
by the action of cinnamic acid 4-hydrolase (CH4), which
is then transformed into p-coumaroyl-CoA by p-coumaroyl:CoA ligase (4CL) (Figure 1). Either p-coumaric
acid and p-coumaroyl-CoA can enter the lignin monomer
pathway, while p-coumaroyl-CoA is the precursor of the
flavonoid pathway (Figure 1). Lignin monomer and flavonoid biosynthesis then involve complex highly branched
pathways (Figure 1)[4,6].

The initial physiological advantage of phenolic compounds is not clear. In fact, flavonoids are not thought to
have been immediately effective as UV protection before
the emergence of complex structures allowing for their
accumulation in large quantities, and it has been proposed that they were initially used as internal signaling
molecules [7]. Lignin-like polymers have been identified
in the cell walls of the charalean alga Nitella and in bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), early branching lineages of land plants that do not harbor a developed
vascular system such as that found in Tracheophytes
(Ferns, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms) [8]. Because
these lignin monomers in non vascular plants do not fulfill structural functions it has been proposed that may
principally serve as a defense mechanism against microorganisms or UV radiation [8]. To date, there is no evidence
for the presence of a full phenylpropanoid metabolism in
organisms other than land plants, although some bacteria
and fungi harbor homologues of a few enzymes of the
pathway [9,10].
The phenylpropanoid pathway likely evolved progressively in land plants by the recruitment of enzymes from
the primary metabolism (for a recent review see 4). However, the origin of PAL was a key event, since it provided
the initial step from which the rest of the pathway was
assembled. Indeed, PAL is a key regulator of the phenylpropanoid pathway [11] and any inhibition of PAL blocks
the whole pathway. Probably due to its essentiality, land
plants harbor multiple copies of PAL [5] and no complete
null mutant is available in the literature. De novo synthesis of PAL is induced in response to different stress stimuli
such as UV irradiation, pathogenic attack, low levels of
nitrogen, phosphate, or iron [6]. Although PAL enzymes
have been extensively characterized in all land plants lineages, including the early emerging bryophytes (mosses,
liverworts, and hornworts), their distribution in other
organisms is limited. PAL are known to be present in
fungi, in particular Basidiomicetes yeasts such as Rhodotorula, but also Ascomycetes such as Aspergillus and Neurospora, where they participate to the catabolism of
phenylalanine as a source of carbon and nitrogen [12-14].
The PAL of some plants and fungi also harbor a tyrosine
ammonia lyase (TAL) activity that is responsible for the
synthesis of p-coumaric acid directly from tyrosine, which
in turn leads to the production of p-coumaroyl-CoA [4]
(Figure 1). PAL enzymes have been functionally characterized from a few sediment/soil bacteria such as Streptomyces
maritimus (Actinobacteria), where PAL is required to supply cinnamic acid for the production of benzoyl-CoA, the
starter molecule for the biosynthesis of the bacteriostatic
agent enterocin [15], and Photorhabdus luminescens (γ-Proteobacteria), where PAL is essential for the production of
the powerful stilbene antibiotic through yet unknown

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/7

intermediate steps [16,17]. More recently, PAL have also
been identified and structurally characterized in two
Cyanobacteria belonging to the order Nostocales, where
they are involved in a pathway whose end product is yet
unknown [18]. From functional studies, it has been proposed that these cyanobacterial PAL might represent an
evolutionary intermediate towards plants PAL [18]. PAL
homologues with TAL activity have also been identified in
some bacteria such as the Actinobacterium Saccharotrix
espanaensis, where they are used to produce the antibiotic
saccharomicin [19], and in purple phototrophic a-Proteobacteria such as Rhodobacter, where they are involved in
the synthesis of the chromophore of their photoactive yellow protein photoreceptor [20].
PAL is homologous to histidine ammonia lyase (HAL),
which is involved in the catabolism of histidine and is
widespread in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [21,22]. It has
been proposed that "PAL developed from HAL when
fungi and plants diverged from the other kingdoms" [4].
However, the current view of eukaryotic evolution based
on phylogenetic analyses indicates that fungi and plants
do not share an exclusive ancestor [23,24]. In fact, Fungi
are more related to Animals than to land plants. Moreover, land plants belong to the phylum Plantae, which also
includes Glaucocystophytes, red algae, and green algae
[23,24].
Given the clear importance of PAL in the emergence of the
phenylpropanoid pathway and adaptation of plants to
land, we sought to get more insight into the origin of this
enzyme by carrying out an extensive search of PAL/TAL/
HAL homologues in current sequence databases and by
analyzing their phylogeny.

Results
Based on preliminary exhaustive phylogenetic analyses,
160 representative sequences were chosen for final tree
construction (i.e. a selection of bacterial homologues
including all characterized PAL and their closest homologues, all archaeal homologues, a selection of plant and
fungi homologues, and all homologues for the remaining
eukaryotic phyla, see Methods for details. These sequences
are very well conserved and allowed the selection of 369
unambiguously aligned amino acid positions for analysis.
The resulting unrooted bayesian tree is shown in Figure 2
(see Additional file 1 and 2 also). The prokaryotic part of
the tree is not congruent with species phylogeny, indicating extensive gene duplications, losses, and horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) within bacteria as well as between
bacteria and archaea, which makes it difficult to retrace
the evolutionary history of PAL/TAL/HAL enzymes in
prokaryotes. The few characterized bacterial PAL and TAL
are not monophyletic (Figure 2, indicated in red and light
blue font, respectively), although their close relatives may

Phylogeny of PAL/TAL/HAL. Unrooted bayesian tree of a representative sampling of PAL/TAL/HAL homologues. Characterized bacterial PALs are shown in red font, while characterized bacterial TALs are shown in blue font. Although it is difficult
to decide where the root lies, it is clear that eukaryotic HAL (blue square) and fungi/land plants PAL (orange and green
squares, respectively) have distinct origins. Moreover, taxonomic distribution of HAL and PAL orthologues indicates that the
ancestor of eukaryotes harbored a HAL (blue arrow) while a PAL was introduced by HGT in the ancestor of Dikarya fungi
(orange arrow) and the ancestor of land plants (green arrow). The source of this HGT is likely in a group of sediment/soil bacteria including characterized cyanobacterial PAL and uncharacterized sequences from Methylobacterium sp. and Herpetosiphon
aurantiacus (red square). Probable HAL orthologues of Methylobacterium sp. and Herpetosiphon aurantiacus are indicated by red
asterisks. The amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum appear to have acquired a PAL in the course of a recent HGT from soil
bacteria (pink arrow). Numbers at nodes represent posterior probabilities (for clarity only PP relevant for discussion are indicated). The scale bar represents the average number of substitutions per site. The same tree with full accession numbers and

also be PAL or TAL and it would be interesting to characterize them.
Eukaryotic sequences form two distinct well-supported
monophyletic clusters, one including characterized HAL
(Figure 2, light blue rectangle, posterior probability PP =
1.00) and the other including characterized PAL (Figure 2,
green and orange rectangles, PP = 0.99), separated from
each other by bacterial/archaeal homologues. This clearly
indicates that eukaryotic PAL and HAL have distinct evolutionary origins, since otherwise eukaryotic PAL should
arise from within eukaryotic HAL. HAL homologues are
not present in all complete eukaryotic genomes, indicating that catabolism of histidine is not an essential function. However, the cluster of eukaryotic HAL orthologues
includes members of major phyla [23,24] such as Alveolates (Paramecium tetraurelia, Perkinsus marinus), Amoebozoa (Dictyostelium discoideum), Haptophytes (Emiliania
huxleyi), Heterokonts (Aureococcus anophagefferens, Phytophtora soyae), Excavates (Naegleria, Trypanosoma cruzi),
and Metazoans (Figure 2). This strongly suggests that a
HAL was present in the most recent eukaryotic ancestor
and the absence of HAL orthologues in some eukaryotic
lineages has to be interpreted as a consequence of gene
loss. For example, we found no HAL orthologues in any of
the fungal lineages for which complete genome sequence
data is currently available (i.e. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which form the Dikarya [25]), although we
retrieved a orthologue in the EST database at NCBI from
Blastocladiella emersonii, which belongs to the early emerging aquatic lineage Chytridiomycota [25]. This suggests
that a HAL orthologue may have been present in the
ancestor of Fungi and was secondary lost in Dikarya, but
needs confirmation when complete genome sequences
will be available from Chytridiomycota and other early
emerging fungal lineages. We found no HAL orthologues
in any member of the phylum Plantae for which complete
genome data is available (i.e. the red algae Cyanidioschyzon
merolae, the green algae Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus,
and the Angiosperms Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana)

[23,24], indicating an early gene loss in this phylum.
Intriguingly, D. discoideum harbors two additional homologues: one is very divergent and could not be included in
the analysis, while the other lies outside of the eukaryotic
HAL cluster and close to the characterized PAL of P. luminescens (Figure 2, indicated by a pink arrow) and may represent a recent acquisition by HGT. It would be interesting
to investigate the role of this putative PAL homologue in
Dictyostelium, in particular to verify whether it also has an
antimicrobial defense role in this soil-dwelling eukaryote,
which has been recently suggested to harbor a rudimentary immune system [26].
In contrast to the wide distribution of eukaryotic HAL
orthologues, the eukaryotic PAL cluster contains exclusively orthologues from plants and fungi but no other
eukaryotic lineage, and these form two well-supported
monophyletic sister groups (Figure 2, green and orange
rectangles PP = 0.99 and 1.00, respectively). However, the
plant PAL cluster includes only members from land plants
(including all early emerging lineages such as mosses,
hornworts, and liverworts [1,2]), but we found no orthologues in available genomic data from the red and green
algae lineages, which branch prior to the divergence of
land plants within the phylum Plantae [23,24]. The
monophyly of plants PAL orthologues strongly indicates
that they have a single origin and derive from a gene that
was already present in the ancestor of land plants [27]
(Figure 2). Concerning Fungi, the PAL cluster contains the
few characterized fungal enzymes (Amanita, Rhodotorula,
Aspergillus) and is thus likely that the other orthologues
have also PAL activity, although more functional data is
needed to verify this. We found PAL orthologues in all
complete genomes that are currently available (i.e. exclusively from Dikarya), to the exception of the late emerging
lineages Saccharomycotina, Schizosaccharomycetes, and
Cryptococcus [25], indicating secondary gene losses. We
found no PAL orthologues in available genomic data of
the fungal lineages Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota,
which branch prior to the divergence of Dikarya in the

phylogeny of the phylum Fungi [25]. This may indicate
absence of a PAL coding gene in these lineages, although
this needs to be verified when complete genome data
becomes available. The monophyly of the fungal PAL
orthologues strongly indicates that they have a single origin and derive from a gene that was already present at least
in the ancestor of Dikarya (Figure 2), and possibly earlier.
The evolutionary relatedness of PAL orthologues from
land plants and fungi clearly indicates a common origin.
However, the phylum Plantae does not share an exclusive

ancestor with Fungi [23,24], i.e. the most recent common
ancestor of these two eukaryotic lineages corresponds the
most recent common ancestor of all eukaryotes (Figure 3).
Consequently, if a PAL orthologue was present in the
ancestor of all eukaryotes, it would have been subsequently lost in all eukaryotic lineages to the exception of
land plants and fungi (Figure 3a). A more parsimonious
scenario is one where a PAL originated either in the ancestor of land plants or in the ancestor of at least Dikarya
fungi and then was transferred via HGT between these two
phyla (Figure 3b, dotted arrows). Although the prokaryo-

recent eukaryotic ancestor, based on its presence in all major eukaryotic supergroups for which sequence data is available
(indicated by an asterisk), and it was lost in the ancestor of Dikarya Fungi and in the ancestor of the phylum Plantae (orange
crosses). In contrast, the origin of eukaryotic PAL is more recent: (1) origin of PAL in a bacterium (green circle), (2) HGT to

tic part of the tree is blurred by HGT, it is intriguing that a
group of bacterial homologues including the two characterized cyanobacterial PAL [18] is robustly supported as
sister of the land plants/fungi PAL cluster (PP = 0.99, Figure 2). Again, the heterogeneity of this bacterial group testifies for HGT between its members. In fact, it includes
two distantly related sediment/soil bacteria, Herpetosiphon
aurantiacus (Chloroflexi), and Methylobacterium sp. (αProteobacteria), a facultative methylotrophic pink pigmented relative of Rhizobiales [28,29]. These uncharacterized homologues may also be PAL since these bacteria
harbor a second homologue that may be a bona fide HAL
(indicated by a * symbol in Figure 2).

Discussion
During early colonization of emerged environments by
pioneer land plant ancestors, beneficial associations with
fungi and soil bacteria were likely crucial. In particular, it
is known that N2 fixing cyanobacteria formed symbioses
with early fungal lineages (lichen-like or endocytobiotic
symbioses, such as those between the glomeromycotan
Geosiphon pyriformis and the cyanobacterium Nostoc [30])
as well as with land plants, and that fungi (Glomeromycota) started arbuscular-mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses
with the first land plants [30-34].
The peculiar distribution and phylogeny of plant PAL suggests a plausible scenario for its origin: PAL emerged in
bacteria (Figure 3(i)), likely with an antimicrobial role; a
member of an early fungal lineage (i.e. at least before the
divergence of Dikarya) obtained a PAL via HGT from a
bacterium (possibly a Nostocale or another soil/sediment
bacterium through an early symbiosis [30]) (Figure 3(ii));
this fungal PAL was transferred to an ancestor of land
plants via an ancient AM symbiosis (Figure 3(iii)), where
it paved the way for the development of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and the radiation of plants on terrestrial
environments. The fact that land plants PAL do not appear
to arise from within fungi PAL (Figure 2) can be explained
by the fact that the donor was the ancestor of Dikarya, or
by the fact that the donor belonged to a lineage predating
the divergence of Dikarya and we either still lack complete
genome sequence data from it or the lineage has gone
extinct. Important insights to test this evolutionary scenario will be obtained by the future availability of
genomic data from early emerging fungal lineages such as
Glomeromycota, that possibly emerged before land
plants [30] and were most likely the first fungi to form AM
type symbioses with them [30,31].
We cannot exclude a priori a transfer in a different direction, i.e. from a soil bacterium to an ancestor of land
plants via an ancient symbiosis (Figure 3(ii a)), then from
this to an ancestor of Dikarya fungi (or an earlier branching lineage for which sequence data is not yet available)

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/7

via an ancient AM symbiosis (Figure 3(iii a)). Nevertheless, we wish to stress that land plants PAL are unlikely to
be of chloroplastic origin. In fact, since chloroplasts in the
phylum Plantae derive from a single primary cyanobacterial endosymbiosis, if land plant PAL had been inherited
from the cyanobacterial ancestor of the chloroplast this
would imply at least two independent losses of PAL in red
and green algal lineages, which postdate the acquisition of
the primary chloroplast but emerged prior to the divergence of land plants (Figure 3) [1,2,23,24]. Moreover,
only 3 out of the 36 currently available complete cyanobacterial genomes harbor a PAL/HAL homologue (i.e.
only Gloeobacter in addition to the two Nostocales). PAL is
a cytoplasmic enzyme and is not targeted to the chloroplast (we tried to assess the probability of plastid targeting
of PAL using the predictions software Predotar V1.03 [35],
obtaining no significant results (data non shown). The
ancestor of the phylum Plantae likely preceded the ancestor of land plants of many millions of years. If a PAL was
transferred by Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer from the
cyanobacterial symbiont to the host nucleus in the ancestor of the phylum Plantae, it is not clear why it would have
been lost multiple times independently in 2–3 algal lineages, indicating a lack of selective advantage, while being
maintained only in the algal line leading to land plants up
to around 500 million years ago. Finally, it is possible that
the ancestor of land plants and the ancestor of fungi independently acquired their PAL from two different but
related bacteria. Importantly, since the gene coding for
HAL appears to have been lost early in the phylum Plantae, the phenylpropanoid pathway in land plants could
not have been emerged without the acquisition of a PAL
homologue by HGT.

Conclusion
The origin of land plants was a key event in the history of
life on our planet since it played a fundamental role in the
evolution of modern terrestrial ecosystems. The contribution of bacteria to eukaryotic innovations is considered
important, but remains poorly explored. Our results highlight the crucial role of HGT from soil bacteria in the
emergence of key metabolic pathways such as that of phenylpropanoids, and therefore in the path leading to land
colonization by plants and their subsequent evolution.
Since it is likely that the phenylpropanoid pathway took
some time to be fully assembled, it is intriguing to speculate about the original selective advantage to keep a horizontally acquired PAL in the first land plants. The direct
products of PAL are cinnamate and p-coumarate. These
might have been used as an antimicrobial, such as in
some bacteria, and would have played a fundamental role
as protection from attack by an already developed microbial soil community. Alternatively (or in combination
with an antimicrobial role), they might have provided

Biology Direct 2009, 4:7

protection against UV radiation, for example being the
precursor of a light capturing pigment such as in modern
purple bacteria. Moreover, cinnamate and p-coumarate
are the precursors of benzoic acid and salicylic acid, which
are known defense compounds [36,37] Finally, it is
known that coumarins have appetite suppressing properties, suggesting that an initial role for PAL may have been
to provide defense against grazing animals.
It would be interesting to know if fungi also use PAL for
these purposes, and what are the corresponding mechanisms for UV shielding and antimicrobial defense in the
green algae that are known to colonize soil habitats. To
answer these questions, it will be important to investigate
further the distribution of PAL enzymes in both bacteria
and fungi, which may be more widespread than currently
thought, as well as their role in still largely unexplored secondary metabolisms.

Methods
Exhaustive Blast searches were carried out by using different HAL and PAL sequences as seeds on the non-redundant sequence database and on the EST database at NCBI
[38], on ongoing eukaryotic genomes at the DOE Joint
Genome Institute [39], at the Broad Institute [40], and at
the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project web service
[41].
Based on exhaustive preliminary phylogenetic analyses,
160 representative taxa were chosen for final tree construction. From the global alignment, 369 unambiguously aligned amino acid positions were selected for
analysis. Tree reconstruction was performed using the
bayesian method implemented in MrBayes [42] with a
mixed model of amino acid substitution and a gamma
correction (eight discrete categories plus a proportion of
invariant sites) to take into account among-site rate variations. MrBayes was run with four chains for 1 million generations and trees were sampled every 100 generations. To
construct the consensus tree, the first 1500 trees were discarded as "burnin.". Maximum likelihood analysis of the
same dataset was carried out by using Phyml [43], with a
WAG model of amino acid substitution, including a
gamma law with 4 categories to take into account differences in evolutionary rates at sites, and an estimated proportion of invariable sites.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Purificación López-García
This article presents an extensive molecular phylogenetic
analysis of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, many of
which also use tyrosine as substrate), the enzyme catalyzing the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway leading,
in plants and some fungi, to the synthesis of flavonoid
secondary metabolites and lignin monomers. The study
includes also the related enzyme histidine ammonia lyase
(HAL), widespread in the three domains of life. Since land
plants and dikaryotic fungi PAL form two sister monophyletic clades clearly distinct from eukaryotic HAL and
from their prokaryotic homologues, it is proposed that
PAL was transferred horizontally from bacteria to land
plants or to fungi and, subsequently, from land plants to
fungi or viceversa. This is an interesting observation, well
supported by the phylogenetic analysis presented, that
leads the authors to hypothesize a key role of this enzyme
for the adaptation of plants to land.

I have two major comments. First, the hypothesis that a
horizontal gene transfer of PAL to the land plant ancestor
is at the origin of the phenylpropanoid metabolism and of
their adaptation to terrestrial ecosystems is appealing.
However, a single enzyme does not make a pathway and,
in the absence of data about the remaining genes involved
in phenylpropanoid metabolism, this idea remains hypothetical. In this sense, the title of the article appears too
conclusive (A horizontal gene transfer at the origin of phenylpropanoid metabolism: a key adaptation of plants to land).
Have the authors tried to make preliminary phylogenetic
analyses for other genes in the pathway or, at least, do they
have an idea about their phylogenetic distribution? It
would be interesting to compare the distribution of
enzymes involved in flavonoid and lignin monomer biosynthesis with that of PAL.
AU: We clarified the text to explain that the whole pathway is
a specificity of land plants, although a few bacteria and fungi
harbor homologues of some enzymes of the pathway. The assembly of the pathway in land plants likely occurred stepwise by the
recruitment of preexisting enzymes from other metabolic routes.
Although it will be surely interesting to investigate further how
this occurred, we now stress in a more clear way that we
addressed specifically the very origin of the pathway, which
could not have occurred without the acquisition of PAL, since
this enzyme performs the first and essential step. Moreover, we
precise that such HGT of PAL was essential, since a HAL homologue was likely lost early in the phylum Plantae and therefore

land plants could not have assembled the pathway by recruiting
a preexisting HAL. Even if the other genes of the pathway were
also acquired by HGT, this would have occurred either simultaneously or after the acquisition of PAL. For this reason, our title
appears to us justified.
Nevertheless, we have performed preliminary analysis of the
two enzymes following PAL in the general phenylpropanoid
pathway (C4H and 4CL) and these are large gene families that
do not appear to show a pattern similar to PAL, supporting the
idea that they were recruited from preexisting pathways and
strengthening the importance of the HGT of PAL.
My second comment relates to the primary selective
advantage attributed to the acquisition of PAL from bacteria, which might have been the production of antimicrobial or pigmented metabolites that would allow the
successful competition of land plants/fungi in soils or
protection against UV light. Again, the idea is attractive
but, to prove it, would require as a preliminary step to
show that the whole flavonoid biosynthesis pathway
emerged prior to that of lignin monomer biosynthesis.
If the latter appeared first, one could propose instead that
the advantage of acquiring this pathway was to increase
stiffness and developing the ability to construct rigid
structures, an essential property of land plants and some
stages of many fungal life cycles. Perhaps the authors can
consider this possibility or discuss why they think it is
unlikely. In addition, green algae, which also colonize soil
surfaces, have also to compete with other members of the
microbial community and to protect themselves from UV.
They might have preferred to keep their own, non PALderived, protective systems against microbes and UV light.
AU: We now clarify in the text that early branching land plant
lineages harbor the first enzymes of the two main branches of
the pathway leading to lignin monomers and flavonoids. Unfortunately, the unavailability of genomic data from earlier lineages (e.g. Charales) prevents understanding for the time being
which of the two branches emerged first. We now discuss briefly
the production of lignin-like monomers in non-vascular early
emerging land plants where these are likely used as defense
against either UV or microorganism attack. To our knowledge
fungi consume lignin but do not produce it, they construct rigid
structures by using chitin.
We speculate that the initial selective advantage of PAL that
would have lead to the fixation of the HGT may have had to do
with the use of its direct products, cinnamic acid and p-coumarate, both involved in antimicrobial or anti UV functions in
bacteria and possibly fungi. Moreover, cinnamate and p-coumarate are the precursors of benzoic acid and salicylic acid,
which are known defense compounds.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/7

The remark on green algae colonizing soil habitats is very interesting. We now discuss it in the text.
Alternatively, the authors might wish to consider the possibility that flavonoid synthesis did not confer a particular
efficient protection against microorganisms, but against
metazoan grazers, which constitute indeed the major
threat for land plants.
AU: interesting point, although we do not address specifically
the origin of flavonoid production (see above), coumarins have
appetite suppressing properties, suggesting its widespread occurrence in plants, especially grasses, is because of its effect of
reducing the impact of grazing animals. Thus an immediate
advantage of PAL (TAL) might have also been defense against
grazers. We now mention it in the text.
Reviewer's report 2
Eugene Koonin
This straightforward phylogenetic study of Phenylalanine
Ammonia Lyase (PAL), the first committed enzyme of the
phenylpropanoid pathway, reveals the monophyly of
PALs from land plants and dikaryal fungi, with this
eukaryotic branch embedded with a highly diverse bacterial tree. The interpretation of this result favored by the
authors is that the ancestor of dikaryal fungi acquired the
PAL gene from a soil bacterium and passed the gene to the
ancestor of land plants. This conclusion implies a key role
of HGT in the land colonization by plants.

I think this study highlights both the huge advantages and
the considerable headaches that are associated with having numerous genome sequences from all walks of life.
The conclusion made by the authors is, of course, interesting and plausible but it is by no means the only one that
is possible to make from the tree shown in Figure 2. The
main problem, as with most scenarios that involve HGT,
is that we do not know the relative likelihoods of HGT
and gene loss (but we do know that gene loss in many
eukaryotic lineages was extensive). Therefore, arguments
for HGT are doomed to remain mostly qualitative and
often less than conclusive. With this in mind, potential
alternative scenarios for PAL include (but are not necessarily limited to): i) presence in the last common ancestor
of the extant eukaryotes with subsequent loss in all lineages (with sequenced genomes) except for land plants and
dikaryal fungi; the authors briefly discuss this possibility
and dismiss it as unlikely, and generally, one tends to
agree (the number of required losses is quite large) but
just how unlikely this possibility is, is still hard to tell;
AU It is indeed hard to tell, but we think that one HGT is a
much more parsimonious scenario than massive independent
losses in all eukaryotes apart from land plants and fungi. We
now explain it more clearly in the text.

ii) HGT from the chloroplast to the common ancestor of
all Plantae, with subsequent loss in algae, followed by
HGT to dikaryal fungi; in the manuscript, this scenario is
also dismissed as a highly unlikely one but, in this case, I
am not sure I agree as the bacterial sister group of the
eukaryotic PALs does include some cyanobacteria, and a
loss of the gene in 2–3 algal lineages is not unlikely;
AU: at least two reasons make us think that this scenario is
unlikely:
First, even if Nostoc is considered the extant cyanobacterium
most similar to the first photosynthetic endosymbiont, only
three cyanobacteria over 36 complete genomes harbor PAL/
HAL homologues. No chloroplastic genomes harbor a PAL nor
a HAL homologue. Furthermore, PAL is a cytoplasmic enzyme
and is not targeted to the chloroplast (we tried to assess the
probability of plastid targeting of PAL using the predictions software Predotar V1.03, obtaining a not significant result).
Second, the ancestor of the phylum Plantae likely preceded the
ancestor of land plants of many millions of years. If a PAL was
transferred by Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer from the cyanobacterial symbiont to the host nucleus in the ancestor of the phylum
Plantae, it is not clear why it would have been lost multiple
times independently in 2–3 algal lineages, indicating a lack of
selective advantage, whereas it would have been maintained
only in the algal line leading to land plants up to around 500
million years ago.
We therefore think that a pal EGT from the cyanobacterial
endosymbiont to the host nucleus, although it cannot be
excluded a priori, is not a scenario more supported than the one
that we propose.
iii) independent HGTs from related (soil) bacterial to
plants and fungi – a possibility that is not discussed in the
manuscript but that, as far as I see, cannot be ruled out.
AU: We included this possibility in the text.
The above alternatives to the authors' conclusion do not
invalidate the work but it must be admitted that, e.g., the
chloroplast scenario is less surprising than the one presented by the authors, so much so that the advisability of
dedicating a special papers to the origin of PAL in plants
and fungi could be questioned. My disappointment with
the manuscript is that the authors do not investigate the
phylogeny of other enzymes of the phenylpropanoid
pathway. Had this been done and had a coherent pattern
been discovered, the conclusions could be much more
convincing and exciting. If, on the other hand, such a
coherent pattern does not exist, this also would be notable
indicating that, like many other systems, this key pathway
is a patchwork of genes of different origins. I understand,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/7

of course, that such a complete phylogenetic analysis
requires a considerable amount of extra work, so the
authors might prefer to highlight the PAL analysis separately, but I still think that a more comprehensive paper
will be of greater value.
AU: As we explained in our answer to referee 1, we now clarified better in the text that in this report we wished to focus on
the very first step in the origin of the pathway that was key to
its further assembly. How the pathway was then assembled is
surely an interesting question but we feel not directly relevant
to our hypothesis. Since without the acquisition of PAL the
pathway could not have been be assembled, in particular
because of the absence of a preexisting HAL homologue from
which a PAL may have been derived, we reckon that our analysis is not incomplete.
Indeed, as the referee points out, it would be more exciting not
seeing the same pattern for the other genes, and this is what
appears from preliminary analysis (see answer to referee 1).
At a more technical level, I think that it is highly desirable
to also include result from a maximum likelihood analysis to buttress those obtained with the superoptimistic
MrBayes. With just one family to analyze, this will not
take too much effort.
AU: this analysis was in fact already done and gave very similar
results and statistical support, we now mention it in the text and
included the tree as supplementary material 2.
Reviewer's report 3
Janet Siefert
It's a beginning insight into land plant colonization. I
think that other reviewers might have some issues with
the argument being based on this one enzyme. I have to
admit I did wonder myself about other key enzymes in the
phenylpropanoid pathway. I think to help your cause in
this regard, you should make a definition of what you
mean by the 'first committed step' when you are speaking
of the PAL enzyme. The team does a reasonably good job
of speculating why the ancestor to land plants might have
acquired this gene and it's beneficial use. In figure 2... you
need a little bit more information on the methodology for
this tree.. it is of course drawn as if it is rooted, is it? This
time element to this tree that helps to support your argument presented, is stronger if it is.

AU: the referee is right, we added some clarifying comments in
the legend to figure 2.
