Abstract
Background: All viruses in the family Bunyaviridae possess a tripartite genome, consisting of a small, a medium, and a large RNA
segment. Bunyaviruses therefore possess considerable evolutionary potential, attributable to both intramolecular changes and
to genome segment reassortment. Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are known to cause human hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The primary reservoir host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer
mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which is widely distributed in North America. We investigated the prevalence of intramolecular
changes and of genomic reassortment among Sin Nombre viruses detected in deer mice in three western states.
Methods: Portions of the Sin Nombre virus small (S) and medium (M) RNA segments were amplified by RT-PCR from kidney,
lung, liver and spleen of seropositive peromyscine rodents, principally deer mice, collected in Colorado, New Mexico and
Montana from 1995 to 2007. Both a 142 nucleotide (nt) amplicon of the M segment, encoding a portion of the G2
transmembrane glycoprotein, and a 751 nt amplicon of the S segment, encoding part of the nucleocapsid protein, were cloned
and sequenced from 19 deer mice and from one brush mouse (P. boylii), S RNA but not M RNA from one deer mouse, and M
RNA but not S RNA from another deer mouse.
Results: Two of 20 viruses were found to be reassortants. Within virus sequences from different rodents, the average rate of
synonymous substitutions among all pair-wise comparisons (πs) was 0.378 in the M segment and 0.312 in the S segment
sequences. The replacement substitution rate (πa) was 7.0 × 10-4 in the M segment and 17.3 × 10-4 in the S segment sequences.
The low πa relative to πs suggests strong purifying selection and this was confirmed by a Fu and Li analysis. The absolute rate of
molecular evolution of the M segment was 6.76 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year. The absolute age of the M segment tree was
estimated to be 37 years. In the S segment the rate of molecular evolution was 1.93 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year and the
absolute age of the tree was 106 years. Assuming that mice were infected with a single Sin Nombre virus genotype, phylogenetic
analyses revealed that 10% (2/20) of viruses were reassortants, similar to the 14% (6/43) found in a previous report.
Conclusion: Age estimates from both segments suggest that Sin Nombre virus has evolved within the past 37–106 years. The
rates of evolutionary changes reported here suggest that Sin Nombre virus M and S segment reassortment occurs frequently in
nature.

Background
When Sin Nombre virus (SNV; family Bunyaviridae, genus
Hantavirus), the causative agent of the then newly recognized hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans, was
discovered in 1993 in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona, the next step in understanding the links in the chain
of transmission was to determine its natural history [1].
All other hantaviruses recognized to that time had been
shown to be associated with wild rodents and therefore
efforts were focused on rodents. It was soon shown that
the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, is the reservoir
host of this virus [2] and has since been shown that each
hantavirus is associated with rodents or insectivores of
single or a scant few species in long-term, perhaps co-evolutionary, relationships [3].
Subsequent investigations of genotypes of North American hantaviruses, principally of SNV, have indicated or
suggested that, virus lineages occur in relative, if discontinuous geographic isolation and may yet be monophyletic, irrespective of geographic distribution. This has
been attributed to rodent host genetics [3]. In addition,
viral phylogeographic differences may be correlated with
deer mouse phylogeographic differences [4] and a variety
of complex interactions may lead to genetic diversity of
both the rodent hosts and the viruses [5].
As with all viruses assigned to the Bunyaviridae, hantaviral
genomes comprise three RNA segments: a large (L) RNA,
a medium (M) RNA, and a small (S) RNA. The L RNA
encodes the polymerase gene, the M RNA encodes a precursor polyprotein for the two virion glycoproteins Gn
and Gc and a nonstructural protein NSm, and the S RNA
encodes the nucleocapsid protein. Dual infections of cells
with closely related hantaviruses can yield reassortant
viruses (a mixture of RNA genome segments of the two
viruses) and reassortant viruses have potential epidemiologic implications [6,7].
Reassortants of SNV have been identified from field-collected deer mice and from dually infected cells in vitro [810]. The authors of those reports suggested that reassortment with heterologous hantaviruses does not occur at all
or is rare but that segment reassortment in SNV-infected
deer mice might occur fairly regularly.
Such complexities and opportunities suggested to us that
it would be of value to analyze the RNAs of SNV from deer
mice in areas of select western U.S. states (Colorado, New
Mexico and Montana) characterized by similar and different habitat types. We expected that the results of such evaluations would provide insight to the geographic
distribution, movement, and evolution of this virus. The
studies reported here demonstrate that SNV reassortment

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/102

occurs frequently and that it occurs at a high rate for both
the small and medium RNA segments.

Results
We sequenced portions of both the S and M segments of
SNV RNA samples collected from deer mice at six locations in Colorado, two locations in New Mexico and one
location in Montana (Table 1 and Figure 1). PCR products
were obtained for both M and S segments of SNV RNAs of
20 peromyscine rodents. These were then cloned and
sequenced; a minimum of three clones per sample were
sequenced to derive a consensus. Consensus sequences
for the 142 nt portion of the G2 transmembrane glycoprotein and the 751 nt region of the nucleocapsid protein are
shown in Figure 2. Polymorphic sites are underlined. The
predicted amino acid sequence appears above each
codon. Replacement substitutions are highlighted in gray.
Phylogenetic analysis
The 142 nt amplicon region of the M segment encoded a
47 codon portion of the G2 transmembrane glycoprotein
and was sampled from 21 mice. An additional 55
sequences of the same region of the M segment were
added from GenBank to provide a geographic and temporal context for our sequences. Table 2 lists the model and
parameters estimated in Modeltest 3.7 used to derive the
phylogeny shown in Figure 3. This is the rooted, Maximum Likelihood (ML), time-based phylogeny inferred
using a strict molecular clock in BEAST 1.4 [11] for the M
segment. There were 37 parsimony informative sites in the
M segment and consequently the bootstrap support for
the various clades was low. The two clades labeled with
light grey circles correspond to the SNV-type clades 1 and
2 proposed by Rowe et al. [12] from SNV collections from
Nevada and California. Pm11 from Montana is basal to
SNV-type Clade 1, whereas Pm19 is basal to SNV-type
Clade 2. However, the remainder of our sequences arose
on the clade labeled 3, as did most of the published
sequences that have been collected from Arizona and New
Mexico.

The 751 nt region of the S segment encoded 250 codons
of the highly conserved nucleocapsid protein and was
sampled from 21 mice. This region of the S segment has
not been as widely used as has the M segment in prior
studies so that only six additional sequences from the literature were available. Table 2 lists the model and parameters estimated in Modeltest 3.7 used to derive the
phylogeny shown in Figure 4. This is the rooted, ML, timebased phylogeny inferred using a strict molecular clock
with BEAST 1.4 for the S segment. There were 211 parsimony informative sites, and bootstrap support for the various clades was high. The two clades indicated with light
grey circles are well supported. Clade 1 contains 13 of our
S segment sequences and all previously published S seg-

ment sequences from New Mexico. The "Four Corners
hantavirus" (Sin Nombre virus) sequence reported by
Hjelle et al. 1994 [13] is basal to Clade 1. Clade 2 is a new
clade containing exclusively Colorado sequences. Interestingly, basal to Clade 2 is the SNV sequence from a deer
mouse captured at Convict Creek, California [14].
Clades from both segments were examined with respect to
geographic origin of the samples. Viruses from at least two
different clades were co-circulating in Fort Lewis deer mice
and the same was true in deer mice from Nathrop, CO and
Navajo NM.

Rates and patterns of molecular evolution
The M segment dataset was analyzed with all 78 sequences
shown in Figure 3 (Table 1). The absolute rate of molecular evolution of the M segment was 6.76 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year. The absolute age of the M segment tree
was estimated to be 37 years; a time scale in years appears
at the bottom of Figure 3. In the S segment, the rate of
molecular evolution was 1.93 × 10-3 substitutions/site/
year and the absolute age of the tree was 106 years (Figure
4). The substitution rates (π, πs, πa) in the two segments
were similar (Table 3). The estimated ages of either segment suggest that SNV arose recently, within the past 37–
106 years.

Linkage disequilibrium
Figure 5 is a heat diagram in which small disequilibrium
coefficients are represented by white or yellow and large
disequilibrium coefficients are represented by orange or
red. The matrix is read according to the nucleotide position of segregating sites displayed along the diagonal. For
example in Figure 5, the square connecting sites 19 and 96
is orange (and placed in a box); this corresponds to an r2
of 0.596 and these sites are in significant linkage disequilibrium. The boxes linking sites 33 with 60 or 69 with 111
are also orange indicating that these sites are also in disequilibrium with one another. In contrast, squares linking
site 2 with all other sites are white or light yellow and
these sites are in equilibrium with site 2. The majority of
boxes in Figure 5 are light, suggesting that most segregating sites in the M segment exist in equilibrium. This probably occurs because mutations at segregating sites in this
region of the M segment occur independently of one
another.

Analysis of the S segment indicates many orange and red
boxes suggesting a high rate of disequilibrium distributed
throughout the S segment sequence (Figure 6). These patterns suggest that our sampling of only a 142 nt portion of
the M segment may not provide an accurate sample of
evolutionary rates and patterns in the whole M segment.
Many sites in the S segment are in disequilibrium and our
coverage of this segment thus appears adequate.

Test of neutrality
The uniformly high synonymous substitution rate (πs) in
the M and S segments shown in Table 3 suggests a very
high nucleotide substitution rate but a very low rate of
amino acid substitutions. This pattern is consistent with
strong purifying selection. To test this pattern further, the
F* statistic [15] was calculated to test for selective neutrality. Figure 7 shows that the overall F* statistic for the M
segment is negative and that the regions that are significant in the 3' region are negative as well. The overall F*
statistic for the S segment is a smaller negative number but
only a small region is significant. Recalling that F* > 0
under balancing selection, F* ≈ 0 with neutral substitutions and F* < 0 under purifying selection, Figure 7 supports a model of purifying selection for the M segment
and neutral substitutions in the S segment.
Segment reassortments
Maximum likelihood trees were created for both genome
segments (M segment on left, S segment on right in Figure
8). Specific clades in the M and S segment trees are labeled
by letters in ovals from A-E, and A-D, respectively. For reasons already discussed, the majority of bootstrap values in
the M segment phylogeny were low, whereas the bootstrap scores in the S segment phylogeny are large.

There are two isolates in which the M segment arises on a
different branch than does the S segment. Pb15 and Pm17
both from Navajo, NM, arose from Clade E in the M seg-

ment but arose from Clade B in the S segment. Thus, 2 of
the 20 peromyscines from which we amplified both the S
and M segments appeared to contain reassortant viruses.
Otherwise, the S and M segment phylogenies appear to
parallel one another. A χ2 test of independence was performed to examine the overall correlation between the M
and S segment sequences from same individuals. The χ2
test was highly significant (P ≤ .0001) as was the Fisher's
Exact Test (P = 7.96 × 10-9). This suggests that the M and S
segment sequences from the same mice tended to arise on
the same clade.

Discussion
Phylogenetic analyses of SNV genotypes revealed that
10% (2/20) of viruses were reassortants, not significantly
less (Fisher's Exact Test P = 1.00) than the 14% (6/46)
reported previously [9] in SNV sequences from Nevada
and eastern California. Those authors examined isolates
from 3 humans and from 43 rodents and found that all of
the human isolates but only three of the rodent isolates
were reassortants. A better comparison therefore is 3 of 43
(7%) but this also is not significantly less than the rate in
the present study (Fisher's Exact Test P = 0.6488).
Henderson et al. [9] suggested that as genetic distance
increases, the frequency of formation of viable reassortants decreases and that hantaviruses which are primarily
maintained in different rodent hosts rarely have the

opportunity to genetically interact. Our data only partially
support this suggestion. Notice for example in Figure 8
that the M segment of Pb15 (from a brush mouse) and
Pm17 from Navajo, NM (Clade F) are genetically distant
(4% difference) from M segments of those in Clade B, the
clade containing the S segment of Pb15 and Pm17. Acquisition of SNV by a brush mouse likely was due to a spillover event, an infrequent interspecies interaction between
this rodent and an SNV-infected deer mouse. Alternatively, it may be that rodents in species-poor areas are
spared frequent contact with rodents in nearby but not
contiguous areas. Further interpretations require additional information regarding climatic conditions, habitat
peculiarities and physical barriers, and information about
seasonality of collections.
Very few sites in the 142 nt of the M segment were in linkage disequilibrium (Figure 5) while many of the sites
within 150 nt of one another in the S segment were in disequilibrium (Figure 6). The differences in disequilibrium
rates are not attributable to greater mutation rates because
both segments have similar evolutionary rates (Table 3).
The differences could be related to relative synonymous
codon usage; the S segment having a biased and therefore
constrained usage pattern, while the M segment may have
had unbiased usage. However, a scaled χ2 analysis of relative synonymous codon usage in DNAsp revealed no bias
in either gene (analysis not shown). The difference might

be associated with the relative ages of the two sequences
since the S segment was estimated to be 2.86 times (106
years/37 years) older than the M segment. As an ancestral
sequence accumulates mutations, distinct lineages begin
to form. Initially sequences may be in disequilibrium
because segregating sites have not had sufficient time to
accumulate reverse mutations. However, given enough
time, these reverse mutations will accumulate and patterns of disequilibrium will dissipate. However this is
opposite to the observed trend; S is older than M. There
may be some type of epistatic selection acting across the
nucleocapsid gene or protein that maintains polymorphic
sites in disequilibrium while no such selection is acting
upon the G2 gene or glycoprotein. However, we have no
hypotheses about the form of such a selection.
The significance of these findings lies in the observations
regarding the relatively high rate of reassortment. The deer
mouse is the most common and most numerous mammal in North America. It occurs throughout the United
States and much of Canada, except for their eastern coasts.
Because SNV is transmitted principally through transfer of
saliva, urine or feces from SNV-infected rodents, because
these rodents are so numerous, and because the virus
affects the rodent host but does not do so critically [16],
intraspecies transmission of SNV occurs at high frequency
[17,18]. This provides frequent opportunities for genomic
evolution to occur via reassortment, as has been reported
for influenza viruses [19].
If one arbitrarily selects a location in North America and
sequences the M and S RNAs of SNV from deer mice at
that site and then sequences M and S RNAs from deer
mice at sites increasingly distant (geographically or by
habitat type) from that site, numerous and divergent genotypes likely would be found. Indeed, the initial epidemiologic studies of SNV (S.T. Nichol, personal
communication, 1994) showed such a pattern on a
smaller geographic scale. The number of mutations and
cumulative reassortments mount until, at the greatest geographic distances, the virus might be seen as being no
longer consistent with the topotype. Host-switching

events may lead to distinct variants in different peromyscine subspecies (c.f., Monongahela virus in P. maniculatus
nubiterrae) or in rodents of different peromyscine species
(c.f., New York and Blue River viruses in P. leucopus). The
phylogeography of these subtypes and varieties must be
determined, if we are to understand rodent host and
hantaviral genetics because virus variations may reflect
those of their rodent hosts, as has been suggested by Dragoo et al. [4].
It appears to be counterintuitive that this virus has evolved
as rapidly as our data suggest. One might justifiably ask
how this virus has managed to become distributed so
widely in North America only recently, when its host
rodent, the deer mouse, is and has been distributed over
this continent for a very long time. Could a progenitor of
SNV have been a virus whose rodent host was not the deer
mouse and which switched hosts only fairly recently? Low
rates of nucleotide substitutions have been hypothesized
for the hantaviruses but, as Ramsden et al. have suggested,
"hantaviruses replicate with an RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase, with error rates in the region of one mutation
per genome replication, [and therefore] this low rate of
nucleotide substitution is anomalous" [20]. Do only
slight host genetic differences lead to only slight, but significant, differences in the virus? Can such apparently trivial virus genetic differences have substantial
epidemiologic differences, perhaps effecting pathogenicity? There are many possible scenarios that should be
investigated; the data we present here do not shed light on
them.
Variants that are widely divergent may have acquired a
gene or genes, one or more mutations, or combinations of
otherwise non-pathogenic changes, and changes thereby
arise and may have epidemiologic consequences. Such
changes could be towards or away from pathogenicity,
infectivity, stability, persistence, host adaptability, replication, or otherwise. These combinations of events are random, or at least not predictable at this time, and therefore
continued surveillance is needed.

Methods
Rodent sampling
Using Colorado State University Animal Care and Use
Committee-approved procedures, rodents of several species were captured using Sherman live-traps. Trapping was
conducted at several geographically diverse locations in
Colorado, including Fort Collins and Ault (north-central),
Wray (northeast), Fort Lewis and Breen (southwest),
Nathrop (central), and Mesa (west-central) (Figure 1).
Habitats at the Fort Collins and Wray sites are characterized as shortgrass prairie; at Fort Lewis and Breen as montane shrubland dominated by Gambel's oak (Quercus
gambelii) and big sage (Artemisia tridentata); at Mesa and
Nathrop as pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis and Juniperus

spp.) and sagebrush shrublands; the Ault site was an
uncultivated agricultural field.
One SNV-infected deer mouse from Polson, Montana was
kindly provided by Dr. Richard Douglas, Montana Tech,
Butte, Montana. Several others were from Navajo and
Placitas, New Mexico, gifts of Dr. Terry Yates, University of
New Mexico, Albuquerque. Deer mice trapped in Colorado were sacrificed and liver, lung, kidneys and spleen
were removed and stored in RNALater (Ambion, Austin,
TX) at -70°C until they were analyzed.

see, FL) baited with cracked corn, peanut butter and rolled
oats. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, standard
measurements were taken and blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus. For animals captured
in Colorado during and after 2006, a 1-hour rapid ELISA
was used in the field to test deer mouse blood samples for
antibody to SNV [21]. Seropositive deer mice were euthanized and kidney, liver, lung, and spleen samples were
collected from each. Those found to be seronegative were
released at the site of capture. Prior to 2006, only carcasses
of deer mice that had died under anesthesia and were later
found to be seropositive by an ELISA were used in this
study.

RNA purification and reverse transcription
For total RNA extraction, tissues were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and then homogenized using a mortar and pestle. Homogenates were extracted once using guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-choloroform (Trizol, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA); RNA was precipitated with isopropanol.
Total RNA from infected mouse tissue was then reverse
transcribed with Thermoscript (Invitrogen) and amplified
via polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using segment specific primers (Table 4). Amplicons of a 751 nt region of
the S segment and of a 142 nt region of the M segment
were produced. Nested PCR was then performed to produce samples used as sequencing templates.

The S segment was amplified with the following cycling
parameters: 94°C (120 s) initial denaturing, [94°C (30 s),
58°C (30 s), 72°C (60 s)] 40 times, and a final extension
at 72°C (300 s). The M segment was amplified with these
cycling parameters: 94°C (120 s) initial denaturing,
[94°C (10 s), 56°C (15 s), 72°C (30 s)] 40 times, and a
final extension at 72°C (300 s). Table 4 shows the primers
used for each segment. Purified PCR products were cloned
into vector pCR2.1 (TOPO cloning kit, Invitrogen). A
minimum of 3 clones were sequenced per sample to control for any Taq polymerase-induced mutations. Samples
were fully sequenced by the Colorado State University
Macromolecular Sequencing core facility. Cloned segment data were submitted for BLAST analysis to confirm
their

Phylogenetic Analysis
To compare our sequences with those reported in the literature we used the following M segment sequences:
L27759-27795 [22], U33219-U33264, U45023 [12],
U10889 [23], L37903 [24], and U44991 – U44992 from
[9]. S segment sequences were U47135 [25], U29210 [26],
U09488 [27], AF281850 and AF281851 [28], L33683 and
L33816 [14], L37904 [23], U02474 [13] and L25784 [21].
Maximum likelihood trees were estimated separately for
the M and the S segments by first identifying the evolutionary model that best fits the data, using Modeltest 3.7
[29] with the Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony
(PAUP) 4.0b10 package [30]. The optimal model and
parameters were then used to estimate the ML tree in
PAUP. Bootstrap values of individual branches were
obtained with ML analysis of 100 pseudoreplicates. This
same model and parameters were then used in the
BEAUTi/BEAST 1.4 package to develop a rooted, timebased phylogeny inferred using a strict molecular clock.
The year of collection minus 2007 values were entered as
"Date before the present" variables for each RT-PCR or
isolation record. TreeAnnotater (v1.4.8) was used to generate the ML tree. The rate of molecular evolution (substi-

tutions/site/year) was also estimated from the BEAUTi/
BEAST 1.4.
Linkage disequilibrium analysis
Linkage disequilibrium is a measure of the degree to
which substitutions in a segment occur independently of
one another. Substitutions that occur together in a segment at a rate predicted by their independent frequencies
are in linkage equilibrium. Substitutions that occur more
or less often than expected by random chance are considered to be in linkage disequilibrium. The Hill and Robertson correlation coefficient (r2) [31] was used as a metric of
disequilibrium because it ranges from zero (linkage equilibrium) to one (linkage disequilibrium). Linkage disequilibrium also tests whether sampling a portion of a
genome segment is representative of the whole segment.
Linkage equilibrium is detected when different parts of a
segment are evolving independently and sequencing a
portion of the segment may not provide a representative
sample of the whole. Linkage disequilibrium patterns
among all polymorphic sites were plotted on a heatmap
using the LDheatmap program in R [32].
Nucleotide polymorphisms and substitution rates
For each segment, the computer program DnaSP 4.5 [33]
estimated haplotype diversity [34] (equations 8.4 and
8.12 but replacing 2n by n) and π the average number of
nucleotide differences among all pairwise comparisons of
sequences [34] (equation 10.5). π also was estimated separately for synonymous (πs)and replacement substitutions (πa).

A test of selective neutrality was performed [15]. The F*
statistic was calculated in DnaSP to provide a normalized
comparison of the number of all mutations (η) to the
number of singletons (ηs). This analysis assumes that F* >
0 (η > ηs) under balancing selection, F* ≈ 0 (η ≈ ηs) with
neutral substitutions and F* < 0 (η < ηs) under purifying
selection.

Segment reassortants
The topology of the M and S segment trees were compared
to detect whether SNV RNA sequences from the same
mouse arose in the same branches. Sequences arising in
different clades were considered prima facie evidence of
reassortment. A χ2 test of independence was also performed to test whether M and S segments from the same
mouse were significantly correlated (non-independent).
This was done by labeling clades with a letter and then
assigning each isolate the letter of its clade in the M and S
segment trees.
