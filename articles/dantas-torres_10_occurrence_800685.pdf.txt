Occurrence and genetic variability of Phlebotomus
papatasi in an urban area of southern Italy
Filipe Dantas-Torres*, Maria Stefania Latrofa, Domenico Otranto*

Abstract
Background: A phlebotomine sand fly was noticed in the second floor of an old building in a highly urbanized
area of southern Italy. A short-term entomological survey was carried out in the subsequent weeks to this event,
allowing the collection of additional phlebotomine sand flies that were later identified as Phlebotomus papatasi. We
assessed the genetic variability among P. papatasi sequences obtained in this study and those available from Italy
using a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment (from cytochrome b gene to NADH1) and the internal transcribed
spacer 2 (ITS2) as genetic markers.
Results: From 9 June to 19 July, eight males and seven females (two blood-fed) of P. papatasi were collected in
the old town of Bari (southern Italy). The insects were found near the bed and in the bathroom and potential
blood sources (e.g., pigeons and dogs) for them were common in the neighbourhood. Again, five females of
P. papatasi collected in Valenzano, another urban area in the province of Bari, were also identified and included in
the genetic study. The mtDNA sequences (945 bp) obtained from Bari and Valenzano were identical except for a
single transition (T ↔ C) at the 793 nucleotide residue. Pairwise comparison of the last 440 bp of the mtDNA
fragment analyzed herein with other sequences of P. papatasi from Italy revealed a nucleotide variation ranging
from 0.2 to 1.3%. Three ITS2 sequence types were detected within specimens collected in Valenzano, one of them
identical to that from Bari. Pairwise comparison of ITS2 sequences of P. papatasi from Italy revealed a nucleotide
variation up to 1.8%.
Conclusions: This study reports the occurrence of P. papatasi in an urban area of southern Italy and shows a low
nucleotide difference among ITS2 and mtDNA sequences of this species available from Italy. The presence of P.
papatasi in urban areas might represent a risk for human health, particularly for the potential transmission of
sandfly fever viruses.

Findings
Phlebotomus papatasi is the type-species of the genus
Phlebotomus, which include all phlebotomine sand fly
vectors of Leishmania parasites in the Old World [1].
The biology of P. papatasi has been subject of many
field and laboratory investigations [2-8]. Through its
range, P. papatasi is predominantly a domestic species,
being often found in or nearby human habitations [9].
This sand fly feeds readily on birds, rodents, domestic
animals as well as on humans [10-12]. Moreover,
P. papatasi is a vector of Leishmania major, the agent
of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in North Africa and

Middle East [13], and has been implicated in the transmission of viruses in Europe [14]. Sandfly fevers were
firstly described in southern Italy during the World War
II, when an outbreak of influenza-like illness was
recorded among US soldiers due to Sicilian and Naples
viruses [15], which have been later isolated from
P. papatasi in many Mediterranean countries [16,17].
The reduced abundance of P. papatasi due to the control campaigns against malaria in the past century
diminished the perceived relevance of this sand fly in
Italy. However, the abundance of P. papatasi is increasing [18] and the actual risk for public health in Italy is
probably underestimated. Indeed, surveys carried out in
Italy before 1975 indicated that P. papatasi was already
widespread, thought rarely abundant [18]. However, studies conducted in central and southern Italy from 1975

onwards indicated an increase in abundance of this sand
fly, especially in urban areas [18]. In spite of its widespread distribution, data on the public health significance of P. papatasi in Italy is scant and little is known
about the genetic relationships among geographically
isolated populations.
On 8 June 2009, a phlebotomine sand fly was noticed
inside the apartment of one of us (FTD). This episode
occurred on the second floor of an old, restructured
building located downtown, in a highly urbanized area
of southern Italy. Herein, further worth noting facts of
this history are presented along with genetic data of this
P. papatasi population, which is one of the southernmost records of this species in Europe. The possible
public health implications of the presence of P. papatasi
in urban areas of Italy are discussed.
This short-term entomological survey was carried
out in a building in the old part of Bari (41°07’N, 16°
52’E), the main town of the Apulia region, which has a
typical Mediterranean climate. The building is situated
in a highly urbanized area, a few meters from the seaport of the city (Figure 1). From 9 June to 19 July,
phlebotomine sand flies were collected daily using oral
aspirators (every night, during 30 min, initiating
around 9:00 pm), and a CDC light trap (operated daily
from 8:00 pm to 7:00 am). Additionally, sticky traps
were placed in two windows of the apartment and
downstairs near some bushes, in a small garden
belonging to the building’s front yard. Phlebotomine
sand flies collected were preserved in 70% ethanol

until being slide-mounted in Hoyer’s medium and
identified based on morphology [1].
One phlebotomine sand fly from Bari was processed
for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplification of fragments of the mitochondrial from cytochrome b (cytb) to NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NADH1) - and of the ribosomal DNA - internal
transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) - as previously described
[19-21]. Additionally, five specimens of P. papatasi collected from another urban area from the province of
Bari (Valenzano, 41°3’N, 16°53’E) were processed for
comparison purposes. In brief, DNA was extracted using
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR was carried out in
a 50 μl final volume, which included 4 μl of DNA template, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP, 50 pmol of each primer
and 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems).
Negative controls (no DNA) were included in each PCR
run and amplicons were visualised by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis under ultraviolet exposure. PCR products were purified using Ultrafree-DA columns (Amicon; Millipore) and sequenced with an automated
sequencer (ABI-PRISM 377; Applied Biosystems). DNA
sequences were determined on both strands and deposited in the GenBank database (GenBank:HM992926,
GenBank:HM992927, GenBank:HM992928, GenBank:
HM992929, GenBank:HM992930). The electropherogram of each sequence was verified by eye, and the
sequences were aligned manually using ClustalX

program [22]. Sequences were compared by BLAST analysis with cytb and ITS2 sequences of P. papatasi available in the GenBank database. Pairwise comparison
between sequences from Italy obtained in this study and
those available in GenBank was carried out and nucleotide differences (D) were calculated [23].
Eight males and seven females (two blood-fed) were
collected in Bari, being all identified as P. papatasi (Figures 2A and 2B). No worth noting morphological differences were noticed among the slide-mounted specimens
examined in this study. All specimens were collected
inside the apartment, on the second floor, being often
found in the bedroom and bathroom. All attempts to
collect phlebotomine sand flies with sticky traps and
CDC light traps gave negative results.
The mtDNA sequences (945 bp) obtained from Bari
and Valenzano were identical except for a single transition (T ↔ C) at the 793 nucleotide residue. Moreover,
BLAST analysis with the longest consensus cytb
sequence (717 bp) available in Genbank (provenience
Tunisia; GenBank:AF161214), revealed a high homology
(99.9%) with the sequence from Bari. Pairwise comparison of the last 440 bp of the mtDNA fragment analyzed
herein with those of P. papatasi from Lazio (Italy) available in GenBank (GenBank:DQ381829, GenBank:
DQ381830, GenBank:DQ381831) revealed a nucleotide
variation ranging from 0.2 to 1.3%.
Three ITS2 sequence types were detected within specimens collected in Valenzano (i.e., nos. 1, 2 and 3), differing only by some insertions/deletions. The sequence
type no. 1 was identical to that from Bari. In particular,

Page 3 of 5

ITS2 sequences obtained had an overall length ranging
from 483 to 490 bp and presented high homologies (99100%) with those from Syria (GenBank: DQ887666) and
Cyprus (GenBank: DQ887634), respectively. Pairwise
comparison of ITS2 sequences of P. papatasi from Italy
available in GenBank (GenBank:EF408790, GenBank:
EF408791) revealed a nucleotide difference up to 1.8%.
In this study, a population of P. papatasi was detected
in an urban area of southern Italy, representing one of
the southernmost records of this species in Europe. The
morphology of both males and females of P. papatasi
examined in the present study perfectly fits with the
species description provided by Lewis [1]. Genetically,
the specimens sequenced in this study are closely related
with P. papatasi from Tunisia (cytb), Cyprus and Syria
(ITS2). In particular, the nucleotide differences within
the mtDNA sequences from Apulia herein characterized
increased when compared with those from Lazio. Nonetheless, the sequence differences found in this study are
consistent with those found in other studies using the
same genetic markers [24,25]. These DNA fragments,
particularly cytb, have been regarded as good genetic
markers to assess the relationships between closely
related populations of P. papatasi in the Mediterranean
region [26]. Accordingly, our results indicate a low level
of genetic variability among Italian populations of
P. papatasi, which is in line with a recent phylogenetic
study reporting a genetic homogeneity among 26 populations of P. papatasi from 18 countries [25].
Based on what is known about its eco-biology [1,9],

of southern Italy include the earthen floor of small gardens (Figure 3A) and holes in the wall of old buildings
(Figure 3B). Also, the potential bloodmeal sources could
be pigeons (Figures 3C and 3D), dogs and humans. The
period (June-July) in which P. papatasi was collected in
this study is in line with previous records of P. papatasi
in southern and central Italy, in which this species was
caught from June to October [18].
Whether the presence of P. papatasi inside houses in
urban areas in Italy or other southern European countries represents a risk for human health, particularly for
their potential role as vectors of phleboviruses and
Leishmania parasites, remains uncertain. Again, the natural vertebrate hosts of L. major include some wild
rodents [27] whose absence in Europe might represent
one of the reasons for the absence of this zoonotic
agent in southern Europe [28]. Indeed, it has been stated
that the risk of emergence of cutaneous leishmaniasis by
L. major in Europe is low because its main gerbil reservoirs are absent, even though P. papatasi is locally
abundant in some areas [28]. However, a recent study

suggested that Norwegian rats (Rattus norvegicus),
which are abundant in Europe, could be involved in the
maintenance of L. major in southern Iran [29]. Indeed,
the risk of introduction of L. major in southern Europe
has not been fully evaluated and deserves more
attention.
This work provides genetic data of a population of
P. papatasi in an urban area of southern Italy, representing one of the southernmost reports of this sand fly
in Europe. Finally, further research to assess whether
the presence of P. papatasi in urban areas of southern
Europe represents a risk for public health is needed.
