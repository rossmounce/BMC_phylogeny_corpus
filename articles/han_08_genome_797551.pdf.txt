Abstract
Background: Outbreak of V. parahaemolyticus infections occurred since 1996 was linked to a
proposed clonal complex, the pandemic group. The whole genome sequence provides an
unprecedented opportunity for dissecting genome plasticity and phylogeny of the populations of V.
parahaemolyticus. In the present work, a whole-genome cDNA microarray was constructed to
compare the genomic contents of a collection of 174 strains of V. parahaemolyticus.
Results: Genes that present variably in the genome accounted for about 22% of the whole gene
pool on the genome. The phylogenetic analysis of microarray data generated a minimum spanning
tree that depicted the phylogenetic structure of the 174 strains. Strains were assigned into five
complexes (C1 to C5), and those in each complex were related genetically and phylogenetically.
C3 and C4 represented highly virulent clinical clones. C2 and C3 constituted two different clonal
complexes 'old-O3:K6 clone' and 'pandemic clone', respectively. C3 included all the 39 pandemic
strains tested (trh-, tdh+ and GS-PCR+), while C2 contained 12 pre-1996 'old' O3:K6 strains (trh+,
tdh- and GS-PCR-) tested herein. The pandemic clone (post-1996 'new' O3:K6 and its derivates
O4:K68, O1:K25, O1:KUT and O6:K18) might be emerged from the old-O3:K6 clone, which was
promoted by acquisition of toxRS/new sequence and genomic islands. A phylogenetic intermediate
O3:K6 clade (trh-, tdh- and GS-PCR+) was identified between the pandemic and old-O3:K6 clones.
Conclusion: A comprehensive overview of genomic contents in a large collection of global isolates
from the microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization data enabled us to construct a
phylogenetic structure of V. parahaemolyticus and an evolutionary history of the pandemic group
(clone) of this pathogen.

Background
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophilic, Gram-negative bacterium. As a natural inhabitant of estuarine marine water,
it is widely distributed in seawater and sediments, or frequently associated with marine shellfish. It is the leading
cause of human food poisoning caused by consumption
of the contaminated seafood, especially raw seafood such
as oyster, throughout the world.
In contrast to most environmental isolates, clinical V.
parahaemolyticus is often able to produce thermostable
direct haemolysin (TDH) and/or TDH-related toxin
(TRH), encoded by the tdh and trh genes, respectively [1].
However, clinical isolates in absence of both tdh and trh
have been identified [2]. In addition to TDH and TRH, virulence-related determinants still include thermolabile
haemolysin (encoded by the tl gene), two type III secretion systems, and the ability of adhesion and invasion of
enterocytes [1,3,4]. Clinical V. parahaemolyticus is often
characterized as Kanagawa phenomenon (KP) positive by
exhibiting β-haemolysis on the Wagatsuma agar due to
the production of TDH [3].
Serotyping based on O and K antigens can differentiate
isolates of V. parahaemolyticus, and accordingly 13 O
groups and 71 K types are identified by using the commercial antisera. Traditional molecular typing studies based
on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), arbitrarily
primed PCR (AP-PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST) have been employed to distinguish among isolates [5-9].
Outbreaks of V. parahaemolyticus infections occurred since
1996 were initially linked to a predominant serovar
O3:K6 (tdh+ and trh-). This 'new' O3:K6 appeared firstly in
the February of 1996 in India, and then rapidly spread
worldwide, particularly in coastal countries and regions
[10-12]. The PFGE, AP-PCR and MLST studies [5-9]
revealed that the new O3:K6 and its derivates O4:K68,
O1:K25 and O1:KUT isolated since 1996 gave very similar
fingerprint patterns (FPs) or sequence types (STs), suggesting that they constitute a clonal complex. These strains are
collectively called the 'pandemic group' that is thought to
be responsible for the pandemic outbreaks [10-12].
The pandemic group possesses a variety of 'unique' DNA
markers, including toxRS/new sequence (GS-PCR)
[10,12], ORF8 in the phage f237 [13,14], an insertion
sequence within the Hu-α gene (Hu-α/insertion) [15], a
930 bp AP-PCR fragment (PGS-PCR) [16], and an open
reading frame VP2905 [17]. PCR methods for detection of
these markers have been developed accordingly for distinguishing the pandemic group from other V. parahaemolyticus strains. However, further studies indicated none of the
first three markers were specific to the pandemic group

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/570

[12,18]. Notwithstanding, a positive detection of both tdh
and toxRS/new sequence by PCR (tdh+ and GS-PCR+) can
reliably identify the pandemic strains [12,18]. The toxRStargeted GS-PCR is based on the observation that the pandemic strains have a unique sequence (namely toxRS/new
sequence) within the toxRS operon that encodes transmembrane proteins [10,12].
The complete genome sequences of a pandemic O3:K6
strain RIMD2210633 [19] and a non-pandemic O3:K6
strain AQ3810 have been determined [20]. The genome
of strain RIMD2210633 consists of two circular chromosomes of 3,288,558 bp and 1,877,211 bp, and it harbors
4832 coding sequences (genes). The whole genome
sequence provides an unprecedented opportunity for
illustrating genome plasticity and phylogeny of V. parahaemolyticus populations. In the present work, the genome
dynamics within 174 strains of V. parahaemolyticus, due to
gene acquisition/loss, was determined by microarraybased comparative genomic hybridization (M-CGH).
Subsequent clustering and phylogenetic analysis outlined
a phylogenetic structure of V. parahaemolyticus as well as
an evolutionary history of the pandemic group.

Results and discussion
Strain collection
The 174 strains of V. parahaemolyticus [see Additional file
1] used in this study include 125 clinical isolates and 49
non-clinical ones. The non-clinical strains were isolated
either from seafood or from marine environments. In a
previous study [9], a collection of 535 strains of V. parahaemolyticus were analyzed by PFGE, generating 115 PFGE
patterns. Accordingly, 129 strains covering almost all the
PFGE patterns were picked out for this study. In addition,
42 strains from six provinces (Guangxi, Hebei, Inner
Mongolia, Niaoning, Shandong, and Shanghai) in China
and three international isolates were added into the strain
collection. All together, the 174 strains came from 13
countries, namely China (Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan), Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Maldives, Phillipine, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, and
United States. They were isolated between 1951 and 2007,
with about 15% of them being isolated before 1990.
These strains should represent the sufficient abundance of
V. parahaemolyticus populations.
Basic features of bacterial strains
By using the primers described previously [see Additional
file 2], PCR was performed to screen the presence of various DNA markers, including toxRS/new sequence (GSPCR) [10,12], ORF8 [13], Hu-α/insertion [15], PGS-PCR
sequence [16], V. parahaemolyticus-specific sequences of
VPM [21], gyrB [22] and toxR [23], and the tdh, trh and tl
genes. This analysis was able to assess the reliability of corresponding PCR-based detection/identification, and also

dissect the basic genetic features of V. parahaemolyticus
strains tested (Figure 1). The first four markers have been
proposed for identification of pandemic strains
[10,12,13,15,16]. We defined the pandemic group based
on the previous genotypic definition (GS-PCR+, tdh+ and
trh-) [9,12]. Accordingly, 39 strains were identified to be
the pandemic group members. Notably, in addition to the
O3:K6, O4:K68, O1:K25 and O1:KUT strains, one O6:K18
strain was also assigned into this group.
In addition to the 39 pandemic strains, a tdh- O3:K6 strain
S093 gave the positive GS-PCR reaction. Three of the 39
pandemic strains were negative for ORF8; one of these
three was negative for Hu-α/insertion. Thus, none of
toxRS/new sequence, ORF8 and Hu-α/insertion was reliable for PCR-based identification of the pandemic strains,
which confirmed the previous results [9,12,24]. The positive PGS-PCR was detected only for the 39 pandemic
strains, indicating that the corresponding DNA marker
(namely the PGS-PCR sequence) was specific to the pandemic group. In addition, we confirmed that the gene
cluster VP2900-2910, constituting a genomic island
named VpaI-5 [25], was a unique genomic feature of the
pandemic group (see below).
V. parahaemolyticus-specific sequences of gyrB [22], toxR
[23] and VPM [21] have been characterized for the PCR
identification of this bacterium at the species level. Here,
the first two sequences were detected in all the 174 strains,
giving an inclusivity of 100%. However, a total of 25
strains gave negative PCR results for VPM, with an inclusivity of only 86%; thereby, this marker was not reliable
for the bacterial identification.
The tl gene was universally present in the 174 strains
tested. The universal presence of this gene in V. parahaemolyticus strains has been characterized previously
[26]. Despite the 100% correct identification of V. parahaemolyticus by the tl gene-based PCR, the test was lack of
the specificity, i.e., false-positive PCR results could be seen
in other Vibiro species [26].
94% of the clinical strains harbored the tdh and/or trh
genes; especially, the tdh+ ones constituted 90% of the
clinical strains [see Additional file 3]. In contrast, 90% of
non-clinical strains contained none of the two genes.
These data supported the notion that the presence of tdh
and/or trh was closely correlated with the pathogenicity of
V. parahaemolyticus.
Efficacy of M-CGH methodology
In our previous works, a Yersinia pestis DNA microarray
was employed to compare the genomic content of Yersinia
strains [27], promoting us to establish the standard operation procedures of M-CGH. The efficacy of M-CGH in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/570

present work was assessed by the control hybridizations
of 'Reference DNA versus Reference DNA'. After the data
filtering procedures, all the genes gave a correct prediction
of their presence. The control hybridizations still include
'genomic DNA of strain S004 versus Reference DNA'. The
gene cluster VP2900-2910 was shown to be absent in this
strain, as determined by our preliminary PCR experiments
(data not shown). The microarray analysis confirmed the
absence of VP2900-2910 in this strain. A total of 4021
genes were included in the final microarray dataset that
contained the M-CGH profiles of the 174 strains. Genes
were categorized as either present (1), absent (0) or missing data for each strain.
Phylogeny
We performed the clustering analysis on the binary MCGH data by the UPGMA method (Figure 1). This analysis generated a similarity matrix as well as a UPGMA tree
(Figure 1). On the basis of the similarity matrix, a minimum spanning tree was constructed to give a phylogenetic structure of the 174 strains (Figure 2). Based on the
minimum spanning tree as well as the UPGMA tree, 165
of the 174 strains were assigned into five complexes, C1 to
C5. Each complex, in particular C2 and C3, showed a considerable conservation of composition/number of genes
that present variably in the genome (variably-presented
genes, VPGs) (Figure 1). This demonstrated that strains in
each complex were related genetically and phylogenetically.

General features of strains in different complexes were
shown in Table 1. All the strains in C2 to C4 were clinical.
C3 included all the 39 pandemic strains tested (trh- and
tdh+), while C2 contained 12 old O3:K6 strains (trh+ and
tdh-) used in this study. The number of VPGs in C2 and C3
was obviously lower than that in all the other strains. An
extremely high conservation of genomic content was
observed in these two groups of strains (Figure 1), therefore, constituting two different clonal complexes, namely
'old-O3:K6 clone' (C2) and 'pandemic clone' (C3).
VPaI-5 (see below) was unique to the pandemic clone
(C3) according to the M-CGH data. Genes in VPaI-5 were
further screened in the 174 strains by PCR [see Additional
file 2], confirming the M-CGH results. Accordingly, two
pandemic-group-specific markers, PGS-PCR sequence and
VPaI-5, were identified (Figure 1).
The tdh gene was present in all the C3 strains and most
(98%) of the C4 strains, but not in the C2 ones. According
to the M-CGH data, the gene cluster VPA1322-1369 was
found in all the C3 and C4 strains, but not in all the other
strains, which was further confirmed by PCR screening
[see Additional file 2]. This gene cluster encodes a type III
secretion system (T3SS) that contributes to the virulence

of V. parahaemolyticus [4]. Both VPA1322-1369 and tdh
were harbored in a pathogenicity island VPaI-7 (see
below) in strain RIMD2210633. The presence of both tdh
and VPA1322-1369 in almost all the C3 and C4 strains
suggested that these strains might represent the highly virulent clones. Indeed, the C3 strains (the pandemic group)
has been linked to the outbreaks of V. parahaemolyticus
infections since 1996.
Both trh and tdh were absent from 31 of the 35 strains in the
C5 complex. 83% (28 of the 35 strains) of the C5 strains
were non-clinical, and all these 28 strains were negative for
both trh and tdh. Thus, the C5 complex is linked to environmental isolates. Lack of both trh and tdh does not impede V.
parahaemolyticus to be non-virulent, due to the existence of
other virulence factors (e.g. type III secretion system) [4].
Animal virulence experiments on a collection of typical C5
strains should be done to answer whether C5 is linked to a
non-virulent complex from environment.
Evolution of the pandemic group
The minimum spanning tree clearly showed that the pandemic clone (trh-, tdh+ and GS-PCR+) was emerged from
the old-O3:K6 clone (trh+, tdh- and GS-PCR-) (Figure 2).
One of the most interesting results was the identification
of a phylogenetic intermediate (a non-pandemic O3:K6
strain S093) between the pandemic and old-O3:K6 clones
(Figure 2).

Phylogenetically, strain S093 (trh-, tdh- and GS-PCR+) was
dramatically distant from the pandemic clone, but was
closely related to the old-O3:K6 clone. Compared to the
old-O3:K6 clone, a distinct feature of strain S093 was that
it possessed the toxRS/new sequence (GS-PCR+). Similar
pre-1996 O3:K6 strains (trh-, tdh- and GS-PCR+) have been
characterized previously [12]. All these strains were
assigned to the proposed 'intermediate-O3:K6 clade'.
It was concluded herein that the acquisition of toxRS/new
sequence led to the phylogenesis of the intermediate-O3:K6
clade from the old-O3:K6 clone, and that the post-1996 new

O3:K6 stemmed from this intermediate clade after the acquisition of tdh, VpaI-5 and other unidentified genes (Figure 2).
The pandemic clone consisted of five serovars, O3:K6 (29
strains), O4:K68 (5), O1:K25 (3), O1:KUT (1) and
O6:K18 (1). Slight genome plasticity was observed within
the pandemic clone. According to the minimum spanning
tree, the 39 pandemic strains were assigned into five subgroups, SG1 to SG5 (Figure 2). Strains in a given subgroup gave almost identical genomic content. The 29
new-O3:K6 strains were included in SG1 to SG4. The
remaining 10 strains of O4:K68, O1:K25, O1:KUT and
O6:K18 fell into SG5. Date presented here provided the
direct evidences to the notion that the post-1996 strains of
O4:K68, O1:K25, O1:KUT and O6:K18 (called 'newO3:K6 serovariants') were evolved from the new O3:K6.
Since strains in each of the five sub-groups (SG1 to SG5)
gave almost identical genomic content, one strain was
picked out from each sub-group. The M-GCH data (log2
ratios) of these representative strains were graphically
shown in Additional file 4, which depicted the regions
that present variably in the genome, particularly including
genomic islands and O/K antigen genes.
Taken all the above results together, a phylogenetic relatedness between 'old O3:K6', 'intermediate O3:K6', 'new
O3:K6', and 'new-O3:K6 serovariants' were proposed (Figure
3). It was recently reported that, arising from old O3:K6, the
pandemic clone acquired at least seven novel genomic
regions including VPaI-1 to VpaI-7 plus a type VI secretion
system (VP1386-1420) [20]. Data presented here (Figure 3)
illustrated how the stepwise acquisition of genomic islands
as well as the differentiation of O/K antigen genes promoted
the microevolution of the pandemic clone, giving a proposed evolutionary history of the pandemic group.
Variably-presented genes (VPGs)
GC contents
Of the 4021 genes surveyed, 871 were absent in at least
one of the 174 strains tested. VPGs were often located conPage 6 of 12

tinuously in the genome, generating various plasticity
zones (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1, the GC content of
many genes in the plasticity zones, especially within the
genomic islands, was lower than the average GC content
of the entire genome.
Both variably- and universally-presented genes gave the
same distribution of GC contents, i.e., the genes scattered

from low to high GC contents [see Additional file 5].
However, the VPGs were over-presented and tailed
towards low GC value. Thus, most genes with a GC content of less than 39% were variably presented. The 871
VPGs gave an average GC content of 44.1, whereas the
average GC content of the remaining 3150 genes was
46.4. These results together indicated that many VPGs
might be foreign origins through horizontal gene transfer.

Functional classification
The proportions of VPGs with respect to their functional
category were shown in Additional file 6. Genes (1221 in
total) responsible for house-keeping functions (small
molecule or macromolecule metabolism) were relatively
conserved; VPGs counted only 14% of them, especially
including those involved in amino acid biosynthesis
(7%), transcription (8%) and protein synthesis (8%). In
contrast, 25% of the genes in the other six categories (cell
envelope, transport and binding proteins, regulatory functions, cellular processes, mobile and extrachromosomal
element functions, and unknown or unassigned function)
were divergently distributed. It was surprising that 49% of
the VPGs encoded unknown or unassigned functions.
Genes in the category of mobile and extrachromosomal
element function (phage- and transposon-related genes)
exhibited the highest diversity; 96% of them were absent
especially in non-clinical strains. These observations further supported the notion that VPGs were often imported
from other species through horizontal gene transfer.
Large variably-presented gene clusters (VPCs)
While this manuscript was in preparation, a M-CGH study
on 22 strains of V. parahaemolyticus was published by
Izutsu et al [28]. The authors identified 13 large variablypresented gene clusters (VPC01 to VPC13) each containing more than 10 ORFs, all of which were confirmed by
our results. Four additional large VPCs (VP1355-1368,
VPA0074-0089, VPA0713-0732 and VPA1194-1210)
were identified in the present work. However, the major
difference between these two studies was that a much
richer collection of isolates representing the global populations of V. parahaemolyticus were analyzed in this study
for constructing a phylogenetic structure based on gene
acquisition/loss, and to group the strains of distinct origins into multiple complexes, and to further propose the
phylogeny of these complexes, especially including the
evolutionary history of the pandemic group.
Genomic islands
Based on the bioinformatics analysis, seven genomic
islands (VPaI-1 to VPaI-7) were identified in the genome
of strain RIMD2210633 [25]. Ranged in size from 10 kb
to 81 kb, they are flanked by direct repeats. The first five
are located on chromosome 1, while the later two on
chromosome 2. Six of them (VPaI-1; VPaI-3 to VPaI-7)
have a GC content (ranging from 38% to 43%) lower than
the overall genome GC content of 45%; these six genomic
islands were variably presented in the 174 strains tested
(Figure 4). The remaining VPaI-2 with an average GC content (45%) equal to that of the whole genome was present
in all the 174 strains tested (Figure 4). Absence of VPaI-2
was observed in V. parahaemolyticus as well [20]. Taken
together, all the seven genomic islands were variably presented in V. parahaemolyticus, indicating the horizontal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/570

gene transfer of these elements among different linkages
of V. parahaemolyticus.
A previous PCR screening analysis on 41 strains of V. parahaemolyticus showed that five (VPaI-1; VPaI-4 to VPaI-7) of
the seven genomic islands were specific to the pandemic
group [25]. Data presented here revealed that VPaI-1,
VPaI-3, VPaI-4 and VPaI-6 were closely correlated to the
pandemic strains (but not 100% correlation) (Figure 4).
All the pandemic strains harbored VPaI-1 and VPaI-3,
while VPaI-4 and VPaI-6 were absent from a single pandemic strain (S133) (Figure 4). All the above four were
absent from most of the non-pandemic strains; although
they were found in a few of non-pandemic strains, with
only the partial components of each genomic island in
most cases (Figure 4).
The 81 kb VPaI-7 encode a T3SS and two tdh genes. The
M-CGH study by Izutsu et al [28] indicated that VPaI-7
was specific to KP+(tdh+) strains. Herein, 81 of the 105
tdh+ strains harbored VPaI-7, and another tdh- strain contained the gene cluster VPA1322-1369 (a part of VPaI-7)
(Figure 4), suggesting that there was no 100% correlation
between VPaI-7 and KP+ (tdh+) phenotype.
The above results strongly argued that an analysis of a
large collection of strains (so as to sufficiently represent
the diversity of V. parahaemolyticus) was needed to make
reasonable conclusions.
Pandemic clone-specific genes
Unlike some other bacterial pathogen, V. parahaemolyticus
including its newly emerged pandemic clone has no
unique plasmid. Identification of genomic regions specific to the pandemic clone will provide the signature
DNA sequences for discrimination of pandemic strains
from others. It is amazing that, except VPaI-5 (see above)
no additional pandemic clone-specific genes (those
present in all pandemic strains but not in all non-pandemic ones) were identified by M-CGH. VPaI-5(VP29002910) is a cluster of genes encoded hypothetical proteins
with unknown function. At the present circumstance, the
function or significance of VPaI-5 cannot be directly
linked to the global outbreak of gastrointestinal infections
caused by the pandemic group (clone).
O and K antigen genes
All genes in the genomic region VP0187-0238 were divergently distributed in the 174 strains. These genes are
responsible for the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides
and capsular polysaccharides that determine major O and
K antigens of V. parahaemolyticus. Similar results were
found in Izutsu et al' M-CGH study [28]. The above results
indicated deletion or horizontal transfer of relevant genes

accounted for the diversification of O and K antigens of
this bacterium.
Concluding remarks
The previous PFGE, AP-PCR and MLST studies showed the
significant genetic variability within the populations of V.
parahaemolyticus, but the pandemic group members were
highly conserved genetically to form a clonal complex [59]. Although the wide use of traditional typing systems for
the epidemiological analysis of V. parahaemolyticus, a clear
disagreement has been observed between O:K serovars
and FP/STs. Strains of a single serovar (e.g. O3:K6) often
gave distinct FP/STs, whereas a number of serovars among
the pandemic group gave similar or undistinguishable FP/
STs. It is apparent that the serotyping scheme is not reliable for characterizing the epidemiological spread of V.
parahaemolyticus. In addition, both serotyping and traditional molecular typing methods are limited in accurately
tracking genetic differences and phylogenetic relatedness
of strains. In the present work, a comprehensive overview
of genomic contents in a large collection of global isolates
from the M-CGH data enabled us to construct a phylogenetic structure of V. parahaemolyticus, which had not been

previously detected with traditional typing systems. This
would enhance the understanding of molecular epidemiology and evolution of this pathogen. Overall, the considerable gene acquisition/loss promoted the genetic
diversification of V. parahaemolyticus strains to form distinct clonal or semi-clonal complexes. In particular, we
identified two different clonal complexes 'old-O3:K6
clone' and 'pandemic clone'. The pandemic clone
included all the 39 pandemic group members tested,
which confirmed the previous notion [10-12]. It is the
first report of the old-O3:K6 clone consisting of 12 pre1996 old O3:K6 strains tested herein.
A major conclusion of this study was the depiction of an
evolutionary history of the pandemic group (clone).
Strains of new-O3:K6 and its serovariants (post-1996
O4:K68, O1:K25, O1:KUT and O6:K18) constituted the
pandemic group. New-O3:K6 was emerged from the oldO3:K6 clone by the stepwise acquisition of genomic
islands. A small group of O3:K6 strains (named as the
intermediate-O3:K6 clade) served as the phylogenetic
intermediate between new-O3:K6 and old-O3:K6. The

differentiation of O/K antigen genes promoted the derivation of new-O3:K6 serovariants from new-O3:K6.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
One hundred and seventy four strains of V. parahaemolyticus were used in the M-CGH assay [see Additional file 1].
Two of them, S072 and S004, were used as reference
strains in microarray analysis. Strain S072 is a post-1996
pandemic O3:K6 isolate, while the later one is a pre-1996
O3:K6 strain. Bacteria were grown in the LB-2% NaCl agar
at 37°C, and the extraction of genomic DNA was performed by the classical phenol/chloroform method.
Construction of DNA microarray
Gene-specific primer pair was designed to amplify the
almost whole-length of each annotated gene of strain
RIMD2210633. A total of 4660 genes representing about
96% of V. parahaemolyticus genome were amplified successfully, using the genomic DNA of strain S072 or S004
as template. The purified PCR products were spotted in
duplicate on the CSS-1000 silylated glass slides (CEL) by
using a SpotArray72 Microarray Printing System (Perkin
Elmer Life Sciences) with 32 Telechem SMP3 Stealth Pins
(4 × 8 Layout) to construct the DNA microarrays.
DNA labeling and microarray hybridization
The genomic DNA mixture of S072 and S004 with equal
quantity was used as 'Reference DNA'. Genomic DNA
from each of the V. parahaemolyticus isolates studied was
referred to as 'Test DNA'. Cy3- or Cy5- labeled probes were
generated by priming of the Reference or Test DNA with
random hexamers and extension with Klenow [27]. The
labeled Reference and Test DNA were combined to
hybridize with the microarrays by the dual-fluorescence
hybridization method [27]. All hybridizations were performed in duplicate. Pairwise comparisons were made for
each strain using dye swaps to avoid labeling bias.
Microarray data mining
The hybridized slides were scanned by using a GenePix
Personal 4100A Microarray Scanner (Axon Instruments).
The scanning images were processed and the data were
further analyzed by using GenePix Pro 5.0 software (Axon
Instruments) combined with Microsoft Excel software.
Spots with signal intensity (median) in the channel of Reference DNA less than two folds of local background intensity (median) were rejected from further analysis. Spots
with bad data because of slide abnormalities were discarded as well. Data normalization was performed on the
remaining spots by total intensity normalization methods. A ratio of intensity (Test DNA normalized intensity/
Reference DNA normalized intensity) was recorded for
each spot and then was converted to log2. Genes with
fewer than three data points were considered unreliable,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/570

and were accordingly removed. The averaged log2 ratio for
each remaining gene on the two replicate slides was ultimately calculated. If 20% of the strains had a gene with
missing data, the gene was removed. A total of 4021 genes
were included in the final dataset. A log2 value equal to or
lower than -1 was taken as defining the absence of a gene
in given strain.
Clustering and phylogenetic analysis
The final absent (0) or present (1) call was assigned to
each gene for each strain in the M-CGH data, and analyzed by BioNumerics Version 5.01 (Applied Maths).
Clustering was carried out subsequently by the
unweighted-pair group method using average linkages
(UPGMA), to calculate a similarity matrix. A minimum
spanning tree was built based on the similarity matrix.
The clustered microarray data were displayed by the
TreeView tool [29].
PCR analysis
Bacterial genomic DNAs to be tested were arrayed in 96well PCR plates. Each gene-specific primer pair [see Additional file 2] was pre-tested with the Reference DNA as
template, to ensure the successful amplification. A volume
of 25 μl PCR mixture contained 50 mM KCl, 10 mM TrisHCl (pH8.0), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 0.1% BSA,
100 μM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 0.1 μM of
each primer, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (MBI), and 10
ng of template DNA. The parameters for amplification
were as follows: 95°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30
s, an appropriate annealing temperature for 30 s, and
72°C for 1 min; and a final extension step of 72°C for 5
min. PCR products were analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining.
