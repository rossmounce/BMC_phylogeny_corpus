Abstract
Background: In the past, rice genome served as a good model for studies involving comparative
genomics of grass species. More recently, however, Brachypodium distachyon genome has emerged
as a better model system for genomes of temperate cereals including wheat. During the present
study, Brachypodium EST contigs were utilized to resolve orthologous relationships among the
genomes of Brachypodium, wheat and rice.
Findings: Comparative sequence analysis of 3,818 Brachypodium EST (bEST) contigs and 3,792
physically mapped wheat EST (wEST) contigs revealed that as many as 449 bEST contigs were
orthologous to 1,154 wEST loci that were bin-mapped on all the 21 wheat chromosomes. Similarly
743 bEST contigs were orthologous to specific rice genome sequences distributed on all the 12 rice
chromosomes. As many as 183 bEST contigs were orthologous to both wheat and rice genome
sequences, which harbored as many as 17 SSRs conserved across the three species. Primers
developed for 12 of these 17 conserved SSRs were used for a wet-lab experiment, which resolved
relatively high level of conservation among the genomes of Brachypodium, wheat and rice.
Conclusion: The present study confirmed that Brachypodium is a better model than rice for
analysis of the genomes of temperate cereals like wheat and barley. The whole genome sequence
of Brachypodium, which should become available in the near future, will further facilitate greatly the
studies involving comparative genomics of cereals.

Background
Cereals constitute the most important group of cultivated
plants, and are known to have diverged from a common
paleopolyploid ancestor ~45–47 million years ago (Mya)
[1]. Despite this, a remarkable overall structural and functional similarity exists among different cereal genomes
[2,3], although the size of these genomes differs greatly,
ranging from 430 Mb in rice (Oryza sativa) to 16,000 Mb
in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). Due to its small
size and availability of whole genome sequence, rice has
been used as a model system for a variety of experimental

studies including map-based cloning [4]. However, recent
studies resolved further the dynamic changes in rice
genome sequences, thus questioning the utility of rice as
a model crop [5], and necessitating the need for search of
a more efficient model system.
Brachypodium distachyon, a small temperate grass (subfamily Pooideae) has recently emerged as a better model
system for the study of temperate grasses. This is particularly, due to several of its desirable biological features and
its phylogenetic position [6,7]. It is postulated that rela-

tive to rice genome, Brachypodium genome will exhibit a
much higher level of colinearity and synteny to the
genomes of temperate cereal crops. In the present study,
the available Brachypodium EST contigs (bEST contigs) and
supercontigs were utilized to explore further the utility of
the Brachypodium genome as a model for carrying out
comparative genomics studies in cereals in general, and
for wheat genomics in particular. The relationship of
Brachypodium genome with wheat and rice genomes has
been examined for this purpose, and improved criteria of
sequence similarity search were used for more accurate
estimation of similarity [8].

Results
In the present study, EST sequences from Brachypodium
were utilized to find out the degree of similarity of Brachypodium genome with EST/genomic sequences of wheat
and rice. The orthologous wheat sequences thus identified
were also utilized to study the relationship of wheat
genome sequences with Brachypodium supercontigs. We
have also taken note of the comparisons of chloroplast
genomes among eight grass species, which were included
in the report on Brachypodium chloroplast genome
sequence that was recently worked out [9].
Orthology between Brachypodium and wheat
As many as 3,818 B. distachyon EST contigs were blasted
(BLASTN) against the available wheat EST contigs (containing bin-mapped wESTs) to identify matching wESTs.
The analysis revealed that as many as 449 bEST contigs
had orthologs in wheat genome.
Analysis of mapped wEST contigs that matched bEST
contigs
The above 449 bEST contigs were homologous with a corresponding number of wESTs carrying 1,154 bin-mapped
loci or regions giving an average of 2.57 loci per wEST contig (Figures 1, 2). The distribution of ortholoci on the

three wheat sub-genomes (A, B and D) and among the
seven homoeologous groups of chromosomes (Table 1)
was non-random (P << 0.05), when the known chromosome lengths and their DNA contents were used as the
basis [10]. The distribution of ortholoci on long and short
arms of the chromosomes (excluding 37 loci, which could
not be assigned to individual arms) was also non-random
(P < 0.05). This non-random distribution of ortholoci is,
however, based on limited data.
Of the above 449 matched wEST contigs (orthologous to
bEST contigs), 77 (17.2%) represented unique loci, and
the remaining 372 (82.8%) detected multiple loci with
283 (76.1%) having multiple loci on homoeologous
chromosomes and 89 (23.9%) having multiple loci on
non-homoeologous chromosomes.
Of the 1,154 orthologous loci with known positions on
wheat chromosomes, 1,094 (94.8%) loci were known to
have earlier been assigned to 159 chromosome bins
defined by deletion break points. The remaining 60
(5.2%) loci could be assigned only to individual chromosomes or their arms. A maximum of 386 loci (35.3%)
were mapped in the proximal regions (60% of the arm
length from centromere; C-0.60) followed by 331 loci
(30.3%) mapped to the distal regions (40% terminal arm
length; 0.60–1.00). The remaining 377 loci (34.4%) were
mapped to the interstitial bins having proximal and distal
regions.
The above 449 mapped wheat orthologs were also used
for homology search among Brachypodium supercontigs.
The wheat EST contigs located on homoeologous group 4
chromosomes had maximum homology (54.5% of
mapped contigs) with the Brachypodium super_1 contig. In
contrast, Brachypodium super_0 to 2 contigs had homology with wEST contigs dispersed on all the seven homoeologous groups, although no redundancy for wheat
homologues was observed within the above supercontigs
(Table 2).
Orthology between bEST contigs and rice genome
sequences
The BLASTN results of 3,818 bEST contigs against the rice
genome sequences identified as many as 743 matching
bEST contigs (see methods), which had homologues distributed on all the 12 chromosomes of rice. On the basis of
relative length (Mb) of chromosomes and their arms [11],
the ortholoci on 12 rice chromosomes/arms were non-randomly distributed (P <<< 0.05) (Table 3; Figure 3).
Conserved orthologous sequences among Brachypodium,

In the present study, 183 orthologous sequences were
conserved among all the three species (Brachypodium,

wheat and rice). As many as 126 of the 183 orthologous
sequences also confirmed known homology between
wheat-rice chromosomes. Functional annotation of these
183 orthologous sequences suggested that a majority
(137; 74.8%) of these bEST contigs matched with proteins
of known functions (see Additional file 1; Figure 4).
Conservation of SSRs among the three genomes
The 183 bEST contig sequences shared by three species
(Brachypodium, wheat and rice) were also used for mining
SSRs. A total of 100 (54.6%) bEST contigs contained 137
SSRs. As many as 45 of these SSRs showed conservation in
wheat and 23 of these SSRs showed conservation in rice.
As many as 17 SSRs were conserved across all the three
species.
Transferability of conserved orthologous SSRs
In order to validate experimentally the conservation of
Brachypodium SSRs among the genomes of wheat and rice,
primer pairs for SSRs belonging to 12 orthologs were synthesized and used for PCR amplification of the SSRs
(Table 4). All the 12 primer pairs gave amplification products in wheat and rice (Figure 5).

Discussion
Comparative genomics among grasses initially focused on
the analysis of colinearity (gene order) and synteny (gene
content) among DNA markers mapped on individual
chromosome at a low resolution (10 cM). This led to the
identification of 30 rice-independent linkage blocks

involved in the constitution of all cereal genomes and
allowed identification of a number of rearrangements
within individual genomes [12]. However, due to the
availability of whole genome sequence of rice, and substantial partial sequences from other cereal genomes,
emphasis shifted to a comparison of nucleic acid
sequences. In particular, sequences of ~7000 bin-mapped
wESTs were aligned with rice genome sequences [13],
allowing improved resolution and discovery of many
more rearrangements.
Although rice worked well as a model for all grasses
including wheat, and generated useful information,
Brachypodium, belonging to subfamily Pooideae (wheat
also belongs to Pooideae), is proposed as a better model
than rice (subfamily Ehrhartoideae). Recent studies have
suggested that relative to rice, Barchypodium is more
closely related to wheat and barley and the colinearity
between Barchypodium and wheat is better than that
between wheat and rice [14,15]. Chloroplast sequencebased phylogenetic analysis in eight grass species also suggested that Brachypodium is closer to the tribe Triticeae [9].
The possible estimated time of divergence between Brachypodium and Triticeae is also shorter (35 Mya) than that of
divergence between wheat and rice (50 Mya) [16] thus
supporting the view that Brachypodium is more closely
related with the members of Triticeae.
During the present study, orthologous relationship
among bEST contigs, wEST contigs and rice genome
sequences was studied using improved criteria of
sequence comparison. Observation of higher number of
bEST contigs showing orthology with rice genome was

mainly attributed to the fact that only a small fraction of
wheat genome (0.02%) and almost complete rice genome
(95%) were used for sequence comparison with the available Brachypodium EST contigs. If we take into account the
proportion of the genome used for comparison, it may be
concluded that wheat has higher level of orthology with
Brachypodium than with rice.
The mapped loci in different deletion bins of a particular
chromosome of wheat matched with same or different
supercontigs of Brachypodium. For instance, wheat group 4
chromosomes are highly syntenic to Brachypodium
super_1 contig (54.5%) than to other supercontigs,
although super_1 contig showed homology with other
homoeologous groups also. The mapping information of
these Brachypodium supercontigs on individual Brachypodium chromosomes will be useful for developing markers
specific to the targeted regions of wheat chromosomes.
It was also observed that although D sub-genome of
wheat is smaller in size, the orthologous loci mapped on
this sub-genome are no fewer than those mapped on subgenome B, suggesting closer relationship between Brachypodium and Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the D subgenome of hexaploid wheat.
The relative abundance of orthologous loci on proximal
regions of chromosome arms in wheat is in agreement with

the earlier studies in wheat and rice [17]. It seems that
higher degree of sequence conservation coincides with the
low recombination proximal regions, which is understandable, since high recombination in terminal regions will
cause reshuffling of genes during evolution [18].

Conclusion
The results of the present study indicate that the availability of whole genome sequence of Brachypodium will be of
enormous relevance for comparative genomics, gene
annotation and evolutionary, structural and functional
genomic studies of large genomes of the Triticeae.

Methods
Brachypodium, wheat, rice sequence databases
A total of 3,818 Brachypodium EST (bEST) contigs, and a
set of 1,015 supercontigs representing 4× coverage of
Brachypodium genome, were available in public domain
[19,20]. As many as 3,792 wheat EST (wEST) contigs containing bin-mapped wESTs were available at GrainGenes
2.0 [21] and rice genomic sequences were available at
Gramene [22].
Sequence comparisons
In order to find orthology among Brachypodium, wheat
and rice genomes, bEST contigs were blasted against wEST
contigs and rice genomic sequences. The pairwise
sequence alignment in BLASTN search was improved by

using three new parameters [8]. The first parameter,
aligned length (AL), corresponds to the sum of the lengths
of all the high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) in a single
hit. Second parameter, cumulative identity percentage
(CIP) was obtained from the formula, CIP = [Σ Id of
HSPs/AL] × 100 and the third parameter, cumulative
alignment length percentage (CALP) was calculated as follows: CALP = [AL/QL] × 100, where, QL is the length of
query sequence. Last two parameters (CIP and CALP)
allow estimation of highest similarity between sequences
over the entire length of query sequence. These parameters were applied to all the BLASTN results and values of
60% CIP and 70% CALP were used for identification of
orthologs of Brachypodium genomic sequences in wheat
(through ESTs) and rice genomes.
Mapping of wheat and rice orthologs
The physical positions of wEST orthologs identified
through sequence comparisons were localized to specific
bins of wheat chromosomes based on the information
about mapped wEST sequences [23]. The rice genomic
sequences, which were orthologous to bEST contigs, were
also known and were physically localized to specific sites
on 12 different rice chromosomes with the help of KaryoView program [24]. The χ2 test for goodness-of-fit was
used for testing the random distribution of ortholoci in
wheat genome at the level of the three sub-genomes, the
seven homoeologous groups, the 21 chromosomes and
the 42 chromosome arms. The same was done for the 12
chromosomes of rice.
Assignment of putative function to orthologs
The orthologous sequences belonging to the three genomes
(Brachypodium, wheat and rice) were subjected to BLASTX
analysis against non-redundant protein database [25] for
assigning putative functions at a cut-off E value of 10-30.
Identification of SSRs in orthologs
The orthologous sequences available in all the three
genomes were mined for simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
using SSRIT program [26]. The SSRs with a repeat motif of
2–6 nucleotides and a length of ≥ 12 bp were included in
the analysis. Primers were designed for the 12 conserved
SSRs using PRIMER3 [27].
Wet-lab analysis
Primers for 12 conserved Brachypodium SSRs were synthesized from Invitrogen, USA. PCR was performed separately using the genomic DNA of Brachypodium, wheat and
rice in a final volume of 20 μl in an Applied Biosystems
'Veriti Thermal Cycler'. After electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gels were silver stained following Tegelstrom [28].
