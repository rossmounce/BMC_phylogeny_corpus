Abstract
Background: It has been demonstrated that a reliable and fail-safe sequencing strategy is
mandatory for high-quality analysis of mitochondrial (mt) DNA, as the sequencing and base-calling
process is prone to error. Here, we present a high quality, reliable and easy handling manual
procedure for the sequencing of full mt genomes that is also appropriate for laboratories where
fully automated processes are not available.
Results: We amplified whole mitochondrial genomes as two overlapping PCR-fragments
comprising each about 8500 bases in length. We developed a set of 96 primers that can be applied
to a (manual) 96 well-based technology, which resulted in at least double strand sequence coverage
of the entire coding region (codR).
Conclusion: This elaborated sequencing strategy is straightforward and allows for an
unambiguous sequence analysis and interpretation including sometimes challenging phenomena
such as point and length heteroplasmy that are relevant for the investigation of forensic and clinical
samples.

Background
Investigations of the human mt genome are in the focus
of biological and medical scientific disciplines. Compared
to nuclear DNA (nDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
is more vulnerable to oxidative damage and undergoes a
higher rate of mutation [1]. Because of these features the
analysis of the mt genome has become a proven tool in
population genetics. A multi-copy genome without
recombination which accumulates mutations allows for
the establishment of phylogenetic trees [2]. It was the
information from the highly variable mitochondrial control region (CR) that lifted the secret of human evolution
starting in Africa about 150000 years ago and gave an

insight in human migration all over the world within the
past 60000 years [3,4]. Sequences of full mt genomes are
necessary to decipher yet not defined haplotypes and
assign them to their phylogeographic environment.
Mitochondrial DNA mutations in the coding region
(codR) have been associated with several pathologies [5]
including cancer [6-9]. During oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) mitochondria produce reactive oxidative species (ROS) that potentially induce DNA mutations. Such
an initial mutation is heteroplasmic with the mutated variant constituting a minority [10]. In the course of several
replications the heteroplasmic mutation may become

dominant leading to cancer [8]. This theory is based on
the results of several investigations on cancer tissues [1118]. Unfortunately, numerous articles addressing that
issue are erroneous as reviewed in [19,20]. On the one
hand it is the lack of phylogenetic knowledge and the
ambiguous mtDNA alignment that led to false conclusions of mtDNA mutations to be tumor-specific rather
than evolutionary caused. On the other hand, laboratory, sequencing-, and analysis errors led to wrong base-calls
[21]. Hence, flawed data hamper a precise interpretation
of the conjunction between mtDNA mutations and the
complex process of tumor development.
For forensic as well as for phylogenetic purposes we have
already successfully established evaluated sequencing
strategies that proved to be useful in a number of investigations where precise base-calling was necessary for the
CR [22-26], however such stringency is lacking for the
whole mt genome. The published protocols vary concerning the number and sizes of PCR products, the chemistry
employed, and the number of sequencing primers [2731]. One review reports the use of 58 sets of unique
sequencing primers to completely cover the mt genome,
while another protocol provides 77 sequencing primers
for the codR and 7 additional primers for the CR [27].
There, sequencing is performed on 12 amplicons that
cover the whole mt genome in an overlapping manner
[29]. In a recent protocol [28] the amplification of the
entire mt genome was conducted with only two overlapping amplicons, followed by 48 upstream and downstream sequencing reactions. Whereas amplicon sizes
must be kept short for forensic samples for reasons of limited DNA quality and quantity, a reduction of the necessary amplicons is desirable for other applications, where

usually fresh DNA is obtained. This simplifies the laboratory work and minimizes potential amplicon mix-up [19].
Independent of the amplification strategy high sequence
quality is required to achieve reliable base-calling.
We addressed this issue by presenting a set of 96 carefully
selected sequencing primers that are embedded in a reliable and fail-safe sequencing strategy. The following criteria were applied to guide the development. (1) Each
nucleotide reported in the consensus sequence should
derive from at least two independent sequencing reactions
using different primers (double strand coverage) to avoid
the reporting of phantom mutations and other ambiguous base-callings. (2) We envision a minimum number of
PCR products to reduce the chance for amplicon mix-up
during the (manual) set-up of sequencing reactions and
(3) we selected primers that produce sequences with an
optimal signal-to-noise ratio to enable unequivocal
assignment of point and length heteroplasmy.

Results
Methodical procedure
The complete mtDNA was amplified using 2 overlapping
fragments each about 8.5 kb in length with primers published in [28]. Fragment A ranges within nucleotide positions 2499 and 10837, fragment B between 10672 and
2669 comprising the CR (Table 1, Figure 1, step3).

The sensitivity of the amplification reaction was elicited
with 1000, 2500, 5000, and 10000 molecules of quantified mtDNA [32]. PCR yield and specificity were visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 2).
Even though the density of the banding pattern varied significantly (depending on the amplified DNA amount),

the sequence analysis of all fragments resulted in comparably clear data (Figure 3, right). Also the amount of 1000
mtDNA genomic equivalents (GEs) that roughly corresponds to the mtDNA content of a single lymphocyte
(fresh sample) proved sufficient for reliable results (given
that the mtDNA is intact). PCR products showed light
smear on the polyacrylamide gel (Figure 2), especially
with increasing template amount. However, we did not
observe negative effects on the quality of the sequencing
results (Figure 3). No evidence of contamination was
observed, neither in the non-template controls nor during
evaluation of the individual mtDNA haplotypes. Both
extraction blanks and PCR negative controls were free of
signal. The mtDNA of two tissues (breast and blood) was
extracted, amplified and sequenced from each person at
different times and corresponding haplotypes gave a

Amplicons were purified according to two different protocols. We compared an enzymatic digestion method with a
filtration method (Figure 2). We did not observe significant differences with respect to the DNA amount after
purification except for one sample. There, the banding signal of the ExoSAP-IT purified product was less dense as
compared to the filtrated one. However, despite of the different banding intensities (Figure 2) we did not observe
relevant changes in sequencing quality between the electropherograms (Figure 3). The filtration method has the
appealing advantage that it is less expensive for PCR product purification of few samples present in large volumes
(up to 0.5 ml). One Microcon column is needed for each

sample irrespective of the DNA volume to be added,
whereas the required amount of ExoSAP-IT is required to
be proportional to the volume of DNA (2 μL per 5 μL
PCR-product).
We established a set of 96 sequencing primers that lead to
full double-sequence coverage of the complete mtDNA
codR (Figure 4). Primer sequences were partly taken from
[29,33] and http://insertion.stanford.edu/primers as well
as designed inhouse [34]. In combination with sequences
obtained from the CR [35] this resulted in high-quality
sequence information for the whole mtDNA genome.
Such a strategy makes sense, as full mt genome sequencing is usually carried out on selected samples that have
earlier been analyzed within the CR. Sequencing was performed on the basis of the Big Dye Terminator Ready
Reactions Kit protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The quality of the primers was generally stable
despite of multiple freezing/thawing cycles of the stock
primer plate. For 6 primers (R4, R7, R18, R20, R21, F14)
out of 96 the signal-to-noise ratio decreased after the fifth
freezing/thawing cycle. An example of the general quality
of the sequences is shown in Figure 5. The sequence is displayed by two primers in both directions confirming
point heteroplasmy of the variants A and G at position
2673 within the NADH dehydrogenase (ND2) gene.
Sequence electropherograms did not differ substantially
in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio as well as with respect
to the relative peak heights when comparing the tested
mtDNA template amounts. Although a relative increase of

the fluorescence signal in the raw data was detected (Figure 3, left), the quality of the sequence electropherograms
were comparable (Figure 3, right). In this study we tested
template mtDNA amounts between 1000 and 10000 GEs
that turned out to cover an appropriate template amount
range for long PCR fragments.
Data analysis and quality assurance
Upon analysis of the raw data the sequences were aligned
and the base-calls reviewed twice by two independent scientists, such as has been found invaluable for CR analysis
[35]. Consensus sequences were aligned and compared to
the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [36,37]
following nomenclature guidelines for mtDNA typing
[38-40]. In an independent analysis the two consensus
sequences underwent comparison by means of a dedicated in-house software [41,42]. This concept enabled full
electronic data handling minimizing the risk to introduce
clerical errors.
Assignment of the samples to their specific haplogroups
We present the complete mtDNA sequences of 10 clinical
samples from 5 patients with respect to the phylogeny
[43] (Figure 6) [sequences were deposited in GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/ with accession
numbers FJ384431–FJ384440]. These patients were classified as typical West-Eurasian lineages as members of
haplogroups W1d, T2b, V4, H5, and H15b [33,44,45]. As
shown in Figure 6 (highlighted in light grey), the mtDNA
sequences generated from the primary cancerous tissue
and the peripheral blood cells were identical in all 5
patients.

Discussion
We present a reliable laboratory strategy for the amplification and sequence analysis of the full mt genome that
meets a high quality demand. The method is conceived
for samples that include an adequate amount and quality
of DNA, such as found in fresh clinical and forensic samples and can be conducted by any laboratory in the molecular field without the requirement for automated liquid
handling devices. The complexity of the laboratory concept is low, so that handling errors and risk of sample mixup and contamination are minimized.
Effects of primer-storage on sequencing quality
It has been shown in this study that the sequence performance of the majority of primers was not affected by different storage conditions. Only 6 primers (R4, R7, R18, R20,
R21, F14) suffered from a treatment of more than 5 freezing/thawing cycles. Temperature changes caused a diminished function visualized by a disadvantageous signal-tonoise ratio depicted in the electropherogram. The ability
to correctly identify point heteroplasmy strongly depends
on the quality of the overall signal height and the signal-

to-noise ratio. Consequently, an apparent improvement
of the storing conditions would be the generation of stock
plates including less primer volume sufficient for about 5
sequencing reactions. Alternatively, sequencing primers
could be kept in a low tris buffer at 4°C.
Applications in various fields
Recent research has been addressing the role of mitochondria and the mtDNA in aging and cancer as mitochondria
participate in fundamental processes of the cellular
metabolism [46]. The mitochondrial theory of aging
implies that tissue function sustains until the number of
cells declines below a threshold. The time range required
to reach this threshold is related to the rate at which mitochondrial and mtDNA damage accumulates. If the mitochondrial ROS production rate increases, the rate of cell
loss will also increase, resulting in early tissue failure and
age-related disease.

Not only aging processes but also carcinogenesis have
been linked to mutation based mitochondrial dysfunction since a general feature of tumor biology is the

impaired energy metabolism [47]. For those investigations addressing aging and tumor biology, mitochondrial
genes encoded in the nucleus and in the mitochondrial
DNA are being analyzed. Genes encoded in the mitochondrial DNA can be systematically targeted with this evaluated sequencing strategy.
Furthermore, it can be helpful for population genetic and
forensic applications where further information to the CR
is required. In the forensic context this is particularly relevant for the few CR haplotypes that are shared more commonly within a population. In the West Eurasian
population this is the case for the CR haplotypes 16519C
263G 315.1C and 263G 315.1C, which occur at frequencies of 0.013 and 0.002, respectively [48]. When such haplotypes are observed in a forensic case between suspect
and crime scene samples one needs to consider the possibility that the sequences are identical by state and not by
descent. Especially, as it is known that these haplotypes
occur in more haplogroup backgrounds, such as H1, H2a,
H3, H7, H10, H13a1, HV, R0 and the great bulk of yet
unidentified sub-H lineages [26,49]. To increase the infor-

old of mutated mtDNA populations is achieved. All the
more it is important to pinpoint the relative quantity of
these heteroplasmic mutations to estimate functional
consequences of the genes involved. Moreover, good
sequencing quality is the prerequisite to distinguish early
stage point heteroplasmy from signal background which
might be an issue in early stage cancer detection [55].

mation content of such haplotypes we have earlier introduced a screening method based on single-base-extension
reactions that target informative SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphism) in the codR [50]. Such screening methods
are a valuable supplement to standard mtDNA sequencing as they generally increase the discrimination power
and indicate the hg-affiliation of an mtDNA haplotype
[49]. The logical continuation of this strategy would be
the analysis of entire mt genomes in forensic casework for
achieving maximum discrimination power. The current
sequencing technology allows that only for relatively high
sample qualities, but it is a first step towards mt genome
sequencing in forensics.
In the population genetic field an accurate deciphering of
the human mitochondrial phylogeny can only be conducted on the basis of full mt genomes. As a general
approach full genome mtDNA sequencing is carried out
on a defined selection of CR sequences as evidenced by
recent examples [51,52].
Meaning of obtaining high quality sequences
The focus of this strategy lies on applications where secure
base-calling and high quality sequence data are mandatory for interpretation. It is well known that mitochondrial mutations associated to disease such as
mitochondrial encephalomyopathies occur in heteroplasmic status and that the severity and the progression of the
syndrome depend on a threshold above which the mutant
triggers the pathological pathway [53,54]. The contribution of mtDNA mutations to carcinogenesis underlies the
same assumption. It appears evident that particular mitochondrial defects with functional consequences exhibit an
advantage in tumor development only if a certain thresh-

The occurrence and the frequency of mtDNA control
region (CR) point heteroplasmy is an important issue in
forensic case work [56] as the detection of point heteroplasmy, especially at low level, increases the power of discrimination between sequences [57].

Conclusion
The codR sequencing method described herein is an optimized protocol that can also be applied in laboratories
that do not have automated processes available. The overall aim, namely the achievement of a secure base-calling
method was accomplished by the assortment of primers
that allow for full double-stranded sequence coverage of
the whole mtDNA genome (in combination with previously described CR sequencing strategies). Particular care
was taken on the selection of the primers based on low
background signal that is crucial for the unambiguous
assessment of length and point heteroplasmy. Moreover,
we kept the complexity of the laboratory process as low as
possible. This was achieved by a 96- well based pipetting
format for cycle sequencing set-up using only two PCR
amplicons per sample which reduces the chances of contamination, handling error and sample mix-up.

with diagnosed invasive mamma carcinoma at the Clinical Department of Radiology, Innsbruck Medical University. They were immediately transferred into 1.5 mL vials
and extracted or frozen at -20°C and extracted within the
next 7 days. Corresponding blood samples were collected
independently. Peripheral blood samples were either
extracted upon receipt or frozen at -20°C and then processed within 7 days. There was full consent of the patients
to participate in this study. For the sensitivity study DNA
was extracted from peripheral blood of a healthy volunteer of European ancestry with informed consent.
DNA Extraction
The complete workflow is sketched in Figure 1. DNA was
extracted from biopsies and blood via the EZ1 Biorobot
workstation (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extraction was
based on the protocol of the investigator kit (Qiagen) for
extraction of blood and tissue samples, with modifications as follows: tissue samples (about 0.5 cm × 1 mm)
were digested with 15 μL proteinase K in 290 μL lysis

buffer (included in the kit) up to 4 hours and treated with
the "trace" protocol.
Primer Design
A total of 96 primers were used for singleplex reactions.
Primer sequences were taken from [29,33] and new primers were designed in this study with PRIMER 3 software
[34]. Possible heteroduplex formations, primer dimers
and hairpin structures were analyzed with OligoAnalyzer
free software: http://eu.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applica
tions/OligoAnalyzer/ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Melting temperature of primers was approximately 50°C and the GC-content was between 40 – 60%.
The settings for the calculations were: Oligo conc. n: 0.25
μM; Na+ conc.: 50 mM.
Amplification and Sequencing
For amplification we used the Advantage GC Genomic LA
Polymerase(Clontech, Bella Avenue Mountain View, California) including a small amount of proofreading

enzyme, a hot start antibody and a 3' to 5' proofreading
exonuclease activity. It enables synthesis of PCR products
of 8.5 kb using human genomic DNA templates.
Amplification reaction was carried out on a thermal cycler
(Multicycler PTC240 Tetrad2, Hercules, CA) in a total volume of 50 μL each fragment (A and B) comprising 2.5 mg/
mL BSA (St. Louis, Missouri), 2.5 mM each dNTP
(Applied Biosystems), 10 mM each primer, 5U LA
Genomic DNA polymerase (Clonetech) 1000 – 10000
mtDNA GEs. Thermal cycling conditions comprised an
initial 3 min denaturation step at 93°C, followed by 93°C
for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s and 68°C for 5 min 14 times proceeding 27 times with 93°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s and
68°C for 9 min increasing for 10 s each cycle. Amplicons
were purified from residual primers and dNTPs enzymatically with ExoSAP-IT (ExoSAP-IT, USB, Cleveland, Ohio)
and comparatively with a filtration method (Microcon
YM-30 Centrifugal Filter Units: Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts).

Excerpt 6 the West Eurasian phylogeny
Excerpt of the West Eurasian phylogeny. The samples we tested in this study were assigned to the following West Eurasian haplogroups and are highlighted: samples S007/008: W1d, samples S009/010: H5, samples S013/S014: T2b, samples S015/
S016: H15b samples S017/S018: V4. Position numbers refer to the rCRS [37] and designate transitions unless a suffix indicates
a transversion (A, C or T) and an insertion (+). Back mutations are marked with @.

From a 1.5 μM stock plate containing all 96 sequencing
primers (Figure 1, step 4), 2 μL were decanted into a new
plate right before each sequencing reaction. Big Dye Terminator mastermix (containing 1 μL BigDye Terminator
v1.1 Cycle Sequencing mix (Applied Biosystems) and 3 μL
BigDye Terminator v1.1 Sequencing Buffer (Applied Biosystems)), as well as 2 μL mtDNA Fragments A or B were
aliquoted into the appropriate wells as shown in Figure 1
(step 4). 2 μL distilled water was added to reach a final
volume of 10 μL. Pipetting those small volumes was performed using an 8-channel epMotion workstation
(Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Cycle sequencing
was performed (after a first denaturation step of 95°C for
1 min) for 25 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 5 s at 50°C, and 4
min at 60°C.
Post sequencing cleanup
Sequencing reaction products were purified from residual
dye terminators using Sephadex G-50 Fine (Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and Multiscreen filter plates (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cycle sequencing products were diluted by
adding 10 μL of distilled water and the dilutions were centrifuged through the filter plate into an optical 96-well
plate for electrophoretic separation. The entire procedure

of diluting cycle sequencing products and transferring the
dilutions onto the Sephadex columns in the filter plate
was again performed by the epMotion workstation. When
spinning cycle sequencing products through the filter
plate, unequal amounts of product may be recovered
throughout the plate. In order to avoid this, the blocks'
orientations in the centrifuge carriage were reversed after
2.5 min and the blocks were spun a second time for 2.5
min to obtain consistent amounts of purified products.
The purified products were finally diluted by adding each
20 μL of distilled water to achieve volumes of 45 μL.
Capillary Electrophoresis
Electrophoretic separation was carried out on an ABI 3100
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using POP6 and
a 36 cm capillary array. The run module conditions were
as follows: injection time: 22 s, injection voltage: 1 kV, run
voltage: 15 kV, run current: 10 μAmps, run temperature:
55°C.
