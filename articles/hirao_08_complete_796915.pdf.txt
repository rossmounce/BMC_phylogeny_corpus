Abstract
Background: The recent determination of complete chloroplast (cp) genomic sequences of
various plant species has enabled numerous comparative analyses as well as advances in plant and
genome evolutionary studies. In angiosperms, the complete cp genome sequences of about 70
species have been determined, whereas those of only three gymnosperm species, Cycas taitungensis,
Pinus thunbergii, and Pinus koraiensis have been established. The lack of information regarding the
gene content and genomic structure of gymnosperm cp genomes may severely hamper further
progress of plant and cp genome evolutionary studies. To address this need, we report here the
complete nucleotide sequence of the cp genome of Cryptomeria japonica, the first in the
Cupressaceae sensu lato of gymnosperms, and provide a comparative analysis of their gene content
and genomic structure that illustrates the unique genomic features of gymnosperms.
Results: The C. japonica cp genome is 131,810 bp in length, with 112 single copy genes and two
duplicated (trnI-CAU, trnQ-UUG) genes that give a total of 116 genes. Compared to other land
plant cp genomes, the C. japonica cp has lost one of the relevant large inverted repeats (IRs) found
in angiosperms, fern, liverwort, and gymnosperms, such as Cycas and Gingko, and additionally has
completely lost its trnR-CCG, partially lost its trnT-GGU, and shows diversification of accD. The
genomic structure of the C. japonica cp genome also differs significantly from those of other plant
species. For example, we estimate that a minimum of 15 inversions would be required to transform
the gene organization of the Pinus thunbergii cp genome into that of C. japonica. In the C. japonica cp
genome, direct repeat and inverted repeat sequences are observed at the inversion and
translocation endpoints, and these sequences may be associated with the genomic rearrangements.
Conclusion: The observed differences in genomic structure between C. japonica and other land
plants, including pines, strongly support the theory that the large IRs stabilize the cp genome.
Furthermore, the deleted large IR and the numerous genomic rearrangements that have occurred
in the C. japonica cp genome provide new insights into both the evolutionary lineage of coniferous
species in gymnosperm and the evolution of the cp genome.

Background
Since the first reports of the complete nucleotide
sequences of the tobacco [1] and liverwort [2] chloroplast
(cp) genomes, a number of other land plant cp genomic
sequences have been determined. These complete cp
genomic sequences have enabled various comparative
analyses, including phylogenetic studies, that are based
on these data [3-7]. In contrast, however, the complete cp
genome nucleotide sequences of only three gymnosperm
species, Cycas taitungensis [8], Pinus thunbergii [9], and
Pinus koraiensis [10] have been determined.
The cp genomes of gymnosperms, especially in coniferous
species, have distinctive features compared with those of
angiosperms, including paternal inheritance [11-17], relatively high levels of intra-specific variation [18-21], and
a different pattern of RNA editing [22]. Generally, the cp
genomes of angiosperms range in size from 130 to 160 kb,
and contain two identical inverted repeats (IRs) that
divide the genomes into large (LSC) and small single copy
(SSC) regions. The relative sizes of these LSC, SSC and IRs
remain constant, with both gene content and gene order
being highly conserved [23,24]. On the other hand, the
relative sizes of the gymnosperm IRs vary significantly
among taxa [25-27]; for example, the IRs of Ginkgo biloba
are 17 kbp [28], those of Cycas taitungensis are 23 kbp [8],
whereas those of Pinus thunbergii are very short, at just 495
bp [9,29]. It has been suggested that, like P. thunbergii,
some coniferous species also lack the large IRs that exist in
other gymnosperms [25,26,30,31]. This lack of IRs is considered to have preceded the extensive genomic rearrangements of the conifer cp genome [26]. Steane [32]
compared the complete cp genome of Eucalyptus globulus
with that of other angiosperm taxa and P. thunbergii, and
found that the cp genome of P. thunbergii was arranged
very differently to that of angiosperms. However, there is
only limited information available about the cp genomic
sequences of coniferous species, with the complete cp
genome nucleotide sequences of only two species of pine,
Pinus thunbergii [9] and Pinus koraiensis [10] in the family
Pinaceae, having been determined. The cp genomes of
these two pine species were very similar in terms of both
gene content and gene order and so provided little information about the complexity of the conifer cp genome.
In previous phylogenetic studies, of the four extant gymnosperm groups (Cycads, Conifers, Ginkgoales, and Gnetales), the conifers were considered to be divisible into two
distinct groups; a Pinaceae group and a group consisting
of five other families (Cupressaceae sensu lato, Taxaceae,
Podocarpaceae, Araucariaceae, and Sciadopityaceae)
[33,34]. The cp nucleotide sequences from this five member group, excluding the Pinaceae group, can provide
interesting information about the conifer cp genome, not
only in terms of genome structure but also concerning

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/70

their evolutionary history. Despite the lack of complete cp
genome sequences from any family member of the
Cupressaceae sensu lato, Tsumura et al. [27] suggested, on
the basis of physical maps and Southern hybridization
analyses, that the cp genome of Cryptomeria japonica differs from that of other land plants, including pine species,
in terms of genome size and gene order as well as in the
absence of the large IRs. Thus, the complete cp genome
sequence of C. japonica would drastically increase our
understanding of the divergence of coniferous cp genome
structures and gene content, and additionally clearly identify the differences with the Pinaceae group.
There are two particular questions that need to be
addressed using the complete cp genome sequence of C.
japonica: (1) how different is the C. japonica cp genome
from those of other plants, including gymnosperms, and
(2) is the loss of the large IRs involved with the instability
and diversification of the cp genome, especially between
coniferous groups? To respond to these questions, we
present in this paper the complete nucleotide sequence of
the cp genome of C. japonica [DDBJ: AP009377], and
compare its overall gene content and genomic structure
with those of two other angiosperms (Eucalyptus globulus
and Oryza sativa), a liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha), a
fern (Adiantum capillus), and two gymnosperms (Cycas taitungensis and Pinus thunbergii).

Results and Discussion
General characteristics of the C. japonica cp genome
The total size of the C. japonica cp genome was determined
to be 131,810 bp, which is larger than the cp genomes of
both P. thunbergii (119,707 bp) and M. polymorpha
(121,024 bp), but smaller than those of A. capillus
(150,568 bp), E. globulus (160,286 bp), and C. taitungensis
(163,403 bp), and approximately the same size as that of
O. sativa (134,558 bp). This size is only slightly smaller
than that previously estimated by RFLP southern hybridization analysis [27]. The large IR region, which is found in
other land plants except Pinus, could also not be observed
in the C. japonica cp genome, and so we were unable to
define the large (LSC) and small (SSC) single copy regions
in this genome. A total of 116 genes were identified in the
C. japonica cp genome, of which 112 genes were single
copy and two genes, trnI-CAU and trnQ-UUG, were duplicated and occurred as inverted repeat sequences. There
were four ribosomal RNA genes (3.5%), 30 individual
transfer RNA genes (25.9%), 21 genes encoding large and
small ribosomal subunits (18.1%), four genes encoding
DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (3.5%), 48 genes
encoding photosynthesis-related proteins (41.4%), and 9
genes encoding other proteins, including those with
unknown functions (7.8%). Among the 112 single copy
genes, 17 genes contained introns, and three genes, clpP,
trnT-GGU, and ycf68, were identified as pseudogenes. The

locations of the genes and pseudogenes are shown in Figure 1 (gene map) and Table 1 (gene content). The C.
japonica cp genome has an AT content of 64.6%, which is
higher than those of A. capillus (58.0%), C. taitungensis
(60.5%), O. sativa (61.0%), and P. thunbergii (61.2%),
similar to that of E. globulus (63.4%), but lower than that
of M. polymorpha (71.2%).
A marked difference in gene content between
gymnosperms including C. japonica
There are marked differences in several genes between
gymnosperms, even though the C. japonica cp genome
shares several common features with other plants, and
some of these are described below. For example, there is
considerable difference in gene content between C.

japonica and P. thunbergii; the 11 intact ndh (NADH dehydrogenase) genes found in C. japonica, as well as in five
other plants, are absent from P. thunbergii [9]. The loss of
these ndh genes is thought to be due to specific mutations
in the Pinus cp genome.
Another functional gene, rps16, which encodes a small
ribosomal subunit, is found in the angiosperms, E. globulus and O. sativa, in the fern, A. capillus, and in gymnosperms, C. taitungensis and C. japonica (Figure 2).
However, the location of rps16 is halfway between the
trnK-UUU and chlB genes in the cp genome of gymnosperms, and halfway between matK and chlB, and between
the trnK-UUU and trnQ-UUG genes in fern and
angiosperms, respectively. In contrast, rps16 is completely

Fugus, Krameria, Linum, Malpighia, Passiflora, Securidaca,
Turnera, Viola, Adonis, Medicago, Selaginella [36-41]. Doyle
et al. [38] postulated the functional transfer of rps16 from
the chloroplast to the nucleus in order to explain the
absence of this gene in such a large number of unrelated
taxa of land plants. Similarly, the loss of rps16 and its

The trnP-GGG and trnR-CCG genes are considered to be
pseudogenes, possibly relics of plastid genome evolution
in gymnosperms and moss [22,42,43]. The trnP-GGG

M. polymorpha, and in the fern, A. capillus, but not in

relic gene in a large number of gymnosperms. In contrast,
the trnR-CCG gene, which is found in P. thunbergii, C. taitungensis, M. polymorpha, and A. capillus, is absent from the
C. japonica and angiosperm cp genomes, suggesting that
trnR-CCG is not conserved in all gymnosperm cp
genomes and might have been completely lost in taxa,
such as Cupressaceae sensu lato, that have relatively
recently diverged during the long evolutionary history of
plants.
The tRNA gene, trnT-GGU, in the C. japonica cp genome
contains only 43 bp of its 3' end and was therefore too
short to form its complete secondary structure (Figure 3).
Furthermore, this trnT-GGU gene occurs as a single copy
gene in the cp genomes of A. capillus, M. polymorpha, E.
globulus, and O. sativa, is present as two copies in P. thunbergii, but is completely missing from the C. taitungensis cp
genome. In Pelagonium, the loss of trnT-GGU from its cp
genome has been considered to be associated with
genomic rearrangements [44]. Although this relationship
is considered further below, the duplication or incomplete lost of tRNA genes in P. thunbergii and C. japonica is
also thought to be associated with genome rearrangements. However, the question remains as to why the trnTGGU of C. taitungensis is completely lost despite the fact
that no genomic rearrangements were found in comparison with standard cp genomes, such as of E. globulus.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/70

it occurs as a pseudogene. Furthermore, the clpP gene is
co-transcribed with the 5'-end of the rps12 gene and the
rpl20 gene (M. polymorpha; [46], P. contorta; [47], O. sativa;
[48]), so that the clpP to rpl20 gene order is extremely conserved in the cp genomes of all the land plants of this
study. However, the clpP gene in the C. japonica cp genome
is found halfway between the psbJ and accD genes, and is
clearly not co-transcribed with the rps12-5'end and rpl20
genes (Figure 5). As the loss of function of the clpP gene in
the Adonis annua cp genome is thought to be due to
genome rearrangements (inverted mutations) [39], it is
possible that genome rearrangements are also the reason
why clpP is a non-functional pseudogene in the C. japonica
cp genome, as discussed further below.

Diversification of genes in the C. japonica cp genome
The accD gene, which encodes acetyl-CoA-carboxylase
(ACCase), is found in the cp genomes of all seven plants
analyzed in this study, however, their reading frame
lengths vary considerably. The reading frame length of the
C. japonica cp genome is 700 codons, which is larger than
that of A. capillus (309 codons), M. polymorpha (316
codons), P. thunbergii (321 codons), and C. taitungensis
(359 codons) (Figure 4). The alignments do not include
those of the angiosperms, E. globulus (490 codons), and
O. sativa (106 codons), because of the complicated nature
of the alignments. In monocot angiosperms, the accD
reading frame length is reduced from 106 codons in O.
sativa to zero in Z. mays, and this reduction is considered
to be the cause of accD loss in monocot species [45]. In
contrast to this reduction, the accD reading frame in coniferous species, especially in Cupressaceae sensu lato
including C. japonica, may have diversified in an increasing direction.

Although four major ycf genes have been partially characterized in the cp genomes of other land plants, their precise functions remain unclear to date. Four ycf genes, ycf1,
ycf2, ycf3, and ycf4, were also identified in the C. japonica
cp genome. The highly conserved ycf3 and ycf4 are
believed to be involved in the formation of photosystem
I in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [49]. The deduced amino
acid sequences of the ycf3 and ycf4 products show 81–
96% and 71–76% sequence identity, respectively, with
their homologues in other land plants. In contrast, ycf1
and ycf2 show considerable divergence relative to other
land plants, with their deduced proteins having only 24–
54% (partially 54% identity with that of P. thunbergii) and
25–37% sequence identity, respectively, with their homologues in other land plants. The two divergent ycf1 and
ycf2 genes are thought to be involved in cellular metabolism or to play a structural role in plastids [50]. Both the
maize and rice cp genomes lack these two reading frames
[45,51], and the results from the present comparative
analysis show that there are no regions homologous to
ycf1 and ycf2 in C. japonica. Furthermore, although the
ycf68 gene of C. japonica shows 63% identity to that of P.
thunbergii, the C. japonica ycf68 may not encode a protein.
The ycf68 sequence, which occurs in the trnI-GAU intron,
could represent a functional protein encoding gene in
rice, corn, and Pinus, although alignments of the ycf68
region in 14 angiosperms revealed that, in the majority of
cases, it contained numerous frameshifts and stop codons
[52]. Similarly, we found numerous frameshifts and stop
codons in the ycf68 region, although the C. japonica and
C. taitungensis ycf68 regions have a comparatively high
level of homology with that of P. thunbergii (Figure 6).

The clpP gene, which encodes a proteolytic subunit of the
ATP-dependent Clp protease, is found intact in the cp
genomes of the six land plants, C. taitungeinsis, E. globulus,
A. capillus, and M. polymorpha, with three exons and two
introns, and in the P. thunbergii and O. sativa cp genomes
with no introns [22]. However, in the C. japonica cp
genome, only the second exon of the gene remains and so

Loss of large IR region within coniferous cp genomes
Figure 7 details the gene order and locations of the LSC,
SSC, and IRs of the cp genomes of the seven land plants,
E. globulus (A), O. sativa (B), A. capillus (C), M. polymorpha

one of the large inverted repeats (IRs) that are found in the

Percentage identity plots and gene order surrounding the clpP gene
Percentage identity plots and gene order surrounding the clpP gene. Gene identities between C. japonica and C. taitungensis (A), and between C. taitungensis and six other plants including C. japonica (B-G) are shown by MultiPipMaker. The
directions of arrows indicate the transcribed sense/antisense strands. The colored boxes show the group of genes and the relevant coding region of each gene. Mutual comparisons of the clpP gene between C. japonica and C. taitungensis (A, B), show the
first and third exon are completely absence in the C. japonica cp genome. For the gene order surrounding the clpP gene, the
clpP to rpl20 gene order is extremely conserved to be co-transcribed in the cp genomes of all the land plants of this study (see
Figure 7 for the detailed gene order). On the other hand, the clpP gene in the C. japonica cp genome is found halfway between
the psbJ and accD gene, and is clearly not co-transcribed with the rps12 and rpl20 genes.

Alignment of the ycf68 regions of seven land plant cp genomes. Sequences of the ycf68 region of P. thunbergii and O.
sativa were obtained from databases of each complete cp genome sequence, and relevant regions of the other plants were
obtained by alignment with that of P. thunbergii or O. sativa. Codons highlighted in red represent stop codons.

cp genomes of other plants. When compared to the C. taitungensis cp genome (Figure 7E), which has a large IR
region, the corresponding IR of the C. japonica cp genome
was divided into two segments, and the relevant SSC
region was divided into three segments (Figure 7G). Similarly, in the P. thunbergii cp genome, the relevant IR
region was divided into three segments (Figure 7F).
Although the IR of P. thunbergii, which is 495-bp in
length, contains a duplicated trnI-CAU gene and a partial
psbA gene (red boxes in Figure 7F), presumably due to
incomplete loss of the large IR [29], the IRs of Pinus cp
genomes are thought to be structurally different from
those of other plants, being composed of two or more
genes including the trnI-CAU gene. There are two pairs of
short inverted repeats in the C. japonica cp genome, consisting of 284-bp and 114-bp inverted repeats containing
duplicated trnQ-UUG (white arrows in Figure 7G) and
trnI-CAU (black arrows in Figure 7G) genes, respectively.

Figure 7 and cp genomic architecture of the seven land plant species, including C. japonica
Gene order
Gene order and cp genomic architecture of the seven land plant species, including C. japonica. Each colored gene
segment shows the same gene order region among the seven land plants cp genomes. Gray, blue and orange boxes for each
gene order show the relevant regions of LSC (Large Single Copy), SSC (Small Single Copy) and IR (Inverted Repeat) regions in
the E. globulus (A), O. sativa (B), A. capillus (C), M. polymorpha (D), and C. taitungensis (E) cp genomes, respectively. In the P. thunbergii (F) and C. japonica (G) cp genomes, gray, blue and orange boxes show the relevant regions of the SSC and IR regions of
the C. taitungensis cp genome. Red boxes in the P. thunbergii cp genome show the defined IR in the P. thunbergii cp genome. In
the C. japonica cp genome, the black and white arrows show duplicated genes; trnI-CAU (black arrows), trnQ-UUG (white
arrows).

Based on the defined IRs of the Pinus cp genome, the
residual IR of C. japonica may be the 114-bp inverted
repeat containing the duplicated trnI-CAU gene. However,
it is structurally different from the IRs of other plants that
contain several duplicated genes in their cp genomes.

Structural differences between cp genomes of C. japonica
and other land plants
In addition to the loss of the large IR, genome rearrangements appear to have played an important role in the evolution of the coniferous cp genome. Harr-plot analyses
also indicate that the cp genome of C. japonica has lost its
large IR and that its structure differs significantly from that
of the cp genomes of the other six plants in terms of gene
order. We estimated the minimum rearrangements via
inversions in pairwise comparisons of cp genomes in
order to determine the structural differences between cp
genomes (Table 2), even though inversions may not be

the only mutational events causing gene order changes in
the cp genome. A minimum of five inversions would be
required to transform the gene structure of the gymnosperm C. taitungensis cp genome into that of the
angiosperm E. globulus cp genome (Table 2, additional file
1A). In contrast, many genome rearrangements have
occurred in the cp genomes of coniferous species within
gymnosperms; we found that deletion of the large IR and
a minimum of 12 inversions would be required to transform the gene structure of the C. taitungensis cp genome
into that of C. japonica (Table 2, Figure 8A), and that deletion of the large IR and a minimum of seven inversions
would be required to transform the gene structure of the
C. taitungensis cp genome into that of P. thunbergii (Table
2, additional file 1B). Furthermore, it is interesting to note
that 15 inversions would be required to transform the
gene structure of C. japonica into that of P. thunbergii
(Table 2, Figure 8B).
The large IR is thought to stabilize the cp genome against
major structural rearrangements [53-55]. Among
angiosperm species, structural changes in the cp genome
have occurred within tribes of the legume family
(Fabaceae), which have also lost their IR, and so it appears
that most genomes that have lost their IRs have under-

gone more rearrangements than those that have not
[53,56]. With respect to other conifers, it has been shown
that Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and radiata pine
(Pinus radiata) lack the large IR, and that both of these
conifer genomes have undergone a greater number of
rearrangements relative to ferns, angiosperms, and even
Ginkgo, a gymnosperm [26]. The differences in genome
structure between C. japonica and other land plants,
including pines, strongly confirms that the presence of
large IRs plays a role in the structural stability of the cp
genome.
Tsumura et al. [27] suggested that the cp genome structure
of C. japonica differs significantly from that of pine species, implying that independent changes have occurred
and that no simple evolutionary path can be determined.
In fact, phylogenetic studies have revealed the significant
divergence of Coniferales [33,34], with a phylogenetic
tree using the rbcL gene in one of these studies indicating
that C. japonica (Cupressaceae sensu lato) and pine species (Pinaceae) are not very closely related and are in fact
located in different clade (additional file 2 in this study).
In a study of 18 Campanulaceae species, Cosner et al. [57]
suggested that data regarding cp genome rearrangements
were useful for inferring phylogenetic relationships, and

Harr plot analyses comparing the cp genome of C. japonica with those of C. taitungensis and P. thunbergii
Harr plot analyses comparing the cp genome of C. japonica with those of C. taitungensis and P. thunbergii. Each
dotplot shows the positions where 45 out of 50 nucleotides match in the two sequences. The plot analysis was carried out
using Pipmaker software. Sequences along the Y-axis are set from the top to the bottom, and along the X-axis are from left to
right. Relative lengths of sequences are shown to the side and below the boxes. The colored gene segments along the X- and
Y-axes correspond with common gene units of the seven cp genomes (shown in Figure 7). At the expected endpoint of inversion or translocation mutation, the gene name is attached based on the X-axis (C. japonica cp genome). The pseudogene is indicated by ψ (pseudo-). The representative inversion and translocation are represented by gene segment I (the trnT-UGU to
trnQ-UUG of C. japonica cp genome) and gene segment II (thr trnV-GAC to pseudo-clpP of C. japonica cp genome). The detailed
comparisons of the gene segment I and II are shown in the following Figure 9 and Figure 10.

actually found that the results of analysis using gene order
closely paralleled the results of phylogenetic analysis
using Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and rbcL sequence
data. Hence, data on rearrangements in the conifer cp
genome might reflect phylogenetic relationships and
serve as a new evolutionary-related parameter. Furthermore, insights obtained from these studies will provide a
clearer detail of the process of cp genome evolution. However, in order to better understand the complex changes in
the cp genome structure that have occurred during the
long process of evolution, data on the cp genomes of
other coniferous taxa, such as Taxaceae, Sciadopityaceae,
Podocarpaceae, and Araucariaceae will be required.

The vestiges of genome rearrangement within the C.
japonica cp genome
Dispersed repetitive sequences with duplicated tRNA
genes have been reported in the cp genomes of other Pinus
species [58,59], and are associated with numerous DNA
rearrangements, including the loss of IRs [59]. In addition, intact tRNA genes and dispersed repeats that are segments of tRNA sequences have a relationship with the
inversion endpoints [23,60-62], although not all inversion borders are near tRNA genes [61]. In this study, the
gene order between psbA or matK and trnS-GCU in the cp
genome of six other plants examined was highly conserved, whereas that of the C. japonica cp genome differed
significantly from these six plants (Figure 9). Assuming a
C. taitungensis-like ancestral cp genome, we postulate an
inversion event, which occurred at the segment from
trnQ-UUG to trnT-UGU, to explain the cause of the dupli-

cated trnQ-UUG gene (gene segment I in Figure 8A, and
Figure 9).
Within the large inversion from trnT-UGU to trnQ-UUG,
we found another vestige of the genome rearrangement.
As mentioned above, the incomplete loss of trnT-GGU
(halfway between trnE-UUC and psbD in the C. japonica cp
genome, Figure 9) from the C. japonica cp genome may
have been the result of genome rearrangement. In grasses,
such as O. sativa, it has been suggested that rearrangements in the region surrounding trnT-GGU were derived
from two independent inversions [49,61,62]. In the A.
capillus cp genome, the segment from trnT-GGU to trnGGCC is inverted when compared to that of E. globulus. In
the P. thunbergii cp genome, a translocation and inversion
event occurred at the segment from trnT-GGU to the pseudogene ndhC (as indicated within gene segment I in additional file 1B). It is worth noting that trnT-GGU is located
at the borders of the sites of the genome rearrangements.
Although the rearrangement associated with trnT-GGU
was not found in the C. japonica cp genome when compared to that of E. globulus, the incomplete loss of trnTGGU in the C. japonica cp genome suggests the possibility
of a re-inversion event.
Furthermore, the gene order between the clpP and trnVUAC genes is extremely conserved among the six other
land plants studied, whereas that of the C. japonica cp
genome is significantly different (Figure 10). Within the
trnN-GUU to chlL gene segment of the C. japonica cp
genome, we identified three inverted repeats and one
direct repeat which were 50 bp or longer and showed a
sequence identity of at least 90%, together with a duplicated partial trnL-CAA gene (repetitive sequences of I-IV in
Figure 10 and additional file 3). We infer that these repetitive sequences are associated with the inversion and
translocation events, because the repetitive sequences
were not observed in the other six plant cp genomes and
they coincided with rearrangement endpoints that were
significantly different from the six other plant cp
genomes. However, it is difficult to unequivocally establish the process of genome rearrangement in the C.
japonica cp genome based solely on the positional information of these repetitive sequences. In particular, we
cannot infer why several repetitive sequences are concentrated within the region between trnL-CAA and ycf1
(repetitive sequences of I-III in Figure 10 and additional
file 3).
We described above the relationship between the clpP
pseudogene, within the trnN-GUU gene to chlL gene segment, and genome rearrangements. In the Adonis annua cp
genome [37], the functions of the clpP gene are thought to
have been lost as a result of genome rearrangement (inversion event). In the petA to clpP region of the C. japonica cp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/70

genome, assuming a C. taitungensis-like ancestral cp
genome, we can construct a genome rearrangement
model in which a minimum of three inversions would be
required to transform the gene order of the C. taitungensis
cp genome into that of C. japonica (Figure 11). The clpP
pseudogene in the C. japonica cp genome was apparently
caused by such genome rearrangements, and the repetitive
sequences halfway between psbJ and clpP, and between
ccsA and petA in the C. japonica cp genome should therefore be vestiges of the genome rearrangements.

Conclusion
This study has revealed that the coniferous species, C.
japonica, has a distinct cp genome compared to previously
reported land plant cp genomes. In terms of gene content,
several genes in the C. japonica cp genome differ significantly, having either been lost or diverged, from those of
other land plants, while the gene order and genome structure also differ significantly. The deleted large IRs and the
numerous genome rearrangements that have occurred in
the C. japonica cp genome have provided new insights into
the evolutionary lineage of conifers. However, as the complete cp genome nucleotide sequences of only three conifer species that belong to two distinct genera have been
determined, our present results will certainly advance our
understanding of the complex evolutionary history of the
coniferous cp genome.

Methods
Isolation of chloroplast DNA
Open-pollinated C. japonica seeds were collected from
several clones, and were germinated and grown for 1
month in a greenhouse. C. japonica chloroplasts were isolated from the needle tissues of these seedlings using the
sucrose density gradient method [63]. The chloroplast
pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of Kool's buffer A (50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.35 M sucrose, 7 mM EDTA, 5 mM
2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the suspension was filtered through layers of
cheesecloth and Miracloth (Calbiochem; without squeezing). The filtrate was centrifuged, and the resulting green
pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of Kool's buffer A. This
second suspension was then loaded onto a stepwise 20–
45–55% sucrose gradient in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3
M sorbitol, 7 mM EDTA, and centrifuged for 30 min. The
green band at the 20–45% sucrose interphase was collected, diluted 1:3 with Kool's buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA), centrifuged for 10 min, and the
chloroplast pellet then resuspended in Kool's buffer B.
The chloroplasts were lysed by adding SDS to a final concentration of 3%. A 1/20th volume of 10 mg/ml pronase
E was added to the solution, and the mixture incubated
overnight at 37°C. DNA was extracted twice from the
lysate with phenol and once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated

with 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes
of ethanol. The precipitate was washed twice with 70%
ethanol and dissolved in water. The extracted DNAs were
further purified using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and treated with ATP-dependent DNase (TOYOBO)
to remove linear double- or single-stranded DNA.
Chloroplast DNA sequencing and genome assembly
The cp DNA isolated was sheared by ultrasonication, and
the sheared fragments then blunted and cloned into
pBluescript II vector. The cp DNA fragments were shotgun
sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
v3.1™ Kit with an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (both PE
Applied Biosystems). Sequencher 3.1 (Gene Codes Corporation) software was used for sequence analysis and
assembly. The sonication-derived cloned fragments were
found to cover 80% of the whole genome after contig
assembly. Any remaining sequence gaps were amplified
by PCR and sequenced directly from the amplification
products.
Gene annotation
The cp genome of C. Japonica was annotated using
DOGMA [Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator, 64] after a
FASTA-formatted file of the complete cp genome was
uploaded to the program's server. Gene annotation and
comparative genome analyses (BLASTN, BLASTX) were
performed against a custom database of 11 previously
published cp genomes using default parameters of 60%
for protein coding genes and 85% for tRNAs and rRNAs.
For genes with low amino acid sequence identity, manual
annotation was performed using a percentage identity
threshold of 25–50%. The fully annotated cp genome of
Cryptomeria japonica was submitted to DDBJ GenBank
with the following accession number [DDBJ: AP009377].
Exploration of the differences in gene contents and
diversified genes
Exploration of the differences in gene contents and diversified genes between the C. japonica cp genome and the six
previously published cp genomes was performed using
PipMaker [65]. The six cp genomes compared are as follows: the dicot angiosperm, E. globulus (Myrtaceae,
160,286 bp, AY780259); the monocot angiosperm, O.
sativa (Poaceae, 134,525 bp, X15901); the liverwort, M.
polymorpha (Marchantiaceae, 121,024 bp, NC001319); the
fern, A. capillus (Pteridaceae, 150,568 bp, AY178864); and
the two gymnosperms, C. taitungensis (Cycadaceae,
163,403 bp, AP009339) and P. thunbergii (Pinaceae,
119,707 bp, D17510). The variable genes identified
within the C. japonica cp genome by gene annotations
were aligned with the corresponding coding genes of the
six land plant cp genomes using ClustalX [66] followed by
screening for nucleotide and amino acid sequence differences.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/70

Comparative analysis of genome structure
Comparative analysis of the genome structure of the seven
cp genomes, including that of the C. japonica cp genome,
was performed using the Harr-plot analysis of PipMaker
[65]. For estimates of genome rearrangement, the GRIMM
web server [67] was used to identify the minimum
number of rearrangements by inversion in pairwise comparisons of the cp genome. GRIMM cannot deal with
duplicated genes and requires that the genomes that are
compared have the same gene content, so that one of the
two IR copies and their genes were arbitrarily excluded.
Examination of dispersed repeat sequences
FASTPCR software [68] was used to locate and count the
direct (forward) and inverted (palindromic) repeats
within the C. japonica cp genome. The identification of
repeat sequences was assessed with the following parameters: options at a minimum length of 50 bp and 90% or
greater sequence identity.
Phylogenetic analysis using the rbcL gene of chloroplast
genome
Based on the rbcL gene sequence of the C. japonica cp
genome, the rbcL gene nucleotide sequences of 132 gymnosperm species and eight out-group species were
obtained by a FASTA search of GenBank. The DNA
sequences were aligned using ClustalX [66], with excluded
gap regions. Phylogenetic analysis using the neighborjoining (NJ) method was performed using ClustalW from
the DDBJ web server [69]. The Kimura-2-parameter model
of molecular evolution was used in the NJ method of the
nucleotide sequences. Bootstrap analysis was performed
for the NJ method with 100 replicates.

Harr plot analyses comparing the cp genome of C. taitungensis with
those of E. globulus and P. thunbergii. Each dotplot shows the positions where 45 out of 50 nucleotides match in the two sequences. The plot
analysis was carried out using Pipmaker software. Sequences along the Yaxis are set from the top to the bottom, and along the X-axis are from left
to right. Relative lengths of sequences are shown to the side and below the
boxes. The colored gene segments along the X- and Y-axes correspond with
common gene units of the seven cp genomes (shown in Figure 7). At the
expected endpoint of inversion or translocation mutation, the gene name
is attached based on the X-axis cp genome. The pseudogene is indicated by
ψ (pseudo-).
