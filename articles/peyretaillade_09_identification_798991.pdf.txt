Abstract
Background: Microsporidia are obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites with genomes ranging in size from 2.3 Mbp
to more than 20 Mbp. The extremely small (2.9 Mbp) and highly compact (~1 gene/kb) genome of the human parasite
Encephalitozoon cuniculi has been fully sequenced. The aim of this study was to characterize noncoding motifs that could
be involved in regulation of gene expression in E. cuniculi and to show whether these motifs are conserved among the
phylum Microsporidia.
Results: To identify such signals, 5' and 3'RACE-PCR experiments were performed on different E. cuniculi mRNAs. This
analysis confirmed that transcription overrun occurs in E. cuniculi and may result from stochastic recognition of the
AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. Such experiments also showed highly reduced 5'UTR's (<7 nts). Most of the E. cuniculi
genes presented a CCC-like motif immediately upstream from the coding start. To characterize other signals involved
in differential transcriptional regulation, we then focused our attention on the gene family coding for ribosomal proteins.
An AAATTT-like signal was identified upstream from the CCC-like motif. In rare cases the cytosine triplet was shown
to be substituted by a GGG-like motif. Comparative genomic studies confirmed that these different signals are also
located upstream from genes encoding ribosomal proteins in other microsporidian species including Antonospora locustae,
Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Anncaliia algerae (syn. Brachiola algerae) and Nosema ceranae. Based on these results a systematic
analysis of the ~2000 E. cuniculi coding DNA sequences was then performed and brings to highlight that 364 translation
initiation codons (18.29% of total CDSs) had been badly predicted.
Conclusion: We identified various signals involved in the maturation of E. cuniculi mRNAs. Presence of such signals, in
phylogenetically distant microsporidian species, suggests that a common regulatory mechanism exists among the
microsporidia. Furthermore, 5'UTRs being strongly reduced, these signals can be used to ensure the accurate prediction
of translation initiation codons for microsporidian genes and to improve microsporidian genome annotation.

Background
The genes of eukaryotes are generally considered to be
monocistronic, each with its own promoter at the 5' end
and a transcription terminator at the 3' end. The production of mRNAs from genomic DNA is so directed by
sequences that determine transcript processing. Indeed,
certain DNA motifs must be recognized during transcription to ensure transcriptional induction (promoter and
regulator signals), splicing (donor and acceptor sites) and
3' end processing (polyadenylation and terminator signals) [1,2].
For transcription initiation, multiple cis-acting sequences
are important for transcription. In eukaryotes, the core
promoter serves as a platform for the assembly of a transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) that includes transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH)
and RNA polymerase II, which function collectively to
specify the transcription start site [3]. The core promoter
encompasses the transcription start site and typically
extends ~35 nt either upstream or downstream from the
transcription start site. DNA elements that constitute this
core promoter include the TATA box, the TFIIB recognition element (BRE), the initiator (Inr), and the downstream core promoter element (DPE). However, it is
important to note that there is no universal core promoter
element. Each of these motifs is found in only a subset of
core promoters [4,5].
For splicing, practically all introns contain two highly
conserved dinucleotides. The donor splice site has GT
exactly after the point where the transcriptional machinery cuts the 5'-end of intron sequences and the acceptor
site has AG exactly before the point where the intron 3'end is cut [6]. Finally for mRNA 3' end processing, the
polyadenylation signal plays a crucial role, since its mutation leads to a loss of mRNA through defective polyadenylation leading to unstable transcripts. Indeed, failure to
terminate transcription through loss of poly(A) signals
may also cause transcription read-through into downstream genes. The sequence of this signal, which is usually
AAUAAA, is located ~20 nts upstream of the mRNA cleavage site [7].
Highly conserved signals also play a crucial role in translation, especially to define the initiation codon. Indeed,
the start of translation in eukaryotes is governed by nucleotides flanking the AUG start codon which are essential
for the right positioning of ribosomes. For example, the
optimal context for initiation of translation in mammals
is GCCRCCaugG [8].
Microsporidia were considered to be primitive amitochondriate eukaryotes. However, recent phylogenetic
studies have consistently supported a placement of these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/607

organisms as a basal lineage of the fungi [9-12]. These parasites are characterized by small genomes ranging from
only 2.3 Mb to 23 Mb [13,14], a trait reflected in the short
length of most putative proteins compared to eukaryote
orthologues and compact gene organization. Williams et
al. [15] showed that transcripts encoding multiple genes
are found in Antonospora locustae, a microsporidian species
also characterized by a highly compacted genome (~5.4
Mbp) that has been partially sequenced [15]. By sequencing 1,146 cDNA clones, they showed that about 11% of
cDNAs contained more than one gene. In addition, they
found that a large number of transcripts harboured parts
of flanking genes. This last finding suggested that control
elements are displaced into or beyond adjacent genes, as
a consequence of reduced intergenic regions. Using
Northern blotting, RACE-PCR, and EST analysis
approaches, Corradi et al. [16] recently reinforced that A.
locustae cDNAs contain multiple genes. Furthermore they
showed the presence of very large transcripts in sporal
stages. Some of these transcripts were found to overlap up
to four open reading frames in different strands. A comparative study performed by 5' and 3'RACE-PCR revealed
that overlapping transcription was found in E. cuniculi in
more than 80% of the analyzed loci and that this percentage is higher than that estimated for A. locustae [17]. These
results could be justified because the genome of E. cuniculi
is highly compact with a size of only 2.9 Mbp [18]. Concerning DNA signals implicated in transcriptional process,
a cytosine triplet that is highly over-represented both in
the honeybee pathogen Nosema ceranae and E. cuniculi has
been highlighted within the 15 bp upstream of the start
codon [19]. The authors also suggested that TATA-like
promoters are important components of N. ceranae gene
regulation.
In order to complement these previous studies and to
finely characterize DNA signals governing the original
transcription process in microsporidia, we first performed
various RT-PCR coupled to both 5' and 3'RACE-PCR.
These analyses were done using a locus from E. cuniculi
consisting of six genes in close proximity located on both
DNA strands. Based on these results we have then identified DNA signals that could play a role in 5' and 3' mRNA
maturation. Furthermore, we extended the search of these
specific signals on conserved genes encoding ribosomal
proteins in the five fully or partially sequenced microsporidian genomes, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Antonospora
locustae, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Nosema ceranae and
Anncaliia algerae (syn. Brachiola algerae) [9]. These highly
conserved signals were finally exploited to more accurately determine the translation initiation codon of all E.
cuniculi CDSs. In this context, we propose that these conserved signals are a useful tool for efficient microsporidian
CDS detection during genome annotation.

Results and discussion
Complete transcription of both DNA strands in
Encephalitozoon cuniculi
In order to better understand transcriptional regulation in
microsporidia, we focused our attention on six E. cuniculi
genes coding, respectively, a hypothetical protein (unk),
the histone transcription regulator (htr), the histone H2A
(h2a), the polyA polymerase (pap), the ubiquitin (ubi) and
the 60 S ribosomal protein L7A (rib). Coding DNA
Sequences (CDSs) of these genes are located on the chromosome II of E. cuniculi (ECU02_0700: CAD25100,
ECU02_0710: CAD25101, ECU02_0720: CAD25102,
ECU02_0730:
CAD25103
and
ECU02_0740i:
CAD25104, ECU02_0750i: CAD25105). The two flanking genes of this DNA region (unk and rib) have the same
orientation and the four other genes (htr, h2a, pap and ubi)
are located on the other strand. These CDSs are separated

by intergenic spacers of 416 bp, 97 pb, 77 bp, 136 bp and
241 bp, respectively (Figure 1A).
Using total RNA extracted from E. cuniculi-infected
human cells, reverse transcription was performed using a
primer specifically designed for the rib gene (5'-rib
primer). PCR was then carried out using this primer and
the 5'-ubi primer designed within the ubi CDS (Additional
file 1). Sequence analysis of the amplified product demonstrated that rib transcript encompasses the ubiquitin
gene region. To exclude a potential DNA contamination,
PCR experiments were also carried out on RNAs without
the reverse transcription reaction. No DNA amplification
was observed in these controls (Additional file 1). Such
mRNAs have previously been identified in A. locustae [15]
and E. cuniculi [17] and the authors interpreted these
results as run-on transcripts where termination signals are

absent from the downstream intergenic regions and
instead located within downstream genes. The authors
also characterized cDNAs with long 5' ends corresponding
to the antisense strand of CDSs indicating a movement of
the transcription initiation faraway from the CDSs. In
order to identify transcriptional regulators in E. cuniculi
we then carried out fine mapping of the transcripts of the
studied gene cluster.
PCR using 3'-htr and 3'-unk primers was then performed
on reverse transcription products obtained with the 5'-rib
primer located in the most distal gene of the cluster (Figure 1A). Sequence analysis of the PCR product indicated
that the transcript encompasses at least the six studied
genes (Figure 1B, Additional file 1). In this situation, the
very large transcript harbours the sense sequence of the
flanking genes unk and rib and the antisense sequence of
the four other genes ubi, pap, h2a and htr. For the grasshopper microsporidian A. locustae, mRNA molecules harbouring several cistrons are also highly frequent with
some transcripts corresponding to at least four genes [15].
A more recent study confirmed that large transcripts
encompassing several CDSs are detected in A. locustae
spores [16]. Our results confirmed that such transcripts
are also present in developmental microsporidian stages
which are likely transcriptionaly more active than spores.
Indeed, in our experiments, total RNA extraction has been
performed on the parasite during its developmental cycle
in human cells.
In order to characterize mRNA including coding strands
of ubi, pap, h2a and htr genes, a second reverse transcrip-

tion experiment was carried out with the 3'-unk primer
(Figure 1A). Using this RT product as template, a DNA
fragment was then amplified with 5'-ubi and 5'-rib primers (Additional file 1). Sequence analysis confirmed the
amplification of the intergenic region between ubi and rib
genes thus demonstrating that the transcript may contain
the sense sequences of the four internal genes and the
antisense sequences of the two flanking genes (Figure 1B).
All these results clearly indicated that both DNA strands
corresponding to this E. cuniculi locus are completely transcribed. We then started the identification of the extremities of these large transcripts.
Multiple forms of polycistronic and monocistronic
transcripts coexist in E. cuniculi
To identify potential transcriptional start sites and the
polyadenylation sites of the two large mRNA transcripts
characterized above, RACE-PCR experiments were carried
out (Figure 1C, Additional file 1).

For the first mRNA harbouring the sense sequence of the
flanking genes unk and rib, 5'RACE-PCR performed with
the 5'-unk primer revealed only one DNA fragment (Figure 1C, Additional file 1). Sequence analysis demonstrated that this experiment amplify the 5' end of the unk
gene and showed that the 5'UTR region is reduced to only
1 nt (Figure 2). Such result could not arise from a DNA
contamination. Indeed in 5'RACE-PCR experiments,
linker hybridization is dependent to reverse transcriptase
step of mRNA. Double strand genomic DNA could not be
used as matrix to ensure such hybridization.

In the same way, the mapping of the 3' end of the transcript using the 3'-rib primer in a 3'RACE-PCR experiment
located the polyadenylation site 17 nts downstream of the
rib stop codon. In this case, 3' RACE-PCR experiments also
avoid DNA contaminations. Indeed reverse transcription
is performed using oligo-d(T) primer to ensure only
hybridization with all mRNA polyA tails. Furthermore,
genomic DNA sequence analysis did not show potential
adenine stretch that could be used to ensure oligo-d(T)
primer hybridization during the PCR step.
Concerning the second transcript, corresponding to the
other strand, 5'RACE-PCR using 5'-ubi primer also
showed only one DNA fragment (Figure 1C, Additional
file 1). Unexpectedly, analysis of the sequence allowed the
characterization of the 5' end of the ubi gene positioned 6
nts upstream the putative AUG (Figure 2). Furthermore,
3'RACE-PCR using the 3'-htr primer permitted the identification of the polyadenylation site of the htr gene (82 nts
downstream of the htr stop codon). These results are not
in agreement with the identification of mRNA transcripts
encompassing both the unk gene and rib genes based on
our RT-PCR approaches. However, such transcript variability has been also described in A. locustae. Indeed, using
Northern blotting, RACE-PCR and EST sequence analysis,
Corradi et al. [16] identified different transcripts along a 6
kb region surrounding the actin locus.
In order to identify all potential transcripts covering the E.
cuniculi DNA region from unk to rib genes, we then performed systematic 5' and 3'RACE-PCR experiments for the
six genes (Figure 2). 5'RACE-PCR with the 5'-rib primer
successfully characterized the 5' end of the rib gene and
showed that the 5'UTR region is reduced to 2 nts. Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that the intron predicted
during genome annotation is not spliced. It may be thus
deduced that this is not a true intron or the intron is not
spliced. In fact with a length of 27 nts, no frame shift is
induced in the coding sequence of this ribosomal protein.
Using the 5'-pap primer, two RACE-PCR products were
obtained (Figure 1C, Additional file 1). The sequence of
the largest DNA fragment allowed us to confirm the 5' end
of the ubi gene. But, unexpectedly, analysis of the smallest
amplified sequence revealed the 5' end of the pap gene
which is located 7 or 3 nts upstream of the putative AUG,
depending on the clone product (Figure 2). With 5'-h2a
and the 5'-htr specific primers, 2 and 3 RACE-PCR products were obtained, respectively. In each case, analysis of
the smallest fragment allowed the characterization of 5'
end of h2a and htr genes positioned at 1 and 4 nts
upstream of their respective putative AUG (Figure 2).
Sequencing of the higher fragments confirmed the 5' end
of the pap gene for the two experiments and the 5' end of
the h2a gene for the experiment performed with the 5'-htr

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/607

primer. Similar results were obtained in A. locustae for the
most abundant multigene transcripts encoding DNA
polymerase α and ribosomal protein L24 [15]. Indeed,
5'RACE-PCR revealed two distinct transcripts: the first
starting one base upstream of the ATG of the ribosomal
protein L24 and the second one starting at the ATG of the
DNA polymerase α gene. Corradi et al. [17] also observed
this situation in E. cuniculi using two different primers
located in genes coding respectively for a ring zinc finger
transcription negative factor and for a 20S proteasome
alpha-subunit. They identified the same 5' end in the
upstream region of the second gene.
For 3' RACE PCR, using the 3'-h2a primer, two DNA fragments were amplified. Sequencing of the largest PCR
products permitted to confirm the 3' end of the htr gene.
Analysis of the smallest one revealed that the 3' polyadenylation site of the h2a gene was located 33, 34 or 35 nts
downstream its stop codon (Figure 2). So, 3' RACE experiments confirmed that the histone h2a transcript is polyadenylated. Primary and secondary structure analyses
performed on 3' UTR of this latter mRNA and on other
putative members of the E. cuniculi histone family genes
did not reveal a conserved sequence or a stem loop structure implicated in mRNA stability as is the case in metazoan organisms. Furthermore, genes coding for stem loop
binding proteins [20] and U7 snRNA genes [21], required
for the 3' end processing and the turnover of these mRNAs
in metazoan species, were absent in the E. cuniculi
genome. Therefore, final 3' end maturation of the histone
family mRNA results only in a polyadenylation step to
ensure their stability.
With 3'-pap primer, two RACE-PCR fragments were also
obtained allowing the confirmation of the polyadenylation site of the h2a gene and the identification of the 3'
end of the pap gene (68 nts downstream its stop codon).
The polyadenylation site of the ubi gene (16 nts downstream from the stop codon) was also identified with the
3'-ubi primer. Finally, using the 3'-unk primer the polyadenylation site of the unk gene should be positioned 415,
417 or 419 nts downstream the stop codon (Figure 2).
Our results suggest that transcription in E. cuniculi is conducted on both stands leading to the formation of a mix
of complex transcripts encompassing large regions with
sense and antisense sequences corresponding to CDSs.
For each transcript we noticed a precise mapping of their
extremities in accordance to a faithful control of processing. We suppose that this high fidelity of processing
should depend on conserved DNA regulatory signals.
DNA signals implicated in 3' transcript processing
It should be noticed that Poly(A) signals on the transcript
play a crucial role in 3' mRNA end formation in eukaryo-

tic organisms. The sequence of this signal is usually
AAUAAA and is located ~20 nts upstream of the mRNA
cleavage site. However, signals are frequently degenerated
and so may induce a bad recruitment of the cleavage/polyadenylation complexes [22].
3'RACE-PCR experiments were useful to characterize this
putative polyadenylation signal for all the studied genes
(Figure 2). In an attempt to generalize the presence of this
signal in E. cuniculi, this sequence was systematically
examined for all the genes located on chromosome II.
However, in order to eliminate bias due to bad gene prediction obtained using ab initio approaches, we only
focused our attention on genes coding for proteins with
defined function (additional file 2). The consensus
sequence AAUAAA has been identified near the stop
codon for approximately half of the genes. Nevertheless,
some other degenerated signal sequences which only differ from a single nucleotide have been also observed. For
25% of the observed cases, this degenerated sequence is
AUUAAA. Sheets et al. [22], demonstrated that such signal
reduces only weakly the polyadenylation and cleavage
efficiencies compared to the AAUAAA sequence. However,
the high frequency of such signals seems not to be a general rule in Microsporidia. In A. locustae, Corradi et al. [16]
identified few 3'UTRs harbouring the consensus-like signal AAUAAA. They suggested that canonical polyadenylation sites can be identified but they are not common and
apparently not frequently unused.
It should be noticed that for two genes, ECU02_0430 and
ECU02_0530 (additional file 2), signals are more degenerate (AUUGAA and GAUGAA, respectively). In these
cases, we cannot totally exclude that these two signals are
functional. Polyadenylation signals could be more distantly related to the CDS. This is the case for unk gene with
a 3'UTR spanning on 415, 417 or 419 nts (Figure 2). Also,
we can not exclude the presence of functional signals in
downstream CDS.
On the base of our experimental results (transcription of
both strands leading to a mix of transcripts) and signal
analysis, we propose a blurred 3' maturation of mRNA
transcripts. This process implies a weak recognition of the
polyadenylation DNA signal. In this situation, RNA
polymerase should pass through the signal without stopping for the processing or recognize the signal for the
cleavage and the polyadenylation steps leading to a mix of
combinatorial transcripts as observed in our study.
To conclude, 5' and 3' RACE PCR experiments permit to
identify mRNA on both strands that could encompass one
or multiple CDSs. But in each case we could precisely and
reproducibly identify 5' and 3' end processing sites of such
molecules. Indeed, whatever the number of CDSs harboured by mRNAs, we have characterised the 5' end

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/607

processing of the first CDS in close proximity of the translation start codon and the 3' end processing of the last
CDS depending of the polyA signal.
Such conclusion could be also reinforced by the identification of large mRNAs fragments that encompass the 6
studied genes. Indeed, RT-PCR experiments have been
performed to prove that both DNA strands are simultaneously transcribed leading to mono and polycistronic
mRNA molecule resulting from a deficiency of accurate 3'
end processing. In our example concerning reverse transcription carried out with 3'-unk primer, large mRNA molecule is the consequence of the absence of 3' end
maturation of the unk gene. Maturation could arise using
the next 3' end maturation site located in the rib gene or
in a next downstream gene with the same orientation. So,
theoretically, if we consider the first gene of each DNA
chromosome strand, transcription may produce an
mRNA molecule corresponding to the complete strand if
all 3' end maturation sites are not recognized.
Moreover, in the E. cuniculi proteome, although the presence of all protein complexes involved in cleavage and
polyadenylation was confirmed by in silico analysis, an
interesting feature is the absence of the Pcf11 factor that
could contribute to a low fidelity cleavage and polyadenylation processing steps [23]. The absence of this protein
supports our model with a reduction in the fidelity or
level of mRNA 3' end processing by reducing the signal
recognition frequency.
In addition, these analyses appear to exclude the potential
regulation of gene expression by the RNA interference
process in E. cuniculi. This conclusion was also reinforced
by the fact that genes coding for proteins implicated in
such transcriptional regulation process have not been
found in the E. cuniculi genome [16]. It should also be
noticed that in eukaryotic organisms, gene expression regulation could involve natural antisense transcripts
(NATs). These NATs are endogenous RNA molecules containing sequences that are complementary to other transcripts. NATs have been proposed to regulate the
expression of their target genes by four mechanisms: transcriptional interference, RNA masking, double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA)-dependent mechanisms and chromatin
remodelling [24]. However, each mechanism requires different associations between sense and antisense expression patterns [24]. NATs have been detected in the
transcriptomes of many protozoan parasites including
Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, Theileria parvum, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania spp and Giardia lamblia [25].
In P. falciparum and T. gondii, there is an intriguing negative correlation between the presence of sense and antisense RNAs indicating the potential for reciprocal negative

regulation between NATs and coding transcripts. A prominent feature of transcription in G. lamblia is the abundant
production of sterile antisense transcripts [26]. Such molecules are produced by promoters which ensure bidirectional transcription [27]. However, these authors
suggested that NATs might simply result from unusual
loose of transcription regulation in this organism. They
are therefore not implicated in transcriptional regulations.
In E. cuniculi, arguments such as that both strands should
be transcribed and that a blurred maturation process
should occur are in agreement with the exclusion of a
putative control of gene expression by NATs.

because it belongs to a multigenic family implicated in the
same biological function. We suppose that all members of
this family should be dependent on the same regulation
process. After the analysis of the upstream ribosomal CDS
sequence, a AAAAATTTT signal in close proximity of the
cytosine triplet (1 nt) was identified and represents a putative regulatory motif for transcription. This motif was then
searched on the complete chromosome II sequence and
results showed that it is not randomly distributed. In fact,
this signal is preferentially located in intergenic regions
and more particularly upstream all the CDSs coding for
ribosomal proteins (Table 1).

DNA signals implicated in 5' transcript processing
RACE-PCR experiments have shown a high reduction of
5'UTR regions (<7 nts). Such reduction may then suppose
that promoter signals should be located in close proximity
of the start of CDS. To confirm this hypothesis and identify these signals, we firstly analyzed the sequence
upstream the transcription start for the 6 studied genes
(Figure 2). These analyses confirm the presence of the
CCC-like signal recently described by Cornman et al. [19].
However, this signal could not explain differential expression of genes because it seems present upstream of all the
E. cuniculi genes [19]. In order to identify new regulation
signals, we focused then our attention on the rib gene

A complementary analysis of all the E. cuniculi genes coding for ribosomal protein was then performed, systematically allowing us to confirm the presence of a AAATTT-like
signal in the upstream intergenic space (additional file 3).
Such a palindromic sequence could also play a transcriptional role for two divergent transcriptional units. This
could be the case for ribosomal protein S16 (ECU03_310)
and L13 (ECU03_320) CDSs, which present a head to
head gene organization and are only separated by a 35 bp
intergenic space containing this AAATTT signal.
Our analysis demonstrated that for 3 genes coding respectively for 60S L24, L10A and L4 the CCC-like motif

located between the AAATTT signal and the translational
start codon could not be identified (Table 1 and additional file 3). However, an alternative GGG-like motif that
could probably play the same function is present. Such
signal was also identified by Cornman et al. [19] and used
to perform their promoter analyses in Nosema Ceranae, a
microsporidian pathogen of honeybees. Indeed, for
NcORF-01850 and NcORF-00057 genes of N. ceranae and
gi|19173514, gi|19173508 and gi|19074866 genes of E.
cuniculi, the CCC motif is absent but we could characterize
the GGG motif in the 15 bp upstream the start codon [19].
In order to determine whether this signal is widespread
among microsporidian species, a comparative genomic
study was performed between E. cuniculi [15], A. locustae
[28], E. bieneusi[29], N. ceranae [19] and A. algerae (personal data) for genes coding for ribosomal proteins (Table
1 and additional file 3). Systematically, for all genes the
AAATTT-like signal was identified. Concerning the CCC
motif, it was identified between the AAATTT sequence and
the translational transcription start codon for all A. locustae and A. algerae genes. For E. bieneusi and N. ceranae
respectively one and two genes harbour the GGG-like
alternative motif instead of the CCC one (Table 1 and
additional file 3). Such signal for N. ceranae has been also
found for the same genes in E. cuniculi.
These results suggested that transcriptional regulation of
this multigenic family is under control of conserved regulatory elements in microsporidia. Our genomic analysis
included various species which belong respectively to
clade II (A. locustae), clade III (E. cuniculi, E. bieneusi and
N. ceranae) and clade V (A. algerae) of the Microsporidia
[30]. In addition, these species are respectively characterized by genomes with highly variable AT percent, (47%
for A. locustae, 47% for E. cuniculi, 74% for N. ceranae,
75% for E. bieneusi and 76% for A. algerae (personal data).
However, such variability does not seem to influence the
DNA motif implicated in transcriptional process.
Ribosomal proteins are over-synthesized in cells to ensure
translation steps. We can suggest that the signal regulating
ribosomal proteins should also be located upstream from
highly expressed genes. Using a proteomic approach, Brosson et al, [31] have identified 32 highly abundant proteins in E. cuniculi. For six genes (ECU02_0100,
ECU04_1100, ECU05_0510, ECU05_0590, ECU09_1250
and ECU09_1820) coding for these proteins we could
then characterize an AAATTT-like motif upstream from
the AUG codon (additional file 4). Nevertheless, for the
other ones, we identified an adenine-rich sequence in
most cases. Such sequence was also present upstream the
ubi, pap and h2a genes coding for proteins that likely need
to be highly expressed in eukaryotic cells. For htr and unk
genes such bias could not be detected. However, for those

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/607

last genes, upstream CDS regions present higher cytosine
and guanine percentages, and we could locate multiple
CCC or GGG motifs. Such analysis is in agreement with
alternative commonly found eukaryotic promoters. The
architecture of promoters uses a distinct combination of
core promoter elements and plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. Furthermore, both the AAATTT and
adenine-rich region may play a similar role as TATA box
and it was shown that this signal not only specifies the initiation for transcription, but also acts as regulatory element for enhancer function [32]. In our case the different
TATA-like sequences may then be involved in differential
gene regulation.
Our results have shown that transcriptional regulation signals are located in close proximity to 5' CDS ends. However, Corradi et al. [17] have also studied by 5'RACE-PCR
different genes in E. cuniculi. They could then identify 5'RACE products that may begin at different positions
highly distant from the start codon. Such results were
described
for
ECU4_1410,
ECU10_1600
and
ECU10_1740. Nevertheless, analysis of the neighbouring
upstream regions allowed the identification of the cytosine triplet visible after adenine rich sequences (additional file 5) that represent unambiguous promoter
sequences. To explain their results we could suggest the
presence of cryptic promoter sites that could then be used
to initiate the transcription process. This conclusion was
validated by 5'RACE-PCR experiments on the pap gene
where different CCC- or GGG-like motifs are in agreement
with the characterization of two transcriptional start sites.
In summary, transcriptional gene regulations in Microsporidia seem to be dependent to the presence of conserved signal sequences upstream the CDSs.
Re-annotation of the Encephalitozoon cuniculi genome
To validate the importance of these signals in the transcriptional process of all E. cuniculi genes, a systematic
analysis of regions located upstream of all the CDSs identified in the genome was then performed (additional file
5). It was based notably on the identification of CCC- or
GGG-like motif. Such signals have been identified near
the AUG codon for 1591 genes (1474 with the CCC motif
and 117 with the GGG one).

The genome of E. cuniculi consisting of 1996 CDSs, two
hypotheses could explain the absence of this signal for the
405 other genes: (1) these genes are regulated by different
signals which are not conserved, (2) prediction of translational initiation start sites are erroneous. Gene predictions
have been performed automatically during E. cuniculi
genome annotation and the choice of AUG codon was
systematically made in favour of the first one encountered
into the open reading frame.

The characterization of the conserved signals for genes
coding for ribosomal proteins allowed us to highlight
mispredicted initiation start codons suggesting some
problems for a reliable annotation of some CDSs. Indeed,
for the 72 genes coding ribosomal proteins, 13 showed a
badly predicted start codon (additional table 1). Moreover, these analyses allowed to identify 3 supplementary
introns. It should be taken into account that such correction has been suggested for gene coding the 60S ribosomal protein L6 [19]. In order to validate hypothesis of
bad predicted start codons, other potential AUG codons
were characterized and their upstream sequences analyzed. This approach allowed us to bring to light the presence of AUG with CCC-like signal for 346 genes and the
GGG one for 18 genes (additional file 5). In order to validate the choice of these new predicted translation initiation codons, two complementary approaches were
performed. The first one was based on a comparative anal-

ysis of the N-terminal region of proteins coding by these
genes using a BLASTP approach [33]. Protein alignments
with orthologous sequences of the NCBI nr database were
helpful to validate corrections for 187 genes. For the other
ones, absence of orthologous proteins in databases or the
presence of highly variable N-terminal did not allow to
validate the new predictions. A second approach, resting
on Kozak sequence analysis, was then implemented. The
sequence located around the AUG codon presents a high
degree of conservation for all genes of the same organism.
We first identified this sequence using the 1474 correctly
predicted CDSs with CCC-like motif in upstream regions
(Table 2). No bias could then be detected upstream from
the AUG codon which is in agreement with a highly
reduced 5'UTRs in E. cuniculi.. Nevertheless, we have identified a strong bias for adenine (37.65%) and guanine
(40.57%) in the +4 position and a significant one for adenine (45.32%) in the +5 position (Table 2). For the AUG

considered as badly predicted, the same study did not
show such biases (Table 2). When we consider newly predicted AUG, Kozak sequence analysis shows the same
biases in favour of adenine and guanine in position +4
and adenine in position +5 respectively for initiation start
codon validated or not validated by BLASTP. Finally, we
performed independent analysis of AUG (right predicted
or corrected) with GGG-like motif in upstream regions
and same biases could then be identified (Table 2). It
should be noticed that for 41 genes we could not locate
the CCC- or the GGG-like motif. Furthermore, for these
genes, no putative polyadenylation signal could be characterized. We could then suppose that these genes coding
for proteins with unknown function and with no ortholog
in other organisms correspond to erroneously predicted
genes. Using our corrections, we also showed that overlapping CDSs in head to head or head to tail organizations are very rare in E. cuniculi. Indeed, base on first
annotation [18], 129 overlapping of CDSs have been
defined in such organizations. Nevertheless, correction of
start codons allowed us to eliminate 120 of them. Such
result is also in agreement with the presence of transcriptional signal in intergenic regions in most cases. For the 9
others, the unambiguous identification of transcriptional
signals showed that they may be present in rarely cases in
adjacent CDSs.
Our analyses also highlighted the importance of these signals to carry out CDS prediction during microsporidian
genome annotation. For genes coding ribosomal proteins
in A. locustae and E. bieneusi, we were able to detect respectively 5 and 7 mispredicted translational initial codons
(additional file 3). For A. locustae this study allowed the
identification of one intron in the 40S ribosomal S6 gene
that is also present in the E. cuniculi ortholog.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/607

genes coding for ribosomal proteins in A. locustae, E.
bieneusi, N. ceranae, and A. algerae allowed us to characterize a CCC-like or an alternative GGG-like signal that is
rarely found to be degenerated on one base. These signals
are generally found after adenine- and/or thymine-rich
regions. For the five studied species, an AAATTT-like motif
is always found for genes coding for ribosomal proteins.
This signal was also found upstream genes coding for
highly expressed proteins in E. cuniculi. These signals have
been then used to ensure re-annotation of E. cuniculi
CDSs. Using this approach, we were able to correct more
than 18% of the previously predicted CDSs, confirming
that these signals represent tremendous tools for accurate
microsporidian genome annotation.

Methods
Cell culture
1 109 spores of E. cuniculi harvested on HFF cells culture
were used to infect during 2 hours flask (75 cm2) containing HFF host cells grown at confluence. Cultures were
then washed three times with PBS (1X) to eliminate
spores that did not invade host cells and incubated during
2 days as previously described [34].
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted after 2 days E. cuniculi-infected
HFF using RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen). Before extraction,
infected cells were washed three times with 5 mL of PBS to
eliminate extracellular spores. RNA quality and quantity
were estimated using the Agilent bioanalyser with the
RNA 6000 Nano LabChip® Kit. To remove DNA contamination 5 μg of previously extracted RNA were incubated
with 20 U of Dnase I (Boerhinger, Mannheim) at 30°C for
30 min in a final volume of 10 μl. Enzymatic activity of
DNase I was then inhibited by addition of 1/10 volume of
0.2 M EDTA.

Conclusion
This study provides new evidences for transcriptional regulation of microsporidian genes. RT-PCR and RACE-PCR
approaches were able to demonstrate that both DNA
strands at a same location should be transcribed for E.
cuniculi species. To explain these results, attention was
particularly focused on DNA signals implicated in this
transcription process. Relying on these analyses, we propose a new transcriptional regulation process which
implies the blurred recognition of the AAUAAA-like signal
involved in 3' end maturation of mRNAs. When this signal is not recognized, the transcription process continues
and leads to the formation of mRNAs including multiple
CDSs in various orientations. In the contrary case, identification of this signal leads to 3' end maturation.
Concerning the transcriptional initiation process we suggest a control linked to the presence of multiple conserved
DNA signals located in close proximity of the start codon.
Systematic analysis of the whole E. cuniculi genes and

Primer design
Primer design was performed using a modified program
based on the algorithm developed by Rimour et al. [35].
Two primers were then defined for each of the six targeted
genes (Table 3) and were used for RT-PCR and RACE-PCR
experiments. These primers are highly specific of the targeted genes, avoiding potential cross hybridization with
other E. cuniculi transcripts or host ones.
RT-PCR experiments
The reverse transcription reactions were carried out at
42°C for 2 h with 5 μg of RNA extracted from E. cuniculiinfected cells in a final volume of 20 μl with 100 U of
SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 1 U of
RNasin+ Inhibitor (Promega), 0.25 mM of dNTPs (Invitrogen), 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen) and 0.625 μM of primer
(Table 1). Two different reverse transcription experiments
were performed independently with one specific primer
defined in ECU02_0750i (60S ribosomal protein L7A;

CAD25100) genes respectively (Table 1). The first primer
sequence corresponds to the coding strand and the second
one to the non coding one. The reverse transcription (RT)
products were then subjected to PCR amplifications using
Advantage 2 PCR kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's instructions. The final PCR reaction mixture of
25 μL consisted of 1 μL of cDNA, 1 μM dNTPs, 1 μM of
corresponding primers and 2 units of Taq polymerase.
Five minutes at 94°C were followed by 30 cycles of 94°C
for 15 s, annealing temperature (68°C) for 15 s and 72°C
for 90 s. After the final cycle, the temperature was maintained at 72°C for 7 minutes to allow completion of synthesis of amplified products. The PCR products were then
visualized on ethidium bromide stained-agarose gels
(1%). DNA fragments were purified with the QIAquick
Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) and cloned into the pGEM®T Easy Vector (PROMEGA). One clone for each PCR product was then sequenced with the Big-Dye® Terminator v1.1
kit (APPLIED BIOSYTEMS) on the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic
Analyzer (APPLIED BIOSYTEMS) according to recommendations of these different manufacturers.
To exclude amplification of contaminating genomic
DNA, control reactions were performed by direct amplification of total RNA.
RACE-PCR experiments
5' and 3'RACE analyses were carried out to amplify cDNA
ends of putative operons using the SMART™ RACE Amplification kit according manufacturer recommendations
(CLONTECH). Reverse transcription steps were performed with 300 ng of E. cuniculi total RNA extracted from

infected cells using the modified oligo-d(T) primer provided by the SMART™ RACE Amplification kit. This RT
product was then used for PCR amplifications with specific gene primers (Table 1). PCR products corresponding
to all amplified DNA bands were then extracted, purified,
cloned and sequenced as described above. Five clones for
each PCR product were sequenced.
Bio-analysis strategy for DNA signal identification
DNA signals implicated in 5' and 3' mRNA maturation
were manually identified in E. cuniculi genome using
Artemis software [36]. EMBL files have been then updated
after translational initiation codon correction.

A BLASTP approach was implemented to identify orthologous ribosomal proteins from E. cuniculi, A. locustae, E.
bieneusi and A. algerae and then performed a comparative
genomic analysis of DNA motifs. DNA sequences were
respectively retrieved from EMBL database (E. cuniculi and
E. bieneusi) and from A. locustae Genome Database [28].
For A. algerae (personnal data), sequences were extracted
from data generated by the A. algerae whole genome
sequencing project which was initiated in collaboration
between Genoscope (Evry, France) and the laboratory
"Microorganismes: Génome et Environnement" (UMR
CNRS 6023, France) [14].

Characterization of DNA signals implicated in ribosomal protein gene
expression shared by microsporidian species. First column indicates
product name, the five other columns present DNA sequences upstream
the AUG start codon for E. cuniculi, A. locustae, E. bieneusi, A. algerae
and N. ceranae. AAATTT-like motifs are colored in blue, CCC-like motifs
in red and GGG-like motifs in green. The star character stands for a mispredicted start codon, and NS stands for not already sequenced genes.
When a gene contains an intron it is indicated within brackets.

Additional file 5
Identification of upstream signals for total E. cuniculi genes after
start codon correction. First column indicates ORF number. Second column presents signal sequence upstream the AUG start codon where CCClike motifs are colored in red, GGG-like motifs in green, and MP stands
for mispredicted genes (not a real gene). The third column indicates the
new position of the AUG start codon when it has been corrected. BV indicates that corrections have been validated by Blast approach.
