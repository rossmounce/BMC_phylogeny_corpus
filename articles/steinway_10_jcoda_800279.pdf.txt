Abstract
Background: The incorporation of annotated sequence information from multiple related species in commonly used
databases (Ensembl, Flybase, Saccharomyces Genome Database, Wormbase, etc.) has increased dramatically over the
last few years. This influx of information has provided a considerable amount of raw material for evaluation of
evolutionary relationships. To aid in the process, we have developed JCoDA (Java Codon Delimited Alignment) as a
simple-to-use visualization tool for the detection of site specific and regional positive/negative evolutionary selection
amongst homologous coding sequences.
Results: JCoDA accepts user-inputted unaligned or pre-aligned coding sequences, performs a codon-delimited
alignment using ClustalW, and determines the dN/dS calculations using PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Maximum
Likelihood, yn00 and codeml) in order to identify regions and sites under evolutionary selection. The JCoDA package
includes a graphical interface for Phylip (Phylogeny Inference Package) to generate phylogenetic trees, manages
formatting of all required file types, and streamlines passage of information between underlying programs. The raw
data are output to user configurable graphs with sliding window options for straightforward visualization of pairwise or
gene family comparisons. Additionally, codon-delimited alignments are output in a variety of common formats and all
dN/dS calculations can be output in comma-separated value (CSV) format for downstream analysis. To illustrate the
types of analyses that are facilitated by JCoDA, we have taken advantage of the well studied sex determination
pathway in nematodes as well as the extensive sequence information available to identify genes under positive
selection, examples of regional positive selection, and differences in selection based on the role of genes in the sex
determination pathway.
Conclusions: JCoDA is a configurable, open source, user-friendly visualization tool for performing evolutionary analysis
on homologous coding sequences. JCoDA can be used to rapidly screen for genes and regions of genes under
selection using PAML. It can be freely downloaded at http://www.tcnj.edu/~nayaklab/jcoda.
Background
The first step in the assessment of evolutionary relationships between related sequences is the generation of pairwise or multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Over the
last two decades several algorithms have been developed
to generate rapid yet accurate sequence alignments for
subsequent analysis [1]. A commonly used program,
ClustalW, generates MSAs of DNA or amino acids by
constructing a branched guide tree from pairwise alignments [2]. More recent progressive alignment methods,
such as T-COFFEE, have improved the accuracy of ClustalW by combining information from local and global
alignments [3]. Other methods of sequence alignment,

such as iterative, all-against-all, and hybrid approaches
have also been shown to improve the accuracy of ClustalW, although some necessitate significant increases in
computational power [4-7]. Regardless of the method,
when DNA is aligned it is done so in a manner that
arranges sequences to minimize gaps and mismatches to
achieve a maximal score based on sequence identity and
similarity.
Given that codon triplets are considered the unit of
coding sequence evolution, DNA alignments that do not
constrain codons are likely to misrepresent the encoded
information [8]. For example, to meet the optimality criteria used in the alignment of DNA sequences, single
gaps are frequently inserted and thus distort the reading
frame (Figure 1, left). Essentially, for coding sequences, an
"optimal" alignment of DNA may ignore the rules that
govern its translation into protein. As a result, the evolu-

Figure 1 Codon delimited multiple sequence alignment. Two unaligned cDNA sequences with translated peptides (top-left). Peptide
sequences are aligned (top-right) and cDNA codons are matched to
their corresponding amino acids to create the codon-delimited alignment (bottom-right). Aligning the sequences by cDNA rather than by
peptide results in partitioning of codons (bottom-left).

tionary constraints placed on the protein product are lost
in the analysis. A straightforward solution to the problem
would be to perform a codon-based alignment that does
not allow the partition of codons (Figure 1, right). The
codon-based alignment can then be used to detect adaptive molecular evolution or purifying selection by estimating the number of non-synonymous and synonymous
substitutions (dN/dS). In general, the aligned sequences
are screened for dN/dS ratios of >1 (adaptive) or dN/dS
ratios of < 1 (purifying).
There are currently several informatics tools freely
available that calculate dN/dS ratios to measure evolutionary selection or generate codon-delimited alignments. The online program OCPAT is able to generate
codon-delimited of alignments from human gene IDs and
their putative orthologs from other vertebrates; however,
OCPAT is not able to calculate dN/dS scores [9]. Most of
the programs that calculate dN/dS require a codondelimited alignment. For example, the programs SNAP
(Synonymous Non-synonymous Analysis Program) and
WINA (Window Analysis) employ user provided alignments to calculate substitution rates, where WINA also
allows for the use of sliding window analysis [10-12].
SWAKK (Sliding Window Analysis of Ka and Ks) uses
pairwise sequence alignments, sliding windows, and
structural alignment to identify regions of positive selection [13]. DNaSP (DNA Sequence Polymorphism) allows
for the detection of diversifying selection by measuring
DNA polymorphisms and also uses sliding window analysis [14].
In an effort to simplify the process, PAL2NAL (v12)
takes pre-aligned protein and the corresponding
unaligned coding DNA to generate codon-delimited
alignments. While useful, PAL2NAL is constrained to
pairwise dN/dS analysis, does not include graphing, and
does not allow the user to edit the codeml control file
[15]. The popular program PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis
by Maximum Likelihood) is able to perform both pairwise and site-based dN/dS calculations. However, it does

not have a GUI (graphical user interface) and visualization of the output data can be cumbersome. In addition, it
requires the input of pre-aligned sequences [8]. More
recently, IDEA (Interactive Display For Evolutionary
Analyses) has implemented a GUI for both PAML and
Phylip (Phylogeny Inference Package) and is amenable for
high throughput genome-wide analysis [4]. While IDEA
is a powerful tool, it does not run on the Windows operating system, requires the separate installation of several
support programs, uses multiple languages, generates
graphs that are difficult to configure, and also requires a
codon-delimited alignment.
We have designed JCoDA to be an easy-to-use tool that
integrates several common functions required for the
detection of evolutionary selection in coding sequences.
Specifically, the steps that are now controlled from the
JCoDA interface: generation of codon-delimited alignments, generation of phylogenetic trees, estimation of site
and regional dN/dS scores under multiple models of substitution, and the generation of user configurable graphical output. JCoDA only requires unaligned coding
sequences (CDS) in FASTA format and it takes advantage
of the freely available BioJava framework [16], ClustalW
[17], Phylip [18], and PAML [8] to identify positive/negative evolutionary selection. The visualization options in
JCoDA include a variety of common alignment formats,
and user configurable scalable graphs with sliding window options for pairwise or gene family comparisons. To
demonstrate the types of analyses facilitated by JCoDA,
we have performed an analysis of 25 sex determination
genes in nematodes and identified genes under positive
selection, regional positive selection, and differences in
selective pressure likely due to functional constraints.

Implementation
JCoDA was designed to assist in performing common
operations associated with evolutionary analysis. It coordinates the passage of information from the initial alignments (ClustalW version 2.0) to the calculation of dN/dS
(yn00 or codeml, version 4.1) to the visualization of output. For site-based analysis of selection we have packaged
JCoDA with a graphical interface for Phylip (version 3.6)
that allows for the generation of phylogenetic trees.
JCoDA is written entirely in Java, which allows for the
addition of supplementary modules that offer additional
functionality. To allow for easy installation, JCoDA is
packaged with all of the required components (ClustalW,
Phylip, and PAML) and can be installed on any computer
with a Windows operating system (or virtual machine)
and Java Runtime Environment 6 (JRE 6) (if Java 1.6 has
been installed). For ease of operation, installation of Java
Developer Kit 6 bundled with NetBeans (JDK, which
includes JRE 6) is recommended http://java.sun.com/
javase/downloads/index.jsp.

Steinway et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:284

JCoDA provides two options for calculation of dN/dS
scores: regional pairwise calculation via sliding window
or a site-specific calculation. Pairwise dN/dS performs
the calculation between any user-selected sequences
from a list of all possible comparisons presented in the
GUI. For sliding window pairwise calculations, the size of
the window, jump, and substitution models are configurable via drop down menus. Once the selected sequence
comparisons are submitted, JCoDA parses through them
by window, converts them to Phylip format, and feeds
each window to PAML (yn00) suite to calculate dN/dS.
JCoDA does this iteratively over all windows until the end
of the selected sequence pair. The potential benefit of the
sliding window option is that it can be performed very
quickly and it is able to extract information about
regional selection. However, it is important to note that
methods that incorporate sliding windows have been
demonstrated to be prone to artifact arising due to resampling and illustrate the importance of incorporating
site-based methods and the likelihood ratio test in
sequence analysis [19].
JCoDA takes advantage of the codeml executable
included in the PAML package to implement site-specific
dN/dS calculation. Similar to pairwise comparisons,
JCoDA converts all inputted sequences to Phylip format
and feeds them to codeml. In order for a site-based dN/
dS calculation to be performed, the user must provide a
tree file and set its path for use in the GUI. To allow for
this operation, the JCoDA package includes a Java based
graphical interface for the Phylip package [18], http://
evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html).
The
Phylip Graphical Interface (PGI) allows for the generation
of trees using neighbor-joining, parsimony, or maximum
likelihood based methods of either DNA or protein.
Regardless of the source of the tree file, JCoDA will
accept any tree in Phylip format.
JCoDA implements M7 (fit to a beta distribution, dN/
dS > 1 disallowed) -vs- M8 (fit to a beta distribution, dN/
dS > 1 allowed) and M1a (nearly neutral) -vs- M2a (positive selection) in conjunction with the likelihood ratio
test to check for evidence of positive selection [20]. To
maintain JCoDA's flexibility, the user is given the option
to access the complete codeml control file as a selectable
advanced options tab to vary other parameters.

Results and Discussion
Input requirements and alignments

The JCoDA user interface, input requirements, and
installation have been designed to be easier to use while
retaining the underlying power of the codeml and yn00
programs from the PAML package (Additional File 1,
Additional File 2, Additional File 3, Additional File 4 and
Additional File 5). For example, we have simplified the
input requirements to the coding sequences (CDS) in

FASTA format. There were two primary reasons for this
streamlined approach. First, CDS can be readily batch
retrieved from NCBI or organism specific databases such
as Wormbase (WormMart) [20]. Second, the risk of mismatch between DNA and protein sequences is eliminated
by directly translating the CDS input by the user.
For unaligned CDS, the sequences are translated by the
BioJava framework [16] and the proteins are passed to
ClustalW for alignment. JCoDA generates a codondelimited alignment using the protein alignment from
ClustalW as a guide to prevent the interruption of codon
triplets, (Figure 1). JCoDA also accepts pre-aligned protein sequences in FASTA format paired with corresponding unaligned CDS in the same format to allow for the use
of sequences aligned in another program or modified by
hand. When provided with prealigned protein sequences
and corresponding CDS, JCoDA simply circumvents
ClustalW and performs the codon-delimited alignment
directly.
Visualization and output

Navigation in JCoDA has been designed around the use
of a tabbed GUI that allows for shuffling between graphs
and sequence alignments (Figure 2). We have implemented JFreeChart http://www.jfree.org to generate
robust graphs of dN/dS scores by both sliding window
and site-specific methods. The graphs are extensively
customizable, dynamically scaled, and can be saved as
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files (Figure 3 and 4A).
The user can export protein and DNA alignment files in
ClustalW, Phylip (v3.2 and v4), and hybrid protein/DNA
codon-delimited formats using the file menu. The dN/dS
scores from all models selected, including p values, can
be exported as common separated values (CSV) files
allowing for further analysis in database, spreadsheet, and
graphing programs (Figure 4B).
Benchmarking

The use of JCoDA interface does not add significantly to
the time need required to run ClustalW, Phylip, or
PAML. Any time costs incurred are more than ameliorated by the integration of multiple tasks. For example,
the user does not have to reformat sequences to shuttle
them from one program to another or use an additional
program to obtain graphical representations of the data.
To test the ability of JCoDA to recover signatures of
directional selection, we used multiple datasets including
TRIM5α (hominids + OWMs) [21], nef gene of HIV-1
(pairwise and ML) [22], lysozyme [23], and a subset of
HIV1 protease and reverse transcriptase sequences from
the HIV positive selection mutation database [24]. We
have included an analysis of the sex determination genes
in nematodes to illustrate the utility of JCoDA in identification of directional selection.

Figure 2 JCoDA interface. A) The JCoDA interface accepts cDNA in FASTA format and JCoDA manages the generation of codon delimited alignments, pairwise or site-based dN/dS calculation through PAML, and graphing of either output (top). The codon delimited alignment tab is shown.
Common options are displayed on the main interface and the file menu contains export options. Outputs, such as raw data, alignments, and graphs
are displayed in tabbed panes for easy navigation. Graphs for multiple models are retained in the tabbed interface for comparison. For pairwise dN/
dS the user the selects sequences from a list using add/remove buttons. The advanced options check box provides direct access to the codeml control
file as a tabbed pane. For site-based analysis JCoDA defaults to implement models M7 (null, neutral) -vs- M8 (alternate, selection) in codeml. The user
can set the path for their own tree file or use the PHYLIP graphical interface (PGI) to generate phylogenetic a tree (bottom).

Evolutionary selection in the nematode sex determination
pathway

The extreme divergence in sex determination pathway
components has made their analysis problematic using
comparison of distantly related species (e.g. C. elegans vs- D. melanogaster) The recent availability of sequence
information from nematodes related to Caenorhabditis
elegans (C. elegans) has provided the raw material for the

analysis of sex determination pathway components where
sequence divergence has not erased all evidence of directional selection. We used the JCoDA interface to perform
a screen for directional selection using all known sex
determination pathway components in nematodes closely
related to C. elegans. We were able to identify genes that
have been previously shown (or suspected) to be under
positive selection. Furthermore, we identified differences

in selection between genes based on their function in the
sex determination cascade (Table 1).
Relative to the genome wide C. elegans/C. briggsae dN/
dS ratio of 0.06 [25], the majority of sex determination
genes show elevated levels of non-synonymous substitutions in pairwise comparisons (Table 1, dN/dS, 0.06 -vs0.23). Considerable variability within each category was
present but there are no significant differences in average

pairwise dN/dS scores between the categories. Interestingly, site-based analysis reveals evidence for positive
selection in five of nine genes involved exclusively in
germ line sex determination and five of nine genes
involved in the specification of somatic sex (dosage compensation). In contrast, positive selection was only
detected in one gene of seven genes involved in both
germ line and somatic pathways (Table 1, grey). Evidence

Genes are sorted based on functions in germ line and somatic sex determination (B), somatic sex determination (dosage compensation) (S),
or germ line sex determination (G). All sex determination gene orthologs used were identified by reciprocal best-hit or conserved synteny
(Wormbase). Only genes with large indels and obvious mispredictions that could be resolved were eliminated. dN/dS = average pairwise
score for the gene family (Nei & Gojobori, 1986). Models compared for likelihood ratio test (LRT) were M7(dN/dS>1 disallowed, null) -vsM8(dN/dS>1 allowed, alternate), where bold indicates number higher than critical value (Df = 2, χ2l = 5.9915, p = 0.05) and rejection of the
null. Portion of sites with dN/dS>1 was calculated as a ratio of selected sites with a probability higher than 0.5 of dN/dS>1 to total sites. Tree
files were based on the ClustalW alignments using the neighbor-joining method (Phylip). See associated FASTA files for ID numbers and
species used. (*) = species specific gene expansion or contains species specific duplications.

of fewer genes that function in multiple pathways with
signatures of positive selection likely reflects resistance to
change based on additional function constraints.
Positive selection can be difficult to detect when high
levels of sequence divergence are present and dS is essentially saturated [26]. Haag and Ackerman (2005) [27]
measured nucleotide diversity using sliding windows to
detect patches of diversifying selection in C. remanei fem3 (feminization in XX and XO). We processed the same
dataset with JCoDA and confirmed the presence of posi-

tive selection clustered between amino acids 339 and 408
(relative to AY142113), a highly polymorphic region of
the protein (Table 2). Also consistent with their data, the
tra-2 region used did not show evidence of positive selection, although the dN/dS ratio was elevated (Table 2, dN/
dS, 0.37). As additional intraspecies sequence information is collected, it is likely that the capability to detect
positive selection will be significantly enhanced.
Examples of the graphical output generated by JCoDA
are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The GLD-1 (defective in

germ line development) RNA binding protein governs the
translation of numerous mRNA targets including functioning with FOG-2 in the promotion of spermatogenesis
in the hermaphrodite [26,28,29]. As expected, pairwise
sliding window analysis reveals that extensive purifying
selection dominates regions with homology to the RNA
binding GSG (GRP33/Sam68/GLD-1) domain (Figure 3,
GSG domain). Interestingly, elevated levels of dN/dS
were detected at both the N and C-terminal ends relative
to the average pairwise dN/dS for gld-1 (0.07). Using sitebased analysis, we confirmed the presence of residues
under positive selection (Figure 4B). Curiously, even
though GLD-1 orthologs in C. elegans and C. briggsae
share significant amino acid homology (80% identity, 90%
similarity) and have a dN/dS ratio consistent with purifying selection, they have opposite functions in sex determination [30]. We speculate that species-specific
functions could be explained by at least two mechanisms.
First, the extensive conservation in the KH-domain
between C. elegans and C. briggsae suggests that at least
some of the species differences in GLD-1 function can be
explained by a change in mRNA targets. Second, based
on the elevated non-synonymous substations at the N
and C-terminal ends, we can infer that some changes in
GLD-1 function could result from species-specific interactions or regulation.

Conclusions
An important part of the analysis of homologous coding
sequences is the characterization of evolutionary selection by comparing the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. The primary issues with these
types of analyses are the difficulty in generating codondelimited alignments, shuttling between programs, and
the complexity in configuring programs that are designed
to detect positive selection. JCoDA provides a simple
platform that integrates several common functions associated with evolutionary analysis of coding sequences and
the detection of positive/negative selection. JCoDA is a
modular tool built using the BioJava framework, ClustalW, Phylip, and PAML that allows for the rapid assess-

ment and visualization of the pairwise and site-based
selection pressure on coding sequences. Using JCoDA we
were able to identify multiple sex determination pathway
genes with evidence of positive selection based on functional constraints. The JCoDA executable, source code,
