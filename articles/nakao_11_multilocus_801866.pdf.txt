from Uganda

Abstract
Background: The rickettsial bacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium is the causative agent of heartwater in ruminants. A
better understanding of the population genetics of its different strains is, however, needed for the development of
novel diagnostic tools, therapeutics and prevention strategies. Specifically, the development of effective vaccination
policies relies on the proper genotyping and characterisation of field isolates. Although multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST) has been recently developed, only strains from geographically restricted collections have been analysed so
far. The expansion of the MLST database to include global strains with different geographic origins is therefore
essential. In this study, we used a panel of reference strains from geographically diverse origins and field samples of
E. ruminantium detected from its vector, Amblyomma variegatum, in heartwater-endemic areas in Uganda.
Results: A total of 31 novel alleles (six, four, six, three, two, five, three, and two for gltA, groEL, lepA, lipA, lipB, secY,
sodB, and sucA loci, respectively) and 19 novel sequence types (STs) were identified. Both neighbour-joining and
minimum spanning tree analyses indicated a high degree of genetic heterogeneity among these strains. No
association was observed between genotypes and geographic origins, except for four STs from West African
countries. When we performed six different tests for recombination (GeneConv, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan,
and 3Seq) on concatenated sequences, four possible recombination events were identified in six different STs. All the
recombination breakpoints were located near gene borders, indicating the occurrence of intergenic recombination.
All four STs that localized to a distinct group in clustering analysis showed evidence of identical recombination
events, suggesting that recombination may play a significant role in the diversification of E. ruminantium.
Conclusions: The compilation of MLST data set across the African continent will be particularly valuable for the
understanding of the existing genetic diversity of field isolates in African countries. Comprehensive information on the
degree of cross-protection between strains and further understanding of possible relationships between genotypes and
phenotypes such as vaccine efficacy are expected to lead to the development of region-specific vaccination strategies.

Background
The rickettsial bacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium is the
causative agent of heartwater in ruminants, a potential
zoonotic disease [1,2] transmitted by ticks of the genus
Amblyomma that causes considerable livestock losses in
endemic countries [3]. Heartwater is distributed in nearly

all countries of sub-Saharan Africa and has also extended
into some islands of the Caribbean, from where it may
spread into the American mainland [4]. Evidence from
several vaccine trials indicate that a wide range of E.
ruminantium genotypes with differing cross-protection
capacities were simultaneously circulating in the same
region [5,6], leading to a poor vaccine efficacy. Therefore,
the proper genotyping and characterisation of field isolates of E. ruminantium is an important prerequisite for
the development of effective vaccination strategies at
regional levels.

Several methods have been developed to genotype
E. ruminantium. Specifically, typing based on the map1
(major antigenic protein 1) gene has been extensively
used and proven to be useful for estimating the genetic
diversity of E. ruminantium strains [7-9]. However,
these methods are not reliable without proper knowledge of phylogenetic relatedness. Multi-locus sequence
typing (MLST) is in turn a powerful typing method that
allows determining genetic diversity as well as phylogenetic relationships. Recently, Adakal et al. developed a
MLST scheme for E. ruminantium based on eight different housekeeping genes [10]. This method was further
evaluated by the same authors and proved to have a
resolution high enough to discriminate even between
closely related genotypes circulating in Burkina Faso
[11]. However, currently available MLST profiles are
limited to geographically restricted collections. Considering the wide distribution of E. ruminantium across
the African continent, the expansion of the MLST database to include global strains from different geographic
origins is therefore needed.
The aim of this study was to examine the MLST method
by using a panel of reference strains from geographically
diverse origins. Additionally, eight E. ruminantium-positive Amblyomma variegatum collected in Uganda were
also investigated to determine the usefulness of this
method for the detection of genotypes presently circulating in heartwater-endemic areas. The collection of these
data sets is aimed at contributing further to the development of a global database of E. ruminantium genotypes.

Methods
E. ruminantium reference strains

The following 14 E. ruminantium strains were sequenced:
Ball 3, Burkina Faso, Crystal Springs, Ifé Nigeria, Kerr Seringe, Kiswani, Kwanyanga, Lutale, Pokoase 417, Sankat
430, São Tomé, Senegal, Um Banein, and Zeerust. Their
geographic origins and years of isolation are shown in
Table 1. All strains were cultured in bovine aorta endothelial cells as described previously [12] and subjected to
DNA extraction using the Nucleospin Tissue Kit
(Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany).
E. ruminantium-positive A. variegatum from Uganda

Eight E. ruminantium-positive tick samples detected by
pCS20 PCR [13] were used. Ticks were collected from
indigenous cattle from December, 2008 to January, 2009
at heartwater-endemic areas in five different districts in
Uganda: Amuria (33.38°W, 02.01°N), Dokolo (33.10°W,
01.55°N), Pallisa (33.42°W, 01.10°N), Soroti (33.36°W,
01.43°N), and Tororo (34.11°W, 00.41°N). A total of two
(A004 and A006), one (D002), two (P003 and P006), two
(S001 and S013), and one (T009) samples were collected

in Amuria, Dokolo, Pallisa, Soroti, and Tororo,
respectively.
Sequencing analysis

The following eight housekeeping genes were used for
DNA sequencing: gltA, groEL, lepA, lipA, lipB, secY, sodB,
and sucA. PCR amplification was conducted using the
KAPA 2G Robust PCR Kit as reported by Adakal et al.
[10]. PCR products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (USB
Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced using the
BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI Prism
3130 x genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA sequences
obtained were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan
(DDBJ) (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) under accession numbers AB625780 to AB625787 (gltA), AB625788 to
AB625796 (groEL), AB625797 to AB625810 (lepA),
AB625811 to AB625824 (lipA), AB625825 to AB625838
(lipB), AB625839 to AB625852 (secY), AB625853 to
AB625860 (sodB), and AB625861 to AB625874 (sucA).
Data analysis

Sequences were analysed using GENETYX version 9.1
(GENETYX Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and were
trimmed on both the 5’ and 3’ ends according to the
previous report [10]. The Gardel, Welgevonden (Erwe),
and Welgevonden (Erwo) sequences were obtained from
the GenBank database (GenBank accession numbers:
CR925677, CR925678, and CR767821, respectively).
Eight genotypes (Strains 2, 331, 469, 623, 629, 630, 668,
and 1062) identified in A. variegatum from Burkina
Faso [10] were subjected to phylogenetic, cluster, and
recombination analyses. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out for concatenated sequences of eight genes using
MEGA 4 programme [14]. Allele sequences for each
strain were concatenated in the order gltA-sucA-lepAsodB-lipA-secY-lipB-groEL resulting in a final composite
length of 3,419 bp. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method with
1,000 bootstrap replicates. For each MLST locus, an
allele number was assigned to each unique variant.
Those sequences identical to previously known alleles
were assigned the same allele numbers, whereas those
that did not match any known allele were given new
allele numbers. A sequence type (ST) was assigned to
each distinct combination of alleles at the eight MLST
loci. A minimum-spanning tree (MST) was generated
using BioNumerics software version 6.5 (Applied Maths,
Saint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The Simpson’s diversity
index (DI) was calculated for each locus to determine its
discriminatory power. Alignment files of each gene locus
and concatenated sequences of all loci were imported

into SplitsTree4 program version 4.11.3 [15] and a preliminary network was obtained using the neighbour-net
algorithm [16]. PHI test was conducted to determine
whether recombination events were statistically significant. We further evaluated recombination events using
six methods implemented in Recombination Detection
Program version 3.44 (RDP3) [17], including GeneConv
[18], Bootscan [19], MaxChi [20], Chimaera [21], SiScan
[22], and 3Seq [23]. If one sequence was identical to
another sequence, only one representative sequence
from each group was included in this analysis.

Results and Discussion
All MLST loci were successfully amplified from the 14
reference strains and eight Ugandan tick samples. The
sequencing analysis of the amplified PCR products
revealed that 103 nucleotide sites (3.01%) were polymorphic in a total of 3,419 bp from the eight MLST loci
(Table 1). The lowest number of polymorphisms per
locus was seven in the sodB, followed by 10 in lepA, 11
in the groEL and lipA, 12 in the sucA, 13 in the lipB, 15
in the gltA, and 24 in the secY locus. The percentage of
polymorphic sites ranged from 1.69% in sodB to 4.09%

Nakao et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:137
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/137

in the secY locus. Since multiple sequences were not
detected by direct sequencing of PCR products, we
assumed that the sequences obtained from each locus
originated from a single population.
SodB was the most conserved locus among the strains
examined in this study, as similarly found for a previous
comparison among E. ruminantium-positive tick samples
in Burkina Faso [11], indicating that sodB, and specifically
E. ruminantium-specific sodB LAMP [13], is a suitable target for the genetic identification of this species. Conversely, the locus with highest percentage of polymorphic
sites was secY (4.09%), which is similar to the percentage
previously observed for Burkina Faso (4.60%) [11]. Out of
103 single nucleotide polymorphisms, a total of 22 (21.4%)
resulted in nonsynonymous amino acid changes. The
ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions
(dN/dS) were 0.36, 0.22, 0.43, 0.22, 0.30, 0.14, 0.40, and
0.33 for gltA, groEL, lepA, lipA, lipB, secY, sodB, and sucA
loci, respectively, indicating an accumulation of synonymous mutations at all loci.
Three sets of strains or tick samples, the pair Kerr
Seringe and Sankat 430, the pair D002 and P006, and the
triplet A004, A006, and T009, had identical sequences in
all eight MLST loci. Although Kerr Seringe and Sankat
430 were from geographically isolated countries (The
Gambia and Ghana, respectively [24,25]), a high level of
similarity in the sequences from these strains have been
previously reported based on the analysis of the highly
polymorphic map1 gene [8]. Therefore, using only these
target genes might not be sufficient to enable the discrimination between closely related strains.
Allele numbers were assigned to each sequence as indicated in Table 1. A total of 31 novel alleles were identified
(six, four, six, three, two, five, three, and two for gltA,
groEL, lepA, lipA, lipB, secY, sodB, and sucA loci, respectively). To evaluate the discriminatory power of each
locus, DI values were calculated using BioNumerics software. DI ranges from 0 to 100, namely from a low to a
high diversity. The lowest DIs were associated with the
lipA (42.0) and sodB (47.0) loci, suggesting that these
genes are the least informative, as the DI values for the
other loci were higher than 70.0. This result is also
reflected in the identical allelic profiles for the lipA and
sod B loci in the eight Ugandan tick samples (Table 1).
STs were determined for each reference strain and tick
sample based on the alleles identified at each locus. Out of
25 samples (17 reference strains and eight Ugandan tick
samples), a total of 21 STs were identified. Except for the
STs of the Gardel and Welgevonden (Erwo) strains, which
were also included in a previous study [10], 19 STs were
novel.
In addition to 17 reference strains and eight Ugandan
samples, eight STs previously detected in A. variegatum
from Burkina Faso were included for further analyses.

We first performed a cluster analysis based on ST profiles. The resulting MST revealed the existence of three
main groups (named I, II, and III) (Figure 1). Group I
was the largest, consisting of four reference strains and
three Ugandan tick samples. Group II was composed of
two reference strains and three samples from Burkina
Faso and one sample from Uganda. Group III consisted
of three reference strains and two samples from Burkina
Faso. Eight reference strains and seven samples, three
from Burkina Faso and four from Uganda, were not
included in any group. There was no association
between groups and geographic origins, except for four
STs in group III, all of which originated from West African countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, and The
Gambia). A phylogenetic analysis based on a 3,419-bp
concatenated sequence of eight genes revealed that
these four STs were also clustered together, while others
were not clustered according to their geographic origins
in a NJ tree (Additional file 1). Therefore, even though
MST and NJ analyses rely on distinct analytical principles, both methods suggested a high degree of genetic
heterogeneity among the strains examined and highlighted the genetic isolation of STs in group III.
There are several hypotheses that could explain the cause
of a lack of association between STs and their geographic
origins. For example, the migration of E. ruminantium
from other endemic regions, presumably due to transportation of infected animals or ticks, as previously evidenced by
the introduction of this pathogen into the Caribbean [26],
could be responsible. Another possible cause is the temporal spread in terms of the year of isolation; for example,
the Ball 3 strain was isolated prior to 1952 [27], while field
samples from Burkina Faso and Uganda were collected in
2007-2008 [10] and 2008-2009, respectively. However, we
cannot rule out the possibility that this typing method, particularly when employed with the current set of target loci,
is not suitable for tracing geographic origins of bacteria, for
example, because of the effect of recombination between
different genotypes.
We next conducted a neighbour-net analysis to examine
the impact of recombination on each locus separately and
on the concatenated sequence of all STs. The resulting
graphs based on the alignments of individual loci showed
tree-like structures and the PHI test did not detect evidence of intragenic recombination (Additional file 2).
However, the graph obtained from an alignment of concatenated sequences showed a network structure (Figure 2),
providing the evidence for the genetic divergence among
the STs examined and highlighting the influence of
recombination events on the evolution of this bacterial
species (PHI test on the significance of recombination:
p = 0.0).
In order to find further evidence for intergenic recombination, we performed six different tests for recombination on

events were identified in six different STs (Kerr Seringe/
Sankat 430, Senegal, Strains 331, 469, 623, and 1062)
(Table 2). A schematic representation of the events is

recombination.

Strain 1062 from Burkina Faso was predicted to be

Uganda as a major parent and Kerr Seringe from The
Gambia (or Sankat 430 from Ghana) as a minor parent

mosaic pattern was observed (Figure 3B). In addition,

be a major parent of a putative recombinant, Strain
623 from Burkina Faso. Considering the geographical

recombinants (Strains 623 and 1062), this result may
support the idea of the existence of a homogeneous
population of an ancestral genotype throughout the
African continent as previously hypothesised by Adakal
et al. [11].

All STs clustered in group III by MST analysis showed
evidence of identical recombination events (events 1 and 3)
(Table 2 and Figure 3A), indicating that recombination
may play a significant role in the diversification of E. ruminantium as previously suggested [10,28-30]. In this collection of samples, however, all the STs predicted to be

recombinants originated from West African countries. One
possible explanation for this regional restriction is that the
recombination events could not be properly detected, for
example, due to the biased sampling and/or low levels of
genetic diversity among the tested strains. Therefore,
further compilation of the MLST data, especially of currently circulating isolates in East and Southern African
countries, will be invaluable for understanding the role of
recombination in bacterial genome evolution and for providing an overview of the current situation of bacterial
genetic diversity in African countries.
Finally, the recombination events identified in this study
demonstrate that a multi-locus genotyping approach,
rather than single-gene based genotyping, is a prerequisite
for a proper understanding of phylogenetic relationships
of E. ruminantium. The failure to discriminate between
two closely related strains, Kerr Seringe and Sankat 430,
highlights the need to either improve the MLST method
or to develop other multi-locus genotyping methods with
higher resolution power, such as the multi-locus variablenumber tandem repeat analysis.

Conclusions
We investigated a recently developed MLST scheme that
allows direct genotyping of E. ruminantium by using global strains from diverse origins and field samples from
heartwater-endemic areas in Uganda. As only a limited
dataset consisting of geographically restricted isolates was
available from previous reports, this study expands the
number of allele variants known for each locus. The analyses presented here also provide strong evidence for the
occurrence of recombination events among the STs examined. The compilation of MLST data across the African
continent will be particularly valuable for understanding
the existing genetic diversity of field isolates in African
countries. Comprehensive information on the degree of
cross-protection between strains and further understanding of possible relationships between genotypes and phenotypes such as vaccine efficacy are expected to lead to
the development of region-specific vaccination strategies.
