Abstract
Background: Many mitochondrial genes, especially ribosomal protein genes, have been frequently
transferred as functional entities to the nucleus during plant evolution, often by an RNA-mediated
process. A notable case of transfer involves the rps14 gene of three grasses (rice, maize, and
wheat), which has been relocated to the intron of the nuclear sdh2 gene and which is expressed
and targeted to the mitochondrion via alternative splicing and usage of the sdh2 targeting peptide.
Although this transfer occurred at least 50 million years ago, i.e., in a common ancestor of these
three grasses, it is striking that expressed, nearly intact pseudogenes of rps14 are retained in the
mitochondrial genomes of both rice and wheat. To determine how ancient this transfer is, the
extent to which mitochondrial rps14 has been retained and is expressed in grasses, and whether
other transfers of rps14 have occurred in grasses and their relatives, we investigated the structure,
expression, and phylogeny of mitochondrial and nuclear rps14 genes from 32 additional genera of
grasses and from 9 other members of the Poales.
Results: Filter hybridization experiments showed that rps14 sequences are present in the
mitochondrial genomes of all examined Poales except for members of the grass subfamily
Panicoideae (to which maize belongs). However, PCR amplification and sequencing revealed that
the mitochondrial rps14 genes of all examined grasses (Poaceae), Cyperaceae, and Joinvilleaceae
are pseudogenes, with all those from the Poaceae sharing two 4-NT frameshift deletions and all
those from the Cyperaceae sharing a 5-NT insertion (only one member of the Joinvilleaceae was
examined). cDNA analysis showed that all mitochondrial pseudogenes examined (from all three
families) are transcribed, that most are RNA edited, and that surprisingly many of the edits are
reverse (U→C) edits. Putatively nuclear copies of rps14 were isolated from one to several
members of each of these three Poales families. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the nuclear
genes are probably the products of three independent transfers.
Conclusion: The rps14 gene has, most likely, been functionally transferred from the
mitochondrion to the nucleus at least three times during the evolution of the Poales. The transfers
in Cyperaceae and Poaceae are relatively ancient, occurring in the common ancestor of each family,
roughly 80 million years ago, whereas the putative Joinvilleaceae transfer may be the most recent
case of functional organelle-to-nucleus transfer yet described in any organism. Remarkably, nearly
intact and expressed pseudogenes of rps14 have persisted in the mitochondrial genomes of most

lineages of Poaceae and Cyperaceae despite the antiquity of the transfers and of the frameshift and
RNA editing mutations that mark the mitochondrial genes as pseudogenes. Such long-term, nearly
pervasive survival of expressed, apparent pseudogenes is to our knowledge unparalleled in any
genome. Such survival probably reflects a combination of factors, including the short length of
rps14, its location immediately downstream of rpl5 in most plants, and low rates of nucleotide
substitutions and indels in plant mitochondrial DNAs. Their survival also raises the possibility that
these rps14 sequences may not actually be pseudogenes despite their appearance as such. Overall,
these findings indicate that intracellular gene transfer may occur even more frequently in
angiosperms than already recognized and that pseudogenes in plant mitochondrial genomes can be
surprisingly resistant to forces that lead to gene loss and inactivation.

Background

Once a free-living α-proteobacterium, the mitochondrion
has experienced numerous gene losses over time as part of
its endosymbiotic lifestyle, leading to a greatly reduced
number and diversity of genes [1]. Although functional
translocation of coding sequences from the mitochondrion to the nucleus has essentially ceased in animal mitochondria, these seemingly difficult events occur at
surprisingly high frequency in flowering plants. Greatly
extending findings from past studies focusing on single
genes in a limited group of angiosperms (reviewed in [13]), Adams et al. [4] surveyed 280 diverse angiosperms by
Southern blot hybridization and found that all 14 ribosomal protein genes and both sdh genes had been frequently lost from the mitochondrial genome and, most
likely, functionally transferred to the nucleus, whereas
only two putative losses were detected among the other 24
genes, most of which encode respiratory proteins. These
differences in frequency of functional transfer to the
nucleus (and associated mitochondrial gene loss) are
probably largely due to relative ease of protein import
back into the mitochondrion [5-7].
One of the most well-studied and interesting of the frequently transferred ribosomal protein genes is rps14,
which was estimated to have been lost from the mitochondrial genome 27 times separately among the 280
angiosperms surveyed by Adams et al. [4]. Mitochondrial
genome sequencing has confirmed two of these inferred
losses, in Zea [8] (also see [9]) and in Beta [10], but not a
third, in Nicotiana, where a pseudogene copy comprising
most of rps14 is instead present in the mitochondrial
genome [11] (see Discussion for details). rps14 is also
found only as a pseudogene in the mitochondrial genome
in Arabidopsis [12-14], potato [15], Prunus [16], cucumber
[17], rice [18,19], and wheat [20]. So far, an intact and
potentially functional mitochondrial copy of rps14 has
been identified by sequencing in relatively few plants,
namely, Oenothera [21], Brassica [22,23], pea [24], and
broad bean [25].

Transferred, functional copies of rps14 have been well
characterized from the nuclear genomes of Arabidopsis
[26] and three grasses (rice [18], maize [9,27], and wheat
[20]), while a less well- characterized but likely functional
and transferred rps14 gene is represented in EST collections of tomato. The nuclear rps14 genes of rice, maize,
and wheat unquestionably result from the same transfer
event, as they share a highly derived and fascinating structure acquired post-transfer and described below. In contrast, the different structures of nuclear rps14 (in
particular, with respect to their N-terminal targeting elements acquired post transfer) in Arabidopsis and tomato
relative to one another and the grasses indicate that they
are probably each the product of evolutionarily independent transfer events.
The nuclear rps14 genes of the three grasses are located
within the intron of an anciently transferred nuclear gene
that encodes mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit 2 (SDH2). Alternate splicing of the sdh2-rps14 primary transcript results in two different products, a
conventional sdh2 mRNA containing both sdh2 exons and
a chimeric mRNA containing the first exon of sdh2 and
rps14 [9,18]. The products of both mRNAs are thought to
be targeted to the mitochondrion using the N-terminal,
cleavable extension of SDH2, followed by proteolytic
processing of the SDH2-RPS14 fusion precursor to generate mature RPS14 [27].
The mitochondrion-to-nucleus transfer of rps14 in grasses
must have occurred at least 50 million years ago, i.e., in
the last common ancestor of rice, maize, and wheat. It is
therefore striking that nearly intact – and expressed – copies of this gene are still present in the mitochondrial
genomes of two of these plants, rice [18] and wheat [20]
(as noted above, rps14 is absent from maize mitochondrial DNA). To further explore this situation, including
determining exactly when the grass rps14 transfer occurred
and whether other transfers of this gene have occurred in
related plants, we have examined the structure and expression of rps14 from a large number of grasses and other
members of the Poales. Our results show that the grass

Slot blot
Slot blot survey for the presence or absence of rps14 in the mitochondrial genome of members of the Poales.
Shown are 24 of 38 Poales taxa examined by slot blot hybridization with mt cox1 and rps14 probes from Oryza. The three
boxed taxa have highly reduced hybridization of rps14 relative to cox1, suggesting that most of all of rps14 has been lost from
the mitochondrial genome. Positive (Arabidopsis) and negative (Allium) controls were chosen based on the results of Adams et
al. [4]. The two probes were hybridized sequentially to the same membrane, which was stripped in 0.1 × SSC at 100°C after
the first hybridization.

transfer occurred roughly 80 million years ago, in the
common ancestor of all grasses, and is accompanied by
widespread, persistent retention of expressed and nearly
intact pseudogenes among many diverse grass lineages.
We also report two new, apparent cases of rps14 transfer in
Poales, one relatively ancient and the other more recent,
both of which are also accompanied by retention of
expressed mitochondrial pseudogenes.

Results
Slot-blot survey for presence/absence of rps14 in mtDNA
We conducted DNA slot blot hybridizations to survey for
the presence/absence of rps14 in the mitochondrial
genomes of 38 Poales taxa (24 of which are shown in Figure 1). As a positive control, the membranes were first
probed for mitochondrial cox1, a gene found universally
in mitochondrial genomes of all examined eukaryotes,
including the 280 angiosperms surveyed by Adams et al.
[4]. As expected, the cox1 probe hybridized well to all
Poales DNAs tested. The membranes were then stripped
and re-hybridized with a mitochondrial rps14 gene probe
from Oryza. This resulted in strong hybridization, roughly
proportional from slot to slot compared to the cox1 control, to all Poales taxa surveyed with the exceptions of Pennisetum and Zea (Figure 1). These slot blot results are
consistent with published Southern blot data for eight of
these same Poales taxa (Adams et al. [4], as well as the
complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Zea [8],

which shows complete absence of rps14. The two taxa
showing little rps14 hybridization form a monophyletic
group (corresponding to subfamily Panicoideae) relative
to the other Poales examined (Figure 2). Therefore, it
would appear that rps14 has been lost from the mitochondrial genome just once among the Poales examined, in the
common ancestor of the Panicoideae.
We attribute the weak rps14 signal in the Pennisetum and
Zea slots to either non-specific background noise in the
slot or to hybridization to the transferred nuclear copy of
the gene, which exists at low copy number compared to
the mitochondrial genome (all DNAs tested were total
genomic DNAs). Hordeum also showed reduced hybridization strength with rps14 (Figure 1), suggesting that
much or all of its gene might have been lost from the
mitochondrial genome. However, as described below, we
succeeded in isolating by PCR a nearly full-length copy of
rps14 from Hordeum with undiverged sequences typical of
mitochondrial rps14 and, more importantly, we isolated
Hordeum rps14 cDNA sequences that were identical to the
PCR sequence except for six sites of mitochondrial-diagnostic RNA editing. Therefore, we are confident that Hordeum mtDNA does contain rps14. We attribute its reduced
slot blot hybridization to, most likely, slot-specific DNA
shedding after the initial cox1 hybridization. Alternatively,
the reduced intensity of mitochondrial rps14 relative to
cox1 in Hordeum could be real, if the former gene were

rps14 gene status in 44 genera of Poales
rps14 gene status in 44 genera of Poales. The status of rps14 in either the mitochondrial (M) or nuclear (N) genomes is
marked on a phylogenetic tree of Poales as follows: A dark "+" indicates that rps14 is an intact open reading frame over the
length of the gene sequenced. A light "+" indicates that a nuclear rps14 sequence was not obtained by PCR, but is inferred to
be present based on the absence of an intact rps14 gene in the mitochondrial genome of that species. A "ψ" indicates that only
a pseudogene form of rps14 is present in the mitochondrial genome. A "-" indicates that rps14 is inferred to be absent from the
mitochondrial genome based on negative slot blot and/or PCR results. A question mark indicates uncertainty as to whether an
intact copy of rps14 is present in the nucleus because a functional copy was recovered from the mitochondrial genome and
because repeated PCR attempts failed to yield a putative nuclear rps14 sequence. Red bullets mark three separate transfers of
rps14 to the nucleus. The Joinvillea transfer is shown as very recent because of the nuclear gene's limited divergence (see text,
Figure 3, and Additional File 1), whereas the other two transfers are arbitrarily positioned at the midpoint of their internodes.
Black boxes mark mitochondrial sequences for which RNA editing information has been obtained (Table 1). The estimate of
Poales phylogeny are based on GPWG (2001) [61], Kellogg (2001) [62], and Bremer (2002) [38].

(a "sublimon"), with cox1 present on a standard, highcopy-number genome conformation.
Isolation and sequencing of mitochondrial rps14 genes and
cDNAs
Both previously sequenced mitochondrial rps14 genes
from grasses (Oryza and Triticum) are pseudogenes
[18,20]. To determine whether the many other strongly
hybridizing mitochondrial rps14 sequences from grasses
are also pseudogenes, or whether some might be still
intact and possibly functional, we used degenerate primers to PCR-amplify and then sequence rps14 genes from
these and various other Poales. No mitochondrial-like
rps14 sequence was isolated from the two panicoid grasses
examined by slot blots (Figure 1) or from the four other
panicoids examined by PCR (Panicum, Setaria, Saccharum
and Sorghum). This further supports the idea that the gene
disappeared from the mitochondrial genome in the common ancestor of the Panicoideae. In contrast, intact or
nearly intact copies of mitochondrial-like rps14 were isolated from the other 38 Poales taxa examined.

rps14 sequences were deemed to be of likely mitochondrial provenance if one or both of the following criteria
were met: 1) they aligned well with the published mitochondrial rps14 sequences of Oryza and Triticum with limited divergence (Figure 3; Additional File 1), and 2) they
were determined to undergo mitochondrial-characteristic/diagnostic C→U and/or U→C RNA editing. The latter
provides strong evidence for mitochondrial provenance
(RNA editing is unknown for plant nuclear genes). rps14
cDNA sequences are already available for Oryza [18] and
Triticum [20] and were determined for 19 additional puta-

tive mitochondrial genes. Of these 21 genes, 15 showed
evidence of mitochondrial-characteristic RNA editing
(Table 1; see Methods for all controls and precautions
taken to ensure that the inferred RNA edits are all real).
The first criterion is premised on the fact that in virtually
all plants, rates of nucleotide substitutions are much
lower (typically 10–20 times lower at synonymous sites)
for mitochondrial genes than for nuclear genes [28-30].
Consistent with this, in all examined cases, plant mitochondrial genes transferred to the nucleus have accumulated much more sequence divergence than their
homologs still present in the mitochondrion (e.g.,
[30,31]). Although the pseudogene sequences from Cyperus and Scirpus were not checked for editing status and are
relatively divergent (Figure 3; Additional File 1) we nonetheless are able to assign them to the mitochondrial
genome because of their close relationship (including one
shared frameshift; Figure 3 and Additional File 1) with a
third pseudogene sequence from the Cyperaceae, from
Carex, for which RNA editing was demonstrated (Table 1).
All 29 Poaceae mitochondrial rps14 sequences isolated
are pseudogenes sharing the same two frameshift deletions; these are both 4 NT in length and are only 8 NT
apart (Additional File 1). These two deletions are estimated to have occurred about 80 million years ago, in the
last common ancestor of all grasses (Figure 2). Of the nine
non-grass Poales examined, five (representing four families) contain intact mitochondrial rps14 genes, whereas
all three Cyperaceae and the one Joinvilleaceae examined
possess pseudogenes of rps14 in their mitochondrial
genomes (Figure 2; Additional File 1). Joinvillea contains
a single frameshift, which is possibly shared with one of
the two grass-wide 4-NT deletions (see end of Results),

respect, note that RPS14 is an essential protein in the
mitochondrial ribosome, at least in yeast where this issue
has been examined [32].

Isolation and sequencing of nuclear rps14 genes
We also wished to amplify any nuclear copies of rps14
present in the Poales, but the much higher substitution
rates and accumulated divergence in the nucleus combined with the much lower copy number of the nuclear
genome made this more challenging than amplification
of mitochondrial rps14. Nuclear copies of rps14 have
already been reported from three grasses (Zea, Oryza, and
Triticum; [9,18,20]). After numerous attempts with
repeated adjustments to thermocycling parameters and
primer design, we were able to amplify putative nuclear
copies of rps14 sequence from 8 additional Poales (Figure
2). All of these putative nuclear rps14 genes have intact
open reading frames, and in all cases, rps14 is either a
pseudogene in the mitochondrial genome (Carex, Joinvillea, Anomochloa, Pariana, Dendrocalamus, Hordeum), as is
also the case in Oryza and Triticum, or is entirely absent
from the mitochondrial genome (Pennisetum, Sorghum),
as in Zea. We infer [light pluses in the nuclear (N) column
in Figure 2] that an intact, functional copy of rps14 exists
in those many grasses and two Cyperaceae for which
mitochondrial rps14 is a pseudogene and for which a second, putative nuclear copy was not isolated. In this

Nuclear assignment of the newly isolated, intact rps14
genes from Anomochloa, Pariana, Dendrocalamus, Hordeum,
Pennisetum, and Sorghum is straightforward. This is
because all six sequences are highly divergent from mitochondrial rps14 genes and group with 100% bootstrap
support with the previously characterized nuclear rps14
genes from Oryza, Zea, and Triticum (Figure 3). Moreover
the branching order among these nine rps14 genes (Figure
3) is congruent with organismal phylogeny (Figure 2).
Finally, we determined (Figure 4 and data not shown) that
three of the six newly characterized genes (from Hordeum,
Sorghum, and, importantly, the basal grass Anomochloa)
have both homologous N-terminal targeting sequences
and the same nuclear genomic location (inserted within
the spliceosomal intron of nuclear sdh2) as previously
shown for nuclear rps14 of Oryza, Zea, and Triticum
[9,18,20]. We therefore conclude that the functional
transfer of rps14 from the mitochondrial genome into the
nuclear sdh2 intron occurred in a common ancestor of all
grasses.
Unlike the grass situation, assignment of the second,
intact copy of rps14 from Carex as nuclear in location was

Sequences
Sequences upstream of rps14 consistent with separate transfers in Cyperaceae and Poaceae. Shown is an amino
acid alignment of the 5' end of RPS14 and upstream sequences. Sequences are aligned relative to Oryza nuclear rps14 with identical amino acids indicated by dots, gaps by dashes, missing data by "~", and intron-exon junction by a triangle. The lack of
homology between the putative targeting peptides (the N-terminal extensions past the methionine start of the mitochondrial
rps14 genes) of the Carex and grass nuclear genes is consistent with their being the result of separate functional transfers.
Except for a methionine so close (7 amino acids) to the start of the mature RPS14 protein as to produce a potential targeting
peptide too short to likely be functional, the Carex gene lacks a potential (methionine) start codon in the region for which
sequence has been obtained.

not possible based on differential sequence divergence.
This is because this sequence is not significantly more
divergent (Figure 3) than the pseudogene copy of rps14
that is assigned to the mitochondrial genome based on its
RNA editing status (Table 1). In fact both genes from
Carex are relatively divergent compared to most mitochondrial rps14 genes and pseudogenes (Figure 3; Additional File 1). Southern blot hybridization was performed
to assess whether one or both copies of rps14 are present
in Carex mtDNA. A nearly full-length (280 bp) rps14 gene
segment from Oryza mtDNA was used as the probe, as this
sequence is roughly equally divergent from both Carex
genes. The Oryza gene hybridized to only a single band in
all four single digests of Carex total DNA (Figure 5). Double digestion with each of the same four enzymes plus
Hind III gave the pattern expected for a mitochondrial
location of the rps14 pseudogene that was already
assigned to the mitochondrial genome based on its RNA
editing status. That is, Hind III doesn't cut the putative
nuclear rps14 gene of Carex, but does cut the mitochondrial gene 70 NT from its 5' end, and the double digests

consistently produced two bands of the relative intensities
expected given the location of this Hind III site (Figure 5).
There is a formal possibility that the second, putatively
nuclear rps14 gene of Carex is located instead in the mitochondrial genome, immediately downstream of the mitochondrial pseudogene, i.e., within the roughly 650 bp
region of the ca. 900 bp Hind III double digestion product
of Figure 5 that contains the bulk of the pseudogene.
However, such proximal duplications have not been seen
in plant mtDNAs; instead these very large and mostly
noncoding genomes rearrange at very high rates, and
duplicates are relatively far apart from each other
[8,10,11,14,23,33].
A second important line of evidence consistent with a
nuclear location of the intact rps14 gene of Carex is that its
reading frame is extended significantly at its 5' end, by at
least 32 codons. Such extensions are uncommon in mitochondrial-resident genes, but are typical of mitochondrial
genes transferred to the nucleus [2,3], where they commonly serve as cleavable targeting sequences that direct

Southern blot hybridization indicating that Joinvillea and Carex mtDNAs contain only one copy of rps14
Figure 5
Southern blot hybridization indicating that Joinvillea and Carex mtDNAs contain only one copy of rps14. The
probe used in both panels contains the entire (~280 bp) mitochondrial rps14 gene from Oryza. The A lanes contain single
digests with the indicated restriction enzymes, each set of which does not cut within the mitochondrial rps14 pseudogene of
Joinvillea or Carex, respectively. The B lanes are double digests with the indicated enzyme plus Hind III, which cuts each mitochondrial rps14 locus 70 bp from its 5' end, but which does not cut the putatively nuclear rps14 genes from Joinvillea and Carex.
import into the mitochondrion (the Carex 5' extension is
predicted by TargetP v1.1 [34] to be a signal peptide, but
not specifically to target to the mitochondrion). It seems
particularly unlikely that an essentially adjacent duplication of rps14 within the mitochondrial genome would
have occurred in such a manner as to create a perfect
duplication of the normal-length rps14 coding sequence
without any trace of rpl5, which in virtually all

angiosperms is separated by only 1 NT from the 5' end of
rps14 (see below).
Overall, therefore, these two lines of evidence strongly
suggest that the intact rps14 gene of Carex is not located in
the same genome as the Carex mitochondrial pseudogene.
Because mitochondrial sequences have never been found
transferred to plant chloroplast genomes, but are fre-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:55

quently transferred to the nucleus [2,19], and because
chloroplast DNA is invariably present in higher copy than
mtDNA, a chloroplast location of the intact Carex rps14
gene can be ruled out. By default, therefore, this gene is
almost certainly present in the nuclear genome.
The second, intact copy of rps14 from Joinvillea is also not
notably more divergent than its RNA-edited – and thus
indisputably mitochondrial – pseudogene copy (Figure
3), although in this case neither gene is particular divergent. A similar Southern blot analysis (Figure 5) as for
Carex also reveals that the mitochondrial pseudogene of
Joinvillea is present in much higher copy number than the
intact copy of rps14 (as with Carex, the double-digestion
enzyme Hind III cuts the pseudogene 70 bp from its 5' end
but does not cut the intact gene). Two of the doubledigests also localize the predominant mitochondrial rps14
hybridization signal in Joinvillea to a small fragment of
about 1 kb, again reducing the possibility of intragenomic
rps14 duplication to immediately adjacent duplication.
Despite considerable effort (see Methods), we did not succeed in obtaining sequence upstream of the normal rps14
start codon for the intact rps14 gene of Joinvillea, and in
this sense, therefore, the case for its nuclear location is
weaker than for Carex. Nonetheless, we think it likely
based on the Southern blot results that this gene is in the
nucleus. At the same time, we cannot rule out the possibility that the putatively nuclear copy of rps14 is in fact
located in the mitochondrial genome, but present only on
a "sublimon" form of the genome of sufficiently low copy
number relative to the principal genome conformer as to
be undetectable at the sensitivity level of the Southern
blots shown in Figure 5.
Number of rps14 transfers and evolution of transferred
rps14 genes
Although we have not shown that the putatively nuclear
rps14 genes of Carex and Joinvillea are expressed, much less
that their products are targeted to the mitochondrion,
what seems relatively clear (especially in Carex) is that in
both plants the mitochondrial genome contains only a
single, pseudogene copy of rps14. Therefore, the functional copy of rps14 almost certainly resides in the nucleus
in Carex and Joinvillea, and since these are the only intact
genes isolated via PCR, they are the best candidates for
being the functional, transferred copy of rps14. That the
Carex nuclear gene has an intact open reading frame in the
face of substantial sequence divergence (Figure 3) strongly
supports it being under selection and therefore functional,
as does the fact that its estimated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution (dN/dS) is substantially
lower (0.28) than 1.0. Nuclear rps14 of Joinvillea displays
relatively little divergence (Figure 3; Additional File 3),
and therefore its intactness is not very compelling evi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/55

dence for it being functional. Strong evidence, however,
comes from its dN/dS ratio, of 0.16.
Accepting that the intact rps14 genes of Carex and Joinvillea
do indeed represent cases of functional transfer to the
nucleus, then we can ask whether they and the set of transferred genes in grasses result from a single common transfer, or from two or three independent transfers. Taken
together, four lines of evidence, none individually strong,
lead us to conclude that these three sets of transferred
genes are probably the product of three separate transfer
events. First, the three nuclear gene sets do not group
together in phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3), as would be
expected if they were the product of a single common
transfer. At the same time, we must acknowledge that the
separation of the three nuclear gene sets is not robust, and
that none of the three attaches specifically to its cognate
mitochondrial gene clade, as expected under the hypothesis of three separate transfers, specifically in the last common ancestors of the grasses, the Joinvilleaceae, and the
Cyperaceae. On the other hand, given the very strong
grouping of the entire clade of transferred genes of grasses
(including the basal grass Anomochloa), and that Joinvillea
is the closely related sister group of grasses (Figure 2), its
failure to group with the grass genes (Figure 3) suggests
separate transfers.
Second, and related to this last point, the nuclear rps14 of
Joinvillea is not very divergent in general and is far less
divergent than the nuclear genes of grasses (Figure 3).
Nuclear substitution rates do not appear to be unusually
low in Joinvillea [35,36], and therefore this result suggests
more recent – and thus independent – transfer of rps14 in
Joinvillea compared to grasses.
Third, and here we have data relevant only to the Carex
and grass sets of nuclear genes (see Methods), the 5' extension (putative targeting peptide) of the Carex nuclear gene
is not evidently homologous to those of grasses, which are
well conserved among themselves (Figure 4). Possession
of different N-terminal extensions has generally been
regarded as good evidence for independency of transfer
(e.g., [20,31,37]).
Finally, using nine sets of primers designed to rps14 and
the first exon of sdh2, we failed to recover any PCR products from Carex and Joinvillea indicative of rps14 insertion
into the sdh2 intron under conditions in which all three
grasses examined (including the basal grass Anomochloa)
yielded an sdh2-rps14 product. This result is consistent
with the hypothesis that rps14 is in a different location in
the Carex and Joinvillea nuclear genomes than in the
grasses and is therefore the product of separate transfers.
An important positive control on these negative sdh2rps14 amplifications from Carex and Joinvillea is that the

Page 9 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:55

same sdh2 and rps14 primers did work for each plant in
gene-specific contexts. That is, the (3') rps14 primers did
recover the putatively nuclear Carex and Joinvillea rps14
genes when used in combination with 5' rps14 primers,
and the sdh1-exon 1 primers did work in concert with
primers to sdh2-exon 2. Unfortunately, however, we did
not sequence the sdh2 PCR products from Carex and Joinvillea to rule out the possibility, albeit remote, that they
contain a transferred rps14 gene that is, for reasons
unclear, refractory to sdh2-rps14-based PCR isolation
(note that the sdh2 intron is generally a few times larger
than rps14).
Although three of the above four lines of evidence are consistent with the Joinvillea and grass genes being the product of separate transfers (recall that evidence for Joinvillea
is lacking for the fourth line of evidence, concerning
homology of 5' extension sequences), there is one, ambiguous piece of evidence that, upon one possible interpretation, supports the genes being derived from the same
transfer event. This involves the ambiguously aligned 6
NT at positions 89–94 (Additional File 1). According to
the "best" alignment, as shown in the figure, mitochondrial rps14 genes of Joinvillea and grasses contain different
deletions in this region, each of 4 NT in length and overlapping by 3 NT. According to this alignment, therefore,
the Joinvillea and grass genes were pseudogenized independently of one another. Alternatively, by sliding either
5 NT gap by 1 NT, and therefore at the cost of postulating
an additional NT substitution in one lineage or the other,
one obtains an alignment in which the grasses and Joinvillea share a 5 NT deletion. This, then, would constitute evidence that their pseudogenes are the product of a
common pseudogenization event. If so, this would also
be consistent with the hypothesis that their nuclear genes
result from a common transfer event. Overall, then, the
case for separate transfer in Joinvillea is weaker than for
Carex (all this relative to grasses). On balance, however,
we believe the evidence – in particular based on highly
differential degrees of nuclear gene divergence (Figure 3)
and failure to isolate a grass-like sdh2-rps14 gene under
positively controlled circumstances – favors a separate
putative transfer in Joinvillea as well.

Discussion
Multiple transfers of rps14 to the nucleus in Poales
We have described three, most likely independent cases of
functional transfer of rps14 from the mitochondrion to
the nucleus during the evolution of the Poales. The transfer in the grass family Poaceae had already been described
for the three cereals of greatest agronomic import, Oryza
(rice), Zea (maize), and Triticum (wheat) [9,18,20]. Our
results indicate that this transfer most likely occurred in
the stem lineage leading to all extant grasses (Poaceae),
roughly 80 million years ago [38-40]. This conclusion fol-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/55

lows from three observations: 1) The previously unexamined basal lineages of grasses (represented by Anomochloa,
Streptochaeta, and Pharus) contain a pseudogene copy of
rps14 in the mitochondrial genome that shares two
frameshift mutations with all other grasses. 2) Anomochloa
contains the same chimeric, sdh2/rps14 nuclear gene structure as previously described in Oryza, Zea, and Triticum. 3)
Joinvillea, which is only one node removed from being the
sister group to Poaceae (we were unable to obtain material for the obscure sister group to Poaceae, the Ecdeiocoleaceae) appears to share with grasses neither the two
mitochondrial rps14 frameshifts (but see preceding paragraph) nor the nuclear sdh2/rps14 gene structure.
The second transfer, apparently (Additional File 1) shared
by all three, diverse members of the Cyperaceae examined, is also roughly 80 million years old [39], and possibly older if shared by Juncaceae and even more distantly
related Poales (although this possibility cannot be ruled
out by our data, there is also no evidence that the transfer
occurred prior to the Cyperaceae stem lineage). The third
putative transfer, which is the least well supported overall
and in terms of being independent (i.e., of the "grass"
transfer), is unique to the single examined species of Joinvillea (the sole genus in the Joinvilleaceae) and appears to
be rather recent as judged by the relatively undiverged
nature of the Joinvillea nuclear rps14 gene (Figure 3).
Indeed, based on nuclear divergence levels, this is the
most recent case of functional mitochondrial-to-nucleus
gene transfer yet described (e.g., compare to [30,31]). A
fourth case of rps14 functional transfer in Poales is likely
represented by Lachnocaulon. Southern blot hybridization
indicated that rps14 is probably missing from Lachnocaulon mtDNA [4], however, material of Lachnocaulon was not
available for this study.
Although the Cyperaceae was included in the Adams et al.
[4] survey for mitochondrial gene loss and potential
nuclear transfer, its rps14 transfer was not inferred because
the mitochondrion genome of Cyperaceae contains an
essentially full-length pseudogene of rps14 (Additional
File 1). The rps14 transfer in Joinvillea, which was not
included among the 280 angiosperms surveyed by Adams
et al. [4], would have been missed for the same reason.
These observations underscore the potential, as discussed
by Adams et al. [4], for undiagnosed pseudogenes to lead
to underestimates of mitochondrial gene "loss" and
potential transfer in such Southern blot surveys. As noted
in Background, rps14 pseudogenes have also been
described in four disparate eudicots [12-17]. Considering
all this, and that 27 phylogenetically separate losses of
mitochondrial rps14 were inferred by Adams et al. [4], it is
possible that this gene has actually been transferred to the
nucleus many more times than this among the 280
angiosperms examined in that study. On the other hand,

Page 10 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:55

as Adams et al. [4] point out, gene loss patterns can also
lead to overestimates of the number of gene transfer
events, i.e., when phylogenetically separate losses as
inferred from blots trace back to a single deeper loss of
mitochondrial gene function – and probably nuclear gene
transfer – with one or more taxa within the group in question having a largely intact pseudogene scored as present.
As noted in Background, two of the 27 losses of mitochondrial rps14 inferred by Adams et al. [4] have been
confirmed by complete genome sequencing [8,10], but a
third was misdiagnosed, as Nicotiana mtDNA actually
contains a pseudogene copy comprising most of rps14. An
additional Southern blot hybridization (K. L. Adams and
J. D. Palmer, unpublished) has revealed that rps14 is
indeed present in mtDNA of the same Nicotiana sample
examined by Adams et al. [4]. Further inspection of the
autoradiogram from which mitochondrial rps14 absence
was originally and erroneously inferred suggests that this
error was caused by poor Southern-blot transfer in the
region of the Nicotiana lane where the rps14 band should
have appeared. We emphasize, however, that the overall
accuracy of the Southern blot estimates by Adams et al. [4]
of mitochondrial gene/presence is very high as assessed by
comparison with the definitive results obtained by mitochondrial genome sequencing. Six of the 280 genomes
surveyed by Adams et al. [4] have now been sequenced
[8,10,11,14,23,33]. These genome sequences confirm all
197 mitochondrial protein gene presences inferred for
these six genomes by Adams et al. [4], as well as 41 of 43
gene absences. [Two genes that were detected by Adams et
al. [4] using Southern blots, although present in the mitochondrial genome sequences of Triticum and Beta, were
not annotated as such in the GenBank files and were also
left out in the publications reporting these genomes. The
Triticum case [33] involves a nearly intact rps14 pseudogene (also see [20]), while the Beta case [10] involves a
nearly intact sdh4 pseudogene.] The second erroneously
inferred gene absence was a misdiagnosis by Adams et al.
[4] of rps1 as absent from mtDNA of Nicotiana (and two
other members of the Solanaceae: Capsium and Petunia),
when in fact the Nicotiana mitochondrial genome
sequence shows rps1 to be present and intact [11]. This
reflects a data-entry error in Figure 2 of Adams et al. [4], as
our notebooks show that rps1 was correctly scored based
on Southern blots as present in all three Solanaceae mtDNAs.
Prolonged retention, transcription, and editing of rps14
pseudogenes
Fully 33 of the 39 diverse genera examined from the three
gene-transfer families (Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Joinvilleaceae) have retained essentially full-length rps14 pseudogenes in the mitochondrial genome, with the six
exceptions representing but a single case of relatively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/55

recent loss of mitochondrial rps14 in the grass subfamily
Panicoideae (Figure 2). In the case of the Poaceae and
Cyperaceae, which represent 32 of the 33 described pseudogenes, this retention is despite the antiquity of the functional transfers to the nucleus and the evident (Additional
File 1) pseudogenizations of mitochondrial rps14, the latter occurring roughly 80 million years ago in both families. Equally if not more remarkably, all 21 mitochondrial
rps14 pseudogenes examined (19 in this study, plus Oryza
[18] and Triticum [20]) are transcribed, and 15 of the 21
are subject to RNA editing (Table 1; Additional File 1).
Such long-term, nearly pervasive survival of transcribed
(and, usually, RNA-edited) pseudogenes is to our knowledge unparalleled. What could account for this, as well as
the presence of virtually intact mitochondrial rps14 pseudogenes in a number of eudicots [12-17], including longlived and pervasively retained pseudogenes in the
Solanaceae (H. C. Ong and J. D. Palmer, unpublished
data)? First, we could be wrong in calling these pseudogenes. Perhaps rps14 is subject to some form of programmed translational recoding (either frameshifting or
bypassing; [41]) to produce functional mRNA and protein
from these apparent pseudogenes. Although programmed
recoding is quite rare overall, it has been reported for a
number of genes and organisms [41], and should not be
entirely dismissed as a possibility here. Sequencing of
mitochondrial RPS14 proteins and investigation of potential ribosomal association of mitochondrial rps14 transcripts (mRNAs?) could be pursued to test this possibility,
unlikely as it may seem (that transferred, putatively functional copies of rps14 are present in the nucleus in all
examined plant lineages possessing mitochondrial rps14
pseudogenes certainly argues against the recoding
hypothesis, as does the apparent drift towards noisy,
likely unselected patterns of RNA editing; see below).
Second, the low rate of loss and decay of mitochondrial
rps14 pseudogenes may, at least in part, simply reflect generally low mutation rates in plant mitochondrial
genomes. It is well known that, with rare exception
[42,43], synonymous substitution rates are extremely low
in plant mitochondrial genomes [28-30]. Comparable
data on neutral rates of both short indels (e.g., those leading to the short frameshift mutations highlighted in Additional File 1) and long indels (those leading to gene loss)
are lacking for plant mtDNAs. However, if the positive
correlation observed in other genomes (e.g,. [44])
between rates of substitutions and rates of indels holds
true for plant mitochondrial genomes, then this may
explain part of the rps14 pseudogene paradox. Indeed, the
alignments shown in Additional File 1 (also see Figure 2)
suggest that rates of both substitutions and short indels
are elevated in the Cyperaceae. However, whether large
deletions leading to gene loss are also elevated in Cyper-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:55

aceae (and in general correlate with rates of substitutions
and small indels) remains to be seen. A very different picture is seen for the only other gene transfer case (involving
cox2 in legumes; [45]) for which extensive sampling of
mitochondrial gene/presence and gene sequence has been
carried out within the transfer clade. There, a largely all-ornothing pattern is seen; among 21 legume genera belonging to the gene transfer clade, only a single mitochondrial
pseudogene was found, compared to three independent
cases of cox2 gene loss and several lineages in which an
intact and probably functional mitochondrial cox2 gene
was found [45].
Third, independent of its protein-coding function, there
may be other functional elements within or in close proximity to rps14 that make it difficult or impossible to delete
(much more so than cox2) even when it is a pseudogene.
Most angiosperm mitochondrial genes (including cox2)
occur as a single genic island in a large sea of intergenic
spacer DNA [8,10,11,14,23,33]. However, rps14 is exceptional in that it is cotranscribed with [13,15,18,22,24] and
separated by only a single NT from rpl5 in virtually all
angiosperms (see references in Background; our unpublished results; the only known exceptions are Oenothera
and Vicia [21,25]). By being so short (barely 300 NT) and
so tightly linked to rpl5, rps14 may be relatively buffered
compared to most plant mitochondrial genes against
large deletions that would lead to gene loss. Another possibility is that sequences within rps14 or immediately
downstream of it (e.g., a transcription terminator) are
under selection to maintain proper expression of rpl5.
While these arguments may hold water for Cyperaceae, for
which rpl5 is intact and immediately upstream of rps14
(our unpublished data), they are problematic for grasses.
This is because rpl5 has been functionally transferred to
the nucleus in most grasses ([20]; our unpublished data),
and despite its multiple, within-grass transfers being more
recent than the grass-wide rps14 transfer and pseudogenization, there have been fully five independent losses of
mitochondrial rpl5 among the same 35 grasses examined
in this study (our unpublished data), while some (but not
all) other grasses contain rpl5 pseudogenes in the mitochondrion. The pervasive and prolonged (ca. 80 million
year) retention of mitochondrial rps14 pseudogenes in
grasses and Cyperaceae also contrasts with the numerous
(26, discounting the Nicotiana error) phylogenetically
separate losses of mitochondrial rps14 across the broad
sweep of angiosperm phylogeny [4].
Overall, then we are left with a suspicion that rps14 may
be unusually recalcitrant – even as a pseudogene – to
elimination from mitochondrial genomes of Poaceae and
Cyperaceae. The possibility that some portion of the rps14
sequence may play some entirely unrelated role that
renders the pseudogene's deletion problematic must be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/55

considered, as must the possibility that it's not actually a
pseudogene thanks to some form of programmed translational recoding. On the other hand, rps14 and rpl5 may
simply lie near different ends of the expected frequency
distribution of pseudogene deletion in such slowly evolving genomes as those of plant mitochondria (note also
that despite the five rpl5 losses, many other grasses retain
virtually intact rpl5 pseudogenes; our unpublished data).
The continued, presumably meaningless transcription of
mitochondrial rps14 (and rpl5 too; unpublished data) in
many grasses in which both mitochondrial genes are,
apparently, defunct, is not unexpected given that plant
mitochondrial promoters are very short [46,47] and that
rates of nucleotide substitutions and short indels are very
low. These pseudo-transcripts continue to be edited at low
levels comparable to those of intact and putatively functional mitochondrial rps14 genes (Table 1). However, two
observations suggest that this represents noisy/leaky editing that is not under selection. First, fully half of the edits
are U→C edits, which are extremely rare in angiosperm
mitochondrial genes (reviewed in [48]). Indeed, all of the
357–491 edits detected in the four angiosperms in which
comprehensive analyses of RNA editing have been carried
out are C→U edits ([19,23,49]; Mower and Palmer, submitted). Second, many of the rps14 pseudogene edits (of
both types) reduce the conservation of RPS14 proteins
(see Additional File 2), whereas 94% of nonsynonymous
edits increase protein conservation across species [50-53].
Note that transcribed and edited pseudogenes have also
been described for several other mitochondrial genes in a
diversity of angiosperms ([12,13,15,54,55]; Mower and
Palmer, submitted).
The peculiar evolutionary dynamics of plant mitochondrial genes and their expression leads to a conundrum
with respect to using gene sequence and expression data
to predict whether a given gene is likely to be functional
or not. Because transcribed and RNA-edited pseudogenes
are relatively common in plant mtDNA, and because rates
of gene decay/pseudogenization are relatively low (Additional File 1), one can predict that an appreciable fraction
of intact genes that are transcribed and RNA-edited are
nonetheless not functional. Because many plant mitochondrial pseudogenes show evidence of relaxed constraints on editing ([15,20,53,56]; Mower and Palmer,
submitted), this may be a second important source of
clues (in addition to typical pseudogenization mutations
in the gene itself) that a gene is non-functional. Indeed,
the loss of editing at evolutionarily conserved positions
has led to the suggestion that the intact rps14 gene of
Brassica [23] and rps1 gene of Oenothera [57] are in fact
cryptic pseudogenes. This issue is particularly relevant to
those two classes of plant mitochondrial protein genes
(their 14 ribosomal protein genes and two succinate dehy-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:55

drogenase genes) that are very frequently lost from the
mitochondrial genome and functionally transferred to the
nucleus during angiosperm evolution [4]. Many of the
intact mitochondrial copies of these genes may turn out,
upon further (especially cDNA) analysis, to instead be
cryptic pseudogenes.
Indels in rps14 pseudogenes
Three aspects of the pattern and apparent frequency of
indels in the mitochondrial rps14 pseudogenes deserve
comment. The first was noted above, that the Cyperaceae
pseudogenes have on average sustained more indels
(mostly frameshifts) than the equal-aged Poaceae pseudogenes, and that this may reflect mechanistically-related,
correlated increases in rates of nucleotide substitutions
and small indels in the Cyperaceae (Additional File 1).
Second, there may be an elevated rate of indels in the ~20
million year lineage leading to Eragrostis. This lineage has
accumulated four frameshifts, compared to no indels in
about half of the grass pseudogenes (excluding the two
deletions that occurred in the common ancestor of all
grasses) and only a single indel in most other grasses
(Additional File 1). Unlike Cyperaceae, Eragrostis does not
show an elevated substitution rate, and if this pattern
holds with much more data (and it may well not; Eragrostis could simply be a stochastic outlier), then this could be
an apparently rare case of uncoupled rates of nucleotide
substitutions and short indels.

Finally, there are two sets of apparently homoplasiously
derived indels (Additional File 1). None of these involve
short direct repeats, where replication slippage can readily
produce such patterns of homoplasy. Instead, because the
same pattern extends across about 10 markers in the adjacent rpl5 gene, we believe that the second set (positions
286–289) of indel homoplasies is the result of horizontal
gene transfer from Festuca to Secale and Danthonia. Horizontal transfer could also explain the second set of homoplasies (positions 198–202), but there is far less evidence
for transfer in this case (this homoplasious deletion being
the only evidence), and parallel deletion is a good alternative explanation. These and many additional cases of
more or less well supported horizontal transfer of the rpl5/
rps14 locus will be the subject of a forthcoming paper
(H.C. Ong, D.W. Rice, S.M. Chang, and J.D. Palmer, in
preparation).

Conclusion
Our findings show that the mitochondrial rps14 gene has,
most likely, been functionally transferred to the nucleus at
least three times during the evolution of the Poales. We
extend the one previously recognized transfer from a limited number of grasses to the full breadth of grasses and
date its occurrence to roughly 80 million years ago. We
describe two new cases of rps14 transfer: a comparably old

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/55

transfer in the Cyperaceae and a much younger, putative
transfer in the Joinvilleaceae. Surprisingly, despite the
great age of the Poaceae and Cyperaceae transfers (and of
the apparent loss of functionality of the original mitochondrial rps14 genes), nearly intact and expressed pseudogenes of rps14 have persisted in the mitochondrial
genomes of most lineages of the two families. To our
knowledge, such long-term, nearly pervasive survival of
expressed pseudogenes is unparalleled in any other gene
or genome. Why this is so is not entirely clear. It probably
reflects a combination of factors, including the simple
nature of plant mitochondrial expression sequences and
the short length of rps14 (making them small targets for
disabling mutations), low rates of nucleotide substitutions and indels in plant mtDNAs, and (especially in
Cyperaceae) the presence of an intact, functional rpl5 gene
immediately upstream of rps14. Such survival also raises
the possibility that, at least in the Poales, rps14 may harbour some functionally important sequence element that
is unrelated to its ribosomal-protein-encoding function.
Overall, these findings indicate that intracellular gene
transfer may occur even more frequently in angiosperms
than already recognized and that pseudogenes in plant
mitochondrial genomes can be surprisingly resistant to
forces that lead to gene loss and inactivation.

Methods
Slot and Southern blot hybridization
Slot blot filters were made by denaturing 300 ng of total
plant DNA with 0.4 M NaOH and loading the DNA onto
a nylon membrane (Millipore) clamped in a Minifold II
slot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Southern blot filters
were made by digesting total DNAs with restriction
enzymes for 2 hours, separating fragments on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferring fragments from gels to nylon
membranes using the method of Dowling et al. [58].
Probes made with 75 ng of 32P-labeled gene-specific PCR
products were hybridized to membranes at 60°C overnight in 5 × SSC, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 10 mM
EDTA, 2 × Denhardt's solution and 5% dextran sulfate
(Amersham Pharmacia). Membranes were washed twice
with 2 × SSC at room temperature and twice at 60°C with
2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS.
Gene isolation and characterization
Genomic DNAs were obtained from other labs or isolated
from leaves using the method of Doyle and Doyle [59].
PCR amplification of rps14, from either genomic or cDNA
templates,
was
conducted
using
primers
rps14F1(ATGWYGGAGAAGCRAAATAKA),
rpl5F1
(ATGYTTCCRCTCHATWTTCAT), rps14R1(TACCAAGACGATTTCTTTATG),
rps14R2
(GGACTAGCTGCAGAGCTAACC),
nuS14F6B
(CRCAAACGTAGAHTKCTYGC), nuS14F7 (GCKKGAYCRCAAACGTAGA), and nuS14R3 (CTACCAHGAYGCYT-

TCTTWAC). To amplify the nuclear sdh2-rps14 locus,
primer sdh2F (CTCCACATCCTGCCCGTCCT) was used
together with the reverse rps14 nuclear primer. To isolate
the Carex sequence upstream of rps14, we used the Vectorette II kit (Sigma-Genosys) with primers CarINT
(GCTAGCGTACGGAAAACAATA) and nuS14R3; genomic
Carex DNA was digested with BamH I and ligated to the
BamH I Vectorette end. All 5 Vectorette ends (4 sticky and
1 blunt) were used in our attempt to isolate Jonvillea's 5'
extension but all attempts failed. Also unsuccessful were
efforts to obtain farther upstream sequences for Carex by
5' RACE, as were 5' RACE efforts for Joinvillea. Thermocycling parameters were 35 cycles of 94°C, 3 minutes; 54°C,
30 seconds; and 72°C, 40 seconds. PCR products were
purified using ExoSAP-IT (United States Biochemical) and
sequenced directly using an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) at the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute.
Sequence alignment used Se-Al v2.0 a11 (Oxford, UK).
For RT-PCR, RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated twice with DNase I
(TaKaRa). A total of 1 µg RNA was reverse transcribed
using Moloney-murine-leukaemia-virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) with random hexamers
(Invitrogen). The cDNAs were then PCR-amplified,
cloned with TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), and
sequenced. The following controls were conducted to
ensure that the persumptive cDNA products were indeed
produced from RNA templates: 1) Total RNAs were
treated twice with DNaseI and re-precipitated after each
treatment, and 2) PCR amplification alone (using random
primers and without prior reverse transcription) was conducted with each of the DNAse-treated RNAs as template
and yielded no amplified products. Therefore these
appear to be bona fide cDNAs rather than PCR products
from genomic DNA contamination of the RNA preparations. Note that all plants for which cDNA sequences were
obtained were also sequenced for the corresponding
genomic sequence, i.e., the inferred RNA edits are real and
not the result of natural polymorphisms stemming from
use of different plants for generation of cDNA and
genomic sequences. Finally, all edits were inferred from
clean sequence reads, generated from both strands of a
clone, and most were also validated by obtaining the same
sequence from multiple independent cDNA clones (Table
1).
All sequences generated in this study have been submitted
under accession numbers [Genbank:DQ380465–
DQ380508]. Sequences we did not generate but used are:

Phylogenetic analyses
Maximum likelihood analyses were performed using
PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford) [60]. Trees were constructed
using the HKY85 substitution model, estimated transition
to transversion ratio, approximated gamma distribution
and four rate categories. All trees were swapped by random stepwise addition with TBR branch swapping. Bootstrap values were obtained from 100 replicates using the
same HKY85 substitution model.

RPS14 amino acid sequence changes as a result of RNA editing. The table
shows the specifics of RNA editing for 15 of the 21 taxa shown in Table
1. cDNA sequences for the other six taxa (Luzula, Oryza, Glyceria, Poa,
Bromus, Phragmites; the Oryza cDNA is from Kubo et al. [18] and the
Triticum cDNA is from Sandoval et al. [20]) are not shown because they
are not RNA-edited. cDNA translations disregard indels, i.e., they assume
an intact open reading frame.
