Abstract
Background: The genomic information of a species allows for the genome-scale reconstruction
of its metabolic capacity. Such a metabolic reconstruction gives support to metabolic engineering,
but also to integrative bioinformatics and visualization. Sequence-based automatic reconstructions
require extensive manual curation, which can be very time-consuming. Therefore, we present a
method to accelerate the time-consuming process of network reconstruction for a query species.
The method exploits the availability of well-curated metabolic networks and uses high-resolution
predictions of gene equivalency between species, allowing the transfer of gene-reaction
associations from curated networks.
Results: We have evaluated the method using Lactococcus lactis IL1403, for which a genome-scale
metabolic network was published recently. We recovered most of the gene-reaction associations
(i.e. 74 – 85%) which are incorporated in the published network. Moreover, we predicted over 200
additional genes to be associated to reactions, including genes with unknown function, genes for
transporters and genes with specific metabolic reactions, which are good candidates for an
extension to the previously published network. In a comparison of our developed method with the
well-established approach Pathologic, we predicted 186 additional genes to be associated to
reactions. We also predicted a relatively high number of complete conserved protein complexes,
which are derived from curated metabolic networks, illustrating the potential predictive power of
our method for protein complexes.
Conclusion: We show that our methodology can be applied to accelerate the reconstruction of
genome-scale metabolic networks by taking optimal advantage of existing, manually curated
networks. As orthology detection is the first step in the method, only the translated open reading
frames (ORFs) of a newly sequenced genome are necessary to reconstruct a metabolic network.
When more manually curated metabolic networks will become available in the near future, the
usefulness of our method in network prediction is likely to increase.

Background
In recent years, genome sequencing projects have enormously increased our molecular understanding of biological capabilities of organisms. For many research areas,
such as biotechnology and biomedical research, the metabolic capacities of cells are highly relevant. On the basis
of the functional annotation of predicted genes, genomescale metabolic networks can be reconstructed [1-3]. An
increasing collection of methods is available to analyze
the properties of these networks, both from a graph-theoretical point of view [4-7] as well as from a metabolic engineering point of view (for reviews [8] and [9]). Genomescale metabolic networks are also increasingly being used
in integrative bioinformatics [10,11]. As a metabolic network consists of associations between genes and metabolic reactions, it can be used to study the cellular
properties of the organism by integrating functional
genomics data, such as gene expression and proteomics
(the goal of systems biology). The importance of integration has recently been shown in various studies on the
topology, dynamics and evolution of metabolic networks
[12-14].
Unfortunately, the reconstruction process can be very
time-consuming. To a certain extent the effort depends on
the level of detail that is required for the purpose of the
reconstruction. A metabolic network can be used as an
encyclopedia in order to present enzymes in their metabolic context [2]. In this particular case it is not essential
to include the exact reaction stoichiometry to analyze
functional genomics data (e.g. gene regulation). Extensively curated metabolic encyclopedias can be found in
the so-called BioCyc collection, including EcoCyc and the
recently developed LacplantCyc [15-17]. On the other
hand, the reaction stoichiometry is important for most
quantitative modeling purposes, such as flux balance
analysis (FBA), in which constraints are defined by the
stoichiometry and are used to optimize for a certain flux
(e.g. biomass production; for review [8]). In the past few
years, several of such metabolic networks for modeling
purposes have been constructed [1,18-22].
The metabolic network reconstruction procedure usually
starts with functional annotation of genes encoded on the
genome of a certain species of interest (reviewed by [2]).
Functional annotation is mainly done by homology
searches against protein/enzyme databases [23-25]. Several computational methods, such as Pathologic (part of
Pathway Tools), have been developed to automate the
reconstruction procedure by linking reactions and pathways to the annotated genes (also referred to as gene-reaction associations) [26,27]. As a consequence, the quality
of such an automatically generated metabolic network
will highly depend on the quality of the annotation.
Recently, methods have also been developed to automate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/296

the functional annotation and network reconstruction for
unannotated genomes [28,29]. In spite of the promising
work on developing computational methods to automate
the reconstruction of (genome-scale) metabolic networks,
in all cases manual curation is still needed, which is the
most time-consuming part [1,2].
Incomplete EC-codes and annotation errors in protein
databases are likely to be the main cause of errors that
arise from homology based computational methods
[2,30]. It is, therefore, important to correct these errors by
manual investigation of the predictions. Pathologic, for
example, is specifically designed to predict as much metabolic information as possible for a given species, with the
idea to curate the predictions afterwards [27]. In order to
validate the predictions by computational methods, existing manually curated metabolic networks can be used.
The main advantage of these curated metabolic networks
is that errors caused by misannotation in protein databases and thereby incorrect or incomplete labeling of metabolic function, have been corrected. Moreover, specific
gene function annotations (e.g. transport system components and annotations made by pathway analysis [10]),
specific reactions (e.g. not present in KEGG) and potentially protein complex definitions are other promising features of manually curated networks which can be used as
a source to predict and/or to validate metabolic networks.
Here, we describe a semi-automatic approach to accelerate
the process of genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction by taking full advantage of already manually
curated networks. The developed method, referred to as
the AUTOGRAPH-method (AUtomatic Transfer by
Orthology of Gene Reaction Associations for Pathway
Heuristics), is applied to the annotated genome of Lactococcus lactis IL1403. To evaluate the AUTOGRAPHmethod, we compared predicted gene-reaction associations with a manually curated and published metabolic
network of L. lactis IL1403, which we will refer to as the
Oliveira network [31]. The AUTOGRAPH-method recovered most of the gene-reaction associations (74 – 85%)
and we predicted many additional gene-reaction associations. The results illustrate the predictive power of the
AUTOGRAPH-method, which may also be applied to
unannotated genomes.

Results
We applied the AUTOGRAPH-method (see Figure 1 and
methods for details) to the genome of Lactococcus lactis
IL1403 [32] using three manually curated metabolic networks as input, i.e. a network from Escherichia coli K12
[22], Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 [manuscript in preparation, see also [17]] and Bacillus subtilis [33]. In total, we
predicted 525 genes of L. lactis to be associated to 416 different reactions (additional file 1). To validate these

results we compared the predicted metabolic network
with the Oliveira network [31] by examining gene-reaction associations in both networks.
AUTOGRAPH versus Oliveira network
We could recover 349 genes from the Oliveira network
(see methods), involving 464 gene-reaction associations.
Gene-reaction associations are one-to-one relationships
between genes and metabolic reactions. One single gene
can be involved in multiple gene-reaction associations, as
certain gene products (i.e. enzymes) are able to catalyze
multiple reactions (see Figure 2 for an example). We
found that 342 (i.e. 74%) of the Oliveira gene-reaction
associations were also predicted by the AUTOGRAPHmethod (referred to as confirmed associations in the
remaining of the text). 122 were not predicted by AUTOGRAPH. Therefore, we investigated and categorized these
associations into three groups: (I) L. lactis genes that are
organism-specific compared to E. coli, B. subtilis and L.
plantarum (in 19% of the 122 cases). As a consequence, it
is not possible to predict orthologs and metabolic reactions. (II) Predicted orthologs were lacking reaction associations in the input networks of E. coli, B. subtilis and L.
plantarum (in 29% of the 122 cases). Absence of metabolic
reactions within the input networks is related to specific
choices made by curators during modeling studies. A lack
of detailed experimental evidence is one reason to exclude

are associated to the gene yeaB in the Oliveira network. One

from the predicted network, because the metabolic reaction

reactions. For example, the aspartate aminotransferase of
L. lactis (gene name: aspC) is orthologous to yfbQ of E.
coli, but yfbQ has not been incorporated within the E. coli
metabolic network due to a lack of experimental evidence
(according to the Ecocyc database [16]; note that there is
an aspartate aminotransferase in L. lactis, gene name:
aspB, which has been predicted by AUTOGRAPH). (III)
Additional reactions were associated to genes in the
Oliveira network compared to the equivalent genes in the
input networks (in 52% of the 122 cases, see Figure 2). For
example, the L. lactis aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (gene name: araT) is an enzyme with broad substrate specificity, which has been experimentally verified
[31]. In total, the enzyme is able to catalyze 18 different
reactions of which two have been included within the L.
plantarum source metabolic network (i.e. difference of 16
gene-reaction associations).
Besides the 342 confirmed gene-reaction associations, we
also predicted 164 additional associations with AUTOGRAPH for the genes that were already present in the
Oliveira network. By manually investigation of the additional gene-reaction associations we found that the majority involved metabolic reactions that are highly similar to
the reactions within confirmed associations: differences
were found on the level of cofactor assignment or a different substrate (see Figure 3 for examples). Nevertheless, the
additional reactions with different cofactors are still rele-

of the additional associations involved metabolic reactions that were already present in the Oliveira network,
indicating that also a single metabolic reaction can be
associated to multiple genes (Figure 3B). Such associations are especially of interest in integrative functional
genomics studies (i.e. gene-expression).
By examination of the orthologs and their associated metabolic reactions, we observed that all three metabolic networks contributed to the total number of predicted genereaction associations (i.e. confirmed and additional, Figure 4). To certain extent the three networks overlap in
terms of gene-reaction associations, but we also derived
22% of the confirmed associations from single networks
(Figure 4A). This indicates that by increasing the number
of metabolic networks for the AUTOGRAPH-method we
could positively affect the number of (correct) predicted
gene-reaction associations (at least for L. lactis). On the
other hand, an increase in the number of input metabolic
networks also increases the number of additional genereaction associations (Figure 4B), causing an increasing
need for manual curation (i.e. a decision to incorporate an
association).

vant within network reconstruction, as curators have
investigated these in their metabolic modeling studies.
An explanation for the prediction of many additional
gene-reaction associations is that we explicitly included
recent gene-duplicates in the analysis (see methods).
Recent gene-duplicates are likely to catalyze very similar
metabolic reactions (i.e. molecular function)[34]. As a
consequence, in some cases the reaction associations of
two (or more) genes are transferred to a single L. lactis
gene. It is very well possible that the L. lactis genes are able
to catalyze the different reactions, but the availability of
substrates or cofactors will determine whether or not
these reactions will occur. Moreover, we found that 31%

Additional predictions for genes not present in Oliveira
network
In the comparison between the predicted metabolic network and the Oliveira network, we also found many genereaction associations involving genes that were not
present in the Oliveira network (see additional file 1). In
order to explore the value of these additional predictions,
we manually investigated the genes that were associated
to reactions. In total, 203 additional genes were found to
be associated to 263 different reactions. We categorized
the genes into three groups: (I) transport: all genes associated to transport reactions, (II) specific: incorporation of
these genes and their associated reactions would potentially lead to additional biochemistry and hence possibly
different model predictions and (III) choice: these genes
and associated reactions would lead to a higher resolution
of the network, i.e. would specify reactions that are
lumped into an overall reaction in the Oliveira network.
The majority of genes (i.e. 99) were classified into the
group of specific. For example, 15 genes were predicted to
be associated to vitamin biosynthesis reactions. We analyzed whether the associated metabolic reactions were
already present in the Oliveira network or whether the
reactions were new and could therefore add new metabolic capabilities to the network. Overall we found 60
new metabolic reactions associated to the 99 investigated
genes (see additional file 1). These reactions included
potentially important metabolic routes, such as glycogen
metabolism and the phosphoketolase reaction. The latter
enzyme is involved in pentose catabolism in many lactic
acid bacteria (see also additional file 1 for examples of

gorized into the group of choice. The group of choice
included the genes that will contribute to a higher level of
detail to metabolic pathways which already existed (but
were lumped) in the Oliveira network. For example, the
group of choice included all amino acid tRNA-ligases
which were not included in the Oliveira network because
protein synthesis was considered as a lumped reaction
starting with the individual amino acids as precursors,
and protein as product [31]. The genes and the associated
metabolic reactions in this group would not alter model
predictions, but they are useful extension to the model
when it is used for functional genomics data integration
and analysis. Thus, the incorporation of this group of
genes is a matter of choice and depends on the specification and final purpose of the metabolic network.

AUTOGRAPH versus Pathologic
As various automatic approaches exist to predict genereaction associations for a metabolic network, we also
compared the AUTOGRAPH-method to one well established approach called Pathologic, which is part of the
Pathway Tools software [27]. The Pathologic algorithm
takes annotated genomes as input and predicts gene-reaction associations based on name-matching and EC-codes.
The EC-code approach to link metabolic information to
genes is similar to other methods, such as IdentiCS and
metaSHARK [28,29]. Pathologic is the first step in the
construction of a so-called PGDB (pathway-genome database) which consists of gene-reaction associations. Several
organism-specific PGDBs have been constructed and
manually curated [16,17,36,37]. In order to perform a
reliable comparison between the AUTOGRAPH-method
and Pathologic, we specifically selected two manually
curated PGDBs, i.e. EcoCyc [16]and LacplantCyc [17] as a
source to predict gene-reaction associations by orthology
for L. lactis IL1403. We predicted a total of 580 L. lactis
genes to be associated to one or multiple reactions. Of
these, 394 showed an overlap with the L. lactis metabolic
network predicted automatically by Pathologic (i.e. 394
genes were present in both predicted networks, the majority of which showed consistency in associated metabolic
reactions). Therefore, 186 additional genes were exclusively predicted by AUTOGRAPH to be associated to one
or multiple reactions. In contrast, only 35 metabolic genes
were exclusively predicted by Pathologic.

The 186 additional predicted genes included specific metabolic genes as well as a relatively high fraction (i.e. 43%)
of transport system components. Absence of transporters
was to be expected because transporters do not have an
EC-code and are therefore not considered by the Pathologic algorithm: transport reactions need to be added
manually to the automatically predicted PGDBs. The
results demonstrate the strength of the AUTOGRAPHmethod being complementary to Pathologic. Both meth-

ods can thus be combined to predict organism-specific
metabolic networks.
Metabolic network reconstruction and protein complexes
In this study we mainly focused on the automatic prediction of gene-reaction associations for a metabolic network
of L. lactis. Another factor which is of importance in metabolic network reconstruction, especially in relation to
functional genomics data analysis (i.e. proteomics or
gene-expression data), is the incorporation of protein
complexes. Therefore, we explored the possibilities to predict protein complexes based on the available curated
genome-scale metabolic networks which include both
protein complexes and detailed metabolic reactions.
Methods have been developed to predict biochemical networks on the level of protein interactions (i.e. possible
protein complexes), but these lack the detailed metabolic
reaction networks [1,38]. However, the relationship
between genes, proteins and their metabolic functions can
be many-to-many, making the predictions very difficult.
We confined our analysis to testing whether or not all
components of protein complexes defined in the metabolic networks of E. coli, L. plantarum and B. subtilis, were
also encoded on the genome of L. lactis (note that protein
complex definitions are based on genomic context or
experimentally derived protein-protein interaction data).
We excluded those protein complexes from the analysis
that involved isoenzymes, as the possibilities for complex
definition in such cases can be rather large and are often
ambiguous. The analysis revealed that a relatively high
fraction of protein complexes defined for L. plantarum
were completely conserved in L. lactis (Figure 5), and are
therefore reliable candidates to be automatically incorporated in the L. lactis metabolic network (notice that we
were not able to validate the predictions, due to a lack of
protein complex information in the Oliveira network).

Predicted complete protein complexes for L. lactis and P. aeruginosa, based on a pairwise comparison with protein complexes found in metabolic networks of L. plantarum, B. subtilis
and E. coli. A higher fraction of protein complexes is completely conserved between L. plantarum, B. subtilis and L. lactis,
compared to E. coli and L. lactis. As L. plantarum, B. subtilis and
L. lactis are all gram-positives and E. coli is a proteobacterium,
the phylogenetic relationship between species appears of
influence in number of completely conserved protein complexes. This is further supported by applying the AUTOGRAPH-method to the annotated genome of P. aeruginosa,
which shows that the fraction of (predicted) complete protein complexes is relatively higher between P. aeruginosa and
E. coli (i.e. both are proteobacteria), compared to P. aeruginosa and the gram-positive bacteria (L. plantarum and B. subtilis).

Discussion
To study a possible relationship between the number of
predicted (complete) protein complexes and the phylogenetic relationship between considered species, we predicted protein complexes for the annotated genome of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (Figure 5). In this case, we
specifically took P. aeruginosa because it is, together with
E. coli, taxonomically classified as a proteobacterium. As
expected, we observed a higher number of conserved
(complete) protein complexes between P. aeruginosa and
E. coli, compared to P. aeruginosa and the gram-positive
bacteria (L. plantarum and B. subtilis). On the other hand,
we observed a higher number of conserved protein complexes between the gram-positive bacteria (L. plantarum
and B. subtilis) and L. lactis, in contrast to L. lactis and the
more distantly related E. coli. These observations suggest a
correlation between the number of complete (conserved)
protein complexes and the phylogenetic relationship
between two species.

We have developed a procedure which exploits the availability of well-curated metabolic networks to predict genereaction associations. As we believe that high-quality metabolic reconstructions always need careful manual curation [1,2], the objective of this study was not to develop a
method for fully automated reconstructions, but to
develop a method that optimally benefits from existing,
well-curated reconstructions. We explicitly focused on
developing a method to accelerate decision steps for the
incorporation of gene-reaction associations in a metabolic network. This can be achieved by presenting for each
query gene its orthologs from manually curated metabolic
networks (additional file 1). The main advantage of transferring information from curated networks is the fact that
unannotated genomes can be used as input and thereby
avoiding misannotation caused by errors in protein databases or incomplete labeling (e.g. incomplete EC-codes).
Moreover, specific annotations within the metabolic con-

text can be transferred from these networks allowing the
interpretation of organism-specific choices such as reaction stoichiometry and cofactors (e.g. NAD or NADP).
Our method is based on evolutionary concepts (orthology
definitions) for gene function prediction. Rather than
using bidirectional best hits alone, we used Inparanoid for
the orthology definition [39]. Inparanoid has a relatively
high resolution and is able to predict recent gene duplicates (i.e. inparalogs): these are genes from a single species
that are all orthologous to one or multiple genes in
another species [40]. Inparalogs are likely to have retained
the same or very similar molecular function, and are probably functionally differentiated on the biological process
level [34]. The orthology definition therefore allows the
transfer of metabolic reactions (molecular function) also
in the case of gene duplicates.
In our study we derived gene-reaction associations from
metabolic networks of E. coli, L. plantarum and B. subtilis,
by predicting orthologs between these three species and L.
lactis. We have shown that the number of confirmed (predicted) gene-reaction associations for L. lactis, for the
genes that are present in the published Oliveira network,
was relatively high (i.e. 74%). The coverage of 74% is calculated with the highest stringency, as we distinguished
reactions with different cofactor usage and different (but
similar) substrates. Exact cofactor definitions, however,
are frequently ignored in studies on the topology of metabolic networks (e.g. functional genomics data analysis)
[12]. When ignoring cofactor usage, i.e. considering the
reactions that differ only in cofactors as identical, the coverage of our method is much higher (i.e. ~85%). Nevertheless, cofactor utilization is still important in modeling
approaches such as constraint-based modeling [1,8,9].
We predicted many additional gene-reaction associations
for the genes that were already present in the Oliveira network. As one might consider the additional predictions as
over-predictions, we investigated the additional genereaction associations in more detail. We found that the
majority of the additional associated reactions were
mainly (small) variations to the reactions in the Oliveira
network (Figure 3). In many cases the reactions slightly
differed in terms of substrates and cofactors (e.g. reactions
that take place with either ATP or GTP). Therefore, the
additional predictions should not directly be considered
as an over-prediction, as the level of metabolic detail in a
network (e.g. including or excluding cofactors, see above)
also depends on the exact purpose.
Importantly, we also predicted 203 genes that were absent
from the Oliveira network, of which 34 were annotated as
hypothetical. A major fraction of these additional genereaction associations involved specific metabolic reac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/296

tions, which could be useful additions to the metabolic
network. Even though the actual choice whether or not
these specific gene-reaction associations should be
included, might depends on the exact goal of the (modeling) study, new associations are useful information for
further improvement of the model. Especially in the context of integrative bioinformatics, any new gene-reaction
association allows that specific gene to be studied in its
metabolic context, and in that respect the new associations found with the AUTOGRAPH-method should be
very useful.
Besides the specific gene-reaction associations we also
found many transport system components that are absent
from the Oliveira network. Although transporters could
also be considered as specific reactions, we have classified
them into a separate group, because their substrate specificity is in general difficult to predict based on sequence
data alone ([34], C. Francke, unpublished results). Contextual information, such as genome context, can be used
in respect to the prediction of gene-reaction associations
for transport system components. If this has been done in
curated metabolic networks, transfer of function by highresolution (co-)orthology becomes possible (C. Francke,
unpublished results). Although transporters may not in
all cases be essential in modeling studies, e.g. when
growth on specific substrates is studied, they are important for a complete picture of the metabolic capacity of a
species.
In the comparison between AUTOGRAPH and Pathologic, we found a relatively large overlap in terms of genes
associated to reactions, but we also established many
additional genes, including many transporters. Both
methods can be combined to predict gene-reaction associations with high coverage, as both predicted a unique set
of additional metabolic genes (186 by AUTOGRAPH and
35 by Pathologic). Besides the prediction of gene-reaction
associations, Pathologic also associates genes to pathways
using the pathway information from MetaCyc (the collection of metabolic reactions and pathways occurring in all
included species) [41]. This is one of the major advantages
of the approach [27], but it also causes much redundancy,
as many variations exist in single pathways (e.g. citric acid
cycle in different species). Over-predictions of this type
have been removed in many curated organism-specific
PGDBs which were initially constructed by Pathologic
(see ref [17] for an example). Therefore, when using the
AUTOGRAPH approach, redundancy in pathway association can be controlled by the number of curated PGDBs
used as input. Increasing the number of input databases
(or models) will increase coverage, but also increase the
number of possible over-predictions (Figure 4).

When we studied the possibility to predict protein complexes, we found that the number of automatically predicted (complete) protein complexes depends on the
phylogenetic relationship between species, although it
should be noted that we may not have sufficient species to
establish a strong correlation (Figure 5). We also observed
complexes for which not all constituent proteins were
found on the genome of L. lactis. The reason for the prediction of these incomplete protein complexes is likely to
be the result of (physiological) variations in complexes for
the different species (i.e. organism-specific complexes) or
a lack in orthology detection. The incomplete protein
complexes therefore need to be manually curated to investigate if 'missing' components are absent due to a lack in
orthology detection or that components are absent due to
physiological differences between the species. Also, specific choices from curators can lead to differences in complex definition, which consequently could influence
complex prediction. The presented AUTOGRAPHmethod is a possible first step to automate the prediction
of protein complexes integrated with a detailed metabolic
reaction network.

Conclusion
We have described a method to accelerate genome-scale
metabolic network reconstruction by using orthology and
existing manually curated metabolic networks to predict
gene-reaction associations. In this study we focused on the
prediction of a metabolic network for L. lactis IL1403. We
recovered most of the gene-reaction associations (i.e. 74 –
85%) that were present in a published metabolic network
of L. lactis IL1403 (Oliveira network). Moreover, we identified over 200 additional genes associated to reactions
that are potentially relevant for either metabolic modeling
or integrative bioinformatics. We are, however, aware of
the fact that the quality of a metabolic network derived
from our developed method depends on the availability
and quality of manually curated metabolic networks, and
on the orthology detection. This, however, also holds for
the annotation in protein databases. We developed the
method with the goal to accelerate the process of metabolic reconstruction, by minimizing the adjustments
needed during curation, and by giving the curator an overview of the decisions made previously by other curators.
We expect that in the future it will become possible to
select a substantial number of species which are closely
related to (any) query species, because there is a rapid
increase in the number of reconstructed genome-scale
metabolic networks by ongoing functional genomics
projects.

Methods
Collection of manually curated genome-scale metabolic
networks
We used three manually curated metabolic networks, that
of Escherichia coli K12 [22], Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1
[B. Teusink et al., manuscript in preparation, see also [17]]
and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 [33], as a source
to predict automatically a metabolic network for Lactococcus lactis IL1403. The developed method is called AUTOGRAPH (AUtomatic Transfer by Orthology of Gene
Reaction Associations for Pathway Heuristics, see Figure
1) and is outlined in detail below. The curated networks
were initially constructed with Genomatica's Simpheny™
software for constraint-based modeling purposes, and
were retrieved as flat-files containing gene-protein-reaction associations [42].

A reference metabolic network of L. lactis IL1403 has been
used to evaluate our method (discussed below). This network was also constructed for constraint-based modeling
purposes and was retrieved from the authors as a flat-file,
containing gene-reaction associations. Throughout the
article we will refer to this published reference network as
the Oliveira network [31].
To compare the automatic reconstruction of L. lactis
IL1403 metabolic network by Pathologic with that of our
method, we used the Genbank NCBI annotation file of L.
lactis IL1403 as input for the Pathologic software [27,43].
In addition, the same Genbank file together with two
manually curated networks from the BioCyc collection
(i.e. EcoCyc [16] and LacplantCyc [17]) were used as
inputs for our method (discussed below).
AUTOGRAPH: prediction of orthology and gene-reaction
associations
The AUTOGRAPH-method combines manually curated
genome-scale metabolic networks and orthology to predict a network for a query species (Figure 1). First, we
established (pairwise) orthologous relationships between
the genes of L. lactis (i.e. query species) and the genomes
of E. coli, B. subtilis and L. plantarum (see additional file 1).
The complete genome sequences of L. lactis, E. coli, B. subtilis and L. plantarum were retrieved from Genbank NCBI.
The algorithm of Inparanoid, which requires the genome
sequences as inputs, has been applied to predict orthologs
[39]. The Inparanoid method is based on Bidirectional
Best Hits (BBH) and predicts, besides one-to-one orthology (BBH), also inparalogous genes (also referred to as
recent gene duplicates). Inparalogs arise from a gene
duplication event after a speciation and are therefore
orthologous to one or multiple genes from another
genome [40]. We applied Inparanoid with the default settings.

Second, the L. lactis genes and their corresponding
orthologs in E. coli, L. plantarum and B.subtilis were
retrieved from the Inparanoid outputs using the Python
programming language [44]. Subsequently, the orthologs
were automatically analyzed for associations with one or
multiple reactions (gene-reaction associations were
derived, using Python, from the flat-files of the curated
metabolic networks). In this way, a complete list of all L.
lactis genes, and their orthologs with associated reactions,
was generated automatically (see additional file 1). Such
an approach allows for a quick analysis of gene-reaction
associations made by other curators and thereby the
reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks for
query species. The method has not been developed as a
fully automatic tool, including database construction and
visualization techniques, but rather as a frame-work to
predict gene-reaction associations in a (semi-)automatic
way. Other software exists to visualize and analyze metabolic networks [27,42,45,46].

Additional File 1
Additional file 1 has been uploaded as a Microsoft Excel file containing
eight worksheets: 1. Orthology prediction: List of orthologous gene pairs
between L. lactis, E. coli, B. subtilis and L. plantarum. Orthologs were
predicted by applying the Inparanoid algorithm, using default settings. 2.
Overlap AUTOGRAPH and Oliveira: Orthologous groups of genes from
the Oliveira network and their orthologs with associated reactions. The
reactions associated to the L. lactis genes in the Oliveira network are indicated under "Oliveira". 3. Unique genes for AUTOGRAPH: Orthologous groups of genes containing the L. lactis query genes (from Genbank)
which are not incorporated into the Oliveira network, and their orthologs
with associated reactions. L. lactis genes were classified into three different groups: (i) transport: all genes associated to transport reactions (ii)
specific: incorporation of these genes and their associated reactions would
potentially lead to additional biochemistry and hence possibly different
model predictions and (iii) choice: these genes and associated reactions
would lead to a higher resolution of the network, i.e. would specify reactions that are lumped into an overall reaction in the Oliveira network. 4.
Unique specific reactions: List of unique specific reactions that are associated to L. lactis genes which are not incorporated into the Oliveira network. 5. Examples and literature support: Examples of predicted
orthologs with literature support for L. lactis genes which are not incorporated into the Oliveira network. 6. Abbreviations E. coli: Compound
information (including compound abbreviations) of reactions which are
associated to E. coli genes. 7. Abbreviations B. subtilis: Compound

Evaluation of AUTOGRAPH
To evaluate the AUTOGRAPH-method we investigated
gene-reaction associations in the predicted and the
Oliveira network. First, the gene names from the Oliveira
network were automatically mapped onto the gene names
in the Genbank file of L. lactis IL1403 (Genbank files are
the input for AUTOGRAPH). In this way, we could recover
349 genes from the Oliveira network (of the 358 reported
in the article). Secondly, the comparison of gene-reaction
associations has been done manually, as the reaction and
compound abbreviations in the Oliveira network and in
the input networks for the AUTOGRAPH-method were
not identical.
