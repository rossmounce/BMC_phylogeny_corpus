Abstract
Background: Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) are a relatively new, but economically important crop
grown in many different parts of the world. Commercial success is driven by the development of
new cultivars with novel consumer traits including flavor, appearance, healthful components and
convenience. To increase our understanding of the genetic diversity and gene-based control of
these key traits in Actinidia, we have produced a collection of 132,577 expressed sequence tags
(ESTs).
Results: The ESTs were derived mainly from four Actinidia species (A. chinensis, A. deliciosa, A. arguta
and A. eriantha) and fell into 41,858 non redundant clusters (18,070 tentative consensus sequences
and 23,788 EST singletons). Analysis of flavor and fragrance-related gene families (acyltransferases
and carboxylesterases) and pathways (terpenoid biosynthesis) is presented in comparison with a
chemical analysis of the compounds present in Actinidia including esters, acids, alcohols and
terpenes. ESTs are identified for most genes in color pathways controlling chlorophyll degradation
and carotenoid biosynthesis. In the health area, data are presented on the ESTs involved in ascorbic
acid and quinic acid biosynthesis showing not only that genes for many of the steps in these
pathways are represented in the database, but that genes encoding some critical steps are absent.
In the convenience area, genes related to different stages of fruit softening are identified.
Conclusion: This large EST resource will allow researchers to undertake the tremendous
challenge of understanding the molecular basis of genetic diversity in the Actinidia genus as well as
provide an EST resource for comparative fruit genomics. The various bioinformatics analyses we
have undertaken demonstrates the extent of coverage of ESTs for genes encoding different
biochemical pathways in Actinidia.

Background
The genus Actinidia Lindl. is large, containing between 50
and 70 species of climbing plants originating mainly in
southern China [1]. Over the past 30 years kiwifruit has
developed into an important horticultural crop, firstly in
New Zealand, and subsequently in other countries such as
Chile, China and Italy [2,3]. Currently cultivars from three
species are grown commercially; the green-fleshed
kiwifruit, Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.F.Liang et
A.R.Ferguson, the closely related yellow-fleshed A. chinensis Planch. and the kiwiberry, A. arguta (Sieb. et Zucc.)
Planch. ex Miq. Most of the kiwifruit cultivars grown commercially are seedling selections and there has been little
systematic breeding [2]. Consequently there are still many
characteristics within the genus (Fig. 1A) that could be
incorporated into commercial cultivars [1] and to do this
efficiently requires a better knowledge of how these characteristics are regulated. For the consumer, critical desirable attributes of kiwifruit are flavor and fragrance,
appearance, healthful components and convenience.
Flavor and fragrance are determined by the chemical composition of the fruit. A wide range of compounds has been
detected within the Actinidia genus leading to distinct and
different flavors in the fruit [4]. These compounds include
polyphenolics, acids, alcohols and volatile compounds
such as terpenes and esters. Flavor is also influenced by
the sugar to acid balance, with some growers currently
receiving a premium for sweeter fruit. Actinidia fruit color

ranges from the original green kiwifruit, newer yellow
varieties as well as red, purple and orange fruit (Fig. 1B).
The extensive range of colors is caused by the presence or
absence of chlorophyll, anthocyanins and carotenoids
[4]. Healthful attributes of kiwifruit include its high ascorbic acid levels [2], quinic acid levels [5], and the presence
of triterpenes and folic acid. On the other hand, allergens
are identified as undesirable health attributes in kiwifruit
and in many other fruit [4]. Convenience includes such
factors as the ability to store the fruit for a long time [2]
and a long shelf life, as well as easy determination of eating ripeness and having an edible or peelable skin. Little
is currently known about the genetic diversity and genebased control of these major attributes in kiwifruit.
EST databases as resources for uncovering genetic diversity
have been established for many plant species (Additional
file 1). Most comprehensively surveyed are Arabidopsis
(Arabidopsis thaliana; 1,279,945 in GenBank) and rice
(Oryza sativa; 1,211,418 in GenBank), both of which have
been fully genome-sequenced. Fruit crops have been less
extensively surveyed, but recently there have been reports
on EST projects from fruit, including tomato (Lycopersicon
esculentum [6], 258,408 sequences in GenBank), grape
(Vitis vinifera, which has also had its genome fully
sequenced [7]; [8,9], 363,365 ESTs in GenBank), apple
(Malus × domestica [10], 255,103 sequences in GenBank)
and pineapple (Ananas comosus [11], 5649 ESTs in GenBank). However, there are few ESTs sequenced from the

paper we analyze more than 130,000 ESTs, derived
mainly from four species in the Actinidia genus (Table 1).
This information is presented with reference to the chemical composition of these species and using specific examples where we have increased our understanding of the
genetic diversity and gene-based control of critical
attributes.

Ericales (the order to which Actinidia belongs) registered
in GenBank (Additional file 1). These significant fruit EST
resources have been used to identify genes likely to be
involved in the ripening process in tomato [6] and in the
generation of aroma in apple [12]. In addition, ESTs are
useful sources of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), both of which are
useful markers for creating genetic maps in plants [13-19].
Knowledge of the Actinidia genome or transcriptome is
currently restricted to the 511 sequences available in GenBank (dbEST, January 2008). To improve and develop
new varieties of kiwifruit with the desired flavor, health
and convenience attributes, it is useful to use modern
genomics techniques in conjunction with breeding tools
such as marker-assisted selection and genetic transformation. For this reason, we undertook a major EST sequencing project in Actinidia to develop a basic genetic resource
covering a range of different species and tissues. In this

Overview
Actinidia cDNA libraries were constructed mainly from
four Actinidia species: A. deliciosa, A. chinensis, A. eriantha
and A. arguta (Table 1, Additional file 2). The libraries
were constructed from petals, fruits, buds and leaves, with
a small number from roots and cell culture and sequenced
from the 5' end. The average edited sequence length of the
132,577 ESTs was 503 bases. Clustering these sequences
using a 95% threshold resulted in 18,070 tentative consensus (TC) sequences (average length 577 bases), with
23,788 ESTs remaining as singletons. The combination of
TCs and singletons are referred to as non redundant (NR)
clusters. These numbers are similar to those observed with
apple [10]. Over 95% of TCs had fewer than 18 EST members, and the largest single TC had 758 members. It
should be noted that A. chinensis and A. deliciosa are more
closely related to each other than the other species mentioned in this paper, and that only a restricted number of
genotypes within each species was used in making EST
libraries compared to the total numbers available.
Sequence analysis
Codon usage
Knowledge of the GC content of a genome and codon
usage is useful when devising PCR-based strategies for
mapping and gene isolation, as well as for hybridization
studies by microarray. Based on the coding regions of 302
A. deliciosa, 319 A. chinensis and 84 A. eriantha full-length
cDNAs, the GC content in the third base position was estimated to be 55%, 49% and 58%, respectively. These values are higher than the overall GC ratio from the
sequences of the complete EST datasets of A. deliciosa
(46%), A. chinensis (46%) and A. eriantha (48%), indicating that there is some pressure, particularly in A. deliciosa
and A. eriantha, towards an increased GC ratio in coding
regions compared with non-translated regions. Overall
the codon usage of the three Actinidia species is similar,
although not identical (Additional file 3). A. deliciosa and
A. eriantha differ in only their preference for aspartate
(GAT/GAC) and serine (TCT/TCC). In contrast, comparative codon preferences between A. deliciosa and A. chinensis show differences for alanine (GCC/GCT), glycine
(GGC/GGA), isoleucine (ATC/ATT), leucine (CTC/TTG),
asparagine (AAC/AAT), glutamine (CAG/CAA), threonine
(ACC/ACT) and valine (GTG/GTT). In most of these
codons, A. chinensis shows a greater preference for an A or

Polymorphisms and genetic markers
Both SNPs and microsatellites or SSRs are valuable tools
for genetic mapping within breeding populations of many
crops. A total of 32,764 biallelic SNPs were detected from
the overlapping regions of 3,901 (21.6%) of the 18,070
TCs, at a rate of one SNP every 417 bp. This frequency is
higher than that reported in apple using a dataset of comparable size (one SNP per 706 bp from ~150,000 ESTs
[10]). As several Actinidia species were used to construct
the cDNA libraries, while the apple cDNA libraries were
from different varieties of the same species, this increased
frequency of SNPs could reflect the greater genetic diversity in the surveyed Actinidia EST libraries. For example the
frequency in apple increased significantly to 1 in 149 bp
when a greater diversity of genotypes was added (Chagne
et al unpublished results). The polyploidy nature of several of the Actinidia species used may also have affected
SNP frequencies. As a result of this, some of the SNPs
identified may not be allelic in nature but due to homoeologous or paralogous sequences clustering in the same
TC.

EST-derived SSRs have already been shown to be valuable
mapping tools in Actinidia chinensis [14] where 150 SSRs
with more than 10 dinucleotide repeat units were tested as
markers in an A. chinensis mapping population. More
than 90% of the SSR markers were polymorphic and segregated within the population. Subsequently, 20 of these
SSRs were shown to be transportable across multiple species of Actinidia, showing the value of this resource [15].

Compared with apple [10], where less than 20% of the
NRs contained a microsatellite, over 30% of Actinidia NRs
were found to have at least one. The other major difference between apple and Actinidia was that, while di- and
tri-nucleotide repeats were equally frequent in apple at 7
to 8% frequency, di-nucleotide repeats (18%) were twice
as frequent as tri-nucleotide repeats (9%) in Actinidia.
Tetra-nucleotide repeats were found at similar frequencies
in NRs for the two genera. The lengths of the SSRs were
similar in both apple and Actinidia, with 50% of the
repeats having between 12 and 14 bases. As in apple, AG
repeats were the most frequent (16% of NRs, significantly
more frequent than in apple) and were followed by AT
(1.2%) and AC (0.8%) while GC repeats were very infrequent.
The position of SSRs in relation to the putative initiation
ATG was very similar when comparing Actinidia with
other plants such as Arabidopsis and apple [10,20], with dinucleotide repeats being predominantly (93%) in the 5'
UTR, and tri-nucleotide repeats being more evenly distributed along the gene (37%).
Comparative genomic DNA hybridizations by microarray
A 17,472 feature Actinidia oligonucleotide microarray was
constructed based on sequence data from the Actinidia
EST database. The 44–55 mer oligonucleotides were
derived from gene sequences of different Actinidia species
(Additional file 4). To test the cross hybridization
between the different genomes of the Actinidia species,
genomic DNA from two Actinidia species (A. deliciosa and
A. eriantha) was hybridized to two different microarray
slides. A plot of average signal intensity for the two species
against each other is shown in Fig. 2. Of the 13,443

Functional analysis
Highly populated tentative consensus sequences
The TC with the greatest number of ESTs was a cysteine
proteinase (actinidin family, 758 members) followed by a
metallothionein (547 members) (Additional file 5).
However, when similar proteins were taken into account
(i.e. different TCs that all matched a common Arabidopsis
protein as their closest homolog with E < 1.0e-100), there
were 1,266 ESTs matching cysteine proteinases followed
by 769 metallothionein protein-encoding ESTs.

from which the oligonucleotide was derived and the
increased or decreased level of hybridization (Table 2).
Consequently, the increases are probably due to separate
gene duplications in each species.

than an average of 2-fold change), with 172 showing a
higher signal intensity in A. deliciosa (plus symbols, Fig.

It was not surprising to identify the cysteine protease actinidin as the most highly abundant TC cluster in Actinidia.
Actinidin can constitute up to 50% of soluble protein in
mature A. deliciosa fruit at harvest [21]. Recent research
has shown that this cysteine protease exists in basic and
acidic forms and the amount of each form varies between
species, with fruit of the important A. chinensis cultivar
'Hort16A' being almost devoid of acidic actinidin [22].
ESTs for actinidin occur throughout the fruit libraries that
make up the database, and these cluster into 10 distinct
genes/alleles [22]. As two of the key fruit libraries were
subtracted for actinidin, the number of ESTs in the TC is
likely to be an under-representation of the actual number.
The function of this protease may be related to insect
defense [23].
The metallothionein TC cluster contains a gene
(pKIWI504) previously identified in kiwifruit [24] as
being highly expressed in young fruit with reduced expression in the later stages of fruit development. However, the
in vivo function of the metallothionein TC cluster is currently unknown. Interestingly, pineapple also had a high
proportion of metallothionein ESTs [11].

NRs were assigned to a Mapman (Thimm et al., 2004) bin according to their nearest Arabidopsis BLAST hit. ESTs belonging to the
Actinidia NR were then assigned to the same bin.
b Potato and Arabidopsis functional assignments were as described [27,100]

Fourteen TCs in Actinidia with their proteins annotated by
BiolView as "not assigned-unknown" proteins (i.e.
matches to sequences with unknown function from Arabidopsis or other species) were highly expressed with over
100 EST members. Four of the unassigned TCs contained
more than 300 EST members. These four TCs included
kiwellin [25], which is a homolog to a grape ripeningrelated protein [26] with no Arabidopsis homologs (527
EST members); a homolog of At5g11420, a protein of
unknown function (339 EST members); a senescencerelated protein (no Arabidopsis matches, 311 EST members); and an ABA stress-related protein (no Arabidopsis
matches, 302 EST members).
Functional analysis using Mapman and InterPro
Functional analysis of ESTs and NRs using Mapman [27]
is shown in Table 3. The analysis was conducted by iden-

tifying each NR's nearest homolog to Arabidopsis, using
BLASTx and identifying domains/families that are indicative for a given function using InterProScan. Then that NR
and its member ESTs were assigned to the corresponding
bin of the Arabidopsis match. Of the 41,858 NRs, 28,345
had sufficient homology to an Arabidopsis sequence to
assign it a functional classification in Mapman. Thus, 32%
of NRs from Actinidia had no Arabidopsis homolog, but a
proportion would have homologs in other crops (e.g.
genes related to fruit ripening).
A comparison of the percentage of NRs assigned to the top
level Mapman classification bins and the percentage of
Arabidopsis genes classified in the same bin showed a
strong relationship with an r2 value of 0.96 and a slope of
0.87, near to the expected 1:1 slope. The same relationship when calculated for second level bins gave an r2 of

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:351

0.98 and a slope of 1.14 (second level bin data not
shown). Taking only those top level bins that contained
more than 100 NRs to remove chance as a major factor,
only two bins appeared to be over-represented (i.e. > 2.0
times higher than the mean) in Actinidia, namely bin 4
(glycolysis) and bin 8 (TCA cycle). This may reflect a high
level of primary metabolism in fruit. Interestingly, when
all NRs are included, bin 5 (fermentation) and bin 6 (gluconeogenesis) were added to the list of over-represented
NRs. The same relationships for potato showed no anomalies (Table 3). This analysis demonstrates that the clustering of ESTs generated a fair representation of the
distribution of genes.
Overall, the average number of ESTs per NR in the database was 4.0. There were only two bins with a high
number of ESTs per NR, bin 15 (metal handling) with
over 17 ESTs per NR and bin 22 (polyamine metabolism)
with over 9. However, bin 22 had a low number of NR
and EST members, suggesting this result may have
occurred by chance. In contrast, bin 15 included the metallothioneins and the very highly expressed EST discussed
earlier (Additional file 5).
TCs with high numbers of ESTs (> 100) came from 18 of
the 35 Mapman bins [27] with approximately three quarters falling into the bin names "not assigned, no ontology", "protein degradation", "metal handling binding
chelation and storage", "stress biotic", "cell wall degradation" and "secondary metabolism isoprenoids".
The most common InterPro families [28] were also analyzed (Additional file 6). There were 3,111 InterPro families (flagged as true by InterPro) represented in the
Actinidia NRs, with the most NRs found in the protein
kinases grouping. Following that were thioredoxins, while
cysteine proteinases, which had the highest number of
ESTs in the database, were represented as the 7th most frequently occurring NR.
Genes related to flavor and fragrance
Understanding the relationship between fruit flavor and
the genetic diversity present in the EST database requires a
detailed analysis of the flavor and fragrance compounds
present in the Actinidia genus. Fruit and flower samples
from the major Actinidia varieties that were used to produce the EST database were characterized using both
headspace sampling and solvent extraction followed by
GC-FID/MS analysis. The results of this compound analysis are presented in Additional file 7 for esters (over 55
identified compounds), acids, alcohols and terpenoids.
Compound analysis
The most abundant volatile compounds in the flowers of
these Actinidia species were alcohols and terpenes. A. chin-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/351

ensis flowers contained 71% sesquiterpenes, largely dominated by farnesols (Additional file 7). A. deliciosa flowers
had the highest volatile ester content at around 12%, and
aromatic (6–9%) and straight-chain alcohols (9%). These
flowers were notable for their α-farnesene (12–26%) and
germacrene D (0.3–12%) content. A. arguta flowers contained branched-chain (13%) and aromatic alcohols (14–
50%), and monoterpenes (12–24%), which were mostly
linalool oxidation products reported previously [29]. A.
eriantha flowers contained few volatile compounds, the
notable ones being 2-phenylethanol (8.5%), 6-methyl-5hepten-2-one (also 8.5%), and β-myrcene (5%). The
flowers from two further Actinidia species showed distinct
volatile profiles. A. polygama flowers contained linalool
oxides (36.5%) and dehydroiridodial (37%), a monoterpene related to the Nepeta cataria (catnip) compounds
[30,31]. The flowers of A. indochinensis flowers were dominated by 2-phenylethanol (25.8%) and a couple of terpenes, the major one being linalool (23.6%). The aromas
from these flowers have also had descriptors attached
(McNeilage et al. unpublished observations). For example
A. eriantha has been described as coconut and berry, and
A. arguta with descriptors including sweet, lime, rose and
vanilla [29]. A chinensis and A. deliciosa are described as
having tea-rose aromas, sweet, fresh, lilac and violet,
while A. polygama has gardenia and lime descriptors.
These descriptors reflect the diversity of volatile compounds found in the Actinidia flowers.
In fruit, esters accounted for up to 85% of the total volatiles. The main A. chinensis esters were the fresh, fruity
ethyl butanoate which, depending upon analytical
method and genotype, ranged from 3 to 54%, and butyl
butanoate, both of which are common fruit esters [32]. A.
chinensis 'Hort16A' fruit contained significant amounts of
eucalyptol (0.2 to 21%) which has been described as having a fresh, pungent cooling taste [32]. Acetaldehyde, hexanal, E-2-hexenal and ethyl butanoate are known to be
important contributors to Hort16A aromas [33]. Ethyl
butanoate along with methyl butanoate and ethyl acetate
were the major (~60%) compounds in the green A. deliciosa fruit and are known to be major volatile contributors
to its flavor [34]. The other major compound was ethanol
(16%), with only trace levels of other alcohols and terpenes. Whilst at more modest levels in A. arguta fruit (2–
8%), ethyl butanoate was still substantial. A. arguta fruit
were notable for their content of methyl- and ethyl benzoate, which are responsible for the distinctive aroma of
feijoa (Feijoa sellowiana O. Berg) fruit [35], and also camphor (7%). The dominant ester in A. eriantha fruit was
butyl acetate (12%), a flavor compound found in many
fruit, which has a strong, fruity odor and a taste reminiscent of pineapple [32,36]. However, the total volatile level
in A. eriantha is lower than other species and the number
of esters is also lower (Additional file 7).

Ester biosynthesis
Esters are synthesized from their acid and alcohol precursors by acyltransferases (ATs). We identified 30 ATs in the
Actinidia EST database, of which 25 are full length. These
sequences were analyzed for their phylogenetic relationship with other plant ATs of known function (Fig. 3). Two
clades were identified that contained enzymes involved in
the synthesis of flavor-related esters (Clades 1 and 2 in Fig.
3). The first contained alcohol acyltransferases (AATs)
from apple, melon and banana and nine AATs from Actinidia (AdAT1, AdAT2, AeAT9, AcAT15, AcAT16, AdAT17,
AaAT18, AcAT20, AcAT23), while the second clade contained AATs from strawberry and three AATs from Actinidia (AdAT6, AdAT22, AcAT24). An Actinidia AT
predicted to be involved in esterifying anthocyanins
(AcAT25) and two ATs predicted to be anthranilate acyltransferases (AdAT8, AcAT21) were also identified. Three
Actinidia ATs were closely related to the carboxylesteraserelated protein 2 CER2 and therefore predicted to be elongases (AcAT30, AcAT27 and AcAT26) possibly involved in
wax production.

Multiple sequences of the same genes were recovered for
some genes reflecting orthologs, alleles or sequences from
different genomes within polyploid genomes. For example, the three ATs, AcAT16, AdAT17 and AdAT1, and the
two ATs, AaAT18 and AdAT2, are probable variants of just
two different AATs. A. deliciosa is a hexaploid (6n) possibly explaining this multiplicity of genes. We may have
uncovered at least one instance where, for a single AAT, all
three genomic versions have been isolated (AcAT16,
AdAT17 and AdAT1).
Carboxylesterases conduct the opposite reaction to ATs,
i.e. the hydrolysis of esters into acids and alcohols [37]. As
well as ester hydrolysis, plant carboxylesterases have been
implicated in isoflavonoid biosynthesis [38], plant
defense [39], and hormone regulation [40]. Analysis of
Actinidia flowers and fruits showed a wide range of acids
and alcohols (Additional file 7).
Previously published plant carboxylesterase (CXE) genes
from GenBank were used to identify CXE genes in the Actinidia EST database using BLAST searches. The sequence
alignment of CXEs revealed amino acid motifs and secondary structural features characteristic for members of
the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily and more particularly
of CXEs such as an active site serine surrounded by a
GXSXG motif.
In Actinidia 19 CXEs were identified, 18 of which are full
length (Fig. 4). These include CXE members likely to
encode gibberellin receptors (AdCXE9, AdCXE17,
AdCXE15), an isoflavanone dehydratase (AeCXE11) and
an ortholog of a plant defense-associated CXE (AcCXE12).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/351

Other CXEs from Actinidia align well with Arabidopsis
CXEs and can be associated with the classes identified
elsewhere [41]. The structure of an Actinidia CXE is now
available (AeCXE1), the first plant CXE to have its structure solved [42]. AeCXE1 can hydrolyze a range of substrates from C2 to C16 esters, with a preference for C4
moieties. There are two CXEs from Actinidia (AdCXE16,
AaCXE2) that may be orthologs to AeCXE1 from A. eriantha.
Terpene biosynthesis
Actinidia terpenoid compounds such as monoterpenes
(C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) diterpenes (C20), triterpenes
(C30), carotenoids, sterols, phytols and quinones are
derived from two common precursor molecules, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate. These
precursors are produced via the cytoplasmic mevalonate
pathway or the chloroplastic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (mevalonate-independent) pathway [43]. Genes for
enzymes in both these pathways are present in the Actinidia EST database, with the results for analysis of ESTs in
the early steps of the mevalonate pathway shown in Fig. 5.
The conversion of these precursors into other intermediates of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, including geranyl
diphosphate,
farnesyl
diphosphate,
and
geranylgeranyl diphosphate, is carried out by polyisoprene synthase genes (EC 2.5.1.x). Over 200 ESTs with
sequence homology to known polyisoprene synthase
genes were found in the Actinidia EST database including
116 ESTs with similarity to dimethyallyltranstransferase
(EC 2.5.1.1), 66 ESTs with homology to known monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and 38 ESTs homologous to squalene synthase (EC 2.2.1.21). No ESTs for
phytoene synthase (EC 2.5.1.32) were identified.

The EST database collection has been used to identify a
multifunctional terpene synthase gene from A. deliciosa
flowers that produces the sesquiterpene germacrene D
and a range of other sesquiterpene products at lower
abundance [44]. This gene is represented by 10 sequences
in the EST database.
Genes related to color
Chlorophyll catabolism
Green fleshed commercial kiwifruit such as A. deliciosa
'Hayward' are characterized by the retention of chlorophylls in the flesh of ripe fruit [45]. In contrast, the newer
yellow-fleshed fruit cultivars (e.g. A. chinensis 'Hort16A'
and 'Jintao') degrade the chlorophyll during ripening and
the consequent loss of the green color uncovers the underlying yellow carotenoid pigmentation.

The degradation of chlorophylls (leading to the production of colorless breakdown products) is controlled by
catabolic enzymes in the chlorophyll degradation path-

way [46]. Actinidia ESTs discovered in the pathway of
chlorophyll breakdown are shown in Fig. 6. Chlorophyllase is the first enzyme of the catabolic pathway and it
removes the phytol chain from chlorophyll a. Homologs
of this enzyme have been mainly identified in libraries of
vegetative tissues (breaking buds, leaves and petals) of A.
deliciosa and A. chinensis. Homologs of pheophorbide a
oxygenase have also been identified, with eight ESTs representing two genes from fruit libraries of A. chinensis. This
enzyme is responsible for opening the tetrapyrrolic ring of
the chlorophyll molecules, the critical step for the loss of
green color. Surprisingly, we did not identify any ESTs of
red chlorophyll catabolite reductase, an enzyme associated with pheophorbide a oxygenase and required to
complete the porphyrin ring opening and the degradation
of chlorophyll.
Carotenoid biosynthesis
The fruit of many Actinidia species contain a range of carotenoid pigments, including β-carotene and lutein [45].
The yellow-fleshed kiwifruit A. chinensis 'Hort16A' develops as a green-fleshed fruit, but on ripening the chlorophyll is degraded exposing the carotenoids in the yellow
flesh. ESTs for most steps in the biosynthesis of carotenoids [47-49] are present in the Actinidia EST database (Fig.

7), except the first step, phytoene synthase. Ninety eight
ESTs for phytoene desaturase were identified, with 94
coming from A. deliciosa libraries, and the remainder from
A. chinensis libraries. Of these 98 ESTs, 90 came from a single A. deliciosa fruit library with eight from bud and meristem libraries. Of the 56 ESTs found for lycopene βcyclase, 23 were from petal tissues and 32 from fruit
libraries. These ESTs were largely found in libraries from
A. deliciosa (31) and A. chinensis (24), with only one EST
from A. eriantha. In contrast, only a single EST was found
for lycopene ε-cyclase, which is the enzyme required with
lycopene β-cyclase to convert lycopene to α-carotene [50].
There were five ESTs of β-carotene hydroxylase found in
petal (3), leaf (1) and dormant bud (1) libraries, but only
a single EST was present for ε-carotene hydroxylase. Both
of these enzymes are required for lutein synthesis [51].
Flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis
Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites synthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway [52].
Anthocyanins are a subgroup of the flavonoids, which
appear red to blue, depending on the pH, due to additions
to their phenolic rings. In red fruit of A. chinensis and A.
deliciosa, the predominant anthocyanins are cyanidinbased and the preferred glycosylation is in the 3' position
[53]. While many of the kiwifruit libraries came from tissue with low levels of anthocyanins, several libraries were
derived from tissue containing anthocyanins, including
red fruits, brown skins and pink petals, leaves and buds
(Additional file 2a).

The anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway was analyzed by
BLAST searching for ESTs representing different enzymes
in the pathway (Fig. 8). Chalcone synthase (CHS) was a
highly represented gene family in the EST database with
~300 ESTs. There appeared to be three distinct CHS NRs,
possibly representing three genes, that are found in
mostly young A. eriantha fruit libraries, as well as in bud
and petal libraries. There was only one apparent chalcone
isomerase (CHI) NR and over half the ESTs for this gene
were found in shoot and bud libraries. Two distinct flavanol 3-hydroxylase (F3H) NRs were found, with ESTs predominantly found in bud and cell culture libraries. Only
one flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) NR was found,
from A. eriantha fruit, while ESTs for two distinct flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) NRs were predominantly
found in shoot and bud libraries. Of the four potential
dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) NRs, the most highly
represented was found in bud and young fruit. Three NRs,
perhaps representing three gene families, of leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) were found in the EST
database, with most ESTs in bud libraries. The ESTs with
highest sequence similarity to UDP-glucose flavonoid 3O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) are also predominantly
found in developing buds of A. deliciosa.

Distribution
Distribution of Actinidia ESTs in the flavonoid biosynthetic
pathway. Previously published sequences in GenBank belonging to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway [49] were used to
identify genes in the Actinidia EST database using BLAST
searches. Enzyme names are followed in brackets by the
number of ESTs in different families of genes encoding these
enzymes. See text for abbreviations.

Many of the ESTs for anthocyanin biosynthesis were
sequenced from young fruit libraries (particularly A. eriantha) and in A. deliciosa buds. Developing buds from A. deliciosa appear to be a darker red color and therefore
presumably accumulate more anthocyanins than buds
from A. chinensis and A. eriantha, so it is not surprising to
find ESTs for these later biosynthetic steps in bud tissue
from A. deliciosa. However, ESTs for genes encoding
enzymes from the early steps in the flavonoid pathway
(e.g. CHS and F3H) are found in unpigmented A. eriantha
fruit suggesting these tissues may accumulate a different
class of flavonoids.
Most of the enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis are
well represented in the EST database except for F3'5'H.
This is not surprising given the only anthocyanins identified in A. deliciosa and A. chinensis are glycosylated in the
3' position. There are, however, species within the genus

Actinidia, such as A. melanandra, that accumulate high levels of delphinidin, a different aglycone that would require
F3'5'H activity. No ESTs from these species were
sequenced.
Genes related to healthful components
Ascorbic acid-related genes
Kiwifruit are well known to be high in ascorbic acid (vitamin C), with values in commercial varieties ranging from
80 to 120 mg per 100 g fresh weight of fruit [54], and with
A. eriantha having up to 10 times as much again. Ascorbic
acid is synthesized in plants from glucose, through three
potential pathways: the L-galactose pathway, the galacturonate pathway and through myo-inositol [55]. Myo-inositol is a major sugar alcohol found in kiwifruit (Additional
file 7; [56,57]). The only pathway that is well established
is the L-galactose pathway for which all the enzymes have
now been identified in plants [55,58]. Many of the genes
are known for the other two potential pathways, but several steps are still unknown. The Actinidia EST database
was searched for ESTs similar to genes known to encode
steps in these pathways. The numbers of ESTs homologous to various identified genes in the three pathways of
ascorbic acid biosynthesis are shown in Fig. 9. Surprisingly for these high vitamin C plants, while the number of
ESTs found in early steps in all the pathways is relatively
large, the number of ESTs found in the two last steps is
much lower, with no examples of ESTs encoding the last
step of two of the pathways, that catalyzed by L-galactono
lactone dehydrogenase.
Quinic acid metabolism
Fruit from Actinidia species have a relatively high total acid
content (1–3% w/w) of which 40–60% can be quinic
acid, 40–60% citric acid and 10% malic acid (Additional
file 7). Quinic acid comprises an even higher proportion
of the total acids during early fruit development [59], and
over 25-fold variation in quinic acid content can be found
in fruit of a single A. chinensis cross [60]. Kiwifruit are unusual in having such a high content of quinic acid as a fresh
fruit, although levels of quinic acid in cranberry juice can
be around 1% [61] and peaches can have up to 0.2%
quinic acid [62].

Quinic acid is a key intermediate in lignin biosynthesis,
folic acid metabolism, aromatic acid synthesis, anthranilate biosynthesis, and purine metabolism. The molecular
and enzymatic control of quinic acid storage and metabolism may affect all these pathways. However, little is
known about quinic acid metabolism in Actinidia species.
ESTs for all the enzymes in the quinic acid biosynthetic
pathway to shikimate (Fig. 10), except for a quinate dehydrogenase, have been identified in the Actinidia EST database.

Figure 10 of Actinidia ESTs in the quinate biosynthetic pathway
Distribution
Distribution of Actinidia ESTs in the quinate biosynthetic pathway. Previously published sequences in GenBank belonging to the
quinate biosynthetic pathway [98] were used to identify genes in the Actinidia EST database. The number of ESTs found in the
Actinidia EST database for each step of each pathways is shown. Dehydroquinate dehydratase and shikimate dehydrogenase are
two activities of a single bifunctional enzyme encoded by one gene [99].

Page 16 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:351

Of the 13 ESTs identified for dehydroquinate synthase,
eight were found in fruit or petal libraries, the rest were
sequenced from bud or leaf libraries. Of the 16 ESTs identified for the bifunctional dehydroquinate dehydratase/
shikimate dehydrogenase, 11 were from fruit or petal
libraries and five from bud or leaf libraries. These ESTs
were found mainly in libraries made from A. deliciosa and
A. chinensis tissues and to a lesser extent in A. arguta and
A. eriantha libraries, reflecting the distribution of ESTs
among the species. An enzyme has been reported with
predominantly quinate dehydrogenase activity [63], but
the gene for this enzyme has not been cloned.
Allergens
Food allergies are estimated to affect ~6% of young children and ~3% of adults [64]. Kiwifruit have been recognized as a potentially allergenic fruit for over 20 years and
reported allergies to kiwifruit are increasing [65]. Most
allergy symptoms to kiwifruit are quite mild, but severe
reactions have been reported, particularly in young children [66]. Allergies have been recorded in all three commercial species of Actinidia [67].

The Actinidia EST database contains sequences with
homology to many known plant allergen proteins [68].
Potential allergens include the 2S albumin proteins, lipid
transfer proteins, thaumatin-like protein (TLP), α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors, latex allergens, plant chitinases,
profilins, cystatins, Bet v 1 homologous proteins and
plant seed globulin allergens. However, only a small
number of potential kiwifruit allergens have been directly
confirmed by immunological testing, including the
cysteine protease actinidin (Act d 1; [69]), an unidentified
43 kDa protein (Act d 2; [70], a TLP [70] and kiwellin
[25].
ESTs for actinidin occurred throughout the 37 libraries
from seven species that make up the database, and these
clustered into acidic and basic forms of 10 distinct genes/
alleles [22]. No matches were found by BLAST searching
the EST database for the 43 kDa protein Act d 2. Kiwellin
ESTs were found in libraries from most Actinidia species
but were particularly abundant in A. eriantha ripe fruit
skin, accounting for ~40% of ESTs in that library. The EST
database contained 24 NRs with homology to TLPs from
other plants (e.g. Pru a 2 from cherry and thaumatin 1
from Thaumatococcus daniellii), and all but one EST contained the 16 conserved cysteine residues characteristic of
this protein class [71]. The various NRs could be aligned
and clustered into 4 or 5 groups (data not shown), with
two NRs accounting for the bulk of the ESTs (46 and
29%).
Globulin proteins (11S and 7S) have been reported from
a wide range of seeds, including cereals [72,73] and leg-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/351

umes [74]. Globulin-like proteins are also found in A.
thaliana [75] and a gene family of 10 globulin-like genes
are present in Arabidopsis gene databases (The Arabidopsis
Information Resource (TAIR), http://arabidopsis.org/).
11S globulins are composed of sets of polymorphic subunits derived from a multigene family. They exist as hexamers with molecular mass between 300 and 400 kDa, or as
trimers. 11S globulin subunits consist of two polypeptide
chains linked by at least one S-S bridge between cysteine
residues at highly conserved positions in the acidic alphachain and basic beta-chain. Both chains are post-translationally generated from a common precursor protein,
which represents the product of one member of the multigene family [76]. 11S globulins have been shown to be
related to the 7S globulins through sequence comparisons
[77].
A BLAST search of the Actinidia EST sequence database
with a range of previously identified globulin protein
sequences identified two ESTs with a predicted protein
sequence matching 11S globulin, both from a library
made from A. chinensis whole fruit, which included seeds.
Other related sequences from Actinidia fruit libraries
belonged to the 7S vicilins-like family (38 ESTs), which
were found in only fruit-based libraries from A. deliciosa,
A. chinensis and A. arguta. These libraries would have all
included seeds. A third grouping of sequences was identified that we have named other globulins (OG) (201
ESTs). The OG group appears to be more closely related to
the 7S globulins than to the 11S (Fig 11). All three groupings are supported by the clustering of the Arabidopsis
globulin genes as well as globulin genes from other species. While most OG ESTs were found in fruit libraries
(81%), which included seeds, some members of the OG
family were found in fruit skin, buds and petal libraries,
suggesting a role other than as seed storage proteins. These
OG ESTs were found in libraries derived from A. deliciosa
(100), A. chinensis (42), A. arguta (39), and A. eriantha
(16).
Genes related to fruit softening
Some kiwifruit cultivars exhibit outstanding storage characteristics e.g. A. deliciosa 'Hayward' fruit can be stored for
4–6 months at 0°C. Other Actinidia species exhibit a range
of ripening and softening behaviors [78]. A. eriantha
develops a peelable skin as the fruit ripen, A. arguta ripens
in less than 10 days at 20°C versus 20–25 days for A. deliciosa and A. chinensis [79], whilst some small-fruited Actinidia genotypes tend to remain firm even towards the end
of the ripening process [78].

The main chemical changes occurring in the cell wall during kiwifruit softening are pectin solubilization and degradation, reduction in the molecular weight of
xyloglucan, and galactose loss from pectin side chains.

Figure 12 of Actinidia ESTs involved in postharvest kiwifruit softening
Distribution
Distribution of Actinidia ESTs involved in postharvest kiwifruit softening. Schematic representation of postharvest kiwifruit softening in relation to the timing of key events in the softening process of ethylene-treated 'Hayward' fruit. Diagram modified
from [80]). Previously published sequences in GenBank involved in postharvest softening processes were used to identify genes
in the Actinidia EST database using BLAST searches. The first number in each set of brackets represents the total number of
ESTs found in the Actinidia database and the second number is the number of ESTs found in fruit libraries.

Microscopically, the cell wall shows extensive swelling,
until at the end of the softening process dissolution of
middle lamellae can be observed [80]. These processes
eventually lead to disintegration of the cell wall. Although
similar chemical changes occur in other fruit [81], these
changes occur concurrently with ethylene production and
the respiratory climacteric. In kiwifruit, however, most of
the softening process is well separated temporally from
the climacteric and ethylene production (shown schematically in Fig. 12).
The genes for many enzymes involved in the key chemical
changes in the cell wall during ripening are represented in
the Actinidia EST database. Three enzymes involved in
pectin degradation (pectin lyase, pectin methylesterase
and polygalacturonase) are particularly abundant with
244, 611 and 414 ESTs, respectively. Genes encoding
expansin, a protein implicated in pectin solubilization
early in the kiwifruit softening process [80], are also
highly abundant (468 ESTs). Galactose loss from fruit cell
walls during the softening process has been attributed to
the action of β-galactosidases [82]. A β-galactosidase from

ripe kiwifruit has been purified. However, the activity of
the enzyme in vitro against synthetic or purified native
substrates from kiwifruit was far too low to account for the
amount of galactose loss observed during softening [83].
Ninety β-galactosidase ESTs were observed in fruit libraries in the EST database and are good candidates for genetic
manipulation and to study the role of this enzyme. During softening, xyloglucan is also hydrolyzed. As xyloglucan and cellulose create the major load-bearing network
of the cell wall, any xyloglucan degradation is thought to
weaken the cell wall, resulting in softening of the fruit. In
kiwifruit, hydrolysis of xyloglucan occurs mainly during
the rapid softening phase. Endoglucanases and xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) enzymes are implicated in this process. XTHs catalyze both hydrolytic and
transglucosylation reactions, and an XTH enzyme capable
of carrying out both reactions has been isolated from
kiwifruit [84]. This particular XTH, however, is expressed
late in kiwifruit ripening, when xyloglucan degradation
has already come to an end. The 96 XTH ESTs found in
fruit libraries will allow the identification of genes
involved in hydrolysis of xyloglucan during the rapid sof-

tening phase. ESTs for enzymes that act on minor kiwifruit
cell wall components such as galactoglucomannans or
glucuronoarabinoxylans [80] were less abundant in the
EST database (e.g. mannan transglycosylase/hydrolase
(MTH), 10 ESTs found in fruit).

Discussion
We report on a significant resource of over 130,000 ESTs
derived from a range of Actinidia species (Table 1). We targeted tissues and developmental stages in order to sample
genes involved in physiological and biochemical processes including fruit ripening, flavor development, control
of color and the synthesis of chemicals with health-related
attributes. For this reason, the two most widely cultivated
species of kiwifruit, A. chinensis and A. deliciosa, are well
represented with together over 100,000 ESTs (Table 1). In
addition, fruit and bud libraries are also well represented,
with over 38,000 and 50,000 ESTs, respectively. A. chinensis and A. deliciosa are so closely related, as is A. setosa (Li)
C.F. Liang et A.R.Ferguson, that they are variously treated
as being distinct species or as varieties of the one species.
The other two main species studied, A. arguta and A. eriantha Benth., also have commercial potential but are
more distantly related [2].
The genus Actinidia is unusual in how much inter-taxal
and intra-taxal variation in ploidy and in the wild, there is
a structured reticulate pattern of diploids, tetraploids, hexaploids, and octoploids in diminishing frequency, associated, in at least some taxa, with geographic separation of
ploidy races. A. deliciosa is hexaploid, A. setosa is diploid,
and there are diploid and tetraploid races of A. chinensis,
the tetraploids apparently coming from a restricted part of
the natural distribution of the species. Most evidence suggests that diploid A. chinensis was a progenitor of tetraploid A. chinensis and hexaploid A. deliciosa but it is not
clear whether genomes from other species have contributed. The basic chromosome number (n = 29) is high and
it seems increasingly likely that diploid A. chinensis is itself
a rediploidized palaeopolyploid [2].
As is common in EST sequencing projects (e.g., [6,8,10],
there is a high degree of redundancy in the ESTs, with clustering reducing the number of unique sequences from
over 132,000 to 41,858 NRs (18,070 TCs, 23,788 singletons). We would expect this number of NRs to be an overestimate of the number of genes in Actinidia, especially
given that the database contains sequences from multiple
species of Actinidia. Using the same correction used in the
apple EST paper [10], we expect an Actinidia genome to
have around 27,000 genes.
On average 20% (± 2% standard error) of the sequences
from each library with over 1000 ESTs were singletons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/351

suggesting a high degree of novelty in these libraries. On
average 28% (± 4%) of sequences did not have a homolog
in the various public databases based on BLAST searches
with an E value > 1.0e-10. An average of 16% (± 3%) of
ESTs were identified as 3' UTR candidates based on the
presence of a poly(A) tail within 40 bp of the start (taking
into account reverse sequences). These 3' sequences
would not be expected to be identified by BLAST searches
and so would affect the novelty of a library. Less than 12%
of NRs did not have BLAST matches (E > 10) in the Arabidopsis proteome, Uniref, NCBI ref or SwissProt databases.
There was only a small degree of overlap in NRs between
libraries. Libraries from different species and different tissues showed a 5 to 9% overlap in NRs, libraries from different species but the same tissue showed an 8 to 10%
overlap and libraries from the same species but different
tissue showed a 7 to 13% commonality in NRs. These
comparisons were made over five large libraries with more
than 9,000 EST members each and an average of 2.1 ESTs
per NR. These results suggest that there were more NRs in
common between libraries made from the same tissue or
from the same species, but this tendency was not particularly marked.
Detecting SNPs using an automatically assembled EST
database is a cost effective way to discover new DNA polymorphisms and develop novel markers, although it can
be a challenging task, especially in polyploid Actinidia species. A significant proportion of the sequence variants predicted from overlapping ESTs within an NR will
correspond to "real" SNPs, which means the sequence differences found are allelic variants of a given locus and not
sequencing errors or differences between paralogs,
homoeologs or orthologs. Homoeolog SNPs could be
particularly common in the polyploid accessions of species such as A. deliciosa and A. arguta that make up a large
proportion of this database, but are also possible in diploids as a result of conserved gene pairs of paleopolyploid
origin. Allelic SNPs can be used directly and converted
into molecular markers for genetic mapping, population
genetics and linkage disequilibrium studies or for markerassisted selection. A SNP marker for determining the sex
of kiwifruit seedlings [85] has already been successfully
utilized. Since the database contains sequence data from
multiple species, and ~40% of TCs are made up of more
than one species, several SNPs were detected in the Actinidia EST database corresponding to sequence between
orthologous loci from different Actinidia species. Hence,
they cannot fully be considered as allelic SNPs, but more
as species-specific variations. However, as kiwifruit breeding programs often use controlled crosses between different species, the interspecific SNPs will segregate in the
progeny and be useful as markers.

The incidence of SSRs in NRs was higher in Actinidia
(30%) than in apple (20%), and the frequency of dinucleotide and tri-nucleotide SSRs differed between these
two species. This increase was evident in all of the
sequence classes but greatest in AG and AC (double the
incidence among apple NRs). Even though the Actinidia
genome EST resource represents several species, while
apple came mainly from one species, this would not
explain these differences. Perhaps the longer period of
domesticity in apple, based on a narrow genetic basis
compared to kiwifruit, may explain the difference. Alternatively it may reflect that a greater proportion of homoeologs have grouped into TCs in the polyploid kiwifruit
data than in the apple dataset.
Overall the codon usage of the three Actinidia species
shares many similarities with that of other dicotyledons
represented in the codon usage database [86]. Comparisons with Arabidopsis codon usage showed that A. deliciosa
and A. eriantha differ markedly for 15 and 17 amino acids,
respectively, whereas A. chinensis differs in its preference
for eight particular amino acids. Further comparisons
with apple, grape, pear, peach, loblolly pine, tomato, citrus, potato and tobacco showed that the codon preference
of the Actinidia species is most similar to that of apple
[10]. A. deliciosa differs from apple only in its codon preference for aspartate, glycine, isoleucine and leucine. A. eriantha also differs from apple for these four amino acids
and also serine. The codon preference for A. chinensis and
apple also differ for only four amino acids, these being
asparagine, glutamine, threonine and valine. CpG suppression is also evident in Actinidia species with an XCG/
XCC ratio of between 0.68 and 0.71 for the three species
evaluated. This modest level of suppression of the CpG dinucleotides is similar to that of apple (0.64) and differs
markedly from that of Arabidopsis which shows nearly no
suppression (0.92) and from the high level found in grape
(0.35). This may well reflect different levels of methylation in the coding sequences used by different species of
plants.
Mapman was used to assign function to the Actinidia NRs
and thus to their constitutive ESTs. Only 32% of the ESTs
did not have an Arabidopsis homolog at E < 1.0e-10. In general, the functional distribution of NRs was very similar to
the functional distribution of Arabidopsis proteins (Table
3) suggesting that the sampling of Actinidia ESTs well represented the major functional classes of plant genes. This
is surprising given the biased selection of libraries with
virtually no root ESTs sequenced. However, the high
number of bud meristem libraries meant that genes
expressed in metabolically active dividing tissue were
sampled.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/351

Fruit of the Actinidia genus show several characteristics
that distinguish them from other fruit species. These
include flesh color (green is the most common, but yellow, orange and red fruit also occur in the genus), chemical composition including high vitamin C and quinic acid
contents, and a novel aroma composition (Additional file
7), characterized by the abundant esters. In addition,
kiwifruit has been identified as a fruit with a potential to
cause allergenicity among consumers, although this is a
problem common to many other fruit. For this reason, we
analyzed the Actinidia EST database to identify genes
involved in these pathways and products. These analyses
showed the depth and usefulness of the database for
selecting candidate genes for most steps in the selected
pathways. The other useful characteristic of the Actinidia
EST database is the wide range of genetic and phenotypic
diversity sampled across the Actinidia genus (Fig. 1) and
the value of using this diversity to discover novel traits
through functional genomics and through mapping and
positional cloning approaches.

Conclusion
This paper describes an EST resource in the Actinidia genus
and discusses many of the properties of this collection.
However, there is still a tremendous challenge in understanding the molecular basis of the genetic diversity of this
genus, and we expect putting this EST resource into the
public domain will enhance future understanding of the
genetic basis of the many divergent traits in this fruit.

Methods
Plant material
Tissues were collected from Actinidia species growing in
New Zealand at HortResearch research orchards in Auckland, Bay of Plenty (Te Puke) and Northland (Kerikeri)
from 1999 to 2003. Table 1 and Additional file 2a provide
details of tissues, species and treatments.
Library construction and EST sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from Actinidia tissues by established methods [87,88]. Messenger RNA was isolated
from total RNA by passage through oligo(dT)-cellulose
columns (GE Healthcare, USA), and cDNA cloned into
either phage (ZapcDNA Synthesis Kit and Zap-cDNA
Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit; Stratagene, USA) or plasmid-based libraries (SuperScript System for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning; Invitrogen, USA). In some libraries,
subtractive or other enrichment techniques were used
(Additional file 2b).

Plasmids from the phage cDNA libraries were mass
excised, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). Plasmid extractions were then under-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:351

taken on individual bacterial colonies of either the phagederived or the plasmid-derived cDNA libraries and the
corresponding cDNA inserts sequenced predominantly
from the 5' end. Big Dye Terminator sequencing reactions
were resolved on ABI377, ABI3100, or ABI3700 sequencers, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied
Biosystems, USA). For determination of the complete
sequence of cDNA clones, M13R and M13F or T3 and T7
primers were used for 5' and 3' end sequencing. EST-specific primers were used to determine the complete
sequence of cDNA clones. In situations where EST clones
had long poly(A) tails (generally 40 nucleotides) and,
therefore, failed to yield good quality sequence with
standard sequencing primers, an anchored T24VN primer
was used. Resulting sequences were edited manually and
assembled using Sequencher software, version 4.0.5
(GeneCodes). Sequencing progress for each cDNA library
was assessed manually for clone length, redundancy and
sequence quality.
Bioinformatics
EST sequences were automatically trimmed of vector,
adapter, and low quality sequence regions, and uploaded
to a relational database. Automatic annotation was performed using the HortResearch BioView sequence annotation pipeline (BioView – an enterprise bioinformatics
system for automated analysis and annotation of nongenomic DNA sequence (Crowhurst R, Davy M, Deng C,
unpublished)) that utilizes a relational database (MySQL;
http://www.mysql.com). The EST clustering phase was
performed using The Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR) gene indices clustering tools http://www.tigr.org/
tdb/tgi/software. The representation of protein families,
domains, and functional sites within the Actinidia NRs
was determined using InterProScan [89]. The proteome
for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was obtained from
TAIR [90], and comparisons to proteins from Arabidopsis
using BLASTx were used to identify Actinidia NRs with
similarity to Arabidopsis proteins.

Detection of SSRs was undertaken using a PERL program
within BioView that identified tandem repetition of
sequence words in target sequences. SSRs were characterized by repeat type (di-, tri-, or tetra-nucleotide repeat
units), repeat length, and position. Only repeats longer
than 10 bp were included in the analyses. When reporting
the frequency of repeat classes, different di- and tri-nucleotide sequences were combined by type; for example, AG
repeats also encompassed repeats identified as GA and
their complementary sequences CT or TC repeats. Prediction of SNPs and insertion/deletions and sequencing
errors was performed using PERL scripts within BioView
that parsed the output of contig sequences generated by
the CAP3 DNA sequence assembly program [91].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/351

Codon usage tables were derived from cDNA sequences
encoding predicted full-length proteins. Clones were predicted to be full length only if they started with an ATG
codon and terminated with a stop codon at positions
equivalent to those of other plant genes. Codon usage was
calculated from sequences using the CUSP program
implemented within EMBOSS [92]. For functional analysis using Mapman [27], each Actinidia NR was assigned
the nearest Arabidopsis BLASTx match (E < 1.0e-10) if there
was no conflicting evidence from domains or families
detected by InterProScan. The NR and its EST members
were then assigned a Mapman classification bin and bin
name based on that assigned to the Arabidopsis match.
Homology searching and phylogenetic analysis
Previously published protein sequences from GenBank
were used to identify genes in the Actinidia EST database
using tBLASTn searches [93], typically with a cutoff value
of E < 1.0e-20. Identified genes were then manually
checked to ensure accuracy. Amino acid alignments of
predicted proteins were constructed using Clustal X. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the PHYLIP suite
of programs [94]. Distances were calculated using protdist, and the Fitch method was used to construct a tree.
Bootstrap analysis was conducted using 1000 bootstrap
replicates using seqboot [94]. Treeview (v.1.6.6) was used
to display resulting trees [95].
Microarray construction
For each predicted NR in the Actinidia EST database, a 45–
55 mer oligonucleotide was created, using PERL scripts
within BioView that selected all possible oligonucleotides
within a gene based on uniqueness of sequence, lack of
repetitive regions, and a constant melting temperature.
For each NR the most 3' oligonucleotide that passed these
criteria was selected for synthesis. As the EST libraries were
sequenced from different Actinidia species, the resulting
oligonucleotides were derived from genes from different
Actinidia species. A total of 17,472 oligonucleotides were
made, with the majority coming from A. chinensis and A.
deliciosa. A summary of the oligonucleotides used to construct the Actinidia microarray slides by library and species
is given in Additional file 4. Genomic DNA from A. deliciosa 'Hayward' and A. eriantha (genotype 11-6-15e) was
labeled and each microarray hybridized as described previously [12]. Data were normalized using quantile normalization in the Bioconductor package Limma [96].
Chemical analysis of actinidia flowers and fruit
Volatile flavor and aroma compounds
Both headspace and solvent sampling was used to obtain
volatiles. For headspace sampling of flowers, whole flowers (2.5–5 g) that were 50–75% open were placed in a 250
ml Quickfit™ Erlenmeyer flask to which was fitted a volatile trapping cartridge packed with 100 mg of Chromo-

sorb 105™ absorbent and sampled and analyzed as
described earlier [29]. For fruit, ten fruit (eating-ripe) were
cut longitudinally in half and one half of each fruit was
used for headspace sampling and analysis [29]. The other
halves were frozen in liquid N2 for solvent extraction.
For solvent extraction, either ~1 g of flower petals were
rinsed in 2 ml of purified 50:50 pentane/Et2O or 20 g of
fruit was pulped, and gently shaken in a sealed test tube
with 10 mL of pentane:Et2O (8:2) for 1–2 min, four times
over a 2 h period at room temperature. Samples were
processed and analyzed by GC-MS as described earlier
[29].
Quantification of compounds was carried out using an
average FID response based on methyl butanoate, ethyl
butanoate, hexanol and methyl benzoate. Component
identification was by comparison with spectra in the Mass
Spectral Database (1998 NIST and an in-house database),
retention indices (in-house database) and in some cases
direct GC-MS comparison with authentic standards.
Analysis of fruit acids and sugars
Tissue was ground in liquid N2 and acids and sugars were
extracted from a known mass of tissue (1.4–2.5 g) into 10
mL of 80% EtOH (with adonitol and tartaric acid added
as internal standards) at 60°C for 1 h. The extracts were
processed, sugars and organic acids derivatized and then
quantified by GC [97]. Identification of the acids and sugars was confirmed by GC-MS comparison with mixtures
of authentic compounds.
Sequence data
Sequence data for the ESTs described in this paper can be
found at GenBank under accession numbers FG396013 –
FG528589.
