Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that act as regulators of gene expression in
eukaryotes modulating a large diversity of biological processes. The discovery of miRNAs has provided new
opportunities to understand the biology of a number of species. The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus,
causes significant economic losses in cattle production worldwide and this drives us to further understand their
biology so that effective control measures can be developed. To be able to provide new insights into the biology
of cattle ticks and to expand the repertoire of tick miRNAs we utilized Illumina technology to sequence the small
RNA transcriptomes derived from various life stages and selected organs of R. microplus.
Results: To discover and profile cattle tick miRNAs we employed two complementary approaches, one aiming to
find evolutionary conserved miRNAs and another focused on the discovery of novel cattle-tick specific miRNAs. We
found 51 evolutionary conserved R. microplus miRNA loci, with 36 of these previously found in the tick Ixodes
scapularis. The majority of the R. microplus miRNAs are perfectly conserved throughout evolution with 11, 5 and 15
of these conserved since the Nephrozoan (640 MYA), Protostomian (620MYA) and Arthropoda (540 MYA) ancestor,
respectively. We then employed a de novo computational screening for novel tick miRNAs using the draft genome
of I. scapularis and genomic contigs of R. microplus as templates. This identified 36 novel R. microplus miRNA loci of
which 12 were conserved in I. scapularis. Overall we found 87 R. microplus miRNA loci, of these 15 showed the
expression of both miRNA and miRNA* sequences. R. microplus miRNAs showed a variety of expression profiles,
with the evolutionary-conserved miRNAs mainly expressed in all life stages at various levels, while the expression of
novel tick-specific miRNAs was mostly limited to particular life stages and/or tick organs.
Conclusions: Anciently acquired miRNAs in the R. microplus lineage not only tend to accumulate the least amount of
nucleotide substitutions as compared to those recently acquired miRNAs, but also show ubiquitous expression profiles
through out tick life stages and organs contrasting with the restricted expression profiles of novel tick-specific miRNAs.

Background
The Arthropods are a diverse group of organisms
including Chelicerata (ticks, spiders), Myriapoda (centipedes, millipedes), Crustacea (crabs, shrimps), and
Insecta (flies, beetles). Molecular estimates indicate that

be the most economically important tick parasite in the
world. R. microplus is a hard tick associated with cattle
infestations but can also occasionally be found on other
hosts including horses, goats, sheep, pigs and some wild
animals living in subtropical and tropical regions worldwide [2,3].

medical and veterinary importance. In comparison, I.
scapularis is a member of the prostriate lineage that
comprises the single genus Ixodes. The prostriate and
metastriate lineages differ markedly in many aspects of
their biology such as type of developmental cycle (i.e.,
three-versus one-host ticks), host range and vector competence. Comparative analyses between prostriate and
metastriate gene sets including miRNAs may reveal the
genetic basis for fundamental differences in the biology
of these tick lineages [4].
R. microplus is generally a single host tick spending all
parasitic life cycle stages on cattle. The eggs hatch in
the environment and the larvae crawl up grass or other
plants to find a host. In the summer, R. microplus can
survive for as long as 3 to 4 months without feeding. In
cooler temperatures, they may live without food for up
to six months. Newly attached seed ticks (larvae) are
usually found on the softer skin inside the thigh, flanks,
and forelegs. After feeding, the larvae molt twice, to
become nymphs and male or female adults. Each developmental stage (larval, nymph and adult) feeds only
once, but the feeding takes places over several days.
Adult male ticks become sexually mature after feeding,
and mate with feeding females. An adult female tick
that has fed and mated detaches from the host and
deposits a single batch of many eggs in the environment. Typically, these eggs are placed in crevices or
debris, or under stones. The female tick dies after ovipositing. Ticks in the subgenus Boophilus have a life cycle
that can be completed in 3 to 4 weeks; this characteristic can result in a heavy tick burden particularly on tick
susceptible cattle in tropical areas [2,3].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small 19–25 nucleotide
regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression in animals and plants [5]. They
are estimated to represent 1% of the transcriptome in
higher eukaryotes and predicted to control the expression of up to 30% of messenger RNAs [6,7]. Most miRNAs are encoded in intergenic regions and are
transcribed by RNA polymerase II as long primary
nuclear miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which range from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides in length [8]. One
pri-miRNA typically contains a single or several miRNA
precursors (pre-miRNAs) as stem-loop, hairpin structures flanked by unstructured, single stranded RNA
sequences [9]. Pre-miRNAs are cleaved near their loops
by the cytoplasmic RNase III enzyme Dicer to generate
a heteroduplex of two ~23-nt RNAs that are then
packed into the RISC complex [10]. Mature miRNA
sequences are encoded either in the 5’-arm or the 3’arm of pre-miRNAs. The decision as to which sequence
is incorporated into the silencing complex is influenced
by the difference in pairing stabilities between the two
ends of the miRNA:miRNA star (miRNA*) duplex, with

Page 2 of 17

preferential incorporation of the strand whose 5’end is
less stably paired [11,12]. In some cases both strands of
the miRNA:miRNA* duplex were found expressed at
similar levels [13]. About half of the miRNA genes in
Drosophila melanogaster are clustered and transcribed
from a single polycystronic pri-miRNA [14].
Recently, next generation sequencing technologies
have been utilized to profile and discover miRNAs genome-wide. To assist in this process it is normally
required to have a reference genome sequence. Currently, there is no reference genome sequence for R.
microplus, with the Ixodes scapularis genome draft
(IscaW1.1) the closest reference genome in which 37
miRNAs have been identified [15]. Some miRNAs are
highly conserved throughout evolution including let-7,
present in metazoan lineages such as arthropods and
vertebrates that diverged 641-686 MYA [16]. Thus, the
use of the D. melanogaster reference genome for which
152 miRNAs are currently annotated [15] may allow
not only the identification of highly conserved tick miRNAs, but also to discover arthropod-specific miRNAs.
Previous studies have shown that miRNAs are continuously being added to metazoan genomes through time,
and once these are integrated into gene regulatory networks, show only rare nucleotide substitutions within
the mature miRNA sequence at predictable positions
and are only rarely secondarily lost [17-19]. This is
likely related to the strong purifying selection against
changes in secondary structure of pre-miRNAs [20].
Wheeler and colleagues [21] documented evolutionary
stable shifts to the determination of position 1 of the
mature sequence that can be displaced towards either
the 5’ or 3’ end, a phenomenon called seed shifting, as
well as the ability to post-transcriptionally edit the 5’
end of the mature read, changing the identity of the
seed sequence and possibly the repertoire of downstream targets.
Currently there are no known microRNAs reported
for R. microplus and we aimed at the identification and
discovery of evolutionary conserved as well as novel
tick-specific miRNAs in R. microplus by using a combination of next generation high throughput sequencing,
comparative genomics and de novo computational
screening. We constructed eight small transcriptome
libraries derived from various cattle tick life stages and
from selected organs including gut, salivary glands and
ovaries. We aim to characterize changes in gene set and
expression levels of miRNAs at various tick life stages as
well as selected organs. We also conducted an
evolutionary analysis to identify subsets of R. microplus
miRNAs and miRNA* sequences that are perfectly
conserved since either the Nephrozoa (641-686 MYA),
Protostomia (618-653 MYA), Arthropoda (~540 MYA)
or Ixodidae (~241MYA) ancestor [1,16,21]. We also

unique to the R. microplus lineage.

Results and discussion
Identification of evolutionary conserved and cattle tickspecific miRNAs

Currently there are 37 known miRNAs in Ixodes scapularis, a species belonging to prostriate hard tick lineage
[15,21], but there are no known miRNAs identified for
R. microplus or other metastriate hard tick species. In
order to identify R. microplus miRNAs and expand the
repertoire of cattle tick miRNAs and to obtain insights
into changes in miRNA expression throughout the cattle
tick life stages and in selected adult female tick organs, a
high throughput sequencing approach was conducted.
This approach generated more than 35 million short
reads derived from the tick small RNA transcriptome
from eggs, unfed larvae, larvae exposed for six hours to
the host without being allowed to feed (frustrated larvae), and adult ticks as well as selected adult female tick
organs (Table 1). To identify tick miRNAs we anticipated that a fraction of the known Arthopoda miRNAs
should be conserved in both the Chelicerata (cattle
ticks) and Insecta lineages regardless of their estimated
divergence time of more than 500 MYA [16,21]. Under
this assumption, sequenced short reads from tick samples could be mapped onto the D. melanogaster genome
in order to identify identical or nearly identical conserved tick miRNAs. To be able to distinguish true
sequence polymorphisms from non-specific mapping
artefacts the performance of several short read aligners
were initially evaluated to define the tool that mapped
the largest amount of true positives and introduced a
limited amount of false positive aligned short reads. We
created simulated 36-bp short reads using mutation
rates from 0.1% to up to 16% (Additional file 1) containing both SNPs and/or insertion/deletions (indels) and

evaluated the ability of each tool to correctly align simulated short reads. Our results indicated that Novoalign
produced the best overall short read mapping performance (Additional file 2). Thus, we used this tool to
align the generated tick short reads onto the Drosophila
genome. To ensure reliable short read alignments base
quality scores were taken into account to conduct an
interative alignment approach aiming to identify the
best mapping position for each read. Novoalign generates a mapping quality score for each aligned read so
that ambiguously mapped short reads can be removed
from downstream analyses. Out of 35 million short
reads derived from various cattle tick life cycle stages
and three key organs, 3.5 million reads were aligned
onto known miRNA loci on the Drosophila genome
with at least a quality alignment score of Q = 1 (Table
1). We manually inspected the aligned reads onto
miRNA loci and removed non-specific alignments. To
identify possible duplicated R. microplus miRNAs all
reads mapped onto a single D. melanogaster miRNA
locus were inspected and if miRNA isoforms were
observed these were required to be cloned in at least
two distinct libraries to be validated. This approach
identified 46 R. microplus miRNAs including four duplicated copies for rmi-let-7 (a, f, m and n), and two duplicated copies for rmi-miR-219 and rmi-miR-285. In
addition we also detected the expression of 7 miRNA*
sequences, of these four have counterparts in D. melanogaster [15] (Additional file 3).
It has been recently reported that there has been gain
and loss of miRNA families in Arthropod lineages [21].
Thus some known miRNAs may have been lost in the
D. melanogaster genome but still be present in tick genomes. To evaluate this possibility and also to identify
novel tick-specific miRNAs we conducted a computational screening using MiRDeep as previously described
[22]. To screen for candidate miRNA loci we aligned

small RNA reads from each tick library onto both the I.
scapularis draft genome (IscaW1.1; 369,492 contigs) and
R. microplus draft genomic contigs that were recently
sequenced and assembled by our group (Bellgard et al.
unpublished data; 175,226 contigs encoding a total of
144,709,321 bp). This identified candidate pre-miRNA
sequences that were further screened against nucleotide
databases and those having similarity to known coding/
non-coding genes were excluded. Furthermore, short
reads from all libraries were then aligned onto remaining pre-miRNA candidates and those not having typical
miRNA alignments were removed [23]. This analysis
identified 44 and 25 miRNAs in I. scapularis and R.
microplus genomic contigs, respectively. We next
screened the identified miRNAs against all annotated
miRNAs [15] and determined that 32 and 1 (rmi-miR190) miRNA in I. scapularis and R. microplus, respectively, had counterparts in other species. In addition the
expression of three miRNA* sequences were detected
(Additional file 3A). As anticipated this approach identified five (rmi-miR-71, rmi-miR-96, rmi-miR-153, rmimiR-745b and rmi-miR-2001) evolutionary conserved
miRNAs in R. microplus that were lost in the D. melanogaster genome. Overall we identified 51 miRNAs in R.
microplus that have counterparts in other species. Out
of the 51 evolutionary conserved R. microplus miRNAs
we also detected the expression of 11 miRNA*
sequences (Additional file 3A). MiRNA* sequences have
been implicated in modifying mature miRNA and
3’UTR evolution in flies [24]. Thus, these species along
with the mature tick miRNAs will facilitate the understanding of changes in gene regulatory networks during
R. microplus life stages and in vital organs.
In the above analysis, we also identified 36 novel R.
microplus miRNAs and of these 12 were conserved in
the I. scapularis genome (Additional file 3B). Examples
of pre-miRNAs of novel tick-specific miRNAs showing
typical drosha-processed features including localization
of mature miRNA within few nucleotides of the loop
[25] are shown in Figure 1. Interestingly we detected the
expression of miRNA* sequences in four novel tick premiRNAs common to both R. microplus and I. scapularis
(Additional file 3B and Figure 1). To determine if the 36
identified novel R. microplus miRNAs are restricted to
cattle tick, we aligned mature miRNA and pre-miRNAs
sequences onto the genomes of Anopheles gambiae,
Apis mellifera, Aedes aegypti, Tribolium castaneum,
Nasonia vitripennis, Pediculus humanus, Culex quinquefasciatus and nine Drosophila genomes (Additional file
4). The mapping coordinates of aligned reads were then
used to retrieve genomic segments to evaluate for typical pre-miRNA structures. None of the 36 novel R.
microplus miRNAs were found conserved in the 16
tested genomes suggesting that these may represent

miRNAs. Examples of precursor miRNA sequences for novel tickspecific miRNAs are shown. The mature sequences and miRNA*
sequences are highlighted in black and red bold fonts, respectively.

tick-specific miRNAs. The genome size of the cattle tick
R. microplus is three times larger than that of I. scapularis, thus we anticipate that other novel R. microplus
miRNAs are likely to be identified once the complete
genome becomes available.
Overall, we identified 87 R. microplus miRNAs with 72
of these expressed during various cattle tick life stages
and 67 in selected adult female tick organs (Figure 2A
and Additional file 3). We found 52 mature miRNAs
expressed in both the life stage and tick organ samples
with the majority of these (44; 84.6%) corresponding to
evolutionary conserved miRNAs (Figure 2A). In contrast, the majority of the 20 life stage-and 15 organ-specific miRNAs corresponded to novel cattle tick-specific
miRNAs suggesting that these miRNAs play unique
roles at specific life stages and key tick organs. A recent
study suggested that miRNA invention is closely related
to the evolution of tissue identities in bilaterian species
[26]. Further investigation is required to determine if
novel tick-specific miRNAs contribute to the implementation of biological features unique to tick species.
Similar to what has been observed in other species we
found miRNAs that show expression from both arms of
the pre-miRNA. In cattle ticks we observed co-expression of 15 mature and complementary star sequences
including rmi-miR-10, rmi-miR-71, rmi-miR-993 and
rmi-miR-5308 that are expressed in all cattle tick life
stages evaluated in this study (Table 2). Co-expression
of rmi-miR-153 and rmi-miR-5314 mature and star
sequences was restricted to larval stages while rmi-miRiab-5p was only detected in adult ticks. These miRNA*
sequences were highly conserved between R. microplus
and I. scapularis despite their estimated divergence of
241 ± 28 MYA [1] indicating that these sequences in
these species are under selective pressure to avoid
nucleotide changes. Interestingly rmi-miR-79*, rmi-miR281* and rmi-miR-993* are expressed at significantly

higher levels than their mature counterparts suggesting
that some of the currently annotated mature miRNAs in
reference databases may correspond to miRNA*
sequences or in some lineages like R. microplus miRNA*
sequences become the primary transcript from the
miRNA/miRNA* duplex.

Unique and commonly expressed miRNAs among life stages. Values in

To evaluate global changes in miRNA expression during
R. microplus life stages, short read counts overlapping
the 87 miRNAs and 15 miRNA* sequences were normalized as reads per million and compared against the
overall expression found in eggs. Our results indicate
that in the transition from egg to larval stages there is
nearly a 90-fold increase in miRNA transcripts (Figure
2B). Interestingly, larvae exposed to the host for six
hours showed a significant reduction in the accumulation of miRNA transcripts as compared to unexposed
larvae. The largest accumulation of miRNA transcripts
was found in female adults, showing 2.7-fold higher
level than males. We also compared changes in expression between evolutionary conserved and tick-specific
(unique) miRNAs. Evolutionary conserved R. microplus
miRNAs are significantly more highly expressed as
compared to the identified novel tick-specific miRNAs
(Figure 2C), only during larval stages there was an increment in the expression of tick-specific miRNAs. Overall
in the life stage samples, we identified 72 R. microplus
miRNAs, of these 37, 63 and 61 miRNAs were
expressed in egg, larval and adult stages, respectively
(Figure 2D). Interestingly, 32 (44.5%) of the identified
miRNAs were expressed in all cattle tick life stages with
31 of these evolutionary conserved in a range of species
and only one rmi-miR-5308 unique to tick species. In
contrast most of the stage-specific miRNAs corresponded to novel tick-specific miRNAs. These findings
suggest that evolutionary conserved miRNAs play a ubiquitous role through out cattle tick life stages, while
most novel tick-unique miRNAs are restricted to specific life stages.
We next evaluated the percentage fraction of expression of each miRNA in each sample. In eggs there are
five abundantly expressed miRNAs including rmi-miR-1,
rmi-miR-310/miR-92, rmi-miR-279, rmi-miR-275 and
rmi-miR-71 that accounted for 80.6% of the total
amount of miRNA transcripts (Figure 3A and Additional file 3), while in all other life stages miR-1 was the
most abundantly expressed miRNA (Figure 3). Among
the top ten most abundant miRNAs in eggs we found
two novel cattle tick-specific miRNAs, rmi-miR-5316b
and rmi-miR-5331, that accounted for 4.3% and 3.1% of
miRNA transcripts, respectively (Figure 3A). These
novel miRNAs were only expressed at statistically

significant levels (P < 9.62E-06) during the egg stage
(Additional file 5) suggesting they play critical roles during this stage.
Although rmi-miR-1 is the most abundantly expressed
miRNA in cattle tick larvae (Figure 3B), we found eight
other miRNAs, including rmi-miR-133, rmi-miR-87,
rmi-miR-10, and rmi-miR-252, that had a higher foldchange ratio in miRNA transcript levels as compared to
that in eggs suggesting that these miRNAs may play a
role during larval development (Table 3 and Additional
file 6). We also found two novel tick-specific miRNAs,
rmi-miR-3931 and rmi-miR-5308, among the top ten
expressed larval miRNAs representing 2.7% and 1.2% of
the miRNA transcripts (Figure 3B). Interestingly, in Drosophila miR-10 is encoded within the HOX cluster
downstream of its target Sex combs reduced (Scr), which
is a gene required for proper embryo and adult development in flies [27,28]. It has also been reported that the
miR-10 binding site in the Src 3’UTR is conserved
across a large number of arthropod species, some with
an estimated divergence time of over hundreds of millions years [28].
Similar to the observation in larval stages, rmi-miR-1
was vastly abundant in adult ticks accounting for 87.4%
and 86.2% of miRNA transcripts in females and males,
respectively (Figure 3C and 3D). The second most abundant miRNA in adult ticks is rmi-let-7a, a miRNA
known to be involved in the transition from late larval
to adult stage in worms [29]. It remains to be elucidated
if rmi-let-7a is also expressed during tick nymph stage
associated with the transition to adult fate. In contrast
to egg and larval stages, no novel tick-specific miRNAs
were observed among the top ten most abundant

miRNAs in adult ticks. These findings suggest that
novel tick-specific miRNAs may play key roles during
early embryo and larval development stages.
The relative changes in expression of 27 miRNAs and
3 miRNA* expressed in all life stages tested in R. microplus are shown in Figure 3E. Interestingly let-7, miR-100
and miR-125 are known to be clustered in the same
genomic location in the D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
genomes within 1 kb and 4.5 kb, respectively [30]. In
general it is accepted that clustered miRNAs are likely
to share highly correlated expression profiles if these are
within 50 kb of each other [31]. Our results show that
these three miRNAs present similar expression trends
(Figure 3E) suggesting that rmi-let-7a, rmi-miR-100 and
rmi-miR-125 may also collocate to the same genomic
region in the R. microplus genome. To validate the
observed miRNA expression profiles we conducted real
time PCR amplification of five randomly selected miRNAs that showed perfect sequence conservation between
ticks and flies. These included rmi-let-7a, rmi-miR-1,
rmi-miR-7, rmi-miR-12, and rmi-miR-124. As controls
we selected U14 and snoRNA-442 non-coding RNAs,
which are reference genes used in Drosophila studies
(Ambion, Applied Biosystems), but none of these were
either expressed or conserved in cattle ticks. We then
normalized the relative expression of all miRNAs in
eggs, frustrated larvae and female ticks against the
expression of rmi-let-7 in female ticks (Additional file
7). Our results validated the abundant expression of
rmi-miR-1 in eggs, frustrated larvae and female samples.
We also verified that rmi-let-7 is highly expressed in
female ticks as compared to eggs or frustrated larvae
samples (Additional file 5). Overall we observed a good

agreement between the trends observed in real time
PCR quantification and high throughput small RNA
sequencing.
Host-odour recognition triggers changes in tick miRNA
expression

R. microplus normally parasitizes a single host and it is
believed this host specificity depends on the specific
detection of bovine phenolic compounds [32]. To evaluate if host odour recognition by ticks may trigger
changes in miRNA expression we exposed tick larvae to
its host for six hours without allowing the larvae to feed
(frustrated larvae), and then we collected small RNA
samples for high throughput sequencing. We found 57
miRNA expressed in frustrated larvae, of these 54 were
also expressed in unexposed larvae (Additional file 3).
There were six miRNAs expressed in unexposed larvae
that were not detected in frustrated larvae, particularly
rmi-miR-5315 that showed a significant lost in expression (Table 4 and Additional file 8). Only rmi-miR-31a,
rmi-miR-285a and rmi-miR-5329 were specifically
detected in frustrated larvae, but none of these had significant expression levels (P < 9.62E-05) (Additional
file 8). The major difference in miRNA expression
found in frustrated larvae, as compared to un-exposed
larvae, is the down-and up-regulation of 26 and 23 miRNAs, respectively (P < 9.62E-05) (Additional file 8).
Among the most down regulated miRNAs in frustrated
larvae are rmi-miR-317, rmi-miR-315, rmi-miR-33, rmimiR-87 and five tick-specific novel miRNAs including
rmi-miR-5306, rmi-miR-5309, rmi-miR-5310, rmi-miR5312 and rmi-miR-5314 (Table 4 and Additional file 8).
Other significantly up-regulated miRNAs in frustrated
larvae compared to unexposed larvae are rmi-miR-279,

rmi-miR-190, rmi-miR-79*, rmi-miR-96, rmi-miR-5307
and rmi-miR-5308 (P < 9.62E-05) (Table 4 and Additional file 8). The identification of novel tick-specific
miRNAs showing up and down-regulation upon exposure to the host make these molecules attractive candidates for further host-recognition functional studies.
Changes in miRNA expression between female
and male adult ticks

There are significant morphological and behavioural differences between female and male ticks. To evaluate
whether there are gender differences in the expression
of miRNAs we inspected changes in the miRNA transcriptome between female and male adult ticks. We
found 55 miRNAs expressed in adult cattle ticks, of
these 46 were expressed in both females and males. We
found two miRNAs, rmi-miR-5334 and rmi-miR-5336,
specifically expressed in male ticks, while another seven
miRNAs were detected in female ticks with four of
these also expressed in larval stages (Figure 2D). The
three miRNAs uniquely expressed in females were rmimiR-307, rmi-miR-5317a and rmi-miR-5318, which were
expressed at low levels (Additional file 9). Among the
miRNAs expressed in both females and males, 22 were
up regulated in females (P < 9.62E-05) including the let7-complex miRNAs rmi-let-7a, rmi-miR-100 and rmi-

miR-125 (let-C miRNAs) (Table 5 and Additional file 9).
Although similar levels of up regulation of the former
two miRNAs in females were observed, rmi-miR-100
showed an expression level similar to that in males. Differential accumulation of these let-7-C miRNAs, which
were shown to co-transcribe as a single polycistronic
primary transcript [33], may be due to post-transcriptional processing of mature miRNAs from primary transcripts undergoing developmental regulation [34-36].
Interestingly, loss of function of let-7 in Drosophila specifically affects female reproduction, while males retain
fertility levels comparable to that in wild type flies [33].
It remains to be elucidated if the observed up regulation
of rmi-let-7a in female ticks is required for maintaining
both normal fertility and oviposition [33].
In male ticks we found 9 miRNAs up regulated in comparison to female ticks (P < 9.62E-05) including rmimiR-133, rmi-miR-bantam, rmi-miR-279 and rmi-miR310/miR-92 (Table 5 and Additional file 9). It is intriguing to observe the up regulation of two known antiapoptotic miRNAs, rmi-miR-bantam and rmi-miR-133
in adult males [37,38]. MiR-133 and miR-1 are preferentially expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles in Xenopus laevis [39] both have opposing effects, with miR-1
being rather pro-apoptotic [38]. Interestingly, miR-1
level was shown to significantly increase in response to
oxidative stress [38]. In ticks blood digestion has been
suggested to be a source of oxidative stress [40,41]. This
is particularly relevant for female ticks that ingest large
volumes of blood (about 100-fold their own weight) in

preparation for the laying of about 2,000 to 3,000 eggs
[42], while males rarely feed on blood [43]. Interestingly,
apoptosis of salivary glands prior to oviposition in
female ticks was reported for Dermacentor variabilis
[44] and R. microplus [45]. Surprisingly R. microplus
female ticks presented apoptosis just after 24 hours of
host detachment [45] contrasting with the 5 days
required for D. variabilis female ticks [44]. These observations suggest that in R. microplus molecular changes
are likely to occur prior to female detachment from the
host that predispose them for a rapid onset of apoptosis
and consequently facilitating egg laying. This notion
correlates with the observed significant up regulation of
rmi-miR-1 in semi-engorged females as compared to
males (Table 5). It remains to be elucidated if bloodmediated oxidative stress in R. microplus contributes to
the increased expression level of rmi-miR-1 in females
and if this miRNA exercise pro-apoptotic activities similar to its X. laevis miR-1 counterpart [38] that would
ultimately facilitate egg laying.
microRNA expression in selected tick organs

Primary target organs for cattle tick control are the gut,
salivary glands and ovaries of adult female ticks. Nearly
13.3 million short reads were generated for these three
organs, of these 790,821 and 5,759 short reads were
mapped onto evolutionary conserved and novel tick-specific miRNA loci, respectively (Table 1B). To compare
global miRNA expression levels between these samples
we normalized all mapped miRNA transcripts in each
sample as reads per million. The tick gut sample showed
2-fold and 5-fold higher relative amount of miRNA
transcripts as compared to salivary glands and ovaries
samples, respectively (Additional file 10A). These differences were due to the larger amount of transcripts
mapped onto evolutionary conserved miRNA loci in the
gut sample as compared to salivary gland and ovary
samples (Additional file 10A). We found 68 miRNAs
expressed in all tested tick organs with 50 (6 novel), 50
(9 novel) and 49 (13 novel) expressed in gut, salivary
glands and ovaries, respectively (Additional file 10B). A
comparison of R. microplus miRNAs found in female
tick organs with those found in whole semi engorged
adult females revealed that 36 miRNAs were commonly
expressed in all samples (Additional file 10B). Interestingly the majority of the commonly expressed R. microplus miRNAs (94.6%) in tick organs corresponded to
known miRNAs in other species, while 18 of the 20
organ-specifically expressed miRNAs found in this study
correspond to novel tick-specific miRNAs (Additional
file 10C). Most of the novel tick specific miRNAs were
expressed at low levels except for rmi-miR-5307 found
in all three organs and rmi-miR-3931 present in adult
female tick ovaries (Additional file 11).

Barrero et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:328
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/328

Similar to what we observed for life stage samples,
rmi-miR-1 was the most abundantly expressed miRNA
in all sampled organs accounting for ~81-83% of the
identified R. microplus miRNA transcripts in ovaries and
gut, and for 43.1% of the miRNA transcripts in salivary
glands (Additional file 11). Other highly expressed miRNAs in salivary glands are rmi-let-7a (15.1%), rmi-miR275 (10.5%), rmi-miR-263a (5.0%) and rmi-miR-71
(4.2%) (Additional file 11). Recently, two studies have
reported the secretion of miRNAs into the saliva
[46,47]. Interestingly, among the most abundantly
expressed R. microplus miRNAs in salivary glands, only
let-7 orthologs were found expressed in human salivary
glands [46,47]. The expression of let-7 in the salivary
glands of ticks and vertebrates suggests a functional role
for this miRNA throughout the evolution of this organ.
Global comparison of miRNA expression in cattle ticks

To evaluate similarities in the global tick miRNA
expression pattern among all samples we conducted a
hierarchical clustering as described by Eisen et al. [48]
and found that there is low miRNA diversity in eggs,
while larvae and female ticks samples showed a large
diversity of expressed miRNAs (Figure 4). Adult female
tick salivary glands and gut samples clustered together
with adult tick samples showing high expression of various miRNAs, but also having unique signatures owing
to the presence of tissue-specific miRNAs. Interestingly
most of the identified R. microplus miRNAs with known
counterpart in other species showed high expression
levels in most tick life cycle stages and tick organs,
while the identified novel tick-specific miRNAs presented more restricted expression patterns accounting
for the majority of the tick life stage-specific and tissuespecific R. microplus miRNAs.
D. melanogaster has 151 annotated miRNAs [15], of
these 61 miRNAs are closely located (= < 2 kb) in 17
genomic clusters (Additional file 12). We found tick miRNAs overlapping five of these clusters, including the miR100:miR-125:let-7, miR-275:miR-305, miR-2a-2:miR-2a1:miR-2b-2, and miR-310:miR-311:miR-312:miR-313:
miR-991:miR-992 clusters (Additional file 12). To infer if
these clusters may also be conserved in the cattle tick
genome we analysed the co-expression pattern of tick
miRNAs across all samples. We observed correlated coexpression profiles of tick miRNAs overlapping two D.
melanogaster clusters, miR-100:miR-125:let-7 and miR275:miR-305 indicating that these clusters may also be
conserved in the cattle tick genome (Additional file 12).
Evolutionary conservation of R. microplus miRNAs

We conducted an evolutionary analysis to determine if
miRNAs found in R. microplus were perfectly conserved
or accumulated nucleotide changes since the last

Page 10 of 17

common available ancestor (See Methods). We collected
all available miRNAs [15] and for those overlapping the
identified R. microplus miRNAs we determined the
ancestral sequences using a Maximum Likelihood
approach [49,50] under the Junkes-Cantor model [51]
using a tree topology similar to that shown in Figure 5A
(modified from [21]). We found that 73% of the R.
microplus miRNAs were perfectly conserved since at
least 241 MYA with 11, 5, 15 and 6 miRNAs conserved
since the Nephrozoan, Protostomian, Arthropoda and
Ixodidae ancestor, respectively (Figure 5B). Only 27% of
the R. microplus miRNAs presented nucleotide substitutions unique to the R. microplus lineage. These unique
miRNAs can be further divided into three groups: 1)
unique miRNA variants in R. microplus for which a protostomian ancestral sequence is available (Rmi-I), 2)
duplicated copies of R. microplus miRNAs (Rmi-II), and
3) unique R. microplus miRNAs for which an ancestral
sequence is not available and only ortholog sequences in
the insecta lineage are known (Additional file 13).
We next examined the number of nucleotide substitutions found in each of the above subsets of R. microplus
miRNAs by comparing against an ancestral sequence if
it can be unambiguously determined (i.e. a R. microplus
miRNA perfectly conserved since the Arthropoda ancestor was compared against the Protostomian ancestral
miRNA sequence or an earlier ancestral sequence if
available). In cases where no ancestral sequences are
available owing to the gain of that miRNA in a more
recent ancestor the number of base substitutions was
recorded as zero (i.e. a miRNA that was gained in the
Arthropoda ancestor and since then have not accumulated nucleotide substitutions in R. microplus). The average number of nucleotide substitutions was then
calculated for each subset. We determined 0, 0.25, 0.8
and 1.0 average nucleotide changes for R. microplus
miRNAs conserved since the Nephrozoan (Rmi-NA),
Protostomian (Rmi-PA), Arthropoda (Rmi-AA) and Ixodiade (Rmi-IA) ancestor, respectively (Figure 5C).
Furthermore we found 2.2 and 1.3 average nucleotide
changes in R. microplus miRNA unique variants (Rmi-I)
and duplicated miRNAs (Rmi-II) (Figure 5C). Interestingly the average number of nucleotide substitution in
miRNAs was directly proportional to the evolutionary
time of the ancestor where the oldest conserved miRNAs showed the least amount of nucleotide changes
while more recently acquired miRNAs showed slightly
increased number of nucleotide changes. Recently, gain
of miRNA genes in Metazoan species was suggested to
be associated with the increase in morphological complexity [21]. Our findings correlate with the notion that
perfectly conserved miRNAs since for example the
Nephrozoan ancestor may regulate key basic processes
common to a range of animal species and therefore be

under stronger selective pressure to remain unchanged
throughout the evolution, while those miRNAs more
recently acquired or perfectly conserved since a more
recent ancestor such the Arthropoda ancestor may play
more specific roles for these species.
We further interrogated the position of the nucleotide substitutions for each of the above subsets as
compared to an ancestral sequence and found no base
substitutions overlapping the mature miRNA seed
(positions 2-8) in all the identified R. microplus miRNAs (Figure 6A). R. microplus miRNAs conserved
since the Protostomian, Arthropoda and Ixodidae
ancestor preferentially accumulated nucleotide changes
in the 3’ end of the mature miRNAs (Figure 6A and
Additional file 12). MiRNAs that are unique variants
to R. microplus particularly those that have a reference
Protostomian ancestral sequence or are duplicated
miRNAs showed base substitutions in the middle
(positions 9 to 12) and 3’end (positions 17 to 23) (Figure 6B). Only unique miRNAs variants without a reference ancestral sequence but with ortholog genes in
insecta (Rmi-III) showed an apparent uniform distribution of nucleotide changes from position 9 to 23, but
this is likely due to independent accumulated nucleotide substitution in the chelicerata and insecta lineages
since the last common Arthropoda ancestor. We also
observed that D. melanogaster and A. gambie tend to
have an increased number of base substitutions as

compared to R. microplus (Additional file 13 and data
not shown).
To determine if similar biases in nucleotide substitutions are observed in miRNA* sequences we evaluated
nucleotide changes in seven miRNA* (rmi-miR-10*, rmimiR-281*, rmi-miR-307*, rmi-miR-71*, rmi-miR-8*, rmimiR-993*, rmi-miR-iab-4-3p) for which ortholog
sequences are available among insecta species or in Lottia gigantea (Mollusca) for miR-281*. Figure 6C shows
that most miRNA* sequences accumulated preferential
base substitutions in position 1, in the middle (positions
9 to 12) and the 3’end. Only rmi-miR-iab-4-3p accumulated base substitutions preferentially towards the 5’end,
but these nucleotide changes are compensatory mutations to those found in the mature rmi-miR-iab-4-5p
sequence (Additional file 13) to maintain a proper premiRNA structure (data not shown). Based in our results
it is apparent that miRNA* sequences have similar selective pressure to that of mature sequences to avoid base

Barrero et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:328
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/328

substitutions in the ‘miRNA* seed’ sequence (positions
2-8) despite this region being complementary to the
3’end portion of the mature miRNA where most base
substitutions are accumulated. These findings suggest
that R. microplus miRNA* sequences may play regulatory roles similar to their mature counterparts and this
view is further supported by the significantly higher
expression level of rmi-miR-79*, rmi-miR-281* and rmimiR-993* as compared to their mature miRNA complementary sequences (Additional file 3).
Seed shifting of R. microplus miRNAs

The displacement of the miRNA seed (positions 2-8)
towards either the 5’ or 3’ is referred as ‘seed shifting’
[21]. As shown in Additional file 13 we found three R.
microplus miRNAs showing one-nucleotide seed shifting
with two of these (rmi-miR-79 and rmi-miR-137) and a
third miRNA (rmi-miR-iab-4-5p) displacing the seed
towards the 3’ and 5’, respectively. Interestingly seed
shifting in miR-79 was not observed in the sister taxon
I. scapularis nor the crustacean Daphnia pulex with
which rmi-miR-79 shares perfect sequence identity. Seed
shifting of miR-79 was also found in Capitella teleta
(Annelida) and insecta species, but not in their sister
taxon, namely, Mollusca and Crustacea, respectively.
These findings suggest that miR-79 underwent three
independent seed shifting events of one-base displacement towards the 3’ end in R. microplus, C. teleta and
insecta ancestor lineages. We also found two independent seed shifting events for miR-137 one in R. microplus and another among insecta species (A. mellifera
and T. castaneum) but not in their sister taxon Daphnia
pulex (Additional file 13). The observed consistency in
the seed shifting direction in independent events suggests that this phenomenon may be under selective
pressure.
In our data only rmi-miR-iab-4-5p represents an
example of seed shifting unique to the R. microplus lineage, but this miRNA is an exceptional example as both
mature and star sequences have also accumulated a
large number of base substitutions (Additional file 13).
Despite the observed seed shifting and nucleotide substitutions changes the expression level of the mature rmimiR-iab-4-5p is 5.2-fold higher than that of rmi-miRiab-4-3p, which is consistent with the 5.4-fold higher
expression level of dme-miR-iab-4-5p as compared to
dme-miR-4-3p [15]. These findings suggest that despite
the various molecular changes that can take place in a
miRNA-miRNA* duplex, the expression ratio at which
these molecules are found expressed in distinct taxa
remains unchanged reflecting that other mechanisms
may regulate the dosage at which each molecule is present to properly control downstream targets.

Conclusions
This study has identified 87 R. microplus miRNAs being
51 of these known in other species including 36 in I.
scapularis. Overall we found 72 rmi-miRNAs expressed
in various cattle tick life stages and 67 rmi-miRNAs
expressed in the adult female tick gut, salivary glands
and ovaries. Novel tick-specific miRNAs account for the
majority of the life-stage and organ-specific expression
profiles found in R. microplus miRNAs and represent
attractive targets for further functional studies. We provide insights into the evolutionary conservation of R.
microplus miRNAs revealing that the majority of
anciently acquired miRNAs remain perfectly conserved,
while more recently acquired miRNAs tend to accumulate more nucleotide substitutions in the middle and 3’
portion of mature miRNA and miRNA* sequences. Our
findings correlates with the notion that long-lived miRNAs are likely to play crucial roles in a wide range of
animal species, probably closely related to the acquisition of new organ identities and higher complexity, and
therefore be under a stronger selective pressure to
remain unchanged as compared to more recently
acquired miRNAs.
Methods
Tick sampling

The ticks used in this study were obtained from the tick
colony (Non-Resistant Field Strain–NRFS) maintained at
the Animal Research Institute (Qld Primary Industries
& Fisheries), Yeerongpilly, Queensland [52]. Semiengorged 17-day-old females for the dissections were
collected in sterile 5 mL screw top containers (Nalgene,
Rochester, NY, U.S.A.) and transferred to the laboratory.
Dissections were carried out within the hour after collection. Prior to dissection, the ticks were rinsed with
0.1% DEPC-treated water. Semi-engorged females were
fixed on double-sided adhesive tape inside an 8 cm culture dish placed on ice and covered with a few drops of
ice-cold sterile PBS. An incision was made with a sterile
razor blade just above the right spiracle, starting at the
right side of the capitulum and ending the cut at the
left side of the capitulum. The dorsal cuticle was then
lifted with a pair of dissection tweezers. The salivary
gland, midgut and ovary were then removed and homogenized by freezing in liquid nitrogen and ground to
powder using sterile RNase ZAP-treated (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) mortars and pestles. Whole R.
microplus females (17 days old, n = 10) and males (17
days old, n = 10) collected from the under-side of semiengorged females were also processed for miRNA
extraction. After rinsing in DEPC-treated water, the
adult ticks were frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently crushed and ground to powder using a sterile

Barrero et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:328
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/328

mortar and pestle. Approximately 2 g of NRFS strain
larvae incubated for 21 days in 1 g batches were
obtained for miRNA extractions. One batch of larvae
were exposed to the host for 6 hours in a mesh bag
attached to the host inside a collar without being able
to establish feeding (frustrated larvae). Eggs were also
collected into sterile tubes up to 7 days after laying by
fully-engorged females. Both larval samples were homogenized by freezing in liquid nitrogen and ground to
powder using sterile mortar and pestle. Total RNA and/
or enriched small RNA fraction was isolated from the
whole adult ticks (male and female 17 days old), larvae,
frustrated larvae, eggs and dissected female tick organs
using the mirVana microRNA isolation kit as described
in the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Applied
Biosystems).
RNA isolation

Total RNA or enriched small RNA fractions were prepared from eggs, larvae (unfed and frustrated), adult
male and adult female as well as from adult female gut,
salivary glands and ovaries. All these samples were
ground in liquid nitrogen using a sterile mortar and pestle, and then the RNA was isolated using the mirVana
microRNA isolation kit according to manufacture’s
instructions (Ambion, Applied Biosystems). RNA samples for each condition were collected in triplicate (each
as a pool of individuals) and these were kept at -80°C
until deep sequencing or real time PCR analysis as
described below.
Small RNA library construction and sequencing

For small RNA library construction and deep sequencing, RNA samples were prepared as follows: for each
life cycle stage or tick organ equal quantities (5-7 μg) of
enriched small RNA fraction or total RNA isolated from
three independent pools as described above were
pooled. Approximately 10 μg of enriched small RNA
fraction or 20 μg of total RNA representing each life
stage or a tick organ were submitted to Illumina/Solexa
service provider (GeneWorks, Australia) for sequencing.
In brief, the sequencing was performed as follows:
RNA was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE), to enrich for molecules in the range of 18–30
nt, and ligated with proprietary adapters to the 5’ and
3’-end termini of the RNA. The samples were used as
templates for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was amplified
with 18 PCR cycles to produce sequencing libraries that
were subjected to Illumina/Solexa’s proprietary sequencing-by-synthesis method.
Real time PCR amplification

Tick miRNAs identically conserved in D. melanogaster
including let-7, miR-1, miR-7, miR-12 and miR-124

were selected and TaqMan miRNA assays against these
miRNAs were purchased from Applied Biosystems. A
total of 10 ng of enriched small RNA fraction for each
individual eggs, larvae and female tick samples was used
to amplify the miRNAs for up to 50 cycles in a RotoGene 3000 termal cycler.
Bioinformatics data analysis

Several short read aligners including Maq [53], SOAP
[54], RMAP [55], Novoalign http://www.novocraft.com,
Bowtie [56] and BWA [57] were selected to evaluate their
mapping performance using simulated short reads. 36-bp
simulated short reads were generated using MAQ-simulate with mutation rates of 0.1% to up to 16.0%, and
introducing read errors using the file simdata/simupar.
dat file from the MAQ data installation [53]. Using
default parameters of each tool simulated short reads
were mapped onto the human and/or the Arabidopsis
genomes (Additional file 2). As the originating position
of the simulated reads are known the fraction of true
positive aligned reads was calculated as [Number of correctly aligned reads/Total number of simulated reads].
Conversely we can also calculate the proportion of false
positive aligned reads as [Number of incorrectly aligned
reads/Total number of simulated reads]. Based on our
results (Additional file 3) we selected Novoalign for aligning our sequenced cattle tick short reads onto the D. melanogaster genome using its default parameters http://
www.novocraft.com. The D. melanogaster (dme_r5.32)
genome was downloaded from FlyBase http://flybase.org.
We removed short reads mapped with quality alignment
scores of zero (Q0), which correspond to reads mapped
to two or more locations on the reference genome with
identical quality alignment scores. We then conducted a
manual inspection of the short reads overlapping known
Drosophila miRNA loci to confirm the accuracy and
sequence conservation of tick miRNAs aligned onto the
Drosophila genome.
To identify novel miRNAs we aligned cattle tick short
reads from each sample onto the draft genome of Ixodes
scapularis (IscaW1.1; 369,459 contigs) and R. microplus
draft genomic contigs that were recently sequenced and
assembled by our group (Bellgard et al. submitted; 175,226
contigs encoding a total of 144,709,321 bp). We then utilized MiRDeep to identify known and novel miRNA candidates as previously described [58]. The identified miRNAs
were then compared against 37 known I. scapularis miRNAs (miRBase rel. 17.0); matching hits were removed from
the novel miRNA candidate dataset. The remaining candidate miRNAs were then subjected to clustering analysis
with other known insect miRNAs using MEGA5 [51]. Candidate novel miRNAs with significant similarity to other
known miRNAs were removed from the downstream analysis. To assess the conservation of novel miRNAs in other

Barrero et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:328

genomes we downloaded from VectorBase http://www.vectorbase.org the genomes of Anopheles gambiae (AgamP3),
Aedes aegypti (AaegL1), Pediculus humanus (PhumU1)
and Culex quinquefasciatus (CpipJ1). The Nasonia vitripennis (Nvit_2.0) genome was downloaded from the
Nasoria Genome Project http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu.
We downloaded from UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
resource http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu the following genomes: Drosophila pseudoobscura (dp4), D. ananassae
(droAna3), D. erecta (droEre2), D. grimshawi (droGri2), D.
mojavensis (droMoj3), D. virilis (droVir3), D. willistoni
(droWil1), D. yakuba (droYak2), Tribolium castaneum
(Tcas 2.0) and Apis mellifera (Amel_4.0). Novel R. microplus miRNA mature and star sequences were then aligned
onto all the above genomes using Bowtie [56] and BLAT
[59]. Positive hits were further inspected for typical precursor miRNA secondary structure using RNAfold [60].
Statistical analysis

Statistically significant changes in miRNA expression
between samples was calculated using four statistical
tests including Pairwise Audic & Claverie test (AC),
Pairwise Chi sq. test (Chi2 × 2) and Multiple Chi sq.
test (Chi) as previously described by Romualdi et al.
[61]. Bonferroni correction was applied to the data and
significant thresholds of 9.62E-05 or 9.62E-06 were
defined depending on the comparisons.
Evolutionary analysis

We conducted an evolutionary analysis to determine if
miRNAs found in R. microplus were perfectly conserved
or accumulated nucleotide changes since the last common ancestor based on available sequences for each
miRNA (miRBase release 17). Multiple sequence alignments for each miRNA were generated using ClustalW
[62] within the MEGA5 package [51]. Ancestral
sequences were determined using a Maximum Likelihood method [49,50] under the Junkes-Cantor model
[63] using a tree topology similar to that shown in Figure 5A (modified from [21]). We then compared each R.
microplus miRNA sequence against the respective
inferred ancestral sequence (Additional file 13) and
determined if each R. microplus miRNA was perfectly
conserved since the Nephrozoan, Protostomian, Arthropoda or Ixodidae ancestor or if it represented a unique
nucleotide variant in the R. microplus lineage (Figure 5A
and 5B). This resulted in a classification of each miRNA
into one of the following categories: 1) conserved since
Nephrozoan ancestor (Rmi-NA), 2) conserved since Protostomian ancestor (Rmi-PA), 3) conserved since
Arthropoda ancestor (Rmi-AA), 4) conserved since Ixodidae ancestor (Rmi-IA), or 5) unique variant to R.
microplus (Rmi-unique).
