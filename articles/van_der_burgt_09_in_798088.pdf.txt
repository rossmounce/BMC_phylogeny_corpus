Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short ~21-nucleotide RNA molecules, play an important
role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The number of known miRNA hairpins
registered in the miRBase database is rapidly increasing, but recent reports suggest that many
miRNAs with restricted temporal or tissue-specific expression remain undiscovered. Various
strategies for in silico miRNA identification have been proposed to facilitate miRNA discovery.
Notably support vector machine (SVM) methods have recently gained popularity. However, a
drawback of these methods is that they do not provide insight into the biological properties of
miRNA sequences.
Results: We here propose a new strategy for miRNA hairpin prediction in which the likelihood
that a genomic hairpin is a true miRNA hairpin is evaluated based on statistical distributions of
observed biological variation of properties (descriptors) of known miRNA hairpins. These
distributions are transformed into a single and continuous outcome classifier called the L score.
Using a dataset of known miRNA hairpins from the miRBase database and an exhaustive set of
genomic hairpins identified in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, a subset of 18 most informative
descriptors was selected after detailed analysis of correlation among and discriminative power of
individual descriptors. We show that the majority of previously identified miRNA hairpins have high
L scores, that the method outperforms miRNA prediction by threshold filtering and that it is more
transparent than SVM classifiers.
Conclusion: The L score is applicable as a prediction classifier with high sensitivity for novel
miRNA hairpins. The L-score approach can be used to rank and select interesting miRNA hairpin
candidates for downstream experimental analysis when coupled to a genome-wide set of in silicoidentified hairpins or to facilitate the analysis of large sets of putative miRNA hairpin loci obtained
in deep-sequencing efforts of small RNAs. Moreover, the in-depth analyses of miRNA hairpins
descriptors preceding and determining the L score outcome could be used as an extension to
miRBase entries to help increase the reliability and biological relevance of the miRNA registry.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21-nucleotide (nt) short, single stranded RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression [1]. They are present
in higher eukaryotes and some viral genomes [2]. Because
the miRNA and small-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways
partly overlap, current understanding of miRNA biogenesis has gained from advances made in the field of RNA
interference. Mature, functional miRNAs develop from
degenerate palindromic repeats with a characteristic hairpin-like secondary structure [1,3,4]. Initially, experimental identification of miRNAs was achieved through direct
cloning and sequencing of small RNAs [5,6]. However,
such relatively low-throughput screenings were biased
towards abundantly or ubiquitously expressed miRNAs
[6] and missed many miRNAs with restricted temporal or
tissue-specific expression patterns [1]. Recently, strategies
using PCR [7], microarrays [8,9] or ultra high-throughput
sequencing [10,11] have expanded the list of known miRNAs. Many of these show tissue-specific expression [9,12]
or appear to be species-specific [12,13]. In both Arabidopsis thaliana [14,15] and Caenorhabditis elegans [10,16], for
example, high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs
shows moderate overlap in detected miRNAs between
experiments in each species, indicating that also in well
studied genomes many new miRNAs remain to be discovered. In addition, the observation that many miRNA loci
exhibit compelling hairpin structures on both sense and
antisense strands led to the discovery of anti-sense miRNA
transcription [17]. Antisense miRNA transcription and
processing yield distinct mature miRNAs. This contributes
to the functional diversification of miRNA genes for a considerable fraction of the known miRNA loci [17,18].
Various methods for the in silico prediction of miRNAs
have been developed to aid in experimental studies of
miRNA discovery [19,20]. These methods generally consider the hairpin-like secondary structure of the miRNA
precursor, the miRNA hairpin, as the most important
characteristic of a miRNA gene. They use RNA secondary
structure prediction (RSSP) algorithms, such as RNAfold
[21] or Mfold [22], to predict the secondary structure and
thermodynamic stability of the RNA hairpin structures.
Current bioinformatics approaches for the prediction of
miRNAs [19,20] generally include three steps: (1)
genome-wide prediction of hairpin structures; (2) filtering
or scoring of those hairpins on the basis of their similarity
in physical and sequence features to known miRNA hairpins and (3) experimental validation of putative candidates.
A common approach for the first step is to search for hairpin structures using a sliding window and perform RSSP
on each window [5,8,23,24]. An improvement in overall
calculation time over this approach is to first identify

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

degenerate palindromic sequences and to analyse only
these further with RSSP [25,26]. Unfortunately, these
approaches detect vast numbers of hairpin structures in
complete eukaryotic genomes. Depending on the method
used, 1E3 to 4E3 hairpins per Mb of genomic sequence are
found, resulting in about 1E7 hairpins identified in the
human genome [8,24-27]. The challenge is, therefore, to
devise an appropriate filtering method to separate the
chaff from the wheat.
Different criteria for filtering candidate miRNA sequences
have been proposed, generally with the aim to reduce the
search space and/or to increase the specificity of prediction [20]. Evolutionary conservation is considered an
important feature of the hairpin sequence [1] and analysis
thereof is often used to identify and focus comparisons on
the conserved non-coding sequence space in different
genomes [5,23]. An evolutionary approach known as phylogenetic shadowing has been used for combined selection and filtering of miRNA candidates [28]. This study
revealed a characteristic camel-shaped conservation pattern of putatively orthologous miRNAs that was useful as
a criterion for finding conserved miRNA candidates in primate genomes. Other filtering criteria include intragenomic matching of candidate miRNAs and their potential
targets [29], evidence for expression, thresholds on structural properties of hairpins, e.g. minimal folding energy
(MFE), absence of repetitive or low-complexity sequences,
occurrence in introns or intergenic regions [11], or proximity to known miRNA loci [2,24,30].
Stringent filtering is performed to attain high specificity,
that is, to minimize the number of false positive predictions of miRNA genes [20,25]. Obviously, maximizing
specificity increases the number of false negative predictions, that is, a decreased sensitivity [31]. This implies that
with stringent filtering, relevant miRNAs will be missed.
The success of any filtering procedure depends however
on the validity of the underlying assumptions. For example, filtering on evolutionary conservation will miss species-specific or fast evolving miRNAs [12] and lowcomplexity filtering is likely to miss miRNAs originating
from transposable elements [32,33]. Several recent methods employ machine learning techniques such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) [24,27,34,35] for
classification. Such SVMs evaluate differences in hairpin
properties between true-positive and true-negative examples of miRNAs for a given taxon to generate a prediction
classifier. SVMs have been successfully used for miRNA
gene prediction [24,34,35] and for the prediction of 5'
Drosha processing sites in miRNA hairpins [26,11].
Although the SVM approach is claimed to outperform earlier methods [35], SVM-based classifications combine
many features in a single kernel function and therefore do
not provide direct insight into the biological significance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

of these features. Such insight can only be obtained
through expert analyses and dedicated feature selection
procedures [19]. Moreover, the set of true-negatives which
is required for training an SVM is often very difficult to
define.
Here, we present an innovative strategy for miRNA prediction that focuses on attaining optimal sensitivity. We
define and combine 40 different filtering criteria and,
using a set of genomic hairpins identified in the genome
of Caenorhabditis elegans, show that 18 of these characteristics capture the biological variation of miRNA features
present in sets of known miRNA hairpins. These 18 criteria are used to establish a combined likelihood score L
that assesses the likelihood that a predicted hairpin structure in a genome contains a genuine miRNA. L is a continuous classifier that allows user-adjustable thresholds for
sensitivity and specificity in ab initio miRNA prediction
and miRNA analysis. Good performance of L for large sets
of hairpins from the genomes of C. elegans and four
viruses demonstrates the added value of the new analytical strategy for future miRNA discovery and selection.

Results
We have developed and evaluated a new computational
strategy for the prediction of candidate miRNAs in DNA
sequences. The new approach focuses on high sensitivity
in an initial hairpin detection step, followed by a flexible,

user-adjustable procedure to balance sensitivity with specificity and selectivity. For all hairpin sequences from an
input sequence, a miRNA likelihood score L is calculated,
given an underlying scoring model based on descriptors
of the physical and sequence characteristics of miRNAs
(Table 1; [see Additional file 1]). The performance of the
strategy was assessed by retrieval of known miRNAs from
hairpin structures identified in the genome of C. elegans.
Appropriate scoring models were derived for various taxonomic sets of known miRNAs.
Descriptor data fit
Most of the descriptors used for miRNA characteristics
have been proposed in previous studies [36-39], but a few
are, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time defined
in this study, for example 'GAsurplusCU' (Table 1). In all
cases except one, the empirical data showed a good fit to
a skew-normal (SN) probability distribution [40] according to a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test (p â¤ 1.4E-5; [see
Additional file 2]). As example, the frequency distribution, fitted SN distribution and the transformed likelihood distribution function (LDF) are shown for the
descriptors MFE and GC content in Figure 1. The only
exception to an SN probability distribution fit was found
for the descriptor 'P', which is the p-value of the MFE of
randomized sequence [38]. This fitted best to an exponential distribution corrected for zero values. Results of the

data fit for all descriptors from the taxonomic set Metazoa
are listed in Additional file 1.
Likelihood score S for miRNA hairpin descriptors
The CDF of the fitted distribution was transformed into
an LDF with outcome S. The range of S (between 0 and 1)
has an S < 1 and an S = 1 fraction which are separated by
the cut-off value derived from the 95% confidence interval of the descriptor's CDF. The S < 1 fraction contains
miRNAs hairpins with descriptor values in the tail(s) of
the distribution. These have a low probability of occurring
in true miRNA hairpins. The S = 1 fraction contains
miRNA hairpins with values in the remainder of the distribution and corresponds to likely properties of miRNA
hairpins. Descriptors were treated differently with respect
to the transformation of the tails of the CDF (Table 1; [see
Additional file 2]). For example, for the descriptor "minimal folding energy" (MFE) of a miRNA, there is in principle no need to impose a lower bound, even though the
fitted distribution (Figure 1A) indicates that very low MFE
values occur rarely in known miRNAs. The LDF of the
descriptor MFE assigns a score S = 1 for all values below 23.72 kcal/mol. Higher MFEs are penalized proportional
to the LDF and therefore assigned a score S < 1. MFE is an

example of a descriptor where the S < 1 fraction represents
the upper 5% tail of the confidence interval. For other
descriptors, the S < 1 fraction is represented by the lower
5% tail of the distribution (e.g. match ratio) or by both
the lower 5% and the upper 5% tail (e.g. GC-content, Figure 1B). Table 1 and Additional file 1 list the unlikely tails
for each descriptor.
Correlation of descriptors
The 40 descriptors here defined were either based on the
sequence of the hairpin, the structure of the hairpin or on
a combination of both (Table 1; [see Additional file 1]).
Correlations among these were obvious, for instance,
between stem length or GC-content on the one hand and
the MFE of a hairpin on the other hand. Correlated
descriptors will overemphasize the importance of a more
general feature of a miRNA hairpin and affect the usefulness of L. To assess the correlation among descriptors in
their S < 1 fractions, we calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient Îº [41] for all 780 possible pairs of descriptors, using
the miRNA hairpins of the taxonomic set Metazoa [see
Additional file 3]. For each descriptor the most strongly
correlated descriptor, as determined by the highest
observed Îº is listed in Table 1 (column Îº) and Additional

Page 4 of 24
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:204

file 3. The highest Îº was found between descriptors 'GCratio' and 'GsurplusC' (Îº = 0.995), followed by 'D' and 'Q'
(Îº = 0.844) and the pair 'P' and 'Z' (Îº = 0.784).
Discriminative power of descriptors
A discriminative descriptor contributes to the separation
of true miRNA hairpins from non-miRNA hairpins. The
discriminative power of a descriptor was defined as the
ratio of percentages of miRNA hairpins and genomic hairpins that comply with a threshold set to the descriptor's
limiting value between S = 1 and S < 1 of the LDF (95% of
the CDF). A discriminative power smaller than 1.0
implies that relatively more miRNA hairpins are rejected
than genomic hairpins. Higher values are obtained for
descriptor values that are typically encountered in miRNA
hairpins, but that are less common in collections of
genomic, predominantly non-miRNA hairpins. The most
discriminative descriptor was MFEahl (13.33) and least
discriminative were polyC, polyCstem, polyGstem (0.95)
(Table 1; [see Additional file 2]). Figure 2 illustrates the
discriminative power of descriptor MFEahl and reveals a
substantial difference between the SN-fitted CDFs of
miRNA hairpins and randomly selected genomic hairpins. Only 7% of genomic hairpins complied with the criterion of an MFEahl of 0.314, representing 95% of the
CDF of metazoan miRNA hairpins. The opposite was true
for the least discriminative descriptors: for example for
polyC, 99% of the genomic hairpins versus 96% of the
metazoan miRNA hairpins had a longest polyC stretch
smaller than five (not shown).
Delimiting a subset of most informative descriptors
The correlation and discriminative power of descriptors
were used to select a non-redundant subset of most
informative descriptors. Descriptors that either correlated
with a more selective descriptor, using a threshold for correlation of Îº>0.4, or that had a discriminative power
smaller than 1.1 were omitted. This resulted in a subset of
18 descriptors, seven of which were sequence related, nine
structure related, and two descriptors with mixed properties (Table 1). Remarkably, the descriptors 'GC-content'
and the MFE randomization descriptors 'P' [38] and 'Z'
[37], which are often used in miRNA prediction studies,
were not included in the subset [see Additional file 1]. The
latter two ranked among the most selective descriptors,
but were excluded because of their strong correlation with
the most selective descriptor MFEahl index, in which the
MFE is adjusted for hairpin length and GC-content [see
Additional file 3].
Assessment of scoring model performance
The 18 most selective descriptors (Table 1) were used to
define and analyze different scoring models. The CDF of
the fitted distribution of all 18 descriptors was transformed into an LDF with outcome S and the L score for a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

given miRNA sequence was calculated as the product of all
S values. Scoring model performance, defined as the
power to distinguish (potential) miRNA hairpins from
other (or random) genomic hairpins, was compared for
different models that were built using varying settings for
five parameters (see below). Scoring model performance
was measured as AUC performance and, where appropriate, with selectivity measured at two values of sensitivity
(95% and 75%), using genomic hairpins in C. elegans and
the collection of miRNAs hairpins in the taxonomic set
Metazoa.
(1) Size of taxonomic set
As expected, scoring models based on small taxonomic
sets had a less accurate data fit, as shown by increasing
Chi-square statistics for decreasing set size (Figure 3).
Gain in goodness-of-fit and AUC performance saturated
with increasing set size. The data presented in Figure 3
indicate that a minimal set size of a thousand miRNA
hairpins is required for an accurate data fit (average p(Chisquare) < 0.05). Performance in terms of selectivity
appeared to increase beyond this set size, suggesting that
prediction performance can be further improved by using
larger taxonomic sets.
(2) Composition of taxonomic set
Performance was found to depend on the evolutionary
distance between the species contained in a scoring
model's taxonomic set and the species for which (miRNA)
hairpins are scored by that scoring model. When five taxonomic sets were constructed that comprised equally
sized sets of miRNA hairpins from taxa with a decreasing
evolutionary distance and diversity relative to human
(Figure 4), these showed increasing AUC performance on
the miRNA hairpins from human. The opposite trend, i.e.
a decrease in AUC performance of the same five scoring
models, was observed for miRNA hairpins from Nematoda and Metazoa. Seemingly small differences in AUC
values translate to substantial differences in genome-wide
counts of positive hairpins. When choosing an arbitrary
miRNA detection sensitivity of 75%, the difference
between an AUC of 0.9831 (red bar Metazoa- Mammalia
in Figure 4) and 0.9806 (red bar Homo sapiens in Figure 4)
results in 6,749 or 17.6% fewer remaining genomic hairpins (38,383 and 31,634 hairpins, respectively). The
results confirm that a scoring model based on a set that is
taxonomically closest to the organism for which the
miRNA hairpins are scored, performs best. However, it is
noteworthy that taxonomic sets that do not contain
human miRNA hairpins (e.g. Mammalia excluding H.
sapiens, Figure 4) can yield scoring models with a good
performance for identifying human miRNAs.

the CDF of known miRNA hairpins). The discriminative power at 95% sensitivity is shown by a green arrow (13.33). SN-fitted
means are shown by red (0.44) and blue (0.18) arrows.

(3) Composition of descriptor subset
Selection of informative descriptors was found to be a crucial step in the development of scoring models, and three
factors that affected scoring model performance were
therefore analyzed in detail, i.e. the number of descriptors
selected (quantity), discriminative power of descriptors
(quality) and correlation between descriptors. Correlation
of structural properties that describe RNA molecules is
well-known [37]. In a miRNA prediction method such
correlations can strongly influence the prediction accuracy and should therefore be dealt with cautiously. Figure
5 illustrates the effect of highly correlated descriptors on

scoring model performance, using the strongly correlated
descriptors 'D' and 'Q' (Îº = 0.84) and a third descriptor
'SCS-di' that has a weak correlation with both 'D' and 'Q'
(Îº = 0.13 and 0.12, respectively). Scoring models containing pairs of uncorrelated descriptors had a higher selectivity value than the individual descriptors. In contrast, the
scoring model based on the strongly correlated descriptors 'D' and 'Q' gave a lower discriminative power than
one based on the most discriminative, individual descriptor 'Q' (Figure 5). Although this decrease (-0.14) seems
small, the combined effect over all correlated descriptors
will have a considerable effect in terms of the absolute

The accuracy of fit was then calculated by averaging Chi-square test statistics over all 40 descriptors and the 50 randomly selected subsets of each indicated size. Both AUC performance and Chisquare statistics show a strong dependency on Input-set size.

number of genomic hairpins that are penalized. It illustrates the necessity of selecting a descriptor subset with as
little pair-wise correlation as possible in the development
of appropriate scoring models.
(4) Parameterization of the LDF
The effect of parameterization on performance was
assessed by lowering the default cut-off value (default
95% of the CDF) to 90% and 80% before use in calculation of the transformed likelihood distribution score S.
The parameterization caused the number of miRNA hairpins included in the S < 1 fractions to double (90%) or
quadruplicate (80%) and increased the penalization of
hairpins relative to the default cut-off value. Figure 6
shows that increased AUC performance and selectivity
values were obtained by lowering the cut-off value compared to the reference model, with selectivity indexed for
the reference model. The increase is explained by the fact

that most descriptors gain in discriminative power at a
decrease in sensitivity (see Figure 2).
(5) Weighting of descriptors
The effect of weighting individual descriptors was studied
by assigning weights to each of the 18 previously selected
descriptors. Weights were equal to the square root of a
descriptor's discriminative power as measured at a sensitivity of 95% and ranged from 1.06 for GAsurplusCU to
3.65 for MFEahl (Table 1; [see Additional file 1]). Figure 6
shows that a scoring model with weighted descriptors
(W95% and W90%) had a significantly increased AUC
performance and selectivity index relative to their
unweighted models (95% and 90%). Obviously, when
weighted on the basis of their discriminative power,
descriptors with a high discriminative power contribute
stronger to the overall L score than descriptors with low
discriminative power. As such, a better separation

distinct effect on the shape of the ROC curve.

Finally, combinations of weighting and varying the
parameterization of descriptors were tested (models
W90% and W80%, Fig. 6). Scoring model W90% had the
highest AUC performance on metazoan miRNA hairpins
of all tested models. When weighting and parameterization were compared, weighting showed a stronger effect
on selectivity measured at 95% sensitivity, whereas
parameterization had a stronger effect on selectivity at

Building optimal scoring models
The data collected and analyses presented allowed the
selection of optimal scoring models, with maximal discriminative power to distinguish true miRNA hairpins
from other genomic (or random) hairpins for any given
case. In general, significant increases in selectivity were
gained by descriptor weighting and parameterization. In
terms of choice for a specific scoring model, the taxonomic input set should be sufficiently large and taxonom-

ically as close as possible to the organism of interest. In
total, 23 scoring models were built, based on 23 distinct
taxonomic sets and the subset of 18 most informative
descriptors, with the LDF parameterized at 90% of the
CDF and using individual weighting of descriptors.
Weighting and parameterization at 90% of the CDF
resulted in the highest AUC performance. Table 2 shows
the performance gain of these optimal scoring models relative to their non-optimized counterparts. Figure 7 shows
the ROC curves for the final and initial scoring model
Metazoa. The final scoring model Metazoa was subjected
to a 10-fold cross-validation for benchmarking and
yielded an AUC of 0.9732. The arbitrary cut-off for L of
1.0e-4 classifies 87.3% (1,774/2,033) of miRNA hairpins

correctly as positive and 97.0% of all genomic hairpins of
C. elegans as negative. The difference in performance with
the non cross-validated AUC performance (0.9874) is due
in part to the much smaller taxonomic input set used. The
latter was obtained by clustering all Metazoan miRNA
hairpins on the basis of sequence similarity. Nearly identical hairpin sequences can have subtle variation in some
descriptor values and thereby accurately represent the fact
that miRNAs occur in families. Therefore, and to maintain
a classifier as selective as possible, we recommend to use
the non-clustered variant of the scoring model.

(weight = 1.0) or weighted individual descriptors (W). Weights were adjusted to the square root of the descriptor's discriminative power as measured at a sensitivity of 95% (Table 1). The square root was taken to prevent disproportionate influence of
descriptors with high discriminative power. All models have the same input set (3,902 metazoan miRNA hairpins) and are
based on the previously selected set of 18 descriptors. Selectivity is expressed at 95% (purple) and 75% (blue) sensitivity on the
set of all metazoan miRNA hairpins; specificity is measured on the set of 3,526,115 hairpins in the genome of C. elegans. Relative values of selectivity are presented with the initial scoring model taken as index (selectivity of 12.6 at 95% and 74.1 at 75%

Combined likelihood score L for miRNA hairpin
descriptors
The combined L score for a given miRNA hairpin was calculated as the product of all S values of descriptors considered in a scoring model. In Figure 8, the distribution of the
resulting L scores for all miRNA hairpins from the taxonomic set 'Metazoa' is given for two different scoring
models in a cumulative L-score plot. For the scoring
model Metazoa (red), 31% of the known metazoan
miRNA hairpins had an L score of 1.0. This means that for

1,227 miRNA hairpins, the S score of the LDF of each of
the 18 descriptors was 1.0. A cumulative L score plot can
be used to select a desired level of sensitivity: an arbitrarily
chosen sensitivity of 90% is reached at an L of 0.0004 for
the optimized scoring model Metazoa (red) and at an L of
0.032 for the initial scoring model Metazoa (blue). This
hundred-fold difference is caused by adjusted parameterization and weighting of descriptors in the first model,
resulting in a higher overall penalization. This example
illustrates that the L score is a relative measure that

Comparison of the L score approach to threshold filtering
Comparison of our L score method to binary threshold filtering on miRNA hairpin descriptors showed superior performance of the L classifier (Table 3). For sets of miRNA
and genomic hairpins that were filtered at the bordering
value between the S = 1 and S < 1 fractions for all 18
descriptors, values for the performance parameters sensitivity, specificity and selectivity were obtained. Next, we
kept either sensitivity or specificity constant, assessed at
which L score this parameter was equalled and compared
the other performance parameters. In both cases, our scoring model approach outperformed threshold filtering.
When fixed at sensitivity, the scoring model approach
achieved 17% better. Sensitivity was measured on all
metazoan miRNA hairpins (3,902 hairpins) instead of on
C. elegans miRNA hairpins (132 hairpins) because of the
inaccuracy caused by the limited number of miRNAs in
the C. elegans set (data not shown).

In the four viral genomes, 25,599 hairpins were identified, including all 55 known miRNAs hairpins of these
viruses. In C. elegans, 3,526,115 hairpins were predicted
and only four out of 132 known miRNAs hairpins were
missed (cel-mir-262, cel-mir-260, cel-mir-272 and celmir-256). When benchmarking the performance of the
hairpin identification with the miRBase entries [44] of all
metazoan miRNA hairpins, 3,803 out of 3,902 (97.5%)
miRNA hairpins were recovered. The hairpin prediction
algorithm is independent of sequence context (data not
shown). This benchmark is therefore an estimate of the
algorithm's good performance on metazoan genomes.
Similar performance has been reported for other edit-distance based hairpins detection methods [26]. On a
genome scale, all these methods yield around 10,000â
20,000 hairpins per single stranded Mb of sequence.
These hairpins are predominantly overlapping and
nested.

Predicting hairpins from a genomic sequence
We developed a procedure for predicting hairpin structures from genomic sequences using Vmatch [43]. The
algorithm detects degenerate palindromic repeats and is
therefore able to recover known miRNA hairpins with
very high sensitivity. To benchmark the procedure, we
predicted hairpin structures in the genomes C. elegans and
four viruses: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Mareks disease
virus (MDV), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The
number of recovered, known miRNA hairpins, number of
identified hairpins and percentage and absolute number
of non-overlapping hairpins on unique loci are given for
three different L score criteria for the scoring model Metazoa, for both miRNA and genomic hairpins (Table 4).

Analyses of miRNA hairpin candidates in viral genomes
The data in Table 4 show that only 1.3â2.6% of the indentified hairpin loci in four viral genomes have a high L
score (L â¥ 0.05). This corresponds to 69â247 loci per
genome. In addition, 83â100% of all known miRNA hairpins comply with this threshold for L. Out of 6,182 hairpins predicted in the genome of EBV, only 23 hairpins,
originating from 20 unique loci, had an L score of 1.0. Ten
of these were experimentally validated miRNA loci [2]
[see Additional file 5]. Further support for our miRNA prediction and scoring method comes from recently discovered miRNAs in the MDV genome [45] that were not
included in miRBase 9.0. All five novel miRNAs (mdv1mir-M9 to mdv1-mir-M13) were present in the set of here
predicted hairpins and three of these had L score of 1.0
[see Additional file 6]. The 15 unique loci in MDV with an

L score of 1.0 collapsed into eight unique sequences due
to a large inverted repeat. Out of these eight, all five loci
that did not overlap with annotated exons corresponded
to known miRNA loci.
The two examples show that most hairpins in viral
genomes with high L score are true miRNA hairpins and
that the absolute number of hairpin loci with high L

scores is small. This allowed us to manually examine the
remaining, non-miRNA loci with high L scores, using
additional filtering criteria for genomic location such as
proximity to known miRNAs [2] and intronic position
[44]. Among the remaining loci in MDV with L â¥ 0.05,
one appeared to be located in the transcribed strand of an
intron and two others closely flanked (0.3 kb) the mdv1mir-M1 gene in the same orientation [see Additional file

1.0, two candidate miRNAs were located directly
upstream and amidst a cluster of eleven known miRNAs
in an intronic region of the BART gene [46] [see Additional file 5].
Mining the C. elegans genome for putative miRNA
hairpins
Using the scoring model Metazoa, the genome of C. elegans was searched for potentially novel miRNA hairpins.
For the set of 3,525,115 genomic hairpins, a cut-off value
L â¥ 0.05 resulted in a reduction of the number of candidate miRNA loci to 21,158 (0.6%). For L = 1, only 3,099
hairpins loci remained, but the sensitivity measured from
retrieval of known miRNA hairpins was only 34%. Nevertheless, this shows that filtering criteria in addition to the
L score are required prior to experimental evaluation of
candidate miRNAs. Such criteria may include the use of
annotation data or genomic context. It has been suggested, for example, that metazoan miRNAs do not overlap with exons [11]. Indeed, in the annotation used here
(Ensembl build 150), manual inspection of the genomic
position of 132 known miRNAs of C. elegans showed that
only two hairpins (2%) overlap with annotated exons
(cel-mir-354, cel-mir-356, Table 5). Another very selective
criterion is similarity to a known (metazoan) mature
miRNA. We used this criterion such that similarity should
be present in the stem of the hairpin and cover at least a

19 nt overlap with at most three mismatches. This resulted
in a reduction to only 937 hairpin loci (Table 5). Another
property of many miRNAs is their clustered occurrence,
with 45 from 132 miRNAs in C. elegans separated by less
than 5 kb [10]. This criterion limited the number of hairpin loci to 15,514 (Table 5). An example of a less selective
criterion is removing all hairpins that fall in highly repetitive genomic areas. A catalogue of repeat regions can be
obtained by an algorithm as Tandem repeats finder [47].
Additional selection can be accomplished with threshold
filtering using the same (or a subset of) descriptors already
used in our scoring model. Besides translating miRNA
hairpin properties into a statistic for relative rating, as
done in calculating the L score, a descriptor can be used as
a binary decision criterion: below the threshold, the hairpin is rejected as potential candidate; above it is included.
Which descriptor(s) to use for further filtering is in the
hands of the individual researcher and may depend on the
data studied. In the following, we provide two examples
of such filtering using seven individual descriptors: four
based on structure (stem length <= 55, loop length <= 40,
largest bulge <= 8, max match count >= 17) and three
based on sequence complexity (polyNucHairpin <= 8,
SCS-mono >= -10, SCS-di <= 0.40). Except for stem
length, all individual thresholds fall within their S < 1
fractions and separately reject at most three C. elegans
miRNA hairpins. This ensemble of thresholds excludes
low-complexity sequences, captures palindromic repeats

with limited degeneracy and should comprise the vast
majority of miRNAs. In total, only six C. elegans miRNA
hairpins fail this filter and the same sensitivity (96%) is
achieved on all metazoan miRNA hairpins. Only 30% of
the set of genomic hairpins in C. elegans passes this filter,
representing a selectivity of 3.3 (data not shown).
In the following examples, filtering on L score was combined with filtering on either genomic context or on a
similarity threshold to known metazoan mature miRNAs
(we refer to these protocols as "Clustered" and "Similar").
Goal of these filtering protocols was to achieve sets feasibly sized for manual inspection and/or laboratory evaluation. The protocols comply with characteristics of miRNAs
mentioned above: occurrence in clusters and presence in
families. "Clustered" and "Similar" resulted in lists of 20
and 64 candidate miRNA loci [see Additional files 7 and
8], respectively, that were manually inspected. The most
compelling cases among these are presented in Figure 10
and Figure 11. Figure 10 shows a cluster of hairpins of
which several have L = 1, starting 3 kb downstream of celmir-76. Figure 11 shows two conspicuous hairpins that
share similarity with the two known mature miRNAs celmir-269 and cel-mir-266 (hairpins 1,165,306 and
2,047,661, with L scores of 0.030 and 0.007, respectively).
The multiple alignment of the four hairpin sequences
revealed the characteristic camel-shaped conservation pattern that is often observed between related miRNAs [28]:
high or perfect conservation in the stem of the pre-miRNA
hairpins, low conservation in the hairpin loop and the upand downstream stem sequences. The 5' seed sequences of
both mature miRNAs (position two to seven) are exactly
conserved in the novel hairpins, suggesting that hairpins

1,165,306 and 2,047,661 are likely members of the
miRNA families to which cel-mir-269 and cel-mir-266
belong [10]. Furthermore, candidate 1,165,306 is located
in the 12th intron of the gene F54F11.2, for which the C.
elegans unigene set (build 28) [48] provided evidence of
transcription. Cel-mir-269 and cel-mir-266 were predicted by comparative computational approaches and
confirmed by a PCR amplification protocol, but their precise mature miRNA ends are unknown [36,44]. Recent
high-throughput sequencing of miRNAs from C. elegans
[10,16] could not confirm the existence of both miRNAs.
The data presented for the filtering protocols "Clustered"
and "Similar" (Table 5) show that combined filtering on
L score, genomic context and threshold filtering allows for
compilation of a priority list of candidate miRNAs that is
amenable to manual inspection and experimental verification. Apart from filtering on genomic clustering or similarity to known miRNAs, filtering on L score attains the
largest data reduction. This shows that the L score was
important in compilation of the priority list and demonstrates the added value of our approach for in silico miRNA
prediction.

Discussion
We here present a new computational strategy for the in
silico prediction of miRNA hairpins and show the applicability of the method for predicting new candidate miRNA
hairpins in four viral genomes and in the genome of C.
elegans. While using the latter as an example for model
construction, the L score method as here optimized for C.
elegans is well usable for other metazoan genomes. However, further improvement of performance of the method

on different taxonomic groups can be achieved by constructing dedicated scoring models [see Additional file 9].
Our strategy aims at minimizing the number of false negative predictions (optimal sensitivity), rather than at minimizing the number of false positive predictions (optimal
specificity), as proposed in previous studies. Focusing on
sensitivity rather than specificity should help uncover new
classes of miRNA molecules in biological systems. Hairpins in genomic sequences are identified with the help of
an adjusted suffix-tree based method. When the performance of the hairpin prediction was benchmarked on sets
of all known miRNAs hairpins from viruses and Metazoa,
all 55 viral miRNAs were recovered (100%), 128 of 132
(97%) C. elegans miRNAs were recovered and 3,803 out of
3,902 (97.5%) metazoan miRNAs were shown to be
recoverable when considered in their genomic context.
Similar performance was reported for another edit distance-based hairpin identification method [26].
Four C. elegans miRNAs (cel-mir-262, cel-mir-260, celmir-272 and cel-mir-256) remained undetected due to the
absence of a stringently base-pairing area in their stems.

They all had extremely poor L scores (2.7e-41, 2.5e-27,
3.5e-20 and 3.8e-10), ranking first, third, fourth and eight
among the C. elegans miRNA hairpins with lowest L
scores. None of the four was found in recent highthroughput sequencing datasets, which otherwise
retrieved the vast majority of known C. elegans miRNAs
[10,16]. This suggests that these four may not be genuine
miRNAs. If so, the reported performance of our hairpin
prediction method is underestimated.
The biological variation and evolutionary diversity of various properties of miRNA hairpins were captured in a likelihood score L, based on statistics derived from accurately
fitted (generally skewed normal) distributions of hairpin
characteristics derived from known miRNA hairpins. In
total 40 hairpin characteristics were defined and analyzed.
The L score is a measure for a single hairpin sequence: a
descriptor that captures evolutionary conservation in
another species is not included. Although conservation
has proven to be an extremely selective miRNA detection
criterion [28], it conflicts with the aim to maximize sensitivity, because of the existence of species-specific miRNAs.

The strategy was evaluated on genomic hairpins and
known miRNAs from the C. elegans genome. Although
details of analyses and results are likely to differ when
applied to other genomes and other negative sets of
genomic hairpins, major trends and results were shown to
be similar [see Additional file 9].
Based on analyses of correlation and discriminative
power, 18 hairpin characteristics were identified as most
selective. Comparison of the 18 descriptor scoring model
with a binary threshold filtering protocol using the same
18 descriptors (Table 3) shows that a 17% higher selectivity is achieved with the L score strategy. Binary decision
thresholds on all or even a few descriptors can easily result
in a major decrease of sensitivity. In the strategy developed here, L < 1 represents individual sequences that have
one or more descriptors with S < 1, indicating that these
descriptors have a relatively low probability of occurrence
in miRNA hairpins because they occur in the tail(s) of
their respective distribution. When a descriptor value falls
outside the observed range of biological variation, the
continuous likelihood score L allows for the compensation of an unlikely score for a single descriptor by likely
scores for other descriptors. In such a case, the sequence is
not a priori rejected as a miRNA hairpin candidate. The L
score thus allows for more deviations from 'genuine'
miRNA characteristics than binary selection (yes/no) on
the basis of the same characteristics. This is an important
improvement over the use of pre-defined thresholds for
filtering on single or multiple descriptors published previously [19]. Assigning scores to descriptors, as opposed to
binary selection on pre-defined thresholds, has also been
used in previous work. For example, MIRscan [5,6]
employs an heuristic score assignment to seven features
and assigns weights based on the relative entropy between
known miRNA hairpins and genomic hairpins. PalGrade
[8] uses a statistical distribution by arbitrarily binning the
ordered vector of descriptor values. SVM kernels achieve
descriptor scoring and weighting as part of the SVM [35].
Novel to the approach here developed is that the score
assignment is based entirely on the statistical evaluation
of the variation in physical and sequence properties
observed in known miRNAs and no binary selection prior
to building a scoring model is used.
The L score is a relative measure of the likelihood that a
given hairpin is a miRNA hairpin candidate. An important
parameter contributing to useful L scores is the number of
miRNAs used to derive the discriminating statistics of the
individual characteristics. A minimum of about a thousand miRNA hairpins is required, but results indicate that
the larger the available data set, the better the scoring
model captures the variation in miRNA hairpin characteristics and performs. In the context of machine learning,
the input miRNA set could be considered a training set,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

although in the L score derivation no formal 'training' is
included. It is noteworthy that the evolutionary distance
between the species contained in the taxonomic set for a
scoring model influences L considerably. In general, the
scoring model based on the set that is taxonomically closest to the organism being analyzed performs best. This
indicates that over a wide range of characteristics, miRNA
hairpins within (related) species are substantially more
alike than miRNA hairpin sequences between less-related
species. This should be taken into account when searching
for similarity between miRNA hairpins from distantly
related species. However, we observed that, for example,
taxonomic sets that do not contain human miRNA hairpins can yield scoring models that accurately identify
human miRNA hairpins. In addition, descriptor weighting and parameterization appeared to considerably influence the performance of a scoring model. The analyses
presented allow the selection of optimal scoring models,
with maximal discriminative power to distinguish true
miRNA hairpins from other genomic (or random) hairpins for a selected set and a given data set. However, each
set of data, for example in case of a new genome sequence,
will require its own analysis to build an optimal scoring
model.
Whereas the analyses started with 40 descriptors, based on
extensive correlation and selectivity analyses, a subset
model based on 18 descriptors was performing better
than the model comprising all 40 descriptors. In view of
the importance of the taxonomic composition of the set
used in the model, it should be pointed out, that this may
reflect a taxonomic bias for metazoan sequences that may
not be valid for other taxonomic groups, such as, for
example plant miRNA hairpins. In the set of 18 most
informative descriptors selected, it is remarkable that
three descriptors that are generally considered important
are not represented: GC content and the MFE randomization descriptors P and Z. GC-content is widely used as a
pre-filtering step of in silico miRNA prediction methods
[36], but is not among the 18 descriptors used in the final
scoring models. The GC-content showed the highest variability in the (skewed-normal) mean over different taxonomic sets (data not shown), reflecting the apparently
large variation in GC-content found among miRNA hairpins from different species. Any scoring model that
includes the fitted distribution of GC-content would disqualify hairpin structures in species containing miRNAs
with relatively high or low GC-content. Also the descriptors P and Z, based on MFE randomization shown to be
significantly lower for miRNAs hairpins than for randomized sequences [37,38], were not among the18
descriptors selected. Although P and Z ranked among the
most selective descriptors, they were excluded because of
their strong correlation [see Additional file 3] with the

most selective descriptor MFEahl index, in which the MFE
is adjusted for hairpin length and GC-content.
SVMs have similar aims as the L-score strategy and perform well in miRNA classification [35]. In assessing and
comparing the performance of different methods, however, several caveats should be considered. First, methods
that use evolutionary conservation perform well on conserved miRNAs [25,11] but fail to detect species-specific
or fast evolving miRNAs [12]. The importance of the latter
should not be underestimated. Second, the particular data
set(s) on which the performance is achieved is important
to the evaluation and comparison of the results from different methods. Unfortunately, there is no benchmark set
of both positive and negative examples of miRNA hairpins available. Many methods are tailored on a specific
organism and are likely to perform best in that exact context. Assembling a set of true negative sequences is particularly challenging: hairpins in non-coding RNAs, e.g. the
set of tRNAs as used in [25], are likely to possess different
and more diverse hairpin features than miRNA hairpins,
whereas a set of genomic hairpins might contain bona fide
miRNA hairpins. SVMs explicitly require negative examples for training and testing, whereas the L scoring
method uses such a set only for benchmarking purposes.
Third, data on prediction performance are not reported
consistently in literature. Our method enables reporting
of AUC performance as well as sensitivity and specificity
values over the entire range of the ROC curve. Comparison with binary classifiers from other methods therefore
requires transformation of the continuous outcome to a
binary outcome by choosing an arbitrary threshold for L
and using the associated sensitivity and specificity values
as measure of the performance.
With these caveats in mind, we compared the performance of our method to three leading SVM-based methods
miPred [35], RNAmicro [25] and miRNA SVM [26] Note
that RNAmicro is based on multiple sequence alignments.
Using different positive and negative datasets, these methods report the following values of sensitivity and specificity; 1) MiPred: 86.69% and 97.68%, using 323 human
miRNAs as positive and 646 human genomic hairpins as
negative set; 2) MiPred: 87.65% and 97.75%, using 1,918
Metazoan, non-human miRNAs as positive and 3,836
human genomic hairpins as negative set; 3) RNAmicro:
90% and 99%, using 147 Metazoan miRNA hairpin alignments as positive and 383 shuffled miRNA hairpin and
tRNA alignments as negative set, and; 4) miRNA SVM:
90% and 95%, using 322 human miRNAs as positive and
3,000 random human genomic hairpins as negative set.
These performances compare well to the values of 87.26%
and 97.02% obtained in the 10 fold-cross validated performance of our L score model, using 203 Metazoan
miRNA hairpins as positive and 200,000 randomly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

selected genomic hairpins from C. elegans as negative set.
The performance of the L scoring model is most similar to
that of miPred, which does not include sequence conservation as a parameter. An analysis of the performance of our
model on sets of genomic hairpins other than those
derived for the C. elegans genome is provided as Additional file [see Additional file 9].
A major challenge of any SVM is understanding its behavior in, for example, a biological context. While SVMs are
known to produce classifiers that perform well in case of
unseen data [49], SVMs are essentially black-box classifiers. This makes it difficult to judge the relative importance
of individual descriptors or to translate results in biologically relevant understanding. As all parameters are embedded in the kernel function of the SVM, SVM classifiers are
also difficult to adjust, although they do not require the
pre-selection of parameters required for the L score strategy here presented. Classifier selection based on the
detailed descriptor analysis presented here may improve
future SVM approaches. A key advantage of the L score
strategy over SVMs is that the contribution of individual
descriptors to a scoring model can be analyzed in a
straightforward way by adding or removing a descriptor or
changing the parameterization or weight of descriptors.
This way the scoring model becomes better tailored to the
biologist's needs in a particular research environment.

Conclusion
At the laboratory bench, the criterion that is of most interest is simply how many putative hairpins should be evaluated by experimentation. With current developments in
microarray analysis and high-throughput sequencing, the
numbers of potential candidates that can be screened with
relative ease will increase dramatically. Still large numbers
of new miRNAs may be identified. Yet, for the time being,
the individual laboratory would like to see as little putative candidates as possible with as high a success rate as
feasible. The highest L score is 1, implying that the given
hairpin scores are maximal for all descriptors in the
model. In the 100 Mb large genome of C. elegans, still
3,110 hairpin loci remain that cannot be ranked further
on the basis of L. It implies that relatively large numbers
of genomic hairpins (3,110 loci from 3,526,115 hairpins,
i.e. 0.09%; see Table 4) comply with all miRNA hairpin
descriptors, whereas it is unlikely that they all generate
mature miRNAs, given the relative small number of 132
currently known C. elegans miRNAs. It is likely that this
situation will occur in most genomic contexts. If so, several strategies are open. The model parameters could be
adjusted, so that the individual descriptor is less likely to
get the maximal score. This way, the L score approach will
convert to more traditional threshold filtering. Given that
the analysis requires high sensitivity, it would however be
more advantageous to incorporate more biological expert

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:204

knowledge in the selection process, such as the presence
of the hairpin in an intron, sequence similarity to known
miRNAs, etc. When following this strategy, one has to be
aware that the number of novel miRNAs that could be discovered is constrained by the filtering on genomic context. For example, in the set of 132 miRNAs in C. elegans
(miRBase 9.0), 87 occur in singletons when clustered on
distance, 56 have no other family representative and 102
are not located in an intron [10]. These numbers can thus
be considered as indicative for the fraction of true miRNAs
that will remain concealed when filtering on genomic
context. With the filtering protocols ("Clustered" and
"Similar") we show that a combination of filtering on L
score, genomic context and threshold filtering allows for
compilation of a priority list of manageable size for manual inspection and further experimentation.
In addition to good performance in comparison with
other leading (SVM-based) methods and a user-defined
selectivity, an additional advantage of the L score
approach over threshold filtering and support vector
machine classifiers is that the prior analysis of taxonomically defined sets and fitted distributions, correlations,
and discriminative power of descriptors gives detailed
insight in the behavior of a scoring model and can accommodate expert knowledge. It should therefore appeal to
the experimental biologist, despite the fairly time-consuming construction of a suitable scoring model.
The scoring model proposed here is independent of the
hairpin prediction step and can therefore be coupled to
any in silico or experimental miRNA prediction method. It
can facilitate the analysis of large sets of putative miRNA
hairpin loci obtained in deep-sequencing efforts of small
RNAs [10,14-16]. The L score approach can be used to
rank and select interesting miRNA hairpin candidates for
downstream experimental analysis in search for novel
miRNAs. Moreover, our in-depth analyses of known
miRNA hairpins from miRBase [44], our detailed descriptor analyses (Figure 9) and the L score approach here presented are likely to increase the reliability and evidence of
miRBase entries and will help to further increase the biological relevance of the miRBase repository.

Methods
Sequence and annotation data
The complete set of 3,498 non-plant miRNA hairpin
sequences were retrieved from the web resource miRBase
version 9.0 [44]. In addition, 474 miRNA hairpin
sequences from human and chimpanzee [12] and 18 from
C. elegans [10] were obtained from the supplementary
material of the respective publications. Secondary structures of the sequences were predicted using RNAfold version 1.6 [21] with the constrained folding option (-C)
used to position the mature miRNA sequence(s) in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

stem of the hairpin. The hairpin structure of six sequences,
three from miRBase and three from the human/chimpanzee set [12], deviated considerably from the predicted
characteristics of miRNA hairpins. These six sequences
were therefore excluded from all subsequent analyses [see
Additional file 10]. The resulting 3,984 miRNA hairpin
sequences were included in this study, 3,902 from Metazoa and 82 from virus genomes. Sequence and annotation
of the C. elegans genome (build 150) was obtained from
Ensembl [50]C. elegans unigenes (build 28) were downloaded from NCBI UniGene [48]. Viral genome data for
the Epstein-Barr virus [EMBL: AJ507799], Human
cytomegalovirus [EMBL: X17403], Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [EMBL: U75698] and Mareks disease
virus [EMBL: AF243438] were obtained from EMBL [51].
Informatics and statistics
Supplemental data are available through the Additional
data files and the accompanying web document Î¼RNALL,
which can be downloaded at http://appliedbioinformat
ics.wur.nl/murnall/[42]. All statistical analyses were performed using the package R [52], as integrated in python
through Rpy [53].
Definition of miRNA descriptors
A set of 40 potentially discriminative features of miRNA
hairpins, hereafter referred to as descriptors, was defined
based on the set of 3,984 miRNA hairpins. The descriptors
include both physical and sequence characteristics of
miRNA hairpins [Table 1; see Additional files 1 and 2]. A
subset of descriptors is given in Table 1. To take the evolutionary diversity of the descriptors into account in the statistical analyses, miRNA sequences were divided in
hierarchically organized subsets based on their taxonomic
relationships. Taxonomic sets that comprised at least 100
sequences were used for analysis. In total, 23 taxonomic
sets were defined [see Additional file 4], including one set
containing all metazoan miRNA sequences, eleven sets
representing metazoan taxa and eleven species-specific
sets. The virus set was not used because it contained only
82 sequences. Unless stated otherwise, all results presented in this paper use the combined taxonomic set
'Metazoa' (3,902 miRNAs).
Individual likelihood score S for each descriptor
For all 3,902 sequences, descriptor values were calculated
and their distributions within each of the 23 taxonomic
sets were fitted to an appropriate probability distribution.
Goodness-of-fit was determined by a Chi-square test. For
each distribution, the probability that the descriptor takes
a value less than or equal to a specified value was calculated as the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and
transformed into a likelihood distribution function
(LDF). For the LDF, a default cut-off value was set at 0.05,
corresponding to the 95% confidence interval of the fitted

Page 20 of 24

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:204

distribution of the descriptor. For each descriptor, values
of the CDF above the cut-off value were transformed to
the LDF likelihood score S = 1. Values below the cut-off
were transformed to the likelihood score S = (CDF/cutoff). Table 1 and Additional file 2 list for each descriptor
whether the lower tail of the CDF, upper tail or both were
transformed. As a result of this transformation, each
descriptor in the taxonomic set has a likelihood distribution S comprising an S < 1 and an S = 1 fraction. S = 1 indicates a descriptor for which characteristics of the
individual sequence are in 95% of the distribution.
Likelihood score L for the combined descriptor values
To obtain a single metric for a given taxonomic set, the
likelihood scores S for all descriptors were multiplied to
obtain the combined likelihood score L. The ensemble of
likelihood scores S for a given set of hairpin sequences is
referred to as the scoring model. L is the outcome of the
scoring model and functions as classifier for miRNA hairpin sequences. L ranges between 0 and 1 and represents
the likelihood of a hairpin sequence to be a true miRNA
hairpin given the underlying descriptors used in the scoring model. It is possible to incorporate additional expert
knowledge in the scoring model by assigning a relative
weight to the S score of an individual descriptor. In the
default setting reported here, no difference between
descriptors is made (assigned weight = 1). An L score of
1.0 for a hairpin sequence indicates that S = 1 for each
descriptor of the set. L is only affected by descriptors with
a value S < 1.
Correlation and discriminative power of descriptors
To prevent potential over-penalization of hairpin
sequences when combining correlated descriptors, we
determined the independence (orthogonality) of all
descriptors in the S < 1 fraction by calculating Cohen's
kappa [41] for each combination of descriptors. The value
Îº = 0 indicates that there is no more correlation between
descriptors than expected by chance alone, and Îº = 1 indicates that the descriptors are fully dependent. The discriminative power of a descriptor, i.e. its ability to distinguish
true miRNA hairpins from non-miRNA hairpins, was calculated as the ratio of percentages of miRNA hairpins and
genomic hairpins that comply with a given threshold for
this descriptor. As threshold the descriptor's limiting value
between S = 1 and S < 1 of the LDF was chosen (95% of
the CDF). Discriminative power was calculated using
known miRNA hairpins from the taxonomic set Metazoa
and genomic hairpins from a set of 3,526,115 hairpins
identified in C. elegans (see section Identification of putative miRNA hairpin structures). It is calculated with the
formula for selectivity (see below), but for the sake of clarity we will here use the term 'discriminative power' for the
performance of a single descriptor and the term 'selectivity' for the performance of a scoring model.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/204

Descriptor selection and model evaluation
To select a subset of descriptors that was most informative
for the combined assessment of miRNA hairpins by the L
classifier, descriptors that either correlated with a more
discriminative descriptor (Îº>0.4) or that showed low discriminative power (< 1.1) were discarded from the initial
set. The resulting subset was used to evaluate the impact
of different settings of variables. For all models, L scores
were calculated for 100,000 randomly selected hairpins
from the C. elegans genome. We evaluated (1) the effect of
the size of the input set, which refers to the number of
miRNA hairpins in a given taxonomic set; (2) the impact
of evolutionary distance between taxa; (3) the impact of
different combinations of descriptors in a scoring model;
(4) the effect of parameterization of descriptors and (5)
the effect of weighting of descriptors.
Performance of L
The performance of the outcome classifier L of scoring
models was measured in two ways. First, by the area under
a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [54]. Trapezoids were constructed as approximation of the Area
Under the Curve (AUC). Unless described otherwise, ROC
curves were made for the taxonomic set of metazoan
miRNA hairpins (3,902) versus 200,000 randomly
selected hairpins from the C. elegans genome. Second, sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity were calculated for each
scoring model from the counts of true and false positive
and negative cases (TP, FP, TN, and FN, respectively) in
the following way:

Sensitivity = (100â)TP /( TP + FN)
Specificity = (100â)TN /( TN + FP)
Selectivity = Sensitivity /(100 â Specificity )
TP and FN were counted from taxonomic sets of known
miRNA hairpins, TN and FP were determined as a fraction
of genome-wide identified hairpins. Although these sets
of genomic hairpins contained an unknown number of
true miRNAs (so FN and TP), this number was expected to
be sufficiently small to be ignored. For uniform comparison, we benchmarked selectivity at discrete values of sensitivity (95% and/or 75%). Discrete points on the ROC
curve correspond to pairs of sensitivity and specificity values, and as such describe the shape of the curve.
The performance of the classifier L was compared with
sensitivity, specificity and selectivity of threshold filtering
on descriptors of miRNA and genomic hairpins. For the
18 most informative descriptors, the threshold used did
represent the same cut-off value between the S = 1 and S
< 1 fraction of the LDF, at 95% of the CDF at the side(s)
of the distribution as listed in Table 1. This cut-off was
used as a binary decision criterion: below the threshold,
the (miRNA) hairpin was included; above it was rejected.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:204

A 10-fold cross-validation was performed on 200,000 randomly chosen genomic hairpins and repeated ten times.
As input set, a non-redundant variant of the taxonomic set
Metazoa was constructed. This involved clustering miRNA
hairpins with identical mature miRNA seed sequences
and an overall hairpin sequence identity larger than 90%.
All but a single representative for each cluster were then
removed, yielding a subset of 2,033 sequences.
Identification of putative miRNA hairpin structures
The suffix-tree based tool VMatch [43] was used to identify small genomic hairpin structures in the genomes of C.
elegans and four viruses, using a sliding window of 1,000
nt with an overlap of 200 nt. The latter value exceeds the
length of the largest known metazoan miRNA hairpin
(153 nt). Each sequence window was stored as a VMatch
database (index) and its reverse complement was used as
query sequence in a VMatch search for degenerate palindromic sequences, allowing GU-base pairing. Parameter
settings that allowed exhaustive retrieval of known
miRNA hairpins were found empirically (data not
shown). Such a palindromic sequence consists of two
inverse complementary sequences for the stem, at a physical distance representing the loop of a putative hairpin.
Palindromes were discarded if the distance was larger than
50 nt, which represents the upper limit of loop size in the
vast majority of metazoan miRNAs. Overlapping palindromes were merged if they had at most 8 non-overlapping nucleotides on either side. With these parameter
settings, only a small number of known miRNA hairpins
was missed. The remaining set of palindromic sequences
was used for secondary structure prediction using RNAfold version 1.6 with the constrained folding option (-C)
to enforce the stem structure in the folding of the molecule [21]. All hairpin structures were filtered for five
threshold values: (1) minimal hairpin length = 45 nt; (2)
minimal number of base pairs in the stem = 15; (3) minimal number of paired bases in the most stringently
paired window of 24 positions in the hairpin stem = 15;
(4) maximum length of a bulge in the stem = 29 nt; (5)
minimal ratio of the number of paired positions divided
by all positions in the stem (match-ratio) = 0.45.
Grouping identified genomic hairpins into unique loci
Many of the genomic hairpins identified were overlapping
or nested. Such hairpins were grouped into unique loci
when the centers of their loops were less than 20 nt apart,
regardless of the strand on which the hairpins were
located.
