Abstract
Background: The internal phylogenetic relationships of Annelida, one of the key
lophotrochozoan lineages, are still heavily debated. Recent molecular analyses suggest that
morphologically distinct groups, such as the polychaetes, are paraphyletic assemblages, thus
questioning the homology of a number of polychaete morphological characters. Serpulid
polychaetes are typically recognized by having fused anterior ends bearing a tentacular crown and
an operculum. The latter is commonly viewed as a modified tentacle (= radiole) and is often used
as an important diagnostic character in serpulid systematics.
Results: By reconstructing the developmental neuroanatomy of the serpulid polychaete Spirorbis
cf. spirorbis (Spirorbinae), we found striking differences in the overall neural architecture, the
innervation pattern, and the ontogenetic establishment of the nervous supply of the operculum and
the radioles in this species. Accordingly, the spirorbin operculum might not be homologous to the
radioles or to the opercula of other serpulid taxa such as Serpula and Pomatoceros and is thus
probably not a part of the tentacular crown.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that common morphological traits such as the prostomial
appendages may have evolved independently in respective serpulid sublineages and therefore
require reassessment before being used in phylogenetic analyses. Our findings corroborate recent
molecular studies that argue for a revision of serpulid systematics. In addition, our data on Spirorbis
neurogenesis provide a novel set of characters that highlight the developmental plasticity of the
segmented annelid nervous system.

Background
A number of classical and recent studies have shown that
structural similarities among organisms are not necessarily based on homologous characters, but may instead be
the result of convergent (analogous) evolution. Thereby,
these matching phenotypes have emerged independently
in distantly related organisms [1-6]. Accordingly, if misinterpreted as sharing common ancestry, convergently

evolved characters might lead to false conclusions in phylogenetic reconstructions.
In the age of genomics, convergent evolution is mostly
inferred based on existing phylogenies (i.e., after the
actual analysis) and is often used to explain incongruencies between the phylogenetic signal obtained from
molecular versus morphological datasets. In this respect,

neuronal innervation patterns of organ systems may be
used as an independent test of homology prior to phylogenetic analysis, as illustrated by classical studies on the
structure of the polychaete nervous system [7-9]. Along
these lines, it seems reasonable to assume that investigations of neuronal innervation patterns and neurogenesis
pathways might also aid in resolving long standing questions regarding the internal phylogenetic relationships of
Annelida, one major lophotrochozoan lineage. In particular, the basal branches of the annelid tree remain unresolved, despite the additional use of large-scale molecular
analyses [10-19]. Current interest has therefore partly
shifted to lower taxonomic levels, taking a "top down"
approach to reconstruct annelid phylogeny.
One widely distributed and abundant group of polychaete
fan worms, the Spirorbinae, is characterized by a crown of
tentacles, commonly referred to as "radioles", and a conspicuous calcareous tube that can be closed with an operculum (Figure 1A). All spirorbins described to date brood
their embryos either in their coiled tube or in the operculum, unlike most species of the other two traditional subtaxa of the serpulid tube worms, the Serpulinae and
Filograninae [20,21]. A recent cladistic analysis of the relationships among spirorbid subfamilies [22] suggests
thereby that the opercular brooders occupy the most
derived position on the spirorbin tree. Ever since Müller
[23] published his observations on the development of
Serpula (Serpulinae), the operculum has been viewed as a
modified tentacle (radiole) of the branchial crown, and it
is often used as an important diagnostic character in serpulid systematics [21,24]. Accordingly, some authors
regard spirorbins as a separate taxonomic entity, based on
their unique morphology and development [e.g., [2529]]. However, recent studies of serpulid phylogeny using
morphological and molecular data recognize Spirorbinae
as one of altogether four monophyletic clades within Serpulidae (Figure 1B). Moreover, they appear to be the sister
group to a mixed clade of serpulin and filogranin taxa
[21,24], although the statistical analyses could not significantly reject the hypothesis that Spirorbinae are instead
the basal-most taxon of the Serpulidae [24]. In addition,
the current knowledge and status of the taxonomy of the
individual serpulid genera, except the ones of the Spirorbinae, has been reviewed only lately [30].
In order to test the proposed homology - and thus the
potential usefulness for phylogenetic analyses - of one of
the most crucial morphological characters in the serpulid
bodyplan, the operculum, and to assess the hypothesis
that all spirorbin opercula evolved from a cephalic radiole, we investigated the ontogeny of the innervation pattern of the prostomial appendages of the spirorbin
Spirorbis cf. spirorbis. In addition, we provide a new set of

polychaete species.

Results
General development and FMRFamidergic
immunoreactivity
Each embryo of Spirorbis cf. spirorbis is encased in an egg
capsule and several dozens of embryos are surrounded by
a common membrane aligned along the trunk of the
mother individual within the calcareous tube (Figure 1A).
Therein, the embryos develop into three-segmented lecithotrophic larvae. These larvae exhibit a short planktonic
phase after hatching, settle after a few hours, metamorphose into asymmetric juveniles, and eventually secrete a
coiled tube (Figure 2C, F, I). The anlage of the collar,
which surrounds the branchial crown of the adult, is
already visible in the encapsulated larva (Figure 2A). At
the same time, the first FMRFamidergic signals appear in
structures of the precursors of the adult central nervous
system. The cerebral commissures show an intense staining and are in direct contact with the rudiments of the
adult circumesophageal connectives whose signal is faint
in the region of the prototroch nerve ring. The ventral
nerve cords consist of paired FMRFamidergic axons (Figure 2A). Slightly later, the cerebral commissures fuse, with
additional fibers forming the neuropil of the cerebral ganglion (Figure 2B). At the junction of the circumesophageal
connectives and the paired ventral nerve cords, a
subesophageal commissure interconnects both ventral
nerve cords (Figure 2B). The latter vary along the longitudinal body axis with respect to the number of axons they
comprise. Anteriorly, the number of neurons with an
FMRFamidergic signal increases, whereas only two axons
are present in the posterior region. A second commissure
appears exactly in the region where this change of axon
number occurs (Figure 2B). Prior to hatching, the
branchial rudiments and the first setae are already present
(Figure 2C). Eventually, after the release of the free-swimming larva, three body regions are recognized: head, thorax with collar, and abdomen (Figure 2D, F). Anteriorly,
the circumesophageal connectives split into a dorsal and
a ventral root. Both traverse the cerebral ganglion that
exhibits a very strong FMRFamidergic signal (Figure 2D).
At this stage, the larva possesses various ciliated regions,
such as the prototroch, the neurotroch, the apical tuft, and
several posterior sensory cilia (Figure 2E). One transitional FMRFamidergic perikaryon is located posterior to
the apical cilia (Figure 2D). Apart from that, none of the
other ciliated structures shows FMRFamidergic innervation (Figure 2E). The same applies to the operculum that
develops dorsally on the left side, in close proximity to the
rudiments of the branchial crown (Figure 2F, G). In the
following, the larva settles, attaches its ventral side temporarily to the substrate, and finally turns by 180°, resulting
in the dorsal side of the thorax facing the substrate. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/270

rotation is not complete in the posterior body region,
where the larval abdomen is only twisted by a mere 90°.
Therefore, the former ventral and dorsal parts are now
located in a (morphological) lateral position. In sharp
contrast to the broad distribution of serotonin (Figure 3;
Figure 4; Figure 5) in post-settled juveniles, the FMRFamidergic expression is almost exclusively restricted to the
head and thorax (Figure 2G; Figure 5A). All larval ciliary
bands have been shed, leaving the developing branchial
crown the only external ciliated body region. The sinistral
direction of the coiled tube has already been determined
at this stage (Figure 2H, I).
Development of the serotonergic nervous system
The neurotransmitter serotonin is present in Spirorbis cf.
spirorbis from the early trochophore stage onwards (Figure
3; Figure 4). The first serotonergic signals appear more or
less simultaneously with the FMRFamidergic immunoreactivity. Initially, serotonin is found in the early anlagen
of the adult central nervous system, such as the cerebral
ganglion, the circumesophageal connectives, the ventral
nerve cords, and the subesophageal commissure (Figure
3A). In addition, serotonin is distributed in a nerve ring
underlying the larval prototroch. This serotonergic innervation of the ciliated prototroch changes considerably
over time (Figure 3; Figure 4). The primary prototroch
nerve ring expands on its ventral side shortly before hatching and forms a network of cross-linked serotonergic fibers (Figure 3B, C, D). Moreover, two clusters of accessory
prototroch neurons develop dorsolaterally in the freeswimming larva (Figure 4A, B), and a broad gap appears
in the serotonergic prototroch innervation (Figure 3D;
Figure 4B). After settlement, the neurons of the prototroch
are reduced to a semi-circle on the dorsal side and degenerate completely during metamorphosis (Figure 3E, F).

The apical organ of free-swimming Spirorbis larvae initially comprises four serotonergic flask-shaped perikarya
(Figure 3B). Three of these cells lie in one plane, with the
fourth cell body being positioned medially above them.
All apical perikarya possess projections that seem to be
connected to the rudiment of the adult cerebral ganglion.
Interestingly, the number and position of these apical serotonergic somata varies over time as well as between individuals with a maximum of seven being present in
specimens competent to settle.
The cerebral ganglion is one of the first adult features that
are established during neurogenesis. It is divided into two
distinct serotonergic hemispheres (left and right) in the
encapsulated and free-swimming larval stages. Posterior
to the two domains, the cephalic commissures appear as
one strand which is directly connected to the circumesophageal connectives (Figure 4B). After settlement, the
latter split anteriorly into the so-called dorsal and ventral

roots. Each root differentiates into a dorsal and a ventral
commissure. Accordingly, four main commissures, all
derived from the circumesophageal connectives, traverse
the cerebral ganglion (Figure 4C). The cerebral commissures come to lie in close proximity to the subesophageal
commissure, because the circumesophageal connectives
are relatively reduced in length in juvenile specimens (Figure 3F; Figure 4D; Figure 5C).
Two thin axons represent the first rudiments of the developing serotonergic ventral nerve cords while the larva is
still within the egg capsule (Figure 3A). In later larval
stages, the signal of the ventral nerve cords is discontinuous in the second segment. Anteriorly, two axons are
present on each side, followed posteriorly by a discrete
perikaryon with one long axon pointing medially towards
the posterior end (Figure 3B). The ventral nerve cords consist of multiple fibers in the collar region during the freeswimming larval stage and are interconnected by an additional commissure just posterior to the already established subesophageal commissure (Figure 3C, D, E; Figure
4A, B, C). In the abdomen, the ventral nerve cords show a
different organization. Thereby, it appears that the axons
of the inner ventral nerve cords (i-v) derive from the posterior ectoderm, whereas the ones of the outer part (o-v)
are extensions from the anterior thorax region (Figure 3C,
D). After settlement, a second commissure is formed in
the region where the most anterior neurites of the ventral
cords terminate (Figure 4C). The architecture of the ventral nervous system changes significantly with the onset of
metamorphosis, eventually resulting in the ventral nerve
cords being located on the left side in early juvenile specimens due to the rotated body axis (Figure 3F; Figure 5B,
C). Another alteration relates to the shift of the ventral
commissures in an anterior direction, resulting in the first
ventral commissure merging into the newly formed
subesophageal ganglion (Figure 4D; Figure 5C). Furthermore, the two strands of the ventral nerve cords fuse in the
segmented setigerous abdomen, except for the posteriormost end (Figure 3F; Figure 5C). Several serotonergic perikarya are associated with the ventral nerve cords from the
free-swimming larval stage onwards (Figure 4A, B, C). The
number and position of these cells, which are arranged in
three clusters, is not consistent among individuals of the
same stage. On the opposite side of the abdomen, dorsal
longitudinal neurons are present. Interestingly, these two
widely separated strands of the peripheral nervous system
have a commissural neuron (Figure 3F).
The development of the peripheral nervous system starts
with a network of collar neurons in the encapsulated larva
(Figure 3B-F). In a second step, dorsal peripheral neurons
that innervate the abdomen appear during the planktonic
larval phase (Figure 3C, D, E). After settlement, these are
directly connected to a transversal thorax nerve which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/270

crosses the dorsal body region (Figure 3E; Figure 4C). One
lateral longitudinal nerve runs along each side of the thorax from the transversal thorax nerve to the main collar
nerve (Figure 3E; Figure 4C). Here, anterior segmental
neurons branch off. They are associated with the first ventral commissure of the paired nerve cords (Figure 4C; Figure 5B). These anterior segmental neurons are connected
to the subesophageal ganglion after metamorphosis, due
to a forward migration of the first ventral commissure
(Figure 4D; Figure 5C). Moreover, the lateral longitudinal
nerves are shortened compared to the pre-metamorphic
condition, and the transversal thorax nerve is connected
to the ventral nerve cords at the position of the second
ventral commissure (Figure 4D).
Innervation of the branchial crown and the operculum
In adult Spirorbis specimens, the branchial crown consists
of two branches, the left one carrying four and the right
one bearing five tentacles (radioli) (Figure 1A). Terminal
filaments, the so-called pinnules, branch off from each
radiole. The opercular stalk emerges next to the radioli on
the left side (Figure 1A; Figure 6A). While serotonin is
widely distributed in the whole nervous system of the
branchial crown and the operculum, we did not detect
FMRFamide in these structures.

The earliest serotonergic signals from the two neuronal
growth cones of the branchial crown are present in the
encapsulated larva, and additional branchial neurons
appear in the free-swimming larval stage (Figure 3B, C, D;
Figure 4A, B; Figure 6B). Several axons outline the contour
of the operculum shortly after settlement (Figure 3E; Figure 6B). At the same time, the two main nerves of the tentacular crown are already established and split
dichotomously at their anterior end (Figure 6B). During
metamorphosis, two branchial crown ganglia develop at
the base of the tentacles (Figure 6C). From there, neurons
branch off and project into the radioli. Exactly the same
number of branchial filaments arises on either side. At this
point of development, it is not possible to distinguish pinnules from radioles. Eventually, three distinct nerves
innervate each individual branchial filament. Accordingly, all radioli and pinnules have one median nerve and
two lateral branchial nerves (Figure 6C). The latter are
located in a different focal plane than the internal nerve.
By contrast, the opercular peduncle and lid are only lined
by a single, loop-like opercular nerve. The tissue in the
middle of the peduncle is innervated by axons that are
irregularly linked to the opercular nerve (Figure 6C). The
neurons at the base of the peduncle emerge from the dorsal cerebral commissures, whereas the branchial crown
nerves emerge from a more posterior region (Figure 6C).
Moreover, the branchial crown nerves reach almost to the
subesophageal ganglia. Accordingly, the neuronal innervation of the branchial crown and the operculum, respec-

Discussion
Comparative aspects of polychaete neurogenesis
Despite a significant increase of data on lophotrochozoan
neurogenesis and larval neuroanatomy [31-50] and the
crucial role of polychaetes for evolutionary inferences,
detailed studies on the ontogeny of their nervous system
employing immunocytochemical methods are as of yet
only available for four species [31,40,43,45]. While final
conclusions concerning the ancestral neural bodyplan of
Annelida can therefore not yet be made, a comparison of
the data currently available hints towards certain evolutionary trends which may have considerable bearing for
our understanding of the origin of the polychaete (and
annelid) nervous system.

Within Annelida sensu lato, it appears that a segmented
body organization has been lost independently multiple
times, but that it has been at least partly retained in the
larval nervous system of some taxa that show no external
signs of metamerism in the adult stage, such as echiurans
[34,35,39] and sipunculans [47,51]. Similarly, multiple
variations of the conventional rope-ladder-like nervous

system have been described for various polychaetes.
Accordingly, the number of connectives may range from
one to five in adult polychaete annelids [44]. The presence
of only one nerve in the setigerous abdomen of the adult
and a reduced number of ventral commissures illustrates
that the metameric arrangement of the nervous system is
only weakly expressed in Spirorbis as well. These findings
are consistent with an earlier description of another
spirorbid polychaete, Spirorbis moerchi [52]. In this species, three pairs of ganglia and three ventral commissures,
which are associated with the three larval segments, are
formed, and these constitute the only neural components
that hint towards a segmented nervous system [52]. Similar to the condition found in S. spirorbis, the ventral nerve
cords are widely separated in the anterior body region
before they fuse into one strand in the setigerous abdomen. Although the latter is externally segmented in the
adult, this condition is not reflected in the nervous system
[53-56]. The plasticity of annelid neural segmentation is
also demonstrated by the variability concerning the neurogenesis pathways that may lead to the metameric
arrangement of individual components of the segmented
nervous system. As such, in the sabellid polychaete Sabellaria alveolata, two distinct modes of neural development
are found, namely the simultaneous formation of the first
three pairs of peripheral segmental neurons on the one

[45]. Taken together, these data indicate that the ontogenetic establishment of the segmented annelid nervous system is a highly dynamic process that must have
undergone significant modifications from its ancestral
developmental pathway in the various annelid lineages,
and additional future studies on the subject are needed
before we are able to fully understand the mechanisms
that underlie annelid segmentation and nervous system
evolution.
Innervation patterns of the anterior appendages and the
evolution of serpulid opercula
The serpulid operculum and its peduncle are commonly
regarded as a modified tentacle (= radiolus) of the
branchial crown [57-61]. Ever since Müller's [23] observation that the operculum forms at the tip of a pinnulate
radiolus in individuals of the genus Serpula, the tentacles
have been considered homologous to the operculum. This
notion is still widely accepted, despite considerable phenotypic and developmental variation of serpulid opercula. As such, the operculum may either develop directly
at the distal tip of a smooth peduncle without pinnules

(e.g., in Pomatoceros and Spirorbis) or indirectly (e.g., in
Serpula). In the latter case, the peduncle retains its pinnules only in some filogranin species. In addition, the
Filograninae encompass a few non-operculate forms such
as Protula (see Figure 1B).
Serpulid phylogeny has traditionally been founded to a
large extent on these opercular characters [30]. For example, Pillai [25] proposed that the spirorbin opercula are
not homologous to the ones of other serpulid species, and
accordingly suggested a new classification of the spirorbin
taxa, while ten Hove [62] proposed an evolutionary
hypothesis for serpulid phylogeny based on a transformation series of the branchial crown alone. However, the latter author stressed at the same time the lack of other
conclusive characters to substantiate serpulid interrelationships. To further assess this issue, neuronal innervation patterns of organ systems may be used as an
independent test of homology prior to phylogenetic analysis, as illustrated by recent neuroanatomical studies on
euchelicerates and pycnogonids (seaspiders) [63-65]. In
addition, the comprehensive studies on the cephalic nervous system of polychaetes by Orrhage [7-9] highlight the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:270

relevance of such investigations for the homologization of
anterior appendages in annelids.
The internal anatomy of the radioles has been analysed in
several different serpulid species [60,66-68] including
Spirorbis [53,68,69]. However, the present study on neurogenesis in S. spirorbis is the first one to raise serious doubts
on the proposed homology of opercula and radioles in
Spirorbinae based on differences concerning (i) the overall neural architecture, (ii) the innervation pattern, and
(iii) the ontogenetic establishment of the nervous supply
of the operculum and the radioles. In Spirorbis, the
number of tentacles increases during development, resulting in an asymmetric branchial crown comprising five
radioles on the right side and four on the left side in adult
specimens [53,70]. In addition, classical studies have
shown that development of the operculum is retarded
compared to the radioles [71-73]. Indeed, the neuronal
rudiments of the branchial crown are formed prior to the
ones of the operculum. However, the differentiation of
the opercular neurons advances more rapidly during subsequent development, with the opercular nerve lining the
entire peduncle even before the radiole nerves differentiate (Figure 6B). In addition, exactly the same number of
radioles and pinnules arises on both sides (Figure 6C).
Accordingly, we regard the asymmetric arrangement in the
adult a secondary condition, probably constrained by limited space in the cephalic region rather than being the
result of evolutionary transformation events of a radiole
into an operculum.
The general neural architecture of Spirorbis shows that
each radiole comprises three nerves [[68], present study].
A similar condition has been described for Pomatoceros,
where two nerves are situated in the abfrontal corners
("external branchial nerves") and a third one frontally in
close proximity to the food groove ("internal branchial
nerve"; [60,68]). Thereby, the abfrontal nerves lie outside
the basement membrane of the epidermis, whereas the
frontal nerve lies just inside the basement membrane. All
three branchial nerves send branches into the pinnules.
This tripartite arrangement has been documented for
Pomatoceros not only for the radioles and pinnules, but
also for the peduncle [68]. At the top of the peduncle the
internal and external peduncular nerves enter the operculum through a small, single gap. There, all three nerves
furcate, thus giving rise to numerous small branches
which can be traced to the rim surrounding the distal pole
of the operculum [68]. This tripartite arrangement in both
the radioles and the operculum is in accordance with the
hypothesis of Müller [23]. Hanson [68] described three
branchial nerves also for other serpulid species such as
Vermiliopsis, Protula, Salmacina and Hydroides, but he did
not mention explicitly the neuronal innervation of the
peduncle. Only for Hydroides he clearly stated that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/270

internal and external peduncular nerves are similar to
those of the filaments of Pomatoceros. However, in juvenile
S. spirorbis, there are no three parallel nerves present in the
peduncle. Instead, a single nerve loop lines the margin of
the opercular stalk. Furthermore, the two strands of this
nerve loop do not lie close together at the transition
between the peduncle and the operculum. Accordingly,
the number, spatial distribution, and site of emergence of
the opercular nerves in Spirorbis are unique and do not
correspond to the situation found in the radioles and in
the opercular peduncle of Pomatoceros and Hydroides.
Probably the most striking argument against a shared evolutionary ancestry of the radioles and the operculum in
Spirorbis is revealed when the cerebral innervation sites of
both structures are compared. While the opercular nerves
appear to emerge from the dorsal commissures of the cerebral ganglion, the two main nerve bundles of the radioles
are associated with the ventral part of the cerebral ganglion. The nerves of the radioles show no connection to
the opercular nerves. The innervation of anterior appendages in the Serpulidae has been already investigated in
detail for selected species, albeit not in Spirorbis, and used
for homology assessments [8]. Based on his findings,
Orrhage described ten different nerve roots of the
branchial crown that partly originate from the ventral and
partly from the dorsal commissures on either side of the
cerebrum, before finally forming one anterior branchial
crown nerve. It might be that one or more of these nerve
roots have gained new functions in spirorbin taxa that
brood in their operculum [22]. The resolution of the data
presented herein does not allow for unambiguous distinction of individual nerve roots. The question whether this
is due to limitations of the used immunolabeling techniques or a lack of differentiation in early developmental
stages has to be left open. Orrhage [8] does not explicitly
describe the innervation of the operculum in Spirorbis.
Nethertheless, we expect that the neuronal root of the
operculum would be merged with the other nerve roots to
form a single branchial crown nerve in adults, in case that
the operculum represents indeed a modified radiole.
The most recent phylogenetic studies propose that
Hydroides belongs to the Serpula-clade, the sister group of
the Pomatoceros-clade (Figure 1B). This implies that the
operculum with three peduncular nerves, that evolved
from a radiole of the branchial crown, is most likely a
shared character of these two sister clades. So far, nothing
is known about the neuronal innervation of the operculum in species of the Protula-clade, where some of its
members do not even have an operculum. Therefore, any
final conclusions about the ancestral condition of the
operculum at the base of the serpulid tree are premature.
In principal, several scenarios appear possible in the light
of the current phylogenetic hypothesis (Figure 1B): 1)

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:270

opercula evolved at least twice independently, once in the
Serpula/Pomatoceros-clade and once in the Protula/Spirorbinae-clade, 2) the operculum was lost at the base of the
Spirorbinae, and secondarily evolved again within this
group as an independent opercular structure, or (3) the
operculum is a shared ancestral feature of the Serpulidae
that was - together with its neural innervation pattern secondarily modified in the descending lineages. Based
on our data on the neural innervation pattern of the operculum in Spirorbis we favour the former alternative,
although additional comparative data on the developmental programme (e.g., gene expression analysis) that
underlies radiole and operculum formation in the respective serpulid clades are needed to finally settle this issue.

Conclusion
Our data suggest that the operculum in Spirorbis is not a
derivative of the branchial crown but an independent
structure which originates from the bodywall around the
mouth. These findings corroborate a recent molecular
phylogenetic study that suggests convergent evolution of
direct operculum development, once at the base of the
Pomatoceros-group and once along the line leading to the
Spirorbinae [24]. In addition, the new data on radiole and
operculum innervation presented herein strongly argue
for the following scenario:
1. The operculum of Spirorbis is a prostomial appendage
and does not belong to the branchial crown. It is thus not
homologous to the radioles.
2. The operculum of Spirorbis is not homologous to the
opercula of Serpula, Hydroides and Pomatoceros. In the latter three, the operculum is indeed likely to have a shared
evolutionary origin with the radioles. Therefore, the opercula of Serpula, Hydroides and Pomatoceros are considered
homologous to each other.
Based on our data we predict that future neuroanatomical
and developmental studies of the branchial crown of
selected species, especially of the Protula-clade (including
the former Filograninae), will further contribute to our
understanding of both the evolution of opercular structures in serpulid polychaetes and will also aid in our quest
for the eventual placement of this group within the annelid phylogenetic tree.

Methods
Animals
Adult specimens of Spirorbis cf. spirorbis were collected in
the intertidal around Roscoff, France, in June 2006 and
2007, respectively. The calcareous tubes were crushed
with tweezers under a stereo microscope in order to
obtain the egg strings which contained embryos of various
developmental stages (Figure 1A). Developmental stages

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/270

(encapsulated embryos, free-swimming larvae, settled larvae, and juveniles) were cultured in embryo dishes at 1719°C in Millipore-filtered seawater (MFSW). Prior to fixation, the specimens were anesthetized in a 1:1 dilution of
MFSW and MgCl2 (7%). They were then fixed at room
temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (PB) for 1.5-3 h or overnight at 4°C, washed three
times in PB, and stored at 4°C in PB containing 0.1%
NaN3. Tubed juveniles were decalcified in 50 mM EGTA
and washed thrice in PB prior to storage at 4°C.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Stored animals were washed in distilled water, postfixed
in 1% osmium tetroxide, washed twice in distilled water,
and dehydrated in a graded alcohol series. After critical
point drying in acetone, the samples were mounted on
SEM stubs, sputter-coated with gold-palladium, and analyzed with a JEOL JSM-6335-F SEM (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
Immunolabeling
The following steps were all performed at 4°C. Antibody
staining was preceded by tissue permeabilization for 1 h
in 0.1 M PB with 0.1% NaN3 and 0.1% Triton X-100
(PTA), followed by incubation in block-PTA [6% normal
goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in PTA]
overnight. The primary antibodies, polyclonal rabbit antiserotonin (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA, dilution
1:800), polyclonal rabbit anti-FMRFamide (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA, dilution 1:400), and monoclonal
mouse anti-acetylated α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, dilution
1:1000), all in block-PTA, were either applied separately
or in a mixed cocktail for 24 h. Subsequently, specimens
were rinsed in block-PTA with three changes over 6 h and
incubated thereafter with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole
[DAPI (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA)] and secondary
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies [goat anti-rabbit
FITC (Sigma-Aldrich), dilution 1:400; goat anti-rabbit
Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen), dilution 1:1000; goat antimouse FITC (Sigma-Aldrich), dilution 1:400] in blockPTA for 12-20 h. Finally, the specimens were washed three
times in PB without NaN3, once in distilled water, and
thereafter dehydrated through a graded ethanol series
(30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 3 × 100%), cleared with
benzyl benzoate:benzyl alcohol (2:1), and mounted on
glass slides.
Confocal laserscanning microscopy and 3D reconstruction
Immunolabeled specimens were analyzed for each antibody separately for a minimum of 10 individuals per
developmental stage. Altogether, about 60 image stacks of
optical sections were recorded as Z-wide-projections with
0.1-0.5 μm step size using a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescence
microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP 2 confocal laserscanning unit (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The Z-stacks
were projected into maximum intensity pixel as well as

depth-coded images. In addition, corresponding light
micrographs were recorded for most specimens. The
three-dimensional computer reconstructions were generated with the imaging software Imaris v. 5.5.3 (Bitplane,
Zürich, Switzerland) using surface rendering algorithms.
Image adjustment was done with Adobe Photoshop CS2
and arrangements of plates with Adobe Illustrator CS3
(Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).
