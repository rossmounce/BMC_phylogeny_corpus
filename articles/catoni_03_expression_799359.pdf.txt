Abstract
Background: Arginine and citrulline serve as nitrogen storage forms, but are also involved in
biosynthetic and catabolic pathways. Metabolism of arginine, citrulline and ornithine is distributed
between mitochondria and cytosol. For the shuttle of intermediates between cytosol and
mitochondria transporters present on the inner mitochondrial membrane are required. Yeast
contains a mitochondrial translocator for ornithine and arginine, Ort1p/Arg11p. Ort1p/Arg11p is
a member of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) essential for ornithine export from
mitochondria. The yeast arg11 mutant, which is deficient in Ort1p/Arg11p grows poorly on media
lacking arginine.
Results: High-level expression of a nuclear encoded Arabidopsis thaliana homolog (AtmBAC2) of
Ort1p/Arg11p was able to suppress the growth deficiency of arg11. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated
expression of AtmBAC2 in all tissues with highest levels in flowers. Promoter-GUS fusions showed
preferential expression in flowers, i.e. pollen, in the vasculature of siliques and in aborted seeds.
Variable expression was observed in leaf vasculature. Induction of the promoter was not observed
during the first two weeks in seedlings grown on media containing NH4NO3, arginine or ornithine
as sole nitrogen sources.
Conclusion: AtmBAC2 was isolated as a mitochondrial transporter for arginine in Arabidopsis.
The absence of expression in developing seeds and in cotyledons of seedlings indicates that other
transporters are responsible for storage and mobilization of arginine in seeds.

Background
In most organisms, amino acid metabolism is distributed
between at least two compartments: cytosol and mitochondria. In addition, plastids contribute significantly to
amino acid metabolism of plants [1]. For instance in

plants, biosynthesis, conversion and degradation of arginine, ornithine and citrulline are distributed across mitochondria, plastids and cytosol [2].

In many plants, arginine is stored in seeds as a major nitrogen source, e.g. in Arabidopsis thaliana arginine accounts for 11% of total seed nitrogen [2]. During seed
germination, stored arginine is degraded for conversion
into transport forms (e.g. glutamine or glutamate). The
enzyme arginase, which catalyzes degradation of arginine
to ornithine and urea is localized in mitochondria [3].
Thus arginine needs to be imported into mitochondria to
allow mobilization. Transport steps across the mitochondrial membranes are also required during biosynthesis. In
yeast, ornithine, a precursor of arginine, is synthesized in
mitochondria from glutamate, which is imported from
the cytosol. Ornithine is transferred to the cytosol before
conversion to arginine. Additionally, arginine needs to be
imported into mitochondria to allow mitochondrial protein synthesis. Ornithine serves as an intermediate of arginine and proline metabolism, and of the ureide
citrulline. In plants, ornithine serves also a precursor for
polyamine and alkaloid biosynthesis [4]. Thus also in various other metabolic pathways, transport of arginine, ornithine and also citrulline is required. Although
mitochondrial in- and efflux of citrulline was originally
described in rat liver and heart [5], it has not been described in plants.
Thus for metabolite exchange and coordination of all
these pathways, multiple carriers must be present on the
inner mitochondrial membrane of the different organisms. In the yeast genome, 35 members of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) were identified; 12 of them
were characterized in terms of substrate specificity [6].
MCF proteins have similar structural features: a relatively
low molecular mass of around 30 kDa, a tripartite structure (three repeats of about 100 amino acids), each consisting of two transmembrane-helices separated by a
hydrophilic loop. Furthermore, a consensus sequence [PX-(DE)-X-(LIVAT)-(RK)-X-(LRH)-(LIVMFY)], called the
"mitochondrial energy signature", is present in all carriers
in one to three copies at the C-terminal end of the first helix of each repeat [7]. Most transporters belonging to this
family function as antiporters. A combination of transport
studies in mitochondria [8,9] and reconstitution of carriers expressed in E. coli lead to the identification of the first
mammalian mitochondrial carrier gene belonging to the
MCF family [10]. Since then, mitochondrial transporter
genes encoding various predicted transport systems have
been identified in yeast and human genomes [11–14].
The Arabidopsis genome contains at least 48 members of
the MCF family, 7 with 3 copies of the mitochondrial energy transfer signature, 21 with two copies and 20 with
one copy. Until now, only few plant MCF carriers have
been characterized [11]: the adenine nucleotide translocators [15,16], uncoupling proteins [17,18] and recently
also a dicarboxylate-tricarboxylate carrier named DTC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/3/1

[19] and a succinate transporter [20]. However, despite
their importance none of the postulated plant mitochondrial transporters for amino acids has been identified,
such as proline transporters for the compartmentalized
proline metabolism [21], GABA transporters for the GABA
shunt [22], glutamate/aspartate transporters for photorespiratory exchange with peroxisomes or ornithine/arginine
carriers for arginine metabolism that were biochemically
characterized in isolated soybean mitochondria [3].
A yeast arg11 mutant unable to synthesize arginine was
identified [23]. The corresponding gene was cloned by
complementation of the arg 11 mutant, revealing that
Arg11p is a member of MCF. On the basis of amino acids
content of the mutant, it was suggested that ARG11p
would function as an mitochondrial ornithine translocator of yeast [24]. The properties of Ort1p were characterized after expression in E. coli and subsequent
reconstitution. The major function of Ort1p/Arg11p is ornithine export from mitochondria. Ort1p/Arg11p mediates electroneutral antiport of ornithine, arginine and
lysine, and with lower efficiency also ornithine/H+ antiport [25]. Since mitochondria of an arg11 deletion mutant retained arginine/ornithine carrier activity, a second
transporter for basic amino acids named Bac1 was postulated [26]. Sequence homologies to the yeast gene were
used to identify the human ORNT1 transporter and to
demonstrate that the HHH syndrome (Hyperornithinaemia-Hyperammoniaemia-Homocitrullinuria) is due to
defects in the respective gene [27]. In the case of citrullinaemia, a different member of the MCF family was defective [28], namely the aspartate/glutamate carrier [29]. Yet
another amino acid carrier identified by reconstitution in
liposomes was the human glutamate transporter [14].
However in yeast, and despite extensive attempts, none of
the crucial carriers for amino acids or other metabolites
was identified in genetic studies apart from arg11, acr1
and dic1, i.e. mutants have been found for all metabolic
steps in many of the amino acid pathways but not the respective mutations in mitochondrial carriers. Since the
yeast genome contains a large number of MCF proteins
one may hypothesize that transporters have overlapping
substrate specificities and yeast may thus be able to compensate loss of single MCF genes.
To date, the most efficient approach to identify plant plasma membrane transporters has been suppression cloning
in yeast mutants. Since in most cases mitochondrial transporters do not contain identifiable targeting sequences, it
remained open whether yeast complementation may be a
suitable tool to identify the plant homologs. Searches in
the Arabidopsis genome identified a gene 32% identical
to the yeast Ort1p/Arg11p. The Arabidopsis gene
AtmBAC2, when expressed in yeast, was able to restore
growth of the yeast arg11 mutant on media lacking ar-

ginine, indicating that AtmBAC2 catalyzes the export of
ornithine from mitochondria to the cytosol. RT-PCR analysis and promoter-GUS fusions were used to study expression and regulation of AtmBAC2. Absence of expression in
developing seeds and in cotyledons of seedlings indicated
that, in addition to AtmBAC2, another transporter, supposedly AtmBAC1 [30], is involved in storage and mobilization of arginine.

Results and Discussion
Complementation of the yeast arg11 mutant by a plant
cDNA
The yeast mutant arg11 is bradytrophic for arginine, due
to deletion of the mitochondrial transporter for ornithine,
an intermediate in arginine metabolism [24]. To identify
a corresponding Arabidopsis transporter gene, the arg11
yeast mutant was transformed with an Arabidopsis cDNA
library in the yeast expression vector pFL61 [31]. Around
106 transformants were screened for growth on a medium
lacking arginine. Potentially due to the background
growth of the bradytroph mutant, no genes able to complement the yeast arg11 mutant were found. Therefore, a
homology search was carried out with the ORT1p/Arg11p
sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae against the predicted protein sequences encoded by the Arabidopsis genome
and in the Aramemnon [32] integral membrane protein
database http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de. Two

putative proteins AtmBAC1 and AtmBAC2 encoded by
the loci At5g46800 and At1g79900 respectively scored
highest similarity values. By RT-PCR, the AtmBAC2 cDNA
corresponding to the locus At1g79900 was cloned.
AtmBAC2 encodes a protein of 296 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32 kDa that shares 32% identity and 52% similarity with the yeast ORT1p/Arg11p
protein. Hydrophobicity analysis of the polypeptide
(HMMTOP 2.0; http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/) predicted six putative membrane spanning domains, consistent with the known structures of MCF carriers [33]. Six
other programs predict between zero (soluble) and five
transmembrane spans [32]. In general, the prediction of
transmembrane spans in case of MCF carriers is problematic since hydrophobic domains are present, however,
confidence levels are below the assumed critical value.
Thus, such proteins would be missing from databases,
which rely solely on membrane protein predictions. The
structural prediction is supported by the presence of "mitochondrial energy transfer signatures" after the first,
third, and fifth transmembrane domains. The combination of homology searches, hydrophobicity analysis and
the presence of the signature motif indicate that AtmBAC2
comprises all features of the mitochondrial carrier family
(Fig. 1). AtmBAC2 does not contain a predicted targeting
sequence for import into mitochondria, similar to many

other mitochondrial proteins belonging to the MCF family.
The AtmBAC2 cDNA was cloned in the yeast vectors
pFL61, containing the PGK promoter, and pDR195, with
the stronger PMA1 promoter fragment. When expressed
from the PMA1 promoter, AtmBAC2 was able to efficiently complement the yeast arginine bradytrophy (Fig. 2).
Similar experiments using the comparatively weaker PGK
promoter showed only weak complementation, i.e. slower growth as compared to cells expressing AtmBAC2 under
control of the PMA1 promoter (data not shown). To study
the substrate specificity, AtmBAC2 was fused to a his-tag
and the fusion protein was expressed under the strong
PMA1 promoter fragment in yeast. Mitochondria were
isolated and AtmBAC2 was purified as a 32 kDa polypeptide (data not shown). Functional reconstitution can be
used to characterize the properties of AtmBAC2 in detail
[12]. In a parallel study, Hoyos et al. [30] identified
AtmBAC1, a closely related ornithine transporter.
AtmBAC1 was successfully reconstituted into artificial
proteoliposomes and was able to carry out ornithine/ornithine exchange as well as exchange of various amino acids against arginine. AtmBAC1 showed a preference for

basic amino acids with highest affinity for arginine and
lysine, but transported also histidine. Thus AtmBAC1,
similar to many other characterized MCF transporters, is
promiscuous. This may reflect that transporters do not
have a binding pocket, but filtering and recognition probably take place along the translocation pathway within
the pore. From an evolutionary perspective, the low selectivity may be advantageous since mutations would allow
rapid adaptation to changes in compartmentation of metabolism. However, the modulation of substrate specificity makes it difficult to define the physiological function
based only on the sequence. The promiscuity may also explain why so far only few mutants in mitochondrial carrier functions have been identified, e.g. arg11 in yeast or the
disease related HHH syndrome.
So far, the most efficient methodology to characterize mitochondrial transporters was a candidate gene approach.
Candidates were expressed in E. coli [19], purified proteins were reconstituted in lipid vesicles and transport
properties were determined [34]. The approach is difficult
and laborious and no standard protocols applicable for all
candidates are available [12]. Therefore, an alternative
method was developed allowing identification of mito-

chondrial carriers via suppression of auxo- or bradytrophic phenotypes of yeast mutants. Although there is no
evidence for a mitochondrial targeting sequence in the
AtmBAC2 sequence, and little is known about signals for
import of nuclear encoded proteins in the mitochondria
of yeast and plants, the yeast import mechanisms are able
to recognize also plant mitochondrial proteins and target
them to mitochondria. In this way, the identification of
AtmBAC2 and of AtmBAC1 [30] from Arabidopsis as ornithine carriers confirms the validity of yeast complementation for the functional assignment of candidate genes.
Phylogenetic tree of MCF translocators
A detailed analysis of transporter databases indicates that
the Arabidopsis MCF family is highly divergent and a full
alignment showed only eight perfectly conserved residues. Since a similarity tree branches into two major
clades plus a few single and very distantly related members, the phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the
subgroup containing the amino acid transporters, several
other Arabidopsis MCF members and selected fungal and
mammalian members falling into the same branch (Fig.
3). These selected polypeptides can be classified into six
major clades: (i) amino acid carriers, (ii) two clades of diand tricarboxylate carriers, (iii) uncoupling proteins
(UCPs), and (iv) at least two groups of carriers for which
no function has been assigned yet (Fig. 3). Within the
amino acid carriers, the Saccharomyces Ort1p/Arg11p and
related transporters from Neurospora and Aspergillus are
most closely related to the Arabidopsis AtmBAC2 and
AtmBAC1, whereas glutamate and glutamate/asparate carriers are more distantly related [14,29]. No other Arabidopsis proteins fall into this clade. Interestingly, the
mammalian carnitine transporter [35] also belongs to the
amino acid carrier clade, being more closely related to the
basic amino acid transporters. Since so far no evidence exists for carnitine transport in plants, one may predict that
the other members of this clade and those belonging to
the groups of unknown transporters may be candidates
for the missing carrier involved in amino acid transport
functions in mitochondria.
Expression pattern of AtmBAC2 in Arabidopsis
To study the expression pattern of AtmBAC2, total RNA
was extracted from different tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana
plants grown in soil. As the expression level was too low
to be detected by RNA gel blot analysis, RT-PCR was carried out. AtmBAC2 expression was found in all tissues analyzed, with highest transcript levels in flowers (Fig. 4a).
To investigate a potential influence of the nitrogen source
on the expression of AtmBAC2, RT-PCR was carried out on
mRNA extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on nitrogen-free MS medium supplemented with different inorganic and organic nitrogen sources NH4NO3, arginine
or ornithine. Material was harvested at different develop-

mental stages. AtmBAC2 was expressed at higher levels in
a medium supplemented with arginine or ornithine as
compared to NH4NO3 (Fig. 4b). A slight increase in expression was observed also under conditions of nitrogen
starvation (Fig. 4b). The regulation and expression pattern
are compatible with a role of AtmBAC2 in arginine and
ornithine catabolism of mitochondria.
To study the tissue specificity in more detail, the AtmBAC2
promoter region was isolated. The promoter was cloned
as a longer 2 kb and a shorter 1.5 kb fragment as transcriptional fusions with GUS. In both cases, the expression pattern of independent transformants was comparable.
While expression was undetectable in seedlings, first GUS
activity was detectable in three-weeks-old plants (Fig.
5A,5B,5C,5D,5E). The discrepancy between promoterGUS analysis and RT-PCR in seedlings may be due to
higher sensitivity of the RT-PCR or due to missing regulatory elements present e.g. in the intron of AtmBAC2. Leaf
veins showed patchy staining, in some cases at the leaf
rims (Fig. 5F,5G). Consistent with RT-PCR, histochemical
GUS analysis showed elevated expression levels in flowers, specifically in stamens and petals (Fig. 5H,5I), and
both developing and germinating pollen (Fig. 5J, data not
shown). Furthermore, expression was observed in siliques
in the main vasculature and in aborted seeds, but not in
developing seeds (Fig. 5K,5L,5M).
Basic amino acid transporters in the inner mitochondrial
membrane are supposed to play roles in arginine metabolism in developing seedlings and during the mobilization
of proteins, e.g. during seed germination. Unexpectedly,
no expression was found in developing seeds or in young
seedlings during germination, suggesting that a different
carrier, potentially AtmBAC1, might be responsible for
these processes [30]. Proline represents by far the most
abundant amino acid in pollen [36]. Thus the expression
of AtmBAC2 in pollen may be taken as a hint that arginine
can serve as a precursor for proline biosynthesis, since arginase is localized in mitochondria, and thus arginine has
to be taken up into mitochondria. Alternatively, the expression pattern may also be relevant for other metabolic
pathways since ornithine can also serve as a precursor for
polyamine and alkaloid biosynthesis [4].

Conclusions
Functional expression of a candidate gene under control
of a strong promoter allowed identification of a plant mitochondrial transporter for basic amino acids. This carrier
seems to have overlapping, but different functions as
AtmBAC1 in the plant. The study also pinpoints candidates for the missing amino acid transport systems in
plant mitochondria. RNAi studies together with knock-out
mutants will enable a detailed physiological characterization of the mitochondrial compartmentation of amino

additional carriers for organellar compartmentation.

Methods
Yeast strains
The yeast strain Y02386 [Matα; his3∆1; leu2∆0; lys2∆0;
ura3∆0; YOR130c::kanMX4] from Euroscarf (Frankfurt,
Germany), carrying a deletion of the yeast gene ARG11,
was used for yeast complementation. Selective conditions
for Y02386 were established by using yeast nitrogen base
without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco, Heidelberg, Germany) supplemented with (mg L-1): 5000
(NH4)2SO4, 20 histidine, 100 leucine, 20 methionine
with 2% glucose and eventually 50 uracil in case of untransformed yeast. As negative control Y02386 was transformed with the empty vector pDR195 [38].

Cloning of the AtmBAC2 gene and yeast transformation
AtmBAC2 cDNA was amplified by PCR on an Arabidopsis
cDNA library (ecotype Landsberg; [31]) using primers
spanning the predicted ORF from ATG to stop: 5'-agcctcgagatggatttctggccggagtttatg, containing a XhoI restriction
site and 5'-ttcggatcctcaatctcctgtgacaatatc, containing a
BamHI restriction site. The PCR product was restricted
with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into the yeast expression
vector pDR195. The resulting plasmid was amplified in E.
coli DH5 and transferred into Y02386, according to Gietz
et al. [39]. cDNA and protein sequence were deposited in
Genbank under the accession number AC011717_10.
Plant material and mRNA expression
Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. ecotype Col-0 was used for
plant studies. For organ specificity studies, all plant organs
were harvested from plants grown in soil in the greenhouse with the exception of roots, which were obtained
from plants cultured on MS agar plates. For expression

gene (AtACT2) was simultaneously amplified by 20 PCR
cycles [40]. Identity of the amplicons was confirmed by
sequencing.

different developmental stages, plants or organs were harvested and stained for GUS activity. Seedlings were grown
on solid MS plates. Histochemical assays for β-glucuronidase activity in transgenic plants were performed as described in Martin et al. [43]. Tissues were incubated for
~18 h at 37°C in staining solution containing (mM) 100
