Abstract
Background: Members of the pine family (Pinaceae), especially species of spruce (Picea spp.) and
pine (Pinus spp.), dominate many of the world's temperate and boreal forests. These conifer forests
are of critical importance for global ecosystem stability and biodiversity. They also provide the
majority of the world's wood and fiber supply and serve as a renewable resource for other
industrial biomaterials. In contrast to angiosperms, functional and comparative genomics research
on conifers, or other gymnosperms, is limited by the lack of a relevant reference genome sequence.
Sequence-finished full-length (FL)cDNAs and large collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
are essential for gene discovery, functional genomics, and for future efforts of conifer genome
annotation.
Results: As part of a conifer genomics program to characterize defense against insects and
adaptation to local environments, and to discover genes for the production of biomaterials, we
developed 20 standard, normalized or full-length enriched cDNA libraries from Sitka spruce (P.
sitchensis), white spruce (P. glauca), and interior spruce (P. glauca-engelmannii complex). We
sequenced and analyzed 206,875 3'- or 5'-end ESTs from these libraries, and developed a resource
of 6,464 high-quality sequence-finished FLcDNAs from Sitka spruce. Clustering and assembly of
147,146 3'-end ESTs resulted in 19,941 contigs and 26,804 singletons, representing 46,745 putative
unique transcripts (PUTs). The 6,464 FLcDNAs were all obtained from a single Sitka spruce
genotype and represent 5,718 PUTs.

Conclusion: This paper provides detailed annotation and quality assessment of a large EST and
FLcDNA resource for spruce. The 6,464 Sitka spruce FLcDNAs represent the third largest
sequence-verified FLcDNA resource for any plant species, behind only rice (Oryza sativa) and
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and the only substantial FLcDNA resource for a gymnosperm.
Our emphasis on capturing FLcDNAs and ESTs from cDNA libraries representing herbivore-,
wound- or elicitor-treated induced spruce tissues, along with incorporating normalization to
capture rare transcripts, resulted in a rich resource for functional genomics and proteomics
studies. Sequence comparisons against five plant genomes and the non-redundant GenBank protein
database revealed that a substantial number of spruce transcripts have no obvious similarity to
known angiosperm gene sequences. Opportunities for future applications of the sequence and
clone resources for comparative and functional genomics are discussed.

Background
Conifers (members of the pine family) have very large
genomes (10 to 40 Gb, [1]), and this poses difficulties for
both structural and functional genomic studies. In addition, their generation times are long and their habitual
out-breeding nature prevents the development of inbred
strains useful for genetics research. A further difficulty in
conifer genomics is the large evolutionary distance
between conifers and angiosperms (i.e., flowering plants),
separated by 300 million years of evolution [2], which
severely restricts gene comparisons of conifers with
angiosperms. While there are several completely
sequenced angiosperm genomes, as well as high-quality
sequence-finished full-length (FL)cDNA resources, for
Arabidopsis [3,4], rice [5-7], poplar (Populus trichocarpa;
[8,9]), grapevine (Vitis vinifera; [10]), and a moss (Physcomitrella patens; [11]), these basic genomics resources
have not yet been developed for the conifer phyla or for
any other gymnosperm.
In species with large genomes, a critical first step for
genome characterization is to survey the expressed genes.
A common approach to characterize the expressed
genome is to sequence cDNA libraries and to assemble
large collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [12]. In
the absence of a conifer genome sequence, large and deep
EST collections are particularly useful. Sequencing of
cDNA libraries constructed from diverse tissues and developmental stages, and from materials subjected to diverse
environmental conditions or treatments, enhances the
diversity of genes captured in EST populations. In addition, normalization techniques reduce the frequency of
highly expressed genes and increase the rate of rare gene
discovery [13,14], thus providing more comprehensive
coverage of the expressed genome.
In conifers, gene discovery via EST sequencing was first
conducted in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda; [15]), the most
economically important tree species in the southeastern
USA. The early emphasis in loblolly pine was on wood
forming tissues [16], but newer projects have involved

treatments such as drought stress [17] and embryogenesis
[18]. As of May 2008, the loblolly pine EST collection contains more than 328,000 sequences [19]. Recent EST
projects with species of spruce have used tissues related to
shoot growth and xylem development in white spruce
[20,21], wound treatment in interior spruce [21], root
development in Sitka spruce [21], and xylem development and bud burst in Norway spruce (P. abies; [22,23]).
EST resources have also been developed for a few other
gymnosperm species outside of the pine family, such as
cycas (Cycas rumphii; [24]), ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba; [25]),
Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata; [26]), Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica; [27,28]) and Hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa; [28]).
In addition to deep EST sampling, other important components of a cDNA sequence resource are the quality and
length of sequence coverage for a given gene. Ideally,
FLcDNA clones that capture the entire mature transcript of
a gene should be identified and completely sequenced
with high accuracy. FLcDNA sequences should span not
only the protein-coding open reading frame (ORF) region
but also the non-coding 5' and 3' untranslated regions
(UTRs). Most importantly, true FLcDNA sequences
should be derived from a single individual FLcDNA clone.
Using individual clones prevents the assembly of chimeric
FLcDNA sequences consisting of ESTs from multiple
cDNA clones representing closely related genes. Furthermore, allelic nucleotide polymorphisms and alternatively
spliced variants of a gene are difficult to detect using in silico assembled sequence contigs from multiple clones. To
further discriminate among closely related genes, the
authenticity of sequences should be verified by resequencing of the same clone (sequence verification).
Compared to single-pass ESTs or in silico assembled
sequence contigs originating from multiple clones,
sequence-verified FLcDNA clones offer several advantages
for comparative, structural, and functional genome analyses, in particular for conifers with their great evolutionary
distance from angiosperms. First, the complete proteincoding regions of FLcDNAs can be unambiguously identiPage 2 of 17

fied. An accurate prediction of full-length protein
sequences aides in the correct identification of distant
angiosperm homologues. Second, in anticipation of a
future conifer genome sequence, FLcDNAs can be used to
improve gene prediction from genomic sequences as demonstrated in Arabidopsis [29-31] and poplar [8,9]. Third,
FLcDNA clones can be used for functional characterization of conifer genes using biochemical approaches [e.g.,
[32,33]] or for functional complementation of mutants in
heterologous systems. Given the lack of knock-out
mutants in conifers and the slow process of generating
knock-down mutants in conifers, biochemical approaches
and heterologous complementation that rely on FLcDNA
clones are essential tools for functional genomics in conifers. Finally, FLcDNAs can be used to accurately identify
peptides in large-scale conifer proteome analyses [34,35].
Despite their immense value, sequence-verified FLcDNA
clones have not been generated in most plant species subjected to genome analysis. Only a few resources of large
and sequence-verified FLcDNA data sets have been generated for angiosperm plant species; namely, for Arabidopsis [4], rice [7], and poplar [9]. In contrast, no substantial
FLcDNA resource has been reported for a conifer or any
other gymnosperm species. The Conifer Forest Health
genomics project "Treenomix" [36] aims to develop
genomic resources for spruce, characterize mechanisms of
resistance against insect pests and adaptation to local
environments, and identify genes for the formation of oleoresin-based terpenoid biomaterials [37-43]. Here, we
report on a comprehensive spruce EST and FLcDNA
resource and discuss its utility for conifer genomics. A
total of 206,875 ESTs were obtained by sequencing 20
standard, normalized or full-length cDNA libraries
derived from Sitka spruce, white spruce, and interior
spruce. Analysis of ESTs identified 46,745 putative unique
transcripts (PUTs). We describe advantages covered by the
first large set of 6,464 sequence-verified, high-quality
FLcDNAs obtained from a single clonally propagated tree
of Sitka spruce.

Results
Sequencing and assembly of spruce ESTs
We constructed 20 unidirectional standard, normalized or
full-length enriched cDNA libraries from various tissues,
developmental stages, and stress treatments of Sitka
spruce, white spruce and interior spruce (Table 1). Several
libraries were made from trees subjected to insect feeding
by white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi) or spruce budworms
(Choristoneura occidentalis), or to herbivory-simulation
treatments such as mechanical wounding or methyl jasmonate application. From these libraries, we obtained
206,875 EST sequences, consisting of 165,403 3'-end EST
sequences and 41,472 5'-end EST sequences (Table 2). We
initially focused on 3'-end sequencing. Subsequent

sequence reads from 5'-ends were performed as paired
end reads, primarily from clones derived from FLcDNA
libraries, to support the identification of a non-redundant
FLcDNA set for complete insert sequencing. Removing
low-quality and vector sequences (see Table 2 for criteria),
as well as any obvious contaminant sequences, provided
a database containing 147,146 high-quality (hq) 3' ESTs
(88.9% success rate) with an average read length of 656
bp (Table 2). When we analyzed the 147,146 hq 3'-end
ESTs using the CAP3 program ([44]; assembly criteria:
95% identity, 40 bp window), 120,342 ESTs assembled
into 19,941 contigs and the remaining 26,804 ESTs were
classified as singletons, suggesting a combined total of
46,745 PUTs across Sitka spruce, white spruce and interior
spruce (Table 2). On average, contigs contained six assembled EST sequences. Only 88 contigs consisted of greater
than 50 ESTs. The five largest contigs contain 618 (aspartyl protease), 229 (ribulose biphosphate carboxylase
small subunit), 222 (metallothionein), 209 (translationally controlled tumor protein) and 172 (no significant
match) ESTs. The proportion of EST sequences from
organelles was small. Known and putative mitochondrial
and chloroplast sequences contribute only 285 (0.19%)
and 787 (0.53%) ESTs to the entire data set, respectively.
In separate species-specific assemblies using ESTs from
only white spruce or Sitka spruce, we identified 23,963
PUTs (72,649 3'-end EST sequences, 10,948 contigs and
13,015 singletons) and 17,988 PUTs (49,198 3'-end EST
sequences, 6,918 contigs and 11,070 singletons), respectively.
Gene discovery in normalized and non-normalized cDNA
libraries
From each of the 20 cDNA libraries, between 1,536 and
24,959 clones were 3'-end sequenced, with the rate of hq
sequences ranging from 77.1% to 94.1% and an average
EST length of 532 bp to 756 bp in each library (Additional
File 1). The rate of gene discovery for each library was
assessed from: (1) the number of unique transcripts
sequenced from each library; (2) the average number of
EST sequences forming contigs; (3) the percentage of ESTs
with no similarity to protein sequences in the non-redundant (NR) database of GenBank using BLASTX; (4) the
percentage of singleton ESTs; and (5) the percentage of
library-specific transcripts. Based on these criteria, all but
two of the normalized libraries (i.e., WS-SE-N-A-18 and
WS-SE-N-A-19) showed considerably higher rates of gene
discovery, and hence higher complexity, than the corresponding non-normalized libraries (Additional File 1).
For example, among the six successfully normalized EST
libraries, the percentage of unique transcripts identified
within the first 1,000 reads averaged 94.7% (92.7% to
95.9%), whereas among the seven corresponding standard EST libraries made from the same RNA samples, the
average was only 78.8% (73.8% to 85.6%). The diversity

of starting biological materials combined with normalization resulted in low sequence redundancy demonstrated
by the presence of only three PUTs (derived from 3'-end
ESTs) sequenced in all of the 20 cDNA libraries (Table 3).
These three transcripts were identified as translationally
controlled tumor protein (209 ESTs), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (115 ESTs) and S-adenosylmethionine synthase (104 ESTs).
Quality assessment of FLcDNAs
FLcDNAs are defined as individual cDNA clones that contain the complete ORF coding sequence as well as at least
partial 5' and 3' UTRs for a given transcript. We prepared
three FLcDNA libraries using the biotinylated cap trapper
method [45]. All FLcDNA libraries were made from insectinduced tissues of a single Sitka spruce genotype (Table
1). From these libraries, we identified 8,127 cDNA candi-

date clones for complete insert sequencing, which
resulted in 6,464 hq sequence-verified FLcDNA clones
(Additional File 2). Analysis of the 6,464 FLcDNA
sequences using the CAP3 program ([44]; assembly criteria: 95% identity, 40 bp window) identified 5,197 FLcDNAs as singletons, with the remaining 1,267 grouping
into 521 contigs, suggesting a total of 5,718 PUTs represented with finished FLcDNA sequences. The high rate
(88.5%) of unique transcript discovery resulted from a
successful strategy for selection of a low-redundancy
FLcDNA clone set prior to sequence finishing (Figure 1).
All 6,464 sequence-verified FLcDNAs achieved a minimum of Phred30 sequence quality at every base (i.e., no
more than one error in 103 bases). The majority were of
even higher quality with the minimum and average quality values exceeding Phred45 (less than one error in

Table 2: Spruce EST summary

To further assess the quality of the FLcDNAs, we performed reciprocal BLAST analysis using 872 known FL
sequences from other conifer and gymnosperm species
identified in previous entries in the NR database of GenBank. Using a stringent similarity threshold [identity ≥
50%; BLASTX score value ≥ 95, where alignment scores are
calculated based on match, mismatch and gaps in alignments using the default BLAST scoring matrices and
parameters] we identified 297 pairs of Sitka spruce and
other gymnosperm FLcDNAs. Of these pairs, 244 (82.1%)
agreed well with regard to their ORF lengths (Figure 4)
and positions of their starting methionine and stop
codons (± ten amino acids). For the remaining pairs, the
predicted 5' and/or 3' ORF ends did not match, suggesting
alternative start or stop codons, splice variants, or the possibility that one of the pair members was truncated or had
an incorrectly predicted ORF. Despite the relatively small
number of other gymnosperm FL sequences available for
pairwise comparison, the high sequence similarity within
this dataset indicates that most of the 6,464 FLcDNAs represent true FL transcripts with complete ORFs and correctly annotated start and stop codons.

error in 108 bases), respectively (Figure 2). We predicted
the complete protein-coding ORFs for all 6,464 FLcDNAs
(Additional File 2). The average sequenced FLcDNA
length (from beginning of the 5' UTR to the end of the
polyA tail) was 1,088 ± 404 bp (mean ± SD), and ranged
from 401 to 3,003 bp, whereas the average predicted ORF
was 616 ± 374 bp and ranged from 30 to 2,583 bp (Figure
3). ORFs could not be detected (i.e., less than 30 bp) for
11 FLcDNAs. The 5' and 3' UTRs averaged 154 ± 164 bp
and 301 ± 174 bp, respectively (Figure 3).

Most spruce ESTs have low similarity with angiosperm
sequences
Since conifers and other gymnosperms are difficult experimental systems with few functionally characterized proteins, in silico annotation of spruce ESTs was performed
against predicted peptides from sequenced genomes of
four angiosperms (Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, and grapevine) and the moss Physcomitrella patens, together with all
protein sequences in the NR database of GenBank.

3). Using a more stringent threshold of score > 200,
between 16.1% and 21.4% of spruce 3'-end ESTs match
peptides from each of the five plant genomes of this comparison. BLASTX matches with hq 3'-end ESTs were

Clone selection and complete insert sequencing of 6,464 Sitka spruce FLcDNAs
Clone selection and complete insert sequencing of 6,464 Sitka spruce FLcDNAs. A total of 20,469 candidate FL
transcripts were identified in two consecutive rounds of clone selection involving initially 32,980 and then 46,745 putative
unique transcripts (PUTs) derived from a total of 147,146 high-quality 3'-end ESTs. See Methods for complete details of candidate clone selection criteria. Among the 8,127 candidates selected for complete insert sequencing, 5,298 were finished by end
reads only, and another 1,166 were finished by end reads plus gap closing using primer walking, yielding a total of 6,464
sequence-verified finished FLcDNAs. An additional 1,396 clones (17.1%) from the starting set of 8,127 will be finished in future
work. Only 267 clones (3.2%) were aborted, which supports the success of our strategy for FLcDNA clone selection.

slightly higher (72.8% and 24.5% at score > 50 and > 200,
respectively) when compared to the more comprehensive
collection of proteins in the NR database (Figure 5A and
Additional File 3). Similar results were obtained using the
assembled contig set of 46,745 spruce PUTs derived from
3'-end ESTs (Figure 5C and Additional File 5). Among hq
5'-end ESTs > 400 bases in length (N = 36,505), sequence
similarity with proteins predicted from the five plant
genome sequences was higher compared to 3' ESTs and
PUTs, with between 74.3% and 82.6% (low stringency)
and 30.7% and 40.2% (high stringency) of 5'-end ESTs
matching each of the plant genomes (Figure 5B and Additional File 4). As observed with 3'-end ESTs and PUTs, an

even higher proportion of 5'-end ESTs had BLASTX
matches against the NR database (85.9% and 43.8% at
score > 50 and > 200, respectively). These results illustrate
the challenge of in silico annotation of conifer ESTs, even
with hq sequences averaging > 650 bases in length.
We also compared the spruce ESTs and PUTs against ESTs
from all gymnosperm species combined (dbEST database
of GenBank, excluding ESTs reported in this study) using
BLASTN. As expected, sequence similarity between the
spruce ESTs and published gymnosperm ESTs was high
(Figure 5 and Additional Files 3, 4, 5). Among PUTs

Validation of sequence quality of FLcDNAs
Validation of sequence quality of FLcDNAs. Sequence accuracy was measured as the percentage of the 6,464 FLcDNAs
which, with 100%, 95.0–99.9%, 90.0–94.9% or <90.0% of their sequence length, exceeded Phred30, Phred40, Phred50 or
Phred60 sequence quality thresholds. All 6,464 FLcDNAs exceeded the Phred30 quality thresholds (less than 1 error in 103
sequenced nucleotides) over 100% of their sequence length. Even at the threshold level of Phred60 (less than 1 error in 106
sequenced nucleotides) the majority (74.1%) of the FLcDNA sequences met this very high sequence quality score over > 95.0%
of their length.

400 bases in length, 88.6%, 95.4% and 96.9%, respectively, have matches with scores > 50. At higher BLASTN
stringency levels (i.e., scores > 200 and > 1,000), sequence
matches for PUTs, 3'-end and 5'-end ESTs remain consistently high. Among those PUTs, 3'-end and 5'-end ESTs >
400 bases in length and with no obvious similarity to proteins from the five sequenced plant genomes (at score ≤
50), 60.0%, 79.1%, and 82.0%, respectively, have
BLASTN scores > 200 versus published gymnosperm ESTs
(Additional Files 3, 4, 5). When the spruce ESTs are compared against published ESTs from white spruce and
loblolly pine, the two gymnosperm species with the most
substantial EST collections, a higher proportion of PUTs,
and 3'-end and 5'-end ESTs show sequence similarity to
white spruce compared to loblolly pine, especially at the
highest BLASTN threshold (Figure 5 and Additional Files
3, 4, 5).
Utility of spruce FLcDNAs for comparative sequence
annotation
As might be expected, sequence similarity between the
6,464 Sitka spruce FLcDNAs and other gymnosperm ESTs
is very high, with 96.5%, 94.6% and 78.7% of FLcDNAs
matching published gymnosperm ESTs at low, medium,

and high sequence similarity thresholds, respectively (Figure 6A and Additional File 2). As observed with spruce
ESTs, sequence similarity was highest between spruce
FLcDNAs and white spruce ESTs, with lower similarity
observed with loblolly pine ESTs (Figure 6A). Next, the
spruce FLcDNAs were compared against predicted proteins from five plant genome sequences and protein
sequences in the complete NR database of GenBank. At a
low sequence similarity threshold of score > 50, between
76.5% and 84.2% of FLcDNAs matched proteins from
each of the plant genomes of this comparison, whereas at
a higher threshold of score > 200 the percentages of FLcDNAs with matches in the plant genome sequences ranged
from 38.1% to 44.9% (Figure 6A and Additional File 2).
Overall, the Sitka spruce FLcDNAs show greater similarity
to predicted proteins from sequenced plant genomes
compared to the spruce ESTs. The proportion of spruce
FLcDNAs with similarity to proteins in the NR database
was also higher than spruce ESTs at 87.7% and 47.9% at
score > 50 and score > 200, respectively (Figure 6A and
Additional File 2).
These results show that FLcDNAs provide a clear advantage over ESTs for large scale in silico annotation of spruce

Distribution of open reading frame (ORF) and 5' and 3' untranslated region (UTR) sizes among the finished
6,464 FLcDNAs (A), and the mean ORF and UTR length (± standard deviation) (B). Each finished FLcDNA
sequence was examined for the presence of ORFs using the EMBOSS getorf program (version 2.5.0; [69,70]). In each case, the
longest stretch of uninterrupted sequence between a start (ATG) and stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the 5' to 3' direction
was taken as the predicted ORF. The presence and coordinates of the 5' second strand primer adaptor sequence (SSPA) and
polyA tail were also noted. The regions between the 5'SSPA and the predicted ORF start and between the predicted ORF stop
and the polyA tail were taken to be the 5' and 3' UTRs, respectively. The 5' SSPA and 3' polyA tail lengths were not included

sequences. Nevertheless, when using high stringency criteria relevant for in silico functional annotation (score values > 200), the comparison of spruce FLcDNAs against the
five plant genomes, as well as all plant species in the NR
database, still identifies a substantial number of
sequences that only show significant matches with other
gymnosperms, as opposed to angiosperms. Among the
6,464 spruce FLcDNAs, we found 927 (14.3%) without a
reliable match to angiosperm sequences at a low stringency (i.e., BLASTX score ≤ 50), of which 743 (80.1%)
match with high sequence similarity (i.e., BLASTN score >
200) to a published gymnosperm EST sequence (Additional File 2). A very small number of spruce FLcDNAs
lack sequence similarity to angiosperm or gymnosperm
sequences (at score ≤ 50) and display a best match with
non-plant species in the NR database of GenBank; 1.0% at
score > 50 and 0.3% at score > 200 (Additional File 2). In
these cases, the best match is often an insect sequence suggesting small amounts of contaminants in the cDNA
libraries.
Comparing the entire spruce FLcDNA dataset against
sequences from all species identified that 71.9% (at score
> 50) or 34.2% (at score > 200) have matches in all seven
datasets (i.e., five plant genomes, the NR database of Gen-

Bank, and gymnosperm ESTs) (Figure 6B and 6C). It is
notable that at the higher threshold of score > 200, 47.2%
of spruce FLcDNAs match only to a single database, and
in the vast majority of cases this is a gymnosperm
sequence (Figure 6E). Another 1.0% (at score ≤ 50) or
3.8% (at score ≤ 200) of spruce FLcDNA sequences do not
align to any sequences in available databases. These
sequences could represent genes from spruce (or genes
from other contaminant organisms) that have not been
sequenced before in any source.

Discussion
Spruce ESTs and FLcDNAs enhance conifer genomics
resources
Genomics research on conifers has been limited by the
lack of a relevant gymnosperm reference genome
sequence. The very large size of conifer genomes (10 to 40
Gb; [1]), dominated by repetitive DNA, has been a roadblock to a conifer genome sequence project. Furthermore,
the phylogenetic distance between conifers and the wellstudied angiosperms is more than 300 million years [2],
limiting the utility of angiosperm genome information for
research in conifers. To overcome these obstacles to conifer genome research, we have developed two new valuable
components for the "conifer genomics toolbox".

The 6,464 FLcDNAs were compared to a collection of 872 gymnosperm sequences from SwissProt using BLASTX ([71]; release 50.1 of June 13th, 2006) annotated as fulllength (excluding predicted proteins derived from genomic DNA). This comparison identified 297 homologous pairs. A sprucegymnosperm FLcDNA pair was considered homologous if (1) the best gymnosperm protein BLASTX match exceeded a stringent threshold (% identity ≥ 50%; score value > 95) and (2) the reciprocal TBLASTN analysis identified the same spruce
FLcDNA with a score value equal to or within 10% of the best match. ORF and cDNA lengths for gymnosperm sequences
were extracted from the SwissProt records, and spruce ORF lengths were predicted using the EMBOSS getorf program.
Strong correlations were observed for both ORF and cDNA lengths between spruce and gymnosperm sequences for the available test set of 297 homologous pairs.

First, we have assembled a large collection of high-quality,
sequence-verified FLcDNA clones from Sitka spruce, along
with a corresponding database of in silico annotations
(Additional File 2). These FLcDNAs are of very low redundancy. They represent the third largest sequence-verified
FLcDNA resource for any plant species, behind only rice
[7] and Arabidopsis [4], and are the only substantial
FLcDNA resource for a conifer or any other gymnosperm.
Second, we have added a large number of new EST
sequences to the public spruce EST collection in GenBank,
along with corresponding databases of in silico annotations (Additional Files 3, 4, 5). This resource, which was
developed from Sitka, white and interior spruce (interior
spruce has varying degrees of admixture between white
and Engelmann spruce), substantially improves the size
and quality of the previously described spruce EST collections [20-23]. The spruce EST collection, along with the
ESTs from loblolly pine [15-18], is now one of the two
largest EST resources for any conifer species. To enhance
gene discovery, we strategically employed library normal-

ization, which had previously not been applied to a conifer EST program. Also, we have added sequences from an
until now poorly represented class of tissues representing
a biologically important component of conifer defense:
insect-, wound- or elicitor-induced tissues.
We identified 46,745 PUTs (19,941 contigs, 26,804 singletons; derived from 3'-end ESTs) in the three species
groups surveyed here; Sitka spruce, white spruce, and interior spruce. The rates of PUT discovery for all species combined (31.8%), white spruce only (33.0%) and Sitka
spruce only (36.6%) are comparable, as are the ratios of
singletons to contigs in each collection. Among contigs
from the combined analysis of white and Sitka spruce
ESTs, 26.7% contained ESTs from both species, suggesting
that ESTs derived from different spruce species representing the same spruce gene often cluster together. The PUTs
identified here may represent a substantial portion of the
expressed gene catalogue for species of spruce, but a complete genome sequence is needed for assessment of true
gene numbers in conifers.

> 200, respectively. Panels D and E show the database source in cases where spruce FLcDNAs matched only a single database
in panels C and D at BLAST score thresholds of > 50 and > 200, respectively.
The spruce ESTs described here have already provided the
foundation for functional and comparative genomics
research on conifer defense against insects, adaptation to
the environment, somatic embryogenesis and wood formation, via both transcriptome and proteome analyses
[21,34,35,42,46]. They have also allowed development of
three types of genetic markers: microsatellites [47,48], single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and conserved
orthologous sequences (COS) [41]. The FLcDNA
sequences enable rigorous large-scale comparisons of evolutionary patterns at large evolutionary scales (K. Ritland
et al., manuscript in preparation).
Utility of spruce FLcDNAs for functional characterization
of gene families including nearly identical paralogous
genes
Prior to this work, only a few dozen complete spruce protein sequences were available in the SwissProt database,
and no substantial FLcDNA resource was available for any
gymnosperm. Using FLcDNAs, detailed pathway annotation, gene expression analysis, and biochemical functional characterization of individual genes and gene
families are now possible (S.G. Ralph and J. Bohlmann,
manuscript in preparation). The Sitka spruce FLcDNAs
have already advanced the discovery and the characterization of conifer defense genes [49-53]. Importantly, Sitka
spruce FLcDNAs allow for accurate analysis of closely
related members of gene families such as cytochrome
P450-dependent monooxygenases or terpenoid synthases
(TPS) involved in defense against insects or pathogens
[40,54]. For example, TPSs represent a gene family containing many pairs or groups of nearly identical paralogous genes each with a potentially different biochemical
function [32]. Our recent mutational analysis of two
closely related paralogous Norway spruce di-TPS illustrated that a single amino acid mutation in a background
of more than 800 amino acids completely alters biochemical product profiles [55]. Similarly, in rice, the functional
divergence of two distinct TPS of primary and secondary
metabolism was due to a single amino acid substitution
[56]. These examples illustrate the utility of true FLcDNAs
for discovery of nearly identical paralogous genes and for

functional assessment of gene evolution that is now possible in Sitka spruce.
Utility of FLcDNAs for conifer proteome and genome
characterization
Beyond their importance for functional characterization
of individual genes and the analysis of gene families, on
an even larger scale, FLcDNAs are also superior to ESTs for
overall proteome and genome characterization in a conifer. Because the Sitka spruce FLcDNAs allow for a much
more reliable prediction of the complete protein-coding
ORF than ESTs, they have been invaluable for proteome
predictions and practical proteome analyses [35]. In
expectation of future efforts to sequence a conifer
genome, FLcDNAs and their ORFs will be essential for the
development and training of gene prediction software, as
has recently been demonstrated for poplar [8,9].
Spruce FLcDNAs from insect-induced libraries reveal genes
not detected in angiosperms
Comparison of Sitka spruce sequences against
angiosperm plants suggests that there are likely a substantial number of genes in the collection of 6,464 FLcDNAs
that are either absent in other species, or lack significant
sequence similarity for unambiguous identification. In
earlier work, Kirst et al. [16] suggested that less than 10%
of loblolly pine transcripts lack a related gene in Arabidopsis (defined at a BLASTX E value cutoff of 1e-10 or ca.
score 60). When we analyzed the spruce FLcDNAs, we
found that approximately 14% had no similarity to any
angiosperm at a BLASTX stringency of score 50 (slightly
lower than that applied by Kirst et al. [16]), based on comparisons to four sequenced angiosperm genomes and all
angiosperm sequences in the NR database. This slightly
higher rate may be the result of sequencing libraries made
from tissues induced by insect attack, which may disproportionally represent genes with specialized functions in
conifer defense that are subject to high levels of natural
selection due to biotic interaction. By contrast, genes
involved in xylem development and wood formation
appear to be well conserved in angiosperms and conifers
[16,46].

Conclusion
The 206,875 ESTs and 6,464 FLcDNAs and the corresponding in silico annotated sequence databases provide a
new and valuable genomics resource for species of spruce,
as well as for gymnosperms in general. Our emphasis on
FLcDNAs and ESTs from cDNA libraries constructed from
herbivore-, wound- or elicitor-treated induced spruce tissues, along with incorporating normalization to capture
rare transcripts, gives a rich conifer EST resource which
also apparently contains a substantial number of transcripts with no obvious sequence similarity to known
angiosperm sequences. Recent research has begun to fully
realize the application of these EST and FLcDNA
sequences, and FLcDNA clones.

Methods
cDNA library construction
Details of the isolation of total and poly(A)+ RNA are
described in Additional File 6. Standard cDNA libraries
were directionally constructed (5' EcoRI and 3' XhoI) using
5 μg poly(A)+ RNA and the pBluescript II XR cDNA Library
Kit, following manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La
Jolla, USA) with modifications. First-strand synthesis was
performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and an anchored oligo d(T) primer
[5'-(GA)10ACTAGTCTCGAG(T)18VN-3']. Size fractionation was performed on XhoI-digested cDNA prior to ligation into vector using a 1% NuSieve GTG low melting
point agarose gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications,
Walkersville, USA) and β-agarase (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, USA) to isolate cDNAs from 300 bp to 5 kb.
Select cDNA libraries were normalized to Cot = 5 using
established protocols [13,14]. Library plasmids were
propagated in ElectroMAX DH10B T1 Phage Resistant
Cells (Invitrogen). FLcDNA libraries were directionally
constructed (5' XhoI and 3' BamHI) according to methods
of Carninci and Hayashizaki [57] and Carninci et al. [58],
with modifications described in Additional File 6.
DNA sequencing and sequence filtering
Details of bacterial transformation with plasmids, clone
handling, DNA purification and evaluation, and DNA
sequencing are provided in Additional File 6. Sequences
from each cDNA library were closely monitored to assess
library complexity and sequence quality. DNA sequence
chromatograms were processed using the PHRED software (versions 0.000925.c and 0.020425.c) [59,60].
Sequences were quality-trimmed according to the highquality (hq) contiguous region determined by PHRED
and vector-trimmed using CROSS_MATCH software [61].
Sequences with less than 100 high quality bases (Phred20
or better) after trimming and sequences with polyA tails of
≥ 100 bases were removed from the analysis. Also
removed were sequences representing bacterial, yeast or
fungal contaminations identified by sequence alignments

Selection of candidate FLcDNA clones and sequencing
strategy
All 3'-end ESTs remaining after filtering were clustered
and assembled using CAP3 ([44]; assembly criteria: 95%
identity, 40 bp window). The resulting contigs and singletons were defined as the putative unique transcript (PUT)
set. PUTs with a cDNA clone from a FLcDNA library were
selected as candidates for complete insert sequencing.
Candidate clones from FLcDNA libraries were single-pass
sequenced from both 3'- and 5'-ends, and both sequences
were used for subsequent clone selection. Clones were
screened for the presence of a polyA tail (3'-end EST) and
the second-strand primer adaptor (SSPA; 5'-ACTAGTTTAATTAAATTAATCCCCCCCCCCC-3';
5'-end
EST).
Clones lacking either of these features were eliminated. A
polyA tail was defined as at least 12 consecutive, or 14 of
15 "A" residues within the first 30 bases of the 3'-end EST
(5' to 3'). The presence of the SSPA was detected using the
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm limiting the search to the
first 30 bases of the 5'end EST (5' to 3'). The SSPA was
defined as eight consecutive "C" residues and a ≥ 80%
match to the remaining sequence (5'-ACTAGTTTAATTAAATTAAT-3'). In each case, the algorithms used to
detect the 5' and 3' clone features were set to produce maximal sensitivity while maintaining a 0% false positive rate,
as determined using test data sets. Candidate clones for
which either of the initial 5'-end or 3'-end EST sequences
had a Phred20 quality length of < 400 bases were also
excluded. Finally, any clone with a 5'-end EST which had
a BLASTN match (score value > 300) to a gymnosperm
EST in the public domain (excluding ESTs from this collection) and was > 100 bases shorter at the 5' end than the
matching EST was flagged as truncated at the 5' end and
was excluded. For each PUT represented by multiple candidate clones after filtering, the clone with the longest 5'
sequence was selected for complete insert sequencing.
Insert sizing using colony PCR and vector primers was performed on 1,634 cDNA clones with an average insert size
of ca. 1,250 bp. Based on this information, a sequencing

strategy emphasizing the use of end reads was chosen.
Using end reads only, 5,298 clones were complete insert
sequenced to a high quality. Among this set, the average
sequenced insert size was 1,005 ± 282 bp (average ± SD)
with an average of 5.93 ± 0.51 end reads required to finish. Using a combination of end sequencing and primer
walking, an additional 1,166 clones were complete insert
sequenced, with an average insert size of 1,653 ± 447 bp,
and requiring six end reads and 2.62 ± 1.51 internal
primer reads per clone.
Sequence finishing of FLcDNA clones
FLcDNA clones selected for complete sequence finishing
were rearrayed into 384-well plates, followed by two additional rounds of 5'-end and 3'-end sequencing using vector primers. All sequences from an individual clone were
then assembled using PHRAP (version 0990329) [59,60].
To meet our hq criteria, the resulting clone consensus
sequence was required to achieve a minimum average
score of Phred35, with each base position having a minimum score of Phred30. Each base position also required
at least two sequences, each with a minimum quality of
Phred20, that were in agreement with the consensus
sequence (i.e., no high-quality discrepancies). Clones that
did not meet these finishing criteria or that had gaps after
three rounds of end sequencing were then subjected to
successive rounds of sequencing using custom primers
designed using the Consed graphical tool version 14 [64]
until the required quality levels were achieved. Regardless
of the finishing strategy, all clones that did not meet the
minimum finishing criteria according to an automated
pipeline were manually examined. Clones were aborted if
they were manually verified to lack the minimum finishing criteria, did not possess the cloning structures, were
identified as chimeric, were refractory to sequence finishing due to the presence of a "hard-stop", or if errors were
identified in the re-array of glycerol stocks. FLcDNA
sequences have been deposited in GenBank [EF081469 to
EF087932].
