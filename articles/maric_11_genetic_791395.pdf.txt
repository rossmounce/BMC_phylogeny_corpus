Genetic differentiation of European grayling
(Thymallus thymallus) populations in Serbia, based
on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses
Saša Marić1*, Andrej Razpet2, Vera Nikolić1, Predrag Simonović1

Abstract
Background: The structure and diversity of grayling (Thymallus thymallus) populations have been well studied in
most of its native habitat; however the southernmost populations of the Balkan Peninsula remain largely
unexplored. The purpose of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of Serbian grayling populations, detect
the impact of stocking and provide guidelines for conservation and management.
Methods: Eighty grayling individuals were collected from four rivers (Ibar, Lim, Drina and Rzav). The mitochondrial
DNA control region (CR; 595 bp of the 3’end and 74 bp of flanking tRNA) and the ATP6 gene (630 bp fragment)
were sequenced for 20 individuals (five from each locality). In addition, all individuals were genotyped with 12
microsatellite loci. The diversity and structure of the populations as well as the recent and ancient population
declines were studied using specialized software.
Results: We detected three new haplotypes in the mtDNA CR and four haplotypes in the ATP6 gene of which
three had not been described before. Previously, one CR haplotype and two ATP6 gene haplotypes had been
identified as allochthonous, originating from Slovenia. Reconstruction of phylogenetic relations placed the
remaining two CR haplotypes from the River Danube drainage of Serbia into a new clade, which is related to the
previously described sister Slovenian clade. These two clades form a new Balkan clade. Microsatellite marker
analysis showed that all four populations are genetically distinct from each other without any sign of intrapopulation structure, although stocking of the most diverse population (Drina River) was confirmed by mtDNA
analysis. Recent and historical population declines of Serbian grayling do not differ from those of other European
populations.
Conclusions: Our study shows that (1) the Ibar, Lim and Drina Rivers grayling populations are genetically distinct
from populations outside of Serbia and thus should be managed as native populations in spite of some
introgression in the Drina River population and (2) the Rzav River population is not appropriate for further stocking
activities since it originates from stocked Slovenian grayling. However, the Rzav River population does not
represent an immediate danger to other populations because it is physically isolated from these.

Background
The recent natural dispersal area of the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) extends westward to France
and Great Britain, northward across Fenoscandinavia
and northern Russia, eastward to the Ural Mountains
near the Kara River [1] and southward to the headwaters in the drainage areas of Ibar (Serbia) and Lim

Fossil evidence suggests that European grayling inhabited Europe long before the Pleistocene cold periods [2],
corroborating the pre-glacial introgression of grayling
and its expansion across Europe, as also suggested by
Weiss et al. [3]. Numerous DNA marker-based studies
on population genetic structure, phylogeography and
phylogeny of European grayling are now available for
various geographic regions (e.g. [3-8]), as well as on
local scales (e.g. [9-18]). Studies on the matrilineal

phylogeography and post-glacial dispersal routes of
European grayling have revealed 27 haplotypes in the
ND-5/6 and cyt-b/D-loop (CR) regions of mitochondrial
DNA [5], 58 haplotypes in the D-loop (CR) region [3]
and 30 ND-1 haplotypes in the ND-5/6 gene region [7].
All the results suggest the existence of distinct Danubian
clades, as well as Central-Eastern, Central-Western,
Northern/Northeastern and mixed clades [19]. Rather
distinct grayling clades were detected in the Adriatic
region and in the Loire basin with a single haplotype
(At1) that is highly divergent compared to those of the
remaining clades [3]. The assumed refugial region for (i)
the Northern/Northeastern-European clade was the area
north of the Caspian and Black Seas, (ii) the CentralEastern European clade, the ice-free tributaries of Vistula and Elbe Rivers, (iii) the Central-Western Europe,
the ice-free tributaries of Rhine, Main and upper
Danube, and (iv) the Danubian clades, the lower Danube
drainage area, i.e., in the Balkan Peninsula [19]. Based
on CR mtDNA sequence analyses and calibration of
molecular clock applied to the nucleotide divergence of
these sequences between the major grayling clades with
a CR mutation rate of 1% per million years (MY), Froufe
et al. [4] have dated the colonization of Europe to the
Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary around 4.6 to 1.6 million
years ago (MYA), far before the onset of Pleistocene ice
age. However, during the late Pleistocene and Holocene
glaciations, it is assumed that secondary contacts
occurred in all drainages, e.g. in the upper reaches of
the rivers Main, Danube, Elbe and Rhine (Lake Constance) [19]. Koskinen et al. [6] have revealed that a
substantial proportion of molecular variation (44%) in
European grayling exits between populations, whereas
Gum et al. [7,16] have revealed that about 25% of the
total genetic variation is explained by differences
between major drainage systems, about 11 to 20% by
differences between populations within drainages and
about 57 to 64% by differences within populations.
The Balkan Peninsula along with the Apennine and
Iberian Peninsulas, were a refuge area during the Pleistocene glaciations and therefore might represent crossroads of different evolutionary patterns and processes
[20,21]. The Balkan Peninsula, in contrast to the
Apennine and Iberian Peninsulas, is poorly explored
(except Slovenia). This part of Europe, very important
for post-glacial faunal evolution and colonization, is
noted as a biodiversity hotspot [22,23]. The last
(Würm) glaciation in Europe ended ~10 000 years ago
coinciding with both colonization of the present grayling habitat and decline of grayling populations. Based
on the 34 European populations (none from the
Balkans), between 1000 to 10000 years ago, population
sizes were reduced to 0.03-1.2% of their historical
sizes [24].

An even more recent decline of European grayling
populations throughout central Europe, due to pollution,
habitat destruction, river engineering, predation from
piscivorous birds and overfishing [1,13,15,25-27], is also
characteristic to Serbian grayling populations. Janković
[28] has reported results for six Serbian rivers with grayling populations (Drina, Lim, Uvac, Jadar, Studenica and
Ibar). The populations from Uvac, Jadar and Studenica
Rivers went extinct, while one new population was
established in the Rzav River through stocking with fish
originating from an unknown source population from
Slovenia. Population decline leads to an increase in
management activities that involve rearing and stocking
grayling, which may cause a change in genetic architecture and extinction of natural populations [29].
The main goal of the present study was to investigate
the genetic diversity of grayling populations in Serbia,
using two mtDNA loci (CR and ATP6), in order to clarify the phylogeography of grayling populations in this
previously unstudied part of its native range. Additionally, 12 microsatellite loci were analyzed, in order to (i)
characterize the genetic variability and differentiation,
(ii) compare recent and historical declines in previously
studied European populations [24] with that of Serbian
populations and (iii) examine whether it is possible to
identify non-introgressed indigenous populations of
grayling for future management and supportive
breeding.

Methods
Sampling and DNA isolation

Eighty grayling individuals from four Serbian locations
across the Danubian drainage were collected by electrofishing and angling between 2007 and 2008 (Table 1
and Figure 1). Fin clips were sampled and stored in 96%
ethanol. Total DNA was isolated from this tissue using
the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega),
following the supplier’s instructions.
Fifty-seven haplotypes from GenBank (accession numbers AF522395-AF522452) were used for the phylogenetic analysis and outgroup taxa included three
individuals of Thymallus arcticus (AF522453), Thymallus grubei (AF522454) and Thymallus brevirostris
(AF522455).
The number of geographical rivers sampled for
Serbian grayling in this study was limited and could not
be increased because the four rivers included are the
only ones remaining in Serbia today, with native grayling occurring only in three of these (see Introduction,
Janković [28]).
Mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis

Two mtDNA loci, control region (CR) and ATP6
were amplified in 20 individuals by polymerase chain

Sequences of the newly described haplotypes are available in GenBank under Accession numbers: Bal: HM641130, BoDr: HM636920, Slo: HM636921, Da25:

reaction (PCR). The complete CR [1043 base pairs (bp)]
and 162 bp of the flanking tRNA were amplified using
the LRBT-25 and LRBT-1195 primers [15]. The complete ATP6 gene (648 bp) was amplified using the
L8558 and H9208 primers [30].
The following PCR conditions were used: each reaction mixture (30 μL) contained 21.6 μL H 2 O (21 μL
H2O for ATP6), 3 μL 10 × PCR buffer, 0.75 μL 10 mM
of each primer, 1.2 μL 25 mM MgCl 2 (1.8 μL 25 mM
MgCl 2 for ATP6), 1.5 μL 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 μL Fermentas Taq polymerase and 1 μL of template DNA
(~100 ng of genomic DNA); the cycle parameters were
as follows: initial denaturation (95°C, 3 min) followed by
32 cycles of strand denaturation (95°C, 45 s), primer
annealing (55°C, 45 s) and DNA extension (72°C, 60 s).
All PCR amplifications were performed in a programmable thermocycler GeneAmp ® PCR System 9700
(Applied Biosystems). Amplified DNA fragments were
run on a 1.5% agarose gel and subsequently isolated
from the gel using the QIAEX II gel Extraction Kit
(QIAGEN).
All sequencing reactions were prepared using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The 3’end of the 595 bp fragment of the
mtDNA CR with the 74 bp of flanking tRNA were
sequenced using primer LRBT-1195 [15]. The 5’end of
the 630 bp ATP6 fragment was sequenced using primer
L8558 [30]. The amplified, fluorescently labeled and terminated DNA was salt-precipitated and analyzed on an
ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.
Microsatellite marker analysis

Twelve microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized as previously described i.e. BFRO004 [31],
BFRO005 to BFRO008 [9], BFRO010 and BFRO011
[32], BFRO013 [11], BFRO015 to BFRO018 [33]. They
were amplified in 80 individuals using fluorescently
labeled forward primers. The following PCR conditions
(10 μL reactions) were used: 6.325 μL H2O, 1 μL 10 ×

PCR buffer, 0.25 μL 10 mM of each primer, 0.6 μL
25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μL 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.075 μL Fermentas Taq polymerase and 1 μL of template DNA (~100 ng
of genomic DNA); the cycle parameters were as
follows: initial denaturation (94°C, 3 min) followed by
30 cycles of strand denaturation (94°C, 45 s), primer
annealing (55°C, 30 s for BFRO004 to BFRO010, and
60°C, 30 s for BFRO011 to BFRO018) and DNA extension (72°C, 5 s). Fragment analysis was performed on a
3130xl Genetic Analyzer and genotyped using GeneMapper v4.0.
Mitochondrial DNA data analysis

DNA sequences were aligned using the computer program ClustalW [34]. Sequence polymorphism was
assessed using DNAsp ver. 4.10 [35] and sequence
divergence was estimated by the net nucleotide divergence (Da) using MEGA version 2.1 [36].
Aligned haplotypes were imported into the program
PAUP Version 4.0b10 [37] for phylogenetic analysis.
Neighbour-Joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP)
analyses were carried out for phylogenetic reconstruction. For the NJ analysis, a HKY85 model of substitution
was chosen. Support for the nodes was obtained with
1000 bootstrap replicates. For the MP analysis, insertions or deletions (indels) were included as a fifth character, and the inferred phylogeny was estimated with
50% majority rule consensus tree. A heuristic search
(1000 replicates) with Tree Bisection Reconnection
(TBR) branch-swapping was employed to find the most
parsimonious trees.
Relations among haplotypes were also determined
using the TCS 1.2 program [38] with a connection limit
fixed at 24 steps to include all the different haplotypes.
Gaps were analyzed as a fifth character.
Microsatellite marker data analysis

Microsatellite allele frequencies, expected (HE ), nonbiased (Hn.b) and observed (HO) heterozygosities were
calculated with GENETIX 4.04 [39]. FSTAT 2.9.3.2 [40]

was used to calculate deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
expectations (HWE), allelic richness and pair-wise FST
values, all based on 1000 permutations. Genetic relationships between individuals were estimated as the proportion of shared alleles at each locus, i.e. allele sharing
distances (D AS ) [41]. A matrix of D AS was used to

construct Neighbour-Joining trees of individuals and
populations with POPULATIONS software [42].
Recent population declines (2Ne-4Ne generations ago)
can be detected with BOTTLENECK 1.2.02 [43] using
the recommended stepwise mutation model (SMM) and
the two-phase model (TPM) with 95% of single-step

Marić et al. Genetics Selection Evolution 2011, 43:2

mutations and variance mutation size set to 12. To
detect historical population declines, the coalescent analysis approach implemented in MSVAR 1.3 assuming
strict SMM was used [44]. For the exponential model,
we followed the settings used by Swatdipong et al. [24]
with a five-year generation time discarding the first 10%
of 2 × 108 iterations.
Population structure was inferred using the STRUCTURE program [45], which seeks solutions for a given
number of clusters K applied to genotypic data in such
a way that each cluster is in or close to Hardy-Weinberg
and linkage equilibrium [46]. For runs estimating ln Pr
(X|K) under a certain K, different run lengths were used
(from 20000 to 100000 burn-in and 100000-2000000
total length, repeated 7 times for each K) depending on
convergence. We applied the ΔK method [47] to estimate the most probable K.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis

Three new haplotypes were detected by sequencing the
mtDNA CR: Da25, Da27 and Da29. Haplotype Da25
was present in the Rzav River population with a 100%
frequency and in the Drina River population with a 40%
frequency. Haplotypes Da25 and Da24 share synapomorphies at positions 622, 625, 626 and 635, and at
position 708 with haplotypes Da22 and Da23 (See additional file 1: Variable nucleotide positions for CR haplotypes). Haplotypes Da22, Da23 and Da24 were observed
in the population of the Sava River drainage area in
Slovenia [3]. Haplotype Da27 was dominant in the samples from all localities in Serbia, with a 100% frequency
for the Ibar and Lim Rivers and a 40% frequency for the
Drina River. Haplotype Da29 was present exclusively in
the Drina River population with a 20% frequency. Haplotypes Da27 and Da29 differed at five polymorphic
positions and their genetic distance is about 0.75%. Haplotype Da27 and Da29 and haplotype Da25 differed at
nine and ten polymorphic positions, respectively, and
the genetic distance between these is about 1.5%.
Sequencing of the ATP6 gene revealed four haplotypes
(Soc18, Slo, BoDr and Bal). Haplotype Soc18 had already
been described in the population of Soča River in Slovenia [4] while in Serbia it was found only in samples
from the Rzav River with an 80% frequency. The other
three haplotypes had never been described before. Haplotype Slo was present in the populations of the Rzav
River with a 20% frequency and the Drina River with a
40% frequency. Haplotype Bal was dominant in the sample analyzed here and was present in the populations of
the Ibar and Lim Rivers with a 100% frequency and in
the Drina River with a 40% frequency. Haplotype BoDr
was found only in the Drina River samples with a 20%

frequency. Unlike the mtDNA CR for which up to 10
polymorphic positions were identified among the three
haplotypes, only three polymorphic positions were
detected in the four ATP6 haplotypes and all were silent
mutations. The synapomorphic position 34 discriminated between haplotypes Soc18 and Slo and haplotypes
Bal and BoDr, which differed by two polymorphic positions at most, i.e. by a genetic distance of up to 0.32%
(See additional file 2: Variable nucleotide positions for
ATP6 gene haplotypes). Combining three CR and four
ATP6 haplotypes produced four combined haplotypes
(Table 1), since the samples that possessed different
ATP6 haplotypes (Soc18 and Slo) shared the same CR
haplotype Da25.
Reconstructing phylogenies by both Neighbour-Joining
and parsimony methods revealed that haplotype Da25
and the Slovenian haplotypes from the Sava River drainage area form a sister clade of the new clade containing haplotypes Da27 and Da29 from the Danube River
drainage area of Serbia (Figure 2). Both sister clades
form the new Balkan clade.
The minimum spanning haplotype network of genealogical relationships among the haplotypes revealed that
haplotype Da25 is closest to haplotype Da24 in the
Slovenian group of haplotypes in the Sava River drainage
area (Figure 3) from which it differed by a single mutation, while it differed by nine or more mutations from
other Slovenian haplotypes from the same drainage area
(Da22 and Da23). Haplotypes Da27 and Da29 constitute
a special group in the network and occupy a position
which is most closely related to the Slovenian group of
haplotypes from which they differ by six or more
mutations.
Microsatellite marker analysis

Allelic richness ranged from 1.58 to 4.08 and observed
heterozygosity ranged from 0.16 to 0.47. The highest
levels of allelic richness (4.08), observed (0.47) and
expected (0.49) heterozygosities were detected in the
Drina River samples, while those of the Rzav and Ibar
Rivers had very low levels of heterozygosity. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were detected
(Table 2).
Bottlenecks

Recent bottleneck was detected in the Rzav River (SMM
and TPM), P < 0.05. Mode-shift test also revealed distortion from L-shape allele frequency distribution in the
same river. Coalescent analyses assuming an exponential
population growth/decline estimated that the population
decline started 1000 - 10 000 years ago with the present
population sizes representing 0.03-0.44% of the historical sizes (Figure 4).

bootstraps for NJ (1000 replicates) above, and maximum parsimony consensus (1000) below; italicized taxa represent newly sampled haplotypes.

Population differentiation, clustering and introgression

Pairwise FST comparison revealed significant differences
among all populations (Table 3). This was also visible in
the DAS based tree (Figure 5) and in the individual clustering results by Structure, where four clusters corresponded roughly to the four populations from Serbia
(Figure 6). Further intra-population partitioning using
Structure did not reveal any new cluster and no hybrid

population was detected. (See additional file 3: The original data used to perform this analysis).

Discussion
Mitochondrial DNA

Two combined haplotypes, Da27Bal and Da29BoDr are
autochthonous for populations from Serbian waters
while haplotypes Da25Soc18 and Da25Slo originate

from Slovenia (Table 1). The practice of stocking with
grayling was common in many European countries
[15,25,48]. Despite the absence of written records on
stocking in Rzav and Drina Rivers with grayling fry originating from Slovenian hatcheries, testimonies from the
older members of the Anglers’ Association of Arilje do
agree that grayling was introduced into the Rzav River
from Slovenia in the 1980’s. This is supported by the
fact that haplotype Da25 also occurs in Slovenian populations (unpublished data). The 0.75% genetic distance
between autochthonous Da27 and Da29 haplotypes for
which the mutation rate is estimated at about 1% per
million years [3,14,49], suggests that a time period of
about 750 thousand years separates the two haplotypes

involving probably two independent colonization events.
This assumption is supported by the even greater
genetic distance (~1.35%) occurring between the two
groups of haplotypes (Da22, Da23) and (Da24, Da25) in
the Slovenian grayling sub-clade.
Within the Balkan clade, the division between northern (Slovenian) and southern (Serbian) populations is
obvious. This northern/southern differentiation has also
been recorded in another Danubian salmonid species i.e.
huchen (Hucho hucho) on the basis of microsatellite
data [50].
The grayling Balkan and the Scandinavian clades are
sister clades (Figure 2), suggesting a common ancestry
in the drainage areas of Black and Caspian seas. This is
in agreement with the ancestral character of the grayling
populations from a Danubian refugium in relation to the
northern populations [3,5]. The intermediate position of
the Da29 haplotype on the network between northern
Balkan and Scandinavian clades supports this statement.
Da29 could be considered as the basal haplotype of the
Balkan clade, with the genetic distance between Da29
and other haplotypes ranging between 0.75 and 1.65%,
which is equivalent to the time scale of 750 000-1.65
million years when grayling of northern, Slovenian and
southern, Serbian clusters differentiated. This is similar

to the distance (~1.5%) found between the two northern
and southern Alpine clades [3].
Including the ATP6 gene to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships in European grayling clades is not very
useful at present because most studies are based on CR
or other mtDNA sequences. Analyzing the ATP6 gene
in grayling populations of Serbia confirms the division,
previously observed from CR sequencing results, into
two subclades (the northern i.e. Slovenian and the
southern i.e.Serbian) in the Balkan clade defined by the
synapomorphy at position 34 of the ATP6 gene (see
additional file 2).
Results obtained so far suggest that the ATP6 gene
will be a useful marker for future investigations on
European grayling populations, since it provides interesting information on genetic variability. This could be
important for decisions in conservation and management
of grayling populations.
Microsatellite markers

In terms of microsatellite diversity (allelic richness,
observed and expected heterozygosities), populations
from this study are comparable to other populations
[7,51]. FST pairwise comparisons and Structure analyses
reveal a strong divergence between Serbian grayling

populations, which is not characteristic of Slovenian
grayling in the Danubian drainage [11,52]. Recent bottleneck has been shown in population from the Rzav
River, which has suffered a recent decline. In addition,
the Rzav River habitat is relatively small and was initially
stocked with (presumably) a small number of fish from
Slovenia.
Serbian locations represent the furthest grayling
habitats from the maximal extent of ice sheets [21] and
possibly grayling glacial refugium (or closest to it).
Nevertheless the historical decline of Serbian populations is comparable with other European populations
analyzed by Swatdipong et al. [24] and is dated between
1000 and 10 000 years ago.
The Rzav population shares 19 out of 21 alleles (90%)
with Slovenian populations (Sava, Obrh and Unec combined), while the Drina, Lim and Ibar populations share
47, 56 and 53% of alleles with Slovenian populations,
respectively. The two alleles in the Rzav population not
shared with Slovenian populations are found in other
Serbian populations, which means that there is no Rzav
specific allele. This is not surprising since the river was
not naturally inhabited by grayling. While stocking of
the Rzav River is confirmed both by the mtDNA haplotypes (100% Da25) and the 90% alleles shared with Slovenian populations, the situation in the Drina River is
different. Although 40% of the Drina River samples had
the Da25 haplotype, hybridization with non-native grayling was not detected by nuclear markers. The percentage of shared alleles with the Slovenian populations
was lowest in Drina River (47%), most likely because the
population had already the highest genetic diversity
prior stocking. Influence of stocking in the Drina River
was not detected in its tributary i.e. the Lim River,
which is in accordance to the generally low migration

rates for the species [6,16,53]. While Lim and Ibar Rivers are inhabited by native non-introgressed grayling of
lower genetic diversity, the Drina River population is
admixed and the most diverse in the region.

Conclusions
Serbian grayling populations are genetically distinct
from Slovenian and other European populations. In
order to preserve their overall genetic diversity and
integrity, further stocking of non-native fish from other
regions or from allochthonous populations in the Rzav
River should be stopped. Populations from the Ibar and
Lim Rivers (which show no signs of introgression of
non-native grayling), as well as the population from the
Drina River should be regarded as native and subject to
proper management. The population from the Drina
River is the most diverse in this study and the only one
with the mtDNA haplotype Da29. It probably represents
the most valuable genetic resource in the region. However, any future management such as supplementary
stocking of hatchery-reared Drina River grayling should
take into consideration genetic testing prior formation
of brood stock, because introgression has been detected.
Since the area studied here represents only a minor part
of the Balkan Peninsula, genetic polymorphism of the
grayling within the region as a whole may be even
higher, because grayling from the countries adjacent to
Serbia (i.e., Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina) have
not been studied so far.
