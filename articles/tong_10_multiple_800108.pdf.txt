Abstract
Background: We recently characterized HAmo SINE and its partner LINE in silver carp and bighead carp based on
hybridization capture of repetitive elements from digested genomic DNA in solution using a bead-probe [1]. To reveal
the distribution and evolutionary history of SINEs and LINEs in cyprinid genomes, we performed a multi-species search
for HAmo SINE and its partner LINE using the bead-probe capture and internal-primer-SINE polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques.
Results: Sixty-seven full-size and 125 internal-SINE sequences (as well as 34 full-size and 9 internal sequences
previously reported in bighead carp and silver carp) from 17 species of the family Cyprinidae were aligned as well as 14
new isolated HAmoL2 sequences. Four subfamilies (type I, II, III and IV), which were divided based on diagnostic
nucleotides in the tRNA-unrelated region, expanded preferentially within a certain lineage or within the whole family
of Cyprinidae as multiple active source genes. The copy numbers of HAmo SINEs were estimated to vary from 104 to
106 in cyprinid genomes by quantitative RT-PCR. Over one hundred type IV members were identified and characterized
in the primitive cyprinid Danio rerio genome but only tens of sequences were found to be similar with type I, II and III
since the type IV was the oldest subfamily and its members dispersed in almost all investigated cyprinid fishes. For
determining the taxonomic distribution of HAmo SINE, inter-primer SINE PCR was conducted in other non-cyprinid
fishes, the results shows that HAmo SINE- related sequences may disperse in other families of order Cypriniforms but
absent in other orders of bony fishes: Siluriformes, Polypteriformes, Lepidosteiformes, Acipenseriformes and
Osteoglossiforms.
Conclusions: Depending on HAmo LINE2, multiple source genes (subfamilies) of HAmo SINE actively expanded and
underwent retroposition in a certain lineage or within the whole family of Cyprinidae. From this perspective, HAmo
SINE should provide useful phylogenetic makers for future analyses of the evolutionary relationships among species in
the family Cyprinidae.
Background
Retrotransposons are widely distributed among eukaryotic genomes and occupy a substantial fraction of
genome. These repeats increase in number by retroposition, which involves transcription of their genomic copies
followed by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate
and results in cDNAs reintegration into the genome host
[2-4]. Retrotransposons are divided into LTR elements,

long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and short
interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs)[5].
Both LINEs and SINEs become amplified in genomes
during evolution, but while LINEs encode the enzymes
required for their retrotransposition, SINEs presumably
borrow these enzymes from other sources, most likely
from LINEs [6,7]. Researchers have observed that the
sequences of many SINE and LINE pairs isolated from
many organisms are similar in their 3'end regions [8-11].
Recently, we characterized a couple of SINE and LINE,
designated HAmo SINE and its partner LINE, in silver
carp and bighead carp based on hybridization capture of
repetitive elements from digested genomic DNA in solu-

tion using a bead-probe [1]. We found that HAmo SINEs
was active and amplified recently in the genomes of these
two young species utilizing the enzymatic machinery for
retroposition of HAmoL2 [1].
SINEs are short (approximately 80 to 400 bp) repetitive
elements that often are present at more than 105 copies
per genome. Many SINEs can be categorized into families
based on sequence similarity and into subfamilies based
on the presence of diagnostic nucleotides and/or deletions. An active member of a subfamily yields new copies
through retroposition. After their dispersion within the
genome, individual nonactive members of a subfamily
accumulate mutations randomly. Thus, the average
sequence divergence of members of a subfamily can be
used to roughly estimate the age of the subfamily [12].
A typical SINE is composed of three parts: the tRNArelated region, the tRNA-unrelated region and the LINEderived region with a polyA or short duplication tail. The
existence of RNA Pol III promoters in the tRNA-related
region ensures the transcriptional activity of SINEs,
whereas the LINE-derived region allows the SINE to utilize the LINEs's enzymes for retrotransposition. The central region (the tRNA-unrelated region) between the
tRNA- and LINE-derived regions is quite different and is
not strongly conserved between different families,
although two conserved central regions have been
reported for two SINE families (V-SINE and Core-SINE)
[13,14].
To reveal the species distribution and evolutionary history of SINEs and LINEs in more cyprinid genomes, we
performed a multi-species search for HAmo SINE and its
partner LINE in almost all subfamilies of Cyprinidae, as
well as in distantly related fishes (including other four
families of order Cypriniforms and the other orders Siluriformes, Polypteriformes, Lepidosteiformes, Acipenseriformes, Osteoglossiforms) using the bead-probe capture
and internal-SINE-primer polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques. The detailed sequence alignment and
nucleotide diversity estimation of HAmo SINE characterized to date enabled us to understand amplification and
evolution of HAmo SINE in cyprinid fishes.

Methods
Tissue and DNA samples

Table 1 lists the fish species examined in this study and
their geographic sources. Chen et al.'s latest taxonomic
revision divides the family Cyprinidae into 12 subfamilies: Danioninae, Leuciscinae, Cultrinae, Xenocyprinae,
Hypophthalmichthyinae, Cobioninae, Gobiobotinae,
Acheilognathinae, Barbinae, Labeoninae, Schizothoracinae, and Cyprininae [15]. According to the recent
cyprinid molecular phylogeny based on the rag2 gene,
monophyly for the subfamilies Cyprininae and Leucisci-

nae and for the tribes Labeonini, Gobionini, Acheilognathini, and Leuciscini was well resolved with high nodal
support. However, the cyprinid taxa endemic in East Asia
emerged as a young monophyletic clade referred to as
Xenocypridini. In this study, we selected 12 typical species to represent all subfamilies of family Cyprinidae as
well as 5 other conflicting species that belong to the
Xenocypridini (Table 1). All species DNA was isolated
from ethanol-fixed tissues (fins or muscle) by incubation
with proteinase K followed by phenol/chloroform extraction [16].
Isolation of SINE and LINE sequences using bead-probe
capture and internal-primer-SINE PCR techniques

A rapid bead-probe capture technique based on magnetic
separation was used to isolate full-size of HAmo SINE
copies from unknown genomes as described previously
[1]. The clone Hmo41_It was bound to beads to act as the
probe for capturing HAmo SINE similar sequences from
a HaeIII-fragmented genomic DNA pool (Table 1). The
beads were washed once with 200 μL hybridization buffer
(5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 5 min, then 150 μL of the denatured genomic pool were added to the resuspend the
beads. Hybridization at 55°C took place for 2 hours, then
non-complementary sequences were removed by washing successively with 400 μl TEN1000 (10 mM Tris-HCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1000 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) three times for 5
min each; and 400 μl buffer (0.2×SSC,0.1%SDS) three
times for 5 min; 400 μl TEN1000 for 10 min. Finally, the
captured fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned
directly into T-vector for sequencing. Additionally, many
LINE sequences were isolated simultaneously during the
above process because the probe contains the common
tail shared by SINE and LINE.
Internal-primer-SINE PCR was conducted to amplify
the internal region corresponding to residues 18-144 of
the whole HAmo SINE consensus sequences (residues
1-150) using a pair of primers (primer ItF, 5-TGGTTAGAGCATGGCACTAGCAA-3, primer ItR, 5-TGCATT
TGGCAGACGCTTTTATC-3). The PCR was run in a
total volume of 20 μl including 200 ng DNA template
with 25 cycles of 95°C for 40 s, 62°C for 40 s, and 72°C
for 40 s. The internal-primer-SINE-PCR was conducted
in the selected 17 species of Cyprinidae to detect many
individual SINE copies. Finally, about 10 clones were
characterized and sequenced for each species.
Naming of Clones

Many HAmo sequences (full-size or internal) were isolated and characterized from distinct cyprinids fishes.
Each locus was named after the number of the clone and
the name of the species from which it was isolated. In the
middle, F or I was used to represent the internal SINE

respectively. For example, Ltu_I_4 means that the number of the clone was 4 and it was isolated from Leuciscus

Estimation of copy number using quantitative RT-PCR

Plasmid Hmo41_It and Genomic DNA were prepared as
the standard and samples for Real-Time PCR, respectively (Table 2). Their concentrations then were measured
using a spectrophotometer, and serial dilutions were prepared as templates to perform RT-PCR in a PCR machine
(Bio-Rad, Chromo4 HERCULES, CA, USA) together. All
Real-Time PCR was performed with 40 cycles at 95°C 40
s, 62°C 40 s, 72°C 40 s including Primer ItF and ItR (300
nM final concentration) and SYBR GREEN in a final volume of 25 uL. At last, a melting curve analysis was done
after the amplification phase. The standard curve and
data analysis were carried out in the software MJ Opticon
Monitor 3.1.

Construction of phylogenetic relationships of 17 fish
species based on the rag2 gene

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Bayesian
inference within the program MrBayes 3.1.1 [17,18]. The
rag2 sequences used in this study were reported previously by our group [19]. For the Bayesian analysis, two
million generations were completed, with tree and
parameter values recorded every 1000 generations. Four
chains were run in each of the two independent analyses
that MrBayes executed as a default. The chain heating
temperature was set to 0.2. At the end of the analysis the
first 25% of stored trees were eliminated by setting sumtburnin to 1000, and the remaining trees were automatically compiled into a consensus tree by the program.

netic separation system. These SINEs were similar to the
consensus sequence of HAmo SINE reported for silver
carp and bighead carp, which has a tRNAlys-related promoter region at the 5'end, a unique family-specific region,
and an end with a HAmo-LINE2-derived 3' terminus preceding the TAAATG short tandem repeat. Remarkably,
HAmo SINE seems to be widely distributed in cyprinid
genomes and multiple subfamilies may exist based on
preliminary observation of their high diversity.
Internal-primer-SINE PCR which amplified fragments
corresponding to residues 18-144 of the HAmo SINE
consensus sequence (residues 1-150) were conducted.
The result showed that HAmo SINE was present in all 17
representatives of the family Cyprinidae tested in this
study. To unambiguously confirm them and obtain
enough HAmo SINE sequences to observe their diversities, we cloned the positive fragments and sequenced
about 10 positive clones for each species. Moreover, 125
internal sequences corresponding to different individual
HAmo-SINE copies from the 17 cyprinid genomes were
isolated and characterized.
Four subfamilies and their different patterns of polyA
insertion and short tandem duplication in tRNA-unrelated
region

Sixty-seven full-size sequences and 125 internal-SINE
sequences (plus 34 full-size and 9 internal sequences previously reported in bighead carp and silver carp) [1] from
17 species of the family Cyprinidae were aligned. On the

basis of the presence of the diagnostic nucleotides, four
subfamilies (type I, II, III and IV) exist, each of which is
supported by abundant sequences from many distantly
related species. Figure 2 shows the alignment of the consensus sequences of the four HAmo SINE subfamilies;
the consistent nucleotide changes for each subfamily
(diagnostic nucleotides) were recognized at 30 positions.
Most of the diagnostic nucleotides (23 of 30) were distributed in the tRNA-unrelated region of HAmo SINE, and
the diagnostic nucleotides were composed of different
patterns of polyA insertion, short tandem repeats, and
deletion or mutation in the respective subfamilies.
Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the alignments of
the four subfamilies. Type I is supported by 91 sequences
from 12 species, with a calculated average sequence
divergence of 3.7%. It contains 34 of our previously
reported young HAmo sequences from silver carp and
bighead carp [1], which have been identified as having
proliferate recently. Type II and III are divided by only
five dispersed diagnostic nucleotides and they expanded
preferentially in the different lineages (Figure 6, see discussion). Type IV may be the most divergent subfamily
because many members have different short deletion
regions. We deduced that type I may be the youngest subfamily based on the small divergence among its members
and on the expansion that is evident in some species (the
Xenocyprinidini clade), which likely was generated very
recently on the time scale. Moreover, most of the type I

sequences in silver carp and bighead carp are speciesspecific and even not fixed among the population [1].
The four subfamilies can be distinguished from each
other mainly by their different tRNA-unrelated regions.
The different patterns of insertion and duplication in different subfamilies constitute the most diagnostic nucleotides that lead to division of the family into different
subfamilies. Type I has a variable polyA (1-14) insertions
and a TATAA repeat two to three times. Type II has two
variable polyA(3-9, 4-10) insertions whereas type III has a
TAAATG sequence that repeats two times.
The common tail is conserved in primary and secondary
structures between HAmo SINE and HAmo LINE

Many HAmo LINE2 clones were obtained simultaneously
when isolating HAmo SINEs (Figure 6) because the probe
contained a tail region shared by HAmo SINE and its
partner LINE. A consensus sequence of the HAmo
LINE2 tail was constructed by aligning all 14 isolated
HAmo LINEs (in this paper) plus 14 previously reported
in silver carp and bighead carp. The consensus sequences
of the four HAmo SINE subfamilies shared an almost
identical 42-bp-long 3'tail to HAmo LINE (Figure 2), suggesting that HAmo SINE may borrow the enzymatic
machinery of HAmo LINE to proliferate in the cyprinid
genomes through the conserved 3' -tail.
Estimation of copy number using quantitative RT-PCR

To estimate the number of copies of HAmo SINE in each
species, the pair of primers used in internal-primer-

SINE-PCR was also used to amplify the HAmo SINE
sequences in genomic DNA (sample) and in the plasmid
Hmo41_It (standard) using RT-PCR. We used two
diluted genomic DNA as tested samples to perform PCR
reaction. The final estimations of copy numbers using different concentrations of the genomic DNA template were
very close, suggesting that the results of the experiment
were stable and efficient. Table 2 summarizes the detailed
results. The copy numbers of HAmo elements in 12
cyprinid genomes were estimated to vary from 104 to 106.
In other words, HAmo SINE may constitute 0.1-10% of
cyprinid genomes (about 109 bp). Considering the possibility of mismatch between primers with more divergent
HAmo SINE sequences, the results of quantitative RTPCR were minimal estimates of HAmo SINE copy numbers in respective genomes.
HAmo SINE in zebrafish genome

Danio rerio was a cyprinid fish belonging to Danioninae,
Cyprinidae. In previous research, the trees resulting from
cyprinid phylogenetic analyses of the RAG2 gene place
the Danioninae as the basal-most group in the family and
divide the remaining cyprinids into two divergent subfamilies Cyprininae and Leuciscinae [19]. In this paper, 17
cyprinid fish were selected for representing various taxa
within Cyprinidae, and their phylogeny based on rag2
gene (Figure 6) also revealed the pattern that within the
Cyprinidae, Danio emerged at first and the remaining
cyprinid species clustered into two major clades, Cyprini-

nae and Leuciscinae. The basal relationship of the Danioninae, relative to other Cyprinidae, has also been
confirmed in other recent molecular analyses [20,21].
For investigating the HAmo SINE in zebrafish, the consensus sequences of four subfamilies (type I, II, III and
IV) were used as queries to blastn Danio rerio database in
NCBI website. Because the primer regions of these consensus sequences are identical and uninformative, we
eliminated these regions from the whole consensus
sequences, as shown in Figure 2. These consensus
sequences were about 83-91 bp in length containing

about 31-37 bp central region and partial tRNA-related
region and LINE2-derived region. We set the parameter e

were found to be similar with the consensus sequences of
type I, II and III, respectively. Because these similar
sequences in zebrafish are too divergent with the corresponding type I, II and III consensus sequences, espe-

Figure 4 Alignment of HAmo Type II and Type III members. The consensus sequences are shown on top. The most frequently occurring nucleotide at a position was chosen as the consensus nucleotide at the position. The tRNA-derived region and LINE-related region of SINE are shown by
thick bar. Star indicates the diagnostic nucleotide between type II and type III. In the central region, type II has two variable polyA insertion in number
(3-9, 4-10, respectively). Type III has a TAAATG repeated two times. The GenBank accession numbers of them are as follows: GQ370904-GQ370934.

cially in the central region representing the most specific
diagnostic nucleotide, we couldn't determine the presence of type I, II and III of HAmo SINE in zebrafish. As
our described, Type I mainly distributed in lineage Leuciscinae and Type II were found only in some species.
Their restricted species distribution may lead to the
absence of them in primitive cyprinid species Danio
rerio. In contrast, we found 105 sequences similar with
consensus sequence of type IV with identity 72%-90% in
zebrafish. Majority of them can be identified and characterized to be members of type IV since type IV were the
oldest subfamily and its members have more divergence
between sequences and dispersed in the whole Cyprinidae. The alignment of type IV sequences in zebrafish with
the consensus sequence of type IV in this paper was provided as Additional file 1.

Moreover, among our isolated HAmo internal
sequences in 17 cyprinid fishes, there are tens of HAmo
sequences that have more divergent central region with
each other as well as with the type I, II, III and IV (Figure
6, type U, Additional file 2). We couldn't divide them into
specific subfamilies now because of lacking enough supported sequences. When using them as queries to blastn
Danio rerio genome, tens or hundreds sequences similar
with many queries have been found in zebrafish. In addition, we also obtained 7 HAmo SINE sequences by cloning the inter-primer SINE PCR products in zebrafish,
provided in Additional file 3. All these evidences manifest
that numerous HAmo SINE copies presented in the
primitive cyprinid fish Danio rerio and dispersed in the
whole Cyprinidae.

Discussion
Multiple source genes are responsible for amplification of
the HAmo SINE in Cyprinid genomes

In this work, we isolated and characterized many HAmo
SINEs from 17 species of the Cyprinidae family. The
results show that the HAmo SINE is widespread in
cyprinid genomes and that copy numbers are about 104106.
Based on the rag2 gene, we constructed the phylogenetic relationships among the 17 species studied in order
to map the information obtained from isolated clones in
each species (Figure 6). The ratio of different subfamily
clones found in each species could roughly reflect the lineage in which the subfamilies expanded preferentially,
although potential statistical bias resulting from the small
number of clones analyzed exists. The result of this analysis showed that type I preferentially expanded in the clade
Leuciscinae, especially in the tribe Xenocyprinidini,
which contained many young and closely related endemic
taxa from East Asia. In contrast, Type II distributed on
some non- Xenocyprinidini species, whereas Type III and
IV seemed to be dispersed throughout the whole Cyprinidae family. Judging from the distribution of members of
the same sequence subfamily of SINEs within different
lineages and from the distribution of the differentsequence subfamilies within the same lineage, we concluded that multiple dispersed loci are responsible for the
amplification of SINEs in cyprinid genomes. In other
words, multiple rivalrous source genes (subfamilies)
expanded in cyprinid genomes and showed different
advantages of expansion in different lineages. The different advantage of expansion among subfamilies may
results from the retropositional regulation to source
genes in the process of transcription and selection at the
RNA level. Many factors, such as the chromatin context

near a newly transposed SINE, methylation, cis-acfing
promoter elements, and trans-acting factors involve in
this process [22-24]. Because the effects of these factors
might differ among species, frequencies of retroposition
might also differ among specific lineages [25].
From the mapping results, type I seems to have
expanded actively in the Leuciscinae clade and to have
undergone retroposition among populations of silver
carp and bighead carp. However, type I seems not to have
flourished in the Cyprininae clade, as there are only two
clones found in two species. Thus, we deduced that the
master (source) gene of type I was first generated in a
common ancestor of the family Cyprinidae, and then this
gene was vertically inherited during evolution of the
cyprinid lineage. A highly dominant source gene for the
type I subfamily may have been newly created by retroposition and actively amplified in the Leuciscinae clade.
This scenario indicates that the actual sequence of this
subfamily might not be the cause of the high retropositional efficiency of SINEs. A local environment such as
the site of retroposition, RNA secondary structure, and
promoter activity might be crucial for the establishment
of a highly dominant source gene during evolution [25].
The above analysis indicates that multiple source genes
(subfamilies) actively amplified within a certain lineage or
within the whole family of Cyprinidae. Therefore, the
changes (diagnostic nucleotides) that occurred in the
tRNA-unrelated region may not affect the efficiency of
retroposition of different actively dominant source genes
(subfamilies). The high efficiency and successful proliferation of HAmo SINEs might have occurred for two reasons. First, HAmo SINEs retain the overall secondary
structure and conserved the A and B box in the tRNArelated region, which ensures the RNA pol III recognition
and transcriptional activity of SINEs. Second, the 3' tail of

Figure 6 Mapping different subfamilies and copy numbers to the phylogenetic tree. A) Based on the rag2 sequences, the phylogenetic tree of
17 fishes representing different tribes of Cyprinidae family was constructed using Bayesian inference. Among them, the rag2 sequences of three species Distoechodon hupeinensis, Shizothorax grahami, Barbodes opisthoptera was substituted by another closely related species in the same genus respectively, because the absence of their rag2 sequences in GenBank. The trees resulting from phylogenetic analyses of the RAG2 gene place the
Danioninae as the basal-most group in the family and divide the remaining cyprinids into two divergent subfamilies Cyprininae and Leuciscinae. The
arrow denoted the Xenocyprinidini clade, containing silver carp, bighead carp and their closely related species endemic to East Asia. B) This part listed
the clone numbers of SINE and LINE isolated from each species and the copy numbers estimated by qRT-PCR. The mapping results shows the four
subfamilies, as multiple active source genes, expanded preferentially in a certain lineage or the whole family of Cyprinidae. The star indicated that the
whole clones contain 21 and 15 of HAmo type I reported previously. The seventh column (U) denoted the unidentified SINE sequences that cannot
be classified into a kind of type.

HAmo SINEs and HAmo LINE2 is almost identical in
primary sequence and secondary structures, which
allows the former to utilize the LINE2 enzymatic machinery.
The species distribution of HAmo SINE

To determine the species distribution of HAmo SINE,
Inter-primer SINE PCR was also conducted in noncyprinid fishes. Four different ten-fold DNA dosage: 0.1
ng, 1 ng, 10 ng, 100 ng were used for each species. Firstly,
for 17 cyprinid fishes, visible PCR band could be
observed when 0.1 ng DNA was used as template in PCR

(Figure 7A). Secondly, in the case of DNA of noncyprinid fishes in Cypriniform, PCR products were
observed when 1 ng DNA of Myxocyprinus asiaticus
(Catostomidae), Hemimyzon abbreviata (Homalopteridae), Gyrinocheilus aymonieri (Gyrinocheilidae) and 10
ng DNA of Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (Cobitidae) were
used, as shown in Figure 7B. We cloned and sequenced
these PCR products from these species. 3-7 HAmo SINE
related sequences with average identity about 70% were
obtained in each species, see Additional file 3. All these
sequences and the gel electrophoresis show that HAmo
SINE-related sequences may presented in the other fami-

lies of order Cypriniform. We deduced that the more
DNA (1 ng or 10 ng compared to 0.1 ng) must be used in
PCR for detection of HAmo SINE may result from the
mutation in primer-matched regions of HAmo sequences
in the investigated species since the investigated species
diverged more with cyprinids. More evidence and
sequences need to be obtained to determine the SINE
family in other families of order Cypriniform.
In Siluriformes, two species were used: Gagata dolichonema (Sisoridae), Pseudobagrus truncatus (Bagridae).
Some PCR products were generated only when 100 ng
DNA template were used (Figure 7C). We sequenced the
PCR products and found that they belong to the non-specific amplified products. In the case of other order of
bony fishes, the PCR product corresponding to the

Conclusions
In conclusion, by searching for HAmo SINEs from different taxa within the Cyprinidae, we found that HAmo
SINEs were widespread in cyprinid genomes. The hundreds of SINE sequences found in our study revealed that
multiple source subfamilies actively expanded and underwent retroposition within a certain lineage or within the
whole family of Cyprinidae. Thus, HAmo SINE should be
a useful phylogenetic marker for future analyses of the
evolutionary relationships among species in the Cyprinidae family.
