Abstract
Background: A major challenge for evolutionary biology is explaining altruism, particularly when
it involves death of one party and occurs across species. Chimeric fruiting bodies of Dictyostelium
discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum develop from formerly independent amoebae, and some die
to help others. Here we examine co-aggregation between D. discoideum and D. purpureum,
determine its frequency and which party benefits, and the extent of fair play in contribution to the
altruistic caste.
Results: We mixed cells from both species in equal proportions, and then we analyzed 198
individual fruiting bodies, which always had either a D. discoideum or D. purpureum phenotype (D.
discoideum- 98, D. purpureum- 100). Fifty percent of the fruiting bodies that looked like D. discoideum
and 22% of the fruiting bodies that looked like D. purpureum were chimeric, though the majority of
spores in any given fruiting body belonged to one species (D. discoideum fruiting bodies- 0.85 ± 0.03,
D. purpureum fruiting bodies- 0.94 ± 0.02). Clearly, there is species level recognition occurring that
keeps the cells mostly separate. The number of fruiting bodies produced with the D. discoideum
phenotype increased from 225 ± 32 fruiting bodies when D. discoideum was alone to 486 ± 61 in
the mix treatments. However, the number of D. discoideum spores decreased, although not
significantly, from 2.75e7 ± 1.29e7 spores in the controls to 2.06e7 ± 8.33e6 spores in the mix
treatments. D. purpureum fruiting body and spore production decreased from 719 ± 111 fruiting
bodies and 5.81e7 ± 1.26e7 spores in the controls to 394 ± 111 fruiting bodies and 9.75e6 ± 2.25e6
spores in the mix treatments.
Conclusion: Both species appear to favor clonality but can cooperate with each other to produce
fruiting bodies. Cooperating amoebae are able to make larger fruiting bodies, which are
advantageous for migration and dispersal, but both species here suffer a cost in producing fewer
spores per fruiting body.

Background
Cooperative relationships between different species are
common in nature [1-3]. They can be found in every environment, from cactus pollinators in the desert [4] to
microbial symbionts in the ocean [5]. The evolution of
cooperation presents a conundrum. How do these relationships evolve and remain stable over generations? Why
would selection favor altruism and cooperation when
cheaters could reap the benefits of an interaction without
paying any of the associated costs [6-9]?
Only in recent years have the worlds of microbiologists
and evolutionary biologists merged to begin interdisciplinary studies on cooperation in microorganisms [10,11].
The social amoebae of the genus Dictyostelium present
ideal candidates for studying microbial interactions. The
first species, D. mucoroides Brefeld, was isolated from
horse dung more than a century ago. Today approximately one hundred species have been formally described
[12]. In 1984, Raper set up a comprehensive taxonomic
system that classified all species based on morphological
differences such as the presence or absence of polar spore
granules, sorus color, stalk features, and overall size [13].
Recently, Schaap et al. derived a phylogenetic tree of
almost every described species using SSU rDNA gene

sequences that now allows more exact species identification [14].
While there are some differences in behavior, most species
follow the same lifecycle. All dictyostelid species spend
the majority of their lifecycle as solitary amoebae living on
the forest floor, eating bacteria. When the cells begin to
starve, they send out a signal, which is cyclic AMP in many
species, causing all nearby cells to aggregate together. In
some species, such as D. discoideum (Figure 1A), the cells
form a multi-cellular slug that then migrates to a new
location. Once migration is complete, approximately onefifth of the cells will altruistically die to form a sterile stalk
to hold aloft the remaining cells, which have formed a
sorus consisting of viable spores [13,15]. In other species,
including D. purpureum (Figure 1B), the slug forms a sterile stalk as it migrates to a new location. Once migration
is complete, the stalk becomes vertical and the sorus
forms. At this stage in the lifecycle of Dictyostelium conflict
may occur as the amoebae make the transition to multicellularity from individual cells. Some of the cells undergo
the ultimate sacrifice of dying to form the sterile stalk,
leaving the majority to form fertile spores. This altruistic
behavior will be favored by natural selection only if those
cells are able to pass on their genes through relatives, who
may often be clone mates. The higher the relatedness to

The life 1
The life cycle of two Dictyostelium species. Both species have a similar developmental lifecycle until the slug stage. The
darker cells are the spore cells and the lighter cells are the stalk cells. 1) The cells eat bacteria and reproduce asexually. 2)
Upon starvation, the cells begin to aggregate together using cyclic AMP as a chemo-attractant. 3) In late aggregation, the cells
form a mound. 4) The cells form a multicellular slug. In D. discoideum, the slug migrates to a new location, forms a stalk, and
then completes development. In D. purpureum, the slug forms a stalk as it migrates to a new location and then completes development. 5) The final fruiting body stage where some of the cells have become sterile to form a stalk and hold up the reproductive spore body.

spore cells, and the greater the advantage to having a stalk,
the more the stalk cells will benefit from paying the cost
and the less conflict there will be between the two cell
types. The social behavior of Dictyostelium discoideum
makes it an ideal model to study social evolution [16]. It
has been shown, both in the lab and in nature, that D. discoideum clones will form chimeras [16-19]. In these chimeric fruiting bodies, conflict can occur. Foster et al. [17]
reported that chimeric slugs migrate less far than clonal
slugs of the same size, indicating that some form of conflict between the clones is occurring within the slug. Additionally, some clones of D. discoideum have the ability to
cheat other D. discoideum clones in chimeras by forcing
them into the stalk, leading to an unequal representation
in the fruiting body [16]. Recently it has been shown that
clones of two other species of social amoeba, D. purpureum and D. giganteum form intraspecific chimeras
[18,19].
A single soil sample of a fifth of a gram may contain several clones and species [20]. Yet, the formation of interspecific chimeras has not been carefully studied even
though many of these species aggregate to the same
chemo-attractant, cyclic AMP. Olive [21] first looked for
and failed to find chimeras of D. purpureum and D.
mucoroides, followed by two other groups almost fifty
years later [22,23]. Neither group managed to find chimeras under normal aggregation conditions. Another
researcher, Hagiwara [24], made some preliminary interspecific mixtures while he explored whether aggregating
streams of cells of three different genera of Dictyostelids
mixed or overlapped in any way. His work verified that
many species use the same chemo-attractants.
A molecular phylogeny of the Dictyostelids based on
small subunit RNA and α-tubulin sequences shows subdivision of all known species into four major groups. D. discoideum, D. purpureum, and D. giganteum are all members
of Group 4, a group where all of the studied species aggregate and respond to the same chemo-attractant, cAMP
[14]. Most of the studies exploring social behavior in the
Dictyostelids have concentrated on within-species interactions in D. discoideum. Although they are found in the
same group and have similar biological properties, D. discoideum and D. purpureum are not even close sister species.
Ninety percent of the homologs between D. discoideum
and D. purpureum have less than 75% identity and over
60% of the homologs have diverged so long ago that dS
cannot be calculated due to synonymous site saturation
[Xiangjun Tian, pers. comm.]. However, species interactions between members of Group 4 have not been closely
studied, even though these species are often found
together in nature. Here we test the hypothesis that D. discoideum and D. purpureum form chimeric fruiting bodies
when mixed together and we examine the affect of this

interaction on both spore production and fruiting body
production.

Results
Chimerism of D. discoideum and D. purpureum fruiting
bodies
We found that more than 30% of the fruiting bodies we
examined were chimeric in 20 out of 21 trials where the
initial cell suspension contained an equal number of cells
of both species. All fruiting bodies in each experiment displayed either the D. discoideum phenotype or the D. purpureum phenotype. None of the fruiting bodies, including
those that were chimeric, displayed an intermediate phenotype.

Forty-nine of the 98 D. discoideum fruiting bodies examined contained spores of D. purpureum, while only 22 of
the 100 D. purpureum fruiting bodies contained D. discoideum spores (W14,13 = 124, n = 27, p < 0.05).
The majority species in the chimeras, with a few exceptions, determined the phenotype. Chimeric D. discoideum
fruiting bodies contained an average of 26.8 ± 4.4% D.
purpureum spores per clone while chimeric D. purpureum
fruiting bodies had 29.5 ± 9.2% D. discoideum spores
(W12,8 = 51, n = 20, p = 0.851). For the exceptions, in 20%
of the chimeric fruiting bodies examined in both species,
the minority species determined the phenotype. In those
D. discoideum chimeras the average composition of the
fruiting bodies was 82.7 ± 4.9% D. purpureum spores but
4 of the 10 fruiting bodies showed only D. purpureum
spores. In those D. purpureum chimeras the average composition of the fruiting bodies was 73.1 ± 9.6% D. discoideum spores and only 1 of the 5 fruiting bodies showed
only D. discoideum spores. However, when we include all
fruiting bodies, chimeric and clonal, from the experimental plates, fruiting bodies with the D. discoideum phenotype contained a higher percentage of 'nonself' spores,
than D. purpureum fruiting bodies, although it was not significant. (DDnonself spores = 16.04 ± 4.52%, DPnonself spores =
5.44 ± 1.90%, W14,13 = 125, n = 27, p = 0.101, Figures 2A–
B).
Numbers of fruiting bodies with the morphology of D.
discoideum vs. D. purpureum
We counted the number of fruiting bodies produced by
each species on the control plates (each species alone) and
on the experimental plates (50:50 mix of the two species)
to compare the number of fruiting bodies produced after
we standardized for the difference in cell number. We distinguished the fruiting bodies based solely on phenotype
and not on whether the fruiting bodies may have contained spores of the other species. In the controls, D. discoideum produced 225 ± 32 fruiting bodies per 2 × 107
cells, while D. purpureum produced an average of 719 ±

The effects
The effects of the interaction of D. discoideum and D. purpureum. The graphs show the results of analyses of D. discoideum and D. purpureum by clone, both when alone and when mixed with each other. A-B: The composition of the fruiting bodies of each species, alone and mixed, where the higher the percentage means the more clonal the fruiting body. C-D: Fruiting
body production of each species, alone and when mixed, after being standardized for the number of cells of each species added
to a plate. E-F: The number of spores produced by each species, alone and mixed after being standardized for the number of
cells of each species added to a plate.

111 fruiting bodies per 2 × 107 cells, (W14,15 = 10, n = 27,
p < 0.001).
The number of fruiting bodies with D. discoideum morphology significantly increased to 486 ± 61 when plated
with D. purpureum when compared to the number of fruiting bodies produced when alone (W14,13 = 35, n = 27, p <
0.01, Figure 2C). Conversely, the number of fruiting bodies with D. purpureum morphology decreased significantly
to 394 ± 111 when plated with D. discoideum (W13,13 =
135, n = 26, p < 0.01, Figure 2D).
Spore production by D. discoideum and D. purpureum
from cells
We determined the number of spores produced by each
species after equal numbers of cells of each species were

mixed together without food to determine if one species
gained an advantage over the other. We corrected for germination efficiency and initial cell number when we compared control plates to experimental plates. D. discoideum
produced the same number of spores from a given
number of cells whether or not cells of D. purpureum were
also present. (DD_sporesexp = 2.06e7 ± 8.33e6,
DD_sporesctrl = 2.75e7 ± 1.29e7, W9,9 = 29, n = 18, p =
0.331, Figure 2E). However, D. purpureum produced fewer
spores when cells of D. discoideum were present compared
to when D. purpureum cells were alone (DP_sporesexp =
9.75e6 ± 2.25e6, DP_sporesctrl = 5.81e7 ± 1.26e7, W10,10 =
81.5, n = 20, p = < 0.05, Figure 2F). We also calculated the
number of spores produced per fruiting body for both D.
discoideum and D. purpureum when alone and when mixed
with each other as a measure of fruiting body size. Both D.

discoideum and D. purpureum produced fewer spores per
fruiting body in mixes when compared to the number
produced when alone but neither was significant (DDexp =
4.16e4 ± 1.54e4, DDctrl = 6.15e4 ± 1.55e4, W9,9 = 60, n = 18,
p = 0.094, DPexp = 3.65e4 ± 6.74e3, DPctrl = 4.96e4 ± 6.74e3,
W10,10 = 53, n = 20, p = 0.853).
Relatedness
We defined relatedness (r) as the probability that two
spores in the same fruiting body were from the same species. Relatedness was calculated in the experimental fruiting bodies using p2 + (1-p)2 where p was the proportion of
D. purpureum spores in a fruiting body. This measures the
degree to which clones experience their own type in the
fruiting body, above the population expectation of near
zero. Fruiting bodies with the D. purpureum phenotype
had an average relatedness of r = 0.943 ± 0.014, which was
not significantly higher than the relatedness of those fruiting bodies with a D. discoideum phenotype, r = 0.89 ±
0.022 (W14,13 = 60.5, n = 27, p = 0.140).
Time-lapse microscopy
We used time-lapse microscopy to determine when the
cells of D. discoideum and D. purpureum aggregate together
and when they begin to sort. We observed the different
stages of development in one pair, (Experiment #4: QS71
and QSPu16) by labeling QS71 with CellTracker™ Green
CMFDA. We found that the cells aggregate through the
mound stage, the point in the life cycle after aggregation
when the cells are found in small mounds before they differentiate into slugs, and then a primarily D. purpureum
slug migrates away, leaving behind a mound composed

mostly of D. discoideum cells that eventually become a
fruiting body (Figure 3).

Discussion
More than one-third of the fruiting bodies we examined
were chimeric and 95% of the experiments contained at
least one chimeric fruiting body. This shows that, at least
in a lab setting, D. discoideum and D. purpureum cells can
interact, aggregate, and form chimeric fruiting bodies,
although the average percentage of one clone in any given
fruiting body is 90%, which indicates that the two species
prefer to segregate but do so imperfectly. Both species had
an equivalent proportion of the other species in the chimeric fruiting bodies, but because chimeras were more
frequent in D. discoideum, there were more foreign spores
found in fruiting bodies with the D. discoideum morphology. We measured relatedness to determine how much
mixing and sorting is happening between the two species.
The higher the relatedness, the less intermixing is occurring between the two species. An r-value of 0.5 means that
the cells are randomly mixing, while an r-value of 1 means
that the cells are completely sorting. Despite the presence
of chimeric fruiting bodies, relatedness remained high
within fruiting bodies of each phenotype (0.89 for D. discoideum, 0.94 for D. purpureum) on plates that began with
an equal number of cells of each species.
It is remarkable, for several reasons, that we found such a
high incidence of chimerism First, D. discoideum and D.
purpureum are not particularly closely related. In the current phylogeny [14], the node separating the two species
has 4 other species in the branch including D. discoideum
and 17 others in the branch including D. purpureum. This

Slugs of D. discoideum and D. purpureum show partial sorting due to development difference. Although cells of
both species aggregate together (A), the majority of cells of D. purpureum forms a slug first and migrates away, taking some D.
discoideum cells (indicated by the green) with it (B). The majority of the cells of D. discoideum stays in the mound to later form
a slug and migrate (C).

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:293

phylogenetic distance is manifest in several developmental differences between the two species that may impact
the level of sorting. D. purpureum forms a stalk as the slug
migrates, while D. discoideum forms its stalk after the slug
finishes migrating [13]. Additionally, D. purpureum develops faster than D. discoideum. As a result, cells of D. purpureum may differentiate first leading to an increase in
sorting if the genes responsible for cell-type partitioning
and development up-regulate at different times. We found
evidence of this pattern when we used time-lapse microscopy. Cells of both species aggregate together for a short
time, but then D. purpureum slugs break off and migrate
away from the initial mound, leaving mostly D. discoideum cells. A short time later, D. discoideum slugs begin to
migrate and then form fruiting bodies. Interestingly, slugs
contained cells from both species, indicating only partial
disassociation.
Our chimerism result is also surprising because prior
research failed to show chimerism, despite having mixed
different species in a variety of ways. Raper and Thom [22]
first mixed spores of D. discoideum and D. purpureum and
reported the absence of intermediate phenotypes, which
was in accordance with our results, but does not preclude
chimerism. They then mixed D. discoideum spores with
spores of D. mucoroides, a species that is as equally distant
phylogentically as D. purpureum [14]. They used the bacterium S. marcescens as a food source. S. marcescens contains
a red pigment that D. discoideum is unable to digest, resulting in dyed cells [13,25] while D. mucoroides digests the
pigment and remains white. They found that the red cells
initially aggregated together with the white cells but separated into red and white fruiting bodies. This shows that
most cells segregated, but it is not clear if some individual
cells of the wrong type might have been present.
Raper and Thom [22] also tried making grafts between different portions of the slugs of D. discoideum and D. purpureum, but were unsuccessful in getting the segments to
permanently coalesce and form chimeric fruiting bodies.
Using these data, they concluded that Dictyostelium species
did not form chimeras. In one final experiment, they were
able to obtain fruiting bodies with intermediate phenotypes by allowing cells of each species to form slugs and
then crushing those slugs and mixing them [22]. These
fruiting bodies contained spores from both species. However, those fruiting bodies that retained the phenotype of
only one parent only produced fruiting bodies of that
same phenotype, seemingly indicating that those fruiting
bodies consisted of one species. Bonner and Adams [23]
also failed to find chimeras after they completed a series
of experiments where they attempted to make intermediate fruiting bodies by grafting different species together
during the aggregation stage. Neither group reported the
density of spores that they used.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/293

Perhaps we were able to find chimeras while the others
did not because we plated out individual spores from
fruiting bodies carefully at a very low density so we could
detect low levels of mixing. Overall, there was mostly sorting, but there was some mixing, which may have been
missed if not looked for carefully. We also used multiple
clones, and had we used only one pair, an unlucky choice
(for example mix 10 between clones QS75 and QSPu13 in
Figure 2A–B) could have led us to the false conclusion
that there was little mixing.
Finally, the finding of chimerism between species is surprising because both species apparently avoid chimerism
even with other clones of their own species. Gilbert et al.
[26] found that the relatedness for naturally occurring
fruiting bodies collected in the wild that contained multiple clones of D. discoideum was 0.68, which was much
lower than the overall relatedness of 0.98, because there
were many clonal fruiting bodies. This result could be due
either to sorting or to patchy distribution of clones. However, clear sorting was shown in fruiting bodies of D. purpureum when pairs of clones were mixed in 50:50 ratios;
the result was an overall relatedness of 0.81 [18]. Recently,
somewhat weaker sorting has also been demonstrated
between D. discoideum clones (Ostrowski et al. submitted). Our relatedness values for the two species mixed
50:50, were 0.89 for D. discoideum and 0.94 for D. purpureum. The higher values indicate greater clonal sorting
than within-species mixes.
Why do these two species cooperate at least some of the
time and is it true mutualism? Our system is unique and
interesting in that it defies previous explanations of mutualism. In most cooperative interactions involving different
species, each partner brings different goods or services to
the association, such as between the Senita cactus and
Senita moth, where the moth pollinates the cactus in
exchange for a place to oviposit eggs and the larvae to subsequently eat a portion of the seeds [4]. That is not the
case with these two Dictyostelids because both species
provide essentially the same services – migration and stalk
formation. Mutualisms are now being recognized as lying
on a continuum with parasitism. Some people also
hypothesize that mutualism evolved from parasitism and
that mutualism is best described as mutual exploitation
[27,28]. It may be that the two species are exploiting each
other differentially, with D. discoideum benefiting most in
the metric we measured. If this true, it may be that this
interaction lies on the boundary between the two and is
heading towards mutualism.
It is possible that the mixing is a mistake. Each species
may undergo its social lifecycle where certain cells altruistically form stalk cells as it would if in a clonal population.
Cells of different species may aggregate and develop

Page 6 of 10

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:293

together because of their close proximity to each other
and similar developmental characteristics. Another possibility is that although this interaction evolved to provide
beneficial cooperation within species (or even within
clones), different species are able to benefit from those
services, such as protection from predators, migration,
spore formation and dispersal when they would otherwise
not be able to because of a cell number deficiency. When
both species face the possibility of being unable to aggregate on their own because they lack sufficient cell number,
the two species will aggregate together and form fruiting
bodies, to their mutual benefit, instead of dying out.
Though we are unable to fully distinguish these hypotheses, we can provide an accounting of some of the costs and
benefits that result from interspecies chimerism.
In any cooperative relationship, there are costs associated
with each altruistic act. One such cost is that the altruistic
act is not reciprocated, which may lead to the exploitation
of one partner by the other. Cheating is the greatest concern when there is an interaction between two individuals
that are not genetically identical. Earlier research shows
that clones of D. discoideum may cheat each other, but
prior experiments involving only D. purpureum clones
show that the species maintains a high degree of kin discrimination by preferentially associating with kin without
displaying a consistent pattern of cheating [16,18]. The
stronger segregation seen in D. purpureum may have
evolved as a way to prevent cheating between clones, but
it also might mean that this species no longer has a need
to maintain mechanisms of cheating, or other defenses
against cheating. When the two species are mixed
together, D. discoideum's ability to cheat and D. purpureum's lack of a cheating mechanism may be the reason
D. purpureum was exploited.
It is possible that this association is kept stable and that
cheating is kept to a minimum because the aggregates
form only when necessary and that they are kept as pure
as possible, as indicated by the much higher relatedness
values we calculated when compared to those found in
previous studies. Additionally, both species suffered in the
production of spores per fruiting body, which may be why
the two species tend to segregate from each other despite
some of the benefits that may be gained from the interaction.

tors. By aggregating together, the amoebae can initiate
mechanisms to avoid soil predators such as nematodes.
Kessin et al. [29] showed that Caenorhabditis elegans feeds
on individual amoebae up through early aggregation.
However, in late aggregation the cells form a polysaccharide sheath that the nematodes are unable to penetrate.
This sheath protects the amoebae as they migrate as a multicellular slug. Once the fruiting body is formed, C. elegans
may ingest the spores, but they are unable to digest them.
Kessin et al. [29] found an additional benefit in D. purpureum: at high cell densities, it is able to repel nematodes.
Therefore, it may be beneficial to both species to aggregate
together when cell numbers are low, especially in the presence of predators.
Migration distance is another potential benefit of forming
a larger slug. Foster et al. [17] found that larger slugs of D.
discoideum traveled further than slugs containing half the
number of cells. Also, they found that larger chimeric
slugs traveled further than smaller clonal slugs. When
slugs are traveling to a new location because the current
one has run out of bacteria, larger slugs are more likely,
over both smaller slugs and solitary cells, to reach a new
patch of bacteria [30,31].
A final possible benefit to co-aggregation is for spore dispersal purposes. To successfully disperse spores, they must
be held aloft on a stalk of sufficient height. If there are too
few cells in the aggregate, a fruiting body may not form at
all. Or, even if a small fruiting body is able to form, it may
be at a disadvantage relative to larger fruiting bodies, making it less likely to disperse due to contact from passing
invertebrates.
Although we can only hypothesize about possible benefits
to both species from cooperating, a mutualism would not
evolve between these two species without gaining some
type of fitness benefit. In single species fruiting bodies,
some cells altruistically give up reproduction so that
equally related cells become reproductive spores. In our
experiments, cells still forfeit their reproductive ability so
that related cells benefit. However, cells of the other species also benefit through by-product altruism, as they too
are able to form reproductive spores because of the sacrifice of the other cells.

Conclusion
We did not observe a clear benefit to this interaction that
might explain why it has persisted. In terms of spore production, D. discoideum maintained the number of spores
it produces while D. purpureum decreased the number of
spores produced. However, additional possible benefits
result from larger slug sizes that are not measurable using
spore production, the metric we tested. One possible benefit for cells from both species is protection from preda-

The surprising finding that D. discoideum and D. purpureum can cooperate to form chimeric fruiting bodies
cannot be explained by increased spore production. It
may simply be a mistake or it may be making the best of
a bad job. Both species seem to favor being clonal, but a
fraction of cells cooperate with the other species, perhaps
when benefits are high enough to overcome the cost in
decreased spore production. Cooperating amoebae are

able to make larger fruiting bodies, which are advantageous for migration and dispersal, but these benefits will
need to be quantified to assess their importance.

Methods
Clones
We used fourteen genetically distinct wild clones of D. discoideum and thirteen clones of D. purpureum isolated from
different soil samples collected at the Houston Arboretum, Texas (Table 1).
Cell preparation
We plated out 3 × 105 spores from each clone with 300 μl
of the bacteria Klebsiella aerogenes (KA) as food on SM/5
agar plates [32]. After approximately 38 hours, we harvested the cells while they were in log growth before
multi-cellular development occurred with cold standard
KK2 buffer (3.8 mM K2HPO4, 16.5 mM KH2PO4). The
cells were then centrifuged three times at 1000 rpm for
three minutes to remove any remaining bacteria and set at
a concentration of 108 cells per milliliter in KK2 buffer.
Experiment set-up
For each of the 21 experiments, we tested one D. discoideum clone with one D. purpureum clone. We filled each
well of a 6-well tissue culture plates (3.5 cm in diameter)
with 7 ml of non-nutrient agar (14.9 g agar per liter KK2
buffer). We designated four of the wells, from here forward called plates, as control plates. We labeled the final
two plates as experimental plates. For the control plates,
we added 4 × 107 cells in 400 μl of KK2 buffer for each

clone. For the experimental plates, we added together 2 ×
107 cells of each clone in 200 μl of KK2 buffer. After thoroughly mixing the cells, we spread 400 μl of the cell suspension on a plate. Thus, we had a replicate of the control
and experimental plates. We used one set to assess mixing
and the other to assess spore production. We used both
sets to assess fruiting body production.
Data collection and analyses
Fruiting body assessment
In order to determine the number of fruiting bodies
present on all plates, we created a circular grid 3.5 cm in
diameter that exactly fit the bottom of the tissue culture
plates. Each square in the grid had an area of 0.25 cm2.
Before the start of the experiment we randomly selected
eight of the squares to be the counting squares so that the
same squares were used consistently for all 21 of the
experiments. In these squares, we counted all of the fruiting bodies, and in the case of the experimental plates,
whether they had a D. discoideum or D. purpureum phenotype using a set of established criteria such as sorus color,
presence of a basal disc, and stalk type (Figure 4). We
examined the remaining squares for the presence or
absence of fruiting bodies of each species. We then calculated the number of fruiting bodies by multiplying the
average number of fruiting bodies over the eight squares
by the area of the plate.
Spore production assessment
For one of each control and experiment plate, we collected
all of the fruiting bodies in 1 ml of KK2 buffer to count the
number of spores that were produced. We used a hemacytometer to count the spores. Additionally, we plated out a
dilute sample of the spores from the experiment on five
60 cm Petri plates containing SM/5 agar to determine the
proportion of spores produced for each species. By plating
a diluted concentration of the spores, we were able to
determine where on the plate cells were released from
individual spores and were then able to determine the
identity of the spore and calculate the proportion of
spores of each species. After adjusting for germination efficiency, we were able to determine the number of spores
produced by each species on the experimental plates by
multiplying the proportion of spores of each species previously calculated by the total number of spores that were
collected from the experimental plate.
Germination efficiency
For each clone, we plated out approximately 30 spores per
plate over six 60 cm Petri plates containing SM/5 agar with
300 ul of KA. After three days, we began scoring the plates
for germinated spores, indicated by clearings in the bacteria. We replicated this procedure twice to get an average
number of spores that germinate for each species. We also
plated out an equal known number of spores from both

except that we used 50 μM of CellTracker™ Green CMFDA.
We created the timelapse using a Nikon™ E1000 florescent
microscope and MetaMorph® imaging software.

When plated at low density, the average germination rate
for D. discoideum was 17.7% (SE = 0.022) while the average rate of germination for D. purpureum was 50.3% (SE =
0.033) (F1,58 = 59.41, n = 60, p < 0.001). We also tested the
germination efficiency of each species alone and when
plated with the other species to ensure that the spores of
one species were not inhibiting spores of the other. We
found that there was no difference in the germination efficiency for either D. discoideum (F1,16 = 0.31, n = 18, p =
0.585) or D. purpureum ((F1,15 = 0.31, n = 17, p = 0.361)
in mixes as compared to pure clones. Based on these
results, we adjusted spore numbers to reflect the greater
spore germination rate of D. purpureum.

Analyses
We ran Wilcoxin rank sum tests on all our data except the
germination efficiency results. The data were analyzed
after grouping by clone, although when the data were
grouped by experiment, the results were comparable. The
germination efficiency data was analyzed using ANOVAs.
We ran all analyses on our data using R [33]. All of the
data are reported as the mean ± standard error. The graphs
were created using Microsoft Excel version 11.3.5.

Chimera assessment
From the other set of experiment plates, we collected five
fruiting bodies that had a D. discoideum phenotype and
five fruiting bodies that had a D. purpureum phenotype.
We placed each fruiting body individually in 40 μl of KK2
buffer and plated out a dilute sample of the spores with on
SM/5 plates with KA. We tallied the number of spores of
each species that hatched from the fruiting bodies to
determine if the fruiting body was chimeric and what percentage of the spores in the fruiting body were of the other
species' phenotype after again adjusting for germination.
Timelapse Florescence Microscopy
We observed the different stages of development in one
pair, (Experiment #4: QS71 and QSPu16) by labeling
QS71 with CellTracker™ Green CMFDA. We followed the
manufacturer's recommended protocol to label the cells,
