Abstract
Background: The crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci (L.), has been blamed for coral
mortality in a large number of coral reef systems situated in the Indo-Pacific region. Because of its
high fecundity and the long duration of the pelagic larval stage, the mechanism of outbreaks may be
related to its meta-population dynamics, which should be examined by larval sampling and
population genetic analysis. However, A. planci larvae have undistinguished morphological features
compared with other asteroid larvae, hence it has been difficult to discriminate A. planci larvae in
plankton samples without species-specific markers. Also, no tools are available to reveal the
dispersal pathway of A. planci larvae. Therefore the development of highly polymorphic genetic
markers has the potential to overcome these difficulties. To obtain genomic information for these
purposes, the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome of A. planci and its
putative sibling species, A. brevispinus were determined and their characteristics discussed.
Results: The complete mtDNA of A. planci and A. brevispinus are 16,234 bp and 16,254 bp in size,
respectively. These values fall within the length variation range reported for other metazoan
mitochondrial genomes. They contain 13 proteins, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes and the putative
control region in the same order as the asteroid, Asterina pectinifera. The A + T contents of A. planci
and A. brevispinus on their L strands that encode the majority of protein-coding genes are 56.3%
and 56.4% respectively and are lower than that of A. pectinifera (61.2%). The percent similarity of
nucleotide sequences between A. planci and A. brevispinus is found to be highest in the CO2 and CO3
regions (both 90.6%) and lowest in ND2 gene (84.2%) among the 13 protein-coding genes. In the
deduced putative amino acid sequences, CO1 is highly conserved (99.2%), and ATP8 apparently
evolves faster any of the other protein-coding gene (85.2%).
Conclusion: The gene arrangement, base composition, codon usage and tRNA structure of A.
planci are similar to those of A. brevispinus. However, there are significant variations between A.
planci and A. brevispinus. Complete mtDNA sequences are useful for the study of phylogeny, larval
detection and population genetics.

Background
The crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci (L.), is a
typical reef coral predator, which sometimes causes population outbreaks and destroys coral reef communities. The
activities of this starfish have been responsible for causing
extensive coral mortality in a large number of coral reef
systems throughout the Indo-Pacific region [1]. Major
outbreaks involve large numbers of starfish and widespread coral destruction and consequently they can
change the fauna and topographic nature of coral reef
communities [1,2].
In Australia, Kenchington [3] hypothesized that outbreaks
(termed primary) started and in turn initiated a cascade of
additional outbreaks (termed secondary). Similarly, the
Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia and the Ryukyu
Islands in Japan have experienced two distinct series of
outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish [2]. Once the
unpredictable primary outbreak occurs, this large population of adult A. planci that reproduces enormous amounts
of eggs can lead to secondary outbreaks.
The high fecundity and long pelagic larval stage [4] of A.
planci imply that the dispersal and recruitment of larvae
play an important role in the occurrence of primary and
secondary outbreaks [5]. The lack of knowledge of its larval dispersal has limited the understanding of its population dynamics. Some hydrodynamic models have been
developed to describe larval dispersal around the GBR
[6,7]. These authors suggested that larval dispersal was not
random and provided probabilistic routes for dispersal
through the GBR. They also claimed that some larvae
might be retained on the natal reef. Verifying the larval
dispersal route predicted by these hydrodynamic models
is essential. However, there are two difficulties in the
study of larval dispersal and recruitment of A. planci from
a biological perspective: 1) the morphological appearance
of A. planci larvae is so similar to those of other asteroid
species [4], hence, it is extremely difficult to differentiated
A. planci larvae from other asteroid larvae. Recent concern
about pelagic larvae dispersal emphasizes the need for
accurate larval identification. 2) There have been no useful tools to reveal the reef-connectivity among reefs and
autochthonous recruitment of A. planci larvae. Therefore,
the development of highly polymorphic genetic markers
such as mitochondrial sequences or nucleic microsatellites has been eagerly desired. To resolve the former problem, Evans [8] developed a Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR)-based identification tool for other asteroid species
larvae (excluding A. planci) and showed the PCR-RFLP
assay is a useful tool for larval identification of asteroid
larvae. The complete or partial mtDNA sequences of many
metazoans are now available [9]. Having a relatively rapid
evolutionary rate and lacking intermolecular genetic
recombination, these data on mtDNA sequences have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/17

been utilized to identify invertebrate larvae [10] or conduct the population genetic study at various taxonomic
levels [11]. The genetic information can be applied to
overcome both these difficulties in the study of larval dispersal of A. planci.
In this study, we determined the complete sequences of
the mitochondrial genome of A. planci and its sibling species, Acanthaster brevispinus and compared in detail the full
sequences of both species and a third asteroid species,
Asterina pectinifera. Also, we describe some characteristics
of both mitochondrial genomes of A. planci and A.
brevispinus.

Results and discussion
General Features
The complete mtDNA sequences of A. planci and A.
brevispinus are 16,234 bp and 16,254 bp in size, respectively; both fit within the length variation range reported
for other metazoan mitochondrial genomes [9]. They
were submitted to the DDBJ with Accession No.
AB231475 (A. planci) and AB231476 (A. brevispinus). They
contain 13 proteins, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes [see additional file 1] in the same order as another asteroid species,
Asterina pectinifera [12] [NCBI: NC-001627]. Both in A.
planci and A. brevispinus, the L strand encodes most of the
proteins including 10 proteins, 11 tRNA and 12S rRNA
genes, whereas the H strand includes the remaining three
proteins (ND1, ND2, and ND6), 11 tRNA and 16S rRNA
genes [12].
Base composition and codon usage
Animal mitochondrial genomes sometimes deviate from
a random nucleotide usage, which may be due to the
directional mutation pressure and the non-asymmetrical
base composition of both the strands [13]. The A + T contents of A. planci and A. brevispinus on the L strand are
56.3% and 56.4%, respectively, and both are lower than
that of A. pectinifera (61.2%). This result comes from the
fact that the third codon position of the protein-coding
gene in A. pectinifera prefers T more than those of A. planci
and A. brevispinus, particularly in the synonymous codons
of Phe (UUU), Leu (CUU), Ile (AUU), Ser (UCU) and Asn
(AAU) [see additional file 2]. The mtDNA sequences of A.
planci and A. brevispinus have A-bias on the first and second codon positions of protein-coding gene and rRNA
genes. There is no significant difference in the base composition of tRNA genes between the Acanthaster species
and A. pectinifera [see additional file 3].

Asakawa et al. [13] demonstrated the bias of a strand-specific nucleotide composition in the mtDNA of A. pectinifera that the L strand prefers to use A or C while the H
strand prefers to use G or T in the third codons. This asymmetric distribution of G and C between the two comple-

mentary DNA strands can be easily measured with the
following formulae [14]; GC-skew = (G-C)/(G+C); ATskew = (A-T)/(A+T) where C, G, A and T are the occurrences of the four bases. The skew is likely to be most pronounced at the third codon positions of each strand,
where any mutational change is synonymous and not
subject to selection pressure [15]. Thus we calculated the
GC-skew and AT-Skew using the third codon positions of
each strand. The L strand prefers to use A or C and H
strand prefers to use G or T in both Acanthaster species,
clearly showing strand-specific bias of the nucleotide
compositions. The three asteroid species show almost the
same tendency of skew, the skew in other five echinoderms (Cucumaria miniata (holothuroid), Arbacia lixula
(echinoid), Ophiopholis aculeata (ophiuroid) and Ophiura
lutkeni (ophiuroid)) showed similar bias of skew,
although the degree of skew is slightly different among
species examined except for Florometra serratissima (crinoid) (data not shown). In F. serratissima mtDNA, the L
strand prefers to use G or T and the H strand prefers to use
A or C. The pattern of the bias of the skew is likely to be
conserved in asteroid species, although the strand-specific
bias is not a general rule in echinoderms [16].
The strand specific bias of the A + C content of proteincoding genes is also seen. In short, the A + C content of the
H strands in A. planci and A. brevispinus are 31.4% and
30.9 %, respectively, whereas those in the L strands are
57.3% and 57.6 %, respectively. These values are similar
to those of A. pectinifera (34.1% for the L strand and 56.5
% for the H strand).
Nucleotide and amino acid differences in protein genes
As previously mentioned, the identified protein-coding
genes of the A. planci and A. brevispinus mtDNA are similar
with those of A. pectinifera [12] and of other metazoan
mtDNA genomes [9]. Most of the protein-coding genes in
these species are identified by sequence comparison with
A. pectinifera except for ND5 and ND3 genes. Alignment is
difficult to perform because size variations occur near
their 5' ends. The 5' ends of ND3 and ND5 genes in these
two species are inferred from the eligible termination
codons without overlapping the preceding gene. In the
sequence comparison between A. pectinifera and A. planci/
brevispinus, significant changes in the number of codons
are observed in ND3 and ND5 genes between the Acanthaster species and Asterina. The nucleotide sequence of
ND3 gene in A. pectinifera is 18 bp shorter than those of
both Acanthaster counterparts. On the other hand, both
Acanthaster ND5 gene nucleotide sequences are 10 bp
shorter than that of A. pectinifera. In both of these cases,
most of the deletions are observed near 3' end of each
gene.

For the given genes, nucleotide and amino acid differences are compared in the protein-coding genes [see additional file 4]. The percent similarity of nucleotide
sequences between A. planci and A. brevispinus is found to
be highest in the CO2 and CO3 regions (both 90.6%) and
lowest in ND2 gene (84.2%) among the 13 protein-coding genes. In the amino acid sequences, CO1 gene is
highly conserved (99.2%), and it seems that ATP8 has
evolved faster than any of the other protein-coding genes
(85.2%). Amino acid sequences are generally more conserved than nucleotide sequences because of the functional constraints. Therefore, most of the identity values
of amino acid sequences are higher than those of nucleotide sequences or almost the same except for ATP8 gene.
The percentage similarity of amino acid sequences in
ATP8 gene is significantly lower than those of nucleotide
sequences between Acanthaster species and A. pectinifera
and also slightly lower even between Acanthaster species.
The pairwise comparison of the ATP8 gene among A.
planci, A. brevispinus and A. pectinifera has revealed that the
nucleotide substitution rates of nonsynonymous sites
(first + second codon positions) are almost the same as
those of synonymous sites (third position) (data not
shown), suggesting the cause of this improbable phenomenon. A similar result in ATP genes was reported in sea
urchins [17] and they showed that the nucleotide substitution rates of nonsynonymous sites are not significantly
lower than that of synonymous sites. These data clearly
indicate a relaxation of the functional constraints at the
amino acid level. They found that the same sequence
motif (V/M)PQL(X4)(W/F) is evolutionarily conserved
from yeast to mammals at the N-termini of the proteins.
When the deduced amino acid sequences were analysed
with a computer aided method, the predicted hydrophatic
profiles for the corresponding proteins are completely
super-imposable. De Giorgi et al. [17] stated that in spite
of the divergence observed in the primary structure of the
genes, the role played may be the same. On the other
hand, the loss of ATP8 has occurred several times in the
evolutional process of metazoans [18]. As De Giorgi et al.
[17] suggested, the C-terminal of ATP8 might evolve
extremely rapidly and in a phylum-specific manner.
The ATP8 and ATP6 genes of starfish overlap each other by
16 nucleotides with a -1 frame shift. A similar overlap is
found among metazoan mitochondria, although the
extent of overlap varies [19]. Thus, it is easily expected that
the functional constraints of ATP8 gene are not so large
and the gene could evolve faster than other protein-coding genes. However, further work is required to clarify the
causal relationship in the lower percent similarity of
amino acid sequence with that of nucleotide sequence in
the Acanthaster species and the evolution of ATP8 genes in
asteroid species.

Gene initiation and termination
In the case of A. planci, 10 of the 13 protein-coding genes
use ATG as an initiation codon. Merely ND3 and ND4L
genes use ATT whereas ND1 gene uses GTG. All initiation
codons of A. brevispinus are the same as those of A. planci.
The initiation codon ATG of ND5 gene in the Acanthaster
species mtDNA changes to GTG in Asterina pectinifera.
Most of the A. planci and A. brevispinus mtDNA genes terminate with a TAA codon, however ND1, ND2 and ND6
genes terminate with ATG. ND4 gene of A. brevispinus terminates with ATG, however, those of A. planci and A. pectinifera terminate with TAA. There is only one T residue
between CO2 or Cytb genes and their downstream tRNA
genes in the Acanthaster species and A. pectinifera mtDNA
genomes. Furthermore, CO1 gene in the Acanthaster species terminates only with TA residue, whereas the A. pectinifera counterpart has a triplet codon (TAA), although
CO1 gene is the most conserved gene among the proteincoding genes [see additional file 4]. Mitochondrial genes
commonly employ several alternatives to ATG as an initiation codon and to TAA or TAG as a termination codon
[13,20]. However, the mechanism by which these variations occur is not yet well understood [21]. As demonstrated in the human mtDNA genome [20], we speculate
that incomplete termination codons such as T and TA are
converted to canonical termination codon TAA after the
cleavage of the tRNA gene by ribonuclease.
tRNA and rRNA genes
Twenty-two tRNA genes are identified in A. planci and A.
brevispinus mtDNA genomes by sequence comparison
with known echinoderm tRNA genes and the deduced
potential cloverleaf structures are shown in Figure 1.

The tRNA genes ranged in size from 67 (tRNACys) to 74
(tRNAThr) and they are large enough for encoded tRNAs to
fold into cloverleaf structures. As often found in other
metazoan mtDNA genomes, tRNASer (GCU) lacks the
DHU loop. The potential secondary structures of tRNAs
are quite similar between A. planci and A. brevispinus,
whereas the comparison between the Acanthaster species
and A. pectinifera reveals that several size variations have
occurred at the DHU and TÏC loops. The comparison
between the DHU and TÏX loops shows that size variations are more likely to be found in the DHU loop than
the TÏX loop.
The echinoderm mitochondrial rRNA genes are located
separately from each other [22], and this arrangement
appears also in A. planci and A. brevispinus mtDNA
genomes. The 5' and 3' end of 12S rRNA genes are defined
as immediately adjacent to the ends of the flanking genes
tRNAPhe and tRNAGlu, in the two Acanthaster mtDNA
genomes. However, an alignment of A. pectinifera does
not support their 3' end boundaries; the 12S rRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/17

sequences deduced from the sequence comparison with
A. pectinifera overlapped with the beginning of tRNAGlu by
two nucleotides.
Although the precise ends of the 16S rRNA transcripts cannot be determined without experimentation, the inferred
boundaries were determined by sequence comparison
with Pisaster ochraceus [22] [NCBI: NC-004610]. In contrast to a rather uniform distribution of nucleotide differences over the entire protein-coding genes, although the
substitution was mainly seen in the third positions,
replacement differences of rRNA genes are dispersed in
clusters. This variability is due to the secondary structures
of rRNA genes; the stem regions are relatively conservative, whereas the loop sequences are more variable as is
the case of tRNAs. Comparing with 12S rRNA genes, 16S
rRNA genes of asteroid species seem to have more variable
sites. This variability may be due to the potential loop
structures that have evolved much faster than other
regions in rRNAs.
Unassigned Sequence
Intergenetic regions represent 4.6% of A. planci mtDNA
genome and 4.7% of A. brevispinus mtDNA genome. The
largest unassigned regions (the putative control region)
are adjacent to 16S rRNA and tRNAThr. The inferred
boundaries determined by sequence comparison with P.
ochraceus suggest that this region of A. planci spanned 532
bp and that of A. brevispinus spanned 552 bp. This region
contains a stem-loop structure, which is the putative origin of light-strand replication. This structure is observed
close to tRNAThr, and the lengths are 29 bp for A. planci
and 34 bp for A. brevispinus. There is a 12 bp stem (TAACCCCCCCCC) and a 5 bp loop (CCTCC) in A. planci, and
a 12 bp stem (ATTACCCCCCCC) and a slightly longer 10
bp loop (CCCCCCCTCC) in A. brevispinus. The second
largest unassigned region in length is 51 bp in A. planci
and 58 bp in A. brevispinus and it is located between the
ND5 and ND6 genes. There are neither stem and loop
structures nor promoter-like sequences in these short
sequences. However, these sequences are as variable as the
largest unassigned sequences. In A. pectinifera mtDNA
genome, the second largest region is found between ND4
and tRNAHis, which extends to 140 bp long, whereas in the
two Acanthaster species it is only 8 bp long.

Aside from the large two regions, there are 4
TATATATATAA-like sequences found between the following genes in both Acanthaster species: tRNALeu and tRNAGly,
tRNAPro and CO1, CO3 and tRNAPro, ND6 and Cytb. Except
for the region between the genes for tRNALeu and tRNAGly,
all other TATATATATAA-like sequences are located in the
boundaries where the coding strand shifts to the complimentary one. As already pointed out by Asakawa et al.
[13], these sequences are the possible bi-directional pro-

moters, which play the role for replication and/or transcription. However, the sequence located between 16S
rRNA and ND2 that were reported in A. pectinifera and sea
urchin species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [23] and Paracentrotus lividus [24] are not found in the two Acanthaster
species.
Phylogenetic relationship
The complete CO1 sequences of A. planci and A.
brevispinus were subjected to the ML, MP and NJ analyses
together with the representative asteroid sequences [see
additional file 5] available in GenBank (Figure 2). These
three analyses produced almost the same tree topologies.
The CO1 phylogeny indicated that Pisaster ochraceus (Forcipulatida, Asteriidae) was the most primitive taxon
among asteroids. In these trees, the close affinities of species belonging to the same family (except for Asterinidae),
showing monophyly, were well supported. In contrast,
the confidence values for the branches linking different
families were not so higher. The close affinity between
Patiriella and Asterina species was found and the Asterinidae mixed together in the same group, suggesting a nonmonophyletic relationship. Acanthaster species were positioned closer to Oreaster species than any other members
in Valvatida, suggesting the close genetic affiliation,
although the bootstrap values were not so high and these
were separated from Patiriella and Asterina species by relatively high bootstrap supports in the ML method. A. planci
and A. brevispinus were the closest species showing 89.2%
homology between the two sequences, but these were
consistently separated by 100% bootstrap supports in the
tree. Luidia quinalia and Astropecten polyacanthus were
grouped together and separated from Acanthaster,
Oreaster, Patiriella and Asterina species. In the asteroid
phylogeny using mitochondrial 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA
also, the monophyly of each family was well supported
[25,26] but the monophyly of Asterinidae was not clearly
indicated from their ML and MP analyses as well as our
data. In this study, P. ochraceus (Forcipulatida, Asteriidae)
was the most primitive taxon among the asteroids. On the
other hand, the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA
phylogenetic trees [26] do not support the early divergence of Asteriidae such as Asterias amurensis and Coscinasterias acutispina. Our data suggested the close affinity
between Luidia and Astropecten species (both are Paxillosida), however, [26] reported a contradictory result that
Astropecten species were not positioned close to Luidia species but grouped Leiaster leachii and Certonardoa semiregularis (Valvatida). The reason, why the different topology
between CO1 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA
sequences was obtained, is unclear. The phylogenetic relationships among asteroids remain extremely controversial
in spite of many morphological and molecular studies
that have been applied to this issue [26].

Applications of mtDNA sequence of A. planci
A. brevispinus is a very rare species and was once considered as only as a short-spined individual of A. planci [27].
However, Birkeland & Lucas [1] and Lucas & Johns [28]
reported that A. planci and A. brevispinus are genetically
compatible to the extent that fertile F1 hybrids were produced. However, F2 hybrids and backcrosses were of poor
viability and some of them showed morphological abnormalities, suggesting that there are barriers to introgression
of genetic material between the species.

Protein and DNA technologies have provided strategies
for identification when morphological features are of limited value [29,30]. A method to identify A. planci larvae
using monoclonal antibodies provided by Hanna et al.
(see Birkeland & Lucas 1990[1]) is not perfect because the
monoclonal antibodies do not ensure discrimination
among coral reef asteroids other than Culsita novaeguineae.
As mentioned in the background of this study, a speciesspecific genetic marker of A. planci is essential to reveal the
larval ecology in the field study. Recent investigations
have suggested the feasibility of creating identification
systems reliant on the analysis of sequence in small segments of DNA [31]. Hebert et al. [32] focused this discussion by proposing that a DNA barcoding system for
animal life could be based upon sequence diversity in
cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1). They summarized
CO1 sequence divergences for 13,320 congeneric pairs of
animal species belonging to 11 phyla. Most pairs (79%)
showed greater than 8% sequence divergence and more
than 98% of species pairs showed greater than 2%
sequence divergence in their study (10.9 Â± 4.9% (mean Â±
s.d.%, n = 86) in Echinodamata). Therefore, most congeneric species pairs of animals showed enough sequence
divergence to ensure their easy diagnosis, because
intraspecific divergences are rarely greater than 2% and
most are less than 1% [33]. In the comparison of a complete CO1 sequence of A. planci with the genetically closest species A. brevispinus, the sequence convergence was
10.8%. The phylogenetic tree inferred from the complete
CO1 sequences also clearly showed the high divergence
among asteroid species. In addition, no sequence variation of the partial CO1 gene (from 4691 bp to 5401 bp)
was confirmed among the 3 A. planci specimens collected
from different localities (data not shown). Accordingly
these results indicate that the identification system for
asteroid species based on the CO1 gene will be highly
effective and it will easily provide the effective regions for
species-specific markers. Moreover, universal primers for
metazoan invertebrates in the CO1 genes were already
provided [34], therefore, PCR-RFLP (Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism) assay can also be applied as
another tool for species identification of A. planci.

For polymorphic marker using mtDNA variation, the
desirable characteristics are as follows: evolutional rate is
rapid enough to distinguish among local populations and
substitutions are neutral. In A. planci mtDNA sequence,
the largest unassigned region between tRNAThe and 16S
rRNA is most variable. In this region, size variations ranging from 538 to 546 bp are observed in the 23 individuals.
The variation includes 62 base substitutions and 5 deletions/insertions ranging from 1 to 5 bp (data not shown).
These sequences can be useful in the analysis of intraspecific variation of A. planci collected from several localities.

Conclusion
The complete mitochondrial genome sequences of Acanthaster planci and its sibling, rare species, A. brevispinus
were determined and compared with another known
asteroid species, Asterina pectinifera. The genome contains
37 genes most commonly found in metazoan mtDNA
and they are in the same order as in A. pectinifera. Characteristics of the two Acanthaster species are quite similar
when compared with A. pectinifera, though there exist
some significant differences between them especially in
the unassigned regions. The sequence information will be
useful for molecular ecological studies of A. planci in
future.

Methods
Animal samples and DNA Extraction
A specimen of Acanthaster planci for complete mtDNA
sequencing was collected at Akajima Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan in August 2003 by snorkeling. A specimen
of A. brevispinus was collected at an offshore site at Kushimoto, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan in October 2003.
Twenty-three specimens of A. planci to observe the variability of the largest unassigned sequence were collected
from Ishigaki Island (n = 4), Tokashiki Island (n = 10) in
Okinawa Prefecture and Kinko Bay (n = 9) in Kagoshima
Prefecture, Japan. The total genomic DNA of Acanthaster
species was extracted from the tube feet using a DNeasy kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer's procedure.
Long PCR and DNA sequencing
Oligonucleotide primers were designed in accordance
with sequences reported in Asterina pectinifera [12] and
other species in order to amplify the intervening regions.
Sequences were completely determined from the ends of
these PCR fragments, then internally by primer walking.

Three partial sequences of A. planci and A. brevispinus
mtDNA were obtained. They were amplified to a total volume of 100 Âµl containing 5 U of LaTaq (TaKaRa), 50 Âµl of
2 Ã GC buffer I, 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 16 Âµl of dNTPs mixture
(2.5 mM each), 0.5 ÂµM of each oligonucleotide primers,
and 10 to 50 ng of the genomic DNA. The mixture was
subjected to 40 cycles of amplification in a thermal cycler

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/17

(PC-800, ASTEC). The oligonucleotide primers of A.
planci and A. brevispinus are summarized in Table 6 [see
additional file 6]. The first cycle was preceded by initial
denaturation for 1 min at 94Â°C. Each cycle consisted of
denaturation for 30 sec at 94Â°C, annealing for 30 sec at
50â55Â°C, and extension for 7 min. The last cycle was followed by a final extension step for 10 min at 72Â°C.
All PCR products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels
and stained with ethidium bromide. The agarose gel slices
containing the PCR-product band were excised under UV,
and DNA was purified from the agarose plug by using
GenEluteTM Agarose Spin Columns (SIGMA), followed
by an ethanol precipitation. Amplified products were
either sequenced directly or cloned into pGEM-TÂ® easy
vector in the pGEM-TÂ® easy system (Promega) and
TopoXLÂ® vector using the TopoXL (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were extracted by the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen).
All DNA sequence data were determined using ABI PRISM
3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) DYEnamic
ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and DYEnamic Terminator Dilution Buffer (Amersham Bioscience).
Phylogeny
Complete CO1 sequences, excluding primer regions, of A.
planci and A. brevispinus were aligned with 18 other asteroid sequences obtained from GenBank using the ClustalX
package [35] and edited manually. Cucumaria miniata
(Cucumariidae) and Paracentrotus lividus (Echinidae) were
used as the out-groups [see additional file 5]. A total of
1551 bp sequence were analyzed using maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP) and neighbourjoining (NJ) methods in PAUP* 4.0b10 [36]. In order to
find the best model for the CO1 sequences we applied
Modeltest (version 3.07) [37]. The best-fit model was TrN
+ I + G [38] with assumed proportion of invariable site =
0.5180, gamma distribution shape parameter = 0.6099
and base substitution categories (AC = 1.0000, AG =
10.3590, AT = 1.0000, CG = 1.0000, CT = 8.7274, GT =
1.0000). Base frequencies were set at A = 0.3725, C =
0.2639, G = 0.0884 and T = 0.2753. ML analyses were performed with the heuristic search option starting with NJ
and TBR branch swapping. One hundred replicates were
performed in ML bootstrap analysis. In MP 100 random
additions were done using the heuristic search option and
TBR branch swapping. Characters were unordered and
weighted equally. Bootstrap analyses with 1000 replicates
were conducted. The best-fit model suggested by Modeltest (see above) was also used to compute dissimilarity
values. The distance matrix obtained was used to build a
tree with NJ. One thousand replicates were performed in
NJ bootstrap analysis.
