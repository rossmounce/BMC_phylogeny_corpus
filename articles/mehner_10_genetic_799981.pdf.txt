allopatric populations of Baltic ciscoes (Coregonus
albula complex, Teleostei, Coregonidae)

Abstract
Background: Teleost fishes of the Coregonidae are good model systems for studying postglacial evolution,
adaptive radiation and ecological speciation. Of particular interest is whether the repeated occurrence of sympatric
species pairs results from in-situ divergence from a single lineage or from multiple invasions of one or more
different lineages. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Baltic ciscoes (Coregonus albula complex), examining
271 individuals from 8 lakes in northern Germany using 1244 polymorphic AFLP loci. Six lakes had only one
population of C. albula while the remaining two lakes had C. albula as well as a sympatric species (C. lucinensis or
C. fontanae).
Results: AFLP demonstrated a significant population structure (Bayesian θB = 0.22). Lower differentiation between
allopatric (θB = 0.028) than sympatric (0.063-0.083) populations contradicts the hypothesis of a sympatric origin of
taxa, and there was little evidence for stocking or ongoing hybridization. Genome scans found only three loci that
appeared to be under selection in both sympatric population pairs, suggesting a low probability of similar
mechanisms of ecological segregation. However, removal of all non-neutral loci decreased the genetic distance
between sympatric pairs, suggesting recent adaptive divergence at a few loci. Sympatric pairs in the two lakes
were genetically distinct from the six other C. albula populations, suggesting introgression from another lineage
may have influenced these two lakes. This was supported by an analysis of isolation-by-distance, where the driftgene flow equilibrium observed among allopatric populations was disrupted when the sympatric pairs were
included.
Conclusions: While the population genetic data alone can not unambiguously uncover the mode of speciation,
our data indicate that multiple lineages may be responsible for the complex patterns typically observed in
Coregonus. Relative differences within and among lakes raises the possibility that multiple lineages may be present
in northern Germany, thus understanding the postglacial evolution and speciation in the C. albula complex
requires a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of several potential founder lineages.

Background
Fish in temperate lakes that have been formed since the
last glaciation (12,000 - 15,000 yrs) provide good model
systems for studying adaptive radiation and ecological
speciation [1,2]. According to the ecological theory of
adaptive radiation, environmental gradients and intense
competition for scarce resources lead to divergent natural selection that, in turn, produces phenotypic differentiation [3]. Reproductive isolation is thought to evolve

as a by-product of divergent natural selection because
traits responsible for reproductive isolation are usually
adaptive [4]. Sympatric populations of North temperate
freshwater fish with significant genetic differentiation
and strong ecological divergence are well known in
sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) [5], rainbow
smelt (Osmerus mordax (Mitchill)) [6], Arctic char
(Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) [7] or sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum)) [8]. But no group of fishes is
as well known for adaptive radiations and complex speciation patterns in postglacial lakes as coregonid fishes
(Teleostei: Coregonidae) [9].

A recent review [9] identified six potential modes of
speciation in Coregonus: sympatric speciation from a
single founder lineage, repeated invasions from a single
lineage, hybrid swarm radiation, and three variants of
allopatric speciation; complete or following secondary
contact with either subsequent genomic reinforcement
or with subsequent ecological reinforcement, depending
on the levels of reproductive isolation between the taxa
[9]. In order to distinguish from among these potential
modes of speciation, population genetic information is
required in addition to phylogenetic, biogeographical,
morphological and ecological data. Specifically, lower
genetic differentiation between sympatric than between
allopatric populations provides evidence for hybrid
swarm and sympatric speciation scenarios. Conversely,
more pronounced reproductive isolation between sympatric populations than between allopatric populations
provides evidence for allopatric speciation with reinforcement [9].
Ecological diversification leading to speciation has
been repeatedly suggested in Coregonus [reviewed by
[9]]; however, recent reviews [10,11] have challenged the
assumption that all cases of ecological segregation
between sympatric populations provide valid evidence
for ecological speciation. Nevertheless, particularly
strong support for sympatric ecological speciation can
be obtained from cases of parallel ecological divergence
and genetic differentiation in similar systems [12,13].
Further evidence for ecological speciation can be gained
from genome scans that detect the same loci under
selection in different systems with similar environments
[14-16]. In a geographical context, the genetic distances
among populations of the founder lineage of sympatric
species should fit to an isolation-by-distance (IBD)
model [17], whereas adaptive divergence between the
sympatric populations may disrupt the IBD patterns
[18]. Subsequently, sympatric populations would be
genetically different but with a geographical distance of
zero, thereby reducing our ability to detect significant
IBD.
Within the Coregonidae, the postglacial evolution of
whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis (Mitchill) and C.
lavaretus (L.) complexes) and the North America ciscoes (C. artedi Lesueur complex) are comparatively well
studied [4,19-23]. Several speciation modes have been
suggested for these groups, but evidence for parallel
sympatric speciation from a single founder lineage is
weak in any of the systems [9]. An alternative system to
study putative parallel ecological speciation can be
found within populations of the Baltic ciscoes (C. albula
(L.) complex), a group that is widespread in northern
Europe [24]. Sympatric populations of the C. albula
complex occur in Scandinavia and Russia [25,26] and
have been reported from two deep, stratified clear-water

lakes [27] situated geographically close to one another
in northern Germany (Fig. 1). In Lake Stechlin (Fig. 1),
the autumn-spawning C. albula coexists with the smaller, spring-spawning C. fontanae [28]. Both species are
pelagic zooplanktivores [29,30], but differ substantially
with respect to temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations [31,32]. Analysis of six microsatellite loci
revealed very low levels of genetic differentiation
between the sympatric populations in Lake Stechlin
[33]. In the nearby Lake Breiter Luzin (Fig. 1), two
populations also coexist (C. albula and spring-spawning
C. lucinensis) [34], between which the microsatellite differentiation was also very low [33]. While these results
suggest a sympatric origin of each spring spawner,
shared mtDNA haplotypes revealed lower genetic relatedness between sympatric taxa [33]. An important
advance to our understanding of the origin of the sympatric pairs could come from a genetic comparison with
other allopatric populations from the same geographical
area. Furthermore, the few neutral microsatellite markers employed did not allow for the study of potentially
parallel adaptive divergence in both lakes. Accordingly,
the specific speciation mode of the sympatric populations has yet to be unambiguously determined.
Here, we studied genetic differentiation within the C.
albula complex from eight lakes using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Six lakes had single,
autumn-spawning C. albula populations, whereas two
lakes contained C. albula together with a sympatric species (spring-spawning C. fontanae in Lake Stechlin and
C. lucinensis in Lake Breiter Luzin) (Fig. 1). We first
examined the overall genetic structure of the 10 Coregonus populations, with particular emphasis on comparing
differentiation between allopatric and sympatric populations. Under the scenario of sympatric speciation, we
expected to find greater genetic similarity between the
sympatric populations within lakes than among lakes
[33]. Species that have evolved recently may not have
developed full genetic incompatibilities and thus may
hybridize with little intrinsic fitness loss, therefore we
also tested whether ongoing hybridization between sympatric populations may blur historical differentiation
[35]. Second, we fit genetic distances to a stepwise IBD
model and hypothesized a disruption of IBD if sympatric
populations are included [18]. Third, we calculated the
probability of hybridization between sympatric populations and fish from putative stocking source populations.
Enhancement stocking in the commercially important
Coregonus lake populations is a common management
practice [36-38], and our earlier work has quantified
how this can modify the genetic identity of the target
populations and disrupt IBD [39]. We hypothesized that
hybridization with C. albula stocked from allopatric
autumn-spawning populations would be more likely for

the autumn-spawning C. albula from both lakes than
for the sympatric spring-spawning C. fontanae or
C. lucinensis. Finally, we tested for the presence of outlier loci that were shared in both sympatric pairs to find
genetic evidence for parallel adaptive divergence [15,16].

Results
All Coregonus populations and all AFLP loci

Using a multiplex AFLP method (see Methods) we
scored 1264 loci from 271 individuals, of which 1244
(98.4%) were polymorphic over the 10 populations. Differentiation (θ) between the repeated samplings of populations in Lake Stechlin were not significantly different
from zero (C. albula: θ = -0.004, p = 0.999; C. fontanae,
θ = -0.007, p = 0.99; 50175 iterations in ARLEQUIN),
thus samples were pooled for each population in subsequent analyses. The percentage of polymorphic loci varied from 64 - 92% within the 10 populations (Table 1).
Estimated with hs, the expected heterozygosity ranged
from 0.219 to 0.300, with the highest values being found
in the two C. albula populations that occur with the
sympatric species (Table 1).
There was significant genetic differentiation among
the 10 populations, with 22.52% of variation found
among populations (77.48% within populations;
AMOVA, d.f. = 9.261, p < 0.0001). Global values of θ
(0.225, p < 0.0001) and θ B (0.222; credibility interval
0.216 - 0.228 95%) were nearly identical and also
showed significant population structure. All pairwise
θ-values were significantly different from zero
(p < 0.0001) and ranged from 0.041 (C. albula from
Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin) to 0.405 (C. albula
from Lakes Brueckentin and Behler) (see additional file
1: AdditionalFile_FST_Matrix).

All nodes of the NJ tree of Nei’s genetic distances
were supported by bootstrap values of at least 95%
(Fig. 2). The tree grouped four lakes with single populations (Brueckentin, Glambeck, Tollense, Ploener) as
distinct from the two lakes with sympatric population
pairs (Stechlin, Breiter Luzin) (Fig. 2). Lakes Arend
and Behler appeared more closely related to Stechlin
and Breiter Luzin. Interestingly, the allopatric springspawners, C. fontanae and C. lucinensis, grouped more
closely to one another than either did to its sympatric
C. albula population (Fig. 2).
Pairwise genetic and geographical distances were
not correlated for the entire dataset (Mantel r = 0.26,
n = 45, p = 0.056), providing evidence that an IBD
model did not appropriately describe the pattern of
genetic differentiation among all 10 populations (see
additional file 2: AdditionalFile_IBD_Models). An IBD
model was also not appropriate to describe the genetic
differentiation between all eight C. albula populations
including those from Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin
(Mantel r = 0.31, n = 28, p = 0.086). In contrast, when
only the six lakes with only a C. albula population were
included, genetic distances increased significantly with
geographical distance as predicted by an IBD model
(Mantel r = 0.53, n = 15, p = 0.042). However, the
pairwise difference between the closely located Lakes
Ploener and Behler (Fig. 1) appeared to be slightly
higher (0.23) than predicted by strict linear pattern (see
additional file 2: AdditionalFile_IBD_Models).
Sympatric pairs

Pairwise differentiation (θB) within and among the sympatric population pairs in Lakes Stechlin and Breiter
Luzin ranged from 0.028 - 0.113 (Table 2). C. fontanae

appeared most distinct, while C. lucinensis was equally
differentiated from the three other populations (Table 2).
The lowest differentiation observed was between allopatric C. albula in Stechlin and Breiter Luzin (Table 2).
This was significantly lower (i.e., outside the 95% credibility interval) than the differentiation with either sympatric
taxon (C. fontanae in Lake Stechlin; C. lucinensis in Lake
Breiter Luzin.

The analyses of potential gene flow within the two
lakes by STRUCTURE found some evidence for the existence of hybrids between sympatric populations (Fig. 3).

Lakes Arend and Tollense as potential stocking sources. Hybrids refer either to the first (F1) or the second and older (F2) parental generations.

P = 96%). Three individuals (one C. fontanae and two C.
albula from Breiter Luzin) showed elevated probabilities
of misclassification (alternative assignment) or hybridization in the F1-generation (Fig. 3). For 23 individuals,
there was a high probability of F2- or older hybridizations
with the sympatric population. In contrast, the probability
of F1-hybrids formed with stocked fish from Lakes Arend
and Tollense was zero for all populations, and only six
individuals showed a high probability of F2- and older
hybrids with stocked fish (Fig. 3).
Outlier loci

The explorative genome scans revealed very few loci to
be positively exceeding neutral expectations (at p =
0.995) in the two lakes with sympatric population pairs.
More loci under putative selection were found in Lake
Stechlin (n = 12, ca. 0.95%; Fig. 4a) than in Lake Breiter
Luzin (n = 3, ca. 0.24%; Fig. 4b). No single locus was
non-neutral in both lakes. At the p = 0.975 quantile,
5.30% of loci (n = 67) were positively non-neutral in
Lake Stechlin, and 2.21% (n = 28) in Breiter Luzin. At
this quantile, three loci (numbers 233, 879, 1100) were
shared from both lakes (Fig. 4a, b).
After removal of all 95 loci putatively under selection
above the p = 0.975 quantile in either Lake Stechlin or
Breiter Luzin, genetic differentiation based on the
remaining loci declined considerably, in particular
between the sympatric pairs (Table 2). θB-values were
almost identical between C. albula and C. fontanae in
Lake Stechlin (0.043) and C. albula and C. lucinensis in
Lake Breiter Luzin (0.049), and did not differ from the
differentiation between C. fontanae and C. lucinensis
(0.043) (Table 2). Only differentiation between both
C. albula populations was still lower (0.027), with its
credibility interval not overlapping with those of any
other pairwise comparisons (Table 2).
Genetic distances between the eight C. albula populations remained almost unaffected by the removal of outlier loci. The NJ-tree calculated from the putatively
neutral AFLP loci had an identical topology to the NJtree based on all AFLP loci (Fig. 2), with only minimal
changes in branch lengths (results not shown).

Discussion
Conflicting evidence for sympatric speciation

Our results suggest that the post-glacial evolution of
sympatric Coregonus pairs studied here is more complex
than previously thought. Neither spring spawner
occurred elsewhere in allopatry, supporting the hypothesis that they evolved by sympatric speciation from the
autumn-spawning C. albula within each lake, as suggested previously [33]. Nonetheless, the pattern of
genetic differentiation that we observed contradicts this
hypothesis. In cases of sympatric speciation, sympatric

Page 7 of 14

taxa should be more closely related [9], but here the
autumn-spawning C. albula were more similar to each
other than either was to its sympatric spring spawner.
This was evident from the tests of pairwise population
differentiation as well as from the NJ-tree based on
genetic distance. These results were similar to an allozyme study of 19 Finnish lakes, where allopatric autumn
spawners formed a separate group to winter- or spring
spawners [41].
The complexity of the evolutionary history is evidenced by the somewhat conflicting results of previous
genetic analyses. Six microsatellite loci revealed greater
genetic similarity between sympatric spring- and
autumn-spawners within lakes, thus suggesting ongoing
gene flow and a sympatric origin [33]. In contrast,
mtDNA from the same study [33] qualitatively support
the AFLP results here, that differentiation between sympatric taxa is greater than between allopatric taxa. In
particular, the two most abundant of four recorded haplotypes were shared by C. albula in both lakes. One of
these was shared with the Stechlin sympatric C. fontanae and the other was shared with the Lake Breiter
Luzin sympatric C. lucinensis. C. fontanae and C. lucinensis shared no haplotypes [33].
The reason for the discrepancy between the microsatellite and AFLP data in one of the population pairs is
not clear. The large number of AFLP loci employed
here (>1200) should provide a better estimate of divergence than microsatellite loci (6), although we found
evidence that not all loci were strictly neutral. The two
marker systems produced similar estimates of genetic
structure for populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta
L.) in 11 Norwegian lakes, although admixture was
greater based on AFLP [42]. AFLP results were more
congruent than mtDNA with morphological characters
in mormyrid electric fishes, likely due to mitochondrial
introgression among lineages [43]. Accordingly, AFLP
seem to be an appropriate tool to examine the genetic
differentiation of incipient ecological speciation [44]. But
as noted above, our results suggest that not all AFLP
markers were strictly neutral. Removing the loci putatively under selection reduced the within-lake genetic
distances considerably, and differentiation based on the
remaining neutral AFLP loci was more similar to the
pattern obtained from the neutral microsatellite data.
Interestingly, the genetic distance to other, allopatric
C. albula populations remained largely unaffected.
Previous studies similarly found that differentiation
between ecologically or morphologically distinct populations can be maintained for a small portion of the
genome, whereas gene exchange continues to prevent
divergence at the majority of loci [16,45].
Only three outlier loci occurred in both sympatric
pairs at p > 0.975. It is possible that such a small

number of loci positively exceeding neutral expectations
might have occurred just by chance, thus providing little
evidence in support of the hypothesis that the sympatric
pairs result from parallel sympatric speciation [12].
Alternatively, it may be that only a few genes are
involved. The few shared loci deserve further attention
since recent analyses in the C. clupeaformis complex in
North America indicated that these θ outliers can be
significantly clustered around quantitative trait loci
(QTL) involved in ecologically based reproductive isolation [46-48]. Proportions of outlier loci substantially
exceeding 1% were found in other studies applying a
similar pairwise approach [13,15,16,49,50].
The presumed modes of ecological segregation have
been well studied in Lake Stechlin, where sympatric taxa
(C. albula and C. fontanae) perform diel vertical migrations with different amplitudes [51,52] and they differ in
their final temperature preferendum and their metabolic
costs of swimming [31,32]. The commonly observed
benthic-limnetic habitat and diet segregations typical for
whitefish do not occur in Stechlin [29]. Such a pattern
of physiological segregation but low trophic differentiation presumably exists for the species pair in Lake Breiter Luzin, since both lakes are deep, with steep
temperature gradients and overall low productivity [27].
Recent data suggest C. albula and C. lucinensis in Breiter Luzin have similar diets [53], as in Lake Stechlin
[29]. However, adaptive divergence may be weaker in
Lake Breiter Luzin than in Lake Stechlin. For example,
C. lucinensis and C. albula do not show the same strong
vertical microhabitat segregation (S. Schiller, LeibnizInstitute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries,
unpubl. results) as found between C. fontanae and
C. albula in Lake Stechlin [51]. A weaker adaptive
divergence is supported by the lower genetic distance
and a substantially lower number of loci putatively
under selection in Lake Breiter Luzin than in Lake
Stechlin. Accordingly, these species pairs would resemble ‘isolation by adaptation’ (IBA), a process in which
levels of genetic differentiation among population pairs
will be positively correlated with degree of adaptive
phenotypic divergence [13,16].

C. albula populations, hybridization with C. albula in
Stechlin and Breiter Luzin was hypothesized to be more
likely than hybridization with the spring-spawning
C. fontanae and C. lucinensis. Our results support this
hypothesis. Furthermore, our recent analysis of the
genetic effects of stocking on 23 allopatric C. albula
populations revealed a reduction of genetic distance by
about 10% between lakes stocked intensively with a
genetically similar source [39]. Accordingly, a weak secondary homogenization between Lakes Stechlin and
Breiter Luzin by stocking from Lakes Arend or Tollense
cannot be ruled out, but the evidence is not strong
enough to conclude that the similarity of the autumn
spawners is an exclusive effect of current fisheries management practices.
Hybridization within the lakes could also contribute to
the observed patterns, whereby introgression of
C. albula genetic polymorphisms may obscure any
historical similarities of the two spring spawners.
Because species that have evolved since the most recent
glaciation about 12,000 years ago may not have developed full genetic incompatibilities, they may hybridize
with little fitness loss [35]. The probability that single
individuals have parents or grandparents from the other
population was low, but greater than zero in all four
populations. Therefore, gene flow between the sympatric
populations may not be completely interrupted, despite
the differing spawning times. Weak ongoing hybridization between the sympatric populations can also be
inferred from the higher heterozygosity of sympatric
compared with allopatric C. albula populations [54]. In
this analysis, we used a high prior probability of pure
ancestry similarly applied to the analysis of sympatric
whitefish populations from the Canadian Cliff Lake [55].
This sympatric whitefish population pair was identified
as being reproductively isolated by AFLP-markers
(θB = 0.22) [4], but nevertheless encompassed seven out
of 47 individuals with strong evidence for mixed ancestry [55]. Accordingly, occasional hybridization within
the two sympatric populations of the C. albula complex
studied here cannot be excluded.

Stocking and hybridization

Large-scale genetic structure of Coregonus

An important part of our analysis was to determine
whether the genetic similarity of Stechlin and Breiter
Luzin C. albula was a result of modification by stocking
and hybridization. Enhancement stocking of vendace
populations by freshly hatched larvae (up to 6000 ind.
ha-1 annually) obtained primarily from two source populations (Lakes Arend and Tollense) has been practised in
Germany for at least 50 years, with the aim of stabilizing
natural recruitment and fisheries yield of sympatric and
allopatric C. albula populations [39]. Because both

An important finding was that the sympatric populations of Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin were genetically distinct from the six other C. albula populations
(Brueckentin, Glambeck, Ploener, Tollense, Ahrend,
Behler). These patterns were confirmed by the IBD analyses, which demonstrated that increasing genetic distances corresponded to increasing geographical
distances only for the six lakes with single C. albula
populations. The interruption of the IBD became
obvious when all eight C. albula populations were

Mehner et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/85

included, suggesting that the C. albula in sympatry with
spring-spawners are genetically distinct from other
C. albula populations. Even within the six allopatric
C. albula populations, the IBD model was slightly biased
by a higher-than-expected genetic distance between the
neighboring Lakes Ploener and Behler. This is attributable to a higher genetic similarity of the population from
Lake Behler to the sympatric populations and to
C. albula from Lake Arend. The C. albula population in
Lake Arend is not native, but has been introduced from
Lake Enzig (Outer Pomerania, now Poland) about 100
years ago [56]. Historical introduction of C. albula in
Lake Behler cannot be excluded, whereas recent stocking can be ruled out [39]. Altogether, the results from
our analyses suggest a complex evolutionary scenario for
the sympatric populations, including putative parallel
sympatric speciation, introgression on secondary contact, divergent selection and within-lake hybridization.
Taken together, our results suggest the following evolutionary and phylogeographical hypothesis: All lakes in
northern Germany including Lakes Stechlin and Breiter
Luzin were invaded from a single refuge after the last
glaciation about 12,000 years ago. This founder lineage
of C. albula still exists in the majority of the lakes. The
genetic differentiation between these populations can be
appropriately described by an IBD model [this study]
which is only slightly modified by more recent stocking
[39]. In two of the deepest lakes (Stechlin and Breiter
Luzin), parallel sympatric speciation along steep vertical
abiotic gradients may have occurred. The putative sympatric speciation is suggested by the low within-lake
genetic segregation of sympatric pairs by neutral markers [33]. Subsequent divergent selection may have
induced a stronger genetic segregation of sympatric
pairs, as suggested by the AFLP markers used here. Evidence for strong recent selection comes from the fact
that the removal of AFLP loci putatively under selection
substantially reduced the genetic differentiation of the
sympatric pairs. Furthermore, physiological studies suggest that ecological divergence is driven by temperaturebased adaptations of the sympatric pair at least in Lake
Stechlin [31,32]. Recent stocking from identical autumnspawning sources [39] may have slightly reduced the
genetic distance between the C. albula populations in
Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin, as indicated by a low
frequency of hybridization between these populations
and C. albula from Lake Tollense. Secondary contact
with another Coregonus lineage and subsequent introgression may have further shaped the genetic signature
of the sympatric populations. Introgression is
more likely for the autumn-spawning C. albula
because the majority of all other European populations
of the C. albula complex are autumn-spawners [24].
Ongoing within-lake hybridization between sympatric

Page 10 of 14

populations, as demonstrated here by the STRUCTURE
analyses, may have resulted in the spreading of introgressed genetic material into both populations. Introgression after secondary contact may explain why both
C. albula and the spring-spawning C. fontanae and
C. lucinensis of Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin were
genetically distinct to the allopatric C. albula in the
other German lakes.
The source of the secondary contact could be from
populations living farther east. This is suggested by the
similarity between Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin and
the population from Lake Arend, which has a historical
origin in Poland. Brzuzan et al. [57] demonstrated that
two distinct lineages exist within Polish C. albula populations, with one group occurring in the east, and one in
central and west Poland. These authors speculated that
these may have evolved by colonization from different
refugia or by introgression from C. sardinella [57].
Interestingly, introgression from C. sardinella has also
been suspected for the Lake Breiter Luzin populations
[33]. An allozyme study [25] found low genetic distances
between C. sardinella and C. albula populations in
Russia. Accordingly, we cannot exclude that populations
exist in East Europe which are part of a separate lineage
involved into the secondary contact with the German
sympatric populations, thus explaining the genetic similarity between Lakes Arend, Stechlin and Breiter Luzin.
We would like to emphasize that this complex scenario
is hypothetical at the moment. We cannot exclude that
the sympatric populations had an allopatric divergence
or originate from two different refugia [33], followed by
reinforcement on secondary contact in Lakes Stechlin
and Breiter Luzin. In this case, adaptive differentiation
might have followed nonecological speciation [11].
Based on all available evidence from this and other studies, further clarification of speciation mode will require
samples of the C. albula complex from several populations in Poland and Russia to be included in the analysis, as well as additional sympatric populations existing
in Russia and Scandinavia [24]. Comparable evidence for
multiple invasions as the main mechanism for adaptive
divergence within single lakes was found for C. clupeaformis [58] and sticklebacks [59] in North America.
Therefore, we cannot exclude that Russian or Scandinavian sympatric populations of the C. albula complex
[25,26] underwent an allopatric stage as well.

Conclusions
The effects of hybridization and stocking on the commercially important Coregonus can be quantified and
accounted for, thus the group remains an excellent
model for the study of speciation in sympatry. Despite
having used more than 1200 marker loci in a study of
10 populations, our data failed to provide conclusive

Mehner et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/85

evidence for whether spring-spawning Coregonus stem
from parallel sympatric speciation. Parallel trends in
niche differentiation and phenotypic differentiation are
evident in both lakes with sympatric populations, but
neutral genetic differentiation suggests allopatric speciation and introgression on secondary contact. It is clear
that population genetic criteria alone cannot resolve the
mechanisms of speciation, and that our analysis benefited from a large spatial scale of sampling. Examination
of relative differences within and among lakes has raised
the possibility that multiple lineages may be present in
northern Germany. As a result, phylogenetic analysis
and sampling of additional lakes from potential source
populations from a broad geographic range is required
for an unequivocal identification of the evolutionary
mechanisms and phylogeography which have led to the
ecological and genetic diversity found in the C. albula
complex.

Methods
Sampling

Ten populations of Baltic ciscoes were sampled from
eight lakes in Germany from 2000 to 2004 (Fig. 1). In
two of the lakes, C. albula occurs sympatrically with a
spring-spawner; C. fontanae in Lake Stechlin and
C. lucinensis in Lake Breiter Luzin. The remaining six
populations of C. albula occur in allopatry in northern
Germany, at variable geographic distances to Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin (Fig. 1, Table 1). Two lakes
(Arend, Tollense) were documented source populations
for enhancement stocking for a large number of lakes in
northern Germany [39]. The remaining four lakes
(Glambeck, Brueckentin, Behler, Ploener) exhibit little
or no genetic evidence of stocking [39], and are therefore considered as near-native populations. These lakes
were included to determine whether the spring-spawning sympatric taxa (C. fontanae, C. lucinensis) occur
elsewhere in allopatry.
In total, 271 individuals were analysed, with the number of analysed specimens per population varying
between 12 and 38. To verify that all procedures and
analyses produced consistent results, the Lake Stechlin
populations were sampled twice, in 2000/2001 and 2007.
These samples were later combined because the pairwise
θ between the repeated samplings were not significantly

different from zero (see results). All fish were caught
with gill nets or trawls and stored on ice immediately
after removal from the nets. Subsequently, clips from
the pectoral fin were stored in pure ethanol.
Genetic (AFLP) analysis

We examined population genetic diversity using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) in order to
generate the large number of characters needed for
genomic scans of non-model organisms [4,60]. We
developed a multiplex method of fragment generation in
order to increase the number of scorable bands in a
given reaction. Total genomic DNA was extracted from
pectoral fin tissue using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA-quality
was visually inspected under UV-light on a 1% agarosegel stained with ethidium bromide. For subsequent analysis, only samples with a clearly visible high molecular
weight band were used. AFLP analysis was carried out
following a slightly modified protocol of the AFLPmethod [61]. Restriction and ligation were carried out in
a single step in a thermocycler (2 h at 37°C, 8 h at
16°C). Genomic DNA (300-400 ng DNA per sample)
was digested with restriction enzymes MseI (1 unit) and
EcoRI (5 units). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) adaptors specific to the cutting sites were ligated using
DNA-Ligase (1 unit; all enzymes from New England
Biolabs). Preselective PCR was performed with one
selective base on each primer (MseI+C and EcoRI+A; all
oligonucleotides from Metabion). PCR product quality
was visually confirmed on an agarose gel after preselective amplification. For the selective amplifications, two
additional bases were added to the 3’ end of each primer
(MseI/EcoRI DYE ) und the utilization of two different
fluorescent dyes permitted multiplexing, where two
EcoRI primers were combined with one MseI primer
(Table 3).
Fragments were separated on an ABI Avant 3100
capillary sequencer with an internal size standard (GeneScan-500 LIZ; Applied Biosystems). Signal processing
and binning were carried out using GeneMapper® v4.0
(Applied Biosystems). Optimization yielded the following
settings: bin width 1 bp, maximal peak width of 1.5 bp,
scoring to presence (1) or absence (0) of fragments
between 100 and 400 bp. Normalization to the sum of

All primers had 3 additional bases on the 3’ end. EcoRI primers A and B were labelled with different fluorescent dyes (fam and joe) and 3 different multiplex
reactions were run with two forward and one backward primer each.

signal versus a fixed cut off value did not cause any differences, thus we used peak detection levels of 50 relative fluorescent units. Correct fit of the size standard
was checked manually for all electropherograms. Larger
fragments were excluded from the analyses to avoid
errors from signal-strength drop off resulting from PCR
or capillary loading bias. Only electrograms were evaluated which met the following criteria: smallest detected
fragments < 50 bp and largest > 450, at least 5 fragments > 400 bp, no visible drop outs (signal remaining
flat at base line for > 20 bp) in the entire spectrum, a
minimum of 100 fragments in each primer combination
and reproducible standards. We used 2 samples as standards in each PCR and subsequent analyses. They were
considered reproducible only if they yielded > 95% fragment reproducibility to previous runs. Analyses of individual samples were repeated from restriction/ligation
on until meeting the above described criteria. A second
complete AFLP analysis of a random 10% of the samples
yielded 96.08% reproducibility.
Genetic diversity and structure of all Coregonus
populations

Preparation of input data files for analyses was conducted by AFLPDAT[62]. Data on population genetic
structure were summarized using the frequency of polymorphic fragments as calculated in AFLP-SURV[63].
The expected heterozygosity hs, the mean within-population expected heterozygosity Hs, and their 95% credibility values, were calculated using a Bayesian approach
with 250,000 generations after a burn-in of 50,000 generations implemented in HICKORY 1.1 [64]. To account
for potential slight deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, we ran the full model which calculates an
inbreeding coefficient (FIS). Because this value can be
unreliable [65], we report only the results on overall
population differentiation here.
The genetic structure within and among all 10 populations was inferred from an analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) and a global estimate of among-population
differentiation (θ) [66], both calculated using ARLEQUIN
3.2 [67]. Pairwise θ was calculated for all population pairs
and tested for significant deviation from zero by a
numerical resampling procedure in ARLEQUIN. All analyses used 50,175 permutations. An overall estimate of
genetic differentiation using a Bayesian approach (θB)
[68] was also calculated using HICKORY as described
above (θII in the notation of the HICKORY manual). A
modified Nei’s genetic distance [69] was calculated
between all population pairs in order to create an
unrooted neighbor-joining (NJ) tree using PHYLIP 3.6
[70]. Subsequently, the distance matrix was bootstrapped
100,000 times using AFLP-SURV to calculate a majorityrule consensus tree in PHYLIP 3.6 [70].

Page 12 of 14

An isolation-by-distance model was calculated by correlating the matrices of log10 direct geographical distances (km) and pairwise genetic distance (θ/1-θ) [66]
between the lakes by a Mantel test (n = 45 pairwise
comparisons, PC-ORD 5.01 [71]). The geographical distances between the sympatric populations in either
Lakes Stechlin or Breiter Luzin were arbitrarily set to
1 km (i.e., log10 = 0). Stepwise Mantel tests were subsequently separately performed by first removing the two
spring-spawning populations C. lucinensis and C. fontanae (8 lakes, n = 28 pairwise comparisons) and then
removing the two C. albula populations from Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin (6 lakes, n = 15 pairwise comparisons). These tests aimed to determine whether IBD
was disrupted by inclusion of the sympatric populations.
Differentiation and hybridization among sympatric pairs

We calculated pairwise θB using HICKORY in order to
obtain 95% credibility intervals for differentiation among
the four populations that occur as sympatric pairs
(20,000 burn-in iterations, 100,000 final iterations).
Furthermore, STRUCTURE 2.2 [40,55] was used to
investigate possible gene flow between the sympatric
populations within the two lakes, and to detect potential
hybridization with stocked fish from Lakes Arend and
Tollense. We assumed that most individuals of both
populations each had pure ancestry but that a small
proportion of individuals may have some ancestry from
alternative populations. We set GENSBACK = 2 thus
assuming that the mixed ancestry may have originated
from the two previous generations. To ensure that there
is strong statistical support for any inference of mixed
ancestry, we set the prior probability of migrants to a
low value (MIGRPRIOR = 0.01). The calculations were
performed on the final 50,000 runs, after discarding the
first 10,000 runs as a burn-in.
Outlier loci

To evaluate those AFLP loci that may be subject to
selection, a genome scan was conducted by assuming
that genetic differentiation between sympatric populations is higher for those loci that are under divergent
selection [4,72]. FST and heterozygosity per polymorphic
locus were calculated for the two population pairs and
compared with simulated null distributions (at p = 0.95
and p = 0.99) using DFDIST[73,74]. The simulated
quantiles and the locus-specific FST were plotted against
heterozygosity to determine those loci for which the
neutral model could be rejected [73,74]. These outlier
loci were compared between the two lakes. At p = 0.99,
the probability that loci putatively under selection are
shared in both lakes just by chance is 0.01 × 0.01 ×
1264 = 0.1264. Accordingly, any locus with p > 0.995 or
p < 0.005 found in both lakes would be a true outlier.

Mehner et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/85

At p = 0.95, up to three shared loci (0.05 × 0.05 × 1264
= 3.16) could be false positives.
Subsequently, we removed all loci putatively under
positive selection in either Lakes Stechlin or Breiter
Luzin at p = 0.95 (n = 95, see results), and again calculated pairwise θ B using HICKORY in order to obtain
95% credibility intervals for differentiation among the
four populations that occur as sympatric pairs (20,000
burn-in iterations, 100,000 final iterations). Furthermore,
a NJ tree was calculated based on Nei’s distance
between all 10 populations, based on the reduced matrix
of supposedly neutral AFLP loci.
