Abstract
Background: The full power of modern genetics has been applied to the study of speciation in only a small handful of
genetic model species - all of which speciated allopatrically. Here we report the first large expressed sequence tag (EST)
study of a candidate for ecological sympatric speciation, the apple maggot Rhagoletis pomonella, using massively parallel
pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-FLX platform. To maximize transcript diversity we created and sequenced separate
libraries from larvae, pupae, adult heads, and headless adult bodies.
Results: We obtained 239,531 sequences which assembled into 24,373 contigs. A total of 6810 unique protein coding
genes were identified among the contigs and long singletons, corresponding to 48% of all known Drosophila melanogaster
protein-coding genes. Their distribution across GO classes suggests that we have obtained a representative sample of
the transcriptome. Among these sequences are many candidates for potential R. pomonella "speciation genes" (or "barrier
genes") such as those controlling chemosensory and life-history timing processes. Furthermore, we identified important
marker loci including more than 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and over 100 microsatellites. An initial
search for SNPs at which the apple and hawthorn host races differ suggested at least 75 loci warranting further work.
We also determined that developmental expression differences remained even after normalization; transcripts expected
to show different expression levels between larvae and pupae in D. melanogaster also did so in R. pomonella. Preliminary
comparative analysis of transcript presences and absences revealed evidence of gene loss in Drosophila and gain in the
higher dipteran clade Schizophora.
Conclusions: These data provide a much needed resource for exploring mechanisms of divergence in this important
model for sympatric ecological speciation. Our description of ESTs from a substantial portion of the R. pomonella
transcriptome will facilitate future functional studies of candidate genes for olfaction and diapause-related life history
timing, and will enable large scale expression studies. Similarly, the identification of new SNP and microsatellite markers
will facilitate future population and quantitative genetic studies of divergence between the apple and hawthorn-infesting
host races.

Background
How new species arise is a fundamental question in biology. Historically, the formation of new species has been
studied in a wide variety of organisms whose natural history provides special insight into the ecological and geographic conditions thought to lead to speciation [1]. But
in only a tiny subset of these organisms has it been possible to apply the full power of modern genetics - the ability
to identify, sequence, and experimentally manipulate any
gene in the genome - to the study of reproductive isolation
[2]. Recent advances in sequencing technology, however,
have begun to break this constraint. Genomic resources
can now be obtained, and are being obtained, for the
entire wide range of organisms needed to study the multitudinous modes of speciation [1-3].
Here we have applied transcriptome pyrosequencing to an
organism proposed to have undergone sympatric, ecological speciation: the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella
(Walsh). A population of this native North American
fruit-feeding insect infesting hawthorn (Rosaceae: Crataegus spp.) shifted to attack introduced apple (Rosaceae:
Malus pumila) in about 1860 [4,5], becoming an economically-important crop pest and, almost immediately after,
an evolutionary cause célèbre [6]. The central premise of
sympatric speciation in R. pomonella is that ecological
adaptation to apple has resulted in the formation of a new
apple-infesting host race of the fly that is partially reproductively isolated from ancestral hawthorn-infesting populations, a critical first step in the process of ecological
sympatric speciation.
The last decade has seen an intensified search for "speciation genes" [7,8] responsible for reproductive barriers
between taxa. For the apple and hawthorn host races of R.
pomonella, two traits have been shown to be of particular
importance in host adaptation, and, concomitantly,
reproductive isolation. The first trait is host fidelity;
because Rhagoletis flies mate on or near the fruit of their
respective host plants, differences in host choice translate
directly into mate choice and prezygotic reproductive isolation [9]. Adult flies use volatile compounds emitted
from the surface of ripening fruit as key olfactory cues to
find and discriminate among host plants [10]. Flies of the
hawthorn and apple host races are attracted to the fruit
odors of their respective hosts, and even avoid the odors
of the other host fruit [10]. Odor attraction has a genetic
basis, but it has not yet been possible to map specific
olfactory loci in Rhagoletis [11]. But because of the relative
phylogenetic proximity of Tephritidae to Drosophilidae,
candidate loci for odor recognition can be inferred from
the extensive research on chemoreception in D. melanogaster [12,13].
The second trait reproductively isolating the apple and
hawthorn host races is life-history timing (and in particu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/633

lar, diapause timing). Rhagoletis flies are univoltine and
typically have just one generation per year. Flies overwinter as diapausing pupae in the soil and emerge the next
summer just prior to the peak of host fruit availability.
Because the host plants of R. pomonella fruit at different
times of year and adult flies live for only about a month,
the flies must differentially time their life histories to
match maximal host fruit availability for mating and oviposition. The apple race has been selected for both deeper
initial diapause depth and earlier post winter eclosion
[14-16], in response to the 2-3 week earlier fruiting time
of domestic apples compared to hawthorns. Differences
in diapause timing between the host races have been associated with a series of chromosome inversions thought to
contain linked blocks of genes that affect diapause depth
and timing, and thereby allochronic mating isolation
between the two host races [17]. Specific loci functionally
affecting diapause have not yet been identified and
mapped within the inversions for Rhagoletis, but genes
associated with diapause entry, maintenance, and termination have been described for other insects [18-21], providing useful candidate loci for analysis in Rhagoletis.
Although host fruit choice and diapause timing are the
key isolating traits, other traits may play a role in reproductive isolation in Rhagoletis, and could be analyzed
given genomic resources for Rhagoletis. Among these are
genes for differential larval fitness on the two hosts [22]
and for host-independent sexual isolation [23]. In addition, because there is great genetic similarity within the R.
pomonella species complex [24,25], ESTs generated from
R. pomonella will be useful for the genetic analysis of the
entire sibling species complex, including economicallyimportant crop pests like the blueberry maggot R. mendax
Curran, and the evolutionarily significant "Lonicera fly", a
recent population of hybrid R. mendax × R. zephyria origin
[26].
Although the two host races are largely reproductively isolated, low rates of gene flow do occur between the two
host races at sites where both occur together [27]. Therefore, the R. pomonella host races provide an exceptionally
clear example of a "divergence with gene flow" process
[28,29]. For some chromosome inversions in R. pomonella
this process can be studied directly, because the forces
producing the balance between host adaptation and the
erosion of this adaptation by ongoing gene flow have
actually been measured instead of just inferred [9,15,30].
But for the more typical case, in Rhagoletis and elsewhere,
divergence with gene flow can be studied quantitatively
only by measuring variation in divergence among large
numbers of loci [31]. While allozyme loci [32-34], and
more recently several dozen microsatellite marker loci
[35], have provided important insights into population
structure and ecological speciation in the R. pomonella
host races, marker density remains low and developing a

series of higher density markers, such as single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) would provide greater resolution
for studies of divergence with gene flow. Furthermore
high densities of SNPs would provide markers for additional studies like classical genetic mapping, analysis of
population structure, and association mapping of loci
that are involved in differential host adaptation.
Therefore the primary goals of our study were to: 1) characterize a substantial representation of the R. pomonella
transcriptome, and 2) to use the assembly of numerous
short reads into contigs to identify SNP markers for future
studies. In addition to meeting these goals, we have preliminarily identified SNPs that differ between the two
host races, we have identified clear differences in the
abundance of transcripts between developmental stages,
even in normalized cDNA libraries, and we have identified several transcripts that suggest interesting patterns of
gene loss or gain among the higher flies.

Results and Discussion
Overall sequencing
To maximize transcriptome sampling we made individual
libraries for larvae, pupae, adult heads, and headless adult
bodies, and sequenced each library separately across several 454 plates (Table 1). The combined analysis of all
runs produced 239,531 sequences that assembled into
24,373 contigs (basic sequencing summaries are in Additional file 1). The mean length of contigs was 350 bp,
which compares well with the means of 332 and 353 in
two other recent 454-based transcriptome studies [36,37].
Contig lengths stretched from 100 bp (the lower bound

set by the assembly algorithm) to a maximum of 2823 bp.
Contig lengths of 100 - 300 bp were most frequent, but
contigs > 300 bp still constituted 32% of all contigs (Additional file 2A). The range of number of reads was broad,
stretching from 2 to 1820. The distribution was nevertheless strongly skewed towards contigs with few reads. The
mean number of reads per contig was 13.92, but the distribution was highly skewed towards lower read numbers
per contig with a long tail of contigs with many reads (SD
= 47.97 reads/contig). Only 25% of contigs had 10 reads
or more, and 2% of contigs had 100 reads or more with
1820 as the highest number of reads/contig (Additional
file 2B). After we filtered all remaining singleton
sequences for repeat regions a set of 50,112 singletons
were left, 25,090 of which were 100 bp or longer. Files
containing our raw sequences and quality scores are available for BLAST search at GenBank SRX001885 and
SRX001531 (heads), SRX001121 (larvae), SRX001530
(bodies minus heads), and SRX001529 (pupae).
We annotated our assembled pool of R. pomonella
sequences (contigs and singletons = 100) to the nonredundant D. melanogaster protein coding dataset. Our
sequences matched 6810 unique D. melanogaster proteins with high confidence (≤ e-5). This corresponds to ca.
48% of all known D. melanogaster structural, proteincoding genes. Assuming that Rhagoletis has a similar gene
number as such diverse Diptera as Anopheles (ca. 13,000
genes), Drosophila (ca. 14,000 genes) and Aedes (ca.
17,000 genes), our 6,810 protein-coding genes represent
between 40% and 52% of the estimated number of R.
pomonella protein-coding genes. We note that the exact

numbers of genes inferred to be sampled in R. pomonella
may vary somewhat as we obtain a better understanding
of alterative splicing, which will be possible with larger
transcriptome data sets. Unannotated contig assemblies
are available at GenBank EZ116220 - EZ140593. The data,
organized into four files, are also available at http://
www.life.illinois.edu/berlocher/
454_pyrosequencing_files/. Two Excel files contain annotations of contigs matching protein-coding genes
("Rhagoletis_pom_contig_blast.xls") and singletons
("Rhagoletis_pom_single_blast.xls"). Two text files,
"Rhagoletis_pom_all_seq.txt"
and
"Rhagoletis_pom_contig_seq.txt", contain sequences, and
contig and uaccno numbers (read identifications from the
454 machine) to allow for coordination of results.
A notable result of the "short length/high copy" output of
pyrosequencing is that some transcripts were sequenced
as 2 or 3 noncontiguous fragments that mapped to different parts of the respective homologous Drosophila protein.
Thirty percent of all Drosophila genes matched by our ESTs
were matches by both multiple singletons and a contig,
demonstrating that a sizable proportion of transcripts
were sequenced as multiple, independent pieces. Having
several separate fragments distributed at multiple places
in any transcript can facilitate efforts to develop fulllength sequences for transcripts of interest using traditional PCR-based methods, such as RACE.
Our sequenced fragments matched ca. 50% of all known
D. melanogaster genes; although our relatively stringent
cut-off of e-05 for the protein matches with D. melanogaster certainly omitted valid matches to some singletons and/or highly divergent genes. For example, some of
the alignments to odorant receptors had e-values several
orders of magnitudes larger than e-05, but could still be
unequivocally identified as odorant receptors due to the
unique sequence structure of these proteins. Directed
searches for additional candidate transcripts will
undoubtedly reveal many more identifications.
A total of 5,666 of our 6,810 annotated transcripts were
assigned to 14 major sub-categories in the Biological Process GO category (Fig. 1). To determine if the transcripts we
identified were representative of our expectations for the
transcriptome as a whole, we compared the distribution
of R. pomonella sequences mapping to the GO sub-categories described above with similar distributions of transcripts from the entire Drosophila melanogaster genome,
and the partial transcriptome of the flesh fly Sarcophaga
crassipalpis, another higher fly for which a substantial EST
database has recently been developed using 454-pyrosequencing [36]. While there are small differences in the
percentage of transcripts across sub-categories between
the three species of flies, none were significantly under- or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/633

over-represented across the three species (all Pearson's χ2
p > 0.05). Therefore, the overall concordance between the
distributions across all three species suggests that the
sequences generated in this project are broadly representative of the R. pomonella transcriptome (Fig. 2). Therefore,
we have achieved our first major goal of describing a substantial, representative portion of the R. pomonella transcriptome.
Candidate transcripts for host fruit discrimination and
diapause, two mechanisms of reproductive isolation
between the host races
In addition to our relatively stringent bulk annotations (≤
e-5), we specifically searched our contigs and singletons
for transcripts that we expected to be involved in host
odor discrimination and diapause, two traits contributing
to reproductive isolation between the two host races. In
searching for receptors, we made use of unique features of
receptors (conserved amino acid positions, transmembrane domains, etc.), and in some cases we were able to
identify receptors for which the e-value was substantially
greater than e-5. In our search for chemoreception transcripts, we identified contigs or singletons representing 7
odorant receptors (ORs), 2 gustatory receptors (GRs), and
2 of the newly described [38] ionotropic glutamate receptors (IRs), with multiple fragments for some transcripts
(Table 2). All R. pomonella putative ORs were represented
by a single read with the exception of one matching D.
melanogaster Or 49b, sequenced in two separate, non-overlapping reads. The R. pomonella receptor ESTs were short
and ranged in size from 116-283 bp (33-82 aa). If R. pomonella has a similar number of ORs to D. melanogaster, we
estimate that we recovered sequences from about 10% of
the ORs [13].

One of our ORs is homologous to RSOr1, previously
sequenced in an antennal EST library from the walnut
husk fly R. suavis using conventional cloning/Sanger
sequencing [39]. We did not find matches to the two other
tephritid fly ORs reported thus far, both recovered from
the Medfly Ceratitis capitata using conventional cloning/
Sanger sequencing of a head EST library [40]. One of
these, the non-canonical D. melanogaster Or83b, is highly
conserved throughout the insects [41] and its absence in
Rhagoletis would be surprising. However, one of the major
problems in searching for OR sequences is their very low
level of expression; in Drosophila, previous work found
only about one OR per 500,000 clones in an antennal
library [42] using conventional cloning/Sanger sequencing. Given this challenge, it is worthwhile to compare
approaches for recovering tephritid ORs. The recovery of
1 OR in 544 EST sequences in the R. suavis study by Ramsedell et al. [39] suggests that starting with antennae is
very effective - but it is also very labor intensive, and was
not used in this study for that reason. A previous study

describing ORs from Medflies [40] and ours both started
with mRNA from adult heads, but the two studies differ in
sequencing methodology. The roughly four times higher
capture of receptor transcripts in our study (8 vs. 2 for
Medfly) is almost certainly due to the due to the higher
number of ESTs that are generated by a pyrosequencing
approach (239,531 reads for R. pomonella vs. 21,253 reads
for the Medfly). But pyrosequencing fragments are typically shorter than conventional Sanger sequences, and all
of our fragments represent 30% or less of the receptor
length as estimated by alignment with D. melanogaster.
Recovery of sequences of interest was similarly low for IRs
and GRs. For example we found only two GRs, which represents only ca. 3% of the 66 GRs that have been discovered in D. melanogaster. Ligands have been identified for
Drosophila homologues of two of the eight odorant receptors identified in this study. Both Or43a and Or49a

respond to compounds typical of fruit odors [13].
Although none of these compounds match fruit volatiles
identified thus far as cues for R. pomonella [43,44], the D.
melanogaster work suggests that Or43a and 49a may well
be involved in fruit odor detection and therefore are good
candidates for future work on host fruit discrimination.
Our recovery rate was much better for the highly expressed
OBPs (Table 3). The 22 R. pomonella OBPs we discovered
in this study correspond to 43% of the 51 known number
of D. melanogaster OBPs. Alignment with D. melanogaster
sequences showed that we obtained complete coding
sequences for many R. pomonella OBP ESTs. We also found
cases in which a single D. melanogaster OBP represented
the best match to two different R. pomonella ESTs, as is also
the case in R. suavis [39], indicating either gene loss in D.
melanogaster or a duplication in the Rhagoletis lineage after

the last common ancestor between drosophilids and
tephritids.
We also discovered fragments of two gustatory receptors
(GRs) homologous to Drosophila Gr43a and Gr64b (Table
2). To our knowledge these are the first GR sequences
described for a tephritid fly. Ligands have been described
for only a small proportion of the 68 D. melanogaster GRs,
but among them are the polycistronic Gr64 sugar receptors [45] that we also recovered from R. pomonella heads.
The role of contact chemoreception is largely unstudied in
Rhagoletis but could be important in detecting differences
in fruit surface compounds [46], in the chemical composition of the fruit during oviposition [46], and in hostindependent mate choice [23]. All of these factors and
processes could act as reproductive barriers between
Rhagoletis species. Comparative molecular evolutionary
analysis of ORs and GRs suggests that these chemoreceptors are correlated with host specialization in D. sechellia
and D. erecta [47], two monophagous specialist species
within the mostly polyphagous melanogaster species
complex. Characterizing olfactory and gustatory transcripts in Rhagoletis provides an opportunity to assess the
role of chemoreception in the divergence of a group of
phytophagous insects with an extensive radiation into
diverse hosts [48].

Although genomic regions correlating with diapause timing have been identified in R. pomonella [15,16], specific
loci functionally affecting diapause have not yet been
identified and mapped in this species. However, genes
associated with diapause entry, maintenance, and termination have been described for other insects [18-21], providing useful candidates for analysis in Rhagoletis. We
generated a list of 92 candidate transcripts by compiling
the sets of candidate genes identified by Denlinger et al.
[18] and Hahn et al. [36] with transcripts classified as
being involved in either "circadian rhythm" or "eclosion
rhythm" in the GO matches above. We identified a subset
of 45 of these 92 candidate transcripts involved in several
major physiological pathways associated with diapause
including stress proteins, nutrient storage and metabolism, and endocrine signaling (Additional file 3). Like the
chemoreception candidates above, these transcripts provide a substantial resource for functional studies of diapause in R. pomonella.
Marker development
We also achieved our second major goal, identifying a
broad panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
for R. pomonella. In total we identified 41,841 SNPs distributed across 5581 contigs. SNPs were approximately
randomly distributed across Biological Process GO categories (Fig. 3) with slight underrepresentation within Cell
signalling (χ2 = 6.3 p < 0.05) and overrepresentation
within Metabolism (χ2 = 10.7 p < 0.001). These SNP locations provide a wealth of information for development of
high-throughput downstream population and quantitative genetic applications such as bead chip panels or pulldown marker enrichment strategies followed by direct
sequencing. This broad-based approach will allow us to
identify regions of genomic similarity and differentiation
between interbreeding host races and closely-related species, thereby identifying divergent regions that may house
"speciation genes", and testing current models of divergence with gene flow [49].

Because all pupae in this experiment came from a hawthorn population while all larvae came from an apple
population, we can also make some initial inferences
about SNP genotypes that differ among apple and hawthorn populations. We identified 386 SNPs distributed
across 220 contigs that demonstrated allele frequency differences among the host races in our samples. Of the 220
contigs, 126 were annotated (≤ e-5), against the Drosophila
melanogaster genome, although only 77 had characterized
assignments within the GO biological process functional
category (Additional file 4). We were able to assign reading frames to 76 of the 126 annotated contigs containing
115 total SNPs. Of these SNPs, 64 (56%) were nonsynonymous. However, our confidence in the reading frame is
highest within the local BLASTX alignments, and of 42

†Contigs and reads matching the same D. melanogaster locus map to
different regions of the Drosophila gene. Match is the D. melanogaster
locus name for the closest match, CG is the Celera Genome number
of the match, aa is the number of amino acids in the single read or
contig, %I is the percent aa match between the R. pomonella and D.
melanogaster homologous proteins, bp is the base pair length of the
single read or contig, Read/Contig is the R. pomonella identifier in our
data base, GenBank is the GenBank accession number, and So. is
source (Larva, Pupa, Head, or Body). Number of reads assembled in
contig is in parenthesis.
*Also matches an EST fragment of an OR from a congener, R. suavis
(ABW80750.1) at 100% I; see also GenBank EU204908.1.
‡A second fragment, EZ4BI6301FZM98, was identical but shorter
(contained entirely within EZ4BI6301FWMUT).

SNPs located in these regions only 18 (43%) were nonsynomymous (Additional file 5). The latter percentage
suggests that there may be quite substantial variation
among the host races at the protein coding level. Several
of the transcripts containing among host-race SNPs play
important roles in metabolism, stress responses, and signalling processes that we expect are important in the diapause response [18,19], including pyruvate kinase, HSP
23 and 27, Superoxide Dismutase II, and Juvenile Hormone Esterase (JHE) binding protein and Malic Enzyme
(ME). Of these we were able to identify nonsynonymous
SNPs in JHE binding protein and ME. Malic enzyme is one
of the original set of allozyme markers used to genetically
discriminate the host races [33,34]. One of the two SNPs
in ME falls within the local BLASTX peptide alignment
with Drosophila Malic Enzyme at residue 756, in the first
codon position, and produces a change from a polar
(Threonine) to a nonpolar (Alanine) amino acid. Six 454
reads from the apple population (all with "A" alleles) and
6 from the haw population (all with "G" alleles) cover the
SNP. The Malic Enzyme allozyme polymorphism (for
which the allele sequences have not yet been determined)
is tightly associated with host-race differences in seasonality [15,16] and may warrant future functional studies
given our independent identification of host-specific nonsynonymous polymorphism in an unguided analysis.

Admittedly, our inferences about host-race specific differences in SNP frequencies in this study are limited because
our sampling of the two host races was uneven with the
hawthorn population only represented by pupae and the
apple population only represented by larvae. However,
the host-race specific SNPs identified in this study represent a pool of strong candidates for future validation.
Pyrosequencing EST databases can also identify other
sequences useful for population and quantitative genetic
studies, such as microsatellite loci [36]. Using MSATCOMMANDER [50] we conservatively identified 169 microsatellite repeats among our contigs and singletons
(Additional file 6). We have not yet formally assessed any
of these loci for variability, but they may be a useful supplement to a panel of 80 GT-enriched microsatellites that
have previously been developed [51] and successfully
used for studies of R. pomonella population structure [35].
Expression differences in larval and pupal transcripts
Despite normalization, we obtained some information
about stage-specific expression from our separately
sequenced stage libraries (larva, pupa, adult heads, and
adult bodies minus heads). We point out at the onset that
we are not suggesting that accurate measurement of
expression differences can or should be performed on
normalized libraries, only that large, essentially "on or
off" expression information can be obtained in the very
first transciptome study on a species by tagging or separately sequencing different stages or tissues. To illustrate
the potential for finding such large stage-biased expression differences, we compared a subset of transcripts in
our larval and pupal pools that we expected would have
larval-biased expression. These included larval cuticle
transcripts [52] and transcripts for the digestive enzyme
trypsin; neither should be produced during the non-feeding pupal stage [53]. Our panel of larval cuticle genes (12
contigs annotated to 8 different D. melanogaster cuticle
transcripts) showed the expected bias with 893 out of 938
reads (95%) occurring in larval samples (Table 4). Similarly, of the 7 trypsin-related contigs, 411 out of 446 reads
(92%) occurred in larval samples. The percentage of these
transcripts expressed in the larva would undoubtedly be
greater in non-normalized RNA, but the unequal expression pattern we found is quite clear.
Estimates of gene loss and gain in comparison with
Drosophila
We identified two transcripts, for the genes Armadillo
repeat-containing-protein 8 and Cellular retinaldehydebinding protein, for which the evidence strongly supports
gene loss in Drosophila. Protein BLAST search revealed that

sequence) was very similar to the Armadillo repeat-containing-protein 8 locus of highly divergent organisms
ranging from the mosquito Culex quinquifasciatus
(XP_001861563.1, I = 51%, 1e-143), Homo sapiens
(EAW79075.1, I = 39%, 3e-104), the placozoan Trichoplax
adhaerens (XP_002110308.1, I = 34%, 2e-52), and the
fungus Ajellomyces dermatitidis (EEQ71730.1, I = 29%, 9e13). Yet the best match for R. pomonella contig 11078 to a
gene in the D. melanogaster complete genome was to Beta
Adaptin (CG12532, NP_523415.1, I = 23%), at an e value
of 0.52. Armadillo repeat-containing-protein 8 is a single
copy gene in all sequenced insect genomes except for
Aedes aegyptii (2 copies). Similar results were obtained for
contig 23434 (EZ139653) which matched the Cellular
retinaldehyde-binding protein locus throughout the Ani-

malia, but did not produce a high match within D. melanogaster.
Gene gains were also implied; we identified eight transcripts that had not been previously identified as unique
to the clade Schizophora (containing Drosophila, Rhagoletis, and house flies and their ilk). For four of these (contig 24366 [EZ140585], 01397 [EZ117616], 10054
[EZ126273], and 09054 [EZ125273], all of unknown
function) we found no matching non-Schizophoran
sequences at all. For the remaining four novel genes (contigs 09325 [EZ125544], 04014 [EZ120233], 01753
[EZ117972], and 04040 [EZ120259]), we were able to
identify distant ancestors outside the Schizophora; some
clearly represent new members of multigene families

Our inferences about gene gain and loss are admittedly
limited because an EST project produces an incomplete
sample of a species' genes. For example, we cannot determine whether the absence of a gene in Rhagoletis is due to
the actual absence of this gene, or to sampling error. However, we can conclude with confidence that a gene has
been lost in Drosophila when it occurs in Rhagoletis and
other insects but is missing in the completely sequenced
genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and relatives. Similarly, we can only be certain about whether an apparently
Drosophila-specific gene was gained prior to the common
ancestor of Rhagoletis and Drosophila, but not about
whether it was gained more recently after the drosophilid/
tephritid split. Even with these sampling limitations, however, gene gain/loss information from transcriptome studies has great potential for resolving the genealogies among
Rhagoletis, Drosophila, and other Schizophora.

Conclusions
The transcriptome data reported here will greatly expand
our insight into all the areas to which Rhagoletis pomonella
has contributed: ecological speciation, sympatric speciation, host plant adaptation, and the emergence of new
economically important insect pests. The impact of the
new data will first be felt in studies of olfaction and diapause-related life history timing, for which this study has

provided a wealth of new candidate loci. But the SNP and
microsatellite markers reported here will also facilitate
new work on the population and quantitative genetic
studies of divergence between the apple and hawthorninfesting host races. Furthermore, these data will serve as
a basis for exploring the molecular genetics of host plant
radiation and adaptation more broadly in the closelyrelated members of the R. pomonella species group, which
contains a bevy of host-plant specialists including the economically-important blueberry maggot R. mendax and the
newly identified "Lonicera fly," an example of hybrid speciation.

Methods
All stages except egg and first instar larvae were included
in our libraries. We collected 2nd and 3rd instar larvae
infested apples from a fallow orchard in Urbana, IL during
summer 2007 by dissecting them from apples, washing in
water, and freezing at -80°C. We reared pupae from
infested hawthorn fruit collected from trees in South
Bend, IN, in fall 2006. Some pupae were transferred to
4°C after a prediapause period of two weeks and kept
under diapause conditions for 4 months, while a second
set of pupae was kept at 25°C until eclosion. Pupae were
frozen from each set at regular intervals. After removal
from diapause additional pupae from the first set were
reared at 25°C to provide hawthorn race adults. This stratified sampling plan allowed us to collect a variety of developmental stages including prewinter diapausing pupae,
postwinter diapausing pupae, and multiple points of pharate adult development [54] and post eclosion adult maturation. Apple host race adults were caught on fruit in a
fallow apple orchard in Urbana, IL, in the summer of
2007. Adult heads were separated from the rest of the
body, with the goal of increasing representation of olfactory transcripts, and heads and bodies were used to construct separate libraries. For numbers of flies representing
each stage/body part/host race in our libraries and how
they were spread across sequencing runs see Table 1.
We used a two-step RNA extraction procedure beginning
with an initial TRIZOL (Invitrogen) extraction, followed
by further purification on the filter-based RNeasy (Qiagen) kit. Beginning the extraction with TRIZOL extraction
maximizes clean yields from fatty tissues, particularly in
larvae and pupae, and the filter-based RNeasy kit eliminated the genomic DNA and body pigments typically left
behind by TRIZOL extraction. Total RNA extractions were
pooled into four samples representing 1) larvae, 2) pupae,
3) adult bodies minus heads, and 4) adult heads. The Oligotex Mini Kit (Qiagen) was then used to purify mRNA
from each of the four total RNA pools. cDNAs were synthesized from 500 ng of mRNA following the Clontech's
Creator SMART cDNA synthesis system using modified
Oligo-dT and 5' RACE primers. Primer sequences were:

Separate normalization of each of the four stage-specific
cDNA libraries and 454 pyrosequencing were carried out
at the W.M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional
Genomics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center. For normalization,
300 ng of cDNAs were denatured, allowed to self-anneal,
DSN treated (Duplex/double stranded specific Nuclease;
Evrogen, Russia), and remaining transcripts were PCR
amplified to make normalized ds-cDNAs. Titration runs
were performed for each of the four libraries on 1/16th
region of a 70 × 75 PicoTiterPlate (PTP), and subsequent
bulk runs were split between two 1/4th regions respectively to spread each bulk run across at least two plates
(Additional file 1).
Sequence assembly was performed using the Newbler
Assembler with sequences masked for oligonucleotide
adaptors used in SMART cDNA synthesis and normalization. All contigs and singlets were annotated by BLAST
search against both the Drosophila melanogaster nonredundant protein database where the e-value threshold
was set at 1e-5 for confident annotation. Gene Ontology
(GO) assignments were also assigned based on sequence
similarity to D. melanogaster and transcripts with GO
assignments were collapsed down into 14 major GO categories under the Biological Process category.
To specifically search for transcripts associated with olfaction, and therefore possibly host fruit choice, we searched

our contigs and long (>100 bp) singleton sequences with
complete sets of D. melanogaster odorant receptors (ORs),
gustatory receptors (GRs), and odorant binding proteins
(OBPs), and recorded all hits to all of these receptors, even
in cases of relatively large e-values. We then evaluated all
hits manually for the presence of characteristic conserved
amino acids, transmembrane domains, and other features
of olfactory and gustatory receptors. We similarly searched
for several other transcripts from Drosphila or moth species that have been implicated in peripheral chemoreception (K. Wanner, personal communication). The
regulation of diapause is much less well understood, but
we compiled and searched our data for a set of candidate
transcripts identified by Denlinger et al. [18] and Hahn et
al. [36]. We further searched for transcripts classified as
being involved in either "circadian rhythm" or "eclosion
rhythm" in the GO matches above, yielding a set of 92
total candidate transcripts for diapause. EST sequences
matching a gene from these transcripts of interest were
aligned (BLASTX) against the NCBI NR protein data set to
verify best match to our EST. This methodology does not
ensure that the gene of interest and the Rhagoletis EST are
orthologs or even fulfil the same function, but does provide a first hypothesis for future functional studies.
Because multiple individuals from different populations
were combined for the pyrosequencing run we can identify putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation within and between sequencing runs. To
accomplish this we re-assembled reads in MOSAIK http:/
/bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/Mosaik using the Newbler-assembled contigs as anchors. Newbler assembly
notation codes putative SNPs with flanking insertion

characters (presumably to reflect uncertainty in indel
errors), whereas most reference-guided assemblies provide a direct alignment at polymorphic positions that are
easily recognized by SNP-finding packages. We used GigaBayes
http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/Giga
Bayes[55,56] to estimate the (Bayesian) posterior probability that a given variable site in the re-assembly represents a true polymorphism, setting the threshold
probability at 90%.
Because pupae and larvae were run separately and represent pools from hawthorn and apple populations, respectively, we were also able to identify putative host-specific
allelic variation in SNPs. We calculated Pearson χ2 statistics for a host race by allele contingency table at each SNP
locus, and we report host specific alleles as those with χ21
values exceeding p = 0.01. This test is not strictly applied
because multiple reads could have come from the same
individual, resulting in a non-representative population
sample. However, the procedure provides a useful metric
to identify candidates for future confirmation/characterization. In addition, we established reading frames from
local BLASTX alignments [37] using the methods of Hahn
et al. [36] to compensate for 454 under/overcall errors.
From these alignments we determined whether each SNP
putatively segregating between host races is synonymous
or nonsynonymous. We performed conservative formal
searches for microsatellite motifs within our sequences
using the program MSATCOMMANDER [50] to identify
sequences containing di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats with a minimum length of 7.
To determine whether stage specific expression can still be
detected in normalized libraries, we focused on subsets of
contigs annotated as larval cuticle or digestive transcripts,
both of which are, in other species, expressed only in larvae [52,53]. We considered only contigs with ≥ 20 reads
in order to examine whether we would be able to detect
strongly skewed contributions of larvae or pupae to a
given contig.
Although any EST project is unlikely to represent all of a
species' transcriptome, EST data can provide important
first pass on transcript gain or loss among taxa. We used
information from previous analyses that identified groups
of orthologous genes (ortholog groups) by comparing
completed genomes using Smith-Waterman sequence
comparisons. The results from these analyses are available
in an online data base (orthoDB) that allows searching for
ortholog groups according to level of conservation in different taxonomic groups [57]. To test for ortholog groups
that were lost in Drosophila but potentially retained in
Rhagoletis, we compiled a list of loci that had a single copy
in Apis, Tribolium, Bombyx, Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex, but
were not found in any of the 12 annotated Drosophila
genomes (n = 66 ortholog groups). To identify genes that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/633

are unique to both Rhagoletis and Drosophila we limited
our search to genes that had at least one copy in each of
the 12 Drosophila species but were absent in non-drosophilid genomes (n = 850 ortholog groups). All nucleotide sequences from these ortholog groups were blasted
against our set of Rhagoletis contigs using the tBLASTn
algorithm. Translated amino acid sequences of contigs
that had a blast match with an expected value < = e-30 to
one or more translated sequences from a particular
ortholog groups were aligned with all the translated
amino acid sequences from that group with ClustalW.
These alignments were imported into the MEGA software,
which allowed for Genbank searches of the contig using
the BLASTp algorithm (local alignment of protein
sequences) against the non-redundant protein database
(NCBI-NR). We displayed all results of these BLAST
searches using the web-BLAST's built-in construction of
neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees. If this first screening supported the respective hypothesis of gene loss or
gain, then the top BLAST hits down to suitable outgroups
were imported into MEGA and aligned with the Rhagoletis
contig and ortholog group sequences using ClustalW. We
trimmed the alignment to match the aligned length of the
Rhagoletis sequences and constructed phylogenetic trees
(neighbour-joining, 1000 bootstrap intervals). In order to
infer the presence of a gene in Rhagoletis that is absent in
Drosophila we required that the translated Rhagoletis
sequence formed a well-supported clade with outgroup
species genes (bootstrap values > 70) that did not include
any Drosophila copies. To infer that a gene was novel to
both Rhagoletis and Drosophila, it had to 1) form a well
supported clade (bootstrap value > 70) with its closest
Drosophila relative that lacked any non-drosophilid genes
and 2) form a separate sister clade to a related sister clade
composed of Rhagoletis and Drosophila genes. Our detection scheme was conservative because it ignored cases in
which there was no evidence for an ancestral gene in the
Schizophora [58,59]. However, it avoided the quandary
of having to decide at which point along a single evolutionary branch a sequence represented a new gene. The
only exception for this rule was made in cases when no
insect matches other than Drosophila could be obtained
from Genbank. In this case the gene in question was classified as novel to the Schizophora.

we determined whether SNPs would affect the amino acid sequence of the
protein product. Contig is the R. pomonella contig number followed by the
TSA accession number. CG is the D. melanogaster Celera Genome
number of the locus with the closest match and Annotation is the D. melanogaster locus name where known. Position denotes the nucleotide location within the contig and synonymous? denotes whether the alternative
forms of the SNP specify alternative amino acids. We also define the consensus amino acid, the alternative amino acid, the consensus codon and
whether the SNP site is within the local BLAST alignment of our data
with the hit to the identified D. melanogaster locus.
