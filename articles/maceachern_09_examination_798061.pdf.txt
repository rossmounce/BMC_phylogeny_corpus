Abstract
Background: Identifying recent positive selection signatures in domesticated animals could provide
information on genome response to strong directional selection from domestication and artificial
selection. With the completion of the cattle genome, private companies are now providing large numbers
of polymorphic markers for probing variation in domestic cattle (Bos taurus). We analysed over 7,500
polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in beef (Angus) and dairy (Holstein) cattle and
outgroup species Bison, Yak and Banteng in an indirect test of inbreeding and positive selection in
Domestic cattle.
Results: Outgroup species: Bison, Yak and Banteng, were genotyped with high levels of success (90%) and
used to determine ancestral and derived allele states in domestic cattle. Frequency spectrums of the
derived alleles in Angus and Holstein were examined using Fay and Wu's H test. Significant divergences
from the predicted frequency spectrums expected under neutrality were identified. This appeared to be
the result of combined influences of positive selection, inbreeding and ascertainment bias for moderately
frequent SNP. Approximately 10% of all polymorphisms identified as segregating in B. taurus were also
segregating in Bison, Yak or Banteng; highlighting a large number of polymorphisms that are ancient in
origin.
Conclusion: These results suggest that a large effective population size (Ne) of approximately 90,000 or
more existed in B. taurus since they shared a common ancestor with Bison, Yak and Banteng ~1–2 million
years ago (MYA). More recently Ne decreased sharply probably associated with domestication. This may
partially explain the paradox of high levels of polymorphism in Domestic cattle and the relatively small
recent Ne in this species. The period of inbreeding caused Fay and Wu's H statistic to depart from its
expectation under neutrality mimicking the effect of selection. However, there was also evidence for
selection, because high frequency derived alleles tended to cluster near each other on the genome.

Background
Identifying positive genomic selection in domestic animals is a major challenge in contemporary agricultural
research. To date only a small number of examples have
successfully identified genomic regions subject to positive
selection in domestic animals [1-10]. Increasing the
understanding of positive selection and how it shapes
genetic variation in domestic animals has the potential to
provide powerful insights into the mechanisms involved
in evolution, help target loci for selection and possibly
highlight the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity for
complex traits [5,11]. Domestic animals provide a unique
opportunity to detect positive selection due to their extensive diversity amongst breeds, increasing availability of
sequence data and large databases of polymorphisms that
are accruing in domestic species like Bos taurus.
Data on polymorphisms can provide evidence of selection
if the patterns in the data are incompatible with a neutral
model [12]. For instance, the neutral model with constant
effective population size predicts that most polymorphisms will have one common allele and one rare allele.
More specifically, if p is the frequency of one of the two
alleles chosen at random and f(p) is the distribution or
spectrum of all polymorphisms where one allele has frequency p, then f(p) = k/(p(1-p)) where k is a constant.
Tajima's D statistic [13] measures the extent to which real
data differs from this theoretical expectation. Tajima [13]
suggests that changes in the frequency spectrum of neutral
polymorphic alleles can be used to detect a hitchhiking
effect due to the spread of linked advantageous mutations. Therefore, high values of D indicate that common
polymorphisms are more frequent than expected from the
neutral theory and this is a result of genetic hitchhiking.
However, polymorphisms are discovered by methods that
tend to find common variants and this ascertainment bias
can also generate an excess of polymorphisms with intermediate allele frequency.
The test for departure from expectation can be made more
powerful if it is possible to distinguish the ancestral allele
from the derived or mutant allele at each locus. If p is the
frequency of the derived allele, then the distribution of all
derived alleles is f(p) = k/p. Fay and Wu measure departure from this expectation with their H statistic [14]. If
derived alleles are found at high frequency more often
than expected, then H will be positive. They suggest that
selection causes a positive H statistic, because selection
sometimes drives the derived allele to high frequency.
This can occur if the polymorphisms observed are subject
to selection themselves, but can also occur at neutral loci
as a result of hitchhiking caused by selection acting on
linked loci. This makes H a very useful test for selection
because most polymorphisms are discovered randomly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/181

and few of them are likely to be directly subject to selection.
Unfortunately, both D and H can depart from expectation
for reasons other than selection [13,15-17]. The way in
which polymorphisms are discovered usually means that
low frequency polymorphisms are less likely to be discovered than one with alleles at intermediate frequency. D
and H are also affected by changing effective population
size (Ne). If Ne declines, polymorphisms with one rare
allele become less frequent and the frequency spectrum
becomes flatter. In this way a decline in Ne (i.e. inbreeding) can mimic selection [16-18]. Therefore, detecting
unambiguous examples of positive selection has been difficult due the difficulty of many methods to differentiate
between positive selection and demographic history. This
is of particular concern in domestic species where SNP discovery typically involves some ascertainment bias and
demographic fluctuations coupled with strong directional
(artificial) selection, which have played important roles in
the formation of domestic breeds [19].
The problem of ascertainment bias will result in an
observed allele frequency spectrum that is more flat than
that predicted by theory. However, it is possible to construct a test that is not affected by this ascertainment bias
if derived and ancestral alleles can be distinguished. Since
f(p) = k/p for derived alleles with frequency p [14], the frequency spectrum for all ancestral alleles with frequency 1p is f(1-p). The spectrum for all alleles with derived or
ancestral allele frequencies p or 1-p is then f(p) + f(1-p),
which is equal to f(p(1-p)), see above. So neutrality predicts that the proportion of these alleles where the ancestral allele is p is f(1-p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)], which is equal to p.
Assuming that the polymorphism discovery method cannot distinguish ancestral and derived alleles, this expectation for different p intervals is not affected by the
ascertainment bias. It has only been tested for p from 0 to
0.5, since the value of any f(1-p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)] is 1-(value
at 1-p). Also, because selection does not typically affect all
parts of the genome equally, selection and demographic
phenomena can be compared. For instance, a selected
allele can drag derived alleles that are closely linked to
high frequencies by hitchhiking. Therefore, selection
should cause an autocorrelation of high frequency derived
alleles between one locus and the next on the chromosome. To test if the observed autocorrelation could be due
to inbreeding, we have used a simulation study to demonstrate the effect of inbreeding in the absence of selection
and compared the results with those found in real data.
Recently it has become possible to assay large numbers of
polymorphisms in cattle and this offers a new source of
data with which to detect evidence of selection. In this
paper we use data from two breeds of cattle (Angus and

Holstein) each genotyped for over 7,500 SNPs using the
Parallele/Affymetrix platform. By also genotyping these
SNPs on 3 species related to Bos taurus (Bison, Yak and
Banteng) we have been able to distinguish the derived and
ancestral allele at each locus and use this information to
test for deviations from neutrality.
The comparison between the allele frequencies in the
Angus and Holstein breeds might also contain evidence of
selection since they have been selected for different traits.
However, their allele frequencies also differ due to genetic
drift caused by finite population size or inbreeding. The
difference in allele frequencies can be quantified by the
statistic Fst. Inbreeding should affect all loci equally and
genetic drift should affect loci randomly and not show
any linkage disequilibrium between adjacent loci, but we
hypothesise that selection will drive linked derived alleles
to high frequency in one breed but not the other. Therefore selection should cause higher values of Fst among
loci where the derived allele is common than when the
ancestral allele is common. We examine how Fst between
Angus and Holstein changes with allele frequency and
compare the result to that obtained with the simulated
data.

Results
Amplification of B. taurus designed markers in wild
relatives
Approximately 383 Holstein, 379 Angus and one of the
outgroup species each (Banteng, Yak, and Bison) were
genotyped for over 9,000 SNP. In total 7,611 amplified in
both breeds of B. taurus and at least one of the outgroup
species. Of these 6,718 and 7,215 SNP were found to be
segregating in Angus and Holstein, respectively. The
remaining assays were fixed for the derived or ancestral
alleles (table 1).

Table 2 summarises the proportion of successful assays in
the outgroup species sampled from 9,323 SNP genotyped
in Angus. On average very high rates of successful assays
were found in the majority of wild species. Similar results
have been found for the successful amplification of SNP
markers as for successful amplification of exons from
primers designed from the flanking 5- and 3- prime
regions of each exon [20]. From the 8,677 loci that amplified in the wild species 7,611 could be used to identify the

Fay and Wu's H test
In table 3 a summary of Fay and Wu's H statistic is presented for a survey of 7, 611 SNP in Holstein and Angus
cattle. In both Angus and Holstein populations H values
are considerably larger than 0 (p < 0.001, one sided). A
comparison of H values between Holstein and Angus
identified a significantly larger value for H in Angus cattle
(p < 0.001). This indicates that derived alleles occur at a
higher frequency than expected under the neutral model,
especially in Angus.
Frequency spectrum of derived and ancient alleles
The frequency spectrum of derived variants f(p) alongside
the expected frequency spectrum e(p) under neutrality,
which is calculated as k/p where k = the value calculated
from the sum of all f(p) so the theoretical and actual
curves match as close as possible for Holstein and Angus
cattle, is presented in figure 1A, B. In general both breeds
show a flat distribution for the spectrum of derived alleles.
Both Holstein and Angus show a deficiency of derived
alleles at low frequency, especially in Holstein. However,
at high frequencies there may be an increase in the abundance of derived alleles, especially in Angus cattle.

To avoid ascertainment bias, we have plotted f(1-p)/
[f(p)+f(1-p)] against its expectation under the neutral
model in figures 2A and 2B. Under a neutral model with
constant Ne, the expectation of this statistic is simply p.
The figures show that the derived alleles are more common than expected. For instance, in figure 2A when the
minor allele frequency is 0.1, we expect that in 0.1 of the
loci the common allele is the derived allele, but we
observe this in 0.27 of the loci. In Holstein and especially
Angus, derived alleles are more common than expected.

Genomic distribution of high frequency derived
polymorphisms
The frequency spectrum of derived alleles appears to follow a pattern contrary to that expected under neutrality, as
there are too many derived mutations with relatively high
frequency. If these mutations are clustered in certain areas
of the genome, this may be evidence of positive selection
driving these alleles to high frequencies. Alternatively if
they are distributed randomly throughout the genome,
this may be a result of inbreeding randomly increasing the
frequency of some derived (new) mutations.

The distribution across the genome of high frequency
derived alleles in Angus and Holstein was compared to
that in two simulated populations devoid of positive

selection to determine if the pattern observed in Angus
and Holstein could be due to changing Ne or whether it is
indicative of selection. Table 4 summarises the results of
an analysis using autocorrelation between adjacent and
derived polymorphisms per chromosome for both B. taurus and simulated populations. Positive correlations were
detected in the B. taurus breeds, while the autocorrelation
in the simulated data did not differ significantly from
zero. A t-test indicated that on average the positive correlations found in Holstein and Angus were significantly
larger than zero, while those in the simulated populations
were not (α = 0.05, two sided). Thus, high frequency
derived alleles seem to be clustered in the genome, especially in Holstein.

In order to visually summarise the data presented in table
4 we plotted the derived allele frequency against genomic
position over the entire genome, we also contrasted this
with Fst at the same positions. Due to the volume of information, these plots have been included as supplementary
figures 1–30 A and B for all Holstein and Angus chromosomes (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29 and 30). In general if we just examine the
derived allele frequency some grouping of derived alleles
at high frequencies can be found throughout the genome.
The largest autocorrelations were found on chromosomes
2 and 13 in Holstein and Angus (Table 4, Additional files
2 and 13). This could be due to positive selection independently increasing the frequency of derived polymorphisms in both breeds, or more likely it could be due to

selection acting in the common ancestor of Holstein and
Angus. For chromosomes 25, 26 and 29 high autocorrelations in one breed and not the other where identified,
which may be evidence of breed specific selection (Table
4, Additional files 25, 26 and 29). Also, lack of any significant correlation in the simulated populations in table 4
suggests that inbreeding cannot solely create this clustering of high frequency derived alleles.
Phylogenetic analysis and the frequency of derived alleles
in Holstein and Angus
We used a neutral phylogenetic tree to overlay the average
frequency of derived alleles between Angus and Holstein
cattle (data not shown). At the 7,611 polymorphic sites
analysed, the Holstein breed had a higher average derived
allele frequency (0.362) when compared to Angus

(0.359), which is similar to the finding we observed in
Table 4. However, the difference between breeds was not
significant.
Average Fst and derived allele distributions
Fst between Holstein and Angus was 0.07 and between
the two simulated populations was 0.09. In figure 3 Fst is
calculated for specific ranges of derived allele frequencies
(0–1.0). For both the simulated and real populations, Fst
is highest when the average allele frequency is 0.4 or 0.5,
which is a feature of the formula for Fst. We hypothesised
that selection would create higher Fst values when the
derived allele was frequent than when it was rare, but
there is no evidence for such a trend when the real populations are compared to the simulated populations. In
general higher Fst detected between simulated populations than between B. taurus breeds probably reflects the
simulation and an over estimate of the effect of inbreeding in the theoretical populations. However, the differences between the frequency spectrums are small.

The distribution of derived allele frequencies and Fst are
quite different analyses of the polymorphism data. Given
that a number of chromosomes in table 4 have shown different degrees of clustering for high frequency derived
alleles. We plotted the genomic distribution of Fst and the
derived allele frequency (p) per chromosome to see if any
genomic regions were outliers for both (see Additional
files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30). Overall
the majority of chromosomes in additional files 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 show genomic regions
where there are outliers for high Fst and derived allele frequency. In particular, one region on chromosomes 8, 20
and 24 (Figure 4A–F) stands out in Angus between base
pairs 61,300,000–62,500,000, 3,210,000–3,400,000 and
21,600,000–22,200,000, respectively. At these regions of
the genome show derived alleles in Angus that have been
driven to a frequency of 0.7–1.0, while in Holstein they
range from 0.1–0.6. This difference in derived allele fre-

quencies has been responsible for an inflated Fst value
(0.2–0.6), when compared to the average between breeds
(0.07). An examination of these regions identifies no particular candidates of positive selection, except for some
unknown genes and FGF1 (fibroblast growth factor1) on
chromosome 20. However all of these chromosomal
regions show evidence of QTL affecting body composition
(Bta 8, Bta 24) and carcass yield (Bta 20) [21,22]. QTL resolution remains coarse for these regions, as the cattle
genome becomes more completely annotated these
regions may identify useful targets of selection.
Frequency spectrum of ancient polymorphisms in B.
taurus
In total the 8,677 SNP markers in Angus that successfully
genotyped in at least one of the wild species were examined for evidence of ancestral polymorphisms. Of these,
we identified 931 (10.7%) that appear to be ancestral in
origin, in that the three groups were not fixed for a single
allele (see Methods).

In figures 5A and 5B the frequency spectrum of ancestral
polymorphisms along with the expected distribution in
Holstein and Angus are presented, respectively. The
derived and ancestral alleles could not be determined for

these polymorphisms, because the SNPs are segregating in
the wild relatives. Therefore an allele was chosen at random and its allele frequency was used in figure 5. In both
breeds the frequency spectrum of ancestral polymorphisms is generally flat. However, there is an excess of rare
(< 0.02) and most common (> 0.98) classes of alleles,
some of which may be typing errors.
Ancestral polymorphism and effective population size
The 931 ancestral polymorphisms found in B. taurus suggest that despite any recent bottlenecks in B. taurus that
occurred during the domestication process, very large
populations must have been maintained in the ancestral
Auroch (B. taurus primigenius) population prior to its
domestication some 10,000 years ago [23-25]. Thus, 931/
8,677 = 0.11 of SNP in B. taurus have remained polymorphic for over ~2 million years.

Hence, if the fixation of neutral alleles is typically governed by chance, the probability of fixation per generation
after equilibrium is reached is

(1 /(2N e ))

and the probability of no fixation over t generations is

For the purpose of estimating the effective population size
of the ancestral species it was assumed that the number of
polymorphisms was similar between ancestral and contemporary populations. The divergence times estimated
by MacEachern et al [20] were used to calculate the average divergence time for Bison, Yak and Banteng, which
was approximately 2.1 MYA. If the average generation
time for these animals is 5 years, t should be roughly 4.2
× 105 generations. Thus, for equation 2, setting e-t/2Ne =
0.11, gives an effective population size of ~90,000 animals, and of course the actual number of animals would

have been some degree larger than this. It is important to
note that this estimate is affected by our estimate of generation time, which may have been greater than 5 years.
However, the rate of fixation in domestic cattle most likely
increased with decreasing population size and therefore
our estimate should be a good approximation.
Ancestral alleles and phylogenetic relationships in closely
related bovids
From the 8,677 SNPs assayed in at least one wild relative,
931 loci could not have an ancestral allele determined as
both alleles were found to be present in at least one of the
three closely related species. From these 931 SNPs the
number of cases where both B. taurus alleles are detected

in one of the three related species is summarised in table
5. MacEachern et al. [20] concluded that the Yak appeared
to share more alleles with B. taurus than Bison, although
this difference was not significant using a t-test (α = 0.05,
one sided). In the present study Banteng was found to
show roughly double the number of mutations in common with B. taurus than Bison or Yak and was significantly more similar to B. taurus than the other two species
(α = 0.05, one sided). However, our Banteng samples
were sourced from the Taronga Western Plains Zoo in
Australia and there was no guarantee that this animal had
no B. taurus ancestors. The possibility that the Banteng has
been crossbred may potentially affect the estimates of Ne,
as some of the 931 alleles originally thought to be ancestral polymorphisms could be the result of recent introgression. However, this should only affect a small percentage
of the 931 SNPs and therefore not have a large impact on
the estimate of Ne. Although without 100% surety of the
genetic purity of our wild relatives some caution may be
needed for the interpretation of our findings
Heterozygosity
As only one animal was sampled for each wild species
their heterozygosity was estimated as the proportion of
heterozygotes from the total number of SNPs that successfully amplified in each animal. Table 6 summarises the
number of heterozygotes detected from the number of
successful assays and the average heterozygosity for each

Discussion
Genotyping and wild specimens
We have found that a high proportion (~0.9) of SNP
markers, designed from the B. taurus genome, were successfully assayed in a number of wild relatives from the
Bovina subtribe, which diverged from B. taurus between
1–2 MYA, while no successful genotypes were recorded
from the Bubalina subtribe, which diverged some < 9
MYA. It is unclear whether the lack of amplification in the
Bubalina was the result of low selective constraint over
SNP, or if there was a problem with DNA. However, a
recent study by Gautier et al. [19] identified a high rate of
successful SNP assays in goat (Capra hircus), which
diverged at least 15 MYA from cattle. Thus members of the
Bovina subtribe should be suitable outgroups for SNP
genotyping studies in B. taurus.
Genome wide polymorphism scans reveal a deviation from
neutrality in two breeds of B. taurus
Researchers utilising the bovine genome have uncovered
large number of SNPs, which has presented researchers
the opportunity to examine patterns of DNA sequence
variation for indirect evidence of positive selection by cataloguing levels of genetic hitchhiking. To this end, we
analysed over 7,500 SNP spaced throughout the genome
of Holstein and Angus cattle (B. taurus). We identified significantly large deviations from neutrality in each B. taurus
population using the H statistic developed by Fay and Wu
[14], which may result from either recent positive selection, ascertainment bias or inbreeding.

Scans examining the frequency distribution of polymorphisms for deviations from neutral expectations often run
into difficulty when trying to differentiate between the
effects of positive selection and demographics. This is
because the null hypotheses used to test for significance
unrealistically assumes that the demographic history of
the sample population was a random mating population
with an unchanged Ne [16,26]. Ascertainment bias for
common alleles can also affect scans for positive selection
from polymorphism data, which may mimic the results
expected for positive selection or those produced from
demographic processes such as inbreeding. The ~10,000
SNPs that were provided as part of the genotyping platform by Parallele Bio Sciences were discovered using the
cattle genome project, based on sequences from only one
or a few animals (information regarding their discovery is
at
ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/Btaurus/snp/
Btau20040927/bovine-snp.txt). The small numbers of
animals sampled during SNP discovery would suggest
that there is some ascertainment bias. Hence, inferences of

positive selection from tests that come directly from allele
frequency distributions should be made with caution.
By examining several thousand loci it was possible to distinguish between the effects of population structure, positive selection and ascertainment bias on the frequency
spectrum of ancestral and derived alleles. As indicated by
the significant H test, the results detected an excess of high
frequency derived alleles in Holstein and Angus populations. The frequency spectrums in figure 1 are generally
too flat when compared to the distributions expected
under neutrality. The frequency distribution highlights a
number of discrepancies at medium frequencies (0.4–0.6)
for Angus and Holstein, which would be expected if there
was ascertainment bias towards common polymorphisms. However, a flat distribution was also found in figure 2 and this plot removes any effects from ascertainment
bias on the frequency distribution as the plot examines
the frequency of the derived allele compared to the ancestral allele, using the ratio f(1-p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)] and information regarding the derived and ancestral alleles are
irrelevant during the SNP discovery. Hence, the flat distribution witnessed in figure 2 indicates that derived alleles
occur at high frequency more often than expected and that
this was not due to any ascertainment bias. This new metric may be of use to researchers trying to identify selective
sweeps to datasets that are influenced by ascertainment
bias.
Reduced Ne or inbreeding could, however, cause the distribution observed in figure 2 because it leads to a random
dispersal of allele frequencies. We used a transition matrix
method to calculate the amount of inbreeding necessary
to generate an allele frequency spectrum that matched
that observed. This was done by starting with the allele frequency spectrum expected under the neutral model (ie
f(p) = k/p) and using a transition matrix which calculated
the spectrum one generation later assuming a population
of effective size Ne and no mutation. The matrix multiplication was repeated multiple times until the spectrum
matches the observed spectrum. We found that to replicate a frequency distribution similar to that displayed in
figure 1 would require enough generations to reach an
inbreeding coefficient of 0.5.

An example of the effect of genetic drift is shown by the
frequency spectrum of ancient polymorphisms presented
in figure 2, which shows a very flat distribution. This is
expected for very old polymorphisms. It is unlikely that
these polymorphisms have all been maintained due to
overdominance and so we assume that they have been
maintained in the historically large populations that once
existed in bovids. Slight peaks are witnessed at the
extremes of the distribution < 0.02 and > 0.98. Because all
fixed alleles with frequencies of 0 and 1.0 were removed
from the analysis, these may represent typing errors or be
evidence of alleles that have been positively selected
towards fixation.
Genomic distribution of high frequency derived alleles
The large number of high frequency derived alleles found
in Angus and Holstein populations are unexpected under
neutrality with constant Ne [14]. To distinguish between
the effects of positive selection and inbreeding on the frequency spectrum of derived mutants in B. taurus we examined the tendency of derived alleles to cluster together in
the genomes of Angus and Holstein populations using the
autocorrelation between frequencies of derived alleles. A
positive autocorrelation for derived allele frequencies
between neighbouring loci indicated that there is an association between high frequency derived alleles in the
genomes of both cattle breeds. This is consistent with positive selection and not changes in population size or ascertainment bias. A simulated population that had been
inbred to similar levels as contemporary populations,
without the influence of positive selection, failed to show
a similar autocorrelation between high frequency derived
alleles. Therefore, this suggests that hitchhiking events are
common throughout the genomes of both breeds of B.
taurus and this is consistent with positive selection for
some loci. If this is the case, it appears to have influenced
the Holstein genome more than the Angus genome. There
is a possibility that our findings are the result of sampling
error. However, as this study is based on a fairly large sample size in both breeds (n > 300) we believe the findings
are indicative of stronger artificial selection in the Holstein breed.
Fst distribution and inbreeding and selection in B. taurus
If different selection pressures operated in Holstein and
Angus, then different derived alleles might be driven to

Page 11 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:181

high frequency in the two breeds. This would cause Fst
between the breeds to be higher when the frequency of the
derived allele was high. We estimated Fst per locus and
plotted their average values against the average derived
allele frequency in B. taurus and in the simulated populations (Figure 3). Initial examinations of the frequency distribution of Fst between B. taurus breeds do not appear to
find any overwhelming signatures of positive selection as
the distribution of Fst is fairly symmetrical with respect to
allele frequency. Nor has examining Fst plots for the simulated and observed populations identified any convincing differences. However, plots of derived allele frequency
overlayed with Fst identified regions on chromosomes 8,
20 and 24 in Angus where large regions have had the
derived alleles driven to near fixation generating higher
Fst values for these regions than the overall average (Figure 4A–F). A quick examination of the genes underlying
these regions has not identified any remarkable candidates for positive selection, perhaps except for FGF1 in
beef cattle, but these regions are associated with QTL identified for body composition and carcass yield [21,22].
Hence, our results may be of future interest for identifying
signatures of recent positive artificial selection between
the two breeds or as additional evidence for any polymorphisms that show associations with beef or milk traits.
Ancestral polymorphisms
A recurring theme that appears when examining polymorphisms in B. taurus is the high proportion of polymorphisms that appear to be segregating in wild species. In
the phylogenetic analysis presented by MacEachern et al.
[20] a surprisingly large proportion (8.7%) of nucleotide
substitutions between species did not follow a simple tree
implying that these sites were polymorphic in an ancestral
species that had subsequently undergone lineage sorting
in the extant bovids. These ancestral polymorphisms were
found from sequencing a number of B. taurus breeds and
a subset of wild relatives from the Bovinae subfamily
without any knowledge about whether they were still segregating in B. taurus. In contrast, work completed in the
current study focuses on nucleotides that have been identified to be segregating in B. taurus. However, we have also
found a large proportion of B. taurus polymorphisms
(10.7%) to be segregating in the wild relatives. Despite the
difference in the method by which they were detected, the
possible explanations for them are similar. That is, they
must have arisen due to a double mutation, introgressive
hybridisation or alternatively they are due to the presence
of ancestral polymorphisms that are still segregating in B.
taurus. These loci may in fact still be segregating in the
wild relatives, even if they are not heterozygous in the
wild species sampled. Alternatively, they have undergone
lineage sorting and hence they appear to be alleles with
'abnormal' inheritance, as described in MacEachern et al.
[20,27]. Therefore, approximately 10% of all polymor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/181

phisms in the Bovinae are likely due to ancestral polymorphisms in the common ancestor of cattle and Bison/Yak/
Banteng.
MacEachern et al. [20,27] have suggested that the majority
of ancestral polymorphisms are neutral and thus their frequency is governed by random genetic drift, suggesting
they have persisted in the extant members of the Bovinae
due to chance. In the current paper the frequency spectrum of ancient polymorphisms presented in figure 4 is
largely flat for both populations of B. taurus, especially if
the extremes of the distribution are ignored because they
are most likely to represent typing errors. Thus the flat distributions in figure 4 suggest that the ancient polymorphisms are largely neutral. Hence, these sites should be
useful for determining the effective population size in
ancestral species, which we estimated to be approximately
90,000. This estimate of Ne can be quickly compared with
the heterozygosity expected in contemporary populations
of B. taurus as the heterozygosity expected is

He = 4N e μ

(3)

where μ = the mutation rate per generation. If the mammalian mutation rate is 2.2 × 10-9 per base per year as estimated by [28] this implies 1.1 × 10-8 mutations per base
per generation if the generation length is 5 years. Then
equation 3 gives He = 0.0035. MacEachern et al [25]
sequenced eight Holstein animals and the polymorphism
rate in noncoding DNA was estimated as 0.00373. We
have used a modification to equation 2 in Fay and Wu
[14] to convert this to an estimate of heterozygosity
within Holstein to compare this result with the estimated
heterozygosity from equation 3. Hence, Holstein heterozygosity was estimated as
n −1

He = dI /

∑i

1

(4)

i =1

where dI is the polymorphism rate at noncoding sites estimated from MacEachern et al. [20] and n = the number of
chromosomes sampled. This yields an estimate of heterozygosity in Holsteins equal to 0.0011, which is approximately 3 times less than what we expected from Ne =
90,000 (He = 0.0035). This difference could largely be the
result of the amount of inbreeding that has occurred in
contemporary populations of B. taurus or by error in the
estimate of μ.
Wild species heterozygosity and overall similarity to B. taurus
A number of the ancestral polymorphisms were examined
for the proportion of loci that were heterozygous in the
outgroup species and for their similarity to B. taurus.
MacEachern et al. [20] identified a large number of genetic
similarities between Yak and B. taurus. We have found that

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:181

Yak shares slightly more alleles with B. taurus than does
Bison, but the difference was not significant. Thus, there is
only weak evidence that Yak is more closely related to B.
taurus than is Bison. We have also found that Banteng
shared a larger number of alleles with B. taurus than Yak
or Bison, which is most likely a result of having a Banteng
animal with questionable ancestry, which may result in a
slight over estimation of the number of ancestral polymorphisms and hence of Ne. If the Banteng sample contained Bos taurus genes, it would inflate the number of
cases where Banteng was heterozygous for the Yak/Bison
allele and the B. taurus allele. Table 5 shows that this
occurred in only 88 cases out of 931 SNPs. Therefore, even
if this hybridisation had occurred, it would not affect the
conclusions greatly.
Examining the proportion of heterozygous loci in table 5,
Yak appears to be more heterozygous than Bison, which
may reflect past population bottlenecks in Bison [29,30].
Not surprisingly, Banteng was the most heterozygous of
all animals, and this might be expected if the Banteng has
a questionable background. Although we believe the Yak
and Bison samples used are genetically pure, without
100% certainty about the ancestry of our samples, some
caution may be needed with our interpretations that rely
on this aspect.

Conclusion
We have examined the frequency distribution of polymorphisms in milking and beef breeds of B. taurus using Fay
and Wu's H as a test to identify genomic positive selection.
Significant deviations from neutral expectations were
identified, which appears to be a combined effect of positive selection, inbreeding and ascertainment bias for common polymorphisms. By distinguishing derived from
ancestral alleles we were able to eliminate the effect of
ascertainment bias from our test for selection using a new
metric f(1-p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)] that is able to overcome many
of the problems associated ascertainment bias when
knowledge of the ancestral state is known. This metric
could potentially be useful for a number of studies that
rely on information from allele frequency distributions.
The high frequency of derived alleles we have identified
here could be caused either by selection or reduced Ne.
Reduction in Ne appears to have occurred because the
ancestral Ne predicts a higher herterozygosity than
observed. However, the tendency of high frequency,
derived alleles to cluster in certain parts of the genome is
evidence for positive selection because inbreeding alone
does not cause this autocorrelation.
By including a number of wild relatives in the analysis the
ancestral alleles were inferred. Surprisingly a high proportion of ancestral polymorphisms were identified suggesting that nearly 10% of all of the polymorphisms that are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/181

segregating in contemporary populations of B. taurus are
ancient in origin and must predate the divergence of
Bison, Yak, Banteng and the Domesticated cow. These
ancestral polymorphisms were therefore used to estimate
the ancestral population size of domesticated cattle over
the last 2 million years, which must have been at least
90,000. This estimate is roughly 9 times greater than the
estimate of the effective population size in humans, which
has been estimated as 10,000 [31].

Methods
Sample Animals
Two separate breeds of Bos taurus and a number of wild
relatives were analysed for genotypic polymorphisms
using a high-throughput, high-density SNP genotyping
platform. This platform is commercially available from
Parallele Biosciences, which was acquired by Affymetrix
https://www.affymetrix.com/corporate/parallele.affx. The
original progenitors of the Angus and Holstein breeds are
thought to be have existed for over two thousand years in
Scotland and Germany/North Holland, respectively.
However breed development did not occur until the early
to mid 1800's [32]. The breed histories are very similar in
that, during the past 50 years Angus and Holstein have
experienced dramatic increases in selection pressure for
beef and milk production, respectively and decreases in
effective population size to approximately 100 individuals each [33].

Angus animals were selected from Trangie Agricultural
Research Centre in NSW, Australia. All animals had information on sire and dam pedigree records, were born from
1993 to 2000 and had been selected for high or low postweaning feed efficiency (FE), or were part of a control
herd. Holstein animals were selected from a research
project based at Genetics Australia in Victoria, Australia.
All animals were bulls selected as semen donors for artificial selection, have information on pedigrees and have
been selected for high and low estimated breeding values
(EBVs) as determined by Australian Selection Index (ASI),
which is an economic index of milk, fat and protein yield
from bulls' daughters via progeny testing. Approximately
equal numbers of the extreme highest and lowest FE and
ASI animals were selected for SNP genotyping. A single
Yak (Bos grunniens), North American Bison (Bison bison),
Banteng (Bos javanicus) and Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were chosen as outgroup species and genotyped in an
effort to infer derived and ancestral alleles in both populations of B. taurus. Thus, there were 762 B. taurus animals
and 4 wild relatives genotyped for a number of SNP markers, using the Parallele™ technology.
Genotyping
For each of the 766 animals, DNA was extracted from
blood or semen and DNA samples were diluted to 30 ng/

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:181

ul. In Angus and the four wild species 9,323 SNPs, distributed across the bovine genome were genotyped at Parallele Bio Science Inc. There were slight differences in SNP
platforms as a result of Parallele Bio Sciences being taken
over by Affymetrix Inc., thus, a total of 9,919 SNP were
genotyped in Holstein. Only the polymorphisms genotyped on both breeds were compared.
Analysis
We used the Python programming language to parse data
files and extract genotypes for all animals at each locus
and calculate frequencies of derived and ancient alleles in
Angus and Holstein populations.
Ancestral and derived alleles
Ancestral alleles were determined using outgroup species.
For loci where only one allele was represented in the wild
relatives, that allele was determined as ancestral. Loci
where both alleles were represented among the outgroup
species were considered ancient polymorphisms that
must have arisen at least 2 MYA, before the separation of
the Bison, Yak, Banteng and B. taurus.
Genomic position of Parallele polymorphisms
The genomic position of all Parallele SNPs were determined by comparing the flanking sequence to the Bovine
genome (Btau_3.1) scaffolds using the BLAT algorithm
[34]. Results are presented in the genome browser of the
Interactive Bovine In Silico SNP (IBISS) database.
Computer simulations
A computer simulation was developed to determine the
probability that the observed differences in allele frequencies between breeds were due to finite Ne without selection. A diploid population, of Ne = 50,000 was simulated
with mutation and recombination until an equilibrium
was reached. Then Ne was reduced to 1,000, was simulated for 1,000 generations. In reality, estimated values of
Ne for early domestic B. taurus some 2,000 generations
ago was closer to 1,500 [35]. However, for computational
ease N = 1,000 and 1,000 generations was chosen. Each
individual in the population consisted of 29 pairs of chromosomes, and was either male or female (probability
0.5). Each chromosome was 100 cM long, and had 301
marker loci, which resulted in a similar number of polymorphisms to the real dataset. A pair of parents of different sex was randomly chosen from the population to
create each offspring. For each parent in a mating pair, a
gamete was formed from its chromosome pairs by sampling the number of crossovers for each chromosome pair
from a Poisson distribution, with mean of 1.0. Crossover
points were randomly positioned along chromosome
pairs. The haploid gametes were mutated at a rate of 5 ×
10-9 per locus per gamete per generation. If a locus was
mutated, a new allele was added.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/181

To model contemporary B. taurus breeds, the simulated
population was subdivided in two at generation 900, both
with Ne = 200. These populations were simulated without
inter mating for a further 100 generations, thus generating
an inbreeding coefficient (F = 1-(1-1/2Ne)g), where g =
generations, relative to generation 900 of F = 0.22. In generation 1000, the difference in allele frequency was calculated for each marker. The X chromosome was not
included in the simulation due to difficulties associated
with the difference in Ne for this chromosome.
Statistical analysis
We used the H statistic developed in Fay and Wu [14] as a
frequency based test of selection from species polymorphism. The H test examines the difference between two
estimates of the population genetic parameter θ, where Ne
is the effective population size (diploid) and μ is the
mutation rate per generation.

θ = 4N e μ

(5)

The first estimate θπ is typically based on the unbiased
heterozygosity in the sample [13,18]. While the second
estimate θH is based on the unbiased estimate of homozygosity of the derived allele in the sample [14]. However,
in the case where sample numbers are sufficiently large (ie
allele frequencies are based on a large number of chromosomes), it should be suitable to derive the H statistic using
the uncorrected average heterozygosity (θπ) where p and
1-p = the frequency of the derived and ancestral alleles,
respectively and NL = the number of loci.

θπ = Σ2p(1 − p) / N L

(6)

Likewise the uncorrected average homozygosity (θH)
should be suitable to estimate from the sample.

θ H = Σ2p 2 / N L

(7)

Testing the frequency distribution of B. taurus SNP against
those predicted under the neutral model was completed
using a paired t-test to determine whether the mean value
of θH was significantly larger than θπ. Traditionally significance tests were completed using null distributions generated from computer simulations. Given the large
number of loci used, the central limit theorem predicts
that the test statistic will be close to a t-distribution even
if the allele frequencies are not normally distributed.
Fay and Wu [14] originally modelled back mutations to
account for incorrect inferences of derived and ancestral
alleles. The presence of back mutations is dependent on
the mutation rate and the divergence time [16]. The close
relationship between B. taurus and the successfully amplified outgroup species should mean that double mutations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/181

were unlikely. Because the SNP assays are known to be
polymorphic in B. taurus, the probability of a double
mutation is simply the probability of a mutation at the
same base in the lineage leading to Banteng, Bison and
Yak. Therefore, the probability of a mutation occurring at
the same site is

(1 − (1 − u) t )

(8)

and the expected number of double mutations over n sites
is

n(1 − (1 − u) t )

known it should be possible to examine the frequency
spectrum of derived alleles devoid of any affects by ascertainment bias. The ratio f(1-p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)] should not
be affected by ascertainment bias because this ratio relies
on knowing the derived and ancestral allele and this information is irrelevant during SNP discovery. Therefore, f(1p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)] was compared with the theoretical spectrum value l(p), which under neutrality was simply the
proportion of derived alleles that were found to be the
most common allele, or alternatively, p against p. This can
be restated as: Because f(p) = k/p, f(1-p)/[f(p)+f(1-p)] = k/
(1-p)/[k/p + k/(1-p)] = p.

(9)

where u = mutation rate per year and t = generation time
in years. Therefore, if u is 2.2e-9 from the estimate of mammalian mutation rates by Subramanian and Kumar [36]
and t is the average divergence time for Bison, Yak and
Banteng, which is roughly 2.1 MY [20] then the probability for a double mutation between any of these two species and B. taurus is 0.005. Thus, for 7,500 bases we would
expect 37 such mutations. Hence, the inferred ancestral
allele should be correct over 97% of the time and are
therefore assumed to be correct.
The H statistics estimated for Angus and Holstein cattle
were tested for evidence of differences in the frequency
spectrum of derived alleles in the two populations using a
t-test. Differences in the H statistic between breeds may be
due to increased selective pressure or possibly indicate differences in population substructure.
Frequency spectrum, the genomic distribution of derived alleles and
distinguishing between the effects of positive selection, inbreeding
and ascertainment bias
Fay and Wu's H statistic makes predictions regarding the
frequency distribution of derived alleles under neutrality,
which can be affected by population substructure, ascertainment bias or positive selection. By cataloguing the variation expected and observed with the frequency spectrum
of derived alleles, inferences can be made regarding deviations from neutrality. Therefore, plots examining the
spectrum of the derived polymorphism f(p) against the
allele frequency (p) were compared with the theoretical
value of derived polymorphisms under neutrality e(p),
which is calculated as k/p and is modified from equation
4 in Fay and Wu [14], where k was chosen to match the
observed values of f(p) as closely as possible. By comparing the frequency of expected and observed values of f(p),
observations regarding positive selection and population
substructure can be made.

One drawback of using H is that ascertainment bias can
affect the frequency spectrum if there is a bias for common
alleles. However, because derived and ancestral alleles are

Due to the influence of demographics on Fay and Wu's H
statistic and the frequency spectrum of derived alleles, we
were interested in detecting whether positive selection
had driven the frequency of derived alleles in either breed
of B. taurus at specific regions of the genome. Therefore,
plots of derived allele frequency and the genomic position
were examined for clustering of high frequency derived
alleles. An autocorrelation of derived allele frequencies
between one locus and the next on the chromosome was
also completed. A positive autocorrelation should indicate that high frequency derived alleles are clustered on
the genome and this may be evidence of genetic hitchhiking. To test if the observed autocorrelation could be due to
inbreeding, we have examined the autocorrelation in
Angus and Holstein and the simulated populations,
which have been modelled to demonstrate the effect of
inbreeding in the absence of selection.
Ancestral polymorphisms and neutral evolution
The frequency distribution of ancestral polymorphisms
was examined. Ancestral polymorphisms are those that
have been found to be polymorphic in Domestic cattle
and also vary between the wild relatives (Bison, Yak and
Banteng), and hence no ancestral allele could be determined for these sites. The frequency distribution of allele
frequencies at these ancestral polymorphisms should follow a neutral model with a relatively flat distribution as
they would have been segregating for ~2 million years, or
since all species last shared a common ancestor. Thus the
J shaped curve expected for derived mutants is not
expected and a flat distribution is predicted under neutrality, as these polymorphisms are ancient with no influx of
new mutations. Therefore, plots examining the frequency
spectrum of ancestral alleles f(p) were compared with p
and the theoretical value a(p), which was simply the mean
value for f(p).
Differences between breeds in allele frequency
To determine if recent selection was responsible for the
differences in allele frequencies between Angus and Holstein plots of Fst and average allele frequency were derived
for Angus vs Holstein and the two simulated populations.

The fixation index (Fst) is an estimate of population differentiation based on genetic polymorphism data. Estimates of Fst were calculated using the relationship
between inbreeding and heterozygosity, which allows Fst
to be calculated from genetic markers using the following
equation modified from equation 13.7 in Frankham et al.
[37]

Fst = (Ht − Hs) / Ht

where Hs is the expected heterozygosity averaged across
all populations and Ht = the expected heterozygosity
expected for the total population. Thus, Fst must vary
from 0 to 1, which at the extremes represent fixation of
alleles in different populations. If derived alleles have
been fixed in one population and not in the other, as a
result of positive selection, one might expect reasonably
high values of Fst for alleles with extreme allele frequencies. Alternatively, if these alleles have drifted to fixation
the frequency distribution of Fst should be independent
of allele frequency.

Authors' contributions
SM collected and prepared outgroup species for genotyping, analysed the SNPs and prepared the manuscript for
submission. BH wrote the simulation for comparison
with the real population. JM and MG coordinated the
study and provided statistical and writing support. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
