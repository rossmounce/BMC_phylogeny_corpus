Abstract
Background: The rickettsial bacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium is the causative agent of heartwater, a potential
zoonotic disease of ruminants transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma. The disease is distributed in nearly all
of sub-Saharan Africa and some islands of the Caribbean, from where it threatens the American mainland. This
report describes the development of two different loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for
sensitive and specific detection of E. ruminantium.
Results: Two sets of LAMP primers were designed from the pCS20 and sodB genes. The detection limits for each
assay were 10 copies for pCS20 and 5 copies for sodB, which is at least 10 times higher than that of the
conventional pCS20 PCR assay. DNA amplification was completed within 60 min. The assays detected 16 different
isolates of E. ruminantium from geographically distinct countries as well as two attenuated vaccine isolates. No
cross-reaction was observed with genetically related Rickettsiales, including zoonotic Ehrlichia species from the USA.
LAMP detected more positive samples than conventional PCR but less than real-time PCR, when tested with field
samples collected in sub-Saharan countries.
Conclusions: Due to its simplicity and specificity, LAMP has the potential for use in resource-poor settings and
also for active screening of E. ruminantium in both heartwater-endemic areas and regions that are at risk of
contracting the disease.

Background
The rickettsial bacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium is a
causative agent of heartwater, the disease of ruminants
transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma [1].
Heartwater is not only responsible for high economic
losses in endemic countries [2], but is also suggested to
be a potential emerging zoonosis since the PCR and
sequence detection of the pathogen’s presence in three
fatal human cases although the cytological examination
and bacterial isolation were not achieved [3,4]. The disease is established in nearly all countries of sub-Saharan
Africa and some islands of the Caribbean, from where it
threatens the American mainland [5]. In the USA, three

Ehrlichia species, namely E. canis, E. chaffeensis, and E.
ewingii, are known to exist [6-11]. Recently, Panola
Mountain (PM) Ehrlichia, which is closely related to E.
ruminantium, was discovered as a novel zoonotic Ehrlichia in the state of Georgia [12,13]. Active surveillance
using a reliable method which can discriminate E. ruminantium from these other Ehrlichia species is an asset
in preventing introduction of heartwater into the USA.
In heartwater endemic countries, conventional diagnosis is based upon clinical signs and microscopic examination of post-mortem brain smears. As a more reliable
and sensitive diagnostic method, several PCR-based
assays have been developed for the detection of E. ruminantium, including conventional PCR [14-16], nested
PCR [17,18], and real-time PCR [19,20]. Among them,
the pCS20 real-time PCR TaqMan probe assay provides
the best sensitivity with a detection limit of one gene
copy per reaction, which is 100 times higher than that

of conventional pCS20 PCR [20]. However, this assay
was reported to cross-react with both E. chaffeensis and
E. canis [20]. Moreover, although this assay performs
well in the sensitive detection and quantification of
E. ruminantium, it is not readily transferable to lowtechnology settings where there is limited access to
expensive fluorescence detector based thermocyclers.
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay
is a rapid DNA amplification method originally developed by Notomi et al. [21], and it has been applied for
the detection of viral [22,23], bacterial [24,25], fungal
[26], and parasitic agents [27,28], but it has never previously been applied to rickettsial agents. The method
requires a specially designed primer set that recognizes at
least six independent regions of the target gene, which
increases the specificity as well as the rapidity of the reaction. LAMP results are visualized by turbidity that can be
seen by the naked eye [29], and optionally by agarose gel
electrophoresis or by addition of fluorescent dyes visualized under UV light [30,31]. Since the Bst DNA polymerase used in LAMP allows strand displacement-DNA
synthesis, LAMP reactions are performed under isothermal conditions using a simple incubator, such as a water
bath or heating block. Furthermore, LAMP reagents are
relatively stable for a month, even when stored at 37°C,
which is a warmer temperature than recommended by
the manufacturer [32]. With these advantages, LAMP has
the potential to be used even in clinical laboratories often
poorly equipped, facing problems of constant electricity
supply in tropical and sub-tropical countries where heartwater is endemic.
The purpose of the present study was to develop
LAMP assays for the detection of E. ruminantium and
to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of
these assays using a panel of bacterial DNA samples,
quantitated plasmid standards, and field samples derived
from both animal blood and ticks. The newly developed
LAMP assays successfully detected E. ruminantium with
rapidity, specificity, and high sensitivity.

Results
Optimization of LAMP

The reactions for both pCS20 and sodB LAMP were
performed under isothermal conditions at a range of 58
to 66°C using plasmid DNA (106 copies per reaction)
for 120 min, with monitoring of the turbidity. Although
amplifications with the LAMP assays were observed at
all temperatures tested, the reactions reached the
threshold value (0.1) with the shortest incubation times
at 61°C for pCS20 and 63°C for sodB (data not shown).
No nonspecific amplification was detected for the negative cell culture until after at least 120 min incubation.
Thus, subsequent LAMP reactions were conducted at
these temperatures for 60 min.

Sensitivity of LAMP assays

The sensitivities of pCS20 and sodB LAMP assays are
shown in Figure 1A, and 1B, respectively. A plot of the
threshold time versus the log of the initial template
copy number showed a linear regression, with statistically significant regression coefficients (R2 = 0.9725 for
pCS20 and 0.9473 for sodB LAMP). The detection limits
for these assays, using a positive turbidity signal as the
indicator, were 10 copies for pCS20 and 5 copies for
sodB LAMP. Alternative detection methods included
agarose gel electrophoresis of the LAMP products,
which displayed the typical ladder-like pattern (Figure
1C and 1D, upper panels), as well as the detection of
double stranded LAMP products using Gel-Red (Figure
1C and 1D, lower panels). With smaller amounts of
DNA in triplicate assays, 5 copies of pCS20 was amplified once, with a threshold time of 48.3 min, and 1 copy
of sodB was amplified twice with threshold times of 45.7
and 49.4 min.
Specificity of LAMP assays

The specificity of pCS20 and sodB LAMP assays was
evaluated by using the genomic DNA of 18 known
E. ruminantium isolates and five closely related species
of Anaplasmataceae: E. canis, E. chaffeensis, Anaplasma
centrale, A. marginale, and A. phagocytophilum. All isolates of E. ruminantium were positive in both LAMP
assays, the pCS20 real-time PCR and the pCS20 PCR;
whereas the pCS20 PCR was cross-reactive with both
E. canis and E. chaffeensis (Table 1).
Inhibitory effect of DNA preparation purified from bovine
blood or ticks

In order to access inhibitory effects of components present in field samples, mixtures of standard plasmid
DNA and DNA extracts from bovine blood and
Amblyomma variegatum were tested by the LAMP
assays. When DNA extracts from bovine blood were
added to the templates, both pCS20 and sodB LAMP
could not detect 10 copies in two samples, which is in
accordance with real-time PCR (Table 2). When DNA
extracts from A. variegatum were added to the templates, both pCS20 and sodB LAMP failed in detecting
10 copies in all five samples, while real-time PCR could
detect in four. The pCS20 PCR using the KAPA Blood
PCR kit detected more positives than the pCS20 PCR
using the AmpliTaq Gold PCR kit in the templates with
102 and 103 copies (Table 2).
Detection of E. ruminantium DNA in field samples

A total of 140 A. variegatum ticks were collected in 7
sites in Uganda and individually analyzed for the presence of E. ruminantium DNA. Out of 140 ticks,
including 96 males and 44 females, 12 ticks (11 male

and 1 female) were found positive with both pCS20
LAMP and sodB LAMP. The pCS20 real-time PCR
detected 13 positives, including the 12 LAMP-positive
ticks and an additional tick from Dokolo, while pCS20
PCR could detect only 8 positives (Table 3). All the
samples found positive with PCR were also positive
with LAMP. The percent positive with LAMP (8.57%)
was higher than with PCR (5.71%) but slightly lower
than with real-time PCR (9.29%). Of the 150 bovine,
35 goat, and 19 lamb blood samples analyzed, two

lamb samples were positive using PCR, real-time PCR,
and LAMP (Table 3).
Cross-reactivity of LAMP with zoonotic Ehrlichia in the
USA

LAMP assays were conducted with 17 Amblyomma
americanum DNA samples from the USA that had previously tested positive for E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, or
PM Ehrlichia (Table 4). Both of the genetic clades of
PM Ehrlichia that have been described were represented

Discussion
This report describes the development of two E. ruminantium-specific LAMP assays based on the pCS20 and
sodB genes. The pCS20 region was the first target used
for the genetic detection of E. ruminantium [33].

Subsequently, Peter et al. developed a PCR assay targeting pCS20 region with primers AB128 and AB129 for
sensitive and specific detection of E. ruminantium [14].
This assay was further evaluated for its reliability by the
same authors [15] and has been widely used by many
researchers [12,17,18,34]. Because primers AB128/129
could not amplify the divergent isolate of Kümm2, van
Heerden et al. designed primers HH1F and HH2R in a

highly conserved region of pCS20 [16]. However, the
major drawback of latter assay was cross-reactivity with
closely related bacteria such as E. canis and E. chaffeensis, which were not detected by former assay [14,15].
Although pCS20 real-time PCR was also reported to be
cross-reactive with E. canis and E. chaffeensis [20], our
study did not give the same results (Table 1). This
inconsistency may be explained by the differences of
sequence in pCS20 region between isolates as observed
in E. ruminantium [16]. Thus, in this study, we have
developed LAMP assays based on not only pCS20 but
also sodB because of its high degree of conservation
among isolates.
The pairwise sequence identities calculated for pCS20
showed that the lowest pairwise identity for pCS20
sequences was 83.95% (between Kümm1 and Kümm2
isolates), whereas that the lowest pairwise identity for
the more conserved sodB gene was 99.00% (between
Senegal and Kümm2 isolates) [35]. This implies that
sodB might be a more suitable target than pCS20 for
the genetic detection of this species. Compared to the
sequence of Welgevonden isolate, the Kümm2 differs by
24 out of 187 bp in the region targeted by the pCS20
LAMP, while there is no sequence difference in the
region targeted by sodB LAMP (Figure 2). Although
both pCS20 and sodB LAMP detected all the E. ruminantium isolates tested in the present study, sodB
LAMP is more likely to detect previously unknown,
divergent isolates of E. ruminantium. Thus, we concluded that sodB LAMP is more suitable for detecting
E. ruminantium and the diagnosis will be made more
reliable in combination with pCS20 LAMP.
The detection limits of the pCS20 and sodB LAMP
assays were 10 and 5 copies per reaction, respectively,
which are at least 10-times more sensitive than that of
conventional pCS20 PCR but slightly less sensitive than
pCS20 real-time PCR [20]. According to the instructions
for LAMP primer design software, the stability of primer
end, especially 5’ end of F1c/B1c and 3’ end of F2/B2 as
well as F3/B3, is one of the crucial factors for designing
proper LAMP primers http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/
lamp/primer.html. When LAMP primers were designed
for conserved pCS20 regions within isolates, only limited
number of primer candidates were obtained initially
(data not shown). Therefore, we had to change the optimal values of parameters in the software for further
designing pCS20 LAMP primers. In fact, an index for
stability of primer, the dG value of the 5’ end of the
pCS20 B1c region (-3.69 kcal/mol), is above the value
recommended by manufactures (< -4.00 kcal/mol),
which may explain lower sensitivities of pCS20 LAMP
than sodB LAMP.
As is documented in several reports [24,36], LAMP
showed relative tolerance to PCR inhibitors in blood,

Page 6 of 11

which was comparable to pCS20 real-time PCR (Table 2).
However, LAMP was clearly inhibited when DNA extracts
from A. variegatum were included in the reaction (Table
2). It is known that Amblyomma tick tissue contains PCRinhibitory elements which cannot be always removed during DNA purification [14,15]. Thus, LAMP is slightly less
sensitive in the presence of such inhibitors in ticks compared to real-time PCR. However, considering that realtime PCR is time-consuming and requires a thermal cycler
with real-time monitoring and data analysis systems,
which is expensive and can be relatively complicated to
use, LAMP has clear advantages over real-time PCR in
terms of a practical system in a standard diagnostic laboratory, especially those in developing countries where the
disease is prevalent.
In the present study, two sheep blood samples from a
heartwater-endemic area tested positive by LAMP
(Table 3). Domestic ruminants are known to occasionally harbor E. ruminantium without any clinical signs
and to serve as reservoirs of the disease after recovery
[37]. Previous reports demonstrated that PCR assays
could detect the pathogen in the peripheral blood of
clinically healthy animals in heartwater endemic areas
[20,38], indicating that a DNA-based technique is useful
even for the diagnosis of latent infection. Hence, LAMP
is a powerful tool not only for the epidemiological study
of heartwater but also for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of infected animals in the disease-endemic areas.
The simplest way of detecting LAMP products is to
inspect the white turbidity that results from magnesium
pyrophosphate accumulation, as a by-product of the
reaction, by naked eye [29]. However, a small amount of
this white precipitate is not always distinguishable from
other white precipitates, such as proteins or carbohydrates, derived from the templates. As an alternative
method, this study employed a closed system, coupled
with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding dye, for
low-cost detection of amplified DNA (Figure 1C and
1D, lower panels). The results obtained by this system
were consistent with those obtained by gel electrophoresis (Figure 1C and 1D, upper panels). Since the detection can be accomplished in a closed system, without
opening the reaction tubes, the risk of contamination is
much lower than in gel electrophoresis or by adding dye
at the end of the reaction. Theoretically, it should be
possible to replace the Gel-Red TM dye we used with
other dyes such as SYBR Green I [22,25,39], ethidium
bromide, EvaGreen [30], and PicoGreen [40], which are
reported to be useful for the detection of LAMP
products.
As well documented by Burridge et al., heartwater
may easily be introduced into the American mainland
through the introduction of infected ticks or animals
from heartwater endemic areas [5]. Once imported, it is

likely that the disease could become established because
of the presence of local potential tick vectors [5,41]. In
order to prevent this pathogen from spreading into the
USA, a screening test with high sensitivity and specificity is needed prior to the animal importation. In this
respect, the 17 DNA samples from A. americanum harboring DNA from Ehrlichia species that are enzootic to
the USA were found to be negative in LAMP. Considering that the detection limits of the PCR assay used for
the detection of Ehrlichia species in A. americanum
were 10 copies per reaction [42], which is comparable
to those of LAMP assays, these samples were LAMPnegative not because the DNA concentrations were
below the detection levels but probably because there
were no cross reactions due to sequence mismatches or
deletions in the targeted regions.

Conclusions
The LAMP assays developed in this study allow rapid,
sensitive, and specific detection of E. ruminantium.
Although LAMP reactions were inhibited in the presence of extracts from blood and ticks, the diagnostic
sensitivity of LAMP was higher than that of conventional PCR, when tested with field-collected ticks. Since
LAMP requires minimal time and equipment to perform, this technique can potentially be used in resourcepoor settings where heartwater is endemic. The lack of
cross-reactivity with closely related Ehrlichia species
enhances its utility for active screening in areas under
threat of the introduction of the disease.

endothelial (BAE) cells as described previously [44] and
subjected to DNA extraction. Cultures of closely related
rickettsia, including E. canis, E. chaffeensis, A. centrale,
A. marginale, and A. phagocytophilum, were also used
for LAMP specificity testing.
Field samples

From July 2008 to January 2009, adult A. variegatum
ticks were collected from indigenous cattle in seven districts in Uganda: Amuria, Butaleja, Dokolo, Kaberamaido, Pallisa, Soroti, and Tororo. Ticks were pooled
and stored in sealed plastic bags containing silica gel
until DNA extraction. Twenty ticks from each site were

randomly selected, and a total of 140 (96 males and
44 females) samples were used in the present study.
From July 2008 to May 2009, blood samples were collected from clinically healthy cattle or goats in four different sites in sub-Saharan countries. Bovine blood
samples were collected in Butaleja district in Uganda,
Serengeti district in Tanzania, and Petauke district in
Zambia. Goat blood samples were obtained from Chama
district in Zambia. The former two sites are endemic for
East Coast fever caused by Theileria parva, and the latter are endemic for trypanosomiosis. These areas are
habitats for Amblyomma ticks and lacked adequate tick
control programs. In total, 150 bovine blood samples, 50
from each site, and 35 goat blood samples were used in
the present study. In addition, this study employed
DNA samples extracted from the blood of lambs at Kerr
Seringe in the Gambia, where heartwater is endemic.
Nineteen samples were randomly selected from those
used in the previous study, some of which were positive
by pCS20 nested PCR [17]. As positive controls, four
blood samples obtained from two sheep experimentally
infected with E. ruminantium Senegal isolate were used.
Blood was collected from each sheep on days 14 and 16
post infections when the animals showed high fever.
Research on samples from animals was conducted
adhering to guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and was approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Utrecht University.
DNA extraction

DNAs from rickettsia-infected cell cultures were
extracted using Nucleospin Tissue kits (MachereyNagel, Duren, Germany). A. variegatum ticks were
washed with 70% ethanol and rinsed twice with distilled
water. Tick samples were then homogenized by Micro
Smash MS-100R (TOMY, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 min at
2,500 rpm, followed by DNA extraction with DNAzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DNAs from blood were
extracted using either the GenTLE kit (Takara, Shiga,
Japan) or a DNA isolation kit for mammalian blood
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). All procedures were carried out as described by the manufacturers.
LAMP primers

Two sets of LAMP primers were designed for the pCS20
and sodB genes of E. ruminantium. The nucleotide
sequence of the Welgevonden isolate of E. ruminantium
was retrieved from GenBank [GenBank:CR767821] and
aligned with the available sequences of other isolates to
identify conserved regions, using CLUSTALW software
version 1.83 (DNA Data Bank of Japan; http://clustalw.
ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html). A potential target region was
selected from the aligned sequences, and four primers,
comprising two outer (F3 and B3) and two inner (FIP

software PrimerExplorer V4 (http://primerexplorer.jp/
elamp4.0.0/index.html; Eiken Chemical Co., Japan).
Loop primers (LF and LB) were designed manually. The
designed primer sequences are shown in Table 5.
LAMP reactions

LAMP was carried out in a 25-μl volume reaction, consisting of 2.5-μl of 10× reaction buffer [200 mM Tris/HCl
(pH 8.8), 100 mM KCl, 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1% Tween
20], 3.5-μl 10 mM dNTPs, 4.0-μl 5 M betaine (Sigma, St
Louis, MI), 1.5-μl 100 mM MgSO4, 2.0-μl primer mixture
(20 μM each of FIP, BIP, LF, and LB primers, and 2.5 μM
each of F3 and B3 primers for the pCS20 LAMP; or 20
μM each of FIP, BIP, and LF primers, and 35 μM of LB
primers, and 2.5 μM each of F3 and B3 primers for the
sodB LAMP), 9.5-μl DDW, 1.0-μl (8 U) Bst DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and 1.0-μl
template DNA. To find the optimal reaction temperatures for the two LAMP assays, the reaction mixtures
were incubated for 120 min at 58 to 66°C in a Loopamp
real-time turbidimeter (LA-200; Teramecs, Kyoto, Japan).
For the field samples, LAMP reactions were conducted in
a heating block.

180

into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Each
plasmid clone was sequenced on an ABI Prism 3130
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
with BigDye Terminator version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems), to confirm identity, and was used as the standard
plasmid for determining the specificity of the respective
LAMP assay. The concentrations of plasmid DNA were
measured with a Quant-iT dsDNA BR and Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the corresponding copy numbers were calculated.
Assessment of LAMP inhibitors in DNA prepared from
blood or ticks

Five bovine blood samples and five individual A. variegatum ticks were obtained from heartwater free areas
and verified negative for E. ruminantium by LAMP.
Total DNA was extracted as described above. The concentrations of DNA were 0.40-16.56 ng/μl and 1.97-4.20
ng/μl for those extracted from bovine blood and A. variegatum, respectively. The standard plasmid was diluted
with DNA solution prepared from bovine blood or A.
variegatum to give final concentrations of 1, 10, 102 ,
103, 104 copies of plasmid DNA per microliter.
LAMP sensitivity and specificity

Preparation of plasmid standard

The pCS20 and sodB genes of E. ruminantium were
amplified by PCR using the F3 and B3 primers of each
LAMP primer set. PCR was carried out using high-fidelity KOD plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan)
in 25-μl reaction mixture containing 1.0 μM of each primer, 200 μM dNTPs, 1.0 unit of KOD plus DNA polymerase, and genomic DNA from E. ruminantium,
isolate Welgevonden. Amplification was performed for
25 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 1
min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 2 min.
The PCR products were poly-A tailed and then cloned

The sensitivity of each LAMP assay was assessed using
each standard plasmid (10 4 , 10 3 , 10 2 , 10, 5, and 1
copies/reaction) in a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter
(Model & Maker). Readings were analyzed by LA-200
version 0.18 software (Teramecs, Kyoto, Japan), and
positive real-time reactions were determined by taking
into account the time taken for the turbidity value to
increase above a predetermined threshold value of 0.1
[29]. To confirm that each LAMP amplified the correct
target, the product was electrophoresed in a 2.0% agarose gel stained with Gel-Red TM (Biotium, Hayward,
CA) or visualized under UV light, as described below.

Nakao et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:296
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/296

LAMP specificity assays were conducted using 18 different isolates of E. ruminantium, isolates of 5 closely
related rickettsial bacteria, and tick DNA samples positive for 3 different species of USA ehrlichiae (described
below).
Detection of LAMP products

In addition to monitoring turbidity and gel electrophoresis, we used a common dsDNA-binding dye for the
detection of LAMP products. One microliter of the
dsDNA-dye mixture, consisting of 25% (v/v) glycerol
and Gel-Red TM (1:50 dilution of a 10,000× stock solution), was put inside the lid of LAMP reaction tubes. To
prevent dye mixture from dripping with vapor, the reaction mixture was overlaid with one drop of mineral oil.
After the reaction terminated, the tubes were inverted
several times, and LAMP products were visualized
under UV light.
pCS20 PCR and pCS20 real-time PCR assays

To compare the specificity and sensitivity of the LAMP,
conventional PCR and real-time PCR to amplify the
pCS20 gene was conducted using primers HH1F and
HH2R [16], and CowF, CowR and Cow™ probe [20],
respectively (Figure 2). PCR was performed with either
the KAPA Blood PCR kit (Kapabiosystems, Boston, MA)
or the AmpliTaq Gold PCR kit (Applied Biosystem). In
order to reduce the effect of PCR inhibitors in the templates, the KAPA Blood PCR kit was used for the analysis
of field samples. PCR products were electrophoresed in a
1.2% agarose gel stained with Gel-Red TM. The real-time
PCR was performed with THUNDERBIRD qPCR Mix
(Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and analyzed on Stratagene
Mx3000 QPCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
A. americanum samples harbouring DNA from Ehrlichia
species

This study employed 17 DNA samples from A. americanum ticks recovered from people in the USA between
2004 and 2006, in which zoonotic Ehrlichia (E. ewingii,
E. chaffeensis, or PM Ehrlichia) were detected by conventional PCR for the P28 antigen gene (E. ewingii) or nested
PCR based on the 16S rRNA gene (E. chaffeensis) or
citrate synthase gene (PM Ehrlichia), as described elsewhere [42,45]. Collection details are shown in Table 4.
