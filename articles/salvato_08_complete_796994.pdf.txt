Abstract
Background: Knowledge of animal mitochondrial genomes is very important to understand their
molecular evolution as well as for phylogenetic and population genetic studies. The Lepidoptera
encompasses more than 160,000 described species and is one of the largest insect orders. To date
only nine lepidopteran mitochondrial DNAs have been fully and two others partly sequenced.
Furthermore the taxon sampling is very scant. Thus advance of lepidopteran mitogenomics deeply
requires new genomes derived from a broad taxon sampling. In present work we describe the
mitochondrial genome of the moth Ochrogaster lunifer.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of O. lunifer is a circular molecule 15593 bp long. It includes
the entire set of 37 genes usually present in animal mitochondrial genomes. It contains also 7
intergenic spacers. The gene order of the newly sequenced genome is that typical for Lepidoptera
and differs from the insect ancestral type for the placement of trnM. The 77.84% A+T content of
its α strand is the lowest among known lepidopteran genomes. The mitochondrial genome of O.
lunifer exhibits one of the most marked C-skew among available insect Pterygota genomes. The
protein-coding genes have typical mitochondrial start codons except for cox1 that present an
unusual CGA. The O. lunifer genome exhibits the less biased synonymous codon usage among
lepidopterans. Comparative genomics analysis study identified atp6, cox1, cox2 as cox3, cob, nad1,
nad2, nad4, and nad5 as potential markers for population genetics/phylogenetics studies. A peculiar
feature of O. lunifer mitochondrial genome it that the intergenic spacers are mostly made by
repetitive sequences.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial genome of O. lunifer is the first representative of superfamily
Noctuoidea that account for about 40% of all described Lepidoptera. New genome shares many
features with other known lepidopteran genomes. It differs however for its low A+T content and
marked C-skew. Compared to other lepidopteran genomes it is less biased in synonymous codon
usage. Comparative evolutionary analysis of lepidopteran mitochondrial genomes allowed the
identification of previously neglected coding genes as potential phylogenetic markers. Presence of
repetitive elements in intergenic spacers of O. lunifer genome supports the role of DNA slippage as
possible mechanism to produce spacers during replication.

Background
Animal mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) are usually
circular molecules spanning 16–20 kbp that contain 13
protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA and 22
transfer (tRNA) genes [1]. Non-coding control elements,
that regulate the transcription and replication of the
genome, are also present in mtDNAs [1,2]. Mitochondrial
genomes are very important subject for different scientific
disciplines including animal health, comparative and evolutionary genomics, molecular evolution, phylogenetics
and population genetics. However, current knowledge on
mtDNAs is very uneven as well exemplified by sequences
available in GenBank that were obtained mostly from vertebrate taxa. Insects constitute the most species-rich class
among animals with almost a million of taxa described to
date [3]. Within the insects, the Lepidoptera (butterflies
plus moths) order accounts for more than 160,000 species
[4]. Despite this huge taxonomic diversity the existing
information on lepidopteran mtDNA is very limited.
Complete sequences have been determined for the two
butterflies Coreana raphaelis and Artogeia melete, and for
the seven moths Adoxophyes honmai, Antheraea pernyi,
Bombyx mori, Bombyx mandarina and Manduca sexta, Phthonandria atrilineata and Saturnia boisduvalii [5-9] while near
complete sequences exist for Ostrinia furnacalis and
Ostrinia nubilalis [10] (Table 1). Current genomic knowledge of Lepidoptera is very scanty and the covered taxonsampling is extremely poor and limited to six superfamiles among the 45–48 known, and to 9 families of the
recognized 120 [4]. A better understanding of the lepidopteran mtDNA requires an expansion of taxon and genome
samplings. We were able to fully sequence the mitochondrial genome of the bag-shelter moth Ochrogaster lunifer.
The newly determined mtDNA is the first complete
sequence for the Superfamily Noctuoidea, a very large
assemblage that accounts for about 40% of all described
Lepidoptera. [4]. In the present paper the Ochrogaster
genome is described and compared with mtDNAs of other
lepidopterans as well as pterygote Insecta.

Results and discussion
Genome organization, structure and composition
The mtDNA genome of O. lunifer is a circular molecule
15593 bp long. It includes the entire set of 37 genes usually present in animal mtDNAs [1], i.e., 13 PCGs, 22 tRNA
genes, and 2 ribosomal genes (Figure 1). The mtDNA
genome of O. lunifer contains also 7 intergenic spacers
(s1–s7), spanning at least 15 bp, described in a paragraph
below. Genes on the same strand are overlapped (e.g.
trnM vs. trnI; atp8 vs. atp6), contiguous, separated by few
nucleotides or by intergenic spacers (e.g. nad3 vs. trnA;
trnC vs. trnY). Genes on opposite strands exhibit a similar
behavior (Figure 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/331

The O. lunifer mtDNA has the typical lepidopteran gene
order [8,9] that differs from the ancestral gene order of
insects [1] for the placement of trnM. In the ancestral type
(e.g. Drosophila yakuba mtDNA) the order in the α strand
is: A+T region, trnI, trnQ, trnM, nad2. In all lepidopteran
mtDNAs, sequenced to date, the order is: A+T region,
trnM, trnI, trnQ, nad2 which implies the translocation of
trnM [5-11]. This placement of trnM is a molecular feature
exclusive to lepidopteran mtDNAs. Further genome
sequencing is necessary to establish if this feature is a
mitochondrial signature of the whole order Lepidoptera.
The composition of the α strand of O. lunifer mtDNA is A
= 6252 (40.09%), T = 5886 (37.75%), G = 1179 (7.56%)
and C = 2276 (14.60%).
The A+T% and G+C% values for the α strand as well as the
A- and G-skews [12] were calculated for all available complete mtDNA genomes of Pterygota and are presented in
the scatter plots of Figure 2.
The average A+T% value for the analyzed mtDNAs set is
76. 63 ± 4.84. The highest A+T% values are shared by the
mtDNAs of three bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus ignitus and
Melipona bicolor) and two bugs (Aleurodicus dugesii and
Schizaphis graminum). All lepidopteran mtDNAs but O.
lunifer exhibit high A+T% values. The A+T content of O.
lunifer mtDNA is 77.84% that represents the lowest value
for lepidopteran complete mtDNAs [5-8,10]. The lowest
A+T contents are found in the termite mtDNAs (Reticulitermes spp.). Extreme A+T values are also shared by species
having highly re-arranged gene order [13]. However the
possession of a re-arranged genome is not sufficient per se
to have an A+T content drastically departing from the
average (e.g. Aleurochiton aceris and Bemisia tabaci). The
A+T values appear to be linked to taxonomic relatedness
at low rank (i.e. genus, family) (e.g. species of Drosophila,
species of Bactrocera, members of family Apidae). The relation is not true at higher ranks (i.e. superfamily; order)
where patterns become inconsistent and the A+T content
can be very different among species as exemplified by
Hemiptera (A. dugesii vs.Triatoma dimidiata).
The average A-skew is 0.04214 ± 0.11350 and most of
pterygote mtDNAs are slightly to moderately A-skewed
with values ranging from 0.00287 (B. ignitus) to 0.18247
(Locusta migratoria). The lepidopteran A-skews vary from 0.04748 (C. raphaelis) to 0.05872 (B. mori) with the O.
lunifer mtDNA exhibiting a slight A-skew (0.03015). The
Reticulitermes mtDNA genomes, having the lowest A+T%
content, exhibit a very pronounced A-skew. Most marked
T-skews are observed in the mtDNA genomes of Campanulotes bidentatus and Trialeuroides vaporarium that have low
A+T% content and gene-orders different than insect ancestral gene order [1,14,15]. Gene order re-arrangement is

not necessarily linked to strong A/T-skew as proved by the
highly rearranged, but low skew, genome of Heterodoxus
macropus
[16].
The average G+C% content is 23.37 ± 4.84. The G+C%
pattern among various species is obviously opposite to
the A+T% thus it does not require further comments.
More composite is the G/C-skew distribution. The average
G-skew is -0.16006 ± 0.138235. Most of pterygota mtDNAs are C-skewed with G-skew values ranging from 0.32827 (Vanhornia eucnemidarum) to -0.01250 (Heterodoxus macropus). The main exception is represented by the
mtDNA of bugs, while the highest G-skewed genome is
that of C. bidentatus. Most of lepidopteran mtDNAs share
very similar G-skew values that are included within the
bulk of mtDNAs. The notable exception is represented by
the newly determined mtDNA of O. lunifer that exhibits
the second most pronounced C-skew (G-skew = 0.31751) among analyzed genomes.
G-skew can be markedly different even in species belonging to the same genus and having a very similar G+C content as well exemplified by Reticulitermes santonensis and
Reticulitermes virginicus mtDNAs. The same reasoning
applies at high taxonomic rank to the Hemiptera. The
mtDNA of C. bidentatus exhibits very high A-skew and Gskew. However, this feature is not a general rule and
extreme A-skew and G-skew are not necessarily reciprocally linked, as proved by species of genus Reticulitermes
that exhibit very strong A-skews but not G-skews.
The list of currently available mtDNAs reveals that there is
a strong bias in term of taxon sampling both at low and
high taxonomic ranks within Pterygota. A direct consequence is that present knowledge of base composition
and A/G skews reflects such biases and addition of a single
taxon can change our view on these features. This point is
well exemplified by the O. lunifer mtDNA that exhibits a
A+T percentage different than other lepidopteran mtD-

NAs that share high A+T contents [8,9]. Thus a broad and
more balanced taxon sampling appears to be a mandatory
goal to investigate and identify general patterns for the
parameters considered above.
Protein-coding genes
The mtDNA of O. lunifer contains the full set of PCGs usually present in animal mtDNA. PCGs are arranged along
the genome according to the standard order of Insects [1]
(Figure 1). The putative start codons of PCGs are those
previously known for animal mtDNA i.e. ATN, GTG, TTG,
GTT [17] with the only exception represented by the CGA
start codon of cox1 gene. This non-canonical putative start
codon is found also in the butterfly A. melete and in the
moths A. honmai, B. mori, B. mandarina, M. sexta and P.
atrilineata [5-8]. In the butterfly C. raphaelis the tetranucleotide TTAG is the putative start codon [6] and the six
nucleotide TATTAG has been suggested as putative start
codon for the moths O. nubilalis and O. furnicalis [10]. An
unusual start codon for cox1 gene is known in various
arthropod mtDNA [e.g. [18]].

The cox1, cox2, nad5, and nad4 genes of O. lunifer mtDNA
have incomplete stop codons. The presence of incomplete
stop codons is a feature shared with all lepidopteran mtDNAs sequenced to date [5-10] and more in general with
many arthropod mtDNAs [1].
The atp8 and a atp6 of O. lunifer are the only PCGs having
a seven nucleotides overlap (Figure 1). This feature is
common to all lepidopteran mtDNA genomes known [510] and is found in many animal mtDNAs [1].
The abundance of codon families and Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) [19] in PCGs were investigated for all available lepidopteran mtDNAs and the
results are summarized in Figures 3 and 4. All first codons
as well as stop codons, complete and incomplete, were

excluded from the analysis to avoid biases due to unusual
putative start codons and incomplete stop codons.
Total number of non-stop codons (CDs) used by the 12
analyzed mtDNAs is very similar ranging from 3695 of C.
raphaelis to 3732 of O. lunifer. The codon families exhibit
a very similar behavior among considered species. The
eight codon families with at least 50 CDs per thousand
CDs (Leu2, Ile, Phe, Met, Asn, Ser2, Gly, Tyr) encompass

an average 65.82% ± 1.20% of all CDs. The three families
with at least 100 CDs per thousand CDs (Leu2, Ile, Phe)
account for an average 35.36% ± 0.98% of all CDs (Figure
3). The A+T rich CDs are favored over synonymous CDs
with lower A+T content as proved by RSCU results (Figure

where the TTA codon accounts for the large majority of
CDs in the family (see below). Invertebrate mitochondrial
code includes 62 amino-acid encoding codons [1].

A-skew vs. A+T% and G-skew vs. G+C% in the Pteryogota mtDNAs. Values were calculated on α strands for full
lengh mtDNA genomes. The X axis provides the skews values, while the Y axis provides the A+T/G+C values. Named of species are colored according to their taxonomic placement at Order level (see Table 1).

Among the 12 analyzed genomes the total number of
used codons results to be directly linked to the A+T content. The C. raphaelis mtDNA, having the highest A+T%
content (see Figure 2) uses 52 codons, and never utilized
the 10 G+C rich codons listed in Figure 2. Conversely, O.

lunifer mtDNA, characterized by the lowest A+T% among
considered lepidopteran genomes, uses all 62 codons.
Differences in the number of used CDs are present
between species of the same genus (e.g. B. mandarina vs.
B. mori) even if the discrepancies appear circumscribed to

Scatter plot graphic of MILC vs. ENC calculated for
PCGs of lepidopteran mtDNAs. Dots correspond to
average values calculated for different genes. PCGs on α
strand are blue-colored, PCGs on β strand are red colored.
All pooled PCGs are presented as a green dot plot. Genes
nomenclature as in main text.

G+C rich CDs with very limited use (e.g. GCG and CGC).
The Leu1 (average = 11.73 ± 3. 82%) and Leu2 (average =
88.44 ± 3.89%) codon families are very differently represented in lepidopteran PCGs while Ser1 (average = 34.95
± 3.67%) and Ser2 (average = 64.05 ± 1.09%) exhibit a
more balanced composition.
Four amino acid residues (Leu, Ile, Phe and Ser) account
for more than 44.50% (average = 45.68 ± 0.58%) of all
residues forming the 13 mitochondrial proteins. The Leu
and Ile amino acids share hydrophobic lateral chains, Phe
is also hydrophobic and Ser exhibits an aliphatic behavior
[20] thus their massive presence is striking but not surprising for membrane proteins.
Codon usage by single PCGs was investigated by calculating the two indices ENC (Effective number of codon used)
[21] and MILC (Measure Independent of Length and
Composition) [22]. Both indices, based on different
approaches [21,22] provide a measure of codon variability of PCGs. The ENC and MILC estimate the codon variability in a way that allows comparison among sequences
having different lengths as is the case of various PCGs.

Genes exhibiting a higher diversity in codon usage have
generally a higher number of variable sites, a prerequisite
to be potential phylogenetic markers. Thus the use of ENC
and MILC scores, according to the new approach presented in this paper, is a way to study PCG sequences variability on a codon perspective. The best scores of both
indices should allow to identify the more diverse PCGs in
a approach complementary to the usual method based on
evolutionary distances among orthologous sequences
(e.g. [8]). The assessment of genetic variability is an interesting point. Indeed some PCGs are standard marker for
species recognition [23] or have been extensively used as
phylogenetic markers in Lepidoptera while others have
received so far limited or no attention. Understanding the
genetic diversity of each PCG is a prerequisite to determine its phylogenetic usefulness. The ENC and MILC values were calculated for all PCGs but atp8 that contains too
a few codons to get reliable ENC/MILC estimations [22].
Calculations were extended also to all 13 PCGs pooled as
well as to the pooled PCGs belonging to α and β strands
respectively. The scatter plot analysis is provided in Figure
5. As expected the greatest diversity in codon usage is
found when all codons are considered. Good codon diversity is found also when all PCGs of α or β strands are considered. More interesting is the behavior of single genes.
In this latter case sequences well established as phylogenetic markers (i.e. cox1, cob, nad5, and cox2) are intermixed with PCGs poorly or not considered by researchers
(e.g. cox3, nad4, nad1, nad2). Our results suggest that the
neglected PCGs should be considered as potential markers thus extending the number of mtDNA PCGs sampled
for population as well as phylogenetic markers. Findings,
based on codon diversity, must be integrated with direct
comparisons of sequences [8] that allow to better define
the optimal task that each gene can perform i.e. to be used
at low taxonomic level or at high taxonomic level.
Transfer and ribosomal RNA genes
Ochrogaster genome has the characteristic 22 tRNAs set
(Figure 6) present in most of animal mtDNAs [1]. All
tRNAs present the typical clover leaf secondary structure
but trnS1 lacks the DHU stem. This feature is shared with
the C. raphaelis mtDNA [6] but is not a general feature of
lepidopteran mtDNA as proved by A. honmai that has all
tRNAs with a complete clover leaf structure [7]. In general,
the lack of DHU arm in trnS1 is a common condition in
metazoan mtDNAs [24].

The trnA, trnD, trnG, trnK, trnL1, trnL2, trnQ, and trnS2 of
Ochrogaster mtDNA show mismatches in their stems. Mismatches are located mostly in the acceptor and anticodon
stems with a single exception represented by trnD that
exhibits the mismatch on the TΨC stem. Mismatches on
tRNA stems are known also for the trnA, trnL1, trnL2, and
trnQ, of C. raphaelis [6]. Mismatches observed in tRNAs

are corrected through RNA-editing mechanisms that are
well known for arthropod mtDNA [e.g. [24]].
Preliminary analysis performed on rrnL and rrnS of O.
lunifer revealed that these genes are capable of folding into
structures (data not shown) similar to those already produced for lepidopteran mitochondrial ribosomal subunits [8,25,26]. Further studies, that extend the taxon
sampling, are currently in progress in our lab to better
define rrnL and rrnS structures within the Thaumetopoeinae subfamily that includes also O. lunifer.
Non coding regions
The mtDNA genome of O. lunifer contains 7 intergenic
spacers (s1–s7) spanning at least 15 bp (Figures 1 and 7).
The features of s1–s7 spacers are presented below with reference to the α strand for orientation and sequence motifs
description.

The s1 spacer, located between trnQ and nad2, appears to
be the result of a duplicated segment (Figure 7). The s1
spacer is present in all 12 lepidopteran mtDNAs so far
sequenced while it is absent in other insects [8]. While the
genomic location is constant the sequence divergence is
high among species [8]. Further investigation with a
broad taxon sampling within the Lepidoptera is necessary
to assess if the s1 spacer is a constant molecular signature
of lepidopteran mtDNA.
The s2 spacer, placed between trnC and trnY, derives from
the triplication of a six nucleotides motif with minor
changes (Figure 7). An 11 bp spacer between trnC and trnY
is found also in the mtDNA of A. melete and shares the
ACAATT motif with the s2 spacer of O. lunifer. Because no
other known lepidopteran mtDNA exhibits such a spacer
its presence in A. melete and O. lunifer has to be interpreted as the result of independent events.
Spacer s3, located between nad3 and trnA, exhibits a partial duplicated segment and a poly-T motif within the first
30 nt. The second half of s3 spacer is characterized by two
microsatellite repeats (CA)10(TA)12. Spacers having the
same genomic location, and containing TA microsatellites
are found also in B. mori and B. mandarina mtDNA
genomes.
Spacer s4, inserted between trnE and trnF, contains a 5'
microsatellite (TA)23, while the 3' half seems to be the
triplication of a 10 nucleotides motif with some changes
(Figure 7). A spacer characterized by a different motif
(TATTA)31, but having the same genomic placement, is
found in the A. honmai mtDNA genome.
The spacer s5, located between trnS2 and nad1, contains
the ATACTAA motif which is conserved across the Lepi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/331

doptera order [8]. This motif is possibly fundamental to
site recognition by the transcription termination peptide
(mtTERM protein) [2]. Spacer s5 is present in most insect
mtDNAs even if the nucleotide sequence can be quite
divergent [8].
The s6 spacer is located between trnS2 and -rrnL and
exhibits a di-nucleotide microsatellite (TA)19 directly in
contact with the 3' end of rrnL gene. To date spacer s6 is
known only for the mtDNA of O. lunifer.
The s7 spacer coincides with the A+T region. Several features common to the Lepidoptera A+T region [8] are
present in the s7 spacer. The ORβ (origin of the β strand
replication) is located 21 bp downstream from rrnS gene
in B. mori [27]. It contains the motif ATAGA followed by
an 18 bp poly-T stretch. A very similar pattern occurs in O.
lunifer where the ATAGA motif is located 17 bp downstream from rnnS gene and is followed by a 20 bp poly-T
stretch (Figure 7). A microsatellite-like (AT)7(TA)3 element preceded by the ATTTA motif is present in the 3'
third of O. lunifer s7 spacer. The presence of a microsatellite preceded by the ATTA motif is also a feature found in
the A+T regions of other Lepidoptera [8]. Finally a 10 bp
poly-A is present immediately upstream trnM. This poly-T
(in the β strand) element is still a common feature of the
A+T region in Lepidoptera [8,28]. No large repeated segments were detected in the A+T region of O. lunifer. This
arrangement is consistent with other lepidopteran A+T
regions while markedly contrasts with patterns observed
in other insect orders [8,29].
Intergenic spacers containing repeated elements are scattered all over the lepidopteran mtDNAs while repeated
elements are restricted mostly to the A+T region in other
insects [8]. Most parts of spacers of O. lunifer are made by
repeated motifs. Predominance of repeated elements suggest that mtDNA expansion can be achieved through a
miss-pairing duplication mechanism, i.e. DNA slippage,
during genome replication. Several intergenic spacers are
restricted to a single butterfly/moth species and have not
counterparts even within Lepidoptera. Thus it is plausible
to suggest that spacers production occurs independently
and recursively within Lepidoptera. It remains unknown
while this feature is so prominent in moths and butterflies
and apparently limited, reduced or absent in other insect
mtDNAs sequenced to date. This behavior requires further
investigation provided that mtDNA intergenic spacers are
found in non-insect Arthropoda as well as other animal
phyla [e.g. [18,30]].

Conclusion
The mitochondrial genome of O. lunifer is the first
sequenced mtDNA for a representative of the Noctuoidea
a superfamily that includes about 40% of all described

lepidopteran species. The newly determined genome
shares the gene order, the presence of intergenic spacers,
and other features with previously known lepidopteran

genomes. The placement of trnM immediately after the
A+T region results to be an exclusive molecular signature
of all lepidopteran mtDNAs sequenced to date. Further

genome sequencing will establish if this feature characterizes the whole order Lepidoptera. The mtDNA of O. lunifer
exhibits a peculiar low A+T content and marked C-skew.
Compared to other lepidopteran genomes it is less biased
in synonymous codon usage. Comparative analysis on
codon usage among lepidopteran mitochondrial
genomes identified atp6, cox1, cox2, cox3, cob, nad1, nad2,
nad4, and nad5 as potential markers for phylogenetic and
population genetic studies. Most of the genes listed above
have been previously neglected for the tasks suggested
here. The massive presence of repetitive elements in intergenic spacers of O. lunifer genome lead us to suggest an
important role of DNA slippage as possible mechanism to
produce spacers during replication.

Methods
Sample origin and DNA extraction
An ethanol-preserved larva specimen of Ochrogaster lunifer
collected in Australia (Suburb of Kenmore, Queensland,
25th February 2005) by Myron P. Zalucki (University of
Queensland) was used as starting material for this study.
Total DNA was extracted by applying a salting-out protocol [31]. Quality of DNA was assessed through electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and staining with ethidium
bromide.
PCR amplification and sequencing of Ochogaster lunifer
mtDNA
PCR amplification was performed using a mix of insect
universal primers [32,33] and primers specifically
designed on the O. lunifer sequences. For a full list of successful primers as well as PCR conditions see Additional
file 1. The PCR products were visualized in electrophoresis
in a 1% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide.
Each PCR product represented by a single electrophoretic
band was purified with the ExoSAP-IT kit (Amersham Biosciences) and directly sequenced. Sequencing of both
strands was performed at the BMR Genomics service
(Padova, Italy) on automated DNA sequencers mostly
employing the primers used for PCR amplification.
Sequence assembly and annotation
The mtDNA final consensus sequence was assembled
using the SeqMan II program from the Lasergene software
package (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Genes and strands
nomenclature used in this paper follows Negrisolo et al.
[18].

Sequence analysis was performed as follows. Initially the
mtDNA sequence was translated into putative proteins
using the Transeq program available at the EBI web site.
The true identity of these polypeptides was established
using the BLAST program [34,35] available at the NCBI
web site. Gene boundaries were determined as follows.
The 5' ends of PEGs were inferred to be at the first legiti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/331

mate in-frame start codon (ATN, GTG, TTG, GTT; [17]) in
the open reading frame (ORF) that was not located within
the upstream gene encoded on the same strand. The only
exception was atp6, which has been previously demonstrated to overlap with its upstream gene atp8 in many
mtDNAs [17]. The PCG terminus was inferred to be at the
first in-frame stop codon encountered. When the stop
codon was located within the sequence of a downstream
gene encoded on the same strand, a truncated stop codon
(T or TA) adjacent to the beginning of the downstream
gene was designated as the termination codon. This
codon was thought to be completed by polyadenylation
to a complete TAA stop codon after transcript processing.
Finally pair-wise comparisons with orthologous proteins
were performed with ClustalW program [36] to better
define the limits of PCGs.
Irrespectively of the real initiation codon, a formyl-Met
was assumed to be the starting amino acid for all the proteins as previously proved for other mitochondrial
genomes [37,38].
The transfer RNA genes were identified using the tRNAscan-SE program [39] or recognized manually as sequences
having the appropriate anticodon and capable of folding
into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure [17].
The boundaries of the ribosomal rrnL gene were assumed
to be delimited by the ends of the trnV-s6 pair. The 3' end
of rrnS gene was assumed to be delimited by the start of
trnV while the 5'end was determined through comparison
with orthologous genes of other Lepidoptera so far
sequenced.
Genomic analysis
Nucleotide composition was calculated with the EditSeq
program included in the Lasergene software package. The
GC-skew = (G-C)/(G+C) and AT-skew = (A-T)/(A+T) were
used [12] to measure the base compositional difference
between the different strands or between genes coded on
the alternative strands. The Relative Synonymous Codon
Usage (RSCU) values were calculated with MEGA 4 program [40].

The codon usage by analyzed genomes was investigated
by calculating the two indices ENC (Effective Number of
Codon used) [21] and MILC (Measure Independent of
Length and Composition [22]. ENC and MILC values
were calculated with the INCA 2.1 program [41].
