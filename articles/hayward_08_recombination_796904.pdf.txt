Abstract
Background: Recombination is a relatively common phenomenon in retroviruses. We
investigated recombination in Feline Immunodeficiency Virus from naturally-infected New Zealand
domestic cats (Felis catus) by sequencing regions of the gag, pol and env genes.
Results: The occurrence of intragenic recombination was highest in env, with evidence of
recombination in 6.4% (n = 156) of all cats. A further recombinant was identified in each of the gag
(n = 48) and pol (n = 91) genes. Comparisons of phylogenetic trees across genes identified cases of
incongruence, indicating intergenic recombination. Three (7.7%, n = 39) of these incongruencies
were found to be significantly different using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.
Surprisingly, our phylogenies from the gag and pol genes showed that no New Zealand sequences
group with reference subtype C sequences within intrasubtype pairwise distances. Indeed, we find
one and two distinct unknown subtype groups in gag and pol, respectively. These observations
cause us to speculate that these New Zealand FIV strains have undergone several recombination
events between subtype A parent strains and undefined unknown subtype strains, similar to the
evolutionary history hypothesised for HIV-1 "subtype E".
Endpoint dilution sequencing was used to confirm the consensus sequences of the putative
recombinants and unknown subtype groups, providing evidence for the authenticity of these
sequences. Endpoint dilution sequencing also resulted in the identification of a dual infection event
in the env gene. In addition, an intrahost recombination event between variants of the same subtype
in the pol gene was established. This is the first known example of naturally-occurring
recombination in a cat with infection of the parent strains.
Conclusion: Evidence of intragenic recombination in the gag, pol and env regions, and complex
intergenic recombination, of FIV from naturally-infected domestic cats in New Zealand was found.
Strains of unknown subtype were identified in all three gene regions. These results have
implications for the use of the current FIV vaccine in New Zealand.

Background
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is a retrovirus that specifically infects felines and hyaenas [1]. In the strain that
infects the domestic cat, Felis catus (FIV-Fca), five phylogenetic subtypes have been described, labelled A to E [2-4].
These subtypes are based on the V3 to V5 region of the env
gene, with some recent studies confirming phylogenies
using the gag gene [2,5-8]. In the env gene, intrasubtype
pairwise distances of up to about 14% are observed, while
intersubtype distances of 15% to 38% are commonly
found [2,4,8]. Recently, we and others have proposed
potentially novel subtypes based on phylogenetically-distinct sequence groups that differ from known subtypes
[5,9,10].
The env gene encodes the viral surface and transmembrane glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41 respectively. These
glycoproteins are involved in host cell recognition and
have been shown to contain epitopes that elicit cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in FIV-infected individuals [11,12]. As this region of the viral genome is likely
to be under strong selection, it is likely to change rapidly.
As a retrovirus, FIV has a relatively high evolutionary rate,
on the order of 1–3% per decade in the env and pol genes
of the cougar strain, FIV-Pco [13]. This high rate is largely
attributed to substitution errors made during reverse transcription [14]. However, as a retrovirus with a diploid
genome, the phenomenon of recombination is also very
important in the evolution of FIV. Recombination occurs
as a result of template-switching by the enzyme reverse
transcriptase when the particular infecting virion has a heterozygous genome [15]. Hence, a prerequisite for recombination is dual infection. Previously, three naturallyinfected cats have been identified with FIV intersubtype
dual infections: one with subtypes A and B from USA [16],
and two with subtypes A and C from New Zealand (NZ)
[17]. In addition, a natural superinfection event has been
documented between two subtype A FIV-infected cats
housed together in Australia [18]. The superinfected cat
has its own unique FIV strains that had been isolated from
the cat previously and additional FIV strains that show
within 6.8% nucleotide similarity to the FIV strains isolated from the cat inhabiting the same house [18]. Natu-

rally-occurring FIV-Fca intersubtype recombination has
been described in domestic cats from Canada, Hawaii,
USA and Japan [6,16,19].
In our previous study of FIV env gene sequences in NZ
domestic cats, we found subtypes A and C, nine putative
A/C recombinants and a group of sequences of an
unknown and phylogenetically-distinct subtype [10].
Here we further investigate the occurrence of recombinant
sequences in naturally-infected NZ domestic cats using
the gag and pol genes, in addition to env. We find an additional intragenic recombinant in the env gene, giving ten
recombinant sequences for this gene, or 6.4% (n = 156).
From each of the gag and pol gene regions we find only
one (2.1% and 1.1% respectively) intragenic recombinant. Our results also show that the previously-proposed unknown subtype sequences from the env gene do
not show the same monophyletic grouping in the gag and
pol regions. In addition, we find inconsistencies in subtype C designation in the gag and pol genes. We suggest
that the patterns seen in these samples are the result of
multiple recombination events throughout the FIV
genome. The results illustrate the importance of sequencing and analysing multiple genes to gain a more complete
picture of recombination events.

Results
Phylogenetic trees
The env NJ phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) shows three main
groups, which are subtypes A, C and an unknown (UNZenv), as previously shown [10]. One further sequence,
in addition to the 17 sequences from our earlier study,
now falls in the unknown group. Average K2P distances
suggest that the unknown group could be a new subtype,
with distances ranging from 20.6% to 22.7% between the
unknown and other subtypes (Table 1). Also seen in the
env NJ tree are 13 outliers, 11 of which were documented
in our previous study [10].

The gag NJ tree (Fig. 2) features two large groups of NZ
sequences, one of which is subtype A. The other group of
sequences (U-NZgag) is monophyletic with subtype C reference sequences (BM3070 and CaONC02 from Canada,
and FIV-C36 from USA). However, U-NZgag sequences

are quite distantly related to the subtype C sequences,
with an average K2P distance of 15.64%, a value greater
than intrasubtype gag distances and consistent with intersubtype gag distances (Table 2). This level of similarity
indicates that the U-NZgag and C groups may be distinct
but related subtypes.
Interestingly, when we include the four subtype C isolates
from Taiwan (TI-1 (AB027298), TI-2 (AB027299), TI-3
(AB027300), TI-4 (AB027301)) [20] by cropping about
550 bp from the start of our gag sequence alignment, we
find that the Taiwan isolates group with the U-NZgag
sequences (average K2P distance of 3.74%; tree not
shown). This finding adds weight to the validity of the UNZgag sequences and also suggests a common origin
between NZ and Taiwanese FIV.
The pol NJ tree (Fig. 3) shows NZ sequences split into three
groups. One of these is subtype A. The other two groups
of sequences (U-NZpol1 and U-NZpol2) do not belong to
a known subtype. Although U-NZpol2 forms a monophyletic group with subtype C, the average K2P distance
of 8.88% (Table 3) is higher than all other pol intrasubtype distances. RIP analyses also show that the nine
sequences belonging to U-NZpol2 are most similar to
subtype C, with strongest similarity in the second "half" of
the sequences (data not shown).
The largest group of NZ pol sequences, U-NZpol1, is most
closely related to subtype A (Table 3). This cluster of
sequences does not form a monophyletic group. However, when the recombinant sequence PN9 is removed
and a NJ tree reconstructed, U-NZpol1 does form a monophyletic group (data not shown). RIP analysis shows that
this group of sequences look like recombinants of subtype
A and C. However, KH test results are not significant for
these sequences (data not shown).
Intragenic recombination
Env
RIP outputs show that the two new env outliers are potential recombinant sequences, with clear crossover patterns
(Fig. 4A). The Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test shows significant results for both halves of the query sequence for one
of these additional outliers (PN18; data not shown).

From the RIP alignments and visual inspection of the
sequences, the approximate locations of the putative
crossover points for each env putative recombinant
sequence were determined. Of the ten putative recombinant sequences (nine from our previous study and one
from the present study), there are only six unique recombinant patterns, all involving subtypes A and C (Table 4).
Four cats share one recombinant pattern with two crossovers and two cats share another with only a single crossover. One particular crossover site (range of 7508–7522) is
featured in six NZ sequences.
From a total of 156 FIV-infected NZ cat env sequences subjected to phylogenetic analysis, thirteen outliers were
identified. Ten of the thirteen outlier sequences had significantly different topologies constructed from each side
of the crossover site as determined by the KH test. Thus,
ten (6.4%) putative recombinants were found.
Given the level of recombination that we have found in
env, we suspect that there are a significant number of
undetected putative recombinant sequences in public
databases, incorrectly identified as belonging to a particular subtype. For example, a recent study on FIV strains in
cats of Portugal found two outlying env sequences
(150_02LisP and 164_02UZP) that were initially assigned
into subtype A [9]. However, genetic divergence analysis
and an amino acid phylogenetic tree indicated that the
correct location was in a subcluster of subtype B [9]. We
analysed the two suspicious sequences using RIP and the
KH test, and found that they both show a statistically significant intragenic B/A recombination event (Fig. 5; Table
5).
Gag
There is only a single outlier sequence in the gag NJ tree
(PN6; Fig. 2). This was tested for recombination using RIP
and shows a clear recombination pattern, with two crossover events (Fig. 4B). The KH test results confirm that this
sequence is a putative recombinant (Table 6). Ten endpoint dilution sequences were obtained for the gag region
of PN6, all of which group with the consensus sequence
on a NJ phylogenetic tree with a maximum pairwise distance of 1.42%. From a total of 48 FIV-infected NZ cat gag
sequences subjected to phylogenetic analysis, one (2.1%)
putative recombinant was found.
Pol
There are two outlier sequences on the pol NJ tree (Ni,
PN9; Fig. 3). The RIP output for Ni shows a recombination event between A/U-NZpol1 and U-NZpol2 (Fig.
4C(a)), although this is not statistically significant (Table
6). PN9, in contrast, suggests a recombination event
between subtype B and U-NZpol1 (Fig. 4C(b)), which is
statistically significant (Table 6). Note that although PN9

shows statistical significance between the two sides of the
putative crossover location, the similarity values to subtype B in the first part of the sequence are low. Only one
(1.1%) putative recombinant pol sequence is found from
analysing 91 samples in this region. This sequence is the
only recombinant involving subtype B found in a NZ cat.
Intergenic recombination
The incongruent subtype assignment seen in different
gene regions of nine NZ cat samples are shown in Fig. 6.
The ML tree that was determined to best describe the data
and thus used as the backbone constraint in further SH
tests, is the concatenated gene tree.

Significant results from the SH tests to determine differences in ML trees constructed with the inclusion of putative intergenic recombinant sequences are shown in Table
7. After the Bonferroni correction was applied, only five
pairs of ML trees returned statistically significant results
for the reciprocal SH tests. None of the significant results
involve the pol region.
Three of the five statistically significant SH test results
were between the gene trees for gag and env. Therefore, in
these three samples we have evidence of putative intergenic recombination.
Two of these samples (GBI84, WST05) also gave statistically significant results for incongruencies between the
concatenated tree and the gag gene tree. As a conservative
estimate, at least three of the 39 samples, or 7.7%, are
intergenic recombinants.
Unknown subtype
Representatives of the samples that make up the unknown
subtype of the env NJ tree were sequenced in the gag and
pol gene regions in order to confirm the existence of a
novel NZ-specific subtype. However, in the gag NJ tree, the
U-NZenv samples are found in subtype A and the UNZgag group. In the pol NJ tree, the U-NZenv sequences
are found in U-NZpol1 and U-NZpol2 groups. Thus, we
have no consistent evidence for a novel NZ-specific subtype across the three gene regions. Note that, due to low
viral load and sample quantity limitations, not all the

sequences of env unknown subtype have been amplified
in the gag and pol genes.
The discrepancies in the placement of the sequences of
unknown subtype seen between the phylogenetic trees
could be explained by multiple recombination events
between subtype A and undefined parent strains. This
possible explanation is similar to that suggested for HIV-1
subtype E (CRF_AE01), which is hypothesised to be a circulating recombinant form of subtype A and an unknown
parent strain (subtype E) that has not been found [21].
Endpoint dilution sequencing
With the exception of two samples (see next section), all
endpoint dilution sequences and the respective consensus
sequence of the same sample are within 2.35% of each
other (Table 8). This shows that each consensus sequence
is a representative of a true proviral sequence and not an
example of PCR-mediated recombination as a result of
dual infection.
Intrahost recombination
One of the exceptions found from endpoint dilution
sequencing is the pol gene of sample TKP94. Eleven endpoint dilution sequences were obtained for this sample,
which fall into two main groups, comprising six and four
sequences (Fig. 7a). The eleventh sequence is an outlier
between these two groups and thus was submitted to RIP
as a check for recombination. The RIP output clearly
shows a crossover event between the two main groups
(Fig. 7b).

Given the pol evolutionary rate of 1–3% per decade, as
documented in FIV-Pco, [13], it would take between 17
and 52 years to generate diversity of 5.2% in an individual
as seen in the pol sequences from sample TKP94 (Table 8).
Since this particular individual is only a juvenile, we suggest the explanation for the viral diversity found in this cat
is a result of same-subtype dual infection.
The second exception found from endpoint dilution
sequencing is seen in the env gene of TKP95. These fourteen sequences have a maximum pairwise distance of
25.7%, a value resembling intersubtype distances. Indeed,

when a phylogeny is constructed of the TKP95 sequences,
we find ten sequences in the U-NZenv group and the
remaining three (and the consensus) in subtype C (Fig. 8).
This dual infection in the env gene of TKP95 is the only
case of naturally-occurring dual subtype infection we have
found in NZ FIV-infected cats. We have found no evidence
of intersubtype recombination in the env gene of this
dually-infected cat. However, recombinant sequences
may be present, but at low frequencies.
Geographical location
Although approximately equal numbers of companion (n
= 72) and feral (n = 77) FIV-infected cats were included in
this study, all but one of the twelve putative intragenic
recombinants were found in companion cats. Only one,
an env recombinant, was isolated from a feral cat.

The locations of the companion cats found to have putative intragenic recombinant FIV sequences are centred
around the lower North Island (Fig. 9). However, the
lower North Island also has a larger sample size of FIVinfected companion cats. The higher number of recombinants located in the lower North Island with respect to
sample size is not significantly different to the upper
North Island and the South Island (Fisher Exact Test; P =
0.841).
As we identified only three putative intergenic recombinants in this study, isolated from two feral and one exTable 5: KH test results for env sequences 150_02LisP and
164_02UZP from Duarte & Tavares (2006)

stray cat from three different locations, these were not
included in the analysis to determine a geographical pattern.

Discussion
Intragenic putative recombination
Of all three genes analysed from NZ FIV-infected cats, we
have found that the env gene has the highest level of
recombination, of 6.4% (n = 156). We suggest this high
level could be because the env gene encodes the surface
glycoproteins, which contain essential recognition sites
for the host immune system [22]. Therefore, this region of
the viral genome is under relatively high selective pressure.

We have identified ten putative recombinant A/C env
sequences, based on results of the KH test. Endpoint dilution sequencing on representative putative recombinant
env sequences confirmed these as real proviral sequences,
with no evidence of dual infection. Within the ten
sequences, there are six unique crossover patterns, thus
there are a minimum of six circulating FIV-Fca env recombinant forms in NZ cats.
Within the env gene, we have identified several crossover
locations that are common to multiple samples. The most
common (shared by six recombinant sequences) is
located at the end of the V3 region of the gp120 surface
glycoprotein. Several synthetic amino acid sequences

from within the V3 region have been found to contain
neutralisation epitopes [23], one of which includes the
most common putative crossover site found in the present
study. This may suggest the importance of recombination
in viral neutralisation escape.
A second site, shared by two NZ A/C recombinant
sequences (214, MF14), and also two Portuguese B/A isolates (150_02LisP and 164_02UZP) [9] that we detected

recombination in, is at the start of the V4 region of the surface glycoprotein.
While the different subtypes involved in the recombination patterns from the V4 region suggest this crossover site
is a recombination hotspot, the former site from within
the V3 region is likely an ancestral recombination event
that is circulating in cat populations.

In comparison to env, only one putative recombinant
sequence (2.1%), from 48 sequences, was found in the gag
gene, with two crossover events. A previous study on FIV
in cats of Canada found four recombinants from 36
sequences (11%) – three A/B recombinants and one A/C
recombinant [6]. All four sequences had at least one crossover site in gag, but none of these were located at the same
site in the sequence as the gag crossovers that we found in
the NZ gag recombinant sequence.
A single (1.1%) putative intragenic B/U-NZpol1 recombinant was also identified in the pol gene, although 43
more samples were sequenced in this region than in gag.
The pol recombinant sequence is the only NZ recombinant we have identified with a subtype B section. Since
no subtype B has been found in NZ cats to date, we suggest that this recombinant sequence was imported into
NZ. This would mean that strains of the U-NZpol1 group
are circulating outside NZ. We feel this is plausible, given
the finding that Taiwanese gag sequences belong to the UNZgag group.
The lack of pol recombinants may be due to the shorter
length of the region that we sequenced for this gene, that
is, 524 bp compared to 1127 bp in gag, and 858 bp in env.
However, it is also important to note that the pol gene
encodes important viral enzymes, such as reverse transcriptase, thus is relatively conserved [24]. This leads to the
expectation of a low recombination rate in the pol gene. In
addition, it is also difficult to detect recombination in

The twelve NZ intragenic putative recombinants that we
have identified were almost exclusively found in companion cats. Due to the design of this study, we are unsure as
to why this could be; one hypothesis is that companion
cats may represent the reservoir pool of recombinants,
which have not yet spread extensively through the feral cat
populations. Alternatively, recombinant strains may be
more virulent than non-recombinant strains. Infection
with a circulating recombinant would result in death in
feral cats, while companion cats, with their generally
higher standard of living, remain alive but infected. While
these two hypotheses are plausible, we feel that neither is
fully adequate to explain the situation. A final potential
explanation is the sample used for each cat type. Lymph
nodes were used for feral cats while blood samples were
used for companion cats. This would need to be confirmed by comparing viral sequences in a putative recombinant cat from both lymph node and blood samples.
Putative intergenic recombination
We found three cases of statistically significant differences
between gene trees from the same sample, leading to the
conclusion that we have three putative intergenic recombinants. These putative intergenic recombination events
are between the gag and env gene regions sequenced in
this study.

The pol gene region of only 524 bp did not have enough
phylogenetic signal to elevate the power of the SH tests.
This is evident in the ML trees, where unresolved nodes
are seen. The lack of signal could be a result of the conserved nature of the pol gene, given that it encodes important enzymes.
The SH test also is known to be conservative [25]. We
likely added to this stringency with the criteria of both
reciprocal tests needing to be statistically significant to
recognise significance between the two trees involved.
However, in this case we feel it is better to be cautious in
designating intergenic recombinants.
Unknown subtype
The env unknown subtype samples that we previously
found [10] do not show the same pattern in the gag and
pol gene trees, and we cannot confirm the occurrence of a
novel NZ-specific subtype across the FIV genome. However, other groups of sequences of unknown subtypes are
seen in the gag (U-NZgag) and pol (U-NZpol1, U-NZpol2)
NJ trees. Endpoint dilution sequencing carried out on representatives of pol and env unknown samples confirms
that these are real proviral sequences and not artificial

PCR-mediated mosaics. Sequences of U-NZenv, U-NZgag
and U-NZpol2 are most closely related to reference subtype C, while sequences of U-NZpol1 are most closely
related to reference subtype A. In both the gag and the pol
genes, no NZ sequences group directly with the reference
subtype C sequences, although there are only three and
two C reference sequences in gag and pol, respectively. We
suggest that U-NZgag and U-NZpol2 represent divergent
subtype C viral strains. In the gag gene, this group also features Taiwan subtype C sequences, indicating a shared origin for NZ and Taiwan FIV and validating the authenticity
of our NZ sequences. Further sequencing of Pacific FIVFca isolates in this gene is required to confirm whether the
U-NZgag group is a Pacific-wide specific subtype.
We suggest that the patterns seen in the different gene
regions of the NZ unknown samples are the result of a
number of intergenic recombination events involving
known subtype A and undefined unknown subtype
strains. HIV-1 "subtype E" has a similar putative mosaic

structure and it has been suggested that the gag and pol
genes originate from subtype A while most of the env gene
and LTR's originate from an undefined subtype E parent
[21]. The FIV situation we see here is more complex than
the HIV-1 "subtype E" case because, firstly, we have
unknown groups in all three gene regions we have
sequenced, including two distinct unknown groups (UNZpol1 and U-NZpol2) in the pol gene, and secondly, we
have at least four different intergenic recombinant patterns across the three genes we have sequenced. Without
full-length proviral sequences, we cannot speculate on the
relationship between the unknown groups of the three
genes, that is, we are unsure of the number of parental
unknown strains represented. Indeed, the identified intergenic recombinant pattern of "unknown" in all three gene
regions may actually represent sequencing from the same
parent strain.
Endpoint dilution sequencing
All endpoint dilution sequences from putative recombinant samples grouped within 1.5% of each other and
the consensus sequence. However, this does not rule out
the possibility of recombination occurring in any of these
individuals, although our evidence points toward infection in these cats by circulating recombinant forms. With
two exceptions (see next section), all endpoint dilution
sequences from unknown subtype samples in the env and
pol genes grouped within 2.4% of each other and the consensus sequence. These results validate the authenticity of
the original consensus sequence, and provide no evidence
for synthetic PCR-mediated recombination.
Intrahost recombination
From endpoint dilution sequencing, an intrasubtype pol
recombinant sequence was identified in an individual,
which was also found to have both parent strains. The parent strains are quite distinct, although of the same subtype, indicating dual infection. This type of
recombination is difficult to detect, due to the high similarity of the sequences involved. This finding highlights
that there is a degree of intrasubtype recombination
occurring that largely goes unnoticed. Indeed, to our
knowledge, no other study has documented a naturallyoccurring dual infection of FIV that has resulted in recombination within the individual.

Another interesting result of endpoint dilution sequencing was the identification of dual infection in the env gene
of another cat, with subtypes C and unknown. Although
dual infection is widely accepted to be a prerequisite of
recombination, we found evidence of only this one intersubtype dual infection in our samples. In addition, no
recombinant sequences were identified from this duallyinfected cat.

Conclusion
The level of intergenic and intragenic recombination we
have found in NZ FIV-infected cats highlights the importance of recombination in the evolution of FIV-Fca.
Although this phenomenon has been suggested to occur
at a much slower rate than in HIV-1 [26], our results indicate that it may in fact be a more common occurrence,
especially given that a lot of recombination goes undetected.
In NZ, we have evidence of FIV-Fca sequences of
unknown subtypes in all three gag, pol and env genes.
However, the present study represents the most extensive
sequencing effort of FIV-Fca strains. Therefore, as
expected, and as has been found with increased sequencing of HIV-1 isolates [27,28], we find an increase in the
number of strains of unknown subtype. In order to obtain
a more accurate picture of recombination and unknown
subtype patterns, it is necessary to sequence multiple
genes and ideally, to obtain sequences of the whole FIV
genome.

Recombination can repair reverse transcription errors
[29], or can modify viral properties, such as fitness, as
found in HIV-1 BF recombinants circulating in Argentina
[30]. The event of recombination can also aid in adaptation to new environments, such as a new host species [31].
Finally, viral recombination increases the genetic diversity
of circulating viruses within a population. Results of the
present study have implications for the use of the current
FIV vaccine. Further testing of, and possibly modifications
to, the current vaccine may be needed to ensure protection
against circulating recombinant forms and novel subtypes.

Methods
A recent study [17] has documented two cases of A/C dual
infection in NZ cats, found by using different primers to
amplify overlapping sequences of the same samples. This
finding was explained by different subtype preferential
binding of the primers, with one primer set only amplifying subtype A. We have no reason to suspect preferential
subtype binding of the primers used in the present study,
given that both subtypes A and C are amplified with these.
However, as a confirmation of subtype designation with
our primers, we amplified the V3–V5 region of env from a
selection of 11 samples with different nested PCR primers,
as used by Duarte & Tavares (2006). All eleven sequences
grouped with the corresponding original sequence (data
not shown). While this finding corroborates our data, it

Sample collection
Lymph nodes from feral and stray cats, and blood samples
from companion cats were collected and processed as
described previously [10]. Further samples were collected
to give a total of 77 feral cat and 72 companion cat FIVinfected samples included in this study. No further stray
cat samples were collected, leaving only the seven stray cat
sequences from our previous study. For this study, feral
cats are defined as unowned cats that inhabit rural areas,
while stray cats inhabit urban areas. Companion cats are
owned and fully reliant on humans.
PCR amplification
The env gene was amplified using nested PCR, according
to published protocols [10,32]. In addition to the env
gene, a region of the gag gene [6] and a region of the pol

gene [33] were also directly sequenced for some samples
(Table 9). Forty-eight (32%) of the samples were amplified successfully with the gag primers and 91 (61%) were
amplified successfully with the pol primers. Sequencing
and sequence analyses were conducted as previously
described [10]. NZ sequences generated in this study were
deposited in GENBANK.
Phylogenetic analysis
Using PAUP* [34], a Neighbour-Joining (NJ) tree [35]
was constructed for each gene, with the best model of evolution for the data as determined by Modeltest 3.7 [36].
For env, gag and pol the optimum model was GTR+I+G.
Intragenic recombination identification
The NJ trees were used to visually identify sequences that
fall between subtypes (outliers), which were then tested
for recombination using Recombinant Identification Program 3.0 (RIP) [37,38]. A 200 bp sliding window was
used, with the threshold for significance set at 90%. Gaps
in the sequences were treated as characters and multistate
characters were scored as partial matches. Appropriate reference sequences were included in each RIP analysis.

Each outlier sequence was then split at the putative crossover points deduced from the RIP alignment output. In
PAUP* a maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed
using each sequence "half" and full-length reference
sequences, with a backbone tree of full-length reference
sequences constrained. The KH test [39,40], also implemented in PAUP*, was used to test for a significant difference between the two ML trees built from each sequence
"half" of each recombinant.
Intergenic recombination identification
Forty-five NZ cat samples were sequenced in all three gene
regions. Locations of each of these 45 samples on the different gene trees were compared. Six samples are identi-

fied as intragenic putative recombinant sequences in this
study and were removed from the data. This was done to
prevent a significant result caused by the intragenic
recombination event. Nine of our remaining samples
showed a discrepancy in subtype assignment between
gene trees, indicating intergenic recombination.
If there is no recombination, we expect that a single topology applies to all gene regions. The best candidate for this
topology is obtained by concatenating all gene alignments, and constructing a tree. We did this as follows. All
intergenic putative recombinant sequences were removed
from the data, leaving a total of 30 NZ sequences, from
which four ML trees (gag gene, pol gene, env gene and concatenation of all three genes) were constructed. Modeltest
output parameters were used (GTR+I+G for gag and concatenated, TrN+G for pol, TVM+I+G for env) in a heuristic
search with random sequence addition, ten replicates and
tree bisection reconnection as the branch-swapping algorithm. We used the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [41]
to determine whether the concatenated tree is an appropriate backbone constraint to control for sampling error
in the topologies of the three different gene regions. The
SH test was implemented in PAUP*, with full optimisation and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The null hypothesis in
an SH test is that all the trees being compared are just as
good at explaining the data as the true tree. A statistically
significant result rejects the null hypothesis, indicating
that the particular tree does not explain the data as well as
the best tree for that data set [25]. Four SH tests were run
– one for each data set (gag, pol, env and concatenated).
Therefore, a Bonferroni correction was applied.
SH test results showed that the concatenated tree is not
significantly different to the best tree for each gene data
set. A putative recombinant sequence was then added into
the data and four ML trees (gag gene, pol gene, env gene
and concatenation of all three genes) were estimated, with

the original concatenated tree constrained as a backbone.
A heuristic search was implemented, with random
sequence addition, ten replicates and tree bisection reconnection as the branch-swapping algorithm. Four ML trees
were constructed for each of the nine identified putative
intergenic recombinant sequences. Four data sets (168 pol,
WST05 concatenated, WST05 gag, 259 pol) returned multiple trees, but as these trees all had the same likelihood
score, one of the trees was randomly selected for use in
subsequent SH tests.
Since the concatenated tree is constrained as a backbone,
the only differences between the four ML trees are the
locations of the newly added putative intergenic recombinant sequence and the branch lengths. So, any statistical
significance found from the SH tests is a result of the location of the putative recombinant sequence. In this way, we
are testing the putative recombinant sequences for incongruence between the different gene regions. The SH test
was performed using PAUP* with full optimisation and
1000 bootstrap replicates, as described in Goldman et al.
(2000). For each of the putative recombinant sequences,
the SH test was run four times – once with each data set
(gag, pol, env, concatenated). A Bonferroni correction was
applied to correct for the multiple tests. A sequence was
designated an intergenic recombinant if the corresponding trees were significantly different statistically in both
reciprocal data set SH tests. With nine putative recombinants and four trees for each, a total of 36 SH tests were
run. Note that SH tests were run to compare all gene
regions, not just those we noticed an incongruency
between.

Endpoint dilution
Endpoint dilution sequencing [42,43] was undertaken as
described in Hayward et al. (2007) on representative intragenic putative recombinants and unknown subtype samples, for both the env and pol genes. Endpoint dilution was
also carried out on the putative recombinant sample of
the gag gene. This was done to confirm the consensus
sequences generated from direct sequencing as actual proviral sequences and not PCR-mediated recombinants as a
result of dual infection [44,45].
