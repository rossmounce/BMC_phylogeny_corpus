Abstract
Background: The fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene produces high levels of
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in axenic cultures and during plant infection. We generated a suppression
subtractive hybridization library enriched for IAA-induced genes and identified a clone, which was
highly expressed in IAA-containing medium.
Results: The corresponding gene showed similarity to oligopeptide transporters of the OPT family
and was therefore named CgOPT1. Expression of CgOPT1 in mycelia was low, and was enhanced by
external application of IAA. cgopt1-silenced mutants produced less spores, had reduced
pigmentation, and were less pathogenic to plants than the wild-type strain. IAA enhanced spore
formation and caused changes in colony morphology in the wild-type strain, but had no effect on
spore formation or colony morphology of the cgopt1-silenced mutants.
Conclusion: Our results show that IAA induces developmental changes in C. gloeosporioides. These
changes are blocked in cgopt1-silenced mutants, suggesting that this protein is involved in regulation
of fungal response to IAA. CgOPT1 is also necessary for full virulence, but it is unclear whether this
phenotype is related to auxin.

Background
Fungi can produce plant hormones in axenic cultures
when supplemented with the appropriate precursors [1].
For production of the hormone indole-3-acetic acid
(IAA), tryptophan must be supplied: no IAA is produced
without external tryptophan, and the amount of IAA
increases with increasing tryptophan concentrations [15].
Various effects of IAA on fungi have been reported. IAA
and gibberellic acid were reported to affect yeast sporula-

tion and cell elongation, but the effects of IAA were not
uniform and varied according to growth conditions, such
as vitamin content in the culture medium [6]. IAA also
induced invasive growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that it activates the pheromone MAP kinase pathway [7]. In Neurospora crassa, IAA reduced the 'spore
density effect' and germination occurred at high densities
in the presence of auxin [8]. In Aspergillus nidulans, IAA
partially restored cleistothecium formation and fertility of
a tryptophan-auxotrophic strain [9]. External application
of IAA has been shown to have various effects in addi-

tional fungal species, but it has been difficult to determine
whether the observed phenotypes represent the physiological effects of endogenous fungal IAA [1,10].

CgOPT1, a C. gloeosporioides IAA-responsive gene, which is
involved in mediating fungal responses to IAA.

Results
The possible role of fungal IAA in plant diseases is also
ambiguous. Auxin compounds produced by antagonistic
and pathogenic Pythium spp. were shown to stimulate
plant growth [11]. Pre-treatment of potato tubers at the
inoculation sites attenuated the extent of Fusarium eumartii damage and was correlated with a decrease in several of
the fungu's extracellular hydrolytic activities [12]. An IAAoverproducing strain of the mycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma
cylindrosporum had a more pronounced impact on Pinus
pinaster cortical cell elongation and radial diameter than
the wild-type strain [13]. It should be noted that in that
study IAA production was determined under culture conditions in the presence of high tryptophan concentrations
and in-planta production of IAA by the mycorrhizal fungus was not verified. IAA-overproducing Fusarium strains
were generated by expressing the bacterial iaaM and iaaH
genes in two species pathogenic to Orobanche [14]. The
transgenic strains produced more IAA in culture and demonstrated enhanced virulence on the host plants. Again,
in-planta production of IAA was not determined.
Most fungi produce IAA from the amino acid tryptophan
through the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPY) pathway [1].
Genes of the IPY pathway have been recently identified in
the smut fungus Ustilago maydis [15]. Two indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase genes (IAD1, IAD2) were identified and iad1iad2 mutant strains were produced. These
mutants were blocked in the conversion of both indole-3acetaldehyde and tryptamine to IAA. Furthermore, deletion of two aromatic amino acid aminotransferases
(TAM1 and TAM2, required for conversion of tryptophan
to IPY) in the iad1iad2 mutant background resulted in
a further decrease in IAA production. IAA levels were
reduced in plants infected with the mutant strains compared to wild-type infected plants, but tumor formation
was unaffected. Thus, although these results strongly suggest that U. maydis produces IAA within the plant, they do
not provide answers as to the possible role or effect of fungus-produced IAA on disease development.
We previously showed that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.
sp. aeschynomene (C. gloeosporioides) produces large quantities of IAA in axenic culture [16]. Unlike in other fungi,
the major IAA-biosynthesis pathway in C. gloeosporioides is
the bacterial indole-3-acetamide (IAM) pathway.
Although external addition of tryptophan was necessary
for the production of IAA in axenic cultures, in-planta production of IAA by the fungus was also demonstrated [17].
To gain insight into the possible roles of IAA, we developed a screen for auxin-induced genes in C. gloeosporioides.
Here we report the identification and characterization of

Isolation and characterization of CgOPT1
In search of IAA-induced fungal genes, a suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) library was prepared from
mycelia grown in media with (+) or without (-) IAA. Putative differential clones were sequenced and analyzed by
BlastX and their expression was verified by northern blot
analysis (data not shown). Only three clones showed consistent induction by IAA: Cas2 (accession no. FJ014488),
which showed homology to an integral membrane protein (92% similarity and 72% identity to Aspergillus clavatus EAW10960.1), Cas51, which showed homology to an
oligopeptide transporter (OPT; detailed in this report),
and Cas95 (accession no. FJ014489), which showed
homology to a sugar transporter (92% similarity and 88%
identity to Pyrenophora tritici-repens EDU43724.1). The
Cas51 clone was further characterized.

The full-length sequence of the Cas51 EST was obtained.
BlastX analysis showed strong homology to OPTs from
various organisms: Schizosaccharomyces pombe Isp4 (accession no. CAC05511.1, 59% similarity and 40% identity),
Aspergillus oryzae Opt (BAE60512.1, 64% similarity and
48% identity), Neurospora crassa Isp4-like (EAA35341.1,
66% similarity and 47% identity), and Candida albicans
Opt1 (EAK99338.1, 60% similarity and 42% identity). In
addition, the Cas51 predicted protein contained 14 transmembrane-spanning domains and the consensus
sequence SPYxEVRxxVxxxDDP (Fig. 1A, B), both of which
have been found in all previously described OPTs [18].
An unrooted parsimony-based phylogenetic tree grouped
Cas51 with OPTs and OPT-like proteins from other fungi
(Fig. 1C). OPTs from several other fungi and some plants
are grouped in distinct clades, while the other type of peptide transporter (PTR2) is grouped in a separate clade.
These analyses clearly demonstrated that the predicted
peptide belongs to the OPT family and that it encodes for
a putative oligopeptide transporter. The gene was therefore named CgOPT1 for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides OPT
(accession no. FJ008981). The predicted protein contains
752 amino acids, has a predicted mass of 84.9 kDa, and a
pI of 8.89. The gene includes three exons separated by two
introns of 58 and 73 bp.
Induction of CgOPT1 gene expression by IAA
Expression of CgOPT1 was below detection levels in resting spores, strongly enhanced during spore germination
and then reduced again to basal levels during mycelia
development (Fig. 2A). Addition of IAA to the mycelia
enhanced CgOPT1 gene expression, confirming transcriptional activation by auxin (Fig. 2B).

media supplemented with various concentrations of IAA. GFP levels were evaluated 48 h after culture inoculation. Control (0)
contained an equal volume of ethanol. Low magnification image is presented as inset in each frame. The portion of the colony
that is presented in higher magnification is designated by a small square within each inset. Bars = 20 m.

Further expression analyses were performed using a transgenic strain of C. gloeosporioides, Popt-gfp6, in which the
GFP reporter gene is regulated by the CgOPT1 promoter.
The GFP signal in spores was enhanced during germination with a peak at 12 h and then it decreased, similar to
gene-expression results obtained by northern blot analysis
(data not shown). To evaluate the response to auxin, the
Popt-gfp6-transgenic isolate was grown in Czapek Dox
(CD) medium supplemented with IAA and the GFP signal
was monitored 48 h after culture inoculation. GFP fluorescence was enhanced by IAA in a concentration-dependent manner, with saturation at 250 M IAA (Fig. 2C). No
change in GFP fluorescence was detected in media supplemented only with ethanol (the solvent used to dissolve
IAA).

gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene, mutants were generated

by RNA silencing. The wild-type strain was co-transformed with the RNAi cassette OptRi and the gGFP plasmid [19], which was used to confer resistance to
hygromycin B. Some of the hygromycin-resistant colonies
showed discoloration and reduced sporulation. Spores
were collected from culture plates of these isolates and
germinated for 9 h in pea extract, conditions under which
CgOPT1 gene expression is normally high (Fig. 2A). Variable levels of reduced CgOPT1 expression were noted in
all isolates (Fig. 3). The phenotype of the cgopt1-silenced
mutants was determined using isolates Ori51 and Ori83.
Pathogenicity
Spore-inoculation experiments were performed using several spore dilutions: 104, 5 × 104, and 105 spores/ml. In all
experiments, the cgopt1-silenced mutants caused delayed
and reduced symptoms compared to wild-type-infected
plants (Fig. 4). For example, in a typical experiment using
104 spores/ml, the wild-type-infected plants developed
severe symptoms 5 days post-inoculation, and all six
plants died after 8 days, whereas four out of six Ori51- or

Ori83-infected plants showed only minor or no symptoms.
Pigmentation and sporulation
The cgopt1-silenced mutants showed several morphological differences compared to the wild-type strain. When
grown on solid regeneration (REG) medium, they produced more aerial hyphae than the wild-type cultures and
failed to accumulate the typical orange pigment (Fig. 5A).
The mutants also produced fewer spores than the wild
type (Fig. 5B). The differences in sporulation between the

wild-type and mutant strains were more significant in
young cultures and decreased after longer periods of culturing, suggesting delayed sporulation rather than a direct
effect on spore formation.

and then kept in a humid atmosphere for 16 h. Picture was

To further characterize the sporulation defects in the
cgopt1-silenced mutants, we compared sporulation in
complete darkness: the wild type is known to produce less
spores when grown in the dark vs. in the light. Under conditions of complete darkness, the wild type and cgopt1silenced mutants produced similar numbers of spores,
lower than the number of spores produced in the light
(Fig. 6A). Thus, only light-induced sporulation was
affected in the mutants, while sporulation in the dark was
unaffected.

Next we tested the possible effect of IAA on sporulation.
Wild-type and mutant strains were cultured on media
with 500 M IAA. The plates were kept in the dark to prevent photo-oxidation of IAA, and to eliminate lightinduced differences in sporulation between the wild type
and mutants. IAA significantly enhanced sporulation in
wild-type cultures under these conditions, while it had no
effect on sporulation of the cgopt1-silenced mutants (Fig.
6B). Furthermore, the effect of IAA on sporulation in wildtype cultures was dose-dependent: a small increase in
spore production was observed at 100 M IAA, and production was further enhanced by 250 M and 500 M IAA
(Fig. 6C). No change was observed in the sporulation of
the mutants, regardless of IAA concentration. These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/173

results showed a clear and consistent phenotype caused
by IAA, which is abolished in the cgopt1-silenced mutants.
Colony morphology
While characterizing the transcriptional response to IAA,
we noticed the development of more compact mycelium
in the presence of auxin. To further examine this phenotype, we tested the effect of IAA on the development of
mycelia in liquid culture. In REG medium, the wild-type
colonies accumulated intense orange pigmentation, while
the silenced mutants developed a very pale orange color
(Fig. 7, top). This phenotype was similar to that observed
on solid REG plates (Fig. 5A). IAA greatly reduced pigmentation in wild-type cultures, whereas it had no effect

indeed an oligopeptide transporter and to find substrate
specificity.

A difference was noted in the morphology of wild-type
and mutant colonies. In REG medium, the wild type
developed pellets surrounded by long hyphae, which
became more compact with shorter hyphae when IAA was
added (Fig. 7, middle). Under these conditions, the
cgopt1-silenced mutants developed compact pellets without free hyphae, and this morphology did not change in
the presence of IAA. In CD medium, the wild type developed more compact pellets than in REG medium, which
became even denser in the presence of IAA (Fig. 7, bottom). The cgopt1-silenced mutants developed pellets with
very long hyphae (hairy pellets) in CD medium and again,
this morphology was not altered by IAA. Thus, the wildtype isolate developed more condensed pellets in IAAcontaining media, while the morphology of the cgopt1silenced mutants differed from the wild type, and was
unaffected by IAA.

In S. cerevisiae, there are two genetically and physiologically distinct proton-coupled peptide transporter systems:
the PTR (peptide transport) and the OPT (oligopeptide
transport) protein families. Members of the PTR and OPT
families differ in function and they do not share significant sequence homology (see Fig. 1C). PTR proteins are
common in all organisms and transport di- or tripeptides.
OPT proteins are found only in plants and fungi and
transport 4- and 5-amino-acid peptides [22,23]. Metabolically, the transport of small oligopeptides is important as
an amino acid, carbon, and nitrogen source [23]. Therefore, silencing of CgOPT1 would be expected to reduce the
uptake of nutrients from proteinaceous sources, which
might have an effect on growth and development. Further,
CgOPT1 might facilitate incorporation of metabolites or
small peptides that can be used as signalling molecules
e.g., during plant infection.

Discussion

CgOPT1 was activated in the presence of IAA in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcription was already
enhanced at 50 M IAA and was further enhanced at
higher concentrations, with saturation at 500 M. These
concentrations are much higher than the IAA levels in
plants but are within the range of IAA amounts produced
by C. gloeosporioides [16]. Lack of activation by acetic acid,
indole-3-ethanol (tryptophol) or tryptamine ruled out
possible activation of CgOPT1 by auxin-induced changes
in pH, or as a general response to indoles. Nevertheless, at
this stage it is impossible to determine whether up-regulation of CgOPT1 in the presence of IAA is a direct response
to IAA or rather, an indirect response to other changes that
might be brought about by IAA. Further, induction by IAA
does not necessarily imply that it would be involved in
IAA transport, especially because C. gloeosporioides produces large quantities of IAA, so induction might be
through endogenous rather than exogenous IAA.

In a previous report, we showed that C. gloeosporioides produces auxin both in culture and in planta [16,17]. This
raised the possibility of auxin involvement in the regulation of fungal development and pathogenicity, and of the
existence of auxin-responsive genes regulating fungal
responses to IAA. As a first step towards identifying the
putative IAA-responsive fungal genes, we constructed a
SSH library using mycelia from auxin-containing medium
as the tester. Under culture conditions, over 95% of the
IAA that is produced by C. gloeosporioides is secreted into
the medium [20]. We therefore used a relatively high IAA
concentration (500 M), assuming that the endogenous
concentrations would be at least 10-fold lower. We also
added 500 M IAM, the intermediate product of IAA production in C. gloeosporioides [17]. The SSH yielded limited
information on putative IAA-induced genes since only
three clones showed consistent induction by IAA. Thus,
although putative IAA-induced genes were identified, the
results from the SSH approach do not support a massive
change in gene transcription by IAA. However, the
number of genes that could be tested by SSH was limited
and more conclusive results might be obtained through
robust transcript analysis using microarrays when such
tools become available in C. gloeosporioides.
CgOPT1 exhibited consistent induction by IAA and was
therefore further analyzed. Characterization of the gene as
a putative OPT was strongly supported by its overall
homology to other OPTs, as well as by the presence of the
conserved SPYxEVRxxVxxxDDP sequence and 14 transmembrane domains, which are common to all OPTs
[18,21,22]. Further analyses, including complementation
of yeast mutants, are needed to determine that CgOPT1 is

In addition to the IAA-induced transcription of CgOPT1,
the gene was differentially expressed during fungal development, particularly during spore germination. CgOPT1
transcript could not be detected in resting spores, it was
highly induced during germination, and then it declined
during mycelium formation. This expression pattern is
opposite to that of the vacuolar copper-transporting gene
CgCTR2, which is necessary for the initial stages of germination and is highly expressed in resting spores and
down-regulated immediately after spore germination
[24]. Therefore, CgOpt1 is probably important during
germ-tube formation and elongation, but is not required
for the initiation of spore germination. Silencing of the
gene provided additional evidence for the involvement of
CgOptT1 in development as well as pathogenicity: cgopt1-

silenced mutants displayed reduced sporulation and pigmentation, and were less pathogenic than the wild-type
strain. These pleiotropic effects suggest association of
CgOpt1 with several different processes.
IAA appears to have an enhancing effect on processes such
as sporulation, spore germination, and germ-tube elongation. However, the effects of IAA vary with experimental
conditions, and opposite results might be obtained. In
our sporulation assay, we took special care to eliminate
possible interference and side effects from experimental
parameters such as solvent, medium, or light. IAA was
applied to filter paper, the ethanol was evaporated, and
then the filter was placed between two layers of agar to
avoid direct contact with the fungus. Additionally,
because sporulation is enhanced by light, the experiments
were conducted under both light and dark conditions.
Under both conditions, we observed consistent and significant enhancement of sporulation in the wild type by
IAA (Fig. 6). This procedure therefore provided a reliable
assay for the determination of responses to IAA in the wild
type and cgopt1-silenced mutants.
The cgopt1-silenced mutants exhibited reduced sporulation compared to the wild type when grown in the light.
This difference was not observed in the dark, where both
the wild type and mutants produced reduced, but equal
numbers of spores (Fig. 6A). Thus, CgOpt1 is probably
associated only with light-dependent sporulation, and is
not required for light-independent sporulation. However,
IAA had no effect on sporulation in the mutants, unlike
the significant enhancement of sporulation observed in
the wild-type strain. These results suggest that IAA and
light enhance sporulation through different pathways,
and that CgOpt1 is associated with the IAA-dependent
pathway, but not the light-dependent one. In addition,
morphological differences were observed between the
wild type and cgopt1 mutants when grown in liquid culture, and the addition of IAA induced morphological
changes in the wild type, but had almost no effect on the
mutants (Fig. 7). Thus both sporulation and pellet morphology, which differ between the wild type and cgopt1silenced mutants, are affected by IAA in the wild type but
not in the cgopt1 mutants. These results suggest that
CgOpt1 might be associated with developmental pathways that are also affected by IAA. The abolishment of a
response to IAA in the cgopt1 mutants is surprising and
further research is needed to determine the connection
between CgOPT1 and IAA.

Conclusion
Although fungi are capable of producing IAA, its purpose,
if any, is unclear. Here we present evidence that IAA promotes sporulation and causes changes in growth morphology in the fungal plant pathogen C. gloeosporioides.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/173

These results suggest the importance of IAA to fungal
development and reproduction. In addition, we identified
an IAA-responsive gene which appears to be involved in
mediating IAA's effects. At this stage however, the underlying mechanism is unknown and further investigation is
needed.

Methods

100 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Fungi were cultured under
continuous fluorescent light as previously described [25].
For liquid cultures, 50 ml medium was inoculated with
107 spores that were collected from a 5-day-old colony.
The flasks were placed on a rotary shaker (180 rpm) and
incubated at 28°C. Three separate flasks were used for
each treatment, and the experiments were repeated at least
three times.
Construction of SSH library
Spores of C. gloeosporioides were collected from 5-day-old
culture plates and germinated in pea extract for 4 h. Germinated spores were washed once with sterile water and
then transferred to 250-ml flasks containing 50 ml CD
medium or CD supplemented with 500 M each of IAM
and IAA (Sigma-Aldrich). The flasks were incubated with
agitation for 24 h after which the mycelium was collected
and its RNA extracted. Total RNA and mRNA were
extracted using Sigma GenElute mammalian total RNA
miniprep kit and GenElute mRNA miniprep kit, respectively. The PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech)
was used to produce an SSH library containing putative
IAA-induced clones. The final PCR products were cloned
into pTZ57R vector (Fermentas). Single colonies were collected and PCR was performed on 76 colonies using the
nested 1 (5'-TCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3'),
nested 2R (5'-AGCGTGGTCGCGGCCGAGGTAAA-3')
primers from the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit. Thirtyfive clones were sequenced resulting in 24 different ORFs.
DNA of the corresponding ESTs was amplified by PCR,
separated on a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto a Hybond-N+
membrane (Amersham) and hybridized with 32P-labeled
cDNA probes that were generated from IAA-exposed [(+)
probe] and IAA-unexposed [(-) probe] mycelium. Clones
that differentially hybridized only with the (+) probe were
analyzed by northern blot hybridization.

Northern blot analysis
Total RNA (2 to 5 g) was used for northern blot analysis.
Samples were separated on a formaldehyde denaturing
1% agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane.
DNA fragments of C. gloeosporioides ribosomal 18s gene
were amplified by PCR from C. gloeosporioides genomic
DNA using the primer 5'CGGAGAAGGAGCCTGAG/
GGCCCAAGGTTCAACTACGAG-3'. cDNA probes were
radiolabeled with 32P-dCTP and hybridized to the membranes according to standard protocols.
Isolation of CgOPT1
CgOPT1 genomic DNA was isolated using the Universal
Genome Walker kit (Clontech). Two rounds of PCR were
performed using ExTaq enzyme (TaKaRa), first with
primer CAS 51-GW-rev (5'-CTCGTAGACGAAAGTACTGGCACC-3') and then with primer CAS 51-GW-rev2 (5'TCGTCGAAGGGTTGGACCTGCGC-3'). PCR products
obtained by this procedure were cloned into the pTZ57R
A/T cloning vector and sequenced.
Plasmid construction
Plasmid Popt-gfp was constructed for expression of GFP
under control of the CgOPT1 promoter. A 1.5-kb region
upstream of the CgOPT1 start codon was amplified by
PCR, introducing a 5' BglII restriction site and a 3' NcoI
restriction site. The fragment was inserted into a gGFP
plasmid at BglII/NcoI, replacing the gpd promoter
upstream of GFP [19]. Popt-gfp was co-transformed into
C. gloeosporioides together with the pAN701 plasmid
which carries the hygromycin-resistance cassette. Plasmid
OptRi was constructed for RNAi-mediated silencing of
CgOPT1. Two DNA fragments corresponding to bases
1100–2000 (up-Ri) and 1100–1700 (down-Ri) of the
CgOPT1 gene were amplified by PCR and cloned into vector pTZ57. The up-Ri fragment was cloned into the SphI/
SpeI site of the pTZ57-down-Ri plasmid. The plasmid was
cut with BamHI/BglII and the fragment was cloned into
BamHI of vector ksgt between the gpd promoter and TrpC
terminator, resulting in plasmid OptRi. The OptRi plasmid was transformed into C. gloeosporioides together with
the gGFP vector, which confers resistance to hygromycin.
Fungal transformation
Fungal transformation was performed by electroporation
of germinated spores as previously described [20]. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were collected and the presence
of either Popt-gfp or OptRi plasmid was verified by PCR.
Transgenic isolates obtained with the Popt-gfp plasmid
were compared and detailed analyses were performed
with isolate Popt-gfp6. For OptRi, isolates containing the
silencing cassette were propagated and the expression levels of CgOPT1 were compared. Detailed analyses were carried out with isolates Ori51 and Ori83, which gave similar
results in all cases.

Sporulation assay
Fungi were cultured on CD or EMS plates. For media with
IAA, the calculated amount of IAA was dissolved in ethanol and applied on a Whatman filter paper, the ethanol
was air-dried and then the filter was placed between two
layers of agar medium. Plates were prepared 1 day before
inoculation to allow diffusion of IAA into the medium.
Control plates were prepared in a similar fashion with filters containing an equivalent volume of air-dried ethanol.
Each plate was inoculated with a 3-mm2 mycelium cube
that was excised from a 5-day-old culture. After 5 days, the
spores were washed from the plates and counted. Three
plates were used as replicates in each experiment and all
experiments were repeated several times. Data are the
mean results of three experiments.
Plant inoculation
Inoculation experiments were performed with 12-day-old
Aeschynomene virginica plants as described previously [26].
Plants were sprayed to runoff with spore suspension containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Control plants were
sprayed with similar volumes of 0.05% Tween 20. Six
plants per treatment were used as replicates in each experiment and all experiments were repeated several times.
Symptoms were recorded and fresh weight determined 6
days post-inoculation.
Microscopy
Fluorescent and light microscopy were performed with a
Zeiss Axioskop 2 epifluorescent microscope, or with an
Olympus SZX 12 fluorescent stereoscope equipped with
an eGFP filter. Confocal microscopy was performed with
a Zeiss CLSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope.
Computational analysis
CgOPT1 homologous sequences were identified by
BlastpX [27] analyses at the NCBI database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. For details of species and
retrieved sequences see Additional file 1 and Additional
file 2. Multiple alignments were performed by the ClustalW program [28]. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted
with the PHYLIP package [29], available online at http://
mobyle.pasteur.fr. The phylogenetic tree was based on a
parsimony analysis using the Protpars program and subsequently drawn with the Drawtree program.

Data were analyzed by t-test at a significance level of P <
0.05, using the Microsoft Office Excel software package.
Accession number
The GenBank accession number for the CgOPT1 gene analyzed in this study is FJ008981.
