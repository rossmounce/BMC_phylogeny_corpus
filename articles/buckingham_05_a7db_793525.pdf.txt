Abstract
Background: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric proteins that are
important drug targets for a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and various
forms of epilepsy. One of the most intensively studied nAChR subunits in recent years has been
α7. This subunit can form functional homomeric pentamers (α7)5, which can make interpretation
of physiological and structural data much simpler. The growing amount of structural,
pharmacological and physiological data for these receptors indicates the need for a dedicated and
accurate database to provide a means to access this information in a coherent manner.
Description: A7DB http://www.lgics.org/a7db/ is a new relational database of manually curated
experimental physiological data associated with the α7 nAChR. It aims to store as much of the
pharmacology, physiology and structural data pertaining to the α7 nAChR. The data is accessed via
web interface that allows a user to search the data in multiple ways: 1) a simple text query 2) an
incremental query builder 3) an interactive query builder and 4) a file-based uploadable query. It
currently holds more than 460 separately reported experiments on over 85 mutations.
Conclusions: A7DB will be a useful tool to molecular biologists and bioinformaticians not only
working on the α7 receptor family of proteins but also in the more general context of nicotinic
receptor modelling. Furthermore it sets a precedent for expansion with the inclusion of all nicotinic
receptor families and eventually all cys-loop receptor families.

Background
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are the most
studied members of the cys-loop family of ligand-gated
ion channels (LGICs) which also contains γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) receptors, glycine receptors and 5-HT3 recep-

tors [1]. Distinct subtypes of nAChRs mediate, for example, fast synaptic transmission in the brain and at
neuromuscular junctions [2]. All are believed to be pentameric assemblies of various combinations of different
subunits (α, β, γ/ε, δ), some of which exist as multiple

access functional data and relate it back, wherever possible, to structural data.

Construction and content

The database is currently limited to nAChR α7 subunits.
This makes the initial task of populating the database
manageable. To allow 3rd level normalization, the principal information prototype stored in the database is
referred to as an "experiment event". An experiment event
is a collection of simultaneous measurements and their
associated measurement conditions. For example, two
drugs tested against the wild type α7 and a mutant under
the same experimental conditions would be described by
4 (2 drugs × 2 sequences) experiment events. If the identical measurements were repeated in, say, calcium-free
saline, this would yield 8 experiment events. Using this
prototype a unique set of experimental conditions is associated with a single set of data. Therefore, the database
tables (see Figure 1) have been designed around the central experiment table [see Additional file 1]. Quite often,
several real experiments are performed within any one
publication. We wanted to capture all of that data. Thus,
all the data for one experiment that was reported have
been stored (non-redundantly) as a separate entity. The
database is managed by the MySQL relational database
management system. PHP scripts query the MySQL system and transform the data into HTML pages for serving
to the client.

to an experiment is stored within a single table called "experiment". The sequence table stores all the wildtype sequences

isoforms [3]. nAChRs are important targets for novel analgesics as well as new drugs being devised for Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia [4,5]. Mutations in nAChRs are
associated with certain forms of epilepsy [6,7] and several
congenital myasthenias [8]. There is a substantial and
growing body of physiological, pharmacological,
genomic structural and modeling data on receptors
formed from these subunits. The volume and diversity of
these data present severe challenges for their efficient storage and interpretation. Here we describe a relational database, initially relating to the α7 subunit, whose aim is to
provide an easy to use, extensible web-based interface to

The database currently aims to store molecular information rather than whole-organism genetic information
which can be sourced from elsewhere, see for example
[9,10]. A typical set of experiments reported in one paper
might concern the properties of one mutation at a particular position and its associated changes in physiology
and/or pharmacology. All of this data is held in the
database.
By use of appropriate alignments (either stored within the
server or uploaded) the positions of these data can be
highlighted on a homology model based on the acetylcholine binding protein AChBP [11]. The model is viewable by either using the Chime plugin, or by setting the
browser to use Rasmol as a helper application. User
instructions for configuring different browsers are provided on the server, as well as the list of combinations of
operating system and browser that we have tested to date.
For any database, data integrity will ultimately determine
its usefulness. The initial population of the database has
been carried out by the authors, but it is desirable and
practical in the long term to have a procedure whereby
any laboratory can submit data. To help ensure reliable
deposition procedure, each depositor will have a unique
identifier (thus making the data accountable). A depositor

will submit their data which is then tabulated and presented as a form which the depositor is then asked to confirm as being correct. Only when this confirmation is
received is the data committed to the database. Although
this will reduce some entry-based mistakes, the database
will nonetheless need to be curated to maintain integrity.
The database does not attempt to duplicate the functionality of other databases. For example we store a local
alignment of α7 subunits taken directly from pfam [12],
but we do not perform any alignments ourselves. Such
tools are already available on numerous web-servers and
in any case the user may wish to upload their own alignment. Wherever possible, we link to a well-established
resource, as is the practice in for example, SWISS-PROT
[13].

Utility and discussion
Access to the database is through various routes. The first
route is by a very simple search string (e.g. citation =
Smith*). The user is then presented with a page informing
him of the number of hits and asking what information
should be displayed from those hits. The second is a simple incremental search in which the user applies criteria
sequentially until he chooses to examine the results. As
the query is built, the number of hits returned by the
query in its current state is shown. The third search
method is also incremental but via the use of a set of
tabbed pages which divide the information into intuitive
categories such as pharmacology and physiology. Additionally, the user can make choices about alignments used
and even upload their own. As the query is built, summary
information of its status is also displayed. The fourth
method to access the data is provided by a 'fast lane' route
which provides more experienced users with a quicker
and more direct route to the data of interest. The user formulates and constructs a query offline and then uploads
it as a simple ASCII file. A sample query form and details
of the format are presented in the supplementary
information.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/6/2

The current database has been designed such that it could
easily be extended to include other nAChR subunits and
then on to other members of the cys-loop ligand-gated
ion channel family. We are currently pursuing this aspect.
Such expansion will allow trends that link structure to
function in this receptor family to be more readily
identified.
The database is very complementary to some existing
resources, in particular the LGICdb [14,15]. This database
contains sequence, phylogenetic data and sets of coordinates, but does not attempt to store all aspects of individual experiments as we report here. However, this could be
used in conjunction with our database to for example
explore equivalent positions in related receptors using
sequence and phylogenetic information stored therein.
Our approach is somewhat similar to that employed by
the ProTherm database [16] which aims to store thermodynamic data for mutant and wildtype proteins [17].
Although currently there are no entries common to both
databases, it is envisaged that thermodynamic data
reported for either the α7 nAChR receptor or related channels will appear in the ProTherm database and can thus be
used in conjunction with the A7DB to help illustrate for
example how loss of function might be related to protein
stability. Furthermore, the similarity in design of these
databases should make cross-interrogation possible in the
future. We should state that the main difference between
A7DB and ProTherm is that instead of thermodynamic
data we store pharmacological and physiological data and
in that sense it is closer to the voltage-gated potassium
channel database [18,19]. Finally, the A7DB is also complementary to the Protein Mutant Database [20] where
mutations across many proteins are stored but the searching and data tabulation is primarily text-based. This might
be particularly useful if another mutation had been
reported in a different protein that bound a similar ligand,
for example in acetylcholine also binds to acetylcholinesterase, which we do not store data for.

Conclusions
The result of a query is presented in tabular form. Only the
information requested is actually presented with the
option for further or refined searches. In addition to this,
the results of any position matches can be displayed via
the homologous 3-dimensional structure of the AChBP.
This is automatically available if the user selects the alignments available from the server. If the user uploads their
own alignment the model will only be produced if AChBP
was included. The server streams a Rasmol script or
spawns a Chime window depending on browser configuration. In addition to these query routes, the user is also
able to browse the contents of the database.

We have shown here how the collation and careful storage
of experimental data pertaining to one sub-family (the α7
nAChR sub-family) of the ligand-gated ion channels can
be assembled into a useful resource. However, the real
power of the database will be when it is combined with
machine-learning technologies to explore complex relationships between sequence, structure and function [21].
We believe that this resource will grow in usefulness as the
amount of data increases. For example, during the construction of this database, atomic coordinates were
released for the transmembrane region of the nAChR from
Torpedo marmorata [22]. Its development is particularly
timely given these recent structural developments which
allow three-dimensional information to be correlated

experimental data.
