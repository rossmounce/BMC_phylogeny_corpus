Abstract
Background: Maternally transmitted symbionts have evolved a variety of ways to promote their
spread through host populations. One strategy is to hamper the reproduction of uninfected females
by a mechanism called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI occurs in crosses between infected
males and uninfected females and leads to partial to near-complete infertility. CI-infections are
under positive frequency-dependent selection and require genetic drift to overcome the range of
low frequencies where they are counter-selected. Given the importance of drift, population subdivision would be expected to facilitate the spread of CI. Nevertheless, a previous model concluded
that variance in infection between competing groups of breeding individuals impedes the spread of
CI.
Results: In this paper we derive a model on the spread of CI-infections in populations composed
of demes linked by restricted migration. Our model shows that population sub-division facilitates
the invasion of CI. While host philopatry (low migration) favours the spread of infection, deme size
has a non-monotonous effect, with CI-invasion being most likely at intermediate deme size.
Individual-based simulations confirm these predictions and show that high levels of local drift speed
up invasion but prevent high levels of prevalence across the entire population. Additional
simulations with sex-specific migration rates further show that low migration rates of both sexes
are required to facilitate the spread of CI.
Conclusion: Our analyses show that population structure facilitates the invasion of CI-infections.
Since some level of sub-division is likely to occur in most natural populations, our results help to
explain the high incidence of CI-infections across species of arthropods. Furthermore, our work
has important implications for the use of CI-systems in order to genetically modify natural
populations of disease vectors.

Background
Vertically transmitted symbionts are common in nature.
They are of diverse phylogenetic origin, comprising
viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, and reside in an
equally diverse range of hosts, including both animals
and plants[1-5]. Many vertically transmitted symbionts
live inside the host cytoplasm and accordingly their transmission is strictly maternal. For these symbionts to spread
through a host population, the number of infected daughters produced by an infected female must exceed the
number of daughters produced on average in the population. Symbionts have evolved a number of strategies to
achieve this goal. Some, such as secondary symbionts of
aphids, are beneficial and increase the host's overall fitness through a positive effect on fecundity or survival
[6,7]. Others spread by biasing the sex ratio of their host
towards females. This strategy is common in symbionts of
arthropods, which achieve sex ratio distortion by inducing
parthenogenesis, feminizing genetic males, or selectively
eliminating male hosts [2,8]. A third strategy differs fundamentally from the previous two in that it promotes
infection indirectly by impeding the reproduction of
uninfected female hosts rather than affecting that of
infected ones [8-10]. This is achieved through a mechanism called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) which
appears to have evolved at least twice independently in
two bacterial symbionts of arthropods, Wolbachia [11]
and Cardinium [12]. Incompatibility is presumably caused
by a modification in the sperm of infected males that
causes increased zygote mortality unless rescued by a symbiont present in the egg [2]. CI therefore specifically targets the fecundity of uninfected hosts.
Cytoplasmic incompatibility benefits infected individuals
by reducing the fecundity of uninfected females in a targeted way. This reduction increases the relative fitness of
infected females, i.e., their fecundity measured relative to
the average fecundity in the population. The degree to
which CI increases the relative fitness of infected depends
on the frequency of incompatible matings, making selection on CI frequency-dependent [9,13-16]. Whether CI is
selectively favored depends on the balance between the
increase in relative fitness of infecteds due to CI and forces
that act against its spread, namely a fecundity cost of bearing an infection and imperfect transmission of the symbiont. In the presence of a cost of infection and/or imperfect
transmission, an unstable infection equilibrium exists
(often referred to as the 'invasion threshold'), separating
the lower frequency range in which infection is counterselected and the higher frequency range where it is
selected for.
For symbionts to spread in a host population, infection
frequency has to exceed the unstable equilibrium. Many
authors have therefore made the verbal argument that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/134

random genetic drift would be required for the successful
spread of CI-symbionts [9,17]. Egas et al. [17] tested this
conjecture in computer simulations that determined the
probability of CI spread in random mating populations of
different sizes (and hence subject to varying levels of
genetic drift). The authors concluded that random drift
was unlikely to drive infection frequency beyond the invasion threshold and allow it to go to fixation. This result is
at odds with the high number of species that have been
found to be infected with CI-inducing parasites [see [18]
for a review]. Egas et al. therefore conclude that in addition to CI, infection spread is driven by factors such as
other reproductive manipulations, effects of infection on
the population sex ratio or other fitness-compensating
effects [17].
The conclusion of Egas et al.'s seems pessimistic for the
spread of CI infection in panmictic populations of large
size. However, their data also show that CI can spread
with considerable probabilities when populations are
small. This raises the possibility that the spread of CI
might be facilitated if a large population is subdivided
into a number of discrete demes that are linked by migration. Population sub-division is known to induce
increased levels of local genetic drift, which could drive
infection frequency beyond the invasion threshold within
demes. Despite its clear relevance, the effect of genetic
drift on CI spread in sub-divided population has found
little treatment in the theoretical literature. Some studies
have analyzed CI-dynamics either in continuous [19] or
discrete space [20], but have done so using deterministic
models which ignore the stochastic effect due to drift. The
only model including drift (and only implicitly) has come
to the surprising prediction that population structure
would impede the spread of infection. In this model,
Wade and Stevens [21] assume that hosts aggregate in
groups to mate and reproduce before being mixed and
compete at the scale of the whole metapopulation. Frequency change of CI was then calculated as a function of
the variance in infection frequency between breeding
groups. Wade and Stevens showed that increasing this variance, as would happen because of drift or if infection
appeared in a subset of the groups, raised the invasion
threshold and reduced the per-generation change in average infection frequency across groups.
Motivated by the discrepancy between biological intuition and theoretical prediction, we present here a new
analysis of CI dynamics in sub-divided host populations.
We first derive an analytical model which illustrates the
different components of the selection pressure acting on a
CI phenotype and how they are affected by population
sub-division. This model allows us to derive the conditions under which a rare infection can spread in a population and to determine the expected equilibrium infection

frequency. We complement the analytical model with
individual-based simulations. These relax some of the
simplifying assumptions made in the model and generate
predictions for more complex population structures.

Results
Analytical model
Similar to previous models treating the panmictic case we
will ignore the dynamics of symbiont populations within
individual hosts and concentrate on the presence or
absence of parasite infection. This allows us to conveniently model the spread of infection as a two state model
in which individuals are in one of the two states 'infected'
and 'uninfected'. Transmission of infection state is purely
maternal, resembling symbiont transmission in natural
host populations. Vertical transmission of infection is
assumed to be perfect and all offspring of infected mothers are infected. This assumption is justified because natural parasites causing CI usually show high rates of vertical
transmission [9], but is relaxed in simulations presented
below.

We assume that hosts live in a population composed of an
infinite number of demes, each containing a finite
number N of breeding males and N females (i.e., infinite
island model assumptions). Hosts are diploid and
semelparous (no overlapping generations) and undergo
the following lifecycle: (1) Adult hosts mate randomly
within demes. (2) Adult hosts reproduce. Each female
produces a large number of offspring that is a function of
the infection status of her and her mating partner. The
fecundity of an uninfected female mated to an infected
male (incompatible mating), relative to that of uninfected
female mated to an uninfected male, is (1 - B) and the relative fecundity of an infected female is (1 - C), independently of the genotype of her mate. In these fecundities, C
is the fecundity cost of infection borne by infected females
and B is the fecundity cost of cytoplasmic incompatibility
borne by uninfected females mated to infected males
(note that for clarity we have chosen to deviate from the
usual notation in which C = sf and B = sh). All adults die
after reproduction. (3) Juvenile hosts disperse. Male and
female juveniles disperse with equal probabilities and
randomly, meaning that any non-natal deme is reached
with same probability. The probability that a juvenile is
sampled in its natal deme after dispersal is given by (1 - m)
where m is the migration rate. (4) Juveniles compete for
access to reproduction. Competition is sex-specific and
occurs within demes. In each deme, N juveniles of each
sex reach adulthood, the remainder die. This life cycle
drastically differs from that of Wade & Stevens [19], where
mixing of individuals is complete after breeding and
occurs at the scale of the whole population. However, our
model converges towards that of Wade & Stevens at the
higher migration limit m → 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/134

Assuming this life-cycle and weak selection (small C and
B), we show in the Appendix that the change in frequency
(∆p) of infection in the population can be written as

(

)

∆p = p(1 − p)  −C(1 − Fst ) + B(1 − m) 2 Fst − F3R + pB ( 1 − g(N , m) ) 



(1)
where Fst, F3R , and g(N, m) are terms describing the effect
of population sub-division on the probability that individuals in a deme share their infection status. More precisely, Fst is Wright's measure of population structure
describing the probability that two randomly sampled
individuals within a deme share their infection status by
descent, F3R is the probability that one male and two
females sampled with replacement from the same deme
share their infection status by descent, and g(N, m) is a
function depending on deme size and migration rate (see
eq. 21 in the Appendix).
The selective pressure on infection (the term in square
brackets) comprises three components. The first, -C(1-Fst),
describes the effect of directional selection against infection due to the fecundity cost C borne by infected females.
The fecundity cost is weighted by the probability (1-Fst).
This weighting expresses the fact that population sub-division reduces the strength of this component of selection.
Specifically, genetic drift leads to increased coalescence
within demes, thereby homogenising local demes with
respect to infection status and levelling differences in
fecundity between competitors. The second and third
components of selection capture the change in infection
frequency due to the benefit of CI. These arise whenever
an infected female enjoys increased relative fitness due to
the reduced productivity of an uninfected females having
an incompatible mating with an infected male. Accordingly, the benefit of CI is proportional not only to the cost
of incompatibility, B, but also to the frequency with which
one infected female, one infected male and one uninfected female occur in a same deme (the first being the
beneficiary, the latter two the incompatible mates). Equation 1 distinguishes two cases that can lead to this constellation, based on the genetic relationship between the
infected female and male. The first of the benefit terms,
B(1-m)2(Fst - F3R ), is frequency-independent (does not
contain p) and measures the beneficial effect arising from
events where the infected male and female are related, i.e.
are both infected due to recent coalescence. Accordingly,
the term weights the cost of incompatibility, B, by the

that a female shares the same infection status as a male,
but on the other side it decreases the probability that this
male will have mated with a female bearing the alternative
status. As a consequence of these opposing effects, (FST -

Equation 1 also allows us to recover the dynamics of CI
infections considered by previous treatments. When deme
size becomes very large (N → ∞) or when migration is
complete (m → 1), equation 1 reduces to

The weighting by (1 - m)2 expresses the fact that the offspring of an infected female have to remain in their natal
patch and compete against other sedentary offspring in
order for an increase in the relative fitness of infected
females to arise. The second benefit term, pB(1-g(N, m)),
measures the benefit of CI that is independent of recent
coalescence. Here, the infected male and female are unrelated in the sense there is no recent coalescence in their
infection status. Accordingly, the probability of such an
event is frequency-dependent and the term includes the
average frequency p of infection in the population. The
term is further offset by a quantity g(N, m) which measures the effect of population sub-division on the frequency with which such a benefit occurs. The function
g(N, m) decreases monotonically in N and m (see Appendix), reflecting the fact that with reduced population subdivision, the benefit of CI relies more and more on interactions between unrelated individuals.

which is the weak-selection equivalent of the frequency
change calculated by [14].
We will now consider the situation when infection is rare
(p → 0). This situation is highly relevant, because it is the
natural condition faced by all invading CI-infections and
the dynamics of infection at this point determine the
probability of invasion (or, in mathematical terms, the
stability of the equilibrium p = 0). Taking the lower frequency limit of equation 1, we can derive the condition
for the invasion of a rare CI-infection in terms of the costto-benefit ratio C/B,

The expression on the right-hand size of this inequality is
a function of deme size (N) and migration rate (m).
Equating both sides of inequality 3, we can define a
threshold cost-to-benefit ratio above which infections will
not be able to invade the population. Figure 1 shows how
this threshold ratio varies with both host migration rate
and deme size. For population with very large deme sizes
and very high migration rates (i.e., quasi-panmixia) the
threshold approaches zero and infections cannot invade
unless they are virtually cost-free relative to the intensity
of incompatibility. With decreasing migration rate, however, the threshold ratio increases monotonically, indicatPage 4 of 11

incompatibility, making such population most prone to
the invasion of CI-infections.

Simulations
To complement the analytical model, we ran individualbased computer simulations of CI spread, based on an
extended version of the population genetics software
Nemo [22]. The simulations allowed us to relax some of
the more idealistic assumptions of the model and measure additional parameters of infection dynamics, such as
the speed of spread and the equilibrium frequency
attained.

The simulations considered a finite population of 1800
individuals (half males, half females) subdivided into of
nd demes of N individuals each. The demes are linked by
migration at rate m. We implemented two migration models, an island model (all demes equidistant) and a stepping stone model (populations arranged on a ring).
Furthermore, in one set of simulations we explored the
effect of differential male and female migration in an
island model.

ing that infections can spread even if associated with a
fecundity cost (C>0) and/or incomplete incompatibility
(B<1). The change of the threshold ratio with deme size is
non-monotonous, the threshold ratio being highest at
intermediate deme sizes. This effect can be interpreted in
terms of the impact of local drift on the frequency of

The life cycle is identical to that assumed in the analytical
model. Male and female fecundity was assumed Poisson
distributed and each individual was assigned a number of
offspring drawn form a distribution with mean and variance f = 10. The cost of infection was implemented by
reducing the fecundity of infected females by a factor (1 C). Cytoplasmic incompatibility acted upon fertilization.
An uninfected egg fertilized by the sperm of an infected
father died with probability B. In all simulations, we
relaxed the assumption of perfect vertical transmission
made in the analytical model. Thus, we assumed that
infection was lost with a probability µ from mother to offspring.
Throughout this study we used a standard set of infection
parameters with an incompatibility cost of B = 0.5, a
fecundity cost of C = 0.01, and a rate of parasite loss during vertical transmission of µ = 0.05. Based on the model
for an infinite panmictic population [14], an infection
with these parameters is selectively favoured when its frequency exceeds the invasion threshold of pit = 0.13 and
will attain an equilibrium frequency of pe = 0.94. The
parameter values used are inspired by empirical data
obtained in populations of Drosophila simulans harbouring a CI-Wolbachia [23]. Additional simulations (data not
shown) showed that varying the values has the effect
expected under the deterministic model of infection
dynamics with panmixia.

At the start of each simulation, one deme was inoculated
with one infected female and one infected male. This
starting frequency is well below the invasion threshold of
pit = 0.13 (and hence counter-selected) when considering
the whole population of 900 males and 900 females, as
well as when considering deme sizes that exceed 7 males
and 7 females. Simulations were run for 2000 generations
and infection frequency was recorded for each deme at
intervals of 10 generations. We considered an infection to
have invaded if it was still present at the end of the simulation run (generation 2000). Simulations were replicated
1000 times for any combination of parameters.

In addition to its effect on the probability of spread, population sub-division also influenced the equilibrium frequency they attained. Generally, infections attained a
higher equilibrium frequency (prevalence) under conditions that minimized the amount of local genetic drift.
Thus, prevalence in populations with strong drift (low
migration rate and/or small deme size) remained considerably lower than the value predicted for panmixia (pe =
0.94) at which populations with weak drift (large demes
and/or high rates of migration) stabilized (Fig. 3). The low
prevalence in high-drift populations is not due to a failure

¥

Frequencies of invasion (i.e., the proportions of replicate
simulation runs in which the infection was present after
2000 generations) varied with both deme size and migration in a way that fit the predictions of our analytical
model (Fig. 2). While increasing host migration rate lead
to a decline in invasion frequency (Fig. 2A), infections
were more likely to persist when deme size was intermediate (Fig. 2B). Figure 2 shows that population sub-division (restricted migration) allows CI infection to invade
populations it would not have invaded under panmixia.
For example, with deme sizes of N = 180, infection can
sometimes invade with migration rates of m = 0.01 and m
= 0.05, but not with m = 0.1 and above, which for ten
demes corresponds to panmixia.

Effects of dispersal rate and deme size in an island model
In a first set of simulations, we analyzed the dynamics of
infection as a function of host migration rate and deme
size in an island model of population structure. In these
simulations, the population was sub-divided into demes
of sizes N = {4, 6, 12, 20, 60, 90, 180}. Since the sex ratio
was assumed to be even in our simulations, these deme
sizes are equivalent to 2, 3, 6, 10, 30, 45, and 90 reproductive females. With a total population size of 1800, the
array of deme sizes imply deme numbers of nd = {450,
300, 150, 90, 30, 20, 10}. Demes were linked by male and
female migration at equal rates. The range of migration
rates used was m = {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2}. We ran simulations for all combinations of migration rate m and deme
size N.

to attain equilibrium. Rather, low prevalence is the result
of two mechanisms. First, drift causes prevalence to fluctuate around the equilibrium of pe = 0.94. Because infection frequency cannot exceed 100%, large stochastic
fluctuations in populations with strong drift will tend to
decrease mean prevalence. Second, under conditions of
strong local drift, population-wide mean prevalence is
lowered by the total loss of infection in some demes (Fig.
3). For instance, in the two cases showing the lowest mean
prevalence (N = 12 with m = 0.01, and N = 6 with m =
0.05), around a quarter of demes had lost infection while
the prevalence in the remaining infected demes was 86–
88% (compared to a population-wide prevalence of about
64%). Additional simulations have shown that such polymorphism is stable over large time-spans (more than
5,000 generations).
Effects of dispersal rate and deme size in a stepping stone model
The island model used in the analytical model and the
above simulations is convenient from a modelling point
of view, but is representative of few, if any, natural situations. Indeed, it assumes that all demes of a population
are equidistant, while in natural populations, demes tend
to be arranged in a geographic pattern that causes some
pairs of demes to be further apart than others. Accord-

ingly, some demes are more likely to exchange migrants
than others. In order to assess the influence of geography
on the spread of CI, we performed a set of simulations in
a simple stepping stone setting, in which the demes were
arranged on a circle. Migration occurred between neighbouring demes along the circle. Simulations were run for
deme sizes of N = {4, 6, 12, 20, 60, 180} (deme numbers
nd = {450, 300, 150, 90, 30, 10}) and migration rates of m
= {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6}.

Figure 4 shows the frequency of invasion observed in
these simulations as a function of migration rate (4A) and
deme size (4B). Overall, the results are qualitatively equivalent to those obtained under the island model. Thus, the
frequency of CI-invasion tends to decrease with increasing
host migration rate. Furthermore, invasion frequency is
highest for intermediate deme size. However, comparing
Figures 2 and 4 shows that there are quantitative differences between the island model and the stepping stone
model. In particular, the explicit geographical arrangement of demes in the stepping stone model appears to
increase the probability of CI spread with high rates of
host migration. This difference could arise because the
limiting migration to adjacent demes in the stepping
stone model reduces the degree to which infection is
diluted across the entire population, making it more likely
that the infection frequency will remain above the infection threshold in groups of neighbouring demes.

In this paper we have investigated the effect of host population structure on the spread of incompatibility-inducing
symbionts. Our analyses demonstrate that population
structure can greatly facilitate the spread of CI. In our simulations, infections spread from being present in a single
individual of each sex (pf = pm = 1/900) to an equilibrium
frequency of p ≈ 0.94 with probabilities as high as 15%
(cf. Figs. 2 and 4), despite the relatively benign level of
incompatibility used (B = 0.5). These results suggest that

Discussion

©

The parasites being maternally transmitted, female dispersal was a major determinant of infection dynamics. As
shown in Figure 5, the frequency of CI invasion decreased
with female dispersal rate. However, male migration rate
also had an effect, in that female philopatry favoured the
spread of infection more when males dispersed at a low or
moderate rate and less if male dispersed at a high rate.

 

Infection dynamics as a function of male and female dispersal rates
In a third set of simulations, we addressed the relative
importance of male and female dispersal rates for the
spread of CI infections. We ran simulations for all combinations of male and females migration rates of m = {0.01,
0.05, 0.1, 0.2}. Population sub-division was fixed to nd =
30 and N = 60.

large selective advantage for infection. Small deme size
does not favour the spread of infection for two reasons.
First, strong drift results in the frequent elimination of
infection shortly after the initial inoculation of a population. Second, in the event that infection is not lost but
fixed in one deme, it is subject to negative between-deme
selection because the fecundity cost of infection reduces
the productivity of infected demes. Large deme sizes, in
turn, are disadvantageous because local drift is not strong
enough to overcome the fitness disadvantage that CIinfections suffer at low frequencies due to the cost of
infection.

tions, the spread of infection is only a matter of time. Population sub-division, which can be assumed to affect most
natural populations to some degree, could thus provide
the key to understanding the high incidence of CI-inducing symbiont infections that has been observed in arthropods, and in particular insects [18].
Both the model and the simulations consistently showed
that the rate of invasion of CI-symbionts varies according
to both parameters of host population structure considered in our study, deme size and migration rate. The latter
of these parameters affects infection in a straightforward
way; high levels of host migration will result in the dilution of infection out of a deme into the population at
large and therefore decrease the probability of successful
invasion. Furthermore, CI spread relies on limited dispersal of both males and females, in order to assure that
infected females enjoy an increased relative fitness as a
result of uninfected females suffering incompatible matings. The other parameter, deme size, shows an interesting
non-monotonous effect whereby CI-infections invade
easiest when deme size is intermediate. Under these conditions, local genetic drift creates heterogeneity in infection among the local breeding population that guarantees
a high proportion of incompatible matings and hence a

As outlined above, the non-monotonous dependence of
invasion probability on deme size results partly from
selection against demes fixed for either the uninfected or
the infected state. Infected demes lose out in betweendeme competition because their productivity is reduced
by the cost of infection. Accordingly, the low invasion success of a CI strategy in populations with small demes is
related to the fact that infection reduces fecundity irrespectively of whether CI results in harm to uninfected
individuals or not. Invasion success in small demes is
expected to be higher for agents (be it genes or symbionts)
in which the fecundity cost is conditional on the expression of the harming act (such as CI). This is the situation
usually considered in models of the evolution of spiteful
behaviour [24,25]. In these models, invasion of spiteful
traits has been found to decrease monotonously with
deme size.
The simulation results presented here demonstrate not
only that population sub-division affects CI-dynamics,
but also that this effect varies according to the population
model considered. Thus, host migration had a stronger
negative effect on CI invasion in the island model than in
the stepping-stone model. This quantitative difference can
be explained by a lesser degree of dilution of infection in
the geographically explicit stepping stone model. Thus,
local migration in this population setup resembles diffusion and is expected to result in a spatial correlation of
infection frequency, with adjacent demes being more similar in infection than demes further apart. Accordingly,
migration out of infected demes will drive up infection
frequency in adjacent demes very effectively and is more
likely to bring infection frequency in the range of positive
selection for infection. The flipside of localized migration
is, however, that the spread of infection across the population as a whole proceeds more slowly and more generations are needed to reach the equilibrium prevalence in
the population as a whole (data not shown).
Our prediction that population sub-division can favour
the spread of a CI infections differs diametrically from
that of Wade and Stevens [21]. These authors found that

population structure impedes the spread of CI. A closer
look at the two models reveals that this discrepancy is
rooted in the different ways in which population structure
is implemented in the life-cycle underlying the models.
Wade and Stevens' model assumes that reproduction
takes place within groups. Offspring produced in different
matings groups then undergo complete dispersal and
compete at the level of the entire population [hard selection sensu [26]], before being partitioned in groups again
for the next round of reproduction. Population structure
is implemented as variance in infection frequency
between mating groups, which is a fraction of the total
variance in infection frequency p(1-p). Importantly, the
portion of the total variance in infection that is attributed
to the between-deme component is arbitrarily determined
by a parameter. Accordingly, between- and within-deme
variance are both assumed to vary completely independently of the migration rate and are thus independent of
the geographical structure of the population. In this setting, increasing the variance in infection between mating
groups will necessarily be disadvantageous for the spread
of infection, because it is associated with a more homogeneous infection within demes and hence a reduced frequency of incompatible matings. The spread of CI is
further compromised by the assumption that competition
occurs at the level of the entire population. Global competition reduces the net advantage of CI because fitness is
measured by comparing the fecundity of infected females
to the population average rather than the deme average.
As a consequence, a high frequency of incompatible matings within some individual demes will only generate a
small increase in the relative fitness of infected females
across the entire population. In our model, population
structure is not imposed as an external parameter but
arises naturally as a consequence of limited dispersal
between permanent demes. Both reproduction and competition take place within demes, but separated by an episode of dispersal. With such a setting, intermediate
between hard and soft selection, population structure
affects both the frequency of incompatible matings and
the probability that infected individuals will benefit from
the increase in relative fitness brought about by CI. Our
model shows that, if implemented in this natural way,
population sub-division is conducive to the spread of CIsymbionts because the benefit of CI is likely to go to
infected individuals rather than being diluted in the population at large. Under the assumption that competition
occurs before dispersal (pure soft selection), we expect
that population sub-division would be even more in favor
of the spread of CI than under our life cycle because competition would occur only locally, thus increasing the benefits of reducing the fecundity of neighbouring uninfected
females. This suggests that our results are qualitatively
robust to changes of assumptions on the timing of dispersal.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/134

The analytical model presented here assumes that individuals perform a large number of random matings within
demes. Violations of this assumption due to systematic
inbreeding or inbreeding avoidance alter the dynamics of
an incompatibility-inducing mutant. Inbreeding reduces
the expected number of incompatible matings and hence
impedes the spread of CI. Outbreeding, on the contrary,
increases the number of incompatible matings and promotes the spread of infection [27]. These effects of the
mating system are expected to occur irrespective of population structure and hence add to the effects of dispersal
rate and deme size predicted here. However, population
structure is expected to have an influence on the quantitative difference between the frequency change with outbreeding/inbreeding and that with random mating. Both
the advantage of outbreeding and the disadvantage of
inbreeding are subject to the presence of diversity in infection within the mating populations. Under conditions of
strong drift, the mating system can therefore be expected
to have a small effect on infection dynamics.
In addition to a simple mating system, random mating,
our model and simulations assumed non-overlapping
generations. While this assumption might hold for some
real-world cases, the majority of species show some degree
of overlap between generations. Population age structure
has been suggested to negatively affect the dynamics of CI
and impeding infection spread [28], although the
assumptions of this model are unclear. We have not
extended our model in this direction but we would expect
that including age structure would have a positive effect
on the probability of CI spread. With overlapping generations, only a fraction of the breeding population is
replaced at every generation. As a consequence, increasing
age structure will, for a given deme size, reduce the part of
the breeding population that has just reached adulthood
and potentially migrated. Thus, age structure will tend to
reduce the effective migration rate and accentuate population sub-division, thereby increasing the probability of CI
spread (cf. Fig. 2A).
The predictions generated by our model and simulations
have several implications for empirical research on CIinducing symbionts. First, they generate the testable prediction that symbionts causing CI should be relatively
more frequent in species or populations that show a
higher degree of sub-division. Furthermore, our results on
overall prevalence (Fig. 3) highlight potential problems
for obtaining meaningful estimates of prevalence. Most
natural hosts populations will be sub-divided and potentially subject to strong genetic drift. Accordingly, the effective population size was found to be around ten times
smaller than the numerical population size in a large survey of data on wild animal populations [29]. Under conditions of local drift, measures of prevalence should be

based on screens for infection in several demes, because
strong drift can generate local variation in infection frequency. A wide sampling screen is the more important the
lower the migration rate of hosts and the smaller the size
of local breeding populations.

cessfully infected with relatively small numbers of genetically engineered CI-agents, in particular if gene flow can
be artificially restricted during the early periods of invasion.

Authors' contributions
Finally, our results are of fundamental importance with
regards to the exploitation of CI as a drive-systems for
genetic manipulation of natural populations of arthropods. Introducing transgenes into natural populations
can be desirable for a number of reasons, the most important of which is the aim of controlling the transmission of
vector-borne disease such as malaria. The realization that
CI can bring about the rapid spread of symbiont infection
in large host populations has led to the proposition of
using the power of this system to drive transgenes through
a host population [e.g., [30,31]]. However, previous analyses of the dynamics of such a system based on a panmictic model suggested that large numbers of genetically
modified organisms would be required in order to overcome the invasion threshold to achieve successful spread
of the construct [31]. Our results suggest that this limitation applies to a much lesser degree to situations in which
vector populations are sub-divided. As shown in Figures 2
and 4, infections in highly subdivided populations spread
with reasonable probability, even if populations are inoculated with a single pair released in one deme. The probability of successful invasion is expected to be much
increased if the number of released individuals is large relative to the size of local demes. By reversing their logic, the
predictions of our model further suggest that invasion
success could be increased by artificially limiting host
migration. A combined strategy of local release of transgenic hosts combined with, for instance, the pesticide
treatment of adjacent demes would help the establishment of infection in the focal deme, creating a base for
subsequent spread through the remainder of the population.

Conclusion
Our work has shown that population sub-division greatly
facilitates the spread of CI-inducing symbionts and allows
infections to invade large populations, even when initially
rare. Our study therefore helps to reconcile the high incidence of CI-infections across arthropod species with the
considerable barriers to invasion predicted by models of
CI-dynamics based on large panmictic populations. Furthermore, our predictions validate the use of CI-systems
for the genetic manipulation of natural populations.
Indeed, sub-divided populations of hosts could be suc-
