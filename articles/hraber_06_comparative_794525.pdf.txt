Abstract
Background: The duration of treatment for HCV infection is partly indicated by the genotype of
the virus. For studies of disease transmission, vaccine design, and surveillance for novel variants,
subtype-level classification is also needed. This study used the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test and
related statistical techniques to compare phylogenetic trees obtained from coding and non-coding
regions of a whole-genome alignment for the reliability of subtyping in different regions.
Results: Different regions of the HCV genome yield inconsistent phylogenies, which can lead to
erroneous conclusions about classification of a given infection. In particular, the highly conserved
5' untranslated region (UTR) yields phylogenetic trees with topologies that differ from the HCV
polyprotein and complete genome phylogenies. Phylogenetic trees from the NS5B gene reliably
cluster related subtypes, and yield topologies consistent with those of the whole genome and
polyprotein.
Conclusion: These results extend those from previous studies and indicate that, unlike the NS5B
gene, the 5' UTR contains insufficient variation to resolve HCV classifications to the level of viral
subtype, and fails to distinguish genotypes reliably. Use of the 5' UTR for clinical tests to
characterize HCV infection should be replaced by a subtype-informative test.

Background
In treating infection with hepatitis C virus, knowledge of
a patient's viral genotype informs the choice of appropriate therapy [1-3]. Although the HCV subtype afflicting a
patient is not currently used to make clinical treatment
decisions, knowing the viral subtype is important for studies of its origin, transmission, and evolution [1-4]. For
example, new emerging variants can be characterized better when they can be assigned an unequivocal subtype

classification [5]. Molecular epidemiology analyses rely
on information about sequence variation at the subtype
level [4,5]. Vaccine-design strategies are informed by the
diversity of HCV variants and the antigenic determinants
(epitopes) therein [6,7]. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a frequent complication for HCV infection, might
be assessed better in light of HCV subtype [8]. Thus, effective methods for both genotype and subtype classification
are important tools to manage HCV infections.

Techniques to infer phylogenies combine an optimality
criterion with an algorithm to search for the best tree.
Optimality criteria quantify how well the tree describes
the data, and are either distance-based or character-based
[9,10]. An algorithm can quickly construct a single tree
that minimizes all the pairwise distances among taxa.
However, this approach is less able to use information
from different taxa to model variation in evolutionary
rates across sites than the optimality criterion of maximum likelihood ([9], p. 175). Search algorithms are
deployed by character-based methods to find trees that
best explain the data, given an evolutionary model with
known assumptions. The search algorithms of characterbased methods take more time to evaluate alternative candidate trees than rapid distance-based methods. Perhaps
for this reason, many more distance-based than characterbased phylogenies of HCV genotypes have been published. However, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic
inference is known to outperform distance-based methods when such complications as substitution rate heterogeneity or covariation between sites are present [9,10].
Formal comparisons between topologies are thus more
appropriate for maximum-likelihood phylogenies than
for the approximations that result from distance-based
methods.
This study evaluates phylogenies derived from coding
(NS5B) and non-coding (5' UTR) regions of wholegenome HCV sequences for consistent classification of
viral subtypes into distinct genetic groups, or clades, with
the aim of evaluating their suitability for genotype and
subtype classification. Concordance with the wholegenome phylogeny is desired. Nucleotide characters in
NS5B are over five times more abundant than in the 5'
UTR, though only a small portion of this region is amplified for subtyping. To compensate for this, we also considered a smaller, oft-studied portion of NS5B that we call
the "Okamoto region" (from nt 8282 to 8610 in the H77
reference genome) for its ability to represent the phylogeny of NS5B and the entire HCV genome. We tested the
hypothesis that phylogenetic trees obtained from different genomic regions of HCV differ significantly. We also
compared tree topologies for their ability to group genotypes and subtypes consistently into clades.

Results
Phylogenetic inferences
Among the 38 whole-genome HCV sequences representing 18 confirmed subtypes as summarized in Table 1, the
most general substitution model, the general time reversible model (GTR, also known as REV) with a discrete
gamma approximation for rate heterogeneity, was consistently supported as superior among the twelve nucleotide
substitution models evaluated (not shown). Models
adjusted for rate heterogeneity consistently fit the data

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/103

better than models that assume a fixed evolutionary rate
across sites (not shown). Substitution models with fewer
parameters or an assumption of equal base compositions
performed significantly worse than GTR, regardless of
whether or not the sequences analyzed contained proteincoding regions. Adding a parameter for the estimated proportion of invariant sites significantly improved the substitution model, yielding parameters as shown in Table 2.
The same model was selected when the AIC was adjusted
to compensate for a low ratio of sample data to parameters (not shown). Thus, GTR with a gamma distribution of
evolutionary rates per site and accommodation of invariant sites (GTR+Γ+I) is the best substitution model for
HCV variation among those considered, and was used for
maximum-likelihood phylogeny inference.
The 5' UTR is represented by the smallest number of
aligned nucleotide sites (300 nt; the 5' most 42 nt were
excluded from analysis because of extensive gaps throughout the available sequence data), followed by the
Okamoto region of NS5B (329 nt), then the polyprotein
(9177 nt), and the whole genome (9791 nt, Table 2). The
proportion of invariant nucleotide sites for the 5' UTR is
2/3, much lower than for the protein-coding regions, for
which less than 1/3 of sites do not vary (Table 2). The 5'
UTR is known to be less variable than protein-coding
regions of HCV [3,6,11,12].
Tree topologies from the entire HCV genome and the
polyprotein are identical (Figs. 1a, b and 2a, b). The tree
from the Okamoto region of NS5B resembles trees from
the whole genome and the polyprotein, except for rearrangements in the ordering of deeply rooted branches
(Figs. 1d and 2d). Trees from sequences that include protein-coding regions clearly group subtypes from the same
genotype into clades, while the tree from the non-coding
terminus conflates subtypes of genotypes 1 and 6 with
subtypes 4a and 5a, and subtypes of genotypes 1 and 6
cannot be distinguished (Figs. 1c and 2c). Thus, the phylogenetic trees of the 5' UTR are less able to group subtypes
from the same genotype together into clades than trees
from protein-coding sequences (Figs. 1 and 2), regardless
of the method used for phylogenetic inference. Parsimony
analysis yields comparable results, with similar trees for
the whole genome, polyprotein, and the Okamoto region
of NS5B, while the tree from the 5' UTR contains a basal
polytomy that does not resolve genotypes 1,4, 5, or 6 (not
shown).
Hypothesis tests
Log-likelihood scores and SH-test results for alternative
trees are summarized in Table 3. All tests yield the same
outcomes, regardless of whether or not RELL optimization was used. Comparisons of alternative trees with the
5' UTR data fail to reject the null hypothesis of no differ-

ence in likelihoods (P > α; see Methods). Comparisons
among alternative trees with data from the Okamoto
region of NS5B indicate that the 5' UTR tree has a significantly different likelihood (P < 0.0001) than trees
obtained from NS5B, polyprotein, or whole-genome data,
which are statistically indistinguishable (P > α). Comparing parsimony trees from 300-nt windows in NS5B with
trees from the 5' UTR via the incongruence length difference test [13], which uses the difference in tree lengths as
a test statistic, rather than the likelihood difference,
yielded the same pattern of significant differences (not
shown).

nucleotides. However, increasing window size yields
poorer resolution in the 5' UTR (Fig. 3a) because fewer
windows are able to represent this region. Contrary to
expectations, the rescaled homoplasy index is not constant. Despite large fluctuations within the 5' UTR, the
rescaled homoplasy index is generally greater in the 5'
UTR than in other regions of the HCV genome and particularly NS5B (Fig. 3b). After correcting for the substitution
rate in this manner, the consistency of sites with the
whole-genome phylogeny is lower in the 5' UTR than in
NS5B.

Discussion
Consistency and homoplasy indices
Increasing window sizes represent the CI as an increasingly smooth function, as more nucleotides better approximate the whole-genome phylogeny than fewer

among the six known HCV genotypes [12]. The best substitution model was also found to be the most general. In
the earlier study, the 5' UTR was found to have lower phylogenetic signal, lower evolutionary rate, and greater phylogenetic noise than alternative regions of the HCV
genome, including NS5B [12]. Our observations concur
with those previously reported. Methodological refinements in our approach include the use of informationbased model selection criteria to determine the best
nucleotide substitution model, more complete HCV
genomes, the revised nomenclature for subtypes [5], and
formal comparisons between alternative topologies for
the purpose of subtype determination.

The tree from the Okamoto region of NS5B is a significantly better fit to the HCV whole-genome and polyprotein data than the 5' UTR tree, regardless of the optimality
criterion used for phylogenetic inference. Trees obtained
from the 5' UTR perform worse at classifying HCV subtypes into clades of the same genotype than do trees from
the whole genome, polyprotein, or the Okamoto region
of NS5B. Discordant topologies of maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic trees obtained from the 5' UTR and NS5B
have been described for a subset of HCV genotypes
[14,15]. The inconsistent ordering of deeply rooted
branches among trees from protein-coding regions indicates a basal polytomy whose resolution is contingent on

atitis B virus [17] and, with accommodation of invariant
sites, for both HIV [18] and HCV [12]. Instantaneous substitution rates (normalized to the G-U rate) are greater
among sites in the non-coding 5' UTR than in the regions
that encode proteins, despite the fact that overall sequence
conservation is greater in the UTR (Table 2). In particular,
the instantaneous substitution rate between cytidine and
uridine is much greater for the 5' UTR than for proteincoding regions. The accelerated C-U (or C-T for DNA
sequences) substitution rate has previously been reported
and discussed for protein-coding regions [19], though the
rate is even greater for the non-coding terminus than for
regions having codon usage constraints. Spontaneous

deamination of cytosine to uracil may inflate the C-U substitution rate.
Conservation of single-stranded RNA secondary structure
in both coding and non-coding regions of HCV has
already been reported [15,20-23]. The high C-U rate bias
may additionally be explained by the formation of noncanonical base pairs between guanosine and uridine in
single-stranded RNA molecules, which is consistent with
selection to conserve secondary structure, because a mutation from cytosine to uridine is less disruptive to secondary structure formation than other point mutations [24].
The may also be explained by the fact that all rates are

Page 6 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

Virology Journal 2006, 3:103

rescaled such that the G-U rate is unity. A low G-U substitution rate thus inflates other rates. A mutation between G
and U is disruptive to RNA secondary structure, because it
eliminates the possibility of bases pairing without a compensatory mutation elsewhere. Overall, the elevated C-U
substitution rate seen for the 5' UTR probably results from
several interacting factors.
Though the same evolutionary model applies to the noncoding 5' UTR and the Okamoto region of NS5B, the two
regions are subjected to different constraints. While coding sequences have codon-usage constraints and selective
pressure for amino-acid mutations to escape detection by
the host immune system, the UTR must preserve longrange interactions with complementary nucleotides at the
other terminus of the viral genome if cyclization of the
genome is essential to viral replication [6,20]. Because of
these differences in selective regimes, it should not be surprising that phylogenies of the two differ.
HCV diagnostic technologies include serologic (antibody
based) and genetic (sequence based) techniques to detect
infected samples [4,6,25]. Population screens are the
most commonly deployed genetic HCV tests, which benefit from low false-positive rates because they utilize the
conserved 5' UTR as targets for PCR amplification. However, it is clear both from the results of this study and from
previous investigations that the 5' UTR does not contain
sufficient information to resolve subtypes [26-31]. Phylogenetic signal in protein-coding regions, such as NS5B,
provides a useful alternative [12,32], but few commercial
assays exploit this information at present. The "gold
standard" for subtype determination is direct sequencing,
which has a lower cost for reagents but requires more time
than commercial assay kits [4,25].
There exist further complications to subtype classification,
including coinfection [30,33,34], recombination [35,36],
within-host evolution [37,38], and compartmentalization
of genotypes into different cell types [39]. Diagnostic
assays that are informed by the 5' UTR will be less able to
accommodate these difficulties than methods that are
able to resolve subtypes.

Conclusion
Ultimately, HCV infection outcome results from an interaction between the virus and its host. The current standard
of care is limited in efficacy, and treatment outcome is
contingent on viral genotype [1-3,6,25,34]. To improve
HCV therapies, perform effective public-health surveillance for new variants and modes of transmission, and
further vaccine development efforts, detailed information
about the interacting genotypes is needed. Diagnostic
methods that assign viral subtype classifications are thus
greatly desired. Such methods perform better when they

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/103

are not informed by sequence variation from the non-coding 5' UTR, and should instead favor protein-coding
regions, such as the Okamoto region of NS5B.

Methods
Phylogenetic inference
We used multiple methods for phylogenetic inference,
including neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony
(MP), and maximum likelihood (ML) [9,10]. This was
done to evaluate whether the inferential technique has an
influence on the ability of the resulting phylogenies to
resolve subtypes into clades. We used PAUP*, version
4.0b10 [40] for phylogenetic inference. Neighbor-joining
trees were constructed with the F84 distance metric [41]
and the BioNJ algorithm [42]. For parsimony analyses,
uninformative invariant characters were excluded and
gaps were treated as a fifth character state.

To select an appropriate nucleotide substitution model,
we used FindModel, an independ-ent, online implementation of ModelTest [43]. This approach uses an information-based goodness-of-fit criterion, in the sense that the
best model minimizes the quantity of bits required to
encode both the model and the model-encoded data for
electronic transmission [44-46]. Such an approach
includes a penalty term for the number of parameters, and
thus facilitates comparing models with varied numbers of
parameters [44]. The fit of each model to the data was
evaluated both with and without a four-category discrete
approximation to a gamma distribution of substitution
rates per site. Because FindModel does not test models
with invariant sites, we also used ModelTest (version 3.6)
to evaluate nucleotide substitution models with invariant
sites [43]. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used
to quantify the suitability of alternative models having
varied numbers of parameters to fit the data [47].
Hypothesis tests
To evaluate the significance of differences in ML phylogenies obtained from different regions of the HCV genome,
we used the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [48] as
implemented in PAUP*, version 4.0b10 [40]. The null
hypothesis of the SH test is that none of the trees evaluated has a likelihood that differs significantly from any
other. Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates a significant
difference in likelihood scores, and thus in tree topologies
[49].

For a pair of trees defined a priori, the SH test computes
the difference in their likelihoods (Δ). This difference is
compared with the null distribution of likelihood scores,
obtained by building trees from character data generated
by iterative bootstrap resampling with replacement of the
nucleotide sites. A computationally efficient optimization

Page 7 of 9

Virology Journal 2006, 3:103

(RELL) may be applied, which simply adds together persite likelihoods over the resampled sites. Otherwise, the
tree parameters are optimized on the resampled data
(FULL). The resampled likelihood differences are denoted
Δ ′ , where i indexes the replicate, and they are subsei
quently transformed by subtracting the mean resampled
difference <Δ'>, a procedure called centering. The original
difference in likelihoods is compared with the null distribution in a one-tailed, non-parametric manner, whereby
the rank of Δ is evaluated against the centered, sorted Δ'
distribution. If the rank of Δ is found to lie outside the
interval of the null distribution between 0 and the (1-α) ×
100 percentile, the difference in likelihoods is significant
with (1-α) × 100% confidence, and the null hypothesis is
rejected in favor of the alternative. (The acceptable type I,
or false positive, error rate per test is denoted α.)
Here the tree topologies are ML phylogenies that represent
different regions of the HCV genome. The reference alignment of 38 HCV whole-genome sequences representing
18 confirmed subtypes (Table 1) was obtained from the
LANL HCV database [50]. We conducted SH tests with
data from the 5' UTR, the Okamoto region of NS5B, and
whole genome. Topologies were paired such that the ML

ces (HI) are complementary (CI+HI = 1), character consistency is high when homoplasy is low, and vice versa.
Thus, we expect lower homoplasy to result from fewer
informative sites. Further, homoplasy decreases rapidly
with decreasing substitution rates. To control for variation
in the number of informative sites across the genome, we
rescaled the homoplasy index against the square of the
proportion of informative sites in the window region. This
was done because, in the limit of short branch lengths, the
number of informative sites should be proportional to the
substitution rate r, while the number of homoplasies
should be proportional to r2. The result was subsequently
normalized against the maximum, to facilitate comparison with the proportion of informative sites. As a result, if
all parts of the HCV genome are equally informative, one
can expect the rescaled homoplasy index to be roughly
constant over the viral genome.

sets for each pair of trees and compared the original difference in likelihoods with the null distribution that
resulted. The type I error rate was reduced to accommodate six hypothesis tests (α = 0.05/6 = 0.00833). This
reduction preserves the experiment-wide false-positive
rate by making each comparison more stringent.
Consistency and homoplasy indices
To understand better phylogenetic inconsistencies over
the HCV genome, we computed the character consistency
index (CI) for each site in PAUP with the whole-genome
phylogeny, and summarized CI with a moving-window
(running) average over 100, 300, and 500 nt. The 100 nt
window size was used subsequently because it allows for
clear visualization of the 342 nucleotides that constitute
the 5' UTR. Because the consistency and homoplasy indi-
