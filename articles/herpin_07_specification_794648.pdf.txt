Abstract
Background: Primordial germ cells (PGCs) give rise to gametes that are responsible for the
development of a new organism in the next generation. Two modes of germ line specification have
been described: the inheritance of asymmetrically-localized maternally provided cytoplasmic
determinants and the induction of the PGC fate by other cell types.
PGCs specification in zebrafish appears to depend on inheritance of germ plasm in which several
RNA molecules such as vasa and nanos reside. Whether the specification mode of PGCs found in
zebrafish is general for other fish species was brought into question upon analysis of olvas
expression – the vasa homologue in another teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes). Here, in contrast to
the findings in zebrafish, the PGCs are found in a predictable position relative to a somatic
structure, the embryonic shield. This finding, coupled with the fact that vasa mRNA, which is
localized to the germ plasm of zebrafish but does not label a similar structure in medaka opened
the possibility of fundamentally different mechanisms governing PGC specification in these two fish
species.
Results: In this study we addressed the question concerning the mode of PGC specification in
medaka using embryological experiments, analysis of RNA stability in the PGCs and electron
microscopy observations. Dramatic alterations in the somatic environment, i.e. induction of a
secondary axis or mesoderm formation alteration, did not affect the PGC number. Furthermore,
the PGCs of medaka are capable of protecting specific RNA molecules from degradation and could
therefore exhibit a specific mRNA expression pattern controlled by posttrancriptional
mechanisms. Subsequent analysis of 4-cell stage medaka embryos using electron microscopy
revealed germ plasm-like structures located at a region corresponding to that of zebrafish germ
plasm.
Conclusion: Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that in medaka the
inheritance of maternally provided asymmetrically-localized cytoplasmic determinants directs cells
to assume the germ line fate similar to zebrafish PGCs.

Background
Two basic strategies for the specification of primordial
germ cells (PGCs) have been described. In Drosophila, C.
elegans and Xenopus the inheritance of germ plasm with
associated germ cell determinants appears to be required
for PGC formation [1-3]. In these organisms, maternally
provided asymmetrically-localized germ plasm, or germ
plasm-like structures that are visible in electron micrographs (so called "nuage") are found in positions where
the PGCs are formed. In Drosophila it has been shown that
the germ plasm has an instructive role in directing nuclei
to the germline [4] while zebrafish embryos from which
the germ plasm was removed lacked germ cells [5]. In
mouse (and by extension other mammals) and urodelean
amphibians the mechanisms of germline specification are
different. Here, morphologically distinct germ plasm has
not been identified in early embryos but rather, as
revealed in transplantation experiments, cellular interactions are thought to be responsible for PGC specification
[6,7]. Consistently, the formation of the founding population of PGCs in the mouse was shown to depend on
extracellular factors of the bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) family [8-11]. Whereas the actual specification and
formation of PGCs in mammals and in urodeles appear to
be independent of germ plasm, material resembling
nuage, a germ plasm organelle, is found in germ cells of
these organisms at later developmental stages [12,13].
Germ-cell specification in fish was studied mainly in bony
fish (teleosts) where the work relied on observations
using light and electron microscopy. The germ cells were
recognized by their large size and by the typical electron
dense nuage-like structures. Using these criteria, the earliest time point at which germ cells could be recognized in
teleosts was around the onset of somitogenesis [14-16].
Some investigators deduced that the position where the
PGCs were first identified was their site of origin (For references see [17]). Transplantation experiments of the
embryonic shield, the fish organizer, in the teleost Fundulus, to the extraembryonic yolk sac of hosts resulted in,
among other tissues, the development of germ cells and
gonads with the highest frequency of germ cells found
when the posterior quarter of the Fundulus shield was
grafted [18,19]. One could not exclude the possibility
however, that a small population of PGCs existed already
before the end of gastrulation and migrated to the position where they were identified either morphologically or
by embryological transplantation experiments. Thus, the
question of the time and place of germ-cell origin in fish
remained open.
The first molecular marker for PGCs in fish is the zebrafish
vasa mRNA [20] an ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the
DEAD-box family [21,22] that is expressed in PGCs of
many species (reviewed in [23]). vasa was originally iden-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/3

tified in Drosophila as a maternal effect gene required for
the formation of abdominal segments and for germ-cell
specification [24]. Similar to many other organisms,
zebrafish vasa mRNA is maternally supplied and it is
detected in the PGCs during all stages of germ line development [20,25-28]. Close examination by whole-mount
in situ hybridization at the 2- and 4-cell stages revealed
that the vasa transcript is enriched at the marginal positions of the first two cleavage planes leading to the formation of four stripes of intense vasa RNA staining [20,25]
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy
showed that at the 4-cell stage vasa RNA is embedded
within an electron dense matrix that resembles nuage,
indicating that at this stage the RNA resides within the
zebrafish germ plasm [28]. The position of the germ
plasm and its early segregation among the first blastomeres strongly support the notion that in zebrafish cells
are directed to the germ line fate by the action of determinants present in the germ plasm [28]. Consistently, inhibiting the translation of RNA molecules that are localized
to the germ plasm of the zebrafish can result in severe
defects in PGC development (e.g. [29,30]).
The findings obtained in zebrafish were extended to suggest that generally in fish, PGCs are specified by determinants found in the germ plasm and that the position of
the germ plasm could be inferred from the position of
RNA molecules such as vasa and nanos which mark the
early germ plasm. Surprisingly, the cloning of the vasa and
nanos genes from another teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes)
and analysis of their mRNA expression patterns did not
provide direct support for the notion that germ plasm is
responsible for PGC specification in all fish species
[31,32]. In contrast to the enrichment of vasa transcripts
in the position of the germ plasm observed in zebrafish,
the transcripts of olvas, the medaka vasa homologue, were
uniformly distributed until stage 16 at late gastrulation
([31], Fig. 1B and 1D). At this stage, PGCs, recognized by
higher levels of olvas expression, are found on either side
of the shield, the fish organizer [31]. Similarly, medaka
nanos transcripts did not aggregate at the two first cleavage
planes (Fig. 1E to 1H). As mentioned above, in zebrafish
the germ plasm contains vasa and nanos mRNAs and is
found at the distal parts of the first two cleavage planes.
These four locations are randomly oriented relative to the
dorsal aspect of the embryo leading to specification of
PGCs in random dorsoventral positions [26]. In contrast,
at these stages, olvas and nanos mRNAs were found to be
uniformly distributed in the corresponding stages and
when the PGCs are first observed using olvas as a molecular marker, they are found in a defined position relative to
somatic structures. If the early expression site of vasa and
its homologues indeed mark the site and stage of PGC origin, then the expression pattern of olvas would imply a different mechanism for specifying PGC in medaka.

In this work we investigate the question of the mechanisms responsible for PGC specification in medaka. We
determine the effect of perturbations in somatic development on PGC specification and describe the properties of
medaka PGCs regarding the metabolism of specific RNA
molecules. The results presented here are consistent with
the notion that despite the differences in the expression
pattern of vasa during early embryogenesis in these two
teleosts that represent totally different branches of the
phylogenetic tree, it is likely that similar basic mechanisms are responsible for PGC specification.

Results and Discussion
Several lines of evidence strongly indicate that in mouse
the PGC fate is induced by signals that originate in adjacent tissues. In this organism, germ cells arise just before
or during early gastrulation, around the proximal part of
the epiblast adjacent to extra-embryonic tissues [6-11].
The finding that medaka PGCs are first detected at a specific position relative to the embryonic shield ([31] and
Fig. 1D) could be interpreted as evidence for induction of
PGCs by the adjacent somatic cells. Consistent with this
suggestion, axial mesodermal tissues in fish are known to
be capable of inducing cell fate in adjacent tissues (e.g.
[33]).

The early expression patterns of zebrafish-vasa,
medaka-olvas and medaka-nanos1 mRNAs. In
zebrafish, the vasa transcript is enriched at the marginal positions of the first two cleavage planes (A), while at a similar
stage olvas mRNA is uniformly distributed throughout the
cytoplasm of all blastomers (B). Throughout development in
zebrafish, the vasa mRNA is expressed exclusively in the
PGCs that can be found in random dorsoventral positions
during blastula and gastrula stages (arrowheads in C). In contrast, at the first time point when medaka PGCs can be
observed (stage 16), they are found on both sides of the
embryonic shield on the dorsal side of the embryo (arrows in
D). All images shown are whole-mount in situ hybridizations.
The probes used are: vasa (A), vasa and chordin (C), olvas (B,
D) and nanos1 (E to H). A, B, E and H are animal view, C is a
lateral view with the dorsal aspect (labeled with chordin) to
the left and D is a dorsal view, F and H are lateral views.

Medaka PGCs number is independent of patterning of
somatic tissues
If PGCs in medaka are induced through interactions with
somatic tissues at the site where they are first observed,
then specific alterations in the development of these tissues are expected to bring about changes in the position
and number of PGCs. To address this point early somatic
development was affected in two ways: either by injecting
b-catenin thereby generating two embryonic axes in a single embryo (Fig. 2A,B and 2C), or by disturbing early axial
mesoderm specification through BMP pathway modulation (Fig. 2D to 2P).

The first manipulation was carried out by injection of 600
pg β-catenin RNA into one marginal blastomere at the 8or 16-cell stage (based on the protocol for zebrafish by
[34]). This resulted in formation of a complete secondary
axis in about 3% of the injected embryos. Control
embryos were injected with the same amount of GFPglobin RNA. The injected embryos were fixed at stages 17
and 23 and whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed using an olvas antisense RNA probe to visualize
the PGCs (for stage 23 see Fig. 2A and 2B). The position
of PGCs in embryos with an induced secondary embryonic axis was similar to that observed in control embryos
of the same developmental stage. If PGC fates are indeed
induced by somatic tissues of the organizer, one would
expect an increase in PGC number when two shields are
present in the embryo. However, the average number of

Induction of a complete secondary embryonic axis was achieved by injection of β-catenin at the 8- and 16-cell stage. The
injected embryos were fixed at stages 17 and 23 and their PGCs visualized by in situ hybridization using an olvas antisense RNA
probe. A: a stage 23 control embryo injected with GFP-globin; B: a stage 23 embryo with a duplicated embryonic axis. In both
stages analyzed, the average PGC number in embryos with a duplicated axis is similar to that of control embryos (C). (D to P)
BMP-mediated mesoderm induction modulation was achieved by injection of either BMP2 (H to K) or dominant negative form
of BMP2/4RI (DN(BMP2/4RI)) (L to O). To confirm mesoderm formation alteration, in situ hybridization was performed with
either Goosecoid (Gsc) ventrolateral mesodermal marker (F, J and N) or HNF3-b axial mesodermal marker (G, K and O). One
day post fertilization (dpf), the average PGC number in embryos with altered mesoderm is similar to that of control embryos
(P). The number of embryos analyzed is provided within the corresponding bars.

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:3

PGCs in embryos with duplicated axes was found to be
similar to the number of PGCs in control embryos (Fig.
2C).
Mesoderm patterning during early gastrulation was modulated by either overexpressing BMP2 (Fig. 2H to 2K) or
expressing a dominant negative form of BMP2/4 receptor
I (DN(BMP2/4RI)) (Fig. 2L to 2O), which results in ventralization and dorsalization of mesoderm, respectively.
Again, no alteration in the total number of PGCs was
observed, although their localization was severely
impaired (Fig. 2D to 2P). Thus, the number of PGCs is
independent of mesoderm patterning.
These findings do not support the idea that PGC fate is
induced by neighboring cells at the site where they are first
detected. Rather, these results are more consistent with the
model according to which PGCs in medaka are specified
by inheritance of pre-localized maternal components
whose amount is the limiting factor determining the
number of PGCs. As BMP-induced mesoderm formation
occurs during gastrulation and the induction of the secondary axis by β-catenin arises at a very early stage of
development well before gastrulation initiates, we consider it unlikely that the PGCs are specified by an earlier
inductive process.
Medaka PGCs selectively stabilize maternally provided
transcripts
As mentioned above, in Drosophila and C. elegans the
PGCs are specified by inheritance of maternally provided
asymmetrically-localized cytoplasmic determinants. In
these organisms, maternally provided transcripts that are
expressed in the PGCs are selectively stabilized within
these cells while being degraded in somatic cells [35,36].
Similarly, in zebrafish the mRNA of the vasa gene [37], as
well as nanos1 (nos1) mRNA [29,38] are degraded in
somatic cells but are stabilized and translated in cells that
contain germ plasm.

If specification of PGCs in medaka occurs by inheritance
of germ plasm similar to zebrafish, then the phenomena
of differential stability of RNAs between somatic and primordial germ cells is expected to take place in this species,
as well.
To examine this point, mRNAs from three zebrafish GFPfusion constructs, vasa-GFP, GFP-zfvasa 3'UTR and GFPnos1 3'UTR, were injected into 1- to 2-cell stage medaka
embryos. Following the injection of 100 pg RNA, in situ
hybridization using an antisense GFP-RNA probe was performed at different times of development to reveal the
spatial distribution of the injected fusion RNAs. As a control, RNA encoding GFP flanked by the Xenopus laevisglobin 5' and 3'UTRs was injected and the distribution of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/3

this RNA was similarly followed at different stages of
development. Remarkably, the zebrafish vasa-GFP-fusion
RNA undergoes rapid degradation in the soma and is stabilized in the germ line cells (arrows in Fig. 3D). An analogous distribution is observed for GFP-nos1 3'UTR RNA
injected into medaka embryos (data not shown). Interestingly, the results resemble those obtained in zebrafish in
several ways: 1. These injected GFP-tagged RNA molecules
do not aggregate at the cleavage planes (data not shown).
2. The injected RNA molecules exhibit differential stability between somatic and primordial germ cells. Whereas at
the onset of somitogenesis the soma is stained strongly
with the antisense GFP probe (Fig. 3B), at stage 23 (12
somites) virtually only the PGCs retain the injected vasaGFP-fusion RNA (Fig. 3D). In contrast, control embryos
show no specific stabilization of the GFP-globin RNA in
the germ line but instead, exhibit general RNA degradation in all cells (Fig. 3A and 3C). Consistent with the
notion that as in zebrafish, post transcriptional events
control differential gene expression between germ cells
and somatic cells in other fish species as well, uniform
introduction (by injection) of GFP- nos1 3'UTR RNA into
1-cell embryos of Oryzias latipes [see Additional file 2], O.
curvinotus [see Additional file 3], O. luzonensis [see Additional file 4] or Betta splendens [see Additional file 5]
resulted in germ cells specific GFP expression [see Additional file 1]. Therefore, differential (nos1 3'UTR)-induced
post-transcriptional events between somatic and germ
cells appears to be a mechanism conserved in different
fish lineages representing distantly related branches of the
phylogenetic tree (Cypriniformes, Perciformes and Beloniformes).
To determine whether this mechanism is relevant for the
observed olvas mRNA and protein distributions, a reciprocal experiment was performed in which the original
full-length olvas RNA was injected in zebrafish embryos.
The analysis of its fate with an antisense olvas probe
revealed no specific stabilization of olvas RNA in the
PGCs of zebrafish (data not shown). Thus, neither
medaka olvas 3'UTR nor olvas open reading frame (ORF)
mediate germ cell specific RNA stability in zebrafish.
Interestingly, in medaka, olvas-GFP protein expression
was rapidly restricted to PGCs (Fig. 3E to 3I), although the
olvas-GFP fusion RNA itself was not efficiently differentially stabilized in the PGCs of medaka (data not shown).
Therefore, the preferential localization of the olvas-GFP
protein to the PGCs (Fig. 3E to 3I) could be attributed to
complementary specific posttranscriptional mechanisms:
(i) in agreement with Kurokawa et al., a PGC-specific
enhanced translation due to the olvas 3'UTR [32]. (ii)
Somatic inhibition of translation due to the open reading
frame itself. (iii) Soma-specific destabilization of the protein [37].

12-somite stage and in situ hybridization using a GFP antisense RNA probe was performed to reveal the spatial distribution of
the injected RNAs. In the control embryos the GFP-globin RNA is degraded uniformly in all cells (A and C) whereas in vasaGFP injected embryos (B and D), the PGCs retain the injected RNA (arrows in D) while it is degrading in somatic cells. (E to S)
olvas-GFP (E to I) as well as GFP-zfvasa 3'UTR (J to N) constructs were injected in medaka and followed for GFP expression

was rapidly restricted to PGCs (E to I), while zebrafish vasa 3'UTR did not induced selective GFP expression.

BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:3

In addition, like olvas 3'UTR in medaka, zebrafish vasa
3'UTR has been shown to be essential for proper protein
PGC localization in zebrafish. Hence, when injected in
medaka, GFP-zfvasa 3'UTR failure of selective GFP expression (Fig. 3J to 3N compared to Fig. 3E to 3I and 3O to 3S)
points out possible specie-variability of either targeted cisacting RNA sequence elements or RNA-interacting protein
sequence, but likely using a similar conserved mechanism.
Thus, while we provide evidence for the existence of conserved mechanisms governing PGCs specification in
zebrafish and medaka, the similarities apparently can not
be extended to the control of PGC-specific expression of
every molecule, as shown here for the zf-vasa and olvas
RNAs. Hence, the mechanisms directing PGC-specific
expression of olvas could depend on combined machineries associating enhanced/repressed specific soma/germline translation, protein stabilization and possibly, to a
lower extend, RNA stability.
Identification of germ plasm like structures in early
Medaka embryos
As the results presented above are consistent with the idea
that in medaka, like in zebrafish, inheritance of germ
plasm is responsible for the formation of PGCs, we sought
to identify germ plasm in early medaka embryos. Both in
birds and fish the detection of germ plasm in early
embryos was possible only after molecular markers for
this organelle became available (the Vasa protein and
mRNA respectively) [28,39]. In the absence of such a
molecular marker for the medaka germ plasm we concentrated our efforts on positions equivalent to those where
zebrafish germ plasm is found. In zebrafish, the germ
plasm with its characteristic electron dense appearance
was found to be concentrated below the first two cleavage
furrows in 4-cell stage embryos [28]. In medaka, the first
4 blastomeres are much smaller in size and the cleavage
furrows are not as pronounced as they are in zebrafish
(compare Fig. 4A and 4B). However, within the cytoplasm
at the areas where the 4 cells are in contact, distinct electron-dense structures were identified. These structures are
formed of amorphous inclusions with a granular fine
structure, lacking a surrounding membrane (Fig. 4D and
4F). Serial sections show that this is a rod-like structure
approximately 0.5 µm in diameter. These features of the
structure correspond to descriptions of germ plasm in
many species [40]. The fact that this structure is found
exclusively beneath the cleavage furrows, similar to the
germ plasm in zebrafish at the corresponding stage leads
us to suggest that the observed electron-dense material
represents the germ plasm of medaka.

Conclusion
Our findings in medaka are consistent with the suggestion
that the mode of PGC specification is conserved with
zebrafish and possibly other teleosts. First, we show that
dramatic alterations in somatic development (axis duplication and mesoderm formation alteration) do not alter
the PGC number in medaka, which appears inconsistent
with an inductive mode of PGC specification that depend
on signals from somatic cells. Second, the process of
germ-line specific RNA stabilization shown here for
medaka has been described for those organisms whose
PGCs are specified by inheritance of maternally provided
cytoplasmic determinants. Consistently, material resembling germ plasm was identified in 4-cell stage medaka
embryos. The apparent paradox that the vasa-homologue
of medaka differs from its zebrafish counterpart with
respect to its early spatial distribution and its ability to be
subjected to the "degradation-protection" control mechanism may be reconciled by the finding that vasa mRNA
appears to be dispensable for early PGC development in
zebrafish [41].

Methods
Synthesis of RNA for Embryo Injections
β-catenin sense RNA was transcribed from pT7Ts [34],
which contains the full-length zebrafish β-catenin cDNA.
The injection of the zebrafish 600 pg β-catenin RNA into
one of the marginal blastomeres of 8- and 16-cell stage
medaka embryos induced complete secondary axis in 3%
of the embryos. As a control, embryos were injected with
600 pg of GFP-globin RNA.

Zebrafish BMP2b and dominant negative truncated version of BMP2/4 receptor I (DN(BMP2/4RI)) were transcribed from pSP64TS and pSP64T respectively. Capped
synthetic mRNA were injected (1 nL) into the cytoplasm
of a single-cell Medaka embryo at different concentrations
(2 to 50 ng/µL and 40 to 200 ng/µL for BMP2b and
DN(BMP2/4RI) respectively).
The vasa-GFP construct includes the zebrafish full-length
vasa cDNA into which the mmGFP5 [42] open reading
frame (ORF) was inserted [37].
The GFP-nos1 3'UTR construct includes the mmGFP5 ORF
cloned upstream of the 3'UTR of the zebrafish nanos1 gene
[29]. The GFP-zfvasa 3'UTR construct was made by inserting the PCR amplified zebrafish vasa 3'UTR after GFP
(XhoI crated site).
The olvas-GFP construct was prepared by inserting the
mmGFP5 ORF into the SacII site in the full-length olvas
cDNA (obtained from the cab-wild-type strain using the
forward oligo AAAAAGCTTTCAGTTTGAAGCTAACAG-
