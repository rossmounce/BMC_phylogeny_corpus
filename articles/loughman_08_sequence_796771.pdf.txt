Abstract
Background: Fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA) mediates adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus
to fibronectin, fibrinogen and elastin. We previously reported that S. aureus strain P1 encodes an
FnBPA protein where the fibrinogen/elastin-binding domain (A domain) is substantially divergent in
amino acid sequence from the archetypal FnBPA of S. aureus NCTC8325, and that these variations
created differences in antigenicity. In this study strains from multilocus sequence types (MLST) that
spanned the genetic diversity of S.aureus were examined to determine the extent of FnBPA A
domain variation within the S. aureus population and its effect on ligand binding and immunocrossreactivity.
Results: Seven different isotype forms (I – VII) of the FnBPA A domain were identified which were
between 66 to 76% identical in amino acid sequence in any pair-wise alignment. The fnbA allelic
variants in strains of different multilocus sequence type were identified by DNA hybridization using
probes specific for sequences encoding the highly divergent N3 sub-domain of different isotypes.
Several isotypes were not restricted to specific clones or clonal complexes but were more widely
distributed. It is highly likely that certain fnbA genes have been transferred horizontally. Residues
lining the putative ligand-binding trench were conserved, which is consistent with the ability of each
A domain isotype to bind immobilized fibrinogen and elastin by the dock-latch-lock mechanism.
Variant amino acid residues were mapped on a three-dimensional model of the FnBPA A domain
and were predicted to be surface-exposed. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant
isotype I A domain bound that protein with a 4 – 7 fold higher apparent affinity compared to the
A domains of isotypes II – VII, while some monoclonal antibodies generated against the isotype I A
domain showed reduced or no binding to the other isotypes.
Conclusion: The FnBPA A domain occurs in at least 7 different isotypes which differ antigenically
and exhibit limited immuno-crossreactivity, yet retain their ligand-binding functions. Antigenic
variation of the FnBPA A domain may aid S. aureus to evade the host's immune responses. These
findings have implications for the development of vaccines or immunotherapeutics that target
FnBPA.

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal of the moist squamous epithelium of the human anterior nares [1]. It is
also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause conditions
ranging from superficial skin infections to serious invasive
diseases such as septicaemia, infective endocarditis and
septic arthritis [2].
S. aureus can express an array of surface proteins that
mediate bacterial binding to plasma proteins and constituents of the extracellular matrix [3], which promote colonization of diverse anatomical sites and contribute to
virulence. Many strains can express two distinct fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPA and FnBPB) which are
encoded by the two closely linked genes fnbA and fnbB
[4,5]. However some strains only contain a single gene
encoding FnBPA [6]. FnBPA can specifically bind to
fibronectin, fibrinogen and elastin [7-9]. FnBPA mediates
internalization of S. aureus into epithelial and endothelial
cells [7,10], promotes rapid aggregation of human platelets [11,12], and is a virulence factor in experimental
endocarditis and septic arthritis infection studies [13,14].
Previous work in our group has focused on the binding of
the FnBPA N-terminal A domain to fibrinogen and elastin
[8,15]. The A domain is predicted to comprise three separately folded sub-domains N1, N2, and N3, similar to the
fibrinogen-binding A domains of S. aureus ClfA and Staphylococcus epidermidis SdrG [16,17]. The X-ray crystal
structure of the N23 sub-domains of ClfA and SdrG have
been solved in their apo forms and show striking similarities to each other, despite the fact that they are only ~20%
identical at the amino acid level [16,17]. Sub-domains N2
and N3 are independently folded in a novel type of
immunoglobulin fold (DEv-IgG). The N2 and N3
domains of SdrG are separated by a hydrophobic trench,
which binds the fibrinogen β-chain peptide [17]. In silico
docking studies and mutagenesis revealed that the trench
separating N2 and N3 in ClfA is the binding site for the Cterminal fibrinogen γ-chain peptide [16]. A structural
model of the FnBPA A domain has a very similar conformation to the solved structures of SdrG and ClfA, including the hydrophobic trench [15]. Residues lining this
trench are crucial in binding of the FnBPA to both fibrinogen and elastin [15].
We previously demonstrated that the FnBPA A domain
from strain P1 differs substantially from 8325-4 FnBPA,
sharing only 73.5% identical amino acids. This was sufficient to create differences in surface-exposed epitopes
which affected immuno-crossreactivity, while ligand
binding activity was conserved [15]. This study aimed to
study a well-characterized strain collection of human origin [18], and human isolates where genomes have been
fully sequenced. Five novel FnBPA A domain isotypes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/74

were discovered. Many of the isotypes were distributed
widely amongst S.aureus strains of different MLST genotypes indicating horizontal transfer. Each isotype bound
to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin with similar apparent affinities. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
raised against the isotype I FnBPA A domain showed
reduced binding to other isotypes demonstrating differences in surface exposed epitopes between isotypes.

Results
fnbA gene variation in S. aureus whole-genome sequences
We previously reported that a portion of the fnbA gene
encoding the fibrinogen and elastin-binding A domain
(Figure 1) varied substantially in strain P1 compared to
the archetypal fnbA gene of strain 8325-4 [15], resulting
in FnBPA A domains which were 73.5% identical in
amino acid sequence. Amino acid substitutions were nonrandomly distributed resulting in sub-domain N1 being
the most conserved (91.4%), while sub-domains N2 and
N3 were more divergent (78.3% and 59.2% identities
respectively).

FnBPA A domain sequences from published S. aureus
genome sequences (COL, USA300, MRSA252, MSSA476,
MW2, N315 and Mu50) were analysed to determine if any
further variation within the A domain was apparent.
Amino acid sequences were aligned in pairwise combinations and the identities calculated. Strains COL, USA300
and 8325-4 contained highly similar FnBPA A domains
(one amino acid substitution in COL). This FnBPA A
domain is classified as isotype I. These three strains belong
to MLST clonal complex 8 (CC8) [19], indicating a close
phylogenetic relationship. Strain MRSA252 (ST-36),
which belongs to the CC30/39 clonal complex [20],
encoded an FnBPA A domain that was divergent from isotype I (75.3% identity) and is here called isotype II. Two
CC-1 strains (MSSA476, MW2) contained fnbA genes
specifying identical A domains, but shared only 76.7%
and 80.5% residue identity with isotypes I and II respectively, and are here called isotype III. CC-5 strains (N315,
Mu50) specified identical A domains that were very similar (94.5% amino acid identity) to the isotype III A
domains of ST-1 strains. Variation between the A domains
of ST-1 and ST-5 strains was confined to the N1 subdomains, while the N23 sub-domains were 100% identical. The classification of FnBPA A domains used in this
study (for reasons discussed below) is based on the minimal ligand-binding N23 sub-domains, and therefore the
ST-1 and ST-5 FnBPA A domains are classed as isotype III.
The FnBPA A domain from S. aureus strain P1 (ST-973),
which we analyzed previously [15], was divergent from
isotypes I, II and III and is called isotype IV. The divergent
N23 sub-domains of isotypes I – IV share between 66.6
and 75.5% identity in any pairwise alignment (Table 3).

Figure 1
Schematic representation of FnBPA from S. aureus 8325-4
Schematic representation of FnBPA from S. aureus 8325-4. (a) The N-terminus of FnBPA contains a signal sequence
(S) followed by a 475 amino acid A domain, part of which is the binding site for fibrinogen and elastin. Adjacent to the A
domain are eleven fibronectin-binding motifs that span residues 512–878 [27]. The C-terminus of FnBPA contains a prolinerich repeat (PRR), wall (W) and membrane (M)-spanning domains, and the sortase recognition motif LPETG. (b) The FnBPA A
domain is predicted to comprise three independently-folded sub-domains N1 (37–193), N2 (194–337), and N3 (338–511) [15].
The His-tagged recombinant A domain isotype proteins (I – VII) analyzed during this study comprise the N2 and N3 subdomains. Type-specific DNA probes used for typing fnbA genes from clinical isolates by DNA hybridization contain approximately 300 nucleotides that encode the central portion of the highly divergent N3 sub-domain. The diagram also indicates positions of general primers used for amplifying fnbA gene sequences that encode the entire A domain plus flanking sequence.
These fnbA gene fragments were used as templates in DNA hybridization experiments with type specific probes, and for
sequencing from a select number of strains.
The N1 sub-domains are more conserved, with average
identities of 90.5% between different isotypes. The C-terminal fibronectin-binding motifs 2 – 11 of FnBPA isotypes I – III were highly conserved in the genome
sequences indicating that FnBPA A domains alone, in particular the N23 sub-domains, are subject to variation.
Variation of FnBPA A domains in carriage and clinical S.
aureus strains
A collection of S. aureus strains isolated from carriers and
invasive disease patients has previously been analyzed by
MLST [18]. Eleven strains representing major clonal complexes (CC15, CC22, CC25, CC45), minor groups (CC12,
CC59, CC121), and singletons (ST-55, ST-101) were analyzed. Gene fragments encoding the entire A domain plus
some flanking sequence were amplified from genomic
DNA by PCR with flanking primers (Figure 1 and Table 2),
cloned and sequenced. The deduced A domain amino

acid sequences indicated that 10 out of 11 strains encoded
N23 sub-domains that are very similar to one of isotypes
I – IV described above. Strains from ST-15 and ST-55
encoded isotype I (N23 > 95% identity to 8325-4). Strains
from ST-30, ST-59, and ST-101 specfied isotype II (N23 >
97% identity to MRSA252). ST-22, ST-25, and ST-45
strains specified isotype III (N23 > 99% identity to
MSSA476). ST-121 and ST-123 strains specified isotype IV
(N23 > 96% identity to P1) (Table 1). A novel FnBPA N23
sub-domain sequence was found in S. aureus strain 3110
(ST-12) which was between 67.0% and 73.9% identical to
A domain isoypes I – IV (Table 3) and is here called isotype V.

we used DNA hybridization with isotype-specific probes
homologous to a portion of the highly divergent N3 subdomain. DNA encoding the entire A domain was amplified from strains to be typed (Table 2 and Figure 1). PCR
products were spotted onto membranes and hybridized
with the DIG-labelled type-specific probes. An example of
a hybridization experiment is shown in Figure 2. The
probes were shown to be type-specific as each probe only
hybridized to the appropriate control fnbA fragment (top
row of blots). This allowed for rapid typing of multiple
strains without the requirement for sequencing. In the
example shown, fnbA gene fragments of any given strain
only hybridized with one probe (Figure 2). The hybridiza-

tion data for A domain typing of strains is summarized in
Table 1.

fnbA DNA from S. aureus strains 19 (ST-10) and 3153
(ST-207) did not hybridize with any probe (Figure 2),
indicating that they express a novel FnBPA isotype. The
fnbA gene fragments from these two strains were cloned
and sequenced, and the deduced A domain protein
sequences were compared to the sequences of A domains
types I – V. The A domain of S. aureus strain 19 (ST-10)
was novel and is called isotype VI (N23, 65.9 – 69.1%
identical to isotypes I – V; Table 3). It was very similar
(97.8% identity) to the FnBPA A domain of bovine strain

* Pairwise alignments were performed using the amino acid sequences
of the N23 sub-domains of the FnBPA A domain. Sequences used in
the alignments were from the following S. aureus strains: isotype I –
8325-4; isotype II – MRSA252; isotype III – MSSA476; isotype IV – P1;
isotype V – 3110; isotype VI – 19; isotype VII – 3153.

Distribution of FnBPA isotypes I – VII in strains of different
MLST types
The N1 sub-domain of FnBPA is highly conserved (92.4%
amino acid identity between isotypes), while subdomains N2 and N3 are more divergent (77.5% and
66.2% average amino acid identity, respectively). Neighbour joining (NJ) trees based on DNA sequences of the
fnbA allelic variants demonstrate N2 and N3 sequences
appear to have co-evolved. For example, strains of ST-36,
ST-30, ST-59 and ST-101 have fnbA genes encoding isotype II A domains that are greater than 97% identical. In
the fnbA N2 NJ tree (Figure 3b) and the fnbA N3 NJ tree
(Figure 3c) sequences from these strains clustered
together. Similarly, strains carrying isotype I (ST-8, ST250, ST-15, ST-55), isotype III (ST-1, ST-5, ST-22, ST-25,
ST-45), isotype type IV (ST-121, ST-123, ST-973), or isotype VI (ST-10, ST-151) clustered similarly according to
N2 and N3 fnbA sequence (Figures 3b and 3c). Therefore
N2 and N3 sub-domains are always associated in a single
combination, which is likely to conserve ligand binding
functions. For this reason, we have defined isotypes based
on the highly variable N23 sub-domain amino acid
sequences.

FnBPA A domain typing of S. aureus strains by dot blot hybridization
Figure 2
FnBPA A domain typing of S. aureus strains by dot blot hybridization. Genomic DNA from S. aureus isolates was
purified, and the fnbA gene fragment encoding the entire A domain was amplified by PCR. Five ng purified fnbA DNA from each
isolate was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with DIG-labelled fnbA type-specific probes corresponding to
isotype I (a), isotype II (b), isotype III (c), isotype IV (d) and isotype V (e). fnbA DNA from isolates 8325-4, MRSA252,
MSSA476, P1 and 3110 (top row of blots) were used as controls. The MLST genotypes of strains typed here are given in Table
1.

The N1 sub-domain sequences appear to have evolved in
distinct manner from the N23 sub-domain sequences
(Figure 3). For example, isotype III (N23) A domains of
MSSA476 (ST-1) and N315 (ST-5) are 100% identical,
while their N1 sub-domains have only 86.2% identity.

Evolutionary relationships of fnbA N1, N2 and N3 allele sequences
Evolutionary relationships of fnbA N1, N2 and N3 allele sequences. fnbA gene segments encoding the entire FnBPA A
domain were sequenced from 14 isolates from divserse MLST genotypes. Strain P1 (ST-973)fnbA was sequenced previously
[15]. In addition, the fnbA gene sequences from MSSA 476 (ST-1); N315 (ST-5); MRSA252 (ST-36); COL (ST-250); RF122 (ST151) as well as the archetype fnbA sequence from 8325-4 (ST-8) were included. The evolutionary history was inferred using the
Neighbor-Joining method [43]. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed using fnbA DNA sequences encoding the subdomains N1 (a), N2 (b) and N3 (c) using MEGA 3. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches [44]. The phylogenetic tree was linearized
assuming equal evolutionary rates in all lineages [45]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site.

Binding of FnBPA A domains isotypes I – VII to immobilized
fibrinogen and elastin
The minimum ligand binding N23 sub-domains of isotype I and isotype IV were studied previously [15]. Here
the N23 sub-domains of isotypes II, III, V, VI and VII were
also expressed. Each isotype bound to immobilized
fibrinogen and elastin in a dose-dependent and saturable

aureus ClfA, the X-ray crystal structure of which has been
solved [16]. A 3D model of the isotype I A domain of
FnBPA closely resembles the ClfA structure [15]. Variant
residues between isotypes I and IV were predicted to be
mostly exposed on the surface of the protein model [15].
A similar analysis was performed here which showed that
the variant residues of isotypes II, III, V, VI and VII were
predicted to be exposed on the A domain surface (data not
shown). Residues that were identified by mutagenesis as
important in fibrinogen and elastin binding by the Type I
A domain [15] were highly conserved across all isotypes.
Structural models of isotypes II – VII were generated using
the web based PHYRE program (data not shown) based
on the crystal structure of ClfA. Each showed striking similarities to the isotype I model [15] (data not shown).

Figure 4 shows a NJ phylogenetic tree based upon the concatenated sequences of the 7 alleles used for MLST analysis. As MLST reflects the evolution of the stable core
genome [22], this tree depicts the phylogenetic relatedness of the S. aureus strains studied here (Table 1). It is
separated into two major groupings which reflect previous
phylogenetic analysis using MLST alleles plus additional
sequences from unlinked loci [23]. Some fnbA allelic variants were not restricted to specific clones or lineages, but
were widely distributed throughout the population. For
example, several strains from CC30/39 (ST-30, ST-36, ST37, ST-39, ST-2) contained FnBPA isotype II (Figure 4), as
did distantly related strains from Group 2 (ST-9, ST-20,
ST-101). Also isotype III was found in Group 2 strains of
ST-1, ST-5 and ST-25 and in Group 1 strains of ST-22 and
ST-45 (Figure 4). Conversely, closely related types such as
ST-80 and ST-12 in Group 2 have fnbA genes encoding
isotypes VII and V respectively. The fnbA allele of the ST80 strain H7639 was determined from a recent study of
polymorphic genes in S. aureus [21]. These data suggest
that fnbA genes have occasionally been horizontally transmitted between strains of different lineages.

Binding of recombinant A domain isoypes I – VII to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin
Binding of recombinant A domain isoypes I – VII to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin. Microtitre dishes were
coated with human fibrinogen (a) or human aortic elastin (b). Wells were blocked and then incubated with recombinant A
domain proteins isotype I (closed squares), isotype II (closed circles), isotype III (open squares), isoype IV (open circles), isoype
V (closed triangles), isoype VI (open diamonds), and isoype VII (open triangles) at the indicated concentrations. Bound A
domain proteins were detected by incubation with mouse anti-hexahistidine monoclonal antibody 7E8, then HRP-conjugated

half maximum at 15 – 20 nM (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the previous report for isotype I and IV [15]. The
conservation of binding activity across all isotypes indicates that ligand binding by the FnBPA A domain is biologically important for S. aureus.
Binding of antibodies to isotypes I – VII
The majority of variant residues between different A
domain types were predicted to be exposed on the surface.
This might create differences in surface-exposed epitopes
that affect antigenicity. We previously demonstrated that
polyclonal antibodies raised against isotype I reacted less
efficiently with isotype IV by Western immunoblotting
[15]. Here the ability of polyclonal anti-isotype I antibodies to bind different isotypes was measured by ELISA. Each
protein coated the microtitre wells with equal efficiency
when detected with anti-hexahistidine monoclonal antibody 7E8 (data not shown). Rabbit anti-isotype I antibodies had a 4 – 7 fold lower affinity for isotypes II – VII
compared to isotype I (Figure 6a). Thus amino acid variation creates differences in surface-exposed epitopes on the
A domain molecule that affect immuno-crossreactivity.

Several mouse monoclonal antibodies (1F9, 1G8, 7C5,
1E6 and 7B7) directed against isotype I were tested by
ELISA for binding to each isotype. Antibodies 7C5 and
1E6 bound efficiently to isotype I but showed little binding to isotypes II – VII (Figure 6d and 6e) indicating that
the 7C5 and 1E6 epitope is only present on isotype I. Similarly, monoclonal antibody 7B7 reacted strongly with
isotype I, but bound poorly to isotypes II – VII (Figure 6f)
indicating that only part of the 7B7 epitope is present on
A domains II – VII. 1F9 and 1G8 had a high affinty for isotypes I, III, IV, V and VI and a lower affinity for isotype II
and VII (Figure 6b and 6c) indicating that they recognise
a relatively conserved epitope which is partially absent in
isotypes II and VII. It is possible that the IF9 and 1G8 bind
the same or overlapping epitopes.
We previously reported that monclonal antibodies 7C5,
1E6, 1F9 and 1G8 failed to bind to isotype IV by Western
blotting and that they bound weakly to isotype I [15]. 1E6
and 7C5 did not react with the isotype IV protein by ELISA
while 1F9 and 1G8 reacted well (Figure 6). This discrepancy may be explained by inefficient refolding after denaturation in Western immunoblotting.

Discussion
We have reported on the substantial sequence diversity in
fnbA genes amongst S. aureus isolates giving rise to 7 isoforms of the FnBPA A domain, which are between 24.5
and 34.1% divergent in amino acid sequence. There was
strong conservation of residues known to be involved in
ligand binding by isotype I, which were predicted to line
the putative ligand-binding trench in a 3D structural
model [15]. This conservation is consistent with the ability of each isotype to bind immobilized fibrinogen and
elastin with similar affinities. Ligand-binding by the
FnBPA A domain is therefore likely to be biologically
important to S. aureus in vivo.
The variant residues between isotypes were mapped on
the 3D-structural model of the A domain, and the vast
majority were predicted to be surface exposed. Antibody
binding experiments were performed to demonstrate that
variation between isotypes affected their antigenicity. Polyclonal antibodies against isotype I had reduced affinity
for isotypes II – VII. Some monoclonal antibodies raised
against isotype I had little or no affinity for all other isotypes, while others reacted well with some isotypes and
not others. Sequence variation has therefore created differences in epitopes between different FnBPA A domain
isotypes.
FnBPA has been documented as an important virulence
factor of S. aureus, contributing to experimental endocarditis and septic arthritis infections [13,14]. Carriage of the
fnbA gene by S. aureus was found to be significantly more
common in invasive isolates compared to carriage isolates
[24], suggesting a role in pathogenicity. Studies on the
immune responses of individuals exposed to invasive S.
aureus infections have shown that serum antibody titres
against FnBPA rise as a result of infection [25,26]. Antibodies directed against the A domain were greatly elevated in sera of patients who had endocarditis caused by
S. aureus, compared to sera of healthy controls [25]. This
indicates that FnBPA is expressed in vivo, is immunogenic, and that the host mounts a robust immune
response against this antigen. The evolution of the FnBPA
A domain into distinct isotypes with different antigenicities may have been driven by the need to evade the host
immune responses during infection.
It is interesting to note that variation amongst FnBPA
appears to be confined to the A domain. Analysis of entire
fnbA genes from sequenced genomes reveals that the
FnBPA C-terminal fibronectin-binding motifs 2 – 11 are
highly conserved in amino acid sequence. This is an
unfolded domain lacking secondary structure, and undergoes a conformational change to an ordered β-sheet structure upon binding to fibronectin [27]. Anti-FnBPA
antibodies are generated during infection that recognize

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/74

both the A domain and the fibronectin-binding motifs
[25,28]. The antibodies directed against the fibronectinbinding motifis predominantly recognize epitopes
formed in the β-sheet structure when fibronectin is bound
to FnBPA. Ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) antibodies
are not function-blocking [28]. Indeed, it has been suggested that LIBS antibodies may be beneficial by stabilizing fibronectin binding and thus enhancing bacterial
adherence to the host tissue [29]. In contrast the FnBPA A
domain is likely to be projected away from the bacterial
cell and to be recognized by opsonizing antiodies. However, there is no obvious explanation as to why FnPBA A
domains have diverged so much whereas proteins with
similar A domains such as ClfA and ClfB are much less
divergent [21].
Individuals who carry S. aureus have an increased chance
of developing invasive disease that is usually caused by
the carriage strain, but have a lower mortality rate than
non-carriers that develop S. aureus bacteremia [30,31].
Carriers have been shown to mount an immune response
against the superantigens that are specifically expressed by
their colonizing strain [32]. Generation of a strain-specific
immune response might explain the improved prognosis
of carriers compared to non-carriers [32]. A similar phenomenon might occur with FnBPA, whereby carriers
mount a specific immune response to the FnBPA isotype
expressed by their colonizing strain and prime the
immune system to mount a robust anti-FnBPA antibody
response during infection. Conversely, FnBPA variation
may help strains to infect individuals previously exposed
to a different isotype.
The fnbA allelic variants encoding many of the 7 A domain
isotypes were widely distributed. Several isotypes were not
restricted to specific clones or clonal complexes. Indeed,
the same A domain isotype was often found in strains that
are distantly related based upon the phylogenetic analysis.
This suggests that horizontal transfer of fnbA loci has
occurred. Similarly, there is evidence of horizontal transfer of staphylocoagulase serotypes [33]. For example, the
fnbA allelic variants found in strains representative of
CC1, CC5, CC22, CC25 and CC45 encoded isotype III A
domains that were extremely similar (> 99% amino acid
identity), yet these strains belong to distantly related
clonal complexes. Indeed, the fnbA allele we sequenced
from a ST-22 strain was identical to the fnbA gene of ST-1
strains MSSA476 and MW2, which suggests a recent
recombination event. Further evidence for horizontal
transfer is the presence of two different FnBPA A domains
isotypes in strains of the same MLST genotye (ST-45). We
found allelic variants encoding isotype III in ST-45. The
study of Kuhn et al [21] describes two ST-45 strains carrying fnbA alleles 11 and 12, which encode isotype II A
domains, while other ST-45 strains were found carrying

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:74

alleles 14 and 16, which encode type III A domains. This
shows that fnbA genes encoding isotype II or III A
domains are present in ST-45 strains. It has been suggested
that CC45 and CC30/39 share a common ancestor [23],
so perhaps ancestral ST-45 strains specified isotype II as in
CC30/39 and that horizontal transfer was responsible for
establishing the isotype III A domain in certain ST-45
strains.
The FnBPB A domain appears to have evolved in the same
way as FnBPA described here. Analysis of the FnBPB A
domains obtained from genome sequences has identified
three FnBPB isotypes and a further four FnBPB A domain
isotypes were identified by hybridization and DNA
sequencing (F.M. Burke and T.J.F., unpublished data). Evidence for interstrain recombination came from the occurrence of different FnBPA and FnBPB isotype combinations
in different strains.
Amongst the FnBPA A domain, it appears that the minimum ligand-binding truncate (sub-domains N2 and N3)
have evolved in parallel into at least 7 distinct isotype
groupings. This is clearly illustrated in the neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees based upon fnbA sub-domain
sequences, where a particular N2 sub-domain is always
found in association with a particular N3 sub-domain.
The phylogeny of the N1 sub-domain appeared to differ
from that of the N23 sub-domain. For example, the
amino acid sequence of the FnBPA N23 sub-domain from
N315 and Mu50 (ST-5; isotype III) is identical to the N23
sub-domain from MSSA476 and MW2 (both ST-1). However, their N1 sub-domains are only 86.2% identical. Perhaps recombination may have occurred within fnbA genes
to switch segments encoding domains N23 and N1.

Conclusion
We have identified seven isotypes of the N-terminal A
domain of FnBPA in a collection of S. aureus strains representing the genetic diversity of the species. Isotypes are on
average 29.3% divergent in amino acid sequnce. Each isotype is functional with respect to ligand-binding activity,
but they differ in immuno-crossreactivity, which may play
a role in immune evasion. Isotypes are distributed randomly throughout the S. aureus population, and homologous recombination may be involved in dissemination of
fnbA loci amongst S. aureus. These data have implications
for the FnBPA A domain as a target for a vaccine or immunotherapeutic.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Escherichia coli strains were cultivated on L-agar and Lbroth with shaking at 37°C. E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was routinely used for cloning. E. coli Topp 3 (Qiagen) was used for the expression of recombinant FnBPA A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/74

domain proteins. Ampicillin (100 μg ml-1) was incorporated into growth media where appropriate. S. aureus
strains (Table 1) were isolated from individuals from
Oxfordshire, U.K, and had previously been characterized
by MLST [18]. S. aureus strains were cultivated on TSA agar
and BHI broth.
Preparation of genomic DNA from S. aureus
Cultures were grown in 5 ml BHI broth at 37°C with shaking for 24 h. Genomic DNA was prepared using the Edge
Biosystems Bacterial Genomic DNA purification kit with
the addition of 100 μg ml-1 lysostaphin at the cell lysis
step. DNA pellets were washed with 70% v/v ethanol, airdried, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA).
Cloning of fnbA gene fragments
Primers pfnbA Adom F1 and pfnbA Adom R1, corresponding to DNA encoding the signal sequence and
fibronectin binding domain 2 respectively (Table 2 and
Figure 1), were designed from conserved sequences in
fnbA genes from publicly available S. aureus genomes.
DNA encoding the entire FnBPA A domain along with
flanking sequences was amplified, cleaved with BamHI
and HindIII (Boehringer Mannheim) at restriction sites
incorporated into the primers, ligated using T4 DNA
ligase (Roche) to pBluescript KS+ DNA cleaved with the
same enzymes, and finally transformed into E. coli XL1Blue cells using standard procedures [34]. Transformants
harbouring cloned fnbA gene fragments were selected on
L-agar with ampicillin and 80 μg ml-1 of the chromogenic
substrate
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside
(Melford Laboratories, Ipswich, U.K.). Plasmid DNA was
purified from transformants using the Favorgen Plasmid
DNA Extraction Mini Kit (Favorgen Biotech Corp). The
cloned fnbA gene fragments were sequenced using T3 and
T7 primers by GATC Biotech AG (Germany). The EMBL
accession numbers for the sequences reported in this
paper are AM749002 – AM749015.
DNA hybridization using fnbA type-specific probes
Genomic DNA samples from clinical isolates were used as
the template in PCR reactions with primers pfnbA Adom
F1 and pfnbA Adom R1 (Table 2 and Figure 1) to amplify
the entire coding region of the FnBPA A domain. PCR
amplimers were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and
PCR Clean-Up System kit (Promega) Five ng of fnbA DNA
was spotted onto positively-charged nylon membranes
(Roche) and allowed to air-dry. Membranes were incubated for 5 min on blotting paper soaked in denaturation
solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH), 5 min in neutralization solution (1.5 M NaCl, 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and
finally for 15 min on blotting paper soaked with 2× SSC
solution (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM tri-sodium citrate). DNA
was fixed on the membranes by incubation at 120°C for

30 min. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at 68°C in
pre-hybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.1% w/v N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% w/v SDS and 1× Blocking reagent
(Roche)). DIG-labelled probes complementary to DNA
encoding isotype I – V N3 sub-domains were synthesised
by PCR using type-specific probe primers (Table 2 and Figure 1) and PCR DIG labelling mix (Roche). Probes were
denatured by boiling at 95°C for 10 min, diluted in prehybridization solution and incubated with nylon membranes for 18 h at 68°C. Following hybridization, the
membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC/0.1% w/v
SDS at room temperature followed by two washes with
0.5× SSC/0.1% w/v SDS at 68°C for 20 min. Membranes
were equilibrated for 30 min in maleic acid buffer (100
mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and bound DIGlabelled probes were detected by incubation for 30 min
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody
(Roche) diluted 1:10,000 in maleic acid buffer. After
washing twice with maleic acid buffer containing 0.3% v/
v Tween 20, the chemiluminescence substrate CSPD
(Roche) was used to detect bound anti-DIG antibodies
and membranes were exposed to X-OMAT UV Plus Film
(Kodak).
Expression of recombinant FnBPA A domain proteins
pQE30 expressing the minimal ligand-binding FnBPA A
domain truncate (N23: residues 194 – 511) from S. aureus
8325-4 and S. aureus P1 (residues 194 – 512) were
described previously [15]. pQE30 expressing His-tagged
N23 A domains of isotypes II, III, V, VI and VII were constructed with pQE30 vector primer pairs (Table 2 and Figure 1) and genomic DNA templates from strains
MRSA252 (ST-36), MSSA476 (ST-1), 3110 (ST-12), 19
(ST-10) and 3153 (ST-207), respectively. Each construct
was verified by sequencing (GATC Biotech AG, Germany)
and transformed into E. coli Topp 3 for protein expression
and purification. Proteins were purified by Ni2+ chelate
chromatography [34]. Concentrations were determined
using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Proteins were
dialysed against PBS for 24 h at 4°C, aliquoted and stored
at -70°C.
Binding of recombinant FnBPA proteins to immobilized
elastin and fibrinogen
Human aortic elastin (Elastin Products Company) and
human fibrinogen (Calbiochem) were coated onto Nunc
96-well microtitre dishes (1 μg protein well-1) for 18 h
under UV light and at 4°C respectively. Wells were
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with
2% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBST
buffer (BSA-PBST) for 2 h at 37°C. Following three
washes with PBST, various concentrations of purified
FnBPA isotype proteins in 2% w/v BSA-PBST were added
to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/74

with shaking. Wells were washed three times with PBST
buffer and bound proteins were detected with monoclonal antibody 7E8 (90 ng well-1) that recognises the Nterminal hexahistidine fusion tag. Following incubation
for 1 h with shaking at room temperature, the wells were
washed three times with PBST followed by 100 μl per well
of goat-anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradishperoxidase (HRP, Dako; Denmark) diluted 1:2000 in 2%
w/v BSA-PBST. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, wells were washed three times with PBST, and bound
HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected with 10 μg per
well of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma) in
0.05 M phosphate-citrate buffer containing 0.006% (v/v)
hydrogen peroxide. After incubation at room temperature
for 5 min the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 M
H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with an
ELISA plate reader (Multiskan EX, Labsystems).
ELISA assays
Various concentrations of recombinant FnBPA A domain
proteins in PBS were coated onto Nunc 96-well microtitre
dishes for 18 h at 4°C. Wells were washed and blocked
with BSA for 2 h as described above. Following three
washes with PBST, 100 μl of anti-FnBPA A domain antibodies diluted in BSA-PBST (1.8 μg polyclonal IgG ml-1;
2.5 μg monoclonal IgG ml-1), were added to each well and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies 7C5, 1E6, 1F9 and
1G8 raised against the isotype I A domain of FnBPA from
S. aureus 8325-4 were described previously [8,11,15].
Monoclonal antibody 7B7 was generated by immunizing
mice with recombinant Type I FnBPA A domain (N123
sub-domains) as described previously [11]. After 1 h incubation the wells were washed three times with PBST. Goat
anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated antibodies or goat antimouse IgG-HRP conjugated antibodies (Dako, Denmark), each diluted 1:2000 in BSA-PBST, were added to
the wells and incubated for 1 h. After washing three times
with PBST, bound HRP-conjugated antibodies were
detected as described above.
Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis of FnBPA A
domain isotypes
Protein sequences were aligned in pairwise combinations
to calculate amino acid identity using the ExPASY SIM
alignment tool [35]. Alignments of multiple protein
sequences to view areas of conservation amongst A
domains were performed using T-Coffee [36]. Theoretical
3D models of A domain isotpyes I – VII were generated
using PHYRE Protein Fold Recognition Server [37]. Protein structure files were viewed using PyMOL [38], which
allowed visualization of the distribution of variant residues between isotypes. The concatenated MLST allele
sequences of S. aureus strains were downloaded from the
MLST database [39]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolu-

tionary analyses of fnbA gene sequences and concatenated
MLST allele sequences were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 [40]. The overall relatedness of the MLST population of S. aureus was visualized using eBURST [41,42].
