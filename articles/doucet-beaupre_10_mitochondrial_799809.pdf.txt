inheritance of mtDNA

Abstract
Background: Doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) is an atypical system of animal mtDNA inheritance found only
in some bivalves. Under DUI, maternally (F genome) and paternally (M genome) transmitted mtDNAs yield two
distinct gender-associated mtDNA lineages. The oldest distinct M and F genomes are found in freshwater mussels
(order Unionoida). Comparative analyses of unionoid mitochondrial genomes and a robust phylogenetic framework
are necessary to elucidate the origin, function and molecular evolutionary consequences of DUI. Herein, F and M
genomes from three unionoid species, Venustaconcha ellipsiformis, Pyganodon grandis and Quadrula quadrula have
been sequenced. Comparative genomic analyses were carried out on these six genomes along with two F and
one M unionoid genomes from GenBank (F and M genomes of Inversidens japanensis and F genome of Lampsilis
ornata).
Results: Compared to their unionoid F counterparts, the M genomes contain some unique features including a
novel localization of the trnH gene, an inversion of the atp8-trnD genes and a unique 3’coding extension of the
cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene. One or more of these unique M genome features could be causally
associated with paternal transmission. Unionoid bivalves are characterized by extreme intraspecific sequence
divergences between gender-associated mtDNAs with an average of 50% for V. ellipsiformis, 50% for I. japanensis,
51% for P. grandis and 52% for Q. quadrula (uncorrected amino acid p-distances). Phylogenetic analyses of 12
protein-coding genes from 29 bivalve and five outgroup mt genomes robustly indicate bivalve monophyly and the
following branching order within the autolamellibranch bivalves: ((Pteriomorphia, Veneroida) Unionoida).
Conclusion: The basal nature of the Unionoida within the autolamellibranch bivalves and the previously
hypothesized single origin of DUI suggest that (1) DUI arose in the ancestral autolamellibranch bivalve lineage and
was subsequently lost in multiple descendant lineages and (2) the mitochondrial genome characteristics observed
in unionoid bivalves could more closely resemble the DUI ancestral condition. Descriptions and comparisons
presented in this paper are fundamental to a more complete understanding regarding the origins and
consequences of DUI.

Background
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the only extranuclear
genome in animal cytoplasm. Located in the matrix of
mitochondria, metazoan mtDNA is normally a small circular DNA molecule about 14-16 kilobases (kb) long
usually encoding the same 37 genes ([1,2]; but see [3]
for exceptions). Typically, all mtDNAs in the zygote
come from the oocyte and even though evidence for
occasional paternal leakage has been reported [4,5], animal mtDNA is thought to strictly follow maternal
inheritance [6]. This clonal inheritance coupled with the
successive cell divisions that represent sequential bottlenecks for the mitochondrial population [6-8] result in
an essentially homoplasmic state for mtDNA. An
extreme exception to the paradigm of strict maternal
inheritance of animal mtDNA (SMI) is found in three
bivalve lineages (i.e., the orders Mytiloida, Unionoida
and Veneroida), which possess an unusual system
termed doubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA (DUI)
(see [9,10] for reviews).
In DUI-possessing organisms, distinct gender-associated
mitochondrial DNA lineages coexist: a female-transmitted
(F) genome and a male-transmitted (M) genome. Under
DUI, female bivalves transmit their mitochondria (carrying
F mtDNA) to both sons and daughters, as in SMI, but
males pass on their mitochondria (via sperm carrying M
mtDNA) to only sons (e.g., [11] but see [12]). At the organismal level, male bivalves with DUI are thus heteroplasmic and contain both M and F genomes. In male somatic
tissues, the F genome predominates while in male gonadal
tissues, the M genome is predominant [13] and it appears
to be the exclusive type in sperm [14]. In females, both
somatic and gonadal tissues typically contain the F genome, but the occasional presence of a small amount of the
M genome has been demonstrated in somatic tissues and
ovaries of some species [12-16].
The broad taxonomic distribution of DUI within the
Bivalvia (e.g., [17-26]) reinforces the idea that it evolved
once in an ancestral bivalve lineage, from standard uniparental inheritance, and was lost in some descendant
bivalve lineages (e.g., oysters and probably scallops)
[23,27,28]. DUI could then be the ancestral condition
for the Bivalvia, however, a more definitive statement to
this effect rests on producing a more reliable bivalve
phylogeny along with clarifying the distribution of DUI
in additional bivalve lineages. Although many of the
essential elements of DUI have been described, (i.e., distinct M and F lineages, heteroplasmy in males, rapid
molecular evolution particularly of M types
[17-19,21,22,24,29-31], the current and/or historical
function of DUI still remains a mystery. Comparisons
of entire F and M genomes (as opposed to partial
sequences of a few genes) will enable the characterization

Page 2 of 19

of potential gene content/organizational/functional differences between the M and F genomes, and will help to
reconstruct the history of any possible recombination
and/or gene translocation events in these distinct, gender-associated lineages.
To date, 15 complete or nearly complete F and M
mtDNA genome sequences are available for species with
DUI but these are numerically biased towards marine
taxa (i.e., species from the Mytiloida and Veneroida)
[32-37] (Table 1). While the vertebrate mitochondrial
gene order is almost invariant, mollusks, and bivalves in
particular, exhibit radical rearrangements of mitochondrial genes and extensive mtDNA variability at the intrageneric level [2,38,39]. For example, the two congeneric
oyster species Crassostrea virginica and C. gigas, both
lacking DUI [28], show broad differences in gene content and gene order with relocation of most tRNA genes
[2,40]. At the species level, the extent of genome rearrangement between the two distinct gender-associated
mitochondrial genomes appears to vary greatly among
the three divergent bivalve lineages. In the Mytiloida,
the gene order and content of F and M genomes from a
species are conserved but both lack the gene for ATPase
subunit 8 (atp8) and have a second tRNA gene for
methionine (trnM) [31,34,36]. By contrast, in the marine
clam Venerupis philippinarum, gene content differs
between M and F genomes as we observe a gene duplication for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene
(cox2) in the F genome and an extra trnM in the M
genome, and both genomes have a short atp8 gene (37
amino acids) the function of which is unclear [2,41]. In
freshwater mussels, an M genome-specific 3’ extension
of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene (Mcox2)
has been clearly demonstrated [22,25,42]. This functional extension is a unique feature of unionoid M genomes and typically yields an ~80% increase in gene
length relative to the female-transmitted cox2 gene [43].
In unionoid bivalves, the presence of atp8 has been confirmed in both M and F genomes [2,37]. Also, the F
genomes of Inversidens japanensis and Hyriopsis cumingii (both in the subfamily Gonideinae) exhibit a different
gene order compared with the M genome of I. japanensis and the F genome of Lampsilis ornata ([37]; Zheng
RL and Li JL, personal communication) (see Table 1).
Analysis of gene order for additional F and M mtDNA
genomes from freshwater mussels will allow us to test
the following alternative hypotheses: (1) the translocation of several genes as observed in the F genomes of I.
japanensis and H. cumingii represents an idiosyncratic
gene rearrangement unique to these species or to the
subfamily Gonideinae or (2) that this gene arrangement
is in fact a characteristic shared with other unionoid
species’ F genomes or other subfamily.

Having additional unionoid F and M genomes available for comparative analyses would also significantly
illuminate investigations into the likely unique origin of
DUI [26]. Analyses of morphological and molecular
datasets indicate that unionoid bivalves, together with
trigonioid bivalves, compose a monophyletic subclass,
the Paleoheterodonta, [44-49]. The relative antiquity of
this subclass within the Bivalvia is supported by the
molecular sequence-based phylogenies, presented in
Hoeh et al. ([45]: Figure three), Giribet and Wheeler
([47]: Figure five), Giribet and Distel ([48]: Figure three
point five) and Dreyer and Steiner ([41]: Figure five),
which suggest that the Paleoheterodonta are a product
of an early cladogenic event in extant autolamellibranch
(~suspension-feeding) bivalves. Given the hypothesized
relatively basal position of unionoids in the bivalve phylogeny, their mt genomes could retain ancestral character states that are informative with respect to the initial
mt genome duplication event (i.e., the formation of a
distinct male-transmitted lineage in addition to a
female-transmitted lineage) that led to the evolution of
DUI.
In the present study, six new complete mitochondrial
genomes, namely, the F and M genomes of the unionoid
bivalves Venustaconcha ellipsiformis (Unionoida: Unionidae: Ambleminae: Lampsilini), Pyganodon grandis
(Unionoida: Unionidae: Unioninae: Anodontini) and
Quadrula quadrula (Unionoida: Unionidae: Ambleminae: Quadrulini), were compared with the available
complete genomes of DUI species deposited in GenBank
and their gene order, gene content and variation were
analyzed. Additionally, complete bivalve mt genomes
were phylogenetically analyzed to further test the
hypothesized basal position of the Paleoheterodonta
among extant autolamellibranch bivalves and to evaluate
the evolutionary history of mitogenomic character state
changes. The aim is to provide a context for comparisons of mt genomes among DUI and non-DUI bivalve
lineages, and ultimately to identify the gene region(s)
involved in the manifestation of DUI. Such descriptions
and comparisons will contribute to a more complete
picture of the evolution not only of the DUI system per
se, but also of the factors involved in the near universal
presence of SMI in animals.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis

The majority-rule codon-based BI tree (Figure 1),
derived from using concatenated sequences of mitochondrial protein-coding genes, is well resolved and
very similar in topology to the best BI tree produced
from analysis of amino acids as well as to the best
nucleotide- and amino acid-based ML and parsimony
trees (not shown). In summation, these trees clearly

pteriomorph and veneroid bivalves are reciprocally
monophyletic with unionoid bivalves being sister to
Pteriomorphia+Veneroida, (3) the F and M clades in
unionoids are reciprocally monophyletic and (4) branch

absence of DUI (Figure 2A), using the MK1 model,

(P. grandis) and 16,970 bp (Q. quadrula). The length differences are mainly due to the presence of a unique M
genome-specific 3’ extension of the cytochrome c oxidase
subunit 2 (cox2) gene and longer unassigned/noncoding
regions in M genomes. The A+T composition is very
similar among the six newly sequenced genomes but
higher than F and M I. japanensis (Table 2). Ribosomal
RNA genes and protein-coding genes (except atp8) of M
and F genomes of V. ellipsiformis, P. grandis and Q.
quadrula are arranged identically but tRNA order differs
among the analyzed genomes (Figure 3). In unionoids,
ten or eleven genes out of ~37 are located on one strand
and all the other genes on the opposite (Figure 3).
tRNA Histidine

In the three newly sequenced M genomes of this study,
tRNA histidine (trnH) is positioned between nd5 and nd1
while in F genomes it is located between nd2 and nd3
(Figure 3). The location of the trnH gene in the I. japanensis M genome has previously been identified between
cox1 and cox2 (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, personal
communication). This location also corresponds to

Mcox2e. However, our reannotation of the I. japanensis
M genome identifies trnH between nd5 and nd1 as in the
three new M genomes. Examination of 41 entire mt genomes across the Mollusca allows us to group some
classes of mollusks according to the position of trnH. For
example, nd5-trnH-nd4 (encoded on the heavy strand)
is the common organization in the Cephalopoda while
nd4-trnH-nd5 (encoded on the light strand) and cox2trnG-trnH-trnQ-trnL2-atp8 (encoded on both strands)
are two most common arrangements found in the Gastropoda. Except for unionoids genomes, no common
arrangement is found in bivalves and the arrangement of
the trnH-containing region appears to be unique to each
genus or species sequenced to date. Nd2-trnR-trnH-nd4
is found in the genus Crassostrea spp. (oysters) whereas
the marine mussels Mytilus spp. possess the arrangement
nd2-trnR-trnW-trnA-trnS-trnH-trnP-nd3. Because of the
current uncertainty regarding molluscan phylogeny, a
rigorous ancestral character state reconstruction is not
possible. However, the arrangement observed in Mytilus
spp. could be an inversion (+ strand reversion) of the

nd3-trnH-trnA-trnS1-trnS2-nd2 observed in the unionoid F genomes. In the four unionoid M genomes, trnH is
located between nd5 and nd1 and the only other molluscan species with a similar location for its trnH (i.e., nd5trnL-trnH-nd1) is the patellogastropod limpet Lottia
digitalis. The gene order of the L. digitalis mt genome is
the most divergent among all gastropod mtDNAs
sequenced thus far [50].
Extension of the M cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene

The three analyzed M genomes possess the unique 3’
extension of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene
(Mcox2e) [22]. In the three newly sequenced M genomes,
the extension is 187 codons (V. ellipsiformis and P.
grandis) or 186 codons (Q. quadrula) in length while the
I. japanensis extension is slightly shorter with 181 codons.

Atp8 gene

As in the F genome of L. ornata [37] and the reannotated
F and M genomes of I. japanensis [2], the newly
sequenced F and M genomes contain the 13 protein-coding genes commonly found in other animal mtDNAs.
Only the M genome of P. grandis appears to lack a complete atp8. In this species, a remnant of the atp8 gene
that corresponds to the first 15 amino acids
(MPQLSPVYWVSIFFL) of the protein, and that shows
similarities with other atp8 genes sequenced in this study,
has been identified between trnD and atp6 (Figure 3).
Those 15 amino acids are followed by a complete stop
codon. After the stop codon, we also identified an open
reading frame, in a different frame than the first 15 amino
acids, which could correspond to the remainder of atp8.

NADH dehydrogenase subunits 4 and 4L genes

Most unionoid mt genomes examined in this study have
an overlap of 7 bp for subunits 4 and 4L of the NADH
dehydrogenase complex (nd4 and nd4l). Two exceptions
are the M genome of V. ellipsiformis, which contains a
noncoding region of 120 bp between nd4 and nd4l, and
the F genome of I. japanensis, which possesses one
nucleotide between those two genes.
Base composition and codon usage

The base composition bias of an individual strand can
be described by skewness [51], where CG-skew = (C G)/(C + G) and AT-skew = (A - T)/(A + T). The strand
encoding most of the proteins (including cox1) from the
F and M genomes of all unionoid species has strong
negative CG- and AT-skews (Table 2). Skews calculated
for the opposite strand in all six genomes indicate complementary strand bias, with positive CG- and AT-skew
values (Table 2), an expected result since, for example,
A-skew on one strand is usually balanced by T-skew on
the other [52].
Transfer RNA genes

In all eight unionoid mt genomes, we identified all 22
tRNA genes according to their secondary structure features and their corresponding anticodons. Most have
the potential to fold into a normal cloverleaf structure,
although some do not have paired DHU arms, and a
few others have mismatched bp. The putative cloverleaf
secondary structures of unionoid tRNAs are available in
the additional files (Additional file 1, Figures S1, S2, S3,
S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8). The tRNA genes are ~60-70 bp
long and the mean GC content varies between 35.2%
and 37.4%. In the eight mt genomes, most of the tRNA
genes are located on the light strand; only trnH (Histidine) and trnD (Aspartate) are located on the heavy
strand along with most of the protein-coding genes. As
specified earlier, trnH has distinct localizations in F and
M unionoid genomes (Figure 3). For all mt genomes
(except M I. japanensis), the DHU arm of trnS1 (Serine)
is unpaired. Unpaired DHU arms are also observed for
the second Serine trnS2 (tct) and Threonine trnT in the
M genome of P. grandis, for the Arginine trnR and

Threonine trnT in the M genome of V. ellipsiformis and
for the Cysteine trnC and Threonine trnT in the M genome of Q. quadrula. DHU arm for the Lysine trnK in
the F genome of Q. quadrula is also unpaired. No
unpaired DHU arm has been observed in tRNAs of M I.
japanensis.
Unassigned regions and putative control regions

Twenty-two or thirty-three unassigned regions were
detected in the six genomes, with sizes ranging from 1
to 1196 bp. The three newly sequenced F genomes present a more compact arrangement than the three M
genomes (Table 3). We observed the opposite trend in I.
japanensis where the F genome contains more unassigned sequences (12.9% of the genome) than the M
genome (8.9% of the genome). The abundance of unassigned sequences in both F and M genomes of the four
unionoid species analyzed here is similar with the results
observed in their mytiloid F and M counterparts (~10%
of unassigned sequences) [31,34,36]. In comparison, the
veneroid clam V. philippinarum M and F genomes have
a higher proportion of unassigned sequences (i.e., >
15.8% for F and > 21.3% for M) (Okazaki M, Ueshima
R, personal communication).
Levels of intra- and interspecies sequence divergences

Table 4 contains Intra- and interspecific comparisons of
the concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences
of 12 protein-coding genes (atp8 has been excluded and
only species for which both F and M genomes are available were used) from the M- and F-transmitted mitochondrial genomes of unionoid bivalves. The smallest
nucleotide and amino acid distances are observed
between the two F genomes of the most closely-related
species, i.e. V. ellipsiformis and Q. quadrula (P of 0.207
and P(aa) of 0.157). Overall, nucleotide and amino acid
sequence divergences between all pairs of F genomes
are considerably lower than between M pairs or between
the M and F genomes of the same species. Early estimations of the nucleotide divergence between M and F
genomes of unionoid bivalves were based on p-distances
of partial cox1 sequences [20] and were around 28 to
33%. Our results show that these early estimations were

between the F and M concatenated nucleotide
sequences for the 12 mitochondrial protein-coding

Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis

The seemingly anomalous difference in branching pattern between the M and F Mytilus genomes is due to an
asymmetric introgression of M. edulis M mtDNA into
the Baltic M. trossulus [36]. Nevertheless, the ingroup (=
bivalves) topology in Figure 1 is consistent with other
sequence-based phylogenetic reconstructions in that the
Unionoida is basal to Pteriomorphia+Veneroida (e.g.,
[41,45,48]) thus reinforcing the hypothesis that the
Unionoida is a relatively ancient bivalve lineage potentially harboring the ancestral characteristics of DUI.
Although the phylogenetic hypothesis ((Pteriomorphia,
Veneroida) Unionoida) is not typically portrayed as the
best estimate of evolutionary relationships for these
lineages at this time (e.g., [53]: Figure six point height),
the statistical robustness of our phylogenetic analyses

with regards to the Bivalvia (Figure 1) indicates that it
should be seriously evaluated in future, higher level
bivalve phylogenetic studies.
The three origins of DUI for the taxa included in this
study (Figure 2A) runs counter to the prevailing hypothesis of a single origin for this complex trait with subsequent reversals to SMI [23,26-28] but it is not
unexpected given the bias toward “DUI absence” stemming from the difficulties in confirming the presence of
DUI (e.g., [20,25,26,54]). The complexity of the cytonuclear interactions involved in DUI and its very narrow
taxonomic distribution are consistent with the hypothesis that the gain of DUI is a relatively rare event with
subsequent losses being potentially more common. If a
low ratio of rate of DUI gain to rate of DUI loss actually
holds, then the use of the Dollo parsimony model
[55,56] is more appropriate than the use of the MK1
model and the former indicates a single gain of DUI
with three subsequent losses (Figure 2B). A much more
accurate understanding of the actual taxonomic distribution of DUI combined with a taxonomically expanded
version of our robustly supported bivalve phylogeny
(Figure 1) would allow a rigorous evaluation of the single vs. multiple origins of DUI hypotheses as well as the
rates of DUI gain vs. loss.

Genome structural features

Overall, the most notable differences observed between
M and F unionoid genomes are (i) the position of trnH,
(ii) an inversion of the trnD and atp8 genes, (iii) the
length of the cox2 gene (the M genomes possess a 3’
extension of cox2) as well as (iv) a noncoding region
between nd4 and nd4l in the M mtDNA genome of V.
ellipsiformis (Figure 3). The female-transmitted mtDNAs
of V. ellipsiformis, P. grandis and Q. quadrula are comparable in many respects to the F mtDNA of L. ornata,
which is unique in gene arrangement relative to all
other molluscan and metazoan mt genomes [37]. The
mitochondrial gene order rearrangement in the F genomes of I. japanensis and H. cumingii (Unionoida:
Unionidae: Ambleminae: Gonideini), i.e. the relative
positions of the nd2, trnM to nd3 genes, appear to be
unique to the Gonideini as neither L. ornata, V. ellipsiformis (Unionidae: Unionidae: Ambleminae: Lampsilini),
Q. quadrula (Unionoida: Unionidae: Ambleminae:
Quadrulini) nor P. grandis (Unionidae: Unionidae:
Unioninae: Anodontini) show this rearrangement. We
suggest that this distinct gene order in the F genomes of
I. japanensis and H. cumingii resulted from a tandem
duplication of the gene region followed by the deletion
of segments of the duplicated gene region. Losses and
gains of genes, gene rearrangements and unusually large
amounts of duplicated or noncoding nucleotides are
common in mollusk mitochondrial genomes [39,57,58].
When looking across other complete bivalve genomes,
which include species from the orders Pectinoida,
Ostreoida, Veneroida and Mytiloida (Organellar Genome Retrieval database OGRe; [59]), all genes are characteristically on the same strand (Figure 4A). Among
the Bivalvia, only in unionoids are the genes transcribed
in both directions. Robust phylogenies are necessary to
compare bivalve mt genome arrangements in an evolutionary context and our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages within the
Bivalvia and among molluscan classes is still limited and
controversial [60]. Nonetheless, based on bivalve phylogenetic analyses presented in Hoeh et al. [45], Giribet
and Distel [48], Dreyer and Steiner [41] and herein (Figure 1), the “all-on-one-strand” phenotype likely represents a shared, derived characteristic that evolved once
in the common ancestor of the Pteriomorphia and
Veneroida with the unionoid model of genes on different strands representing the ancestral state for the Bivalvia (Figure 4A).
tRNA Histidine

While the gene boundary nd3-trH on the heavy strand
observed in unionoid F genomes is not shared by any
other mollusk taxon studied so far, the gene boundary
nd5-trnH observed in the four unionoid M genomes is
also shared by nine species of cephalopods, the

Page 10 of 19

polyplacophoran Katharina tunicata and the gastropod
Haliotis rubra. This particular gene boundary could
represent the ancestral character state for the Mollusca.
The tRNA genes are the most evolutionarily mobile elements of the animal mitochondrial genome and variation in mitochondrial tRNA gene organization have
been found in multiple divergent taxa [61,62]. Rearrangement of tRNAs occurs frequently because their secondary structure facilitates their translocation [63];
alternatively, rearrangements can also result from a
duplication event [64].
Extension of the M cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene

All unionoid bivalve M genomes examined to date contain an Mcox2e region [25], which is not present in
other DUI-possessing bivalve lineages nor, apparently, in
any other animal mitochondrial genomes [43]. Structural
characterization of the MCOX2e region predicted the
presence of an interspecifically variable number of transmembrane helices [43], and immunohistochemistry- and
immunoelectronmicroscopy-based analyses revealed that
MCOX2e is expressed in sperm mitochondria [65] and
is sub-cellularly localized to both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes [16]. The latter localization, which
possibly “tags” the outer surface of unionoid M genomebearing mitochondria, could facilitate the differential
segregation of the M genome-containing mt, derived
from the fertilizing sperm, in male and female embryos
(as observed in Mytilus; [66,67]). Consistent with the
above, seasonal variation in expression profiles suggest
that unionoid MCOX2e functions in reproduction
[16,43,64].
Atp8 gene

In animal mtDNAs, the atp8 gene is the smallest protein-coding gene (≈ 50 to 65 aa) with only a few highly
conserved amino acid residues. It encodes a protein subunit of the F 0 portion of the mitochondrial ATP
synthase, which is the enzymatic complex that drives
the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The ATP synthase
comprises the F1 catalytic domain situated in the mitochondrial matrix and the F0 proton pore embedded in
the mitochondrial inner membrane. Although the specific function of ATP8 is not yet known, in yeast, it is
thought to play an important role in the assembly of the
F 0 portion of ATP synthase and in determining ATP
synthase activity (reviewed in [68]). In mammals, it is
the most rapidly evolving mitochondrial protein-coding
gene [69]. Atp8 has been lost independently from the
mt genomes of several lineages including some bivalves
[e.g., marine mussels possessing DUI [31,34,36] and
oysters [70], secernentean nematodes [71], and platyhelminths [72]. Interestingly, all other mollusk species (i.e.,
gastropods, cephalopods, polyplacophorans and scaphopods) studied to date possess an atp8 gene [2,70]. The F
and M genomes of the marine clam Venerupis

philippinarum also possess a short putative atp8 gene
(37 aa; [41]) and a potential remnant of the atp8 gene
has been found in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica [40]. These observations and the phylogeny displayed in Figure 1 reinforce the hypothesis that
unionoid mt genomes possess the molluscan ancestral
character state (= the presence of atp8) and that two
losses of atp8 in veneroids and another in the common
ancestor of the Pteriomorphia could have occurred during bivalve phylogenesis (Figure 4B). In the M genome
of P. grandis, even though we identified an open reading
frame that corresponds to a portion of atp8, the complete stop codon early in the sequence could yield a
non-functional protein. Further analysis will be necessary to confirm or refute the existence of a functional
atp8 in the M genome of this species. For now, the presence/absence of atp8 seems extremely labile across
bivalve taxa, but this phenomenon does not appear to
be related to the presence/absence of doubly uniparental
inheritance.
NADH dehydrogenase subunits 4 and 4L genes

NADH dehydrogenase subunits 4 and 4L genes generally overlap or are adjacent to one another in animal mt
genomes [57,73]. This is also the case for most unionoid
mt genomes examined in this study except for the M
genome of V. ellipsiformis where those genes are separated by a large noncoding region as well as for the F
genome of I. japanensis, where both genes are separated
by one nucleotide. We cannot exclude the possibility
that this single nucleotide in the F I. japanensis
sequence represents a sequencing error.
In vertebrates nd4 and nd4l are transcribed as one
bicistronic mRNA, and are therefore localized together
[73]. Moreover, in several mollusks (i.e., one scaphopod,
some gastropods and all 12 cephalopods studied to date
(Organellar Genome Retrieval database OGRe; [59]),
these two genes are also adjacent to one another or
overlap. However, in all other non-unionoid bivalve species studied to date (7 genera), nd4 and nd4l have several intervening coding genes (e.g., Crassostera gigas
[40] and Hiatella arctica [41]). Again, the overlap
observed between nd4-nd4l in most of the new unionoid
genomes analyzed herein and the phylogeny displayed in
Figure 1 support the hypothesis that unionoid mt genomes possess the molluscan ancestral character state
and that the derived state, “intervening genes”, occurred
once in the common ancestor of pteriomorph and
veneroid bivalves (Figure 4C).
Base composition and codon usage

Although the exact mechanisms responsible for creating
CG- and AT-skews like those observed in this study are
still poorly understood, it is most likely created by the
biases in mutational pressure owing to differences in the

Page 12 of 19

time spent as single-stranded DNA during both transcription and replication [74]). The negative CG- and
AT-skews observed in the strand that encodes most of
the proteins (i.e., cox1 - cox3 - atp6 - atp8 - nd4L - nd4
- nd5 - nd3 - cox2 (Mcox2e)) and that make it G+T rich
is reflected in the use of synonymous codons (Additional file 2, Table S1). This is particularly evident at the
third codon positions of protein-coding genes where Cand A-ending codons are used less frequently. Overall,
TTT (Phe), TTG (Leu) and TTA (Leu) are the most frequent codons, a result consistent with other invertebrate
mtDNAs [34]. Except for the stop codons TAA and
TAG, TGC, CGC and ACG are among the least used
codons. Of these, CGC is also the least common codon
in the mtDNA of other mollusks [34].
Transfer RNA genes

Interestingly, unionoid bivalves do not possess an extra
trnM, a situation that is present in both pteriomorph
and veneroid bivalves [2,31,34]. The presence of an
extra trnM within the latter two lineages could represent a character state that was (1) independently derived
multiple times, (2) derived once with multiple independent secondary losses or (3) both derived and lost multiple times independently (Figure 4D). The absence of a
second trnM in all other molluscan species studied to
date [2] reinforces the hypothesis that unionoids likely
possess the molluscan ancestral character state for this
character (Figure 4D).
Unassigned regions and putative control regions

The presence of multiple unassigned regions is not
uncommon in mollusk mitochondrial genomes [75,76]
and is usually suggestive of molecular rearrangements
[77]. The large unassigned region located between nd5
and trnQ in F genomes and between trnH and trnQ in
M genomes has been identified as a potential heavy
strand origin of replication (OH) [78]. Otherwise, F and
M unionoid mitochondrial genomes appear to contain
multiple and potentially bidirectional OL control regions
[78].
Levels of intra- and interspecies sequence divergences

It should be stressed that the measured divergences
between unionoid F and M genomes considerably surpass intra- or inter-species values reported in classical
model systems used for the study of intergenomic coevolution [9,79,80]. From a nucleo-mitochondrial evolutionary perspective, the question of how male freshwater
mussels can tolerate heteroplasmy characterized by such
variability remains to be solved.
Among species with DUI, freshwater mussels exhibit
the greatest nucleotide and amino acid divergences
between their gender-associated mtDNAs. For example,

Doucet-Beaupré et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/50

the average uncorrected nucleotide divergence observed
between the F and M concatenated sequences of the 12
mitochondrial protein-coding genes of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis is about 23% [31]. The smaller level of
divergence observed between the M and F mtDNAs in
Mytilus is likely associated with periodic “role-reversal”
or “masculinization” events, which are characterized by
an invasion of the male route of inheritance by an F-like
genome that becomes transmitted through sperm as a
standard M genome [14,27,81,82]. Specifically, the Flike, “recently-masculinized” M genome is only significantly different from a standard Mytilus F genome in
that it possesses a so-called “standard M genome control region” and, as it’s name implies, it is paternally
transmitted (see [31] and [83] for details). Therefore,
such masculinization events reset to zero the level of
mitochondrial gene sequence divergence between the M
and F genomes. Complete absence of masculinization
events, for over 200 million years, can explain the considerably greater divergences between unionoid M and F
mtDNAs [22,25,42]. It has been proposed that the
unionoid M-specific extension of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene represents such specialization of
the unionoid M genome that recombination (i.e. the
addition of an M type genome’s control region to an F
genome) leading to role reversals are no longer possible
in this taxon [83].
According to our results, ~50% amino acid divergence
between unionoid F and M genomes can be tolerated
by a species’ nuclear environment without any major
disruption of cytonuclear co-adaptation or impairment
of mitochondrial function. This level of divergence
could hardly be explained only by relaxation of selective
pressure induced by a loss of metabolic function of M
mtDNA since two recent studies have clearly shown the
importance of M mtDNA gene products on sperm performance in Mytilus edulis [84,85]. Further characterization of the conserved versus radical amino acid
changes in evolutionarily conserved or non-conserved
positions of mitochondrial proteins will help to delineate the levels/types of divergence in mtDNA encoded
peptides that can be tolerated by a species’ nuclear
genome.

Conclusions
The basal position of the Unionoida within the autolamellibranch bivalves (Figure 1) and the hypothesized
single origin of DUI (Figure 2B; [23,26-28]) suggest that
(1) DUI arose in the ancestral autolamellibranch bivalve
lineage and was subsequently lost in multiple descendant lineages and (2) the DUI characteristics observed
in unionoid bivalves could more closely resemble the
DUI ancestral condition. We described the general features of eight mt genomes from unionoid bivalve species

Page 13 of 19

with the doubly uniparental mode of mitochondrial
inheritance and highlighted several unusual characteristics of the M genomes, compared to their female-transmitted counterparts, e.g., the presence of Mcox2e and a
novel localization of trnH. Based on the concatenated
nucleotide sequences of 12 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, we determined an uncorrected amino acid pdistance between the M and F genomes of ~50%. From
a nucleo-mitochondrial functional perspective, the question of how male freshwater mussels can tolerate heteroplasmy characterized by such variability remains to
be solved as does the function(s) of DUI. Finally, the
presence of the Mcox2e is one important feature that
distinguishes markedly, but not solely, the unionoid M
from the F genomes, but also the unionoid M from all
other DUI-possessing bivalves as well as all other
metazoan mtDNAs. This suggests that it could have
been a facilitator of the transition from SMI to DUI in
the ancestral autolamellibranch (assuming a single origin
of DUI) or ancestral unionoid (assuming multiple origins of DUI) lineage. If the former hypothesis is corroborated, Mcox2e was subsequently lost from the M
genome in the ancestor of the Pteriomorphia+Veneroida. Irrespective of a single vs. multiple origins of DUI,
the ancestral character state reconstructions in Figure 4
imply that significant mt genomic reorganization
occurred in the Bivalvia subsequent to the divergence of
the unionoid lineage. Studying additional complete
bivalve mt genomes will give us the best hope of unraveling the origin(s) and function(s) of DUI as well as the
origins and consequences of the unique mt genomic
variation in the Bivalvia.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from one male and
one female Venustaconcha ellipsiformis from Gladwin
County, Michigan (USA), one male and one female
Pyganodon grandis from the northern Radisson region
of Québec (Canada) (48°18’24"N, 68°29’34"W) and one
male and one female Quadrula quadrula from the
White River, Indiana (USA). Microscopic examination
of gonadal tissues was performed to determine mussel
gender based on the presence of eggs or sperm/sperm
morulae. Total genomic DNA extractions were performed on the tissues (gonadal tissue for the male and
the female P. grandis and gonadal tissue for the males
and mantle tissue for the females V. ellipsiformis and Q.
quadrula) using a QIAGEN DNA Extraction Kit
(QIAGEN Inc., Mississauga, Canada) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, each mitochondrial genome was amplified by long-PCR from the
genomic DNA in two large overlapping regions using
the F-specific primer FCOIIhFor (5’-GCCTTATG
GGGTTGAT AGGCGAGTTCTTGTGAGG-3’) with the

Doucet-Beaupré et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/50

amblemine-specific primer Ambl16SFor (5’-CTGGG
TTTGCGACCTCGATGTTGGCTTAGGGAAA-3’), and
the F-specific primer FCOI195R (5’-GCATAACAATTTC ACACAGGCCAATCATYATWGGYATNACCA-3’) with the amblemine-specific Ambl16SRev
(5’-TTTCCCTAAGCCAACATCGAGGTCGCAAACCC
AG-3’) for the F genomes of V. ellipsiformis and Q.
quadrula, and the M-specific primer MCOIIh63F (5’CACGACGTTGTAAAACGACTTTATRCCTRTKTGT
GTRGARGCTGT-3’) with Ambl16SFor, and the M-specific MCOI19R (5’-GGATAACAATTTCACGGGTCC
CAATATCYTTATGRTTAGT-3’) with Ambl16SRev for
the M genomes of V. ellipsiformis and Q. quadrula.
Both the F and M genomes of these species resulted in
two fragments of ~11 kb and ~5.5 kb, respectively. The
F genome of P. grandis was also amplified in two large
overlapping regions using the F-specific primer 5’FCOIPygR (5’-TGCCARTAACAARTAYAAAGTA-3’) with
ND1R (5-GCTATTAGTAGGTCGTATCG-3; [39,86])
and the F-specific primer UNIOND3 (5’-AGHSCKTTT
GARTGYGGKTTTGA-3’) with ND1F (5-TGGCA
GAAAAGTGCATCAGATTTAAGC-3; [39,87]). We
obtained two fragments of ~11 kb and ~7 kb, respectively. The M genome of P. grandis was amplified
with PygMcox2eF (5’-TTGAAGCAGTTAGAGTTG
AGGT-3’) in combination with 16Sar-L2 (5’-CGCC
TGTTTAY CAAAAACAT-3’; modified from [88]) and
PygMcox2eR (5’-TAYAATCTTYCAATRTCYTTATGA
TT-3’) combined with 16Sbr-H2 (5’-CCGGTCTGA
ACTCAGATCRYGT-3’; modified from [88]). PygMcox2eF and PygMcox2eR were specifically designed to
amplify the M genome. The resulting fragments were
about ~12 kb and ~5.5 kb.
Long-PCR amplifications were performed in 50 μl
reaction volumes using the QIAGEN LongRange PCR
Kit in similar conditions to the manufacturers’ suggestions: 1× LongRange PCR Buffer with 2.5 mM of Mg2+,
500 μM of each dNTP, 0.4 μM each primer, 2 U of
LongRange PCR Enzyme Mix and ~25 ng of template
DNA. For the M and the F genomes of V. ellipsiformis
and Q. quadrula, reactions were cycled at 85°C for 60 s,
93°C for 60 s, and 37 cycles of 93°C for 15 s, 53°C
for 30 s and 68°C for 6 min for the short fragment or
11 min for the longest one. Thermal cycling conditions
for the M and F genomes of P. grandis were as follows:
93°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 93°C for 15 s,
46-54°C for 30 s and 68°C for 7-12 min and a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. Each amplicon appeared
as one abundant band of the appropriate size on an
agarose gel. The resulting PCR products were gel purified using QIAGEN QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Following DNA quantification for each amplicon, the two
amplicons (~5 μg from each) for each genome were
pooled and then processed for direct sequencing in a

Page 14 of 19

single reaction by the 454 Life Sciences Massively Parallel Pyrosequencing Platform (whole genome sequencing
protocol) of the McGill University and Genome Quebec
Innovation Center.
For the M and the F genomes of V. ellipsiformis,
amplifications were pooled and a total of 10,413 reads
were produced to provide at least 45× coverage of the
complete mitochondrial genomes. The sequences were
then assembled into a single contig of 15,975 base pairs
(bp) for the F genome and 17,174 bp for the M genome.
For the M and the F genomes of Q. quadrula, amplifications were pooled and a total of 11,978 reads were produced to provide at least 66× coverage of the complete
mitochondrial genomes. The sequences were assembled
into a single contig of 16,033 bp for the F genome and
16,970 bp for the M genome. For the P. grandis F genome, draft assemblies were based on 14,794 total reads.
The initial assembly of the 454 pyrosequencing data
into two predominant contigs (~6.7 kb) and a small one
(834 bp) was provided by 454 Life Sciences (Branford,
CT, USA), and corresponded to a mitochondrial genome coverage of 115× and 437× respectively. The final
assembly in one large contig of 15,848 bp was performed using SeqMan (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI,
USA). The complete M genome of P. grandis was generated from assembly of 7,652 successful sequence reads
into a single contig of 17,071 bp which corresponded to
an overall mitochondrial genome coverage of > 100×.
The complete sequences of the F and M mitochondrial genomes for Venustaconcha ellipsiformis, Pyganodon grandis and Quadrula quadrula can be accessed
under the GenBank accession numbers FJ809753,
FJ809752, FJ809754, FJ809755, FJ809750, and FJ809751,
respectively.
Gene annotation and analysis

The complete F and M mitochondrial genomes for each
species were initially analyzed with the NCBI Open
Reading Frame Finder using the invertebrate mitochondrial code. Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes
were annotated using DOGMA [88] and then aligned
with the mtDNA genes annotated in GenBank using
ClustalW [89]. The 5’ and 3’ ends of both rrnL and rrnS
genes were assumed to be adjacent to the ends of bordering tRNA genes. Mitochondrial tRNA genes were
identified and confirmed using a combination of programs: tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [90] with a COVE cutoff
score of 0.1, DOGMA [89] and ARWEN [91]. Mitochondrial gene order comparisons were facilitated by
the use of the OGRe web site at http://drake.physics.
mcmaster.ca/ogre/index.shtml[59].
Basic sequence statistics and evolutionary distances
among genes were performed using MEGA version 4.0
[92] and DnaSP version 4.0 [93]. To estimate

Doucet-Beaupré et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/50

evolutionary distance between pairwise comparisons, the
following parameters were used: uncorrected nucleotide
divergence (Pi = uncorrected nucleotide diversity),
nucleotide divergence using the Jukes-Cantor (JC),
Kimura two-parameter (K2P), and Tamura and Nei
(TrN) models of nucleotide substitution. Estimated parameters also included total amino acid differences (Na),
uncorrected amino acid distances (p(aa)), poisson-corrected amino acid distances (D), number of synonymous
substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and number of
nonsynonymous substitution per nonsynonymous site
(Ka) [94]. The Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple substitutions was applied. Strand asymmetry was measured
using the formulas AT-skew = (A - T)/(A + T) and CGskew = (C - G)/(C + G) [51,95] and calculated with
MEGA 4.0 [92] at fourfold redundant sites for each
mitochondrial protein-coding gene.
Phylogenetic trees for the Bivalvia, using Bayesian
inference (BI), maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum
parsimony (MP), were constructed using concatenated
nucleotide and amino acid sequences from 12 proteincoding genes (we excluded atp8 due to alignment issues
and its apparent absence in multiple bivalve species).
We used both Clustal W [96] and Dialign version 2.2.1
[97] for the alignments, with subsequent manual adjustments, and the amino acid alignment was used as a
template to align the corresponding codons. Amino
acids from 29 complete bivalve mitochondrial genomes
and those from five outgroup species (gastropod Aplysia
californica [NC_005827], cephalopod Octopus vulgaris
[NC_006353],
scaphopod
Graptacme
eborea
[NC_006162], polyplacophoran, Katharina tunicata
[NC_001636], polychaete Platynereis dumerii
[NC_000931]) were aligned using Clustal W in MEGA
4.0 and manually reviewed (Table 1). Regions of ambiguous alignment were excluded prior to the phylogenetic
analyses. The analyzed matrices had either 7,704 nucleotide positions or 2,568 amino acid positions and these
files are available from the authors.
The codon- and amino acid-based BI analyses were
conducted with Mr. Bayes (v. 3.1.2; [98,99]). The codonbased analysis invoked the M3 model [100] with two
simultaneous runs of 5 million generations each (a total
of 50,000 saved trees/run). The amino acid-based BI
analysis invoked the variable rate “glorified GTR model”
(see the MrBayes manual;[101]) with two simultaneous
runs of 2.9 million generations each (a total of 29,000
saved trees/run). Both sets of BI analyses reached convergence (average standard deviation of the split frequencies was <0.01) and the burnin for each set was
determined by reference to the log probability of observing the data × generation plot (codon-based BI run
burnin = 4 million generations [= the last 10,000 trees/
run saved contributed to the majority-rule tree], amino

Page 15 of 19

acid-based BI run burnin = 1.9 million generations [=
the last 10,000 trees/run saved contributed to the majority-rule tree]).
Codon and amino acid-based ML analyses were conducted with Garli (v. 0.96;[102]). The M3 model was
used in the codon-based ML analysis which was set to
use the observed nucleotide frequencies at each codon
position separately. A non-parametric bootstrap [103]
analysis was performed, using 300 replicates, to assess
nodal support for the codon analysis-based trees. The
program ProtTest http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/prottest.html was used to evaluate the best amino acid
model for our data from those models available in Garli.
Both the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian
information criterion selected the WAG+F model [104]
as the best available model which was therefore used in
the ML amino acid analysis. A non-parametric bootstrap
was performed, using 600 replicates, to assess nodal
support for the a.a. analysis-based trees.
Maximum parsimony analyses were conducted with
PAUP* [105]. The nucleotide-based MP analysis utilized
equally weighted transversion parsimony (= only purines
vs. pyrimidines were coded) and 1000 random addition
runs for estimating the most parsimonious tree. A nonparametric bootstrap transversion parsimony analysis
was run (with 1000 replicates) using 10 random addition
runs per replicate. The amino acid-based MP analysis
was carried out with equal weighting and 1000 random
addition runs were used to estimate the most parsimonious tree. Lastly, an equally weighted parsimony, nonparametric, bootstrap analysis was run on the a.a. matrix
(with 1000 replicates) using 10 random addition runs
per replicate.
The estimation of ancestral mitogenomic character
states and the presence/absence of DUI, based on the
majority-rule codon-based BI tree, was carried out using
the ML algorithm in Mesquite (v.2.6; [106]). An estimation of ancestral character states for the presence/
absence of DUI, using the best codon-based BI tree and
Dollo parsimony, was done with MacClade (v.4.07;
[107]). The asymmetry likelihood ratio test was used to
determine whether the AsymmMK model was significantly better than the MK1 model (see the Mesquite
manual). The MK1 model was used in all likelihood
reconstructions because in all cases, the AsymmMK
model was not a significantly better model, therefore we
used the simpler model (the MK1 model has one less
parameter). The use of a likelihood ratio test to calculate
P-values for ancestral states is not possible because
hypotheses regarding the likelihoods of each possible
state at a given node are non-nested. Therefore, to
make decisions regarding the significance of ancestral
character states Pagel ([108] following [109]), recommended that ancestral character state estimates with a

Doucet-Beaupré et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:50
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/50

log likelihood two or more units lower than the best
state estimate (decision threshold [T] set to T = 2) be
rejected. Generally viewed as a conservative cutoff, this
threshold has been used by numerous recent authors (e.
g., [110-112]). For the data presented herein, this protocol ensures that all of the character states judged to be
significant have proportional likelihoods at least 10
times greater than that of any other state.
