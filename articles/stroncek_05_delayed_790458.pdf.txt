Interferonmacrophagesautoimmunity

Abstract
Background: Interferon (IFN)-α is considered a key modulator of immunopathological processes through a
signature-specific activation of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs). This study utilized global transcript analysis to
characterize the effects of the entire type I IFN family in comparison to a broad panel of other cytokines on MP
previously exposed to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro.
Results: Immature peripheral blood CD14+ MPs were stimulated with LPS and 1 hour later with 42 separate
soluble factors including cytokines, chemokines, interleukins, growth factors and IFNs. Gene expression profiling
of MPs was analyzed 4 and 9 hours after cytokine stimulation. Four hours after stimulation, the transcriptional
analysis of MPs revealed two main classes of cytokines: one associated with the alternative and the other with the
classical pathway of MP activation without a clear polarization of type I IFNs effects. In contrast, after 9 hours of
stimulation most type I IFN isoforms induced a characteristic and unique transcriptional pattern separate from
other cytokines. These "signature" IFNs included; IFN-β, IFN-α2b/α2, IFN-αI, IFN-α2, IFN-αC, IFN-αJ1, IFNαH2, and INF-α4B and induced the over-expression of 44 genes, all of which had known functional relationships
with IFN such as myxovirus resistance (Mx)-1, Mx-2, and interferon-induced hepatitis C-associated microtubular
aggregation protein. A second group of type I IFNs segregated separately and in closer association with the type
II IFN-γ. The phylogenetic relationship of amino acid sequences among type I IFNs did not explain their subclassification, although differences at positions 94 through 109 and 175 through 189 were present between the
signature and other IFNs.
Conclusion: Seven IFN-α isoforms and IFN-β participate in the late phase polarization of MPs conditioned by
LPS. This information broadens the previous view of the central role played by IFN-α in autoimmunity and tumor
rejection by including and/or excluding an array of related factors likely to be heterogeneously expressed by
distinct sub-populations of individuals in sickness or in response to biological therapy.

Background
It has been proposed recently that autoimmunity or, more
generally, immunity is driven by a dynamic system balancing opposite vectors represented by type one interferons (IFNs) in one direction and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) in the other [1]. This dichotomy is mediated
through divergent activation of mononuclear phagocytes
(MPs) by the two cytokine families resulting in specific
signatures of gene expression that are characteristic of distinct autoimmune pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, IFN-α/β) or rheumatoid arthritis (TNF)
[1-3].
Interestingly, although type I IFN signatures are consistently observed in patients with SLE, only a fraction of
them demonstrate elevated IFN serum protein levels [2].
Therefore, it is possible that testing methods may not
detect all the IFN species that might circulate in the blood
and which may yield similar biological effects. For this
reason, we evaluated the effect of a panel of related type I
IFN molecules in modulating the transcriptional profile
of MPs exposed to lipopolysacaride (LPS) according to a
previously described experimental model [4]. The molecular signatures of type I IFNs were compared with those of
IFN-γ, TNF-α and TNF-β as well as a comprehensive panel
of other cytokines to characterize the specificity of IFN
polarization of MPs in the context of an extended cytokine
network.
Indeed, MPs play a critical role in acute and chronic
inflammation performing diverse functions in different
stages of activation. MPs recruit and activate immune
effector cells or they may down-regulate the inflammatory
process to contain collateral damage [5]. Pro-inflammatory MPs, known as type 1 or M1 MPs, function as true
antigen presenting cells that recruit and activate immune
effector cells [6,7]. MP that enhance tissue repair, stimulate angiogenesis, and contain collateral damage through
reduced inflammation are known as type 2, or M2 MPs
[8,9]. Type 2 mononuclear phagocytes can be further categorized as M2 a, b, c [10] suggesting a continuous spectrum of MP activation.
Many factors may influence the differentiation of immature MPs toward a polarized M1 or M2 phenotype along
the classical or the alternative pathway of transcriptional
activation [9]. Theoretically, the in vivo functional phenotype of MPs along each of these pathways is dependent on
the environment, since foreign products (microbial products) and endogenous cytokines modulate their activation
and maturation [11]. MPs are capable of tailoring their
response to specific microbes and microbial products as
demonstrated by the display of a distinct gene expression
profile upon stimulation with different pathogen products [11]. The effects of different cytokines and other bio-

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/3/1/24

active soluble factors on MPs are also variable.
Stimulation of MPs with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) alone or
with lipopolysacaride (LPS) plus IFN-γ, CD40L, and Flt-3
ligand (FLT3-L) yields M1 MPs. Treatment of MPs with IL4 and IL-13 induces a M2 MP phentotype.
Changes in MPs following microbial stimulation do not
occur as a single event over a brief period of time but in
waves each lasting several hours. A comparison of MPs
stimulated with 3 different microbes, E. coli, C. albicans
and influenza found that gene expression was most rapidly induced by E. coli and most slowly by influenza. The
gene expression profiles induced by these three microbes
continued to change for more than 24 hours [11].
We have found that cytokines have a marked affect on
LPS-stimulated MPs [7]. Immature CD14+ peripheral
blood MPs were stimulated with LPS and one hour later
they were treated separately with 42 different cytokines.
After 4 hours, the MPs were analyzed by gene expression
profiling using a 17 K cDNA chip. LPS-stimulation alone
induced a gene expression profile typical of the classical
pathway of MP activation, but which was markedly
altered by additional cytokine stimulation. Hierarchical
clustering of gene expression profiles of LPS-stimulated
MPs treated with 42 factors for four hours revealed two
main groups of cytokines. One group included IL-4, IL-13,
TGF-α, TGF-β, and VEGF and represented the alternative
pathway of MP activation. A second group included IFNβ, IFN-γ, CD40L, and FLT-3L generally associated with the
classical pathway. Some cytokines such as IL-10, IL-1β, IL15, IFN-αA and IFN-α2b did not separate into either of
the two classes [4].
Interestingly, 4 hours after cytokine exposure, type I IFNs
did not display similarities in MP transcriptional activation among themselves. Instead, the various IFN family
members were scattered among the different cytokine sub
classifications. This finding suggested that IFN polarization of MP activation following LPS exposure is a delayed
event. In this study, therefore, we present the gene profiling of LPS-conditioned MPs 9 hours after exposure to 42
different cytokines as previously reported for the 4 hour
time point [4]. Prolonged exposure (9 hours) to these bioactive factors revealed a unique polarization of MP maturation induced by most (but not all) members of the type
I IFN family and singled out this group of factors for its
ability to induce a distinctive MP gene expression profile.

Materials and methods
MP separation and FACS staining
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from an
HLA-A*0201 positive healthy Caucasian male donor age
35 were collected by lymph apheresis at the Department
of Transfusion Medicine, NIH. PBMC were isolated by

Ficoll gradient separation and frozen until analysis. After
thawing, PBMC were kept overnight in 175 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in complete medium
(CM) consisting of Iscove's medium (Biofluids, Rockville,
MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human
AB-serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Inc, Calabasas, CA), 10
mM hepes buffer (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc. Herndon, VA),
0.03% L-glutamine (Biofluids), 100 U/ml Penicillin/
Streptomycin (Biofluids), 10 µg/ml Ciprofloxacin (Bayer,
West Haven, CT), and 0.5 mg/ml amphotericin B (Biofluids). Adherent and non-adherent cells were gently
removed from the flask and centrifugated. MP were separated by negative selection using the MP isolation kit and
an autoMACS system (both Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). Before and after separation cells were stained
with anti-CD14-FITC (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA),
and analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer and
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Stimulation of MP, RNA isolation
Negatively selected CD14+ cells were washed twice with
serum free OPTI-MEM (OM) medium (GIBCO BRL) prepared similarly to CM. The final cell population which
contained > 90% CD14+ cells was then seeded at the concentration of 1 × 106 / ml in 10 ml OM in 25 cm2 flasks
(Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and stimulated with 5 µg/ml
LPS (SIGMA St. Louis, MO) for one hour. No LPS was
added to the non-stimulation control flask. After one
hour, 42 cytokines, chemokines and soluble factors were
added individually to the MP suspensions (IL-1α, IFN-αC,
IFN-αJ1, IL-13, IFN-α4B, MIP-1β, IFN-αG, IL-12, IL-5, IL4, VEGF, TGFβ, IL-8, IFN-α1, MIP-4 (Parc), Rantes, IFNαWA, TGFα, IFN-γ, IFN-α2, BCA-1, IFN-αF2, IL-2, Flt-3

LPS stimulation, MP were harvested, washed twice in PBS,
and lysed for RNA isolation using 700 µl RNeasy lysis
buffer per 25 cm2 flask, according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
Probe preparation, amplification, and hybridization to
microarrays
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy minikits (Qiagen).
Amplified antisense RNA (aRNA) was prepared from total
RNA (0.5–3 µg) according the protocol previously
described by us [12,13]. Test samples were labeled with
Cy5-dUTP (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) while the reference sample (pooled normal donor PBMC) was labeled
with Cy3-dUTP. Test-reference sample pairs were mixed
and co-hybridized to 17 K-cDNA microarrays.

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/3/1/24

Microarrays and statistical analyses
Hybridized arrays were scanned at 10-µm resolution on a
GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City,
CA) at variable PMT voltage to obtain maximal signal
intensities with < 1% probe saturation. Resulting tiff
images were analyzed via ArraySuite software (National
Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD). Data
were further analyzed using Cluster and Tree View software [14] and Partek Pro software (Partek Inc., St Charles,
MO). The global gene expression profiling of 9 hour
treated and untreated MP consisted of 49 experimental
samples. Subsequent low stringency filtering (80% gene
presence across all experiments and removal of genes that
did not have at least in 1 of the samples a Log2 = 2; 4 ratio)
selected 2,063 genes for further analysis. Clustering of
experimental samples according to Eisen et al. was based
on these genes. Gene ratios were average corrected across
experimental samples and displayed according to the central method for display using a normalization factor as
recommended by Ross [15].

Results
Genes differentially expressed 9 hours after LPS and
Cytokine Stimulation
We have previously shown that the transcriptional profile
of MPs stimulated by LPS and subjected for 4 hours to distinct cytokine stimulation can be polarized into two
major subgroups and an third intermediate subgroup
according to the type of cytokine used in culture [4]. IFNγ stimulation induced transcriptional changes that are
consistent with its pro-inflammatory activity and with the
type I pathway of MP activation [10]. After 4 hours type I
IFNs demonstrated a variety of individual transcriptional
profiles and no type I IFN-specific signatures could be
identified. On the contrary, in the present analysis, we
observed that 9 hours after stimulation a number of type
I IFNs congregated within a single cluster that was characterized by molecular signatures unique to these cytokines
and was responsible for a unique MP polarization
response. This pattern of IFN-induced polarization was
identified as follows: unsupervised hierarchical clustering
analysis was applied to the global data set of MPs treated
separately with 42 cytokines for 9 hours after LPS stimulation. The data set was filtered to sort genes that were
expressed in at least 80% of samples and whose expression was increased 3 or more fold in at least one sample.
Filtering yielded 2,063 genes that would be most informative among the 17 K gene pool.

Cytokine treatments segregated into five groups (Figure
1). One group included cytokines best classified as those
that act through the classical pathway of MP activation
such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, and CD40L
(Red bar, Figure 1). These cytokines were similarly classified in our previous analysis at the 4 hour time point [4].

LPS stimulation, was hybridized to custom made 17 k cDNA arrays. Unsupervised Eisen [20] clustering was applied to the
complete, unfiltered data set of 98 experiments. A375 is a melanoma cell line that was used for quality control alternating conventional (Cy5, red) or reciprocal (Cy3, green) labeling every 25 experiments as previously described [18]. A total of 2063
genes were analyzed. These genes were obtained by filtering the 16,000 genes and analyzing only those present in greater than
80% of samples and with at least one observation greater than 2 logs. The expression of each gene was average corrected
among the cytokines.

* Interferon γ only

Since most though not all the cytokines in this group are
recognized to act through the classical pathway of MP activation, this group was referred to as the "classical-like"
group. Interestingly, this group included not only the type
II IFN-γ but other type I IFNs such as IFN-αK and IFNαWA. This observation suggested that these type I IFNs
have similarities in the transcriptional activation of MPs
with type II IFNs. Another cluster included cytokines that
are characteristically included in the alternative pathway
of MP activation such as IL-13, VEGF and TGF-α and it
was referred to as the "alternative-like" group 1 (Black
bar, Figure 1). On visual inspection this group displays a
transcriptional profile opposite to the classical group. This
group also included type I IFNs such as IFN-αB2 and IFNαF or IFN-α21). A third group contained several cytokines
that also activate MPs via the alternative pathway including IL-4, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β and was referred to as alternative-like group 2(Green bar, Figure 1). This group was
most distant in transcriptional profile from all other
groups and was separated from them by the transcriptional profile of MPs stimulated with oligonucleotides
containing a unmethylated deoxycytosine-deoxyguanosine (CpG) motifs mixture (CpG mix type K) (Grey bar,
Figure 1) or had not been exposed to any soluble factors
and, therefore, was representative of the transcriptional
profile of MPs in culture. Thus, this group most likely represented the most divergent example of alternative MP
activation 9 hours after stimulation. However, even on
visual inspection, the alternative-like group 2 displays a
transcriptional pattern similar to the alternative-like
group 1 with most genes co-coordinately expressed
between them (Figure 1).
A fourth cluster included a variety of cytokines whose
effect on MPs could not be precisely categorized. However, on visual inspection this group approximated the
classical-like group. This group comprised IL-5, IL-10, IL12 and TGF-β and was called "classical-like group 2"The
fifth and most relevant to this study was a cluster we called
"signature IFNs", that included only type I IFNs such as:
IFN-β, IFN-α2 b /α2, IFN-αI, IFN-α2, IFN-αC, IFN-αJ1,
IFN-αH2, and IFN-α4B. This grouping of type I IFN
strongly suggested an IFN-specific pathway of MP polari-

zation in the late phase of their transcriptional response to
LPS.
Overall, 15 IFNs were tested, 13 IFN-α's, IFN-β and IFN-γ.
The IFNs not included among the eight present in the fifth
cluster included IFN-γ and IFN-αA, IFN-αG, IFN-αK, IFNαWA, IFN-αF, IFN-αB2. IFN-αF and IFN-αB2 clustered
with the Alternative-like group 1 group, while IFN-αA and
IFN-αG with the Alternative-like group 2. IFN-αK, IFNαWA, and IFN-γ clustered with the classical cytokines.
Interestingly, the global transcript profile of the 8 type I
signature IFNs was opposite for a large number of genes to
that of classical-like cytokines which included TNF-α suggesting that, indeed, type I IFNs represent a distinct biological vector of MP maturation.
Two functional signatures appeared to be particularly
restricted to signature IFNs. These two signatures included
52 cDNA clones representing 51 genes. In one signature
19 clones represented 18 genes and in the other and 33
clones represented 33 genes. Forty four of the 51 signature
genes were unique. Duplicate copies of 7 genes were
among 51 genes. These 44 genes characterized the unique
transcriptional profile of type I IFN polarized MPs (Figure
2). All 44 signature genes were previously known to be
associated with IFN function [16-49] (Table 1). Among
them were included myxovirus resistance (Mx)-1, Mx-2,
interferon-induced hepatitis C-associated microtubular
aggregation protein, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1
(OAS1), OAS2, and OAS3, vipirin (CIG5), IFN regulatory
factor 7 (IRF-7), and lymphocyte antigen 6 complex
(LY6E), Interferon stimulated gene (ISG20), Interferon
responsive protein (IFRG28), Interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (I-8D) (IFITM3), Interferon induced
protein with tetratricopeptide 1 (IFIT1), Interferon
induced protein with tetratricopeptide 2 (IFIT2), Interferon-alpha inducible protein (GIP2), Interferon-alpha
inducible protein (GIP3), Protein kinase, interferoninducible double stranded RNA activated protein kinase
(PRKR), and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Seven of these genes were duplicated in
the array, nuclear body protein (SP110), OAS1, OAS3,
ISG20, ubiquitin conjugated enzyme E2L6 (UBE2LB),
PA28 proteasome subunit (PSME2), and IFIT2, and both

The genes overexpressed by LPS-stimulated MPs treated by 8 type I IFNs
The genes overexpressed by LPS-stimulated MPs treated by 8 type I IFNs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was
applied to LPS-stimulated CD14+ MP treated for 9 hours with 42 individual cytokines. FN-β and seven αFNs were clustered
into a separate group, the signature IFNs. These IFNs were characterized by the marked overexpression of two groups of
genes shown. The genes were overexpressed by the eight IFNs and were identified by visual inspection. The analysis was preformed on the same 2063 genes used in figure 1.

copies of the seven genes were among the 52 cDNA
clones. It is important to note that the non-signature IFNs
demonstrated nearly identical expression of these genes
while none of the other cytokine studied expressed them;
underlining the selectivity of this expression pattern to
type I IFNs with some overlap with IFN-γ.
Specificity of type I IFN signatures
To determine whether the MP genes included in the IFNspecific signatures were specifically differentially
expressed by all IFNs compared with other cytokines, we
regrouped the various cytokine treatments according to

hierarchical clustering analysis based on only the 44 signature genes (Figure 3). Indeed, the expression of all of
the signature genes was shared by all type I IFNs and was
partially shared by IFN-γ, which clustered in between type
I IFNs and the other cytokines. The signature IFNs
remained in a single group, but this group also included
IFN-αA and IFN-αK. Thus, the differences in the transcriptional profile of MPs treated by distinct types of type I
IFNs were not due to different activation of IFN-specific
genes but rather by additional effects that distinct IFNs
have on MP activation

Clustering of all 15 IFNs among the 54 genes overexpressed by LPS-stimulated MP treated with the eight signature IFNs
Figure 3
Clustering of all 15 IFNs among the 54 genes overexpressed by LPS-stimulated MP treated with the eight signature IFNs. Hierarchical clustering was applied to LPS-stimulated CD14+ MP treated for 9 hours with 42 individual
cytokines. The analysis was limited to the 52 genes overexpressed by signature IFNs.

To determine the genes responsible for the differentiation
between signature and non-signature IFNs, we identified
genes statistically differentially expressed between the two
groups. The expression of 83 genes differed significantly
between the signature and non-signature IFNs (unpaired t
test p2-value < 0.05) (Figure 4). The signature IFNs
remained in a single group, but this group also included
IFN-αWA and IFN-αK. The expression of a specific set of
genes in the node spanning from the CD164 antigen to
protein-kinase, interferon-inducible repressor (PRKRIR)
resulted in the grouping of IFN-αWA and IFN-αK with the
signature IFNs.

By using a data base for annotation visualization and integrated
discovery
http://david.niaid.nih.gov/david/
upload.asp, genes differentially expressed between signature-and non-signature-IFNs were categorized according
to specific cellular and molecular functions. Sixteen functional groups each containing at least 3 representative
genes belonging to a particular biological process were
selected: 1) Metabolism/protein metabolism; 2) Catalytic
activity/ hydrolase activity; 3) Cell proliferation; 4) Cell
growth and maintanance; 5) Cell cycle; 6) Regulation of
transcription; 7) Nuclear binding; 8) Nucleobase/ nucleoside and nucleic acid metabolism; 9) Signal transducer
activity; 10) Immune response/defence; 11) Cell
adhesion; 12) Development; 13) biosynthesis/regulation

nature IFNs clustering of genes differently expressed among LPS-stimulated MPs treated with the signature IFNs and non-sigSelection
Selection and clustering of genes differently expressed among LPS-stimulated MPs treated with the signature
IFNs and non-signature IFNs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied to LPS-stimulated CD14+ MP treated for 9
hours with the IFNs. The analysis was restricted to genes that were differentially expressed between the signature and non-signature INFs (p < 0.05), but the 52 genes markedly overexpressed by LPS-stimulated MPs treated with the signature IFNs were
excluded from the analysis. The signature IFNs are shown in blue and the non-signature IFNs are shown in red.

Genes in blue rectangles are up-regulated in MP stimulated by "signature IFNs" (and down-regulated in non-signature interferons). Genes in orange
rectangles are up-regulated in MP stimulated by non-signature IFN (and downregulated in signature interferons). Genes belonging to more than one
functional group may represent central and shared switches in pathways directly influenced by IFNs' activity. Genes in torqoise characters did not
classify in any of the categories mined by DAVID software (PSMA3, NKTR, NKG7, CD63, EEF2) and were manually entered in the appropriate
group on the basis of Entrez cross database annotation and Genecard http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez; http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/

of translation; 14) Cytoskeleton 15) Transport 16) Cell
death (Table 2, also refer to this table for details on gene
name abbreviations and single gene function).
Signature IFNs upregulated all the genes classified in 7 out
of 16 categories: 5) Cell cycle, 6) Regulation of transcription, 7) Nuclear binding, 8) Nucleobase/ nucleoside and
nucleic acid metabolism, 9 Signal transducer activity
(except for one gene), 14) Cytoskeleton, and 15) Transport. These results indicate that not only are signature
IFNs capable of affecting simultaneously a variety of vital
cellular functions in MPs but these IFNs are powerful
inducer of gene transcription and key regulators of cellular
responses to diverse types of stimuli.
Both the signature and non-signature IFNs upregulated
MP genes in 7 categories 1) Metabolism/protein metabolism; 2) Catalytic activity/hydrolase activity 3) Cell proliferation, 4) Cell growth and maintenance 10) Immune
response/defense, 11) Cell adhesion, and 13) Biosynthesis/regulation of translation. Twenty four genes were classified into the 1) Metabolism/protein metabolism, the
functional category that contained the greatest number of
genes. The large majority of metabolic genes belonged to
vital pathways of cell survival. Activation of metabolic
genes by the signature and non-signature IFNs affected
distinct and yet equally important groups of genes.
Seventeen metabolic genes were upregulated by signature-

IFNs and these 17 genes affected major metabolic pathways such as MAP/ERK/MAPKK pathway (ZAK), glycolysis/glucose
metabolism
(GAPD),
NADPH
dehydrogenase/ oxidoreductase activity (NQO1), ubiquitin dependent protein catabolism/ proteasome
endopeptidase activity (PSMA7, PSMA3), lipid metabolism (FABP5), endocytic machinery of cell trafficking
(CD63) and nuclear DNA binding related to cell differentiation and proliferation (TAL1, DIS155E). Seven out of
24 metabolic genes were upregulated by non-signatureIFNs and were primarily related to enzymatic activities in
protein biosynthesis (LAMR1), proteolysis and peptidolysis (MALT1), lipid catabolism(LIPA) and cytolysis (LYZ).
The functional categories 10) Immune genes and 11) Cell
adhesion are of particular significance because they may
be the basis of the selective immune-polarization of MPs
induced by the different IFNs. In particular, immune
genes such, IL-6, chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1) [50], CD2BP2 and chemokine ligand
3-like 1 (CCL3L1), were specifically expressed by the signature IFNs. CCR1 encodes a member of the beta chemokine receptor family, that binds macrophage
inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), regulated
on activation normal T expressed and secreted protein
(RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein 3 (MCP3), and myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1 (MPIF-1).

immune cells to the site of inflammation [10, 51, 52 Cell
Migration Consortium http://wrpx00.bioch.virginia.edu/
cellmig_test/cmcweb/resource/cmckb/
sci_molecules_list.html] CCL3L1 binds to several chemokine receptors including chemokine binding protein 2
and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5). CCR5 is a
co-receptor for HIV, and binding of CCL3L1 to CCR5
inhibits HIV entry [52,53]. Thus regulation of CCL3L1 by
signature-IFNs may represent a selective mechanism of
viral immunity.
The activation of transcription of CCL1 and CD2BP2 in
MPs by signature IFNs is an interesting finding considering that these two genes are normally activated in T cells.
CCL1/ inflammatory cytokine I-309 is normally released
by activated T cells during inflammation [52], and the
CD2BP2 adaptor binds the CD2 cytoplasmic tail and regulates interleukin-2 production [54]. The modulation of
CCL3L1, CCR1, CCL1, CD2BP2 by the signature-IFNs
confirms the dominant role of these factors in the first
phase of the innate immune response, inflammation,
viral defense, and regulation of inflammatory cytokines
such as IL-2.
Macrophage expressed gene 1 (MPEG1) [55,56] (NKG7)
[57], NKTR [58], MALT-1, LYZ AND CD164 were upregulated by the non-signature group suggesting that these
genes with potential cytotoxic and inflammatory functions may increase the effector function of MPs. It is
important to notice that IFN-αWA and IFN-αK behaved as
the non-signature IFNs regarding activation of immune
genes (NKTR, CD164 and MPEG) and thus did not cluster
with the signature IFNs (Figure 4). These two IFN alphas
may contribute to a special type of MP polarization which
may be leading to an intermediate phase of activation in
between alternative and classical pathways. The non-signature IFNs also induced the expression of genes involved
with cell adhesion and complement regulation: LAMR1
[59], ICAM3 [60], CD164 [61] and complement component 1 receptor subcomponent (C1R) [62] providing further evidence that IFNs belonging to the non-signaturelike group may polarize MPs towards the classical pathway of monocyte activation.
Signature IFNs specifically affected a group of genes
involved in eukaryotic translation and listed in category
13) biosynthesis/regulation of translation: eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A) [63], eukaryotic
translation elongation factor 1 delta (EEF1D) [64], and
eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) [65].
This supports the notion that the powerful stimulus of
activation induced by the signature IFNs on immune cells
is a global type of regulation directly affecting target molecules at the levels of both transcription and translation.

http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/3/1/24

Genes upregulated by signature IFNs and belonging to
more than one functional group were particularly interesting because they could represent central and shared
molecular and cellular switches in pathways not previously reported to be influenced by the signature-IFNs'
activity. The ZAK (sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper
containing kinase AZK) gene appeared to be a very dominant signature IFNs gene since it was shared by 9 out of 16
functional groups analyzed. ZAK encodes a mixed lineage
kinase with a leucine zipper and a sterile alpha motif. The
expression of ZAK in mammalian cells may lead to the
activation of the JNK/SAPK (MAP kinase family) pathway
as well as the activation of the transcription factor, NFkappaB. Furthermore over-expression of ZAK leads to
apoptosis in tumor cell lines [66].
Phylogenic analysis
To determine whether a correlation existed between closeness of the primary amino acid sequence of type I IFNs
and functional similarities we compared the sequence
relationship among the 13 αIFNs and IFN-β. The phylogenic analysis did not predict the differentiation between
signature and non-signature IFNs and, in fact, the signature IFNs included proteins phylogenically quite unrelated (IFN-αWA, IFN-αF and IFN-αB2 Figure 5).
Therefore, more limited domains of the structure of each
IFN may be responsible for their different functional
properties. Comparison of the primary amino acid
sequences of IFN-β and the 13 αIFNs identified several
similarities (Figure 6). Although there was no exclusive
sequence variation that could distinguish signature from
non-signature IFNs, some amino acids were more likely
present in one or the other group. Three regions appeared
to be most significant in distinguishing the subgroups of
the protein and included: residues 93 through 109, residues 174 through 188-9, and at residue 123. The differences were greatest at residues 123 and 179 where
signature IFNs (except IFN-β) had the same amino acid (I
at 124 and T at 179, red arrows, figure 6), but these amino
acids were present in only 2 of 6 non-signature αIFNs.

Discussion
Interferons are important cytokines with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immune modulatory functions [67].
The IFNs are divided into two classes, type I and type II.
The type I IFNs include the α, β, τ and ωIFNs, while IFN-γ
is the only type II IFN. It has generally been believed that
the various type I IFNs have markedly different biological
functions and the immune modulatory effects of type I
IFNs vary widely among individual IFNs. IFNs exert many
of their effects by modulating MP functions [1,68]. The
stimulation of MPs by cytokines, including IFNs, results in
the activation of several different pathways; some of
which are common to different stimuli and some that are
unique for each stimuli. This study shows that most type

was preformed with Cluster W. The signature IFNs are shown in blue and the non-signature IFNs are shown in red.

I IFNs share some MP activation pathways and functional
differences among IFNs are due to additional diversification of their function through other pathways of activation. In particular, the effects of seven IFN-α and IFN-β on
LPS-stimulated MPs were remarkably similar. These similarities were not apparent after 4 hours of stimulation and
required a longer process of down-stream activation that
could be identified in our study at 9 hours.
Since we only studied one subject, the transcriptional profile presented in this study may not represent the plethora
of biological effects that IFN can induce under in vitro or in
vivo conditions because secondary autocrine (in different
donors) and paracrine modulation through the cytokine
network following a primary stimulation may introduce
diverse on and off switches that could override the original signal. Nevertheless, this is an informative analysis on
the effects of IFN subtypes on the late stages of LPS stimulation and, therefore, maybe most informative on the way
mononuclear phagocytes are polarized by IFNs during
their activation and or maturation.
A group of 42 signature genes was upregulated by all the
tested IFNs. Furthermore, all 42 signature genes have
previously been found to be associated with IFNs (Table
1). The analysis of a group of 83 genes that were differentially expressed among the signature and non-signature
IFNs found that the signature IFNs affected a variety of cell
functions not only by being potent inducers of gene transcription and translation but by directly and indirectly
affecting crucial regulatory cell cycle and metabolic pathways. In addition, signature IFNs were found to be partic-

ularly involved in the first phase of the innate immune
response, inflammation, and viral defense. In contrast,
the non-signature IFNs gene profiling suggested that these
immune-modulators can trigger cytotoxic responses and
likely increase the effector functions of MPs or classical
pathways of monocyte activation.
Type I IFNs play an important role in autoimmune disorders. Serum levels of IFN-α are increased in some patients
with the autoimmune SLE. The gene expression profiles of
peripheral blood MPs is also abnormal in patients with
SLE. Analysis of peripheral blood MPs from patients with
SLE has found that IFN-inducible genes are upregulated in
almost all patients with SLE [2,3,67] and the genes upregulated in SLE patients were similar to those upregulated in
peripheral blood MPs stimulated in vitro with IFN-α [13,67]. As a result the IFN-inducible genes that are
upregulated in SLE have been called IFN signature genes.
Many of the IFN-inducible genes up regulated in SLE
patients are the same genes we found were upregulated by
the treatment of LPS-stimulated MPs with the eight signature IFNs. The genes upregulated both in MPs from
patients with SLE and by LPS-stimulated genes treated
with the signature IFNs included OAS1, OAS2, LY6E,
MX1, CIG5, and hepatitis C-associated microtubular
aggregation protein (44 kD) [2,3,67].
Hilkens et al studied the effects of three IFNs, the signature
IFNs, IFN-α1, IFN-α2, and the non-signature IFN, IFN-αF
on the expression of 150 IFN stimulated genes by dendritic cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and found that the qualitative effects of the three

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of IFN-β and the 13 α-IFNs studied. The signature IFNs are shown in blue
and the non-signature IFNs are shown in red. Amino acids that were more likely to be present in signature IFNs are shown in

IFNs were similar but there were quantitative differences
[69]. The IFN stimulated genes were more highly induced
by IFN-α2 and IFN-αF than IFN-α1, but these differences
were overcome by increasing the concentration of IFN-αI.
There was, however, one exception. The expression of IP10 was induced by IFN-α2 and IFN-αF, but not by IFN-αI.
This supports our finding that the differences in transcriptional profiles of MPs treated by different type I IFNs are
due to distinct effects of each of the IFNs rather than differences in the activation of IFN-specific genes.
Although increased serum levels of IFN-α and IFN-ω have
been found in some patients with SLE [67], the
proportion of patients with detectable IFN in serum is

much smaller than the proportion of SLE patients with
peripheral blood MPs that display evidence of IFN-stimulation by gene expression profiling [1]. However, since the
IFN genes upregulated in MPs from SLE patients were similar to those upregulated by MPs stimulated with IFN-α,
most studies have measured IFN-α serum levels in
patients with SLE. Our study suggests other type I IFNs in
addition to IFN-α could be responsible of the abnormal
MP gene expression profiles in patients with SLE. It may
be that IFNs other than IFN-α are increased in SLE patients
but the ELISA assays used to measure IFN-α may not
detect other type I IFNs that could result in a similar MP
gene expression profile. One commonly used IFN-α ELISA
kit recognizes IFN-αA, IFN-α2, IFN-αA/D, IFN-αD, IFN-

αK, and IFN-α4b, but not IFN-β or IFN-γ (BioSource International USA, Inc., Camarillo, CA) another kit recognizes
IFN-αA, α2, αA/D, αB2, αC, αD, αG, αH, αI, αJ, αK, αWA,
and α4b (PBL laboratories multi species IFN α elisa kit).
Type I IFNs belong to a family of homologous helical
cytokines. The various αIFNs have approximately 80%
amino acid sequence homology and the α and βIFNs have
approximately 30% sequence homology [70]. The α and
βIFNs, however, all have a similar three-dimensional
structure. They are made up of nearly parallel bundles of
five α helices. In addition to the shared tertiary structure,
the α and βIFNs signal cells through the same receptor
complex, the common IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR). This
receptor is made up of two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.
IFNAR2 plays a greater role in binding type I IFNs than
IFNAR1. Although IFNAR2 is the major IFN binding
component of the receptor, the formation of the tertiary
complex of IFNAR2 and IFN with IFNAR1 increases the
affinity of IFN to IFNAR2 up to 20-fold.
The binding of IFN-α2 to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 has been
extensively investigated [64-68]. IFNAR2 binds to the A
helix of IFN-α2 (residues 12–15), the AB loop (residues
26–35), and the E helix (residues 144–153) [71]. The
opposite face of IFN-α2, the B and C helices, is involved
with interactions with IFNAR1 [70]. Modeling of the
interactions of IFNAR2 and IFN-α2 based on multidimensional NMR analysis of these molecules found that IFNα2 residues R33, D35 and R149 interact with a
hydrophilic strip of matching charges in IFNAR2. Other
important IFN-α2 residues involved with the binding to
IFNAR2 are M16 and A19 of the A helix, L26 and L30 of
the AB loop, and A145 and M148 of the E helix. Mutagenesis analysis of IFN-α2 found six residues important in
IFNAR2 binding: L30, R33, R144, A145, and M148. The
residues we found that differ between the signature and
non-signature IFNs are in areas that are not critical to the
binding of IFN-α2 to IFNAR2. Our findings suggest that
changes in IFN-α2 residues in the carboxy end (residues
174, 177, 178-9, 183 and 189), the D helix (residue 124)
and the C helix (residues 94, 101, 102, 103, 106, and 109)
may affect the function of α and βIFNs and are be responsible for the functional similarities among the signature
IFNs. We speculate that these changes may affect the tertiary structure of type I IFNs and there binding by IFNAR1.

potent host antiviral and antitumor responses. Since several different IFNs have similar effects, when clinical or
molecular evidence suggest that serum IFN levels are
increased, assays that detect a wide range of type I IFNs
should be used to measure soluble IFN levels.

Conclusion
MPs demonstrate a biphasic response to cytokine stimulation and 9 hours after IFN treatment LPS-stimulated MPs
had a striking gene expression profile. When treated with
eight type I IFNs the same group of genes were strongly
upregulated. IFNs play a critical role in host defense and
the redundant function of these signature IFNs may help
insure that there are multiple pathways of activation of
