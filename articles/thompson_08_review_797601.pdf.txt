Review
With the tremendous upsurge in research activity on
Cryptosporidium in the mid 1990's, the only comprehensive reference work available at the time was the first edition of this book. As such, it became the 'bible' for many
researchers starting out on investigations on this remarkable parasite, and stood the test of time for many years.
Today, the volume of research articles on Cryptosporidium
is enormous and not surprisingly, for an edited text to
provide a comprehensive and up to date resource that is
representative of current developments is a tall order! The
chapters on genomics and biochemistry are valuable additions, and the host assemblage chapters provide a useful
resource. However, I do not feel this second edition will
find its place on as many of the bookshelves of Cryptosporidium researchers as did the first edition. Why? The
field is moving so quickly that this new edition cannot be
said to reflect the current status in some fields of Cryptosporidium research. The most recent literature cited is two
years old, although, I know from personal experience with
edited volumes how difficult it is to ensure that the final
publication is up-to-date in such a fast moving field. However, recent developments in surface receptors, the host
parasite interface, developmental biology, phylogenetic
affinities and how these relate to Cryptosporidium's unique
biology, are given only cursory mention but are likely to
dominate thinking over the next few years, which promise
to be an exciting period of Cryptosporidium research.

miology and transmission (via food and water),
diagnosis, immune responses and clinical disease, Cryptosporidium in specific host assemblages, and in vivo and in
vitro maintenance. There is no contents page listing specific chapters and their contributors which I find most
unusual in such a book, and thus it is difficult to find your
way around. This is exacerbated by the type of paper used
and quality of some of the figures that have been reprinted from the first edition.
This is a useful purchase for libraries but individual
researchers, who have a copy of the previous edition, can
be better informed by the frequent and varied reviews that
have, and continue to, appear on a regular basis.
