Abstract
Background: Serologic surveillance of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses is carried out by the hemagglutination inhibition
(HI) test using reference reagents. This method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test
to detect antigenic differences (subtypes) between circulating influenza virus, vaccine- and/or reference- strains.
However, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed during
serosurveillance of influenza A viruses in pig and poultry farms. The objective of this study was to examine the
effects of influenza virus genetic and antigenic drift on serologic testing using standard HI assays and reference
reagents. Low pathogenic AI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic
analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serologic testing using antisera produced with year-specific AI virus
isolates.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence between early LPAI H5N2 viruses (1994 - 1998) and
more recent virus field isolates (2002 - 2008). Results of the HI test were markedly influenced by the selection of
the AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as reference antigen for the assay. These analyses indicate that LPAI
H5N2 viruses in Mexico are constantly undergoing genetic drift and that serosurveillance of AI viruses is
significantly influenced by the antigen or antisera used for the HI test.
Conclusions: Reference viral antigens and/or antisera need to be replaced constantly during surveillance of AI
viruses to keep pace with the AI antigenic drift. This strategy should improve the estimation of antigenic
differences between circulating AI viruses and the selection of suitable vaccine strains.

Background
Avian Influenza (AI) virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenzavirus A genus. This virus possesses
eight segments of single-stranded RNA genome. Two of
these segments encode for two important membrane glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
[1], that play a key role during cellular infection. These
two proteins are used for virus subtype classification
[1,2]. Also, depending on severity of disease in avian species, AI viruses are categorized into highly- and lowpathogenic (HPAI and LPAI, respectively) viruses [1,2].
In response to the recent cases of human infections
caused by HPAI H5N1 viruses, authorities and scientists
were encouraged to review and apply policies for

effective surveillance and control of AI infections [3-5].
In many countries, the use of AI vaccines was banned
or discouraged because vaccination programs could
interfere with appropriate detection of HPAI outbreaks
[5]. However, the use of AI vaccines has been reconsidered by some countries due to the recent increase in AI
cases in commercial farms and devastating consequences for human health [5].
In Mexico, an AI vaccination program was established
in 1994. Initially, the program was instituted to control
the HPAI H5N2 virus outbreak that occurred during
that year [6]. A commercial vaccine against AI was produced using the officially authorized virus strain A/Ck/
México/CPA-232/1994(H5N2). A few months later, the
HPAI virus was eradicated from Mexico and it was
decided to continue the vaccination program to protect
commercial flocks from LPAI H5N2 viruses [6].

After almost two decades of using the AI vaccine in
Mexico, commercial farms remain HPAI-free. However,
veterinary services have observed an increase in respiratory signs in vaccinated, field challenged (LPAI virus)
birds. Moreover, animal health laboratories have
reported significant differences in the hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) tests between field LPAI H5N2 isolates
and the vaccine strain [7]. These discrepancies observed
during AI surveillance could be attributed to a gradual
accumulation of antigenic drift. In fact, it was shown
that LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico are constantly
undergoing genetic drift, and that recent AI virus isolates have significant antigen divergence when compared
to the AI vaccine strain [7].
In Mexico, as in many other countries, AI surveillance
is primarily carried out by the HI test using reference
antigens or antisera [8,9]. This method is recommended
by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as
standard test to detect antigenic differences (subtypes)
between circulating, vaccine and reference AI virus
strains [8,10], and to evaluate vaccine efficacy [8,11,12].
Antigens for production of vaccines or antisera are
maintained and distributed by official reference laboratories [10] and in many cases, these antigens are produced with AI viruses isolated more than a decade ago
(e.g. [13,14]).
Although the HI test and reference antigens are used
worldwide for AI surveillance; little has been done to
examine the effects of AI antigenic drift on the antigenic
surveillance of field strains. We hypothesize that the
antigenic drift that occurred in recent field isolates of
H5N2 virus produced significant variation in the accuracy of the serologic surveillance. The objective of the
present study was to examine the effects of AI antigenic
drift on immune reactivity of reference antisera using
standard HI tests.

Results
Low pathogenic AI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico
between 2002 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analyses of AI hemagglutinin genes and immune reactivity
using antisera produced with AI virus isolated in different years.
Phylogenetic analysis of Avian Influenza hemagglutinin
genes

Field isolates of LPAI H5N2 virus were used for this
study. These viruses were isolated from vaccinated birds
that developed the clinical presentation of the disease.
Virus were replicated in chicken embryo and reverse
transcriptase PCR was used for the amplification of the
HA gene (between nucleotide positions 451 and 1262), a
marker for the virulence potential of AI viruses [15].
HA gene segments were sequenced and annotated for

phylogenetic analyses. To accomplish a more comprehensive evolutionary history of AI H5N2 viruses in
Mexico, all available A/Ck/México/H5N2 sequences in
the Influenza Virus Resource at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information [16] were retrieved and used
for genetic analysis.
Phylogenic analysis of partial HA gene sequences from
AI H5N2 viruses isolated between 1994 and 2008
revealed that the AI viruses are constantly undergoing
genetic drifts. Phylogenetic trees derived from partial
nucleotide sequences demonstrated that HA genes
amplified from field LPAI H5N2 isolates distinctively
cluster by year of isolation (Figure 1). Similar tree topologies were obtained by the maximum likelihood method
(data not shown). These phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by estimating percent sequence identity scores
for pairwise comparisons of LPAI H5N2 isolates and the
vaccine strain (Table 1). Together, these data indicate
that recent LPAI H5N2 isolates (2007 - 2008) have
undergone significant molecular drifts when compared
to the vaccine strain (A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994), isolated in 1994 and early viruses isolated between 1994
and 1998 (Figure 1 and Table 1). This analysis confirms
that HA gene lineages in Mexico follow a yearly cumulative trend of sequence mutations. Interestingly, one of
the most recent virus isolates (sample ID: H5 28 2007)
isolated in 2007, was closely related to the vaccine strain
and early virus isolates (Figure 1). This result could indicate that at some point a vaccine-like virus may have
circulated in commercial flocks during 2007.
The phylogenetic analysis also revealed significant
divergence between different strains of LPAI H5N2 isolates in Mexico. Viruses circulating between 1994 and
1998 were highly divergent to viruses isolated between
2002 and 2008 (Figure 1 and Table 1). These results
indicate that current AI virus circulating in Mexico possesses sufficient genetic divergence to warrant a vaccine
strain update. To assess the effect of this antigenic
divergence between field isolates and the official vaccine
strain, serologic testing was evaluated by means of HI
assays.
Serologic testing using hemagglutination inhibition tests

The thirty-four field isolates of LPAI H5N2 virus were
used to evaluate immune reactivity using standard HI
tests. AI antisera was produced using seven year-specific
AI H5N2 antigens: A) A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994,
reference antigen and virus strain used for vaccine production; B) A/Ck/México/2002; C) A/Ck/México/2003;
D) A/Ck/México/2005; E) A/Ck/México/2006; F) A/Ck/
México/2007 and G) A/Ck/México/2008. The HI assay
demonstrated highly variable results when field LPAI
H5N2 viruses where tested against antisera derived from
year-specific AI H5N2 strains.

In the HI tests using antiserum produced with antigen
A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994, geometric mean titers
(GMT) were significantly higher in LPAI H5N2 viruses
isolated in 2002 compared to viruses isolated between
2006, 2007 and 2008 (Table 2). The HI test GMT of
viruses isolated between 2002 and 2005 were comparable. These results indicate that at the HA antigenic
level, 2002 and 2005 LPAI viruses were more closely
related to A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994 than more
recent virus isolates (2006 - 2008) (Table 2).
For the HI test using antiserum produced with antigen
A/Ck/México/2002, GMT revealed close homology
between the 2002 virus isolates; however, these GMT did
not follow a yearly trend for the other years. For example,
2005 LPAI isolates were antigenically divergent to A/Ck/
México/2002 whereas no differences were detected
between viruses isolated in 2006 and 2007. In contrast,
2008 isolates were antigenically divergent when compared
to 2007 viruses; indicating highly antigenic divergence
between viruses isolated at close time points (Table 2).
When A/Ck/México/2003 and A/Ck/México/2005
antisera were used for the HI assays, antigenic homology
was comparable between LPAI viruses isolated in 2002,
2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. These results indicate that at
the HA antigenic level, this collection of LPAI viruses
possess comparable antigenic homology with the A/Ck/
México/2003 virus (Table 2). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the GMT in the HI test were highly variable.
In the HI test using the A/Ck/México/2006, LPAI
viruses isolated between 2002 and 2007 showed comparable antigenic homology. In contrast, viruses isolated
during 2008 showed a reduced antigenic homology
when compared to 2007 LPAI isolates. (Table 2).
The HI test using antiserum A/Ck/México/2007 followed a yearly trend. LPAI viruses isolated in 2006 and
2007 showed comparable antigenic homology. In contrast,

Discussion
Worldwide, human and animal health organizations
have established detailed schemes for influenza surveillance. These programs rely on serological assays to characterize virus subtypes, establishing seroprevalence and
evaluating vaccine efficacy [8,11,17]. In veterinary medicine, the HI test is the standard technique used to
detect antigenic differences between circulating influenza virus, vaccine- and/or reference- strains [8,9,17,18].
Because the HI test is used worldwide for AI surveillance, it is essential to identify potential pitfalls of using
this serologic test. The objective of the present study was
to examine the effects of AI antigenic drift on serosurveillance using reference antisera during standard HI
tests. We amplified, sequenced and analyzed partial AI
hemagglutinin genes and performed serologic tests using
LPAI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and
2008. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that molecular drift
in HA gene follow a yearly trend, suggesting gradually

cumulative sequence mutations. Recent (2006 - 2008)
field isolates of LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico have
undergone important antigenic drift in the HA gene
when compared to early LPAI isolates or vaccine strains
(1994 - 1996). Viruses isolated between 1994 and 1998
cluster in distinctive and divergent lineages compared to
viruses isolated between 2002 and 2008. Comparable
evolutionary trends were observed in previous analyses of
LPAI H5N2 lineages in Mexico [7,19].

these LPAI isolates were antigenically divergent to early

These results indicate the LPAI H5N2 viruses circulating
during 2006 and 2007 possess year-specific antigenic
divergence compared to other years of isolation. Comparable trend was observed in the HI test using the A/Ck/
México/2008 antiserum. LPAI viruses circulating between
2006 and 2007 were more antigenically related to the
A/Ck/México/2008 virus (Table 2). These results corroborate that recent AI viruses have accumulated significant
antigenic drifts to be distinguishable from early AI isolates
(e.g. 2002 and 2005). Taken together, these results show
some yearly tendencies in antigenic homology in which
early LPAI isolated strains (e.g. 2002) are more antigenically related to the vaccine strain A/Ck/México/CPA-232/
1994 and recent LPAI isolates (2007 and 2008) more
antigenically related to the A/Ck/México/2008 virus
(Figure 2). These results indicate that the antigenic differences of circulating LPAI H5N2 viruses may warrant a
new vaccine and serosurveillance antigen update.

These evolving genetic drifts observed in HA genes of
LPAI H5N2 may explain the increasing incidence of
respiratory signs in vaccinated, field challenged birds,
and the discrepancies observed during LPAI H5N2 serosurveillance. To confirm this idea, serologic testing was
carried out using an array of seven different reference
AI antisera produced with LPAI H5N2 antigens isolated
in 1994, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. These
analyses revealed that HI test results are significantly
influenced by the selection of year-specific antigens.
Generally, early LPAI H5N2 virus isolates (e.g. 2002)
produced higher HI titers with antisera produced with
early isolates (e.g. 1994). In contrast, more recent LPAI
H5N2 isolates (i.e. 2007 and 2008) produced higher HI
titers with antisera produced with recent LPAI isolated
strains (i.e. year 2008). These results explain the high
variability of LPAI titers in commercial flocks when the
reference AI antigen A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994
(H5N2) is used in the HI test.
Despite that considerable efforts have been made to
produce reference antibodies to improve the accuracy of
the HI test during serosurveillance of AI [20,21], the
accelerated mutation rate of AI viruses and the rapid
accumulation of antigen drift [7,19,22] require a recurrent update of reference antigens or antisera for accurate surveillance. For example, in Mexico around 2004,
veterinary services reported that AI serum titers in commercial flocks were highly variable when the reference
antigen A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994(H5N2) (isolated in
1994) was used for the HI test. Similar discrepancies
between reference antisera and field isolates were
observed in the serosurveillance of H3N2 and H1N1
influenza A viruses in pigs [23,24].
Our results confirm the idea that the accelerated antigenic drift observed in AI viruses, not only affects the
performance and accuracy of the HI test during AI serosurveillance but also, the effectiveness of AI vaccines
[7,19,22]. Hence, for an effective control of AI H5N2
viruses, reference antigens and vaccine strains must be
replaced constantly to keep pace with the AI antigenic
drift. This approach has been a successful strategy for
the control and surveillance of human influenza [25].

Conclusions
The present study reveals that due to the rapid antigenic
drift of AI viruses, standardization and constant renewal
of reference antigens is required during the establishment
of influenza serosurveillance programs. More importantly,
these data provide clear evidence of the impact of antigenic drifts on the evasion of the immune system. Antibodies produced against early AI viruses (e.g. A/Ck/México/
CPA-232/1994) have reduced effectiveness against LPAI
viruses currently circulating in the environment. Thus, the
observed genetic and antigenic differences of circulating

LPAI H5N2 viruses warrant an update of the vaccine
strain and serosurveillance antigens.

Methods
Avian Influenza field isolates

Thirty-four field isolates of LPAI virus, subtype H5N2
were used for the study. These viruses were isolated in
2002, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 from vaccinated birds
that developed the clinical presentation of the disease.
These isolates were previously reported to the Mexican
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development,
Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA, its Spanish acronym).
Hemagglutination inhibition assays

The thirty-four field isolates of LPAI H5N2 virus were
evaluated by the standard HI test [12] using chicken
antisera produced with seven different AI H5N2 antigens: A) A/Ck/México/CPA-232/1994, reference antigen
and virus strain used for vaccine production; B) A/Ck/
México/2002; C) A/Ck/México/2003; D) A/Ck/México/
2005; E) A/Ck/México/2006; F) A/Ck/México/2007 and
G) A/Ck/México/2008. Reference antisera were prepared
by conventional methods using inactivated viruses [26].
Amplification of Avian Influenza hemagglutinin gene

Viral RNA extraction from allantoic fluid was performed
using conventional methods [27]. Reverse transcriptase
PCR (RT-PCR) was used for the amplification of the
HA cleavage site sequence (from positions 451 to 1262
of the HA gene using sequence A/turkey/Ontario/7732/
66 as numbering system; accession number AB558456),
a marker for the virulence potential of AI viruses [15].
PCR protocols and primer sequences are described elsewhere [15]. Amplifications of an 812 bp. HA gene segment were performed using a RT-PCR kit (SuperScript
One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq; Carlsbad, CA).
After visual confirmation of the PCR products with
agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR products were purified
using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). Sequencing of the HA gene segments
was performed using the 3730XL automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, CA. USA).
Phylogenetic analysis of Avian Influenza hemagglutinin
genes

Nucleotide sequences obtained from the LPAI H5N2 field
isolates were inspected, trimmed and assembled using the
Sequencher 4.9 software (Ann Arbor, MI). To perform a
comprehensive evolutionary analysis of AI H5N2 viruses in
Mexico, all available H5N2 sequences were also retrieved
from the Influenza Virus Resource at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information [16]. Nucleotide sequences
were aligned using ClustalW software [28], manually
inspected for quality and trimmed to equal length. Aligned

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/6/57

sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis using the
maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods
[29]. Analysis were performed using the MEGA4 [30],
PhyML [31] and Seaview [32] software. Trees were rooted
using [GenBank accession number AY497063] (vaccine
strain) nucleotide sequence. The statistical significance of
branch order was estimated by the generation of 1000
replications of bootstrap re-sampling of the originallyaligned nucleotide sequences.

Statistical analysis

Results of HI test assays for each LPAI H5N2 virus were
used to compare GMT between different year-specific
antisera. Analyses were performed using SAS software
(Statview, Version 5.0.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
ANOVA and Fisher’s protected least significant difference test. Results were considered significant if P ≤ 0.05.
