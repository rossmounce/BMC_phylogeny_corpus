Abstract
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underling hydration during oocyte maturation, we characterized the
structure of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) novel-water selective aquaporin 1 (AQP1b) that thought to be involved
in oocyte hydration. The aqp1b cDNA encodes a 263 amino acid protein that includes the six potential
transmembrane domains and two Asn-Pro-Ala motifs. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed
transcription of Japanese eel aqp1b in ovary and testis but not in the other tissues. In situ hybridization studies
with the eel aqp1b cRNA probe revealed intense eel aqp1b signal in the oocytes at the perinucleolus stage and
the signals became faint during the process of oocyte development. Light microscopic immunocytochemical
analysis of ovary revealed that the Japanese eel AQP1b was expressed in the cytoplasm around the yolk globules
which were located in the peripheral region of oocytes during the primary yolk globule stage; thereafter, the
immunoreactivity was observed throughout the cytoplasm of oocyte as vitellogenesis progressed. The
immunoreactivity became localized around the large membrane-limited yolk masses which were formed by the
fusion of yolk globules during the oocyte maturation phase. These results together indicate that AQP1b, which is
synthesized in the oocyte during the process of oocyte growth, is essential for mediating water uptake into eel
oocytes.
Background
Teleost oocytes are arrested at the prophase of the first
meiotic division during their long period of growth
(vitellogenic phase) [1]. After completion of vitellogenesis, oocytes undergo maturation (meiosis resumption)
which is accompanied by several important processes,
such as germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), hydration
of oocytes, lipid coalescence and clearing of ooplasm
[2]. In particular, in marine teleosts spawning buoyant
eggs in seawater, oocytes undergo a significant increase
in size because of rapid water uptake during meiosis
resumption [3-5]. During these processes, the oocytes
become buoyant, which is essential for their oceanic survival and dispersal as well as for the initiation of early
embryogenesis [4,6,7].

Previous studies in marine teleosts producing buoyant
(pelagic) eggs in seawater [8,9] and our recent study in
the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica [5] indicated that
free amino acids and small peptides produced by yolk
protein hydrolysis [6,7,10] and the accumulation of ions
such as K + and Cl - [10,11] during oocyte maturation
provide an osmotic driving force for water influx into
the oocyte. Moreover, aquaporin, an open molecular
channel transporting water and other solutes along an
osmotic gradient [12], was found to contribute to the
rapid water influx into the oocyte during oocyte maturation in the gilthead seabream (Sparus auratus; [4,9]. In
the Japanese eel [5], although possible contribution of
aquaporin on oocyte hydration is suggested, no direct
evidence have not been available until today.
Recent phylogenetic and genomic analyses showed
that teleosts have two closely linked AQP1 paralogous
genes, termed aqp1a and aqp1b (formally AQP1o). In
the gilthead seabream, the aqp1b gene was highly

expressed in the ovary containing previtellogenic and
early vitellogenic oocytes [4]. Immunocytochemical analysis [4,7] revealed that AQP1b protein appeared to be
located within a thin layer just below the oocyte plasma
membrane. These observations therefore indicate that
AQP1b is synthesized de novo by the oocyte at the
initiation of vitellogenesis on an already existing mRNA
pool. Closely linked to aqp1b paralogous gene, termed
aqp1a, was also found from European eel kidney and
was ubiquitously expressed [13]. Although there have
been several other reports on the AQP contributing to
osmoregulation in intestine [14], and gills [15], there is
no detailed information concerning the AQP related
mechanisms of oocyte hydration in eel.
Freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla are distributed
worldwide and have unique characteristics such as a catadromous life history. The Japanese eel A. japonica is
believed to migrate from the rivers into the ocean and
spawn eggs in a particular area in the western North
Pacific ocean (west of the Mariana Islands; [16]). Japanese eels found in rivers and the costal region of Japan
are sexually immature and never mature under commercial rearing conditions [17,18]. Repeated injections of
salmon pituitary extracts (SPE) induced vitellogenesis
and subjective injection of 17, 20b-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP, an eel maturation-inducing steroid)
successfully induced maturation and ovulation of
oocytes [18-21]. In vitro addition of DHP into the incubation medium also induced GVBD and ovulation of
oocytes [5,22,23]. During in vivo and in vitro maturation, Japanese eel oocytes undergo a significant increase
in size because of rapid water uptake, and the eggs
become buoyant [5]. Recent in vitro experiments from
our laboratory showed that addition of HgCl2, an inhibitor of AQP water permeability, inhibited HCG- or
DHP-induced water influx into oocytes and moreover,
the inhibition was reversed by the addition of b-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that AQP facilitates water uptake
by acting as a water channel in the oocyte of the Japanese eel [5]. However, there are no studies on AQP
gene expression and its protein localization in the
oocytes of Japanese eel or other primitive teleosts.
Therefore, in order to clarify AQP mediated mechanisms of oocyte hydration in the Japanese eel, the present
paper reports the cloning, expression and sub-cellular
localization of aqp1b using in situ hybridization and
immunocytochemistry during oocyte growth and
maturation.

Methods
Fish and ovarian samples

Cultured female Japanese eels weighing approximately
300 to 500 g were obtained from a fish farm and the Shibushi Station, National Center for Stock Enhancement,

Page 2 of 11

Fisheries Research Agency, Japan. After acclimation to
seawater, they were kept without feeding in 400-L indoor
circulating tanks under a natural photoperiod at a water
temperature of 20°C. Cultured female eels are sexually
immature and the oocytes never develop exceeding the
early vitellogenic stage under the rearing condition
[18,24]. To induce sexual maturation, they were intraperitoneally injected with SPE (20-30 mg/kg body weight)
once a week. SPE was prepared by homogenizing salmon
(Oncorhynchus keta) pituitary powder with a 0.9% NaCl
solution, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm
[19,24,25]. Oocytes at the previtellogenic and vitellogenic
stages were taken from maturing female eels during the
process of artificially induced sexual maturation. After
10-13 injections, full-grown oocytes and oocytes at the
migratory nucleus stage were taken from the genital pore
of fully matured female eels with a polyethylene cannula.
Matured oocytes were obtained from female eels that
were processed according to the method described previously [18,19,25]. Briefly, females that possessed oocytes
over 750 μm in diameter at the migratory nucleus stage
were injected with SPE (30 mg/kg body weight) as a
priming dose, followed 24 h later by an intraperitoneal
injection of DHP (2 μg/g body weight). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University
of Miyazaki guidelines and every effort was made to
minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
Isolation of Japanese eel aqp1b

The ovary was collected from a maturing female Japanese eel, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored -80°C
until used. Total RNA was extracted from ovary with
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
RNA was quantified on the basis of the absorbance at
260 nm and appeared to be non-degraded on a 1%
(w/v) denaturing agarose gel containing formaldehyde
and ethidium bromide. Complementary DNA was
synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamers and the Omniscript Reverese Transcriptase kit
(Qiagen, Hilden Germany). After reverse transcription
(RT), one-tenth of the RT reaction product was then
mixed with 0.5 μM of each primer, 0.5 mM dNTPs and
1.25 U PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) in a 50-μl reaction volume and
amplified by a three-step PCR protocol as follows: 94°C
for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 52°C for
30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. A pair of degenerate primers
based on the nucleotide sequence of other vertebrates
were designed to clone the Japanese eel aqp1b cDNA
(sense: 5’-TGGAGGRCNGTBCTDGCYGAGCT-3’; antisense: 5’-GCT GGDCCRAAWGWYCGAGCAGGGTT3’; IUB group codes were used: R = A/G, Y = C/T, W =
A/T, B = C/G/T, D = A/G/T, N = A/C/G/T). Sequence
information from the partial cDNA clone was used to

Kagawa et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:71
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/71

design gene-specific primers for 5’-RACE and 3’-RACE to
clone the full-length eel aqp1b.
5 ‘RACE and 3 ‘RACE were carried out using the
GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 μg total RNA was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and
decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP).
The GeneRacer RNA oligo was ligated to the TAP-treated mRNA with T4 RNA ligase and a cDNA template
generated by reverse transcription using SuperScript II
and the GeneRacer oligo dT primer. The 5’end of the
eel aqp1b was amplified using the antisense primers
5’GSP-1 (5’-AAGCCTTGAGCCACGGCAACACC-3’)
and 5’GSP-2 (5’-AGCTCGGAACACGCTTATCTGACAGC-3’) in combination with the GeneRacer 5’ Primer
and GeneRacer 5’ Nested Primer from the 5’RACE. For
3’RACE, sense primers 3’GSP-1 (5’-AGCTGTCAGATAAGCGTGTTCCGAGC-3’) and 3’GSP-2 (5’-AAGCTAAATGGTGTTGCCGTGGCTC-3’) were used in
combination with the GeneRacer 3’ Primer and GeneRacer 3’ Nested Primer to amplify the 3’ end of eel AQP1b
cDNA. The resultant DNA fragment was ligated and
subcloned using TOPO-XL (Invitrogen), and sequenced.
The cDNA clones were sequenced using an ABI PRISM
3130 × l DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). The nucleotide sequence was determined by analyzing more than four clones from distinct
amplification to avoid PCR errors. The nucleotide and
amino acid sequences were analyzed using the SeqMan
software (DNAStar, Madison WI, USA) and the BLAST
network service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The accession number of the sequence
reported in this paper has been deposited in the DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank as AB586029.

Tissue distribution of messenger RNA

One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to
first-strand cDNA using a random hexamer primer and
Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA).
After reverse transcription (RT), one-tenth of the RT
reaction product was then mixed with 0.5 μM of each
primer, 0.5 mM dNTPs and 0.2 U PrimeSTAR HS DNA
polymerase (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) in a
20-μl reaction volume and amplified by a three-step
PCR protocol as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by
30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1
min. Primers specific to the Japanese eel aqp1b were
designed, aqp1b sense (5’-GATTACCCTGGCTACGCTCATT-3’) and aqp1b antisense (5’-CTTGAGCCACAGCAACACCA-3’). These primers flank an intron in the
aqp1b sequence, so any amplicons from possible genomic contamination can be eliminated. A DNA positive
control reaction was performed using primers for
b-actin (GenBank accession number AB074846). Additionally, negative control reactions were performed
using RNA (without RT) as a template in our amplification protocol. Ten microlitres of product from each
reaction was analyzed using 2% agaraose gel in 1 × TAB
stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The amplified
fragments of aqp1b and b-actin, 173 and 226 bp, respectively, were sequenced to verify their specification.
In situ hybridization

Phylogenetic analysis

Multiple alignments of deduced amino acid sequences
were performed with CLUSTAL W [26]. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed based on amino acid sequence
alignments by the Neighbor-Joining method [27]. TreeView was used to display the phylogenetic tree. The
degree of support for internal branches was further
assessed by bootstrapping analysis consisting of 1000
replicates. All of the above analyses were performed with
the Internet server of the DNA Data Bank of Japan [28].
Full species names and GenBank accession numbers of
the species used to generate the tree are as follows: Japanese eel Anguilla japonica AQP1a, AB094502; European
eel Anguilla anguilla AQP1a, AJ564420; AQP1b,

To generate digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense and
sense RNA probes, cDNA was amplified by PCR using
primers for eel aqp1b. The gene-specific downstreamprimer contained an artificially introduced T7 RNA
polymerase recognition sequence (5’-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3’), and a 6 bp transcription initiation
sequence at its 5’-end to enable synthesis of transcripts.
Primer sequences are shown below, whereby the underline indicates the promoter sequence: for generation of
antisense probe: aqp1b forward: 5’-CATATTCGTTGGTATTTCAGCTGCAGTCGG-3’; aqp1b T7- reverse: 5’TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGGAGGTAGTCATAGACAAGGGCAGCTACCA G-3’. For production
of sense probe: aqp1b T7-forward: 5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGG CATATTCGTTGGTATTTCAGCTGCAGTCGG-3’; aqp1b reverse: 5’-GGAGGT
AGTCATAGACAA GGGCAGCTACCAG-3’. DIGlabelled RNA probes were generated from RT-PCRderived templates by in vitro transcription performed

Kagawa et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:71

using DIG RNA Labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The RNA probes synthesized were
quantified and an equal amount of each probe was used
for hybridization. In situ hybridizations were performed
using DIG-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes
according to a slightly modified method of [29]. Briefly,
freshly dissected ovarian fragments were fixed in Bouin’s
solution at 4°C overnight. Fixed ovarian fragments were
embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm) mounted onto
silane-coated slides (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan).
The sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and then
hybridized with cRNA probes. Coverslips were placed
over the sections, and the slides were incubated in
humidified chambers at 58°C for 18 h. Hybridized
probes were detected using the DIG Nucleic Acid
Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics).
Antibody

A polyclonal antibody was raised in a rabbit against a
synthetic peptide corresponding to part of the C-terminal region of eel AQP1b molecules (APAQEPLLEGCSAAQWTKG) (Figure 1). The antigen conjugated with
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLM) was emulsified with
complete Freund’s adjuvant, and immunization was performed in a New Zealand white rabbit (Uniqtech Co.
Ltd., Chiba, Japan). The antisera were affinity-purified
on thiopropyl sepharose 6B coupled to the synthetic
peptide. The anti-eel AQP1b antibody was used at
1:1000-2000 for immunocytochemistry and Western
blot analysis.
Western blot analysis

Ovarian fragments containing vitellogeinc oocytes at the
various developmental stages were used in the experiments. Western blot analysis was performed according
to the method of [30]. Prior to Western blotting, the
ovarian fragments and oocytes were homogenized in
SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10% SDS 4.5 ml: glycerin 3
ml: 2-mercaptoethanol 1.5 ml: bromophenol blue 0.75
ml: distilled water 0.25 ml) and the homogenates were
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 40 min at 4°C. The supernatant was used for the following sodium-dodecyl-sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
SDS-PAGE was performed on precast polyacryllaide gel
with a gradient of total acrylamide concentrations from
5% to 20% (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Protein bands on
SDS-PAGE gels were transblotted onto a Polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore,
Bedford, MA) using a semidry transfer apparatus
(Trans-Blot SD; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The transferred
proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue
(CBB), destained in 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid,
washed with Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp.) and dried.
Immunological detection of eel AQP1b was carried out

Page 4 of 11

using an antibody to the Japanese eel AQP1b described
above. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by
using a Histofine streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase complex kit (Nichirei Co. Ltd., Japan).
Immunocytochemistry

Ovarian fragments obtained from female eels were fixed
in Bouin’s solution at 4°C overnight. The immuocytochemical staining was performed as per the method
described previously [31]. Briefly, deparaffinized sections
were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to
remove endogenous perxoidase staining. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by using a Histofine streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase complex kit (Nichirei Co.
Ltd., Japan). After incubation with 10% normal goat
serum for 10 min, the sections were incubated with the
primary antisera for 30 min. The sections were then
rinsed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for 10 min. After rinsing with PBS, the sections
were incubated with streptavidin-linked horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) for 5 min. After a final wash with PBS,
the HRP complex was developed with a solution of
0.001% hydrogen peroxidase-0.05% 3,3-diaminobezidine
tetrahydrocholoride (Sigma, CA) in 0.05 M Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.6). After immunostaining, the sections
were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. All procedures were conducted at room temperature. The specificity of the immunostaining was confirmed by the
following controls: (1) primary antisera were substituted
with normal rabbit serum (NRS) or PBS, (2) primary
antisera were absorbed with purified synthetic peptide
corresponding to part of the C-terminal region of eel
AQP1b molecules. Replacement of primary antiserum
with PBS or NRS abolished the immunostaining of the
antiserum. The preabsorption of antiserum with an
excess amount of the synthetic peptide also greatly
reduced the immunostaining.

Results
Cloning of aquaporin1b cDNA and deduced amino acid
sequence (Figure 1)

The deduced protein sequence has 263 amino acids with
a calculated molecular mass of 28.0 kDa. According to
Kyte-Doolittle hydropathic analysis, AQP1b contained
six hydrophobic putative transmembrane domains connected by five loops (A-E) and extracellular N-terminal
and cytoplasmic C-terminal domains. Further analysis
indicated that Japanese eel AQP1b had a Asn-Pro-Ala
(NPA) motif in loops B and E, which is the hallmark of
the membrane intrinsic protein family. Figure 1 shows
the deduced amino acid sequence of the Japanese eel
aqp1b cDNA aligned with counterparts from other species. Japanese eel AQP1b shared high homology with
European eel (99%), zebrafish (65%), Senegale sole

(62%), gilthead seabream (61%) AQP1b, with lower identity to AQP1 from human (54%). The deduced amino
acid sequence homology of AQP1b with teleost AQP1s
was as follows: Japanese eel AQP1a 64%; European eel
AQP1a 64%; gilthead seabream AQP1a 66%; zebrafish
AQP1a 61%; Xenopus AQP1 55%; chicken AQP1 55%;
rat AQP1 53%; human AQP1 54%. To illustrate the phylogenetic relatedness of the Japanese eel AQP1b with
other reported AQP proteins, an evolutionary tree was
constructed using the neighbor-joining method of
CLUSTAL W. As expected from the sequence alignment, Japanese eel AQP1b fell into the cluster with the
AQP1b subfamily from other species (Figure 2).

Eel AQP1b expression and tissue distribution (Figure 3)

The expression of ovary-derived aqp1b in different Japanese eel tissues was assessed by RT-PCR analysis. For
RT-PCR analysis, selected regions of AQP1b cDNA
were amplified from the RT mixture with sequence-specific primers. As shown in Figure 3, an abundant amplification product of the aqp1b transcript was detected in
Japanese eel ovary and a relatively lower amount in the
testis. In contrast, the expression was barely detectable
in the other tissues tested (brain, eye, gill, oesophagus,
heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, and muscle). We
repeated the analysis using different primer sets and
found similar results (data not shown).

alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of AQP1 protein. Values at interior nodes are bootstrap percentages derived from 1000
replications. The scale bar indicates an evolutionary distance of 0.1 amino acid substitution per position in the sequence.

In situ hybridization

In situ hybridization was carried out to characterize the
cellular expression of eel aqp1b in the oocytes at various
developmental stages. Although an aqp1b signals could
not be observed at oocytes at the perinucleolus stage
(Figure 4A), the intense signal was first found in larger
oocytes at the same stage (Figure 4B). Relatively intense
signals were localized to regions within the cytoplasm
(Figure 4B) and later they became distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 4C). Similar intense signals

were found in the oocyte at the oil droplet stages
(Figure 4D). Thereafter, the expression of eel aqp1b signals became weak in association with oocyte growth
from the primary yolk (Figure 4E) to the secondary yolk
globule stage (Figure 4F) and sometimes became absent.
Immunocytochemistry

Immunoblotting analysis using the eel AQP1b antisera
on the extracts from ovarian fragments showed a single
protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 28

was performed using 1 μg of total RNA prepared from Japanese eel
tissues using the Omniscript kit (Qiagen). Amplification products
were analyzed on a 2.0% agarose gel and stained by ethidium
bromide. Control RT-PCR of b-actin using the same amount of

kDa, thus corresponding to the calculated molecular
mass of Japanese eel AQP1b (Figure 5). Immunocytochemical observation for eel AQP1b was performed in
ovarian fragments containing oocytes at various developmental stages. Previtellogenic ovarian follicles at the
perinucleolus and oil droplet stages were devoid of eel
AQP1b positive reaction (Figure 6). Intense immunoreaction was first observed in oocytes at the primary yolk
globule stage, exclusively in the vesicles (which are surmise yolk globules) located at the peripheral ooplasm
(Figure 7). Full-grown oocytes at the tertiary yolk

globule stage showed the germinal vesicle in a central
position and small yolk globules distributed in the cytoplasm. Intense immunoreactions were located around
yolk globules occupied in oocyte cytoplasm (Figure 8A,
D). During oocyte maturation phase, yolk globules fused
together and increased in size in oocytes at the migratory nucleus stage (Figure 8B) and yolk globules became
larger yolk masses but they did not fuse into a single
yolk mass in oocytes at the mature stage (Figure 8C).
Immunoreactions were observed around the membrane
bound yolk masses in oocytes at the migratory nucleus
stage (Figure 8E) and at the mature stage (Figure 8F).

Discussion
We have isolated and characterized a Japanese eel aqp1b
cDNA derived from ovary. The predicted amino acid
sequences of the cloned Japanese eel ovary-derived aqp1b
shared 99% overall sequence identity with that of the AQP1
previously reported in the European eel, Anguilla anguilla
[13] termed AQP1dup. Tingaud-Sequeira et al. [32] indicated, from results of phylogenetic and genomic analyses,
that teleosts, unlike tetrapods, have two closely linked
aqp1b paralogous genes, termed aqp1a and aqp1b. European AQP1dup is identical to that recently isolated from
the same species and named aqp1b. Therefore, it is certain
that the Japanese eel AQP that we cloned from the ovary is
a homologue of aqp1b. The Japanease eel APQ1b contains
three functional domains; an N-terminal extracellular

acids in Japanese eel AQP1b may be involved in waterselective pore formation. Also, a Cys residue located Nterminal to the second NPA motif, which may be
involved with inhibition of water permeability by mercurial compounds [34], was identical in Japanese eel AQP1b.
In silico analysis of AQP1b C-terminal amino acid
sequence revealed that a consensus residue (Ser), had
high phosphorylation score and fulfilled the criteria for a
Pro-directed kinase phosphorylation site, also found in
the C-terminus of fugu, sole, and sea bream AQP1b, but
not European eel [32]. These consensus sites may be
involved in the control of AQP1b intracellular trafficking
through phosphorylation-independent and -dependent
mechanisms [32].
Present RT-PCR analysis revealed that Japanese eel
aqp1b transcripts were highly abundant in the ovary.
The present result observed in the ovary is in accordance with the previous studies in teleosts spawning
pelagic eggs into seawater, such as the European eel,
gilthead seabream and Senegalese sole [32]. Our data
also showed faint, but significant, aqp1b transcript
expression in the testis of Japanese eel, however expression was not detected in other tissues. Although relatively lower levels of aqp1b transcripts were found in
gut, kidney and gills of gilthead seabream and the European eel [32], specific aqp1b transcripts were not
observed in testis. These differences in the AQP1b distribution, especially that of testis, may reflect differences

Figure 8 Immunohistochemical localization of AQP1b in Japanese eel tertiary yolk globule, migratory nucleus, and mature stage. Two
successive sections of the Japanese eel oocytes at the tertiary yolk globule stage (A, D), the migratory nucleus stage (B, E), and the mature stage
(C, F) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (A, B, C) and immunocytochemically stained with anti-eel AQP1b (D, E, F). Faint but clear
immunoreaction was detected around the yolk globules (D) and the large yolk mass (E, F). Bars indicate 50 μm.

between species and/or sexual maturation stages,
although the exact reasons are unclear, as detailed physiological information about the stage of fish was not
provided in the previous report [32]. In mammals,
AQPs are involved in the regulation of fluid resorption
in the efferent duct [35,36] and also in the volume
reduction of spermatids [37]. Therefore, in teleosts,
further investigation of the physiological significance of
AQP in testis is warranted.
In situ hybridization analysis showed that eel aqp1b
mRNA was expressed in oocytes at the perinucleolus
stage. This is the first information showing sub-cellular
localization of aqp1b gene transcripts in any teleost
oocytes and the result confirms the RT-PCR data indicating that seabream aqp1b is expressed in ovaries containing oocytes at the previtellogenic and early
vitellogenic stages. Moreover, our data showed the dispersion of intense hybridization signals found in oocytes
at the perinucleolus stage become faint in association
with oocyte growth and maturation. The previous data
obtained by RT-PCR showed that the levels of seabream
aqp1b mRNA did not change significantly during oocyte
growth and maturation [4]. Therefore, in Japanese eel,
as indicated in seabream [4], mRNA which is synthesized in oocytes during the early growth phase might be
dispersed in oocyte cytoplasm but total amounts of
aqp1b mRNA might maintain constant levels during
subsequent oocyte growth and maturational stages. RT-

PCR analysis is needed to obtain direct evidence on
changes of aqp1b mRNA levels during oocyte maturation of Japanese eel in future.
Immunocytochemical analysis showed that eel AQP1b
protein is synthesized in early vitellogenic oocytes.
These results are identical to the data obtained in
oocytes of gilthead seabream [4]. During oocytes growth,
gonadotropin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [38],
directly acts on ovarian follicles to produce estradiol17b (E2 ) through the collaborative actions of theca and
granulosa cell layers [39]. Vitellogenin is synthesized by
hepatocytes following induction by E2 [40] and is then
incorporated into growing oocytes by receptor-mediated
endocytosis [41,42] by stimulation of FSH [43,44].
Therefore, FSH, E2 or other factors, such as IGF-I [31]
found in the follicles, may regulate eel AQP1b synthesis
at post-translational levels, as suggested in the previous
studies of mammals [45,46].
During oocyte maturation of Japanese eel (meiosis
resumption), the yolk granules fused and increased in
size to become large yolk masses but did not form a single yolk mass [5]. These morphological changes
observed during oocyte maturation is different from
those observed in the gilthead seabream [4] in which
the yolk granules fuse into a single yolk mass. In the
gilthead seabream, during oocyte maturation, AQP1b
translocated towards oocyte periphery and become concentrated within a thin layer just below the oocyte

plasma membrane, suggesting that AQP1b located at the
plasma membrane is essential for water influx into
oocytes. However, in the Japanese eel, immunocytochemical analysis showed that immunoreactions of eel
AQP1b were mainly observed around the fused yolk
masses in oocytes at the migratory nucleus and mature
stages. Localization of AQP1b just below the oocyte
plasma membrane found in the gilthead seabream is not
apparent in the present study. These morphological differences of yolk masses and different localization of
AQP1b during oocyte maturation observed between gilthead seabream and the Japanese eel may be reflected by
the varied mechanism of hydration of oocytes. In the
Japanese eel, oocyte hydration may be regulated by a
two-step mechanism. At the start of hydration, water
may pass into the oocyte through the plasma membrane
and then into the yolk mass through AQP1b localized
in the yolk membrane, resulting in swelling of the yolk
mass. As suggested in the gilthead seabream [4], it may
also be possible that water influx from blood and ovarian fluid into oocyte can occur by simple diffusion (a
comparatively slow influx) through the follicular
(somatic cells) and oocyte membranes, since a longer
period of time (5 days in vivo [5]) is required to accomplish hydration during oocyte maturation of the Japanese eel. Further studies are necessary to obtain
conclusive evidence of AQP1b localization on plasma
membrane of Japanese eel oocytes.

Conclusions
Based on the present study and the previous in vitro
data [5], mechanisms of oocyte hydration during meiotic
maturation can be explained in the Japanese eel. During
the previtellogenic stage (at the perinucleolus stage),
mRNA of eel aqp1b are synthesized in the oocytes, perhaps by maternal gene expression and/or synthesized
from ovarian follicle, since the darkly staining aqp1 transcript masses are found around oocytes. Synthesis of
AQP1b protein is stimulated when oocytes begin vitellogenesis. The gonadotropin, FSH and/or E 2 may be
involved in the initiation of AQP1b synthesis in oocytes.
During oocyte maturation, accumulated AQP1b in
ooplasm is translocated around the yolk mass, which
forms by the fusion of yolk globules, and by the proteolytic cleavage of vitellogenin-derived yolk proteins.
Water transport is mediated by these AQP1bs which are
located at different sites on the oocytes along with the
osmotic driving force created by the accumulated yolk
protein-derived free amino acids and inorganic ions [5].
Further studies on other evolutionally primitive species,
such as conger eel Conger myriaster and Pike eel Muraenesox cinereus, may provide more insight to confirm
this contention.
